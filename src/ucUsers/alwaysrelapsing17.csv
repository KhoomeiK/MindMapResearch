EDAnonymous,fpk5u3x,t1_fpjnm8a,1588688568.0,I and a bunch of people on this sub have had psychs who have been really insensitive and clueless about handling/treating EDs. I don't really know what their training looks like but I don't really think psychs are the end-all be-all on ED expertise unless they are specialists and have handled a lot of patients with ED. the minimum BMI req and rather than a %bodyweight change req for diagnosis IMO means people a- don't get help till it's very late and b- treatment (even for those who don't need weight restoration) tends to be viewed as more physical than mental.

EDAnonymous,fpivj7s,t3_gdo7xx,1588649701.0,"I did for a couple months but then just changed what I follow. I mostly follow musicians, animals, and good news accounts and now I really enjoy insta so much more. Ofc seeing impossibly model hot gals is inevitable (especially as I get more into fashion, especially vintage my fucking god those girls are so thin I want to die) but it helps to have it not be the only thing on my feed. I've lived in a couple diff CA coast cities near LA and the truth is that yeah, most college age girls here are thin (BMI 18-22 is most common) and do drink a lot and sometimes splurge on food, but their lifestyles are either a- really casually active (like on nights I party, I probably walk a mile or two going out from party to party then walking home and I dance a lot, as well as walking to classes, spending a lot of time hiking outdoors and on the beach) and they spend a lot of time eating whole foods

b- really non-casually active (like they intentionally go out of their way to do a lot of cardio, biking, running, yoga and stuff) just because they enjoy it or because there's a social pressure to do it, and their diets kind of vary depending on how diet culturey they are.

c- are super sedentary but end up kind of OMAD or 2MADing because they're lazy about food or disordered. 

If you're college age here it's really easy to be active because going out to drink and going out with friends and going to class requires a lot of walking or biking, and the outdoors tend to be so beautiful that going on hikes and walks is really fun anyways, so splurging and being really thin is normal (even though I can't splurge and I'm still not fucking thin lol). Ultimately though like others have said the pics aren't real life. Unless they're a fitness blogger they're not posting their salad or the meal they skip for coffee cause they're bloated from their hangover. They post the fun parts and keep the restricting to themselves, because there is almost always some amount of restriction w that body type if you don't work out a fuck ton, and that shit is really common and accepted here."
EDAnonymous,fpitp3d,t1_fpib5fl,1588648486.0,"u hit a real slippery slope here comparing this to other illnesses- obviously being UW w AN is way diff to handling someone at a normal BMI w AN but i really don't see why someone who lost, say 30% of their body weight and went from OW to normal vs someone who lost 15% and went from normal to UW using the exact same behaviors should be treated for the mental illness and malnourishment aspect any differently. sure their meal plans will probs have diff portions but if they had the same behaviors, are lacking in the same vitamins, and other stuff like that their treatment generally should be the same and so should the dx. on top of that I've heard of a lot of people w an UW bmi who struggle wayyy more w BP than restriction getting dxed w AN when they clearly had way more BN behaviors. a % change in bodyweight criteria makes sense but the focus on the BMI really ends up blurring some lines for how people receive treatment and we really need to stop making treatment plans based on weight w the exception of people in severe need of weight restoration.

Also, saying ""Are you a doctor?"" is just totally off base because the sheer quantity of drs who have barely any knowledge about EDs."

EDAnonymous,fpip3ol,t1_fph58c4,1588645600.0,Agree- i think maybe setting a %loss of body mass might be okay for the criteria but saying you have to be UW to get an AN dx when someone could have developed it while OW and lost a fuck ton super unhealthily seems pretty invalidating and harmful.
EDAnonymous,fpi31e2,t1_fpi2c3t,1588632676.0,i'm 5'4 and 139 (but super high body fat %) and I've lost like 8 lbs in the past month!! it's not the fastest but I barely work out and was so sick I didn't get out of bed to do anything but pee for like 10 days and my mom had to bring me all my food lol. it's a slower loss for sure but I doubt you'd gain on it besides a few days of water/food weight initially and I think it's super worth the energy level and reduction in binges for me. it is scary as hell to bump up your cal count though so maybe if you tried doing it by 100kcal a week (you don't even have to get all the way to 1200-1500 but even a little boost helps a lottt) and seeing the scale and how you feel.

I think this is the most important part here. It sucks that he's so deep in denial about his ED and so triggering to you and I'm really sorry about this bc I can't even begin to imagine how torturous it must be. But I think that it's important he cuts the crap to at least understand ED or not, he needs to eat in front of her (normal portions, normal foods, no diet talk) and have food in the house or else she's going to be at a really high risk."

EDAnonymous,fphtff3,t3_gdkf8c,1588627480.0,"I think there's a diff between haes and body positivity

I don't subscribe to haes (although I do believe you can be a little OW or a little UW and be healthy and you can be smack in the middle of the BMI range and not be healthy) but I do believe in body positivity - just because a body isn't healthy doesn't mean it doesn't deserve to be loved doesn't mean the person in that body isn't worthy and equal to someone in a more conventionally attractive one.

I think it's just about acknowledging that all bodies can be beautiful, but a twist I like to add onto it is that our purpose isn't to be visually pleasing and beautiful. body positivity might not look like telling yourself you love how your body looks, it might look like being proud of how your body carries you places and that you can climb, run, jump, cook, bike, dance, sing, hug people, show love, and do all these awesome things w your body, no matter what it looks like. learn to love bodies for what they can do and the people they carry, and finding them beautiful will come naturally."

a- buy groceries on your dime that she would like and are kind of hers but can be yours to eat when you're eating more than just safe foods so you're technically not eating food that's hers? or maybe

b- ask her to label things w a sticky note like ""shareable"" ""not shareable"" ""shareable but only 1 serving"" or something?


it sounds like a really uncomfortable situation for you and I recognize that she wanted her food but it does suck that she said it so meanly imo and wasn't necessarily clear that you could only have a bit."
EDAnonymous,fpeciz2,t3_gcwm11,1588544806.0,I'm really sorry for your loss and that you're in a position of having this information and not knowing what to do with it. Have you been seeing a grief counselor or anyone to help you through this? I think talking to someone who really gets what you and your family are going through and what you're all like will help a lot. I hope that whatever you choose to do helps you and your family heal.
EDAnonymous,fpebvpk,t3_gcy4yg,1588544435.0,"i have 2 midterms this week and reading this title smacked me in the fucking face damn and i could've written every bit of this post (apart from being a music student) so i get how you're feeling

what I've been doing is either reading the sub btwn readings/lectures/assignments. it's really hard to motivate myself to get started on them and i get easily distracted but i've been doing it bit by bit anyways. another issue is that i won't watch a lecture or do a thing if i know i won't give it 100% or take good notes but that's just slowing me down, so it's been helping me a lot to give myself permission to half ass an assignment or watch a lecture without taking notes while playing some irrelevant game on the side. i usually go back and .75ass it so then I have like, low A to mid B quality stuff. you don't need to be perfect, just pick up your instrument and lazily finger some keys or something for a bit. then pick it up again in a bit and you'll do better. you can do it <3 online terms suck and this isn't your fault- everyday life just isn't what it was two months ago and you're doing your best"

if you get triggered pls don't read this but if anyone is scrolling by and can offer any response I feel really alone and it would help a lot for me to feel heard if someone just dropped any kind of comment even if it's just an emoticon... thank you

EDAnonymous,fpdfs67,t1_fpcwqpw,1588526133.0,"u sound like an amazing friend <3 unfortunately (assuming she's arab) mental health and esp ed tendencies are brushed under the rug and I think she might be scared to be open because she knows she won't be able to get the help she needs. idk much about saudi arabia's mental health care but i do know culturally, she isn't going to be able to get the support she needs from most family and friends and they'll definitely normalize and enable her ED behaviors. i think she knows that you prolly have an ED too because of your purge mark so hopefully when she's ready to talk and fix stuff she'll talk to you but if she's not looking to get better and neither are you, then being open might be damaging or triggering for either one of you."
EDAnonymous,fpdfbhk,t1_fpcvpo6,1588525871.0,my guess is that since we went to GPs and not ED specialists they may have just given the vaguest dxs possible bc they knew they were EDs and need to give it to us for insurance/referral purposes but don't know how to pick apart the mental aspect correctly

IE doesnt work for me either so i have a meal plan, ask about that. also if you were thin 10 lbs ago, that really hasnt changed much now even if your perception of it has. do you have more energy for school and work now? is it easier for you to go out and laugh and cook a meal with friends? these things add so much beauty to you!"

come to think of it the whole THG franchise is ridiculously vain about EDs. Jennifer Lawrence is the weird fucked up ""rawr xD I just love food soOOOoOOO much im not like these other girls who starve just to be pretty"" and while the vomiting thing is kind of a ridic show of wealth i feel like it does kind of berate bulimics for being ""wasteful"" even though a lot of us grew up in poorer familes >> ate worse food >> had more anxiety abt its availability leading to bingeing"

EDAnonymous,fp90lpp,t3_gbzlvk,1588409735.0,"I know this is a rant but I find your writing style really witty and hilarious. I found myself empathizing with you, smiling at your jokes, and relating to you. Despite your struggle w your ED, your personality shines through in this post and you really are more than your ED. The space between relapses will get longer and longer, and you are strong enough to tough it out until you get there again. There is nothing to be ashamed of if hard times bring you down, because you've shown you can put in the work, get back up, and do what you need to. It sucks that you have to do it though and I'm sorry for your pain."
