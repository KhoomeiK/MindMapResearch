UCSantaBarbara,fnx2tao,t3_g4elb0,1587330363.0,"hi! i am an out of state student from oregon. personally, i love ucsb. the parties are definitely there if you want it, but there are PLENTY of other things to do. i had a super fun time living in FT and there were always always activities going on. not to mention you can literally go to the beach whenever you want. but please please really consider the cost. i am unfortunately having to consider transferring back home because its so expensive for out of state students. if you got financial aid or something, or you really can afford it, great. i think you’ll really like it there. but if you are like me, and are less focused on the long-term reality of just how much money it will cost, id really recommend thinking if its worth it. especially if you are considering any type of grad school which you will also have to pay for!! i love ucsb with my whole heart, but when i was in high school i definitely didnt think enough about the reality of the price. hope this helps!!"
UCSantaBarbara,fnx25no,t3_g4echn,1587329992.0,"hey ! i had a pretty similar experience, just with a regular physician rather than a gyno. i was so so sick with flu like symptoms and wasnt getting better at all, so i went into student health just for the doc to tell me i was being dramatic, wasting my money by going, wasn’t really that bad, and that i should be thankful I wasnt in the er like other kids who had the flu. now I certainly was thankful I wasnt in the er, but I usually am pretty good when it comes to getting sick and something definitely didnt feel right to me. would definitely recommend going some place else if you need medical care. i know its so much more expensive especially if you have to uber and whatnot but that doctor was so rude and unprofessional."
