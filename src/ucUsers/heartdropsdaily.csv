leaves,fpmx2t6,t1_fpmaqtm,1588744006.0,"[Raises hand] I‚Äôm elsewhere in this thread saying that today was the day to start for me. Still haven‚Äôt smoked, now fighting off the urge before I go to bed.

This is not the first time I‚Äôve tried to leave weed behind, but maybe the first time I feel I have the experience and know-how necessary to make this time successful. That experience includes many of the harms identified in this post, but like you I‚Äôve known about them for a long time and just never felt ‚Äúready.‚Äù

Well, I count myself among the lucky ones who hasn‚Äôt hit rock bottom, but it definitely took me staring at the possibility of a significant failure to really kick my ass in gear. And it still isn‚Äôt easy, I‚Äôm just starting and this day was already hard. 

But one of the things that really made it click was realizing just how difficult (mentally/emotionally) simple tasks and sustained focus have become. I struggle to do anything that‚Äôs not highly engaging for more than 15-20 min, and that‚Äôs no way to read a book or learn a skill.

One thing I‚Äôve been using to keep me grounded is my guitar. I used to be much better than I am now but I always thought I should practice more even when I was younger and taking lessons. Since that time I have felt shame whenever I look at my instrument because of how little I played it. Now whenever I get and urge to smoke I‚Äôve told myself I‚Äôm just gonna pick up the guitar and fiddle for a bit. It might not fix the problem every time, but at least for today it gave me something to focus on and feel proud of rather than turning to my crutch of smoking pot at the slightest obstacle."

But this harm reduction strategy is the only argument the Democrats have going for them not just this election - but so many elections going back. Even Obama, who excited to many people with the promise of something fresh and new, ended up continuing along a destructive path of foreign, economic, and environmental policy that merely set the table for Trump to tear down.

Getting Biden is not a victory. It‚Äôs not even harm reduction at this point. The corporate wing that controls the Democratic Party is fully OK with sending earth to hell in a hand basket by making no meaningful effort to combat carbon emissions, has been complicit in the dismantling of social programs and union labor, cheerleaders for bloody wars around the world.... the list goes on. Not to mention Joe Biden is a rapist.

The time is now to vote green. The corporatist parties have held a stranglehold on our politics for too long. Enough voters are disaffected that we could actually hit the 5% threshold to qualify for federal funding and begin to build a people‚Äôs movement to wrest control of the levers of power from the people who operate them now to the suffering of millions."

If you don‚Äôt have any close friends or a place to make a Bugout cabin, I would suggest checking out r/vedc for good suggestions for what to carry in your car in case you get stranded or need to travel far on short notice.

During all of this time, I would recommend searching around your area for clubs and interest groups where you can make some friends. Not only will this be a good chance to enjoy yourself and meet people, it will be important to establish a few connections in case things start to go crazy. People are much more likely to help/join/not compete with people they know even from a brief interaction.

The fact is, if someone were not sleeping without exhibiting any other possible hypo symptoms, that alone would be enough to raise concern and ask them if they needed anything like a workload reduction or a check-in.

bigdickproblems,fmlnl43,t1_fmlcz6m,1586189837.0,"I think in general it‚Äôs wrong to tell a sexual assault survivor they ‚Äúneed to take it seriously,‚Äù and in this specific case seems to be missing the point. OP is obviously taking it seriously because it is bothering him to the point of asking for advice about it. Whether he chooses to report it is an intensely personal decision that has potential costs as well as any potential benefits, as OP described.

I think the most helpful thing right now is to validate feelings, acknowledge that what happened was not OK and support him in his attempt to understand how he feels about it. Telling him how to feel isn‚Äôt helping anybody."

Red Wings were great a while ago but have seen a quality decrease since the offshoring/outsourcing. That said, everyone‚Äôs feet are different and if you have a brand you like that treats you well then there‚Äôs no problem in sticking with it."
