UCSD,fpj22lz,t1_fpiybvn,1588654439.0,"I'm really not sure where you read that I said “oh don’t say that"" for anyone?  Honest discussion across views is beneficial, and all I'm saying is that we should refrain from attacking someone and calling them 'wrong' just because our experience was different.  I'm not sure where you saw that you were asked 'to share an experience'.   The post I saw was a student discussing his experience and why he is transferring and someone responded with:

>but you're frankly quite wrong on the situation ... As a Mexican-American 1st generation college student, I can say I haven't experienced racism at all ... I don't think anyone would ever treat you explicitly like that

which seems to me is just one example of an attempt to discredit OP from his own experiences with racism.  I'm not saying his opinion should be silenced altogether, I think sharing his own experience is valuable in the discussion, but their approach in accusing them of lying hinders was unnecessary.  Attacking other's because they have different experiences hinders productive conversation."
UCSD,fpiw8q7,t1_fpiqhar,1588650184.0,"I don't think you understood the point of my post.  It is absolutely our right as students to share our experience, I don't at all believe that everything is perfect and the problems people face should absolutely be shared.  The problem I had from the other post surrounding racism had to do with the fact that people were actually discrediting OP from his own experience with racism by saying that they had personally never experienced racism.  This is a similar repeated problem we see with people struggling in their social life being attacked because other people were able to make friends, or vice versa.  I don't quite understand how this would invalidate your experiences."
UCSD,fpivq3s,t1_fpi78z7,1588649828.0,"Yes I definitely agree, it is valuable to have a place to share and hear from the challenges and successes of other students.  I just think we can improve in facilitating discussions where people don't attack each other because their experience was different"
UCSD,fpima44,t1_fpiaiyd,1588643865.0,"Yes I agree!  There are definitely some inarguable aspects of our school that influence other parts of it, but within that we need to respect the individual experiences and sentiments people have"
UCSD,fpilr6s,t1_fpidpw9,1588643548.0,"I think you misunderstood my post, I'm not at all trying to silence people who have shared their bad experience at the school, I think that is super important, I'm just trying to say that the facilitation of these discussions could be improved.  Specifically, I actually resonate with a lot of the people sharing their difficulty making friends and staying social.  But I also know a lot of people that have had a great time making great connections in and out of class, and people usually say ""just join clubs! or go greek! talk to your suitemates!"", but those specific things have not worked out for me.  I've joined tons of orgs but just haven't found my niche, and I prioritize academics and taking care of chronic illness which just doesn't leave me a lot of time left for social stuff.  My point is just that I think we should be able to acknowledge that just because some person had a bad experience doesn't mean that NO one can have I good one, and just because someone had a good experience doesn't mean ANYone can have a can have a good one either, which is typically the theme I see on these posts.

Obviously people facing any type of racism is an issue that needs to be addressed.  But if you read some of the replies to that post some say that OP was wrong because they personally hadn't experienced any racism (problematic my point from earlier) and on the other hand others agreed and said that a large amount of asians are racist, which is still problematic but in a different way because its a pretty blanket statement that could accuse innocent people of disgusting behavior.

I appreciate you pointing out some of the flaws in my wording, but I think we may be on the same page here."
UCSD,fphu3g2,t3_gd10sz,1588627827.0,"lol at the people saying it's ""an essential skill"" for the future, I think everyone knows HOW to work in a group, and it certainly hasn't made the people who are bad at working in groups any better.  No need to waste time coordinating with people for tasks that can be done individually"
UCSD,fphturx,t3_gd10sz,1588627703.0,Not to mention people probably giving less effort from the pass/no pass situation or taking extra classes could be hurting their teammates
UCSD,fmqo402,t1_fmh65kn,1586303478.0,"I feel like typically ""college experience"" is usually used to talk about everything other than academics, and its gonna vary person to person, for me, definitely yes.  My first year I spent a lot more time socializing, and going out, and my closest friends were people who enjoyed doing that too.  My second year my course load picked up even more, and I made the decision to go out less, study more.  From an outside perspective it seems depressing: because my life wasn't as ""fun"" as it was the previous year, or my friends at other schools, and I was lost touch with my friends who just wanted to party.  But ultimately this was my decision, and I felt more fulfilled spending a lot more time on my academics, and any extra time I put towards relaxing activities or me-time.  My point is, the ""college experience"" is being able to do whatever you want, if that makes sense."
UCSD,fmqlp80,t1_fm1yjt3,1586302084.0,"I was in a similar situation: accepted for cs at other UCs and data science at sd.  I went with data science because I had very little experience coding so either major would essentially be brand new for me and data science seemed new and exciting.  It was definitely the right choice for me in a lot of ways, but also some drawbacks.  I'll share some because choosing a school was so difficult for me too.  I've enjoyed being in Data Science at UCSD because it is a smaller program than CS, I'm on a first name basis with the advisors (if you get the opportunity to chat with them, please do, they're amazing!!), classes are still 100-150 students in a lecture, but typically just one section per quarter, so people in your major/year will be in the same classes.  I'm sure you know already from UCSD's reputation, but the computer science program is super popular, especially in Warren college.  Personally, I'm glad I'm in a reputable major and school where I get to code and such without the intense pressure and competitiveness that is so present in the cs department.  Not to say data science is easier, but since its smaller theres less chance of you meeting data science kids outside your classes.  One thing I will say, and I'm sure you know already, at any of your choices of schools your classes will be HARD.  I hope if you haven't already, find a passion for coding/problem solving and accomplishment in what a challenge it can be, it'll be the only way to get through the major.  My choice for UCSD and data science definitely helped me appreciate and find interest in my academics.  If you don't see that ever being you, or really don't lean either way, I would choose the school that is the best for you in anything outside of the major (location, living, food, ect.).  Hope this helps!"
