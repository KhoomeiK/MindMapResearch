neoliberal,fpeo55n,t3_gcydad,1588551355.0,"I’ve been reading Ben Rhodes’s book *The world as it is* and I’ve had two main takeaways. The first is that, retrospectively, the sheer amount of fake news, conspiracy theories, and cynically evil shit that was getting thrown at the Obama administration was hard to properly digest. While it had a lot personal, and public effect on the members of the administration, few would’ve actually believed the tangible effect it was having on the electoral psyche of America. 

And as the media struggled, and ultimately failed, to handle this new subset of misinformation, the institutionalized powers in government that could’ve worked to correct the record didnt. They were either hamstrung by congressional gridlock, or actively abetting the spread of the conspiracy theories for political gain. 

I often talk to my dad about politics, and while he has drifted further left, after he wrote in a name in 2016 after admittedly falling for the fake news casting Hillary in a bad light, he still retains many MAGA loving friends. One thing he told me to always keep in mind is that they see us as crazy as we see them. The difference is we’re not actually insane. 

We as neoliberals need to be cognizant that in a manner of sorts, our fellow countrymen are victims of the misinformation campaign perpetrated to undermine our institutions. Now this doesn’t absolve them of their incorrect beliefs, and I lament the idiocy that they have allowed to fester in our institutions, but the malicious actors that created all the fake news are who we need to focus our attention against.

I gotta close this by thinking melancholically on what could’ve been. I feel somewhat responsible by proxy of failing to ensure the progress all these great public servants had worked so tirelessly for endured. But I know that they would say not to work for their sake, but for everyone’s. I can’t wait to kick that orange bastards ass in November. 

PS, if you want a reminder of what a president with empathy looks like, watch Obama sing amazing grace after the Charleston church shooting."

Catholicism,fow75f9,t1_foven4m,1588114258.0,"Thanks for your patience. First, I want to preface my response by saying that what I am arguing for is not that every catholic must vote for Trump. I know multiple people who are catholic and do not feel they could ever vote for someone who is pro-choice, which I understand. They are effectively single-issue voters, and will always vote for a pro-life politician, regardless of any other policy. They have every right to do so, and I would never dispute that. What I am merely arguing is that no catholic should feel compelled to vote for Trump, and that the church has allowed for a wide range of political positions one can hold in good conscious. This conclusion, which I reached after debating, wrestling, and investigating over a significant period of time, is why I feel not only allowed but justified in voting for Joe Biden. 

A Catholic cannot vote for a candidate who favors a policy promoting an intrinsically evil act, such as abortion, euthanasia, assisted suicide, deliberately subjecting workers or the poor to subhuman living conditions, redefining marriage in ways that violate its essential meaning, or racist behavior, if the voter's intent is to support that position. In such cases, a Catholic would be guilty of formal cooperation in grave evil. At the same time, a voter should not use a candidate's opposition to an intrinsic evil to justify indifference or inattentiveness to other important moral issues involving human life and dignity.
USCCB 34 Making Moral Choices

Let me be perfectly clear, I am pro-life and reject euthanasia. I understand that these two issues take precedent over all others in regards to the how a catholic should vote. Yet while they may carry more weight, that does not mean other issues do not carry weight as well. Aside from those two issues, I probably disagree with Trump on every single issue. You can see there are two other significant issues that are seen as intrinsically evil. Policies that promote racist behavior, and subjugate the worker to unjust conditions. From Trump’s muslim ban, to his racist protectionist policies all to fund his wall, his comments on “s-hole countries”, to most glaringly his separation of families seeking refugee status are fine examples of his willingness to harm the global poor, the disenfranchised, and the voiceless. These are all examples of his policies that have explicitly gone against catholic social teaching on charity. 

In your second and third points (I’m ingnoring your first point because I agree with you, catholic moral teaching should of course influence your political beliefs) you say you are unconvinced that Trump is racist, bigoted, and anti-poor, yet I ask you what else could he be if he rejects expert opinion on free trade, open-borders, and institutionalized poverty? Experts agree that a carbon tax would be an exceptional manner of helping to engage in a market based solution in reducing carbon emissions, yet he rejects that as well, and Biden has addressed all of these issues, providing far more evidence based solutions. 

Remember the words of the poem The New Colossus? “Give me your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. / Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, / I lift my lamp beside the golden door!” What is more American than assisting those who seek to come to our home, build the life they dream of, and contributing to society? 

And in regard to the democratic position on higher taxes for the extremely wealthy, it fits with the Gospel, specifically Luke 12:48 “to whom much is given, much shall be required”. Those who have so much excess, while others are living destitute have an obligation to offer charity. If they will not do it out of their own volition, then the state has a mandate to aquire taxes to help ensure the destitute are not left on the edges of society. Remember, Aquinas himself said that is a starving man does not receive charity, then he is within his right to take what he needs from others, as that which he takes belongs to him. It was a failure of those who had what he needed to not provide for him. 

Finally, in regards to argument 4, you say that Trump’s personal moral character is beside the point. I disagree wholeheartedly. I find the moral character of someone to be of great importance. Joe Biden has seen personal tragedy that few could imagine. Losing a daughter, wife in a car accident is a terrible fate, and to make matters worse he lost one of his surviving sons to brain cancer. To endure such loss, and maintain his commitment to public service is a testament to his moral character. He even took the train every night while he was in the Senate to go see his sons every night. Trump on the other hand has been divorced twice, married three times, and even cheated on his current wife while she was 8 months pregnant. He is a morally bankrupt man, who has said he has nothing to apologize for. He got draft dispensation, then called not getting an STD, “his personal Vietnam”. Laws are a reflection of our morals, and our leaders should be willing to fight for our morals.

Hopefully I have illustrated how a catholic can arrive at the conclusion that they could vote for biden, if not convinced you to change your vote. Again, my intention was not to “make the catholic case” because I respect the right of catholics to hold different policy beliefs. These differences are necessary. If you would like any clarifications feel free to ask."

YouthForBiden,fovasvr,t3_g9rp64,1588098217.0,"My first choice was Beto O’Rourke. I remember following his senate campaign, and I felt his focus on values as a response to Trump was what this country needed in a post trump presidency. After his campaign failed to launch, I briefly danced between Bennet, Warren, then finally Buttigieg. But when my state of California started early voting, I pulled the trigger for Biden, and I actually cast my vote before South Carolina. 

I believe my ultimate reason for switching is that I came to the conclusion that Biden was the most likely to win the primary, and that his skill set was more than enough to help repair the damage the Trump administration has caused. I’m a poli sci major focused on foreign affairs, so Biden’s experience is second to none in that regard.
