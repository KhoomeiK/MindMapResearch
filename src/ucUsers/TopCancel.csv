Having a student play scales and passages slowly is a classic method to focus on projecting and producing good, even tone.

Not really.

>Senior engineers at apple don't break 300k even with stock.

>https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Apple-Principal-Software-Engineer-Salaries-E1138_D_KO6,33.htm

No one takes glassdoor seriously for tech. Levels.fyi is much much more accurate (companies have even given tacit confirmations of its accuracy). ICT4 at apple is 300+. 

Facebook, Google, and Amazon all pay around 500k at L6 (amazon's equivalent is L7). 

Vis a vis a doctor who usually has to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in tuition to obtain their degree, spend 3-7 years after as a resident working 80-100 hour weeks getting paid 50k a year, and finally make the big bucks once they are almost in their 30s, many Cal EECS grads will probably be close to if not at L6 lol. If you can't do the math on how the opportunity cost + average medical school debt-loads look like, its easiest to just say that its not pretty. Many doctors don't pay off their school loans until mid-late career. 

And lawyers? If you don't go to an elite T14 school, you're basically screwed for biglaw. The school debt problems+opportunity cost are a bit less than they are for doctors, but they don't have any job guarantee even if they went to a T14. A lot of 'average' lawyers work in small firms making less than 100k. 

So yeah. Imo tech/EECS is a much more lucrative career track, with much better work life balance (30-40 hour weeks are pretty common). You literally get to start maxing out your 401k your first year out of college if you do things right. I'd say if anything, traditional finance has more potential 'upside', but even that is lessened when you include all the quant roles that are available to EECS grads.
