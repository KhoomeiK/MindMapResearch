mentalhealth,fpl8amh,t3_ge1dz0,1588708134.0,I was 16 when it came out and I watched the whole thing in one sitting. I was completely out of touch with reality after that. I started planning my death and become obsessed with “leaving a message” behind for those who had hurt me. even though I’m constantly dissociated now I’ve never felt out of touch to that extent
TMJ,fpl5gom,t3_ge4581,1588706709.0,resist the urge pls i did this too much and my jaw moves out of place so much and I get splitting headaches. also try to sleep on your back instead of on your side
PlasticSurgery,fpezhxj,t1_fpdsw18,1588558328.0,also any glutes exercises will help a lot too!
PlasticSurgery,fpezbzz,t1_fpdsw18,1588558224.0,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=avgynWnxTdk

This one is pretty good! But if you just search “hip abductor exercises” and then look for ones posted by physical therapy channels you’ll find some great options."
PlasticSurgery,fpcgu2x,t3_gcm651,1588500124.0,"my legs look exactly like this! the issue is weak hip abductors. For a week or two, I did hip abductor exercises consistently and my legs began to straighten out. I figure I’d have to do it consistently to keep up the strength"
ucla,fpc1xoe,t3_gck03j,1588485016.0, does anyone know if P/NP grades will be accepted for transfers?
CPTSD,fpbikkj,t1_fpamy86,1588470833.0,"I think of it like everyone starts off with respect but then it can be lost. So your abuser lost that right to be respected. And then in some cases it can be earned back, in some there is not enough that can be done to earn it back."
neuro,foxmgob,t1_foxhoxi,1588148710.0,I have ADHD and I could also relate to this post. I always thought everything felt “loud” but I didn’t realize the extent  until the first time I took meds. My thoughts went from loud screaming noises to a quiet singular thought. other people seem more calm to me too but its just that I’m not having to process what they’re saying with a bunch of noise in my head
CPTSD,fotbc4i,t3_g98ur0,1588049155.0,"I feel like I could’ve written this. Nothing is happening in my house right now, but at some point bad things WERE happening in this same place so I guess my brain is trying to protect me by keeping me on edge. I want to talk to my professors about being in an abusive home because I’m failing some of my classes but it almost feels like I’m lying to them :("
TransferStudents,foskx1y,t1_fosfpxi,1588032738.0,no problem!! and this summer because they (usually) want them all done by the spring before transfer. So let’s say you submit your applications in Fall 2020 - your credits need to be at their minimum by the end of Spring 2021 so that you can start at the university in Fall 2021
TransferStudents,fosenp9,t1_fose55e,1588029227.0,"I attended CC from spring 2019 and will be ending spring 2020, starting university in Fall. I did have to squeeze in a few summer classes, and I have one class worth of AP credit. Figure out where you want to go and what their minimum credits are for transferring and see if you could fit that into a year (look at what classes you’d be taking at your cc and try to make a schedule). Also see how many credits the schools you want to go to give for AP scores- example: my cc is quarter system most classes are 4-5 quarter units but my ap score gave me 8 quarter units. I’ve seen a lot of people transfer within a year, you might just have to be more proactive to schedule everything in!"
TransferStudents,fos95ah,t3_g94xnp,1588026236.0,"If school is going to be online in the Fall, it might be worth to just do community college. Transfer priority is usually given to CC students and you’ll be saving money too"
TransferStudents,foo3aru,t3_g8lbn0,1587931665.0,before you make this decision go visit cal!! I live near there and every time I’ve gone there’s been some sort of misery in the air
AskSF,fokxytw,t1_fokxe5g,1587851077.0,DM me :))
AskSF,foku9h4,t1_foku00k,1587849061.0,FUCK YEAH DM ME I’d love to have a pen pal
AskSF,fokty1u,t3_g80osj,1587848889.0,I’m 19F and don’t live IN the city but near it and can write to you about all the teenage existential crisis experiences I’ve had of lying to my parents taking the train to city and fucking around with my friends until everyone goes home and I’m just wandering alone questioning life
AskWomen,fogxk9g,t1_fofrkkn,1587758120.0,"I’m 19 and I have this odd feeling I’m just not going to wake up one day from all the medical issues I’ve had ignored. Half face randomly droops sometimes, my arms and legs are swollen and hot, I vomit or have diarrhea every time I eat (I’m 99% sure I’m malnourished), my resting heart rate has gone from 55 to 130, and yet every time I go to the doctor I’m told to see a therapist :) to the point where I have to tell them I have seen a therapist!! Who is also a psychiatrist!! And she told me to go the doctor!! I don’t know what more I can do than give them confirmation that a mental health expert has said its not a mental health issue"
TransferStudents,fof3e2c,t3_g75tsf,1587724587.0,Honestly I just vaguely said I had health issues (which I did but I didn’t really explain) and I had I think 5 W’s and I’ve gotten into every single UC I’ve applied to so far.
curlyhair,focfb4p,t3_g6s8oy,1587670653.0,my hair is like this too and CGM has helped a lot
PepTalksWithPops,fo9l9s3,t1_fo9aq3a,1587622845.0,I might go to UC DAVIS too 🥺
DoesAnybodyElse,fo4o2wk,t1_fo4agx9,1587507949.0,"exactly! I’m  seriously so content just hanging out in my room all day and people always come to me “with concern” because they can’t sit by themselves for 10 minutes without being bored therefore I must be depressed. I just don’t have the desire to constantly be doing “productive” things. I read, write, play video games, listen to music and just vibe. All while not being depressed"
AskDocs,fnu8nf7,t3_g3x5s3,1587256824.0,I have these same symptoms but always get dismissed because I’m young and it “must be anxiety” even when I’m just walking everything becomes rollercoaster like. Wish I had your advocacy skills
college,fnp7623,t3_g33719,1587140404.0,"as someone who went to a college then left because admin did a shitty/lawsuit worthy/sort of abusive job of dealing with your extenuating circumstances (that I obviously wasn’t expecting), I approve of this message"
Disneyland,fnjvzf4,t3_g22rut,1587008299.0,omg his little shoes
AskDocs,fnihmsl,t1_fnhy7gd,1586980147.0,oh my god thank you so much! This encompasses pretty much all the random symptoms I’ve been having. Going to try cooking low histamine and see how it goes. Thank you so much
DeAnza,fng7cfe,t3_g1ib0m,1586924112.0,I can’t find any motivation because it just doesn’t feel like I’m in school
ApplyingToCollege,fnc269x,t1_fm9jpgn,1586827047.0,I think I’m going to wait for acceptances too and then call. I think they’ll be more lenient with changes; this was a pretty big collective change in our lives
AskDocs,fnb5u3m,t3_g0ljx2,1586809735.0,"NAD but having the same exact issue. Sometimes the fatigue is so bad I think “if I don’t get to a bed right now I will pass out right here on the floor” and if I try to keep myself awake it feels like my body is saying “if you don’t go to sleep right now you’re gonna die”. I also tested negative for celiac disease but I still cut out gluten completely and it’s made a big difference. In fact, it also fixed a major part of some neurological symptoms ive been having that 4 different specialists couldn’t figure out. Half my face would droop and I’d have to frequently assure people that I wasn’t having a stroke. Seems like more research needs to be done on gluten beyond celiac disease"
TooAfraidToAsk,fn56q4x,t3_fzdl1r,1586657258.0,I’m going to turn 20 soon and it feels wrong because I used to see 20 year olds and think wow they’re all grown up but I feel the same as I did when I was 16
TooAfraidToAsk,fn0ewi0,t3_fygw11,1586540666.0,I used to daydream as a child about going to school at night and being out and about in the darkness. And in school I’d feel distracted and bored until we were doing something where the lights had to be off-then everything was suddenly exciting
introvert,fmvixtf,t3_fxibd0,1586418639.0,"ugh yess my mom always pesters me to go hang out with people constantly and I have to insist that I’m content just being by myself. then she hits me with “that’s social anxiety!!”. no it’s not- I actually ENJOY standing up in front of people and talking, I can strike up a conversation with random people at a party. But then I need to go back to my bed with my doggie to be by myself and recharge"
gaming,fmtz800,t3_fxad6q,1586381647.0,They were in stock at a couple targets near me a few days ago but I’m not feeling well so going in person was not an option :( really wanted to play while I’m stuck in bed but hopefully they’ll be in stock online soon
AskWomen,fmtwn8m,t3_fx688m,1586380320.0,I’m 19F and there’s nothing more in the world that I’ve wanted than to be a mom. I just want to give love so badly. After years of therapy and treatment I feel like I’ve learned to manage my depression very well but “passing it on” is what I worry about. I don’t know how much of it is genetic and how much of it is circumstantial. Would I have been fine if I wasn’t abused and neglected as a child? my brother wasn’t and he’s doing great but was that just him winning the generic lottery? I don’t know :(
Journaling,fmtpgh6,t1_fmsw0wm,1586376737.0,yes but I can’t find the words to articulate why. Something along the lines of “we’re in need of revolution that was never going to happen unless we were shook violently”
neuro,fmsh4o4,t3_fx3qoa,1586355358.0,before reading- my first thought as someone with ADHD is that without medication I struggle to focus because I can’t filter things out. The first time I took adderall I realized I was in constant sensory overload
todayilearned,fmqjgpl,t1_fmpvep7,1586300809.0,"growing up in the Bay Area was the best thing in the world. school trips to the redwoods, 2am drives to the beach,  Caltrain or bart to the city, summer time in Santa Cruz on the boardwalk."
Journaling,fmoxcjw,t1_fmnz2q3,1586270353.0,ahh thank you for this compliment!! made me v happy
SuicideWatch,fmljhtn,t3_fvt989,1586187641.0,I’m depressed myself and I suggest therapy anytime I feel like someone is unloading their problems on me. that’s what a therapist is for... and I even offer to help them find affordable options or someone that works well for them and then if they still say no I’m unfortunately gonna have to limit my contact with them because I have my own shit to deal with too
getdisciplined,fmhcan8,t1_fmh00er,1586074350.0,in psychology this feeling of uniqueness is called “personal fable” and something a lot of adolescents go through
