berkeley,fpi3pvs,t1_fpi0xy1,1588633057.0,"Class Pass is a multi-year contract with AC transit and those buses are still running so the university is obligated to pay.  Student services includes ""Operating and capital expenses for services related to the physical and psychological health and well-being of students."" and all health money is probably being used at the moment.  It also includes ""social, recreational, and cultural activities and programs."" which probably isn't needed but could allow them to redirect some funds to health.  ""Services related to campus life and campus community."" could be things like career center that can operate online, ""Technology expenses directly related to the services"" may be used for their tech programs like loaning laptops (just a guess) and ""Career support"" is being offered online still.  So it looks like the majority of the fee is still being used at a minimum, and some of the money is probably being shifted towards health resources."
berkeley,fpf32ds,t3_gd39me,1588560625.0,"The university needs our money sure but we also need the university to stay afloat in order to not have wasted money on our degree progress, so students aren’t quite in as strong a negotiating position for a drastic tuition drop.  The university actually balanced the budget recently until they were just hit by a $100 million cost, largely from refunding housing.  For many students, the realistic choices are to either accept an online/hybrid semester, or try to find a part-time job in a terrible economy.  Taking some classes at a CC is possible, but you might not find courses that you need that could transfer credits.  Personally, my local community college is also having some financial issues too, so they aren’t immune either."

berkeley,foimrvz,t3_g7npdj,1587790712.0,"Just a heads up that if you were admitted to the college of letters & science, what major you ""enter"" as is basically irrelevant, all L&S freshmen come in undeclared so there's no barrier to switching to focus on CS if thats what you decide.  Also, declaring the L&S CS major requires you to get a 3.3 GPA across 3 prerequisite classes, so thats good to keep in mind.
