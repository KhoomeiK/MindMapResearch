politics,foyw5p6,t1_foysh17,1588180293.0,"Wait are you serious? This man leaked data on drone strikes in Yemen, extrajudicial killings in Kenya, the 2008 unrest caused by China in Tibet, an accident in a nuclear facility in Iran that was never noted, cyberweapons Israel and the US possessed, and most importantly, the murder of 18 innocent civilians (and journalists) from a helicopter. 

If anything that paints America in a bad light is “Russian,” you’re a delusional idiot."

How was pricing for the apartments? From past threads they seem to be expensive, but I don’t know what they’re basing it off of? Thanks!"

TransferStudents,fnu488z,t3_g3ef9m,1587254230.0,I feel you dude. I got rejected from Berkeley too with a 3.82 and good ECs for MCDB for Transfer. I seriously don’t know why they raised the bar so high this year. It’s fucked up my week for the most part.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fnmypd7,t1_fnlwhy5,1587080782.0,"So you’re going to vote for the democratic version of trump who wants to do the exact same thing? This man is one of the main reasons why we killed thousands of our brothers in the Middle East and why thousands of minorities are in jail because of his shitty crime bill!

I hate trump a lot, but he has been a little bit better for working class people compared to Biden.

Not to mention, it’s the job of the voter to vote for people that will represent them, not the ‘best’ option. This is the exact same reason people didn’t vote for Hillary, who was one of the worst candidates and American history!"
ucla,fng5yga,t1_fmz33o7,1586923127.0,"Can you name what this extra money will find? Clearly, you seem to know exactly where this money will go.

Instead of saying this money is going to underrepresented students, tell us WHAT this money will go to. 

Btw, great job using those specific keywords that will get any white liberal on your side."

The US was in the same position in Iraq. There will always be collateral in war and we shouldn’t act like there’s rules to bloodshed."

Interesting question tho"
