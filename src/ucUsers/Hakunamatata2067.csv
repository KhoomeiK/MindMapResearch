ucla,fp3pjbn,t1_fp36bw5,1588283470.0,i mean i don‚Äôt want to risk going to a hospital right now only to risk bringing the virus back to my house since my grandma lives with us and my dad isn‚Äôt super young either :/
ucla,fp3oyx2,t1_fp2y7fs,1588283182.0,the peace of mind part is especially true bc i really can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. but my mom said that we‚Äôll go to her office as soon as they relax measures so i trust her
ucla,fp3os9t,t1_fp3il8p,1588283091.0,i could! i was just thinking that anything a doctor could do over video chat my mom could do in person lololol. i just wanna get the scan done soon and safely
ucla,fp3fw8a,t1_fp376ue,1588278597.0,thank you :))
ucla,fp2x14d,t1_fp2w0al,1588269307.0,"7 1/2 hours is a long ass time to be taking tests lmaooo. i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôll be ok but online classes really aren‚Äôt it for me which is why i‚Äôm especially concerned so i‚Äôve just been cramming and beefing up my notes so hopefully i can scrape by. 

regarding the LUMP, my mom is a physician so she looked at it for me and she told me ‚Äúnot to panic too much‚Äù bc it‚Äôs ‚Äúvery unlikely‚Äù that I have breast cancer due to my age but panicking is all ik how to do pretty much lololol. hopefully it‚Äôs nothing but i still can‚Äôt stop thinking about it :("

ucla,fnnsxik,t1_fnnshgh,1587100769.0,ok awesome! thank you so much for your help :))
ucla,fnmp4uu,t3_g2oryl,1587075502.0,"I like being home too! The thing is, not only do I have no self control, but my time management is shit. Online classes don‚Äôt demand my attention like in person classes do, so failing is a very real possibility for me lololol"
ucla,fni5nnk,t1_fni51l5,1586974398.0,"yes, they do. But ignoring the fact that minority students are treated differently puts them at an even further disadvantage by not addressing their problems and needs. In a perfect world, we wouldn't need a black resources center because everything we ever needed would already be provided to us. Unfortunately, that's not the world we live in."
ucla,fni4at8,t1_fni3mcs,1586973733.0,"Just because we chose to come here doesn't mean we shouldn't have our own spaces for our own well being. Black people make up 4% of the school, so having one thing would not hurt anybody. Calling it ""racism"" is a REACH. This sounds so much like ""all lives matter"". yikes"

ucla,fmyz13r,t1_fmyygwm,1586500372.0,"Well the bruinwalk website is run by moderators and from what I‚Äôve heard, some grade distribution reports are easier to get than others. Idk how it works tho bc i don‚Äôt work on the website. However, some classes will have ratings and reviews even if there‚Äôs no grades bc individual students can log in and leave a rating or review at literally any time."
ucla,fmy1guu,t3_fy2jzb,1586476120.0,They request the grade distribution straight from the Registrar‚Äôs office. It‚Äôs probably one of the most helpful resources imo
ucla,fmxfy2i,t1_fmxf1v7,1586464255.0,"Oh ok! I was confused but i looked up the transfer credit policy and apparently the grades just aren‚Äôt computed into your gpa, but the letter grades are still reported like you said. Thanks!! :))"
ucla,fmmebxd,t1_fmmc03c,1586203730.0,"I totally agree with what you've said about social distancing. People already aren't taking it seriously enough as it is, so an announcement that we've passed the peak would sound like ""return to business as usual"" to some people, which would only make things that much worse. It's partly up to us to decide how long we want this to last, I guess."
ucla,fmm9of5,t3_fvszbd,1586201366.0,"You really put a lot of work into this, and I want to thank you for making such a well thought out argument. Your realism is very much needed and appreciated. There are a couple of things I'd like to mention, though. 

Apparently UW's Institute of Health Metrics has predicted that the nationwide peak will be reached somewhere between April 10-11. California is estimated to reach its peak around April 26-27, and New York's curve is already beginning to flatten out. The combination of the upcoming summer months (like you said) and a massive national and global effort to mitigate the effects of the virus may very well make this pandemic come to a close.

Secondly, if you take a look at the SARS pandemic, it can be concluded that the vaccine doesn't necessarily need to be created for the issue to be resolved since SARS ""mysteriously"" disappeared without one. The timelines of the two viruses are quite similar as well: the first case of SARS was believed to be found in November 2002 and WHO issued a global alert in March 2003. However, SARS was contained by July. Obviously there are some large differences, like how SARS only reached about 8,000 cases worldwide and COVID-19 has already passed 1 million, which is probably due to increased travel and population density over time. But technology is also much more advanced than it was 17 years ago too.

I guess my overall point is that diseases are as complex as the world that we live in, and even expert epidemiologists (which I def am NOT lolol) know that you can crunch all the numbers in the world and the unexpected could still happen. It's good to be realistic, but the situation isn't totally hopeless yet :))"
