premed,fpfj64s,t3_gcyhzj,1588572862.0,“....unless you apply for DO. DOs are looked down upon on in the medical field.” Guy (senior pre-med presenter) didn’t even know what the difference between MD and DO was. Someone had to explain it to him and the whole class.
ucla,fpf3vyr,t3_gd2les,1588561169.0,I think you have to have at least 8 units for some aid
ucla,fpf3qmx,t3_gd2snf,1588561070.0,I’m so sorry for your loss. Our condolences♥️
ucla,fpc3tc8,t3_gcd4rt,1588486695.0,"Lots of research opportunities and volunteering. Depending on your interests, I recommend to look beyond “pre-med” opportunities too like for clubs. Overall, lots of premed resources. It can get overwhelming choosing which one you do and apply to. I would take a look at the faculty for your department/major now and see what research interests you may be interested in. If you can, maybe cold email some, introduce yourself & your interests, and inquire about how you can get in their labs. You can pm me about emailing and navigating through faculty & their research. 

Downside is the quarter system, which will take some getting used to. Another is that some classes esp lower division ones are poorly structured and only 1 or 2 profs are good (LS series for Bio and Chem 14 for Gen Chem) in my opinion. Tests are trickier than they should be too, but if you use all the resources they provide, you should at least feel confident regardless of how you do."

college,fp6kg25,t3_gbm0yx,1588353872.0,Congrats! Chem and Bio are tough w 3-4 classes with it haha
ucla,fp4y0ei,t3_gb8k4u,1588310422.0,"1) CLC, you don’t exactly have to go. You can download the worksheets from their google drive. I find some LAs and people I work w there even more confusing. I’d prob just do the worksheet on my own w a friend in class or get extra help during TA hours. 2) Keep track of objectives. Go through them and make sure you can talk about each in a sentence or so. As you go through LP, read w objectives next to it. 3) Pre-class worksheets for extra practice. 4) Don’t skip discussion. I remember not learning much from discussion, but they were easy points. 

W 7C right now, I feel a lot better w the content. The tests are still challenging esp w the short answers rn, but I feel more in control. You would need a lot of practice and exposure to questions!"

premed,fnf5zrv,t1_flmigcy,1586902034.0,"UCLA premed here. Yes, the competition is tough at times, but I think it only applies to underclassmen really. Once you do upper-div along w your other activities w research and clubs, you’ll realize that you’re really just in competition with yourself. Lotssss of medical opportunities here! Also, premeds like to help each other. Either way, keep your options open. Lots of premeds realize that PhD is what they want to do instead given the PhD exposure here with PIs and TAs. About your grades, adjustment will be tough to the quarter system, you may start w a lower gpa esp w the BIO/CHEM series. But, you learn and develop new study methods, which is crucial when you reach med school. You’ll get to know yourself better with this journey, and UCLA really prepares you w the realities of medical school..."
ucla,fmdq2tk,t3_fumifp,1585974521.0,"Same here. Now, I do 30-min breaks around my house to just sit around/talk to my family without an electronic device. I napped throughout the week in between my classes, but I felt worse after and couldn’t study."
