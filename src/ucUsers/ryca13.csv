television,folzwac,t1_fol42jh,1587874573.0,I meant more the scene where she licks the gun and then goes full action hero.
television,foijm0u,t1_fohn1hy,1587788286.0,"I own Ghostbusters 2016, and I had it on in the background while my husband and I were straightening up. 

My then 3.5yo son looked at the screen during a big action seen with Kate McKinnon and said ""whoaaaaaaaa, she's cooooool!"" in total awe. 

One of his earliest moments of ""cool"" is of a badass woman kicking butt. That means a lot to me."
badwomensanatomy,fofpd2l,t1_fofcr0a,1587740421.0,"Years ago, we were with the in-laws for Christmas. My husband's grandmother saw a bowl of mixed nuts and started eating. ""Oh, I haven't had n-word toes in just about 20 years! [pause] That's probably not what they're called now, is it?""

I was actually really impressed with how quickly she went from ""70 years of conditioning"" to ""I'm 90 but I don't actually have to be racist"". She calls them Brazil Nuts now. 

She had a great look of self-awareness in her eye, too."

It looked like I was trying to go for some ""selfless hero teacher BS"".  

It was the first time I'd been alone in a week and I got to listen to my audiobook the whole time."

HumansAreMetal,fn72a8b,t1_fn6k3y9,1586711903.0,"I was 8 when it happened (USA) so I remember my parents talking about it. 

It definitely got referenced in The Simpsons. 

I don't know that we ever learned much about it in school officially, but there was an assuming that it was something we would all know and be able to reference (we never made it past Vietnam in modern world history, so it was too new for that class and too old for most others, but it got mentioned).  It would get referenced or asked about in science, and it might come up in modern literature, so you'd need to know."
