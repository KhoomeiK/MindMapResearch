ucla,fp8io7i,t1_fp89x0j,1588393303.0,"Yeah I know, I'm taking 120 rn for fun, it's pretty cool compared to all the applied math stuff I've done. I mean it's a bit redudant to take 131C because chapter 11 Rudin is measure, which is where syllabus basically stops at for 131BH and where 245 seems to pick up at. Tbh you can just read any intro topology text and you'd be fine.

That leaves you 2 more slots for other classes. (Not taking 131C/121 and reading topology text and doing exercises)"

ucla,fp7nmt2,t3_gbsahh,1588374073.0,"I would just read Hoffman and Kunze and the related chapters on dual spaces, canonical forms, Jordan forms, cayley-hamilton; read the theorems and definitions, do a handful of exercises, look online for homeworks by other professors at other universities and do those problems, and then call it a day.

You could fill that extra class slot for another more interesting advanced course; I suggest some courses on differential equations, or maybe differential geometry if you haven't taken it yet, and get to the point where you can take grad courses by the end of your second year.

ucla,fne7yux,t3_g12gvd,1586884649.0,"Reframe your attitude from ""I want to get a good grade"" to ""I want to be the best programmer I can be."" 

Start projects early. If anything make time your priority. Don't just talk about it, just sit your ass down and start looking at the specs and have visual studio open with itchy fingers ready for typing.

Try to be a bit more curious on why things work the way they do. (E.g. why is this a good feature of c++? why did stroustrup choose this? What else can I do with this property? Let me try this... Etc...) Challenge yourself beyond what's presented. Check edge cases on your own, plant these things into your subconscious so you build intuition for future problems. 

Don't just review material; solve problems, solve problems, solve problems. CS30s at any university aims to teach lowerclassman problem solving skills, it rewards problem solvers. Esoteric language details and advanced undergraduate theory is left for upper div courses. Focus on problem solving in your review. 

""I didn't feel like I really understood..."" I am assuming you were complacent and easily satisfied with the base definitions and concepts and questioned little of what was taught. This comes across as dickish, but be honest with yourself, did you actually care to understand, or did you leave it up to your professor? 

General attitude moving forward, assuming that you're an undergrad with a lot of classes left to take: nobody will care about your understanding as much as you, therefore you are fully responsible for your learning, whether or not you think that that is ""fair."" 

Have a good time discovering CS."
ucla,fne5x0h,t1_fndufpi,1586883622.0,"Yes, that's clear, I made the comment knowing these assumptions, and I argued that the person should come clean and take responsibility even with extenuating circumstances. 

I understand the comment comes across as possibly tone deaf and insensitive, but the implied intention of deceit on the OP's part is not right even if it's not my place to judge. Money is a big deal in relationships and the parents have every right to know. Money is not an entitlement, it is a privilege."

(The following part will be useless because I guarantee very few have been in your situation grade wise, and it doesn't address the ""will they find out"" question)

Second of all, you know yourself, beyond defense, that your parents who take care of you and support you financially have every right to know about your performance. They deserve an explanation. You shouldn't hide it from them. Take responsibility for your failures and move forward.

I have financial aid too, I couldn't be a student here if I didn't have it, and my father who might default on his mortgage and lose his job, who's already been living paycheck to paycheck, has supported me for the past 3 years of my education as an undergraduate; I've done everything to make sure I make the most of my experience as a student. It sucks not being able to do well, that's completely understandable, and you have a lot fear I can tell. But be honest with them about what's happening, and promise them to do well; do well."

Feeling like an imposter is OKAY. 
Feeling like you're not ready is OKAY.
But I will say that is NOT OKAY to not give yourself the chance to overcome those feelings. We are in a constant state of overcoming, overcoming ourselves. 

It's going to be really fucking hard, shits gonna go down. But you will overcome. Good friend once told me, ""nobody said it would be this hard."" But that's where the glory in challenging yourself comes from. Be excited to work hard, and meet new people from everywhere at UCLA. (Ripping off Tony Robbins, lol)

I'm very happy for you that you got in! Congrats! I remember being really excited about getting in, and even with online classes going on, I am still extremely grateful for being where I am, I find it a privilege to be a student at UCLA.
