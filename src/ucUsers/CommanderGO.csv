PublicFreakout,fpee8x6,t1_fpddaw4,1588545814.0,"Well you have to look at this from a different point of view. If the government is allowed to take away our rights during a pandemic, what stops the government from doing so when the pandemic is over? In their view, this provides precedence for future executive orders and laws that allow the government to infringe upon our rights during any time the state decides that it's necessary. 

Also at least in California a couple months ago, the cops were arresting people who violated quarantine orders. So it definitely wasn't just heavy advising in certain parts of the state. In California, people followed the advise to stay home for the purpose of ""flattening the curve"" and preventing hospitals from getting overwhelmed. The purpose of quarantine isn't to prevent everyone from getting infected but everyone seems to have already forgotten that since the curve assumes everyone still gets infected in the end.

Also if people aren't leaving their homes for things other than essential tasks, how do you expect a person who owns a ""non-essential"" business to survive during this pandemic? As far as these business owners are concerned, they aren't making any money but still have to pay bills and rents just like anyone else. Most of these businesses are practically screwed because even if they get loans like the PPP, they aren't gonna be able to rehire their employees because the unemployment benefits are significantly better than what these business owners can afford (can't have the loan written off as a grant)."

But my point is complaining to Reddit isn't gonna help fix your grade. At least complaining to your professor will help your case so you aren't penalized for your group's incompetence."

Obviously if your friend doesn't have space for you to store your car they're not gonna be able to help you unless they give up their own parking spot for you. If your friend rents a house or commutes, you might be able to leave your car with them parking in their garage or in front of the property, assuming that they have space."

In the event that you class CPS and are worried for your safety you could file a CPO against them so they can't legally get within a certain physical distance from you or your residency.

ucr,foxlg0c,t3_ga3t22,1588147739.0,"It really depends. Like coming from a competitive high school is a relative metric that doesn't tell us anything about you. I have found that most of the classes I've taken aren't that much more difficult than high school, and many classes are easier than high school courses. I personally found myself with a lot more free time and only occasionally stayed up to finish writing assignments the morning they were due. If you plan to work off/on-campus, you probably will have an experience similar to high school.

In my opinion the most important skill that a competitive high school should teach you is how to study smart. You aren't spending your time efficiently or studying smart if you're staying up every night to study, when you could review class material (or devise a method for cheating) a couple nights before midterms/finals as achieve similar results."
ucr,foxb6fc,t3_ga2gry,1588138827.0,"If it's possible, you could wait until there is a professor listed for the class and then try emailing them to take the class. Otherwise, you should probably ask your adviser."
ucr,fotki3x,t3_g96o4t,1588056754.0,It's true. They're more likely to do it for writing assignments.
ucr,foijfy5,t3_g7l5tv,1587788159.0,"Speaking as someone who isn't in honors, as long as you show interest and show competency in whatever skills are needed for a research lab, you should be able to get involved in anyone's research. Although its easier with upper div professors because of the smaller class sizes and they're more likely to know who you are over the course of a class."
ucr,foho0k1,t3_g6z0cb,1587769281.0,"If you have a collaborative study guide with a small group of people in your class, then that's fine. If you have a classwide study guide and email it to everyone via blackboard/email, that's considered unauthorized collaboration. Some professors will allow class-collaborated study guides, but you should ask the professor before contributing anything."

ucr,fnrgms9,t3_g3i8j2,1587188364.0,"Unless you're in the BS+MS program, you'll need to take the GRE and keep a good GPA. You don't necessarily need research and/or internships, but it does help. Whether you graduate early is of no concern to graduate schools, just make sure you have a bachelors before you make it to graduate school."
ucr,fnrgdff,t3_g3d5ti,1587188143.0,"Being in the BS+MS program doesn't really effect your undergraduate experience. The best thing is that you don't need to take the GRE, but you still need to remember to apply during Senior year and get the letters of rec. If you get kicked out of the BS+MS program, you can reapply later to get in.

I personally think most of the BIEN professors are great, it just kind of sucks that you don't really get to take many classes with them until you're in your junior/senior year."
