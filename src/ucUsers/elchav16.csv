science,fpfn80p,t1_fpf16hz,1588576605.0,100%! And think of all the organisms we DON‚ÄôT find fossilized/that just decomposed completely that show all those little gradual changes. Its kind of crazy to think about how much we will probably never know for sure...

People think neanderthals were dumber versions of humans because historically, the whole idea of human evolution portrayed neanderthals as a sort of ‚Äúpro-to human‚Äù that was just less ‚Äúevolved.‚Äù Once popular culture picks up on something, its really hard to change. The history of Anthropology (and science in general, haha) is full of scientists thinking one way, then finding evidence that suggests something entirely different. I‚Äôve taken many courses on human evolution (love this stuff) in college, and I remember having a professor that told us to buy a textbook that was like 5 years old because it was ‚Äúcheaper and still mostly right.‚Äù We keep finding new stuff in the ground and its not even possible to keep textbooks up to date! Another thing he really beat into us was the idea that because evolution is so gradual, its damn near impossible to even decide if a bone is homo sapien or another hominin. Bipedality (if I remember correctly) is supposed to be the point where chimps and what would end up being us diverged, but how do you decide that an organism was bipedal by just looking at a scrap of their femur? Even a skeleton won‚Äôt let you decide if the organism was a homo sapien or an earlier hominid. Point is, archeologists are always recategorizing the bones they find based on new technology and new finds. 

I think in general, there are a lot of misconceptions about evolutionary theory that contribute to outdated ideas about ‚Äúpast organisms.‚Äù Your question seems more rhetorical so you probably know all this anyway, but you reminded me of my past classes and got me all excited :)"
UCSantaBarbara,fpbrrbu,t3_gcg3ri,1588477086.0,"I think the main reason why this is so frustrating is because in order for them to be socially distancing (assuming they are just out there with their housemates which I know they are not necessarily) OTHER PEOPLE have to stay home. My mom pointed this out to me when I saw a photo of a couple at a park getting told off by a policeman and was originally like, ‚ÄúBut they are social distancing!‚Äù Yes, they might be technically be socially distancing, but that‚Äôs only because we all stayed home. 

I guess its better if those people without self-control can sit on a float in the ocean instead of traveling around to other cities? As a fourth year about to graduate, I feel incredibly sad that my last couple of months living thisclose to the beach near all my best friends for the last time ever has been ruined. All my friends are going to be in all different directions next year. I didn‚Äôt even go to Deltopia (or really do much in general) last year because I just thought, eh, I‚Äôll go next year. I‚Äôm NOT saying this is a good excuse, but maybe the empathy can help cool your frustration? A lot of beaches have been getting closed down anyways, so I guess we just have to hope that police/‚Äúthe people in charge‚Äù will know when enough is enough?"

FrugalFemaleFashion,fp7ar2o,t1_fp7896y,1588367121.0,"Haha I felt the same way about sending the stuff back to thredup! I knew the return policy going into it but thought I could figure everything out with their measurements (boy was I wrong haha) The reason I think they must be a little shady was a topshop dress I bought. Thredup said it had ‚Äúminor discoloration‚Äù and I bought it for only $3.50 ‚Äúon sale.‚Äù It had what looked like chemical burn marks all along the bottom of it, so bad there was no way I was wearing it out of the house. I can‚Äôt imagine someone selling it to them like that and them paying for it... 

I was lucky enough to sell most of the stuff I didn‚Äôt want/that didn‚Äôt fit from my order to an in-person consignment store called Crossroads for ALMOST the amount I paid for them. So, it pretty much worked out. But yes, i miss in-person thrifting so much üò¢"
femalefashionadvice,fp784y6,t1_fp7770e,1588365781.0,Good to know! I don‚Äôt usually anyways but I‚Äôll be extra careful not to now! Have you tried any of their other clothes?
FrugalFemaleFashion,fp72wrf,t1_fp6d5ja,1588363063.0,"One thing to be aware of with thred up is if you want to return something, theres a restocking fee plus shipping to return things. I personally have a hard time shopping on their website because its hard to picture (for me) what the clothes will look like (they are on a dress form but often wrinkled and rumpled). I‚Äôm also 5‚Äô1‚Äù which can be difficult haha. 

I‚Äôve also seen people on youtube talking about about how little they pay for the clothes people sell them. If you send in clothes to sell and they don‚Äôt want to buy them, you have to pay to get them sent back and if you don‚Äôt, they keep them and supposedly donate them. Maybe I‚Äôm just paranoid, but couldn‚Äôt they just say the clothes are unsellable and not pay you, then sell the clothes? There is SO much clothing on the website, it seems unlikely you would even know. I know we donate clothes to thrift stores, but those are non-profits and usually selling clothing for a flat rate like ‚Äú6 dollars for all tops‚Äù without regard for brand. It just feels shady to me.

I think a person who can afford to drop $20-30 on an item of clothing that might not fit but is a good brand could justify thredup, but $20-30 for me is practically an investment piece (I‚Äôm probably very spoiled by thrift stores in my area). Thredup might also be pretty good for people that don‚Äôt have good thrift stores around them and want to buy secondhand for environmental reasons. Other than that, it just seems over priced for little convenience."
femalefashionadvice,fp6zfa4,t3_gbm76k,1588361287.0,"I recently got the 2/$24 promo leggings from fabletics and I love them! I cancelled the membership shortly after because I just don‚Äôt need to be buying workout gear every single month. The promo was a STEAL, honestly. My favorite pair are the Trinity high waisted pocket capris. High compression, tight enough on the waist to run in, and have a giant pocket in the back I can stick my phone in. Extremely high waisted (past my belly button) I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô1‚Äù so they fit me like 7/8s. The other pair I got are the trinity high waisted pocket legging in army green. Despite being the same leggings except longer, they seemed tighter in the waist, which was weird. I still wear them, but have to roll them up bc they are too long. Love the color too. 

 I also have two pairs of lulus, one that I bought like two years ago that are holding up great (they are a more athletic fabric/high compression, not sure the style bc the tag is gone). However, I was really disappointed in the second pair I bought this December. I wanted a pair to lounge in so I bought one of their 7/8s yoga material pair. Very comfy but they literally pilled between my thighs the FIRST TIME i wore them. Like seriously? I air dry all my leggings but am almost scared to wear those second pair of lulus bc they were so damn expensive and I don‚Äôt want them to fall apart. I have a couple pair of lulu shorts and a sports bra. Great pieces but seriously overpriced. I like buying their shorts second-hand at consignment stores because I know the fabric doesn‚Äôt really wear out but I would never buy leggings (though I don‚Äôt buy leggings secondhand anyways bc of wear and tear)"
interestingasfuck,fp1jcmq,t1_fp1hqcn,1588237498.0,"Do you know anything about the effect on bird populations? I don‚Äôt mean to try to insinuate that strays=bad or that Istanbul is wrong or anything like that. Where I‚Äôm from, there‚Äôs a big push to spay/neuter and even abort kittens (which is heartbreaking to think about as a cat owner) primarily because large feral cat/stray cat populations just desecrate local bird populations. 

I wonder if maybe the problem with the birds doesn‚Äôt exist/isn‚Äôt as bad because there is a mindset to care for them, so maybe they don‚Äôt feel the need to hunt as much? Though the shelter that my cat is from warned me that cats hunt even when they aren‚Äôt hungry so I shouldn‚Äôt let my cat go outside on their own (among other reasons)..."

If you want that trendy loose fit, you can buy them from the men‚Äôs section too (I hate tight shorts and live where it gets REALLY hot). 

I recently saw some pretty cute longer cutoff shorts at Target too! Make sure to go up a couple of sizes though, the ones I tried on had zero stretch so I had to go up two sizes."

UCSantaBarbara,fkst1na,t1_fkscl2n,1584497726.0,"Congrats! I‚Äôm a fourth year PBS and Bio Anth double major. You can double major across colleges (my bf is a computer science and german major which crosses the letters and science/engineer colleges). I was not personally in the honors program but I know they have priority registration. 

I would say greek life is pretty prominent, but I was never in it and had no problems making friends, going to parties, etc.  The dorms were a great place to make friends and IM sports at the rec cen were great too (in case you are sporty). DP (del playa, a street) has random house parties that you can just walk into pretty much every weekend if that‚Äôs what you are worried about. We also have tons of clubs (I‚Äôm in two). 

As me anything about PBS :)"
