AskReddit,fp7hzfu,t3_gaolbl,1588370980.0,Is it worth studying for a non-essential career (ex. Lawyer or paralegal) for people who've recently graduated from college?
LawSchool,fp6mgtr,t1_fp6m5vp,1588354864.0,"Whoops, I should give context: I already have a BA, in history, with a Spanish minor, so this would be extra. What would you recommend then? I found some organizations to volunteer with thanks to a lawyer acquaintance a few months ago but never followed up on actually contacting those groups, and it's probably too late to do anything right now"
LawSchool,fp62llq,t3_g9ihxq,1588344886.0,I'm thinking of doing paralegal studies as an eventual gateway to law school so I can be an immigration lawyer. Is that a wise career path during this pandemic? And does working at a law firm entail sitting in an office all day? I know I wouldn't be satisfied physically at a job if I don't get to move around much.

backpacks,fnnuwrf,t1_fnns8dr,1587102477.0,How come it wouldn't work? Is it because the elastic is only strong because of the mesh?

Baking,fmputbd,t1_fmplpbd,1586287734.0,"Thanks so much for the info! I'll keep that in mind. I'd be starting with all purpose flour since that's all I have right now.

Since I don't have a stand mixer and will likely be mixing by hand (have an old hand mixer but it's annoyingly loud), how long would I have to mix? What about kneading? Would I have to knead constantly (fold?) for the duration of 8 minutes?

Regarding yeast, how warm would warm water have to be for active dry and instant yeasts since I don't have a special thermometer?"
Baking,fmpcvh0,t1_fmpbha6,1586278581.0,"How does it differ from kneading, say, a baking powder biscuit dough?"
