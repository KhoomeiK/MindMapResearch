UCSD,fp4m8js,t1_fp3a377,1588302133.0,I think we communicated on another forum regarding this class. Looks like we lucked out!

UCSD,fodlcy1,t3_g6uo8x,1587686126.0,The administration was pretty inconsiderate with winter 2020. They didn’t even allow professors to delay finals for a couple of days. The pass/ no pass option for winter 2020 grades would’ve been a rational response.
UCSD,fnx1yjd,t1_fnx0h7f,1587329883.0,"I think there’s a misunderstanding lmao. I had a thread yesterday that was attacked because of this subject. I basically predicted a chance that winter 2021 wouldn’t be in-person (with rational points) and I was vilified for predicting such a thing. I was agreeing with vizzom that there is a chance the campus wouldn’t be open for winter, people shouldn’t be freaking out about that point of view. I’m not arguing whether it should be open or not, I just forecasted a possibility. The future state of the virus remains unclear."
UCSD,fnw4bzd,t1_fnvdujq,1587311168.0,"Literally said the same thing the other day ago and got hated for it. Truth hurts, winter is the peak of the flu season. We all don’t know what to expect."
communitycollege,fnt4q3j,t3_g0as0e,1587234575.0,"Former CC student here (currently at UCSD), I would’ve felt guilty by not replying to this post. I was in the same position when I graduated in 2017, so I know the constant stress over this decision. Let me tell you, going to community college was probably the best decision I’ve made in my entire life. The moment I got there, I wanted to get out. I did my two years there and transferred with no debt. Those two years went by quick because I was motivated to get out on time. I made plenty of friends who had the same goals as me too. I would definitely encourage you to go to CC (especially if you want to go to grad school)."

UCSD,fn8mzks,t3_g0988x,1586745394.0,I had that problem when I was @ the village. They would normally get in my room because I would leave the window open lmao
UCSD,fmy2tlw,t1_fmvitze,1586476920.0,"Main reason why I dropped, most of the material is centered on social philosophy (complicated stuff). On top of that, the prompt on assignment #2 was just terrifying lmfao."
UCSD,fmwwmma,t3_fxvh19,1586454331.0,guess it’s time to max out on units for all summer sessions
UCSD,fmqacu1,t1_fmq5k9t,1586295878.0,"I ended up dropping his class right now, didn’t really have a good feeling considering the amount readings he’s already uploaded. Went with my gut."
