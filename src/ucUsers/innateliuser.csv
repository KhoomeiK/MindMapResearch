China_Flu,fooamyj,t1_foo8yjd,1587935634.0,Yeah I believe you. Was just trying to emulate her reaction based upon her other responses around this thread since I assume she doesn’t have the mental fortitude to defend herself further here.
China_Flu,foo8jkt,t1_foo7ew7,1587934586.0,"i’ll reply to you on her behalf in case she doesn’t revisit this thread:

you’re hilarious. you really are.
you’ve lost. just give up.

have a nice day /u/Tomatocakee ;)"
China_Flu,foo6usb,t1_foo4ohl,1587933650.0,"your response would hold water a lot better if your history of removed comments (which are very easily viewed using comment caching sites) didn't paint a painfully clear picture of your tendency to manipulate data to your own personal taste

you can't argue that you're an advocate for fair critique when you parse every thread you moderate with an obvious habit of skewing the narrative to how you see fit. it's unethical, it's unprofessional, and it's extremely unbecoming for someone who is supposed to have earned a PhD."
China_Flu,foo39k8,t1_foo13d5,1587931646.0,"it's a shame, that mod seems to genuinely promote helpful neutral content but at the same time goes absolutely ballistic with the policing about anything even remotely related to how the CCP could have maybe done a few things a tiny little bit better.

hey /u/JenniferColeRhuk what's in it for you? you seem to be reasonably intelligent and your helpful content suggests you aren't malicious, so what's your deal?"

berkeley,fnxlei8,t1_fnxjxph,1587341073.0,this kind of crayfish is native to louisiana and has been a crawfish boil staple for a while
berkeley,fnx1bf8,t1_fnx0bk0,1587329536.0,"iirc this species of crayfish is invasive and actually edges out dragonflies by eating their larval form and frogs by eating eggs and tadpoles

its identifying feature is the red bumps on its carapace and claws! the original  california native crayfish species look different and are much rarer"
berkeley,fnwyx48,t3_g4chtw,1587328187.0,if people are interested i can make a video on how to catch carol christ’s crazy crayfish
berkeley,fnwxkd8,t1_fnwx4jz,1587327424.0,"they exist on campus

PM me and i’ll tell you! don’t want to cause everyone to swarm them immediately...

edit: since they’re an invasive species it probably wouldn’t hurt to just outright say it - they really do live in the creek by carol christ’s chancellor house"
berkeley,fnwn4xf,t1_fnwmols,1587321570.0,yeah nice catch! really makes this crayfish look like a chonker
nintendo,fnusl7j,t3_g3ptch,1587269986.0,a family at the grocery store spared me a couple of the bananas they were buying since the store had just ran out :)
bayarea,fnev4sa,t1_fneu1xp,1586896399.0,"i’m really not telling you to tiptoe, i’m saying the terminology you’re consciously choosing to use is both wrong and dangerous and pointing out that you absolutely could choose to use a more direct and accurate description, yet choose to broadly include chinese americans who have had nothing to do with china their entire lives.

let’s take your biological warfare example and escalate it - what if this was a world war scenario? if this were ww2 and i said wow anyone of german-american descent must have enough ties with the fascist regime gripping germany at the time, would that be an appropriate, justified response?"
bayarea,fnesz2y,t1_fnestms,1586895309.0,"yeah, but circling back to the start of this conversation i hope you can see now that the way you word it can be harmful to the wrong people even if you don’t intend it"
bayarea,fneqp6v,t1_fnepqx3,1586894142.0,"props to you for actually posting it for a fair look at the conversation

but the way you initially called the chinese-american community unforgivable is painting with too broad a brush... “chinese nationals” could have been a better way to put it if you really didn’t intend to include americans who simply happen to be ethnically chinese"
bayarea,fneofcw,t1_fnen0jt,1586892984.0,"was referring to the comment above it, second comment in this overall chain"
bayarea,fnel88z,t1_fnejp11,1586891359.0,"if you didn’t delete it where’s your first comment in this chain

maybe before you point out any splinters in other peoples’ eyes consider dislodging the log in yours"
bayarea,fnei905,t1_fneh65x,1586889846.0,"when did i say that? the first of your comments which i replied to has been deleted, but you were basically saying that all chinese people and all chinese-americans are bad... and that is categorically untrue

also since there’s no mod comment it’s safe to assume you deleted your first comment to conceal its racist overtones. unless you have any racism to hide, why would you delete your comment?"
bayarea,fneg9t2,t1_fnef5ur,1586888835.0,"i got dragged by my shirt out of line in safeway yesterday and told to go back to china

pretty sure i can safely say i didn’t invent this problem

if you think federal legal action is a just measure during this crisis i’d like to thank your middle school history teacher for skipping the section on internment camps during ww2

broad action applied based on ethnic criteria wasn’t appropriate then, so it sure as hell isn’t appropriate now"
bayarea,fneeiyt,t1_fne8936,1586887946.0,"it becomes something i have to worry about when people are unable to look past my race to see my nationality (american)

if you see someone in your community who you think might be chinese based on their skin color, hair color, etc, how would YOU avoid conflating their ethnicity with their nationality?

does that help to explain why it’s a little dangerous to broadly assume chinese-looking individuals are CCP goons?"
bayarea,fne7irg,t1_fne1tnp,1586884426.0,as someone who looks east asian and has been accused of harming our state and our country in various ways since this pandemic started i would really urge you to be cautious in applying racist labels...
nintendo,fmmvvxn,t3_fw3qmv,1586213086.0,i love isabelle so much
OriAndTheBlindForest,fkfmnqn,t3_fi3yog,1584137813.0,I know this isn't directly helpful but I ended up plugging an Xbox One controller into my gaming pc and it runs perfectly (you can also sign in with your Xbox Live account)
