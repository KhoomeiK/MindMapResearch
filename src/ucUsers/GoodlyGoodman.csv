UCSantaBarbara,fpbh4op,t3_gcg3ri,1588469882.0,"I'm sorry but how do you propose somebody living in Isla Vista social distance? It's literally a ghetto, only the richest .1% can afford a single let alone their own house or apartment. Once you are already sharing everything, why not go to the beach together or whatever? So long as they are keeping their distance from other groups I don't see the problem."

fantasyfootball,fp58cu9,t1_fp0e9or,1588319862.0,"I imagine Bowden will be an RB in the same sense Kamara is an RB, basically splitting time between RB and WR. Plus Mayock has already referenced a wildcat redzone package for him."
movies,fp4nbw0,t1_fp4lhck,1588302827.0,You demand he martyr himself and rake him over the coals when he chooses to retain the ability to do good work rather than sacrifice his ability to do good by paying meaningless lip service to an issue he can't affect. The fact you can't perceive your own callousness really undermines whatever moral high ground you would otherwise have on the issue of human rights abuses by the Chinese government.
movies,fp4i6bz,t1_fp4fjzq,1588299585.0,Such a disingenuous bullshit argument. He's an athlete who uses his wealth and platform to address issues he knows and has experienced. You insist that by not sacrificing the wealth he earned and martyring himself at the altar of a cause he has no basis of understanding that all his voluntary good work is in fact based on greed? For someone supposedly championing the cause of innocent lives you show a shocking level of callousness toward your fellow citizens and their objectively good work.

UCSantaBarbara,fp1ejnt,t1_fp17t6d,1588232877.0,Both this and cheating would be *highly* unethical. One does not cancel out the other.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fp18xpn,t1_fp0r3jz,1588227833.0,There's actuality a term for that. People rising to their level of incompetence is called the Peter Principle.

nfl,foj7io3,t1_foit2bk,1587811470.0,"Having a loved one die from something unavoidable like cancer is fucking awful and infuriating and unfair and incomprehensible but when a loved one kills themself... that shit makes you hate yourself *and* the person who killed themself, which makes you hate yourself even fucking more. I honestly don't know whether having it acknowledged or ignored hurts more."

raiders,foj51sq,t1_foiu8xu,1587808665.0,"I honestly miss the days when we were losing, we were the most homer fan base ever, and we'd threaten to shank anyone who said anything negative about our guys. It's like we got over .500 and just decided to start hating our own team."
raiders,foirwi3,t1_foibg0j,1587795038.0,Lol

raiders,foiajqm,t3_g7ilta,1587782220.0,I'm watching the pff stream and they love it. Sounds like he's a Taysum Hill leaning more WR
raiders,fogmxb2,t1_fofrnv7,1587754610.0,OSU didn't match their corners to specific receivers. Arnett had a broken hand so he always played the right side where he'd have to use it less. So logically if the opposition believed him to be the weaker corner you'd think they would put their best guys against him.
raiders,foesymw,t1_foer7az,1587713693.0,"I have no problem with someone saying they would have preferred someone else or they think it was a reach. I have a problem with someone coming to our sub and saying everything the Raiders do is bad because we're shit. Should we throw open our arms to dolts, queefs, and donkies fans? Shut down Raiders fans when we tell them to fuck off when they come to our sub? Tell Raider's fans to stop flipping off other team's stadiums?"
raiders,foepekt,t1_foeoc5w,1587710357.0,"OK I agree with everything you just said but...

> I’ll give mayock the benefit of the doubt

The guy you are defending disagrees with you

> It’s been 15 years of atrocious football not sure why we keep giving people the benefit of the doubt

It doesn't even appear he likes the Raiders, thus the question, what is he even doing here?"
raiders,foenf15,t1_focefno,1587708606.0,After seeing how today went I'm gonna go ahead and say I was right on that ratio lol
raiders,foemjqt,t1_foejfvb,1587707871.0,How dare he blindly hate and crap on every move made by the organization. Criticism is good. But it's important to keep an open mind on all our picks and not just assume every pick is atrocious.
raiders,foeeimm,t1_foebp9f,1587701834.0,"Nope, he had a broken hand so he took the side of the field that required him to use that hand less. If anything opposing teams would have lined up their best receivers against him if they believed he was the weaker of the two corners."
raiders,foeddss,t1_foeakey,1587701105.0,Why are you even here bro? Just go away
raiders,foe22pt,t3_g6y8ur,1587694509.0,Fuck it let's take De'Andre Swift and form a fucking lethal two headed monster at RB

raiders,focc1x9,t1_foc7wyi,1587669550.0,"IMO people being over protective is more acceptable and less of a problem than the people who cry that their rights have been violated when they get told to stfu for saying one of our players is a piece of shit. I mean really, the ratio of ""this guy is shit and this is a shit pick"" to ""I would have preferred XYZ"" type comments tips way harder toward the shit talk. And a lot of the time even seemingly ""measured"" criticisms are spiced with pretty derogatory language."
raiders,foc7nd1,t1_fobudzy,1587668060.0,"Sure, I'd refer to the u/ICookTheBlueStuff comment above for the guide lines for acceptable criticism."
raiders,foc1da9,t1_fobnhr3,1587666021.0,This is the way
raiders,fobrvle,t1_foauw4m,1587662994.0,"There is no bill of sport's fans rights, it's up to each fandom to create their own culture and expectations of behavior. From a legal standpoint, yes you can say whatever you want and nobody is going to sue you for shit talking the 
Raiders. From a fan perspective, we have every right to exclude and shun anyone who has anything negative to say about our team. And that right there has *always* been the Raider Nation way. Anyone who doesn't like it should find another team."

AdviceAnimals,fnivl94,t1_fninhw8,1586987133.0,"Agreed, we should be taxing these multi billion dollar organizations and their owners at a much higher rate so we can use those resources for the common good. Unless you are suggesting that we socialize professional sports? I'm down to socialize public goods like health care and education but private entertainment industries? Fuck no."
asoiaf,fnfb1t2,t3_g1deai,1586904702.0,"One small note, I think the Dayne's official ""story"" is that Willa is Jon Snow's mother and Ashara had a stillborn daughter. Ned Dayne calls Jon Snow his milk brother because he believes his wet nurse, Willa, to be Jon's mother."
StarWars,fm9f59f,t3_ftuo8i,1585867464.0,Why is it empire themed though? Is there like a good guy soldier on the other side?
