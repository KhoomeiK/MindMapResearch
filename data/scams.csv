bobem19,enwmfl,top_level,"My mom made a profile on Our Time in the summer of 2019. My dad passed away in April of 2019 so she was innocently looking for some companionship, nothing serious.

Fast forward to today and she has been in an online relationship with a man for nearly 5 months and it wasn’t until today that my sister and I became absolutely convinced that he is a scammer.  This guy claims he is an architect doing consulting work in Malaysia but his home base is Houston, Tx (where my mom lives). He always tells her he will be on his way back to the states but last minute ends up not being able to come back.

She claims he has never asked her for money BUT he had her log into his bank account and transfer funds to another account for him. He claims he couldn’t access his account because he is in Malaysia. She just told my sister and I this today and said it so casually and I just absolutely had it and told her she had to stop talking to him immediately. She doesn’t seem to think it’s odd that he gave a stranger on the internet his bank account information! 

My sister looked up his phone number on Spokeo and it wasn’t registered to his name and was also listed as a land line. This still didn’t convince my mom that she’s being played.

Also, she says they have FaceTimed before and he matches the pictures he has sent her. 

Has anyone ever heard of a similar situation? I’ve read many posts about women sending thousands of dollars to scammers but none of a scammer actually having them log into their account to transfer money. It seems like he could be getting my mom involved in some illegal activity. We have been trying all day to come up with some kind of hard evidence that this guy is not legit but haven’t had any luck. Any advice is appreciated!

MAJOR UPDATE: I just so happened to contact a Facebook group that exposes scammers and they just got back to me with hard evidence that the man my mom has been talking to is 100% a scammer. They gave me the name of the man whose photos he was using and verified the phone number he is using is a free voicemail number. I truly appreciate everyone’s input here and hope my mom is ok after all of this.

UPDATE #2: just got off the phone with my sister and my mom and we found out she has sent this guy her entire savings account over the course of 3 months. I am absolutely sick to my stomach and did not think this was going to be the outcome. Any advice here is appreciated. I’m at a loss for words, I had hope that it hadn’t gotten to this point yet but was sadly wrong. I feel angry and guilty that I even allowed her to talk to him for this long.

It turns out he wasn’t having he transfer money between accounts, I’m not sure why she told us that. He gave her a story that he has a heart condition and even had a “doctor” call her to convince her to send more and more money. The bank account he gave her was completely fake and just a way to “show” her he would pay her back. I’m just sick."

It's an incredibly common romance scam. [Here](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/02/has-online-love-interest-asked-you-money?page=25) is another account of the same scenario, CTRL + F for ""his bank account"". 

> It seems like he could be getting my mom involved in some illegal activity

Yes, she committed bank fraud. The banking information doesn't belong to the scammer, it was stolen."
bobem19,fe5zdr1,t1_fe5z4td,Thank you. I’m really worried about her and scared for her and my sister and I are doing everything possible to make sure none of this continues.

I’m possible overreacting or assuming, but she might want to report that to someone at a federal level.  If she’s moving money for some shady corporation, or worse terrorists, she obviously needs to full stop and report it before it goes any further.

Or less dramatic, he’s just using stolen bank login info to get money into his account."
bobem19,fe5yyw7,t1_fe5yb9r,"The only information she gave us was that she had seen his bank account before and we immediately were like why? And she said because he asked me to log into his account and transfer money to another account because he can’t log in while in Malaysia. Obviously, this is complete BS. I actually work for a wealth management firm and if this guy is as wealthy as he claims and is in a bind he must have people who would be able to help him other than a woman who he has never met.

PurpleSunCraze,fe60ffg,t1_fe5yyw7,"You’ve got your work cut out for you.  She’s very likely lonely and that’s going to cloud her judgement and logic, but I would still attempt to use that to explain it to her.  People don’t need help logging into bank accounts and even if they did they don’t have friends on dating websites do it, they use family and trustworthy, long established friends.  

Have her tell him no, make up a reason, not important, see what he says.  In the wildly unlikely possibility that he’s legit he’ll understand, if he doesn’t she’ll know if he cares more about bank transfers or her."

Dial_up_Knight,fe6s46i,t1_fe6bl27,"That's 100 percent the case.  It's a common thing they do.  Even if he is unable to convince her to send him any of her money he'll continue to use her to transfer the money so it looks like she is doing it.  Luckily the Feds are aware of these scams and don't normally go too hard on the person being fooled, but it's still a whole mess she won't want to deal with after the stress of losing her husband.  Ideally she will come around and listen to her children otherwise she's going to have to believe a federal agent."

She just asked my sister and her husband for a $10k loan to pay off a credit card that hasn’t been paid since before my dad passed away and immediately this didn’t sit well with us. My sister and her husband are not cutting her a check directly, my sisters husband is going to call the credit card company himself after my mom gives him access to the account. It’s just odd if she is sending this guy money because A) she doesn’t make a lot of money and B) she is currently living off of worker’s compensation. I’m talking to her tomorrow and will hopefully have much clearer information from her and convince her to stop all communication with him."
lowenkraft,fe6brac,t1_fe6ao7r,"Could reporting to the police as well be an option?

If they pay off her card she could then use her available credit on cash advances or gifts for scammer.  So you might still be giving her money to give to the scammer, just indirectly."

mylifethefiasco,fe6j794,t3_enwmfl,"Ah..... I feel for you...  my mom got roped into one as well...   80k later and I continually find gift cards, receipts, and when she isnt around her phone look at her texts..... google hangouts is a bad one.  I have gone so far now as I have alerted every store that she goes to to not sell her cards anymore and alert me if she tries... because who in the hell sends money through iTunes cards.... she cant figure out the remote let alone the apple iTunes platform and I'm being honest.... Her memory is not what it used to be.....I have control of the finances as well... shes pissed at me but I dont want her to loose everything my dad worked soo hard for and see her on the streets cause she got swindled from some piece of shit scammer....."
bobem19,fe6jkmc,t1_fe6j794,"Wow, I’m really sorry you went through this and are still going through it. See, my mom doesn’t even have $80k to blow, so I’m hoping either she hasn’t sent him any money at all YET or she’s sent him a very small amount. We are hopefully putting an end to this tomorrow and getting to the bottom of it once and for all. I’ll post an update once my sister and I talk to her tomorrow."
mylifethefiasco,fe6k3na,t1_fe6jkmc,Look out for Google hangouts app on her phone and thanks it's been a struggle this past year.... found out she was lying and still talking to the bastards and giving them money and its money she cant afford to spend.......  Hang in there theres gonna be alot of hurtful words and feeling thrown at you for butting into thier affairs but they dont realise you are trying to help.    Dont let the shit get to you..... itll drive you crazy otherwise

Pjstjohn,fe629rh,t3_enwmfl,"There’s not much you can do here. He’s using her emotions and anything you say she will refuse or explain away. Hopefully your mom doesn’t get locked up or taken for all she is worth.

You can try to educate her about romance scams, but that rarely works. If at all possible take away access to her money. Don’t give her any. Try and keep your mum out of jail and start saving for a lawyer cuz you’re gonna need one."
allthebuttons,fe6zsbm,t3_enwmfl,"Having her transfer money might have also been a test or a type of “grooming” to see how much she is willing to do for him and get her used to sharing bank account info. If he shares his info he can guilt her into sharing hers as well. If she’s willing to move money around maybe in a couple months she will be willing to send him money. 

Five months is a long investment into scamming someone. Having her move some money around isn’t going to be the end goal for him. 

You might want to consider talking to a lawyer in case you need to protect your mom from herself. You could possibly show she is not in the right mind to handle her own finances if she is in fact sending him money."

exfamilia,fe6g1sg,t3_enwmfl,"Dr Phil.

He's done a few programs on international romance scams, you can find them on Youtube. And there's a certain type of woman of a certain age who can never be made to see the truth when it's from friends or family, but will lap up all he says.

For all his showmanship and questionable motives, he is a pretty cluey fellow, and with this kind of scamming—he's on it like a duck on a june bug. And he knows exactly how to talk to those older ladies to make them see sense."

bobem19,fe6f5f8,t1_fe6esxq,"This is great advice, thank you! I’m not sure if I updated the post correctly but I now have hard evidence that she is being scammed and plan to report it."
Ballistic_86,fe6flb7,t3_enwmfl,"Sounds like you already have the info you need. Just wanted to add, a co-worker of mine also fell for a romance scam from a “sugar daddy” website. This guy had her log into a bank account and transfer money/take money. The accounts she accessed was most likely stolen and she was targeted into accessing this account and transfer money out of it. This is a way for the scammer to take money out of a purchased bank account with no culpability. Technically, your mother committed the crime, not the scammer. 

I would suggest attempting to stop her, but she will most likely keep it going. Once she has knowledge of her actions being criminal in nature, she might be on the hook for future activity. This is how I stopped my co-worker, as she didn’t want to believe she was a participant in a scam."
bobem19,fe6g5i0,t1_fe6flb7,"Thank you. I’m definitely freaking out about her doing any kind of transfers for this guy.

Dial_up_Knight,fe6rvuw,t3_enwmfl,"Aw man.  This sucks.  I worked with a guy in the exact same situation.  His wife died and then this happened.  I spent a couple years scam baiting, pranking and otherwise wasting their time in funny ways, and when I would try to gently imply he was being scammed it would be met with anger. 

He even went as far as to use vacation time to pick her up from the airport and kicked his brother in law out of his house to make room for her, after he promised his wife he'd care for her brother after she was gone.  I'm not sure how that ended for him as when I quit that job it was still on going.  

These people make me so angry!"

9021SomeRandomPerson,fe8qlpq,t3_enwmfl,"Sorry, OP.

Those updates went from bad to super worse with each one.

You may be able to try to reverse them (as in bait him for the possibility of new $, and scam them out of their money in that account), but it would be an r/ULPT or **downright illegal**;  I’d try to at least file a police report or possibly notify higher authorities.  I doubt they can do anything because she willing “gave” him money, but you may want to consider posting on r/legaladvice.

I wouldn’t try to do this yourself, there are some kind people here somewhere to be helpful.

So sorry.

Edit: Reading through the comments...this makes more sense, bank fraud, money laundering...this situation is pretty bad.

👉🏻Please consider consulting a lawyer before doing anything.👈🏻"
bobem19,fe8reuf,t1_fe8qlpq,"Thank you. We are going to report it accordingly but we do know nothing can be done to get her money back.

I mostly feel like I failed her by not talking to her about him enough or pressing her enough about it. I live in another state so it’s different talking over the phone and not being able to see body language. I just hope this post can help a lot more people who may be going through this as well.

Edit: the bank account he gave her was fake. I don’t know why she told us he was having her move money around, possibly just to make us believe further she wasn’t giving him money."
9021SomeRandomPerson,febi6x8,t1_fe8reuf,"Sorry, OP, and so sorry to your mom.

You’re a good child to care enough to try to help her; at least maybe this can be a cautionary tale to some and help those who may read or be able to recognize it for people they may know.

It would be heartbreaking to be trying to be altruistic to someone you thought loved you only for them to mess up your future; I don’t see how people can do things like this.

I hope things can get better for you and your mom."
bobem19,febjnh4,t1_febi6x8,Thanks so much. We are doing our best to make sure she moves on from this in a healthy way and that it never happens to her again.
smellygymbag,fe6rv7t,t3_enwmfl,"Hey check your mom hasnt shared any account info with him. Maybe he was grooming her to be as ""trusting"" as he is. Maybe even contact her bank or financial whatevers as a heads up if shes not cooperating. I heard (on reddit) banks sometimes have special procedures or people to protect their customers."
imagine_amusing_name,fe8mklh,t3_enwmfl,"Basically your MOTHER just transferred money from a stolen account into this guys account.  If IP addresses are checked by the bank, your mother is going to be in SERIOUS legal trouble as an accomplice to theft and fraud.

You 100% NEED to contact that bank ASAP before they bring charges or even potentially file to have your mother extradited to face trial.

If this scammer has done this a lot, the bank MAY decide to go with ""she's his partner in crime and has done this more than once""...."
bobem19,fe8n4r7,t1_fe8mklh,"Please read update 2. The account was fake and she didn’t transfer any money for him because she was unable to, he just asked her to so he could show her he “has money” and would pay her back for everything she sent him."
imagine_amusing_name,fe981xm,t1_fe8n4r7,"Ah. so he's ""building trust"" right before he asks her for money.

malachaiville,fe9bbvf,t3_enwmfl,"I'm so sorry this happened to you and to your mother.  Now that you've uncovered the evidence that it was definitely a scam, you'll need to talk to your sister about how to move forward in protecting your mom, and possibly caring for her directly if she cannot afford to live on her own.  Such a sad and infuriating situation.  I'm glad you guys were able to catch on before she lost her home."
bobem19,fe9dd8t,t1_fe9bbvf,"Thank you. We are currently starting with having her report it to her bank and we will file reports with the appropriate authorities. We are planning to set up my sister and myself as POA over her and potentially monitor her accounts. My sister and her husband will be helping her get out of credit card debt and sell her house, we hope the sale of the house will get her back most of the money she lost. You’re right, she lost her entire savings but we caught it before she lost anything else so that’s something."
malachaiville,fe9riri,t1_fe9dd8t,"First of all, I'm sorry for the loss of your father -- that just compounds the issue as she is (as you said) lonely and just looking for companionship.  If she accepts now that this is a scam that she fell for, she'll likely be extremely embarrassed and humiliated.  The Dr. Phil videos someone below suggested may be helpful for her to watch, so she knows she is definitely not alone in being preyed upon like this.  I know this isn't the forum for discussing eldercare necessarily but I'll just toss out ideas that popped in my head to help her emotionally -- grief counseling especially after being widowed, senior centers in her area for making (real-life) friends, social activities she can be signed up for so she meets new people that way, if she's selling her house and moving into a possible senior living community that would be great for socialization too.  

(If she's defiant that it wasn't a scam, you may need to get her physician involved for mandated therapy of some kind.)  

From a protective standpoint, you may want to set up some sort of monitoring on her internet usage as well, a net-nanny sort of situation, if possible.  The POA may or may not be required for this depending on how accepting she is of help right now.  I haven't personally investigated this so I'm not sure. It may be an app you can just install on her phone/computer/tablet and monitor from afar.  The /r/technology and /r/techsupport subreddits may be able to help you more with this sort of thing if you want to go that route.  Best of luck to you and your family as you navigate through this."
bobem19,fe9tf6c,t1_fe9riri,"Thanks very much for your advice. She is definitely humiliated and we are doing our best to be as supportive as possible but we are also very upset. We have been trying to get my mom to counseling since my dad passed because not only did he pass away but he died in the house and then my mom’s brother passed away a few days after my dad. After this mess, she has agreed to find a therapist this week because she understands this is something that will affect her mental health on top of her already grieving. I’m not going to allow her to continue on without seeing a therapist and also joining a support group for scam victims."
malachaiville,fe9wnsc,t1_fe9tf6c,"Oh man, that is a lot of trauma in a short amount of time.  I'm so sorry.  Thank goodness she is agreeable to therapy -- you're a good daughter to be on her about this."
nimble2,fe9d0p9,t3_enwmfl,">she has sent this guy her entire savings account over the course of 3 months … The bank account he gave her was completely fake and just a way to “show” her he would pay her back.

It's not likely that the scammer had her transfer money using a method that can be traced, but on the off chance that he did, how EXACTLY did she transfer money to the scammer.  For example gift card codes and Western Union cannot be traced, but Zelle and CashApp can be traced.

If she transferred money in a way that can be traced, then she either transferred that money directly to the scammer or (more likely) to a witting or unwitting money mule.  Irrespective of whether she transferred her money directly to the scammer or to a money mule, she can use the legal system to trace the transfer and try to get her money back.  It's a difficult process, and there is no guarantee of success, but depending on how much money was transferred via a traceable method, it might be worth it to try."
bobem19,fe9e3qu,t1_fe9d0p9,"She told us she wired money from her two bank accounts at two different banks, she never went to a Western Union. She is currently at one of those banks telling them what happened, she has all of her receipts from the transactions. Although the banks will likely not be able to recover any of her money, they will at least know what happened and can hopefully prevent this from happening to someone else."
nimble2,fe9ktob,t1_fe9e3qu,"Your are correct that her bank will probably not be able to reverse the transfers.  But the good news is that she can find out who owns the bank accounts that she transferred her money to, and she can sue them to try and recover her money from them.

In a nutshell, here is the process:  She would need to file a civil lawsuit in a local court that allows subpoenas (probably not a small claims court).  She could name the defendant as John Doe, and she could allege unjust enrichment or fraud by deception (her exact cause of action would depend on her State laws).  Then she would have to send subpoenas to the two different banks that she transferred her money to (identified by the routing numbers that she made the transfers to), asking them to provide her with the name, the address, and the SSN of the owner of the account number that she transferred her money to.  Then she would amend her complaint to name that person as the defendant (and file a second case if the two accounts that she transferred her money to are not owned by the same person).  Then she hopes to get a judgment against the defendant(s).  Then she garnishes the defendant's bank account.

Again, note that she could have transferred her money to a witting or unwitting money mule, but that doesn't matter in an unjust enrichment case.  She want's her money back from the party that she sent her money to (the person who was ""unjustly enriched"" at her expense).  If that party was scammed by someone else (because they sent some of that money to someone else), then that party can sue whomever scammed them...

EDIT: Sorry, I thought you said that she wired money **TO** two different bank accounts.  But maybe you meant that she wired money **FROM** two different bank accounts (of hers) to only one bank account (that would be a little easier to deal with)."
bobem19,fe9li9c,t1_fe9ktob,"This is very helpful information I really appreciate it, I’ve saved screenshots of this so we can potentially take this action once we decide how we are going to move forward."
bobem19,fe9lyg7,t1_fe9ktob,"Yes, sorry I may have been unclear - she wired money TO the scammer FROM the two bank accounts she has. She has already been to one of the banks and alerted them that she is a victim of a scam but all they were able to do right now is alert their wire fraud department. Regardless, I appreciate the advice."
lawgeek,fearec2,t1_fe9ktob,"Do you know whether state or agency prosecutions typically aim for restitution? I can see why a civil suit would be the best approach, but I would think that reporting it to the FBI, FTC, and/or state AG would also be a good strategy. I could see big jurisdictional issues that would create problems in a civil suit, but a criminal action (or even a civil enforcement action) might have additional tools at their disposal. Of course, that would be a long shot, too (even just getting them to prosecute a presumably foreign defendant). But if the money is in a bank account and that bank has domestic assets, it's a lot more plausible than the majority of scams we see here.

I'm not well versed in this area of law (outside one law school clerkship) so I appreciate any corrections. If you know organizations doing pro bono or outreach, let me know, as I would like to get more involved. I've been thinking of putting together some workshops in my community to help educate vulnerable populations, but if there are groups already doing it, no reason to invent the wheel."
nimble2,fe9mp0v,t1_fe9li9c,"When it comes time, post back and I can give you some more suggestions on what to look into or how to approach this from a legal perspective.  I cannot offer legal advice, but just some pointers as to how to approach the issue.  If you know an attorney, then you can run some of this by them, but understand that most attorneys will not know anything at all about these kinds of scams, or money mules, or unjust enrichment, or subpoenas, or trial litigation, or how to collect a judgment.  So if you have to pay an attorney to learn any of those things, then it can quickly become prohibitively expensive."
nimble2,febi1hx,t1_fearec2,"The issue is that it is VERY difficult to convince any authority to actually do any kind of investigation - even if you can say ""I transferred money to this routing and account number"".  And then even if you can convince any authority to actually investigate - let alone take action, it's very unlikely that they will be trying to obtain ""restitution"" for victims (that's just not their focus)."
lawgeek,fecfycf,t1_febi1hx,"I figured, thanks for the clarification. My experience is with an agency that only does civil action for restitution, but it would also be very difficult getting them to take any one case. 

I think it might be worth reporting, though. If someone is looking to prosecute a scam like this,  a case with traceable cash might be appealing."
mrGusbrutal,fe9tk68,t3_enwmfl,"My mother in law is having this situation as well and fell in love with this person and was brainwashed to give her social and open accounts under her name and info which she now realized it's a scam after sending stuff to Nigeria as well .she's so upset and was threatened to release her nudes and info to her contact list .

bobem19,fe9ujd8,t1_fe9tk68,"I’m so sorry you are going through this as well, it’s absolutely devastating how common it is and how it happens to people who are not dumb or incompetent in the least bit. This is still very fresh for us but I can tell you you’ve done exactly what you should have so far. Be as supportive to her as possible, she is likely absolutely humiliated and probably feels like she will never get over it.

bobem19,fea0jr1,t1_fe9zkuq,"Thanks. I found it distressing as well but didn’t want to judge her. She had gone on real dates with real men so everything seemed fine until this. I just wish I would’ve had better intuition when she told me she was talking to this guy. 

She definitely didn’t want us to know she was sending him money so was hiding that at all costs. The only bright side is we caught her in her lies before she lost everything like her house and car. It will be a long road to building trust back."
gouf78,feanxn0,t3_enwmfl,"Best advice is for siblings to stay in touch and be aware if she asks for money. Doesn’t matter the reason.   Cut her off totally.  The answer is no.  It sounds awful but necessary. 

Right now I don’t know a way to convince her.  

We went through local police friends (with personal visits). attorneys, personal friends, family, facts (Internet findings that the person didn’t exist with photos and everything) to no avail.  All were the enemy.  

Presently it seems to be okay but then there is no cash flow whatsoever so that may be the reason.   And no money left anyway.  
We’ve been dragged over the coals as uncaring family members.  That’s pretty much the entire family. Now no contact from us.

PSA:   NEVER EVER let a loved one put their status in Facebook as widow.  It’s an open invitation to this crap."
bobem19,feaoxns,t1_feanxn0,"Thanks. We seem to have convinced her that she was scammed but we can’t tell if she still believes the guy is real and in love with her. We blocked his number from her phone and told her she needs to tell us immediately if he attempts to contact her via email or another phone number. Will she do this? No idea. I’m hoping I will be able to log into her email and monitor it. She also has no money left to send him.

I’m sorry you went through this situation as well, it’s devastating and I’m sick over it."
gouf78,feaubvq,t1_feaoxns,"I’m so sorry this is happening to you. It’s torn us apart. 

Hopefully you have the ability to curtail the activity.  Monitor what you can.  Think outside the box though beyond physical cash.  

Don’t think there’s no money left.  It’ll be —sell the car (I’ll buy you  a new one). Put a mortgage on the house.   

I know that sounds way beyond reason but believe me it is not for your loved one."
bobem19,feax0gc,t1_feaubvq,"Those are great points and we are doing everything possible to make sure it does not get to that point. From what she has told us she has only lost her savings thus far, I’m seeking advice on monitoring her activity and getting myself and my sister POA over her."
gouf78,feb001l,t1_feax0gc,"Do it soon. NOW. 
I’m just saying from experience—DO NOT believe what your loved one is saying about how finances are being handled. Don’t believe they’ve  cut contact. Just don’t swallow it. Any of it.  It can get worse VERY fast.  

Be the defense for her.  Take it over now if you can. Cut off any way she sends money.  Tell the siblings.  It’s NOT easy but so necessary.  


This isn’t the time to be nice and worry about her feelings.   And it sucks big time I know. 
BUT if you love her then just do it and then live through the aftermath.  It’s worth it."

msfvenomm,fe7t4xg,t3_enwmfl,"The bank transfer part is really fishy. Considering they haven’t even known each other for even a year, him giving your mom his bank info is really suspicious. 

He is most likely trying to use your mom as a mule so he doesn’t get caught. In that case you can ask your mom to be more cautious with the guy. If he asks your mom to make more bank transactions, you need to stop your mom right then. Cuz I’m assuming your mom isn’t using a VPN or any sort of proxy to make those transactions, in that case, your mom can suffer a jail time for helping in money laundering.

I hope this helps, if you need more help about this, just PM me and I’m more than happy to help. Good luck!"
hot_cheese83,fe95n6n,t3_enwmfl,"Oh no, that’s awful. I’m so sorry. 

I used to investigate this type of thing and, unfortunately, your bank may be able to retrieve some of the money, but that’s pretty rare. If they can, it’s likely to be only a fraction of what’s been lost. In terms of what law enforcement can do, in my experience even if they can identify a suspect, they’re likely to be in a jurisdiction that won’t cooperate. I can’t suggest much other than report it to the bank and to Law Enforcement and make sure that any remaining funds, including her house if she owns it) are safe. 

I can understand feeling angry and guilty, although you shouldn’t feel guilty. I’m sure you know this already but your mum is likely to need a lot of support. Something like this can have a really bad impact on her confidence and independence and she’ll need a lot of help to get over it as best she can."

AutoModerator,fdm3jup,t1_fdm3jtf,"AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the fake check scam. The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (online or in real life), you deposit a check and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards, Western Union, or cash). The bank will take the initial deposit back in anywhere from a week to a month, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam.

catddict,embwa2,top_level,"Like the title says. I was scammed using the old printer toner fake merchant scam. 

It was a busy day at work and the front desk calls me and tells me the printer merchant is on the line asking about our printers.

A little out of the ordinary but I tell them to transfer them to me. As soon as the call connects the lady starts talking about how she’s with the printer contracting service and needs our current make and model. Then says we have a rebate that’s going to expire by the end of the year if I don’t use it right now for free toner.

Immediately I was confused and told them I’ll call them back. Fast forward to a couple days later and I never actually called my printer contracting service because I had more pressing things at the time and the same lady called again saying they shipped the toner without me actually telling them too and where they should send the invoice? Luckily, I actually didn’t know where the invoices get sent too. Definitely not to our facility, so I told her idk and she said she would send it to the same place as the toner and hung up on me.

For some reason I felt uneasy about the whole thing and  I called the number on our printers and spoke to my real printer contracting service where they informed me I had just been scammed and to refuse delivery of the toner package so I wouldn’t be responsible for it and to disregard any toner invoices to our facility because they send them to HQ on the other side of the country. 

Is it that easy? Just refuse delivery?"

Their whole ""game"" is:

a) Try to send shitty over priced toner, invoice and get paid. This is the best case scenario.b) Invoice you anyhow, threaten to sue (they have a great boiler plate letter of all the ""court costs and fees you'll have to pay"") and get you to just pay the invoice anyhow.

I'm not saying they WILL file suit, and even if they DID it probably wouldn't pass the laugh test.

It will go on about how the average cost of small claims court, legal fees, etc., etc. is $1527 (made up number) and it's in your best interest to pay the $400 invoice and $75 late fee now before this goes any further.

This often works as the payables department says ""just pay the $475 to make them go away""

Its the **THREAT** of the lawsuit, not an actual filing."
lawgeek,fdozaey,t1_fdo93ar,"Indeed we do. I guess they're counting on the person they reach not knowing the law, or maybe they don't know the law.

Technically, you are probably free and clear if they have no order or other authorization to send you supplies, but small companies probably don't have an in-house legal team to take the fight to them.

I got hit with this when I took over IT duties at a small company. They were trying to sell us seriously overpriced ""Jumbo"" toners.

Lets assume for a minute this wasn't an outright scam, and the sender really is going to 'edit the account'.

No account rep has the legitimate authority to set a clients account balance at 10x its current value. The only way they could be doing this is outright embezzlement/fraud. So, \_even if\_ the sender actually did such a thing the money would be traced when the source company detects the fraud and the receiver would be up on charges as an accessory. Though there's no danger of that as it is a scam and the person is absolutely not a WU merchant banker.

This reminded me of a scam I'd heard about before but instead of clothing, it was makeup brushes so I decided to do a little research.  I found that the website's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy pages were obviously copy-pasted (they forgot to change the store name in the ToS, and they left in a section talking about CDs and DVDs in the Privacy Policy).  I also googled one of their pictures and found the actual clothing store they stole all their pictures from.  I wasn't able to find any reviews but that's probably because the website was created recently.  Anyone who ordered from this site is either gonna get shitty quality items after a long ass amount of time or just not receive their orders at all.

1. If they are way hotter than you normally meet in person or interact with be mindful, maybe you’re lucky, maybe it’s a scam.

2. If they are immediately trying to arrange a meet up or have sex be wary.

3. If they try to switch platforms on you (IG, Facebook, texting etc) they are most likely scamming. Don’t change platforms unless you are confident this person is a real person.

4. If they are asking for money of any kind or gift cards to meet up they are going to take your money and block all contact, you won’t get laid.

5. If they are immediately trying to swap risky pics they are probably going to try to extort you.

6. If they say they are of age then tell you they’re not, this is a scam and a scary one. Block all contact and report it to the police.

7. Lastly, be mindful of what you’re doing and what information you’re giving out. Ask yourself if this interaction makes sense or if you are walking into a trap.

And even if you did, you’re anywhere from 10-12 and a half hours in a different time zone than the States. And most American service members aren’t going to be going out of their way to date a European. The time delay right there precludes any successful hunting for the most part.

This of course is out the window for European servicemen/woman."
CatLadyGrip,fdzmm2t,t1_fdzjgq8,"Maybe it would help to not have pics of yourself in uniform on your profile and wait until you've talked a bit before you mention that. 

The scammers I talked to who posed as deployed military all worked the same angle: They said they were actually from a town near me but were deployed overseas (usually Afghanistan/Iraq) for the next 6-8 months. Then they'd launch into your typical Nigerian love scam story. Lots of pet names and gushy bullshit about looking for a loyal woman, sure I love doing all the same things you do, yadda yadda yadda. Setting me up to start the pleas for money. Oh baby I'm broke and need food. I need to get home but need a travel permit fee/plane ticket. I need money for ______. ""Oil rig workers"" used the same story, just replace ""deployed"" with ""on the platform"".

One ""military man"" took all of 2 hours to hit me up for $100 for ""food and expenses"".

Having spent some time scambaiting maybe 10 years ago I knew all that was crap, I had some fun chatting them up when I was bored and then when I got tired of stringing them along I'd throw questions at them like what's your MOS and what's the oilfield and platform name then watch them squirm and babble and try to lie their way out of the snare. 

Their English usually gets pretty bad when they're pissed off. 😂"

CatLadyGrip,fdzpsxn,t1_fdznhyp,"From talking to different guys on POF I noticed they get different scam stories than we do. You dudes get the fake hot chicks that are actually porn site bots and people posing as the ""damsel in distress"" or the DTF let's go right now story. 

We women get the fake military/oil rig worker/charity worker, all somewhere overseas but they're supposedly from near where we live. 

Some are really easy to spot with their broken English, poor spelling and lack of knowledge about minutiae of American life. Like I'd throw in a line about hanging out with my cousins Bo and Luke in our town of Hazzard, Kentucky and they never picked up on that. I'm in Kentucky so they bought it. 

The way to find out if you're talking to a bot is to pay attention to how fast they respond and if their answers really match up to your questions. Like if they reply to you with a full paragraph answer in 2 seconds or if you ask them if they like beer or wine and they reply with ""Cool"" or something else that isn't a real answer. One way to trip up a bot is to type up a string of random nonsense characters in your reply. Like I'd answer a question with khdtjbgo and if they said something like ""That's great"" when I did that, it's a chat bot. A person sees khdtjbgo and asks what that was. So I'd say I dropped my phone or my cat stepped on it. 😆"

If you get a date, it's always late at night cos they are too cheap to buy you dinner (doesn't matter if you are willing to pay ur share) n claim they have something going on earlier so have to do within their time.

Someone called claiming to be with the police and that her grandson got pulled over and had drugs in the car and if she didn't get 1800$ in Visa giftcards that he would be going to jail. She went out and got the cards and gave them the codes and they thanked her for her care and would be releasing him from custody. They later called back and said unfortunately they had given her an incorrect number, they needed 1500$ more in eBay gift cards. Since she had no idea what eBay giftcards were, she said she would get them and call back when she got them. She called my cousin (32) and he said he didn't know which of her 6 grandchildren it was and called me for info. I immediately knew this was a scam and called her

She said she was under oath and couldn't tell me any information until Friday. I pleaded with her that it was a scam and even told her what they probably said, but she said she wanted to call the scammers to make sure.  Finally after getting a lot of friends to tell her on 3 way calls, she believed and now feels ashamed. I told her shes going to be getting calls like this telling her shes going to go to jail if she doesn't pay or they will take the house or from the IRS and to please contact me if it happens again and she agreed.

I told her firmly it’s a scam! Told her not to answer the call and to block the number. 

She was so scared she answered another call and was texting me during it telling me what they were saying. I had her call me on 3 way while they were on the line and I was listening to that scum try to threaten and scare her. It took everything in me not to light into him and tell him where he can go. So we were texting back and forth as the scam went on and I told her “girl just hang up and call me.” So she did and I had to try hard to convince her that the IRS doesn’t work that way. I got her calmed down then I went to the IRS website and pulled an article about scams and sent it to her. That finally got her to realize how stupid the scammers are. 

Those creeps use fear and a sense of urgency to bully unsuspecting people into falling for this mess. Tell your grandmother to please not feel bad. It’s not an insult to her intelligence at all. They just know exactly which buttons to push to get otherwise rational thinking people to crack."

brownieinthebin,elctdz,top_level,"So, I've been in the market for a job. I have responsibility in two different places so I've been looking for a remote job. I started looking on remote websites and have come across a company called CarolineLaBass Health Care based in Aurora, CO. The offer was for a virtual assistant position at $25/hr and $20 per hour for training. It appears to be a company that does elderly care. There is a website and an address and many many many job postings for virtual assistants and the like on many job sites. I think there's even some on non-remote websites asking for RNAs etc. However, when you go onto the company's website, all you see is stock photos and generic reviews from people with fake names like ""Jennifer J."", ""John D."", and ""Jane S."" Any sort of elderly care company's website that you go to has pictures of ACTUAL people at the ACTUAL place and ACTUAL testimonials.

 [https://carolinelabasshealthcare.com/](https://carolinelabasshealthcare.com/) 

Anyway, on the job website that I went to, it instructed me to apply by sending my resume to an email address and saying that I was interested in the position. Kinda weird, but okay. So I did. Didn't hear anything back for a couple weeks, but yesterday I got a response at around 5pm from an email address called [""info@carolinelabasshealth.com](mailto:%22info@carolinelabasshealth.com)"" which seemed legit. The format of the email was even more legit. I've worked at health care offices before and that was the exact format that they use. Anyway, the email said that the head of HR wanted to interview me. I needed to just add them on Google Hangouts and wait for them to respond. I did that almost immediately and got a response from the person.

This lady claimed her name was Annie S\*\*\*\*\*\*\* and then she gave me a bio of herself.  
""To start with i am Mrs Annie S  I received my  Bachelor of Psychology degree from \[an accredited\] University. I also studied accounting at the University of \[an actual place\]. i was made chief human resources officer, on July 1, 2016.. Everything i have accomplished in life has been on my own. I am very energetic and very driven to better my life. I give 150% on everything I do.""  
So along with the awkwardness of the message, and the fact that it has some grammatical errors, this entire interview was conducted through Google Hangouts via message. Suspicious, but I was eager anyway.

Almost every response had some sort of mistake in it. I figured that it was maybe because she was older and wasn't used to messaging? But, if it's a professional interview..well...yeah. Also the message came from a random gmail account. She apologized and said that the interview process wasn't as professional as it could be, but she believed in using present day technology to conduct business? There wasn't really much that was super suspicious about the interview itself. She asked general questions you'd hear anywhere, and she even asked some that were specific to accounting. She gave me a long description of the job and asked if I could do it, etc. It all seemed fine. They never asked for anything beyond my name, cell phone number, and address. But then my boyfriend looked at it and got a bit suspicious. Why were they conducting a professional interview over chat? Why not do at least a phone call or a video chat? I've had remote jobs in college before, and yeah I was in a conference call with the trainer and several other employees. She didn't even mention considering me, it was basically like ""alright you have the job."" It was then that I had an awful feeling in my stomach. I asked her why it had to be conducted this way, and the fact that this was pretty weird, and if I would be actually speaking to anyone from the company. This is what was said:

""Sure you have nothing to worry about calling, by tomorrow morning a phone call will be placed to you by the admin about your application and interview update.. ""

Me: ""Okay, sounds good. Should I expect a Colorado number to be contacting me?""

""Sure, by tomorrow morning.. ""

And then that was when she mentioned the whole "" Before you start working, you will recieve a payment ,you will use this payment to set up your mini office by purchasing accounting softwares plus the shippng logistics,cos we will be sending you some equipments you will be needing to start work with, immediately you get this payment you start work.""

And that is when the alarm bells really started. I looked up Annie S. and saw if I could get any hits looking even remotely like the picture on her hangouts message, but nope. I started scouring through Reddit for any similar stories I could find, and yep, pretty sure this is a scam. This morning I looked up the address, the phone number, and went back to the company website to see what I could find. The business doesn't exist on Google Maps, or Google for that matter. The only hits you get are the job postings and the bogus website. No employees or contact numbers, etc. I called the number and a guy with either an Indian/South East Asian accent answered, and it sounded very noisy and there was a lot of feedback. ""Hello. Good morning.""

I hung up immediately. DEFINITELY NOT the greeting one would use with a medical care facility in the United States. You would say ""Thank you for calling blah blah blah, my name is blah blah blah."" A couple minutes later, the number called me back. I blocked it. Annie messaged me this morning so I said ""Hello, thank you for the opportunity but I'm no longer interested,"" and reported the address. And now I'm here telling you my story. I got really concerned because I couldn't find ANY Reddit posts about this place. I think people need to know about this, because they've been recently popping up on job websites.

So PLEASE be careful out there, folks. Job searches are hard enough without getting scammed :(  
Thankfully I didn't give any info that you can't find on a Google search, and I've locked my cards and changed my passwords, etc.

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (online or in real life), you deposit a check and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards, Western Union, or cash). The bank will take the initial deposit back in anywhere from a week to a month, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam.

brownieinthebin,fdh0e44,t1_fdgxv6z,"Right??? 

Like..could you be a wee bit more convincing about this site? What person would want to hide their identity when giving reviews about elderly care? 

And thank you. I'm glad that I was aware enough to catch it. It's just funny how hard they try to evolve to make the scam ever more convincing."
ZZ9ZA,fdivojq,t1_fdgxv6z,"Realistically as soon as you hear ""virtual assistant"" you know it's 100% a scam."
brownieinthebin,fdh0hx2,t1_fdgyats,"Yup. It's interesting that they chose something so noble, like elderly care. Makes you question it even less. Oh yeah the other thing is the ""google reviews pending"" window."
DPMx9,fdgyczj,t3_elctdz,"Standard !fakecheck scam disguised as a job offer.

Ghost the scammers, and report them to whatever website you found them on."

icyhotonmynuts,fdhfrmh,t1_fdgyczj,Maybe report the website to their registrar? I see it's [GoDaddy](https://www.whois.com/whois/carolinelabasshealthcare.com)
brownieinthebin,fdhg7m1,t1_fdhfrmh,Good call. I've already contacted a few of the sites that hosted the job listings and gotten responses from them. They've taken the listings down.  I'll do that as well.
Drinkythedrunkguy,fdgxaah,t3_elctdz,Sounds like a very elaborate fake check scam. Do any of these people exist on LinkedIn? I have to say I am impressed by the amount of work these fraudsters appear to have put into this scheme.
brownieinthebin,fdgzvjr,t1_fdgxaah,"YUP. They do. That's what was even more like ""wow...this is some real effort.""

After you have read and listened to quite a few of these scams, something about the rhythm of this dialogue begins to stick out. The grammar and word choice reflect someone whose first language was not English, which is not in itself a disqualifier, but there is something about it I can't quite explain that really stands out as ""scammer-speak""."
acertainshape,fdhe46i,t1_fdh968z,"Why would the head of HR give her entire background, educational history and work philosophy to you, the interviewee, before the interview?  This never happens in IRL. They are trying way too hard."
Doctorsass,fdhbxom,t1_fdh968z,"To me, it always sounds like there trying to really up the ethos and make it seem like they are a credible person before they start the scam. Kinda going over board with the whole ‘I’m a good hard working person qualified for my position’. Qualified people don’t feel the need to write a paragraph about how qualified they are."
kabekew,fdid0rz,t1_fdh968z,"People who scam others for a living probably have never held a legitimate job, so wouldn't know how real companies operate or real businesspeople talk."
brownieinthebin,fdhf1aj,t1_fdh968z,"Oh totally. ""I am very energetic."" That's just...strange. Professional people don't say things like that, and I don't need a personal bio of how you tackle your life. Good for you, yknow? So yeah I get what you mean when you say ""scammer speak."""
brownieinthebin,fdhf4d4,t1_fdhe46i,Yep they wouldn't.
brownieinthebin,fdhf3bi,t1_fdhbxom,"Definitely. I mean, I'm here applying for the job. Obviously I think you're good at what you do if you're interviewing me."
iownalaptop,fdhbabc,t3_elctdz,"""I give 150% on everything I do.""

stee_stee_,fdi2plt,t3_elctdz,"I didn't even finish reading this after I saw job and Google Hangouts in the same post lol. It's a fake check scam disguised as a job. Pretty common, there have been many posts on here from people who almost got duped the exact same way, but just a slightly diff job scenario."
Normalise,fdif1z9,t3_elctdz,"Don't want to state the obvious but any recruiter that wants to interview via Google Hangouts and starts the message with their personal history rather than the companies should be blocked.

Good stuff for spotting it but may I also suggest reporting the site:  [https://elite-strategies.com/report-nasty-website-google/](https://elite-strategies.com/report-nasty-website-google/) 

They pop up every day but nothing like wasting their time and money on sites that are flagged."

OptOut99,fdhd2bk,t3_elctdz,"Hopefully you didn't give up your social security number or any ID scans. I DM'd you what to do if you did.  But locking your cards and changing passwords is NOT enough. 

Credit freezes at big 3 , plus Innovis, and Chex systems if you shared either of the above."
brownieinthebin,fdhfc6r,t1_fdhd2bk,"No, there was no personal info that was given. If they had asked me for either of those, I would have immediately called them out. 

Thank you though. 

I'm keeping a close eye on things."
meloni_meloni,fdlwt95,t1_fdhd2bk,"My husband got involved with in a similar situation and he did give his info. Once they started explaining the “tasks” he was supposed to do, we started seeing this was a scam. He went to report it to the FTC and the police department but since there was no transaction there is nothing they can do. 
I am worried because he gave his social security number, he is closing his bank account tomorrow. 

Can you tell me what else can we do now?"
OptOut99,fdn7pl3,t1_fdlwt95,"Please see this workbook. Starting on page 2 it explains all the credit freezes. I recommend you place all 6 . https://inteltechniques.com/data/workbook.pdf
Make sure you keep any pins or logins you create as it will be a real pain and there will be a significant delay if you lose this information and want to temporarily unfreeze his credit."
