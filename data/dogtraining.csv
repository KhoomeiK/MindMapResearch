Librarycat77,fdmgpa2,t3_elzvm2,"Alright folks, enough about the breed.

Rudeness is against our rules folx."
Works_For_Treats,fdmca2c,t3_elzvm2,"He's cute, but careful with him. Hopefully he grows out of that jacked up angulation that he's got with his front legs.

Also both breeds are slow to mature, so at 12 weeks his behaviors will not be as intense as when he's older. Enroll in training now as this is the best learning period for a dog."
LadyRhovaniel,fdmjqdv,t1_fdmca2c,"I will, thanks for the advice! Meeting with the dog trainer today :)"
fmurphy92,fdlt5sy,t3_elzvm2,German Husky or Siberian Shepherd makes so much more sense.
hopelessbogan,fdm0jqw,t1_fdlt5sy,"Makes it sound like a separate breed! Why not German Shepherd x Siberian Husky, or Shepherd/Husky cross if you're lazy?"
micrographia,fdmb81q,t1_fdlt5sy,"Alternatively, and identically, mutt!"
LurkThoseAbs,fdltlve,t1_fdlt5sy,This is the way
LadyRhovaniel,fdmj2px,t1_fdlt5sy,"I agree with you, but this is what I was told. I can’t go around asking everybody on the internet first if they’re okay with me using that name. I’ll stick to GSD / husky mix from now on if it bothers people that much."
jlund19,fdm4cho,t1_fdm0jqw,I agree. I really hate all these names for designer breeds that are actually just mutts. But a shepherd/husky mix doesn't make as much money as a Gerbieran Shepsky
solasaloo,fdmd685,t1_fdm6atw,It can't even be a breed name because that's not a breed!
LadyRhovaniel,fdmjabe,t1_fdm6atw,"I understand your frustration. Usually I just call him a mixed breed, because as I said that designer name is hard for me to pronounce and sounds weird. Writing it is relatively easy and I figured then people know what he is without me having to explain the genetics. I just went with what I was told that’s what their mix is called. I understand people are grumpy because it’s not an actual breed (and don’t think of him as such either). He’s just our good boy."
HungryDamage,fdmliu8,t1_fdmj2px,"Just do what you like, people who get upset about the ""purity"" of dog breed names aren't worth worrying about"
ambersakura,fdmibg3,t1_fdm4cho,Insane to think someone is selling them for more!! Here all shepherd husky crosses are like 1/4 of a shepherd or husky alone.
essari,fdonfmu,t1_fdmjabe,"They're just being weird. I think it sounds cute for what he is, ignoring the whole goofiness of designer dogs and their naming."
LadyRhovaniel,fdmoud2,t1_fdmliu8,"I understand why they’re upset though, apparently names like these are given to mixes to increase their value and sell them as ‘designer dogs’. I just never questioned it much because we purchased him for the price of any other mutt, and all official paperwork does say ‘mixed breed’ because I think they can’t legally call him a Shepsky. Idk, I’m just happy about my dog."
LadyRhovaniel,fdmjewh,t1_fdmibg3,Where I live they are sold for the price of a regular mutt. I don’t think they really count as ‘designer dogs’ here - it’s not really a common term.
chronoventer,fdmhlnh,t1_fdmgsii,"Key words being *over many years*. Not just because some backyard breeder gets two dogs with structures, temperaments, etc. nowhere near similar and breeds them together, making bank by preying off people who don’t know any better and just see a cute puppy. 

Breeds were designed for a purpose. That’s what helped guide the breed. These are being bred for money."
LadyRhovaniel,fdont49,t1_fdonfmu,"It kinda sounds like a child named him, you know? Like ‘Brangelina’ or if a chick and a duck have babies, does that make them a ‘chuck’ (sorry, been watching too much Friends).

Either way I know where Zeus comes from and I can honestly say I trust his breeder. And even if he’s a mutt, he’s worth ten purebreds to me :)"
WanTime4YaMind,fdmqi58,t1_fdmoud2,Happy for you and your pup :)
LadyRhovaniel,fdmkc3b,t1_fdmhlnh,"Zeus cost the same as any other mutt in my country. He and his siblings weren’t sold for an extreme amount as a designer dog, but I understand your frustration with people trying to make money off of special - looking mixed breeds."
essari,fdoq5cf,t1_fdont49,"I mean,  who cares right? It's good for a laugh and then we move onto important things.  May we be always as imaginative as children."
Genestah,fdppfjl,t1_fdoq5cf,"Exactly. Who cares right? It's a mutt. You don't have to say Gerberber Brasky every time.

Just love your dog the way it loves you. It doesn't care about its brand name."
igotdickfordays,fdn4gy7,t3_elzvm2,"We have a female that recently turned one year old. If you wanna see, I posted a picture around Christmas. This is the second of this mix we have had and they are amazing animals. It’s strange though that both seem to have taken a big genetic step back a wolf in looks and behaviors. Unlimited energy and intelligence mixed with a complete inability to handle negative feedback. I suggest you prepare yourself to be tested. Also make him work for everything. That means every bite of food. They love to work or else they get bored and destroy everything they can get to. If you want any more advice don’t hesitate to ask!"
LadyRhovaniel,fdn6pyv,t1_fdn4gy7,"She is a beautiful girl! I can’t honestly complain about Zeus’s level of energy. I work with him quite a lot, so maybe that’s why he’s pooped in the evening? Anyways he takes regular naps throughout the day, in fact, he’s asleep on the couch right now after a session of loose leash training :) As a matter of intelligence, he stumps me every day. It’s crazy how quickly he picks things up and how eager he is to please! I’ve started using his food for leash training instead of just giving it to him, firstly because I’m afraid all the treats would make him fat and secondly because for some reason he won’t eat much unless I hand feed it to him. Have you had any experience with difficult eaters?"
look_itsatordis,fdn9vtl,t1_fdn4gy7,The dog bed mixup always makes me laugh! My grandparents have a yellow lab and they pet sit for my aunt's 2 chihuahuas sometimes... I've lost count of how many times I've found the 2 little ones stealing the lab's bed and her using their bed as a pillow.
igotdickfordays,fdnk6xu,t1_fdn6pyv,It took us all while to find a dry food she likes but most grain free with salmon and sweet potatoes is her favorite. Ours seems a little more GS and yours more Husky which is good since we live in the south.
igotdickfordays,fdnkajw,t1_fdn9vtl,No question who’s the boss there too!
LadyRhovaniel,fdnm0sf,t1_fdnk6xu,"According to the dog trainer he still needs to get used to everything, which is why he doesn’t eat so much right now. It’ll get better.

Yeah, we live up North so a little more Husky doesn’t hurt here :)"
Dartaga,fdm5mq6,t3_elzvm2,Zeus is lovely. I know you will treasure him forever. Enjoy!
LadyRhovaniel,fdmjk56,t1_fdm5mq6,Thank you!!
nolanj162,fdm26k8,t3_elzvm2,"Sounds like a handful, hope you like exercise!"
LadyRhovaniel,fdmji8g,t1_fdm26k8,"Once he’s a little bigger and better trained we hope to go running with him, and maybe train him for nosework :)"
boatzart,fdmhxeo,t3_elzvm2,I have a shepherd/husky/boxer mix and I call him my Boxberian Shepsky.
LadyRhovaniel,fdmjr8m,t1_fdmhxeo,Do you have a picture? I’m curious what that mix looks like
boatzart,fdmk9i4,t1_fdmjr8m,Boy do I https://imgur.com/gallery/3u4yo2t
LadyRhovaniel,fdmkfm5,t1_fdmk9i4,OMG HE IS SO BEAUTIFUL
orphanb,fdmqzk7,t1_fdmk9i4,What a lovely dog. Can't see much Boxer in him though. Does that side come out in his personality?
Litarider,fdn2rmg,t1_fdmk9i4,"zomg, the couch picture. Now I love your dog too."
boatzart,fdmkly1,t1_fdmkfm5,"Sometimes he looks like picture 1, sometimes he looks like picture 7. He’s a good boy."
boatzart,fdn9iol,t1_fdmqzk7,"My fiancé says so.  He’s definitely a huge goof sometimes, but that just seems like husky to me. He has these huge jaw muscles on the top of his head that flex when he’s really chewing on a toy that I think come from his boxer side."
LadyRhovaniel,fdmnuif,t1_fdmkly1,And he’s got some of that Husky dorkiness I see :D
irrationalweather,fdn6sde,t1_fdmkly1,I DIDN'T SCROLL PAST THE FIRST PICTURE
LindsayEm,fdni3rl,t3_elzvm2,He’s so adorable! Give him a hug for me.
LadyRhovaniel,fdnm4ws,t1_fdni3rl,"Thanks! He kinda doesn’t like me right now because I gave him a shower, so the hug will have to wait :D"
brissey420,fdo7wk5,t3_elzvm2,I love this puppy! I live German Shepherds and huskys so why not? These people on here need to get a grip.  Congratulations on your beautiful pup
LadyRhovaniel,fdomy0d,t1_fdo7wk5,"Thanks! I don’t let it get to me. I have met and trust the breeders, seen his parents (both lovely and wellbehaved doggo’s), and I know I chose well. To me he is just my wonderful smol pupper and I’m gonna do my best to raise him right :)"
jvsews,fdn7sic,t3_elzvm2,Why are they breeding huskies and German shepherds?
LadyRhovaniel,fdpsdjb,t1_fdn7sic,"I can’t speak for all breeders out there but ours just did because they had a female Siberian Husky and a male Siberian Husky / GSD mix, so I guess because they could?"
jvsews,fdqsv6i,t1_fdpsdjb,So for $$ or a mistake
LadyRhovaniel,fdqv0uz,t1_fdqsv6i,"If you want to be cynical, that describes literally every dog to be honest. Breeders don’t produce purebred dogs out of the goodness of their hearts either, their litters are either their livelihood or they were an accident. So yeah, for $$$ or a mistake."
jvsews,fdqv92f,t1_fdqv0uz,Apparently you have never been involved with ethical breeders they breed for the betterment of their breed. Sorry
potato-pit,fdm2sav,t3_elzvm2,German shushky - bc i bet he talks!
Works_For_Treats,fdmcbfi,t1_fdm2sav,"Don't worry, the owners will think it's cute when it starts...and so the cycle begins."
jfm2143,fdnh1ij,t1_fdm2sav,"Right?!? I saw that photo and could hear the whines, grumbles, and backchat!  Thats a dog likely to let you know what they're thinking."
LadyRhovaniel,fdmjjd5,t1_fdmcbfi,"What do you mean, talking?"
LadyRhovaniel,fdol2zh,t1_fdnh1ij,"Lol he does backtalk. When he pulls on the leash I stop, wait for him to relax the leash, and focus his attention on me again, but sometimes it takes too long for him to get it and he gets annoyed because we’re not moving. Then I get a long, angry ‘I WANT’ - whine XD"
Works_For_Treats,fdmlfix,t1_fdmjjd5,"Both breeds that your pup is mixed with are known for being very vocal. Even without encouragement it will grow. But it's much worse if you encourage it. Vocalizations are also self reinforcing(release dopamine hit when practiced) so over time can literally become addicting for a dog. With vocal breeds it's something you want to keep in mind. GSDs and Huskies that nuisance bark are annoying to the point of others taking measures against your dog. Putting up sonic deterrents(which don't actually work) or resorting to more nefarious means to quiet your animal. 

Not saying that those things are common, but we still live in a world where people leave poisoned tennis balls for dogs to find, put poison into yards, etc. Problem behaviors can also usually be traced back to puppyhood, so it's really worth taking extra time to prevent as many future issues as possible. 

Also, not to put down trainers associated with big box stores, but you may want to make sure that your trainer works for a training business and has proper certifications. They will be more experienced and knowledgeable with working with dogs such as yours."
LadyRhovaniel,fdmokio,t1_fdmlfix,"Good to know! Yeah, that’s why we wanted to get in touch with a dog trainer - we wanted to get a head start and nip bad behaviours in the bud before they can grow to be a problem. The lady we’re meeting is a friend of my friend, who works privately and also trains other animals like horses. She seemed very knowledgeable, but if there is a problem still, there is a club for working dogs just up the street from us, that offers courses for these kinds of breeds (also for pups) which I may take him to."
jaapz,fdnp2dg,t1_fdmokio,"Just so you know, my mal/gsd mix is the quietest dog ever. I think she barks once every 6 months. Even within breeds there's lots and lots of completely different dogs."
LadyRhovaniel,fdnrjgs,t1_fdnp2dg,"Oh wow! Yeah I guess we’ll have to see what he does. So far it’s been limited to growling at a new thing, and only if the new thing is large and scary (like a horse). Here’s hoping!"
darkhorse_defender,fdo4l3v,t1_fdnp2dg,"It may be the mal in her, I grew up with a malamute and they tend to be quiet dogs."
jaapz,fdo9wsr,t1_fdo4l3v,She's a malinois :)
SugarKyle,fdokcoh,t3_elzvm2,The only dog in my life when I was young was a GSD X Husky mix named Blue for one blue eye. He belonged to my grandmother and he was the reason I made it through visits. He also tore my hand open when I was being a jerk to him one day. I deserved it and he taught me a valuable lesson that day as a small child. He was a great dog and I hope that the two of you have an equally amazing time in the future.
LadyRhovaniel,fdonbor,t1_fdokcoh,"Thanks, I hope so too! Sorry to hear your hand got chewed up by your grandmother’s dog... No lasting damage I hope?"
SugarKyle,fdot32j,t1_fdonbor,I was fine. I was bugging him while he ate which I had been warned not to do. He popped a hole in the thumb part of my palm. I cleaned it and apologize to him. I was about 7.
LadyRhovaniel,fdps9lz,t1_fdot32j,Yikes. At least you learned quickly not to bug the dog while he’s eating!
cheezyridr,fdoqbqg,t3_elzvm2,"at first it amazed me that people went on and on about  the breed name. then i thought ""oh yeah, it's the internet.""  looks like a cool dog, good for you!  and him too of course. 

 something i've heard  people say that baffles me is when they talk about their dog being a picky eater.  i've been raising dogs my entire life, and i have never once come across this in any dog i've owned.  in fact, all of them have eaten tons and tons of things i wish they wouldn't.  including poop, yellow jackets,  a christmas tree,  including lights and ornaments and tinsel,  socks, a rain coat,  shoes... i'm not talking about chewed up stuff. i mean eaten.   i've raised almost a dozen dogs since i was a kid, from pup to old age.  they all eat whatever i give them."
LadyRhovaniel,fdps72o,t1_fdoqbqg,"I understand why some people want to discourage names like these being used, but at the same time, I had no idea this was such a big deal (and frankly, I think they’re overreacting a bit). Like I’ve explained what feels like a million times now, I know Zeus is a mutt because we specifically looked for one, I simply figured that this is the name they give this particular sort of mutt, and I didn’t question it. He is a good, healthy boy and comes from a good home, so I could care less about everybody screaming about him being from a puppy mill or being used for profit. 

I wouldn’t say Zeus is picky, he’ll try to eat just about anything. However, when it comes to his food and mealtimes, he tends to just eat a little bit (maybe 1/4 to 1/2) of the food he’s given, and I almost always have to coax him to his food bowl. When I hand feed him, he gobbles it up like it’s the last thing he’ll ever eat, though. Is this something you’ve encountered in your years as a trainer?"
cheezyridr,fdqgdux,t1_fdps72o,"i have had 2 puppies that did that, but it never lasted more than a couple weeks."
Litarider,fdqxnl4,t1_fdps72o,I’ve seen this with some of my foster puppies. I don’t know if it’s small tummies or lack of confidence that the food is theirs and won’t be taken. It should pass in a few weeks.
LadyRhovaniel,fdqzde7,t1_fdqgdux,Good to know! Maybe this will pass then :)
LadyRhovaniel,fdqym0x,t1_fdqxnl4,"I hope so! I’d hate for him to get sick or malnourished or something. I’ve been trying to hand feed him to get some food in him at least, and he does eat some kibble when I use it as treats during loose leash training."
Litarider,fdqyr0k,t1_fdqym0x,Hand feeding really helps. What type (material) of bowl do you use? I find some don’t like metal food bowls.
LadyRhovaniel,fdqzbsu,t1_fdqyr0k,"It’s plastic, and attached to an automatic pet feeder because we felt it would help us keeping him on a schedule. He isn’t afraid of it or anything, he knows that it’s where his food comes from and he does eat from it, just never when he actually should be (at mealtimes). Maybe the breeders were freefeeding? We try not to, to avoid accidents in the house."
Litarider,fdr18au,t1_fdqzbsu,"I think a schedule is best. Maybe for now smaller, more frequent feedings are necessary until his stomach gets bigger."
LadyRhovaniel,fdr501m,t1_fdr18au,"I will give it a try, thanks for the advice!"
pickin-n-grinin,fdq4go3,t3_elzvm2,He's a cutie patootie
LadyRhovaniel,fdqze1l,t1_fdq4go3,Thank you! I love him :)
twentythree12,fdmvm2j,t3_elzvm2,I don't know why we praise designer dogs when there are millions getting euthanized in shelters daily....
LadyRhovaniel,fdmwaah,t1_fdmvm2j,"To be honest, the term sounds weird to me. It’s just a fancy word for a mutt, right? I guess as far as rebranding goes whoever coined the term should be in advertising."
jaapz,fdnp5uc,t1_fdmvm2j,"Who says this dog was bred in a puppy mill ""designing"" gsd/husky mixes? There are ""oops"" litters (like my mal/gsd), one-off litters, there's responsible breeding of mutts as well (mixes tend to be tougher, less susceptible to breed-specific problems)"
CaptainTrips77,fdnvnl6,t1_fdnsgpy,"The issues with purebreds are when they are less genetically diverse, which has been the case for many breeds historically. Genes can cause a disease when inherited from just one parent are less common, but certain genes increase susceptibility to certain diseases. If both your parents give you the same genes that increase susceptibility, then the odds of having the associated disease goes up significantly.

Unfortunately, breeding practices have indeed led to some genepools with higher incidence of genetic disease, which breeders are now trying to rectify. Still, globally speaking, mixed breed dogs are much less likely to be susceptible to those diseases. 

[Here's a summary of paper discussing the issue](https://www.instituteofcaninebiology.org/blog/health-of-purebred-vs-mixed-breed-dogs-the-data)"
CaptainTrips77,fdoa1qg,t1_fdnwm1g,"Don't think the original statement was necessarily made with hybrid vigor in mind, so much as avoiding genetic diseases commonly associated with certain breeds, which is certainly possible within one generation (depending on the nature of genetic component of the disease). That's how I read it anyway.

I don't think anyone would claim that a specific mixed breed individual is definitely more fit than a purebred individual, but if you're speaking in very general terms (as the original statement was), then it's not unreasonable to claim that mutts tend to have fewer the genetic health problems."
CaptainTrips77,fdoeur4,t1_fdoaq87,"Okay. I'm not a dog breeder, but I do have a PhD in biology and a pretty good understanding of basic genetics and disease (especially cancer), which is not necessarily related to hybrid vigor.

Just gonna leave [this link](https://www.instituteofcaninebiology.org/blog/the-myth-of-hybrid-vigor-in-dogsis-a-myth) here in case anyone wants to read about hybrid vigor in dogs, which isn't my field of expertise, but is an interesting tangent."
Emil8ner,fdntzy2,t3_elzvm2,I also have a Gerberian Shepsky! Beautiful breed.
LadyRhovaniel,fdo07wa,t1_fdntzy2,Absolutely! Hope you have a wonderfully wellbehaved doggo. Any tips for a new owner?
Emil8ner,fdo1pav,t1_fdo07wa,"Definitely! Do not underestimate how much energy that dog has. Without the proper stimulation, your dog will start to destroy stuff. That’s with any puppy, but huskies and shepherds are both high energy. Run at least once a day and your dog will tire itself out for a few hours. I always run before bed so mine doesn’t get up in the middle of the night and chew on things. They’re sooo easy to train though!!"
LadyRhovaniel,fdo8luu,t1_fdo1pav,"So it’s not just my pup? I have had him for 5 days now and I (and everybody else around me) is just blown away by how good of a boy he is. He has taken to the crate like nothing, barely goes in the house anymore (only when I fall asleep and forget to take him out in time does he have accidents), and while he is curious and inquisitive to all things new, I’ve taught him to sit and observe the new thing instead of pouncing on it like a starving lion. I don’t think he’s reached real ‘chewing stage’ yet, but I try to work with him throughout the day to tire him out, i.e. three big walks a day + potty breaks, mind games, obedience training... He’s usually pooped by 9 pm :D"
nandieherdz,fdm0c87,t3_elzvm2,Is this the Gerber dog?
LadyRhovaniel,fdmjgys,t1_fdm0c87,"I have been told people get upset over the designer dog name. I wasn’t aware of that. But yeah, this is our Siberian husky / GSD mix."
kegoodman90,elhold,top_level,
JohnnyMyers78,fdiukre,t3_elhold,The way he posts up in front of the machine not allowing the ball to go far away hahaha
Caesium133,fdj5gqx,t3_elhold,That's some real life dog min-maxing. Realizing the most efficient way to use the machine is shooting it straight into his mouth 😂

AngryHedgie_,fdiyqa5,t3_elhold,Love the floppy ears. Our corgi also has floppies
CorgiDad,fdk5dul,t1_fdk2j3g,That is 99.99% likely to be just an old wives tale.
kegoodman90,fdk83xv,t1_fdk2j3g,"I will give this a try, thanks."
kegoodman90,fdk86vy,t1_fdk5dul,"I’ve heard that when they are young and their teeth are developing, their bodies can’t produce enough calcium for the teeth and ears, so you can give them yogurt to help aid their calcium levels."
SeveredLimb,fdnhw9y,t1_fdk5dul,"99.99%?  that is a lot of percent to be sure without actually checking.

Your google foo must not be working.  Seems to be a thing, mostly among GSD owners."
SeveredLimb,fdnhcem,t1_fdk83xv,"Wow, i didn't expect to get down voted to all hell over what something I was told, LOL.

I don't think its and old wives tale and it probably falls within the same lines as what /u/Andiuxy had said about calcium supplements.  

One of our veterinarians said that she recommends spaying at around 6 months because some of her puppy teeth may need to be removed to prevent the adult teeth from rotting under the gums.  I wonder if this is also linked between their ears and teeth demanding calcium."
Andiuxy,fdkfi5g,t1_fdk86vy,"My shiba had floppy ears too, we had to give him calcium aid to get those pointy ears. Worked really fast."
kegoodman90,fdlu9p5,t1_fdkfi5g,What did you use as a calcium aid? Or is that what it’s called?
Andiuxy,fdlub1u,t1_fdlu9p5,There were just vitamins.
ECU69Pirate,fdj66rf,t3_elhold,Can anyone link me the device throwing the ball? i have a border collie who would love that. Thanks!

TheManSedan,fdj24el,t3_elhold,I tried to teach my corgi this but I have no idea what im doing! How did you get him to put it back in the funnel?
Koolbreeze88,fdjey2x,t1_fdj24el,I had to do a reverse training technique. I started with a small basket and I would put the ball in the basket and have my dog get it out. Then I’d have him drop it back in. It took a week or so to get him to understand a new command but I used that to get him to drop it in the machine.
kegoodman90,fdk8qos,t1_fdj24el,"I started by teaching him to drop the ball in my hand. Then I put my hand over the machine and encouraged him to get close to it. Even in the beginning, I always rewarded him for getting close to the goal with a “yes” and a throw of the ball. Eventually he put it in the machine and I gave a yes each time he did and I’d try to drop the ball straight in so it would go faster. The “yes” while in the machine helped him to know it was coming and he just had to be patient."
VioletVixxen,fdj33fe,t1_fdj24el,Same! My dog loves this toy/thrower but I cannot figure out how to train him to drop the balls back in himself!

orangetangerine,enp3s6,top_level,
orangetangerine,fe32qbh,t3_enp3s6,"How I did this:

1. **Shaping a retrieve:** When Camelot was young, I noticed he liked to parade around with toys.  Rather than teaching him ""drop it"" or ""leave it"" initially, I taught him ""bring it to me"" first and would cheer and reward him with snacks, praise, or tug (if it was a toy) if he brought me things.  I paid him all the time initially since he isn't a natural-retrieving breed, even though it was borderline annoying when he'd [bring me some really weird stuff](https://i.imgur.com/EpH7L43.jpg) at extremely inappropriate moments (thanks dude, I really needed you to bring me a thong from the laundry bin while I'm on a video call for work 😅).
2. **Build value for the object:** Just like any other object he wasn't accustomed to targeting with selectivity, I paired it with food. I'd ring the Tile and when my dog showed interest (even accidentally, like he glanced over), I tossed food on the wallet and praised the heck out of him.  He eventually got pretty curious about it!
3. **Put it all together:** When he started to really show interest in the wallet in earnest, I started asking him to ""bring it"" to me.  Eventually I was able to name the object ""wallet"" to help clarify what I wanted.
4. **Make the finds increasingly harder:** Camelot is a smart dude, but not really the best natural hunter, so we had to start slow and train him with different puzzles of appropriate difficulty.  He had a little bit of trouble finding the wallet hidden in other rooms or elevated over his head so we started with it on the bookshelf nose level and went up one shelf at a time.  Only recently I added mixing it in a bin of stuff or in a bag of stuff, which he started learning how to work out yesterday.

Obviously we still have a lot of work to do!  When the wallet is mixed with stuff he often goes directly to source but grabs an object next to the wallet.  It's how I have rolled-up networking cable and a box of tampons on my desk instead of my wallet, lol.  But he really gets the ""hide and seek"" game and he's getting way better at it the more we work on it!

(EDIT: Cam is not actually a service dog, we were joking around due to how fast he picked up this task.  His dad is a beautifully trained one, though!)"
alh9h,fe3x6ot,t1_fe32qbh,This is awesome! What a helpful fluffy cloud!
Wendeli,fe6jbi1,t1_fe32qbh,"Random Q, but do you train at town and country dog training club? I know sammies look similar, but he looks awfully familiar."
orangetangerine,fe9nfpl,t1_fe6jbi1,"I do! I'm also on the board for the club and do membership tasks for it.  My older dog, a pet obedience class flunkie and super sensitive rescue mutt, blossomed in their program.  She went from pet dog classes to [competition classes](https://i.imgur.com/SmUwk6s.jpg) with a lot of hard work, so we started Camelot there as a puppy and he's been [following in her footsteps](https://imgur.com/pQkIwTy) :)"
Wendeli,fe9rei6,t1_fe9nfpl,"I have the keeshond with no attention span in the 8pm classes! Thought he looked familiar :P.  I do like the training classes here a lot.  He really seems to get that he's in training mode when in class.  

Do you have any recs for other training classes around too?  I've only done two feet four paws besides TCDTC and though the instructor is experienced and knew mine from a puppy I've been a bit pissed at her ever since she told me my dog was never going to figure out how to calm down and behave in class."
orangetangerine,feajwi5,t1_fe9rei6,"Ah yeah I think we've talked before.  How old is your dog?

Spitz-breed puppies can be a little tough to manage for people who don't have any experience in creatively managing a breed (which is quite a few trainers I respect!) and group classes can be hard. It doesn't mean your dog is bad or you are bad, and it doesn't mean the end of the line for your dog even in terms of being able to exist in that environment, but it does mean that some additional steps in the process have to be taken to desensitize your dog and have him exist at a good threshold where he's enjoying class and not getting too distracted.

I've often found that if you're having trouble in the club it's really good to be proactive and tell the trainer so they can have accommodations ready or give you some ideas.  My older dog Cherry has repeated every competition foundation class at the club at least 2-5 times at this point and they work with me to isolate her problem exercises and keep it fun and interesting for her. There was an adolescent Golden in one of my competition classes who was _wild_ a few terms ago and could not focus at all for a few classes and she worked with the instructor and borrowed a wire crate for the class.  Her dog had a good ""settle"" in the crate so she just worked the dog out of the crate and sent it back in between exercises and her dog was immediately 100x better.  I've also done that same thing successfully with Cam - he used to really struggle working in hard environments (we take Nosework outside in a park) and even though he doesn't ""need"" it anymore, he works out of his soft crate almost every week and is one of the only dogs in his class to do so, because it sets up work patterns that are easily transportable to new environments."
Wendeli,fecofvp,t1_feajwi5,"He's 11 months old.  He was a nightmare until about 6 months, just constant barking at every little thing in class, but he's starting to figure it out now.  I can work him for more or less the entire class and get a down stay albeit not relaxed when not being worked. 

Not sure what I'd ask the instructors to help with.  He can do all the exercises in class, but you can tell he's barely holding all the excitement in and can't relax. I can't tell if it's a spitz/adolescent/unneutered/my training issue.  I'll take any advice you can offer :') ."
thisisultimate,fe41i57,t3_enp3s6,"My dog brings me random items too! I just have to keep repeating the command and eventually he'll end up bringing me the right thing, lol. Maybe not a time efficient task, but hey, if I fall and can't get up eveeeentually I'll get help xD"
orangetangerine,fe6eg0f,t1_fe41i57,"This is the first object I've gone so far as to name.  He's really good at picking up things if I point to it, or bringing me things to communicate what he wants (food bowl when he's hungry, tug toy when he wants to play, etc).  He actually [hand-delivered a clicker](https://i.imgur.com/jRxoCOa.jpg) last night when he was bored and I thought it was hilarious"
thisisultimate,fe6ik9r,t1_fe6eg0f,"That's super cute! Yeah, my dog knows a few items by name. BUT if he doesn't see it immediately, he'll pick up something random to bring to me instead. A sock, a shoe, whatever really. It's mostly my fault because I also taught him to put garbage in the trash, which was essentially me generalizing for everything that is laying on the ground  (He used to pull stuff out of the trash, so then I taught him this to make him pick it up again, lol) So now he has generalized other commands too far.

Edit: Oh man, just remembered the funniest one. One time he didn't see his leash, which I had sent him for....so he picked up the unplugged cord to our widescreen TV and began to bring it to me. I about died in horror and he was VERY offended that I was suddenly screaming at him xD"

Erin_C_86,fe481c0,t3_enp3s6,I feel like being the tampons/toilet paper could come in handy sometimes!
orangetangerine,fe6fawf,t1_fe481c0,"The problem with tampon boxes is that they're really easy to carry so they're often a target of Camelot's to bring to me with no prompting because they're the same size as his toys. Unfortunately, the last time he tried to bring me a box, it was open and he picked it up the wrong way and dumped the tampons out all over the floor.  Then he went all [surprised pikachu](https://i.imgur.com/3v9ktFP.png) excited-face on me, thinking that his new dog toy made smaller, new dog toys, haha."
Jan_AFCNortherners,fe45vyf,t3_enp3s6,I did this with all my tiles and my AirPods as well. So fun!
orangetangerine,fe6gviv,t1_fe45vyf,"If I point to my AirPods he'll get them for me, but methinks I will have to invest in a bit of a thicker case because they get a little too slobbery for my liking since the case is so small.

He will also get a phone on cue when we ring it from the Tile, but we'll practice that more once he gets the wallet down pat since they're a little tougher to carry.  He spotted my boyfriend's phone on the floor, sniffed it, picked it up, walked past me and delivered it to him instead of me the other day, so he'll get the phone on its own cue in due time :)"
Jan_AFCNortherners,fe6h7aa,t1_fe6gviv,I actually did just that. I got a slip on rubber airpod case so no teeth marks and she could grasp it better.
orangetangerine,fe9od6a,t1_fe6h7aa,"I think the lid cover of the cheap one I bought warped from heat so it comes off really easily.  Cam has a pretty gentle mouth (my boyfriend sent him to ""deliver"" me a saltine cracker yesterday, and while it was coated in slobber it was still in one piece) but I def need to get a more sturdy one before building value for the case.  If it falls on the floor I'll often ask him to get it for me because sometimes I am just _that_ lazy"
petkix,fe4gmwk,t3_enp3s6,Lovely one! I bet that someday he can be able to use your cash and buy himself a lot of treats
orangetangerine,fe6h18h,t1_fe4gmwk,"My little terrier basically rules over him, and I'm pretty sure if he had that ability he would be purchasing things for her.  They can't be left out together free roaming because he has stolen food multiple times and opened baby gates to impress her.  We have it all caught on our Wyze cam -- he never does this for himself"

orangetangerine,fe9j4s4,t1_fe8a7yb,That's hilarious and at least extremely super cute 😂
solarsunshine,fe6f5gw,t3_enp3s6,"""ooohhh tampons. Great."""
orangetangerine,fe9pfdw,t1_fe6f5gw,"😂 I gotta keep him motivated! The problem with Cam is that like with some other Sammies, they really love praise and are _complete_ clowns, and if I laugh or overreact to him getting me something wrong he will be happy and very keen on offering that behavior again.  If I sound disappointed he will be very demotivated and may not want to try again, so I give him some praise for trying but I throw an all-out party with lots of praise and food rewards when he gets it right to help him understand the selectivity but keep him motivated :)

I showed him in Rally this summer and prepared little for it; we were shut out of trials that were full for an entire month, and found out the day before the very last one that we had made it in.  To keep him challenged for the month we did tricks -- I was working on a dramatic ""play dead"" instead of working with him on Rally.  So when we got to the trial and to a ""Stop -> Lie Down"" sign, he sighed dramatically and [flopped over to the floor in death's throes](https://i.imgur.com/xkfA5Mw.jpg).  It was a suuuuper popular show with an audience of onlookers so there were a bunch of people in stitches laughing, and it took me _weeks_ to untrain him from doing his death dance any time I asked him to ""lie down""."

beneaththeradar,fdhsr6g,t1_fdhjxg8,"my aussie shepherd (same breed as the dog in the video) knows left and right. I trained by shaping with a clicker.

basically you start out luring/coaxing the dog to turn one direction, clicking and rewarding each time. You might even start with them just turning their head in the right direction - the key is to train in incremental steps working your way up to the full desired behavior. Once they have that down you introduce your cue word (e.g. Left, or Right) and work on clicking and rewarding when they respond to the cue word with the appropriate action. Eventually they will respond to the cue word with the appropriate action without need for further reinforcement (although its always good practice to reinforce desirable behavior every so often). 

https://positively.com/dog-training/methods-equipment/training-methods/shaping/"
notabigmelvillecrowd,fdhscs8,t1_fdhjxg8,I just used luring to train my dog left and right.
irregularjoe89,fdht0zx,t1_fdhsr6g,I do the same kinda but using the ch sound as audible cue for left and right but idk if my jrt mix would know left it right. We also use German attention (achtung) to be wary of crossing intersections while on dog walk
CollieWhisperer,fdi1f5d,t1_fdht0zx,Just be sure you're not using the command word until you've shaped the behavior or else you'll muddle the definition of the word in the dogs mind

amildiazu,emtbul,top_level,"We rescued a 4 month old aussie/border collie/terrier/corgie and she super-bonded with my wife. I need some training advice so I can share in the responsibilities more effectively. I am the first one to get up so I usually take her outside and then feed her. After breakfast, I'll try to get the pup to play with me or go for a walk, but she just whines or pulls at the leash in whatever direction leads back to my wife. She'll go to the bedroom door to paw and whine til I let her in. Sometimes she'll go back to sleep but often she'll just try to wake my wife up.   


My wife has multiple sclerosis, and being able to sleep in in the morning makes a big difference w/ symptom management. I try to protect her morning sleep as best I can.  


This morning I couldn't get the puppy to walk so I drove her 5 minutes to a trailhead. She would go about 200 yards and then back to the car; never in the direction I wanted to go. She didn't seem like she was having fun but rather that she was trying to figure out where my wife might be and how to get back to her.   


I work from home in an outbuilding, and when I try to take her out there with me to get some work done she just sits at the glass door, stares at the house, and whines.  I can't get anything done.  


I really wish I could walk/run her in the morning to get some of that puppy energy out so she's easier on my wife during the day. I also don't want her to be so distressed.  


We are clicker training her, and she seems pretty smart. She knows sit, shake, high 5, down, go to your bed, stay, and come (though she can often be pretty stubborn with go-to-your-bed and come). She likes me, wags her whole butt when I come home, licks my face and whimpers with love-pain. 

Any advice on how to get her to be less dependent/attached to my wife and less stubborn when I want to take her on a walk or get her to come."
userino69,fdr5fqt,t3_emtbul,"As tough as it may be at first, your wife will have to take a step back and you will have to become the source of all food and treats and fun for a while. Hopefully in time your pup will learn to associate you with those things as well.
It worked for us since our new pup also super focussed on my fiancée and whined whenever she left the room. That is now slowly quiteing down."
dreshany,fdr7zre,t1_fdr5fqt,"I second this response. Your wife needs to become a neutral “object” for awhile. No petting, looking at, feeding, playing with the pup. You need to become the sole source of motivation. Once she has accepted you and her reaction to your wife has calmed, she can gradually integrate back into the pups life. If the pup starts to re-focus on your wife, back up a few steps and repeat. 
Once she is re-introducing herself there is a great game that also reinforces “come”. Both of you sit some distance apart. Have treats with you. Take turns calling the pup giving lots of praise, play and treats. When it’s the other person’s turn to call the pup, you go neutral and totally ignore the pup. This helps the pup to adjust obeying both of you and not one more then the other."
amildiazu,fdrsgu3,t1_fdr7zre,"Oof, this will be very hard for my wife, but she is going to try. Thanks so much - I think this will really help."
Toshirauma,fdu60wu,t1_fdrsgu3,"If your wife becomes a special “treat” this could get worse. Be careful not to make access to her a big deal. It should just be neutral. Also, border collies are very sensitive. If you’re training her and it feels more like drilling than fun play time, your dog may be happier around your wife because she puts less pressure on the puppy. Even very subtle body movements can add a lot of pressure to a border collie. When training, if you’re in her face too much, she’ll gravitate towards your wife. 
You sounds like you’re really excited about training so I’m sure you’re doing a great job and you really care about your wife too. Your puppy is lucky to be with you! Best wishes with your new family member!"
amildiazu,fdwino5,t1_fdu60wu,>Thanks so much!
kushasorous,fdr3awl,t3_emtbul,Is she food motivated? If so I would be taking treats with me everywhere.

kushasorous,fdruerg,t1_fdrs4us,Yes it works great. I had a hard time getting my dog to focus on me on walks as I live in NYC most of the time. But he is very food motivated and the peanut butter spoon worked out great.
kushasorous,fdsi4nd,t1_fdrs4us,I just wanted to add keep the dog food in your hand while you're walking and keep it eye level with the dog. Can look pretty stupid while you're walking but it's still a puppy. When the dog starts to pull stop immediately and take the dog in the opposite direction it wants to go. Hold the leash short and you'll be good in no time. And to everyone saying for your wife to ignore the dog is simply a little ridiculous. Maybe do it together and make sure y'all are doing the same thing to train the dog. If you take the dog on strict walks and she doesn't your gunna have a bad time.

maebymaybe,fdr96v9,t3_emtbul,"If she is food motivated, find extra special treats that only you give her, maybe cut back on her regular meals so that while you are working in the office fill a kong with peanut butter/or chicken and her kibble mixed up so she has to spend some time eating it. What are things that she does with your wife? Cuddling? Playing? Have your wife step back from doing those things as much so that you can form a bond too. Make sure that you aren't the only one enforcing the ""rules"" or else your wife is just the comforting one and you are the one who actually makes her do stuff."
maebymaybe,fdra2zx,t1_fdr96v9,"Also, be aware of your energy, voice, and tone around her, my partner was always using a stern voice or not really talking to the dogs at all, whereas I was always saying, ""Hey pups! Let's go on a walk! Good dogs!"" in my naturally more high-pitched feminine voice and they would get excited and happy to do things with me. Women often just have an advantage with dogs, especially puppies because our voices are less deep, we are generally smaller, and these things make us less intimidating to dogs. Some dogs are more sensitive to sound than others and need the ""happy"" tone of voice to know that you aren't mad at them and that you are going to do fun things. Dogs also can read human faces, so smiling, being playful can really help. Once my partner started smiling and using a happy voice, they got so excited to do stuff with him, and now they are overjoyed when he comes home! Dogs might bond more with one family member than another, but you can definitely both have a strong connection too and she should enjoy being with you, even if she is happy to return back to your wife."
amildiazu,fdrsvq4,t1_fdra2zx,hmm. I feel like I've been trying/aware of most of these things. My voice is definitely not as excited and gentle but it's not stern either. I will try to be extra sensitive of my energy though. Maybe I should shave my beard.
greendazexx,fds8uzk,t1_fdrsvq4,"Nah the beard won’t matter as much, definitely focus on being a positive source of attention basically all the time. Always have food/treats, always talk in a higher pitched excited/happy voice and just do all the things she’s most excited about, like playing with her favorite toys or giving cuddles or something"
maebymaybe,fe0b85o,t1_fdrsvq4,"Cool, sounds like you're doing what you can. I forgot to mention too, my dogs go back and forth between being slightly more attached to one of us, and I think parents of young kids experience this too. Sometimes the kid only wants mommy for a while and then is super attached to dad, maybe she will switch once she realizes the fun stuff you guys do together :)"
SandyDelights,fdslnwg,t1_fdrsvq4,"It’s about energy, honestly. If you’re happy to see them,  if you’re (sincerely) enthusiastic, they’ll usually respond to it. Can take a bit, especially when dealing with the (frankly, unhealthy) attachment to your wife, but they’ll get there.

Getting excited is a big part of the bonding experience – plenty of people move from clickers to an enthusiastic “Yes!” or other excited praise to mark good behavior."
Elysiumthistime,fdr83tz,t3_emtbul,"Side note: At 4 months old, a medium sized dog like yours is still at risk of damaging their growth plates in their joints so go easy on the walks and no on leash running until they're at least 6 months but ideally a year or year and a half even if it seems she's still growing"
AlexandritePhoenix,fdrlc69,t1_fdr83tz,My vet would second this.  She said people are always disappointed when she tells them not to go on runs or long walks with their new puppy.  She said to let them determine how much they want to do and don't push it.
amildiazu,fdrt3gp,t1_fdrlc69,Thanks so much for this advice. I will keep this in mind. Our walks tend to be \~500 to 600 ft at home. Doesn't seem like a lot to me. She will run around at the dog park til she's content.
ethidium_bromide,fds1la1,t1_fdrlc69,"What if the pup is high energy and really wants long walks and to run around and play?

If you or /u/elysiumthistime could give me some advice I’d appreciate it because now I’m worried I’m hurting me puppy. He’s high energy, runs really fast. Basically speeds around doing figure eights around me when playing fetch, and loves and needs long walks. I don’t want to cause him long term problems bc of my own ignorance :/

4 month old sheepdog mix"
AlexandritePhoenix,fds3x30,t1_fds1la1,"Let him run to his heart's content off leash.  That way he stops when it's natural for him.  On a walk he doesn't have the option to stop when his body tells him to take a moment and lay down.  He has to walk all the way back no matter what.

Puppies tend to have a pattern of sprinting then taking a short break and then sprinting again.  That's probably the safest and healthiest thing for them.

Also, it's recommended to have them play on gently hilly ground if possible.  That ensures that the angle of their hip joint varies a lot during exercise.  Apparently it's beneficial in making sure their femoral head ends up nice and round instead of flattened since it's still being shaped as they grow."
Elysiumthistime,fdvkj4c,t1_fds1la1,"As another said, off leash running around is fine but your pup would probably go and go all day if you let it so you need to monitor them and if they appear to be fatiguing at all, call it quits and put them somewhere they can rest for a while.

 I'd highly recommend alternatives to traditional exercise too such as scent games with food or games like hide and seek in your house. Also, lure training where you guide them using food to walk under your legs, to walk backwards, in a wide circle etc. (kinda doing the basics of heel work to music but you're not giving commands etc. so it's more fun than regular obedience training). Tug of war can also be good, burns loads of energy and food puzzles such as a stuffed kong all adds to their overall daily mental stimulation and that tires a young pup out as much as physical exercise! :)"
ethidium_bromide,fdurg54,t1_fds3x30,"Phew, glad to hear he is good to run. Thank you for the response. I was kind of mentally freaking out at the prospect of dealing with my pup with less exercise!"
melzeezeeaaa,fdshakx,t1_fds3x30,This! My pup injured her front leg while jumping up onto a platform that was too high for her. So make sure the surrounding is safe without steps or platforms she may want to jump up or down without knowing her limits
Wawgawaidith,fdrq1ee,t3_emtbul,"When you feed her, mix the kibble with your bare hands a lot!  You'll mark the food with your scent so she will eventually bond more strongly with you.  We tried this trick with our second Aussie; my wife did the feeding, but placed the kibble in the bowl with her hands and mixed it around to scent it.,  Worked like a charm.  The dog is clearly *her* dog."
amildiazu,fdrt89t,t1_fdrq1ee,I will definitely try this!
femalenerdish,fds911v,t1_fdrt89t,You can also hand feed kibble. Tedious but helps with bonding a lot.
femalenerdish,fdsek1i,t1_fdsd20q,"Never heard that one before, interesting."
Libertyfive3k,fdrqutq,t3_emtbul,Train her to be a therapy/service dog.  Perhaps you can even go as far as to tailor her training to symptoms your wife has or may possibly develop.  Sounds like your puppy might be very receptive to be given a job taking care of someone she loves so much and it would help her expend a lot of energy throughout the day.
Ceridwen_Long,fds9jg4,t1_fdrqutq,"I agree. She sounds like she might have a natural talent for service work, which is AWESOME. Check out My Service Dog and Me (YouTube, Facebook, and website) for more info and training tips. They have an excellent reputation and lots of useful resources."
McKave,fdrglcu,t3_emtbul,"My husband isn't good at reading dog body language, so none of our dogs liked going places with him and they treated him exactly like you're being treated by your pup."
yourmomismysidepiece,fdrsv5m,t3_emtbul,"Hey friend! 4 months old, puppies don't walk on leashes! They just sit stare/chase things. Wait until 6 months for real leash training. For now, you'll just have to give positive rewards when she does something good and be very, very patient. 

The other advice I'd have is to do some crate training with filled kongs (to teach more independence-- 2-3 hrs tops) and socializing with other people AND puppies (if she's vaccinated). Socializing is really important so she sees other people/dogs aren't scary. Dogs that are too bonded to their masters and aren't properly socialized to different situations, people, and animals become very territorial and aggressive in adulthood."
amildiazu,fdryko6,t1_fdrsv5m,"I can get her to hang out in the doggie pen with a PB kong for about 90 secs before whimpering starts.

When she starts to whimper do I let her out immediately so she doesn't get negative associations with the pen, or do I let her whine?"
amildiazu,fdrwyx3,t1_fdrsv5m,>Thanks so much. I will keep on the positive reinforcement and definitely need to work on some crate time.  She's met dozens of dogs and has made a few doggie friends. Same with people.
sarahmgray,fds87iq,t1_fdryko6,"Don’t let her out. You are rewarding the action (whining) by giving her what she wants (out). By letting her out when she whines, you are actively teaching her to whine."
yourmomismysidepiece,fdsnnxc,t1_fdryko6,"Make the kong full of things it takes longer to eat like frozen kibble and water/chicken broth. Never take a dog out of its crate when its whining, it will learn it can whine to get out. Start crate training in 10 min increments. Make going INTO the crate exciting and when you take her out be very boring (don't greet her/pet her/get her excited). Leave her in for 10 mins and leave the room, when she stops whining go let her out. Keep doing this and build 10 min to 20 min, to 30 to 45... etc. She shouldn't be in the crate for longer than 3-4 hours at a time. Once you do this training, it will get much better after a week of it."
DappleDoxi,fdsk8w3,t1_fdryko6,"In the beginning of crate training we spent time on the floor by the crate with the pup inside eating a kong and the door open. To this day, the crate is their safe place. Also, they get a treat every time they are asked to go in and it is not used as punishment, ever!  You cam also feed him in the crate to make a positive connection with the crate."
yourmomismysidepiece,fdrxaqd,t1_fdrwyx3,"By the way, dogs shouldn't do long runs until they're at least 1 year old. Sprints are fine, just be careful about it being on the hard concrete. Good luck!"
SandyDelights,fdsm048,t1_fds87iq,"^ If she’s the type who will *never* stop whining, you should be letting her out *before* she whines.

Same way we break dogs of separation anxiety – if your dog cries 30 seconds after you leave, come back 25 seconds after leaving, ignore them, act like everything’s normal, repeat the behavior over time and slowly increase the time as you can."
amildiazu,fdwjfql,t1_fdsnnxc,>I was doing some training with her last night and she was barking and being a little too rambunctious. I tried being boring and it worked right away!
exotics,fdrldeu,t3_emtbul,Those dogs are super intelligent. They benefit from mental stimulation. For now you can take proper obedience classes with her to stimulate her mind AND get her bonded with you. I know you are working on training at home but going to classes will help.  Then perhaps agility or something more.  She may smell chemicals from your wife and that’s why she’s focused on her. So give pupper a new focus.
lokiisacat,fdrc55t,t3_emtbul,"My dog is super attached to me as well. My husband he doesn't care about its werid. My hubd gives him treats when he wants him to do something, and it workes.

My dog still loves me, and wants to be aeound me at all times, but it's better when I have to go to the bathroom or want to hang out with friends."
Mozie23,fdrgtzw,t3_emtbul,"I would use the clicker to teach her to walk with you just like you used it for other ""tricks"".  For the next 7 to 10 days, drive to the trail head.  For day 1, take 10 steps in the direction you want to go, click and give a treat (or maybe only 5 steps).  Take another 10 steps, click and give a treat.  Keep going and slowly increase the distance you walk before clicking and giving a treat.  Teach your pup that walking in the direction you want her to go is a fun game and she gets rewarded when she does what you want.  Every day you go to the trail head, just keep increasing the distance little by little.  I'm sure she didn't sit, shake paw or go to her bed the first time every time.  Treat the walk as the same thing that needs to be learned.  She may not do it perfectly every time, but when she does the number of steps you want her to do then click and give a treat.  

After the 10 days, do the same thing with a walk out the front door.  You may have to go back to 10 steps at a time.  Whatever it takes to keep her going in the direction you want her to go, then click and give a treat.  It's going to be a slow process at first, but after a bit she'll get the hang of it.  If you are giving her exercise and rewarding her good behavior then she's going to want to be with you on the walk more than sitting in a room with your wife.

Obviously, you don't want to be feeding her tons of treats every day, but I think you will only have to do this over and over again for the first little while.  After a bit, you could probably get to the point where you only need to give her a treat at the end of the walk and then eventually none at all."
FredsHoomin,fds82nb,t3_emtbul,"If she walks back to the car next time pick her up walk far away from the car and then put the pup down and walk back. 

A lot of dogs do this when they are young. My dog always wanted to go back home so we carried him to the end of the road and let him walk back home. 

After a while they are comfortable exploring a little bit more."
halfpastcinco,fdseqb9,t3_emtbul,"My puppy was very attached to me and so I stopped training with her for a few weeks so that she would bond with my boyfriend. Now she listens to both of us *almost* equally. She still prefers me but I spend a lot of time with her so it make sense but she hangs out with him without looking for me. Try treats for walks, it takes patience as she is experiencing slog of new things at 4 months old. Don’t coddle her when she gets scared because you might reinforce the behavior so just keep the walls short and sweet. She will come around with time."
abrookman1987,fdsg7q2,t3_emtbul,Also pooches can take it upon themselves to ‘protect’ vulnerable family members.  They can get quite distressed if kept away from their duty
VoraBora,fdt6ztk,t3_emtbul,"Hi! I’m a professional trainer that specializes (among other things) in puppy raising.
I also have a 16 week old puppy right now, so I have an immediate clarity about what this age is like. 
First, remember that your puppy is very young. Please don’t run with puppy on leash at this age and keep walks short. The majority of exercise at this stage should be offleash in a safe place where the puppy can drive the pace. Mental stimulation will do more for puppy energy than any exercise, and will have the bonus of bonding you and the puppy in a major way. The best interactive mental stimulation you can do at this age is obedience and trick training. Keep sessions short (5-10 minutes max) and frequent.
I would not expect many leash skills at this age, but would expect to have several basic obedience commands and a solid recall - for reference."
Tarynnickle,fdt813l,t3_emtbul,"I have a chronic autoimmune disease and have had some pets bond with me in the same manner.  By no means am I an expert, but there's the possibility the reason your puppy is so attached is because your wife is ill.  Some animals are just very receptive to things like this.  I've had a cat and two dogs that refuse to leave my side when I have a flare up.  One of the dogs actually allows me to use him as a support and lean against him (he's a big boy).

I'm sorry I have no advice, but maybe someone else has experience with animals sensitive to their humans and might be able to recommend ideas."
amildiazu,fdwkh6x,t1_fdt813l,>Your gonna make me cry! My parents are involved with an equine therapy program so I have utmost respect for the healing intelligence of animals. My wife is also a gifted healer by nature so I am sure the pup and her bond to some degree on a level that's beyond comprehension.
coolmarypoppins,fdu4rwo,t3_emtbul,"A few tricks that might help :

Instead of feeding the pup breakfast, bring her kibble on the walk with you and feed it to her for keeping heel and practicing good manners. 

You decide the pace of the walk and the direction. If she digs her heels in, apply light leash tension and wait for her. When she makes a move in the right direction (ex - - taking a step toward you) release the leash and give her praise. If she pulls toward home, stand still and let her increase tension on the lead. Same as before, release leash tension and praise her when she moves toward you. She might be stubborn the first few times (like a ""we walked 50 ft in a half hour""), but she'll quickly learn that going with you is fun and going home isn't an option.

Your wife = world's best reinforcer. Whining and crying = access to your wife. 
Try to reprogram this so whining and crying = having to do a boring down-stay and being quiet and polite = you/your wife gives attention. If it's too early in the morning to use access to your wife as a reward, give the pup a routine so she knows ""after I do A, B, and C, THEN I get to see my mom"" 

You and your wife can still give affection to the pup but it should have some limits - - don't rush to greet the puppy as soon as you enter the room and don't give the dog attention whenever she wants it. The goal is for your pup to learn to be OK with being alone and to learn how to be calm on her own."
callofthewildcanines,fdvieyb,t3_emtbul,"Also important to note, she is only 4 months old! Things with improve with age/confidence. MOST puppies in my classes have issues with not wanting to walk or stray from home, that goes away with a bit of time and maturity : )"
Mozzafan07,fdskbia,t3_emtbul,"Have you tried trying to create an obsession with a squeaky toy? Not a bad obsession but one that your dog associates with a good time. This item can be uses as a reward at times too. Start out in a safe environment when your dog feels content and able to focus, find the toy that your dog really likes preferably with a squeak (kong tennis balls are great) get your dog excited about play with the item and have a lovely game of fetch or whatever your dog enjoys most and then end the game in a good way (fuss your dog and praise them) after a short time. Build on this, use the squeak to get your dogs attention and initiate play/good time, make it so that you dog really gets excited about interacting with you and the toy. 
Try a short walk, when the dog becomes upset squeak the toy and try and engage in a fun activity (hopefully it works as it should but this depends on the dog's state of mind) after ending the fun by removing the toy and praising the dog continue forward a little and then return back. Your dog will know the walk was a good one and it had nothing to worry about. 
Repeat this until your dog knows the squeak means fun and at times you can use this noise just to get your dogs attention (Remember to use it for fun at least 1 out of 5 times at this point or the dog may lose interest and it's not nice if you keep getting teased) 
I have a kong ball in my pocket when I go on walks with my dog and use it on occasion when I want to reward him for a good behaviour, every now and then after crossing a road nicely I surprise him with praise and the ball (it's different to his fetch ball we use regularly so he knows its special) I also know that if he stops when crossing the road for any reason at all like some kind of distraction hes never encountered before, I squeak the ball and hes right next to me full attention and ready for action. 
I hope that offers you another option to try. 

Things you may already know or have tried, feed your dog after exercise, don't over exercise your dog (rough guide is 5mins per month of age until fully grown) I only say this as you mentioned running, let your dog acclimatise to their surroundings: smells, sights and sounds, is the dogs collar, harness and lead causing an issue (comfortable for them to wear and they feel ok having it on, no fear about it being on as it represents a bad thing currently for the dog) 

Anyway I've rambled on enough and really do hope some of this has helped in some way. 

Good luck and remember some things take time 😊"
Scaaaary_Ghost,fdsxqfm,t3_emtbul,"My dog really bonded with me (accidentally) when I was the one to take him to his training class. My partner did a ton of at-home training with the dog, but I think having a professional trainer teach me how to ""read"" my dog really helped the dog to instinctively trust me in a way he hadn't before. 

So, while it sounds like you're doing great at training your dog at home, it might be worth enrolling the dog and yourself in something more advanced and fun that lets a pro teach you and your dog to work together better. In my case we did a ""confidence class"" for dogs with solid basic training skills that just emphasized good behavior and improved socialization in unfamiliar and potentially scary situations, but something like nosework or job-related training would also probably work really well."
mel_iliad,fdukmx4,t3_emtbul,"I agree with the post that said that you have to be the source of all things fun for a month.  I would also use mat training.  The idea is that when the mat is present, the dog is on it with their mouth in the ""off"" position.  You will start in the house, until you can put that mat anywhere.  There are probably all sorts of good videos on the internet to show you how to accomplis this.  It will take time but eventually in a couple of months when the dog is more willing to engage with you, you should be able to take the dog into the out building where you work and put the mat down and it should be content to hang out with you on the mat."
ApollosWeed,fdsxo9x,t3_emtbul,"Positive reinforcement dog trainer here, who also has been living with MS since 1999.  It sounds like your puppy is developing separation anxiety.  She sounds hyper-attached to your wife.  This is common in herding breeds.  They get hyper-attached to one person and it becomes hard for them to function without that person.  It is a dog that is suffering because it bonds so close to their owner it is like part of them is missing when that person isn't there and they can't function.  It would be best to talk to a vet behaviorist, not just any old behaviorist or dog trainer that calls themselves a behaviorist.  Be careful there are a lot of people that call themselves behaviorists.  You NEED a VET behaviorist that can prescribe medication if needed.  Building confidence by doing some positive reinforcement dog training will help.  Also have your wife not be the only one that cuddles, trains and plays with the dog.  Have her do less of the cuddling and put it on her terms so the puppy can start getting used to cuddling, training and playing with other family members.  Here is a good link with an article about this.  Please read it, I think it will help you understand that this puppy is actually suffering when they are not with that person, even if they are with another person keeping them company.  Please see a vet behaviorist as soon as possible so you can help desensitize and counter condition before it gets severe.  Please read this article...

ApollosWeed,fdt2bip,t1_fdsxo9x,"Oh, and low key entrances and exits help.  Saying good bye and stuff like I will be back soon, just set the puppy up for separation anxiety.  They start to really anticipate your return.  It is best just to toss a kong stuffed with peanut butter or something tasty as you just leave.  Don't say anything.  Then when you return, don't run to the dog first thing.  Instead, go to the bathroom, take 5 minutes to be home, then go to the dog (assuming it is crated).  This will help prevent it from getting worse."

holdnarrytight,eo5z8s,top_level,"My dog is a 2 year old male Yorkshire Terrier. My dad got him as a birthday gift for my then 10 year old sister. My parents don't even like dogs and my sister wasn't old enough to take care of him. I was 17 then and didn't know anything about dogs. Needless to say, he didn't get the care he needed. He wasn't socialized at all as a pup, barely leaving the house, and since then he showed signs of being afraid of people such as crying when strangers tried to touch him. As soon as he was old enough to bark, he started taking on a more aggressive attitude when seeing strangers. He barks when he hears voices on the other side of the door. A knock on the door sends him into full on madness. When I take him on walks, he barks at people on the same sidewalk as us and pulls hard on the leash to try to go at them. When we have guests over, we have to lock him away and he'll keep barking for hours on end as long as the guests are still here. He won't bite and will always calm down if people let him smell them. I know deep down he's actually scared of people and just trying to protect me. I'm responsible for him. What can I do to make him friendlier to strangers? He's a really sweet and loyal friend to the family and loves getting attention, licking and being pet. He's only like this with strangers, becomes a totally different dog. It makes me sad that he can't enjoy meeting new people and I kinda feel like it's too late to help him"
jfranklinhayes,fe8y4y2,t3_eo5z8s,"Very slowly, never push too hard for him to meet people and always make the transaction pleasant and rewarding for him. Progressive desensitization. It is also worth saying that all dogs don’t have to be social he isn’t in need of new people necessarily, just quality experiences with the ones he knows.

I would suggest you find a local obedience trainer . Some rules will go a long way too."

2 years is not too late to help him.  You can’t really “cure” reactivity in the same way that you can’t cure anxiety and depression in people, but you can absolutely manage it and alleviate many of the issues so that your dog can lead a more comfortable life. 

This is done with desensitization, counterconditioning (changing their emotional response by pairing their triggers with strong positive stimuli) and training.

Once you have this down at home, you can bring treats on walks and ask anyone who wants to pet him to throw him a treat when he’s not barking or jumping and then let him approach. This should help a lot over time. Good luck."
ksenisan00,fe9ao36,t3_eo5z8s,"watching ""It's Me or the Dog"" on youtube really helped me with training my pup. I would highly recommend going through their videos, they have quite a few cases of protective/anxious dogs, and ways to deal with it. Good luck!"
ab-c19,fe9ngc5,t3_eo5z8s,"Teach him that he doesn't have to interact with people. I had a dog that just didn't like people, he'd tolerate them if he had to but you could tell he'd rather not have them fawning over him. So we gave him a safe space.we used a travel kennel to train him with a small flat bed. At first it was the whole kennel and he liked it because he got a cool Kong or bone and left alone.  A few weeks later we took the door off, kept giving him treats and praise, kept telling people to leave him alone. A few weeks later we took the bottom off so he'd get used to just the bed under him. A few weeks later we took the top off too.

Now the important part about this is that that bed is HIS safe space, so NOBODY goes into it, except for the person he trusts the most. So you have to stick up for your dog and when people are around tell them that they can't touch the dog when he's in his safe space.
If he ever comes out of his space nicely while people are over though, give him lots of treats."
holdnarrytight,fe9ri86,t1_fe9ngc5,"My dog actually loves people and is all over them once he gets to know them better. He's sweet and absolutely loves getting attention. The thing is, he needs to SMELL people first and then he absolutely calms down. If he can't do it, he just won't calm down and stop barking until they leave. My dog won't bite. He barks, runs over to the person, smells their feet and then instantly calms down. And the problem is that most people wouldn't like to have a dog bark and lunge at them, because they're scared of getting bitten. But you gave me an idea! What if I buy a crate and, when we have guests over, instead of locking him away in an isolated room, I keep him in the crate in the room where the guests are and have them interact with him a little bit. Do you think that would work? That way he can smell their hands, get treats and rubs and then once I think he's calm enough I can let him out!"
ab-c19,fe9zgik,t1_fe9ri86,That sounds like an amazing option for your dog. I would suggest covering the crate if your dog gets too upset or asking if you can cover the front of the crate with their jacket/sweatshirt. When you're confident that he's ready to come out just make sure that your dog starts the interaction with people.
hiphopogriff,fecdwau,t1_fe9ri86,I have similar problems with my pup being overly excited/bordering on fearful aggression with strangers. When I have people come over I put her in her crate in the living room and it does help for her to see and smell people from a safe place. when she is calm she can come out for pets and treats and then she is all snuggles.
mhmthatsmyshh,fec9gu1,t1_fe9ri86,"My silky acts exactly like your dog! She's almost 8 years old, but thankfully still very receptive to learning new things. Your baby being 2yo is definitely not too old. I recently found a [few methods on Wag](https://wagwalking.com/training/be-calm-around-strangers) and one is similar to what you've described above.

overweightdogpolice,fe9l96v,t3_eo5z8s,"I see a lot of really good comments about desensitizing, which is perfect. But how is his obedience training? 


Obedience is the foundation of all training, starting a desensitizing protocol is great! But if he doesn't know what you want him to do.... desensitizing him might not go as quickly as you'd like it, especially if he doesn't know what you are asking him to do (sitting quietly instead of barking). 


Basically my recommendation is to teach a preferred behavior (like ""sit on your bed"") as opposed to the behavior you don't want (""bark like a madman"")."
holdnarrytight,fe9lfiy,t1_fe9l96v,"He knows two commands. ""Sit"" and ""Off"". He's a bit stubborn though and usually only obeys after I tell him twice or more"
overweightdogpolice,fe9or2v,t1_fe9lfiy,"That's a good start!! I would see if you can get him to do those on the first try, treat him like a puppy and start from square one if he needs a little more direction. 


Helpful too for walks and reacting on leash: teach him focus/look at me (pick your fave word and watch a YouTube video on how to teach this) so you can draw his attention away from the thing he reacts to. That should help shape a more positive behavior instead of barking (and being stressed out). 


If you can find his favorite motivator it will be easier. Maybe this is food, a ball/toy, or affection."
302Laya,febl2fy,t1_fe9lfiy,"I suggest you avoid repeating a command. It teaches him that he can ignore you if he wants to. If he does not obey the first time, lure him into the command with a treat but do not reward. If he does obey the first time, reward immediately. Like this you are teaching him that he always has to listen to you the first time. Hope that helps :)"
Jun-02,feb7ks9,t1_fe9lfiy,"Exactly like my dog, except it was my fault, I got my GS at 15 and didnt know about big dogs.  So now that I want to socialize and train him its tough."
Mjlovesbananas,fecodrg,t1_fe9or2v,I once read somewhere on here ‘find something they would sell their soul for’ and that is now my motto for training lol.
AmbitiousButLost,fe9ak9f,t3_eo5z8s,"My dog is a 2 year old border collie mix.  She spent a year in the shelter and it took us all of the last year to get her to tolerate most people after we got her.  Most of the difference came as a combination of working really hard at socialization and obedience.  The amount of info on that is abundant and I will spare you the details. 

Some tricks I've found out that might help you that worked with my dog:
Create a routine around meeting new people.  Start with the people she knows (not the family, but people she frequently meets) and likes and she will start to generalize the routine to other 'friendlies'.  With my dog, it really helps to have her come into the people rather than the other way around.  A lot of times I trick her by taking her out to pee right as the guests arrive so that they are already inside when my dog comes back in. 

Another thing is to start getting very aware of your dogs 'triggers' and his 'signs and symptoms'.  You have to be a lot smarter than your dog to win at this game.  It's easy to make behaviors but it's hard to break them.  You need to train on the feelings and the body language and not the actions.  By the time they are acting on feeling, it's too late.  

My last piece of advice (and I would say this is the most important by far) is that you need to think about what your dog seeks to gain with their negative behaviors and make sure that they do not ever get their way.  If your dog barks/snaps/growls and you remove them or the people who are targeted remove themselves or whatever, your dog reinforces the idea that being mean will result in the discomfort of meeting others to end.  Always be careful with this because your dog is a liability and make others aware of the fact that they are in a training situation, but make sure you are not letting your dog continue to train in the wrong behaviors.  

This is an uphill battle but it is winnable with LOTS of patience and LOTS of love.  I'm rooting for you."
CountingSatellites,fe9qidu,t1_fe9ak9f,"While I agree with many of your points, I will disagree that removing the dog from the situation reinforces negative behavior. You want the dog to learn to move away or remove themselves from the situation when they feel uncomfortable. You want them to know that they can retreat to a safe space where people are not going to approach them."
AmbitiousButLost,fe9r4t7,t1_fe9qidu,I do agree with this to some extent also.  It's balance!  My dog would've been at many points unlikely to remove themselves but would certainly be willing to aggress to remove others.  A lot different situation now.  I'm not a pro dog trainer or anything!  Just my experience!  Beat wishes!
CountingSatellites,fe9v5ty,t1_fe9r4t7,"I think there’s an important distinction between allowing a dog to aggress to remove others and removing the dog. I do agree that the former does reinforce negative behavior- they learn that aggressive behavior gives them space. I would say that the better move is to have the people stay where they are (provided that they are not actively trying to invade the dog’s space), and instead calmly and gently lead the dog away and reward when you’ve created a comfortable distance."
AmbitiousButLost,fe9vi1s,t1_fe9v5ty,Yes absolutely we are on the same page
SongRiverFlow,fe9009b,t3_eo5z8s,We have basically the exact same dog. I could have written this post. You need to see a vet with a background in behavior to talk about meds like fluoxetine (Prozac) and find a positive reinforcement trainer with experience with reactive dogs. Karen Pryor trainers are a good place to start. Depending on where you live I might be able to recommend some if you’re interested. I went through a few trainers before I found the one I have now and she changed my life with my dog.
randomlytypingaway,fea6ivx,t3_eo5z8s,"My great dane used to be very very weary of strangers (we got him at 8 weeks so that was just his personality, he didn't even want to interact with us when we met him before taking him home). 

When we started socialization the first strangers took about 30 minutes to an hour for him to get comfortable.  Then it slowly went down to 15 minutes to 10 then to 5, and now he can get comfortable with strangers in a matter of minutes.  However it is a very specific way of meeting people that allows him to realize they are not threats and then he is wanting to play play play (your dog may not want to play with strangers, but just being alright).

What works for our dog is for people to just ignore him. He will bark at first if you are coming into the house, but then we wants to sniff.  We have people not pet him immediately and let him sniff, and we tell them to just ignore him and not talk to him.  Then, after ample sniffing time, he will get into play mode (but he is still scared if you play too much with him).  However, we can have parties now and he will not be anxious and will be interacting with everyone.  You can use food too (I usually do that if it's a stanger at a pet store that is a one time interaction), and I tend to make sure that he sees me touching the person and having good interactions with them as well. 

The only exception is the vet... No amount of positive reinforcement has been able to get him to be okay with people at the vet.  I think he just associated them at such a young age with poking and prodding and is not okay with that. 

Keep it positive, don't let people try to pet your dog until ready (and with smaller dogs people are more likely going to want to do that)!  You are your pets advocate and protector so make sure you do what you can to make each interaction good! 

It might not be that he will like that person, but may no longer see them as a threat!

Sounds like your pup will settle after a while based on what you said, so I think that just working with them as you have been (but very consistently), you cna turn it around.  I would even try to schedule people to come over (like friends) for just this reason so you can help have control over the environment (making sure things  aren't too loud as they are meeting, having high value treats ready, etc)."
ohayimtay,feacnxn,t3_eo5z8s,"Check out the CARE program for reactive dogs. I've seen lots of success with it. Other than that, you have some good info here in the comments!"
ZebraHunterz,feafn5r,t3_eo5z8s,"One thought is that when you are meeting someone new. Pick up your dog, it may make it feel safer for you to hold it. The other reason is that dogs need to see peoples/dogs eyes to evaluate the new person and themselves within the pack. Being a small dog it can be hard for them to see someones eyes and most people won't crouch down to the dogs level. They have to default to defensive (or jumpy for some) because of uncertainty. I'm tall and have found getting to face level helps with meeting dogs. Good luck!"
302Laya,febkf55,t3_eo5z8s,"My best advice to you would be to practice, practice, practice! You will have to teach him how you want him to react in those situations, and the only way of doing that is actually letting experience them. Something that I learned in obedience class is that you basically have 2 options: 1) manage your dog's behavior 2) manage your dog's environment. In other words, you have to teach him how you want him to behave and do not give him the opportunity to misbehave. Dogs also go through lots of phases, for example, chewing on shoes. Do not let him have access to shoes (manage environment) and he'll get over this phase much faster like this, vs you constantly chasing him to get the shoe (which he perceives as a game even if you're yelling ""NO""). Sometimes it's more than a phase, such as in your case, he is always barking at people. You can't keep people out of your house, and you can't just lock him away every time someone comes over. So in this case, you want to manage his behavior. Have a family member or friend knock on the door / ring the bell. Have your dog on a leash so that he cannot run away from you. If he does not react, reward him. If he reacts, redirect him with a treat/toy (don't give it to him though). If he does not redirect, ignore him until he stops, wait 1s and then reward. I know it seems counterintuitive, but you are not rewarding the barking, you are rewarding the _stopping_ of the barking. I suggest you add a verbal command to this. If he barks, say (don't yell) your command firmly once (e.g. ""quiet"") and wait for him to stop. Once he stops, wait 1s and reward. It may or may not take a while, but once he gets the hang of it, you can increase the time 1s at a time and eventually ween him off the treats.  You will have better success if you have a really irresistible treat, and it only needs to be a small amount each time. Peanut butter (natural), cheese, chicken, etc. The smellier the better! Try this in 5-10m sessions several times a day and you will see results! Any training session will be easier if your dog is exercised. He's more likely to focus on you if he's not bursting with energy. Always have treats at hand, even if you're not doing a training session, so that you can reward good behavior. Remember, attention is also a reward so the less you shower him with attention, the more valuable your attention will be to him. If you lose progress, don't get frustrated, but instead take a step back and always try to set your dog up for success. You can apply this to any other behavioral training aspects, just remember practice, patience, and consistency!

Side story: I have a 1 year old German Shepherd who would constantly nip and bite for attention any time we sit on the couch to watch tv. As frustrating as it was, every time he would start, I would redirect him with his tug toy until eventually he would skip the biting and just bring his tug toy to me, which is much more preferable! At this point, if he slips up, I can just say ""where's your toy"" and he'll stop nipping and go get it. It took practice, patience, and consistency, and it paid off!

Side story 2: My husband's coworker has a small terrier that would also go nuts when the doorbell rang. So to address this, they would ring the bell, immediately reward, and repeat. He would bark at first, but after like the 20th ring he would just go to them for a treat when the bell rang. Even though it took about 20 rings to stop the barking, they've been practicing for weeks to reinforce the good behavior. You can try this method too, but teaching the quiet command is far more useful because it addresses the actual _barking_ and the command can be applied to other scenarios. Just remember that dogs understand context first before they can grasp concept, so practice that ""quiet"" command with anything that makes him bark, not just the doorbell.

Hope this helps!"
hypetastic54,febqvdb,t3_eo5z8s,"Had a professional work with us for this EXACT reason.

Whenever we went for walks, we would keep our distance from people, and whenever my dog looked at the people, I would click and reward him with a tasty treat. (refer to clicker training if you haven't heard about it). From there, it was just endless clicks during our walks. Eventually we would walk closer to people but as soon as my dog started showing signs of aggression/fear, I was instructed to hold him by the collar so that I have more control of him and this would keep him calm.

Hope this somewhat gives you an idea on where to start. My biggest advice is to learn your dog's body language so you can prevent/limit him from having the undesired reaction.

Good luck and happy training!"

MadnessHarnessed,elx57n,top_level,"Some background: Shes a miniature dachshund rescue who we adopted when she was 1.5 years old. When we adopted her we couldn't touch her, pet her, pretty much anything without her either shutting down completely or lashing out with teeth. Harness and leash? Oh forget it right now. It took a month for me to even get her wearing a collar, which I insisted on for safety should she ever get away from us. Over the year and half that we have had her she has made huge strides and is such a lovable little dog now. She still has her moments but shes more likely to growl first now instead of immediately snapping. 

Its only been the last few weeks that we finally got her to the point where she will wear her harness and walk outside on leash. Shes still nervous at first when we start the walk but she comes around pretty quick and really seems to enjoy it once were out there. When I added her bigger fur brother (15lbs to her 6) she seemed even more confident and was happily trotting alongside him, sniffing where he sniffed etc. While I was on break I was taking them out for a walk in the early afternoon, which worked great for her. She sleeps most of the morning with how cold its been lately, so the early afternoon walks before lunch were a great way to drain her of all the pent up energy. 

Now that Im back at work though, I can't take her in the afternoon and when I try in the morning she is NOT happy. She was ""ok"" Monday morning, but this morning she actively hid from me after her Breakfast, Im guessing because she knows thats when I usually take her fur brother and she doesn't want to go along. 

I forced it Tuesday, but my partner told me not to take her today if she so obviously doesn't want to go. He plays with her a lot while Im at work, and I rarely come home to being overly energetic, so I know its not that shes not getting exercise. I was taught though that a daily walk, regardless of the dogs size, is extremely important for their physical and mental well being. 

I suppose I could just take her out on the weekends only, when I usually take her fur brother out in the early afternoon anyways, but I'm concerned about how well that would work when were still trying to get her acclimated and more confident on leash. Also, I tend to take her fur brother to more varied places on the weekends like the dog park, hiking trails, etc that she is definitely not ready for. But my partner made a good point as well, that we don't want her to become afraid to go out all over again by forcing the issue when she really does not want to go. 

TLDR: My rescue likes walks once shes out and about but really doesn't want to get up in the morning to go and so Im having to force it. Partner thinks this is a bad idea, and shes so small she doesnt need daily walks anyway. I disagree and think its important for her overall health. Am I just being too strict and its not really necessary for her?"
AngelDoee3,fdkwokg,t3_elx57n,"Sounds like your dog needs a winter jacket and not just a sweater. If this is introduced slowly by letting her first see the jacket, then smell it, then getting petted with it and finally putting it on with treats for positive reactions at each stage this shouldn’t be a problem. Once she’s warm and wearing the jacket is a positive experience then you should have no problem walking her."
MadnessHarnessed,fdl4vrn,t1_fdkwokg,"Thank you for the suggestion. Im thinking that with winter here yea, we need to do that reconditioning too. Which means she might not yet really be ready for daily walks and I just got a little over excited at her progress."

I don't push it too much because honestly he loves her to death and they play soooo much during the day. Yesterday I came home and she didn't even wake up to say hi to me she was so tired from their rousing game of fetch from the yard through the house lol."
zyxfm,fdlpj0f,t1_fdl98g4,It sounds like she is getting exercise then? And maybe there's no need to force a walk?
MadnessHarnessed,fdlqjcg,t1_fdlpj0f,"Thats what he's saying, though I think walks are important not just for exercise but mental and social enrichment. Though from the comments Im seeing so far, I think its probably good for he and I to meet in the middle on this and just take her out when its more comfortable outside (mid afternoon) and also when she actually seems interested. She does get a lot of exercise and attention at home. He and I work different schedules so neither dog is ever at home alone for more than 4 hours tops."
zyxfm,fdmdmx8,t1_fdlqjcg,"walks are definitely really really important, but mental enrichment can come in many different ways that she might welcome. Snuffle mats, puzzle toys, licky mats etc  can be great for dogs who are confined for whatever reason"
rockingrappunzel,fdl7ry2,t3_elx57n,"I'd actually agree with your partner that actually she doesn't have to be walked every day and she can still be healthy and happy.

Dog walks were invented as a way to combine various things that dogs need - physical exercise, mental stimulation, socialisation, and the opportunity to relieve themselves. These are actually all things that your dog can get at home. As an owner of an incredibly anxious reactive dog, I know the importance of giving her breaks from walks sometimes. And in fact we never go out at weekends because she just can't cope with all the people that are out. She's totally happy and healthy staying at home though. It's not something you should feel guilty about. Its all about what's best for doggo AND you."
MadnessHarnessed,fdl8wn3,t1_fdl7ry2,"Thank you for posting this! This makes me feel a lot better about taking it slower with her and letting her decide the pace a bit. She is a very happy little dog and gets lots of playtime at home so its not for lack of exercise. I do worry about her keeping her socialized, but we also regularly have people over and shes gotten loads better with visitors. I do have a small yard too, so walks are not a neccesity for her to relieve herself or to get some sun every once in a while. I bought a patch of fake grass for her when she was still refusing to even look at a harness so that she could have something soft under her paws too (my yard is mostly gravel). During the summer she loves laying in the sun on it."
rockingrappunzel,fdlbh5s,t1_fdl8wn3,Awesome :) and giving her the choice and listening to what she wants is actually a pretty good thing to build her confidence. You can also work on training her to love walks (using lots of yummy treats and fun games/play!) but don't need to push it and can go at her pace.
heywhatsyourproblem,fdkyki7,t3_elx57n,Are you bribing her with food? (Also known as training lol)- my lazy ass dog would not want to come out in the evening... until I made that the only time in a day he gets treated for relieving himself 😂
MadnessHarnessed,fdl8hyh,t1_fdkyki7,"I've tried food but shes a little weird about treats. Loves them, but shes super nervous about taking food from human hands. I usually have to put the treat on the floor for her. She won't even take chew sticks directly from me. When shes out on a walk shes almost always either too nervous to eat or too interested in smelling something to pay attention much to what Im offering."
heywhatsyourproblem,fdl9upp,t1_fdl8hyh,"Yeah she’s gotta start trusting you to be bribable- I’d start hand feeding her all her meals.. but going back to your original question, she’ll be okay without that stressful walk if it’s hassle for you both rather than enjoyment x"
waffle-please,fdlpv7l,t1_fdl8hyh,I have an anxious dog and while he will take treats from me he can sometimes just be really weird about it. Trying to treat him while we're walking is annoying because he wants to stop and sniff it carefully every time lol. She may just never become fully comfortable with it.
fourleafclover13,fdldxmm,t1_fdl8hyh,"They should be allowed to smell on walks. I alway say first half of walk is all moving second half is smelly time. I'd sad for her health daily walks are needed get some boots and a jacket for her if could. 

You can also add puzzles, more bonding time, find toys. For bonding sit in the floor and toss some treats. Over time toss closer to you until you can drop right in front of you. Give some pets and scratched. Do this daily for a while. I suggest Zules treats and summer sausage."
heywhatsyourproblem,fdldw46,t1_fdldjwp,"Yeah thanks for clarification, clearly that wasn’t a joke"
MadnessHarnessed,fdlabgv,t1_fdl9upp,"Thank you! Though I think she would starve if I tried to hand feed her lol. She also has to eat wet food at least once a day because she doesn't drink enough water for her digestion to be happy, so I'd rather not hand feed that :P 

I do add treats randomly to her bowl as she eats though and shes slowly, carefully, sometimes, taking a treat from my palm as long as I stay very still. Im not sure what made certain things so scary for her. All in all shes grown a lot and has given me a lot more trust now than when we first got her."
MadnessHarnessed,fdlqsqo,t1_fdlpv7l,"Yea I gave up entirely on giving her treats out on walks or in places shes unfamiliar because shes just too stimulated at the time to really even want them. She is getting better at taking treats, strangely, from our friends but still not quite there with us."
MadnessHarnessed,fdleqdl,t1_fdldxmm,Thats how it works for my 15lb male. The first part of the walk (which is conveniently also kinda boring for him) is walk time. We are hustling. Once we turn down a side street headed towards the local park he knows its more smelling time. For her I let her set the pace at the moment as shes still getting used to the leash. We stop and sniff when something catches her attention and then hustle off again. Walking with her fur brother has helped her structure a bit more since he gets impatient with her stopping too much lol.
mikeber55,fdkswh4,t3_elx57n,"First, you should check with a vet that she doesn’t have a medical problem. 

Second, why can’t you walk her with the other dog? It will add to her confidence and willingness to walk. Also maybe it’s too cold for her early in the morning? Some dogs suffer from that more than others."
MadnessHarnessed,fdktw2a,t1_fdkswh4,"Definitely did that first :) 

She does have bad knees in her back legs. Not bad enough for surgery, but if she doesn't strengthen them with regular exercise and keep lean we may end up having to. Shes already on a supplement, and I waited about a two months for the supplement to really start helping (not seeing her run and lifting a leg anymore for example) before we started trying to walk outside at all. 

And I absolutely walk her with my other dog! Its more that if we only walk on weekends it means adding an extra walk for him so that he can still go to places like the dog park/hikes/beach etc, and gets the daily walk with her. I am concerned that maybe winter is just too cold for her to comfortably be outside. She does have a sweater but she doesnt like wearing it, and Im not really surprised considering how many harnesses I bought and went through finding the one that shes most ok with."
LifeInTheGrey,fdmqkar,t3_elx57n,Instead of walking you can do 30 minutes of play. Forcing a dog to walk can turn walks into a negative thing for them. I had several days where neighbor's dogs charged my dog and I. It took me several weeks before I could get him on walks. A dog park is another idea for energy release. I'd look around for an indoor dog park if you live in a big city.
MadnessHarnessed,fdokye1,t1_fdmqkar,Thanks for the suggestions! I am trying to get her into an indoor adult small dog playgroup for some socialization thats a little more structured than simply going to the dog park. I do worry about her running into a dog on our walks because some of my neighbors dogs are not very friendly. She definitely gets more like an hour to two hours of play.
LifeInTheGrey,fdolieh,t1_fdokye1,She's probably okay not to go on walks. I would mention that Dachshunds especially the miniature ones are very fragile due to how long their spines are. Over walking these kind of dogs can lead to joint issues. If you let the dog on the couch or bed I would recommend getting stairs because of this as well.
MadnessHarnessed,fdomea6,t1_fdolieh,"Oh yea. We actually got rid of one set we had because the steps were just a little too steep for her and she was having to jump up too much for my liking. 

Ive had a couple Dachshunds growing up so Im aware of their common health risks, just never had one this small. But my Mom rly wasnt the ""shining beacon"" of dog care so Im constantly trying to learn more about the breed so I can do right by her. 

She had a rough start in life so I want whats best for her without adding undue stress."
ScentedSarcasm,fdl12vy,t3_elx57n,"Does she have access to your garden? If so, I don't see a big problem. Sure, exercise is important and for most dogs that includes mental stimulation through scents in the neighbourhood, but I know a few dogs that are perfectly content inside their home / garden for most of the time or are simply not morning dogs and prefer to sleep in."
MadnessHarnessed,fdl89d4,t1_fdl12vy,"We dont have much of a yard as we live in an apartment but its definitely big enough that she can run around and play fetch. Ive started growing plants as well so she does have some mental stimulation on that regard, as she loves to travel among the pots smelling them all. 

Maybe I am overly concerned about this and shes just fine. I just feel bad when one dog gets to go to the beach, on hikes, to the store, while shes stuck at home in what appears to me as such a small world."
ScentedSarcasm,fdl9a32,t1_fdl89d4,"You obviously want what's best for her and as long as she gets to go out with her big brother sometimes, she'll probably be fine.   
My neighbour's dog never had a bad experience in her life. Energetic little dachshund mix, guards their little garden and is healthy, but she only tolerates one very short walk per day. You try a different route and she'll huff, sit down, look back and act like you're expecting her to climb Mount Everest. Sometimes dogs are the happiest when close to home."
MadnessHarnessed,fdlai8n,t1_fdl9a32,Oh man we had a Dachshund like that growing up but I always thought he complained about changes in the walk because he was fat and lazy lol. Sounds like a breed thing for them then instead. Her vet did recommend getting a kiddie pool this summer and teaching her to swim as good exercise for her bad knees so maybe Ill take that suggestion. Otherwise the advice was regular short walks so that she builds and maintains strength in her back legs.
Ploofilla,fdl7n5s,t3_elx57n,"A day off now and then won’t hurt, but regular walks help bond her to you and her fur sibling and will increase her confidence over time."
surferwannabe,fdlbqjc,t3_elx57n,"We are having the same issue with our dog and we’ve had him for a year and a half. We live in a big city and he grew up in from the burbs so we honestly think he is still not used to all the loud noises - remember, they are much more sensitive than us when it comes to smells and hearing. 

We literally have to pick him up most of the time and take him far from our place so he knows he can’t just pull to go back home. Luckily we do have a park near us where I can take him off leash and he can run around but even then he still hates leaving the house and still holds his ground when I try to take him. 

We figured as long as he plays indoors, he’ll get his exercise. We will eventually take him to a specialist to help with his socializing. 

As long as yours gets exercise indoors, I think it’s fine if you take a day or two off from walking him. Plus, he’s a tiny dog so he only really needs a short walk - not an hour or so. Good luck!"
AlexandritePhoenix,fdlj5cj,t3_elx57n,"At 6 pounds a walk across your house must seem like a marathon.

The point of a walk is physical and mental stimulation.  If she's getting that at home, I don't see why a walk specifically would be critical if she doesn't want to go."
Gorangers0525,fdmb4nz,t3_elx57n,"If you can provide the benefits a dog gets from a walk at home, I don't see it as being a necessity, especially for a 6 lbs dog. My dog loves walks, but doesn't even want to go down the block in the rain, even with a raincoat on. On days where it's pouring out she gets a few very short bathroom walks, and we play games/exercise inside to make up for the long walks she usually gets."
redshoes29,fdl8vle,t3_elx57n,Where does she go pee/poop if you don't take her for a walk?
MadnessHarnessed,fdlap19,t1_fdl8vle,"My small front yard :)

I'm very lucky in that we got an apartment that has a small front yard, which gives both dogs enough room to go to the bathroom and even play fetch a little in. Its not a long run by any means, but with her especially being so small Im sure it seems much larger to them. Never would have adopted her with all her known issues if I didn't have a good easy place for her to go without needing to walk somewhere. The shelter was very good about being upfront on all her issues."
redshoes29,fdlfva1,t1_fdlap19,"If the yard is open enough for her to enjoy the weather and outside smells and noises then this might work for an odd day. 

I walk my dog at least 4 times per day with one 1+hour walk even if we live in a house with a lot of land around. And I try to not do just forest and fields walks, since I found that if I don't expose my dog to the city walks regularly he starts being a bit reactive and overexcited once we do go. My fear is that if we don't walk around regularly he will start to find outside things unusual and shocking and might become reactive to them. However, my dog is still young and happy to walk with me (and he doesn't poop around the house so we have to go farther). If he was old and tired I probably wouldn't force him to go out as much, but I would still try to do a walk most days."
MadnessHarnessed,fdnkrcc,t1_fdlfva1,"I could never walk her that much 😳

Because of her bad knees, walks are important but we have to be super careful not to overdue it or we can inadvertantly make her knees worse. Vet recommended a short daily walk for about 15 min if just walking, 30min if its a more casual stop and sniff stroll. 

Even with play we dont let her go hard longer than 10 min at a time so that she doesnt overwork her back legs."
redshoes29,fdoaj0u,t1_fdnkrcc,"That's understandable :) my dog is just over 1 year, he loves going out and has no health issues. And, tbh, the walks do me and my husband even more good 😂"
Taizan,fdlecqe,t3_elx57n,"It really depends on the dog. If your dog is fine with sleeping in and only going out quickly to eliminate without a long walk, then so be it. In general establishing a routine is important for rescue dogs, so mixing things up when you feel like it can have a negative impact, so I'd try to stick to the early afternoon walk with both dogs together, either by you or your partner - a dog must learn to accept the rules, boundaries and routines you set in place. In general a daily walk is the basic minimum for enrichment if you offer further stimulation indoors (as you describe). For high energy or working dogs I'd go so far as to recommend 2-3 walks accumulating to 60+ minutes per day plus mental stimulation."
Throwawayuser626,fdlkred,t3_elx57n,"I personally will exercise my dog even though she doesn’t like it. She HATES going for walks. Very lazy. But I also want her to be healthy. I’ve been trying to find ways to engage her physically that aren’t walks. She likes to play ball, so we do that. She also likes to play in the water so when it’s warm she gets to swim and splash around."
bbhuntt,fdll03m,t3_elx57n,Not if she doesn’t want it just bring her out for potty
thewolf1185,fdlljix,t3_elx57n,My 6 lb chihuahua plays at home with my Huskies. He couldnt survive a walk with them. I've tried but end up carring him after like 10 min.
misspiggie,fdlnl3v,t3_elx57n,I have an 8 lb Chihuahua/dachshund. Sometimes she just doesn't want to walk for whatever reason. I don't push it and she goes on the pads. She sleeps just fine. Dogs that little don't really need a ton of exercise.
7_02_AM,fdltqmm,t3_elx57n,definitely needs a walk at least once daily
GoGetterGal,fdly1rk,t3_elx57n,"If she's getting exercise at home I don't think they are really needed. At least not daily. Or maybe he could take her for a short walk to just get her out for a bit.
Some dogs are also just set in their ways and don't enjoy the things we think they should."
WeirdOctopus,fdmvrto,t3_elx57n,"Especially a Dachshund should always have a very good muscle status and condition! So yes, daily proper (!) walks are really important. It's the basis for a long and healthy life. Walks on the weekend are not enough."
MadnessHarnessed,fdol2h3,t1_fdmvrto,Gonna have to keep building her up to this then! Can I ask what you mean by proper walks though? Want to make sure Im understanding what you mean. :)
coltranedis,fdmxtaq,t3_elx57n,"Two words: anal gland

Walk her everyday."
MadnessHarnessed,fdo24zi,t1_fdmxtaq,Can you further explain? I've never heard of dogs needing walks because of their anal glands...
coltranedis,fdog66c,t1_fdo24zi,"Dogs need to ""express"" their anal glands. Have you ever noticed a particularly slimy bowel movement? This is not only fecal matter being discharged but also the anal gland.

Walking them greatly assists with this process. If they start going a long time without their anal glands doing their thing then they can become a problem.

If this problem persists then you will start getting into the business of manually expressing your dog's anal glands yourself. You'll learn more about your dog's arse then you ever wanted to and cause them a great deal of discomfort.

Much easier to simply walk them on a regular basis."
MadnessHarnessed,fdojvf6,t1_fdoj5k0,"I... wasn't doubting you? I literally just said what I had been told and that I would be asking my vet about it more as I had never of this before, and thanked you for the reply. Your hostility was not needed at all here."
doghelpta,emg7d6,top_level,"Sorry in advance for the super long post.

I have a 7 year old male beagle / collie mix. I love the dog like a member of my family. I live alone, and this dog has been my closest companion for the last 6 years. I would do almost anything for him. Unfortunately he's always been a fearful and anxious dog, and now his issues are affecting both of our lives negatively to the point to where I'm at a loss for what to do. I adopted him from a kill shelter at almost 1 year old, so he had missed all of his early socialization time. I was not made aware of his many behavioral issues; some I didn't find out until many months after I had adopted him.

He is a ""Velcro"" dog that will always stick to my leg as I go from room to room. He alert barks at a plethora of noises and has a very hard time settling down in the house unless we are on the couch watching tv together. He paces in the house and paces outside in the yard. He also hates when I leave and has some level of separation anxiety. He isn't destructive, but he will whine and bark and pace for at least a little while after I leave. He is dog aggressive, to the point that even hearing a dog walking anywhere near him will cause him to go into high alert to where I can barely get him to take a high value treat. If he is somewhat close to the dog, there is no chance of him paying attention to me or calming down. He is also people aggressive, but he can walk about 10 feet away from people without losing his cool, but if they give him attention or get too close he will go into an aggressive barking mode as well. Kids are by far the worst. He can watch them from a distance, but loud screams or fast movements from a distance will trigger him too. He is also territorial in our house to where I have to be very careful about anyone new coming in. I separate him when I have repair people over, and he barks his head off the whole time. He has growled plenty of times, but only on two occasions did he put his teeth on someone. Both times were when he was being separated for not being able to calm down when people were coming over and he basically ""placed"" his teeth on my leg both times. It didn't leave a mark and certainly didn't break the skin.

The most serious episode, and the one that scared me the most happened recently. I was moving some boxes in from the car, and the dog slipped between my legs and out the door. An elderly woman was walking past my house, and he saw her and instantly darted for her and started barking wildly. The woman started to run and yell at him, which caused him to pursue her more. She ran behind some trash cans while swinging her purse in his direction and he sat in front of her growling and barking with bristled hair while ""fake"" lunging until I could run over and scoop him up. As soon as I did he chilled out and I apologized profusely, but I was terrified that something much worse could have happened if I hadn't been so quick to get him. He completely ignored my attempts to call him off, even though he is good at coming when called under non-stressful situations.

As he has gotten older, all of his anxiety and aggression issues have worsened. He is currently on Prozac and has a probiotic mix that I put on his food that is supposed to help increase gut bacteria that is helpful with anxiety.  I've taken him to multiple trainers, the first one was a ""balanced"" approach, which just made things worse, but since then I've done nothing but positive reinforcement. I've learned a ton about training and have educated myself on how I can be a calm, confident leader and make training fun and positive for him. He is very smart and has learned tons of commands and truly enjoys training. He is afraid of the clicker, but I've started saying ""yes!"" to mark every time he does something good and then treat him.  I walk him every day, and he just adores going out and exploring his world, as long as I go at times to avoid his main triggers. I've changed my whole routine to try to accommodate his issues. I went from apartment living to a house so he can have a yard and a larger, quieter space, I've bought tons of training aids, treats, toys and everything else to try to make his time alone less stressful for him. I stopped having company over unless it's the few people I can get him to warm up to, and I never have parties. I only go out of town if my Mom will be available to watch him, as I don't trust anyone else to monitor him safety. I bring good treats for him on walks and praise him every time he sees people or hears dogs and doesn't react. I make sure when I come or go it's uneventful, I work every day on desensitizing him to noises and me coming and going, and I'm 100% committed to never getting angry with him about his extremely annoying barking, and instead redirect him to be quiet and praise him when he does.  I feel like I get small wins here and there, but he just doesn't show much improvement on his biggest triggers.

I don't want to sound like it is all bad. He warms up quickly to friendly and calm women, especially if they have treats. When he gets comfortable with someone he is the sweetest, kindest dog you can imagine. He never has accidents inside, he never chews on anything he shouldn't, and he just adores being with me. I can tell how much he loves me and I love him so much in return. I'm also an anxious person, and I can say that my mental health and general quality of life is worse with the barking and the anxiety the dog causes, but I love him and I have been managing, but that leads me to my next and biggest problem.

I ended up falling in love with someone that has an 8 year old daughter and cats. It certainly wasn't planned, and since we have been together I have taken additional steps to work on desensitizing the dog to kids, but he just doesn't show a ton of improvement. I sit outside a park and let him watch the kids, but he is not even close to being able to approach them or play with them. I know this woman is the person I want to spend the rest of my life with, and she is being very understanding about the dog's issues, but at some point I will have to make some hard choices. I'm doubtful that the dog will ever be able to live comfortably with a child, and even if he can, what about the cats and what about other friends that come over? What kind of step-dad would I be if the first thing I do is add a dangerous element to her home life as well as constant stress from the dog's issues? Her dad and his new wife adopted a really sweet puppy recently, and she told us that she loves the dog but he ""really stresses her out sometimes."" I've talked to my vet about possibly re-homing him and the vet would help with this, but with his myriad of issues I'm so worried that he will be passed around, that his issues will worsen, and he will live alone in a cage or die alone.  Neither one of these options is something I can handle, but I also can't imagine losing the person I love, or having to wait until my 40s to start a family. I'm also worried about the ethical question of re-homing a dog with so many issues. What would his quality of life be like, and honestly what is it like a lot of the time now?

Now my landlord wants to sell my house, and at this point I only have a few months before I either have to rent a new place or move in with my girlfriend. I don't have infinite money for new trainers and consultations that might lead nowhere, and I don't know how long my girlfriend will delay our plans together for a dog. I know she is already worried that I will choose the dog over her. I'm sorry for the rant, I'm just at a loss as to what to do and would love to hear some opinions. Thank you so much.

Edit: Thank you for all the incredibly kind and helpful comments. I have an early morning but will be responding ASAP. There is one veterinary behaviorist in my area and I will be reaching out first thing in the morning."
gobabygo11,fdou1rw,t3_emg7d6,"This is a difficult situation, but if I were in your shoes, I would talk to a veterinarian first about a possible medication change. My dog was also a very anxious dog around certain triggers and it took months to figure out the right dosage for her. It was honestly like treating a person and how some medications work better than others and respond to different mixes. I was super lucky to finally find a vet that specializes in behavior and was extremely patient!"
doghelpta,fdqn5r4,t1_fdou1rw,"will do, thank you."
meepits,fdp1tsj,t3_emg7d6,"So, this sounds a little like my dog. Do you have pet insurance? See a legit veterinary behaviorist. They pay for it. Sophie was attacked at a young age. She gets huffy and lunges when she can just hear a dog as well. But she can play with a few of my friends dogs totally fine after she was able to trust that they wouldn't hurt her. 

My dog took Prozac for 6 months and it didn't work but that was all my vet knew to try. We tried a combination of two drugs and it has helped a lot.

And a vet behaviorist is a necessity if you'll be desensitizating to kids and wanting to keep her. Can she play in the yard and you mark and treat for looking at her? Play engage/disengage from a safe place like the deck door.

Also, muzzle train. Then the worse your pup can do is boop someone.

Also also, why do you take him on walks? You have a yard, right? I've seen a lot of people stop taking them on walks. I'd sell a kidney to have a yard and not have to put her in that situation. You said your dog is smart? You can create fun agility things in your yard for him to stimulate his mind! It's super fun. 

But, at the absolute very least, save up. And do an initial in home consult with a veterinary behaviorist. Start there."
doghelpta,fdqn2y9,t1_fdp1tsj,"He loves walks, and I can usually avoid any serious triggers. The agility course is a great idea. I don't have pet insurance, but I will be talking to a veterinary behaviorist."
JoNightshade,fdp2t36,t3_emg7d6,"I don't have a lot of advice for you beyond what other people have said but I want to say: you should know that no matter what you decide, even euthanasia, you have given this dog 6 wonderful years of love and patience that he would not have gotten if you were not there for him. You have gone way above and beyond what most people would be willing or able to do. I think if he could talk to you and understand the situation he would want you to know that he wants you to have the same happiness that you have given him. He wants you to have the kind of love from someone like you have given him. You are a kind and loving person and I think your girlfriend and her daughter are lucky to have you."
verymerry19,fdpk7ee,t1_fdp2t36,"I just want you to know how much comfort this comment has provided me. Almost three years ago, my 4 year old boy (who had always been reactive) suddenly became hyper aggressive, and within two months he had bitten a neighbour and my roommate’s 6 year old daughter. I had very few options at the time, and had him euthanised. I’ve regretted it every single day, because I believe I could have figured it out and saved him. Your comment has made me think about it differently for the first time. Maybe I can forgive myself one day. Thank you."
McKave,fdpe0f3,t1_fdp2t36,I completely agree with this statement. You've given that dog so much love through so much more than what most owners would even attempt!

JoNightshade,fdpnmhf,t1_fdpk7ee,"I'm glad I could provide some comfort. I learned the lesson as a kid with a pet bunny that sometimes the most loving thing you can do for an animal is give them a good death. It's good you were able to give him love while you could but I think it's better that you made that difficult choice before he could do something that both of you would very much regret. I'm sorry, it's such a hard choice no matter what."
Whats4dinner,fdprcfc,t1_fdpk7ee,I know that must have been a heartbreaking decision for you.  I had a dog that turned like that once she reached maturity.  We took her to the university behavioral center and they told us the same thing as our trainer:  once they learn that biting works as a defensive behavior they don’t unlearn it.    You can use the [Dunbar](https://apdt.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ian-dunbar-dog-bite-scale.pdf) scale to see what I mean.   May you find peace of mind in your own way.
doghelpta,fdqn4hm,t1_fdpe0f3,thank you
JoNightshade,fdrplkz,t1_fdqn45g,"You are welcome. It's a really hard situation and a really hard choice. Don't be too hard on yourself, you're doing the best you can."
unhappyisland21,fdov41u,t3_emg7d6,"I don't have much advice to offer here in terms of what is your best course of action other than talking to a behaviorist and trying to manage his stress and anxiety.

I deeply feel your predicament and pain over what to do however. I adopted a jack russell terrier/pug mix when he was 1.5 and had him for 6 years. he was my best friend and I loved him to pieces -- he had a lot of similar issues as your dog. He couldn't stand children, would attack if any stranger got too close to him, he absolutely hated other dogs, i could only midly-trust him with a few people he had known for awhile and even then he was still unpredictable. any steps forward we made with his behavior seemed to eventually go three steps back. It got to the point where my roommates said it was time for me and the dog to move out. After about 3 months of staying in a friend's attic, unable to find anywhere to live that would be safe for both myself/dog and any roommates (couldnt afford to live alone at the point) I decided I would have to surrender him to the local SPCA. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make and I cried about it for days after. And then about 6 months after I gave him up, a friend of mine was at the local dog park and spotted him with his new owners. We found out he was adopted the day after I surrendered him, by a family with a 7 year old child, and a husky and that he was doing great with both. It seemed it was just the relationship we had with each other that had turned him into this crazy beast. 

All this just to say - i understand what your going to and these decisions are very difficult. But I had lost hope for my little guy and ended up with a happy ending and I hope that you can be fortunate in that sense as well."
doghelpta,fdqn7nh,t1_fdov41u,"thank you, glad it worked out for him."
KLee0587,fdp9hxo,t3_emg7d6,"Personally I would not feel comfortable rehoming this dog. You would have to be crazy picky to find someone both willing and capable (financially and have the extra time) to take on this dog. And unless you hit the jackpot and find someone really experienced with dogs with similar issues, it’s likely this dog will be rehomed over and over again, dumped in a shelter to be euthanized (because they typically don’t make dogs with issues like these available to the public due to safety concerns), or euthanized by a different owner because he hurt someone or something. If time were less of an issue and I would recommend seeing a board certified veterinary behaviorist first and foremost as well as different or additional meds. Prozac alone is great good dogs with mild anxieties but often use of an additional medication concurrently makes all the difference. One of my dogs was very similar. He was born in a shelter and had minimal human contact until I got him at about 10 weeks old. You would think that would be young enough to work out simples issues and fears but unfortunately the damage had been done and it was so severe that he suffered for it daily for a long time. He was also very reactive and I had to yell out to people on walks not to try and approach my dog. He growled and barked viciously at people and other dogs and also at anyone that entered my house (he did this even as a puppy). Finally at about 8 months old as things were getting worse I saw a veterinary behaviorist. She tried some different medications and he ended up on two meds that made all the difference. After some adjustment time we were able to work on training where he could actually learn since he wasn’t constantly over his tolerance threshold. After a few weeks we saw improvement, a few months and we saw a dramatic difference, a year later and we had a completely different dog. He was no longer scared of everything or trembling in a corner, he no longer barked at everyone or everything, he happily approached people and wanted to be pet, etc. The medications helped keep him calm and helped him from going 0-60 in the face of one of his many triggers so that he could actually learn what I was teaching him and then the positive reinforcement actually worked! If you had more time I would 100% say to seek out help from a boarded veterinary behaviorist because you would be surprised at the difference it can make in the dogs quality of life (and your own). But I’m not sure what you can accomplish in just a few short months and it sounds like you feel as if this family is what you’ve been waiting for. Ultimately I don’t think humane euthanasia would be a wrong decision as I feel that without extensive searching, rehoming would not be a safe option and unfortunately many rescues are already full with so many other dogs with issues that their owners were unwilling or unable to help them through."
doghelpta,fdrskus,t1_fdp9hxo,I'm really worried about rehoming him for all the same reasons. Glad you saw such great improvement with your dog.
SteveCastle,fdox9yi,t3_emg7d6,"It's so clear you are committed to your companion. You gave your friend many good years he otherwise might not have had, and you are not obligated to give up a serious relationship to accommodate his needs when, 1) You've taken the appropriate steps to try to adapt him to that environment and, 2) The conflict is based on a legitimate concern for the safety of a child and another animal.

Euthanasia is a hard choice, but it would be a painless way to ensure he does not slip into a miserable situation - it would not be a betrayal. It would be selfless, because I suspect that it would be devastating for YOU more than anything else, so I don't think that's where we're at just yet, but you might want to establish that in your mind as the baseline - if nothing else works, you won't have to risk him being passed around or neglected, you won't give up the chance for a family, and you won't endanger them. You will shoulder the emotional burden.

So, other options. First, I don't think it's hopeless to cohabitate this dog with cats and an 8 year old. You'd want to clear it with a behaviorist, but you said he warms up to people that he gets used to and he has never hurt a human or animal. Placing teeth is not good, but bite inhibition is a dog's ability to sense when it has made tooth contact and not to apply further pressure, even in a stressful situation, so if anything your example shows evidence that he has this capability. If the kid was any younger, I'd be more reserved, but 8 is old enough that the kid can be taught what upsets the dog, give him space while he is sleeping and eating, etc. I agree with the previous commenter that I wouldn't ""trust"" either of them by leaving them unsupervised, but that doesn't mean they can't cohabitate. 

Cats have the ability to stay out of a dog's reach, and it doesn't sound like he has ""tackle, grab, and shake"" like tendencies, so he might be able to handle this with appropriate work from a good behaviorist. 

If your girlfriend is willing to try, you could give it a shot while looking for other home options. That's the other possibility. He does sound like he has many characteristics that might make him a good choice for someone in a more rural area. He doesnt chew or soil the house, and he's a good companion for someone like a recent retiree. Some people WANT a guard dog. You might find someone as committed to him as you are but in a better situation for his needs.

You've done a lot, and you are in a rough situation here. You seem overwhelmed, and I wouldn't blame you if you were. Do what you can do dial in the medications with your vet, do your research and find the right behaviorist to get a professional opinion and training regime if you want to try cohabitation, and start making facebook marketplace posts in neighboring rural areas (old people love facebook). If all else fails, euthanasia is a painless and peaceful end that is a fulfillment of your bond with the dog, not a betrayal of it. Don't despair! You are a good friend!"
doghelpta,fdrrw3m,t1_fdox9yi,"This was all very helpful, thank you."
solasaloo,fdopvz7,t3_emg7d6,"Have you spoken with a board certified veterinary behaviourist? 

Otherwise, at the end of the day, this is a real medical condition and you would not be out of line for considering euthanasia. 

You might be able to improve his anxieties and other issues (anxiety can cause chronic pain, fatigue and other health problems). But it's doubtful that he will ever be fully reliable around kids. I'm sorry."
doghelpta,fdrsrwi,t1_fdopvz7,Thank you. I'm in the process of talking to one now.

MoMoJangles,fdowjxj,t3_emg7d6,"May be an unpopular opinion,...

If you are merging your life with your partner and her child then they need to to take top priority. I say this as someone who, very sadly and unexpectedly had to put a dog down due to aggression. The safety of the PEOPLE in the vicinity of the dog is the most important thing here. It’s hard cause we may not love the random person and their pet walking down the street like we love our dog, but if the issue originates with our animal it’s 100% our responsibility to keep others safe from our pet. 

It is not fair to anyone that ends up hurt or traumatized by your dog to have to live with that when you know your dog is reliably unreliable in that respect. I also know that “knowing” this in your head versus your heart. 

It sounds to me like there is too much uncertainty for you to trust your pet around others. If you have time to work with a behaviorist and explore other options definitely do. If you’re at the point where your relationship is strained or not moving forward at all understand that it’s ok to make a choice."
doghelpta,fdrswpu,t1_fdowjxj,thank you. I don't disagree with a lot of this. I can at least get a consultation and go from there.
eavingsrescue,fdp7c2a,t1_fdowjxj,"Sounds to me like the behaviour of the dog is due to fear, not ""aggression"" (although they seem similar but are different in origin). As such, euthanasia is an option that isn't really amazing here.

What is clear is that the owner is not able to find a solution, so they should be initiating a long term relationship with a behaviourist, or finding a trainer who can board the dog to see if the behaviour changes AWAY from the owner."
MoMoJangles,fds222j,t1_fdrswpu,"That sounds like a great plan. Get all the info and help you have access to! I think some people are assuming that I’m saying you should put your pet down. When I say make a choice I mean, make the choice that allows you to move forward. That could mean a lot of things including rehoming. Only you know all the variables. I only mentioned my experience to highlight that I do know how crummy this type of situation can feel and I totally emphasize."
Pibbles,fdpb4i2,t1_fdp7c2a,Your use of the word amazing is confusing me.
doghelpta,fdrsuku,t1_fdp7c2a,I would love this to be the case. thanks for your opinion.
zyxfm,fdpbz1h,t3_emg7d6,"Prozac can work differently on different dogs, some can even get worse. Have you tried another medication?"
doghelpta,fdrsygh,t1_fdpbz1h,"Yes, I haven't seen much improvement with meds but I know there are many different ones and different dosages."
pfarnham,fdpejlc,t3_emg7d6,One additional point besides what others have said: if you have anxiety you can be sure your dog knows it and you feed each other's anxiety in a reinforcing cycle. Any help you can get to lower your anxiety will help your dog calm down and be less protective of you both. I hope things work out for you.
doghelpta,fdqmvtz,t1_fdpejlc,"I agree with you. I've really worked on being calm around him even when he's acting up, but I'm sure he can still sense it sometimes."
ruffpatches,fdppbur,t3_emg7d6,"There are a ton of great tips here and some very thorough advice, so I'll just mention a couple things that worked for me specifically.

My dog grew up with cats as a puppy but has a fairly high prey drive. So when we adopted her it was really challenging with our kitty. From eating litter, to nicking Boo's eye, to barking wildly whenever I gave the cat the slightest attention.
There were a few points where I thought I was going to be forced to rehome one of them. I was (mostly,) patient though, and click and treated for at least 6 months until they could safely be left alone. 2 years later they can safely play alone or supervised!

The biggest and most surprising break through I had with them is when I started to casually clicker train my cat. Suddenly the dog stopped trying to steal Boo's treats, and literally head tilted looking at him differently! I think it leveled the playing field and made very clear that they were on equal footing where food was concerned.

My dog also became less jealous as she realized they would both be fed and played with, and her chasing visibly changed from aggressive to more playful/cautious.

I'd also recommend getting your pup comfortable with a basket muzzle if hes not already.

Good luck! I hope everything works out for you and your family."
doghelpta,fdrszvc,t1_fdppbur,thank you so much.
shlinky1,fdq3k8p,t3_emg7d6,"This dog is frightened of the clicker. This is a huge alarm bell. He isn’t even comfortable in the home with relatively quiet albeit unusual sounds. 

He’s got a bite record.

You’ve had years of working with him. 

It doesn’t sound like you’ve made vast progress with him so why do you think this is going to work out safely in a few months time? Don’t get me wrong I’m just trying to be realistic. If he can’t comfortably relax watching kids play in the park from a distance, how is it fair to put him in a house with a kid and two cats and expect him to be un-reactive.

On a similar note how is it fair to deny yourself a chance at a wonderful relationship when you’ve given so much to helping this dog. 

It doesn’t sound like you feel you’ve not tried hard enough or not put enough time in. I feel like you should seriously consider euthanasia. He’s had love from you and rehoming him will set him back so far. 

It’s not sad for the dog, of course you would miss him but it’s not fair on him to be either put in a position where he could become dangerous or put in a situation where he has to reset his whole life and lose everything normal and comforting to him."
doghelpta,fdqmo94,t1_fdq3k8p,"Thank you. I agree with a lot of what you are saying, it's just a really hard thing to decide, especially when he is perfectly healthy and also happy plenty of the time."

tuigdoilgheas,fdpgg8k,t3_emg7d6,"How much good, hard exercise is he getting in a day?

Is the Prozac the first drug you've tried with him?"
doghelpta,fdqmtid,t1_fdpgg8k,"A walk, some play time in the yard, and some training time. He could be worked out harder, I'm sure. Prozac isn't the first."
tuigdoilgheas,feay501,t1_fdqmtid,"All dogs are different.  My 'high energy' shepherd is a couch potato compared to my expectations.  That said, I'd expect a beagle or a collie to need a lot of activity.  Beagles need movement, but they also need time for scenting.  Are you able to maybe try upping the activity level for a while to see what that gets you?  It's totally a time commitment and it's hard.  But maybe if it's between this and potentially putting the dog down, maybe he needs to live with people who can give him a job and a ton of exercise."

jessienjames,fdpmazm,t3_emg7d6,"Hi OP! Reading this post absolutely broke my heart, I'm a vet student in Ontario, Canada, who also happens to have an anxious beagle with similar (albeit somewhat more mild) triggers. His hackles raise and he lunges when he sees other dogs, he even howls at mailmen and kids when they're too loud. Though if I stick him in an off leash park, he's fine! He still acts grumpy but there's no lunging or hackles going up (and I guess that's what I mean when I say my beags is a bit more mild).
I want to say that you did and are still doing an absolutely wonderful job with your pet. It can be so incredibly difficult to make these decisions for our companions so I want to make sure that you're aware of all your options, though you've certainly explored a whole bunch of them!! Since I'm a vet student, please discuss my suggestions with an actual licensed veterinarian. I'm no expert by any means. 
Rehoming your pup is certainly a very valid option, though I can understand your worries about him being rehomed and it can be an incredibly emotional experience. 
If keeping your pup is something that you continue to consider, you can pursue some pharmaceutical options to help with his anxiety. For example, anxiolytics, SSRIs, sedatives such as trazodone, gabapentin, fluoxetine, and alprazolam (just to name a few) are some commonly used pharmaceuticals that vets can use to help calm down our furry friends. And there are a lot of drugs out there that are very safe for our pets' daily use. Your vet may caution you to bring in your pet for yearly bloodwork to make sure that there are no side effects to the medication, but if you're bringing your pup in for an annual exam, the bloodwork can be done in that same visit! Do keep in mind that your vet and yourself will be the best people to decide which medication will be suitable for your pup, and that these medications are meant as a training supplement and NOT a solution. 
If your partner's kids are mature enough, you can even incorporate them eventually with your pup's training, if the medication proves to be effective. However, do keep in mind that this training, even while he's on the medication, must be supervised by you. 
My own beagle is on trazodone daily for his severe separation anxiety and he is a changed pup! He is currently taking it every day, and he went from being dog-reactive, to being able to live with my roommate's two energetic, large-breed dogs! That being said, they don't cuddle or anything like that, but they can walk by each other and look at each other without causing a scene, and that's such an improvement from how he initially was without his medication. 
It also sounds like perhaps a referral to a board-certified veterinary behaviourist would be really helpful if your local trainers' methods aren't as effective as you'd like. The behaviourists are really well equipped and will work with you and your pup so that you both can lead happy, fulfilling lives with the people that you love. 
I hope this helps! If you need anything or if you have any questions about my own pup or questions about the aforementioned suggestions, feel free to message me. I wish you and your pup the best of luck!! I'd love to get an update"

CourtEm22,fdqez49,t3_emg7d6,"Muzzle training is definitely a good option. Get a basket muzzle, I use the Baskerville you can get it on chewy. That way you’re taking the actual dangerous aspect out of it, and you can attempt to desensitize to people safely. There are other drugs you can try so definitely talk to your vet. Also look into veterinary behaviorists in your area and maybe pet insurance to help with costs. If nothing improves, euthanasia is not a bad decision. It’s hard, but ultimately if he isn’t improving and is spending all this time anxious and upset then he’s just suffering and so are you."

SeaS_Self,fdy1ejy,t3_emg7d6,"I went through a similar situation with a cattle dog (Australian Blue Heeler) who had always been anxious and aggressive but went off the deep end after we were transferred to a new state. He broke through fences, snapped (not heeling, actual lunging and snapping) at men who came to visit us, and tried to eat a random Yorkie. We had him on a Prozac dosage for a Rottie and it did not slow him down. We ran him and played with him, trained, etc. nothing worked.  I talked to breed specific rescues and none would take him because of his bite history. It was affecting my mental health and my relationship. I used to joke with the vet that I was going to start taking the doggie downers! After my dog bit me in the shoulder (while I was driving), I’d had enough and had to put him down. I couldn’t risk another family with kids taking on that situation. The vet consoled me that I had done everything I could (this was back before dog behaviorists were a big thing), and the guilt haunted me for years. I felt like I had failed him.  You have done so much for this little guy.  I hope the behaviorist can help, but if not please - don’t beat yourself up if you have to make that decision."
