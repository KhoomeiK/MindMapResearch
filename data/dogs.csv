psycho_watcher,fdzlcpj,t3_enc83c,"What I do not understand is that my dogs have always reacted to doorbells. I have not had an apartment with a doorbell in years. I have had 2 dogs since puppyhood that should not know what a doorbell means and yet they react to them on the tv.

So strange."
Owlbino_Owl,fdzs22r,t1_fdzlcpj,Loud and high pitched sounds tend to do that.
owlskye,fe09jks,t1_fdzlcpj,Maybe its ingrained in their blood now.
no1youdknow,fdzx2y4,t1_fdzlcpj,We do not and never have had a doorbell. Our dog still loses his mind every time.
hydrababoon6244,fe0h07s,t1_fdzlcpj,We did not have a doorbell until recently. My dogs just realized that when the doorbell rings someone is at the door.
cinnaminan,fe34ked,t1_fdzlcpj,They're smarter than we sometimes give them credit for.
SolanGoose,fe04s41,t1_fdzs22r,"My dog will sit under the blaring smoke alarm when I burn toast and ignore it totally. Doorbell? Freakout.

Edit: I'm also across the road from the village fire station and there's trains hooting all night 3 blocks over. Nothing."
psycho_watcher,fe0ivdd,t1_fdzs22r,"They don't react to fireworks, music, the fire alarm going off or sirens by running towards the door and barking like someone had knocked though.

The little one I had later would also do that but I am not sure if he lived with doorbells before I adopted him. 

I really do not know how they learned that that ding dong sound means someone is at the door."
unoruatrois,fe4fs5a,t1_fe34ked,"I dunno! I went to visit my neighbour the other day- their dog was out, wandered over and said hello to us then ambled back to sit watching the lane. We walked on up the driveway, rang their doorbell and he appeared like an absolute hell hound!"
Owlbino_Owl,fe0h8fs,t1_fe04s41,Your dog could also associate the doorbell to guests or a stranger being nearby. My dog always freaks out over the doorbell because she wants to see the new guy. If she sees us ignore it then she'll calm down almost immediately.
Owlbino_Owl,fe0j9lm,t1_fe0ivdd,"It's kind of like that Pavlov experiment where he conditions dogs to salivate when they hear a bell. Except this is learned through observing, but yeah they just see people pop up behind the door every time a ding is heard. I bet if someone changed their doorbell to sound unique and different from other doorbells then they'd mostly react to that sound than the normal ding."
DocSmizzle,fe27l2f,t1_fe0j9lm,Like a Ring video doorbell chime.
fundaydriverninja,fe3p9k5,t1_fe27l2f,Was looking for someone to make this exact comment! My Alexa plays the windchimes when the Ring sees motion. Schoolkids cut through our side yard daily and he often sees them through the window and barks. I've now realized he associates the windchimes with the yard because he will dash over to that window anytime the sound plays.
hyporheic,fdzlgb3,t3_enc83c,Also honking in songs while driving!
BabysInBlack,fdzp2to,t1_fdzlgb3,And sirens in radio commercials!
heffnog,fe3mofb,t1_fdzlgb3,Nissan had a radio ad where the ad made the same warning sound that their cars do. Made me freak out every time.
cornbreadbiscuit,fe01mzl,t1_fdzp2to,"\[*Horns, sirens*...\] And *screeching tires* in radio commercials.

Seriously. [Nobody likes this shit](http://freakonomics.com/2011/07/08/from-the-comments-lay-off-the-fake-car-horns/) (see comments).

98% upvote [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/bi3q8q/radio_commercials_that_play_the_sound_of_an/). I rest my case, lol.

TIL: It's [illegal to mimic](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/a0iqee/til_that_it_is_illegal_to_include_the_emergency/) Emergency Broadcast sounds, but the other stuff needs to go too, specifically if it's *ADVERTISING*. The FCC doesn't broadly ban it call because 'free speech' <roll eyes>. There's a melody / rhythm to most songs, so it's the ads that are really the problem, imo."
hyporheic,fdzrjw1,t1_fdzp2to,I know we're off track about bugging dogs but my dog responds to sirens too.
dnalloheoj,fe48841,t1_fdzp2to,"This is one of my biggest pet peeves, to the point that I actually have started contacting the companies that do this in their ads. 

I actually had one that said they'll note my complaint and reassess the commercial, and about a week later I heard the ad again without the siren! FirstNet I think it who it was?

Don't get me wrong, I know it wasn't just my one sole complaint that resulted in the change, but hey, it felt like a minor victory for me!"
BabysInBlack,fe4eqiz,t1_fe01mzl,"Agreed! Though illegal in the US, not necessarily other countries."
poocoonuts,fdztb4n,t1_fdzrjw1,I work at a doggy day care that's across the street from our local fire station :(
FaolchuThePainted,fdzxdl9,t1_fdztb4n,Oh god lol that’s gotta be hilarious the first couple times i has to put my boy outside to get through any parts of game of thrones that were set in winterfell in the first season cause of the barking dogs in the background
Youhadme_atwoof,fe0axty,t1_fdztb4n,"How often are the group howls? Those were my favorite when working at a doggy daycare, but they weren't too terribly frequent."
hyporheic,fdzvuwf,t1_fdztb4n,Poor doggos but do they ever enjoy the distraction?
shillyshally,fdzy3dh,t1_fdztb4n,There's a nursing home on the next block from my house :(
miparasito,fe1rhci,t1_fdztb4n,That seems like a very poor location choice. Did the owner not  realize there was a fire station?
dethmaul,fe37hsc,t1_fdztb4n,That would suck for dogs that DON'T react. The other idiots howling are going to teach them to react to it pretty fucking quick.
poocoonuts,fe0b0lt,t1_fe0axty,I get a couple a week. 90% of them are triggered purposely by coworkers and boy does that drive me nuts because they always do it if I have a screamer in my group.
Broncos_Fan,fdzrryq,t3_enc83c,"I took a marketing class where they said those things are done intentionally to get reactions out of pets. People have gotten so good at tuning out ads, many commercials attempt to get the attention of their pets in order to force the viewers to look at the ad."
ILoveWildlife,fdzsssu,t1_fdzrryq,but does that actually bring in customers? I'd avoid the brand.
thecodemonk,fdzstts,t1_fdzrryq,That figures. Just like writers of kids shows design them so the actors scream or yell every few minutes so it keeps the viewers attention. So crappy.
samnsara,fe26sc8,t1_fdzrryq,I have large screen TVs in most my rooms and I have a two-year-old golden retriever who stands in front of the television and barks every time an animal is on especially a dog and really especially another golden retriever.  With the large screen TVs most of the animals appear life-size to her.
Broncos_Fan,fdzuf15,t1_fdzsssu,"It’s one of those things where any attention is better than none. And there have been some ads where my dogs have reacted really cutely. There was a car commercial awhile back with dogs barking at each other. Both of my dogs would stop what they were doing, run to the TV and cock their heads back and forth whenever it came on. I even had to look it up on YouTube once to show some friends how they reacted. The ones that get them barking annoy me, but not enough to boycott anyone."
Echospite,fe0etrg,t1_fdzsssu,Only if you know they're doing it on purpose.
bag_of_oatmeal,fe3w94f,t1_fdzsssu,"Yes. Even annoying commercials bring in customers. Maybe *especially* annoying ones bring in even more.

Almost no one actually doesn't purchase something after being annoyed. They remember the brand when it's time to decide for purchase, and that's all that matters to our monkey brains."
Broncos_Fan,fdzuigm,t1_fdzstts,Exactly!
serjsomi,fdzxwen,t3_enc83c,"I kinda miss my dog barking at the doorbell sound. She has lost most of her hearing. Sadly she has aged very quickly this past year. 

I'd be happy if she gets the tv doorbell or even better, our own."
miparasito,fe1s79f,t1_fdzxwen,"If it makes you feel better, now she is free from the stress of having to protect you and your house from those mean old doorbells. I bet she’s enjoying her well deserved retirement from that job"
miparasito,fe2hs2k,t1_fe1s79f,Lol she is probably thinking “It took me years off barking to convince that thing to stop ringing but I finally DID IT.”
VCinOhio,fdzt4rv,t3_enc83c,"I really feel for you all. My dogs don't react to anything on TV or on the computer: doorbells, sirens, dogs barking...nothing. I guess they are just weird???"
BK4343,fdztyld,t1_fdzt4rv,Same here. Mine can hear any number of noises like that and not lose his shit.
danielleg1244,fe3zt4q,t1_fdztyld,They’re prolly just trained and well behaved lol.
glow89,fe0e3s6,t3_enc83c,My dog thinks the clock ticking in the 60 minutes commercial is someone knocking on the door so he goes nuts every time he hears it
leeser11,fe05waw,t3_enc83c,"But it is a great opportunity to train your dog not to bark at the doorbell, yes? 

I know what you mean but I’m a dog sitter so that’s what I usually do. If I don’t have the energy, I just laugh."
Amyjane1203,fdzj6ub,t3_enc83c,Also whistles!
BwabbitV3S,fdztn4e,t3_enc83c,Sometimes it feels like I have the only dog that does not react to sounds on tv or radio. He goes crazy over out doorbell with excitement but flat out ignored them on the tv or radio.
CanisGladiolus,fe0gmlp,t3_enc83c,"I don't do cable so don't really deal with commercials thankfully, but I never realized how often doorbell sounds happen in South Park before going through a few(or 9) seasons with my dog.

We don't have a doorbell. 
His previous home must have though, so we've been working on it mostly by playing doorbell sounds sporadically off my computer and rewarding him the less he reacts. It's going pretty good, now he only lets out a bit of a rumble bark occasionally when he hears it."
k_mon2244,fdzqcs0,t3_enc83c,I would like to sign this petition
issiautng,fdzwy2a,t3_enc83c,"My current dog has no idea what a doorbell means. He barely knows what a knock is, since all our friends just walk right in."
rufos_adventure,fe055bo,t3_enc83c,"doorbells and that just below normal hearing phone ring which i hear on radio ads

my dog barks at the tv and i look for the phone which is turned off...pavlov must be laughing in his grave."
NaiveMastermind,fe1c45a,t3_enc83c,and suddenly >!AWOOOOOOOO!!<
plywooden,fe1mbwy,t3_enc83c,What's funny is that I don't have a doorbell. When one sounds on tv my border collies would bark and run to the door. I got them via informal adoption when they were 5 y.o.
PowerPuffGrrl,fe1xn1o,t3_enc83c,"My dog knows when my phone rings he can bark at my partner (he is the only one I have phone calls with) so he gets all excited when he hears the phone ring, even on tv! He does the same with door bells and he also knows the sound my Xbox makes when I turn it off and has associated that noise with a walk or going to bed XD"
lesterous,fe2bb3j,t3_enc83c,"Lol! I work at a doy daycare, and one of the services we provide is valet, we have a big van for transporting the dogs. One night I was mid shift, and a doorbell ad went off - while I had 12ish dogs in the van. Chaos ensued and I'm damn lucky I wasn't mid traffic situation 😂"
zodiacrelic44,fe2k4z7,t3_enc83c,"My last dog learned the difference between a TV doorbell and a real doorbell based off how I reacted. If I nodded at him, it was the real door. If I shook my head no, it was the TV. I never trained him to pick up on that, but it worked somehow."
oddpsycho,fe3exd0,t3_enc83c,"thank goodness my dog only reacts to my actual doorbell.
lucky me i never get guests, the only guests i get is a few amazon packages and my doordash delivery with my antisocial self. iml my friend comes sometimes but she doesn’t ring the doorbell she just invites herself in and my dog is used to that by now."
OneCrazyMoose,fdzkagm,t3_enc83c,I hate to add this but TV shows and movies haha. My puppers go crazy when they hear the doorbell. I wouldn't mind if it's a different sound but they all seem to be the exact same ring as mine!
damiami,fdzmswk,t3_enc83c,the old papa johns doorbell ring many years ago used to always get my dobe girl barking.
Skow1379,fdzvw3k,t3_enc83c,"Ha... If you let this get you worked up enough to post on Reddit, I feel for you."
xanticx,fe32i3h,t3_enc83c,or maybe just stop watching commercials???
jozlynPlaysEve,fdzy4lr,t3_enc83c,...or just mute the TV for the duration of the commercial
Balloonfightthepower,fdzumhx,t3_enc83c,Or radio commercials with car horns beeping or tires screeching.
ILikeBigAsses,fdzzcmy,t3_enc83c,Yes.
Turtle_Sensei,fe03j2y,t3_enc83c,"Same for cats. Whenever we watch a show that has a phone ring or a fire alarm beep, put poor cat goes nuts. 

He's afraid of the phone ring because that is the sound our apartment buzzer makes when someone buzzes to come in.

And the beep, he goes crazy over and meows at it."
jamesx413,fe0hnqm,t3_enc83c,"dude i feel you on this one!

when i stay at my friends place his dogs go crazy lol"
Jaschoid,fe0v45a,t3_enc83c,"every time my dog hears a doorbell, he just runs to the main door and is excited because he thinks someone is coming"
pkp542,fe1wz15,t3_enc83c,Just part of being a dog owner.  We signed up for it.
samnsara,fe26al0,t3_enc83c,"That is so funny. I have a rescue who goes crazy at the doorbell sound on the commercials however my other three dogs have never heard a doorbell so they just watch the little rescue go crazy. 

Actually what I want commercials to quit doing is saying the word Alexa."
Reader8618,fe26lk6,t3_enc83c,Omg this is hilariously relatable. As well as dog barking sound effects in “ghetto” neighborhoods depicted in movies/tv in general....do all poor ppl have barky dogs? I feel like this may be a stereotype or there is one “dark alley soundtrack with a barking dog” go-to that all film makers use?
Thisdoessuck,fe28nrv,t3_enc83c,It’s worse when it’s a fire alarm in the commercial/show
atheist_libertarian,fe2e25h,t3_enc83c,The final season of The Cosby Show was brutal. There was a running gag that would-be-handyman Cliff wanted to fix the doorbell so every episode someone rang the bell and it did the first ding noise and then malfunctioned. But that first ding was plenty to annoy the dog.
Suckan-elf,fe2jtxw,t3_enc83c,"I watched a sketch on youtube (on the TV) where the dude kept coming to this girl's door bringing her gifts. Every time he walked up the steps, he would ring the doorbell/ knock the door. My dogs went insane. It was chaos. I had to kick them out just to watch a 10 minute video."
hokie47,fe2ky96,t3_enc83c,I got rid of my old school door bell. Really you don't need them nowadays and my house is not that big.
talkward,fe2n26k,t3_enc83c,And car honks on radio ads
cinnaminan,fe347x7,t3_enc83c,I couldn't help but laugh at this. Also the knocking sound. Watching law and order in my house a practice in patients. 😄 also my lil girl ( a Chihuahua) hates the sound of Trump's voice ( not political just a fact). We were watch his talk on Iran the other day and as soon as he started speaking she dove in my lap and started growling at the TV. I finally turned it off. She got so upset she was shaking.
Whyzocker,fe376sz,t3_enc83c,"My dog wont react to anything that's not coming from the direction of the door.
But as soon as a key is inserted you can be dam  sure she'll be waiting to see who's visiting her."
sheneedsomeyeet,fe3bngr,t3_enc83c,And knocking!!
Casanova_Benoit,fe3efvy,t3_enc83c,I don't have a door bell.
DaCookieDemon,fe3p84b,t3_enc83c,My dog barks at the sound they use in catchphrase. It literally drives us mad
thedudeman144,fe44pya,t3_enc83c,My dogs don’t give a fudge lol
PMbleh87,fe4dn03,t3_enc83c,And put more siren sound effects in there because my dog howls along with them and that’s just so cute.
ctophermh89,fe6qima,t3_enc83c,"My dog howls like a wolf to sirens, but at doorbells will just creep to the door and quietly go “huff.” It’s a little bizarre."
neophyteneon,fdzuibc,t3_enc83c,Just train ya dog
lost_magpie,fe0kwlz,t1_fdzuibc,Agreed. This sounds like a great opportunity to do some counter conditioning!
ttots228,fdzn0ox,t3_enc83c,I could love this post a million times!!
ssfRAlb,fe0ag2i,t3_enc83c,Hahaha I couldn't even watch the Game Show Network for about a year after we rescued our dog.  Every time someone won and it went DING DING DING he'd lose his mind.
Beretta_Vough,enrren,top_level,"Just a suggestion...

Hard to say why I feel this way but pupvotes rub me the wrong way.  Maybe it crosses a cute line.

LtStarbuck1019,emqkwq,top_level,"Six weeks ago, I noticed a bump on my sweet boys nose. I thought it was an impacted tooth / abscess.  So I got him to the vet quickly for a cleaning. 

It turns out it wasn’t a tooth, but a super aggressive and rare form of lymphoma. If I hadn’t gotten him in when I did, he wouldn’t have lasted the weekend. 

I was warned we could slow the cancer down, but that I would get weeks (not months or years). I still wasn’t ready for it. 

Before my fiancé and I lived together, every other weekend, Winchester and I would hop into my teeny car and drive the hour and 15 minutes to his house. We’d always swing by the McDonalds drive through. I’d get a Diet Coke for myself... and a plain “absolutely nothing on it” hamburger for him. Everyone at the register would ooh and ahh. Sometimes he’d get an extra burger when they realized it was for him. He’d inhale it in a single gulp every time. I swear... I don’t even really believed that he tasted it. I have a picture somewhere of one of our stops... Just a stupid selfie I took while holding a hamburger in front of his face and sent to let my guy know I was on my way. 

I couldn’t find it to share. But today Winchester got a cheeseburger with absolutely everything on it. He couldn’t really open his mouth... so I was pulling it apart and feeding it to him in pieces... but he mustered up the strength to grab the last half of it and swallow it in a single gulp. 

Dear baby dog - thank you for coming into my life when I needed you the absolute most. Thank you for every night you sat on the floor of my kitchen with me while I cried and drank wine and thought my life was falling apart. Thank you for - for a time - being the only male that I trusted. Thank you for making me feel safe when I was a single mom, living alone with 3 kids and creepy neighbors and a violent ex. Thank you for never getting jealous when I brought a new baby home - even though you were supposed to be the baby. My giant, 90 pound baby.  Thank you for protecting those I loved, for being a gentle giant and for being so many more things. 

Thank you for being more than I ever deserved, but everything I ever needed. 

I will never feel that I had enough time with you. I hope you know how much I love you.  And I hope that you have all the drive through cheeseburgers you could ever want... and that you are getting to chase foxes and deer to your hearts content. And that no one is telling you to stop barking.

LaughingDog711,fdqhq9m,t3_emqkwq,"I just lost my dog two days ago. It was the hardest day of my life. My fiancé and I are so broken up over our it. Thank you for sharing your story. I feel very fortunate to have had my pup for 10 years and stories like this really put it into perspective of how lucky we were. I am very sorry for your loss. I have found no matter how low we are, we’ve been able to recollect a story or moment with him that turns our tears into chuckles and laughter. I hope you and yours find comfort in those tough moments."
keekslarue,fdsa1j2,t1_fdqhq9m,"You are so right! I had my girl for 10 years and was angry that it wasn’t enough, but stories like this really do put it into perspective.

To OP, my heart hurts for you. I lost my 10 year old German Shepherd in July very suddenly to an extremely aggressive cancer as well. I had to put her down 3 days after finding out. She was so weak from the tumor rupturing, and couldn’t breathe because the cancer had spread to her lungs. I felt like an awful pet parent because I didn’t know sooner, but was assured by all the vets that this form of cancer is often called the silent killer, and goes unnoticed until it’s too late. It sounds like Winchester had the best 3 years with you, and I’m sure he wouldn’t trade it for all the drive-through cheeseburgers in the world! 

Rest easy sweet Winchester, and keep an eye out for my old Nadia girl. I’m sure she’d share some cheeseburgers with you ♥️"
meezeestreezees,fdti3pm,t1_fdqhq9m,My dog passed away suddenly on Dec. 16 and I'm still crying every day. It's the first dog I  had as an adult and I'm just heartbroken. I'm very sorry about your loss and OPs.
athanathios,fdqi81o,t3_emqkwq,"I'm so sorry you lost your baby, I had a crisis when my baby was a pup, she got worms and was pooping blood and stuff and got better, but it scared me and then a dog I knew died at 4 years old. I think you did a fantastic job with Winchester (great name too). HE was clearly a happy boy and got a happy life. I love seeing how handsome he was and hearing all about him. I am glad he got years of love and care and a place in your heart always. So sorry for your loss, I'm very sad for you :("

wiredmax,fdqu60x,t3_emqkwq,"I'm very sorry for your loss, I cried a lot while reading your post, reminds me of when my 2 years old, 125 pounds Bernese Mountain Dog, Linux, who died of a lung infection. Used to go hiking with him every 2-3 weeks and was getting a cheeseburgers with no onions in it while on the road. He was such an happy dog, bringing so much joy in our life.

I miss him even years after, I feel too I've never had enough time with him. I'm sure Winchester will always be in your heart like my Linux will always be."

Skipper1240,fdqn5xa,t3_emqkwq,I had a 4 year old German Shepherd who ended up with a lump on his shoulder which turned out to be cancer and it was in the bone so he ended up needed it amputated but that didn’t stop the cancer and about 2 months later it spread to his lungs and he had a lot of trouble breathing so we needed up putting him down and it was probably the saddest day of my life

Your good boy was there even shorter then most. I hope that eventually you can share your heart and love with another dog, but it will be a while to be ready for that. Know that someday you will be reunited at Rainbow Bridge and you can give him all the cheeseburgers you want. A big hug for you and your pain,  please take care of yourself and your kids."

We kept her alive and comfortable for about 6 months until it was time.  I still don’t know how much money we spent.  I told my wife I didn’t care.  I’d of spent every penny if it would have mattered.  

I’ll never see her like again.   And I’ll probably never get over it.  It was 6 years ago on New Year’s Eve.  But I still can’t talk about it.

""There is a cycle of love and death that shapes the lives of those who choose to travel in the company of animals. It is a cycle unlike any other. To those who have never lived through its turnings or walked its rocky path, our willingness to give our hearts with full knowledge that they will be broken seems incomprehensible. Only we know how small a price we pay for what we receive; our grief, no matter how powerful it may be, is an insufficient measure of the joy we have been given.""

BenLaZe,elmrg3,top_level,"I lost my best friend today after he bravely battled cancer. Too soon. Any advice or thoughts on how to deal with the grief would be much appreciated. 

Be nice to someone tonight. That's what Apollo always did.

Here is a photo of him at his favorite place, the off-leash beach: [https://imgur.com/a/PVr86RU](https://imgur.com/a/PVr86RU)"
ajdsgranny03,fdjay39,t3_elmrg3,I know it sounds silly but be sure and allow yourself to grieve...don't be ashamed of tears that come from the loss of your companion. You loved him and he loved you with his whole being.  That's what dogs do. Then find a special place to put his collar ( I have a Black dog statue with 7 collars beside my bedroom door). Now find another special little soul who needs to love you with his or her whole being.  It isn't being disloyal. It's being a dog person and your last little soul would want you to share your love again.
idec_bro,fdlbtoo,t1_fdjay39,"I second this. I lost 2 of my dogs due to cancer and I was devastated and it didn’t help that they both died in the same month. The only thing that got me through it was allowing myself to mourn. Me, my brother and bf had a small little funeral for them which helped a lot. About a year later I adopted a rescue dog and she is one of the best decisions I have made in my whole life."

quietdani,fdjn348,t3_elmrg3,"It’s a week since we said goodbye to our darling girl Frank. We’re still grieving but now we’re remembering the good times with a half smile. We’re lucky really to live in the time we do; there are only a handful of photos of my childhood dog, lots more of our first dog Tess, but endless photos and videos of Frank. My husband has put together a video of all Frank’s greatest moments and it’s so comforting to watch. 

At the weekend, we held a funeral service for Frank. We buried her ashes under our favourite tree in the woods she loved so much, and marked her grave with white roses and a ribbon. My husband played her favourite song (Young Folks by Peter Bjorn and John) and I read a piece I had written about the perfect day we had spent together on a Welsh beach in the summer. Then we walked home together along the canal and shared our favourite memories of our wonderful girl.

Look after yourself x"

ajnsd619,fdjvi9c,t3_elmrg3,"I'm so sorry you lost your boy. Judging by his pic, he was a happy dog. I also lost a dog to cancer, so I know how difficult this time is for you. I experienced a lot of grief - even guilt - in the first few weeks. But after some time, I focused on all the good years my dog enjoyed. You need to focus on all the good days you and Apollo shared. Dogs are way smarter than we give them credit for, and I'm sure Apollo would say you were a good dog owner. I'm not saying this only to lift your spirit, I say this because in the photo Apollo was enjoying a day at the beach. Sadly, most dog owners don't bother. It speaks of your kindness. I used to live in San Diego and in my experience, the happiest dogs were always at the beach. Whenever you think of the pain Apollo endured, be good to yourself and think of the good times you shared."
UsingMyInsideVoice,fdjvnjb,t3_elmrg3,"Just let yourself grieve for him. Trying to squelch the process will just make it harder. And keep in mind that greater grief just means you had a really good relationship while he was with you. Talk about him to someone empathetic if you need to. (You can message me if you need to. I check Reddit several times a day.) It is intense at first when you lose a fur baby, but, as with losing humans, it slowly gets better over time. You never stop missing them, but it does get to where it doesn't hurt quite so much."
athanathios,fdjvu74,t3_elmrg3,"I am so sorry for your loss. I am happy this dog had a good life, surrounded by the best care and love.

I’d see if you could make a book out of all the memories and gather a box of his things.  Last pet I lost was before I had a smartphone, so we had a photo album.  I know there are tons of places that do a nice photo book.  It helped me a lot.

Now, there’s the inevitable conundrum...  I wouldn’t get a dog too soon or else you’ll compare it to your best friend, but then you’re dealing with the empty chasm of his absence.  
Maybe look into volunteering with some animals or doing Rover or something to give you some comfort without commitment in your acute grieving process."

uzzihaas,fdjvb9w,t3_elmrg3,"So sorry for your loss. He looks like he was a super dog and will be sorely missed. What helped me when I lost my pup is to talk to other people about him, sharing funny stories about things he did, etc with people who knew him. It also helped to talk to him in that almost-asleep state of mind, especially if you feel it’s necessary to apologize for anything. I’m not saying that you do, but I lost a pup to a horrible allergic reaction and although I did everything I could to save her, I still felt that I failed because she couldn’t be saved. And it really tore me up inside until I talked to her in my semi-dreams and apologized. 
Hope this helps you. Allow yourself time to grieve. And always remember him and what he meant to you."
slvigilg,fdjvdk2,t3_elmrg3,"I’m so sorry for your loss. There is no pain like this.

Best advice. Just honor his memory. Walk in places you two used to go, remember his terrible puppy moments and his amazing triumphant ones. 
Keep pictures up and always remember your next dog will never be the same but will be equally amazing in their own right. 
If you are lonely, walk shelter dogs in his honor.

Without the trace of a shadow on it.

Life means all that it ever meant.
It is the same that it ever was.
There is absolute unbroken continuity.
Why should I be out of mind
because I am out of sight?

I am but waiting for you.
For an interval.
Somewhere. Very near.
Just around the corner.

All is well."""

mommagator95,fdkgtde,t3_elmrg3,"We lost our wheaten too young as well. They are awesome dogs and my heart breaks for you. The grief is an awful thing to deal with. The quiet house and no fur baby.  It takes time. I’m so sorry. It has been two years and we have added two more dogs to our family, but I still have moments where I cry thinking of our girl. Rip sweet Apollo."
runninggirl9589,fdkhb3k,t3_elmrg3,"Apollo loved you and will always be with you.  Put his collar somewhere special, cry out every tear, and know that time will help.  I know your grief as I am now 13 days since I said goodbye to my sweet golden retriever.  The raw pain will slowly subside.  Take care."

When tomorrow starts without me
And I'm not there to see
The sun will rise and find your eyes
All filled with tears for me
I know how much you love me
As much as I love you
And each time you think of me
I know you'll miss me too
When tomorrow starts without me
Please try to understand
That an angel came and called my name
And petted me with her hand
I thought about our lives together
I know you must be sad
I thought of all the love we shared
And all the fun we had
So when tomorrow starts without me
Don't think we're far apart
For every time you think of me 
I'm right there in you heart.

Having shared our lives with 2 wonderful pups that have crossed the rainbow bridge I feel your pain.

I've been watching videos of people being nice to dogs and crying. Every time someone speaks about him I cry. We washed his bedding and lit candles near his photo display and talk about him...remembering his habits and things from the past. Still in shock a bit...look into the room where he liked to sleep and still expect he's there...or have a sudden feeling that he needs something. I see other dogs but still just want him. Time will heal.

tanuki-robot,embxtq,top_level,"Technically this little dude would be my family's third dog, but I claim him as mine. 
This is Snake! I named him after the main character(s) of my favorite video game series of all time ""Metal Gear"". There's not much of a background, all we and the original rescuer know is that he was found all alone in the middle of nowhere. He's around 6-8 months old and very shy and wary of people; his breed is unknown, but he looks very similar to a Kelpie and he has a little silver speck in his left eye. The lady that captured him said we were the first outside human contact. 
Snake warmed up to us super quick, which is amazing. He has also taken a liking to my older brother's dog, Kira, although she is a little jealous and petty. My ferret, Moses, also seems to have taken a liking to him.

berli456,fdm4chd,t1_fdlk5rc,"> rescue organizations--the good rescue organizations 

Are there bad rescue organizations?"
OceanIsVerySalty,fdm4qub,t1_fdm4chd,"Unfortunately, yes."
berli456,fdm50w4,t1_fdm4qub,"What constitutes as a bad rescue organization? I've been thinking about volunteering, I would seriously like to stay off unethical ones?"
SoXtattiK,fdmtqjr,t1_fdm50w4,Not at all. Any help you can give will only do good. You will know if it's bad.
bobthened,fdmvj09,t1_fdm50w4,There was a bit of a controversy about PETA last year.
twistedfork,fdnfjy8,t1_fdm50w4,"Some rescue orgs are just a way for a person to be an animal hoarder. They are usually easy to spot because of the conditions of the ""rescue."""
luvmycircusdog,fdotxnt,t1_fdm50w4,"the other type of bad rescue organizations are the financially dishonest ones. any hint of secrecy or restriction on who can know what or be involved in what within the organization is a red flag. for example, if the foster families aren't allowed to take their own foster pets to the vet but instead one person or a small group of people are the only ones allowed to take them in. there's always exceptions, and even that could be nothing shady. if, however, most of the animals that they go to the public to contribute to medical care for have poor outcomes from their medical care, one must wonder if they're actually getting that care at all. same goes if the person(s) responsible for financial matters gets offended at requests to see receipts, chronically makes odd excuses for why they can't product the receipts (my foster dog ate the receipt only flies so many times, haha!) or simply habitually ignores requests to produce such documentation. but, again, keep in mind that there's nothing with a bigger tendency to mislead than appearances. so if you're concerned, do your homework, talk to someone else in the organization who's not involved with anything financial and isn't bff's with the person in charge of finances. 

as long as medical care is actually being provided, i'd take a financially ""loose"" rescue over a hoarding one any day. but in the end, any manner of financial shadiness is extremely damaging to the cause and is ultimately stealing not just from contributors but from the animals who should be benefiting from those dollars that manage to find their way into a fund besides the animal care one.

sadly so long as there are entities that need help, dishonest people will use that for their own gain, be it as a means to hoard animals or fill their own bank account disingenuously. in the end, though, the best thing we can do is volunteer ourselves with honor, and, if we find ourselves offering our services to a less than honest operation, take it to the appropriate authorities to investigate far more thoroughly and accurately than your or i could.

i absolutely get not wanting to be a part of a corrupt rescue. but never forget that even if you find yourself smack in the middle of something bad, so long as you've been doing good with your two hands, the animals you came in contact with will still be better off for your having been there and your conscience will be clear. in some cases, the best thing we can do, in fact, is to infiltrate bad organizations with good. i'm not saying you're going to find yourself with a bad rescue, of course, but simply that as long as you're doing what is good yourself, that's... , well, good! :)"

Fattening_Cookie,fdlwv8m,t3_em0qzk,"Thanks everyone! I love her to bits. When they got her the locals said she had been running the streets eating out of fast food garbage cans and she was a mess. She's also a scaredy dog, but once we gained her trust she's a complete velcro dog. Wicked smart.  Her foster worked with her getting her house trained and learning basic commands which was awesome. She is still quite afraid of strangers, particularly young men without beards so that has been a challenge, but overall a great dog and huge love bug to our family. They estimated her to be between 6-8 years old which is exactly what we were looking for. (We dropped a small fortune on her teeth....as bad as you would expect a dog eating trash for an extended period of time would have).  I just can't believe the difference just one year made in this dogs life. She has it made in the shade now and totally knows it."

Fattening_Cookie,fdnm0cr,t1_fdngvh8,"We are pretty sure she's an Aussie mix and she definitely has a lot of Aussie quirks!

She does have some PTSD issues from life on the streets....can be pretty nervous/jumpy, stranger danger, has a really hard time warming up to young, clean shaven men.

thegreatself,en286p,top_level,"My dog is beautiful, and I don't just mean beautiful in the way that all dogs are beautiful - that is, the way in which the 'spirit' of dogs is reflected in attributes like unconditional loyalty, companionship and affection, but really just beautiful in the literal sense - stunning, gorgeous, a head-turner.

Like I said, the essence of all dogs is beautiful no matter appearances, but just like us, some are undeniably better looking than others.

Now, I won't pretend to be an unbiased party, but I've arrived at the conclusion that this is simply an objective fact based on how often people comment whenever we take her anywhere, and since it happens so often, I have a couple of canned responses ready, often settling on ""I know, I tell her that at least once a day myself"" which is actually true and usually gets a chuckle out of them and an eye-roll and maybe a groan from my girlfriend, but we're not talking about her - we're talking about my beautiful, perfect dog.

Guys.. I never thought I was shallow, but I **live** for these compliments - people might as well be calling *me* beautiful because my heart swells with pride whenever somebody says *""What a beautiful dog!""*

*""Thanks, I know. Say it again anyway!""*

*""Oh, yes, she is quite well-behaved, too, but let's talk more about how nice she is to look at.""*

I take great personal offense if I'm walking her or we're driving somewhere and she has her head sticking out the window and I notice people that don't even shoot a brief glance her way. Even worse are people who *do* notice her but don't seem to, for whatever reason (mental deficiency? an inability to appreciate beautiful things?) really take in the splendor and majesty of the creature they're witnessing. If I was Supreme Dictator of Earth (a title and position I made up just now) this would be the test used to determine who gets sent to the labour camps or live freely under my just an benevolent rule.

I just had to get all of that off my chest because if she can't really appreciate the positive attention and compliments she gets then I might as well enjoy them on her behalf.

[Here she is](https://i.imgur.com/4YH1NSS.jpg) - stunning right?

SpringySpaniel,fdv4ovw,t1_fdu36xa,"Do people guess a Rough Collie cross a lot? And did his DNA test contain any rough collie? He is gorgeous, and very rough collie looking to my eye, head shape, ear set and size, colouring even.  


I might steal the term 'supermutt'. I have a dog I adopted as a pup, was told Springer, but I was pretty sure there was something else in there too. Was hard to tell as she hadn't been wormed as a pup and was a bit stunted, but she wasn't as chonky as Springer pups usually are, and her head shape was slightly off for a Springer. I didn't care though, loved her whatever. She caught up on her growth quickly once wormed and on a good diet, and we'd always try to guess what else she was mixed with. Terrier maybe? Whippet? Border Collie? Could have been any of them. Her feathering wasn't coming through the way Springers feathers usually do, her coat was more like a smooth collies when she was young, but with a tufty bristle at the end of her tail that suggested she might get more as she matured.  


As she reached two, her feathering came through properly, but strangely long on her sides, and she got her long white plume of a feathered tail. But not double coated like a Springer. I finally plumped for a DNA test just to satisfy my curiosity. Turns out she's mostly Springer, with a quarter Border Collie (which explains most of her look and her coat) and at least one grandparent was a supermutt! So she has traces of pointer, whippet, and others I can't remember off the top off my head. Adds up to an adorable and smart package though!

I feel the same way about my dog Kora. My husband and I are always talking about how photogenic she is and how she's a rescue but literally who would ever give up such a perfect beautiful dog?! She will be standing and looking at something inquisitively, with one paw up, and we're like ""how is she so majestic?!"" seriously, we're always looking at her just thinking how pretty she is and perfect lol. We had our dog in our engagement photos and she was in our wedding, so we got so many special photos with her and us.

Looking neither right nor left, the little dog stayed right with her mama and went to stand in line for the dry run for an upcoming obedience routine.  The dog looked just like Kora except there was no black on the muzzle.  It was priceless w]to watch."
mintjubilee,fdxmz86,t1_fdtvli6,"Gorgeous! I have a broken coated jrt, too. I just love them.

Gotta say, it’s compliments about my dog’s behavior that I really take pride in. I love hearing she’s “so calm for a jack Russell” because I worked so hard to train a default calm. We spent over a year in obedience classes, but it was worth it. I still remember the pride I felt when my mom took her to the store alone and raved about how she settled into a sit by the register as she paid."

I could never turn down an opportunity to talk about my beautiful dog at length.
thegreatself,fdtqm4m,t1_fdtc17y,"He was beautiful. What was his favourite thing to do? Did he like to talk and sing like mine?

Moths to a flame is pretty accurate. I remember when she was just a puppy how constant the attention she got was - nearly every person we would pass when we were out with her would ask to say hello or pet her - I think that's why now she loves to stare at people whenever we go for walks.. like just zero in on somebody, could be across the street or walking towards her, wherever, and just sit and stare until either I can convince her to keep moving or they acknowledge her and come say hi."

Synaxis,fdtx5mc,t1_fdtqm4m,"He was a very mellow, low energy, sleepy boy. He loved car rides. After his first encounter with cancer left him lame and unable to handle longer walks he really enjoyed going for rides in the stroller I got for him. He liked going to different places and soaking up the attention from friends and strangers alike. He absolutely loved getting acupuncture. He was really pretty quiet and exceptionally well behaved with very minimal effort on my part. 

My guy never really got that trait you describe with the staring. Having every passing stranger want to say hello was just something he happily accepted but didn't really seem to *crave*."
Synaxis,fdwxtld,t1_fdvv5vs,He definitely had way more friends than me!

thegreatself,fdtqvgl,t1_fdtc0l5,"Thank you! And yes, Those kind of compliments are great too, especially since she *is* so well behaved and we have, like you said, both worked hard for that.

And in those moments when she isn't I get that she's just saying ""like you know I'm a wild animal right? you can't fully control me if that's what you think because I feel like you're under the impression you can just tell me what to do and I'm always gonna listen but that's not totally accurate and here's why"" in her own way and I can accept and appreciate that."

Yes yes, we need to train our dogs well, and ensure they are well-behaved and follow the rules of human society for their own safety as well as the safety of others.

OTOH, my collies have all been beautiful (even Dino who wasn't exactly blessed in the looks department, but he was comical and jolly which made up for it).  I love it when others think so too.  Pablo, who was elegant, debonair and sharply dressed (he was a sparkling tri with a lot of chrome), used to get a lot of exclamations, including people stopping in their cars to call out ""what a beautiful dog!"".   None of  the others have gotten the same level of reaction (Pablo had a stylish, graceful charisma) but I still enjoy each and every compliment.

Next to it, I love when people comment on how sweet they are.  In happy, excited situations with people who are showing they want interaction, they like to rub on people like cats and some (Dino the comic) would walk between people's legs which was always good for a laugh.  In ""one-on-one"" situations, collies tend to be very polite. Pablo would look at a person, eye to eye and then gently touch his nose to theirs."

It's just funny because we've have vets, a behaviorist, and even a supposed breeder at a pet store talk about how stunning the German Shepherd is and something about her lineage (don't ask what, I have no idea) but everyone else only talks about the big guy.

(She had teeth and allergy issues that would have kept her from being good breeding stock, but at first and second look she was show quality.) She was also super friendly, incredibly well behaved, and very chill. Dogs and kids normally scared of other dogs ended up loving her. She was literally never in public without someone complimenting her. I. Ate. It. Up.

No pet tax, though, because black poodles photograph poorly. She is a blob in most of the 9000 pictures I took of her."

therealsunshinem81,el4u0u,top_level,"I was walking my dogs, a jack Russell mix and a boarder collie mix after work today. It was warm, it the 50s and we were enjoying our walk. We were about to round the corner and I see a Pitt being walked by two children who appeared about ten and six years old. I immediately turned to walk the other way as I am familiar with this dog as she barks aggressivlely at us almost daily from her yard. The younger child was trying to hold the leash for the Pitt, as soon as she saw my dogs she bolted for us and he let go of her. I tried to block my dogs from her but could not. A viscious melee ensued where I am trying to control all of the dogs while the children screamed and cried. Both of my dogs were injured, though thankfully it does not appear severely. Both have some punctures and lacerations, the vet Gave them pain relief and antibiotics. I am so tired of irresponsible pet ownership, i should be able to walk my dogs in my own neighborhood without worrying about this happening. We called animal control, and they will give them a warning. A warning. I feel sick over all of it. I am worried for my dogs, I want them to be OK. I feel like I should have protected them better, they are the best dogs and they didn't deserve this."
mamidragon,fdfoqcf,t3_el4u0u,"They should have made them pay the vet bill. That's what I do when it happens in my jurisdiction - although if they're demonstrating action towards never letting it happen again, they can end up with a warning \*after\* your vet bills are paid, rather than another $300 fine on top of your vet bills. Looks like you have a good civil case with your local magistrate, anyway. Glad your dogs are ok. This won't be animal control's only dealing with this dog and the next victim might not be so lucky."
therealsunshinem81,fdfpmgl,t1_fdfoqcf,"We are waiting for a call from animal control so we have the owners name and can pursue civil action. I am going to wait to file until they are completely healed up and I know for sure the total costs though. I have been trying to decide how far to take it, thinking about sending pictures of my dogs injuries to their home owners insurance, but my firm belief in karma makes me hesitant to be that petty."
mamidragon,fdft6a4,t1_fdfpmgl,"You wouldn't be petty. The owners of the pit, of the intelligence to let small children walk a strong dog, appear to require consequences to teach them not to let it happen again. Their own dog's life is in as much danger as the next victim's, the way dangerous dog laws can play out. Once your dogs are completely healed and done with vet care, it is not at all petty to pursue reimbursement of the money you had to spend, and assurance that the owner of the other dog make changes that will keep everybody safer in the future. It's karma-friendly, if it gets the owners to make future choices that reduce chances of harm to everyone's pets including their own. In some places animal control could require them to pay damages, but not everywhere has leash laws that are enforceable in this situation, since they had the dog on a leash and it got away. You could always ask. One way or another, I hope you never have to deal with this again."
mangomadness17,fdfriac,t1_fdfpmgl,"I definitely think you should get a lawyer and get their insurance to pay for ALL of the vet bills related to this attack. That includes care and follow up appointments related to this. It's a big deal and it should be treated at such, there's absolutely nothing petty about it. People need to be held accountable for their actions and in this case some idiot allowed two children to walk an aggressive dog, knowing the dog was aggressive and that the children were incapable of keeping the dog under control. Today it was your dogs, who will it be tomorrow and will that animal or person survive? Not only that, but those poor children aren't safe. We all know this situation could have easily resulted in an injured child if the dog had dragged or turned on a child. It happens all the time when dogs fight and owners try to intervene."

timey-wimey2,fdids29,t1_fdfpmgl,"They need to pay your vet bills. Here's my perspective as someone whose dogs attacked another dog.

Some idiot ran into our fence during the night and didn't tell us. It's a section of the fence you can't see from our back door so when we got up in the morning and let the dogs out to pee, we didn't know there was damage to the fence. Both dogs went right through it.

A teenager was walking a intact (not neutered) male dog across the street. I didn't see the initial contact. Our (neutered) male dogs are dog- and people-friendly, so my *guess* is that our dogs ran up to say hello but the dog being walked didn't know what was going on and immediately went into defensive mode to protect his owner. A fight ensued. The screams from the girl and the dogs is something I will never forget.

We ran out with leashes and leashed our dogs but not before there was damage to all three dogs: nothing terrible, punctures and lacerations, but there was blood everywhere, on the dogs, on the ground, on us. It was horrible. The poor girl was still screaming and crying (she wasn't hurt).  

We got our dogs into the car and off to our vet. We called ahead and asked our vet for a recommendation for a vet hospital who could care for the other dog. I stayed with the girl and helped her contact her mom, who came and picked up us and the dogs. I went with them to the vet hospital. I signed the financial forms so their dog could be treated. The vet took the dog back to treat him. I waited in the waiting room with the girl and her mom. Then we all went back into an exam room to talk to the vet about the dog. I recorded everything on my phone, to have a record that we could all be clear about.

They kept that dog in the hospital overnight and released him the next morning, as I said with minor injuries. I talked with the mom after she brought him home the next day. I called again a week later to see how her dog was doing (he's fine, we still see him in our neighborhood and say hello). We paid for all the bills for all three dogs.

I wish I could find the asshole who ran into our fence and drove off (we have cameras now) as I'd sue that person for the costs. But since we don't know how that person is, it's our responsibility, so we paid it and made sure the other dog got good medical care."

Edit: I called the dog dangerous because it attacked. Not because of it's breed. There are plenty of good pits out there. This dog has a proven track record of aggression though."
ohdatpoodle,fdh3nw8,t1_fdfpmgl,"Please, continue taking action to ensure that this pet owner feels the weight of their poor choices and improper care for their dog! You would not see it as a petty action if someone else had been in your shoes before, did not pursue action against the pit owner, and one of your dogs was now critically injured or even dead due to someone else not taking this seriously. In addition to the safety of the dogs involved, a pit lunging suddenly could seriously injure a young child on the other end of the leash. The pit owner owner needs a wake up call. Take action for the protection of your own dogs and other neighborhood dogs in the future. Take action so this negligent owner might learn a lesson!"
Slayro,fdh84qq,t1_fdfpmgl,"That is absolutely NOT petty. This animal is DANGEROUS. By taking all actions against these owners, you are helping to stop this from happening again to your dogs/you/other dogs/other people.

I also believe in karma, but immediate action is needed. Next time this happens (and it will happen again, if this isn't stopped), the person or animal on the receiving end may not be so lucky.

I definitely understand that pressing this issue seems daunting, but I strongly recommend that you do.

Our older one pulled at everything. He ran away quite a bit, and me as a child, was unable to hold him back. Our second one was a follower. 

My parents always yelled at me that I needed to walk the dogs, so I kept doing it. They ran away nearly a dozen times, from what I can remember. They always came home within a day or two in one way or another (I recall them being brought back by people one time, since they called the numbers on their tags.) I don't think my parents realize just how lucky we are that they were never injured or harmed.

Although I loved both of them, things got easier when the first passed. The second one stayed by your side and carried his own leash.

I see it far too often in my neighborhood. Usually the parents ask the kids to take the large dog out to pee... an attack almost happened once to us with a small child and a doberman, luckily they were on the sidewalk and I could turn around before the dog started charging. But the kid made to significant effort to stop or remove the dog when it started pulling towards us. 

I just don't get it. Young kids holding massive dogs that I would have trouble stopping if they started charging. I never see kids out holding tiny dogs, only big dogs."

I'm getting some pepper spray to carry on our walks. I just don't know what else to do.

Something similar happened to me once too. A kid that lives near me took his German Shepard on a walk without a muzzle (a very aggressive dog, at the time he had already attacked the next door dog 2 times). This dog was too strong and ran away from the kid, came to my house and started barking and growling at my dog. The thing is my dog was in my yard, inside the house, but the german Shepard managed to bite him through the fence. There was so much chaos, I had to jump through the fence and grab the other dog myself since the kid didn't react. Had a big fight with his parents and they called the cops, nothing happened to them since there's no clear rules about pet ownership in my country.

I'm not against aggressive dogs taking a walk, they do need to exercise, but please be responsible and don't let someone not strong enough to be able to handle them take them out. Also please put a muzzle if they have a record bitting other dogs."

If I want to walk my dogs, it has to be between 3AM - 5AM, because staring at about 530 in the morning, there are about SEVEN households in my immediate neighborhood that somehow think it's acceptable to let their 25lbs and under dogs out for the day to roam. My dogs are under control when we're out, but there's only so much I can do when a tiny little unsupervised chihuahua runs up and tries to bite my dogs feet - and my dogs are 150lbs and 130lbs, so one bite from them and these loose dogs are bite-sized toast. 

And THEN. There's the dozen or so houses that have mid to large sized dogs, and THREE FOOT FENCES. Like buddy, hate to burst your bubble, but your pitt mix can and will hop that fence the moment it sees something it wants on the other side. Your neurotic GSD that you leave outside 24/7 and never interact with will leap it no problem. It's just a matter of time.

AND FINALLY....plEASE. do NOT wear noise cancelling headphones and walk around the neighborhood with your very clearly dog-aggressive pitt and stop in front of every yard with a dog to let him lunge, foam at the mouth, and attempt to fight through the fence each and every dog he sees. I can't even believe I saw this happen with my own two eyes, MULTIPLE TIMES. I had to switch my chain link for an even taller wooden fence specifically because this lady kept walking by to let her dog do it's very best to start a fight with mine.

I see it all the time in my apartment complex where they let 4-10 year olds walk BIG DOGS without an adult it's just asking for an attack to occur. I have had numerous run ins with my mastiff on leash being harassed by a dog where the kid couldn't hold the leash and just let it go. I usually yell at the dog NO firmly and most of the time they stop but my mastiff barks loud and he will let them know he is not there to play. I am almost tempted to get a body camera like the cops have to defend my dog when crap like this occurs.
therealsunshinem81,fdi78jp,t1_fdha8t6,"It is not the first time these children have had this dog out, the last time it tried to charge my dog but there were two other children with them and they were able to control it. And by control it I mean stop its advance when it was about halfway across the road to us and two of the kids laying down holding the leash. A body cam is not a bad idea, especially considering had i had an aresol deterrent yesterday the kids running after the dog would likely have caught some of it and that could have caused me some issues."
SeeYouOn16,fdhe0ah,t3_el4u0u,There was a known aggressive dog in my old neighborhood that would sometimes get out.  After a not so close call but a bit of a scare I bought a collapsible baton on amazon and carried that with me for future walks.  It was nice peace of mind knowing I would be able to defend myself and my 2 dogs.
therealsunshinem81,fdi29lt,t1_fdhe0ah,I will check them out. Not sold on the mace/bear repellant yet or a taser. Trying to balance safety/effacy/convienence and find the best option I am comfortable with. Thanks for the suggestion.
SummerHart,fdhwtio,t3_el4u0u,"I don't know if you'll read this comment, but something similar happened to me a few months ago. While out walking my dog, I saw someone fairly far off had an off leash dog. We turned the opposite way when I saw it but the dog ran for mine, knocked me down and all three dogs fought and I was bitten several times and got gashes on my arms and hands.  If not for a kind person who stopped to help, I don't know what would have happened. Afterward my two dogs started showing aggression towards each other and even fought once. It's like we were all traumatized. I ended up rehoming one of my dogs to a friend, and I'm scared to go on walks anymore. I hope you're okay and things work out better for you. It's hard to believe people are so reckless sometimes."
therealsunshinem81,fdi10d7,t1_fdhwtio,"I am so sorry that happened to you, and having to rehome after something like that must have been so hard. Someone stopped and helped me yesterday too she helped get the kids and the dog moving along once I got them seperated. So far they have still been best buds today, snuggling on the couch and wanting to play and wrestle. I am keeping my fingers crossed that their relationship doesn't change. Thank you for your kind wishes!"
edgepatrol,fdgnm87,t3_el4u0u,">a Pitt being walked by two children

This should never happen. You were lucky...and I would hold the owners accountable to the fullest extent possible. Often, AC's hands are tied, especially on the first report. I wish they could fine the pit's owners for the cost of the vet bills. :-/  Are you in a ""strict liability"" state? That might give you some leverage to recoup your expense (if not the suffering) and put some consequences on the pit's owner."
pueblodude,fdhazz0,t3_el4u0u,"I was bit by an unattended, young pit bull and had the owners pay for the medical bills. I'll never trust that breed."
adidashawarma,fdgyhqq,t3_el4u0u,"So scary. One time,  my partner and I were walking through a park with our two leashed dogs. From the top of a hill comes a pit bull leashed to a 12 year old boy who is ON ROLLERBLADES who is understandably unable to control the dog. The dog yanked so hard to get to us that the boy wiped out on the path but kept hold of the leash. We couldn’t believe our eyes. I don’t know what the hell kind of experiment this was. 

Btw, where I live pit bulls are a banned breed (since 2005) to lend some insight into the overall responsibility of whomever the owners are."

therealsunshinem81,fdfocx3,t1_fdfmx7g,"Looked like not home, but I'm not sure. Animal control was supposed to contact them and call back, it has been 4 hours and we have not heard anything."
je_taime,fdfsmew,t1_fdfocx3,Irresponsible. That is crazy irresponsible of them.
stargazer275,fdfqpvo,t1_fdfocx3,Not home?? Been 4 HOURS?? I thought this story is already bad but goodness me it keeps getting worse! So now there are two little kids home alone for goodness knows how long with a reactive dog they have no way of controlling. What if the dog bites the kids next? Is it too crazy to call a non-emergency line like 311?
therealsunshinem81,fdfrpgf,t1_fdfqpvo,"Their car was not in the driveway when we left for the vet, which is why I assumed they were not home at that time immediately following the attack. It was however there when we got back. It has been four hours since we reported the attack to athorities, they were supposed to get back to us and have not. It is now after hours here and the phone goes to an answering service that only deals with emegencies. It is not crazy to call the police, but they will not come, they do not deal with animal issues and will refer us to the phone number that is being answered by the service only dealing with emergencies. To say that this incident has shown a huge light on the inadequacies of our local animal control, their powers and operations would be a massive understatement.
Editing to add, that those inadequacies are fueled 100% by inadequate funding and poor outdated ordinences and not the fault of animal control officers who do the best they can with what they have while doing what I am sure is sometimes a very unpleasant job."
stargazer275,fdfykij,t1_fdfrpgf,"I was honestly more worried about the children. If I were to call 311 in this situation, it would be over the concern of leaving young children unattended with an animal that has proven to be aggressive and out of control. That’s less of an animal control issue, I feel like. But you’re right, animal control is often underfunded and overworked. I’m sure they’re doing the best they can.

But more importantly, it sounds like their parents are home already, and if I’m not mistaken you’ve mentioned somewhere your dogs are OK. Well then, phew. I just hope the animal control officers get back to you soon, so you don’t ever have to deal with this again. Keep us posted!"
crotchhound,fdfw1z3,t3_el4u0u,"Sorry this happened, I had an almost identical situation happen to me when I was 14 walking my dad's dog. It scared me really bad at that age, and I get very nervous seeing obviously uncontrolled and loose pits now when I walk my own dog. Our dog was physically okay but she was leash reactive the rest of her life too, and walking her past other dogs became almost impossible for years. I hope yours bounce back and the neighbors learn from this... though I suspect not 🙄 it takes a special level of irresponsibility and stupidity for this to occur in the first place."
therealsunshinem81,fdfwj0z,t1_fdfw1z3,"I really hope we don't have long term behavioral issues from this. My dogs are normally fine on a leash and only reactive when uncontrolled dogs are running twords them. I also suspect this will only be a learning experience for me, going to look into some bear repellant tomorrow."
gillish,fdgwt5y,t3_el4u0u,I’m so sorry this happened to you. It seems like you are taking all the right steps. I recommend walking your dogs with bear mace on hand until this situation is resolved. That way if the pit comes near your dogs again you have a way to interrupt the charge and create time to escape.
lazydaysjj,fdh0sis,t3_el4u0u,"It happened to my little 8lb yorkie walking in the neighborhood, attacked by an off-leash german shepherd. The injuries from the attack nearly killed her, and she required wound cleaning and irrigation daily and almost had to have a skin graft. Luckily she recovered with no long term damage. I think the shitty owner paid the first bill but my parents had to foot the rest of those costs. People suck. 

Having a little dog is a bit easier because you could pick them up if needed but it's hard to avoid a loose dog when you have larger or multiple dogs. I would suggest carrying a stick, spray, airhorn, or some kind of defense to use to scare away dogs if needed."
therealsunshinem81,fdh40hy,t1_fdh0sis,"I put some bear repellant in my amazon cart this morning.

matraveo,fdhaoem,t1_fdh40hy,"Just be careful becuase too high of potency can permanently damage a dog, even human grade is risky too, especially if your dog is caught in the pepper spray crossfire. But bear would be overkill for all involved."
nazgool,fdhxzqw,t1_fdhaoem,"I've seen videos of pits that have no reaction to the spray even when sprayed directly in their eyes and noses, so I'm not even sure it's worth using after a fight breaks out.  I personally carry ""gel"" because it's supposedly easier to control. But, I carry it for use against humans, not dogs.  YMMV, but it's not my ""go to"" for an attack.

For dogs I carry a knife (specifically for dogs) and stun gun (also for use against humans)."
NoOdrick,fdhc3m4,t1_fdhaoem,I agree that bear repellent is too much. There is dog repellent spray for people with your exact situation. I would go for that

IEatAndTravel,fdh6w9t,t3_el4u0u,"My dog is under 10lbs and there are places I just can't go with him, such as a beautiful park in my own neighborhood, because even though the whole place is plastered with signs that say dogs MUST be on leash, there are still off-leash dogs running around everywhere, and not all of them are friendly. Small children walking a pit bull might as well be off-leash, too, because they are too strong to be controlled by a small child. If that dog is aggressive and attacking other animals, it absolutely must be reported and your reaction is NOT too strong...that dog attacked once so there's a good chance it will do it again. Next time your dog, or somebody else's dog might not be so lucky as to get away with a few minor injuries. It could be much worse. And frankly if somebody's neglect ended up getting MY little dog injured or killed, they would have hell to pay for it."

fastonmyfeet,fdg1yv6,t3_el4u0u,"Sorry to hear this happen to you. I hope your pups get better very soon. Unfortunately, this happens often. A few weeks back I was walking my dog at the park and saw a grown pit basically dragging two kids. I mean the kids could not have been older than twelve years old and they could barely hold on to the leash. It was obvious the dog was not trained to walk on a leash because he was pulling insanely hard. We were behind them so I fell back to stay out of sight of the pit. Since my dog is on the smaller side I really wanted to put distance between us. Luckily an older gentleman that was walking by stepped in and took control of the dog before anyone got hurt."

Mine just took it and cried while I screamed and kicked the other dog until the owner came out and was able to drag it away. Luckily the owner was really nice and invited me inside, and she helped me check over my dog. Luckily he only had a torn ear and the vet was able to glue it back together. The owner paid for the vet fees and she said she would get rid of the dog. I know how scary it is."

I_pinchyou,fdhbrz2,t3_el4u0u,"This sucks. I'm sorry your doggies got injured, and hope the owners will be more responsible with their dog. 
I had dog aggressive Boxers. I controlled them completely while out and walking, however I would never have allowed a stranger let alone a small child walk them in fear they would react and pull off their leash. 
What sucks is that I would encounter multiple people walking their dogs off leash or on those terrible retractable leashes in a suburb where leash laws and 6 foot leashes or less are enforced. Many of these owners got upset with ME because their dog (usually unleashed) would run up to mine and mine would growl and snap at them. I always used a traffic leash, my dog was always 2 feet from my side at all times. 
I had a gentleman running with a lab, his lab ran up to my dog and I yelled out ""please get your dog"" and he yelled back oh he's friendly. Then total chaos ensued with my dog being attached to my arm and leash the entire time. I kept dragging him away and the lab kept ""trying to play""
It ended with him telling me I shouldn't have my dog out of my home because he is agressive. Needless to say I was pissed and said I had control of my dog and told him he shouldn't be walking his dog without a leash. 
Some dog owners are disappointing."
Xbsnguy,fdi77fx,t3_el4u0u,"You did the best you could with what you had in an unexpected situation. If I were you though, I'd carry around a canister of bear mace or plain 'ol pepper-spray on my  hip in case you run into this situation again."

I ended up yelling ""hey lady can you call your dog???!"" And home it went. From that day forward, I decided for me and my dog's protection, I would carry pepper spray on our walks. I really don't want to put my pet or myself in harm's way due to someone else being an irresponsible pet owner, and as much as I dont want to pepper spray anyone's dog, if it comes between my safety or their dog's comfort, I'm choosing my own safety!"

Idk I might be overreacting but those kids are literal babies walking an aggressive dog that they cannot control. It's another child mauling waiting to happen. Also they should be paying your vet bills, hopefully you can pursue this and get their dog taken away before another dog falls victim to this."

My neighbor had an aggressive Akita, he would break the invisible fence to go after my German Shepherd. I’d call AC, and they would help to a point. Finally I consulted my attorney and asked what right I had in my state. Since I had filed numerous reports the animal could be considered a nuisance. And the aggressive behavior was well documented. Sadly, and I mean that, i did end up putting him down when he went after my dog a few months ago. 

There were no grounds for charges and my dog is now safe."

If your dog is reactive on a leash muzzle it, muzzles protect your animal too because most people will give a muzzled animal a wide berth,  if you don't want to muzzle walk in unpopulated areas or at times when other people are not likely to be out.  If your dog injures someone their dog or damages someones property, you should be the one reaching out offering to pay."

buttermycrispyflake,fdg2qdu,t3_el4u0u,"I own a pit bull and I would never ever in a million years let a child walk him. He’s almost 100lbs and strong as hell. He is extremely kind and sweet. He’s also extremely well trained on a leash, but god forbid if he found a smell he wanted to mark or got excited seeing another furry friend walk past then those kids would be dragged across the road. He knows when my leash is tight to knock it off and stay next to me but kids don’t know when to do that nor are strong enough to do so, considering that dog is even properly leash trained in the first place! 

I am so sorry this happened to you and your furry friends. I would 1000% be paying for the vet bill, but luckily I am not an incompetent owner and would never put anyone at risk by letting children walk a strong, powerful dog. I genuinely hope this does not change your view on pit bulls. It is so unfortunate that this category of puppers gets subjected to idiotic or cruel owners and your situation is the result of it! Again, I am so so sorry and hope your fur babies heal soon!"
therealsunshinem81,fdgeus6,t1_fdg2qdu,"Thanks for your well wishes! It doesn't change my mind about the breed, I have met sweet and gentle pits. It does however re-enforce my opinion that we need some regulation of breeding and ownership of these animals to keep them out of the hands of shit owners as much as we can. They are not more aggressive then other breeds, however their bites are so much more devistating, they should only be allowed in the hands of experienced and responsible owners."

**I just saw a kid 10 year old get pulled down to the ground yesterday by a 20 pound dog** trying to make it's way to another dog. Partner had to run over and help because the dog it was pulling towards was an elderly, aggressive Golden Retriever we were familiar with (we run our pittie at the park every day and know the regulars). Parents of the kid were on the other side of the park. They got an earful from us. That Golden Retriever is not just dog aggressive, but aggressive towards strangers.

As long as I walk my dog he behaves well but dogs are sneaky and like to pull tricks whenever their owner isn’t around. Even if the child is apart of the family, they’re not the dominant human the dog listens to. It’s just irresponsible and reckless for everyone and every dog involved."

I am honestly not sure, I was trying desperately to hold three dogs with two hands, so I couldn't really keep tabs on that."
IAmPandaRock,fdhca9c,t1_fdge9v0,"For court, just look at the cost of filing in small claims vs the vet bills and any other costs.  If the vet bills are 50% or so more higher, I'd probably go for it, especially if you have any witnesses or any other evidence that it was their dog that bit yours.  Ask neighbors if they have a any doorbell cam footage. Also, before you memory fades, write down your recollection, especially a to what the dog walkers looked like and what the dog looked like (it may be easier to ID the kids).  See if you can find out whether the dog has been reported before.  Other than that, just gather up all of your vet bills for evidence of damages."

Another was losing her coat just because she is older and some breeds shed winter coat and the hair didn't  grow back as well the older they got.

There was only 2 who were severe and it was because the owners unfortunately had a flea infestation tried to treat with a triple dose of meds, and flea shampoo that was in that time frame where it was doing medical damage to dogs and cats when used.

I gave him some Benadryl and I'll see what the vet says Monday I appreciate it."
Breezy2014,fdwnef6,t1_fdtasan,This! We adopted an older dog in August and she was losing all of her hair and got sores (she was itchy) because she had a sensitivity to chicken. We switched her diet up and she’s got a full healthy coat again.
mamadgaf,fdtudol,t1_fdtor17,If it’s allergies we give one of our dogs a Zyrtec daily to help manage his symptoms. The vet said a regular human dose was fine for him and he’s 20 pounds.

jacksmom2019,fdymvna,t1_fdtudol,"Yeah, me too. Mine's 40 lbs.

I think Zyrtec would be better than Benadryl."

irrASHionalLEA,fdvyqqd,t3_en21kr,"What a pretty guy! Hair loss around the neck on these older guys can usually be attributed to their collars (tied outside on a chain or rope), skin allergies (food or environmental), or pests/fungus. 

Just a heads up: if we saw him come into the clinic we would start with 1) scan for microchip 2) full physical exam/rabies vaccination update (if healthy enough for vaccinations) 3) skin scrape to identify potential cause of the hair loss 4) finally, diagnosis and treatment plan. Additionally, we might recommend some bloodwork just to see where he stands systemically. Sadly many owners will also dump at the thought of lengthy treatment for a recent diagnosis. Fortunately from your picture nothing screams I AM CAUSING HAIR LOSS like apparent bites or abscess. 

In the meantime I would take extra measures to protect you and your family in case you do have some sort of pest. Demodex is a pain to knock out especially in multiple pet homes and don't get me started on ringworm. Wash your hands and try to keep him separate from other family members and pets until Monday and do not try to treat the area with a bunch of online remedies if you can avoid it (this will help the vet in the long run). 

Check out some prescription or limited ingredient dog food in case he is a food allergy boy. Personal fav is the Hydrolyzed Protein from Royal Canin! Good Luck and Congrats!"
DogNipsForDays,fdw84ty,t1_fdvyqqd,Are you thinking of sarcoptic mange? Demodex isn't contagious unless another pet in the home has a surpressed immune system.
irrASHionalLEA,fdxav33,t1_fdw84ty,"No I'm not but thanks for mentioning that one as well. Good thing to watch out for. Also not sure about the immune systems of OPs pets, but I would personally take the same precautions with my pet no matter the type. Mange is not fun!"

Hugging my dog so hard after reading this post. I hate that such horrible people exist but I’m glad that this dog was dumped on your property. Not that it makes what happened okay, just glad people like you exist. I saw in the comments that you’ve saved a number of dogs over the years and I think that’s incredible.

Mydogsnameismegatron,fdvjnff,t3_en21kr,"Overall coat condition is heading downhill. Dull coat, some missing fur patches, scabs, and dry skin.. looks like here is some inflammation as well. My guesses are either early mange, or autoimmune issue. If this were just allergies/flea bites I would expect to see scabs/itching/redness/missing fur specifically around the base of the tail, working its way up the back, and possible signs of developing staff infection. 

Good luck! Also, thank you for taking care of this guy. I acquired a stray mama dog just before New Years, so I understand the frustration.. she was clearly a pet earlier in her life, which breaks my heart. She visited the vet his week, and it turns out she is heartworm positive, has GI parasites, and needed to be spayed. I highly advise the heartworm test and GI parasite treatment especially if you have other dogs.. these are not fun or cheap issues to deal with."
yeahijustdidit308,fdvrjd4,t1_fdvjnff,I was thinking mange myself. I really hope it works out with the mom and pups.
SweetTeaBags,fdw21jo,t3_en21kr,"Poor booger looks like they have the same issues as my dog and my best friends dog, both of ours are pits, but hers has sharpei mixed in which this one looks like it has. Her girl has far more sensitive skin than mine. Probably some skin infections. Probably an allergy to something also. I'm still working through the issue myself, but finding that frequent baths did help especially if I massage the shampoo in his coat for a good 3-5 mins. I've backed off during the winter. I was giving him fish oil (vet recommended the human kind 1000 mcg due to cost), but it didn't make a difference to him. Maybe it will for you. Apoquel helped a lot, but wrecked his sensitive stomach. Miconohex-Trix shampoo might help. I'm actually thinking that whatever food my vet put him on recently is helping with his skin too because it's looked a lot healthier (Hill's low fat) lately."
4nimal,fdwhoyf,t3_en21kr,"Like other people have said, this looks like allergic dermatitis. Could have been from fleas, food, contact, whatever. In addition to the Benadryl, try to keep puppy from scratching (with an oatmeal type bath, moisturizers, the cone of shame, etc.) and gently keep the area clean."
Daunting_dirtbag_101,fdwsgxy,t3_en21kr,"The hair loss on the back/neck doesn’t look like mange or anything too serious imo. Looks like it it could be seasonal alopecia. I imagine some tlc can help. Additionally, maybe try coconut oil on the areas of hair loss."
gitmajonez1,fdwzmy3,t3_en21kr,"Thank you good human for helping this pup.

I can't comprehend how some people just dump animals they dont want in the middle of nowhere. 

I'm no expert but maybe it is an allergy? Allergy to fleas, my poor doggie had similar issue when I brought him home many years ago. Again,  thank you for caring."
RavynSegen,fdxer91,t3_en21kr,"I'd be willing to bet it's Demodectic mange. Which isn't contagious, but it looks nasty. He doesn't look like he's red and irritated like it's Sarcoptic mange. However this could also be an extreme reaction to a food allergy. A lot of dogs actually are allergic to cheaper dog foods and react with a yeasty smell in their feet and fur loss with a lot of scratching too. My brothers pitt cannot process grains, she ends up looking pretty similar to this guy whenever she gets into cheaper dog food that she shouldn't have. It's at least a cheaper fix though."
crtnymlr,fdxnnr6,t3_en21kr,He looks like he has some shar pei and shar peis are very prone to skin allergies. Not just from external contact but also from the foods they eat. This looks like the rashes my shar pei used to get. Fish oil helps a lot.
samnsara,fdxssta,t3_en21kr,bless you.. this is how my mom got all her dogs. Some people are just cruel..
llahrichard,fdygwmb,t3_en21kr,Bless your heart for keeping him! 👍🐶🐾
jbudd1,fdwxeu1,t3_en21kr,Very sad.  Hope he gets sorted out and a decent home.
jacksmom2019,fdyima7,t3_en21kr,"Yeah, I think it's skin sensitivity too. Probably food related. Mine are allergic to chicken, white potatoes and grass mostly amongst others but those -3- scored the highest.  It can also take up to 2wks to get the allergic food out of their system. 
I know because I had mine tested for allergies. The allergist told me to try to find a Kangaroo based food and I found Zignature Kangaroo at couple of local stores and Chewy has it too. 
They have been on it for quite awhile and I've had no problems. 
For the grass allergy,  I give them Zyrtec daily and my yard man keeps the grass cut at the lowest level on his mower. 
If you can't find the Kangaroo,  I would go with a Lamb based food but be sure you check out the back label to make sure that it doesn't have chicken or white potatoes in it.
Also a good bath with a Hypoallergenic doggie soap would be good too. Your vet might tell you weekly until the pup heals up.
Another thing, cheap, bad dog food can do this too and maybe fleas.  
On food, I have always used the following dog food website:
Dogfoodadvisor.com"
Twzl,eo5tdp,top_level,"I am the dog person for the family, so when someone has a dog question, they come to me. 

My SO's cousin's wife talked to me over the weekend. She wants to get her husband a dog. She wants to get him either a Rhodesian Ridgeback or a Great Dane, or a mix of the two or a Wolfhound.

She doesn't like dogs. She doesn't like how they're so happy to see you when you get home, how they are, in her words, ""so needy"". She doesn't like fur. She doesn't like mud. She doesn't like drool. She really just does not like dogs. 

But her husband wants one so she wants to get one for him as a gift.

She told me she wants a big chill dog that can do its own thing and not need much human attention. And she wants it to live in the yard. In New England, but she doesn't want to fence the yard because it would look ugly. Oh and they have bee hives, so the dog has to leave the bees alone. I guess via magic? I have no idea.

She'd like a puppy because that way they can train it right. I asked her if she'd ever trained a dog and she told me she did grow up with them, but never trained them. But her husband is an AMAZING dog trainer. 

Now I've known her husband since he was a teenager so I know damn well he didn't grow up with dogs. He's never owned a dog. So I said, look, G's never owned a dog so I'm not so sure he's actually an amazing dog trainer. She blinked at me. I told her you guys should probably get an adult dog, and even then, **you need to go to training classes**. 

I then asked her who would deal with the dog when they're not home? They live with the grandparents who are 99 and 95 years old and thus not capable of dealing with a teenaged huge dog. But cousin's wife told me that they could deal with the dog, and if not, their neighborhood is filled with retired people who have nothing to do so she can ask them to stop in and care for the dog if they're on vacation, or working late. And now I'm picturing some sweet old lady walking into the home that contains an untrained Rhodesian Ridgeback. I mean, what can go wrong?

In all the time they've been to our house, she has never once interacted with my dogs. She's ignored them, she's pushed them out of her way, she's not once petted one or said hi to one. They're just non-entities to her. 

At this point, if I didn't know better, I'd be sure she was trolling me, but I know better so I know she's serious. 

On our drive home, as I fumed and told the story to my husband, he said that odds are cousin's wife learned all she needed to know about Great Danes from either [this](https://www.comixology.com/Marmaduke/comics-series/11333) or [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooby-Doo). We have no idea where she came upon Rhodesian Ridgebacks or why she thinks one would be fine lying about the unfenced yard all day. 

Anyway, I sent her the URL's for the Great Dane club of America and the Ridgeback club. And I sent her URL's for training places near them. I know she won't take any of my advice, or the advice on the web sites (clubs often have a, ""do you really want this breed??"" information), but I tried. 

And now I'll go beat my head against the wall. There's so much, ""this is a terrible idea!!"" but people don't listen or they think they know better."

I know infinitely more that are strongly bonded to ONE person and are desperate for their attention, but really couldn't care less about anyone else. These are the cats that make people THINK they don't want affection, because the cat doesn't want THEIR affection. 

My SO's cats really don't care about me. The male accepts my love when he's lonely, but the female would probably not notice if I never came home. In fact, she might be happier that way. She only has room in her heart for him, but my god is she demanding of him."

I had a girl come on this sub asking for advice because her two intact female dogs who were aggressive towards eachother were also aggressive towards her new intact male dog. Any reasonable person would tell you to consult a professional and get your dogs fixed for health and behavioral reasons. Unless you live in like Sweden, Norway, or some other country with weird laws. 

Anyways, I tell this girl and things just get worse from there. She's planning on breeding two of her aggressive dogs and the male dog she just ""rescued"" is a stud she bought directly from a puppy mill. It has severe behavioral issues from being abused and it isn't health tested at all. She also doesn't want to consult a professional even though one dog has injured one of the new dog's eyes. 

So I start discussing the dangers of breeding animals when you don't have experience and medical knowledge and she gets *pissed*. Listen lady, I have worked in an actual rescue setting as a volunteer and I have seen awful things. I saw a dog get surrendered after the stud ran while tied and it caused a prolapse in the bitch. We had someone bring in a dam who died in my arms because a puppy was too big for her to birth. We were a block away from the animal hospital.

Don't know how old your dogs are but I'll guess at least 2-3?  If you are 45 and your dogs live another 10 years, you will be 55. If 12, then 57. I was 56 when we got little puppy Alfie.  I expect sooner or later there'll be at least another collie or Sheltie puppy or two in our future.

mangomadness17,fe9cr0o,t1_fe96mqm,"They really don't. Some cats do their own thing, but most are clingy bastards and they all require tons of attention. We had tons of cats brought back in when I volunteered in animal rescue because people would bring them back thinking they were no more needy than fish and even fish are needy. 

My cat is fine on her own while I work, but once I'm home she clings to me like crazy. She and my dog are made of velcro and every single day they compete for space on my lap. My dog wants to hang out on my lap while I study and eat, but he can't get on my lap while I'm in a chair. My cat, however, can and she will jump and lay there while I do my work."
ohphoebelay,fe99p2o,t1_fe96mqm,"As a cat owner with outside experience with cats, these people would absolutely be a horrible fit for a cat. Cats are needy, cuddly, clingy, but if they're ""misbehaving"" you can't modify their behavior (except in a few circumstances) so you have to modify your own. Don't want cat hair in your food? In your bed? On your counter? Don't get a cat.

People who aren't familiar with dogs or cats often default to aversion techniques used on dogs. They don't work well with dogs, but cats don't operate like dogs. A dog will likely avoid the behavior and become withdrawn or aggressive. Cats, in response to punishment, hide and lash out - but don't typically avoid the behavior. Ultimately, people like this would probably just put the cat outside and never see it again."
ppw23,fe9gda4,t1_fe9cr0o,"I’ve had a few cats in my life and agree, they’re very needy, loving beings. As such they require attention!! The lady sounds delusional, I feel bad for any pet in their home. Maybe an aquarium would be best?"

nazgool,fe9mqvb,t1_fe99p2o,"As I stated to the other person (copy/pasted)...

Owned cats for 40+ years. I've never *not* had a cat in my life, and I've had experience with a variety of personalities. I've had barn cats, indoor cats, indoor/outdoor cats, purebred cats, shelter cats, etc.

Cats are just plain easier overall... in *my personal* experience.  They are much easier to have as an indoor/outdoor pet, and while I've had affectionate cats, they were not excessively ""needy"", and I must have a different idea of what ""clingy"" is (implies negative mental state, imo).  It is much easier to find an aloof, easy going, and relatively mellow cat.  In fact, I've never owned a cat that had any major issues. I've had little issues modifying their behavior with relatively simple changes or techniques, but it does require different types of efforts than dogs.  Granted, none of those behaviors have ever been extreme. 

It's not hard to find an easy going primarily outdoor cat that requires minimal affection. Just as it's not hard to find a cat that's clingy and needy.  YMMV but my lifetime of experience has been one that is the opposite of yours. Maybe I've just been extremely lucky with the cats I've had. /shrugs

But especially for an African breed which was bred to hunt and guard in packs... 

Putting aside the prey drive and possible aggression from an unsocialised guard dog breed. RR's are actually extremely social, they have a very strong sense of pack/family. I don't think an RR could cope with this kind of isolation. Not to mention they are extremely cold sensitive...

Now, a year later, she ignores it all and gets a puppy mill goldendoodle after doing no breed research.  They can't afford vet care, train, ect beyond bare bones basics. All the work is on her.  They are going to get rid of it after not training it like every other pet they've had, and some other poor soul will have to attempt to fix their unsocialized, untrained hot mess of a dog.

mamadgaf,fe9t29q,t3_eo5tdp,"I did not grow up with dogs. I was not a dog person until about two years ago. My mom was allergic and I was raised that dogs are animals, not family. I had family with dogs and my parents hated visiting because the dogs would be all in your face etc. 

My ex-husband was allergic to dogs. He was raised with outdoor dogs - mainly hunting dogs - and to him dogs are animals and not family 

When I divorced I got a puppy. It was rough, but I raised 2 kids and a puppy is easier. My partner brought a dog with him when he moved in. So now we had 2 dogs. 

It took me a few months to acclimate to having dogs. Dog hair on the couches and our clothes, the indoor peeing, the barking at noises and people walking on the street. I remember telling him I thought dogs were supposed to be relaxing but they’d start barking out of nowhere and startled me. 

Now, I am a Dog Person. I LOVE them. We even adopted another, older, dog when her family couldn’t take care of her anymore. I love when I’m curled up on the couch with all three of them - they’re very different in size, 8 lbs, 20 lbs, and 60 lbs. It makes for some interesting walks! 

My point is that some people need to experience having dogs to fall in love with them. I now sleep with 3 dogs in my full sized bed, with my partner, I have no leg room, and I’ve never been happier.

She saw me graduate school, get married, buy a house and discover we were pregnant.  She saw me through a crappy home situation, usually made me laugh and occasionally made me throw my hands up in exasperation.  Now that she's gone I find I'm still learning from her, about patience and generosity and the kind of legacy I want to leave.

Thank you for the gift of perspective - now that you're gone, my most vivid memories are all the walks we took, the naps on the couch, the evenings in front of the television.  What I wouldn't give for one more completely ordinary day, you sitting next to me on the couch as I work.  One more walk in the sunshine.  And thank you for making me realize that sometimes love calls us to make the most difficult decision, to put the needs of another above our own wants.  I wanted you to stay so bad, I would have given anything.  But you were suffering and I understand it would have been selfish to ask you to stay.

Even though there are times my heart hurts so much I can't breathe, I wouldn't trade our time together for anything.  I love you so much.  Rest easy my sweet girl, and know that there will never be a day you don't cross my thoughts.

sentienta,eo5ud3,top_level,"I have a husky. Anyone who knows huskies know they need plenty of physical and mental exercise. I walk her 4 times a day. She needs it. 
Recently, I moved from Illinois to Indiana and it was a huge mistake. I moved because it’s cheaper to buy a house here but I full on regret it because of the epidemic of off-leash dogs and owners who just straight up don’t care. 
They let their dogs out in the front yard (off-leash) to do their business (even though they have a fenced in back yard), I walk by with my dog and the dog sees me, runs across the street and down the block to get to me. My dog doesn’t like off-leash dogs running full speed at her face. Most of them just want to smell her but some pick fights. 
My dog doesn’t know how to meet dogs, she doesn’t know to sniff them, she gets way too worked up and excited, wants to play rough without introducing herself. Most dogs don’t like this and a tussle breaks out. Then I’m stuck trying to keep two dogs apart on my own. 
My town seems to have this epidemic of off-leash dogs. I get 1-2 a week running full speed at me, crossing the street and running down the block to get to me. Most of the time the owners are nowhere in sight because they’re inside.  I’ve had one woman who lives on my street do this multiple times and she never apologizes for her dog terrorizing us. This didn’t happen nearly as often in my old town. It happens to me so often here that I’m getting anxiety issues because of it. Every time I hear keys jingle, I think it’s an off leash dog running towards me. Every time I hear a door open, I think it’s someone letting out their dog off leash. Every time I hear someone yell, it’s usually someone yelling at their off leash dog because it’s running towards me. 
Nothing really bad has happened YET but it feels like a ticking time bomb. It’s only a matter of time before an actual aggressive dog runs up to me. I carry an umbrella every time I walk now so I can pop it open to scare away dogs or keep them at bay. I also carry Spray Shield, a harmless chamomile spray that dogs don’t like, in case I have an aggressive dog run up to me. I avoid certain streets because of repeated off-leash dogs. I avoid walking her at certain times of day when there are more off leash dogs. 

It runs my life. And it ruins living here. I’m currently working on making more money so I can afford to move back to my old town in Illinois. They have higher taxes but it’ll be worth it to be able to walk my dog in peace. Lately I’ve been driving back to my old town (15-20 mins) to walk her so I can enjoy our walks together."
ptwonline,fe9e1cu,t3_eo5ud3,"I don't understand how people can just let their dogs run loose.  Don't they worry about being hit by cars, getting attacked, getting lost, eating/drinking something bad and getting sick?  Or that they might hurt someone, including a child?  And if they don't care about that, maybe they'd care about the lawsuit?"
sentienta,fe9e61v,t1_fe9e1cu,"That’s exactly what I don’t understand! Clearly they don’t care about their dogs. And if they don’t care about their own dogs, how can I expect them to care about mine?"
techleopard,febqgsw,t1_fe9e1cu,"They care, they are just too stupid to realize it can happen to them.  Like, *that's what happens to other people's dogs, since MY dog knows me and knows to stay in the yard and can read my mind!*

I once almost ran off the road trying to avoid dogs.  One came charging out of a ditch on my left, and I served to miss, only to see another dog charge out of the ditch on the right.  This was maybe the third or fourth time I had to go screeching across the road for these particular dogs, and I was just over it.  I regularly had to avoid 6-12 dogs in the road every morning on my way out, and I hated seeing dead dogs.

I took pictures of the dogs standing in front of my car and went to Facebook, and joined a group for my local community/housing area.

Posted it and said that if I find ANY dogs at the road anymore in the morning on my way to work, I was stopping and picking them up and they will be taken to the town shelter.

..... You know what?  Nobody responded to the post, but for the next 3 months, there weren't any dogs at the road at 7 am.  I also never saw those PARTICULAR dogs ever again."
MayuMayhem,febtl5f,t1_fe9e1cu,"Sadly enough, most who do things like that don't really have a reason to fear a lawsuit. 

People like to threaten lawsuits and such, but the reality (and also what we used to joke about at our lawfirm) is that ""you can't squeeze blood from a turnip.""  It is true you can waste your money with attorney and court fees trying to sue someone who is in the wrong, but really doesn't have money to give. Just because someone has a house and vehicle, it doesn't mean they have money. There are plenty of people who live off of debt and they don't make enough money for the judge to even consider them having to pay for damages since the judge knows that they already have issues living off of what they make. Another fun fact is that even if the judge rules in your favor and requires the other person to pay back damages, more than likely it will be enough of a fine that the person will be able to claim bankruptcy and not have to pay but a fraction of what was ruled on."
abrookman1987,feazaiy,t1_fe9e61v,"While I completely agree with you, those on your street could you arrange a planned meet? When your girl has burnt some energy but isn’t too tired and the other dogs owner is there? 

May reduce some of the stress on your doorstep"
sentienta,feb16b5,t1_feazaiy,Thanks for trying to suggest something helpful but I don’t see that going well.
abrookman1987,feb1q9g,t1_feb16b5,"It’s one of those things that becomes I spiral.  I have one dog that’s got small dog syndrome.  You get tense, so they get tense, so you have a rubbish walk, so you both get anxious and round and round you go.

I found my dog walker very helpful here.  I only have her once or twice a week, but she walks a lot of dogs around here.  So when she sees another of clients and knows the dog well she encourages interactions and it’s helped a lot. Well it’s given me hope lol"
Witchywifey,febcsya,t1_feb1q9g,"I think getting a dog walker is a good suggestion.

Driving to a known ""safe"" area is a good idea too. Are there any parks or nature trails that are closer?

And are there any dog traininers or dog training centers in your area? They may be able to help with some of her behaviors, like her reactions to other dogs."
abrookman1987,febd9af,t1_febcsya,One of those you can’t control how others react but you can control how you react and by extension your animal (to a certain extent)
Witchywifey,febdz09,t1_febd9af,"Yeah and if you can control that much, it could reduce the likelihood of a confrontation.

Also, if you keep a small camera on you on the walks, you'd be shown to be the leashed dog, and it would show your efforts to be safe and diffuse the situation. It might help protect you if it comes to it. Like a dashcam for your doggo"
abrookman1987,febeobi,t1_febdz09,"My sisters has his own Fitbit, doggy tech is insane! It came with his insurance to be fair.  Until she gets bored though I get regular updates on his steps lol"
GalacticaActually,fe9c8ua,t3_eo5ud3,"I'm disabled and have two dogs who are now nightmares to walk on leash bc they've been attacked so many times by off-leash dogs. I can't take my dogs anywhere anymore, bc they're so nervous and reactive. It's hard not to hold resentment against the owners of those dogs - especially the ones who had the nerve to yell at me for asking them to obey leash laws. 

I'm really sorry, and you're definitely not alone."
sentienta,fe9dkb3,t1_fe9c8ua,"Wow, I’m so sorry for this! People really ruin things for others."
GalacticaActually,febegne,t1_fe9dkb3,"Thank you. I'm sorry for what you're dealing with as well. I wish people would be mindful of the fact that we all share this world. You're smart to carry Spray Shield. Wishing you and your dog much luck, and safe walks."
skeezix999,fe8vf51,t3_eo5ud3,"I totally agree.  I walk with a large walking stick. When they come at my Harry, I put the stick down hard, look them in the eye and yell no. I too, have high anxiety because of this.  I have noticed that most of the offending owners have large dogs."
sentienta,fe8wqi7,t1_fe8vf51,It feels good to know I’m not alone.
oillieoillie,fe8vyzy,t3_eo5ud3,"Just be that person. Look up the leash laws, call animal control, be obnoxious. I have a shepsky who has come so far with training for leash reactivity. And he still regresses a bit each time we get charged by a dog. I’ve sent two dogs to the pound this year (I have a contact who works there and I always follow up to see if their humans find them) it’s a lot better to make people pay to pick their dog up once, than to deal with a do who gets in a fight  because they can’t handle walking it."
sentienta,fe8x0o1,t1_fe8vyzy,Thanks for the advice. I actually called animal control yesterday.
PM_ME_UR_PUPPY_DOG,fea36hn,t1_fe8x0o1,"I can’t recommend this enough. I am in the same boat as you and my dog is plateauing in her reactivity (despite my best efforts) because of other irresponsible people.

Be a bitch. Make the laws apply to them. They’re not being decent, so protect your dog."
cutelittlebamafan,fe8xtvz,t3_eo5ud3,"This is a huge issue in my area as well. The neighbors dog came  into my yard yesterday and my dog chased out of my yard into street. The were given a warning a month ago from AC, Now, I’m facing a warning for not being able to control my dog. The neighbors lied and said my dog just came into their yard. We have asked them for over a year to please keep their dog from approaching our 90lb dog (their dog 10lb) but they refuse. Why would people put their dog in harms way and think it’s okay to do that. So here we are. I agree with OP. It does make your home and your outings very stressful knowing that you obey the law and you can be charged even if another dog invades you and your dogs private space. We have plenty of property and we still have issues with stray dogs and irresponsible dog owners. Try to enjoy your surroundings and don’t let others ruin your day."
afmurph,fe9vrui,t1_fe8xtvz,I think people often overestimate how much control they have over their dog. They think their dog will come at the sound of their voice when this is often not the case. Sorry you are dealing with this.
cutelittlebamafan,feajpkq,t1_fe9vrui,"I agree. Dogs are still dogs and  it’s so sad that other people will be so irresponsible to put their dog is harms ways. When a dog gets a target in sight, your voice will not control their natural instinct. I got my situation resolved, in my favor due to their past history."
squeakincowbiscuit,fe912ll,t3_eo5ud3,"I have this problem as well, however I have a bit of a special scenario. 

We have a spot of land on a creek that's pretty secluded. I love to take my dogs there as they plenty of room to run and explore, with supervision, without worrying about other dogs being around. They also LOVE to swim, so its perfect on a summer day to relax with a picnic and fetching sticks out of the creek. Sometimes we'll have a get together and friends will bring their dogs to play as well. 

Well, one time a family friend brought a dog without warning. Ok, no big deal I thought to myself, as long as she's friendly. She was not. This little dog was not socialized, and upon their arrival the family opened the truck door and just let the dog out. No warning for my pups or myself. Had I known I would have gotten the leashes or at least put my dogs in a sit/stay to properly meet the new dog. Nope, this dog doesn't even have a collar, much less a leash or manners. A small fight breaks out as I'm trying to wrangle my two pups away from this crazed mutt. Luckily, no damage or broken skin for any dogs. 

Crazed mutt then attacks another dog who was just happily carrying a stick around. At this point I thought surely they would take the dog home or ask to borrow a leash or something. Nope, they said ""oh they're just dogs, they'll work it out and be fine in a little bit."" Needless to say words were exchanged and the crazy pup ended up being taken home."
restlysss,fe91fr9,t3_eo5ud3,"I have this same problem at my apartment complex in FL. I call animal control on everyone and it’s helped a little bit. We have high turn over in the complex though, and I think it’s only new people now that cause a problem. It should be more effective for you since you’re in a neighborhood and people don’t move in and out at such a high rate."
FoxyFoxMulder,fe93rn3,t3_eo5ud3,"My dog is leash reactive, and particularly doesn't like fluffy smallish gray/white dogs. I was walking her in a state park yesterday, and TWO off-leash dogs like this came after us. I ran away off-trail and into the woods. Fortunately, the owner got them leashed... BUT, they decide to come after me to apologize! Like, I appreciate the apology, but clearly I was trying to get my dog away from yours! So I just said, ""it's ok, my dog is weird on leash"" and ran off with my dog snarling and sounding awful.

It's just discouraging as I feel we've finally been making progress with leash reactivity. Ah well."
Cryptomeister99,fe9c3hv,t1_fe93rn3,Is that not to be expected in a state park? I always have my dog leashed but in an off leash area I think people should just not go there if they don't like other dogs to be off leash.
porcupine_raisins,fe9ua06,t1_fe93rn3,"My dog sounds just like yours - leash-reactive and doesn’t like white/gray fluffs. She is also very good at daycare; actually is kind of a wuss and tends to stick around the sidelines of the action, rather than play. At the park, she’ll stick with me and play with other dogs, but she’s picky about who she plays with. She loves to run, but 99% of the time will come back when I call and also check in with me. This was a fluke and I think can be attributed to her being a one-person chicken dog. When I’m at my parent’s place and she gets let outside without confinement, her recall is a different story. What I learned from this is that dogs can surprise us with what they’ll do at the park. 

Callie will literally be a jerk all the way to the off-leash area if I’m not super on top of things (“look” and make her sit for a treat as the person or dog goes by), and sometimes will be when we get there before I take off her leash. I also find she will be okay on the way back to the car, as long as she’s good and tired and feels like she had enough of a play (I guess). I would love for her not to be so reactive, but sometimes people or dogs seemingly come out of nowhere and freak her out. When she’s loose, she’s like a different dog - I think the feeling of security knowing she can escape if need be. 

Is there a reason you walk your dog on a leash in an off-leash area? I assume it doesn’t stick with you? That might be something to work on to get your pup more socialized with you around. I know they can act like totally different dogs at daycare compared to when their parent is around lol. I have found that socializing more at the park off-leash has made the leash reactivity a lot better in predictable situations."
_ataraxia,fe9ghpe,t1_fe9c3hv,state parks are not necessarily off-leash areas though.
MuddieMaeSuggins,fe9uol9,t1_fe9c3hv,"I think most state and national parks are on-leash? They are so often protecting some particular animal or plant species or natural formation or whatever, they don’t want dogs wandering around off the trails trampling stuff and hunting wild animals."
FoxyFoxMulder,fe9e9fz,t1_fe9c3hv,"I don't know... it's something I think about a lot morally. Like, am I in the right to be walking my leash reactive dog in a state park on leash where there will be off-leash dogs? We both love walking in nature. I feel guilty about it. I don't know."
FoxyFoxMulder,fe9vg9v,t1_fe9ua06,"It's not an off-leash park, it's technically an on-leash park. I'm talking about a big, miles-and-miles of trails park, not the dog park. I've had my dog for about 10 months now, so recall training is going slow and steady. She's actually becoming more obedient and attentive to me, so that's good! BUT, I can't really trust her off leash yet, because she'll definitely chase an animal if she sees one. 

Is your dog some sort of collie or herding breed? My dog is a border collie mix. I wonder if that has anything to do with white/gray fluff hatred."
FoxyFoxMulder,fe9peae,t1_fe9ghpe,Most in my state aren't off-leash.
nazgool,fe9kwa2,t1_fe9e9fz,"You are in the right to walk your dog wherever they are allowed. If your dog is particularly aggressive, reactive, etc., then I think you are obligated to muzzle your dog, or take whatever precautions you can to minimize problems.  

*However*, they are in the wrong if their dogs are off-leash in areas where it is not allowed. Where I am, there are few state parks that even allow dogs on trails, let alone off-leash. 

But, I also carry a knife, pepper spray, and a stun gun almost exclusively for off-leash dogs now (used to be for coyotes)."
CountingSatellites,fe9mkvc,t1_fe9e9fz,"As someone that also has a reactive dog, I’ll say that while you’re not technically in the wrong walking your dog there since the people with off-leash dogs are the ones breaking the rules (provided that is the rule), you are breaking one of the most important guidelines of dealing with reactivity, which is to avoid setting your dog up to fail. 

If you know there are often going to be off-leash dogs that will run up to your dog, it’s not a good decision to go there. It sucks that the people that are breaking the rules get to continue doing so at your expense, but it’s more important to do what’s right for your dog than to be the one that’s right.

You may want to see if your state has a map/listing of public access or DNR land that you could use to get out in nature with little chance of running into others. Just be mindful about use during hunting season."
porcupine_raisins,fe9wuan,t1_fe9vg9v,"I saw that it’s not off-leash after commenting - sorry! 

I honestly got lucky with my dog being good off-leash. I got her when she was 9 months and avoided going to the dog park for about three months out of fear she wouldn’t listen to me. I had another terrier with horrible recall growing up. She’s a Jack Russell, so has that hunting instinct, so maybe the colour of dog reminds her of a rabbit? I only notice she’s really bad about those specific dogs when she’s inside looking out the window, in the car, or on leash (confined). Otherwise, they’re just another dog to her. A real mystery. Actually, about a month ago, Callie got away from me on a walk in the morning when she surprised me by taking off after a rabbit. She chased it across the street and a bit further, but when I called her, told her I had a treat, and motioned like I was gonna leave her, she came running. Truly not what I was expecting. 

Your pup is still young, but they’re so nice to train and smart! She’ll be a great off-leash dog some day!"
pb_and_banana,febds11,t1_fe9peae,"same. people treat parks as an excuse to let their dogs off-leash! i live right by a park with a big lake, and there is a huge open area (meant for picnics and kids...) where people let their dogs run around. there is a huge sign at the entrance to the park saying all dogs must be on leash... but soooooo many people don’t follow it that it has become accepted. my dog is only 6 1/2 lbs so I wouldn’t let him off even if it were permitted, but i hate the fact that those dogs could potentially run up to mine. i’ve even had a large dog come bounding towards us freely on the trail around the lake (where it is a fairly narrow trail and would be really hard to escape)— the owner was running to catch up. totally irresponsible."
FoxyFoxMulder,fe9muut,t1_fe9kwa2,"My dog's not particularly aggressive, she's never bitten a dog and I don't think she wants to, she just greets extremely rudely. She does well at doggy daycare, actually. I'm working hard on it. I do definitely take a lot of precautions!"
FoxyFoxMulder,fe9lnzn,t1_fe9kb64,"I mean technically the whole park has leash laws, but I understand the desire to walk dogs unleashed. My previous dog was a dream off leash."
FoxyFoxMulder,fea04z4,t1_fe9wuan,"She's almost 2! I hope that is still considered young. :D I will say she's definitely made progress though. 

And phew! Good thing she came back to you after the rabbit chase. Smart thinking to act like you were leaving instead of panicking!"
Cryptomeister99,febsvlm,t1_febds11,Didn't know that they are not off leash. That's why I put a questionmark behind it. Obviously people should keep their dogs on leash in areas where the rules say you should. In my country natural parks are mostly off leash and it annoys me when I go to a specific place because it is an off leash area and someone with a reactive dogs tells me I can't have my dog off leash.
nazgool,fe9nm3j,t1_fe9muut,"It was more of a generalization of ""issues"".  Ultimately my point was, you are not in the wrong for taking your dog out to enjoy life in a responsible way."
porcupine_raisins,fea0t38,t1_fea04z4,"Oh, that must’ve been someone else’s dog who’s 10 months haha. Mine turned 2 at the end of Sept, but we continue to make progress! We also joined beginner (now we’re in intermediate) flyball, which helps her be exposed to new things too!

Yeah, I was amazed with how she came back. I thought I’d for sure be late for work chasing after a rabbit and a dog lol"
FoxyFoxMulder,fe9od4t,t1_fe9nm3j,"Thank you. It's tough being a reactive dog owner! Some people tell me the more practice/exposure she gets on trails the better, and some people tell me I'm a jerk for bringing my dog out. Sigh."

loveinlilacs,fe9l6c7,t3_eo5ud3,"I don't have any good advise for you here, just wanted to say I agree and I HATE this. This happens at a few places we go for hikes/walks (that specifically say dogs must be leashed), quite frequently. And the owner's excuses are always: ""don't worry, he/she's friendly."" COOL - mine isn't. He has leash reactivity and WILL react badly to your dog coming bounding up to us unleashed and wild. It's SO inconsiderate. 

We even have our dog wearing a yellow bandanna on most walks because it's supposed to be a ""stay away"" color but we have found most people don't know or don't care to pay attention."
porcupine_raisins,fe9un1g,t1_fe9l6c7,"Gawd, I hate that. Then you’re blamed if something goes awry, even though they broke the rules. So annoying."
afmurph,fe9v673,t3_eo5ud3,"I live by a big park that has a walking trail around it. There is one corner of the park that is curved slightly so you can’t see who is entering the park until you are about 15 feet away from them. I walk my dog around that park on a leash and there have been a few incidents where someone is entering the park with their dog off leash and since I can’t see them until I’m close I don’t know they are there. The off leash dogs always come at my dog who isn’t very friendly with other dogs and she starts to growl and bark. I’ve been yelled at before by people for my dog acting aggressive but at least my dog is being controlled on her leash, they are the ones who allowed their dog to run up to mine without a leash."

thisisthepoint_er,fe9vk6c,t1_fe8vekl,Suburbs can be almost worse because it's where entitlement meets obliviousness. Rural is just a lot of people not giving a rat's ass.
imfartandsmunny,fe9m7dd,t3_eo5ud3,"Are there leash laws in the county you live in? 

Either way, when you interact with owners, firmly tell them if their dog approaches yours again, you’ll call animal control. Also, if there are leash laws, tell them you’ll get police involved (the owner could be fined)."
mamadgaf,fea3ttg,t1_fe9m7dd,"There are leash laws in most communities. It’s up to the owner to be able to control their animal at all times. Look into the laws were you live, OP, and the next time it happens (especially with that dog that keeps doing it), call the police. Take photos of the dog and the license (if the dog has one on its collar and you can safely grab the dog long enough to take pics of it). The laws exist for a reason."
_ataraxia,fe9mzkd,t1_fe9m7dd,animal control would be in charge of enforcing leash laws and doling out those fines.
MaplePaws,fea6e27,t3_eo5ud3,"Where I used to live there was this woman that frequently walked her dog off leash, and I use the phrase loosely. She and her dog were outside at the same time, that is about the extent of the ""supervision"", this dog is also aggressive though also old and stiff so it is more than possible to get away and hide if you see the dog soon enough. Routinely this dog would be in the park harassing other dog owners or children, while the woman would be five minutes down the road from even entering the park. This dog would be alone along the back road as well which is high traffic for the area, and often we have young drivers that drive recklessly down that road. I have been caught off guard by this dog on several occasions, luckily I was able to protect my dog from it but I have ripped clothes and have been gotten on multiple times by this dog. Each time reported to the authorities but still she does this, so now every time I return to visit friends and family I am afraid that this will happen again. 

One time she and her dog entered the park at the same time, the dog was of course off leash. I was already there and had sat down because I was having a really bad medical episode. So when the dog off course approached mine I called for her to control her dog. When she did not I tried to leave but because of the episode I did not get far and fainted. When I woke up she was close by with her dog finally on a leash. My dog was laying on me like she was trained to but barked once as the woman stepped closer with the dog, which at the time of this incident had already attacked us on a couple occasions. She then told me to control my dog who did not even get up, and was silent outside of that one bark. The woman proceeded to take a picture of me still on the ground promising to report me to the authorities. In the end nothing came of it, but still this woman has a problem.

It really is not fair that one person can cause such damage, both physically and psychologically. I am honestly glad that even service dogs are not exempt from leash laws, because that is a popular excuse used by this woman and other reactive/aggressive off leash dogs. Honestly I have take to labeling my dog by leash wrap at least as a service dog every time I go out because this is ridiculous."
timberwolfeh,fe9d7ff,t3_eo5ud3,"I used to live in a little town just south of indianapolis that sounded a lot like this 😂. If you're in that area I have some great trails to share that helped me immensely (ie driving 5 mins to the little nature park nearby rather than walking the neighborhood meant way less off leash accidents) or just for fun. If you're not in that area, while of course the onus is on the off leash dog owners and you shouldn't have to do anything different, sometimes the anxiety release is worth changing it up a little. I used alltrails to find stuff near me that got me out of residential areas and away from no-fenced-yard-mcgee and dont-worry-hes-friendly-fear-aggressive-fido.

Edit: didnt process you're 15-20 mins from illinois, so not the same area."
xxop323,fe9kjbp,t3_eo5ud3,"I live in a subdivision off of a busy 4 lane road and also have the same issue, definitely not just a problem in rural areas. Between the off leash dogs and a few houses that have multiple (3-5) dogs that charge their fences and go ape shit barking their heads off (why do owners never call their dogs inside when they hear them doing this? One of my really nice neighbors with dogs like this likes to let them outside when I’m walking by because the dogs start barking in the house, it’s lovely) it has actually made one of my dogs slightly reactive. I can’t even walk my dogs in my neighborhood anymore for fear of ruining their training or getting in a fight.

I feel bad about calling AC as we have a bad stray problem in my city and they’re constantly overflowing, but people will learn their lesson when they have to pay fines to get their dog back. Or in the best case scenario they won’t come get their dog and someone who actually cares to safely contain it will adopt it. 

I’ve also had my favorite hiking spots (that are in freaking county parks that have leash rules on top of our county wide leash laws) ruined because of off leash dogs trying to attack us/bombarding us. I was coming around a bend with my two on leashed dogs the other day when an off leash Shepherd with no owners in sight comes barreling at us. I’m yelling for help while swinging my legs at the barking dog to keep it back and see the owners in the distance casually strolling up to me yelling “he’s friendly!!!” Ok but my dogs don’t really care to interact with any dogs, let alone dogs they don’t know (nor do I want them near your dog that I know nothing about health or temperament wise).

This has caused an annoying amount of anxiety and stress in my life and has seriously made me adamant that I’ll never live in another subdivision in my life and prefer my closest neighbor to be 10 miles away. It sucks so bad and I’m sorry you have to deal with it. Always call AC (I assume your town has leash laws) and let them handle it, this way they’ll at least be able to see this is a repetitive ongoing issue. They have no idea what’s going on unless people are reporting things and unfortunately many are afraid/just don’t want to take the time to make that call. 

Sorry this was so long lol, nobody in my life to seems to understand why I get so worked up about this topic."
dragodog97,feainzp,t1_fe9kjbp,"> One of my really nice neighbors with dogs like this likes to let them outside when I’m walking by because the dogs start barking in the house

Been there - met another dog who was going apeshit, barking, lunging - I thought “thank god he’s leashed” right before the lady let him free..."
IEatAndTravel,feafkb0,t3_eo5ud3,"I live in California, but I visit the South a lot because I have family there. I'm always shocked at how many off-leash dogs there are, and some of them are AGGRESSIVE. I like going on walks for exercise but I stopped doing it in the South (multiple states...tried it in Georgia, Tennessee, and North Carolina) because every time I tried to go on a nice stroll around the neighborhood, I would get nearly mauled by somebody's angry dog just running around baring its' teeth. Sure, there are D-bags with aggressive off-leash dogs in California too, but over there it seemed like an epidemic. Marked it off the list of places I'll ever live because I have a small dog and I feel like my options there would be to either make the poor guy stay inside his entire life or risk his life every time I step out the door. Drives me crazy. My sympathies, OP."

ACrispWinterDay,fe8v9sc,t3_eo5ud3,"Unfortunately, that's kind of how rural places are. There's a street near me that leads to a public state forest trail head, and the houses on that street the dogs have like created a pack and they'll surround your car and bark at it if you drive down the road.

Usually it's better if you go to public land (if you have access), are there any decent trails nearby?"

Recently a ""mexican street dog"" injured another dog and it was negligible enough it wasn't reported. She's constantly on guard due to her dog's on-leash aggression. As a dog who has some aggression on leash, I am 100% with you on this. Luckily in my area, owners might let dog off in teh park, so they can be avoided. But I feel you!"

But yes I get it."
sentienta,fea34m4,t3_eo5ud3,This is exactly how my day goes every day. I feel your pain! And I already feel better knowing I’m not the only anxious dog walker out there. It’s not that hard to follow rules. Or apparently it is. Sigh.

Multiple times per day. It's ridiculous."
Keridactyl,feabf4l,t3_eo5ud3,"I had a very sweet and otherwise well-behaved but dog-aggressive pittie, Mary, who passed a few years ago. We live on a large property where other dogs aren't a problem, but I visited my mom a few times a year and had to walk Mary along a residential street a few times a day when we visited her. My mom had a neighbor with four small dogs who would stand and bark and jump up against their screen door and managed to get it open a few times as we were walking past their house. The little dogs would zoooom across the street and swarm Mary, who would immediately tense. I've had dogs fight before and it was extremely traumatic. I was afraid Mary would attack their dogs. Her hackles would raise but thankfully she stood stock still and didn't move until the dogs were gone.

Each time I would yell to the neighbors and ask them to get their dogs. Often the neighbors would be sitting outside but wouldn't even care that their dogs were out, and would take their sweet time getting them, or would straight up just ignore me and their dogs. The last time I yelled louder than necessary, but still politely, and they huffed and puffed and acted like I was the jerk in the situation. I don't know if they understood that I was concerned about *their* dogs getting hurt, but despite their apparent apathy, I have a feeling they would have raised hell for Mary, me, and my mom if something bad had actually happened. 

After that I started driving to parks to walk Mary."

surgery successful following a panicked run and drive to the emergency vet, which cost thousands of dollars.

rottweiler's teeth came less than half an inch from hitting arteries and eye socket.

i had to tear the rottweiler's mouth off of my dog's head with my bare hands, which have cuts all over them as well.

gigga2710,feaklqh,t3_eo5ud3,"Totally feel your pain. 

My dog, although calm and polite with other dogs when properly introduced, will get very upset when off-leash dogs charge us and get in his face. I can’t even blame him. Most of the dogs that charge us are really poorly socialized.

Don’t be afraid to keep gearing up! I see you carry some deterrents already - just be sure to have it in reach! I learned the hard way that having it on my person is not the same thing as being able to use it... I have a Doggie Don’t Device, pepper spray, and citronella spray in my fanny pack. In risky areas I keep one in my hand while we walk.

One tip I heard recently is to scream that your dog has kennel cough/some other infectious disease. Haven’t tried it yet though."
Larsthecat,feapmhd,t3_eo5ud3,"I also live in Indiana and it is truly mind blowing how many off leash dogs there are. My dog has unfortunately become reactive from being attacked/run up on so frequently! Our walks require constant hyper vigilance to attempt to spot and avoid possible off leash dogs. I also get met by 1-2 a week, although it seems to get slightly better in the winter and way worse in the summer. 

I wish I had advice or anything that has worked for me, but nothing works. These people are irresponsible and should not own dogs. I hope you can move back soon."
I_pinchyou,feavpub,t3_eo5ud3,"We live in a city with leash laws, and this happens here too (Ohio). People are just irresponsible pet owners. They think their dog shouldn't be bound by a leash and it's infuriating, also the not picking up poo. 
But yeah you got your answers. Keep calling about them, if there are laws they will get fined and hopefully stop. 
The older generation around me however just keeps doing it."

chasingneverland76,febdi0g,t3_eo5ud3,"I can’t stand dog owners who do this. My neighbour and I don’t have a fence to separate our yards and let’s his dog literally wonder around everyone’s back yards 24/7. I believe he has a doggy door as this dog will literally come take a shit in my yard at 3 in the morning. My dog is scared to poo in his own yard and it freaks him out. The owner never picks any of the poop up and my dog has eaten it more times then I’d like to admit... I honestly don’t get it. A dog is a animal so you have to watch them, but also a dog is family! So why would you risk your dog getting hit by a car, stolen etc? I’m glad I’m not the only one who is annoyed / has anxiety over this. It freaks me out to take my dog out when it’s still dark in my yard because I don’t know if the dog is friendly or if he’ll attack my dog, my dog is not even 10 pounds... and his dog is pretty big.. I’m sorry your having to deal with this so much. I can’t imagine how frustrating it is for this to happen frequently on walks with a lot of dogs. Especially with a husky.. I can easily pick my pup up when another dog is lunging at him etc."
Moosey_Bee,febp77h,t3_eo5ud3,This is my nightmare. I have two Huskies and I hate it when other dogs get out while I’m walking them. My 5 year old doesn’t do well with meeting new dogs and a strange dog running full speed at him is really dangerous for the other dog. My 2 year old is better but like your dog he gets really excited and wants to play rough immediately. I’m really thankful that I live in Illinois because of the leash laws.
PrairieBunny91,febxrdq,t3_eo5ud3,"God I feel this. I'm positive my young dog is going to end up reactive despite a lot of training and counter-conditioning because we have so many irresponsible owners where I live. Our city has a beautiful trail system that I don't use because every single time I do, my guy gets jumped by off leash dogs. I've had to alter my walking route through our neighborhood. It's annoying. 

And the thing is I don't mind the idea of off leash dogs - but you and your dog need to fit a certain criteria. Your dog needs to be trained off leash very, very well. You need to be able to call your dog back no matter what, and your dog should be able to walk by and ignore other dogs. I'm so sick of having a snarling dog run full force towards my dog while an owner yells that he's friendly from 50 feet back. Like my dude... And calling AC doesn't do a lot. Nothing wrong with them but they are just stretched too thin."

PrairieBunny91,febzwub,t1_febzlte,We could all get together and walk our dogs on a freaking leash! LoL. I think what irritates me the most is we have at least 4 off leash dog parks in different parts of the city with easy access. I know people have issues with dog parks too but it's like just go during off times dude. We have one that's so big that you could probably not see another dog if you really didn't want to.
salukis,fe9aq0y,t3_eo5ud3,"That sucks. I don't walk my dogs much because of off leash dogs. I live in a kind of rural suburb with no leash laws. If you have leash laws, I'd call animal control all the time. If you don't, I'd probably try to find backyard games to replace some (not all) of the walks or invest in a dog treadmill to replace some (not all) walks."
sentienta,fe9dd7o,t1_fe9aq0y,Thanks for the info. There are actually leash laws where I live. I called Animal Control for the first time yesterday.
nazgool,fe9k3mw,t1_fe9dd7o,Take pictures or videos of the dogs. If you know where they live you can send AC the videos/images and give them the address of the owners.

VorFemme,fe9xnuv,t3_eo5ud3,"I agree that people who routinely let their dogs run around like that are completely irresponsible and really should not have a dog. I realize this is a little bizarre, but I since our dog recently got skunked I thought this might work. Carry a big bottle of Axe Body Spray and zap the dogs in the face when they get near your dog. The smell is so vile and penetrating that I bet the other owners will try to keep their dogs away from you. Just a thought."
dnalloheoj,fea130j,t3_eo5ud3,"You won't be able to control every person's actions along your walks. Maybe try bringing your dog to the Dog Park or similar to get them acclimated to something like that?

I lived in the city with my dog for the first 2 years of her life and her 'outside area' at my house was about 10'x10', so the dog park was an absolute necessity in terms of socializing and getting her energy out. I believe it helped a lot in terms of getting her used to dogs 'charging' or similar."
thirdhex,fea6s8l,t3_eo5ud3,"I live in Indiana and, while I have a fenced in yard, and if I bring the dogs out the front they’re on leashes, my neighbor across the street just lets his yorkie run wherever and when he does walk his dog on the leash, he brings his dog over to let him poo in our or the next door neighbors yard and the dog will just run along our fence line, which irritates my dogs. I have 2 dogs, an English Bulldog and a Pocket Bully Pit. And while theoretically my pit could get over the fence, he is usually very good with people and other dogs and he really doesn’t like leaving the yard anyway. But god forbid anything happens to that yorkie, with the attitude about pits being negative around here and I worry that my dog will be blamed if that dog gets hurt. Everyone on my street except that one guy keep their dogs in fenced yards and/or walk them on leashes. But I can’t say that for the dogs on nearby cross streets."
Itsoktobe,feabm6f,t3_eo5ud3,"I live in a shitty neighborhood in my city. Trash and off-leash dogs abound. I almost always drive somewhere to walk my husky. It's a pain in the ass, but it's worth it. I've also been taking her to a dog park on a frequent basis (like almost daily) since she was old enough. It's helped a lot with her socialization and learning how to approach / act around other dogs. It sounds like your dog could benefit from a bit more doggy socialization. A huge added benefit is that it tires them out even more. ;)"

Document every single time the dogs come near you, leave their property, or cause a public disturbance. Take out your phone, take pictures and take them to animal control. Report report report. I had neighbors with two large pit bull type dogs that busted out of a window to come run me and my dog's down, and I went to animal control the very next day and signed an affidavit and they were fined. Neighbors don't want to talk about it? Tell them that you're just going to shoot them if they come near you again. I told my neighbors that if her dogs came into my yard again, that they would be shot. 🤷‍♀️ Haven't had a problem since. sometimes you have to be aggressive when it comes to these things because these people don't care."

These four are (were) regular escapees and general terrors to the little old ladies and gardens in my 55+ neighborhood.

She is mostly disinterested in other dogs, and almost never approaches them unless she is on her leash and we happen to be walking right by them. I would NEVER allow her to be off-leash without me being outside also, and especially not in the front yard. I hardly allow her to be unsupervised in the backyard, for that matter."

spinnymcspinspin,elhrkn,top_level,"We adopted a 3-5 year old hound mix a few weeks ago, and he’s been a dream. His only hitch is that he fixated on stuff while we’re out on walks.

So, I’m going to admit something - the way I grew up with dogs was heavily based in “the dog is on a quest of world domination”.  Like, my parents taught me the “if dog makes a mess in the house you rub its nose and yell and be mad” mentality. So, now I’ve been leash training him has been a bit rough. Just, more pulling him back to my side and shortening his lead substantially when he pulls forward and bays when he sees animals/people cars. I’d use harshly toned “NO’s” when he was doing something I didn’t like. Just, way harsher than needed. You know the type.

I’ve been training myself with at home stuff, using positive reinforcement with dog and it’s going super well. But, the walk stuff I would just revert to the harsher ways I learnt as a kid when dog would fixate and lunge and bay and bark and whine. Dog would start freaking out even more because I was reacting and not telling him what I like him doing, only what he *shouldn’t* be doing. It finally clicked for me today how frustrating it would be if I was at work and people just kept telling me what not to do instead of what I am supposed to do.

I tried something new today because his walks were getting stressful for all of the stakeholders. It was kind of a Hail Mary for me. I thought I was dog-savvy, but what I was doing wasn’t working for my sensitive little guy. I told him he was a good boy whenever he was doing something good, like having a good walk or checking on me, or being relaxed instead of saying “no” or “bad dog” when he’d fixate. Just ANYTHING that was him being a good boy, I’d tell him and give him pats. When the first distraction showed up and he started fixating, it escalated  to barking and baying, I took a breath and we just stopped walking. I waited for him to be calm. Once he stopped barking and lunging, I told him he was a good boy and gave him pats. Then, we kept walking. Each time there was anew distraction, he was paying more attention to me. It finally clicked that before today he wasn’t trying to lunge AT the thing, he was reacting to my reacting. I was the problem.

By the end of the walk, he was doing at least double the amount of “check ins” and he even saw a postman without as little as a whine. He was happier, I was happier, we were both so much more relaxed. I don’t think I said “no” during the entire walk.

When we got back I was almost in tears, like my dog taught me how to just *be*. It amazed me how I though for ages that he had the fixation problem, when it turns out that I was the one with the problem.

Anyway, I had a wonderful day with my dog, I am learning, and he is teaching me new stuff every day. Thank you for reading."

alexandrovna,fdjrb4j,t3_elhrkn,"My hound learns so much quicker when I use positive reinforcement even compared with negative punishment (when you take a good thing away until they comply, like stopping the walk until they stop pulling on the leash). I literally used a pocket full of his kibble and fed him one piece at a time when he walked beside me, and he caught on so quick. It seems like with less biddable dogs (maybe all dogs, but definitely more independent ones like hounds), getting enthusiastic cooperation is so much more valuable than just compliance."
Savage_pleasantry,fdlrwky,t1_fdjrb4j,"That's a great description of what a hound is like. They don't want to obey just to be obedient, but make it fun, make it exiting, make it a game, and turn it into a HUNT and they will learn new stuff in a matter of seconds and do what you ask with a goofy grin, flopping ears and a tail that is wagging like crazy."
spinnymcspinspin,fdjxfc5,t1_fdjrb4j,"I totally agree. They just want to know what their job is. If I use treats, my guy tends to get a bit too excited and food fixates, but he responds really well to praise and pats."
