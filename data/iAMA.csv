colinobrady,emfhql,top_level,"Hello Reddit! I'm Colin O'Bady, an explorer and author. In 2018, I became the first person ever to walk across Antarctica while pulling a 400-pound sled, solo, unsupported and unassisted. I also just completed the first human-powered row of Drake Passage, the most treacherous body of water in the world. 

My book The Impossible First, which recounts my crossing of Antarctica and my life, comes out in five days! You can preorder it here: www.theimpossiblefirst.com

colinobrady,fdohwky,t1_fdoeqrs,"I was in contact with a pilot and team that runs logistics on the frozen continent, so, best case scenario they could find me in hopefully about 5 hours.

However because of the rough terrain I was in, the plane is rigged with skis, and there were a lot of sections where they would never be able to land because of crevasses and huge sastrugi (ice mounds). In those conditions, as well as on the worst storm days, there would have been no hope of rescue. I was all alone."

EDIT: Wow, I had no idea those few years of lurking on the sidelines would cause so much angst to come out into a subject I’m passionate about (productive as it was to you other lurkers out there). Despite mine and other people’s grumblings about this trip, I’d rather not be remembered on here as the person who’s really good at tearing people down. However, after I decided to take it down last night I've been called a coward and everything else in between.  So just for you silly goofs I've put it back up under this edit, which is my 4th and final one. Apparently I'm not fit enough for the newly found reddit popularity.

While there has been [controversy ](https://explorersweb.com/2018/12/27/obradys-antarctic-crossing-was-it-really-unassisted)  about this expedition, it was an incredible feat nonetheless. And I think we’ve all learned a few lessons here..  He did in fact correct me on a few details of his trip (his end point not being the Axel Hieberg Glaicer, when in fact it was the the Leverette Glacier.  Both of which are in very close proximity to each other and are popular routes among antarctic ski expeditions. However my comment about it having [a known snow road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole_Traverse) still remains factual. So please take this into account if you decide to read my initial comment). My frustrated comment came from what I believe to be hyperbolic marketing tactics to try and sell books, and maybe gain fame without giving respect or provide a 'full picture' about giving credit to where credit is due.  To give you some context about myself, I have spent over a year of my life on the continent over five separate trips, so I do know a little bit about what goes on down there.

However, it sounds like if you read his book he hopefully does give credit where I believe he should have, maybe?  It seems like some other folks out there would agree with my frustrated initial response  by the intimidating and overwhelming comments..  Aside from this book,  if you want to do more research about this check out his interview on the [JRE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Wc54EDkRug), [Lou Rudd's direct thoughts](https://lourudd.com/2019/01/14/post-expedition-reflection/), and maybe catch up on the entire history of antarctic expeditions as a whole while you're at it.  From Shackelton's failed attempt that turned out to be one of the greatest survival stories known to mankind, to Robert Falcon's Scott's tragic journey, and of course  Amundsen's triumph.    Now everyone go outside and do something productive.  Try not to get in too deep online ;)"

Not true. First of all, maybe aside from your pickup with Lou you were never in direct touch with the pilot. You were in touch with the comms department of ALE, which is the logistics company you keep avoiding to name even though they’re the reason why you were able to make that trip a reality (they flew Mr. O’Brady onto the continent, flew him to the grounding line to start the trip, and picked him up from the Axel Heiberg glacier when he finished his trip).

Second, ALE could’ve landed in a safe zone with less sastrugi and crevassing in your general proximity with a ski-doo on board, and travel safety would’ve had your ass in a few hours. It’s literally done every Antarctic season to other ski expeditioners on the exact same route, whether they’re headed to pole via Hercules Inlet or the Axel Hieberg. Also, the Axel Heiberg has a very well-used snow road on it used by the American base to transport fuel every summer from the coast to pole. Minor detail.

Please stop using people’s ignorance of Antartica and the logistics surrounding it against them.  While your trip was a great endeavor, the hyperbole you use to market yourself is sad and ridiculous.

Here are some tips to make you seem ‘more inspirational’ to those who really know what you did:

-Instead of just highlighting Henry Worsleys death during his attempt, maybe acknowledge that he was on a different(and much more difficult route) than you.  You might actually find people would respect your humility on this subject.

-Give more respect to Lou, who you barely beat. Instead, on Rogan you just laughed and said that you totally beat this random special forces dude. And if I can remind you, he was doing that trip in honor of Henry Worsley. Come on, vague Instagram posts don’t count for shit.

-Give respect to those where credit is due and you wouldn’t be getting so much criticism from the polar community at large. Stop taking yourself so seriously. You seem to do a great job doing this by acknowledging  strength your mother gave you, so why is it so difficult to acknowledge the other important folks/details surrounding this trip?  Mike and Borge just almost died at the North Pole on what was an incredibly harder and more complicated trip, and they could care less about getting on Joe Rogan , writing a book, or doing an AMA.

""Hey, I just wanted to reply to your comments - happy to address the factual aspects of this comment.

First off, I highly encourage you to pick up a copy of my book - I just did a keyword search of the body of the test and ALE is called out by name over 50 times. I'm certainly not avoiding mentioning them, they did an incredible job. But contrary to what you're saying, I was explicitly told by them that in specific zones, especially what we call ""Satstrugi National Park""m there would be no rescue within an 100 miles radius.

Also, not sure what your experience in Antarctica has been, but I've never seen or could imagine how a skidoo could be loaded onto a twin otter plane. In all my experience in Antarctica, I've never seen it done.

If you're going to write hateful comments here about getting your facts straight, maybe you should get yours straight first.

I did not finish at the base of the Axel Heiberg Glacier, I finished at the base of the Leverett Glacier.

And finally, again, I encourage you to check out my book if you feel so inclined. Lou is a primary character of course and I'm very complimentary and direct about his incredible accomplishment as well. In fact, I was just texting him a couple days ago. We remain very close friends. So please do not try and put hateful comments here when there's nothing but positivity and a shared camaraderie between Lou and I.

 * Instead of just highlighting Henry Worsleys death during his attempt, maybe acknowledge that he was on a different(and much more difficult route) than you. You might actually find people would respect your humility on this subject.    

 * Give more respect to Lou, who you barely beat. Instead, on Rogan you just laughed and said that you totally beat this random special forces dude. And if I can remind you, he was doing that trip in honor of Henry Worsley. Come on, vague Instagram posts don’t count for shit.    

 * Give respect to those where credit is due and you wouldn’t be getting so much criticism from the polar community at large.


Stop taking yourself so seriously. You seem to do a great job doing this by acknowledging strength your mother gave you, so why is it so difficult to acknowledge the other important folks/details surrounding this trip? 


Mike and Borge almost died at the North Pole on what was an incredibly harder and more complicated trip, and they could care less about getting on Joe Rogan or doing an AMA. *Guinness world records *explorers grand slam *coolman"

rudolfs001,fdphrke,t1_fdpegau,"Not talking about salaries hurts workers. Openly discussing salaries allows people to know what they're worth and when they're underpaid.

The increase in transparency of CEO salaries ([early 90s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_compensation_in_the_United_States#Transparency)) is theorized to have been one of the contributing factors to the [dramatic rise of CEO salaries at that time](https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ceo-pay.png?w=1024). Once you know the other firms are all paying their CEOs 2MM, then you're not going to be happy accepting an offer for 1MM and will demand it be increased. From there, they kept rising and rising as CEOs negotiated ever higher salaries using the public information of other CEO salaries as justification.

Discuss your salaries. It will help the working class as a whole to have that info out there.

The entire reason work culture puts pressure on you to not do it, is because they don't want you realizing how underpaid you are."

Impressive feats!"

If so, I would recommend everyone read [this article by David Grann](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/the-white-darkness) which is the story of Worsley's attempt at crossing Antarctica solo. 

It also has a good summary of [Shackleton's Endurance expedition.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Trans-Antarctic_Expedition)

TestFixation,fdpihgn,t1_fdp1y7a,"Sure he was all those things. And I don't know if he really wrote this, or it was just a movie thing, but at the end of Into the Wild, McCandless writes ""happiness only real when shared"". In the movie at least, the dude travels solo to the Alaskan wilderness and dies alone, having just discovered that connection with other people and love for others and ones community is actually what he was looking for the whole. I mean holy shit if that isn't the saddest thing I've ever seen."

StonyMcGuyver,fdp9v73,t1_fdp5wlm,"I read it maybe 10 years ago but i remember the book totally checking my romanticism of him from the movie. I don’t have anywhere near the level of animosity some people seem to have about him though, and still think of him fondly. Honestly i think most cases of people getting seriously indignant about him are a way of tacit self aggrandizement, passively asserting that they what they’re doing. You don’t have to champion every move the guy made to respect his character, and you don’t have to trash him to point out some serious mistakes he made, and caution against them."
cheerstothe90s,fdpab1w,t1_fdp5wlm,"What's wrong with that? They don't have to go out into the wild and survive on a bag of rice, but maybe they need motivation to make a leap or break out in their own direction. that's where the teacher steps in and gives some perspective and gets them talking about ideas, good or bad."
djreeled23,fdoil86,t3_emfhql,Was there any point where you legitimately thought your life was in danger?
colinobrady,fdoiwxa,t1_fdoil86,"Yes. If you read the prologue of the book (spoiler alert!) I almost lost my entire tent in a storm, my only shelter. I was hanging onto it with only my fingertips and I saw my life flash before my eyes."
M002,fdpap6e,t1_fdoiwxa,that's absolutely terrifying
Timedoutsob,fdqncr2,t1_fdoiwxa,Something to improve on for next time. Nasa makes sure everything is attached to something at all times on spacewalks. Maybe a cord on the tent attached to you or sled at all times is an option.

After that, climbing Everest with my wife this Spring on the Tibet side and we're already scheming on our next major expedition."

pc124448,fdp7t7v,t1_fdohjos,"Colin! Although I doubt you’ll have much time to spare when arriving at Tibet, but if you do, I highly recommend visiting Jokang Temple, Sera Monastery, Barkhor Street, and local artisan shops. 

Tibet is beautiful and very... spiritual. You’ll be able to feel the weight of it in the air."
Jpw0001,fdp8seh,t1_fdp2ntp,"It takes way more than motivation to do stuff like this. Think about - this guy is independently wealthy to the point that he doesn’t have to worry about grinding out a 9-5 and can spend all of his time dedicated to training for the event and can independently fund the expedition himself. I’m guessing he doesn’t have to worry about money - it’s just always been and always will be there. If you were able to choose literally anything in the world to purse and not have to worry about regular shit like money and bills - I doubt you’d find yourself lazy 

Or maybe you would any way - it wouldn’t matter - you’d be rich!"
bunnybash,fdprap8,t1_fdp2ntp,"Or maybe you just don't have a pile of cash to fall back on. Watching people who don't have to work go around breaking world records etc is impressive, but it's a whole other thing if this guy had 4 kids and a mortgage and parents to support."
P00FL1NGER,fdobooy,t3_emfhql,"Did you pull any inspiration or maybe even more so, techniques, from Wim Hof?"
colinobrady,fdoep2u,t1_fdobooy,"Yeah, Wim Hofs an inspiration, I was so grateful he blurbed my book: ""An irresistible read, The Impossible First asks one question: 'With the right mindset what is each of us capable of?'""

Breathing, dealing with the cold, keeping track of my mind...all so crucial to my crossing."
Keith_Creeper,fdoj9ho,t3_emfhql,What was the song that got stuck in your head?

colinobrady,fdof8ln,t1_fdocozx,"I've climbed one other, Manaslu, before I climbed Everest - 8000 meter peak climbing is something I think I will do more of. I'm actually climbing the north side of Everest with my wife this year. It will be my first time on that side of the mountain."
3MATX,fdorxs2,t1_fdof8ln,Do you have any concerns with traffic jams like we saw on Everest this year?
pc124448,fdp7xt6,t1_fdorxs2,"Although it’s not much better, the side that Colin is climbing is thankfully not the side that has had the traffic jam problems. The Tibet side is a bit more difficult in terms of getting visa approval, etc. and has less people on that side, so hopefully it will be okay."

Jenna, my wife, has been the backbone of all my expeditions. WE've created and planned them together. My book, The Impossible First, although it's my name on the cover, is really both our stories. Her strength and cunning has made all the difference."

azdak,fdodnbf,t3_emfhql,How would you describe the difference in the suck-factor between massive over-land expeditions and crossings vs mountain/vertical objectives? Do you prefer one to the other?
colinobrady,fdofxqu,t1_fdodnbf,"The biggest challenge with the Antarctica crossing was the weight of my sled - 375 pounds to start. And actually, although it wasn't as steep as a mountain, I was going uphill. I started at sea level and the roughly halfway point, the South Pole, was 9,310 feet. 

Slight uphill dragging 375 pounds through snow was pretty grueling."
azdak,fdog5jt,t1_fdofxqu,that... is heinous.
Neffthor,fdoxs0m,t1_fdofxqu,Was the down hill noticeable easier at that point?
ElJamoquio,fdp9zqg,t1_fdofxqu,And doing it at 9000+ feet sounds awful.
bigredandthesteve,fdpdsb3,t1_fdofxqu,In no way do I want to devalue your efforts; I myself wouldn’t survive a mile. But did you hop on that sled to get back down to sea level? Bc I sure as hell would’ve.
NewRedditSameTaste,fdojmgf,t3_emfhql,"One more question- as I understand it, the middle of Antarctica is a huge, flat expanse. Did you stumble across anything that surprised you? Maybe a weird question but did it ever get boring?"
colinobrady,fdojscy,t1_fdojmgf,"Yes the polar plateau is just endless white of snow and ice above 9,000 feet. 24 hours of sunlight a day. It was bizarre to be in such an expansive yet never changing landscape. 

Boring is not a feeling that I experience, but it did force me to go deep within."

colinobrady,fdpazbs,t1_fdot7qm,"Although a dog companion would certainly have lifted my spirits, I don't know if that would have technically qualified as ""solo"". 

It would unfortunately never be possible because the use of dogs in Antarctica is no longer legal due to environmental concerns."
sakelover,fdqjn7o,t1_fdpazbs,"In case anyone is wondering, no non-native species except for humans are allowed in Antartica. Dogs were not excepted due to fears of them spreading distemper to the local seal population"

colinobrady,fdoirlk,t1_fdoi3a1,"Correct, I was the first person to ever Snapchat from the summit of Everest!

I believe in the power of storytelling. I encourage everyone to share their stories with the world because I think the world is a better place when we connect and can learn and be inspired by others.

colinobrady,fdojjsn,t1_fdojcis,"The entire crossing, the entire landscape was roughly the same - jyst endless white for as far as the eye can see. Except in a whiteout, when I could barely see two feet in front of my face. It was like being inside the belly of a ping pong ball."

Whereas I was the first person to cross the entire continent. I went via the South Pole but then continued on to the other coast of the continent."
colinobrady,fdpausq,t1_fdp5ra8,"Exactly - he was able to leave food caches for himself along the way since he was retracing his steps on the way back. Since I wasn't  retracing, there were no food caches or ways for me to leave behind weight. What I took from day one, I had to take with me all the way to the end."
The_Running_Free,fdp86wv,t1_fdp5ra8,Yeah he did leave stuff for his trip back. I heard him on a radio interview or podcast and he said he experienced pure joy when he found a candy bar or something on his way back. It was a great story!

I would suggest that people read the [excellent opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/opinion/antarctica-obrady-rudd-solo-crossing.html) written about your expedition by David Roberts, this [piece by Peter Winsor](https://explorersweb.com/2018/12/27/obradys-antarctic-crossing-was-it-really-unassisted/), and look at [this detailed map](https://www.southpolestation.com/trivia/10s/crossings.html) of different Antarctic expeditions.

colinobrady,fdogr5b,t1_fdof6n2,"Some media has mischaracterized the ice ""road"" - true, that the South Pole overland traverse convoy resupplies the South Pole, but there's no ""road"" - it's a huge ice plateau and glacier. But I did a see few examples of rudded up ice and snow from tire traction. 

That said, the vehicles had come several weeks before I was there and the weather and wind blows so hard that even after a few hours, let alone weeks, the tracks are completed gone. 

Lastly, the few sections of tracks that I did see were actually harder to cross than virgin ice and snow because the rudded up tracks would catch and trip my skis and sled. So whenever I saw them I skied besdies them not in them."

theparkpoet,elv6qa,top_level,"Hellooo. So, for the past \~3 years (I started March 2017) I've been living entirely off of writing poems.

I sit out with a table and a sign, usually in Washington Square Park in NYC, and I write poems for every person that asks for one. Usually people give me money! Sometimes they don't!

I live off a combination of: 1) donations from strangers, 2) [online book sales](https://www.theparkpoet.com/store), & 3) my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/peterchinman).

You can check out my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/theparkpoet/) to see photos and poems. You can also google me (Peter Chinman) for some interviews.

Last year I began to notice how many pick-up artists were in the park. There so many of them who were there almost every day, spending hours targeting women. I started calling them out, and then staging ""interventions"" when they would make approaches. I've had a few testy run-ins with some of the ""dating coaches"" who lead pick-up artist classes. I've been threatened (and attempted to be seduced). But the interventions work! The pick-up artists started avoiding the section of the park I was in and would complain about me in their private telegram chat.

kingdot,fdlclte,t1_fdkyxig,"Don't tell me that one could reasonably be expected to build a retirement while living in the current brand of poverty that is now systematically designed to keep one impoverished as it never has been before.

Those in poverty may never own property due to newly increased taxation that now disproportionately affects the poor, and they can't eat out at restaurants, or travel, or recreate, or get health insurance (or afford care even if they are insured). From this perspective, ""living in the now"" is revealed as an emergent condition imposed on those who can't affect economic change for themselves or others in their position. Unfortunately, it's not the individual's choice anymore- it's become a cycle of learned helplessness that is bought by those with more influence.

There needs to be gov't action toward public protection from adverse economic factors and cannibalistic legislation that punishes the poor.  We need increased corporate regulation and taxation. The scales of our economy are definitely tipped, but who benefits from the tipping? Who's doing the tipping?

games_and_movies,fdkywhg,t1_fdkv75n,"Pickup Artistry is basically just a term for a kind of ""education"" that guys who either have trouble getting laid or want to get laid more often go through.

A lot of these ""courses"" are taught by dubious internet misogynists (who generally don't have degrees or formal education in anything relevant to the subject of human relationships, sex, or romance, like psychology) who teach men tactics that are supposed to make women more likely to sleep with them. Some of these tactics include aggressive pursual (not taking ""no"" for an answer) and negging (insulting the woman so that she feels like she needs to impress you). They also often teach the idea that women are generally disposable and the goal is not to have sex with anyone you're genuinely connected to, but to sleep with as many women as possible just to feel good. They generally eschew the concept of romance at all with the idea that your life will be better so long as you're getting laid as much as possible.

Drew1231,fdlajeo,t1_fdkywhg,"I will never forget when some kids asked a sub how to ""get bitches."" 

It was a kinda unruly sophomore class that I was a TA in. The teacher prettymuch let the kids do whatever they wanted.

One day a sub came in. He was a college student and came off as a pretty cool guy. At the end of the class he asked if there were any other questions and the class clown asked how to get bitches. He proceeded to give a lecture, complete with boardwork, on negging.

It didn't seem weird at the time because he seemed like a cool guy, buy in retrospect or makes me worry about why Mr Ishaq was always subbing."

1.) Did you formally study poetry anywhere, like in college or anything?  If so, what program did you attend?

2.) Have you ever submitted to / been accepted by any contest or literary journals?

3.) Who are some of your favorite poets?  Do you find that any other poets have influenced your style?"
theparkpoet,fdl2i0i,t1_fdkvk6d,"1) Studied literature, philosophy, and math in college. Went to Pomona College

2) I've started submitting in the past few months. Haven't been accepted anywhere. Tbh, I'm conflicted about it. Seems like poetry journals are mostly just read by other published poets.

3) I love Anne Carson, Jack Gilbert, Gerard Manley Hopkins, … … so many more. I'm sure they all influenced me, but it's all so subconscious it's hard to tease apart."
eternalquiet,fdl8okk,t1_fdl2i0i,"1.) That's really cool.  I focused on English and Theatre Education when I was in undergrad, and I just finished my MFA in Creative Writing with an emphasis in poetry.

2.) I feel that so hard!  Submitting to journals is tough, and it's hard to find a good home for your work.  And if you're going for the contest circuit or trying to get a book published, it can be expensive to pay for the submission fees.  I've got a book I'm trying to get published right now, because I'd like to get into teaching, and having at least one publishing credit would be good.

And it does kinda seem like your audience, if you're submitting to journals, is most likely to be writers in a more academic setting.

3.) I haven't read any of them, and now I have some new entries on my reading list!  My favorite poets in recent memory have probably been Nick Flynn (specifically his collection ""Some Ether"") and Aaron Smith (and his collection ""Primer"").  I recently re-read Brian Turner's collection ""Here, Bullet"" and remembered why I loved it so much the first time."

professork2,fdlsts4,t1_fdl2i0i,I’m currently getting my PhD in rhetoric and writing. Poetry journals are SO hard to get published in. I think the average acceptance rate is like 5%-7% and some even make you pay to submit.

* Do you feel that the quality of your street work is subpar compared to your book material?
* How does your creative process work?

He took the “losers” that were contestants on the show and then they all had to do ridiculous things like wear leather pants, loud flashy silk shirts, top hats, gold jewelry, 9 rings, ear and eyebrow piercings, fancy shoes, etc.  basically they had to be “fashionable” but only if your frame of reference was a club in Germany in 1996.

Barn_cat,fdl263p,t1_fdks2tp,"Reading through this thread, at first, I was confused as to why so many people were piling on OP. I mean, his post is a bit eccentric and sanctimonious, but he's a young artist - that's to be expected, and it doesn't bother me much. I still think it's admirable to live on your own terms and do what you love.

BUT, then I actually checked the instagram post a few people called out, and damn, huge entitlement issues there. I live in Brooklyn, and I have plenty of artist friends who live similar bohemian lifestyles, but none of them would pull shit like that. They all live off of their own artistic merit without having to shame and bully folks  into giving them money. That's not art, that's aggressive panhandling by choice rather than necessity.

On the other hand, the amount of PUA apologists in the thread is pretty disgusting... and no, I'm not referring to those who simply disagree with OP's method of ""intervention"". Also sad to see some folks going after OP solely based upon his looks and eccentricities. That's not nice."

theparkpoet,fdkex1p,t1_fdkeas0,"So many beautiful weird moments. I have a newsletter I send out with stories from the park, I'm gonna paste an excerpt of one of my favorite moments—

 

His voice was raw like gravel in a scraped knee. You write poems?

Yes.

He nodded, scowling. Slouchy black rags hung from his body.

He walked off to a bench and left the assortment of tattered baggery he had with him. He came back over to me and growled, I would like a poem.

About anything in particular?

First thing I think of is Christ I guess.

I started writing his poem. Take your time, he said, eyeing the crowds & occasionally muttering low incomprehensible things to himself.

Two tourists came up and announced that they wanted a poem.

I looked up at them and nodded. I have to finish this one first.

Don’t worry about mine, the man in black rags gravelled. You got customers.

I shook my head. You were first. I turned back to the poem & finished it & handed it to him. He took it delicately & thanked me & walked back to the bench.

I wrote a poem for the tourists and by then a few more people had come up for poems. As I wrote I saw out of the corner of my eye the man in black rags wandering over to the fountain with what looked like a jagged piece of glass, and wandering back, the sunlight glinting from what he held in his hands.

After I’d worked my way thru the line, the man came back up—the jagged glint of glass flashing in his hands. I looked at it and saw it wasn’t broken but just a plain old glass bowl filled with water thru which the sun was lensed and refracted into swirling lines of light. I stared at this vessel as he approached, and at one moment suddenly a swish of black ribbon appeared at the edge of the glass and a fish swam into view, which had until this instant been hidden somehow in the curve of light.

He placed it on my table. I looked down at the flashing black purple ribbon of fish. From above it looked so much smaller.

This is Charley, he said. You just got to feed him some bread crumbs once a week. I gave him some new water.

You want me to have him?

Yea. Just promise you’ll take care of him.

I promised.

All day while I wrote poems, I watched Charley flashing in the light as he fluttered around in the the bowl."
hoerensagen,fdkhkpp,t1_fdkex1p,"Did Charley stay with you? Do you take him around everywhere? Also, how long does it take you to write a poem? How much variation is there?"

Bebeours,fdkutab,t3_elv6qa,What is the point of a pick up artist. I’ve never heard of such a thing. Is it like a romance scam or con? Can someone explain.
newyne,fdlaaa7,t1_fdkutab,"Oh, boy, so... Pick up artists are basically men who think they can act their way into a woman's pants. Basically, if they say and do a number of things, the woman will find them attractive. This is not actual good practice like listening and having good hygiene, more like... Mind games. Hitting the right emotional beats whether you're sincere or not, and... This is where we get the idea of ""negging."" That is, giving backhanded compliments or otherwise insulting the woman so she'll feel bad about herself and settle for you. They learn how to identify women who are insecure or otherwise vulnerable, don't spend much time with those who are resistant, and talk to a lot fo women with the thought that *someone* will go along. 

I think I may have been targeted by them once or twice in the past? I dunno, I've definitely had at least one guy guys try negging on me, which, surprise surprise, was a gigantic turn-off! Instead of making me feel bad about myself, it just makes me think, *Who the hell do you think you are and what the fuck do you know about me?* It makes me think that person must be really immature and narrow minded, and... I think that's a pretty typical response, honestly."
Bebeours,fdlc2px,t1_fdlaaa7,Thank you so much for replying! I googled it and had a bunch of weird confusing stuff come up about it. Ohhh I definitely have a had a date or 2 that did that to me!

OP, do you have any intentions to address the numerous problems outlined with your practice within this AMA?  
OP's justifications seem inconsistent and mostly done through assertions that are themselves unjustified. There have been several problematic hypothetical situations (even real situations!) brought up by commenters that outline potential harm caused by this sort of behaviour, and OP has yet to address these meaningfully.

For example, OP essentially saying ""I think it's a good thing to have a zone in the park without pickup artists,"" or ""I'm good at picking out who the pickup artists are.""  
Both of those statements are HIGHLY contestable, and this has yet to be addressed or even acknowledged by OP.

I think pickup artists are pretty miserable human beings, but frankly, I'm getting the impression that your contribution to the world is strikingly similar in nature."

Terra2Official,endtv4,top_level,"Hey guys! Thanks for tuning in! A few months ago, we launched our startup Terra2 to enter the ground floors of fighting climate change. Since then, we have raised almost $75,000 to fund our lean 8-team operation. At Terra2, we believe people want to fight climate change—they just don’t have the opportunity to easily participate.

· The United Nations [2019 climate report](https://www.unenvironment.org/interactive/emissions-gap-report/2019/) states that the world only has until 2030 to prevent catastrophic consequences from climate change. It’s almost on the verge of becoming impossible.

· Technological improvements in the last few years have made solar cheaper than natural gas, coal, wind, etc. ( [https://www.lazard.com/media/451086/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-130-vf.pdf](https://www.lazard.com/media/451086/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-130-vf.pdf))

· While investments into renewable energy are increasing, it’s not enough. We need to get more solar farms into the ground ASAP.

· Our goal is to open renewable energy to a new source of investment: you, the average investor! By accelerating the flow of capital into this space, we can build more solar farms faster and save the world before it’s too late.

Our solution is an online platform that lets everyday people quickly invest into solar farms, earn a return on investment (the profit from selling energy to power grids), and monitor carbon emissions reductions over time. We’re launching a beta platform later this year! Check out our website at [www.terra2.com](http://www.terra2.com/) and if you like what you see, please join the waitlist. We want to share our site visits and form submissions with investors so we can show them that this is a project with real demand worth funding. We’d also love any feedback, either positive or negative, so we can make improvements to our ideas as quickly as possible.

**Q: What do you provide that normal solar/energy ETFs dont?**

A: The plan is to build out a tech platform with features that will keep users actively engaged with their energy investments. With regards to returns, at this time, we can't give a projection on those numbers at this time. What we can say is that we will definitely aim to compete with the returns that ETFs provide with the hopes that they'll be appealing enough to incentivize users to use our platform!

**Q: Will you only operate in the U.S? Do you have plans for international projects?**

A: We'd definitely love to invest overseas but we chose to start in the States for now which we believe is a great target considering it's the second largest producer of emissions after China! We are definitely looking to expand overseas as soon as we can.

**Q: What do you mean we only have a decade left..?**

A: No, the world is probably not coming to an end in 10 years. However, [according to the 2019 Emissions Gap Report from the UN](https://www.unenvironment.org/interactive/emissions-gap-report/2019/), we are running out of time to reduce emissions to a point that would limit the increasingly severe environmental impacts of the future.

**Q: Why solar? What about other renewable sources?**

A: The costs for solar development have declined due to improvements in solar technology, making it more attractive as an investment offering. From a logistical perspective, at our current early stage for a team of our size with minimal resources, it makes sense to us to focus our efforts rather than risk spreading ourselves thin across multiple types and and not properly executing on any of them.

**Q: What can I do to help?**

A: A good first step would always be to do your own due diligence/research and understand for yourself the current state of the many environmental facts, as well as arguments out there, from both sides.

That being said there are a multitude of ways to contribute to positive environmental change. Our platform that we're creating is just but one of them that we hope will drive positive impact and that we hope you will support.

GoX14,fdzces2,t3_endtv4,"Okay, so my understanding (which is likely wrong) is that this is basically a socially conscious crowd-sourced investment. Those exist in other verticals. Conceptually, it kinda works. But I can already invest in a solar ETF or an equity. And anyone can do that. And those are much lower risk than this pseudo-angel investment. So in order for it to work, there has to exist the possibility of a much higher return than those competing investment vehicles.

Can you model the returns for us, assuming a $1,000 investment?"
aaaaaaaarrrrrgh,fe1peps,t1_fdzces2,"My guess, purely based on their self-description above: They will appeal to emotion and ""the cause"" to make it work, i.e. to get people to invest in things that aren't great investments.

Which can be totally legit (allowing activist investors to forgo profits in favor of supporting green projects), but also has the potential of screwing over clueless people, even if the company running it has the best intentions (and if the company running it were evil, this would be a platform that will attract plenty of easily exploited people who make decisions mainly based on feelings).

Right now, I shouldn’t say any specific number until offering circulars are made available. That will have financial information that you need to model the asset before you make any investments. This document would be involved with the SEC qualification. But this will come later, and vary project by project. It’ll obviously have to be professionally audited and checked before we make a project’s financials public to you.

GoX14,fe0afgb,t1_fdzzaxh,"Thanks for the response! From an unbiased perspective, as someone with a similar background to you guys, I think this answer needs some work. I can explain how stocks or ETFs work to people, using a $1,000 investment as an example, without risking any sort of thorny legalese. A model is not a promise. But it's quintessentially important that the model can be easily described, and some ballpark numbers can be used.

Is this like a VC model, where I should expect a lot of failure with occasional giant returns?

Or is this more like an equity, where I should expect more consistent, smaller long term gains?

Reading through a few of your answers, it's troubling that the answer to those two questions isn't obvious. 

I just think it needs a lot of buttoning up, especially since you're already fundraising. But I respect the concept at least at its core!"

UniqueUser12975,fe1hn1g,t1_fdzzaxh,"I am a renewable project finance and M&A professional and so many of your answers make no sense to me.

You say you choose solar because costs have come down so much they make the best investment, but solar investment returns are terrible, sub 8% and that's for levered equity, project returns might be 4 or 5 per cent.

You say you will beat ETF returns bit that seems impossible given the above.

Finally you act like crowdsourcing direct investment in renewables is something you invented but theres dozens of platforms out there (not counting all the ones that went bust). This is a shady as hell sector because the platform takes a big cut but no risk and the investors are relying on them to do all the due diligence.

Terra2Official,fdys79t,t1_fdyq0kg,"Great question! A regular solar ETF let’s you invest in different solar companies. We let you directly invest into a solar project or solar farm itself. So, the asset you are investing into is fundamentally different.

Additionally, ETFs don’t let you pick. We give individual investment decisions to you so you can  handpick which solar projects you want to invest into and build your own solar portfolio that way. 

Lastly, we will be tracking your emissions reductions over time. You will be able to check it real-time on your phone, on the website, etc. 

Hope that highlights the key differences! Please let us know if you have more questions!

David"
pperca,fdyytix,t1_fdys79t,"Let me see if I got this right.

1) You are tech developers who do not really have financial investment background or deep knowledge of the solar energy space. 

2) The people you expect to crown fund these farms likely do not have that knowledge either and I don't see anything in your proposal that will help a regular investor decide which projects to fund (that's why ETFs have professionals with decades in the industry to ""handpick which solar projects"" to invest). Solar investments are not Instagram posts for you to ""like"". It requires a minimum of understanding of the energy market, solar technology and investigation on the background of the company running the farm to be a realistic proposal. I don't see your proposal of ""letting a layman pick a solar project to invest"" as a benefit at all. 

3) All you seem to offer is a vague promise of ""my future emissions will be tracked by an app on my phone"". I'm not really quite sure what you are planning to track here, how relevant it is or what that has to do with efficiency and financial health of the farm you intend to fund. 

So, instead of investing in SEC regulated solar ETFs (some that have been producing some very healthy returns of 50+% YTY which are driving more investments and new projects), do you expect people to send investment money to your GoFund style platform with no return guarantees and some questionable tech features like a fuzzy carbon metric?

I sincerely hope that's not all you are proposing and that the friends and family members that provided with you with the angel funding do not need that money. 

A real solar investment offering will require a lot more sophisticated energy planning tooling to assess investment and viability of those farms (location, sun coverage, local demand, local supply, grid capabilities, energy trading figures, historic energy bid analysis with predictions and trends). You don't seem to be even in the ballpark of that kind of plan. 

I'd pass, sorry."
hackel,fdz3eum,t1_fdys79t,"So the basic premise of an ETF is that it very cheaply diversifies risk by spreading investments over a larger surface, right?

Your proposal is to increase the risk 100 fold by asking people not even to choose which particular company is going to be profitable, but which individual *project* within a company will be the most profitable?  That is insane.  What research and expert analysis do you provide to help average investors make a smart investment?

Do you have any idea how bad this sounds?  If you take the environmental side out of it, you become snake oil salesman.  People will absolutely fall for it, and a couple will even get lucky and get rich, but it is barely better than ""investing"" in the lottery."

399g,fdzssuf,t1_fdyytix,Good call.
Terra2Official,fdzy4mt,t1_fdyytix,"Hi pperca,

So our CEO actually has worked on financial modeling for both gas pipelines and large solar projects so we do have some industry expertise on our team! Sorry for not clarifying that sooner.

Regarding your second point, we totally understand your concern and in general would want our investors and investors everywhere to be able to make good decisions with their investments. We also totally agree that the diversification offered by ETFs is very beneficial.

That said, there are a couple reasons we believe our company is a useful complement to what's out there on the market right now.

1. I'm not sure which ETFs you are recommending specifically. However, the ETFs I've seen are mostly comprised of companies that are related to the solar space but aren't primarily involved in the business of financing solar farms. For example, Invesco Solar ETF is mostly comprised of solar techology companies ([https://www.etf.com/TAN#overview](https://www.etf.com/TAN#overview)). While these are definitely useful, they perform a very different role in the solar energy ecosystem than we're proposing. At the least, the money invested in these funds won't go in their entirety to financing solar farms.
2. Ease of use: One of our goals is to make it extremely easy to invest in these types of products while also surfacing important details about the underlying assets in a clean and transparent way. While we may be less diversified than ETFs, we definitely aim to be more transparent and easy to use. If the average investor of a solar ETF like Invesco wanted more information on what they were invested in they would have to dig through the SEC filings of the individual companies comprising the ETF. One of our goals is to make understanding what your invested in as easy and transparent as possible.

Finally, we are **by no means advising individuals to invest their life savings with us**. Nowhere do we offer to make people a quick buck or guarantee the safety of their investment. Rather, we think that as a private market investment with an underlying revenue generating asset (where the revenue may be contracted or uncontracted depending on the investor's risk profile), users can diversify their portfolio by investing a small percentage with us. We also believe that there are few other investments you can make that would have as direct an impact on emissions reductions as us!

Finally, our offerings will be registered with the SEC and actually, the financial filings we need to do are one of our primary expected expenses!

Finally regarding your third point, realtime tracking of carbon emissions reduction and related realtime data is something that hasn't been done before or at least not made publicly available. It will require realtime tracking of the productivity of the underlying asset which is a difficult problem and also fantastic in terms of visibility to our end users. We agree that the specific carbon emissions reductions display doesn't have much to do with the financial health of our assets - this is a cool new feature we can offer that provides a transparency from a climate change impact perspective that people haven't seen before!"
inertargongas,fdzsg43,t1_fdyytix,"What solar ETFs are you buying that invest in actual power production? The only thing I've ever seen are ETFs that buy solar panel producers, just like OP said in the comment you're replying to. This is an important distinction. We can throw all the money in the world at the stocks of companies that make solar panels, but if nobody buys the damn panels themselves, it won't do a bit of good. OP's platform addresses this shortfall of the investing markets in a way that I have yet to see being done elsewhere. Some states have small community solar projects that allow small investors to participate in building and owning solar projects, but I've yet to be able to access a single such project, despite doing my research and having lots of money to invest and trying to stay on top of the latest developments....

The fact that you're talking about getting a 50% YTY return confirms my suspicion, because it means you're holding volatile solar panel producers. An actual solar power production holding would be more akin to a savings product than a stock - slow, consistent returns. The sun shines, and you get a dividend. The companies you're holding are volatile specifically because their fates are highly uncertain, and that's because it's anybody's guess when we're going to get serious about building out solar.

Edited to expand on the thought and make my wording more clear re: solar panel producers vs solar power producers. Reading my own comment back was confusing even to me lol. Anyway, I've been waiting for a platform like this to come along. Remains to be seen if it's any good of course, but I want to give my thanks and appreciation to OP & their team for making the effort. Linking small amounts of capital with projects that would be outside the reach of a small investor, it's a smart idea - look at the way LendingClub and Prosper are changing the consumer lending industry, even though they're going up against huge well-established institutions to do it. Applying that kind of strength to solar power investments is only going to accelerate the transition to sustainable power."

I can see in your website he was an intern and then an analyst in the trading desk for Vega Energy for about a year. I'm afraid that's not a whole lot of experience with energy trading and solar production. 

> We also totally agree that the diversification offered by ETFs is very beneficial.

It's not just diversification but fund managers they have experience with the markets and a fiduciary responsibility with the investor's money. In your model both are missing. 

> ETFs I've seen are mostly comprised of companies that are related to the solar space but aren't primarily involved in the business of financing solar farms

Like I said in another reply, I don't think lack of capital is what's holding back solar farms. The real issues are related to the grid and energy storage, not production. 

>One of our goals is to make it extremely easy to invest in these types of products while also surfacing important details about the underlying assets in a clean and transparent way.

During the tech bubble of the 2000's, it was extremely easy to invest in tech companies that inflated their revenue numbers by making out deals with other tech startups. No real money existed, just paper. 

Ease of investment is not the issue here. Let's assume you are widely successful, make tons of money in fees, a huge number of non viable farms are funded and the whole thing crashes. The fossil fuel companies would have a field day with that financial disaster, solar will have a huge set back, investors will be out of their money but you guys will keep the fees. Sounds like the risk is all with other people. 

>If the average investor of a solar ETF like Invesco wanted more information on what they were invested in they would have to dig through the SEC filings of the individual companies comprising the ETF. One of our goals is to make understanding what your invested in as easy and transparent as possible.

The reason why the SEC is involved in securities and investments is to prevent scams. If the average investors can't read an SEC filing, that person has no business investing in a model like yours. 

Unless you intent to file the same disclosures as an ETF and be regulated the same, I believe transparency won't mean much since there's no actual oversight. 

>Rather, we think that as a private market investment with an underlying revenue generating asset (where the revenue may be contracted or uncontracted depending on the investor's risk profile), users can diversify their portfolio by investing a small percentage with us. 

If you don't plan to run this as a regular ETF, I would not recommend anybody to invest any amount in this model. Even kickstarters have rules related to investments that don't pay up.

Are you guys going to monitor how the money is invested by those farms, will those farms have to file financial disclosures to get the money, will any of this be regulated?

>Finally, our offerings will be registered with the SEC

As what? What kind of classification will be used for your investment instrument?

>realtime tracking of carbon emissions reduction 

What exactly are you planning to track? Just because there's a farm producing energy with a person's money, that doesn't translate in emission cuts by said individual. 

>It will require realtime tracking of the productivity of the underlying asset 

Again, solar production and reduction in carbon emissions are not the same thing. The grid usually can't handle the extra energy at peak hours from solar and wind. Most of that energy is wasted, especially if not forecasted correctly. The bidding in the morning is what defines what goes in the grid, so monitoring production does nothing more than understand production availability. 

>this is a cool new feature we can offer that provides a transparency from a climate change impact perspective that people haven't seen before!

With all due respect, it's a gimmick designed to attack uneducated investors that will be fooled into believing that's a real metric. 

Again, you guys seem to be trying to oversimplify a very complex and intricate market just to become a trade desk for a niche targeting non sophisticated investors."

Yorikor,fe0hm1q,t1_fdzy4mt,"> Finally regarding your third point, realtime tracking of carbon emissions reduction and related realtime data is something that hasn't been done before or at least not made publicly available.

Uhm, isn't this done by almost every solar array? Every car park with solar panels has a digital display that tracks the CO2 saved around here."
Welltobeapup,fdztxdf,t1_fdzsg43,"From the sound of it, it's much like having mineral/royalty interests for oil and gas or things like that. You would own a small percentage of the actual solar farm and would get probably a very small amount of money for your investment, but it would be for effectively forever. The problem I don't understand is once a farm is funded are people selling their interests? This is seemingly only useful for the initial construction of solar farms and your options would be limited if there really are any."
Puppys_cryin,fe4u9ar,t1_fdzsg43,"You brought up an important distinction between the available ETF and this proposed product but you haven't addressed the risk involved in being an investor in individual assets that makes Ops idea inherently a very very risky product. Think of it this way, if this type of financing was truly desirable you'd see it in a very mature asset class like drilling rights where people invest in fractional ownership in individual wells.  The problem is that most of those (wells) and I suspect these (solar projects) are terrible and you could never tout a index of these returns because the losses would outweigh the winners. It appears OP would rather collect fees from putting people into investments rather than make a diversified vehicle for someone to buy an aggregate of them with one click. Any investor should ask why are they doing it that way?"
oversized_hoodie,fe34cae,t1_fdzwgxj,"Yeah, but it sounds more like something investment professionals should be doing - the amount of active management and market/technology knowledge required to pick good projects far outstrips that of your typical retirement savings investor."

8bitnand,fe1ohts,t1_fe0dqox,"Thanks for the analysis. It was an eye opener on the energy market. 

/u/Terra2Official can you validate his points?"
Modokon,fe26cmq,t1_fe0dqox,"It's becoming more apparent that these guys are maybe well meaning, but out of their depth. Problem is that people will suffer due to their ignorance.

I invested $12k in solar, in my home. But I make about $1k a year in savings and FIT returns. That was an investment I could live with and the asset is owned by me, on my roof and in my attic ""space"" .

I also have a COOL TRACKER that shows how much CO2 I have saved. Yay. 

Giving these guys money? Not a hope."
Terra2Official,fe5gal7,t1_fe0dqox,"Hey! Thanks for the responses. This is David and I will be as objective in my responses as I can to answer your questions/concerns:

I do have experience in solar production. My most recent job was at Lightsource BP, where I was responsible for financial modeling for a few solar projects (30+ opportunities). I haven’t worked in the development and construction of, but that’s a risk that has largely been mitigated as we will be working with industry EPC and developers for that. In the industry, you can either have an experienced in-house construction team or you can subcontract for a known budget. We will do the latter, and we’ve confirmed that this is all possible.

We recognize there’s gaps in our knowledge—and that’s why we have a board of advisors that we get guidance from! They include executives—one has founded and sold a $100m solar development company to Cypress Creek Renewables, and one has been involved in energy transactions of over $1B. We are thankful for these experts who can lend us their experience and continue to guide us. 

I understand your concern, but let me assure you that we’re as incentivized as our individual investors to screen for and do due diligence for high quality assets. As a business, it would undermine our reputation and goals to offer low-quality products. There are many industry standard forms such as the PVsyst, 8760, IA agreements, System layouts, etc. that we would be reviewing. Additionally, we’re actually working on our own diligence model to help us create an added layer of diligence so that we can filter out potentially bad projects. Those would all have to be prepared in advance of an offering of a specific solar project for investments. We wouldn’t be hiding financials. All of this is legally required for us to qualify successfully with the SEC.

If you are interested in the SEC, please take a read at the SEC JOBS Act under Regulation A+. It’s quite long but that is currently our process. More details are also on our website (at the footer).


I don’t know what you are implying about the tech bubble, but we wouldn’t be artificially inflating numbers on paper... seems illegal! Again, financial disclosures are a requirement for our qualification of our offering with the SEC. We will take this feedback to heart and work on providing a more detailed description for what our users should expect before making their investments: such as financial disclosures, form 1-As, offering circulars, project details, etc."
Zeusified30,fe2m1qu,t1_fe0dqox,"Absolutely spot on regarding all points. I have a feeling the entrepreneurs are well meaning but did not realize the amount of (financial) expertise necessary to go this route with their intentions. 

I hope the team is able to turn their vision to a more reasonable expectation and are able to make good use of their idealistic intentions.

Absolutely agree though, financially I wouldn't touch this with a 10-foot pole, even if they manage to get some sort of SEC approval"
Astralahara,fe494sf,t1_fe0dqox,"Yes. One of the biggest issues with this project is that by ""Young"" they mean wildly under-qualified to be handling the millions in investments that this would require."

BlueStoneArt,fe1r1y6,t1_fe02efg,"I think they are surprised that actually intelligent people showed up, with a clear understanding of what they are not doing.

They originally started the AMA with just a link to the website as their ""proof"", driving traffic to it. Nothing else.  This line didn't show up until after the AMA: ""We want to share our site visits and form submissions with investors so we can show them that this is a project with real demand worth funding."" With just the website address as their ""proof"" they were most assuredly attempting to push web traffic. I was the first one on their AMA and I caught that immediately and requested additional proof. Their link immediately went ""broken"".

Their introduction has greatly expanded over the course of the day, but it's what should have been there from Minute One. I'm sure they thought they could come on, chat about ""clean solar energy"" and the dum dum redditor would hear some buzz words would start sending them cash.  Oh, and get on a ""wait list"".

I'm sure they were shocked when actual professional with intelligence showed up and started asking hard questions that they could not answer. There was a lot of evasion. Worse, the hard questions were never actually answered.

It definitely appears this AMA was more an attempt to drive web traffic so they could show it to 'investors' as 'interest' in their product.

They earlier said they quit their jobs to do this, now it is amended and their data engineer is working on it part time.

It sounds like a rag tag group of college grads think they've come up with the billionaire idea of a web platform and an app. Where the average dum dum can pick a windmill and sponsor it and view the carbon emissions savings in 'real time' that is actually once a month.

The 'ground floor' was quite a bit ago and I think they missed that elevator.

Just my thoughts."

inertargongas,fdzuve4,t1_fdztxdf,"> once a farm is funded are people selling their interests?

That's a good question. I would think this site would eventually have to support some kind of secondary market so people can sell their stake. The P2P lending sites do the same thing, because obviously you might not want to wait 5 years for your $100 microloan to finish paying out."
Terra2Official,fdzywds,t1_fdztxdf,This is a great question! Liquidity is a definitely a difficult problem to solve for companies with our type of business model. Thanks to interargongas for that answer. A secondary market is definitely something we want to do or alternatively provide some sort of regular buyback program if you'd like to unload your stake in our assets! But you've hit the nail on the head. This is fundamentally a long term cash flowing asset!

inertargongas,fe69yw3,t1_fdzywds,"You're welcome. I really, really like what you guys are trying to achieve here. I don't know how many times I've searched for a web site that does exactly this. With cost of production being what it is, we're definitely talking about a non zero sum game. Investors who want a different kind of asset class to diversify their portfolio can get a nice little return, while solar manufacturers can expand their business, consumers can get cheaper power, and obviously the environment benefits when we wind up doing less fracking and whatever else. Everyone wins.

I hope it's profitable for you guys. I hope you find some big guys to invest in it and keep the ball rolling. Definitely reminds me of SolarCity trying to connect people who already have a roof, with the capital needed to make that roof productive. The reduced land use and infrastructure requirements (compared with building a solar farm in a field somewhere) yielded significant economic gains, and everyone benefits."

Jax325701,fdz1cyi,t3_endtv4,Have you ever actually developed a solar farm?  How are you going to post credit for interconnects?  What markets will you focus in?
Terra2Official,fdz8b45,t1_fdz1cyi,"Great question. Yes, several of our team members are very experienced in energy, and one of them actually worked for a major solar company and was a part of many solar utility-scale projects! The markets that we are currently focused on is ERCOT and CAISO, which are the grids for Texas and California respectively. The reasoning here is because it is deregulated, so we don't have to be an utility to sell electricity there. 

&#x200B;

That said, for interconnects, letter of credits for interconnects are actually for a very short-term but they can be a large amount, depending on the interconnection costs and strategy. That said, posting letters of credits for an interconnection position is not a major obstacle for us. It is commonly done in the business."

Terra2Official,fe5hu2y,t1_fdzbz9t,"Pretty much! And the way we see it, this isn’t a bad thing!

If we had the money ourselves to fund the construction and maintenance of hundreds solar farms, that’s what we’d be doing because we believe solar energy to be one of the best ways to move forward into a renewable future. Other people share that belief, too, and we just want to provide a way to pool all the small amounts that people can afford/are willing to invest together to work towards a common goal.

And yes, we’re for-profit, but that’s because we think that being for-profit can attract a wider audience of investors and customers (not just philanthropists). It’s the unfortunate truth that money is the biggest motivator in our society right now, and we’re aiming to align financial incentives of big players with the interests of everyone on the earth."
MajorWhite,fe5jo4c,t1_fe5hu2y,"It seems to me that people are not a fan of the for-profit middle man. Perhaps it comes off as exploiting the issue of climate change.

The_Humble_Braggart,fdzi8qi,t3_endtv4,"Firstly, love your enthusiasm for the viability of PV solar, and evangelising it as an investment asset. Great stuff. 

I’ve had a quick poke around on your website and looked at the Q&A so far, and I have a number of questions. 

 To be frank, I’m not sure what the value proposition is for the average investor here. Massive portfolios of renewable energy assets, a large proportion of which are solar farms, already exist worldwide through large funds like Greencoat, Blackrock, DIF, Gresham and Octopus Energy, just to name a few. I understand that your appeal is in “direct investment” in solar farms by individuals, but these types of asset portfolios work best by leveraging economies of scale and standardised asset management, and it doesn’t look like you can currently offer that. 

From your website, you have stated that “Money from investors is pooled together to build or finance a solar farm in  cooperation with established solar industry partners.” So it sounds like you’re talking about investment in greenfield projects. If you’re seeking development funding for a greenfield project, regardless of whether it’s all equity funding through your platform or includes a debt package, each project is going to need to be bankable (especially if the asset is going to have any resale value), which raises a number of questions... 

- Will these solar farms rely on revenue from private wire PPAs or will they be connected to the grid and rely on wholesale sales? Or at this stage is it anything goes? 

- What is your strategy for participating in capacity auctions? There is a good deal of uncertainty around feed in tariffs in parts of the USA at the moment. which grid operators/regions have been identified as good targets?

- When you refer to “established solar industry partners”, who is your EPC contractor? Who is your O&M contractor going to be for these assets once built? Who is going to manage these assets and supervise your O&M contractor?

- If investors are investing “directly” via your platform, what will they actually own? Shares in a project holdco?

- You state that you “eventually plan to allow our users to direct and customize the solar projects.” How will this be achieved with the strict planning requirements for project development and grid connection for solar PV projects?

- Further into the asset life of these solar farms, will these assets be able to be transferred/sold to large portfolio operators and out of the hands of your platform and its investors?

- How will decisions such as whether or not asset life extension or re-energisation is desirable or appropriate, be made?

- How will provisions for de-commissioning costs, etc., impact the distributions made to investors? Will provisions be made over the life of the assets from offtake revenue?"
onedollar12,fe3324o,t1_fdzi8qi,"The acquisition of a solar facility, operating or development, takes months and months of diligence. Not sure how a retail investor is able to do the same amount of work as a Blackrock or utility with a financial advisor."
Terra2Official,fdzrkat,t1_fdzi8qi,"Hello! Wow lots of great questions here. Here's a first pass at answers:

Regarding your question of how we compare to the funds you mentioned (Greencoat, Blackrock, etc.), one of our primary value propositions is allowing unaccredited investors to be able to invest as well. Another value proposition is usability so people can easily invest, track their investments, and see other transparency related metrics such as solar farm performance on a unified mobile and web platform. We believe the combination of these two things will significantly expand participation in solar asset investing whereas these funds are relatively obscure and hard to use. 

We totally agree with the fact that economies of scale are hugely beneficial. As a startup we simply aren't going to be able to offer economies of scale in our portfolios since we clearly won't have as many assets as the funds mentioned above. We are definitely seeking to scale soon after the launching our first couple projects and to leverage similar economies of scale. We are currently and in the future will continue to invest in being a data driven company to support our scaling efforts. 

We're going for both greenfield and brownfield. Our investment strategies will be 100% equity or at least have a much higher equity to debt ratio than with traditional financing of these projects. 

***""Will these solar farms rely on revenue from private wire PPAs or will they be connected to the grid and rely on wholesale sales? Or at this stage is it anything goes?""***

We'll offer both for investors with different risk profiles. ERCOT offers higher risk but could offer higher returns. We can also enter into private wire PPAs which we are exploring with our partner Graphene Core. We'll choose our strategies on a  project by project basis. 

***""What is your strategy for participating in capacity auctions? There is a good deal of uncertainty around feed in tariffs in parts of the USA at the moment. which grid operators/regions have been identified as good targets?""***

ERCOT, which is the primary unregulated grid we're investigating, does not have 

***""When you refer to “established solar industry partners”, who is your EPC contractor? Who is your O&M contractor going to be for these assets once built? Who is going to manage these assets and supervise your O&M contractor?""***

We will be subcontracting EPC contractors. We'll be making decisions on who we contract as we get closer to construction. We will be thoroughly vetting our partners. We're also members of the American SEAS and have other advisors in the solar space who we can reach out to during this discovery process. Whether or not we want to hire an O&M contractor or do it in house is a decision we'll make as we learn more about our project. We'll be relying on the experience of our advisor, Michael Shore, who has years of experience in this field. 

***""If investors are investing “directly” via your platform, what will they actually own? Shares in a project holdco?""***

While the legal entities we use to manage our offerings may change in the future for different offerings, investors will be buying shares in a project co. 

**""You state that you “eventually plan to allow our users to direct and customize the solar projects.” How will this be achieved with the strict planning requirements for project development and grid connection for solar PV projects?""**

I think we may have miscommunicated what we meant in that phrase. By ""direct"" we meant that investors would be able to choose the projects they invest in. By ""customize"" we meant that we would be exploring additional option plays i.e. ways to use our solar farms as land as opposed to customizing the actual solar panels and other equipment used by the solar farm. For example, some solar farms lease their land to cow farmers to allow cows to graze. Thanks for pointing this out and we'll definitely update that on the website!

***""Further into the asset life of these solar farms, will these assets be able to be transferred/sold to large portfolio operators and out of the hands of your platform and its investors?""***

Yes that is a possibility but we have not made any concrete decisions on this front. 

***""How will decisions such as whether or not asset life extension or re-energisation is desirable or appropriate, be made?""***

We expect asset life extension is very possible with solar farms, since it's primarily a matter of replacing solar panels. We'll conduct more detailed financial modeling on a per project basis to determine whether this is financially advisable. 

***""How will provisions for de-commissioning costs, etc., impact the distributions made to investors? Will provisions be made over the life of the assets from offtake revenue?""***

Since how we handle decommissioning costs really depends on the specific project details, we'll provide more specific details on how these costs are handled in the offering circulars for specific projects."

399g,fdzu70z,t1_fdyt08s,"Solar farms aren't going to be able to replace the energy needs of manufacturing plants that create solar panels and all of the cement, mounts, wiring, inverters and other equipment involved in processing the electricity. Then there's the consideration not being given to the fact that most solar panels have a useful life of 20 years, at best. Then they have to be properly discarded or recycled somewhere (how does one dispose of millions of solar panels without using a lot more electricity?). Then there's the cost of replacing all of the solar panels through manufacturing, again. It's an endless money pit (nothing sustainable about it)."
IntrospectivePlant,fdzx00d,t1_fdzu70z,You do know solar panels have been generating more energy than needed for production for like a decade now?

SolSeptem,fe1fwe7,t1_fdzu70z,"Dude, the same could be said for any technology. Your argument works literally the same for oil platforms, or gas turbines, or coal fired steam power plants. So it's no inherent disadvantage.

399g,fe2y1fg,t1_fdzx00d,"No, they have not. Where are you getting that statistic?

If solar energy was a great investment, everyone would be involved. The truth is, every 12 months the industry starts sweating bullets in hopes that the US Government will continue to offer incentives to get people to purchase panels. The first time that the government stops the giveaway of taxpayer money, the solar industry will crash. American taxpayers should not be put in the position of paying companies and their neighbors to buy fancy solar systems."
399g,fe3g55s,t1_fe0bn6d,"Solar and wind farms are the Achilles heel of the nation's power sources. They are only financially viable where no means to facilitate a dam, nuclear or coal power plant is possible.

399g,fe3d5s2,t1_fe1fwe7,"There are significant differences, though. The output levels from coal, oil, water and nuclear are much greater in terms of on-demand current. These proven technologies can also be relied upon 24 hours/day.

Solar and wind energy are costly play toys when properly compared."
Terra2Official,fe00lnd,t1_fdzz1ix,Nuclear is a great solution! Unfortunately nuclear is EXTREMELY expensive and difficult to execute on. Nuclear plants also need to get through significant political gridlock which we can't afford to wait for. The use of solar can create a distributed energy grid that is extremely flexible and innovations / lower costs of storage can help to resolve more of the problems related to intermittent sun.
399g,fe2y509,t1_fdzz1ix,"Right! A proven solution, worldwide."
SolSeptem,fe3rsip,t1_fe3d5s2,"I won't deny the timing of energy is an issue with solar and wind. That's why research into different storage technologies is important, in my opinion. I personally see the most potential for a hydrogen-based energy system. 

Solar and wind are only comparatively costly (and even that is dropping fast) because incumbent technologies can offload environmental costs on society. If those costs would be properly accounted for, solar and wind are be far cheaper in comparison."

> Let me summarize how the key issues appear to me, a working scientist with a better background than most in the physics of climate. CO2 really is a greenhouse gas and other things being equal, adding the gas to the atmosphere by burning coal, oil, and natural gas will modestly increase the surface temperature of the earth. Other things being equal, doubling the CO2 concentration, from our current 390 ppm to 780 ppm will directly cause about 1 degree Celsius in warming. At the current rate of CO2 increase in the atmosphere—about 2 ppm per year—it would take about 195 years to achieve this doubling. The combination of a slightly warmer earth and more CO2 will greatly increase the production of food, wood, fiber, and other products by green plants, so the increase will be good for the planet, and will easily outweigh any negative effects. Supposed calamities like the accelerated rise of sea level, ocean acidification, more extreme climate, tropical diseases near the poles, and so on are greatly exaggerated"

And yet 42 million people in 2010 alone were forced to move in Asia and the Pacific region. 90% were due to climate related hazards and the number of natural disasters (floods, storms, etc) had doubled on the last reported period. [source](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301165512/http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CFA06/(httpPublications)/D558B66C3B055DE0C12578A7002C0FE1?OpenDocument)

Is the 50 million in a decade quoted in your article really that hard to believe?

>massive vegetation growth within previously arid and barren regions

Are we going to ignore the fact that climate change is a **global** phenomena? It even says in your article ""*The **rare** positive effect of climate change...*"". One positive does not outweigh the global negatives.

It also says in your linked article, ""*Professor Sutton cautioned that the **change in rainfall was only local** and that many parts of Africa faced problems from global warming, including heatwaves, desertification, floods, rising sea levels and an increase in malaria. “It would be naive to conclude that this is a good thing for Africa,” he said.*""

>better food production

Your linked article says SFA in the abstract about that. It is talking about measuring forestry. 

Assuming the claim is made behind the paywall it is still bogus. We are still emitting CO2 faster than plants increased their intake and plants can only take in CO2 if we don't clear all the forests.

[source](https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2016/11/08/atmospheric-co2-pause/)

>steady decline in temperature

Fucking what? It says **in the article you linked** (page 43) why they believe there is variance. 

>There is medium confidence that this difference between models and observations is to a substantial degree caused by natural internal climate variability, which sometimes enhances and sometimes counteracts the long-term externally forced warming trend

And from the following paragraph:

>For the longer period from 1951 to 2012, simulated surface warming trends are consistent with the observed trend (very high confidence)

Way to cherry pick. The article you linked was literally analysing 100's of models and saying they were accurate in the longer term.

>1930-1970 has seen a steady decline

Sulphate aerosols. They reflect sunlight and don't remain in the atmosphere for long relative to greenhouse gases. They come from volcanic eruptions and humans. We had clean air acts put in place (US - 1972; UK - 1956). Google it.

As for your final claim - Happer has no formal climate science training. Meanwhile you are listening to the fossil fuel lobby instead of the science. The irony would be amusing if people like you weren't spreading misinformation and others actually believing it. I suppose you probably think cigarettes don't cause cancer because some doctor's said they smoke Camels?

**Science adjusts its view when evidence is shown to the contrary** literally by design. It is called the scientific method.

There is nothing better than results from a study that contradicts existing evidence. It attracts funding and attention for both publishers, universities and scientists. The fact that over 97% of scientists can agree on anything *globally* is a statistical anomaly as far as science goes."

Pubelication,fe37d2u,t1_fe0td3t,"> Over 90 per cent climate‐related
The number of natural disasters reported has doubled from around 200 to over 400 a year over the past two decades. In 2010, over 90 per cent of disaster displacement within countries was caused by climate‐related hazards, primarily floods and storms.
“The intensity and frequency of extreme weather events is increasing, and this trend is only set to continue. With all probability, the number of those affected and displaced will rise as human‐ induced climate change comes into full force”, said Rasmusson. “The humanitarian community will have to be better prepared to respond to large‐scale natural disasters and the displacement that follows. The way that the international response system is set up today, we cannot do so adequately”.

10 years later, we know that there is no increase in extreme weather. If there was, there would be rising numbers of displaced people.

Yes, there have been catastrophes in the past 20 years like the 2004 tsunami that mostly hit developing countries, but there is no trend in them happening."

10. The Paris summit will come up with a result: a binding treaty that will change the world

Unlikely. China, already responsible for 50 per cent of all the world’s CO2 emissions, has made clear that it now plans to double them within 15 years. India, the third largest emitter, insists that it will treble its CO2 output by 2030.

The story from most of the other major “developing countries”, such as Russia, Brazil, South Korea and Vietnam, is much the same. Not one of them has any intention of reducing its “carbon emissions”.

The best they can offer is that, if Western countries want them to build more windmills and solar farms, we must be prepared to pay them to do so out of a “Green Climate Fund”, which the UN plans by 2020 to be handing out $100 billion a year. Pledges so far amount to just $700 million. We still have $99.3 billion to go.

somethingrather,fe61pkz,t1_fe2junb,"I share your skepticism over global players to adhere to it, but that won't stop me trying to understand it.

With respect to that telegraph article you posted - I won't go point by point, but a lot of what he points out as untrue has subsequently (in the 5 years) proven to be true or is just a crock of crap.

Some examples:

* 2 - models missed the ""Pause""

Models improve with technology and more data. So what if they missed the pause happening? 

Models now are more accurate than ever and will still likely miss some events happening. It doesn't mean it isn't worth looking at. Otherwise we might as well fire all weather forecasters and let everyone fend for themselves with no warning the next time a hurricane hits.

* 5 - Melting Polar Ice

Record ice cover for Antartica in 2014 is true. It also subsequently hit record low in 2017.

Arctic - same thing. Smallest ice extent levels in 2019.


* 6 - Global Sea levels

Kiribati does not disprove anything. Also [a followup study in 2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11625-013-0210-z) found that Kiribati has increased in size.

>Reef islands have substantially increased in size, gaining about 450 ha, driven largely by reclamations on urban South Tarawa, accounting for 360 ha (~80 % of the net change)

The remaining 20% was found to be likely natural cyclic variance.

Water is not distributed evenly across Earth due to currents, gravity and the atmosphere. That is why we measure it globally and globally it has risen. 

* 9 - Renewables aren't worth it

Wrong. Renewables worldwide are proving to be cheaper even in countries with plenty of coal like Australia.

Point 8 is the one I think is fair. [Some research suggests fewer, but stronger hurricanes](https://www.c2es.org/content/hurricanes-and-climate-change/), but it is far from evidence-backed research at this point. Point 7 is also somewhat fair, but it isn't evidence against climate change. It is just absence of evidence because we don't have data of extreme weather events going back more than 150 years or so."

This seemed like people here are untrusting of you. Perhaps it was a combination of your responses, how you introduced your ideas, or maybe the lack of research or proof? I am unsure but those are some of the concerns it seems people have. If you do really care then I'm sure you'll keep going forward even though this AMA was... unfortunate. Hopefully I'll hear more about you guys in the coming future."
BlueStoneArt,fe2gvjj,t1_fdzvdmz,"I was the first person to their AMA.  When they opened it, it was simply a headline and a link to their website. Nothing else.

I put in a request for more proof than a web link. I did state that just providing a link appeared to be to drive traffic to their website, which they later verified. They need the web traffic and for visitors to register, so that they can take the pings and registration to investors and show that there is interest in their idea and gain access to VC.

So, they fixed their now 'broken' link, and added a picture.  Over the course of the day they have expanded greatly on their introduction, adding and subtracting things throughout.

Rather quickly, industry professionals, investment professional and others appeared (solar energy is a hot topic and would attract these people) and started asking questions. Soft ones first, then harder ones.

It quickly became apparent that this team of young people do not have any firm plans and have not thought this out very well. What they have is an ""idea"".

Originally they said they had all quit their jobs. Now it's they are prepared  to, and that their data engineer works part time on the things they need to prepare with.

One of them came up with the idea of a Reddit AMA to drive traffic to the website, generate pings and ask people to register, so they can have proof of interest in their idea.

Except as the questions came, it was really clear that they have zero plan for an actual business. It is still an idea. First they were asking for Kickstarter type funding. Then they progressed to ""we aren't asking for money"". Then it was ""visit our site, register, and we will put you on a wait list to let you know when we file our SEC forms"". 

They literally have no business.

So, it's not so much a 'brigade' as it was making it really clear through their non-answers, evasion, constantly changing information and all that this was the equivalent of a Ponzi scheme and it was unraveling all around them.

Then they vacated the AMA to regroup and return.

Now that they are gone, people are still arriving and making snide remarks about how it went. They weren't here to witness it. They see the fallout and are pointing fingers at the people who were questioning what they are doing and why would someone invest (which they were asking at that point). Instead, they should be looking at why some guys would show up and use us to generate web traffic and registration so they can go to VC and ask for money, and still not answer a single hard question.

It was an interesting experience and I feel for the guys, but it really shows how you need to be PREPARED.  If they went into a VC firm to see someone with millions to offer, they would have been shown the door in five minutes.  They literally had nothing but a mouthful of buzzwords that would get a pink haired Portland barista all excited, but would snap the VC wallets shut faster than you can say ""Go away!""

Woefully unprepared."

BFWookie80,fe0bbia,t3_endtv4,"Hi, have you heard of SunExchange (thesunexchange.com)?

I'm not sure if this has been mentioned in the comments but they are a company that is already doing this exact thing which you should check out for inspiration or collaboration.

They use crowd funds as capital to pay for the solar installation on a large roof of buildings like schools, retirement homes and shopping centres. The roof owner signs a 20 year contract to buy electricity from SunExchange and in return they pay out monthly to the crowd of owners who paid for the solar for that entire contractor. People can buy 1 solar cell at a time for about $2 and you can buy as many as there are available for that project. They sell out pretty quick, within a month.

Projects come up every few months so check out the site for the next crowd sale. You can buy cells with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and can also earn payouts on Bitcoin and anyone in the world can partake and have already.

It's a UK based company but all of their projects so far have been in Africa, mostly South Africa, which is current on a grip of an electricity crisis and needs all the help they can get.

SunExchange has also recently gone public on a South African Stock Exchange and so with all the money they raised will soon grow bigger with more projects. 

This project works! I've bought cells over a long period now and have reliably recieved payouts. I like the fact that they target places like schools and that it increases the decentralization of power. 

I highly recommend that the OP check them out and maybe build a relationship in order to collaborate. No need to compete, we all have the same goal."
okapidaddy,fe1lmfq,t3_endtv4,"Hey guys... Hope you can answer a very tough question. 

Electricity accounts for about 28% of global emissions (IEA 2020). Demand is projected to increase, even under scenarios where aggressive renewables are included. Developing countries, for the main example, are intensifying demand for single family homes, lighting, internet, air conditioning, cars, gadgets, and basic goods and services that the west currently enjoys. Demand for energy, infrastructure, goods, and services is increasing by all measures. Young people in developing countries want - and will get - western lifestyles. Country leaders want western lifestyles. Donors and MDBs are dumping billions annually to assist countries develop into the western style. Economic growth (including health, education, and mobility of people) is fundamentally intertwined with intensive emissions. Demand is just not going down in any scenario. Seriously. There are zero reasonable, realistic scenarios where demand decreases. 

And that's just 30% of emissions. The other 70% is from food, industry, vehicles, land use, etc. Demand for these is also projected to increase, again even under best realistic scenarios. As domestic demand rises, demand across these sectors will increase exponentially.

So, brass tacks guys. Do you think you are well informed on the impact your work could actually achieve? Impact from your work is equivalent to a tear drop in the rain. Second, are in this for the money? 

Would love to hear how you view impact and how you'll address hypocrisy in your plans. 

Thanks... AP"
BlueStoneArt,fe2i665,t1_fe1lmfq,"They can't. Sorry.

I've been here off and on all day. They either cannot or will not answer tough questions. Pretty much all they've offered are mouthfuls of buzzwords, but no hard facts.

Im pretty sure they have an idea and that's it. No real business. Just an idea. And that they know little to nothing about the actual business. Their grasp on financials and start ups seems to be thin. Even the industry knowledge seems vague at best. 

Hence, an idea.

They are very young and bright young people with ideas are valuable. But they need to have skills, knowledge and be prepared.

Also, where will your projects be and do you foresee congestion issues? Does renewable energy production have merit order advantages in the US? 

For some context, in some areas here in the Netherlands, solar projects are getting into trouble with securing a connection to the distribution grids because production during hours of peak irradiance may cause the grid to become congested. New legislation is being drawn up to implement congestion management on a distribution net scale, not only transport net scale.

jeo170395,fe2z17l,t3_endtv4,"One serious concern which is often overlooked is SF6  release into the atmosphere. SF6 is the most potent greenhouse gas there is with 1 tonne of SF6 having the same warming potential of 22000 Tonnes of CO2. It is used as the dielectric medium in electrical switchgear and the amount currently estimated to be escaping into the atmosphere in the UK alone is the equivalent of 1.3 million more cars on the road.

This is a serious issue which significantly contributes to global warming and it seems to be forgotten about. This could be a serious flaw in the plan to electrify cars (and a lot of other things) as the extra demand for electricity wil undoubtedly lead to an increase in sf6 emissions. Having lots of smaller generation plants (such as solar farms) will also increase the number of required switchgear components. If moving to renewables is to pay off for the environment we need to find an alternative product/ method of arc suppression in switch gear.

Do you agree this is an issue and how do you propose you and the rest of the energy industry should tackle this problem?

If we can pipeline oil, why can we not do so with water?

I'm an environmental science major. 

And I think that we would be able to take excess flood water from the midwest and pump it to the west coast for California.  They are in a man made draught, as you may know. 

And seeing as the midwest has excess water most years, it would make sense. 

What would ideally make this work is by having pump stations throughout to keep the water flowing. 
And I also know that by pumping water up high, then lettng gravity do the work, you can have a roughly 80% recapture of the energy used to do so. And if this was done the length of the pipeline,  I imagine not only could we move and pump the water, but also produce jobs and electricity in the process. 

Do you think something like that would be plausible?"
Terra2Official,fe3xbkg,t1_fe3hwii,"That’s interesting!! Aqueducts exist in California but I am not sure if they come from Midwest. I think it’s really interesting that you pointed out that the kinetic energy, or release of potential, when the water goes downhill can be capture.

I have spent the past few decades trying to answer one very big question: What happens when the Americans get tired of maintaining the international system, pack up and head home? That work led me to assemble my new book, Disunited Nations: The Scramble for Power in an Ungoverned World. I'm here to answer your questions. 

So AMA about my work in geopolitics. There is no corner of the world – geographically or economically – that I’ve not done at least some work. So bring it on: India, Russia, Argentina, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Sweden, Thailand, demographics, nuclear weapons, hypersonics, hacking, drones, oil, solar, banking, assembly lines, dairy, pickles (seriously, I’ve given a presentation on pickles) and on and on. I do about 100 presentations a year, and every presentation forces me to relearn the world from a new point of view so that I can then help my audience see what is in their future.

However, there are a few things I do not do. I don't pick sides in political squabbles or make policy recommendations or recommend stock picks. I provide context. I play forward the outcomes of choices. I help people, companies and governing institutions make informed decisions. What is done with that is up to the audience. Right now, that’s you.

That said, I would love for someone to stump me today – it’s how I get better. =]

All credible sources (such as the World Bank) state that Greece has recently been importing around 61% to 64% of its energy, while also exporting some. I have not been able to find a source for your figure of food imports either. However, an 80% figure wouldn’t be that important since many developed countries, such as the U.K., have a similar percentage. Additionally, Greece does export a considerable amount of food and its agricultural sector is actually considered unusually large for European standards (check European Commission figures).

The next sentences contain wild and dismissive perspectives on history which sound awfully a lot like propaganda. Your opinions are exceptionally shocking considering that all U.S. and E.U. education systems that I have been exposed to teach history in a much different light, usually focusing on the harm imperialist powers have done to smaller nations.

Yes Greece imports a lot of its food, however this has more to do with consumer behaviour and inefficiencies in the agricultural sector than it does with any actual production capability.

The biggest issue is that the things the Latam states export – energy and food specifically – have their prices determined by international norms.

mappyboy,fdhrr6b,t3_elgcxp,"Peter,

I enjoyed your Book the Absent Superpower, and I must confess that in the past few years, more than once, I've felt current events were following eerily close to your general thesis. However, time and time again, I can't help but feel as though you're actively discounting the CCP and China's capabilities. Many authors have predicted China's economic collapse for nearly two decades now. Why is it going *actually* happen now?

As an electrical engineer, I have been utterly dumbfounded by the pace of which the Chinese have been innovating and moving up the value chain as they provide unique value offerings that can be very compelling. From a technology-focused lens, I would suggest that we, that is, humanity, are on the precipice of a new AI-powered industrial revolution, which will usher in far higher productivity and economic efficiencies than before. The CCP is positioning itself to be a leader in this. Yes, the Chinese economy has numerous glaring weaknesses and bubbles, but technological breakthroughs could allow them to escape and push past those troubles.

One good example are chips. While the US still does lead in chips, the Chinese are rapidly catching up. Now it is true that the CCP has spent billions to no significant success in trying to establish its domestic chip production since the early 2000's.  But for most of that time frame, US and other Western chip firms were providing customers products that were growing exponentially in computational power. Today that growth has severely slowed. Furthermore, designing and producing state of the art chips is more expensive than ever. 7nm chips cost around $270 million to develop. The fab generation before that was $80 million and the one before that was $30. We are rapidly reaching plateaus just as the CCP is redoubling it's efforts and pouring billions more, buying out entire Chip design teams, and getting assured access to architectures, which may end up being even more powerful. The cost of continued innovation is exploding right as China is doing everything to catch up.

Why are you so certain that the Chinese will stall out and not be able to catch up and compete as a peer power?"

aklbos,fdjkcqe,t1_fdhrr6b,"It’s worth bearing in mind that every year of economic growth is harder for China. All the low hanging fruit is gone. It’s true that some people have predicted the collapse of the CCP for a long time and it hasn’t yet happened, but if it happens next year, or the year after that, then they were right. They’re not wrong yet.

Most experts have always pointed to the CCP being relatively secure until growth slows down. After that, the game gets harder for them. Guess what? Growth is slowing down. And it’s not because of a trade war or tariffs. It’s simply because the economic reality is that there are diminishing returns to growth after a certain level of super-fast “catchup” development.

Point is, this story isn’t anywhere near over yet.

Beyond all that, in the next 10-30 years, by far the biggest problem facing China is demographics. They say demography is destiny, and in the case of China, the bizarre 1-Child Policy experiment is their destiny, and it’s not going to be pretty."

FantaToTheKnees,fdju2py,t1_fdhx0du,"Our usual answer when GGS gets mentioned: 

It looks like you are talking about the book *Guns, Germs, and Steel* by *Jared Diamond*.

The book over the past years has become rather popular, which is hardly surprising since it is a good and entertaining read. It has reached the point that for some people it has sort of reached the status of gospel. On /r/history we noticed a trend where every time a question was asked that has even the slightest relation to the book a dozen or so people would jump in and recommend the book.  Which in the context of history is a bit problematic and the reason this reply was written. 

Why it is problematic can be broken down into two reasons: 

1. In academic history there isn't such thing as one definitive authority or work on things. There are often others who research the same subjects and people that dive into work of others to build on it or to see if it indeed holds up. This being critical of your sources and not relying on one source is actually a very important skill in studying history often lacking when dozens of people just spam the same work over and over again as a definite guide and answer to ""everything"".  
2. There are a good amount of modern historians and anthropologists who are quite critical of *Guns, Germs, and Steel* and there are some very real issues with Diamond's work. These issues are often overlooked or not noticed by the people reading his book. Which is understandable, given the fact that for many it will be their first exposure to the subject. Considering the popularity of the book it is also the reason that we felt it was needed to create this response. 

In an ideal world, every time the book was posted in /r/history, it would be accompanied by critical notes and other works covering the same subject. Lacking that a dozen other people would quickly respond and do the same. But simply put, that isn't always going to happen and as a result, we have created this response so people can be made aware of these things. Does this mean that the /r/history mods hate the book or Diamond himself? No, if that was the case, we would simply instruct the bot to remove every mention of it. This is just an attempt to bring some balance to a conversation that in popular history had become a bit unbalanced. It should also be noted that being critical of someone's work isn't the same as outright dismissing it. Historians are always critical of any work they examine, that is part of their core skill set and key in doing good research. 

Below you'll find a list of other works covering much of the same subject. Further below you'll find an explanation of why many historians and anthropologists are critical of Diamonds work.

## Criticism of *Guns, Germs, and Steel*

Many historians and anthropologists believe Diamond plays fast and loose with history by generalizing highly complex topics to provide an ecological/geographical determinist view of human history. There is a reason historians avoid grand theories of human history: those [""just so stories""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story) don't adequately explain human history. It's true however that it is an entertaining introductory text that forces people to look at world history from a different vantage point. That being said, Diamond writes a rather oversimplified narrative that seemingly ignores the human element of history.


**Cherry-picked data while ignoring the complexity of issues**  

In his chapter ""Lethal Gift of Livestock"" on the origin of human crowd infections he picks 5 pathogens that best support his idea of domestic origins. However, when diving into the genetic and historic data, only two pathogens (maybe influenza and most likely measles) could possibly have jumped to humans through domestication. The majority were already a part of the human disease load before the origin of agriculture, domestication, and sedentary population centers. This is an example of Diamond ignoring the evidence that didn't support his theory to explain conquest via disease spread to immunologically naive Native Americas. 
          
A similar case of cherry-picking history is seen when discussing the conquest of the Inca.

> Pizarro's military advantages lay in the Spaniards' steel swords and other weapons, steel armor, guns, and horses... Such imbalances of equipment were decisive in innumerable other confrontations of Europeans with Native Americans and other peoples. The sole Native Americans able to resist European conquest for many centuries were those tribes that reduced the military disparity by acquiring and mastering both guns and horses.

This is a very broad generalization that effectively makes it false. Conquest was not a simple matter of conquering a people, raising a Spanish flag, and calling ""game over."" Conquest was a constant process of negotiation, accommodation, and rebellion played out through the ebbs and flows of power over the course of centuries. Some Yucatan Maya city-states maintained independence for two hundred years after contact, were ""conquered"", and then immediately rebelled again. The Pueblos along the Rio Grande revolted in 1680, dislodged the Spanish for a decade, and instigated unrest that threatened the survival of the entire northern edge of the empire for decades to come. Technological ""advantage"", in this case guns and steel, did not automatically equate to battlefield success in the face of resistance, rough terrain and vastly superior numbers. The story was far more nuanced, and conquest was never a cut and dry issue, which in the book is not really touched upon. In the book it seems to be case of the Inka being conquered when Pizarro says they were conquered.

**Uncritical examining of the historical record surrounding conquest**  
        
Being critical of the sources you come across and being aware of their context, biases and agendas is a core skill of any historian. 

Pizarro, Cortez and other conquistadores were biased authors who wrote for the sole purpose of supporting/justifying their claim on the territory, riches and peoples they subdued. To do so they elaborated their own sufferings, bravery, and outstanding deeds, while minimizing the work of native allies, pure dumb luck, and good timing. If you only read their accounts you walk away thinking a handful of adventurers conquered an empire thanks to guns and steel and a smattering of germs. No historian in the last half century would be so naive to argue this generalized view of conquest, but European technological supremacy is one keystone to Diamond's thesis so he presents conquest at the hands of a handful of adventurers.

**The construction of the arguments for *GG&S* paints Native Americans specifically, and the colonized world in general, as categorically one step behind**. 

To believe the narrative you need to view Native Americans as somehow naive, unable to understand Spanish motivations and desires, unable react to new weapons/military tactics, unwilling to accommodate to a changing political landscape, incapable of mounting resistance once conquered, too stupid to invent the key technological advances used against them, and doomed to die because they failed to build cities, domesticate animals and thereby acquire infectious organisms. This while they did often did fare much better than the book (and the sources it tends to cite) suggest, they often did mount successful resistance, were quick to adapt to new military technologies, build sprawling citiest and much more. When viewed through this lens, we hope you can see why so many historians and anthropologists are livid that a popular writer is perpetuating a false interpretation of history while minimizing the agency of entire continents full of people.

Tsegen,fdi9ays,t1_fdi150e,"Going further can be harder. Not all people are as good at writing as laymen-friendly authors (or laymen themselves) like Diamond and Carlin. And their works are often far more focused on a particular period and more skittish about making broad, all-encompassing claims.


A lot of historians deliberately resist that sort of grand narrative work because it's too broad. If you're an expert on Roman history you don't want to go too far out of your specialty y'know? A specialist on Mayan civilization may utterly wreck you for not understanding the nuance- that takes a lifetime of study to learn.

Grand narratives about the shape of human civilization are very hard to do and are often distrusted. But popular writers are more willing to play in this sandbox (someone like Carlin has no professorship to jeopardize).

So you end up with laymen preferring the person who will give them an interesting story, rather than the guy who comes and throws water on it by exclaiming how hard it is to answer these questions."

PeterZeihan,fdhpeyg,t1_fdhmvcf,"Highly likely – three thoughts:
1)	Mexico is the US’ largest trading partner and will remain so for at least the rest of this century. Texas is the state that has benefited from this the most, but as big and populous as Texas is, Texas is insufficient to the task and so has de facto drafted Oklahoma into a sort of Greater Texas manufacturing hub. I expect that zone to creep north along the I35 corridor and absorb parts of the Midwest
2)	If the US can get rid of the Jones Act (a 1920s law that criminalizes the shipping of any cargo between any two US ports on any vessel that is not American owned, crewed, captained and registered) then the waterways can be used for manufacturing supply chains. That would massively/disproportionally benefit the Midwest.
3)	A mindset shift is required. The Midwest has a very if-we-build-it-they-will-come mentality. The idea being that we are honest and hardworking so who wouldn’t want to invest here? That’s not how the world works. You need to advertise and engaged in outreach. Texans do it by making friends with Mexicans. Southerners do it by brining bourbon to potential investors. New Yorkers and Californians by writing checks. The Midwest needs a bit of a cultural reinvention to take advantage of a very advantageous confluence of factors that should benefit the US hugely."

### National security[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Merchant_Marine_Act_of_1920&action=edit&section=9)]

One of the primary impetuses for the law was the situation that occurred during World War I when the belligerent countries withdrew their merchant fleets from commercial service to aid in the war effort. This left the US with insufficient vessels to conduct normal trade impacting the economy. Later when the U.S. joined the war there were insufficient vessels to transport war supplies, materials, and ultimately soldiers to Europe resulting in the creation of the [United States Shipping Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Shipping_Board). The U.S. engaged in a massive ship building effort including building [concrete ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_ship) to make up for the lack of U.S. tonnage. The Jones Act was passed in order to prevent the U.S. from having insufficient maritime capacity in future wars.

A 2011 study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found there are approximately 5 million maritime crew entries into the United States each year, and ""the overwhelming majority of seafarers entering U.S. ports are aliens."" The study also showed that 80% of those seafarer aliens are working on passenger ships that are covered by the [Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_Vessel_Services_Act_of_1886) rather than the Jones Act.[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_Marine_Act_of_1920#cite_note-ReferenceA-52) The GAO said that while there are no known examples of foreign seafarer involvement in terrorist attacks and no definitive evidence of extremists infiltrating the United States on seafarer visas, ""the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) considers the illegal entry of an alien through a U.S. seaport by exploitation of maritime industry practices to be a key concern.""[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_Marine_Act_of_1920#cite_note-ReferenceA-52)"

The US population is about 70% in favor of more immigration right now, a time of supposed chaos. In the future, that could spike and the US in my opinion could see 50 million people added each decade from increased immigration in the 2030s  2040s and 2050s. 

Demographically, the Millennials and Gen Z will take over the working population, and having a higher population cohort, naturally the growth rate *should* increase to 3% a year. But if you’re growing 2-3% each year in a time of increased global chaos that is still incredible.

drlcartman,fdhn9rx,t3_elgcxp,"I saw in an interview recently that you do not expect Russia to last the 21st century, maybe not even to 2050. I believe that may be a little optimistic. Looking at all the leaders of Russia since Peter the Great, the average reign is 14 years, with death of said leader being 54 (if you exclude the two children, it rises to 15 years of reign and 58 years at the age of death. I’ve also excluded the three alive for age of death (Gorbachev (89), Putin, and Medvedev (55)). Putin is currently in his 16th year as ruler (20 if you want to count his time as PM) and is 68 years old. He is above the average for years ruled and the age of a Russian Ruler.

If Putin dies or is overthrown (I doubt he will leave willingly or retire) before Russia secures its borders to adequately account for its declining demography, whose in line to attempt to secure it? The defense and intelligent camp I believe don’t trust Medvedev. There really isn’t anyone in the wings ready to step up, because if there was, I believe Putin would have had them eliminated a while ago due to the possible threat.

If Russia faces a leadership crisis along with a geopolitical crisis, wouldn’t that be game over for the Russian Federation? If Russia implodes, will we see a repeat of the Balkans, except with nuclear weapons at the belligerent’s disposal? Do the major nuclear powers have any plans for securing another’s nuclear weapons if said country implodes? This was an issue after the collapse of the USSR, and Ukraine gave up the nukes in exchange for security guarantees for Crimea. I don’t think we’ll see anyone willingly give up nukes for a promise ever again.

TLDR: In sum- If Putin goes away before securing Russia’s geopolitical needs, will a political crisis prevent Russia from securing its borders, and potentially seeing the collapse of the Russian State as we saw in Yugoslavia in the 90s?"
Rukenau,fdia7bj,t1_fdhn9rx,"May I chime in as a Russian?

I think this talk of Russia imploding is rather overblown, and the reason is really quite simple—these new hypothetical mini-states would need to coalesce around something. I mean, if you're weak, your extremities still don't just start falling off randomly, do they? And so the question is, what exactly would that something be? And, while we're at it; why exactly didn't Russia further implode in the early 1990s when her coffers were empty, her leadership fairly inept, and the centrifugal inertia from the breakdown of the USSR still very strong?

The answer is simple: None of the subordinate territories of the Russian Federation have a culture or an identity sufficiently different, or an economy sufficiently independent, from that of the centre—let's say Central Russia for simplicity, Moscow—to warrant secession, either peaceful or through a civil war. There's simply nothing to be gained, and quite a bit to be lost.

A war with neighbours? That is possible for a weakened Russia; but again, you have to consider whom with. China seems to have preferred, throughout centuries, to expand peacefully. Europe... eh, I think wars of the Old World with Russia have fallen rather out of vogue over the past century, although one can never be too sure. Something creeping up from the Middle East? A possibility, but also, I would say, a remote one.

As for Putin's successor, I think [Sergey Kirienko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Kiriyenko) is one possible option.

These are just some thoughts off the top of my head, though.

Edit. Thanks for the silver! Much obliged."
writerofenglish,fdi8f89,t1_fdhn9rx,"Also, what does Russia do after oil and gas? Its economic growth is anaemic even now and it seems to have no plans to survive the sustainable era. Ditto with a lot of ME countries.

murinal76,fdje1kt,t1_fdhn9rx,"Another Russian chiming in. This prediction is wishful and has no bearing on reality, it is the classical example of not seeing a whole country behind its leader, and simply assuming that Putin == Russia. I would also add that there is no shortage of individuals who could take up the presidential post; literally any party leader or the governor of an existing oblast could qualify, for starters.

>(I doubt he will leave willingly or retire)

Putin has announced that he will leave at the end of his current term and announce a successor. There is every reason to believe this is the case as Putin simply cannot run for office again due to his age, and the fact that he already has two consecutive terms. He will likely remain somewhere in the political background after 2024, with political influence of his own and the ears of many politicians, but there will be another president.

The only significant long-term threat facing Russia is a potential drop in population and working-age population, but it is nowhere near as extreme that Russia could stop existing by the year 2050, or even the year 2100. Such matters are greatly offset by immigration from former Soviet republics, breakthoughs in healthcare, as well as the increase in automation which results in less demands for a large workforce and greater demands for a highly skilled workforce (something Russia has relatively plenty of).

Plus, as many other users have already stated, there is literally no reason for Russia to collapse no matter what happens. Unlike the USSR, Russia is more or less an ethnic and cultural monolith, with the exception of Chechnya and a few other minority republics, some of which simply can't survive on their own and many others of which are culturally assimilated to a large degree."

However, other minority subject populations are growing. In other words, Russia is running out of ethnic Russians to police potentially separatist groups (Chechens, etc). Personally I think the Chechens want out. This reduced military capability comes when Russia’s borders are far longer than the USSR’s...which means defending the frontier much harder. Also their technical education system collapsed after the USSR fell. Russia’s future will be an uphill battle."
drlcartman,fdicewj,t1_fdia7bj,"Well, it almost did, but for the success of the Chechen Wars and Clinton support of Yeltsin in the 90s.

The fact of the matter is there is a large ethnic minority that could break away, which would cause the implosion: the Tartars. They’re highly educated, highly skilled in petroleum engineering, and, while secular, Islamic rather than orthodox christian. The Russian empire’s foundation was laid with the conquering of the Khazan, and other Tartars people from the Golden Horde. Crack that foundation, the whole house falls down.

If the Chechens and other islamists in southern Russia start getting a little steam toward independence through a third chechen war, and there will be a third chechen war post-Putin, you will see a stirring of the non-Russians in Russia start to question their place in the country. 

The Tartars have a ton in common with Turkey, being fellow turks. Turkey could start to supply weapons and training to future rebels. Russia had a hard time quelling the Chechens, they’re not going to be able to subdue the Chechens, and the other islamic minorities in the Caucuses, and the Tartars, and that without the rebels being supplied by a great power.

You’ll see a break of the Tartars and southern russia, which will lead to a greater breakdown of the country. Moscow will be broke and unable to muster the forces to stop them from breaking away."

And the rather racially-charged concept that there are many potentially separatist regions that need to be policed necessarily by Russians is, I think, more than a bit misguided... Chechnya may have been one such case, but even that is no longer at the top of the agenda. I have been to Chechnya, and I have Chechen friends and acquaintances; and frankly—they are all right, and in no hurry to secede... because money, and lots of it. There's major unhappiness amongst Russians, of course, that Chechnya seems to be a money sink, but deep down, I think, everybody understands that it is better to pave the streets of Grozny with dollars than with bodies of our men."
Rukenau,fdiekes,t1_fdicewj,"This is certainly *a* scenario... how plausible is another question.

Why would Tartars wish to break away? They got all the independence they could carry away in the nineties. Their economy is entirely and inextricably intertwined with that of the rest of Russia. What do they stand to gain? They are far more secular even than today's Turkey; what for would they fight?

Why would Chechnya want to fight Russia again? They get all the money in the world for, well, just being a part of the country and not causing any ruckus. National pride? They are a law unto themselves anyway.

In other words, this just goes to reaffirm my original point. I don't see any nuclei around which new states might emerge. Hell, I'd have easier time believing in the secession of Texas than Tatarstan. Chechnya yes, although a far-fetched possibility, it is still imaginable... but also, I think, you have to remember that this time it wouldn't be the emaciated dirt-poor Russia trying to bring them back into the fold—it would be the second most powerful military in the world.

Danbukhari,fdhnqcc,t3_elgcxp,One of your central theories (Probably THE central theory) is the ongoing end of the post WWII global order since the US is no longer interested in maintaining it in the aftermath of the cold war.

That said, the US doesn’t need that if the goal is to smash China. China’s finances are a mess because of its Enron-style banking model, its population is nearly terminal because of OneChild, its regions hate one another (and I’m not talking Hong Kong). But most importantly it is bolted to the global Order. China’s economy cannot survive without imported inputs and exported processed/finished goods. That’s only possible with a safe, globalized economy. The world has only had a safe, globalized economy under the global Order.

I don't buy into the idea that a global naval superpower is needed to make ocean trade flow.

Securing sea lanes from pirates doesn't seem to be as big an issue as you may put it, since not much of modern naval expenditure is put towards that purpose. To bust pirates, one best uses smaller patrol ships, not nuclear subs and aircraft carriers

If the issue is securing sea lanes against other states, again the issue seems to me to be overblown. Sure China may not be able to stop some mideast nation from choking off Hormuz for a few months, but such short-term disruptions are not something that would wipe out the pattern of global trade flows. After all, the *whole OPEC* staged a half-year-long embargo, yet they didn't wipe out the idea of global trade, not at all! Causing a short-term recession for oil importers doesn't equate to rewriting global trade in the long-run. Meanwhile, it is hard to imagine Egypt wanting to choke off Suez in the long run (1/4 of its foreign exchange earnings), nor for any country to choke off the Straits of Malacca (nobody other than the US would be able to do that anyway)

In any case, China wouldn't be the one desperate to sustain trade, since China is one of the *least* reliant on trade, as would be expected of a large nation. Your analysis may seem more convincing in the heyday of 2007, but since then China's trade exposure declined (while global trade exposure to China increased, an interesting combination). This pattern of ""others are exposed to us, we are not so exposed to them"" slowly resembles the US more, as expected due to the characteristics of China: The least trade-exposed nations are large in economy, land or both - including US, Japan, Brazil and China today.

Thus, even if it were truly necessary to have some big naval presence to make trade flow (which I disagree), every one of China's neighbours (other than Japan) would be scrambling to combine their forces with China to make it work, because every one of their neighbours except Japan is at least twice as exposed to trade as China is. Even Japan needs food and fuel. Any pirate/smaller nation that tries to choke off trade will be ganged against by the maritime nations of East and Southeast Asia. And that's assuming it is possible to choke it off in the first place - Malacca is not Suez, and there are many longer alternate paths around it. 

Will a US naval pullout increase shipping costs? Absolutely due to insurance cost. But that won't collapse global trade, not in my view.

Hope for your reply and I'm glad to see an AMA of someone like yourself!"
pandafartsbakery,fdj7l1d,t1_fdhr1l7,"I think what these numbers fail to realize is that China's long term goal is to continue urbanization.

China still hopes to pull an additional 200-300 million people out of rural areas.

These are poor areas where worker productivity is low.

This means that China isn't looking to replace all their entire aging population with young people, it aims to replace the most productive urban portion with young people who will be on average more productive.

If China can weather the aging demographic shock of the next 15 years, it will have an urbanized, ""right sized"" (though not as populous) demographic that domestic agricultural and other natural resources can support."

Every problem China faces – financial, cultural, political, demographic, international – has become far more serious since Accidental’s publish five years ago. Most of the problems have become worse because of government policy. I’ve lost confidence in Beijing’s ability to manage the country’s future. Much of this is because of Xi personally. He’s concentrated more power unto himself than any Chinese leader in history, Mao included. That has streamlined decisionmaking, but started China back on the path to groupthink, inefficiency, and regional rebellion. 

HongKong is a great example. It didn’t need to get this bad. I’m not saying HK will achieve independence (or even autonomy) but that Xi’s forcing of the issue is wrecking China’s premeior managerial, financial and logistics hub (i.e. part of what makes contemporary China work) and it was a completely avoidable crisis.

My take is that the lesson of the Soviet Union's fall, and the manner in which its peripheral regions broke away in secession, weigh heavily in how the CCP sees its own peripheral regions such as Xinjiang since.

anupsetafternoon,fdi0uw6,t1_fdhogea,how do you explain 5g then?
anupsetafternoon,fdi19bx,t1_fdhogea," **“Learning by Doing”—the Ultimate Source of Technology Innovation**

This explanation of China’s unstoppable rise in manufacturing is a response to the institutional theorists and many commentators on China. They may question China’s ability to innovate once it moves to the frontier, given its authoritarian government and “extractive” political institutions (see, e.g., Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012). They argue that China’s one-party political system implies that it necessarily constraints (or lacks) the freedom and incentives of technological innovations. Hence, China’s rapid development and miracle growth so far cannot have been propelled by innovations but instead by its backwardness and through duplicating technologies from advanced countries. Such institutional views are misleading and are not supported by economic history (e.g., Japan, Germany, and Russia before World War II and South Korea and Singapore after World War II).

For the sake of argument, consider the historical path traveled by the United States. A proto-industrial developmental stage took place in the United States before it detonated its first Industrial Revolution in the middle 19th century. Charles Morris (2012) noted that by 1812 (similar to China in the 1980s), the countryside of the northern states were thoroughly commercialized, the manufacturing activities were carried out in little hamlets around water falls, which provided the power to turn the mill wheel. This was an organic, bottom-up form of proto-industrialization during a natural market-fermentation period, originating in the increasing prosperity of ordinary farmers. Even during the late 18th century before 1812, American farmers had already become increasingly entrepreneurial and had engaged in market activities through commerce—exchanging homemade consumer goods. By the 1820s, such market exchanges were rapidly replaced by networks of organized commerce—built by rich merchants. Wage labor became a popular form of farm employment, and farm surpluses were often invested in mercantile and industrial undertakings instead of invested in land. Local merchants provided the impetus toward new enterprises.

However, this rapid proto-industrial development—which would soon set off the American Industrial Revolution and its economic takeoff—went completely unnoticed by the British. No, not even Karl Marx noticed. In the same way, China’s proto-industrialization in the 1980s and its significance for detonating the 21st century Industrial Revolution went completely unnoticed by the West in the 1980s and 90s and even until today. Through a European lens, America at that time looked very backward because of its overwhelmingly rural demography. In the 1820s, more than 90% of Americans still lived in the countryside, a pattern that changed very little even by the middle of the 19 century. “\[B\]ut America’s agrarian patina concealed a beehive of commercial and industrial activity.” (Charles Morris, 2012, “The Dawn of Innovation,” p76).

The well-known British man of letters, Sidney Smith once wrote in 1820 that “Americans are a brave, industrious, and acute people; but they have hitherto given no indication of genius, and have made no approach to the heroic…. Where are their Foxes, their Burkes, their Sheridans?....Where their Arkwrights, their Watts, their Davys?…. Who drinks from American Glasses? Or eats from their plates?” (Charles Morris, 2012, “The Dawn of Innovation,” p76).

However, as Charles Morris (2012) also keenly noted, the secret of the American surge in the middle and later half of the 19th century to overtake Great Britain did not lie first in advanced technology. Not until the United States had overtaken the British to become the workshop of the world after the 1890s. Throughout the entire 19th century Americans were students of the British in steelmaking and most other science-based industries.

The same could be said about 1980s’ or 90s’ China (to paraphrase Sidney Smith): “The Chinese are a brave, industrious, and acute people; but they have hitherto given no indication of genius, and have made no approach to the heroic…. Where are their Thomas Edison, Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford, J.P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller and Cornelius Vanderbilt.?…. Who wears cloths made in China? Or builds home with Chinese made tools?” But merely 10 years later in the 2000s after China joined the WTO, the Americans could not say such things anymore. However, they could say this today: “Who rides in Chinese trains? Or drives in Chinese cars? Or flies in Chinese airplanes?” Perhaps in another 10 to 20 years these questions will be answered, firmly.

So, to return to the original question of this chapter: Why is China’s rise unstoppable? The entire nation has been mobilized and posed for technology adoption and innovation, thanks to its successful detonation of its first and second industrial revolutions, but more importantly because major technological progresses and innovations throughout history and even today do not come from pure science or from a handful of geniuses, but from wide-spread manufacturing practices, from grassroots practitioners and their hands-on experiences in daily manufacturing processes. It is “personal contact that is most relevant in learning” to adopt and invent new technologies (Kenneth Arrow, 1969, quoted in McCloskey, 2010, p.162).

The English Industrial Revolution (e.g., the division of labor and the spinning jenny and the steam engine and the factory system) was not a revolution in scientific theory, but rather a revolution in practical knowledge, in industrial organization, in manufacturing skills, in the art of making things, in organizing practical matters, and in the way people produce, distribute, travel, communicate, and consume. Such breakthroughs and discoveries and accumulations of manufacturing knowledge can only be based on and driven by the activities of manufacturing itself, by hands-on learning process of producing and organizing things. Any country can become the global leader of technology innovations as long as it can embark on the path of industrialization and become the workshop of the world (or dominate a segment in global value chains), because technological knowledge and innovations are tacit, come from repeated practice, from concrete industrial buildup, from competition for excellence, from incentives for satisfying market demand and grabbing market shares, from the manufacturing process itself. By the same token, an already industrialized nation can completely lose its technological advantage and innovative power as soon as she gives up manufacturing.

This iron Law of “learning by doing” or “innovating by practicing” has repeatedly been proven to be a powerful force in human history. The German philosopher Hegel formalized this law in his philosophical analysis of the master-slave (Herrschaft und Knechtschaft) dialectic relationship (Hegel, 1807, The Phenomenology of Spirit). True knowledge and source of innovation belong to the practitioners (“slaves” or “apprentices”) instead of the masters or lords. The same logic of industrial innovation has applied equally to China. Through an American lens, throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s or even up to today, China has been merely the “blue color worker” for her American boss, using 100 million t-shirts to exchange for one Boeing 737 airplane. China still may appear backward despite decades of hyper-growth (now the world’s second-largest economy) because of its enormous agrarian population and low levels of per capital income (again: only 1/20th of the U.S. in the 1990s and 1/8th of the U.S. in 2014) and even still lower per capital consumption level (only 1/30th of the U.S. in the 1990s and 1/12th of the U.S. in 2014). China today still has more than 50% of its population living in rural areas. However, The Chinese are now the world’s busiest manufacturing practitioners, they discover new practical knowledge daily by manufacturing and assembling and moving and shoveling things around. For example, to build high-speed trains for travel and cargo across massive mountainous areas with dramatic day-night temperature fluctuations, Chinese engineers need to solve numerous practical and technical problems that German and Japanese engineers did not encounter. Moreover, Chinese engineers must conquer practical problems in all fields of manufacturing on a daily base to compete with other manufacturing giants and remain the world’s largest manufacturing powerhouse. Ten years ago, German high-tech companies might have allowed the Chinese engineers (but not Japanese engineers) to see their blueprints and not worry about their ideas being stolen, but no more. The Chinese have already caught up to the frontier of key manufacturing technologies in electronics, information, telecommunication, satellite navigation, supercomputing, semiconductors, precision lathes, material science and nanotechnology, shipbuilding, bullet trains, tunnel and canal construction, power generation and transmission, space science and military technology, among many others, through “learning by doing.”"

The problem with stifling dissent is not stifling technological innovation; it's stifling cultural and political innovation (weakening soft power and making serious political miscalculation like Hitler attacking the USSR more likely), making corruption easier to get away with and thus more inevitable on a larger scale, and making social stability too brittle and too prone to collapse under a serious enough shock as happened to the USSR from 1989-1992.

The problems that China are likely to face as a result of their current authoritarian system are not related to technological innovation.  They're related to a total lack of soft power, which can already be seen, worsening corruption, which has always been a major problem for China, and the risk of serious political miscalculation (like failure to deal properly with HK) or economic failure creating just enough instability to shatter social order, which hasn't happened yet but is always a risk of authoritarian states where people cannot vent political frustration at the ballot box and just peacefully change the governing party."

1)	The US decides what it wants and imposes a new system, perhaps even a new Order.

The soonest that restructuring is likely to happen is 2030, which would suggested 2035 is the soonest the US could start to impose any plan.

2)	Something spooks the US and we have a kneejerk response that involves something like what we did after WWII. The soonest that can occur would be when one of the new regional powers does something that Americans find scary. 


Russia, Germany, China, Iran, Brazil and Saudi are all going to be locked down in regional affairs and IMO none are going to emerge in a dominant regional position (spoiler alert: central theme of Disunited). Instead Argentina, Turkey, France and Japan will rise as the significant players. 

It is hard to imagine Argentina doing something the US finds more than amusing. Turkey and the US may disagree over a lot of things these days, but remove US interest from places like the Balkans and Mesopotamia and the Caucasus and its hard to see Americans getting too worked up. France and the US are like estranged siblings. We spat and fight but will always be for one another on anything important. 

That just leaves Japan…and Japan fully understands what can happen when you get on America’s bad side. If there is ANY country that will go out of its way to not aggravate the US, it is Japan.

The oil is gone from the North Sea, and every bank in Scotland has already made it abundantly clear that if Scotland moves to divorce they will decamp.

What does the future look like for Australia?
Do we remain a US ally moving forward or are we cut loose as the USA steps back?"
PeterZeihan,fdhqjtk,t1_fdhnath,"Oz has – repeatedly – gone out of its way to be a loyal ally, even when domestic politics challenge the idea. This has been the position of EVERY Oz government since 1940. The reason is simple: Oz is a lightly populated land near very densely populated lands. It simply cannot manage its own defense.
That has nudged EVERY Oz government to not simply be very loyal, but to be extremely creative. For example, all that recent hubbub about Huawei? Americans didn’t figure out the firm was a front to create a global hacking system – that was the Aussies. The people in the know throughout US defense and intel know the reality and value our Aussie allies. 
And you may have noticed, even Trump hasn’t meaningfully challenged the US-Oz trade deal. Really, it’s the only one he hasn’t lambasted. Oz diplomats know when to keep their heads down, when to shout from the rooftops and when to pass notes in class. Oz has become the country that most excels at understanding and manipulating the US (more so than Canada now). 
Will it be enough to keep the US/Oz relationship close? Probably. The big hit to Oz will come with the Chinese crash, and I’d argue that many in Oz are already positioning for that inevitability."

What they do do (heh) is reduce the usefulness of the supercarriers because they at least in theory force the carriers to be further from shore. The missing piece is a redundant, ruggedized, relocatable satellite system. In any real war the first the US will do is take out all Chinese satellites.

For example, the new hypersonics and China’s intermediate range ballistics could, in theory, hit a carrier 1000+ miles out to see. But the Chinese require eyes-on the carrier to hit it, so as soon as the US detects a launch, the carrier moves and by the time the missile arrives the carrier is gone (very Mr Miagi). 

Remember when the Chinese shot down one of their own satellites a decade ago and everyone bitched about how the Chinese could shoot down something they owned and knew where it was and how to hit it? Within a week the US took out eight different satellites w eight different offensive systems and China got reeeeal quiet. 

It isn’t that the US is immune. It is that the US is heavily resistant…and it is at or near the front of the tech revolution in weapons and has a LOT more experience in managing and operationalizing and deploying and using and troubleshooting these techs than anyone else."

3. Your views are very logical (and almost always turn out right!), but you never heard them expressed so plainly in traditional media or by politicians.

Looking forward to reading your new book!"
PeterZeihan,fdhvi0w,t1_fdhnazt,"Hypersonics:
A weapons system that is going to take out a carrier needs four things:

1)	Reach

2)	Range

3)	Speed

4)	Independent targeting capacity 

The first three are obvious and are part of what hypersonics promise (keep in mind none of these are deployed just yet, much less battletested). 

But it’s the fourth that really matters. In any meaningful war scenario space will be a theater and no one is better at space warfare than the US. Any anti-US adversary has to plan on being space-blind. So any hypersonic will need to be able to “think” on its own. If it flies high, US radar can see it (and likely intercept it). If it flies low, its visual range is very sharply limited (at 20 feet over the water, it can only see about ten miles). So it needs to be able to think about maneuvers, ID targets, differentiate targets, AND evade countermeasures. Our AI just isn’t that good (and especially that miniaturized) just yet. 

So the Chinese position is simple. Don’t try to hit a single ship. Cook off hundreds (thousands?) of the things and hit every ship. 

So let’s assume the saturation strategy works and it eliminates US naval forces from the Western Pacific. What do you think the region’s merchant marine will look like the next day? What do you think the countries of the First Island Chain will think of China from then on? What sort of moronic ship captain will ever sail inside the Chain within in the next decade? “Success” in this sort of exchange with the US absolutely destroys the Chinese economy.


Now that said, these weapons are coming and they will get better and that will – in time – obviate the supercarriers as concept. It is probably 40+ years out, but it is coming. As such I’d argue that the Ford class is America’s last supercarrier class. My money is on the next “big thing” being arsenal ships: Destroyer-size vessels that carry a few thousand cruise missiles, a significant proportion of which will be…hypersonics.

2) Much has been made, often in a negative context, of the declining birth rate. However, given there is a strong correlation between lower birth rates and female equality/participation in economies, plus the overall global rate of humanity at large is still increasing, straining the planet’s limitations, does that imply a reckoning where we will fundamentally need to rethink the present systems and notions of economies at large?

In comparison between you and your old boss George Friedman, it seems you have differing opinions on Argentina and Poland. He also doesn't seem to be quite as bullish on France.

He seems to envision a US endorsed, Poland lead Intermarium with it and Romania as just the first two pieces falling into place. In comparing your different outlooks, do you know why George takes a more middling outlook on Argentina and France relative to yours? His Intermarium position on Poland seems to hinge on US backing (example: South Korea, Israel), but maybe you know more?

Defense of Europe without France and Germany is simply silly. The US (even at the height of the Cold War) v Russia (even at the depth of the 1990s) is simply a mismatch. It’s simple geography. Poland is a flat, defenseless plain. Romania is on the other side of the Carpathians. The are NOT part of the same theater, so the US would need to deploy two completely separate cross-continental fronts while the Russians could shift forces back and forth between them easily.
As such, no one serious in Poland talks about Polish leadership except maybe w/in the Visegrad Group (Poland, Cz, Hungary and Slovakia). Romania is on its own, or at best, partnered with Turkey. It isn’t so much that the two cannot bleed for one another, but instead that they cannot.

Although I do not live in Alberta full time (full disclosure, I am a dual U.S./Canadian citizen living in San Antonio, Texas), I do have family in Alberta, and I do visit Alberta on a semi-regular basis. So I do see all of the foundational conditions expressed in your book and newsletters in the province. In my last visit over the holidays, I saw that WEXIT was gaining traction (even among my more liberal family members). I do, however, think that two years is a little fast. If someone had asked me to predict how long the resentment would take to boil over to a referendum on secession. I would have predicted perhaps around 4-5 years. So I guess I am wondering what is making you think that an Alberta succession referendum is only two years away?

Also, do you see the U.S. absorbing all of the former Canadian provinces or just some of them?"
PeterZeihan,fdhq45t,t1_fdhm3ub,"I believe I said that in the next two years we’ll know if it is going to happen, because after that it won’t really matter.
Here’s my thinking:
Two years is when Quebec shifts into mass retirement and the financial burden upon Alberta becomes crushing. Two years is about when the US refining complex will have mostly shifted towards preferring light/sweet shale crude oil instead of Alberta’s heavy/sour. Two years is about how long it’d take Alberta to realize a) Canada as a whole will never give them a better deal, b) the financial commitment to remaining Canadian will destroy the Albertan economy, and c) the US political system will lose most of its party coherence (temporarily) and become unable to meaningfully debate something like Alberta petitioning for statehood. 
Point of all that is we are in the witching hour.
The one bright spot I see in all this (for Canada) is that DepPM Cristina Freeland is now in charge of all interprovinicial affairs. She’s smart, she understands the challenge at hand, and she’s from Alberta. If anyone can head this off, it’s her. The question is whether she can offer anything the Albertans want. Of that I’m not all that hopeful…

As to who else the US ""wants"". Saskatchewan is a shoo-in and if Alberta did leave Sas would leave the next day. After that, negotiations would get more difficult. BC and Quebec and Ontario have a firmer we-are-not-American mindset that would not go over well with American negotiators."

My personal opinion is that Wexit is going nowhere because nobody outside of a crazed minority in Alberta (at present) believes that Alberta *really* wants to leave Canada to join the US or go it alone.  The Quebecois got most of what they wanted because people actually believed, due to the cultural differences, that they'd be crazy enough to go through with it even though it was economically suicidal.  But Alberta isn't going to get anything in intraprovincial negotiations because nobody believes that Albertans are actually that crazy or that there's any economic benefit whatsoever to a 'wexit'.  If there *was* a demonstrable economic benefit to joining the US though, at least the wexit movement would give Alberta a negotiating position and force concessions that favor the province."

>https://omny.fm/shows/danielle-smith/why-alberta-should-become-the-51st-state

Short version of his answer is Alberta would solve some problems but gain new ones. Alberta would solve their financial, monetary, and economic downturns. Though they would also have to contend with the fact that US states have slightly less autonomy than Canadian provinces. They would have to identify as albertan americans instead of albertan canadians. Zeihan says that value judgement is much more subjective and that canadian identity might be more important to albertans than first appears.

 Also, zeihan says that the inclusion of alberta would move the federal US politics on healthcare to the left, and they would still enjoy their state healthcare though drugs might cost slightly more. As a US state you can have your own healthcare system. California state politicians were proposing a bill of funding their own state healthcare last year. Though he admits healthcare is tricky and the canadians might have slightly higher costs for prescription meds than they enjoy at the moment."

We constantly hear of the USA as a declining power, the inevitable rise of China as the world leader, etc. Your case is very logical and based on fact; why don't we hear this viewpoint more often in the mainstream media and business?"
PeterZeihan,fdho5kb,t1_fdhm131,"Don’t take it too personally. Part of the idea of the global Order was that the Americans forced geopolitics to not matter as much. Add in Hitler taking they idea that geography shapes people waaaay too far and the entire discipline largely disappeared from US universities until the 2010s. It is still a bit of a stepchild, certainly in geography departments.
There’s also a technical reason as to why media doesn’t cover international issues well:
Pre-digital-revolution everyone watched the same news programs. We called it broadcasting. Every network and most regional newspapers had foreign bureaus. 
That was expensive, so when we got email those bureaus got trimmed down because you could handle everything but the reporting and writing from the home offices.
Then we got file attachments and you could close down everything but the reporting, and even that became more ad hoc.
Then we got instant messaging and not only did you not even need the office, you didn’t even need the reporter. You could just hire stringers.
Now we have algorithms that select other people’s stories for you, and we’re on the verge of having algorithms that write the contents itself.
Digitization has removed people from the reporting process which means we’ve also lost context and analysis and placement and criticality. All that’s left is the domestic talking head circuit: narrowly-informed opinionmongering and fake news. As bad as it is in the US, I’d argue it is worse in Canada and the UK. The only major agencies that still do things the “old” way are Al Jazeera and France24. Russia1 used to be good until it became all-propaganda-all-the-time.
The last time we had a new tech that changed how we interacted with (internationally relevant) information was the telegraph. That brought us yellow journalism. We got through that and we’ll get through this. It just takes time to establish a legal and ethnical framework for information processing and dissemination. 
My concern is that last time, narrowly-informed opinionmongering and fake news got us into the Spanish-American War. We could do a lot of damage before we figure out how to metabolize the new infotechs."

Questions:

1. How does Climate Change affect your forecasting? I assume there are at least some geopolitical considerations to be made when/if ice-free Arctic sea routes open up, agricultural capacity increases/decreases in some areas (Canada & Russia), sea levels rise, ect.? What if anything climate change related is on your radar for analysis?
2. I've heard your thoughts on the future of militarized drones, what do you think about the implications of the new United States Space Force & militarized space? Game changer or waste of resources?
3. What, if any, is your opinion of Musk / Bezos / the current billionaire space race? Do you believe humanity can/will become an interplanetary civilization?

Wishing you well on your book release and in the future!"
PeterZeihan,fdhoz2c,t1_fdhm7uz,"Climate change is problematic for folks in geopolitics. We study how place shapes everything and climate is part of “place”. The issue is that never have any version of climate change – natural or mancaused – impacted all places identically. Nor is there a such thing as an “average” climate change.
Two examples:
First, Australia. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve noticed the place is on fire. Daytime temperate increases in Oz this past decade are well beyond a standard deviation above the global norm, and that has contributed to runaway wildfires that are literally continental in scope. Oz is NOT the future of the world, but instead an example of what can happen in already-dry, already-marginal lands. How would the locals see that as anything but a bad thing, and how could this be anything but bad for Oz’s geopolitical standing?
Second, Illinois. Illinois is right about at the global average in terms of temp increases, but none of it has occurred during the day. Only at night. In spring and fall having warmer nights means no freezes in the shoulder seasons. That means a longer growing season. Add in more moisture from higher temperatures and Illinois is on the verge of being about to have two crops per year. That would nearly double the average farmer’s income. How would the locals see that as anything but a good thing, and how could this be anything but good for the US’ geopolitical standing?
This is the problem. The locality of climate change is what impact the geopolitical, and we just aren’t good enough at math to breakdown what that will be on a locality-by-locality basis. I’m hoping to address this – indepth – at a later time once the data is better but for now we just don’t have the info we need to do this on a continental scope, much less a global one."

ser_arthur_dayne,fdhtdxc,t1_fdhoz2c,"Careful with making statements about ""two growing seasons"" too flippantly - more temperature/moisture doesn't necessarily mean soil will have sufficient nutrients to support extra crops, and rainfall in those areas may influence the nitrogen cycle in a way that makes the soil less sustainable."
12-9038190830,fdi2dax,t1_fdhoz2c,"I seem to disagree with the idea that people can't see beyond their local interests in the second case you've presented. Surely the idea that climate change is contributing to much more bad things than good things would factor into the thoughts of an Illinois farmer. Furthermore, I understand that from a geopolitical standpoint the United States would gain from that scenario alone, but most models predict that the ramifications of climate change, if left as is, will have massive affects worldwide. It seems flippant to ignore the geopolitical implications of these somewhat unpredictable events circling back around and harming the U.S more than any crop could help it."

tsk1979,fdi9y5a,t1_fdhtdxc,"I think he is talking in the general sense that there are going to be winners and losers with climate change.

Similarly increase in armed conflict due to water shortage in Africa could be a big win for small arms manufacturers.

This is a reality of climate change which gets overlooked when we just talk about average or mean global temperature rises. More than the average rise, its the local outliers which have a more far reaching effect"

dagofin,fdj1att,t1_fdhwsba,"If you think the modern US is an aggressive state, I'd advise you to look at our responses to provocations such as Ukraine and Syria. Go back 40 or 50 years and there's zero chance such brazen aggression/intervention from a classically hostile opponent would go unchecked by the US. The reason Putin has become so aggressive in pushing Russian regional interests is because the US has proven it's unwilling to shut him down (which also lead to them interfering in our political system with barely a slap on the wrist in return, nice deterrence there)."
ExPrinceKropotkin,fdjpca8,t1_fdj1att,"Sure, all states have justifications for their armed interventions (the leaders of Germany, Russia or Iran probably also don't see themselves as being especially aggressive; expanding NATO to the Baltic states is, from Russia's point of view, also a provocation). So this map must use some kind of criteria for evaluating aggressiveness besides rulers' self-perceptions. /u/Master_Tibbs 's response goes more in the direction of showing what one of these criteria is: Whether a state will need to intervene to secure resources in the coming century.

One question for you is this:  how did you make a career in geopolitics? I would love to pursue a similar path in the long term.

Another relating to your thought process regarding a hot war in Europe based on Russia's declining population: your analysis makes complete sense, but doesn't nuclear deterrence make the need for a shooting war in Europe both far less likely and far less necessary from the Russian perspective?  They don't need a choke to defend if they can protect their borders from invaders with the threat of nuclear retaliation. 

Other than this I'd love to hear your take on (1) Iran; (2) if there's a way the US can go ""too far"" that would override the new transaction-based foreign policy that demographics will force other countries into; or (3) just to open up /r/worldnews and give commentary on whatever you see there"

So two thoughts:
1)	Have a VERY wide bullseye. Jobs for people who study mid-14th century Islamic history are few and far between, even in academia. You need to be able to hold conversations about politics AND economics AND trade AND security in more than one region.
2)	Learn Spanish. It’s the #2 language in the US and the #2 in the Western Hemisphere and if I’m correct about the general global fuckupedness that’s about to erupt, the WHem largely gets a pass. Most countries of the WHem will have high needs for this or that product or service while also excelling at producing this or that other product or service.

I've read your first book and seen some of your online content and I have few questions for you. I'm sure many will ask about the Iran - U.S situation so I'll focus to different parts of the world. Feel free to pick and choose.

1) You've argued that China has difficulty to escape the landlock due to the first island chain. Do you see no way for it to go to the opposite direction. That the China finishes its islands, comes to dominate the South China Sea, the first island chain from Taiwan and below falls on China's lap like dominoes and the islands become impenetrable coastal fortress?

2) Is it going to be pre First World War style empires again and if so, which countries are actually going to form empires? 

3) Europe is now encircled by three strong countries with different goals: Britain, Turkey and Russia. What do you think about their ability to cooperate and put pressure on Europe?

4) You've argued that Russia has very narrow window to act if it wishes to expand. If Russia fails to act, is the Eastern Europe finally going to be conflict free happy-go-lucky zone or is the historical instability of the Eastern Europe somehow of more fundamental sort?

5) What do you think will be the geopolitical significance of the global warming, melting north and the new sea routes?

6) I've seen your global stability map on some video and you predict realtively good for the Nordics in the near future. As a Finn I'd like you to throw some doom and gloom here as well. What are the major challenges going forward for the Nordics?

PeterZeihan,fdi0wd4,t1_fdhnrf1,"let’s mix 3, 4 & 6

Russia doesn’t get along with anyone. At all. Like ever. Their paranoia is a product of their hyperexposed geography and their size by its very nature provokes fear. Any cooperation with the Russians only exists so long as macro and micro geopolitical alignments hold…or the leadership of another country is sufficiently bribed or dumb. (Erdogan of Turkey certainly falls into one, and perhaps both, categories. It won’t last) None of which means the EU’s future is a bright one, but that’s another topic completely. 

If Russia fails to act, then Russia starts to fall apart. Russia is not a traditional nation-state. It is a multi-ethnic empire. If that fractures and we see civil collapse (and likely the odd internal war) the Russian frontier becomes less secure. More functional pieces of the old Russian empire will try to claw their way out. Some will use guns. Some will have nukes. All will have Soviet-quality military equipment and intelligence personnel. I would not want to be Poland or Ukraine.

But I might want to be Finland. Assuming the Russians don’t try their Hail Mary and come and visit the Balts in the night, a suitably chaotic Russia might entice the Finns to come visit Russia. The Karelian Isthmus used to be Finnish territory, and in a Russian-disintegration scenario I can absolutely see St Petersburg breaking away to become the fourth Baltic republic under Finnish sponsorship. Not exactly risk free, but hey, that’s the neighborhood."

1)	The shale revolution has proving bigger and faster than I ever expected. Its rapidity prompted me to write book #2 (Absent Superpower) and has colored #3 as well. I said in #1 (Accidental Superpower) that by 2020 the shale revolution would make North America as a unit oil self sufficient. Instead the US by itself is now an oil exporter. That’s put a lot of my other forecasts on steroids, in particular the growing American feeling that we don’t need anyone else. Which brings us to…

2)	The Americans’ desire of divorce from…everything has gotten huge. Instead of slimming down the ally list to something more compact, instead – as I say in Disunited “America’s list of allies has shrunk from nearly everyone to the potentially useful to the obviously useful to the obviously loyal to those with little choice.” At the rate we are going the US will only have 3-4 allies: the UK, Oz, Singapore, and maybe Japan."

neverEverEverPost,fdhopei,t3_elgcxp,"In your recent (and excellent) Iran piece, you didn’t address the possibility that Iran may turn to destabilizing the USA via non-conventional means (e.g., cyber) that would put President Trump in a mode that may not fit his MO. Do you see that as non-trivially likely?


It seems possible that the US’s withdrawal from the Middle East means we’ll just be harassed from afar, now, and the dynamic of state-level cyber shenanigans could be the new endless conflict. Still a preferable scenario to blood-and-treasure, but the ease of false-flags and the domestic utility value oppressive regimes will find in such tactics will make global withdrawal elusive.

However I have seen in more recent interviews Australia has been dropped from your list of the ""future successful nations"". What are the reasons for this change or is Australia still on the successful list?

1. The first half of all your presentations mostly cover the same. What are some areas you wish you had time for but have to cut?

2. Recently you did an interview with Cotto-Gottfried. How did that interview come about? Can we expect more like this in the future?

3. What is the most important geopolitical thing or area people are not talking about enough right now?

4. The one area of the world you seem to talk about least is sub-Saharan Africa (other than Angola). As far as I can tell this area of the world is hyper dependent on trade for the currencies they need for imports. Also most depend to a great degree on international aid. With the world order deteriorating how are these countries (other than Angola) going to cope?

But bottom line: Americans don’t want to be in the ME right now and during the past three presidents we’ve gone from 150k+contractors to today’s level of roughly 1/9 that.

SwizzySticks,fdhmci7,t3_elgcxp,"Hi Peter, thank you for doing this AMA. While many may disagree with your conclusions I don't think anyone can deny you bring new and unique ideas to the discussion. Feel free to answer any one of these questions:

1. Turkey is one of your few ""rising stars"". Could you provide some insight on what their future will look like? Why is Erdogan attempting to expand Turkish influence in places like Libya while simultaneously alienating his traditional allies in the US and EU? If his posture is aggressive, why would he give up the F-35 attack aircraft in exchange for the S-400 air defense system? Could Russia and Turkey really ignore their historical rivalry and form an alliance or is their current relationship just one of temporary convenience?

2. Many experts have predicted China's imminent economic collapse for the past 30 years. What is different this time around? When and how will this crash happen?

2) You once talked about how New Zealand dairy is cheap and geared to sell to China and the Chinese aren't buying, and that one day the Kiwis would figure out they could sell cattle for beef just as cheap as they can make milk.

1. I've read both your previous books (and eagarly awaiting your third!). They really inspired my intrest in geopolitics to the extent I'm considering trying to get into the field after school.Would you have any thaughts, considerations, or advice for someone considering going into the field?

2.This is something of a narrow intrest question at best, but I'm curious to your thoughts on the future of the Irish state. Assuming your forecasts for the EU's future prove to be correct, I should imagine the only way forward for Ireland is to fall back into a place of being a sort of proxy of the British Economy. Do you believe this may be acruate? Obvious politics being politics, and especially in relation to Anglo Irish relations, things are far from simple or predictable, but your thaughts would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time, and best regards from Ireland!"

LlambdaLlama,fdhs6v3,t3_elgcxp,"Hello there. I appreciate your AMA immensely.
So just real quick: I recently saw a video about system dynamics and how stuff evolves into more complex system. Modern civilization is no different. We've been growing exponentially but as of recently began to stagnate in many aspects (Agriculture, economic growth, population growth, resource extraction, etc etc). It appears that we've exceeded the bio-capacity and ecological footprint sustainability a long time ago. It appears everything will degrow (shrinkage to GDP, Human Population, Resource Supply and World Dconomy complexity in general).

My question is how might countries react to this? Perhaps some of them will outright collapse, but is there a possibility that countries like USA, Brazil, Australia, other large nations like UK, France and Germany might become ultra-authoritarian and endanger their own people (citizens, residents and migrants). What are your thoughts on this?"

If there is an economic collapse on the near horizon, how will this affect the geopolitical situation in your opinion, with America no longer so invested in the rest of the world?"
casual_cocaine,fdhv2yh,t3_elgcxp,"Hi Peter, 

I think it is great that you are doing this especially given the recent instability the world seems to be focusing on. I have a few questions for you.

First, in the video, *A World That Will Fragment,* you end the video with a visualization of countries, some of which you predict will cease to exist. Given the world is a different place than in 2015, would you stand by these predictions or would you make modifications to the list? 

You discuss economies prior to Bretton Woods agreements and it makes me wonder if there is relationship to draw with those economies to modern economies. What are your thoughts on economies gravitating towards a harder currency such as gold or bitcoin? Does bitcoin have an actual use-case for stability and security in an economic sense? 

Just ordered the book and am excited to read your latest work! Thanks in advance if you answer my questions.

2. How does China's growing influence in Africa affect the world?
3. How strong is the relations between Russia and China is currently? I know they use to have a strong alliance but I know they had been at each others throat after the soviet-sino split, but I am unaware of its current status. Have they rekindled the alliance in order to oppose NATO?"

Geopoliticonomics,fdhw9s9,t3_elgcxp,"Hi Peter

Love your work.  Cant wait for your new book to land.  Also like to person your twitter post. 

Just a couple of quickly questions from me today. 

1. Why do you think that France will be the next dominant power in Europe?  I've read your newsletter on this - I agree with much but not all of it.  Specifically, France is more hitched to the EU than the Usa was tied into Breton Woods. 1 - France replaced the franc with euro.  2 - France trades with other Eu status far FAR more than Usa trades with all other countries.  3 - France has huge internal stability problems (riots, large minority populations with almost no representation and not well integrated, etc).  I'm concerned these serious challenges are somewhat overlooked.  Also whenever France has become expansionist, a coalition has put it down - with the Uk leading the way (Napoleon, 7 years War, Louis xiv, etc).  Thoughts?

2. Is another future possible for the Uk other than the break state of impoverished vassalage to the Usa (having been stripped of all of its shiny things by the american vulture) that you have outlined in your newsletter?  Could the Uk get Aus, Can and Nz to provide surface fleet to support Uk carriers?  Interestingly India is increasingly seeing the Commonwealth as a valuable tool to assert India influence and corner China.  E.g. Modi actually showed up to 2019 summit with serious intent (unlike 2011 or 2015).  India is also upsizing its navy, army and airforce.  I know India is protectionist, but perhaps mini Breton Woods mark II is on the cards?  most Commonwealth members also happen to be close allies/partners for the Usa. 
 Curious to see in 2017 a royal Commonwealth society branch was set up in the Usa.  Not saying any of this is likely, but is it at least possible?

3 - could the Uk, Russia or Turkey be friends of the moment for the Usa as it goes to trade War against the Eu post Trump 2020 win?  All 3 also want to beat out concessions from the Eu. Yes present huge differences exist, but so they did between the Soviets and the Usa & Uk in ww2.  Nothing unites foes like a common opponent :)

Thanks for any comments.  All the best."

Metzler123,fdhme2c,t3_elgcxp,"Peter, thanks for your great books! In my opinion Iran would be a better ally to the US than Saudia Arabia because 

 
* The Sunnis are arguably stronger in the Sunni-Shia conflict, and US grand strategy is to prop up the weaker players and prevent the breakout of a strong power.


* SA and it’s extremist allies have the capabilities to harm US interests across the world while Iran is just a regional power.


* The US no longer relies on SA’s oil. 


* Iran is also a counter-weight to Turkey, which is a rising power in the region.


So my question is either, why am I wrong, or if you agree, do you see any type of realignment coming? If so, how long do these things take?"

Lirvan,fdhmbc2,t3_elgcxp,"Hey Peter,

I have a few questions regarding emerging technologies and how they relate to geopolitics, and one other one relating to USA demography:

1. With spaceX's starship, the cost per kg to low earth orbit will be dropping dramatically. Assuming a launch cost of \~$50m for launches 10-100 or so launches (avoiding first 10, as they will be pricey), eventually getting down to $2m by 2040, the cost per kg during that time would be $20-$40. At that cost, asteroid mining starts to look enticing. What would be the geopolitical consequences of the USA being the only nation with that capability? Would we see something akin to the shale revolution, but with all minerals & metals, rather than just petroleum/byproducts?
2. David Sinclair's Harvard lab research into age reversal and/or making it so older people can still work has the potential to shift how we look at demography. What countries would benefit most from widespread adoption of such technologies, and would it shift global power?
3. While the USA has avoided the global(nearly) millennial baby bust, it looks like a baby bust is beginning, as the birth rate for millennials is dropping. Is the USA's immigration enough to offset that upcoming bust, or are we looking at economic trouble when the millennials start to retire?

1.  You're books seem to be very focused on geography and demographics determining the destiny of a nation, but the trend in IR this decade has been the fundamental role of institutions in determining the fate of a nation.  In *Accidental Superpower* I recall only one significant argument involving institutions, the difference in mineral rights between the US and ROW.  Why do you neglect institutions in your books?  Do you think they don't matter as much?

2.  Concerning your interest in Albertan secession, you seem to assume that the demographic pyramid of Alberta will be the same or similar in the event of secession.  Do you think this is a valid assumption?  You don't think a large proportion of young people will move to BC or Ontario?

3.  Is your map from [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/PeterZeihan/status/1212400464060284928) up to date with regards to offshore wind potential?  I thought New England had poor on-shore prospects but quite good off-shore potential."

Thank you for hosting this AMA forum today.

Although the topic of discussion is about geopolitics; my question surrounds space (orbital politics). With the addition of a Space Force in 2019 by President Trump. Do you feel that this will pressure China and possibly Russia to do the same? China seems the more probable as I have doubts the Russian economy could sustain another space race. 

In addition, I'd like you to comment on Russia's new hypersonic missile technology?  If the reports from Russia are correct; what are your thoughts on how that will impact US foreign policy and defense initiatives for the next decade?

2, you're not very optimistic on China, and your case is very compelling. On the other hand, I've read others who have a different take: that China has an interest in looking weak, that negotiating from apparent weakness (but actual strength) is a strategy they've employed for a while. For example, news out of China is rarely ever good; people have been talking about its implosion for decades, now. Yet, we keep going.

Your insight really helped shaped perspectives on various topics while I studied comparative politics in college. Thank you for making Geopolitics not the usual dull and unexciting conversation that it sometimes can be, especially in Academia! Can't wait to read Disunited Nations.

Most authorities in geopolitics today like to point to the rise of China as changing the dynamic in East Asia. However, what of Japan? Will they stand by idly and allow China to lead the ""flying geese""? How after 30 years of economic stagnation and a sharp demographic decline will they even have the resolve and resources to respond?

EDIT: A good trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR_e9y-bka0"
Shrog_The_Best,fdqhuek,t1_fdqhp8y,What do you think is your best short?
thecritics001,fdrxbq4,t1_fdrx0dj,"Not yet, heard it's a pretty good movie."
thecritics001,fdu4qcr,t1_fdt1cj0,"We've heard a lot about 2001 : A space Odyssey, still haven't seen it yet, would look it up definitely."
thecritics001,fdqiw31,t1_fdqhuek,"I think its Z : The beginning, there is a backstory on the short that inspires us."
Samtastic33,fds8bkq,t1_fdrxbq4,"It’s really good, you should see it. It is quite a weird film in some ways though.

Also you’re like the only person I’ve ever heard of (other than me) that likes Tomorrowland"
thecritics001,fds8yth,t1_fds8bkq,"Tomorrowland was beautiful especially cos I got to see BTS, Breakdowns the story plus I liked the actress too 😁"
thecritics001,fds8dto,t1_fds8bkq,Would definitely check it out
eekamuse,fdsl361,t1_fds8yth,Tomorrowland is fun. Does not suck at all.
Only_Mortal,fdsqb4v,t1_fds8dto,You should definitely watch it to see an alien movie where war doesn't break out as soon as first contact is made.
Alkein,fdsqylg,t1_fdsl361,"I enjoyed it but I found they tried to stick to a safe movie format/formula that held it back from doing more interesting things. I liked it, but it was just telling me the same story that most Disney films tell, just reskinned for retro-scifi fans."
thecritics001,fdu4aj2,t1_fdsqb4v,"Hmm, your quote makes me think of Prometheus all over again 😁"
thecritics001,fdu3vjh,t1_fdsqylg,Exactly 🙌🏿
Only_Mortal,fdul12i,t1_fdu4aj2,Another good movie!
thecritics001,fdxfv5z,t1_fdul12i,True .
karpuzcu321,fdqf85u,t3_empyha,"Hi. I like your guys films and passion. I am making amateur short films with my phone  too. I just wanna ask, How did you get in to filmmaking?"
thecritics001,fdqhjfd,t1_fdqf85u,"Thank you, we loved films but didn't start with short films initially, we made a few comedy skits which you shouldn't watch 😅 so we had a deep conversation with ourselves about want we wanted to do, we learnt and we started creating."
Electronoooob,fdrnrth,t3_empyha,how does it feel to know that you have impressed so many people with your talents?
thecritics001,fdruf5a,t1_fdrnrth,"Well it has been nothing but inspiring, its usually surprising when people tell us we inspire them, it gets overwhelming at times 😅"

thecritics001,fdrrssr,t1_fdrq304,"Well, I think the burial of kojo, king of boys, the setup, living in bondage: breaking free, beasts of no nation, are among our favorites from africa there are so many great films that exist which we haven't seen yet."

N0rtyNort,fdrl7cq,t3_empyha,So how do u start writing a sketch?
thecritics001,fdrm8b8,t1_fdrl7cq,"Well if you're talking about how we start writing our shorts , well most of our shorts weren't actually scripted , we just come up with an idea, speak about it, shot list then go out and shoot, looking back it now I feel doing that helped us not to procrastinate alot and just do stuff."
LordCrinoline,fdrjd36,t3_empyha,What motivated you to pursue this for such a long time?
thecritics001,fdrjuie,t1_fdrjd36,"To be honest, there's no specific reason to what motivated us, we just wanted to do something, we had so many bad moments and this leads to the one thing we're grateful for, having ourselves, being together helps us push through sail through and we've been together since the beginning."
Connoisseuro,fdrq6nl,t3_empyha,Do you see yourselves going for bigger projects in the future? Some film festivals are really interested in sci fi or experimental shorts and that can be a huge platform for filmmakers.
thecritics001,fdrr36c,t1_fdrq6nl,"We actually see ourselves going for bigger projects in the future, but for now we want to just make good shorts , get better and slowly transit into bigger projects, plus we've been submitting to film festivals lately and we have been getting good reception"
MrRabbit7,fdrrgqv,t3_empyha,"What was a hard moment while making one of films you guys went “maybe this is the end of the road”, I mean some bad experience that made you lose hope for some time and what made you hopeful again?"
thecritics001,fdrstzm,t1_fdrrgqv,"I think we've had so many moments like that but this are two memorable ones :

We just finished shooting a short and almost done with the Vfx so our system crashed and we lost the entire project, it was hard to start all over, we couldn't continue, we made other stuff, few months later we decided to do the idea, rewrite the story and it was our first big SciFi short.

The second time,
Shooting our Short Film Z The Beginning alot Of Problems showed Up 
Our Main Character Got sick While Shooting was on 
The mobile Phone got seized by our parents and we had Issues with the Electricity Supply at that Time 
We lost Hope And Also Found it Within Our Selves it's The Beautiful thing About working with a Team 
We Tell ourselves it will Get Better. 💙


This brings back a lot of those memories."
toluwalase,fdrtfuf,t3_empyha,Why are you still based in Kaduna? Shouldn’t your priority be moving to Lagos?
thecritics001,fdru2dt,t1_fdrtfuf,"Moving to Lagos isn't really a priority for us presently, we come over  to Lagos once in a while, but we need the sanity and freedom we get over here to create our films 😅"
HolaSoyMilk,fds2bmr,t3_empyha,"What’s the biggest, most aspirational project you guys would love to do in your future?"

ositoverde,fdspsjo,t3_empyha,"I hope I'm not too late for the AMA, how did you learn VFX? What's the most difficult thing you had to do for one of your films?"
thecritics001,fdu47qp,t1_fdspsjo,"Well we Kearny Vfx through YouTube, the most difficult thing we had to do was getting a robotic arm to star in our short 😁"
fndo84,fdrrbm9,t3_empyha,"In an hypothetical scenario where you have unlimited budget, equipment and team, what kind of movie you would make and why?"
thecritics001,fdrtapl,t1_fdrrbm9,"Well most of our short films are zero budget, we just make use of DIY resources at our disposal , so we could make a SciFi film , a dramatic, or any genre, we've been in such low budget situations so we know how to work around it."
jellyfishandthings,fdrrj4a,t3_empyha,"hey, can you tell me how you guys manage the legal aspects/troubles that you face/might face ?"
thecritics001,fdrsk7z,t1_fdrrj4a,Well we haven't faced any serious legal trouble yet but we have a legal team already who help us in our legal contracts/decisions and would stand in for us in any legal case.

jedijasz,fdrvp9b,t3_empyha,how has life changed for you since getting recognized internationally?
thecritics001,fdrw3se,t1_fdrvp9b,"It has changed a lot, we know there's a lot of people watching , we feel a little bit of pressure at times, and a sort of responsibility on our shoulders to just jeep creating and don't let those rooting for us down."
jedijasz,fdrx7ua,t1_fdrw3se,i hope there has been a monetary increase to help deal with the pressure lol
jedijasz,fdrx93w,t1_fdrw3se,and good luck. keep up the great work!

adizababa,fds7af8,t3_empyha,"Well done guys... u keep up the good work... would love to know more about how you guys work...I myself just started into blender and I believe the animation  industry in Nigeria is a niche to get into...
I would love to get into contact with you guys...
 what do you guys think is the future of animation in Nigeria? How can we push it forward. .."

justin_pang78,fdtwdiv,t3_empyha,"I discovered you guys a year ago and I came across you again in one of my recommendations. I decided to check out your YT channel and I want to say, you people are rockin it! I find your content inspiring and you people prove that no matter where you're from, you can always make something if you put your love and passion into it. I appreciate the passion and creativity you kids put in your films and as a filmmaker, seeing your content has inspired me a lot more and made me feel a lot more confident in my passion for filmmaking.

My question for you is, who were your inspirations or what movie inspired you to start filmmaking?

Love what you do and hope you keep doing what you do best! Looking forward to more content soon!

Love from Australia!"
thecritics001,fdu622g,t1_fdtwdiv,"Hello thank you for the kind words , its morning here in Nigeria, well initially we just watched so many movies , personally the amazing spiderman and the twilight series were my inspiration, the art of Vfx captured me so much then 😅 so at the beginning we just started creating then we came across people like Ryan Conolly, David F Sandberg e.t.c ,those were our major inspirations and what inspired to start filmmaking was when we realized our comedy skits about criticizing bad films weren't funny so we just had to do our own part in making what we wanted to see."
DeyCallMeCasper,fdsfq8t,t3_empyha,"My wife is Igbo and I’ve been watching a lot of Nollywood movies with her, from the higher tier ones such as “The wedding party” to the really bad ones on YouTube like “Beyonce and Rihanna”. Do you have a favorite Nollywood movie?"
thecritics001,fdu2vzs,t1_fdsfq8t,"Nope, we don't, I personally I'm a big fan of a just realeased remake living in bondage: breaking free, I think it might become my favorite Nollywood film."
EPiiCxHD,fdsh3y4,t3_empyha,"Hey guys, I’m from the UK and I’m a big film fan too. Great to see that you guys have taken such an interest in making your own movies and sharing them with the world. Are there any specific movies you guys want to make but have not made yet??"

I also want to say that I really admire the work you do with little means and minimal Budget. I wish you to be able in the future to create original content to be enjoyed worldwide!"
thecritics001,fdu3jab,t1_fdsi6y4,"Well there's this concept we've had for a while, based on african mythology, time travel and some other complex elements, we'd definitely put the budget on that 😁"
artistveer,fdsko0n,t3_empyha,"1.Did you guys like learn everything from online (youtube ,etc) for VFX and fim making ? 
2. If you are going to film a big budget movie will you try to bring in some Hollywood actors or go with the actors you feature in your skits and shorts ."
thecritics001,fdu3tm1,t1_fdsko0n,"Well we learnt everything online through YouTube and constant creating (if that's the word), if we were to film a big budget movie, we might go for a Hollywood actor or find someone who fits our role it all depends on factors you might not be able to effect, plus we are our own actors at least for now 😁"

Bluecolty,fdt6iq5,t3_empyha,"This has of course never stopped you before, but do you think you will ever upgrade your equipment? If so, what do you think it would be, or what would you upgrade first?
It's great seeing you guys on reddit, you give a whole meaning to people that say you don't need a fancy computer or camera to make great content!"
thecritics001,fdu5366,t1_fdt6iq5,"Thank you for the kind words, well we've upgraded , we started shooting phones, now we have a camera but still want to shoot with phones, our main reasons of upgrading is just to experiment with as many tools that we could lay our hands on, there's nothing at our top list that we'd upgrade first, if we could afford it at the moment we go for it."
The_Warden_,fdt8sct,t3_empyha,what software do you use for the videos? what are your recommendations?

And what software are you using?"
thecritics001,fdu6av8,t1_fdtz7rd,"Well the specs of our laptop was 3GB ram, an Intel Pentium processor, 64MB video memory, tbh I look back now and ask myself how we were able to work with that and stay so many hours of rendering to create 😅, we used older versions of after effects , premiere pro a friend got for us, then we used hit film, but blender has been our major 3d software."
avipars,fdu6gbj,t1_fdu6av8,"Wow, I can barely render videos. My laptop has an old core i7, 12gb of ram. no GPU. But I am running a newer version of premiere pro. After effects always crashes ;( 

Your videos are awesome, by the way."
thecritics001,fdu6tzv,t1_fdu6gbj,"Thank you well, the newer versions of AE and premiere are memory intensive, I recommend a Lil bit older versions to work effectively."

What do you find the hardest in the filmmaking process?"

brettpkelly,fdnf15m,t3_emb3u8,"Can you define the terms ""high conflict"" and ""parental alienation"" for someone not familiar?"
Tish_EllisLPC,fdnfofj,t1_fdnf15m,"Of course!!!  High conflict refers to parents that engage in ongoing fights or disputes regarding how to coparent their kids and the responsibilities that come with coparenting. Parental Alienation occurs when a parent strategically tries to keep a child or children away from another parent through manipulation, efforts to get the child to reject the targeted parent, creating unreasonable loyalty conflicts by making the child choose between the parents."
Golferbugg,fdnvjub,t1_fdnf15m,"How about ""coparenting"" for that matter.  I was totally lost reading the title. Aren't all parents co-parents? Does that refer to divorced/separated parents or something?"

how fucked up am i?"
VikingPug,fdnm3zw,t1_fdnfofj,I just broke up with a man because his ex wife was exhibiting these behaviors and he had done nothing in 3 years to cope with it. I felt it was best he get that figured out before being in a serious relationship. I love him dearly and I don’t know if I made the right choice?
ecafsub,fdo2pju,t1_fdnfofj,"You described my situation to a T. Literally. I won’t re-type it, so [here’s a link](https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6ig6v9/_/dj6e2hs/?context=1). Aside from the abuse I describe, I was also subjected to parental alienation. 

We went to at *least* 7 years of counseling and had nothing to show for it. She had cast me in the role of the Big Bad, and I could do *nothing* right. 

Now the kid is 19, almost 20. He has no job other than occasional Favor runs. Graduated literally last in his class in HS. She never made him do anything he didn’t want to—including homework, never punished him, never made him eat properly (literally would give him chocolate cake for breakfast). He has never eaten vegetables since he got off baby food and has *never* eaten meat. He subsists on PB&J, cheese pizza, mac & cheese, and that’s about it. Despite my efforts. 

My attempt to give him a summer reading list was met by her with “that’s *stupid*!” while standing in front of him. It’s a miracle he can read. 

She continued the alienation after the divorce. But in all that, before and after, he has *never* heard me say one negative thing about his mother. I’m always available for him. I’ve never told him he couldn’t visit, unless I just wasn’t home. 

No, she wasn’t like that when we got married. He wasn’t born until we’d been married about 15 years, and that’s when it all started. I stuck with it for another 11 before admitting defeat and  throwing in the towel. 

All I have is hope that he’ll figure out that she was and is an absolutely horrible person and parent."

NotTheSable,fdogjsq,t1_fdnfofj,"Parental alienation was a topic very briefly covered in my domestic violence course. One of my professors believes that parental alienation is a made up claim by perpetrators of domestic violence when the court doesn't go their way.

He didn’t come over much when he was younger because unlike mom, dad didn’t tolerate his bullshit. I wasn’t an asshole about it, but he knew he wasn’t getting away with it. But his visits—and texts of goofy memes and other communications—have become very frequent over the last couple of years.

PMmeYourUnicycle,fdnxh54,t1_fdnp5cl,"I left my first wife in order to survive.  We had three children - one from her previous marriage and two together.  Our relationship was intense but bad.  When I left, after 10 years, I left everything - her, the kids, the house.  But I knew it was the right thing to do.  I soon got custody of the two younger kids and filed for divorce.  She was vicious, but I always let her take the kids...until it got too bad.  Then I kept them and was more careful about when she could have them.  Eventually I won full custody.  But I never kept them from her as long as I thought it was safe.  This was a huge growth time for me and I had many beautiful people guiding me.  I was at a point in my life where I was willing to listen to them.  They told me the kids need to come first.  Everything I do needs to be for them.  It really helped me get a healthy perspective and act appropriately and less selfishly."
HourRecipe,fdox76j,t1_fdnp5cl,"There is often a fear of consequences you can't protect yourself from.  What if they decide to file a claim for more child support, take away custody time, etc because they are mad that you stood up to them.  That's often $$$$ in legal fees that men don't have, yet some ex-wife's will have the state paying for their legal costs.  The only way to survive is to not play and just do what you are contractually liable to do.  Document everything.
  
I also liken it to a violent relationship.  You aren't going to tell your girlfriend who was beat by their ex that they need to open up communication with their ex and try to convince them to change their ways because they have kids together.  The same should apply to men that have to deal with emotionally abusive exes.  Counseling and mediation also only works when all involved can be honest.  If they feel their kid is safe when they are not with them, that's the best outcome they can hope for.  It truly sucks, but what other options do you have?"

*Edit: I'd like to also point out that this obviously isn't strictly a men issue, it's all genders that were raised by mentally ill, abusive, and/or addict homes. We ALL have textbook coping traits that creates a very broken internal world, boundary enforcement being one of the top issues.*"

MountainBlitz,fdool1a,t1_fdomw09,"That's the thing about life-- no matter how you grew up, consequences are consequences. Don't take it so hard as a parent because to be honest, ""childhood"" is a very vague or non- existing concept in many parts of the world. 

My parents are immigrants and at six years old I was expected to contribute to the family business. I learned professionalism and work ethnic from an early age because it was tied to consequences such as my family's/my own survival. Being immigrants, everything we did was as a unit. Everybody had to contribute and no contribution was deemed less than another. While my friends spent time in little league and being wild at the park, I was busy sorting paperwork and filing. I didn't always get paid cash wise, but my payment was the meals and utilities we all shared and used. 

Parents always say ""I want my kids to have a better life than I did""-- they think that doing everything for them is better-ing the the kid, but learning through trial by fire and getting to mess up has saved me as an adult. 

The only thing I regret is high school, where I wish we could of spent time learning how to do our own taxes or something like that. Classes at my high school (looking back) had more entertainment value rather than functional education value that will help in life."

He set no boundaries with her. 

One day he’s calling her a mean, selfish person but then the next day texting her for a recipe? No, just no. They can text but I feel it should only be about their daughter.

I also witnessed the ex wife getting the daughter riled up emotionally so she didn’t want to go with her father upon visitation. He told me this happens EVERY time. I had no knowledge of that happening and I thought it was abusive, toxic and unproductive . She berates him by text and tells him she will take him back to court and take away his rights.

LightningZ71,fdoq3c8,t1_fdnsy0x,"As a male, I was also raised without boundary setting skills.

I was raised ""Happ wife, happy life"" and ""if things suck, just work harder"", but married a high conflict personality that has a dismissive avoidant attachment style.  Complete and utter Trainwreck.  It wasn't until I finally took to the internet and did my own research on improving my marriage did I even understand that boundaries meant more than not touching someone inappropriately and not actively abusing each other.  I finally enforced my own and stood firm on what I would accept and not accept in life.  Things eventually improved.  

The takeaway though is that if I had known to set and enforce boundaries, and if I had known that me enforcing them didn't make me an asshole, the last two decades of my life would have been greatly improved."

Do you have any advice for dealing with an abusive coparent and avoiding conflict?"
Tish_EllisLPC,fdniymb,t1_fdnhz4x,"Keep all records!! Document! Document! Document!

As far as dealing with an abusive coparent, your partner has to make sure to not give into the abusive communcation or texts. Do not respond to the sarcastic comments, belittling, or negative comments always bring the conversation back to the business at hand which is the kids and their wellbeing. If the ex-husband can't be civilized then there is no compromising by your partner and he is to refer to the custody agreement in place."
Cleareyeduckfup,fdoam5e,t1_fdnhz4x,"Just to add on to what OP says, there's a guy named Bill Eddy who studies high conflict people and relationships.  He's come up with a model for communication that brings an abusive/toxic conversation back around to the point and when appropriate ends it in the favor of the more reasonable party.  The acronym is BIFF.  You keep your end of the conversation brief, informational, friendly, and firm.  It sucks all the air out of anything intended to hurt you and if they continue it just makes them look silly.  My SO was (and is) a nightmare to deal with but since I started using this method I can at least effectively communicate my piece confidently. As a bonus, her abusive tirades no longer keep me up at night wondering if I actually AM the psychologically abusive deadbeat antichrist that she insists I am.

A link with examples if you want to check it out:

Also, Bill Eddy has several excellent books out there about dealing with high conflict people.  Of the two I'm familiar with, one is simply called 'BIFF' and the other is 'So, what's your proposal?' 

Good luck to anyone who can use this information.  It's a horrible experience but there really is hope no matter what your special someone says.  If you're wondering if you are the things they accuse you of being, that usually means you're not those things."

somenicekitties,fdo20z5,t1_fdniymb,"We deal with this and while we don't give in to the abuse or engage it, our concern is when the child comes home talking about things the other parent does and says to them, we don't have a way to help with that. An example is after we bought the child new clothes for school, the other parent hid them away and said they 'couldn't find it' so they couldn't wear them, or giving the child gifts in the car on their way to our home and saying they won't have time to play with it because they have to go to our house, not engaging the child when they say positive things about our family. These actions are so subtle that even though we document them, they're not 'loud' enough for the court to acknowledge. But these things are almost constant, and the child is acting out. HC parent won't agree to therapy for the child, so we feel really stuck in regard to how to help them when the court is unwilling to enforce agreements like not disparaging us in front of the child. What do you do when the court won't listen?"

thatwhichyields,fdnnxjj,t1_fdnjhiq,"Not OP, but I have a lot of personal experience with what you’ve described.

My ex was verbally and emotionally abusive for most of our marriage, and got even worse during and after the divorce. We’re now five and a half years post-divorce, and he’s mostly calmed down (it changed a lot when I remarried last year), but I truly believe that at his core he will always be angry at/hateful towards me and thus abusive. Coparenting our son can be HARD sometimes!

First, THERAPY. I found an amazing therapist who fit my needs and personality and I committed myself to doing the work. You get out of therapy what you’re willing to put in, and I put in everything I had. I am a wholly different woman from who I was all those years ago, and I am proud of the work I have put into myself through therapy. It made me a better mom and a better person.

Second, and in conjunction with therapy- self-assessment and reflection. Your partner needs to ask herself several questions to get at the deep ‘why’ of her ex’s abuse wearing her down. Why do I care what he thinks of me? Really, seriously why- do I think his valuation of me has merit? Do I trust his judgment? Do I trust him to evaluate and judge me? What are the actual, tangible repercussions of his opinion of me? Why do I LET him have power over my emotions? And many more, but you can see the trend. Perhaps journaling could help- actually writing out the responses to the questions helps you take the emotional and sort of untangle it. Having to articulate these answers and lay them out and read and reread them can really help shift your perspective.

Third, have a PLAN!! When the abuse occurs, what happens immediately afterward? Does she need a safe hug and a few minutes to cry? Does going for a run help calm her down? A hot shower? A certain playlist? Someone safe to listen as she vents? For me, I had mantras I would repeat out loud (in private, obviously) Those were a good fit because you can’t always drop everything and go for a run or take a shower or scream and cry. “Refuse to engage” was a big one for talking myself down from the desire to respond in kind. “Thank you for reminding me yet again why divorcing you was the best choice ever!” was great for making me smile. Asking myself some of the questions from above and making myself re-answer them helped, too. All of these techniques are ways to get emotional brain to calm down and let logic brain step in. They help to get out of fight or flight mode and into healing and helping mode.

I really hope that you find something helpful in the novel I’ve typed here. I admire you for asking on her behalf- you’re supporting her beautifully by doing so. Feel free to PM me if you’d like, and I wish you all the best!"

But now we are all in our 30s, We all love each other very much. And we consider our brothers and sisters just as much family as our actual brothers or sisters. I think the key in initiating a blended family situation is showing the kids how much love there is between the two parents.

Tish_EllisLPC,fdnjvw7,t1_fdnhqy9,"Great question and insight!! Undermining would make it worse so I would look at how you can be a support for your sibilings. Spend more time with them so they know they can talk and be vulnerable with you. As far as your parents, is there one that you can speak with openly without backlash? If so I would start there. Be candid, respectful, and compassionate but also maintain the boundaries you have in place so you won't get hurt or sucked into a tug of war."

Tish_EllisLPC,fdnkei0,t1_fdnhyzu,I would do a reset with the kids. Have a routine with them when it's your parenting time. Try not to discuss the other parent or their rules and don't put down the other parent and their rules. Remind the kids that they are in a safe space with you and that your rules may be different and that it's ok.

Tish_EllisLPC,fdo13un,t1_fdnzd5g,I wouldn't worry about loose rules. Make sure that you have rules and structure in place that highlight your values and what you reasonably expect from the children. If the rules are broken ALWAYS enforce the consequences but don't have excessive punishments. It's more about your kids respecting you and you respecting and protecting them.

Always stick to the custody agreement!!"
gabeech,fdnhpgm,t1_fdngnek,"> Always stick to the custody agreement!!

I would add to this, no matter how silly it seems make sure your custody agreement is very, very specific. For example: 

Instead of ""Both parents shall have a call each night with the child at a time that they agree on"" you should write in ""Both parents shall have a call each night at 8pm unless otherwise agreed on a different time""

Also, be prepared to file contempt paperwork. Over, and over. They will call your bluff. Don't bluff."

Tish_EllisLPC,fdnmoij,t1_fdniq5m,"What does the custody agreement say about school related and extracurricular expenses? I would start there. If it's too vague and there can't be a reasonable conversation with the ex, I would look at all the activities that the children participate in throughout the year. Write them all down plus expenses put what you would pay and what the ex would pay. Send it to the ex see if that will be a catalyst for a conversation. Definitely keep the kids out of it. It will cause them to have unnecessary stress and anxiety if they feel they have to mediate between you both."

At first he went through the same process to try and get the courts to help but as these things go, it all became... a lot. He's in therapy now and my mom has been as supportive as she can be and so have my sister and I. 

My question to you is, is there any way that I as an adult, step-child help with his process of grief? I don't want to seem like I am trying to be the replacement for his own children but our relationship is pretty strong and I do not have contact with my own father, so we have connected in that capacity fairly well. I know its been a very dark time for him and I just want to help. 

I have my bachelors degree in neuroscience and one of my courses very briefly touched on this type of psychological harm - its fascinating but terrifying. Thank you for helping good people like my stepdad navigate a lot of emotional heavy lifting."
Tish_EllisLPC,fdnlo9n,t1_fdnimup,"Just be there. Commend him on getting the help he needed and encourage him to do so. If he decides to confide in you try to be objective as possible and try not to give into bashing or bad mouthing. Don't feel bad that you both have a great connection. I think that it's wonderful that you both have a strong connection. As far as his grieving process, there is not much that you can do but be supportive. You can make sure that he always has a place to be vulnerable and be aware of how he grieves. It comes in waves sometimes and some days he may be fine and others he may be struggling."

Tish_EllisLPC,fdnhl0q,t1_fdngut6,"Before I have that conversation I would look at important factors like your child's age, will she have any major changes when she is with you like transportation to and from school and activities. Are you and mom on good working terms or at least cordial? Would you be willing to ease into 50/50?

magrya2,fdnmz1t,t3_emb3u8,"Hello!

My sister is currently trying to co-parent with her ex boyfriend (together 4 years, bf had an affair and left her for another woman when their kid was 3, he just turned 5) and they are both aggressive with one another, although it was worst when they first split because of the affair but my sister has been trying to take emotion out of it lately for the sake of the child.

Her ex is not trying to improve the situation & keeps trying to take her to court to get more custody and pay less child support knowing she can't afford it as she was a stay at home mom while they were together, calls cps with false reports to harass her, won't let her speak with my nephew when he has weekend custody, verbally abuses my sister through text on a daily basis, and my nephew has started to say very negative things he has heard at his dads house about my sister and my mom (mom lives with sister to help w/bills & parenting)

Now the woman he left my sister for is now his wife and constantly disrespects my sister by claiming that she is the mother of my nephew, not my sister, wants to be involved in everything like a mother by going to soccer games and school events. They only get custody of my nephew every other weekend. My sister wants to work on coparenting but feels disrespected by his wife since she also insults her constantly & her ex says thats her fault and she will ""get respect when she earns it"". 

How should my sister best approach this situation without causing too much stress for the child? She is still hurt by the affair and knows that his new wife will be involved in his life but her ex has been telling my nephew to refer to his new wife as mom & says to my nephew that my sister is a ""bad mother"" & ""don't listen to her"" when he is with her majority of the time.
Should she pursue more co-parenting classes/mediation with her ex and include his wife or is there better ways to handle this situation based on your experience?

My experience is that for some couples with relationships that work fine otherwise having a kid introduces a huge amount of conflict because its an area where you can't just ""agree to disagree"" and compromising when you ""know"" you are right feels like not living up to your responsibility to your kid."

We have three young kids (6, 4, and 4) who are our number one priority through all of this. Two questions.  First, do you have any suggestions for making the ""exchange"" of kids as easy on them as possible? They get very emotional and clingy when one of us has to leave, and I know they are struggling.

Second - any recommended reading so that we can navigate coparenting in the future?"
AllTheLettersExcept,fdnpuf1,t1_fdnmkka,"Not OP, but have been in a position similar to yours.

Regarding transitions, our counsellor suggested that the kids transition through the schools. So Monday morning, kids say bye to Parent A, go to school, have the whole school day to mentally switch gears between households, and then go to Parent B’s house after school.

Parent A is responsible for dropping off kids items (sports equipment, etc.) to Parent B’s house before Parent B leaves for work (or whatever works for you).

No interaction, no conflict, happy kids. It’s done wonders for us."

I stayed in the marriage because I incorrectly thought a two parent family was the most important thing. 

When daughter was three she took her mothers side in our war. She began to copy her mothers behaviors which primarily was to reject me in every possible way. She spent years barely talking to me. She has gone out of her way to hurt me many times over the course of her childhood. Today she is 18 and I believe that we are what is called unbonded.

Is there any hope in this situation to cure or fix the bonds? I don’t think there are. The bonding years are over and we will never get them back. This situation I think is permanent."

My wife is one of them. Her mother divorced her father when she was 5, and basically kidnapped them (fled the state). It took many years, but she now has an awesome relationship with her Dad. They are, in fact, much closer than she and her mother (who has several behavioral/mental issues).

I found a wonderful therapist who helped me slowly get her back.  We've been reunited for 6 years now and we're closer than ever and are best friends.
TooPrettyForJail,fdp6z6c,t1_fdoza6y,"Thank you for your kind words.  I understand ""hated me more than he loved our daughter.""  I've had this thought many times.  It's terrible that anyone can think like that.  But here we are.

She was 12 when the alienation campaign began?  Your bonds had already formed.  He could not break them.

We bonded normally for her first 3 years, but that was not enough.  She could not reject me as consistently and as brutally as she did without shredding our bonds.  I realized this when she was 15 and I gave up.  I didn't tell her, I just withdrew, I stopped trying.  She didn't even notice.  (For 3 years now I've told her ""it's whatever you want it to be.  Come if you want, go if you want.  Custody is whatever you want it to be.""  Her reaction the first time I told her that was to cry.  She cried because ""I'll never see my dog again.""  Of course the dog lived with me.)

There is some hope.  3 months ago we spoke and I told her about bonding.  I suggested that she google ""unbonded child"" and that she would recognize us in her reading.  I didn't tell her that I had given up but she's very smart and I think she put it together.  

Part of what is happening now is that she has lost control of the situation.  Our old dynamic was me trying and her rejecting.  She was in control.  Now she has nothing to push against.  It shook her when she realized this.  Now she is trying.  A little bit.  Not very competently but it's something.  Maybe it will grow into something."

How would you recommend approaching a situation where my daughter (age 16) oscillates between never wanting to see her mom vs loving her and wanting to see her tons? I try to maintain a regular visitation schedule but it’s the cause of a lot of conflict depending on their current relationship status (ie: it’s usually a several month cycle of them being “great!” and me being a jerk for sticking to the schedule and not giving more time followed by a few months of them being “horrible!” and me being a jerk for sticking to the schedule and forcing her to go). 

Backstory: I as the dad have had full physical custody since she was 11 due to litigation that occurred after several years of police visits, CPS reports from the school and hospitals, etc.  We’ve tried many different family therapists (both pre and post divorce) but pretty much all of them have ended when the mom and kid both decided they were not willing to participate any longer."

1. My co-parent and I both took a course, early on, for parenting beyond conflict.  It's been several years, though; can you offer any quick insights for methods and language to ensure that conflict between us is kept away from our 5-year old son? 
2. What negotiation tips can you offer for someone who co-parents with a person whose parents have money and pay for her conflict fees, has no accountability for conflict, has an attorney who specializes in conflict, and who believes that every negotiation is a distributive one where that party must ""win""? 
3. Would there be value in a form of counseling to help us work better together, even if we can't stand being in the same room as each other?  What type of counseling would it be (that is, what would it be called?)"
Tish_EllisLPC,fdnt5hf,t1_fdns6b4,"1. Never bad-mouth or have negative body language when the coparent has triggered you. Just know that kids pick up on everything. They have some serious spidey senses.

2. Try to get a parent coordinator. in my experience, they are equipped for conflict and it doesn't include attorneys, other parents, or mediators. It just the coparents trying to work through conflict and make compromises when making decisions for the child.

3. Coparent Counseling or If you need a mediator type with a therapeutic background to help make decisions that would be a parent coordinator."

We do have a parenting coordinator right now - and have for years - but we're in our second round of custody/parenting plan evaluation and I'll try to get a parenting coordinator appointment that gives our coordinator more empowerment to help resolve conflicts between us.  Currently we're in a position where she just ignores recommendations that doesn't like, which, since she's a very-much-majority parent, usually means she's choosing to marginalize me further."

In our home we always have structure, boundaries, we never speak poorly of the other parent and we do encourage the child when they say things about the other parent or had fun with them.

BenificusAngorio,fdnu38s,t3_emb3u8,"Honestly, I have seen a ton of coparenting conflict.  A LOT.  I grew up in a pretty poor area where a lot of relationships are marred by all the trappings of poverty.  I have seen a lot of alienation by both parents.  But, occasionally I've seen one of the parties heal and stop fighting.  But it doesn't usually seem to help.

It just means that the badmouthing, destruction of gifts, etc becomes kind of one-sided and goes into high gear.  Sometimes, the kids see one parent as ""helpless"" or unwilling to fight for them.  In the long run, it's obviously not to the kids' best interest to see the fighting or be caught in the middle, but even when the behavior is egregious the only real advice they get from professionals is ""document it"".

My experience with documenting abusive behaviors just means that everything becomes business as usual except now everybody has a payment for lawyers on top of other bills.  Nobody can afford to go back to court every time something is breeched.  And most fathers outright refuse to get involved in courts, because even with a mountain of evidence all the woman has to do is tear up and say ""he's so aggressive"" and the judge will simply brush it all aside and give some plucky ""ya'll need get along for the kids"" speech.

So my question is, if a parent does heal and lets the whole thing go, how does a ""moved on"" partner deal with all the bullshit without looking like you've given up or convincing the kids that there's some kind of neglect / abandonment?"
Tish_EllisLPC,fdnwlm1,t1_fdnu38s,"I have had parents give up parental rights because of all the ""bullshit"". I understand that sometimes that decision has to be made because of years of not making headway with the courts or other parent. That does not mean you are a bad person or that you don't love your children. If you can maintain a relationship with your kids that would be ideal. I would suggest just looking at the interactions with the other parent as a business transaction. Keep convos to a minimum, if there can't be an agreement everything resorts back to the custody agreement in place."
BenificusAngorio,fdo1q6s,t1_fdnwlm1,"I appreciate you taking your time to respond.

I have seen giving up rights, infrequently.  That seems heartbreaking but in different situations it seems like the only actual way that the parent CAN heal.  Even being around the other parent seems to perpetuate and propegate the cycles of abuse or bad behavior that started the path to divorce.

I guess my follow up is how you see a healthy relationship with the kids working around these types of situations.  How the parent still maintain POSITIVE contact in alienation or abusive situations?  I don't want to sound naive, but it seems like ignoring a lot of the conflict around kids seems healthier in a lot of situations."

Isabeau208,fdp6zxn,t3_emb3u8,"Did I do everything I could have to protect my children?

I (and my children & close family) had to deal with this with my ex-husband. My ex contested custody five times over the course of ten years. The first time took over three years and consisted of psych-evals and everything that goes with. The fifth time I finally gave in when my oldest son’s councilor indicated that my child was suffering from Hyper-Vigilance, a constant fight or flight mode, and if it continued he would most likely have a psychotic break. I just couldn’t continue to let that happen. My relationship with the boys was so great, that regardless of what my ex would say they would still love me. Therefore their father would pick on other members of my family, particularly my new husband. The courts on several occasions threatened to take my ex’s parental rights away, but never did. We had to deal with police welfare checks, CPS visits and more. The only substantiated CPS reports were against my ex, but still the courts did nothing to protect my children or myself. In the end I had to walk away from my children at the ages of 13 and 15. As long as I was in the picture my ex was relentless; and at the time I thought I was doing what was best for them. It took some time, but I now have a good relationship with my boys and I think they know what really happened and don’t hold much against me for it. There are so many awful things that could share, it would take way too long to write.

rebahaze,fdnlvgv,t3_emb3u8,"My situation is very volatile with my ex, but the general synopsis is that he gets four 8-hour periods a year for two blocks each (sat-sun) and they're supervised by my dad. He's been proven to be extremely physically abusive to his step children, but I've been told I can't use their affidavits in my case. I've been following my custody agreement to the T since my child was 7 months old (now 4 years old) but I've always been terrified every visit.


He's a hard drug abuser, in a bike gang, constantly smokes in the house around her, has abandoned his three older bio children, has a lengthy violent criminal record, and many many other awful things. He doesn't even feed our child, my dad supplies everything during the visits. (Any one judging me, please don't. Our child was a ""surprise"" and I never knew any of this stuff before hand)


My question is, do you think there's a possibility that our child will be affected psychologically during her visits later on in life? I feel like I'm failing as a parent that she goes through these environments, but Child and Family Services haven't been any help and I can't afford a new lawyer."

mrmoo2002,fdou4wp,t1_fdo3v8e,">...but if the wife (or husband) left the relationship because of legitimate abuse,  it really the wisest decision for the abused spouse to pretend it's not happening just so that the children's image of their parent can be preserved?

What you call pretending can also be called keeping appropriate boundaries with children to not involve them in adult situations.

This may be tough to accept, but children still love abusive parents and--here's the tough part--children are not wrong for that love. Look up attachment theory. Why? 

1. The love is literally wired into their biology at a neurological level. You literally cannot reprogram that. Even children in foster care will run back to their abusive parents despite being exposed to abuse in their care. Think about why that's the case. It's a pointless fight against that attachment when one parent tries to convince a child to hate the other. All it does is turn the child into the rope in the parents' tug-o-war. 

2. The parent is not coping with their trauma in a healthy way by bringing a child's love into it. The abuse is no longer occuring when the parents are separated. A parent who talks to a child about their spousal abuse is doing so not for the child's best interests (protection) because the abuse no longer happens when the parents are apart. Often instead a parent does it for the parent's need to have their pain recognized. It's a deficiency of coping and support for the abused parent."
Tish_EllisLPC,fdo4by7,t1_fdo3v8e,I wouldn't say it's pretending you are just giving them (the kids) an opportunity to form their own opinions of the other parent without biased influence. I would make sure they can come and speak to me about their concerns as they arise.

She mentions that it seems like her older son (9yo) is afraid to talk about it out of fear of retaliation from the other parent.  She mentions the older child's personality more resembles her own and the ex treats him differently.

I've always had a very amiable and productive co-parenting relationship with my ex so I have no experience with this.

Anonauditor,fdp52pt,t3_emb3u8,"Do you work with any government agencies like the US state department children's affairs in any kind of training capacity?  I gotta tell ya when ones child has been taken to another nation , a huage act signatory even , just to be told that they are not suffering from parental kidnapping but parental alienation... well a smart cookie learns a whole lot real fast.  The current administration has treated me with a lot more respect than the former people I worked with from the last administration. I have in fact found my child, was never able to overcome the courts of Quebec  and while I don't have my child back the other parent has  calmed down and even brings our child to stay with me from time to time. That said our child is still not allowed to have friends outside of school . Period. 9 years old never had a sleep over never been to a sleep over never had friends come to their home , nothing.   Theirs been other issues of abuse but Canada cps told me it was a custody issue so they could not get involved. The other parent knocked out one of our child's teeth.   I'd keep our child during on of my visits but they have the Canadian custody order and I know exactly how that ending would turn out.  So , as bad as things have been for me and mine I am curious if you work with any government agencies either local or national in an educational capacity to train them on the differences between parental alienation and parental kidnapping and the dangers of both to both child and Parents? 

If it makes any statistical difference yes, I'm male."
Tish_EllisLPC,fdp6esp,t1_fdp52pt,This is very interesting. I don't work with any government agencies but I would be interested in educational trainings because people and agencies need to know how serious the issue is and that it could show up regardless if the person is Male or Female.
Anonauditor,fdp94ha,t1_fdp6esp,"With in the system, authorities,  cops and deputies often want no part in anything of this nature. The stock answer typically is ""that's a custody issue, you should hire an attorney "" in the crucial first 48 hours in one has leads they can give and trails that could be followed the police often try to avoid enforcement lest they become liable for getting it wrong. Because bad parents have no qualms about manipulating police to get revenge.  As for the statistics... when it comes to male and female roles and international kidnapping... Japan is the most non compilaint nation. They universal favor the mother. And that trend extends often to other courts. Out of over 140 nations that are part of the hauge  act, Canada is mostly compilaint save for the province of Quebec which drags the rest of Canada down to 10th non compliant hauge act nation also typically favoring mothers in custody cases regardless of any and all other factors.

I've talked my ex out of giving our child up to foster care twice now. Only because I feared losing him in their system and because I insisted I would have expected no problem taking our child if the burden was too much for her. In light of the fact that I was willing to take our child she decided she could continue to retain custody.

I think back to the sheriff's deputy that refused to take my case when I made the allegation 7 years ago.  Despite standing court orders from all County judges, state and federal laws regarding the prohibitions of taking children outside of their residence during divorce or separation.... despite it all ... when the cops refuse to do anything you're powerless if you can't help yourself.  Getting help from the office of the department of state Childress affairs , was a nightmare last administration. The new guy in charge of that department is super helpful and Johnny on the spot about doing his job right. You'll never get unanswered emails from him. And fortunately I didn't have to utilize that office a second time because like I said she changed her mind and calmed down... but of course their are still issues. All sorts of them.

You right that the issue can happen to either gender still the statistics do show that one side is favored in courts depending on the court, culture , and nation.  I support all parents suffering from this. I go to therapy and we have males and females in our groups. It can happen to anyone regardless of the averages.

But yeah .... getting law enforcement to recognize the differences between custody issues and enforcement issues... that would be a better place to live in.

Something else I work to overcome is survivors guilt so to speak. I was able to find and reconnect with mine thanks to unmitigated determination. I recognize I am one of the lucky ones. Few in my circle are able to reconnect and struggle greatly with on going PA. It is all I can do to offer ongoing support while not feeling.... trying not to feel like the asshole when I am asked how did my visit go, did you get them to try new foods, is the home life more stable? What about the friend situation... I try my best to let it all flow freely knowing that some of them still struggle to maintain or even establish contact.  

Anyways, thanks for answering my questions, and working in this field. Best of luck to you and your efforts at helping children and parents. It's good work."

Long story short i was struck by a car at 7 years old at excessive speed which threw me like a rag doll and left me with a permanent frontal lobe brain injury. A decade of straight hell passes and I'm greeted with just over $100.000 thats in a trust fund for me. Only thing is, i didn't know about any of it until the final court date. No one informed me of anything,  and i signed papers not knowing what they meant. (guardianship/conservator-ship along with others). Basically gave my mom full access and power over the account. Within 3 months all of it was gone, and everyone told me it was my fault. 20k to my brother, 14k to my grandparents, she took 20k for herself and it was all labeled as adult care and thats where the money was buried in the courts. -How can a parent conceive a child, mentally and emotionally destroy them from within.

Tish_EllisLPC,fe6cps9,t1_fe69snb,"Hey! Since you are an adult now you have the right to set boundaries and decide who you want to have a relationship with. Just know whatever you decide there will be consequences or blowback because someone will be unhappy with your choices/decisions. But know that that is ok. You are responsible and accountable for your own words, thoughts, actions not theirs. 

Also, think about the conversation you would have with the parent that made decisions to alienate you from the other parent. I think having that conversation in the future would help with your healing process."

She has Borderline Personality Disorder, and is wholesale lying to protect the secrecy of her own quirks; which are entirely unacceptable for a parent.  I escaped with my son, but my ex secured emergency temporary custody - Which she's using to help build a narrative becoming of her own wishes.

This has led me to having not seen my son since September.  Which is terrible, as I was a forced, stay-at-home dad.  I miss my son with all of my heart.  This has been devastating to me.

I don't feel that kids 4 & 6 should be at an adult's new year's eve party with drinking, pot smoking, and possibly illegal drug usage.    

I fear that giving into her demands will enable her to continue to do this to me, but I am worried she would actually take the kids to parties so i end up giving into her demands in order to protect my kids.

UselessGadget,fdnctel,t1_fdnc3ud,That notion just crossed my mind
IDWofficial,fdkxcma,t3_elwzps,Thanks for joining everyone! Heads up we are reaching our final 10 minutes in the AMA.
d1psyyyy,fdliijy,t3_elwzps,"What's your favourite show?

1987, 2003, 2012 or 2018?

Even if you like all of them, which one for you is the closest to originals?"
IDWofficial,fdll25g,t1_fdliijy,TW:  2003 will always be special to me.
Doctor-Amazing,fdlr897,t1_fdliijy,Leaving out 1997 I see. No one ever picks Next Mutation.
PatrickKane4LiFE,fdmn8b8,t1_fdll25g,"Thank you so much. 

That dark toned version of the show was incredible, hands down the best TMNT ever made."
d1psyyyy,fdmklh9,t1_fdll25g,A man of culture I see
C3POhMyyy,fdmk7qe,t1_fdlr897,It was definitely a mutation...
d1psyyyy,fdmkke8,t1_fdlr897,Never heard of it...
Doctor-Amazing,fdmlqvs,t1_fdmkke8,It was the live action one that added a 5th turtle and got rid of Shredder in the first episode.
PatrickKane4LiFE,fdmocsq,t1_fdmo43r,"The only bad part was how the shows quality turned into pure crap near the end. The animations of the characters, the characters themselves, and all the back to the sewers and other nonsense. 

But those first few seasons are undoubtedly classic. The Shredders daughter was a kickass character too."
onexbigxhebrew,fdn5dsu,t1_fdmo43r,Uhhhh wat? The amount of sexual innuendo and violence in kids shows has continued to grow.
IsItDawnYet,fdmrcin,t1_fdmo43r,Ok boomer
d1psyyyy,fdmmp50,t1_fdmlqvs,I remember live action movie and a girl-turtle. But I don't remember live action series
Wild_Marker,fdndqju,t1_fdmocsq,It ends in season 5 and there's nothing you can say to convince me otherwise.
d1psyyyy,fdmovn9,t1_fdmocsq,"Yeah. When they went to future, those episodes were OK. Not good, not bad. They were OK and enjoyable. But then, when they returned, it wasn't so fun. At least the intro was kickass"
d1psyyyy,fdn98wl,t1_fdn5dsu,"Can you give an example?

Maybe I'm confusing 4Kids cartoons with cartoons from other companies?"
buttpooperson,fdmqw26,t1_fdmmp50,You remember the girl turtle from the live action series
d1psyyyy,fdmqx40,t1_fdmqw26,"Oh, ok. I watched it only once, so I must have confused it with live action movie"
buttpooperson,fdni42i,t1_fdmqx40,It's ok. It's very bad.
Doctor-Amazing,fdotpit,t1_fdmqx40,"The first 3 episodes were put out on VHS as a sort of movie, but it was part of a longer series."
Meimnot555,fdkx7kc,t3_elwzps,Can we get a new animated series based on the current run of TMNT? It's the best since the 80s cartoon series.
IDWofficial,fdkygmk,t1_fdkx7kc,TW:  Tell Netflix you want it!  We'd love to do it!
buttpooperson,fdmqxrh,t1_fdkx7kc,Sounds like someone never watched the 03 series
carohlyn,fdkxvkf,t3_elwzps," Hi! Just want to start off saying IDW is my FAVORITE TMNT to date! Thank you both so much for all the unique stories and take on many classic and new characters. 

Regarding the epilogue and recent developments with Leatherhead (my favorite character, I might add haha) and Krang, should we expect to see an update any time soon?"
IDWofficial,fdky89i,t1_fdkxvkf,"SC: Thank you!! I don't have any immediate plans for Leatherhead and Krang, I'm still mulling them over, but they'll make a return, don't worry. Personally I'd like to save Leatherhead somehow, I love him too."
IDWofficial,fdl0sf9,t1_fdkxvkf,"TW:  I'll be addressing LeatherKrang (as all the cool kids call him now) in the TMNT 2020 Annual in June.  I'll be doing some gap-filling with him (them?) as well as Shredder, Kitsune, Karai, etc., before Sophie takes it all to the next amazing level in the ongoing. Stay tuned..."
Killcode1103,fdkrkxl,t3_elwzps,What is the most annoying executive decision that you had to deal with?
IDWofficial,fdks3zo,t1_fdkrkxl,Probably when I tried to pitch an issue with an April/Alopex pizza party and it didn't fly. -Sophie
IDWofficial,fdksvf6,t1_fdkrkxl,"TW:  Honestly, we've been lucky to have been to able to get a lot of things approved by Nick/Viacom that I never expected would get through (young Hamato boys getting executed in Feudal Japan was one), so I really can't complain.  The only time we had to make a fairly big change was the first time the TMNT went to Dimension X and I had written a scene where Raph used a laser pistol.  We were asked to remove the pistol from his hand after it was drawn (no guns for the TMNT) and replace it with his sai.  In the end, it all worked out fine, so no harm, no foul in my book."
ithrowawaay,fdl0m9x,t1_fdks3zo,Is that some kind of code for sex party?
kayonesoft,fdkwymi,t1_fdksvf6,Wouldn't want to influence young children to like dangerous weapons
IDWofficial,fdljtsg,t1_fdl0m9x,TW:  Is this Harvey Weinstein?
ithrowawaay,fdlkqlr,t1_fdljtsg,"Close, Jeffrey Epstein."
Levitus01,fdmyo56,t1_fdlkqlr,"Come to think on it... have you ever seen the two ""ey-steins"" in the same room together?"
pain-and-panic,fdmyt25,t1_fdlkqlr,"Hey, I heard you didn't kill yourself."
proverbialwhatever,fdmzioz,t1_fdlkqlr,Username checks out
molotovPopsicle,fdks3vu,t3_elwzps,"What are your thoughts about the recent movie adaptations? (post original 90's movies)

Like 'em? Hate 'em? Mixed feelings?

Would you welcome any future film adaptations of your comics?"
IDWofficial,fdksxyj,t1_fdks3vu,"SC: I actually LOVE the 2016 movie, Out of the Shadows, that's my favorite TMNT movie!! It treats the Turtles really well and gives them all a wide emotional range. I'd love to see an IDW-based movie, especially if they hired me to work on it. >:)"
IDWofficial,fdktn40,t1_fdks3vu,"I actually liked the first Michael Bay movie -- thought it was fun... both familiar yet unique.  Honestly haven't seen the second one, though.  Personally, besides the first TMNT movie, my fave is the 2007 CGI movie.  It really inspired my take on the TMNT, as did the 4kids series.  And I'd LOVE to see IDW TMNT adapted someday to film or TV!"
merelyadoptedthedark,fdlf54z,t1_fdksxyj,What did you think about the recent Batman vs Ninja Turtles animated movie?
Anotherban,fdlre1c,t1_fdlf54z,WOAH WOAH! I totally forgot that was a thing. I need to go check it out. Though I haven't really seen anything TMNT since the 90s. Though a few months ago i did come across this little booklet of TMNT characters and descriptions. It was kind of like a culture shock. Everything being so different.
merelyadoptedthedark,fdlxxh2,t1_fdlre1c,"It was really good, very tongue in cheek...having fun with the characters while still staying true to them.

Felt like it could have been a Batman Brave and Bold movie."
IDWofficial,fdl1iy1,t3_elwzps,"Thank you so much for all the questions, you guys!!! I have to get back to work but I'll check back here periodically through the rest of the day if you guys want to ask anything else. :)

\-Sophie"
Blambson78,fdksah1,t3_elwzps,Love your work! What got you into Turtles? Had you always wanted to work on the book or were you sought out? Can't wait read more.
IDWofficial,fdktfau,t1_fdksah1,"SC: Thanks! I got into Turtles when I was little, I liked the toys but what really turned me into a fan was the Palladium ""TMNT & Other Strangeness"" tabletop RPG book and the old Mirage comics. I actually did some work for Mirage TMNT before the Viacom/Nickelodeon sale, so I was pretty much banging down IDW's door."
llikegiraffes,fdktkyt,t1_fdktfau,Bad Moon Rising was awesome!
Blambson78,fdkzild,t1_fdktfau,That is rad! I remember that book! So cool.
Thatdewd57,fdkzjv7,t3_elwzps,I was an absolute fanboy when I was kid and just wanted to say thank you for this. What is your favorite pizza?
IDWofficial,fdlac8w,t1_fdkzjv7,TW:  I like each and every kind of pizza... as long as there are no black olives on it.  Blech!
IDWofficial,fdkzvsm,t1_fdkzjv7,SC: I usually like plain old cheese pizza with some onions but honestly I'll eat just about any pizza without olives on it.
BitterAngryMei,fdlh2bb,t1_fdlac8w,Blech olives.
Cocomorph,fdnfpnf,t1_fdkzvsm,You both need to discover the joys of Kalamata olives. 🥰
moxie79,fdksvwg,t3_elwzps,"Tom, what was your favorite moment in the series? 

Sophie, what is your dream moment you hope to include?

Thanks!"
IDWofficial,fdku2ag,t1_fdksvwg,"Wow!  That's a tough one.  There were so many moments that meant the world to me, but two that pop out for me is when the TMNT reunited with their mom (Tang Shen) in TMNT/Ghostbusters 2... and when Hamato Yoshi (Splinter) finally found peace with Tang Shen in TMNT #100.  The candy bar moment between Mikey and Slash just before Slash sacrificed himself was a tearjerker to write (Bobby Curnow's idea... damn you, Curnow!).  Also notable were finishing TMNT #5 (where we reveal the reincarnation origin) and TMNT #50 (rooftop battle between Splinter and Shredder) because those were two beats I'd planned from day one and was nervous as hell about making them land properly... and I felt like we did.  And, of course, Jennika's mutation!  Lots of favorites!"
IDWofficial,fdkvghr,t1_fdksvwg,"SC: Maybe introducing Tokka & Rahzar, but also getting to introduce some GAY relationships. >:)"
moxie79,fdkydih,t1_fdku2ag,I love how excited you are about these moments. Thank you!
Cheerfordonut,fdn293b,t1_fdkvghr,Who are you picking for the gay relationships?
gangreen424,fdn6ey8,t1_fdkvghr,"> Maybe introducing Tokka & Rahzar

This would be *awesome*. I actually thought one of the Slash clones in the Citty at War arc was going to end up as Tokka!

[Issue #101] >!I think the Mutant Zone would be a great way to introduce these two, and some other old fan favorites too. Mona Lisa was a great start!!<"
kendamuZ,fdlah96,t1_fdkvghr,"YES!! VERY YES!! TMNT NEEDS MORE GAY!! -- Josie

Also, Sophie, you changed my life for the better in ways I'm still paying forward to others. Thank you for being so amazing!!"
moxie79,fdky3sd,t1_fdkvghr,"Ooh, yes to both! Thank you!"
RavingDragon22,fdkw8sa,t1_fdkvghr,Awesome! For both things!
Wonsavage,fdkx5yo,t1_fdkvghr,Make everyone else in the comic gay but please don't break up the Alopex and Raph OTP. They're too cute together!
kcwilsonart,fdks3ht,t3_elwzps,"Thank you both for doing this AMA! I'm a huge turtle fan and have every TPB for this IDW run so far, including micro- and macro-series. It's such great stuff. Thank you for your work on the iconic run, Tom! Sophie, your issue 101 impressed me enough that I subscribed for single issues just to show support for the new wave. I'm so excited to read what you're bringing to the story!

As a semi-professional comic artist, I'm curious: what do each of you look for in an artist or collaborator?"
IDWofficial,fdktg8x,t1_fdks3ht,"TW:  Speaking editorially, I love to see professional PDFs showing samples of both pin-up and sequential work -- pretty pictures are nice, but we really need to see your story-telling chops, too.   And when it comes to working on licensed work, creators need to be flexible and have thick skins -- you really need to be able to roll with the punches when working on properties that are owned by big companies."
IDWofficial,fdkst4n,t1_fdks3ht,"SC: Thank you!! It's hard for me to articulate what I keep an eye out for when it comes to people I might be working with, I really tend to trust my gut reaction and the vibe I get from them. Sometimes it's wrong but most of the time if I have a good feeling about a person, things will work out well."
kcwilsonart,fdku8yg,t1_fdktg8x,Thanks for answering! I'll keep polishing my sequential chops. :)
kcwilsonart,fdkt0l5,t1_fdkst4n,Thanks for your reply!
IDWofficial,fdkw5k2,t1_fdku8yg,Woot woot!  And thanks for subscribing -- I love hearing when fans pre-order our books!!!
mattBernius,fdks9dd,t3_elwzps,"Sophie, apologies that this question has nothing to do with TMNT, but hey, this is an AMA -- 

Can you share anything about the Swamp Thing pitch you made that almost happened (you mentioned it on twitter a few days ago)? What was your approach/take going to be?"
IDWofficial,fdktasy,t1_fdks9dd,"SC: I'll have to look through the archives on my old computer and find the concept art I did and post some of it. It was going to be a new character, it wasn't Alec Holland, and be totally unrelated to any other Swamp Thing continuity. It followed a scientist experimenting with totipotent cancer cells and attempting to cure her own liver cancer, and she ended up getting into a car accident and flung into the swamp where the stem cells in her body merged with swamp matter (as well as leaking out into the swamp and creating cancerous tumor mutants!). It was more body horror than the usual Swamp Thing stuff, like the character's transformation into a monster was more slow and disgusting like The Fly."
mattBernius,fdku3f7,t1_fdktasy,That sounds amazing!
joilant,fdktelc,t3_elwzps,You got oozed! What would you like to be VS what would you actually be?
IDWofficial,fdkv9kz,t1_fdktelc,"SC: I'd love to be a bird mutant of some kind so I could fly, but I'd probably end up just being a mutant sea cucumber."
IDWofficial,fdkv8c6,t1_fdktelc,I'd like to get oozed and suddenly be rich!  But I'd probably just end up a mutant mutt.  :)
tcohboy,fdkxe8e,t3_elwzps,2 toes? Or 3? The world must know!!
IDWofficial,fdkxmoh,t1_fdkxe8e,SC: I prefer 2.
ItsTheRocketeer,fdkrvxh,t3_elwzps,"Hi Sophie and Tom!  


Since IDW TMNT has been a fantastic amalgam of all incarnations of the franchise, are there any plans to adopt anything from Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?"
IDWofficial,fdksapl,t1_fdkrvxh,"I've only seen a couple clips from Rise, actually, that's it! :O I like the magical weapons, maybe I'll steal that. -Sophie"
IDWofficial,fdkt4fx,t1_fdkrvxh,"TW:  As far as cherrypicking from RISE for our series, I'll leave that in Sophie's very capable hands."
IDWofficial,fdksyo3,t1_fdkrvxh,TW:  We've actually done quite a few RISE comics already.  Fun stuff!
CrispyBrownWaffle,fdkt9p7,t3_elwzps,You have a ton of amazing TMNT fan content. How open have the editors been of you putting your original ideas into the comics?
IDWofficial,fdkuq8u,t1_fdkt9p7,"SC: VERY open, actually! It's been a really nice surprise, I thought for sure all my dumb fan-ish ideas would be shot down but so far it's been great. >:D"
100-rings,fdkteie,t3_elwzps,"Sophie, if you could write a TMNT/Gamera crossover comic, which villains would you include to bring them together?"
IDWofficial,fdkv6yr,t1_fdkteie,"SC: Terrorpin, Legion, and Jiger."
100-rings,fdkvdce,t1_fdkv6yr,Oh Jiger is an excellent choice!
IDWofficial,fdkvp9c,t1_fdkvdce,SC: Jiger would be great because she can shoot out mini-Jigers that the Turtles could tangle with (and of course keep one as a pet sidekick).
LordFluffy,fdkuyh8,t3_elwzps,"What is the best and worst thing about stepping into an established IP?

If you could have the Turtles do a crossover with any other character, licensing be damned, who would it be and why?"
IDWofficial,fdkw1qt,t1_fdkuyh8,"TW:  For me, the worst thing was that I had to work with Kevin Eastman -- I was terrified!  I had this crazy new origin idea (reincarnation) and I was thinking, ""Who the heck am I to think I have a right to show this to the co-creator of TMNT?""  Turns out, the BEST THING about stepping in to TMNT was... Kevin Eastman!  He turned out to be on the nicest, most genuine, and loving persons I've ever met in my life.  We hit it off instantly (he loved the reincarnation idea) and have been like brothers from other mothers ever since!

And speaking of Kevin, he and I both drool constantly over the thought of doing a TMNT/Daredevil crossover!  Think about it -- TMNT, Daredevil, the Foot, the Hand, Shredder, Elektra, Splinter, Stick... oh, man, how cool would that be?!"
IDWofficial,fdkw0jo,t1_fdkuyh8,"SC: The best thing about it is getting to work with characters you already love and have a vision for, and the worst thing about it is angry fans and the restrictions of what you can do with the property (not that the restrictions are always bad, working within them is its own kind of fun challenge, but sometimes it's frustrating when you have a big great idea that you're not allowed to do!!).

I want to a see TMNT/Jem & the Holograms crossover and I could do an adaptation of the dreaded Coming Out of Their Shells tour!!! >:D"
RavingDragon22,fdkvvah,t3_elwzps,If you could do an epic cross over with any existing property (similar to TMNT/Ghostbusters) what property would it be and why?
IDWofficial,fdkwuld,t1_fdkvvah,SC: Jem & the Holograms!!!
_welcomehome_,fdm4755,t1_fdkvvah,Make sure to check out the TMNT/Power Rangers crossover.
RavingDragon22,fdkx0d6,t1_fdkwuld,"I missed that one when I was little but I know there is a HUGE fan base, you should pitch it, bring in more readers! :D"
-MutantLivesMatter-,fdntja7,t1_fdkwuld,Turtles with Rainbow Brite please. I'd love to see them ally (or fight) Lurky and Murky Dismal
IDWofficial,fdkxhoh,t1_fdkx0d6,SC: Especially since I drew the Jem comic reboot a few years back. ;)
King_Toasty,fdkvxtv,t3_elwzps,"Great job on the comics so far, it's easily been my favorite incarnation of the turtles! Are there any characters from other adaptations not currently in the IDW run that you'd like to implement?"
IDWofficial,fdkwc8b,t1_fdkvxtv,TW:  I always wanted Keno (from TMNT II: Secret of the Ooze) to meet Woody Dirkins.  A pizza delivery guy crossover!
IDWofficial,fdkwsr4,t1_fdkvxtv,"SC: Tokka & Rahzar, Terrorpin, and Shadow Jones."
IDWofficial,fdkxedr,t1_fdkwc8b,SC: I love Keno!!!
joilant,fdkwtla,t1_fdkwc8b,Oh my god! From a Filipino fan I would adore you forever if Keno made it in!
alessa_dc,fdkwscj,t3_elwzps,Will we see Karai again soon? After #50 she was MIA for a long time and I was excited to get her back in the story.
IDWofficial,fdkxd4s,t1_fdkwscj,"SC: I have some plans for her, don't worry! I don't think she'll be a major character but the Foot is still around so she'll show up."
Nipperkid,fdkwy08,t3_elwzps,I have a Donatello ceramic cookie jar in box. Both signed by the Kevin Eastman.  How would I get this authenticated? Plan to keep in family.
IDWofficial,fdkxqql,t1_fdkwy08,SC: Mail it to me.
Nipperkid,fdky7m3,t1_fdkxqql,Hehe =P
Vscout44,fdkxqhc,t3_elwzps,"Any chance for Tokka, Rahzar and Keno to make an appearance in main continuing series? *forgive me if any if this has happened already, i have a giant back log to reqd"
IDWofficial,fdkxwh2,t1_fdkxqhc,"SC: I ALMOST had Tokka & Rahzar in there (you can see concept art of them on my Patreon! plug: [https://www.patreon.com/mooncalfe](https://www.patreon.com/mooncalfe)) but it didn't work out. :( I'd also love to introduce Keno but I think the characters who were played by actors (Keno, Tatsu, etc.) are iffy because of likeness issues. I'll have to check though."
joilant,fdky14u,t1_fdkxwh2,The Rise IDW actually has a Keno likeness in one of its issues! Maybe they would know? They had a Klunk cameo in the same issue.
Rootbeer48,fdkxvam,t3_elwzps,did you have any say/part in the TMNT nes game that was difficult ?
IDWofficial,fdkz5hb,t1_fdkxvam,"TW:  No.  But I did write the story/screenplay for the TMNT: Mutants In Manhattan video game, as well as the TMNT: Brothers Unite iOS game (that tied in to the Michael Bay movies).  Both were very fun and the Mutants In Manhattan game used designs based on Mateus Santolouco's fantastic IDW TMNT run.  Closest we've come to animated IDW TMNT at this point (and the voice actors were great!)."
IDWofficial,fdkyh92,t1_fdkxvam,"SC: No, I was a child at the time."
Rootbeer48,fdl0m8m,t1_fdkz5hb,wow. thanks for the reply.
Wonsavage,fdl1m8j,t1_fdkz5hb,I'm sad Mutants in Manhattan wasn't better received cause I would love to see games set in the IDW universe. You should pitch a Dynasty Warriors clone. Seems everyone gets one of those these days.
Wonsavage,fdl1oyu,t1_fdkyh92,That's no excuse.
CynicalSheep34,fdn9x0b,t1_fdl1oyu,Lmao
elebrin,fdkxwgz,t3_elwzps,"How much pizza do you get through per issue? How long does it actually take to take a book from the start of the writing process to ready to print, and what does that process look like from a writer's perspective?"
IDWofficial,fdkybf9,t1_fdkxwgz,SC: About a month but preferably longer so it's not such a scramble.
hogbadge,fdkyt6b,t3_elwzps,For Sophie: Hello! I'm SO excited to see where you take the story from now on! also for Jennika and Mona Lisa to be part of the IDW gang! Do you have plans of introducing even more lady mutants into the story?
IDWofficial,fdkz2o5,t1_fdkyt6b,"SC: Thanks!! I do, yes! The mutant porcupine who shows up at the end of #101 is a lady, her name is Diamond, and there are a few more in store, too. ;)"
SmokiestDrip,fdkzkdt,t3_elwzps,The original TMNT was kinda dark.  They lightened it up to sell toys and stuff in the 90's.  Any chance we may see a darker story with the turtles in the future for all the grown up TMNT fans?
IDWofficial,fdkzzbi,t1_fdkzkdt,"SC: The old Mirage comics are what I grew up on, I'd love to tell some darker stuff like that but I don't think they'll let me have the Turtles murdering people anytime soon, unfortunately."
buttpooperson,fdmr1gt,t1_fdkzkdt,Have you not read TMNT bodycount? That was literally the premise
wysht,fdp4f8l,t1_fdmr1gt,Is consider Bodycount a part of the original comic run though.
buttpooperson,fdp81pa,t1_fdp4f8l,The original run was one issue lol bodycount came out in 97
wysht,fdpcjxo,t1_fdp81pa,"Ah. See I think of anything that came out from Mirage as part of the original run, not just the first issue. Bodycount is a bit of a grey area by this criteria true, but given Kevin Eastman's involvement, plus the fact the first issue was published by Mirage (as Casey Jones and Raphael #1), and that it was originally planned that the full series would come out like that (and only changed because of the deal with Image), to me Bodycount is part of the Mirage era."
buttpooperson,fdpq2at,t1_fdpcjxo,It wasn't a great one but it was super fun. Raph going bananas with the triceraton machine guns was definitely dope as fuck. If you don't expect high art and just want some good violent entertainment it's totally worth the read.
coryrenton,fdkzuut,t3_elwzps,What's the best signing you ever had? What made it the best? What should other venues do to make sure you have a great signing experience (and what do they often trip up on)?
IDWofficial,fdl0tbm,t1_fdkzuut,"SC: I did one at a comic store in Ithaca NY years ago that was really great, I thought for sure nobody would show up but the shop owner really pushed the signing and the turn-out was impressive. There wasn't any point I was left just sitting there with nothing to do."
coryrenton,fdl11f3,t1_fdl0tbm,Who is the least likely fan of your work that you encountered at a signing?
IDWofficial,fdlk1sa,t1_fdl11f3,"TW:  Actually, I've learned that TMNT fans come in all shapes, sizes, colors, creeds, genders, religions, you name it!  It's pretty damn amazing and it always makes me smile."
hoplias,fdl0zr9,t3_elwzps,What are the routes you can advise for aspiring comic artists to take?
IDWofficial,fdl1f2w,t1_fdl0zr9,"SC: Besides practicing a lot, be friendly and approachable, and make friends!"
IDWofficial,fdlapxp,t1_fdl0zr9,"TW:  Work, work, work... and work some more.  Be professional.  Develop thick skin.  Take and appreciated constructive criticism.  Don't hide your work -- let people see it.  Work some more..."
ifelsedowhile,fdl99w6,t3_elwzps,"If you ever introduce a new turtle, what renaissance artist are you gonna name him after?"
IDWofficial,fdlk6or,t1_fdl99w6,TW:  David Bowie.
IDWofficial,fdlbs31,t1_fdl99w6,SC: It would be a girl named Artemisia.
Qazsedcftgb2,fdn358f,t1_fdlk6or,Yes please.
virtueavatar,fdljgwj,t1_fdlbs31,With what weapon?
JenniferDeanHolmes,fdlbku4,t3_elwzps,There are so many girls in the world today is it possable to bring back RAINBOW BRITE ? NOT that i dont love the turtles because i do...
TheBunkerKing,fdmqqxy,t3_elwzps,"Will legendary NHL enforcer Tie Domi be making an appearance in future TMNT projects? He already looks like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, so he'd be perfect."
SGFTI,fdkvx5v,t3_elwzps,"Do you hate ""Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" as much as I do?

I like most incarnations, or can at least tolerate them(Michael Bay), but man is that show just awful. It has no redeeming qualities."
IDWofficial,fdl9rqz,t1_fdkvx5v,"TW:  I personally think it's a lot of fun and I absolutely admire the passion the creators are putting into it.  But that's the beauty of TMNT -- we have so many different versions we can choose from.  If one doesn't suit your fancy, there's always another that just might."
M0ndmann,fdl216q,t3_elwzps,Why does the franchise suck so much since the new shows started? Especially since it was so good back in the days
M0ndmann,fdl9c7j,t1_fdl8ufv,"Well at least most of it. Yes. I mean the fact that they changed the design and made it that childish is one part of making it suck and that is happening in most parts of the franchise so yeah...pretty much. Also, the tv show is the most important part of the franchise so yes again."
IDWofficial,fdlbxva,t1_fdl9c7j,SC: The show is the least important part.
joilant,fdmby9t,t1_fdlbxva,"As another 87 fan I know said, Rise is simply retreading the route the first cartoon went by being reviled by the serious/edgy comic fans, while actually being extremely beginner friendly and having its niche for a good reason (dude, that animation! those sweet character dynamics not tied to being sad or angry!) Despite being lighthearted, its writing is deeper than most people give it credit for, most obvious from the episode Bug Busters onward. The turtles fandom has had a serious case of the unpleasable back even in the OG, have you seen the Mirage hate letters Eastman shared without comment? And if Rise is not your thing, another canon will come eventually. TMNT will be fine!"
Whycertainly,fdkv764,t3_elwzps,"I'm a huge TMNT collector... Are either of you collectors? If so, What's your favorite TMNT item? Either way Thanks for the great work and time you put into the series!"

Whycertainly,fdkw54p,t1_fdkvtmu,Very cool!
stephengomez1982,fdkvoo3,t3_elwzps,"Hi Sophie - I’ve loved all the turtle stuff you have done so far. Your cover for the Leo Micro and for #30 are two of my favorite TMNT images ever! Can’t wait for your run!!

Hi Tom - I was wondering when we can expect more news about TMNT: The Last Ronin?"
IDWofficial,fdli1x2,t1_fdkvoo3,TW:  Look for new TMNT: The Last Ronin info soon!  Very excited about what we've got in store for everyone...
IDWofficial,fdkvrdq,t1_fdkvoo3,SC: Thank you so much!!
llikegiraffes,fdkwnr3,t3_elwzps,Tom- Were you nervous when issue #44 released (Donatello incident) and how the fans might react? Was that a challenge to get approved? I think it's one of the more implied graphic moments in all of TMNT.
IDWofficial,fdkybuf,t1_fdkwnr3,"TW: I honestly was so nervous about issue #50 being perfect that when #44 was released, I expected folks to be surprised... but not to the level they were.  Fans still bring it up more than anything else to this day.  Nickelodeon was awesome (as always) during the approval process.  They knew the moment had to be impactful, so as long as we kept the graphic nature of the scene within reason, they were fully supportive of what we had planned.  And then Cory Smith comes in and gives us the most amazing, heart-wrenching and terrifying depiction, showing us just enough to be genuinely horrified  -- he and colorist Ronda Pattison and letterer Shawn Lee really deserve most of the credit for how amazing that scene is."

IDWofficial,fdkxjqi,t1_fdkxer1,SC: I'm not sure what the situation is with that but I'd love some IDW figures too!!
Love_Dispenser,fdkxm6r,t3_elwzps,"Sophie, you were a fan artist once, what happens when a fan goes pro? Did you have to scrub all your old work off the internet?

swordbringer33,fdl0ia2,t3_elwzps,"This question is for Tom Waltz. Here it is: Have you ever been interested in working on a TMNT movie, whether it's live-action or animated that also takes inspiration from IDW's TMNT series?"
IDWofficial,fdl7b40,t1_fdl0ia2,"TW:  Absolutely!  Kevin and I continue to encourage (nag, bug, bribe) Nickelodeon often and non-stop into letting us do animated movies/series based on the IDW TMNT.  Hopefully they'll get sick of us and give in eventually.  LOL!"

Tough-Caregiver,fdnnz8b,t1_fdl4901,"Check out Toys that Made Us on netflix, or the 'turtle power' documentary.

Short version: two artist buddies were having a laugh and one asked 'if bruce lee were an animal... whats the worst animal he could be' so it was decided a turtle would be the worst.

Ninjitsu replaced Kung Fu as the hot martial art of the 80s, and when TMNT started it was a parody of Daredevil, which feature The Hand ninja clan."
Dreamingemerald,fdl5des,t3_elwzps,"I grew up with TMNT the cartoon, played all the arcade and console games, had the masks and plastic weapons for Raph and Donatello, and had the Bus and Blimp toys, but I never got into the comics until I was older and read the webcomics Ninja Turtles Gaiden.

Answering questions now, when I would need to do hours of research to figure out what the heck is with comics about presumably Turtle-Defending ninjas that I might be interested in is less optimal.

(Do the ninjas protect the turtles, throw them, or is it an acronym maybe? ... )"
kcwilsonart,fdll5hl,t1_fdlkp5r,"Giving the benefit of the doubt that you're not trolling, they are turtles who were mutated into humanoid form, then taught ninjutsu by a similarly mutated rat. There's a lot more story surrounding that, it's a franchise that's been popular since the early 1980s with multiple cartoon series, movies, video games, and comic books. You don't need to research for hours. A simple Google search of any of those titles should do. Have a great night!"
omniuni,fdlll5j,t1_fdll5hl,Oh. I think I've heard of that. I think I thought someone was pulling my leg. But this is a thing...
kcwilsonart,fdllrzx,t1_fdlll5j,"Yep, a surprisingly good thing too. The comic Tom and Sophie have been writing for IDW is one of the best representations of the series, and I encourage you to check it out."

McJumbos,fdldeg8,t3_elwzps,what was going through your mind when IDW approached you to work with TMNT? And what were you doing?
IDWofficial,fdljg2b,t1_fdldeg8,"TW:  I was sitting in an editorial meeting at IDW when our CEO Ted Adams announced that Kevin Eastman wanted to help us create the new IDW TMNT series... and that we needed a writer to work with him.  I was thinking, ""Man, that'd be a cool gig,"" when IDW Editor in Chief Chris Ryall asked me if I wanted to do it.  I about fell out of my chair.  :)  I couldn't say ""yes"" fast enough. The rest is history."

IDWofficial,fdlkgk9,t1_fdlfp1v,TW:  It's a myth that Kevin didn't/doesn't like Venus.  I just think the way she was presented fell short for some folks.
precita,fdlfzvu,t3_elwzps,"I have a question and thoughts on how you guys handled Agent Bishop. 4kids Bishop was loved and a great character due to the shades of gray he had, he wasn't really a villain, yet not a nice guy either. The shows writers developed him through the series to clearly show he wanted to protect Earth from mutants and aliens at all costs, but was also open to working with the Turtles and saw eye to eye with them when there was a bigger threat (like the mutant outbreak in Season 4, or when Shredder/Ch'rell was trying to take over with the Demons in Season 5)

Do you feel you got enough mileage out of IDW Bishop? Besides that, I'm kinda disappointed that Bishop seemed so ""evil"" for the lack of better word in IDW, and lacked the nuances the 4kids version had. Like had Bishop survived passed issue 100, it's hard to ever seen this Bishop working with the Turtles or becoming an uneasy ally like the 4kids version.

Just want to see some thoughts on this since I know Tom Waltz you really liked Bishop in the 4kids show."

It's really tough juggling all the characters, but I'm trying to streamline the cast a bit (for a while at least, I don't want it seeming too weird when certain characters are gone for too long) and get back to focusing more on the Turtles themselves. It's hard because I love the supporting characters too and I agree that they need more spotlight, so you'll probably get your wish.

llikegiraffes,fdksb87,t3_elwzps,"  Hi Tom and Sophie! Thanks for doing this AMA. I am a huge TMNT fan (and plug for our TMNT subreddit, /r/TMNT).

Tom, a few questions for you:

1. You were involved with 100 issues of TMNT, which is a long time. What was something that surprised you that fans were attracted to, disliked, or generally shocked you during your run? 

2. there are many of us TMNT fans that would love to see some IDW folks come out to East Coast sometime for conventions. Do you think you will ever make it out this way?

3. Could you elaborate a bit about how you foresaw Jennika? Had you always wanted a 5th Turtle to be added and were you just waiting for the right time? On that note, did you plan Jennika (the human) to become a turtle since her initial #51 appearance?

Sophie, can’t wait to see more of you on TMNT! A question for you as well:

1. Who is your personal favorite turtle or character to work on for TMNT?

2. With you taking over at #101, what would you say to anyone on here who hasn’t read TMNT? Is #101 a good jumping on point?"
IDWofficial,fdkxoco,t1_fdksb87,"TW:  

1.  Honestly, the biggest shocker was the reaction to Donnie nearly getting killed in issue #44.  We knew it was going to get some attention, but we never expected the tidal wave from fans and the media.  I even got death threats for ""killing Donatello.""  It was crazy!  To this day, fans at cons still tell us they're mad at us for doing that.  :)
2. I'd love to come out to the East Coast (or anywhere in the U.S./World, really).  It's just a matter of getting invited by the cons, which unfortunately doesn't happen for me that often.  I think my ugly mug must scare the con organizers.  Heh.
3. I always wanted the 5th female TMNT -- and I always knew how I wanted her mutation to come about -- but I didn't know it was going to be Jennika until after I ready Brahm Revel's awesome Jennika origin story in TMNT Universe.  Jenny was intended to be a throwaway/plot-point character in #51 and #52, but something about her immediately appealed to me, so I decided to keep her around to develop her.  When I saw Brahm's origin tale, it immediately clicked in my head that SHE was the one.  That's when I started secretly working with Sophie on her turtle design and started pitching the idea to Kevin, Bobby, and Nickelodeon.  Once everyone was on board, it was just a matter of finding the right place in our story to make it happen -- and ""City At War"" ended up giving us the perfect opportunity.  It was all very kismet, I have to say, as has many things been on this series."
IDWofficial,fdktq06,t1_fdksb87,"SC: 1. My favorite Turtle is usually Leo, I seem to have the most ideas for him, but my favorite character to draw and write overall is probably Koya. She's so fun. 2. I think #101 is a pretty good jumping on point but of course there's a lot that happened in the previous 100 issues and I'm still continuing from that, so there's going to be some stuff that's confusing for new readers. I'm trying to give it a new, exploratory feel though, like giving new readers the lay of the land, so to speak."
jacknack1,fdksttk,t3_elwzps,"Having not started reading the IDW TMNT until recently, is 101 a good jumping on point for anyone trying to start reading what’s going on now?"
IDWofficial,fdktso0,t1_fdksttk,"SC: I'd like to think so! It's going to be a little confusing because it's continuing what happened in the first 100 issues, but it's as fresh a start as it's going to be. ;)"
alessa_dc,fdkszol,t3_elwzps,Do you have arcs planned for all five turtles or are you sort of still feeling out their individual paths?
IDWofficial,fdktyo7,t1_fdkszol,"SC: I'm still feeling them out a bit, but I have the most concrete ideas for Jennika's arc out of all the characters, since she's a new addition (she's been around as a human for 50 issues but her life as a mutant turtle has just started!)."

IDWofficial,fdkuamb,t1_fdkt2h3,"I was in the Marines in late 80s/early 90s -- part of that time in Desert Storm -- so I really didn't get much pop culture at that time.  I came into the TMNT via my kids (eldest with the Fred Wolf series on VHS, and the youngest via the 4kids series).  The 4kids series and the 2007 CGI movie really turned me on to the property... and later I did a dive into the classic Mirage comics run."
IDWofficial,fdkuamd,t1_fdkt2h3,"SC: I still remember when I first read TMNT #6 when I was a kid and there's a part where Leonardo says ""kick some ass"" and I was like 9 years old so I thought I'd get in trouble if my parents found out I was reading a comic with SWEAR WORDS in it."
PhobosRa,fdkt2pq,t3_elwzps,"I've got a handful for you! 

1) Before working on TMNT, who was your favourite Turtle? How about after? What changed it if anything?

2) Besides anything you may already have added, whats the mutant animal you'd like to see most? 

3) Power Rangers and TMNT is the latest crossover, do you know if any others are already planned? What crossover would you like to work on the most?"
IDWofficial,fdkulux,t1_fdkt2pq,"SC:

1. I think I would've said Raphael before working on TMNT, and Leonardo after. I always loved Leo and there were times when I was a kid that I'd say he was my fave, but working professionally on him as a character made it click for me.
2. A mutant thorny devil lizard!! Or a mutant polar bear.
3. I'm not involved with the Power Rangers stuff at all, so I don't know about that one. I think a TMNT/Jem & the Holograms crossover would be pretty good."
IDWofficial,fdkze7d,t1_fdkt2pq,"TW:

1.  Before working on TMNT, I always liked Leo best.  Now, I love 'em all like my own kids -- no favorites.  
2. Hmm... I have a pack of huskies at my house (so many dogs, so much hair), so maybe a Mutant Husky.
3. No other crossovers that I'm aware of, but my dream is TMNT/Daredevil someday!"
PhobosRa,fdkvviu,t1_fdkulux,"OMG I would buy that crossover instantly and I love that idea! 

Thank you!"
tcohboy,fdkt7so,t3_elwzps,"First, so many thanks to Tom for bringing this series to my kids and I. We’re bonding over one of my childhood loves, and you helped make that happen! Your writing arc was phenomenal!

Second, thank you to Sophie for your incredible contributions! Absolutely love your art (have a tattoo by you already!), and can’t wait to see what direction you take the team.

Now, a question for either/both of you...what is your professional take on what many of us consider the “variant craze” that has been happening with comics in general lately. TMNT was hit hard, especially with issues 95-100. As a fan who has collected the books since the early Mirage era, it felt like a slap to the face to learn that I’d have to buy over 30 books for a single issue just to consider the collection “complete”, not to mention the artificial rarity that some retailers tried to force by destroying printer copies and sharply increasing the price for the supposed “limited amount” left.

I know neither of you are responsible for that in any way, but I was wondering what that feels like, as a creator, to see happening with what you’ve done.

Side question for Tom - when you initially started the writing process for the turtles and were brought on, how far into your arc did you already have mapped out? When did the story start to create itself, or did it at all?

Thanks again to you both!!!"
IDWofficial,fdkv2fs,t1_fdkt7so,"HA!  Variants.  We get that question/complaint a lot at IDW... not just for TMNT.  Honestly, I don't have an answer -- it's really a matter of supply and demand.  We supply the demand.  As crass as this may sound (and I don't intend it to), if folks weren't buying them, we wouldn't be making them.  As an editor, I can tell you having multiple covers on a single issue (especially the amount we had for #100) can be a logistical nightmare (poor Bobby was practically pulling his hair out wrangling all the covers for #100), but we have a bottom-line to consider and variants and exclusives are part of that concern for now.  

When I first came on as writer, I had a fairly clear plan for the first 12 issues (including the TMNT/Splinter reincarnation origin and Shredder resurrection reveal) as well as major beats I wanted to hit over the course of the series should I make it that far (at the time, I thought I'd get kicked off after 4 issues LOL).  Those beats were:  Splinter kills Shredder.  Splinter takes over Foot Clan.  Splinter sacrifices himself.  The TMNT are joined by a 5th female TMNT.  I'm happy to report we hit all those beats.... and so many more cool things that evolved organically over our years of storytelling.  And I lasted more than 4 issues -- woot woot!   

And thank you for the praise.  It was definitely a team effort -- I was just one spoke in a might wheel.  And all us spokes are ecstatic that you and your kiddos enjoyed it!"
IDWofficial,fdkv44p,t1_fdkt7so,"SC: Omg that's such an honor that you have a tattoo of my work, thank you!! That's amazing. I'm not usually crazy about the number of variant covers, myself, I'm not a collector so I don't buy them all or anything but I get that it can be a problem economically, not to mention the feeling that it's milking completists for their money.

On the other hand, variants are a great way for different artists to get a shot at drawing something official for TMNT, and I've had friends who finally got their chance on one of the variants for #100 or whatever and seeing how happy and proud they are makes all the variants worth it. It's also nice for me, when there's an issue I'm not working on I can get a shot to draw something for it by doing one of the variants, like when I got to draw Slash on a variant cover, I wouldn't have gotten to draw him otherwise!"
tcohboy,fdkvvua,t1_fdkv2fs,"Thanks for the response and insight, Tom!"
tcohboy,fdkw04b,t1_fdkv44p,"Thanks, Sophie! Our mutual friend is one of those artists who got a 100 cover, so I totally appreciate your (and his) perspective on it. You rock! Keep up the amazing work!"
Tough-Caregiver,fdktk3i,t3_elwzps,"Sophie, do you have any social media or website I can follow? Do you do convention appearances?"
IDWofficial,fdkvmda,t1_fdktk3i,"SC: Yeah, I'm on twitter a lot! That's my homebase: [https://twitter.com/mooncalfe1](https://twitter.com/mooncalfe1) I used to do conventions pretty regularly but in the last several years not so much anymore, I love meeting people there and seeing my friends and stuff but it's so disruptive when I'm busy on a project. :("

ShadowWolf712,fdku9fn,t3_elwzps," Hi there, first wanted to say I love this series, absolutely adore it, and I've been a huge fan of Sophie's work on it.

After the events of 100 and 101, I actually love that there's some organic, believable fallout from it, especially after how strained things were getting before. Seeing that have actual consequences that aren't patched up in a time skip or single issue is very refreshing. And I'm especially interested to see where Jenny and Leo's character arcs go in all of this.  


I couldn't help but notice that a certain character from the past made their debut in #101 though. So I'm wondering: what's the process behind deciding which characters from older TMNT incarnations come into play? Is it more of a ""I want to use this character but I have to find the right place"" sort of deal, or is it more a case of contextual inspiration like the opportunity simply presenting itself due to story events?"
IDWofficial,fdkwn2r,t1_fdku9fn,"SC: For me, being a fan, it's more like the first reason, there's a character I really want to use and revamp so I figure out how to introduce them in a way that's natural and fun for the story. Like Mona Lisa, maybe she felt shoved in, I don't know, but I'm sure having a blast writing & drawing her so whatever! Haha. And sometimes using an existing character can inspire new story ideas, too, and take things in new directions I hadn't thought of. But other times using new characters instead of revamping existing ones is the way to go, like I had a couple old characters I really wanted to introduce in the first arc but through discussing it and hashing it out, they just didn't fit as well as I'd hoped so I replaced them with some new characters and it's working out much better."

It's not inherently a slur (in fact, there are still people who self-identify as transvestites), but it has been used in derogatory ways a fair bit as some people deride transgender individuals by calling them transvestites instead, and usage in the common lexicon tends to carry negative connotations nowadays.  
Trans on its own is typically short for transgender (so yes, someone who is transitioning or who has transitioned)."

PLT and note to self: get rich; don’t have kids.... FUCK!! too late."
ResidentialConcierge,febb421,t1_feb98n9,"Well I wasn't there when they were raised so I can't say. 

I think the main thing is that they can't cut their kid off. For me, if my kid was making risky choices and getting addicted to heavy drugs, I'd prob have to cut her off financially pretty early on to keep from sinking the household financially. She's stronger with us strong and cut off from $ than she is with us all broke and fucked. 

But when you're wealthy, you aren't really risking that. So it becomes a more emotional decision to cut your kid off even if it's what's best for them. I think we all have rough kids but middle-class people might allows theirs to hit rock-bottom faster. 

So the rich probably have a lower chance of their kids turning out to be shitbags but their shitbags turn into flaming shitbags at a much higher rate."
Wheels9690,febf4t3,t1_feb98n9,"I may not be OP but I worked in Aspen Colorado for a number of years at the Aspen Ski.Co   .

I had one kid come up who was part of a extremely wealthy family, black american express card, a private jet at Aspen Airport, house on Red Mountain, the works.

This kid comes up and grabs a candy bar and starts to walk away. I say ""sorry bud but you gotta pay for those""

He looked me dead ass in the eyes and said

""My parents could buy you""

Now I know who his parents were, and to be totally fair, he wasn't wrong. Everyone has a number and they sure as hell could pay up mine lol but still, I wanted to smack the shit out of this kid. He tried to run off and his mother came up with the rest of their food and asked where he was going. After I told her what happened she was super pissed. Smacked him in the back of the head pretty hard and left me a 100$ tip for her child being a little shit.  


  


EDIT:  


I do want to add though I actually met more amazingly kind rich kids than shitty kids.   


Majority of them who came through would often be very chill and would enjoy just BSing with us. A few times the kids who were a bit older (15-17) would leave us hella good tips and the snowboard instructors would be spoiled as hell lol."

The HOA interviewed a few different management companies that came well-recommended (or stuck with the existing one). The HOA provided a list of desired services including concierge. There was a bidding process and the HOA decided on the one with the best service to cost ratio. The concierge is then paid by the management company in accordance with whatever the market rate is for that type of employee.

I’m sure that Amazon was able to make progress in Whole Foods with sales, supply chain, etc, and I have no idea if the health care cuts were to max out profit or just keep the company afloat.

ResidentialConcierge,feani91,t1_feajfir,"I'm surprised by how sane most are with their money but this is a class building with a lot of doctors, lawyers and professors mixed in. Conspicuous consumership is not vogue here because old money frowns on most flaunting but that means sometimes they aren't aware of how their habits look to the uninitiated. 

For example, some probably spend as much as I earn (or more) on flower arrangements. Some order $200 meals every night from fine dining restaurants on grubhub. Most though, find a way to turn their lifestyle into an investment. They'll spend a few million on an investment property just standing at the desk talking to someone else on a handshake deal. They'll buy the top of the line Mercedes and then drive it 500 miles a year, then drive it for 10 years before trading it in. I know a dude that bought a marina because he was spending too much to moor his boat. $1000+ shoes on everyone though."
almost_a_troll,febs4kb,t1_feani91,">$1000+ shoes on everyone though.

From about 14 years I reported directly to the owner of a very large successful company. All of his family worked there (real jobs, actually had to work to be allowed the family credit card), and I got to know them quite well. The son was younger when I started working there, maybe 18 or 19. Super nice guy, makes a point of asking about everyone elses life, family, etc. However, at that age humility can be hard to come by.

One day when I stopped to say good morning to the son, he said ""Hey troll, how do you like my new shoes?"" I liked them and said as much. Not even really meaning to speak down to me, he comes back with a very matter of fact, ""Yeah, I just bought them this weekend, you probably couldn't afford shoes like this, they were over $2,000.""

Well, his dad heard from in his office, ran out and gave him a huge open handed smack over the back of the head, yelling, ""DON'T YOU EVER TALK TO ANYBODY LIKE THAT AGAIN! Take troll to oakridge center tonight and buy him some shoes."" The poor kid was so stunned, I'll never forget the look on his face.

I turned down the shopping trip, but did go for lunch with him that day... Anyways, I every time I noticed him with new shoes on for the next 12 years I'd ask him, ""So...what'd you pay for those shoes?"" :-D"

Whether it be run their business, entertain the masses, win at sportsball, someone else does everything personal care related so they can be hyperfocused on what they do and the people in their lives.

One person I know is rich but not ultra-rich, has a million dollar home, but his money is really all he has.  No real friends, not much family, never entertains in that expensive home, and overall he doesn't seem happy at all.  His health is also rather poor.

(I think I vaguely know, but in your specific instance.)

Are there times one particular resident wants too much of your help/time and you have to tell them to get their own personal assistant? Do they have their own personal assistants or pretty much rely on you?

Do you do the same thing for all guests or are there few enough that you anticipate specific needs of certain ones? Like say a certain resident likes fresh baked cookies when they get home from work, is that something you would do?

Do you sign for package arrivals or is that someone else's job?

How many residents do you care for?

Do you make appointments for people? Like if I lived there, could I say, ""Make me an appointment with Dr. Smith for the mole on my back preferably by the end of the week.""

Does all your work involve helping people from the lobby or do you go to their rooms to help with things as well (and I don't mean that in a doble entendre way)?"

TheNonDuality,fe8smjn,t1_fe8n5aw,"I think Guo Gu responded to his own post instead of replying to you:

Thanks  for your question. Prior to seven or eight years old, kids usually are  unable to distance themselves from their thoughts, thinking process.  When they think of something they just become that! This is the  foundation of meditation. So for younger kids, it’s best to just make  things interesting for them.

I  have taught meditation on hearing with younger kids, asking them to  identify all the sounds in the environment (i’ve practiced this with  kids at the park and so on). Alternatively you can try having them feel  the different tactile sensations of the body. In other words meditation  methods that are active and stimulating.

Hope this helps."

Crystal_Spires,fe8ki5m,t3_eo51wv,"Āchariya Guo Gu, what is the most fruitful meditation practice you find helpful for beginning, intermediate and advanced meditators?"
Guo-Gu,fe8oi53,t1_fe8ki5m,"Thanks for your question. The most important attitude toward meditation, and life in general, is that you’re already free. That said, we all have habit tendencies and narratives that affect us—that make us feel not so free. Hence meditation practice becomes necessary. But even when we engage in meditation practice (broadly understood) we should be careful not to be so caught up with attitudes of trying to get somewhere, or trying to fix ourselves, and so on. 

There is no special kind of meditation that beginners should do. Any common meditation methods would be fine. For beginners, it’s important to develop an established practice of being in the body. Because most people live in their heads, they’re divorced from how they actually feel in the body, which impact every aspect of our experience. So beginners should choose a method that’s less abstract, and brings themselves in tune with the body. Learning how to relax the body is a primary importance.

For intermediate practitioners, those who have already established a consistent meditation practice, it’s important to find and work with a teacher. The teacher will be able to cater instructions according to the students’ situation.

For advanced practitioners, there should not be a separation between meditation and non-meditation, practice and life. Whatever they cannot let go of is where they’re stuck. They’ll have to expose and work through the subtleties of habit tendencies and narratives.

Hope this helps..."

Tru-Queer,febblus,t1_fe8uco5,"I realize I’m not OP, and I’m certainly not an expert meditator. But the way I view all these “contradictory hints” is like trying to eat: the object is to get the food into your mouth. For some people, using their bare hands is sufficient and helpful. Others may utilize a fork. And yet, for even others, using chopsticks is the best way.

None of these methods are better or worse than the others, they all achieve the same goal: getting food into the mouth.

What you need to work on is figuring out which method works best for you, and that requires experimentation, trial and error. Sometimes you’ll drop the food on the floor or in your lap. Sometimes you’ll miss your mouth and get it on your cheek. But through continuous effort, you refine your method until you successfully get the food in your mouth.

If that helps with anything."
larrieuxa,feb8qu8,t1_fe8uco5,"They're not contradictory, they are just different meditations. Different people find focussing on different things easier or harder. I find it way easier to hold a visualization than to focus on the breath. Many people are the opposite.

I want to go back to the way it was, with my relaxing nights, and the shrewd interoception and tranquility; it made me feel like I could take on the whole world by seeing *everything* (the concept of the Third Eye Chakra) and teach everyone tools to self-improve.  
I'm working with a therapist, but I doubt it will help the spiritual side.

What can I do to get back to my spiritual self without fear or uninterest?"
Guo-Gu,fe91pn5,t1_fe8qh2i,"Thanks for your question. But I have to say, as long as you’re entertaining thoughts of seeking and rejecting, having and lacking, trying and giving up, it’s very difficult to find peace. Because it is precisely these attitudes that bring us dis-ease. Take care not to entertain these thoughts but at the same time develop a consistent practice just for the sake of practice. Doing progressive relaxation, being in tune with a relaxed body throughout the day is most important once your body is relaxed you will be more in tune with the undercurrent feeling tones that shape your perception and understanding and experiences. When you’re grounded and relax, you will be able to not be so affected by negative on the current tones or feelings. You will be able to be at peace.

I have some guidance meditation audio files on the Tallahassee Chan Center website. I think you should check them out and go from there. Good luck my friend! I hope this helps."
larrieuxa,febs4rl,t1_fe8qh2i,"Are you mostly doing things like breath meditations? Being overcome by one's dark thoughts is really common in Western secular ""mindfulness"" meditation that is all about watching your thoughts and experiences and stops at just that. You're not supposed to stop there, just uncritically experiencing your own shitty thoughts and beliefs and then moving on with your day, and that's why western meditators get these ""dark nights of the soul"" and quit meditating. My advice to you would be to start doing meditations focused on developing thoughts and qualities, particularly on deconstructing the self and critically and impartially examining and deconstructing negative thoughts that arise, as well as meditations on developing equanimity and what is called ""metta"" (loving kindness towards all beings.)"

funkyjives,fe8o38v,t3_eo51wv,"Sometimes, I have difficulty acting with bodhicitta intentions when having difficult interactions with others. What sort of practical methods could be used to remedy that impediment?"
Guo-Gu,fe8w5nv,t1_fe8o38v,"Thanks for your question. The different Buddhist principles and ideals should not be used as a measuring stick for ourselves. They are meant to inspire us, but we are where we are. That said, it’s important to prime ourselves for different practices. And the most important thing is the conditions of our body and minds/hearts. If the conditions are not conducive, we cannot force ourselves. If we do, it will feel contrived. 

To prime ourselves we begin with the body. Our body must be relaxed and grounded. If the body is not in the state, all of these Buddhist ideals will not be embodied, they would just be abstract notions. So you have to, in those situations, relax your body from head to toe and feel grounded to earth. Practice this. Once the body is relaxed and grounded, you would be able to adjust and soften the undercurrent feeling tone of your heart, and see that everyone is actually trying their best— even though the way they do it may be harmful for others. At this time you will have a little more sympathy for others. It would be easier to generate understanding and kindness.

I have given some talks on this, and the MP3 file is on the Tallahassee Chan Center website. Feel free to check them out. I hope this helps."
Spiritual_Programmer,fe8qsra,t3_eo51wv,"Is there anything deeper or more advanced to zen meditation than focusing on your breath and centering your attention/awareness? 

I have been practicing zen meditation for a couple months with long sessions (20-40 minutes), and sometimes I feel stagnate. As if I have stood apart from my thoughts to a high degree and then dont know what to do. Should I simply continue to observe? Is there a deeper technique or direction I should be going once most of my thoughts have distanced themselves from me? 

The few times I have felt a complete presence of being apart from thoughts, I never know how to process that experience, which usually brings thoughts rushing back about how unique and bewildering that experience was.

Thanks!"
Guo-Gu,fe93ytc,t1_fe8qsra,"There are two distinct methods within the Chan/Zen tradition. The first is called meditation on the critical phrase (huatou or gong’an). The second is called silent illumination (mozhao). I’ve spoken on these two methods extensively and the audio files are on the Tallahassee Chan Center website. I have also published on them. You can check it out at the website.

This is not the place to go into details about them, but if you find yourself completely present, free from discursive thinking, at this time your body should still be there. So ground yourself in the embodied experience of being present. There’s a sense of body weight routed to earth, there is embodied experience of being relaxed, and there’s a clarity of these. This, then, can be your method at the time.

I hope this helps."

TheNonDuality,fe8n7gj,t3_eo51wv,"I used to live in a city with a Zen temple, and I did some meditation there when my schedule permitted. I recently moved to a very rural place. How do I develop a meditation practice at home without the support of teachers / other meditators?"
Guo-Gu,fe8umls,t1_fe8n7gj,"Thanks for your question. You’re not alone! There are so many people in the same situation as you. I would suggest two things.

First, that you don’t divide between meditation practice and your life. Sustained practice involves being in tune with our body and the undercurrent tone of feelings in all situations. And you have them with you all the time! This practice involves exposing, embracing, responding and tuning, and letting go. You can let go of difficulties and vexations if they are not exposed. We can’t respond to them if we cannot embrace and except them first. This is the first general principal.

Second, develop a reasonable doable formal meditation schedule every day, every week. And then once in a while you can change it up a bit. There is seated meditation as practice, mindful work as practice, reading buddhist works as practice, etc. give yourself a schedule, if you like. 

A couple of decades ago I developed a practice for my students, which I call “one minute Chan.” Five times a day, or five situations that you find yourself in every day, for one minute relax your body, be content, and engage with whatever that you’re doing. The task should be something that you already do every day—don’t create more burdens by adding more things that you have to do—such as first bite of lunch, the same elevator ride that you take, the same walk that you take, etc. for the first minute do them relaxingly, wholeheartedly, joyfully. Do this for three months, and then move on to five other things. 

In other words words, transform whatever that you’re doing daily life consciously as part of your practice. In time there will not be much separation between what is considered practice and what is not.

Hope this helps."

Guo-Gu,fe92u9g,t1_fe8qk6r,"Thanks for your question. I teach a foundational practice for meditation called progressive relaxation in which you would, through tactile sensations, feel the skin, the muscles, the tendons relaxing from head to toe. In this foundational practice you treat the eyes also as muscles for relaxing. It’s very important to relax the eyes and meditation practice.

If you do visualizations, this is engaging in abstract thinking. It is a bit harder to relax the body. Besides, most people are really not in tune with the body and their bodies are tense. So doing the foundational practice is very important. Please go to the Tallahassee Chan Center website I have audio files of guided meditation which will teach you how to relax the body.

Hope this helps."

Guo-Gu,fe9bkqq,t1_fe8u5ry,"Thanks for your questions. If you’re referring to awakening experiences, it’s not once and for all moment. The practitioner inevitably have breakthroughs again and again and again and again. Sometimes deep, lasting for months, while other times shallow, like a glimpse. Our self-referential tendencies are deep rooted. 

My first experience happened in 1995. I was going through a difficult time and my teacher was away; I had no one to rely on. I’ve given up on awakening and remembered something that my teacher said to me a long time ago: “body like a rag mind like a mirror— offer yourself!” Then I start practicing for myself I treated my body like a rag doing everything that no one else wanted to do. Let others take advantage of me without complaint, but clear about what’s happening. Whenever my attachments arose I just put it down. It was then that I entered the gateless barrier of Chan. They have been subsequent experiences. That said, even though others see me as their teacher, I am still a student of Chan.

As for styles of teaching, I really use stick. We’re in a different culture, different time. Methods that you mention very rarely works. Most of the time, they leave side effects and have not so good outcomes.

I hope this helps."

If I want to call myself Buddhist, what should I do to match this title? I have searched through the internet, but there were so few answers that I have decided to ask my question straight to you. Thanks for the answer"
Guo-Gu,feapnzw,t1_feakl4w,"Thanks for your question. It's not dull at all. Usually a person becomes a Buddhist by publicly making a commitment to take the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha) as a ""refuge,"" before a representative of the Sangha, i.e., Buddhist monastic order. This short ceremony is called Taking Refuge. 

""Refuge"" means recognizing, relying, and applying the values of the Three Jewels in one's life. You may want to consult this short essay: http://www.dharmadrum.org/content/chan_garden/chan_garden2.aspx?sn=40

Hope this helps!"

keizee,fe8rj31,t3_eo51wv,"Before I shifted to a different practice, I did practice some meditation. I currently don't practice meditation since we already practice Zen in other ways. 

So here's my question: I find it very curious how some practices have a single focal point in meditation. From internet english speakers, I heard that some meditation practices focus on breathing. From my point of view, it isn't very different from a daily practice of focused chanting (what I am currently doing) and flow state. 

However, previously I have been taught to meditate by thought watching, that is with zero focal point and seeing and ignoring any thoughts that come up. I find that it increases self-awareness. 

what kind of circumstances in which type of meditation should be recommended? Should a beginner do breath type meditation or thought watch? Then when would be a good time to try out the other method? Are there other meditation methods? 

Or maybe the simplest answer is to let 缘分 decide what kind of practice I end with and follow their roadmap lol. They always say to 一门精进 after all."
Guo-Gu,fe96jxh,t1_fe8rj31,"Thanks for your question. Indeed different circumstances of people require different methods. Meditation on the breath is a foundational method. By using it, people will give rise to different psychosomatic responses and experiences. Understanding these, a teacher would be able to know how the student works and what method the student should use. 

An analogy of this is like you have a seed that you don’t know what kind of plant it’s from. So the first thing you do is put it in the ground maybe add some fertilizer some water and see if it grows. Once it grows, sprouts, and by observing the shape of the leaves and the way it grows, you would be able to tell what kind of plant it is, and how to nourish the plant. 

The same is with meditation on the breath. The teacher does not really know what works for a student unless a student begins to practice. Once a student started half experiences then the teacher with a be able to tweak the method or change the method for student to continue. Everyone works differently. That’s why it’s important to have a teacher. In the beginning, maybe is not so important. But once a person starts to have experiences, a teacher is a must. Does that make sense?

I hope this helps."

nyanasagara,fe8t88b,t3_eo51wv,"Ācārya, you are both a meditation teacher/practioner and involved in Buddhist studies academia, not unlike some others in the field such as Bhadanta Anālayo. Can you talk about this path into academia, and whether or not you think it is important for Buddhist academics to have direct training in practice lineages before going for their degrees (or during their programs)?

I ask as an undergraduate interested in Buddhist studies along multiple fronts (philosophical, historical, anthropological, linguistic, etc.) but who's own personal Buddhism is more about devotion and faith than about practice in this life. I would say that I'm probably like an ordinary, if slightly more devout, Buddhist layperson (in that I don't do much sitting meditation, I go to temple for pūjā and such and I might do a buddhānusṃrti informally), only with strong academic inclinations. Do you think I would be a better scholar of Buddhism if I actually had experience in more advanced Buddhist practice? Do you feel that you are a better scholar of Buddhist studies by virtue of your personal advanced practice?"
Guo-Gu,fe97v5u,t1_fe8t88b,"Thanks for your question. Analayo bhikkhu was recently on one of my retreats. He’s a friend. Different strokes for different folks.

jungle_toad,fe9jm4o,t3_eo51wv,"I have done many types of meditation over the past 20+ years.  Most instructors usually guide people through meditations that are slow and relaxing. I am trying to diversify my meditations at this point, however, so I am wondering if you have any unique ideas for meditation that is more energetic or fast paced? 

Relatedly, I am good at doing one thing at a time with focus, which many meditation instructors I have encountered teach. What I am not as good at is cognitive task switching and/or multitasking.  For example, if someone asks me a question while I am busy reading, I often don't hear the beginning of what they are saying and it is difficult to shift my attention away from my book. When we are done talking, it then takes me a moment to get back into reading and remember what I just read moments ago. Or another example, if someone is trying to have a conversation with me while I am cooking, I am much more likely to make little errors like accidentally overcooking something or forgetting to add an ingredient. Do you have any unique ideas for meditation practices to improve cognitive task switching or multi-tasking?"
Guo-Gu,fe9mrle,t1_fe9jm4o,"Thanks for your question. Our cognitive capabilities vary from person to person— each of us is limited by our own neurological synaptic wiring. And mistakes are bound to happen. Meditation may help in improving our cognitive functioning, but it really isn’t meant for that. Instead meditation is really meant for alleviating us from emotional afflictions, vexations, and causes of suffering. That said, there are practices that develops our overall awareness without being linear in our focus. Silent Illumination would be one; loving kindness is another. Interested in them, you’re welcome to the website which has talks and guided meditation practices on them.

Hope this helps."
jungle_toad,fe9r5qw,t1_fe9mrle,"I appreciate that you are not making claims to be able to alter frontal lobe executive functioning, particularly cognitive flexibility, if you do not have a technique that can do that. To be fair, I have not found any methods in the psychology literature that can clearly improve task switching, cognitive flexibility, or other executive functions either (there are some small studies that claim to, but nothing that is certain). However, neurological synaptic wiring does change, fyi. The brain is more plastic than was realized in decades past. It is not a circuit board that never changes. 

What about the question on fast paced or energetic practices though?  Silent illumination and loving kindness are great, but don't strike me as fast or energetic."
Guo-Gu,fe9u9a9,t1_fe9r5qw,"Yes I know about neuroplasticity, but change is incremental and takes consistent practice.

Guo-Gu,fe8qwl9,t1_fe8pnyj,"Awareness is not something we don’t have in this moment. It’s just that our awareness is distracted, scattered. So the cultivation part is about not being so distracted and scattered. 

An easy way to begin this is not to make a “thing” out of it and being present to whatever task you’re doing concretely at the moment: walking, eating, standing, lying down, sitting, talking with people, etc. and not get so caught up with notions and ideas. In time, your body and mind would be more integrated, less in the head space. Then even when engaging in more complex tasks when using the thinking mind, our awareness would be still be focused, not distracted.

Hansa_Teutonica,fe8qgxb,t3_eo51wv,"First, I appreciate your work in Judge. Speaking of which, do you see any parallels in the punk movement and chan/zen? Personally, the DIY mindset, community orientation, acceptance of vegetarians, and the strange relationship with violence, etc. There seem to be some similarity in ideas that I find interesting. 

Second, I was listening to a talk you gave on silent illumination. In it you cited Hongzhi. I've looked into silent illumination being taught by zen masters and can't find any actual textual support aside from Dogen and Hakuin, but the argument can be made that they're frauds. I don't know if any extant texts from Hongzhi or Rujing who are associated with silent illumination as well. I find the topic interesting, but without textual support, I haven't looked much into it.

I'm a big fan of Linji's, ""Find the stillness in motion,  and the motion in stillness."" My interest in silent illumination is partly spurred by that, but also the controversy over meditation in zen to begin with. I meditate, but I wouldn't say zen masters teach it. To me, Bodhidharma was using meditation but not teaching it. I think he was trying to say it can't be taught. Do you have any thoughts on this?"
Guo-Gu,fe8zutc,t1_fe8qgxb,"Thanks for your many questions! I’ve done an interview about the early part of my life exploring hard-core straight edge punk music and meditation. It’s online somewhere if you search it. Yes I think there are some parallels.

There’s a book called Cultivating the Empty Field, which is a translation of some of Hongzhi’s writings. You can check that book out. This year Shambala publications will also publish my own translation of Hongzhi’s writings with my commentaries on silent illumination practice. So you can keep an eye out for that one as well. 

As for meditation, I just answered someone’s question about that. We are already free. But we don’t feel so liberated, that’s why people meditate. It’s not that meditation “produces” freedom or awakening. It doesn’t. It simply makes the conditions ripe for us to realize our inherent freedom.

Silent illumination is not a “method” of meditation practice. It is simply a poetic literary expression for our inherent freedom which has two aspects: stillness and luminosity, selflessness and dynamic function, samadi and prajna—these are expressed as silent illumination. in other words, silent illumination is your true nature, already awakened. Practice is about removing that which conceals this.

Combat-kid,fe94bwg,t3_eo51wv,"I’ve read two schools of thought on meditation. 

One states (and I’m summarizing here) that the purpose is to slow down, generate calm, learn to focus, build concentration, and become mindful.

The other states that it is to increase your anti-fragility. To toughen up your mental strength by exposing yourself to uncomfortable situations (sitting with only yourself for an extended period of time) and hence increase your tolerance for mental pain - I.e. day to day setbacks, pain of growth, etc. Similar to enduring the physical pain of exercising to grow your muscles so they can improve and do more.

Guo-Gu,fe9w7k6,t1_fe9gexg,"Thanks for your question. First, it really depends on the extent of the psychological condition. There may be neurological pathways that inhibit appropriate empathy in the person. What it really comes down to is a set of skills that the person needs to learn, such as learning to exchange self with others, picking up cues about how others may feel, cultivating loving kindness, etc. it’s a case-by-case situation, but generally cultivating mindfulness and clarity will engage different aspects of our minds and will have a positive affect. Good instructions are necessary. 

Second, for those of us who are working with people with psychological conditions, love and patience are most important. It is our love for them that can help them take the first step to living meaningfully.

Guo-Gu,fea2g1e,t1_fe9llqp,"Thanks for your question. I don’t think there is one book out there that covers all systems of Buddhist meditation. Even if they were they will be so general that may not be so useful. 

Meditation is an organic process and as you engage with It, different psychosomatic responses occur, and your path unfolds accordingly. So it’s important to have a teacher as a guide to help you navigate through them.

If there’s one teacher that you find an affinity with, you can read their books.

I hope this helps."

Have you met anyone who demonstrated them? If not, have you heard credible reports of riddhis from people you trust?

I apologize for this seemingly inappropriate question, but this is personally a problem for me. If riddhis don't exist (as it seems likely), then this causes a lot of difficulty in having faith in the doctrines of Buddhism (and also Hinduism), since if they were mistaken about riddhis or deliberately misleading the followers, they could be doing the same with Buddhism's more mundane claims."
Guo-Gu,fea1uzz,t1_fe9mp4n,"Thanks for your question. These experiences are certainty real. But from the Chan perspective, they are kind of like side effects from practice.

1) Do you ever do any type of video chat based interview/checkins with your students? 

2) How do you establish the student-teacher relationship in chan, especially when you live several hours driving distance away?

3) Do you think it's possible to reach complete or deep realization(s) on your own by studying the texts and meditating without an official teacher, i.e. without living under or having regular access to a teacher?

1) I usually use skype or zoom to work with my students who are in other states/country.

3) It is theoretically possible, of course. However, it would be very hard. If possible, it's always good to talk with a teacher to verify whatever experiences one may have.

I've tried walking meditation (hated it), open eyed meditation (couldn't concentrate), and half-eyed meditation looking at a small tea candle in the dark (still fell asleep).

Guo-Gu,fe9yfen,t1_fe9w4b4,"Thanks for your question. It sounds like you are simply fatigued physically. Why don’t you try to integrate mindfulness to things that you already do? Daily tasks such as walking eating driving, etc. The principle is, whatever the task at hand, your heart mind is right there. As for the method, be aware of the movements and sensations. Try this for three months.
Once you’re able to integrate mindfulness to your life, you will find it easier to sit down and do seated meditation.

I hope this helps."
dakobah,fea33rb,t3_eo51wv,"Thank you for doing this AMA! I'm a Vajrayana practicioner, and I've seriously considered becoming a monk over the years, it's usually when I'm frustrated and get the feeling that no matter what I do, society has a vested interest in chasing Samsaric delusions of wordly wealth, power and prestige. Our value system is 100 percent antithetical to what the Buddha taught, so I figure why not turn your back on something so life-destroying. But then I think to myself, I should stay and make worldly secular life a part of my practice, I.e. If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere. But then I see alot of modern Buddhism being watered down to appeal to western beginners, so that it fits non-threateningly in our consumer culture, becoming perverted in the process and turned into things like; meditation as a relaxation technique, an overemphasis on love and light, bordering on New Age foofy stuff. 

So, how did you do it? How do you do it? how do you square your practicing the Dharma with everyday life? Really and truly being ""no one"" in a world that worships the individual seems a bit futile to me. And what made you take off your robes?

Again, I hope I'm not too late. And thank you so much for what you do with this life. Invaluable"
Guo-Gu,fea748s,t1_fea33rb,"Thank you for your question. In my experience and observation, putting on robes doe not make one holy; wearing lay clothes does not make one worldly. I left monasticism so I can bring the teachings beyond the monastic walls. Practicing as a layperson is a lot harder than being sheltered in a nice environment. But practice takes all forms. Under the sheltered environment one can develop certain aspects of practice (meditative absorption); and in the complexity and ups and downs of daily lay life, one can really see the emotional afflictions and self-grasping. 

I don’t really judge the types of teaching that is “watered down”; there is a place for that and some people do find it useful. There is no fixed teaching in Buddhadharma. They’re all expedient means. 

Do you have a teacher you can discuss your concerns with? The reality of monastic life may be very different than what you imagined it to be. Perhaps you can stay at a monastery for extended period time and observe for yourself.

Samsara is all engulfing, including monasteries. It is up to us to make samsara the arena for awakening. Opposing it won’t help.

I hope this is useful."
dakobah,feabhxt,t1_fea748s,"Yes thank you for your time responding with such a thoughtful reply. I realize that Samsara will find me in or outside of a monastery, but I feel that at least my life would be organized around a purpose, instead of what it is now which is mostly being a wage slave and contributing very little 2 the well-being of others through my work. But you're right, there's no way to know what a monastic life would be like without trying it out.

Regarding watering down Buddhism, I stand by my previous statement. The problem with trying to shoehorn Buddhism into our culture by oversimplifying it is that the economy turns it into a commodity and a way of being a better employee. It's presented as a relaxation too, so people get addicted to bliss, which is something that is warned about a thousand times by all sorts of Buddhists throughout history. Heavily marketing it around Compassion and love is a dual vision, it becomes this great thick white cloud illusion that stands in the way of itself. Dharma is supposed to be challenging, if buddhism wasn't challenging and just tells us what we want to hear, it wouldn't be a spiritual path. The right application is like a poison that is medicinal, like how a vaccine or anti-venom works.

I guess I trust that people will rise to the occasion if its presented honestly and fully. With all the challenging and complex concepts included, because those seem to be the real antidotes.

Anyway, thank you for your wisdom, I greatly appreciate it."
ChanCakes,feaa233,t3_eo51wv,"For the practice of Silent Illumination are there any traditional texts you would recommend other then Hongzhi’s writings? I’ve never seemed to find many texts that relate to the practice even when it’s always said to be the counterpart of Huatou which is endless things written about it...

Also, how does Silent Illumination lead to sudden awakening? Since it seems much more similar to traditional meditation practices then Huatou which aims specifically for breaking through the karmic mind."
Guo-Gu,feai9l3,t1_feaa233,"Thanks for your question. Silent illumination traditionally is really not a “method” of practice. It is just a poetic literary expression for awakening—a termed that was in circulation in the 12th century China. silence refers to selflessness; elimination refers to the functions of this selfless wisdom. For this reason, you won’t find the exact coinage “silent illumination” in pre-12th century texts. At the same time, it is everywhere in Chan literature, albeit in another word combinations like “quiescent luminosity,” “sudden and perfect shamata-vipashyanana,” “true emptiness and sublime function,” etc. 

Master Yongjia of the 7th century articulated this in his writings. Unfortunately, only a small part of his writings are translated. In the Platform Sutra of Huineng, there are also passages that delineate the principle workings of the awakened mind (chps on seated meditation and prajna). I have a book coming out on silent illumination, in which I talk about this more extensively. So you can keep an eye on that.

The “sudden” in sudden awakening in Chan means different things in huatou or gong’an and silent illumination. Silent illumination practice is sudden because it is in accordance with the intrinsic qualities of our minds. In huatou and hong’an methods, sudden means it aims to use poisoned against poison, frustrating the rational, discursive mind and turn it in on itself with the sense of wonderment, which leads to dropping away of self-attachment. Both are sudden methods. Neither means that by using the method you actually realize awakening sooner.

That said, it is quite common for people to feel a sense of lack, something unfulfilling, Feeling that they want this current moment in your life to be other than what it is.

Guo-Gu,febergx,t1_febbpop,"Thanks for your question. Without knowing more context, it’s hard to pinpoint the causes for drowsiness. You could examine the physiological and psychological conditions before and during your meditation. Sometimes sleepiness is caused by physiological conditions such as poor posture. Other times drowsiness can be caused by the attitude that we bring to practice or even a misapplication of the method is self. 

Many practitioners start to become drowsy 10 to 15 minutes into the sitting, and have allowed this tendency to become a sort of habit. If this is a pattern he will be very difficult to uproot. 

When you sit in meditation, check your posture, the attitude that you bring to meditation, which should be contentment, and make sure that your body is relaxed and grounded to earth. When you actually engage in the method of your meditation you should give rise to great interest... Each moment is a new beginning, every moment is fresh. Appreciate and love your method of practice.

Having access to a physically safe setting that was dominated by rules dictating non-interference made tolerating intense negative emotions much easier for me after a year or so of sitting with a group.

I noticed that I was able to translate that practice off of the cushion, as well, which allowed me to expand my behavioral repertoire and extend rather than withdraw in the face of triggers.

I do not know how the Master explains this dharma. The Master said, “The Way is awakened to from the mind. How could it be found in sitting? The Diamond Sutra states that to say that Tathagata either sits or lies down is to walk a deviant path. Why? The clear pure Dhyana of the Tathagata comes from nowhere and goes nowhere and is neither produced nor extinguished. The Tathagata’s clear pure ‘sitting’ is the state of all dharmas being empty and still. Ultimately there is no certification; even less is there any ‘sitting.’”

Zen texts are open to interpretation in many regards, but you're cherry picking interpretations that reject meditation and ignore the ones that support it. Your assertion that Zen isn't a philosophy is dogma, what reasoning do you have for that? Zen makes claims about reality and doesn't back it up with empiricism much like any other philosophy, that doesn't mean there is no value in philosophies, but they have their limits. Your equivalency with science is false due to that same lack of empiricism.

Buddha's story has him sitting till he becomes enlightened and then sharing that with other people. I've never read an account that didn't include that part nor an account with him rejecting meditation. And even if there is a version like that, so what? That alone doesn't back up any of your assertions in a meaningful way, it is no different than Catholics and Protestants arguing about Bible verses. Buddha's story could be wrong, but the logic for and evidence of meditation is being gathered empirically and bodes well with the non-supernatural  subjective claims made by practitioners for centuries.  The meditation is the part that allows you to investigate Buddhism from the subjective level and hopefully use that to help with the objective part. If you reject  meditation, then what do you have? Ancient mystical writings that could or could not be true without anyway to test them?"

Suppose these guys were feeling peace and harmony in what they did. Maybe that would count. Are Zen Masters against these things in general? Who knows - the question here is *whether they relate to Zen-as-Zen*

Zen is not prescriptive, so there’s little “do this” without “in order to this”, and it’s important to note that the “in order to do this” is very rare, and it’s rarely an ambiguous or esoteric statement. The occasions where it seems to be is usually clarified by comparing translations.

Green_Tea_Sage,fea7qxo,t1_fe9sudk,"No you're definitely right. I think Zen and Buddhism can give us a lot of the resources that we need to approach complex social situations like these. In some cases,  I think a huge thing weighing on the back of people's minds is this insecurity regarding their understanding or knowledge on Buddhism, or their faith. Its a very human thing to dislike being told that they're not approaching the situation in a correct way, but people put even more investment towards concepts like religion, as it helps dictate their behavior. So sometimes you'll see people arguing when it looks like they're arguing just for the sake of arguing, but really they're arguing because they understand something is wrong in their approach. They feel as if they have to take sides. If people didn't have this 'conceit' (for lack of a better word) in that way, you would be able to have more balanced discussions where both people look at a problem and think of how to solve it. This shifting of perspectives is mentally a difficult and painful process, (especially if you base your life around those principles) so there's going to be some resistance.

I think through practice, you can be a little bit more cognizant of that type of stuff. Learning to treat every situation as a learning experience and an opportunity to be a bit humbled is important, I feel like. I definitely have residual issues and feelings similar to this, where I feel insecure about my  knowledge of the dhamma - thinking it does not have enough basis or structure. My hypersensitivity to this concept leaves me *wanting* to discuss dhamma, leaves me *wanting* to be proved wrong, since deep down I must feel as if this is the best way to learn. My hunger for the dhamma shows in this weird, challenging, almost aggressive way, but its very similar to a lot of other people. I should probably find a teacher if that's how I feel, or just shift my perspective more towards the concept of self-practice until I find a bit more stability, and until I establish that proper amount of structure in my practice."

Anyway, I loved your book recommendations at the end of your For Small Creatures. I was curious if you've come across any books since then that have had a big impact on you? Any recommendations? Anything you're currently reading? Thank you for your insights!

With gratitude,

Nich"
SashaSagan,fdntp12,t1_fdns7of,"Thank you so much, Nich! Means a lot. I have been reading a lot of fiction since I finished the book because I spent so much time reading non-fiction leading up to and while I was writing. But I recently finished I Contain Multitudes by Ed Yong and am almost done with SPQR by Mary Beard, both non-fiction I loved. I'm reading a few fiction books right now (I tend to read a few things at a time) and my fave is The Water Dancer by Ta-Nehisi Coates."
scientifcphilosophr,fdnufrm,t1_fdntp12,"Oh, those are some fantastic choices! Thank you for your thoughts!"
Dmjoyce951,fdnrqtp,t3_emcvqm,"Hi, I loved your book! Wondering if you have had any thoughts of writing another book in the future, if so, any ideas on what the topic would be? Thanks!"
SashaSagan,fdnryfe,t1_fdnrqtp,Thank you! I would like write more books. Maybe a children's book next?
starrrrrchild,fdns95e,t1_fdnryfe,Yes. Would LOVE to read a children's book by you. Do you have a topic in mind?
SashaSagan,fdnx2ln,t1_fdns95e,"Probably something that overlaps with the themes of For Small Creatures, but I have some more fanciful ideas too!"
Metalhart00,fdnt9st,t3_emcvqm,"What was your family life like? Your dad was such an important figure to me it's difficult to imagine him as flawed. What was your relationship with him like? 

What is your family life like now? Do you have any relationships with your various half siblings? Is your family all scientifically minded or do even the Sagans have a redneck uncle who drinks too much and talks politics at dinner?"
SashaSagan,fdnv8za,t1_fdnt9st,"Well, everyone is flawed in ways, and he had foibles, but he was a truly wonderful person and I really am lucky I got 14 years with him. I do have relationships with my half brothers and am especially close to Nick.... and to answer your last question: I mean, everyone has a few wacky relatives! What fun would it be if we didn't?!"
Davin777,fdnw7ce,t1_fdnv8za,"You realize that now you HAVE to write a book detailing all of this, right?"
Metalhart00,fdnx0ns,t1_fdnv8za,Thank you so much for answering my questions!
Alice1985ds,fdnrmlj,t3_emcvqm,"Your book was amazing and I was sad to finish it.

Do you have more books planned?"
SashaSagan,fdnsrrz,t1_fdnrmlj,Thank you so much!! If by planned you mean some non-linear sentence fragments in a word document then yes!
Alice1985ds,fdntwg2,t1_fdnsrrz,"Hey, that’s how every book gets started :)

I made sure to review your book on Amazon and Goodreads as well as my social media (rather small audience, haha!). Is there anything else we can do to help promote the book?

Also thank you so much for giving a sensitive voice to us atheists/agnostics everywhere. It resonated deep with me, especially during the holidays. You showed rationalism and critical thinking don’t equal heartlessness or prejudice. So truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart!"
SashaSagan,fdnvo7t,t1_fdntwg2,"Wow, thank you so much! And really that is all I could ever hope for in terms of promoting the book! Thank you, truly."
MoreOldBay,fdnt1bg,t3_emcvqm,What is your most fondest memory of your father? Seeing how he’s touched so many peoples lives I’m also curious to know how he was when the cameras weren’t on him.
SashaSagan,fdnvfnf,t1_fdnt1bg,"I am so lucky because I have many, but one that just popped into my mind was when I was little, like elementary school age, on weekends he would sometimes take me to his classroom at Cornell and let me pretend to be the teacher and ask questions and he would raise his hand and pretend to be the students in the class and I LOVED that."
Seinsmells,fdoesj2,t1_fdnvfnf,That’s a great story! Love hearing that. I was in Ithaca last summer and took an early morning walk to his grave site while listening to him read the audiobook A Pale Dot and damn it if I didn’t feel his presence. He would be so proud of you :)
MoreOldBay,fdnvt6b,t1_fdnvfnf,Thats awesome! Thanks for the reply. For small creatures such as we will be my next book to read. After finishing Cosmos by well you know who :)
Augusto05,fdntfyo,t3_emcvqm,"Hi Sasha. I'm curious, did you ever consider following in your father's footsteps and becoming an astrophysicist?"
SashaSagan,fdnum5d,t1_fdntfyo,"Not really, to be honest. I think of this way, just as every Catholic is not a priest, everyone who sees science as the pathway to understanding is not necessarily a scientist as a profession. I was always naturally more drawn to history and literature, but I hope I've found a way to connect those interests to his work."
-e-j,fdntuyp,t3_emcvqm,"""Finding meaning in our unlikely world"": do you think that there is meaning, pre-existing, out there in the world, and that when people experience meaning they are in some sense ""discovering"" it? Or is this more like a metaphor, and the meaning is actually within the people doing the experiencing?"
SashaSagan,fdnvyaz,t1_fdntuyp,"I think our experience of meaning is specific to our experience of being human, a product of these brains that have evolved to recognize patterns and be curious. I don't have any compelling evidence to suggest there is an external source of meaning."
-e-j,fdnyedy,t1_fdnvyaz,"Thanks very much for your answer - and for an interesting perspective.

(I think you're almost-certainly entirely right - but given just how little we know about the wider universe I also wouldn't expect us to have found any compelling evidence, even if it were to be out there!)"
Davin777,fdnv9so,t3_emcvqm,"I haven't read the book yet, but if your father was a big an influence on you as he was on me, I'm sure it is outstanding. <added to cart...> Demon Haunted World came out right around the end of high school and clearly influenced my early adulthood; I've purchased this book as a gift  for many people who I've bonded with in intellectual curiosity. Doubtless your father was a significant influence; where else have you found influence? Also, Did you dad have, like, the worst dad jokes? This is how I imagine it..."
SashaSagan,fdnybz1,t1_fdnv9so,"Hahah, no his jokes were pretty good for the most part.... other than my parents I've been influenced by a lot of writers, two historians that pop into mind are Charles C. Mann and Karen Armstrong. Armstrong in particular has a different philosophical outlook than I have, but I love her writing and have learned so much from her books."
Davin777,fdnyklg,t1_fdnybz1,"I'm sure he had Billions and Billions of them...

Thank you for the response. I just downloaded the Kindle version of the book and look forward to diving in!"
GracefulAtheist,fdnvdrx,t3_emcvqm,"Hi Sasha,

What scientific fact or theory inspires the most awe in you?"
SashaSagan,fdnwe79,t1_fdnvdrx,"I still cannot get over DNA, blows my mind every single time."
thatsagoodmeme,fdnxcky,t3_emcvqm,"Hey Sasha, I just finished your book and I've read most of your parents' books, and watched their TV series as well. I think I speak for most people like me when I say that your dad would be proud to see your work today and who you've become. You're a wonderful human being and we need more people like you who understand the importance of empathy especially in our demon-haunted world. I'm about to become a certified teacher of science for grades 7-12 and this is my question:

How can educators like me keep that spark of curiosity and wonder alive in children as they enter their teen years and close off the doors to science? Every 3rd grader wants to be an astronaut, but a recent study found that's changing in the West. With the dawn of this upcoming 21st century space race, how can we push kids to go into STEM fields? 

Thanks, I greatly appreciate your response in advance."
SashaSagan,fdnzr86,t1_fdnxcky,"Wow, well first of all, thank you so much. For your very kind words and for your commitment to teaching young people! It's such a good question, and such a hard one. I think enthusiasm really helps and maybe taking away some of the stigma of being ""wrong"" or asking ""silly"" questions. We get so self-conscious as we become teens and are so worried about what others think, making mistakes or seeming imperfect, but that's antithetical to finding deeper understanding through science. Maybe if we emphasize the ways science and technology have improved our lives and changed our ideas, and how even brilliant people were sometimes totally wrong maybe that would help?"
GodKingMussolini,fdnqxf1,t3_emcvqm,"Hi, what inspired you to right your book?"
SashaSagan,fdnrd7j,t1_fdnqxf1,"Hi! Great question. I was very inspired by my parents' work, but it was really when I was ready to become a mom that I started thinking about how we can celebrate, mark time and mourn without religion, with science as a source of awe and joy. Kids ask such deep questions and my husband and I wanted to prepare for those!"
GodKingMussolini,fdo19hx,t1_fdnrd7j,Sweet thanks for answering that’s really cool
stopstatic27,fdnuu8s,t3_emcvqm,"Thank you for your time Sasha, and I can't wait to read your book. What makes you feel optimistic for humans in 2020 and the future?"
SashaSagan,fdnxqhr,t1_fdnuu8s,"Thank you! I am generally a pretty optimistic person, although there are moments when that is really hard given the current state of things. I do feel that people's access to information and to one another (through the magic/science of technology) is hopeful. The idea that you could live in a place where no one thinks or feels the way you do, but on your phone you find someone, maybe on the other side of the planet, to share your ideas with is very moving and uplifting to me. I just hope that we find better ways to use critical thinking and skepticism as we navigate the information and misinformation out there!"
rajanmahajan11,fdnwozq,t3_emcvqm,"What can we do to make important people realise the importance of STEM. Can we change their perspective. (Should we?) 
Because once everyone can embrace the 'cosmos' we can do exciting things. Like more focus on space exploration than taming wars. 
If there are few basic things we can do on small level in our communities or localities, what would that be?"
SashaSagan,fdnz0mx,t1_fdnwozq,"Great question! Number one, in my opinion, at least here in the US,   would be to pay public school teachers WAY more money. Secondly, I think making STEM welcoming and warm, using the enthusiasm and joy of, for example, a great preacher would go a long way. STEM is so important and it's so thrilling, we just sometimes have trouble presenting it that way, I think."
astro_jcm,fdo1ihx,t3_emcvqm,"Congratulations on your new book! Looking forward to reading it.

If it's not too much of a personal question, what was your own journey towards a life without religion? While my family is Catholic, my parents were never strict at all in this regard, and they had no problem at all when I ""came out"" as an atheist, so my own journey was quite smooth. In fact, your father's The Demon-Haunted World played a key role in teaching me how to think critically. (Cosmos is also close to my heart, as it's one of the reasons I'm now an astronomer, but that's a different story!)

Congrats again for your book, and Happy New Year!"
bfp9,fdnrn4d,t3_emcvqm,"I am not a religious person - in fact I’m much more of the opinion that it’s a net negative more frequently due to its second and third order effects than it is a net positive. 

How would you describe the key differences between being religious, spirituality, and ritualistic?  

I often hear people say, “well if religion makes that person happier and a better person, let them practice.”  What are your thoughts on that statement?  

Religions across the globe have been exposed for awful traditions (evangelicals for pray the gay away camps, Catholics for molesting little boys etc etc etc). Through your experiences with rituals and celebrations, have you had any moral conundrums where you feel the practice is morally/ethically wrong?  

Thanks!"
SashaSagan,fdnsndh,t1_fdnrn4d,"I think rituals and traditions are not intrinsically good because they're old, if someone is being hurt that is totally different to me than something that's neutral or innately positive. I think human beings need to process change like births, deaths, coming-of-age, changing seasons and that's why we have created so many rituals. Those of us who don't believe still need those touchstones in some form. For me what is so powerful about science is not that it's always perfect, or always used for good, but that there is an error-correcting mechanism. Challenging what everyone believes can be the pathway to new understanding, questioning is good, that which cannot stand up to scrutiny must fall away. I think that's a good approach if your goal is to gain the deepest possible understanding of our universe as it really is. (I don't begrudge anyone else their faith, I just have a different outlook)"
bfp9,fdobmuj,t1_fdnsndh,"Interesting!  

Thanks for the response."
akxat_,fdnsjil,t3_emcvqm,"Hello Sasha! I wanted to know that if you're planning to write a book on your dad? A biography perhaps, because I guess you were the closest to him so you could tell us more about him and his ways of thinking! Thanks, have a good day :)"
SashaSagan,fdntwp3,t1_fdnsjil,"Oh thank you for you question. I've never really thought of that before. I think sometimes it could be hard to write a biography of someone you're so close to and love so dearly, but it's an interesting idea!"
Underline_Smudge,fdny22t,t3_emcvqm,"Hey Sasha, big fan! 

to quote your dad. 
""The sky calls to us, if we do not destroy ourselves, we will one day venture to the stars.""

Are you hopeful or pessimistic about our chances to cooperate on a global scale, maybe even to achieve things like ""venturing to other stars"". 

We seem stuck in this perpetual state of war, hatred, nationalism and tribalism... and yet... is there reason to be optimistic?"
SashaSagan,fdo0633,t1_fdny22t,I tend toward optimism because I think it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy (to borrow some theistic language!) and because we are indeed capable of great things. We do understand more than we ever have before and a great people do want to venture to other stars.
Underline_Smudge,fdo19l3,t1_fdo0633,"Carl wrote in ""pale blue dot"" about his grandparents on the banks of the river Bug, and their journey to America. 
My Great grandparents were less fortunate, and didn't escape Europe before the Holocaust. Their experience as Jews, surviving Auschwitz strengthened their Jewish identity. I am Jewish but am an atheist, and my grandparents always tell me it's important for me to preserve my Jewish Identity, although it isn't of much importance to me personally. 
Do you think the problem of identity could be a contributing factor to finding a secular meaning to our lives? I know Carl was Jewish, did he have any sense of Jewish identity? 
How does personal Identity play a role in *your* life?"
LilyoftheRally,fdo6ykc,t1_fdo19l3,"Not sure if she's going to get to this question, but I recommend looking into what Carl's fellow Jewish humanist, skeptic author Isaac Asimov had to say about his identity.

I'm not of Jewish background myself, but I admire their culture, and when I was a kid learning about different culture's holidays, I liked it when the Jewish kids would bring latkes to school to share. I know a good number of Jewish people and folks of Jewish background through the autistic community (I am autistic myself, as are some of my Jewish friends)."
kingford0977,fdny730,t3_emcvqm,"What science advancement do you think your Dad would be happiest/proudest about today? P.S. he is one of my biggest heroes, even at 34 years old! Can’t wait to read your book!!"
bsievers,fdnysfo,t3_emcvqm,"I've recently become a father (well, the older is now three, but the younger is only 2 months). And I've been reflecting a lot in today's world about how it feels like everything men like your father warned us about is coming true. Sometimes I'm honestly worried about the quality of life my children's generation will get.

I've basically become this pendulum between ecstatic and dread. How do you remain optimistic in light of what science is telling us will happen? How are you preparing your own children?

(And for a totally less downer of a question) are you doing an autograph tour or anything? I'd love to get a signed copy."
Quan-Su-Dude,fdo0ocp,t3_emcvqm,"Hi Sasha. Your father is an incredible gift to the world. I say *is* because his advice for thinking critically is timeless. For the past year, I have been reading his books and watching his lectures for the first time. I only have a few left to go through, and while it deeply saddens me, I'm elated to hear that you are writing now too. Really looking forward to reading your book.

My question is: Do you know what's in store for the new carlsagan.com site? It's been under construction for a while. It would be wonderful to buy unreleased lectures of his. As YouTube only has a handful."
jackconnery79,fdnxi5h,t3_emcvqm,"Ms. Sagan, 

Could you offer any words of encouragement for those of us disheartened by the continuing rise in science denialism?"
SashaSagan,fdnztv0,t1_fdnxi5h,"I feel you, I really do. But we are still moving in the right direction on the scale of millennia."
Spifftarsh,fdo4ji3,t1_fdnztv0,You get a gold star for patience & perspective. Soooooo difficult to pull oneself out of the mire of the moment and see the bigger picture!

SashaSagan,fdo0hyk,t1_fdnydut,"I think this requires some good ol' trial & error. You;ll know what feels useful and fulfilling, I think.  I also think part of the reason mindfulness and meditation are so popular right now among secular people is because we really do cave a little pattern to our days. I definitely do! I also think there are rituals we all do (say, making coffee!) that don't always feeling like rituals but can be little tiny celebrations of daily life."

What or who influenced those views in you? Do you know what or who inspired your father (if you know)?"
GaryOster,fdo25uq,t3_emcvqm,"I have, nebulously, felt for most of my life that Americans do not have sufficient rites of passage, such as when the community and family acknowledges a coming-of-age and begins to treat young adults as they do other adults.

aribryant2132,fdnud40,t3_emcvqm,"Hi Sasha, congratulations on the book, and I look forward to reading it in 2020. Thank you for continuing to advocate for skepticism and wonder.

Like millions of others, your dad inspired my husband and myself. We affectionately refer to him as Carl as if we knew him and could be on a first-name basis. My husband is working his dream job at JPL in Pasadena, and I also recently published a novella inspired by your dad's ideas. It's a climate fiction and science fiction story featuring science-based religion. I'm sure you get solicited the lot, but it doesn't hurt to ask: could you find time to read a preview of it at some point? Your feedback would be invaluable, but I understand if you're too busy."

Anyways, what is your opinion on the ritual of Santa? It's something my wife and I go back and forth on.

Website: Fiftysandwiches.com

So, after graduated college, I ran with an idea I had in high school, where I would travel the country trading lunches for interviews with homeless people throughout the US to put their stories and experiences into a book called Fifty Sandwiches.

After funding a Kickstarter in 2016, I began planning the trip, and a few months later took off on my solo journey in my $1200 van named Milo from my home base in Coeur d'Alene, ID. I taught myself photography throughout the trip and nervously began approaching people on the street and in shelters, in hopes of getting a 'collective face to homelessness'.

It took about 5 interviews in Portland for me to realize my mission was impossible, as I'd have to interview 500,000+ people to get an honest look at the homeless experience. I soon decided the mission of the project would be to capture the diversity and subsequent complexities of the homeless population, in hopes of showing that there is more to homelessness than being homeless.

Without a budget, an agent, editor, designer, etc, I had to learn a whole new set of 'skills' to finally push this thing out 3 YEARS after the trip was completed. I work full time, so I could only work on the book on weeknights and weekends. The amount of work was far beyond anything I could have ever predicted, and I still have a LONG way to go. But hey, I signed up for this, and few things worth doing are easy, it's my creation and I might as well complete it to the best of my abilities.

Thanks for reading and PLEASE bother me with any questions, concerns, or insults. I am all ears:)

_winterofdiscontent_,fe99myu,t3_eo6v03,So many questions spring to mind but can you start off with most compelling realization you've had during this project?  People like to think that homelessness is due to a fell swoop of bad luck or a series of misjudgments or even due to a mental or emotional disorder.  I've even heard it (callously) said that no one needs to be homeless if they don't want to be and they just need to sort themselves out.  What's your take on it?
fiftysandwiches,fe9hhfy,t1_fe99myu,"In short: homelessness is far more complex and diverse than we give it credit for. I was watching a TedTalk by  Chimamanda Adichie who said something like ""it's not that stereotypes are untrue, it's that they don't share the full story. 

If I have a book full of nothing but hardworking people facing adversity and pretend there’s no truth in stereotypes then I’m blinding my readers with my own ignorance. If I censor reality like that I give people a reason to doubt the validity of the profiles in the book. I spoke with drug addicts and alcoholics, I spoke with those suffering from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and I spoke with veterans and college graduates. Remember, some addicts might be veterans, others might have suffered tremendous abuse, others may be grieving the loss of a loved one, the list goes on. 

Simply understanding that each homeless person you walk by on a given day has a lifetime of experiences, stories, and struggles just as complex as your own is the key to humanizing the homeless."
fiftysandwiches,fe9gfjq,t1_fe99myu,"I watched this amazing TedTalk with (I think) Chimimanda Adichi, and she said: ""the thing with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, it's that they don't show the full story"".

Stereotypes are there for a reason- maybe human conditioning, maybe some hold them for personal protection for fear of the unknown. Ignorance is this blindfold, and it takes great humility to surrender your convictions and see issues for what they really are. In the case of homelessness, it's incredibly complex and diverse. That was my main takeaway.

For instance, if I talk with someone who is an addict, there's going to be more to it than that. I spoke to addicts who were veterans, some suffered tremendous physical and emotional abuse, others were grieving for lost family, for others it was an active choice, and they admitted that. To show the stereotype of an ""addict"" as nothing but takes away from every aspect of their life they've had up until that point."
_winterofdiscontent_,fe9j8vc,t1_fe9hhfy,"So there is a common factor of addiction?  Is that a cause or an effect?  Which begat which?

So the compelling realization is that stereotypes exist but the reasons we give for them are shallow and the result of our lack of compassion.  

Something happened on the train to work a couple of days ago.  There was a scruffy maybe 40ish year old man on the train who was obviously off his medication, if he even had any.  He was in his pyjama bottoms and a heavy-ish army drab coat.  He had long hair and a long beard.  And he was very upset, shouting to no one there about how unfair it all is, how the unseen antagonist was a murderer.  He got to the doors first when we hit the last stop.  As we all proceeded down the platform to the streets ahead, he turned around and shouted ""What do *you* all want!?!""  A few of us smiled broadly because it was so painfully adorable and painfully painful because he was in such distress but so damn cute at the same time.  

I don't know whether the man was homeless but he looked the part, for sure.  :(   

Are they really all addicts in that country?  That's really horrifying, don't you think?"
fiftysandwiches,fe9lvri,t1_fe9j8vc,"No- addiction is a horrible travesty that affects millions of people and leaves many homeless, but there is FAR more to homelessness than just addiction and mental health. I spoke with a woman who was homeless because she couldn't pay her mom's health bills after she died, I spoke with a man who was a veteran but stopped caring about anything after his daughter died, I spoke with a woman who was homeless because she left her insane, abusive husband, the list goes on. 

As far as addiction goes, in my opinion, homelessness and addiction follow each other. Addiction can obviously lead to homelessness, but homelessness can also lead to addiction. If find yourself at rock bottom, at the end of society's food chain, where people are crossing the street to avoid you, where you can't leave your camp without fear of things being stolen, and where you have to wonder where your next meal is, I can see escaping into the world of drugs as a realistic option. It's unhealthy, unethical, unproductive, but understandable. 

Lastly, I'd like to thank you for your questions. I can tell this is something you are very curious about and it means so much when people are willing to ask tough questions in search of tough answers. I'm no authority on the issue, I'm just some guy who has talked with a lot of shelters and homeless people, but I'll always try to provide insight where I can!"
_winterofdiscontent_,fe9n3gc,t1_fe9lvri,"Homelessness breaks my heart.  It cannot justified on any level.  This shouldn't be allowed to happen anywhere in the world and yet it happens to all people of all ages and for all the imaginable reasons, but not one of them is a good reason."
rootsnblueslover,febjy7b,t1_fe9lvri,">I spoke with a woman who was homeless because she couldn't pay her mom's health bills after she died

I wish more people knew they are not responsible for this sort of debt. This woman didn't have to go through this except that some avaricious and dishonest bill collector probably made her think she was."
_winterofdiscontent_,fe9jevi,t1_fe9j9cs,omg bot go away.
fiftysandwiches,fe9q8si,t1_fe9n3gc,I completely agree with you there
TranquilSeaOtter,fe9gw9i,t3_eo6v03,"Is there bias in your work towards interviewing those who are homeless because of any reason that doesn't include mental health? It seems like many who are on the streets are there because of a lack of support for their mental health and I was curious to know if you were able to interact with that population or if you stuck to interviewing people who were mentally sane but homeless due to other reasons (loss of job, etc.)."
fiftysandwiches,fe9kebf,t1_fe9gw9i,"Naturally, I cannot definitively state that there will be no bias, because I did pick and choose stories to be in the book. With that said, mental health is a huge part of the book, because it's a large part of the homeless population. I interviewed quite a few people suffering from mental health problems, and many are highlighted within the covers. 

I don't want to sound redundant, but I'm going to copy and paste what I put in another answer: ""If I have a book full of nothing but hardworking people facing adversity and pretend there’s no truth in stereotypes then I’m blinding my readers with my own ignorance. If I censor reality like that I give people a reason to doubt the validity of the profiles in the book. ""

 Now the book’s intent is to capture a glimpse, not the face, but a glimpse into what homelessness is.  A testament to the sheer diversity and subsequent complexities of the homeless population."
velainaraptor,fe9njc3,t3_eo6v03,"Would you spill all of your trauma, memories that hold shame, and stories of how you wound up where you are to a stranger for a cheap lunch (so that they can profit from it)? Is your life worth that little? If not, why treat strangers like theirs are?

Seriously, this feels gross and exploitative and I will take my downvotes and this opinion to my grave."
fiftysandwiches,fe9v0tr,t1_fe9njc3,"I'm upvoting this comment- I think critique and curiosity are really important for this project, and I think you have a very valid point. I've dealt with a lot of self-guilt throughout this process, driving down a line somewhere between journalism and exploitation, and I explain this all in the author's bio. Much of this project was a moral dilemma, where I am forced to weigh ego and hypocrisy, where my name on the spine sends chills up my own.  

This isn’t some project with steadfast conviction. The only aspects of the project that have not been questioned is that America’s homeless are in desperate need of a platform to be heard and understood and that I do not know what I am doing.

With that said, these interviews were much closer to intimate, informal discussions of two strangers sharing stories. I was surprised to see how many people were not just willing to share their experiences but eager to do so. Many people, especially those in a population so unheard and misconstrued, want the opportunity to have their stories told. I thought I would have great difficulty in finding people willing to share their stories with a complete stranger with a camera but was surprised to see just how many people were ready to share their experiences. Of course, I tried to dig a bit and find the philosophy behind the story and the story behind the philosophy. Humans Of New York takes a similar approach.

At shelters I visited (keep in mind these are people in the recovery process and more willing to share), they would even have a signup sheet because so many people were excited to have their story told. I've given your point a lot of thought, because in my mind how am I supposed to create a book based on the struggles of homeless people and expect it to be acceptable that I not share my own?  

I was denied interviews plenty of times- I'd say it's about 50/50- if I'm ommitting New York City- I must have asked 50 people in NYC before getting 1 anonymous interview. I guess the conclusion I came is this:

 I'm just a middle man, the channel through which these experiences are shared. I have no doubt that plenty of people share your perspective and for good reason. That's understandable, and I love hearing it because this is a community project built on the money of others (Kickstarter) and the stories of others, not mine. It came down to how the people felt when I interviewed them. Almost every interview ended with a hug, and I am NOT a hugger. I had people who stopped the interview halfway through, and I through the recording out. For the most part, however, these are stories that want to be told and need to be. A social crisis cannot be solved without first being understood. Chances are, I can't solve a damn thing, but maybe I can inspire who can. 

I'd love to hear your response to this if you get a chance! I don't mean to come across as ignorant, I'm genuinely curious because this perspective is something I've dealt with internally throughout the project."
thewhiterider256,feb9spb,t1_fe9njc3,"Yes, because at the end of the day someone is, at the very LEAST, taking their time to speak to and acknowledge the plight, problems, and very existence of the homeless, which is far more than 99.99% of us other assholes do."

That's the dichotomy - it's difficult for most people to evaluate and accept a ""balanced"" response to an emotionally loaded subject."
fiftysandwiches,febhorv,t1_feb9spb,"You are absolutely right. I'm not going to pretend that simply having a talk with someone might change their life, BUT it is incredibly important to realize how your perception might unknowingly affect those with less.

If you are homeless, you are in the most vulnerable state you can possibly be. You may be wondering when your next meal is, where you are going to sleep, etc. Imagine being in that mindset and having the general populace cast you out as some sort of outsider! In general, people I spoke to were very happy and appreciative to have the chance to tell their story, just as I appreciated the chance to hear it."
fiftysandwiches,feac6nq,t1_fea9kat,"I'm guessing those chances are slim, but same to you if you find yourself in North Idaho for whatever reason! :)"
fiftysandwiches,feac4a6,t1_feaaepw,"Thank you, I greatly appreciate that! I understand this is an emotional, complex, and sometimes divisive issue that people may have strong feelings about, myself included. 

I've learned a lot through both quantitative and qualitative research, so at this point, I am fairly confident of my beliefs regarding the project, even if that means consistently questioning my own motives and ethics.

When people are willing to share their critique on my project, I am always willing to listen. I can understand how someone believes this to be exploitation, and in all honesty, I cannot wholeheartedly disagree with them. Their points are valid, and they are making these points because they care. However, at this point, I'm trusting the voices of those I spoke to, and can take solace knowing that many were happy to share their story."
akak1972,fead7y9,t1_feac4a6,"Thank you for such a ... balanced and gracious response.

Look up the NY homeless living in unmapped underground tunnels if you haven't already done so. Especially those who never want to come up to the surface at all.

Edit: if you are a million miles done in the NY aspect - sorry - did not mean to be preachy"
smuggydick,febacsz,t1_feac4a6,If people were willing to share their stories with you that's their choice. I think that attitude comes from being mad on someone else's behalf when the group you interviewed doesn't feel that way is kind of weird and can be damaging. From your responses it seems you were very respectful to the people you interviewed and getting their story told is important for the ones the agreed to share. Congrats with actually getting out there to do the interviews.

fiftysandwiches,febhwhv,t1_febacsz,"Thank you, I greatly appreciate that. I agree with you on the basis of where that perspective may come from, and I understand it.

brain-eating-amoeba,fe9j68w,t3_eo6v03,"Collectively, what is it that the homeless people in America really want?

What I am trying to ask, from an elite, priveleged, full bellied, roof-over-my-head perspective it is easy for me to suggest what I think homeless people want from us.

Baloney.  I have never been there.  I don't know shit.

If the next President could give the Homeless people a gift, what is it THEY would want?"
fiftysandwiches,fe9kz1i,t1_fe9j68w,"That's a tough question. The easiest answer: to be seen as people.  My goal is to spread awareness and understanding. f I can make someone turn their head when they pass a homeless person I have done my job. When you turn your head you are deliberately giving your preconceived notions a second thought. The greatest adversity homelessness faces is ignorance, not being taken seriously as a real crisis in our country.  If I can turn your head, then I can force you to acknowledge that person’s existence and their struggles.  

The best thing that can be done (aside from fixing the problems that lead to homelessness: healthcare, mental health clinics, VA service, etc), is the donating and volunteering for long-term programs. The problem with this is that it still requires a great deal of effort from homeless individuals and families.

As much as we want to believe that helping a panhandler will solve the problem, short-term solutions don’t offer long-term stability. Helping with long-term programs ensures the efficiency of vital programs that actually work to get homeless people back up on their feet permanently. 

These programs demand consistency and dedication from the people they help. To be a member of the program, you need to get up at a certain time, you need to be back at the shelter at a certain time, and you need to prove your willingness to better yourself all the time. It’s not just a full-time job or commitment, it’s literally a lifestyle."

Hepcatoy,fe9jucm,t3_eo6v03,"Interesting project. 

Homelessness and mental illness seems to be a combination for some individuals. What was your experience with this? Did you encounter many people who could/ should be helped with their illness? What was your experience with psychiatric treatment with homelessness?

Thank you."
fiftysandwiches,fe9rbli,t1_fe9jucm,"I experienced a number of people suffering from mental illnesses. I learned throughout the project that homelessness isn't so much the issue; it's our failed social structures that allow people to fall through the cracks that is the issue. Homelessness is just the endgame consequence. 

I'm no authority on speaking about the psychiatric treatment of people who are homeless, but I can safely assume that the homeless experience will make any mental health issues far worse, or will spur mental issues and psychosis that were not there previously. The issue varies greatly, so it's very tricky to pin down individual treatments. Some are veterans, so the VA may be able to help there, some are sufferers of child abuse, the list goes on. 

Obviously I can't expect someone suffering from severe schiz to seek treatment on their own, so it's hard for me to say what the next move is there. There are plenty of amazing programs that help homeless people with mental health issues, but I don't know how a homeless person would even be aware of them, much less jump in to the demanding commitments required by these systems."
Hepcatoy,fe9w970,t1_fe9rbli,Thank you for your reply.
esquemo,febc305,t3_eo6v03,"I avoid homeless people because they seem dangerous.  There are cases of homeless people harming or killing people, including children (Elizabeth Smart and Jaycee Dugard) come to mind.  What’s would you recommend regarding direct interaction relative to this perception?

Also, do you, and why do you think this is a government or taxpayer problem to solve?   They seem able to get to populated areas and mooch off of people, why can’t they earn a living instead of begging?"
fiftysandwiches,febgsqt,t1_febc305,"That's an instinctual reaction, and one I can't really blame you for. It's natural to be apprehensive around those who we may perceive as dangerous, and unfortunately, homeless people often fall into that category. I suspect this stereotype is due to mental illnesses and addiction. As I've mentioned in this thread, stereotypes aren't untrue, they just don't represent the entire story. You might see the homeless man on the street corner yelling his voice away at strangers, but you won't see the family sleeping in their car in the Walmart parking lot. 

This makes direct interaction difficult in street settings, but I truly think if you visited a long-term program, you would be surprised to see the types of people who find themselves at rock bottom. Many Americans are just a paycheck away from being homeless themselves. 

Based on your 2nd question, you seem to just be referring to panhandlers or those who choose to be homeless. (correct me if I'm wrong). I don't have the exact statistic on hand, but that is only a small portion of the homeless population. Personally, I rarely give to panhandlers and don't really encourage others to do so. It's important to remember that most of the homeless population are the people you don't see: those living in long-term programs, day shelters, their cars, tucked away in camps, etc. Homelessness is an incredibly diverse group of people, so to suggest they are all panhandlers or beggers is simply ignoring those who were just introduced to the unexpected with nowhere to go. 

There are 500,000is homeless people at any given point in the United States, but 3 million people experience homelessness in one year. So although there are many chronically homeless individuals, the system for the vast majority is a revolving door, where people who recently lost their job, had unexpected health bills, etc, find themselves with nothing left. 

The idea of it being an easy task to find a job and earn a living right off the bat isn't quite as simple as many would think. Personally, I think it would be difficult to find a job that pays any sort of livable wage without a phone, address, possibly without a nice set of clothes, a computer, etc. There are a lot more barriers to getting out of homelessness than meets the eye!

Hopefully I answered some of your questions here, let me know if you have more:)"
sight_ful,febm7tq,t1_febc305,"To address your first paragraph, there are also cases of homeless people going out of their way to help and save others. They are people who do good and bad things just like the rest of us. Always keep aware, but it is not likely that someone will attack you or anything just from talking to them on the street.

In fact, looking at the two cases you mentioned, neither one was in the setting you are imagining. In Smart’s case, she was abducted from home, and in Dugard’s case she was abducted by a passing car. Are you sure any of those abductors were even homeless? I didn’t find any mention of that anywhere. I’m not really sure why you brought up those two cases in regards to avoiding homeless people on the street."
esquemo,febo7ms,t1_febgsqt,"Great answers, thanks for your time.  I agree with everything you said here, and look forward to your book.  You chose a tough challenge, nice job!  Looks like you’re going to make a difference in the world."
esquemo,febnvtg,t1_febm7tq,"The Smart kidnapper was a homeless guy that her parents hired to do little chores around the house to pay him and he took their daughter.  Jaycee was tased and taken in a car, so maybe they weren’t homeless."
mayonaise_plantain,febeui4,t3_eo6v03,"Malcom Gladwell has a wonderful little excerpt is his book, ""What the Dog Saw"" about homelessness and how the portion of ""long term homeless"" people follow a sharp hockey stick curve. That is - there is a very small portion of homeless who are continually on and off the streets for years and years, apparently suffering far worse off from addiction and sickness than the mass majority of homeless who are short term and only in need of temporary boosts to often never return to the streets after one or two stints of leas than 30 days.

My question is: did you see this curve in your travels, or could you speak to it? 

Gladwell's book was published in the 2000s, so his sources may be out of date by now, but I often find myself thinking of that excerpt.

Thanks!"
Mala-Dee,febwc8h,t3_eo6v03,"My original comment was quickly removed and this might follow too but here we go: 

You will never understand and capture what homelessness is unless you are homeless yourself. Not for 4 months, not ""pretend"" but without a safety net, without any contact with family and friends, without knowing where your next meal is coming from or if there will be a tomorrow for you. You can't pause your life and try to understand something so out of your reach because you have never experienced the raw fear of not having a safe place to even sit down. Turning a major problem into a curiosity you can publish is at best selfish.  How self-absorbed are you really? Why not do a Kickstarter to help these people instead of funding your cross-country vacation?"

WinterText,fe0gwj8,t3_enkdy5,what should we stay away from? And what is your favorite menu item?
ethancaseroll,fe0h3ag,t1_fe0gwj8,"Ice for your drinks, order a water with ice and look into ur cup. And you’ll get a feel for what I mean - also thanks for asking. I asked for a personalised meal which is a Big Mac, but I get it all put in a wrap."
marcoroman3,fe4fqoy,t1_fe0h3ag,Could you maybe just tell us what us wrong with the ice? I'm not planning on going to McDonald's any time soon.
WinterText,fe0i0kg,t1_fe0h3ag,"thx, dude. I know it's a hard job and people treat you like shit. appreciate your service."
Glassclose,fe6ahfi,t1_fe0h3ag,ive tried to explain this to so many and it amazes me how they think i am full of shit about ice machines being filthy.
dirtymoney,fe5tqqe,t1_fe0h3ag,"Then I get the ""you're a cheap fuck!"" look when I do that. I AM cheap, but I order no ice for a practical reason. So I don't have watered down soda by the time I get home. I don't drink in my vehicle."
nuggetboob,fe0p3xv,t1_fe0h3ag,"Welp that’s disturbing, no more iced chocolates for me."
SmokeSerpent,fe677z3,t1_fe0h3ag,"Well, most restaurants don't fully clean the soda dispensing nozzles daily either. Whenever I would inspect one of my stores (not McDonalds) for an inspection if they were acting cocky about how clean things were, I would head straight to those soda nozzles."
Kveldson,fe4zw5k,t1_fe4fqoy,"I used to manage a Subway and I've worked in many restaurants in my life. If you don't clean the ice machine every other day ( which will never happen it is time consuming and when you do it it takes hours for the ice machine to replenish the ice you had to throw away in order to clean it) ice machines will build up all manner of mold and slimy gunk very quickly. I always request no ice from anywhere I go. Unfortunately, I also have to suggest staying away from drinks in restaurants and other fountains in general including tea and unsweet tea. The nozzles on Fountain machines or supposed to be cleaned regularly, but most places do not and you would not believe the disgusting slimy Gunk inside of those nozzles, nor the types of mold and stuff that will grow inside of the nozzle for a tea dispenser."
ethancaseroll,fe5gtv4,t1_fe4fqoy,"There isn’t much cleaning or filtering, so it’s dirty water that gets frozen."
wagon153,fe4gfel,t1_fe4fqoy,"Most restaurants don't clean the ice machine very often, if at all. This isn't limited to McDonalds either."
lkeels,fe5gd39,t1_fe4fqoy,Mold
usernameinvalid9000,fe602uk,t1_fe4fqoy,"Ice machines in restaurants and bars are rarely emptied and cleaned out, there will be all sorts of shite mixed in with it."
ethancaseroll,fe0i6p1,t1_fe0i0kg,your very welcome!
joahdb2004,fe5u6hy,t1_fe0i0kg,"I've worked at McDonald's and I still bitch. The problem, at least here in the states, is the majority fast food is their first job (like me). The majority of these guys, haven't learned any sort of work ethic. I hate that I have to be accept if I want fast food, I have to assume its going to be fucked up. Jack in the box is just  the WORST where I live."
ethancaseroll,fe64e5t,t1_fe5tqqe,I’m sorry to hear the rude attitude being  presentes by front counter.
Trippingthewire,fe6k018,t1_fe5tqqe,I don't get how anyone would think your cheap for asking for no ice.
ethancaseroll,fe5gze6,t1_fe4zw5k,I can ensure my restaurant gets the hoses and nozzles cleaner every Sunday.
Serkys,fe5b9d6,t1_fe4zw5k,"I can back this up.  Indeed, most anything that liquids come out of isn't cleaned often or at all, in many restaurants.   I've even worked for very expensive Italian restaurants where the same applies.  Right down to the water faucets having grime.  LOTS of places with protein in the ice cubes...   About the only machine I can think of that was actually cleaned regularly anywhere was the soft-serve machines, because it was my personal specialty and they actually won't function if they aren't cleaned regularly,  so it's not easily a choice."
GrassrootsYangGang,fe5mduf,t1_fe4zw5k,"I will say I used to work at Olive Garden and was very happy with our cleanliness. I can't speak for every Olive Garden, but we cleaned our ice bins every night, along with our nozzles for teas. On another note, the trays we carry everything on only get cleaned once a day (supposed to be more often) Ew"
brain-eating-amoeba,fe9kmsd,t1_fe4zw5k,"I figure I am immune to all that stuff at this point.

Really, my biggest concern is building up my kids immunity."
Sk1tzo420,fe61fxn,t1_fe4gfel,"I learned at a 15 years old to clean all the ice machines, and tea nozzles. After that every place I worked in I would clean the ice machine, if not for the customers, then for myself. 

Two places I worked said it wasn’t necessary(subway and hooters), and I called the health dept and left an anon tip about them. Next inspection both places got dinged for it and then it became routine."
ethancaseroll,fe5guta,t1_fe4gfel,That’s very true.
ethancaseroll,fe5h1iv,t1_fe5gd39,Oldmay
Kveldson,fe5muzo,t1_fe5gze6,"I don't doubt it, there's always going to be exceptions to the rule but my experience and everyone I nose experiences that they don't get cleaned in the vast majority of restaurants"
ethancaseroll,fe5n211,t1_fe5muzo,Thanks for your comment!
superweevil,fe6qut1,t1_fe5n211,Not sure about where you are but at my local Macca's (Australian name for mcdonalds) they fill up half the cup with ice and then put the drink in so there is barely and drink because the ice takes up too much space.
