Life's gotta be hell painful for this fellow."
princess_myshkin,fe67g2o,t1_fe4rwjz,"I am all for calling out how we have horribly messed up dogs with selective breeding, like any day of the week. But this guy is actually insanely healthy looking for a bulldog, I don‚Äôt like to shit-talk where it isn‚Äôt due. 

First off, you can *actually* see his snout. On average, most bulldogs now look like you bashed their face in with a shovel. Like you literally cannot see a snout at all. This leads to (aside from obvious breathing issues, I‚Äôm focusing on physical cues) noses that get dry/chapped easily. I‚Äôve seen a bulldog with half of his nose falling off because it wasn‚Äôt being moisturized. This dog has quite a healthy nose. 

This dogs face is also surprisingly symmetric and crudely speaking, not-too-fucked-up looking. No protruding teeth or anything. He can actually sit there with his mouth closed. His eyes are clean and not too sunken. 

Also, being as white as he is, you would easily notice a yeast infection taking place on his skin, which looks straight up yellow. He looks super clean, so overall the owner seems to do a good job keeping up with the care of this doggo. 

Also, the dog isn‚Äôt actually that fat, the owner put a little fat suit on him. 

Continue to fight the good fight of calling out dog breeding BS, I‚Äôm right there with you. But this should show how bulldogs *could* be if we didn‚Äôt fuck them up."

marianita84,fe3s763,t1_fe3kmez,Is it the protruding stomach or something else?
Godfatherman21,fe4o3l7,t1_fe3kmez,Like what?
seeyouspacecowboyx,fe4esqo,t1_fe3s763,"Vets have to teach owners how to clean the skin folds because it's so bad for the dogs to have all that loose skin that can get infected. Flat faces means too short snouts which means severe breathing difficulties, owners have to stop the dogs playing and exercising too much especially in hot weather. That's no life for a dog. And if all that wasn't proof enough that this is a breed that couldn't evolve that way and is only like that through human intervention, bulldogs can't reproduce naturally anymore, they have to be artificially inseminated and birthed by caesarian. All that screams that it's not natural selection at work, vets have called breeding them animal cruelty but for some reason breeders aren't cracked down on.

I watched this horrible documentary about pedigree dogs where they interviewed kennel club members who tried to wave away the fact they force their dogs to inbreed even though they know why it would be wrong for humans to, for instance, mate parent to child or grandparent to grandchild. And the RSPCA spokesman talked about how bad it is - given how litigious they are I don't know why they let breeders carry on this way. I cried all the way through that documentary. Dogs are supposed to be full of joy, how anyone can knowingly deliberately breed disabled dogs is beyond me."

Killer_Queenz,fe4l22k,t1_fe4esqo,It was this that stopped me buying a traditional English bulldog even though I love bulldogs. Went for an American one instead. Bred for actual work not just showing and looks so he‚Äôs a strong healthy dog

PurpleT0rnado,fe4l7nv,t1_fe4esqo,I thought it was just the (tiny) French Bulldogs that can‚Äôt breed?
seeyouspacecowboyx,fe4tr7b,t1_fe4n70j,"If you want to cry for about a solid hour, watch the documentary, Pedigree Dogs Exposed. It is informative about the sorts of disabilities I alluded to and the dodgy breeding practices. But don't say I didn't warn you it's very sad. But I do think dog owners and dog lovers should definitely watch it, to be able to make more responsible decisions."
seeyouspacecowboyx,fe4ukkz,t1_fe4l22k,"Crufts has a lot to answer for. According to the documentary, there is basically a separate breeding stock for police dogs in the UK from the German shepherds civilians breed and buy. So buying one that's bred to work rather than to be a pet can result in getting a much healthier, more reliable dog, bred for intelligence and physical fitness not warped ideas of appearance that actually make it less fit and healthy."

WikiTextBot,fe4t1sl,t1_fe4t0y9,"**Pedigree Dogs Exposed**

Pedigree Dogs Exposed is a BBC One investigative documentary, produced by Jemima Harrison, which looks into health and welfare issues facing pedigree dogs in the United Kingdom. It was originally broadcast on 19 August 2008.

The Kennel Club (KC), the governing body of pedigree dogs in the UK which runs the prestigious dog breed show Crufts, was criticised for allowing breed standards, judging standards and breeding practices to compromise the health of pedigree dogs.The programme generated much criticism of the Kennel Club. It also caused various sponsors and trade exhibitors to withdraw their participation from Crufts and other Kennel Club events.

 Maybe it has something to do with the smell of the owner, since we have a very strong bond with our pup.

However, he knows that it's not his bed and he's not really allowed to sleep there, so whenever I get back, he does that ""I know I can't sleep here, but could we make an exception this time?"" look. And for him to leave, one simple command is enough. 

Funny thing is that if he has to leave, he shows his disappointment in an audible way - grumbling and sighing."
