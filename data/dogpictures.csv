bartmaniv,fdw0swk,t3_en6hvy,"What can I say except 
Thank you!( I rescued a
Two yr old Female Corgi on 26 Aug 2014,, she is the light of my life)"
69vuman,fdw7t8f,t3_en6hvy,Thanks for doing a good think.
signequanon,fdw9783,t3_en6hvy,Such a beautiful and happy dog. Looks just like my rescue Sally.
jamesbarks,fdv5sbw,t3_en6hvy,Content boye
spoikyvoid,fdwkkm7,t3_en6hvy,Why are kill shelters even a thing?
schwarzmorgen,fdxzapz,t1_fdwkkm7,"Every shelter that is funded by the city or government is a kill shelter or has the possibility of being a kill shelter. Rescues are no kill because they get to go to shelters and cherry pick which dogs they want to take. Shelters are legally obligated to take in any abandoned or stray animal. Therefore if the community is responsible for their own animals then the shelters don‚Äôt have to kill because there is plenty of space. There are good and bad shelters, but every shelter kills. Not because they want to, because they have to. 
Source: work for vet hospital and shelter in AMERICA"
RoseOfSharonCassidy,fdyfxye,t1_fdwkkm7,"They have to exist, because there are more dogs than there are people who want a dog.  The only solution is to eliminate irresponsible breeding.  Breeders should only breed if they know they have homes lined up before they even breed a litter, and they should offer to take back any dog they bred if the owner can't keep it."
RoseOfSharonCassidy,fdygujw,t1_fdxzapz,">There are good and bad shelters, but every shelter kills. Not because they want to, because they have to. 

Depends on where you live, there are some areas (mostly wealthy places) where there isn't a huge stray problem and shelters will only euthanize for health reasons or extremely dangerous behavioral issues (not simple things like being reactive, but actually vicious dogs)."
Kimbo99,fe00v5j,t1_fdxzapz,I work for a no kill shelter (in New Zealand). We NEVER put an animal to sleep. There are a couple that will live their lives out with us as they cannot be rehomed. Also our dogs are ours for the life of the dog. If for any reason you have to give up your dog it must come back to us so we can find it another home. I love my shelter.
schwarzmorgen,fe03ddb,t1_fdygujw,Yes!! True!
schwarzmorgen,fe03918,t1_fe00v5j,"I live in America so I can‚Äôt speak to other countries. But what you sound like describes my shelter, but we aren‚Äôt an actual city shelter. We are a non profit rescue. So we aren‚Äôt mandated to take every animal. City shelters which are funded by the city must take in every animal."
Kimbo99,fe03elo,t1_fe03918,We also are not funded. I suppose those that are that are obligated would find it real difficult. I dont think I could work in one of those. My house would be full of unwanted dogs.
schwarzmorgen,fe03jnx,t1_fe03elo,Hahaha I agree! I worked the spay/neuter program for a year at an actual shelter and it killed me. I also volunteered with their pitbull program and it was terrible knowing every week or so that animals I played with and loved prior had been euthanized for space.
mabealco_,fdwrxsq,t3_en6hvy,"Wow, you can truly see he is at ease now. I‚Äôm so happy for you both! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Thai_Mango,fdxllv3,t3_en6hvy,I‚Äôd like to shampoo myself with whatever kind of shampoo he‚Äôs using pls.
chzplz,fdweyq3,t3_en6hvy,Where are these shelters that are not just pit bulls and chihuahuas???
lmaobadatmath,fdx4kmm,t1_fdweyq3,What's wrong with saving a chihuahua or a pitbull?
RoseOfSharonCassidy,fdyg56c,t1_fdx4kmm,"There's nothing wrong with it saving a pit/chih, but people should get dogs that fit their lifestyle, and not everyone has a lifestyle that can accommodate those breeds."
sapinho0420,fdxgayu,t1_fdx4kmm,"I think he/she means that shelters are full of pits and chihuahuas, that‚Äôs all."
StupidlyShy,fdzw8iz,t1_fdx4kmm,Not everyone wants a pit or chihuahua. Those breeds have certain temperaments and needs that may not match the person wanting to adopt. People should adopt what feels right for them.
PegShop,fdz0qls,t1_fdyg56c,This.
atworkobviously,fdwa52m,t3_en6hvy,Thanks for being awesome. Your dog looks like he's contemplating some heavy shit.

lars2you,fdzxzzz,t3_en6hvy,My dog is from GA too! We live in the North East and they ship a lot of strays up here to give them a better chance at getting adopted. She has a nurturing scar that looks like they were harvesting organs(literally her entire torso). We believe she had at least two litters before age two. She is the sweetest most well behaved angel. Love my Georgia peach. What a handsome boy you have! Best of luck.

Pnwhkrn2dogs,fdnwo00,t1_fdnwcqo,I expected to get this comment. No worries. I always keep him leashed but this was in the far Northern Edge where you almost never run into anyone. And he was just off lease for the photo.
littlechacha,fdpgzd4,t1_fdnwo00,I can't take my dog on walks because of unleashed dogs.  Thank you for only doing this when you're near no one.
Pnwhkrn2dogs,fdpij3z,t1_fdpgzd4,I used to own a dog aggressive pup. I totally understand the need for leashes. Luckily I live near a dog park that is over a thousand acres and I take them there all the time. But now when I Montreal's I do keep them leashed. It's not worth the trouble.

16cantom,fdit6fe,t1_fdii5aa,Thank you! He's irresistible. Even when he's bad he's too cute to yell at haha
ratedarf,fdiuxb3,t1_fdit6fe,He‚Äôs precious and you can see his incredible capacity to love. Puppies love to bite and chew everything. But I promise they do grow out of that. Video him as much as you can. I love my photos but I regret not having more video of my dogs when they were puppies.
16cantom,fdiw3yp,t1_fdiuxb3,"Thank you for your kind words and advice. His chewing and biting is nothing we haven't expected and all in all he's an amazing dog. I will say I don't use my camera nearly as much as I'd like but my brother is younger and loves taking pictures and videos so we are very fortunate! His growth has been amazing to watch. Also as I type this he just ran away with a shoe I accidentally left out, here we go again!"
ratedarf,fdiyoii,t1_fdiw3yp,Bless you for truly understanding the nature of dogs and appreciating the good and the naughty of puppyhood. What a gift to have so many pictures and videos. I treasure mine. Our dogs are the reason we don‚Äôt have slippers anymore ‚Äî those and our crown molding were their favorite things to chew on when they were teething.
16cantom,fdiyus2,t1_fdiyoii,"Haha glad to hear someone is in the same shoes (ha ha)! My brother is actually 8 years younger so I remember very well him being a baby and toddler, puppyhood seems to not be much different! We have found the ""bully sticks"" to be a great distraction between watching him attack his toys and us."
def_not_a_hippie,fdijpbh,t3_elizjs,Thanks i love him
16cantom,fdit42l,t1_fdijpbh,Thank you. We love him too üòÅ
walterpeck1,fdixd8a,t3_elizjs,I too know the plight of the bitey puppy... I found keeping a toy with me at all times to redirect those teeth to something productive was a big help. Now I have a huge dog that rarely if ever chews on anything but dog toys.
16cantom,fdixsjg,t1_fdixd8a,You better bet we have tons of toys for him to bite. We learned the distraction technique on the first day of having him. Hopefully he will be the same as your dog soon and will only play with toys (though I'll admit his biting is kind of cute).
pumpkinmuffincat95,fdjuz3d,t1_fdixsjg,Bitter bite spray is a godsend if he chews shoes furniture pillows etc.
walterpeck1,fdk2nwm,t1_fdixsjg,Yeah it never even occurred to me until I had a puppy that they had baby teeth. So thinking of it as teething helped. Ours loved the smaller kong bones at that age since they were tough rubber that he could dig into but it massaged his gums.
16cantom,fdk9rxh,t1_fdjuz3d,Thank you for the suggestion! I've never heard of it but we'll have to try it out.
16cantom,fdk9wtk,t1_fdk2nwm,"Haha yes, the baby teeth that are small razors too! He really enjoys bully sticks and stuffed toys which he has plenty of. The fire hose material toys that make a ""crackle"" sound also seem to be of interest when he needs to chew."

It is non-toxic and won‚Äôt hurt you or pup, but it does taste nasty. I would recommend wearing gloves while you spray it, and don‚Äôt do it right before eating. It sticks to your hands and can ruin dinner!"
walterpeck1,fdkczeu,t1_fdk9wtk,Yeah ours is a power chewer with a huge jaw so I highly recommend unsplit moose antlers if he gets real big and gets bored with plastic toys. Ours loved the damn thing and whittled it down to a tiny nub that he was very sad to see thrown away. They can be expensive but it kept him focused if he was being onery.
16cantom,fdke84z,t1_fdke65b,"You're awesome! I'll definitely try to pick some up soon, thank you!"
16cantom,fdke66h,t1_fdkczeu,That's a great idea! I've actually never heard of using a moose antler but it sounds like it would work very well. He's still a bit small since he's young so carrying around something too big proves difficult (though it is cute to watch) but I'll make sure to check it out! Thank you again!
16cantom,fdiw96x,t3_elizjs,"This is our little pup Odin. My brother and I have been begging for a dog for as long as I can remember. As Thanksgiving was approaching this year I got a call from my brother telling me that mom and dad had said we could get a dog! As I'm currently away in college, I jumped on the computer and immediately started looking in my home town for puppies up for adoption. While my parents said they didn't want a puppy, I sent my mom a picture of one of the puppies at Odin's shelter and she was convinced instantly and called to schedule a visit.

When the day came, my parents and brother went to the adoption center and video called me so I could see the puppies too. When they got there, they were informed the puppy we had seen before was a mistake and had actually been adopted months earlier. While they were a bit sad at first, a new litter of puppies had just come in from Tennessee as they were discovered alongside their mom who had sadly passed. Immediately our little guy Odin ran up to my mom and jumped up on her and when she picked him up he nuzzled right into her neck. He did the same to my brother and dad and we knew it was meant to be so we applied to adopt him.

That weekend I made the trip home from college and we went to go pick up our new puppy. I couldn't have been more happy and cried once I saw him. At the time he was only 8 weeks old and was a chubby little pup. We took him home after filling out the paperwork and getting him his bed, treats, food, etc. And immediately couldn't get enough of him.

He's now about 16 weeks old and gained just around 12 lbs since we got him. He's a bit of a biter as all puppies are but absolutely LOVES people and animals of all ages. When we take him for walks he'll strangle himself on the leash just to get to a little kid or other dog. He's definitely an alpha dog in some situations but is not aggressive under any circumstances. We're working on training him with a trainer he's known since arriving in our State. As with many rescues we have no idea what breed or mix he is but we think definitely some boxer and Shepherd in there, this just makes us love him more! We can't wait for him to be fully grown and take him camping and on all types of adventures!!

Edit: Added some more details. Note this is from my other post in r/aww"
athanathios,fdjw9xk,t1_fdiw96x,"Incredible, sounds like you found him and he found you! I got my girl (now 4) at 9 weeks old and met her at 8 weeks. It sounds like he's so great and he'll be the best dog. Have fun during his teen years, give him all the love, thanks for sharing!"

We think he is some sort of boxer/Shepherd mix as it's the closest we've seen to his coloring, ears, and face. My mom actually was given a DNA test for him by a co-worker so we hope to find out soon! Thank you!!"
katherinez,fdk5s3m,t3_elizjs,"For our bitey puppy I kept cow hooves EVERYWHERE. They smell bad but went right in his mouth whenever he was bitey. He is a cattle dog mix and herds. To this day when I walk in the door I have a piece of paper in my hand and it goes right in his mouth. This replaced the behaviour of him biting out hands or clothes to be herded in to the door  He carries it to the couch and let's go of it when I sit and pet him. Works every time!

Congrats on the new cutie!"

CringeAF2,fdgtlji,t1_fdgswga,"it‚Äôs just so crazy to me like if you‚Äôre already doing this illegal insanely fucking wrong thing like puppy mills, why the FUCK do you torture the dog when it‚Äôs already dying? it‚Äôs already had one of the shittiest lives it could possibly have and it‚Äôs already on the brink of death. some people are just plain cruel."
laurie911,fdgv2tr,t1_fdgswga,"The first of our 2 rescues came from a puppy mill. She's a Boston named Ally. I have no idea how old she is but when we got her, her poor nipples hung so low. She is a fabulous dog. So calm and behaved. I'm an RN at a rehab and often take her to work with me."
ILoveWildlife,fdhe96e,t1_fdgswga,why those horrible methods though?
laurie911,fdgv5ep,t1_fdgtlji,I keep reminding myself when I see awful stories like this that karma has no fucking deadline....
dogsyaypeoplenay,fdiucfh,t1_fdgtlji,"They see them as tools rather than living, feeling beings. I used to volunteer with a rescue that cared  for a lot if puppy mill victims. It was horrific.  The millers were plain evil. After trying to run us down with her SUV, one woman actually said to me that they were equipment and tools of her trade. The dogs that were rescued from her mill were near death, missing limbs, missing eyes. Some didn't survive the trip to the emergency vet. I would never wish cancer in anyone, but might have felt like celebrating when she was diagnosed and suffering."

bananasplitter93,fdh7umv,t1_fdgvqy9,"Maybe they thought they could cremate it and leave no evidence? Still seems like shooting it first would be more efficient. They're not just bad people, they're not good at what they do either."
CringeAF2,fdh817v,t1_fdh7umv,maybe so but i feel like since they‚Äôre already doing puppy mills in the first place they really don‚Äôt give a shit about being efficient. they must love to watch the dogs be tortured or something. fucking sick

thirdhex,fdgyk0a,t3_el9qpa,"That‚Äôs awesome, I‚Äôve adopted a dog that was dumped at the shelter from a puppy mill, she was dumped because she went into heat so soon after weening her first set of pups, she was useless to them. She was underweight at 9lbs. Filled out to a nice 15lbs after I brought her home. She had also scratched off all her fur from being so infested with fleas when she got to the shelter. (She was a beautiful one year old Boston, that my aunt, who was doing dog rescue and called up the shelter to keep her from being put down the night before we could go the 3hrs to go see her) I saw in as bad shape as she was, she wasn‚Äôt ready to go, you could see it in her eyes and ended up being one of the best dogs I‚Äôve ever had. She passed on at the age of 16 a year ago, but lived a full life with me. I moved across the country and she came with. When her eyesight started to go we found her two balls, one that clashed with the grass outside, one that clashed with the hardwood inside, so she could still make them out and would still have to get her to stop playing so she didn‚Äôt overtire herself. The best $30 I‚Äôve ever spent (she was half off because she was gonna be put down). I know how great these dogs are and how much happiness and love they have to give you. Congratulations on making one of the best choices you ever will. And I‚Äôm sure her friend will appreciate it as much as she does."

schirmyver,fdrajgf,t3_emr9jr,"Makes me really miss our dogs. We had two Berners and a Leo. They all loved the snow and cold, but our last Berner hated the rain and getting her paws wet. She was a bit of a princess.

The_LeadDog,fdrq030,t3_emr9jr,Trying to train my springer to ring bell to come in. What kind of bell do you have?
Jovvidee,fdrqwzs,t1_fdrq030,Just a chain of bells I hang on the door itself. There‚Äôs a ton of videos showing how to train in YouTube. He‚Äôs the first one bell trained and I won‚Äôt ever go back. Every dog I have going forward will be bell trained!
pegmatitic,fdscfa9,t1_fdrqwzs,"Our dog trained *us* ... she hits the brass ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù sign on my boyfriend‚Äôs office door with her nose when she wants to go out, or if she wants to go out on the balcony she‚Äôll rattle the blinds. I should probably get her some bells!"
Sylliec,fdstg78,t1_fdrqwzs,Its so funny but I bought these decorative bells and ended up hanging them on my front door knob until I could figure out where the bells should go. And my dog started ringing the bells whenever she wants out (or to get me to stand up and attend to her). She actually taught herself (and me) to use them. And this is a dog who isn‚Äôt the sharpest knife in the drawer (but she is the sweetest).
Cuttlery,fdsfmoo,t3_emr9jr,Our Berner here in Minnesota is in her element right now.   She‚Äôs picked out a nice snow bank on the back yard to nap on
maggiewaggy,fdqfgqy,t3_emr9jr,You would think that animals are smart enough to know their own limits. Humans often don‚Äôt know their own limits. As pet parents I guess we need to look out for them. Bernies seem like they are built for cold weather though.
Jovvidee,fdqfrtd,t1_fdqfgqy,"Berners are bred in the Swiss alps, my boy is actually 2 gen American. I don‚Äôt worry about him until it gets in the negatives, and even then he‚Äôs probably fine.

Stumbling_Corgi,fdjzyg0,t1_fdjyzcr,"My best friend for sure. 

Pluses and minuses are subjective really. They‚Äôre an energetic breed that needs walks or runs. They can be demanding if they used to getting one and then don‚Äôt. They shed a fair amount twice a year, Spring and fall.  They‚Äôre a healthy breed with few risks. They‚Äôre a herding breed that can nip, so Know what you‚Äôre getting into. These may not sound like recommendations, but I Love this breed. If you want a little dog to fit a semi active lifestyle they‚Äôre great for that. The internet loves this dog and paints them in awesome ways but read into the breed a bit before you decide. They‚Äôre extremely smart and easy to train but this comes at a cost, they need stimulation when you‚Äôre not around, like puzzles, bones to chew, something to keep them thinking or else like any dog they will get mischievous. 

I Loved my Ein to pieces. If you‚Äôre looking for a dog that will go with you places this is the one."

questionableK,feamy3t,t3_eo864x,The Dr just emailed me the results of the masses they removed during her surgery. She had two different forms of very aggressive cancer. She wouldn‚Äôt have had much time left and it was possible it had already spread into her organs.  I miss her so much but it makes me feel a little better that she didn‚Äôt suffer for a long time and that I made the right decision with surgery.

Queen_of_Outer_Space,fdqbo5f,t3_emqrl1,Did this a year ago...remaining dog (who is older) can‚Äôt be alone...ever...lost his lifelong partner in crime and just still hasn‚Äôt figured how to move on...
MimiMyMy,fdqukfu,t1_fdqbo5f,I‚Äôm going through this right now. Lost our youngest dog to heart failure a couple of months ago. Our last remaining dog who is older has been in depression. We had lost 2 others dogs previously and he handled it fine. I was quite surprised that he is having such a hard time with this recent loss since he was never close to our youngest dog. We have trouble getting him to eat sometimes. He doesn‚Äôt go outside as much and he rarely window watch anymore. He just wants to sleep all day. We have arranged frequent play dates and sleepovers with other family dogs which perks him up some. We have thought about getting another dog but not sure if that is wise either. The older dog has always been kind of a loner. He never really accepted the younger dog.
smln_smln,fdssviy,t1_fdqbo5f,That makes me so sad but it‚Äôs also very true. Not our dog but our male cat left a year ago and his best friend has never been the same and no amount of human love has filled her void.

Sylliec,fdt6gym,t1_fdt5vb8,You are lucky to have them so long. My dog is 15 years old and I feel lucky she is doing so well. And I am super conscious of the clock ticking away so I am more attentive and loving.
Kiremino,fdt6p6d,t1_fdt6gym,I'm the same way with my boy and my girl. I picked up my boy the other day and his shoulder crunched (he's old not because I hurt him or anything) and I just QUICKLY put him down and fed him treats. It hurts knowing how old he's getting...
