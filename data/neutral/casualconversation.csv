UnlikelyReplacement,emclm6,top_level,"My high school has 3 graduation periods (December, May, June). Most of my friends graduated in May, I did so in June so they weren't there (it's a boarding school so most people don't live in the city). The people just before me had really loud applause, I got scattered applause and a small group of my friends being obnoxiously loud and I was happy that they decided to be so loud.

When I started university I decided to be that obnoxious clapper to make the folks on stage feel good. I tried in the first December graduation but they didn't let me in. I tried again in ~~May~~ June and got in. Finessing your way into the ceremony in ~~May~~ June is super easy. It's so large that if you come 15 minutes late - wearing a suit and looking annoyed - nobody asks any questions, nobody checks your ticket, nothing. I switch seats regularly just to shake things up. I hate sitting still for the 3 hour ceremony but I think it makes them feel better so why not?

So far I've been to 4.

*Edit:* Wrong month. Not May, June."

UnlikelyReplacement,fdnq8zs,t1_fdnowk3,"Thanks for the compliment! It's no great sacrifice so I figured ""why not?"" It takes 7 hours out of my day at most. but it's only 3 days so, meh. 

It's too bad I can't go for all since they have 3 to 4 time slots a day. I do only the first 2 (morning and afternoon)."

blueishblackbird,fdomza6,t1_fdnq8zs,Bring a few friends and make it a thing. Then it wouldn’t be weird at all. Then go talk to people after and congratulate them and make some new friends. That would take it to another level. Maybe take some loners out for drinks after. That could turn someone’s whole year around.

As in, if people acted like they didn't know you as a joke because they didn't like you, at least you can rationalize that. If people genuinely don't know who you are, that's worse and can make you feel like no one cares about you, which most people would find worse I think.

FerdinandRusdelton,fdoexy5,t3_emclm6,"Thank you (': 

I remember when I graduated. It was almost silent. There were a few scattered claps in the crowd, but I remember my heart sank. I shook hands with the man, faked a smile, and went back to my seat. I'll never forget how quiet it was. It really hurt.

The only time I every felt as bad as that day was my 18th birthday. Only my mom wished me a happy birthday, everyone else (even my friends, even my acquaintances) forgot. 

What you're doing really means a lot."
BigAssDieselTrucks,fdoac46,t3_emclm6,That’s sick! Think about how awkward it is for the person walking the stage. They probably don’t have much family there or friends that do it. Probably confusing haha! You’re a great person tho.
drinkallthecoffee,fdobf5k,t3_emclm6,"That’s awesome! We need people like you. 

I graduated with my PhD when I was sick, broke and homeless. No one in my entire family came to my graduation or even congratulated me. Some friends did come, though, which I was very grateful for."
teapotsneedcosies,fdq33eq,t1_fdobf5k,"My PhD graduation was not long after my marriage broke up. The ceremony was a plane ride away and I didn't feel like I could ask anyone to come with me. I would have paid for flights and accommodation, but it felt like it would have been too much of an imposition on someone to ask them to come with me 

So I didn't go.

To my longstanding regret."
drinkallthecoffee,fdr155b,t1_fdq33eq,"I’m sorry you didn’t get to go, and I’m sorry no one offered to go with you. You’re a strong person, but no one can do everything themselves. 


What I learned from many of my friends after this is that it’s not fair that it’s your job to be solely responsible for celebrating your success. Apparently, the normal, healthy thing to do is that everyone in my family would have said, “Hey, lets go to drinkallthecoffee’s graduation!”

As it was, my friend’s mom heard I was graduating and asked my friend if she could come because she was so happy for me and has known me my whole life. That’s the normal response, and she brought my friend’s dad, too.

In contrast, I got criticized later by my family for not individually inviting everyone to my graduation. I made sure that enough people knew, and they just didn’t bother telling each other or showing up. 

All you can do is try to be that supportive person to people in your life. You can’t change it that people around aren’t supporting you in the way you need. 

For instance, when I found out a friend was flying from Boston to Chicago by herself to move there for grad school, I offered to help. It would have been too much of an imposition for her to ask. I was floored that no one in her family even considered going with, so I said I’d fly out there to have some fun and help her get settled. 

I changed my summer plans to fly out there from Dublin, Ireland, for the week before heading back home to Chicago. I met her at the airport, and spent the week helping her get settled and having fun learning a new city. Originally we were supposed to go straight to her new apartment and get settled in, but it didn’t work it that way. 

She told me later she wouldn’t have been able to get through that week without me and that she would have gone back home. Her first apartment fell through and we had to spend a week in a hostel waiting for the second to be available. 

She had a $15,000 violin and nowhere to keep it and too many bags to carry by herself. As it was, it was hard for the two of us to schlepp everything by ourselves around Boston to the hostel and then later to her new apartment. We must have walked miles around the city looking like lunatics. 

Now that I’m not well enough to travel, my friend repays me by visiting whenever she can. When she flies in from SF to see family, she always drives out to see me at least once. In contrast, none of my friends or family that live here have been able to find the time to come visit me. She comes from California to see me, but my friends and family in Chicago say it’s too far of a drive to see me in the suburbs."

We've never spoken about it and i dont know if she even noticed it in the moment, but im super proud of her.

I left undergrad and worked for 3 years and got into a professional program after that. I threw myself into it (also, I found my “thing”).

That was almost 11 years ago and I still think about it pretty regularly.  I graduated in a class a little over 900 so it was about four hours and this guy cheered off and on the entire time. 

Thank you for doing this."
Belial555,fdooja0,t3_emclm6,School had 8th grade class in the auditorium to give awards to people who excelled on any of the semester tests. My name got called and actual crickets were heard until one teacher who wasnt even my own cheered very loudly  for me felt nice. Not even my own friends said or did anything.
mississippichai,fdop8d7,t3_emclm6,Way to be excellent to each other.
Lady_Lovecraft,fdoqrtm,t3_emclm6,"I was in a capella choir in HS and we sang at graduation. This was sophomore year when I didn't know any graduating seniors, so me and my friends did this same thing. Unfortunately, we later found out that the guy who had the most silence from the audience (who we clapped loudest for) was a crazy neo-nazi that carved swastikas into all his notebooks...

...whoops"
1000nipples,fdor9m6,t3_emclm6,Pls come to my graduation (if I ever make it). I have no one.
Le-QB,fdorhsz,t3_emclm6,"I remember getting a quiet reaction when my name was called in my high school graduation, I dreaded my college graduation. But a group of people did what you do to me. I just wanted to let you know that I'm really grateful that people like you exist!"
punishem1990,fdosnr6,t3_emclm6,When I graduated I had no family or friends present when I walked. One mutual friend stood up and yelled as loud as he could. The following year noone cheered for my brother so I stood up and yelled as I could. If I wasn't poor I would give you gold. You are awesome cheering for people who have noone
quitscargo7,fdotxl2,t3_emclm6,"This is really sweet of you. I didn't have many friends in high school so I didn't get a huge applause, mostly from my family and a few friends that were graduating too. It's not a big deal looking back but it was weird hearing screams and applauds for my peers but not me. Good on you for doing this and I'm sure it made the graduates feel good!"
Bri_Ta_Toe,fdoxzfw,t3_emclm6,I wanna do this now XD this is so wholesome. You're a great human.
_maybe_b_,fdozvoo,t3_emclm6,"Every graduation I’ve been to, people have been asked not to clap so when people’s names are called, the clapping doesn’t drown them out.  I always though that was weird. So, it’s cool that you got to do that! But it makes me curious about where you’re from? I’ve only attended graduations in Southern high schools and universities (SC, GA, FL, and VA) so maybe it’s unique to the US South."
MothrFKNGarBear,fdp0y8g,t3_emclm6,Dude that’s one of the nicest things I’ve ever read.

AV8ORboi,fdp4ulu,t3_emclm6,i'm finna do this at my high school graduation this year. but there's like 900 people graduating so some friends said they would help me so i don't burn out my voice or bruise my hands

summersothis,fdp8edx,t3_emclm6,You're a good person 😌
Hobbs_3,fdpdaro,t3_emclm6,"I will say you DO make them happier. I got minimal claps when I graduated HS, and some girl even booed me (or so I was told). I had a lot of girls that hated me because they wanted to date my boyfriend (who is now my fiancé). That sounds so bad to say but it’s true, sadly girls are that petty. It hurt my feelings so bad to hear someone booed me. I still think about it sometimes. If you were there screaming for me I would remember that instead!! Good job man!! Keep it up."
infinitez_,fdpg7ee,t3_emclm6,"I had an acquaintance who shared the same first and last name as me, but she was part of one of the ""popular"" groups. She walked the stage before I did, and her friends all hollered. I wasn't expecting much when it was my turn, but my small group of friends (\~15) out-cheered the other group. Honestly made my night. I'm gonna try this at the next grad for my school, hopefully some lesser-known students will still have a memorable moment."
tootoestoo,fdpgfvh,t3_emclm6,"That means so much. Honestly, the impact from the claps is a lot. My graduation I was worried that I'd be booed, (not many people liked me for some reason.) but I was cheered really loud. It felt great and thinking about it still makes me feel great."
jfk6767,fdpio89,t3_emclm6,Nothing self serving about this post😏
EnviroHope23,fdpjnsq,t3_emclm6,"This is sweet. Thank you.

My parents didn't stick around for my highschool grad (apparently they attended and then left before I could see them, I wasn't living with them at the time). I graduated university a few years late after being hospitalized and dealing with medical issues, I didn't even have the confidence to attend the award ceremony. 

A loud clapper and some one to chat with after would of been very nice. I hope you get more people involved or a trend for when you're not there anymore."
Dyert,fdpo99i,t3_emclm6,“Please hold your applause until the end” They say this at every graduation ceremony so that it does not turn into a popularity contest (and to shave a couple hours off the sonofabitch)

CrystalNC,fdq1t2i,t3_emclm6,"Thank you, when I graduated I didn't have many claps. But it made my heart warm when I heard a few loud cheers from somewhere. Never will know who it was but I know they are special to me for doing that."
omgamer15,fdq4d55,t3_emclm6,You’re a good person.
CaptainRumata,fdq9htv,t3_emclm6,"How comes some people get less applauds? So far every time at graduations I attended everyone applauded for everyone, though I'm not from the US so our culture might be different."
chngo13,fdqecgw,t3_emclm6,"As someone whose own parents didn’t go to her 3 graduations, thank you. It meant a lot to me that people were cheering me on."

_chmod,fdogn7n,t3_emclm6,"I believe it's not about you. Generally, people don't clap someone they don't know about graduation, etc. So those folks who had lots of claps probably were known by the crowd.

Sometimes I feel like someone tortures me in the ceremonies..."

LilyCatastrophe,fdq4wn2,t3_emclm6,"I think you are wonderful! This is such a nice thing to do, fun, and kind. Mad respect for sitting through boring ceremonies to basically give graduates the best compliment of the evening! Yes, to most people on that stage, they want to know that there is someone out there that cares about all the hard work they put into their education, and (hopefully) achieving their goals! I wasn’t popular by a long-shot, but I still got applause and some hoots from friends, and I know I had a damn cheesy grin because of it! 

I love to compliment people out in the wild, because I can see that they worked to do their makeup well, or their outfit is amazing, or they have fabulous shoes / earrings & jewelry / eye glasses / purse / briefcase / the other day I told a couple that I loved the sound their biker boots made when they walked! Then we had a conversation about how comfortable their boots were! I’ve had so many interesting conversations because I observe the world around me, and delight in beauty and creativity (and little kids are amazing to talk to ((when parents are around)) because they say the silliest things, and they will tell you the cold hard truth)!

To everyone hating on the OP saying that he does this for self serving purposes, well I say to you that doing good feels good! Yes, OP could do lots of other things with his time, and perhaps he does, but he posted this here in casual conversations to say he does this one thing at his university. People, it’s not everyday! Omg, calm down and go do something nice for a stranger! OP, keep being you! Cheers!"

thegreatone79,fe0bbel,t1_fe0b3bv,Thanks you!  Im continually amazed what this guy keeps showing the world he can do.  If we all had half his work ethic and drive humanity would be colonizing other planets by now.
Mjlovesbananas,fe0udri,t1_fe0b3bv,"Some more love from NZ over here! 

Ka pai (well done) dad and may you have plenty more of these wonderful days 💕"
kmnil,fe2orll,t1_fe0b3bv,Heck yeah!
bignoseduglyguy,fe0bwes,t1_fe0bbel,"Sometime in the past, I heard a mother of a child with challenging disabilities being interviewed. Respectfully, she was asked, were she able to click her fingers and make her child 'neuro-typical', if she would do so.

""For her, without hesitation. But not for me, because being her mother has taught me so much."" To me, she was not denying how amazing her child was, simply acknowledging how hard life can be for those who don't meet society's norms."
thegreatone79,fe3d86w,t1_fe0udri,NZ has the friendliest folks!  (And im a guy btw)
thegreatone79,fe0cmgg,t1_fe0bwes,"Yeah.  Every once in a while there is a family on the news that talks about how they ""wouldn't change a thing"" etc about their kid.  That's all fine when the kid is 6 but functions like a preschooler.  When the kid is 6'1 215lbs it's a little different.  This guy tries so freaking hard every minute of every day, and yet its really obvious the world just isn't built for him.  Seeing him with an actual friend and being calm/relaxed all day long was insane."
mautadine,fe0ygo4,t1_fe0bwes,"I always wondered what I would say if asked that question. Thanks for putting words on my feelings! Of course I'd do it with no hesitation, then I would mourn the child I lost."
Mjlovesbananas,fe40vhz,t1_fe3d86w,"My bad, all fixed up now :)"
dugongofdoom,fe0fr8b,t1_fe0cmgg,"Another kiwi here! I have a daughter with physical disabilities, I like to tell myself that as her parent, we just take the scenic route - it’s not the typical route but we’ll get there in the end. Loads of arohanui (love) to you and your son - here’s to many more awesome days for you both"
ellaC97,fe19jlx,t1_fe0cmgg,I hope we can build a world for him! They are just as important as everyone else. I send you all the love. I'm so proud of your kid for not giving up and doing his best. I for sure could learn from him. You are an amazing parent! He's lucky to have you.
Fuckmandatorysignin,fe1mwx7,t1_fe0cmgg,"Tell him to keep being awesome!!

Big props to you as well. Keep up the great parenting!"
TasslehoffTheBrave,fe2m75v,t1_fe0cmgg,Thank you for allowing us this glance into your life. Congrats on a great day to both of you
thegreatone79,fe3d3bi,t1_fe0ygo4,"Yes.  I also have a biological son who is ""typical"" and about the same age.  He's off living his own life with his own family.  While I desperately wish that for this kid, at the same time I would miss what we have now."
thegreatone79,fe0g4rp,t1_fe0fr8b,"Thank you!  And I love that description.  He's only been living with me full time for a few months now, and it's definitely been a transition for both of us.  However, I will say that seeing the world through his eyes over the past few years has been really cool at times."
sparklestarshine,fe260vt,t1_fe0fr8b,"This cracks me up - my mother has always said my sister is just on the wagon trails while everyone else is on the interstate, but I’ve never heard anyone else use a similar analogy (sis has substantial cognitive disabilities).  It takes a little longer, but you get more time together to enjoy the ride!  💜"
thegreatone79,fe3cl4r,t1_fe19jlx,"I hope so too!  I think all it takes is a little kindness most days.   And he definitely has taught me about perseverance and treating each day like a new one.  Without him I would still be an addict and a net negative on society, so we are lucky to have each other."
thegreatone79,fe3cs9z,t1_fe1mwx7,"Thank you!  Although, wat made yesterday so great is I didn't even have to parent much :P"

IMIndyJones,fe3tvhk,t1_fe3d3bi,"Oh my. This has me choked up. Mine has a neurotypical twin. They are 18, and he has a job, and is about to go to college. She can't do either currently, and I've been sad about it. You've made me realize how much I would miss the adventure we're on now."
IMIndyJones,fe3s6ee,t1_fe260vt,"

You've put into words perfectly what I've been trying to convey for years. I love it!"
nannylive,fe06otx,t3_enizdt,That's wonderful! Here's to many more sweet successful days!
thegreatone79,fe07aw1,t1_fe06otx,Yes indeed!  He had a major med change in late November and we are finally reaping the rewards.  For the first time in a long time im feeling optimistic about our future over here.
wistablssm,fe0ih3x,t1_fe07aw1,you might be my hero! med change is no joke. my 10yo is in the middle of a med change and it's like a 3 year regression. whew. I'm so glad for your son (and you) that something is working! it gives me hope.
Ratatoski,fe2cv6q,t1_fe07aw1,Being able to be optimistic is fabulous. Big win!
thegreatone79,fe0iruy,t1_fe0ih3x,"Ha.  The whole reason we had this major med change is the previous months minor med change crashed and burned.  We gambled on having him be a bit more ""aware"" and it paid off majorly, but it easily could have been a complete disaster.  Good luck!"
thegreatone79,fe3dnj3,t1_fe2cv6q,"Yes it is.  Him moving in with me full time was a last ditch Hail Mary to try and keep him in the ""family"" while keeping everyone safe from some of his behaviors.  Everyone is thrilled it's not just working out, it's working out well!"
natalooski,fe57oqw,t1_fe0iruy,"such a difficult choice for you to have to make for your child. you are incredibly strong and it's wonderful to hear that your commitment to your son's progress is paying off. I can't wait for you to come back and share even more progress with us. 

thank you for having the hardest job in the world. you didn't choose it, but you are clearly taking it on like a champ and your son is so lucky to have you. best wishes from California!"
BIT204,fe07t58,t3_enizdt,"Ok, serious question.  How did you stay sane for 21 years?  I'm 6 years in and angry and frustrated all the time...  What's your secret?  What's your coping mechanism?"
thegreatone79,fe083qs,t1_fe07t58,"Ha, our case is a little unique. He had a tbi at 14 and biologically he is a former close friends kid.  Prior to his injury I was an uncle figure, post injury I was more of a non-custodial parent.  He's only been with me full time since September though, and it's been a TRANSITION."
TxKingFish,fe0eac9,t1_fe07t58,"I'm a SAHD to a 15yo non verbal girl. I'm a pretty patient guy but I learned early on you have to pace yourself. It really helps when you and your spouse have a game plan. You have to tag team care taking. You also have have a ""safe word"" per se  when you just gotta tap out and get away for a bit. And don't be afraid to ask for help, you'd be surprised at how many other people who have gone through the exact same thing."
Piney_Monk,fe1skrp,t1_fe07t58,"I have two special needs, nonverbal kids, one older than yours, one younger.  The best advice I can give is live in the moment, and stop trying to swim against the tide.  They're going to be who they are, and one day you'll be gone and life will go on for them.  Making peace with it is the best thing you can do for yourself.

You're going to be on this journey regardless, for your own sake and your kids, you don't want to be angry and anxious throughout it.  A mental exercise that's helpful when you get worked up is to ask yourself, is this thought or feeling adding value to my life?

I know this comes across as hand waving the problem.  It's incredibly hard.  You can caught up in worrying about everything in the world with them, and caught up in jealousy and anger with the lovely normal lives your friends are living.  Realizing that all those feelings I'm internalizing are how I am perceiving my world and reacting to it helped put me on a better path.

I saw a therapist for years at first, I fell into the trap of alcohol for 2 years too.  Now I try to work out, eat right, meditate, have hobbies, my wife and I make sure each of us can maintain a social life.  Some days I need a Xanax to wind down after some bad behavioral episodes with my kids.  But it started with that basic acceptance and understanding of my own feelings.  And I learned in order to be the best father for my kids, I had to also work hard on my own happiness, so I'm as present as possible for my kids.

Good luck, you're not alone."
wittyrandomusername,fe2yayj,t1_fe07t58,"Can I suggest something, and you can take it or leave it?  And full disclosure, I am very very biased when it comes to this.  But give it two more years and contact your local Special Olympics.  My daughter is high functioning and has no issues communicating, so I'm not going to pretend like I 100% relate, but ever since we've got involved with the Special Olympics it has changed both of our lives.  It was almost 5 years ago I made the call, not really being sure what I'm getting into, and now I coach three sports.  Obviously I'm not going to use names, but one athlete in particular that I'm thinking of is non-verbal and talking to his parents, just being around the other athletes and having a group of supportive friends has really opened up new doors for him.  It is absolutely amazing watching him, and other athletes in similar situations grow.  I highly recommend getting involved.  I only say give it two years because the minimum age to participate is eight years old.  But now that I think of it, there is a Young Athletes Program.  I don't think we have it in our area, but it wouldn't hurt to ask.  My point in all this though, is that as your child grows, you will grow with them.  It also helps as a parent to be around other parents and volunteers who are in similar circumstances."
lizardgal10,fe09lfm,t1_fe083qs,Wow. Sounds like a tough situation that you’ve done a great job with. Best wishes to you both!
benderrobot,fe10o44,t1_fe083qs,So you took on another person's child with disabilities? I can believe that this was a huge transition. You are an admirable human. All the best to you and your son!
Transthrowaway69_,fe5ounc,t1_fe083qs,"You, sir, are a frickin superhero."
thegreatone79,fe3eii8,t1_fe2yayj,"We LOVE special olympics over here.  He isn't quite as involved anymore, but for a couple years that organization straight up provided him with all of his self esteem and identity."
thegreatone79,fe09x1w,t1_fe09lfm,"Ha!  Some days I kill it, some days he gets an iPad and pizza and sits on his bed because that's the best we can do.  Thanks for the well wishes."
thegreatone79,fe3e7z2,t1_fe10o44,"I was effectively an uncle before, so it wasn't as much of a transition as you would think.  (And I guess now we still have a relationship that is similar to living with an uncle).  He's got a good crew of people behind him."
clearlynotforporn69,fe0brjs,t1_fe09x1w,Everyone needs days like that sometimes
isworeidnevercomment,fe0ccn5,t1_fe09x1w,"My friend, it is totally okay. Parents do this with their neuro-typical kids too. You’re a good dude."
benderrobot,fe5pqmd,t1_fe3e7z2,"I imagine that's the ideal situation for him. Y'all are a great people, thanks for being so awesome!"
thegreatone79,fe0bxgv,t1_fe0brjs,Amen to that!  I recently had a day to myself and all I did was lay on the couch and pretend to be a pillow all day.
Loweene,fe1tamk,t1_fe0bxgv,"I'm sure you were a great pillow, though."

1968agoodyear,fe06qbb,t3_enizdt,What a great day!
thegreatone79,fe0753o,t1_fe06qbb,Yes indeed.  I am going to remember it next time I want to murder him :P
1968agoodyear,fe08oha,t1_fe0753o,"Lol, yes, we all have those days!"
Hawk_Thor,fe1ltvl,t1_fe0753o,Good it's not just me. 🤪
thegreatone79,fe08qeq,t1_fe08oha,I take it you have kids?
1968agoodyear,fe0a7xa,t1_fe08qeq, 2 teens. I go from loving to anger to worry in the span of an afternoon
thegreatone79,fe0agqm,t1_fe0a7xa,"Yes!  ""Don't you dare get yourself killed before I kill you first!"""
DamnYouStormcloaks,fe1bdmb,t1_fe0agqm,"Lol. ""I put you into this world and by god I can take you out of it"" XD"
ActualMerCat,fe2j6wp,t1_fe1bdmb,"This is one of the only bad things about adopting your child. I can never say this to her. I do get to say, “hey, you chose this,” though because she was old enough to have to consent in court lol."
jackbootedhugger,fe08vra,t3_enizdt,Parenting is the hardest job there is.  So happy for this victory today! Yay.
thegreatone79,fe0c8fz,t1_fe08vra,Yes it is!  We needed some victories over here and im hopeful for more in the future.
mrbillingsgate,fe3rmej,t1_fe0c8fz,"I hope you celebrate with him, it sounds like a momentous event."
eggsbeenadick,fe0ajar,t3_enizdt,Congratulations... I hope I have a day like that to brag about for my 5 yr old non verbal boy.
thegreatone79,fe0arl9,t1_fe0ajar,"I hope so too!  At least with him a med change in November has meant a communication tsunami.  We even changed Thanksgiving/Christmas plans to keep the momentum going.  While his progress has slowed a bit now, we never expected to see this much of a change 7 years post injury."
decorius,fe1e614,t1_fe0ajar,Got to make that accurate.
isworeidnevercomment,fe0cfp6,t1_fe0arl9,"Also- speech therapy is an awesome thing and can still help years after an injury. If he’s entitled to it, he should definitely pursue it. Source: am Speech Therapist."
thegreatone79,fe0cv8k,t1_fe0cfp6,"Yes!  He was seeing one once a week.  We actually bumped it up to 3x a week for December since he was making such insane progress and just worked out a deal with his therapist to pay for it.  Now his progress seems to be slowing back down a bit so we will probably go back to once a week, but in the span of 6 weeks or so we went from 1-2 words maybe when asked a direct question in a low distraction environment to today using a 7 word sentence to communicate a desire.  He is also initiating conversation now."
isworeidnevercomment,fe0d7oz,t1_fe0cv8k,That is AWESOME! Tell him to keep up the great work.
thegreatone79,fe0de5e,t1_fe0d7oz,"Yes.  I am so proud of him.  I think communication will always be something he has to be very intentional about (both receptive and expressive), but I think we have had a cognitive breakthrough where he's realizing what he needs to do now."
isworeidnevercomment,fe0di58,t1_fe0de5e,The human brain is amazing. Even years after injury there can be progress. I hope it continues!
thegreatone79,fe0dosm,t1_fe0di58,"Me too.  Like I said I think we are past the huge flurry of progress, but at this point what we have is sustainable.  The same couldn't be said for even three months ago."
lasenorarivera,fe080ln,t3_enizdt,Heck yeah! Making moves!
thegreatone79,fe08d4a,t1_fe080ln,Yup!  It's rare for the moves to be so glaringly apparent.
cnacvno,fe0b1fx,t3_enizdt,My cousin is special needs and I know what it means to her mother when she has a good day.  I'm very happy for you and him!
thegreatone79,fe0d3sz,t1_fe0b1fx,"Thank you!  And yes, good days are contagious.  If he has one it almost guarantees I will have one as well regardless of what's going on in the greater universe."
Joesdad65,fe0byih,t3_enizdt,"As a dad to a 23 year old son with autism who is also nonverbal, I love this. Keep being such a good and proud brother."
thegreatone79,fe0c3au,t1_fe0byih,"Thank you!  I can't imagine parenting someone who is truly nonverbal.  While today was a success primarily because he communicated so well, we need all the words we can get over here to stay sane!"
Ergil99,fe0yb3i,t3_enizdt,"Today my severely anxious, antisocial, onetime (?) depressive, hf-autistic 18yo daughter texted me ""I feeling content with life :D"", so I forward it to her therapist, my parents & family... and now y'all too!"
thegreatone79,fe3fiyc,t1_fe0yb3i,Nice!  I have always said that his memory/cognitive issues are ten times easier to handle than some of the accompanying mental health struggled he faces.  All anyone wants is for the people they love is to be content with themselves and their life.  I am glad your daughter is in that place right now.
Frungy,fe5mhl8,t1_fe0yb3i,Congrats to you too!
Ergil99,fe5eyp8,t1_fe3fiyc,"Thanks!  I will savor this particular moment of ok-ness, and hope for more. Best wishes to you and yours, as well. - RJ"
crunkal,fe06od6,t3_enizdt,That is amazing!
thegreatone79,fe07gbo,t1_fe06od6,Yes!  He responded really well to a med change about 8 weeks ago (to the point where we doubled down on therapy and rearranged Christmas/Thanksgiving to try and maximize his progress).  This was one of the first days where objectively I could see the massive improvement.
shitusername_taken,fe0a6gv,t3_enizdt,Sending you an internet high five. Score!!
thegreatone79,fe0d1rw,t1_fe0a6gv,High five back!  Thank you!
StunGod,fe0bb1l,t3_enizdt,"That's awesome. As the father of a special needs girl with behavioral and social challenges, I know how much I crave those moments and work hard to help them come to being.

Good for both of you. I'm truly happy to read this."
thegreatone79,fe0d5sr,t1_fe0bb1l,"Good luck with your girl!  I think we are just hitting a golden era of relative stability, hormones leveling out, and meds working perfectly."
Guitar_hands,fe19ffw,t3_enizdt,"There was a kid at my middle school who had some problems and he had a party which everyone got invited to. I was the only one who came. So I called all of my friends and forced all of them to come. They brought some people and it ended up being a really fun time. The dude had a great time at his birthday party and his mom would not stop crying and thanking me. She said that her heart was broken at first because they rented the VFW and it was a nice spread for a kids party. He thought because he gave everyone invites that they would all come. I wish people didn't suck so bad. I had my dad get my paintball guns and a bunch of fireworks and that dude fucking loved shooting the paintball gun and ""sneaking away"" to shoot off fireworks. I asked his mom first but he thought he was doing something sneaky with the guys. I'll never forget how happy that dude was even though he didn't talk very much at all. He was smiling and just so pumped all day and night. Good times. I'm glad your son had a great day as well, OP!"
thegreatone79,fe3fo4i,t1_fe19ffw,How fun!  Im glad y'all all got to enjoy yourself.
Guitar_hands,fe3jhww,t1_fe3fo4i,While we did enjoy ourselves I was honestly happy to give him such a great day. His family moved about 6 months after this but he actually requested me on Facebook a few years back and his mom messaged me to thank me again and sent some pictures from that day. Apparently he still talks about it and every birthday he says that he wants to do that again. Wish I could!
michiness,fe0dn5p,t3_enizdt,"At my school, there’s a student who’s semi-nonverbal. When he came to our school a couple years ago, he couldn’t really hold a conversation. But now, any time that we exchange pleasantries, I just want to give the kid a million high-fives."
thegreatone79,fe0drji,t1_fe0dn5p,Yes!  I know at least for him communication is something that takes a ton of effort.  I am really proud of him for channeling that effort so effectively today.
michiness,fe0e4ku,t1_fe0drji,"If it means anything, this internet stranger is super proud of him as well :)"
palacesofparagraphs,fe39n5d,t1_fe0drji,"I hope you told him how proud you are, and how proud he should be of himself!"
thegreatone79,fe3evyi,t1_fe39n5d,"I did!  He lives in the moment, so it doesn't mean quite as much to him as it might to someone else, but he definitely knows it was a good day and he did well."
linnaeacreations,fe0d16u,t3_enizdt,That's seriously such a great feeling! I have worked with kids and adults with special needs for about 3 years now and it is the thing that brings me the most joy and fulfillment in my life! This year I will graduate with my degree in special education and I feel so so lucky to be in such an amazing field. You sound like an amazing person and he's lucky to have you in his life.
thegreatone79,fe0dl4c,t1_fe0d16u,We are lucky to have each other.  And yeah!  Good special education teachers are SO necessary.  My roommate now is actually one of his former teachers in fact!
IntergalacticAssClap,fe0dkpi,t3_enizdt,I'm sure he's really happy about it too! I'm 22 and autistic and really good days like that make me feel really proud of myself and excited about everyone having a good time. :)
thegreatone79,fe0dmxs,t1_fe0dkpi,"Yes!  As someone else put it, good days are contagious.  When one person has one, everyone else does as well."

He is a traumatic brain injury survivor, but we actually have his seatbelt and backpack labeled with autism verbage because his abilities are so similar and there's more awareness around autism.

One day they went to a school event with my younger sister, 11. On the playground all the 11 year old kids doted and played with him, vying for his attention.

It was a good moment."

CoiledSpringTension,fe1r0av,t3_enizdt,"My daughter just turned 18, she’s almost completely non verbal, I can totally understand your wanting to brag, I’d be doing exactly the same thing! Hopefully this is the first of many days for you and your son."
thegreatone79,fe3g5fm,t1_fe1r0av,"I hope so too!  We recently had a breakthrough where it's like he realized that verbal communication is a thing to give priority to.  Almost overnight it's like a switch turned on and while he's still working on it, the change has been insane.  We are 7 years post injury over here and didn't expect major improvement to happen anymore, so it's doubly exciting."

thegreatone79,fe3gw47,t1_fe2z1lx,"Thank you.  It's hard to find the line between supporting him and pushing him (on his own he would sit on the couch all day doing nothing).  Some days I push too hard, and others I don't push nearly enough.  This day was one where apparently we found the balance all day long."

thegreatone79,fe41dpa,t1_fe415l2,"Yes!  He met this girl at a community program.  She's a little higher functioning than him but a bit ""dramatic"".  Somehow they work well together and it's a dream I didn't even know I had."
ekko0369,fe4puvf,t1_fe41dpa,"Wow. Just wow. Im so Happy for all of you. How beautiful!!  My a n has been practicing for two years, his social skills have been doing great. But his age group writes him off as weird.  Hardest part is watching him try so hard with no wins.  But he stays positive and never says a negative thing about them. He just says one day I'll find my people.  It's so hopeful to hear your story. Thank you"
thegreatone79,fe4rhcp,t1_fe4puvf,"I hope he does.  I do think teenagers and preteens are way harsher than adults.  To my knowledge he didn't have a single friend for most of his teen years post-injury (and im not sure he was capable of having one).  However, he has been much more successful socially as his peers have matured around him.  With mine he actually has decent social skills, but almost no working memory so it's hard for him to make lasting connections or find someone patient enough to enjoy his company as an equal.  Between the dog and this girl he might have found his people now."
Schlepuetz,fe44qlf,t3_enizdt,"Thanks. I needed that.
Much love."

ruscheinskyc,fe5pmby,t3_enizdt,That's awesome!
LaurenLdfkjsndf,fe61tiv,t3_enizdt,This is fantastic!!!  Definitely something to be celebrated
chassischuck,fe6l0u6,t3_enizdt,"My highschool sweethearts older brother was special needs he was very non verbal but I think that was because his family knew whatever it was that he wanted (used to have to prompt him use your words hon) but he was in a program that gave him the chance to be on his own (last time I spoke to them at least) he had a job and girlfriend and all that 


So It gets better ! just gotta have faith 


Tip: reward the actions youd want to see more of and you will be super surprised how much more verbal he will get  

The rewards dont have to be big and you dont have to say it's for that reason but say he likes hugs when he talks to you alot that day or has no or low amount of behavioral issues rent a movie or do something he enjoys with out telling him that's what your gonna go do just do it and bet that day you will want to record because he will probably be talking up a storm"
Claspedtangent03,fe0qwg0,t3_enizdt,Thats awesome! Im really happy for you man and i hope it all keeps working out from here!
IMIndyJones,fe0tiv2,t3_enizdt,"My mostly nonverbal autistic 18 year old daughter only speaks, in a social way, to my best friend. Everyone else, including me, gets vague, off topic, one word responses. But I'm so goddamned happy when she talks to him.  I don't know what meds, or why, but I'm starting to feel like I'm doing her a disservice by not looking into them for her. She definitely has a lot to say, judging by when she can type and use AAC."
thegreatone79,fe3hw57,t1_fe0tiv2,"Yeah, it's hard to know what to do.  For this guy I was similar to your friend.  For whatever reason ever since his injury ive been the one who can get him out of his own world the best.  Due to some other elements of my life he only recently moved in full time, and even that was a last ditch effort because his behavior had escalated to where he needed to be somewhere else.  The med change came after he had been here a couple months and I had to tell his guardians/family I couldn't keep him unless there was a significant change.  It was the definition of a Hail Mary move and against all odds it has worked beyond our wildest dreams."
IMIndyJones,fe3usof,t1_fe3hw57,"This is so fantastic to hear! I'm so happy for him, and I'm so glad he's lucky enough to have you there to believe in him."
paradox8493,fe14g57,t3_enizdt,"That’s pretty awesome. As someone officially on the Autism Spectrum (diagnoses with Asperger’s Syndrome), but somehow one of the people who CAN communicate, just poorly... I gotta say it takes A LOOOOT of effort to do basically anything social-related, and I have a much more minor case of social-disorder, clearly. So that’s really impressive. And just knowing that it’s probably 10x harder for me than someone without a disorder, and 10x harder than that for someone like him, I kinda feel proud of him even though I’m a stranger."
thegreatone79,fe3ifsu,t1_fe14g57,"Yes!  He went to bed early at night exhausted but happy.  As an extrovert who talks to anyone and everyone, I have to remind myself how much effort his days take.  I am really proud of him.  Also, for what it's worth I acknowledge your struggles and am proud of you too!"
tokillamockingbirbs,fe15xbg,t3_enizdt,"My brother is 24 and non-verbal. These wins leave you on cloud9 for days!!! Congrats OP, send Reddit’s love to your brother!"

I hope he'll have more good days soon."
thegreatone79,fe3njzu,t1_fe1lclt,"Me too!  Today (the next day) hasn't been quite as great from an engagement perspective, but he has been relatively calm all morning.  Here's hoping this is our new normal."
CHA0T1CNeutra1,fe1mtdo,t3_enizdt,That's awesome. I work with individuals with disabilities (direct support professional) and it is always nice when they have a really great day. Also thanks for stepping in for a kid that isn't even yours. To many of my individuals were abandoned or abused by their family. It means a lot for them to have someone even if it isn't always easy.
thegreatone79,fe40clo,t1_fe1mtdo,Yes.  This guy is lucky in that there's a whole team of folks who have his back.  I think it would be impossible as an individual.
Betsir,fe1pg7n,t3_enizdt,"That’s amazing! Congrats to both of you-I know it took a lot of work and patience. Great job, parental unit (not sure if you’re mom or dad so I’m playin it safe)!!!!"

SteCarey,fe2d51n,t3_enizdt,Brilliant xx I hope you guys have many more of these days and better
justnotcoo1,fe2kk2p,t3_enizdt,I have a son who is 15 and is becoming more verbal all the time. One of the best days of my life was when he was 5 and I asked him a question and he answered me. I had been asking him questions about everything with no answer for years. I held a general conversation with him always holding up both ends in the hopes he would catch on and answer someday. On October 24th 2008 he answered in 2 labored words. I was full of joy. I know what your joy feels like OP and feel that joy with you. Thank you for sharing this!
thegreatone79,fe3nbcj,t1_fe2kk2p,Nice!  It's amazing how just some 2 way communication can fix so many behavioral moments.  Here's to many conversations in both of our futures!
justnotcoo1,fe3sj5s,t1_fe3nbcj,"I know. I wish my son would just tell me he doesnt want something or like something and not just start with the moaning. If we dont catch on or is unavoidable, moaning becomes screeching, screeching becomes hitting and/or meltdown. Avoiding even one of those meltdowns is gold. I have a question though, do you think having his friend there helped? We rarely have friends over and tend to go to do group activities with other simular kiddos."
thegreatone79,fe3vmhp,t1_fe3sj5s,"This particular friend is a game changer for us.  She is a little higher functioning than he is, but bossy.  I think he likes having someone else making all the decisions but interesting enough to be engaged.  

And I totally relate with the moaning -> meltdown.  We had a perfect example of avoiding that yesterday.  I was making lunch and told them to go sit at the table.  He wanted to sit next to his friend instead of his normal chair and for whatever reason felt like he couldn't.  He was able to communicate that and obviously I don't care where he sits so I was happy to say sure.  In the past he would have communicated that by refusing to sit etc, and instead he used words and then we both got what we wanted.

We do a fair amount of group activities, but it's more for my sanity than his.  I need to get out of the house with him!  He has fun when a bunch of us decend on a trampoline park or a pool etc, but generally he is going to be too busy having fun to communicate much in that environment.  In my opinion both smaller calmer events and larger more chaotic events are equally beneficial."

thegreatone79,fe3n65r,t1_fe2tsra,"It's so cool seeing how their brains work.  For my guy animals are his thing.  I never would have gotten him a dog due to some behavior concerns, but a stray literally wandered in our house one day right about the time of his breakthrough.  As a result, he's been happy/engaged talking to that dog and I think made more progress as a result.  Apparently people are not nearly as interesting as disgusting little dogs hahaha"

JackBinimbul,fe36kw8,t3_enizdt,"Congrats on a great day!

My wife is a special education high school teacher and has a severe, non-verbal brother who is approaching 18.  It's nerve wracking thinking of what his life is going to look like as an adult, but those ""good"" days are amazing and are a reminder of the possibilities."
thegreatone79,fe3mq98,t1_fe36kw8,"Yes.  I am sure you wife knows, but it's ten times harder to find resources once you leave the education system.  Start looking asap so you can figure out what wait lists etc you need to get on!"
soundphile,fe39nvw,t3_enizdt,"Yay, that’s amazing!!

I have a 24 year old brother who’s low functioning autistic and somewhat non-verbal. He’s also 6’2 220 lbs. Big guy, heart of gold, and hilarious when he wants to be. The bad days are tough but the good days are always worth celebrating!"
thegreatone79,fe3ll80,t1_fe39nvw,Yes!  My guy is 6'2 215lbs so probably a similar situation.  His size+behavior makes it to where a lot of doors that are open to other folks are not open to him.  Here's hoping for many more good days for both him and your brother.
LesbotronEZAS,fe3gfnv,t3_enizdt,This makes me happy
AlyKhat,fe3h2rl,t3_enizdt,I have a close-to-nonverbal 3yo and this gives me hope. Thanks you for posting
imagrownasskid,fe3kgbn,t3_enizdt,My brother is mentally limited and at the age of 42 he found a friend and it has changed everything for the better. Everyone needs a friend.

sp0rdiac,fe3n7wg,t3_enizdt,"I can understand the amazing feeling!! Congrats :) 

I work in special Ed (moderate/severe) with kids who are in kindergarten/1st grade and man oh man is it an amazing feeling when they accomplish things. 

I mainly work one on one with a kid, and we practice habits every day and when he does it by himself it’s so amazing & my heart gets so warm. It’s amazing and I’m happy for you OP."
thegreatone79,fe3s6b9,t1_fe3n7wg,"Thank you for what you do!  I think a variety of factors has fed into his unexpected communication breakthrough the past month (med change, a dog, roommate used to be his spec ed teacher).  Y'all are so necessary to these kids (and their caretakers)."
sp0rdiac,fe3u9wt,t1_fe3s6b9,"The interesting/great thing is finally figuring out what works for them. I saw another post that talked about how his son was nonverbal for a long time, then a Thomas the train episode came on and suddenly he was saying things like “choo choo,” and that was a segway to him becoming more verbal. (Google: thomas the train autism if you’re curious, it’s pretty common!) 

I appreciate the kind words. Im still somewhat new to my job - it definitely can be challenging at times. Especially bc we do a lot of repetitive things with the kids each day and it may take months and months before they show improvement in a certain action/word/behavior. It definitely requires a lot of patience and empathy. I feel for the parents as well - it’s not easy. 

I’m very happy you found what helps."
thegreatone79,fe3ygsa,t1_fe3u9wt,"Yes.  My guy is pretty good at following charts for tasks, but really struggles with doing multistep things without a chart.  It can get incredibly monotonous working on the exact same thing day in day out"

AmIABitchTho,fe3nz3u,t3_enizdt,the void is proud!! way to go buddy. what reinforcers did you use? I work in ABA and i love these kind of victories.
thegreatone79,fe3rpy6,t1_fe3nz3u,"We do ABA with him and did a lot more in the past.  Generally we use ABA more for concrete tasks we are working on (ie self care or washing dishes etc).  Self regulation is his biggest weakness and we stumbled upon the best thing for that accidentally right around the time he had the med change that led to this breakthrough.  A stray dog walked in our front door one day as I was cooking some food.  Before I knew it he was petting the dog and feeding it and next thing you know the damn thing had a name and a bed etc.  When he's being calm or trying to be calm he can be with the dog (who I truly think is actually an angel).  When he's being violent etc, the dog has to stay with me until he's calm enough to make safe choices around it."
LizzieMcWeiner,fe3w3b4,t3_enizdt,Put a lump in my throat! It must have felt really good for him and his friend too!
thegreatone79,fe3ywlt,t1_fe3w3b4,Yes!  I think it might be the beginning of a lifelong friendship for both of them.
msallin,fe3woly,t3_enizdt,"I was curious and read your post history. Congratulations, man. I’m proud of you. Very impressive 👍🏼"
thegreatone79,fe3ys3y,t1_fe3woly,Thank you!  2019 was a year of changes for everyone.  Im hoping 2020 will be a lot calmer
Turtle_Sensei,fe3ys8p,t3_enizdt,"That's awesome! Glad he had a good day, and that you did as well!"
Readalie,fe3zogr,t3_enizdt,THE VOID REJOICES.
hemprope00,fe4bx04,t3_enizdt,"That's fantastic! Was this on his own, or was it after a therapy that you tried? Just wondering."
thegreatone79,fe4csji,t1_fe4bx04,"I think a series of events led up to this.  He moved in with me full time in September after really backsliding a lot trying to live independently with supports over the summer.  As a result we have really doubled down on some of his mental health struggles.  He had a major med change in mid November, we accidentally aquired a dog who I think is actually his guardian angel, and we moved into a house with a good friend of mine who used to be his special education teacher.  All that combined means he's feeling a lot more engaged and confident with his place in the world right now.  We doubled down on speech therapy after the med change because we started seeing crazy improvement all the sudden.  Yesterday was just one of the first times I've gotten to step back and go ""wow, this is actually possible and happening""."
hemprope00,fe4ddj4,t1_fe4csji,"That is fantastic! If you don't mind, may I ask what exactly your son has? Like, what condition he's been diagnosed with? I'm guessing autism, but I'd like clarity."
thegreatone79,fe4dokr,t1_fe4ddj4,Traumatic brain injury 7 years ago.  Which makes this more insane that we are seeing so much improvement years later.  We actually have autism labels on his backpack/seatbelt though because he presents very similarly and there's more awareness of it.
hemprope00,fe4m2sv,t1_fe4dokr,"That's very sad. I hope I'm not getting too personal, but was he, ""Normal,"" before the TBI?"
thegreatone79,fe4m9ky,t1_fe4m2sv,As normal as any 14 year old could be :P
hemprope00,fe4my4o,t1_fe4m9ky,Must've been hard to watch him go from normal to being disabled like that ): I'm glad things are looking up for yiu?!

thegreatone79,fe4nbci,t1_fe4n10z,"Thank you!  So far today the behavior trend is mostly continuing, although the interaction level is a bit lower.  That being said, as an old guy I can't compete with his pretty friend who came over yesterday :P"

lemmikki1980,fe6i8ff,t3_enizdt,That is amazing and I am crying happy tears for you! I understand the overwhelming joy you feel over this accomplishment. My daughter once smiled and said hi to a lady behind us at the gas station when she said hello to her. I was so blown over and happy that I bought her coffee and legit wanted to cry and hug the poor woman. She was so confused when I replied to her “you don’t have to do that” with “she said hi to you. Yes I do”. I was on cloud nine and telling EVERYONE for a week.
thegreatone79,fe6in0x,t1_fe6i8ff,"Ha I have a similar story.  He didn't speak a word for a couple years after his injury.  We were at the zoo (one of his favorite places) and waiting for French fries and the lady in front of us asked her daughter ""do you want to see the elephants or the gorillas first?"". He looked up at her and said ""gorillas please"".  I pretty much freaked out and bought their meal I was so excited."
picknmynosenotmyname,emyevh,top_level,"I went out and met some girl on tinder and we got along, we're having a good time dancing together, then ""don't stop believing"" by journey comes on. The solo kicks in, so being a slightly drunken idiot, I start air-guitaring. A guy sees me, starts air-guitaring back, works his way over to me, so we're air guitaring face to face. She takes off. Lol oh well.   

Edit: thanks for awards, and it seems like there's a lot of awesome people out there!"
chobani_omani,fds7thh,t3_emyevh,Don't settle down until you meet the one who will air guitar with you
picknmynosenotmyname,fds7zgu,t1_fds7thh,Good advice. You met your air guitar partner as well? (I hope so)

dmurr2019,fdtx43u,t1_fds7thh,True. Having an air guitar partner is absolutely lovely. I hope you find them soon!
PurpleRobotPanda,fdtw5u3,t1_fds7thh," This.  This was the comment I was looking for.  And OP, that date sounds lame.   I’m sure the next one will be better."

chobani_omani,fds89x7,t1_fds7zgu,Not quite yet. Still jamming out alone over here
zucine,fdu0573,t1_fds7zgu,My gf and I were eating subway and a sick guitar solo came on. We picked up our subs and started soloing.
charm59801,fdu8gei,t1_fds7zgu,I have and it's amazing.  Hold out for sure.
Obandigo,fdv9bh3,t1_fds7zgu,You'll find your air guitar partner. Don't Stop Believing
bipolar-wanderlust,fdvo1uf,t1_fds7zgu,I think you found your air guitar partner for life and you should see if it could work out with him.
AhhDaddy,fdwc8w7,t1_fds7zgu,"Good she did, you deserve better than her"
Omphroy,fdwmimv,t1_fds7zgu,"Have you seen the 2009 movie ""I Love You, Man""?"
Ironheart616,fdwsb6u,t1_fds7zgu,One day i was walkin home and jamin out this guy in a huge semi waved and air guitared my way the car behund him saw and started doing it and then the guy behind him. I had 3 cars air guitaring and was one of the moments I smiled and had genuine faith in humanity! Rock on strangers!
daedgoco,fe049yg,t1_fds7zgu,They're hard to come by but I hope one day it'll happen
poopcasso,fdunr8c,t1_fds7zgu,"For real though, it's pretty cringey to air guitar with another dude when you're on a first date completely leaving your date out of the fun. Imagine she hit off with another girl just twerk battling while completely ignoring you on your first date. That's would be fucking weird if you're introverted person or don't want a lot of attention to yourself. One could view it as she completely disregarded you and your boundaries for first dates."
picknmynosenotmyname,fds8pe6,t1_fds89x7,It's hard to tell when you need patience and when to settle for 'less'. Good luck though! I hope it's true when they say there's someone for everyone.
Crash3_14,fdt5vpv,t1_fds89x7,"If you need someone to jam with, I can kinda play the air bass"
wkeating24,fduo8gy,t1_fds89x7,"Ummm 🤔

InfiniteWasTaken,fdu7dcg,t1_fds89x7,Never alone on thos sub fren. We'll air-guitar with you.

chobani_omani,fdsak7i,t1_fds8pe6,"Aw thanks, I haven’t given up yet :’)"
bkbrigadier,fdtesc2,t1_fds8pe6,"There is! I was single for 8 years and hadn’t even slept with anyone for the last 2 years of that. I kinda gave up and was digging my own company anyway. 

I think that’s part of the secret. I don’t have friends I’m co-dependent on either (we’re all pretty individual/independent), so being “on my own” for so long was a really good time to get to know myself and what I’m about. 

Then BAM when I least expected it, a guy I knew from my best friends’ tattoo shop (where I spent most of my spare time) asked me out on a date. I said yes for shits and giggles (I’m pretty sure both of us thought it would just be a fun night out) and we’re going on 2 years together this April 😊"
rkoloeg,fdv08tp,t1_fds8pe6,"I know a couple of ladies who would have been totally down to air guitar right back at you - don't worry, they're out there!"
Kenutella,fdu88j8,t1_fds8pe6,It's both. You should in theory be willing to not do air guitars for the sake of the relationship but she shouldn't be putting you in that position over something so trivial.
MuleTheDonkey,fdu9p9r,t1_fds8pe6,"I say soulmates are made, not born. You need chemistry, but just a first date can become someones everything.

LMskouta,fdw72sr,t1_fds8pe6,"I ask myself that all the time. Then I keep telling myself good things don’t come easy. It takes time to get an education, career, build wealth, solid healthy regiment or whatever it is we aspire to do in life. Dating is the same. You can swipe your way to a date but you you can’t swipe your date to a relationship. Like the top post righteously said “don’t settle until you find the one to air guitar with you”!! Damn he or she said it well."
onacloverifalive,fdw8l68,t1_fds8pe6,"Don’t ever settle, find contentment in your own life and you will stop seeing the world in fabricated hierarchy."
dapopeah,fdwgdbx,t1_fds8pe6,"Real talk, for a min. Never 'settle for less' because it means, at the very foundation of your relationship, you think there's something better. 
I think the key to finding someone who's right for you is first knowing who you are, and being who you are, not putting up a facade we think is acceptable. (Unless someone is an asshole, figure out how not-to-be-that) It's ok to be into someone who doesn't fit the standard that we've been told we should. The advice I've given my son is, make yourself someone you're happy with and that awesome person that will complement you will be there."
brynhildra,fdwxfab,t1_fds8pe6,"Nah, don't settle for less. Adjust expectations for what truly matters to you and work on any flaws you may have (air guitar is rad and not a flaw), sure, but if you think of someone as settling for less, that's not worth pursuing."

Goddammit it's refreshing to hear someone being themselves, having a good time and being real..you left her right where you were meant to- believe that- and now that other dude can spend his time with the party-pooper, while you are still available for awesome adventures and I've no doubt the great one you're waiting for will be drawn to your funloving, carefree, and warm personality..it tends to happen, as they say, when we least expect it..when you're not looking or when you've stopped looking..I've found the latter to be true personally..

Good thing you chose to let loose and not let anything hold you back from your air-guitar solo....if this encounter teaches you anything, let it be that you should always be yourself, staying true to who you are, no matter what..the one who is meant for you can't and won't see you if you're not YOU."

StainerHamie,fdsgxnp,t3_emyevh,Some of my best times were rocking out with just me and my ex or in public. Her move list was like a jiggle or shake but she never minded when I danced. Hopefully you find someone who will air guitar with you or at the very least watch and cheer you on.
picknmynosenotmyname,fdsi3yi,t1_fdsgxnp,Thanks. Definitely prefer the air guitar partnerv though. It just less awkward 🤷🏻‍♀️

picknmynosenotmyname,fdvnzzr,t1_fdtxkj9,"I get what you mean, and having been excluded from many things as a child, I'm pretty sensitive to others feelings in this area. She was right there, could have joined in, but she was kind of being a stick in the mud all night. Relationships are all about compromise, meeting in the middle, and occasionally putting yourself out of your comfort zone to be there to see your partner enjoy themselves. I don't think this girl knew how to do any of those things, at least, not with me. In the very least, she's got a chance with someone more to her liking."

picknmynosenotmyname,fdyft8v,t1_fdyfdpf,Thanks! I do enjoy a good time

Each day I try to make life a little easier for people whether it's holding a door open for someone, or smiling and greeting them, or letting a car in front of me etc. Hey, nice to meet you, Neighbor. =)"
picknmynosenotmyname,fe5eepy,t1_fe59ppj,"It probably means something totally different, I agree. Although I'd like to guess that it's simply the reasoning. Otherwise, the actions are pretty much the same. Keep up the good work, amigo!"

BlondeMomentByMoment,fdwnie1,t3_emyevh,"Marry me. Oof; already married, sorry. 
That girl you met is a party pooper."
Readalie,fdws4im,t3_emyevh,She was just a small-town girl who chose to keep living in a lonely world.
picknmynosenotmyname,fdxv0kd,t1_fdws4im,No midnight trains for her
Readalie,fdxzqmv,t1_fdxv0kd,So instead of going anywhere she’s going nowhere?
picknmynosenotmyname,fdy573w,t1_fdxzqmv,"Not if she can see a singer in a smoky room in her small town, I guess"
Starfiregrl,fdxckgp,t3_emyevh,Well perhaps she got a different vibe from you or there was no chemistry for her. Don't beat yourself up about it.
lcotemi,fdya6aq,t3_emyevh,"Nah, you never really had her. She met you and realized you aren’t who she’s looking for. There’s nothing wrong with that."
sso_1,fdz8n83,t3_emyevh,"Hey, at least you had a fun time, her loss. You should find someone that would enjoy that with you instead of walking off."

apierson2011,fe01dtw,t3_emyevh,"I met my current BF on Tinder and am happy to report that not only do we air guitar together, we also game, art, drink, and cook together. Its the best and you deserve that too. Don't give up, you'll find your rad partner! And for what it's worth, if I was on a first date and a guy did that, id be all about it. I hope this experience didnt discourage you because I think in general people are looking for folks who arent afraid to be themselves. Keep rocking! :)"

People are fucking crazy."

madguins,fdwlkam,t1_fdva76m,"Idk cheese, ramen, more dairy. Oh and chocolate fondue. 

I def didn’t feel sexy after but you’re supposed to be comfortable around your dates hahaha"

I'd have loved that. 

Everyone always tries to be way too cool on dates."
picknmynosenotmyname,fdvqwpc,t1_fdu3lil,Don't see why to give them your best on a first date. How often are you going to be like that? Feels kinda like deception to me.
DumbestBoy,fdu4on1,t3_emyevh,I call bullshit. no red-blooded woman would walk away from that. if anything they would swarm you guys.
picknmynosenotmyname,fdvraw3,t1_fdu4on1,So I'm seeing. I guess she was one of them non-red-blooded ladies.

DDeadRoses,fdu5yzh,t3_emyevh,I just came back from a tinder date and I needed to read this. Thanks! Feel better about my date. Well just a bit.
picknmynosenotmyname,fdvsade,t1_fdu5yzh,Feel like talking about it?
DDeadRoses,fdwj2zy,t1_fdvsade,"You’re awesome OP haha. I’ve been on ALOT of tinder dates and they never follow through for more than 2-3 dates. Last night I felt there was potential in someone. But the whole date felt kind of off until she told me that she wasn’t ready for something real because she wasn’t happy with herself enough to make someone else happy. I immediately blamed myself not just for her, but for every single date I’ve ever had. I felt worthless, not enough and just plain ugly. Then reading your post made me realize that maybe most people just can’t handle me. I feel like I’m different from most people. Like playing an air guitar with a total stranger is fricken awesome and I know ALOT of people would not do that and wish they could. That’s being different. I’ve been looking at this in the wrong way my whole life. It’s always been “maybe I’m just not good enough” to “maybe they weren’t good enough for me” so thanks again for posting this and all the comments in this thread for support!"

asscrackbanditz,fducihg,t3_emyevh,Did you try mimicing the whammy bar and adjust the volume and tone knob and try to tune the guitar every 5 seconds?
the_silver_shroud_eh,fdueox4,t3_emyevh,Any girl that dosnt get caught up in the moment of that song isn't worth a second date anyway.

theguyfromerath,fdunmhh,t3_emyevh,Wait did she just not like you airguitaring or she thought you were flirting with the guy?
justingolden21,fdusalg,t3_emyevh,"Good song, fun time. Nothing wrong with either of those, if that's not her preference then she's not your preference."
Tank_Top_Saitama,fdusun9,t3_emyevh,"Truth be told, she probably didn't leave because of that, but used that window of time to fuck off. Anyways, keep rocking"

SeanyD72,fdwbbll,t3_emyevh,I love you
velvetreddit,fdwbgay,t3_emyevh,"No, OP. This is 100% her loss and you dodged a bullet. She did you a favor. If someone can’t handle a little air guitar, that’s a deal breaker. Let alone you bonded with a complete stranger - that’s rare these days. You sound like someone I’d want to hang out with."
SoniaJarvis,fdwd8lx,t3_emyevh,"Leaving all judgement out, OP is an extrovert, date was an introvert.  I am an extrovert, if I saw two guys air guitar duelling I'd be hustling the bar to discuss and pass judgement...  On who was the better air guitar better and lmao!

stroker919,fdwoi9t,t3_emyevh,That she wasn’t drumming at that point is huge red flag.
mysmileindisguise,fdwojkd,t3_emyevh,This story is awesome and I'm so glad you see it as that you were too rad for her and not like you did something stupid and drove her away. You guys just werent a match. You keep going out there with that attitude and confidence in yourself and you'll find the girl for you. And in the meantime Don't stop believin...

Dreamerof88,fdtflmu,t3_emyevh,"Why would she leave? I wouldn’t imitate, but I would enjoy watching him go crazy. A good laugh isn’t bad."
picknmynosenotmyname,fdv3s5r,t1_fdtflmu,Seemed to me she couldn't handle not having 100% of my attention on the first date. Or maybe she just hated journey and me enjoying the song pushed her over the edge. We will never know.
Reapr,fdtfww4,t3_emyevh,Everybody needs a test they can apply to filter out the ones that will just never work.  Air-guitaring is as good a test as any :)
picknmynosenotmyname,fdv4kvb,t1_fdtfww4,You're right! I should apply the air guitar test on all first dates!
duddy33,fdtgexx,t3_emyevh,"Keep air shredding until your date jumps in on air drums or air bass!

tangocharlie201,fdtidel,t3_emyevh,"This actually happened to me. A girl I like invited me out to see the Four Horsemen (Metallica tribute band) and then Harvester of Sorrow comes on. This is one of my most favorite Metallica songs. So naturally I started head banging, air guitaring, and singing along. What does she do? She moves away from me and gravitates towards a male friend in our group.

It sucked, ngl, but it made me realize that she wouldn't be the kind of person I'd be in the moment with and just have fun."

picknmynosenotmyname,fdvcoh5,t1_fdtod3o,Maybe she went to buy a ring and I was gone by the time she came back.

If your parents have a good plan then you can be covered under theirs until age 25. There are various programs that can help if you're low income or disabled, depending on which province you live in.

Overall, this was the right decision and most elements of my life are improving quite dramatically (every months lifes seems better), works improved, healths improved, mentality... finances maybe no but i think it's a good trade off.  


I don't recommend just ""running away"" by any means but I do think that space can be amazing for your personnel development.

Try not to burn bridges, be smart, safe and make the decisions that are positive... feel free to PM if you ever want to vent / just scream into the air so to speak."
cedreamge,fdmx58p,t1_fdmq17x,"I'm living with my boyfriend and his parents. Starting work soon, so hopefully I get decent money out of it. His parents are leaving to another country in a couple months so I got to be somewhat established to move into a flat with him on our own."
blah_shelby,fdn770c,t1_fdmq17x,"I’ve “run away” from my parents twice now. The first time I was 18 and lived with my bf at the time until he turned out to be abusive, so I left him and rented my best friends room from her parents since she had left for college. Had to go back to my parents after a while because I was struggling to afford anything at all. 

The other time was 2 years ago, I already had an apartment but my parents were still supporting me for the most part, I got really sick and they continuously accused me of faking it (it’s a long story that I won’t go into) so I turned off my phone and stopped answering the door. I didn’t talk to them for a year and a half, during which I survived by putting everything on credit cards for a couple months (don’t recommend at all) and then moved to a new state and started a new life. 

I now have a better relationship with my parents than ever before because they treat me like an adult individual instead of just their child."

Shadowwvv,fdnheeg,t1_fdn9jwg,I think it’s more about the message behind it.
yoitsthatoneguy,fdnz7qq,t1_fdn9jwg,Unless he actually uses the insurance and it bills the parents.
BillBillerson,fdo7gzv,t1_fdn9jwg,Unless they went from a family plan to just 2 spouses where it drops in price. We also dont know how old this person is so i reserve judgement if theyre over 25 then idk if they can maintain insurance on the kid.
moses1424,fdq55g1,t1_fdn9jwg,My wife and I are on separate plans if I dropped my kids It would go from family plan to individual and much cheaper. My kids are 5 and 2 though so I think I’ll probably just stay on the family plan.
Anilxe,fdnys70,t1_fdnymja,"Its amazing the things they'll say when you take off. My dad sent me an email, after he shut off my phone service, that I'll ""Never survive on my own so he'll be there to say he told me so when I crawl back"".

cedreamge,fdnyxz5,t1_fdnys70,"My mother continuously messaged my boyfriend's mother telling her to give me no money whatsoever. She thought that at least if I starved, I'd run back. Guess she didn't expect my boyfriend's mum to be so supportive of my choice."
BillBillerson,fdp1w0p,t1_fdoucas,"And that's just a different way to say over 25 which was my point. We don't know if they turned 26 or they're 18. Parents kicking a kid off at 18 kinda sucks (though is within their right to do so). Kinda doubt that though since they said ""finally kicked me off"". If they're 26 and can't afford insurance, that's kinda on them. 

Also per my reply to you, going from a family plan to only spouses is absolutely cheaper. Family plans are incredibly expensive. If they have other kids what you're saying can be true, but we don't know that."

aem61933,fdmgvts,t3_em45uz,"I feel for you. I lived with my friend/old roommate for 3 years and cut them a deal on the utilities, probably saved them about $3000 cause I had a good job and liked living with somebody I didn’t hate.

They also had Spotify Premium and the deal was I could stay on it for lifetime. They changed their plan from family to individual about 3 years after we stopped living together. Everytime I see them now I remind them that the money I saved them when we lived together was equivalent to 47 years of Spotify Premium."
get-triggered-bitch,fdmk0l9,t1_fdmgvts,"Yeah sucks when you help someone out and they just tell ya to fuck off. My uncle and his family lived in our rental property (3 bed, 2 bath).

WhippetingWhippet,fdmo3va,t1_fdmgvts,"Seems like the family made a collective decision to switch, you can hardly fault the roommate for that, especially for such a tenuous deal. Seriously, what were you going to do if you lost contact and they had to do a password change like five years later?

Spazzle17,fdnidku,t1_fdmgvts,"Are they broke possibly? You could argue that if they're broke, why do they keep Spotify at all, but being broke usually leads to depression, which music can help with."
Crowesco,fdmpkyg,t1_fdmk0l9,"This is true, but you can't expect someone to be indebted to you for such a minuscule thing for the rest of their life. u/aem61933 did the guy a solid very similar to what I do for my housemate, but I do it

We were broke college kids at the time and couldn't really afford Tequila (it was expensive in India and not available everywhere). I've paid for a lot of his booze since (and he has for me), but he still brings it up occasionally like ""Oye, where my Tequila at?"""
ElVatoMascarado,fdmumfw,t1_fdmo3va,"Yeah wtf? He made a “lifetime” deal and thought it was realistic. He’s honestly on here complaining as if it’s not entirely childish and naive to expect that to be honored, as if that’s even practical. And he brings it up every time he sees them? Holy shit. Some ppl lack a shit ton of self awareness."

But they always used my Netflix so I’d get signed out; they went a few months without paying til I said I’d broaden it and add it to another bill. Ended up cheaper for us all"

Zombie_Ice_cream,fdnjfnz,t1_fdn4mqq,"They now force you to add your home address in your spotify account. You send a link to invite someone to your family account and the new person has to correctly know your address.

AufDerGalerie,fdntggh,t1_fdn4mqq,"[Their website](https://www.spotify.com/us/family/) says Premium Family is $14.99 a month, and that with this service “Family members **living under one roof** can enjoy up to 6 Premium accounts.” Their website also says you can listen anywhere on any device.

Don’t know if they enforce “living under one roof.” 
One of the people who’s been on my plan for over a year lives 1,000 miles from the rest of us. We haven’t had problems.

Edit: punctuation"
unicorns-,fdo2yj4,t1_fdn4mqq,"It's in their terms and conditions. The thing is, they don't really enforce it, because they know that most customers who have the family plan would not pay for the individual plan, so banning them means losing a paying customer, not getting a customer to pay more."

FishDoNotTakeLs,fdnh03p,t1_fdn8xtk,Downloading high quality is cheaper than the data plan that goes with streaming in most cases
Oswamano,fdnjmvl,t1_fdnh03p,Premium lets you download everything offline
FishDoNotTakeLs,fdnk70h,t1_fdnjmvl,"Yeah, that's what I was saying. Much more affordable to keep it downloaded than it is to pay for more mobile data"
spid3rfly,fdnysrj,t1_fdnk70h,"Is it though? Bear with me... all of that downloaded material has to stay stored someway... whether it's just your phone storage(which is limited), in some cloud somewhere, or if you buy a hard drive that will hold the music(granted, hard drives are cheaper than they've ever been).

What if you're someone that loves rare/obscure stuff? Some stuff is impossible to find on pirate sites (RIP oink). Not to mention, you don't really have a way to discover new stuff efficiently without something like Spotify or Pandora."
FishDoNotTakeLs,fdnz87e,t1_fdnysrj,"Listen to your favorites on the go, and stream new stuff on wifi. Storage is so cheap these days. You can download 2000 songs on the highest quality on Spotify, and it only takes 10 gigs. A 128gb SD card is less than $15. I understand what you're saying, but it seems like half of your argument was there so it seemed like you had more reasons."

I know this is really cold-hearted, but if you are a grown-up, hoping that your girlfriend's family will buy you stuff is a big red flag. If I were dating you and you asked my parents if you could use their netflix or spotify, I'd be really embarrassed.  

Being an adult means getting your finances in order and learning how to be self-reliant. If you can't afford something, you do without, and don't complain about it to like, your girlfriend's parents. To your friends, sure. To your family or girlfriend, sure. But not your girlfriend's parents.  

If it comes up in conversation and you're like ""yeah, that's not in my budget."" that's cool and maybe they offer, and that's cool if you take them up on it. Noticing that they aren't using all the spots and offering to pay them a percentage for the extra spot is cool. But saying anything about it in a way that implies that you're hoping they'll take pity on you makes me cringe just thinking about it.  

It's $10/month, dude. split the cost with some friends and be done with it. Sure, I've been there. $10/month wouldn't have been in my budget either when I was in college. I got to see a $3 matinee like once a month. But I never asked my boyfriend if I could be on his whatever plan, and definitely not his parents."

DygonZ,emq85b,top_level,"So I've been sick for the past week with a heavy cold, feeling kinda miserable. Life in general has been pretty great though, and I hadn't really stopped an appreciated it. I've just found a new job, no more 2 hour commute everyday, just a 10 minute walk. After a bad breakup 2 years ago, I've been seeing a girl for the past 5 months, that's going great! 

And today in the deli I asked a sandwich, hold the tomato, and afterwards I was like, damn...should have asked for extra eggs in stead... then I opened up my sandwich and there was extra eggs on there! and I realised...damn, life has been going great lately, even though the eggs are insignificant, that made me realise everything, for some reason. 

Do you ever stop to just realise how great stuff is going, or realise it because of something totally insignificant?


**Edit**: Wow, I never imagined this would explode the way it did (this is now my most upvoted post ever on reddit!)! Happy to see all the happy people in here! Also curious to hear from people who aren't doing to well... life isn't always easy, it hasn't always been easy for me, I've been trough some rough years... It was only in 2019 that stuff all of a sudden started going uphill! For me it was really getting into a positive mindset that changed it all, and also going to a psychiatrist for a while. If you ever feel like it's to much, there ain't no shame in getting professional help!

holis_22,fdqhz0h,t3_emq85b,"This happened to me yesterday but in different circumstance.
I have a Navi motorcycle (which I use everyday), yesterday at night I leave it infront of a house and went to a party. Next morning, I found my motorcycle destroyed and it was the fault of a man who decide to use his car drunk. 
I cried a lot, I felt destroyed too. I went to the Honda agency to see how much the repairs will cost, for my surprise... IT IS LESS THAN $40  
Life can be weird and amazing at the same time."
DygonZ,fdqmduo,t1_fdqhz0h,Let's call it a happy little accident then? :)

BannanaBun123,fdqo7gv,t3_emq85b,"Yes! Today actually I was walking to the pharmacy with my baby. On my way back to my house I saw it from across the street. It’s a very homey looking home, the type of house I always wanted to live in and I actually get to live in it with my cats and my baby and my husband. A few years back I was divorcing someone else, I didn’t have many friends around, struggling in college and my mom had cancer.  Got divorced, moved, mom recovered, finished school, I reconnected with friends and I met my current husband and had a cute baby with him. Life got pretty great when I wasn’t looking."
BarbleAndBear,fdrvdgo,t1_fdqo7gv,"""Life got pretty great when I wasn't looking.""

SaradominPlatebody,fdqoeur,t3_emq85b,I just wanted to say that I’m a nurse caring for a patient who has end stage bowel cancer. He has weeks to live. I see him everyday and he is always smiling and telling me stories. He keeps a positive mindset and pleasant to be around. Cherish what you have and always make the best of your time. Life is certainly a gift.
megggie,fdso7ap,t1_fdqoeur,"Sending hugs out to you, the caretaker. I was an oncology/hospice RN for years but had to stop because I was taking too much home with me and I didn’t like how it was affecting my family life.

It was the best and worst job I ever had. Met so many amazing people, but at the most difficult point of their lives. I will never forget the strength and courage those patients had, and it helps me to be thankful for the little things.

Thanks for doing what you do ♥️"

AfghanHokie,fdqq5vu,t3_emq85b,"So far 2020 has been a struggle, but I'm choosing to look on the bright side of things.  My car died last Saturday, so I'm stuck taking the bus till I buy a new car.  While disappointed, I'm looking at this as an opportunity for a new car.  I mean it gave me a good 150K and 10 years before it died.  Last time I bought a car, I was making 60% less than I am now.  I also put a little money aside every month once I paid off my car so I have 10K save up, so I'll be able to get a nicer car.  Also my weight loss has stagnated, but at least I'm starting this year over 40 pounds lighter than I was last year.  I'm trying something new to kick start it off again.  I have a trip planned next month, so I'm looking forward to a few trips this year to celebrate turning 40.  So while I'm not where I thought I would be at 40 (married with kids), I still have a pretty good life, a job I like, and enough money to live a comfortable life."
Brocephus420,fdqb1m2,t3_emq85b,"No, I never have. I’m just waiting to die, honestly. But it does please me to know that there are others who have it better. I hope things continue going well for you for as long as possible.


Edit: if you would rather not read the rantings of a depressed person turn back now."
DygonZ,fdqb5ce,t1_fdqb1m2,You've got nothing positive going on in your life? I'm sure there's something?

CriticalPrime9,fdre51v,t1_fdqb1m2,"> I’m just waiting to die, honestly.

God, I know exactly how you feel here... Been there far too many times to be able to count at this point.  
Having been there myself I know there isnt anything I can say to make you feel any different, its a choice you have to make, and only you know the correct decision.

I’ll keep you in my thought and prayers if that’s okay?"
snydamaan,fdrxzer,t1_fdqb1m2,Never? Bullshit. Life isn’t so absolute. You aren’t either depressed or happy. It’s normal to go through periods of happiness and sadness. Your depression doesn’t define who you are.
Brocephus420,fdqbuqf,t1_fdqb5ce,That’s just what people say when they haven’t lived to see the same life I have.  I’ll spare you my childhood but “poor and abused” sums it up. Biggest problem now is I have nerve disease diagnosed a year ago. Had surgery on my spine and leg. I’m now in constant pain. Because of this I lost my job and my health insurance. I can’t get a job that I can physically do that pays more than daycare costs. I don’t qualify for government assistance or government health insurance. I had a couple friends before I got sick but they have since abandoned me. I have no family except my wife and children. My wife resents me for being sick as we are now struggling on her income alone. All I do is keep my kids. We barely leave the house. It’s all I can do to keep them fed and alive. They aren’t happy. They cry all the time. They want more engagement but I’m in pain and I’m exhausted. So no there is nothing.

Maybe you can try to appeal a denial decision for disability in your state. Contact a disability attorney in your area and they can help you appeal. The process is long but you have nothing to loose. Also- a good disability attorney costs nothing upfront. They will take a small percentage of the initial payout at the end. If you can get disability there are lots more programs you and your kids could qualify for. 

She’d possibly take home more money if you can take the kids off her insurance and just have you and her on it. Assuming you can get healthcare for them through your state system. Also- what if you blogged from home? Or did online surveys or something. It might only net $50 a month. You could set that money aside for something nice for the kids. 

A trip to the dollar store can even be super fun with the right mindset, then maybe a cheap treat on the way home. I babysat for a family with three little girls. The family was on a strict budget. The girls were given the treat of going to the dollar store once a month for one item each. Then I’d get donut sticks from Dunkin, one donut stick each. It’s was actually a fun little trip, my rule was- no candy or junk food and no makeup/cosmetics. The girls ended up picking things like art supplies which we turned into a larger projects when we got home. They were really into paper mache- which is basically news papers, elmers glue & water & some flour.  And craft pant. You can get ideas on Pinterest. 

Maybe have the kids pick one project a week. I’m actually working on making Halloween decorations for next Halloween. Instead of buying pumpkins every year I’m making them out of paper mache. It passes the time engages my son and I’m making something for the house instead of buying something. We are trying to pay off student loans & we also cannot afford childcare costs. I have spinal stenosis and scoliosis. I push through with a clean diet and yoga as well as OTC anti inflammatory pills on occasion. When my liver enzymes are low enough to allow for medicine. 

Check out community groups in your area like the Y. They don’t turn away families in need. The kids could swim and participate in lots of sports and other activities. The Y has lots of programs for kids on the community. You might even get them into free day camp. Also- places like the rotary clubs or local charities in your area could offer families fun things to do. On weekends you could take them to a farmers market or just a park. Also some communities have transportation to these activities."
DygonZ,fdqcar9,t1_fdqbuqf,"Yeah, that's pretty terrible. Change starts with yourself though. As long as you stay in this negative mindset, you're going to attract negativity, and that's a fact. However hard it might be, try being somewhat positive, and people around you will also be more inclined to be positive towards you. How you feel about yourself, and how people perceive you is a feedback loop. It starts with yourself, and also from other people. Seeing as you can't force people to feel one way or the other about you, it needs to start with yourself. Once you get the ball rolling, it'll keep going better :)."
cellists_wet_dream,fdqkif2,t1_fdqbuqf,"I’ve been through a lot of the same things and felt the same way for some time. Man, I know it sucks. I know it really does. But it can get better. You have to decide to make it better though, a baby step at a time. If you can find one thing to be grateful for each day, just ONE thing, you will already have made a positive change.  
  
As far as the kids, there are a ton of ways to engage the kids without leaving the house or even being active. Art activities, playing outside, putting on a pretend play...I hope none of this sounds harsh. I know you’re going through a lot and it’s extremely hard to do anything when you’re exhausted and in pain, but you owe this to yourself and to your kids."
Atalanta8,fdstdqu,t1_fdqbuqf,"> I don’t qualify for government assistance or government health insurance.

localnatives3,fdr8q9w,t1_fdr8gu6,I mean actually yes i do i have multiple incorrectly healed injuries on my back that cause me chronic pain all day everyday with nothing i can do about it. And the thing is i wouldnt have these if my mother had taken me to the doctor when they first happened but she refused and now i live in pain.
localnatives3,fdr9dix,t1_fdr8gu6,And if i get surgery its 50/50 of it causing me more damage in pain
Brocephus420,fdqtcqh,t1_fdqs6ci,Thanks for such a thoughtful comment. I’m hoping I’ll be able to get a cheap car soon. That would open up a lot for me and my kids.
Brocephus420,fdqeahd,t1_fdqcar9,"Just be positive. That’s another thing people say when they haven’t lived it. I try man. I do. I smile for my kids. I make home cooked meals for them. I give them hugs and all the love I can, but I’m a broken shell of the person I used to be. I don’t get to be “me” anymore. I had multiple tumors removed but I still have more tumors left than were removed. And they can turn to cancer at any time. Not having health insurance means that I can’t even keep an eye on the development of my multiple multiple tumors growing inside my body. Health-wise I will only get worse. That isn’t negativity but a prognosis given to me by my doctors. I just want you to be happy and look on your life with perspective. It sounds like you have a good life! If you were in my shoes no amount of positive thinking would change your situation. That’s just a defense mechanism people use to believe that they would be better off in my situation. (I’d just think positive!) people say these things because they need it to be my fault so they can believe that it wouldn’t happen to them but it can. It’s not my fault."
Brocephus420,fdqmpyv,t1_fdqkif2,Serious question. Are you chronically ill? Do you have people that care about you? I feel like I’m emotionally empty with no one to lean on. I was abandoned as a child and I just feel like I’ve never felt genuine love. I can’t even say for sure that it exists.
BannanaBun123,fdqtzll,t1_fdqtcqh,My car is broken down too. We need about 2K for all the work. Doing it after we get the tax return. It’s takes extra planning for sure to only have one vehicle.

DygonZ,fdqehhf,t1_fdqeahd,"> It’s not my fault.

I don't think anybody said it was your fault, that shit happens, ain't nobody's fault. :/ Do you feel like it's your fault?"
dorianfinch,fdqnhws,t1_fdqeahd,"comparing trauma doesn't make sense, everyone's traumatized in their own way. take me for example: not at all the same situation as you. however: two time suicide survivor, has about four or five different mental illnesses, abused my whole childhood (and homeschooled until HS, so i had no connection with kids my own age and had no idea this wasn't normal and just took the abuse), transgender, in a big heaping hole of debt and currently unemployed and running low on food stamps. we all have our own struggles. i'm surprisingly pretty happy though. i have made friends by being vulnerable and listening to people at their lowest, so they in turn are vulnerable with me. i have cut off toxic family members. i've learned fun recipes for rice and beans and chicken so food stamps aren't as depressing. i take hot baths when my body aches (i have joint issues that flare up when it gets cold or rainy out). i journal and try to figure out why i feel the things i do.

one thing that's helped me is [radical acceptance.](https://psychcentral.com/blog/what-it-really-means-to-practice-radical-acceptance/) doesn't work for everyone but helps for me. also: prioritizing self-care. if you're already poor and dying (and let's be real, we're all dying, some just faster than others), why not make the ride into the ground as comfortable as possible? before you say you're too poor for self-care, i don't mean necessarily getting a pedicure every day or treating yourself to a fancy meal. self-care can be meditation, playing with your kids, taking some time to read a book or watch tv by yourself instead of dealing with your responsibilities, whatever helps you.

this isn't advice of course. once again, i keep repeating this disclaimer over and over because people don't always understand it, everyone is different. one size does not fit all. just trying to explain how i cope.

life is miserable but i don't have to keep fighting how unfair my lot is. i'm not saying you have to ""think positive"" but there comes a time when i had to tell myself, look, this is the way things are right now and it sucks, there is literally nothing else to do but proceed from here since i can't change the past. how to proceed from here in the most painless and helpful way?

p.s. even if you're not suicidal, suicide hotlines or warmlines offer free and anonymous counseling so even if you can't afford therapy, might be worth calling one sometimes. they might triage you if they have a more suicidal person on the line, but you can always call back later. still better than paying hundreds for therapy you can't afford. i worked at san francisco's suicide hotlines and we got calls from all over the country because the hotline is 24/7 and is well-staffed enough to take non-emergency calls."
WhiteMistral,fdqw7cf,t1_fdqeahd,"It's not your fault.

The cards dealt in your life have been terrible. Nobody should have to go through what you are, and the fact that you are going through it is absolutely terrible.

Positive thinking doesn't take away the tumours. It doesn't take away the nerve damage. It doesn't take away the potential inevitability given by your doctors. Besides, I'm sure you've done enough positive thinking.

What matters is that despite everything, you're still here. I know that you're going to scoff and roll your eyes at that, but it's true. I know it may sound dumb, but I'm glad I was able to sit down and read about your life. Not because your suffering amused me in some way, but because you were able to tell it. That I was able to read and comprehend what you've been going through. I could never, in good conscience, say ""I know how it feels."" to your suffering.

But what I can do is say thank you for having the interest enough to respond to DygonZ, and tell us of your life. I can't promise anything for you, but I can say that I would enjoy learning more of you.

If you would like somebody to talk to sometime, just let me know. Whether it's just PMs or not is fine, but I would like to try and be your friend. To share experiences and so I can listen to you and just be someone there for you.

Let me know."

Here’s hoping we can find a car that’s cheap that she would be willing to drive without being “embarrassed to be seen in it” lol
Ransidcheese,fdqppd0,t1_fdqehhf,"I'm not him but people telling you that positive thinking will fix your problems can make you feel like they're blaming you. It sucks, but theres nothing you can say that will help him. People in his position don't want advice, they want help. They want real, tangible help. Pay for some insurance, pay for treatment, give him a job that he can do in his condition. Whatever it is, it can't just be kind words, no matter how well intentioned.  

I'm not blaming you, it is definitely not your fault that he would see it like that. It's just what depression does to your mind. I'm just trying to inform. 

I hope your day stays good."
Brocephus420,fdqo7lc,t1_fdqnhws,I never said my lot was unfair. I’m just stating the facts of my life and that’s what you have inferred. I have left quite a lot out. For instance I have multiple suicide attempts as well. I have literally hundreds of self inflicted scars. I prefaced my comment with “serious question” because I WANT to hear from someone who has it just as bad as me and has come out the other side. I need hope and I can’t see it.

Make your own hope. I could give you all the reasons I want but you would just find ways to shoot them down. I used to be the same way and honestly the only way I got out of it was by sheer willpower because literally nothing in the world is designed to make a depressed person less depressed. I don't think there's anything I can do to convince you because you've already convinced yourself. I try to think of coping as similar to palliative care. I'm not saying you can fix everything, but you can suffer less.

I survive out of spite because sometimes it feels like the universe is trying to kill me and i can't let it get that satisfaction.

EDIT: oh idk if this helps but here's a safety plan I made for my own use when feeling suicidal; when i started working in suicide prevention organizations they dug it so i made it available publicly for free. it has my name on it so i'm effectively doxxing myself but it can be helpful to others, so: [https://www.sfsuicide.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DIY-safety-plan.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2\_3STuF3ynRA32q3vtr6HnoZSJEWtDRMlOFQUcbUQSQ7TYDHwYDesHmMc](https://www.sfsuicide.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DIY-safety-plan.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2_3STuF3ynRA32q3vtr6HnoZSJEWtDRMlOFQUcbUQSQ7TYDHwYDesHmMc)

Tinsel-Fop,fdvek2f,t1_fds7rvy,">but in truth it actually does help to take a look at yourself and decide for yourself to actively work on being a happier and more positive person.

Now, **this** is some advice. ""Just be positive,"" is not advice but a useless platitude. That's what r/thanksimcured is about: pointing out useless parroted crap that boils down to, ""It's as simple as stopping having the problem!"" Like, ""If you're depressed, try being happier!"" ""Have you tried being less anxious?"" ""Cancer? Stop eating sugar!""

Offering more information and personal insight or perspective like you have is very different from throwing out a sentence saying not to have a problem. Or a paragraph that offers nothing but, ""Don't have the problem!"" And really, those things aren't useless. They can be used to irritate people.

This man ,and I’m sure he’s not alone ,I’m not even gonna burden people with my own problems ,has been dealt an immensely shitty hand in life. And as much as you want them to feel better,doesn’t change their situation. It can be said by changing ones emotional state,can significantly boost their mental and physical state ,that cannot be denied. But what does that do for his relationship with his family,his financial ,his love life with his wife?

Some people are just broken,and I feel fucking terrible to see people go through so much that I too can’t help but to see myself throw love their way as well. 

One thing I will say about this whole thing,the troubled man is an incredible soul,it takes a huge man just to be happy for someone else,even if his own situation isn’t at its best. I don’t if things will ever get better for him,but from severely beaten man to another,I hope he keeps fighting on."

FormerPollution7,fdraxjq,t3_emq85b,"A relevant poem for y'all, The Orange by Wendy Cope:

At lunchtime I bought a huge orange— 
The size of it made us all laugh. 
I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Dave— 
They got quarters and I had a half. 

And that orange, it made me so happy, 
As ordinary things often do 
Just lately. The shopping. A walk in the park. 
This is peace and contentment. It's new. 

The rest of the day was quite easy. 
I did all the jobs on my list 
And enjoyed them and had some time over. 
I love you. I'm glad I exist."
throughamirrordorkly,fdqhrlc,t3_emq85b,"If you can't see the small blessings, you'll never appreciate the big ones. Just my perspective."
DygonZ,fdqmbrp,t1_fdqhrlc,"Exactly, we have a saying in Flemish... But it doesn't really translate to English :p"
bear__attack,fdql94l,t3_emq85b,"Had a similar moment yesterday when I got an extra shot of espresso in my latte. I'm trying to soak up every sweet moment of being home on break, before one last stretch of being away again. Long distance marriage is not easy, but I'm going to enjoy all the good while I've got it."
JSJH,fds9m2y,t1_fdql94l,"My hubster is away a lot for contract jobs he does.  (I recently told him to refuse a 3-year in Thailand.). He's currently only a 5-hour drive (if I ignore speed limits), but is working 12 on/one off, so doesn't come home but once every six or seven weekends.

We talk at least twice a day.  In the mornings on my way to work, about a half-hour; and in the evenings on his way ""home"" to his apartment.  We have Skype dinner dates every week--even making the same meal so it's like we're together.

It's tough, but it's always worth the wait for him to come home."
thebicoastalbisexual,fdqful9,t3_emq85b,"Still waiting for that moment for myself, but I’m happy your life is treating you well!"
DygonZ,fdqg4qk,t1_fdqful9,"Well, it wasn't always, and I realize that it won't always be either in the future, but when it is, it's great :)."
Partydacks,fdqnd6h,t3_emq85b,"Now imagine if you were vegan, that egg could have ruined your day  :P"
DygonZ,fdqnn8i,t1_fdqnd6h,"Used to be an everyday meat eater, now I've cut down to meat 3 times a week!. For me it's more about environmental reasons than animal reasons though :)"
Atalanta8,fdstvrg,t1_fdqnn8i,Environmental reasons are animal reasons.
DygonZ,fdtsswx,t1_fdstvrg,"Well of course, that's a happy side effect. However, I'm more concerned about us ruining the planet so us humans can't live on it anymore."
Atalanta8,fdtumhr,t1_fdtsswx,and humans aren't animals?
DygonZ,fdtuqgw,t1_fdtumhr,"I'd like to think we've transcended that... well, at least some of us :)."
janet-eugene-hair,fdqomco,t3_emq85b,What kind of sandwich was it?
AshtonTS,fdqpqxx,t1_fdqomco,Egg
dweakz,fdrasik,t1_fdqpqxx,with xtra egg
Calvinball_Ref,fdqsqsn,t3_emq85b,Yes! It’s the little things sometimes. I had a double lung transplant a few years ago. I was cleaning snow and ice off my car the other day and I realized I could do it. I didn’t have to stop to catch my breath. I didn’t feel like passing out or throwing up. It was such a great little moment and it made my day.
TheSaltyGerman,fdrbe1h,t3_emq85b,"I gotta story like this, I was walking home from school and just looked up for no particular reason and saw the huge trees arching over the road and just stopped in my tracks and said, “damn, the worlds beautiful” and then kept walking but that made my whole week."
wh0dareswins,fdrd1we,t3_emq85b,So your life is EGGselent?
jbonte,fdqefp2,t3_emq85b,"Sometimes it truly is the smallest of things.  
Also give yourself a party on the back for being able to see the small things.  
We often “ lose sight of the trees for the forest” and the forest is huge and scary and overwhelming sometimes.  
Congratulations!"
ConfidentlyShy17,fdqu2y9,t3_emq85b,I wish. I've been miserable for about a year and a half now and really depressed for a few months. My life isn't getting better anytime soon but I want to believe that things will look up eventually. It's the only thing keeping me here.
spiderkobe,fdr8861,t1_fdqu2y9,"Same bro. My life isn’t looking too good going forward. Lonely, repetitive, surrounded by people I can’t stand. I really got nothing keeping me here. But the last of us 2 is coming so that’s something."
ScatterF1,fdtend0,t1_fdqu2y9,I feel the exact same way. I wish the pain would just go away TBH and also wish I had something more helpful to say. Just take comfort in the fact that you're not alone in this even though it may feel like it. I hope things turn around for you soon
ConfidentlyShy17,fdvlwt4,t1_fdtend0,Thanks. This past week was kinda bad and I was thinking of some dark stuff but it's starting to get better. I don't feel depressed rn (albeit kinda tired bc I just woke up) so I'd say that's a plus
matticusiv,fdshwpv,t3_emq85b,I fluctuate from “things are pretty good” to “my life is a lie” every few days or so.
IGiveTheRainbowToYou,fdshyck,t3_emq85b,"I went and got a massage on my lunch break the other day because I had a sore neck. 

I realized because of my job flexibility this is something I can 100% do if I need to.

I reflected on life and realized this is the highest standard of living I've ever experienced. I have a decent job that pays the bills, a nice little flat, and I'm not miserable for the first time in my life."
kj1114,fdsmesa,t3_emq85b,Gratitude. I started randomly chanting the words thank you to myself b/c even on uneventful or not so great days and I am thankful for how far I’ve come and how far I am going. It’s bringing me so much peace ✨
DEVILSCUNT,fdsooxo,t3_emq85b,"This is just so genuine and pure. I wish you the best, OP!"
oops_boops,fdsosre,t3_emq85b,"Thank you for sharing! This is lovely to read.

My little moment of happiness was yesterday.
I had finished the final (!) exam on my army training course which lasted 5 months. 
5 months of very very little sleep, not great food/not enough of it, studying every day 24/7, not seeing my family/ friends frequently etc. 

After the test, my course buddies and I just screamed, dressed up, took fun pictures and just goofed around at 1AM. 

I can’t believe I did it. It was incredibly difficult. I had thought of giving up every step of the way, but I didn’t, and I made it to the finish line. Like some crazy 5 month long marathon. 

Life is good. I’m capable of more than I’ve ever thought I am and I’m so happy to have made it to this point in my life."
thecrabandthemoon,fdsot15,t3_emq85b,yess i love this! i had a lady upgrade my snack size mcflurrry to full size. i felt so loved and blessed 😊
Atalanta8,fdssbr4,t3_emq85b,Reminds me of the time my egg Benedict was missing the yolk. Oh wait that's the opposite.
crsdrjct,fdsso6s,t3_emq85b,"That's awesome man. Made me smile.

I've been feeling down lately for no particular reason but I'm in the airport terminal now about to meet up with my friends for a weekend and Seattle and realizing my life is good. Bless up"
temporarybeing65,fdqbh2r,t3_emq85b,Yes! Sometimes some little something happens and it’s like a little wink. It makes up for bad things.
jva7,fdqluav,t3_emq85b,"Cutting down that commute is huge. I also had a two hour commute and it was miserable, takes away a lot of time. Also extra egg on the sandwich is a blessing. Enjoy those little and big things"
donac,fdqm6md,t3_emq85b,I love those moments!  Congratulations!!
DygonZ,fdqm7z5,t1_fdqm6md,"Thanks man, it feels good :)"
jewzak,fdqnp46,t3_emq85b,"Gratitude leads to happiness, not the other way around <3"
Kaylors,fdqnwkq,t3_emq85b,"Thanks for sharing this, OP! I'll try to appreciate the extra eggs in my life more often :)"
jcling,fdqomet,t3_emq85b,"That's awesome, I used to have a 10 minute commute to work. It was amazing. Cherish it while you can."
ChaoticGoodPanda,fdqozny,t3_emq85b,"Abundance mindset, it’ll change your life."
cornicat,fdqqb8k,t3_emq85b,"I had that once. 10 years ago. It’s been downhill ever since. Plus now I feel like eggs and I’m too lazy to make any so I’ve got that going for me.

But congrats on your thing!"
jinlng,fdqqyzz,t3_emq85b,I'm sorta having a bad time and it makes me appreciate more of the good things that I had/am having. Silver lining I guess
TheAwsomeOcelot,fdqr28f,t3_emq85b,"I realize it Everytime I look at one of my somewhat new friends. I changed schools in 2019 and that was the best year of my life so far. Everytime talk to her I just feel overwhelming joy because 1: she's honestly just a great person and had made me happier than I've ever been, and 2: she represents everything going right in my life. I see her nearly every day, and I'm always so happy for everything my life has become, related to and even because of her."
ProsperusB,fdqtd6v,t3_emq85b,Appreciate the little things. I love a blue sky and some clouds rolling by. Simple as that. Be present in the moment.
chevychasist,fdqzblw,t3_emq85b,Egg sandwiches are tasty and make you realize what life has to offer
J_A_Angel,fdrgnhn,t3_emq85b,"I'm on my 5th day of a debilitating migraine and it is awful. But I have coffee, amazing pumpkin cake and an exam offer for a work from home job I would love to have. All in all things could be way worse."
themistoclesia,fds5vwq,t3_emq85b,"Gratitude and perspective are wonderful things.  My mom used to say that whenever people are angry or upset over BFs/GFs, jobs, finances, exes, disappointments, or any of the thousands of other things that we consider “problems” in our lives, we should go spend a little time with children on the oncology floor of a major hospital, or the families in the waiting room of a burn unit.  

She wasn’t trying to imply that all problems have to rise to the level of cancer to be significant, but only that it’s so easy to focus on the things that are “wrong” in our lives that we forget 1) Perspective:  that things really *could* be much, much worse, and 2) Gratitude:  that it’s also important to focus on all the things in our lives that we *haven’t* had to face, the things that have gone very *right* for us.  

A lot of things that we call problems are really more like inconveniences when weighed against all the possibilities.  Also, we’re waaay more inclined to focus on our challenges than on our blessings.  Thank you for the reminder, b/c I’ve been focusing in the wrong direction in my own life recently."
NuclearQueen,fdsatjg,t3_emq85b,"My life is relatively great but I'm still super unhappy..... Thanks, mental illness! 

What kind of sandwich did you get?"
BasilEllish,fdsevgr,t3_emq85b,"I truly feel for you.

During the past 2 years, I've had nothing but bad news and major hits to my financial, physical, and emotional health. I lost my partner of 8 years, my job, and have been such an anxious and depressed mess that my roommates avoid and pity me. I have basically no friends (2, abroad), in a new city and I'm estranged from my family.

&#x200B;

Today I got a job offer at a good company for a good position that's in line with my career goals and I've been crying tears of joy all day. This was the first bit of good news I've had in 2 years. Perhaps in a some time, I'll get a sandwich and find myself with extra eggs too.

&#x200B;

I'm truly happy for you and hope to find myself in your kind of moment of self-reflection and satisfaction sometime soon. [Keep on Chooglin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaGjIlbbQI4) til you're at the [top of your game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11O3Xi4fp8o) In the very least, [I'm not as I was.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-MG12AWwB8&list=RD11O3Xi4fp8o&index=8) Nor are you and I hope your journey only continues to bring more happiness and stability."
gaatu,fdsg9f2,t3_emq85b,"May I ask how you went about finding a good psychiatrist that you vibe with and how much it costs per session? How many did you have to go through to find one you liked? Also, if you don't mind me asking, what medical insurance do you have?

I've been interested in seeing someone for a long time, but can't justify the price...also I just haven't been able to vibe with the few that I have seen so it feels like more money down the drain at this point. 

Thanks!"
DygonZ,fdttfrq,t1_fdsg9f2,"Finding a psychiatrist is a very personal choice. Luckily, I got a good one first try. I did some research on what psychiatrist is supposed to be, and the guy seemed to tick all the boxes. A good psychiatrist isn't supposed to tell you what to do, or what is right or wrong. A good psychiatrist is supposed to listen, and help you see what's going wrong. He's supposed to help you, help yourself. Every person is so unique that only you yourself can make your psychological problems go away. Any psychiatrist that tells you what to do, is a bad psychiatrist. 

I live in Belgium so we all have near full coverage, however psychiatrists aren't covered. It was 50 euros per 1 hour session. I could pay for it and it was worth it, in my opinion."
Oliviasharp2000,fdqomk6,t3_emq85b,"hey op i want u to have a good life, but I also want everyone and everything on earth to also have a good life.  look into cowspiracy and also be aware of the causes of climate change, thanks"
sewergrl,fdqscbj,t3_emq85b,"Stuff like this happens at least once a day to me and it’s seriously the best thing ever. Just redirects my mind to realize how good life really fucking is and as someone who has dealt with crippling depression and anxiety as recent as this past summer, I seriously appreciate every second of it because it may not last forever!"
Boswardo,fdqso3o,t3_emq85b,All the time!
Joesdad65,fdqsurx,t3_emq85b,Gratefulness is necessary for real happiness.
Mimipancakes,fdqy3ha,t3_emq85b,"I feel like I always complain about the stupidest things, yet find joy in even more stupid things. Like everyday I just wanna quit, but I always find that one thing in my day to hold onto. Life really feels meaningless, but damn you gotta love that extra egg."
ShattingBracks,fdqyfzm,t3_emq85b,"Honestly the last time everything in my life was going well and I acknowledged it, I was diagnosed with ITP (a rare blood disorder) that night, so yeah I'm a bit pessimistic now if anything is ever going well for me because there's always God ready with a sniper rifle ready to shoot me down lmao"
NazgulDiedUnfairly,fdqzvyw,t3_emq85b,"Appreciating the small things in life makes us see the bigger picture!
I realised this when I was making plans to go home this summer. Being close to my mom, I used to go home once is a couple of months but after starting grad school, it would be my first time home in summer with a nice high paying internship lined up just after. Life is good with a lot of eggs on the side :)"
Icanhelp12,fdr0plp,t3_emq85b,"Yeah.. sometimes you need to stop and smell the flowers. And those flowers are what’s actually going right in your life right now. 

In the past 3-4 years my husband and I have collectively had: A brain surgery to remove a tumor (turned out to be benign), meningitis, and a rare bacteria that causes severe pneumonia landing me in the hospital for a week and almost in the ICU. Huge family issues/changes, job changes, and then some... 

And our life is good. We have a roof over our heads, we have food in our fridge, we have good jobs, and we enjoy each other’s company. My husband is the type that will wallow if allowed, whereas I am just a “keep going, keep going.. people have it worse than you mentality”. Perhaps it balances us out 

I’m happy you got two eggs this am! Means a start to a good weekend!"
Usual_Yellow,fdr3fb9,t3_emq85b,It's so nice to appreciate the little things in life sometimes. We are always so busy with work or school or family or whatever stresses us out that I think a lot of people forget to appreciate the small stuff. Thanks for the reminder! 😊
Piccy13,fdr4lfn,t3_emq85b,Sometimes there’s no need to travel halfway around the world to realize how much life is precious and beautiful. The most beautiful things are in the details :)
grilledcakes,fdr4pho,t3_emq85b,Absolutely. The little things can snap our focus on the big things into place. The strangest detail may be the key to putting together things that didn't even seem connected and making them clear.
TimeShenanigans,fdr4y7b,t3_emq85b,"I felt like that after reading Song of Saya. The visual novel is pretty upsetting, but after going through it I had some peach cobbler and it was delicious. And I thought, ""Hey, I guess I'm alright."""
nuwanda3333,fdr5ylr,t3_emq85b,"Sometimes- but lately it occurs less and less. Sometimes my cat's purr reminds me how great life is, and coffee, and sunshine."
DygonZ,fdr7fkx,t1_fdr5ylr,"> Sometimes my cat's purr reminds me how great life is, and coffee, and sunshine.

It's something different for everybody. When summer starts, or spring, and you get that first glimpse of hot sunrays pouring on your face, smothering you, that gooey, hot liquid sunsh... ooh wait, that was something else, but yeah, sunshine is good!"
nuwanda3333,fdrmpf2,t1_fdr7fkx,lol!
My_Name_Squee,fdr67f5,t3_emq85b,That's Egg-cellent bro! Life is not a yolk!

th3_real_abhishek,fdr69ze,t3_emq85b,"I sit outside my hostel room, in the evening and get to see the sunset everyday. That's the time of the day when I ponder over the beauty of little things around us. To the least, i feel happy because we all know how crappy hostel rooms can be."

xochitl-lazuline-,fdr77cn,t3_emq85b,"Yesterday a joint a heating pad a comfy bed AND a fucking home cooked meal miraculously fell out from the sky and as I laid there in the bed with heating pad and joint - I too thought, wow life is damn good. Fuck yeah. Jk this was so lame even to type out lol but what I described is my nightly routine and I often think about how great things are going. Sometimes all that’s needed to be appreciative is comparison. For example my routine may not spark joy in anyone else but for me, in comparison to a couple years back, this is big. Recognizing and acknowledging big and small victories is essential to changing your mindset"
DygonZ,fdr850n,t1_fdr77cn,"Yeah man, you gotta build it up. If your life now is better than a few years back, I'd say you're doing pretty alright! It's not like my life went from shit to great. It builds up, and then after a while you'll come to a moment where you say, fuck, my life's pretty sweet. :)"
Ash_Fenix,fdrdgxp,t3_emq85b,"As cheesy as it might seem, the old adage of straw that broke the camels back does work both ways.  Sometimes, it could be the simplest of things occur...like this...and it suddenly makes life seem a bit better, or put things in a better perspective.  

Everyone deserves an eye opening or rewarding moment every once in a while."
ginger2020,fdrke3e,t3_emq85b,"Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank God

I don’t know, but today seems kinda odd"
Lukkazx,fdrnnf9,t3_emq85b,Your positivity is admirable. Finding joy in something like that is remarkable and makes me lament my own zombification. What is your secret to be a successful man
DygonZ,fdrorl8,t1_fdrnnf9,"Nothing's my secret man. Just gotta find what you enjoy. It might seem insignificant, but you gotta take what you can. Make life work for you, don't work for you life. But don't think it's all sunshine and rainbows, I've had and probably will have my down times as well. Live in the moment is probably the best advise I can give :)"
Lukkazx,fdrpbvu,t1_fdrorl8,Wow this cured me

general_kitten_,fdrr4j6,t3_emq85b,for me for some unexplainable reason pulling a perfect espresso shot reminds me of greatness of my life. for more context i have an italian manual lever espresso machine (la pavoni) and the times you get everything just right brings immense joy.
Shitty-Coriolis,fdrrv35,t3_emq85b,Unfortunately for me... Things can be going great and I'm still miserable

Awesome!"
mysmileindisguise,fds1dpb,t3_emq85b,When I realized that I can fall asleep in under 10 minutes while literally counting my blessings one by one after 15 years of insomnia and terrible anxiety when I lay down at night was my extra egg epiphany that my life was finally going well and I was legitimately at peace and happy. Forgive me for the run-on sentence.
CowgirlInASpacesuit,fds39s9,t3_emq85b,"I wanted a stupid expensive ornament for Christmas. It was outlandishly priced so I didn't mention it to anyone as a possible gift to me. I mean, come on Hallmark, this shit is just plastic! I put it past me and enjoyed the holidays. They were good times, but not great. Some family members have illnesses and issues, but I'm happy I got to spend time with people I care about. My gifts to people this year seemed to go over better than years before when I would find whatever thing online. This year, I handmade more things, purchased handmade things from others, and gave memberships to local museums for those who had too many things. I didn't realize at the time just how personal those types of gifts really are until the recipients expressed real joy and thanks. I just wanted to do something more unique than gift another popcorn maker. My favorite gift I had gotten was a handmade wooden puzzle my dad picked out for me. We would play puzzle games together, and I realized just how heart felt this gift was. He gave me a reminder of times we spent together.  



I had forgotten about the ornament until a week after Christmas when my mom and I went shopping, and I decided to hopelessly peek at leftover ornaments. And there it was, the one I wanted, at 60% off! I bought the ornament at a far more reasonable price for a tiny piece of plastic displayed 1/12th of the year. I think of it as a symbol of what 2019 taught me- patience and time are the real gifts my family and I want. The useless shit I don't need will only be worth it when it goes on sale at 60% off and I buy it for myself. Life is good, and its good to reminders why life is good."
mammothtrex27,fds5105,t3_emq85b,This made me smile. Fuck yes.
DygonZ,fds534p,t1_fds5105,It's making me smile how happy this post is making people :).
sansa3000,fds6cfr,t3_emq85b,I’m really glad the extra egg made you realize this 💜
Jehovanoid,fds7lek,t3_emq85b,"That's awesome man!
I was actually just yesterday chilling on the couch and feeling a bit shit physically as well as emotionally. 
So i poured some fine cognac, rolled a joint, made some tea and snacks. Then after smoking a joint I sat back down on the couch and started to really think about how i lucky I am. Lucky that i can even enjoy those drinks and snacks, lucky that i can play guitar, lucky i have a nice apartment with my wife and lucky that i have a job and friends.

Sometimes we really forget the things we have and we take them for granted. So, i think we need to more often just sit down and do nothing, besides thinking about our lives and what have, rather than we don't have."
pineappleandmilk,fds7xp3,t3_emq85b,I’m sick as hell at the moment and you just made me do the same personal inventory. Thanks for the positivity 💕
babloki1234,fds8wxr,t3_emq85b,"I'm really glad for you buddy, for me it is really stressful these days and I've been loving this girl for quite some time but I got ignored badly by her one day and since that time I've been feeling like shit inside hahaha"
cvgbhj,fdsa2es,t3_emq85b,Yeah but when I do this I think “something seems off” then someone dies and it’s back to grief and chaos!
VorticalHydra,fdscufv,t3_emq85b,"I'm happy for you! I do the same a lot. I've been moving up pretty fast in the industry I work in and I'm grateful for that. I dont live a lavish life but I'm happy because I dont hate my job, I have a car that gets me where I need to be and it's also my only source of debt. One thing I dont have is a GF but I have friends that I play video games with and hang out with when I get a chance. 

I do have to remind myself, mostly when driving to work, to appreciate life more. It helps to ease my anxiety most of the time."
ax_colleen,fdsde1s,t3_emq85b,There’s this avocado egg cheese sandwich that made my day. Glad this made your day!
catdafritz,fdsdpph,t3_emq85b,"Today I was told that life is all about the little victory’s. You finally got up early and ran? Celebrate. You did that thing for work on time? Celebrate. You made your bed in the morning? Celebrate. You ordered a sub and got extra egg? Enjoy that. All those little victories add up to a big victory. Whatever that victory maybe. It’s different for everyone. 

I thought that was a really great mindset to have and somewhat related to your post."
Cynthiagarden,fdse8iu,t3_emq85b,"I think that feeling grateful for the little things in life, opens up one's heart to see ""wonder"" in the little things! 

I remember coming home from work, with no money in my pocket or the bank...feeling scared & lonely because of that. But the fact is, I had food at home, and beer, or whatever I wanted to drink. But yet, I felt sad & ""pitiful.""

Now, years later, I have been in the same financial strain, and felt differently. I realize now, that although the cash is not readily on-hand, I have everything I need for today, and that makes me feel blessed. I'm like, ""Man, glad I don't need anything at the store today. Tomorrow, I'll have money from ...\[my side-gig\].""

Time has taught me to be grateful, and my attitude makes a huge difference in the kind of day I have. You're so right...Mindset is everything!"

rkkherself,fdt9miz,t3_emq85b,Good for you! Keep up with that mindset
schnappsbooze,fdtb4ky,t3_emq85b,"Usually my life happens in the opposite way. When things go well, there's usually something else to happen to knock me down a notch. That being said I'm still positive and believe things will always get better."
ChellHole,fdtmyyn,t3_emq85b,Sounds like you like to see things sunny side up!
AscendedAnton,fduxeb4,t3_emq85b,"YES, I'm still working on making things good though I'm not really feeling great. I'm really stressed and incredibly confused"
saraheona,fe2m7uw,t3_emq85b,That’s so wholesome to hear how tiny things like getting an extra egg on a sandwich can make a difference in your life. That just shows how much you really value and appreciate good moments after going through a rough patch in the past.
Btreeb,elac0i,top_level,"Yesterday I was at the gym. Next (left) to me was a boy (person 1)  who seemed mentally disabled (having conversations with himself and just acting 'different'). He was having a good times.

Not much later two boys (person 2+3;  I think they were around 20 y.o.) got on the treadmills to the right of me. They seemed to know person 1 and started with giving easy challenges. Things like ""Can you run 15km/h. I don't believe it"". So person 1 accepted the challenge. It seemed fine. However, after a while it got more intense. They challenged him to go 25km/h and I could hear person 2 and 3 saying to each other that it would be nice to see person 1 fall, bc of the speed. Person 1 didn't get it that they were obviously bullying him; he probably thought it was just for fun.

During the challenges I saw person 2 and 3 making videos. I assumed they were using Snapchat. They were also making fun of him. After 10 minutes or so it was still going on and without really thinking about it, I approached person 2 and 3 and confronted them with their behaviour. At first they told me to shut up, as I didn't know them (which doesn't really matter in my opinion, as their behaviour was just unacceptable).

I told them their behaviour seemed wrong to me a person 1 was an easy target and didn't see that he was made fun of. Besides that, making Snaps made it worse. Person 2 (the main bully) started to ignore me when I told him about his behaviour. However, person 3 (he was not really giving the challanges, but just laughing and whispering ideas to person 2) started to talk. He told me I was right and their behaviour was wrong. After I though that I made my message / opinion clear, I walked away. 

When I walked away, person 2 whispered some shit to me. I didn't react to it. After I confronted the two boys, the bullying stopped, so I didn't care about what they thought of me, as I achieved my goal.

I'm proud of my action, as I am quite insecure (as I'm pretty short for a man and look really young (I'm in my twneties and people often think I am 17 or 18). Because of feeling insecure, I didn't always undertake action in similiar events. Now I did and it proved I can do it. 

TL: DR. I stopped two bullies, helped a boy and proved myself that I shouldn't be insecure."
ineptanna,fdgho1r,t3_elac0i,Thank you for stepping in. Not enough people do.
Btreeb,fdgifxg,t1_fdgho1r,"I agree. I saw other people noticing it too, but they just didn't do anything. That's what happens way too often."
FancyAdult,fdh19l2,t1_fdgho1r,"Yes, we need more people like you in this world.  Thank you for doing this.  I have a daughter and would be so grateful if someone  stepped in to stop another person from bullying her, and vice versa if she were behaving badly I would hope someone would say something."
SoraForBestBoy,fdi29o9,t1_fdgifxg,Not all heroes wear capes
thatmarlergirl,fdicwys,t1_fdgifxg,You probably changed their perspective after that. Seeing you stand up for the kid and nothing bad happening will encourage them in the future.
CanHappen,fdii5g8,t1_fdgifxg,Well done my man. I’m proud of you!!
Btreeb,fdh4qae,t1_fdh19l2,Thank you for your kind words. It sucks to hear about your daughter. I really hope someone will stand up for her and stop her bully!
omppum41n,fdi8iww,t1_fdi29o9,Yeah. Unless OP was wearing a cape to the gym.
Icebolt08,fdip71e,t1_fdi29o9,"*No Capes*

classicfilmfan,fdik6er,t1_fdh4qae,"All too often, whether bullying of some sort or other occurs in school, in the workplace, or in the gym or wherever, people, especially those in position of authority are either too pre-occupied, into their own agenda,  or just don't care enough to put a stop to bullying.  It's really disgusting.  These anti-bullying programs are total BS.  They don't work, at least in part because people in authority don't stop it."

Daddy_0103,fdgj04t,t3_elac0i,Does the gym have a policy against recording?  You should report them as well.
Btreeb,fdgmfwj,t1_fdgj04t,I don't know if there is a policy for that. I did inform the gym about the event. Hopefully they will do something with it.
benji0110,fdgolek,t1_fdgmfwj,I think most gyms have this policy but this won't stop people from doing it anyway. What you did was the right thing and more people like you should exist. Thank you for making the world a much better place
Daddy_0103,fdgpu66,t1_fdgolek,There will always be a-holes. But it could at least stop these two if they get banned.
Flv03,fdgpc3t,t3_elac0i,"Doesn't matter how you look or how big you are. What you did makes you bigger than all of them. You had the courage to stand up for what you believe is right. They had no courage when they picked on somebody weaker than them. 

You are the real man here haha. Well done"
Btreeb,fdgslig,t1_fdgpc3t,"Thanks. You're right. I found out by this that's it's more about the way you act, than that you look."
HelenaHandkart,fdgrv89,t3_elac0i,"Well done. Also, taking pics will get you banned from most gyms. Report them and get rid of them. This sort of behaviour is unacceptable and makes the world worse for all of us. There was a thread recently in AITA where I said this and got bumped from the thread for so doing."
Btreeb,fdh51bb,t1_fdgrv89,"I think that it's a difficult rule to maintain, as many people record hemselves / their friends to check their form during the exercises. But I agree with you; maybe it's better to forbid recording."
Pre-Owned-Car,fdh8yxp,t1_fdh51bb,It’s a rule that exists to be enforced when there’s an issue. If you’re recording yourself for form they’ll look the other way. Probably only comes up so they have a rule on the books to kick people out of the gym when there’s an incident like this.
HelenaHandkart,fdhn8gr,t1_fdh51bb,That's a fair point. Maybe we need gyms where there are people on the floor? I was on crutches (years ago) and some prick tried to intimidate me off a machine. Never happened to me when I haven't been crippled. Would've been nice to encounter the same gentleman once I was back on my feet properly...
Bionicbutter4354,fdh0a7u,t3_elac0i,I wish people would step in when I'm getting bullied good work OP you restored my faith in humanity
Btreeb,fdh2f5y,t1_fdh0a7u,"It sucks to rear that! In my opinion bystanders should take more action in situations like that, but I know it's hard to do that. Anyway, now I've done it once, I will do it more easily in the future.

Stay strong ;)."
ForumMMX,fdhbh4s,t1_fdh0a7u,"Oh my, that's so sad to hear. I consider the quiet bystanders to be almost as bad or worse as the bullies themselves.  Isn't there HR that you can talk to or your boss or that person's boss? I wish I could help you!.

dracapis,fdh6x4r,t1_fdgmdu5,"That was a great answer and I'm sure it made him think even though he ignored you. If he’s not a total piace of poop, he’ll end up mulling over it wether he wants it or not"

verifiedbyme,fdid4jo,t1_fdhh3bq,Hah. Now you said poop too.
Seranfall,fdgrqtt,t3_elac0i,More people need to do this. You should report them to the gym for recording others. I would assume most gyms have rules against that stuff.

Btreeb,fdh9obm,t1_fdh8zo7,"Thanks! It should become a normal thing to do. I think that as it's unusual to do things like this, people don't dare to do it as they will be 'different' then; even if it's different in a positive way."
sufferingthroughIB,fdh9t0u,t1_fdh9obm,"I always viewed it one of the best lessons my dad ever taught me, I know for sure I’ll pass it on to my children.

1me2rulethemall,fdh0iou,t3_elac0i,This is awesome. Thank you for doing that. My boyfriend was bullied in middle school and when he got to high school he ended up being one of the “popular kids” so he used his newfound power to stand up for anyone who was being bullied. He became known as the guy to go to if someone was bullying you. The bullies feared and respected him so they’d always stop if he came around.
poetryandpotion,fdh8wh7,t3_elac0i,"What you said at the end really hit me hard. People often think I’m a teenager because I’m so shy, but I’m actually in my 20’s. But engaging my presence in situations like this has consistently helped. 

I bet those guys walked away thinking about their actions because of you. That’s some powerful shit."
Btreeb,fdh9i25,t1_fdh8wh7,"Thanks for your reply; it helped me realize that I'm not the only one that looks younger than his age. I often 'forget' I am not the only one.

I will remember your advice; doing the 'scary' things might boost me confidence :)."
Call_Me_Kelv,fdijvui,t1_fdh8wh7,"I’m almost 21 now and still looking like a 13yo. On the positive side, when you and OP are at your 30s or 40s, looking young will make you feel great."

Btreeb,fdh57au,t1_fdgzims,I agree. I think many bullies don't really realize what effects their actions might have on another person. I hope I made them realize it (a bit at least) and that they will be more aware about it in the future.

You made a stand which is certainly commendable. Look out for him, look for yourself and make sure the gym knows what's going on. Bullies, if given inches, take miles."
Btreeb,fdhla9d,t1_fdhebqm,"They told me that person 1 was their friend. But I think they make him think he's a friend, while in reality he's a 'friend' in such a way to only be made fun of. Really sad."
jacobspartan1992,fdhsw0e,t1_fdhla9d,"I was one in that position of a 'friend' during my sixth form years and it's sad reflecting on that now. I wasted too much of my time on bad people. 

You might want to befriend him yourself, if only in a gym context and find out more and make sure he's picks up a hint. That's me wanting to save him the pain, he needs to learn to spot fakers."

When I was in 9th grade, my biology teacher was a bully. I was smart and got straight As while my best friend at the time had obvious undiagnosed ADHD and was disruptive/got bad grades. It was a Christian school, so the parents didn’t believe in adhd (fucking idiots, but that’s a story for a different day). My bio teacher would straight up call my best friend stupid until she cried. One day I stood up in front of everyone and said “why are you bullying a ninth grade girl? Don’t you think that’s rude?” And the bullying lessened after that. The teacher looked shocked and didn’t knew what to say. But you should be proud of yourself. That kid deserved you."

Btreeb,fdj9ym2,t1_fdi8fcq,"Person 1 didn't thank me, but I also think that it has to do with the fact that he didn't really comprehend what was going on. Person 2+3 did know what was going on and were just making fun of P1. I'm glad I could stop these two- so called- 'friends' of him."
vuxxx_,fdia78c,t3_elac0i,Bless you. I am also young looking and kinda short I guess which discourages me from speaking up. Reading this helps me realize I can what you did! 🙏🙏🙏
Btreeb,fdj9q6z,t1_fdia78c,"Thank you. I know it can be difficult to look younger and be short. This one action I did won't make me overcome all of my insecurities, but it is one of the little steps. 

Hopefully you will makes these steps too now!"
KnightOfTheLynx,fdiasac,t3_elac0i,And then everyone clapped. And person 1? He grew up to be Albert Einstein!
Btreeb,fdj9m5d,t1_fdiasac,I hope so. Person 1 seems to enjoy life and I hope will keep enjoying it!

paradox8493,fdifem2,t3_elac0i,"A girl stopped one dude from bullying me once in middle school. It was pretty great. The dude bullied me for like weeks, but then in math class he said like one thing to me in front of her and I think she actually said something like, “Cut that out right now or I won’t date you.” (Or she’d dump him or something. I honestly don’t remember. But anyway, she just told him to stop that one time.) He never bullied me again. Ever. And we still had at least 4 more years of school. Maybe even 5 because I think it was 7th grade. I honestly have no idea how she stopped him forever just like that, but it was pretty amazing. And she dated plenty of other dudes even just later that year, but he never started up again."
Thuglife07,fdik8d7,t1_fdifem2,"You honestly have no idea how she stopped him?   Dude.  Really?   You don’t know the power girls possess?  If not you should really try being with a girl sometime.  Kinda makes sense now why a girl had to stop you from getting bullied lol.  
TL;DR: he bullied to try and impress her so he could get laid.  She said that won’t get you laid.  Bully then realizes bullying wont get him laid and henceforth stops bullying in hopes of getting laid.   Lesson stuck with him even after the aforementioned floozy moved on to the next one."

bulkapothecary,fdihr4a,t3_elac0i,I'm so glad you said something! Nice job for defending person 1. Did you report it to the gym? Many have policies against taking videos of others like that and could take more action.
Btreeb,fdj9ji8,t1_fdihr4a,"I did mention it to the gym; they will keep an eye out. There is- as far as I know- no policy against all forms of recording. Although, I am sure that making recordings in a way they did is not accepted."
Mithryl_Ivy,fdiivkq,t3_elac0i,"Kudos to you! Too many people look the other way. I struggle when I see an abusive relationship in action. I’ve confronted the abuser however I end up regretting it later because I was an in an abusive relationship for many years. I know when I walk away or they got home it will be worse for the abused person that I stepped in then if I had left it alone. 
Human beings like you are the special ones! Thank you for your kindness"
classicfilmfan,fdijnpm,t3_elac0i,"Good for you for stopping those two bullies, Btreeb!  It's good that Person 3 told you that you were right, and that Person 2 (the main bully) was wrong."

the_tallest_thing324,fdin23f,t3_elac0i,I love you.
the_tallest_thing324,fdint8t,t1_fdin23f,"I will elaborate. At the risk of sounding arrogant, I kind of have a Captain America story. All throughout high school I was a small kid (male) who looked 5 years younger than I was (I literally weighed \~92 pounds and looked like I was 11 years old in my freshman year of high school), and as a result I was less *bullied* (although that did happen from time to time, but I've always been charistmatic I guess), and more *disrespected*. It wasn't very fun and made me feel, well small.

Fast forward to age 27. I'm 170 pounds, can curl 55 pounds on each arm, have a bona fide six pack, look like I'm 24, and am a comfortable 5'9"". It's not a bad place to be appearance-wise. Granted, I still struggle with OCD-related mental illness and gut issues, so all is not ""as it may seem"", but I really don't have to worry about my core physical appearance.

Anyway, you're probably thinking ""who is this dude, why should I care, and why is he talking about how he likes his body, and what is my favorite color of a cat?"" Those are all good questions. The answer to all but one of those is, I hate bullies. Cap hates bullies too, he said it in the latest Marvel movie. 

As far as the answer to the last one - hell if I know. I'm gonna go with off-white with brown stripes. 

Seriously tho bro good for you"
Btreeb,fdj98x0,t1_fdint8t,"I agree. Bullies are just useless. Most of the time they only bully to make themselves feel better / or to prevent themselves from becoming the victim.

At the moment I own a tuxedo cat ;)"
the_tallest_thing324,fdm8bas,t1_fdj98x0,"Bet that's a nice color for a cat!! My parents own a gorgeous sleek black cat, he's great"
Btreeb,fdmi8t4,t1_fdm8bas,"They're nice too. I got a second cat which was sleek black too. However, my cat and the 'new' black stand couldn't stand each other. -_-.

Ate02muc,fdiq0ox,t3_elac0i,Thank you for being an amazing person. I see so many people on places like r/teenagers commenting on posts about needing more bullies and it always irritates the living hell out of me. Thanks for standing up for the boy and being a decent human being
Btreeb,fdj9a2p,t1_fdiq0ox,Really? Why would they want more bullies?
Ate02muc,fdjrpuq,t1_fdj9a2p,"Idk, but I’ve seen multiple ppl say it. They say some bs about it toughening up the younger generations. It’s rlly stupid"
Btreeb,fdjtahy,t1_fdjrpuq,Weird. I think it works counterproductive. The people I know who have been bullied in the past don't seem to have become a 'better' human because of that. They're often more in the background in certain situations.
Ate02muc,fdjtjae,t1_fdjtahy,I agree
AddictivePotential,fdisgvf,t3_elac0i,"You're awesome. It might not change them, but it does change what they'll do in public. Just knowing that something isn't socially acceptable goes a long way in deterring the behavior, even if they're still dumb little shits at heart."

I used to do this frequently growing up when I was maybe in like... 6th grade or so. That's when I realized how shitty people can actually be, and I'd rather be the one with compassion who can stick up for those who can't.

classicfilmfan,fdiluc9,t1_fdhlzp8,"I also think, however that one of the reasons that people fail to stick up for somebody who's the victim of bullying of any kind, be it physical or psychological, is because they're afraid that they'll either become outcasts, or be bullied themselves.  It's really too bad.  In our society, because of that, it's also necessary for the victims of bullying of any kind to stick up for themselves, in order to maintain their dignity.  People who are victims should **not** take the humiliation."

Edit: WOW this blew up! Thank you so much everyone for the warm support. We are currently petting her, and we'll be there until the end. Your words have helped us a lot and we're really grateful!

Edit 2: a lot of you asked, here is a picture of Miss Teigne (french name for Miss Norris in Harry Potter) :) thanks again for the support! https://imgur.com/pSGXccq"
OpheliaTen,fe4o58w,t3_ensavu,"I'm so sorry to hear that. You should take comfort in knowing that you are doing the best for her and that it's the right time. I know that doesn't make it any easier, but you've given her a fantastic, long life and a dignified end.
I think the clay paw print is a fantastic idea. That's something I would definitely like to do for my cats when it's time.
I would also recommend if you can take a few days off work, that might be a good idea. She's a member of your family and you'll need time to grieve her passing."
chloecaribou,fe4ouzn,t1_fe4o58w,"Thank you, you're awfully nice! I know it's for the best, I don't think she's enjoying life as much as a couple weeks ago."
Oldman6868,fe61zc5,t1_fe4ouzn,"Our cat just turned 18 and I am starting to dread the day that's coming. I know it's for the best but my human selfishness doesn't want to her to go . So far she seems fine, a bit slower now days but tomorrow or next week or years it's coming. 
Sorry for your situation and I will try and not think sad but think how much pleasure pets bring us. Take care guys. : )"
marsglow,fe68zen,t1_fe4ouzn,"This is a sad time, but you have given her so much love.  If you can, please stay with her when she goes to sleep.  That way she’ll feel safe and so loved.  And you’ll feel better, seeing her drift away.  You’ll see her again one day.  Go easy on yourself and take time to grieve."
AshNics6214,fe64oe1,t1_fe4ouzn,So sorry love. It’s so hard to see our fur babies in pain. You’re doing the best thing for her. Love and hugs to you.
LittleMissListless,fe6bzoz,t1_fe4ouzn,When my dog passed away this September one of my biggest regrets was not taking a paw print. I was so emotionally devastated... I just didn't have it in me to do it. I highly recommend doing some type of memory activity like that with your beautiful cat. (It makes the mourning process a little bit easier I think.) Give lots of snuggles and have as wonderful of a night and morning together as you can.
JustMeLurkingAround-,fe4q8qe,t3_ensavu,"I'm very sorry! It's been years since we had to put our cat down at age 22, but I still miss her!  She was in a similar state than you mentioned in the comments about your cat. Just be there for her and keep her comfortable till it's time.

Some vets do come to your house for these things. Just mentioning it, because I think it was really good for my cat in that state, not to be put through that stress getting her to the vet and also spending her last moments in a familiar and comfortable place. But our cat also was really freaked by every vet visit and you normally had to force her into the carrier."
chloecaribou,fe4r74g,t1_fe4q8qe,"Sorry about your cat. She had a long life, you were lucky. We're happy to have had ours 16 years, she was really well until the end. 

Thank you for writing me!"
IKillGrizz,fe5a02w,t1_fe4q8qe,Your cat was the same age as me... *WOW.*
HirizaKyo,fe4x7zb,t3_ensavu,"Just know you're doing the right thing. If your little kitty isnt thriving and doesn't have a good quality of life, it's best to ease the suffering. 

It's been almost two years from an extremely traumatic situation with my cat that I had to have euthanized and I feel the pain you're going through. Everyone will grieve differently, but go with what your heart wants and make sure your kitty knows just how much you love and appreciated all the love and laughter they gave you. 

You were a fantastic pet parent and take full advantage of the time you have left. You'll appreciate it and it'll make letting go a little bit easier. 

I'm so sorry you have to go through something like this."
chloecaribou,fe506ew,t1_fe4x7zb,"Thank you, it's very kind! I hope you're doing well!"
HirizaKyo,fe513wh,t1_fe506ew,"Oh goodness no I'm still a mess but that's how I know the love was real. 

I only hope you allow yourself to be down for a while and slowly live with the happy memories and celebrate the life they had. 

Everything's gonna be alright, OP. I promise."

IKillGrizz,fe59abv,t3_ensavu,"No such thing as coincidence, but today my SO sent me a ""Memory"" from 3 years ago over Snapchat. It was a video of me playing with her German Shepherd who died young, 7yrs old, from some type of blood cancer. My eyes started to well up and I realized that it was because I was so happy to have met that big rowdy boy and have brought happiness to his simple dogg-o life while he brought happiness to mine.

I followed up with a message to my SO saying how these memories mean so much because they make you remember how great it was to have a pet be apart of that chapter in your life and that we should appreciate everything and everyone we have because nothing lasts forever.

The point? When the moment comes, the emotions will be heartbreaking yet beautiful, all the memories will flash through your head and every moment of happiness will just take over and for that moment, that rare **RARE** moment, the sadness of end and the happiness of the life-long friendship clash like an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object. This is going to sound cheesy but that is the power of love. It might sound crazy, but appreciate that moment. Appreciate the life, the time, & the kitty that has been there for when you needed her. The bond, the friendship, the love. That is why something that is so sad is also so loving. Because you're choosing to do this for her.

Good luck tomorrow & sorry for the super emotional post. After watching the video my SO sent me today, this hit pretty close to home."
chloecaribou,fe5ax7u,t1_fe59abv,Thank you for sharing your story. It really was a true friendship!
charisma2006,fe6nkvd,t1_fe59abv,"This is so well said. I had to say goodbye to two of my dogs within two years of each other. I consider it an honor to be there for them. My friend said to me: “the most important gift you can ever give them is that final peace.” It’s so true. Yes, all the other moments in their life with them are all important too, but how we treat them at their most vulnerable is the most important. 

And only we, the ones they are entrusted to when their end comes, can give them that gift. I see it now as a gift, and that has helped me tremendously. 

I love your post. Thank you for sharing it."
anonymousforever,fe5f2z0,t1_fe5ax7u,"Just remember that what you do for your kitty friend tomorrow is done out of love and as payback for years of selfless devotion from them. You're setting them free from a body that's failing them, giving them the ultimate gift your love can, the easy peaceful rest they deserve.

I had to do this a few months ago, and could only be there over the phone. Still hurts, but it gets easier with time."
Diplodocus114,fe5uqiy,t1_fe5f2z0,"Same here with my dog -  said goodbye to her on speakerphone and told her ""mummy loves you"". Know she heard me as got an answering whine."
Pengaween,fe4gx7i,t3_ensavu,"I'm sorry.  Maybe you can take a clipping of her hair or put put her paw in clay or in paint to keep that.  Or ask if the vet does it, mine does the clay prints.  I got some clear christmas tree ornaments.  I took the tops off, snipped some hair off each cat, and now I'm filling each ornament with hair from a different cat."
chloecaribou,fe4i5vw,t1_fe4gx7i,"I'll definitely ask for the clay print. I hope the vet does it, I live far from a big city. I do have a lot of pictures from those 16 and a half years though, I'm going to print some."
Cabalagent1,fe5s5tw,t1_fe4i5vw,"We've had a number of cats over the years and all have been very dear to us. My wife always requests a lock of fur and an ink paw print from the vet, and then makes a display with those and their favorite toys and pictures, which gets hung up in the cat room (our cats have their own room).

My wife took the death of her favorite cat particularly badly. Maybe it was because he died in her lap instead of being euthanized, and the process of dying wasn't particularly peaceful. She was out of sorts when we took the cat to the vet to be cremated, but I remembered to ask for a lock of fur and a law print. We had a lot of pictures of that cat, so I had ordered a stuffed plush cat that was made up to look like him. It was realistic enough that the other cats were very wary of it."
thedesertnomad,fe4xln3,t1_fe4i5vw,"Pet stores often sell clay specifically for paw prints, so you could just buy that and bring it with you in case they don't offer that. You can carve the cat's name in it and then bake it at home (some vets do all that for you)."
anonymousforever,fe5eg0l,t1_fe4i5vw,you can also get an ink stamp pad or some paint and do a paint or ink pawprint or two as well. just another idea.
clg75,fe5nt2w,t1_fe4i5vw,"You can make your own foot imprint.  Google salt dough.  It only uses aalt, flour and water.  I do this with my cats."
Neko-Rai,fe5lts3,t1_fe5eg0l,"Good idea, they sell ones for babies that they hand (or in this case paw) doesn’t get ink on it. It’s ink on the side that touches the paper and plastic on the other. I’ve tried it with my kitties, but they move around a lot when trying to hold them and their paw so I’m practicing."
randye,fe570sh,t3_ensavu,"One of the hardest things about this is knowing that she's here now and won't be tomorrow because of a decision you made. It's an extremely selfless decision though, and you're being a fantastic pet owner. This really sucks to go through, and I hate it for you, but it means you really care. You have my respect."
cfo6,fe640vx,t1_fe570sh,"We had to go through this yesterday with our nearly-13-year-old dilute calico. And we had to last March with our nearly-13-year-old tuxedo cat. (It's been a rough go.) It is so hard to deliberately end a life, even as you are ending suffering. We have to care more for her than we do for our own aching hearts."
randye,fe68b9o,t1_fe640vx,"In 2017 we had to make that tough decision for a 14 year old extremely beloved cat. She had mouth cancer and could barely eat. Just because a pet doesn't act like they're in pain, doesn't mean they aren't. And it's our responsibility to let them go with dignity."
sewerrat1984,fe4f3iv,t3_ensavu,Do you have anything special planned for the last day?
chloecaribou,fe4fpq4,t1_fe4f3iv,"She's doesn't really move or eat anymore, so it's basically spending time with her and petting her. We're going to make a photo album though when she's gone!"
Wallflowerheart,fe4gep0,t1_fe4fpq4,Make sure to ask the vet about a paw imprint. They'll usually do those.  Then you can frame it or put it in your album.
chloecaribou,fe4gjx1,t1_fe4gep0,"What a great idea, I didn't know those existed. Thank you so much!"
Wallflowerheart,fe5t5pv,t1_fe4gep0,"Also, thanks to whoever gave me silver. :)"
bubbleplumgum,fe57aop,t1_fe4gjx1,"You can even turn her ashes into jewelry or a pendant so you can always have her with you. It’s not for everyone and it’s on the pricey side, but just wanted to let you know that was an option"
pinmissiles,fe5uckj,t1_fe57aop,"There are sellers on Etsy who can make resin jewelry containing pet hair if you're on a budget. I personally prefer the look of those, and you can even make them yourself if you want to go the DIY route. You just need a silicone mold and a little 2-part resin."
Wallflowerheart,fe5syne,t1_fe57aop,"Unfortunately a lot of places do group cremations for animals, but requesting a lock of fur is not out of the question."
Aloftfirmamental,fe60724,t1_fe5syne,I've always been offered the option of group or individual. The place near me even has funeral services with waffles and viewings.
Wallflowerheart,fe90o0k,t1_fe60724,Waffles? Cool.
Aloftfirmamental,fe95uw0,t1_fe90o0k,"Not even sure what I meant to type, I guess wakes."
misstiah,fe5sgue,t3_ensavu,I’m sure my comment will get lost in the others but tomorrow make sure you stay with her until the end. And hearing is one of the last senses to go so keep telling her you love her. The loss of a pet is definitely difficult. Enjoy your remaining time and focus on all the good memories.
chloecaribou,fe5tn85,t1_fe5sgue,"These are good points, thank you. I'll be sure to be there until the end!"
IsntSheNovel,fe661s5,t1_fe5sgue,I put my boy down in September and this was comforting to learn even months later. I held him and told him I loved him so much to the very end. It was devastating and also the only way I would have wanted that moment to be.
charisma2006,fe6nzci,t1_fe661s5,"My chihuahua developed dementia in her last days and was terrified of me. It was absolutely heartbreaking. She bit me on the face and ran across a table when I was needing to hold her (she had seizures and needed to give her medicine). I wrapped her in a blanket to get her to the vet but couldn’t really pet her because she would bite my hand. It was awful but she didn’t know where she was anymore. When they gave her the final injection I just held her without the blanket for a while because I didn’t get to before, since she was so scared. 

I wouldn’t trade those moments for anything."
password-is-taco_,fe4tnka,t3_ensavu,"I'm so sorry. It's very difficult and my words won't mean much, but I agree with what someone else wrote: get a print of her paw. I'm going to do the same for mine when the time comes, maybe with an ink pad, so I can get it tattooed on my wrist or over my heart. 

Sing or play your sweet lady a comforting song and hold her close; she can't be with you physically forever, but she'll always have a home in your heart. Sending hugs to all three of you 💚"
chloecaribou,fe4vou2,t1_fe4tnka,"Thank you, it means a lot! I'm doing that right now :)"
DocMelock,fe57plr,t3_ensavu,I'm surprised I didnt see anyone ask this but can we see a picture of the kitty?
chloecaribou,fe61gfj,t1_fe57plr,I added one in the original post! I hope you like her!
basit1218,fe7u36d,t1_fe61gfj,Just crying here reading all these stories. My cat is only 8 years old and I am already afraid of losing him one day.
thefourblackbars,fe5ygli,t3_ensavu,"My 14 year old pup passed away 1/1/2020. She was sick for a while too but didn't really show it. Doc gave her 4 months, I decided to let her go 1/1/2020.

We were best friends for 11 years. She traveled with me and lived with me through two different countries. 

She was a shelter dog. When I found her, she was one of the last dogs in the shelter. The shelter was forced to close down because it was illegal. Nobody wanted her because she was so scared. The shelter lady put her into my arms and she melted into my chest. She was an amazingly loyal and complete dog. Her transformation over her life was incredible. She became confident and calm, and everyone and every animal who met her loved her. She was absolutely the best. 

I took her out of suffering and I would never allow her to go back into suffering. She passed away peacefully with me by her side.

The hardest part was the build up to having her euthanized. After this, it was a huge relief. I never regretted what I did. I made the absolute right choice and she would thank me for it. She was a beautiful friend and deserved to pass away pain free.

What you are doing is brave. It's also in the best interest for your cat, which is what you and she would want.

Take care, rejoice in what you gained, not what you lost.

If you need to chat, PM me."
chloecaribou,fe5zfyb,t1_fe5ygli,"What a great story, thank you for sharing it. I also think it's going to be easier when she's gone... No more suffering for her, and we won't be unable to help her anymore. Thank you kind stranger."
thefourblackbars,fe6dysx,t1_fe5zfyb,"Honestly, writing that brought tears to my eyes, but I still know she's at peace and that makes me comfortable. 

It's not easy but you'll get through this. I promise you. 

After this is all over, make a donation to a rescue shelter, plant a tree, or do something good in her name. I stopped eating meat for a month out of respect."
Velkyden,fe5h1ke,t3_ensavu,"My girlfriend and I just had our cat of 6 years put to sleep last week. It all happened so fast, he had intestinal cancer with secondary IMHA.

They were able to get him feeling a little better so we were able to shower him love and treats and let him go on a good note while he wasn’t feeling so bad.

You should feel proud and happy that you were able to give your pet such a long and loving life. I guarantee they are going out happy and feeling loved.

It’s a very hard decision to make, letting a pet go. But making the decision shows how much you care. 

You’re a great and caring pet owner."
chloecaribou,fe5r47g,t1_fe5h1ke,"I'm sorry for your cat, you were a great owner too.  Thank you for your message"

diceshow7,fe5tiim,t3_ensavu,"You are not alone. I just went through this and still find myself crying on my way into work. Then I have to sit in my car for a good 10 minutes and suck it up until it looks like I haven't been crying before I go in to punch the clock.

I got her in '99. Bill Clinton was still in office, Rage Against The Machine was still together, Limp Bizkit was atop the billboard charts with their second album, and Family Guy had just wrapped up their first season. She was my baby. My mother, who gave me the cat when it's mama had an unexpected litter of kittens, even made sure to remind me ""Okay, now, you're her surrogate father. Be a good dad."" I was 22.

It was kidney failure/ renal disease that got her. The vet warned me that she was developing symptoms about 4 years ago, so I changed up her diet a bit and paid special attention to her litter box routines. UTI's got a little more common each year and we'd knock them out with antibiotics. She was otherwise perfectly healthy. And beautiful. Her coat of fur was amazing. People would look at her and think I was lying when I said she was 20 years old.

I'd previously stated I wasn't gonna put her down, no matter what. I mean she looked like she could make it to 30, seriously. But in a quick 5 days she went downhill fast. Stopped eating, ignored her water bowl, became reclusive, etc. She was even having trouble walking. I cried off and on for 5 days as I struggled with the idea of having to let go, but it was obvious I was gonna have to. She made it to Dec 18, a week away from Christmas. She was 3 months shy of turning 21.

I'm 43, single, unmarried, no kids. She'd been my child. I ain't gonna have any kids. I live in a bachelor pad/party type setting with 3 other dudes and she was the lady of the house. Regal, bratty, and consistently indifferent. It is fucking amazing how empty this place suddenly feels. Like, I don't even wanna live here anymore. I trudge through the house late at night with no real purpose or direction. Drunk, sober, high, or just bored; I am the loneliest dude on the planet Earth right now.

Take solace in the fact that you have someone at your side. Hug each other, cry it out, and wipe each other's tears. And know you gave an animal a great life. These bonds are peculiar and totally amazing, even in death. 

Hang in there.

Edit: spelling, because my dumbass is crying again."
chloecaribou,fe5u89d,t1_fe5tiim,"Thank you for your message. It's honestly been the same for me, except I got her when I was 10. I actually chose her in hay at a barn we went to. 

She also became very sick in a short time, so it's been though for about 2 weeks. We took the decision yesterday when she had some kind of indigestion. 

I'm sure you'll find another friend to help you, until then, you have wonderful memories of your cat. Hang in there my friend. And when you're ready, you can start by just looking at cats in shelters... When you find the next one, you'll know!"

diceshow7,fec5b4c,t1_fe5yad5,"I'm guessing your life is as empty as mine if you feel moved to make statements like that.

Hope it gets better, bro."
Frungy,fe5oldt,t3_ensavu,Tell me a nice memory/story about your kitty please?
chloecaribou,fe5rfui,t1_fe5oldt,She used to jump into the bath when we would throw things in there and bring them back. She's awesome!
Diplodocus114,fe5uwhe,t1_fe5rfui,Please do share a pic.
speedysoprano,fe5g0d4,t3_ensavu,"She's been lucky to have you, someone who has loved her for so long and who wants the best for her. Better to end her suffering than keep her around for your own purposes. I'm so sorry for your loss, but your cat and you were lucky to have each other. I hope you'll find solace in your memories of her. May she have a safe, peaceful passage over the rainbow bridge. ♥️🌈"
chloecaribou,fe5lph3,t1_fe5g0d4,Thank you kind stranger!
harry_1111,fe5kxnm,t3_ensavu,Just keep in mind the long happy life she had. It’s best case scenario
nymphormaniac,fe5ptgb,t3_ensavu,"Had to put my baby girl down at 17, her birthday was two days before mine. But fortunately for her, she passed silently after my mother slept. We cremated her, which was substantially more expensive but we will always remember she was a high class gal."
chloecaribou,fe5s0sf,t1_fe5ptgb,Lucky for her. I've been hoping it happens tonight for her... I just don't want her to suffer anymore.
nymphormaniac,fe5tgk0,t1_fe5s0sf,"Yes, they can tell when it is time and it hurts just like losing any other part of your family. I suggest you get her a nice can of salmon and snuggle for the last time. Sending love xx"
TheSOB88,fe5z1tx,t3_ensavu,My friend just put down his cat today too. Sad days

nancam9,fe4vocc,t3_ensavu,"Aw, very sad. Focus on all  the good times.

I've been through this a few times. It doesn't get easier. My current cats (2) won't let me hug them but I wish I could."
chloecaribou,fe4vucp,t1_fe4vocc,It really doesn't get easier... But it's part of life. Thank you for your kind words!
nancam9,fe4yb6x,t1_fe4vucp,"When I had to put my last cat down (and dog) my SO and I both said we should wait a good while before getting another pet.

That lasted about 3 weeks. Pets are too important to us to go long without.

It's ok to mourn, to grieve. They occupy that part of our lives."
chloecaribou,fe50mwj,t1_fe4yb6x,So true! We were wondering how much time it's going to take until the next one... I have to say it's a small beacon of light for the future.
anonymousforever,fe5enbf,t1_fe50mwj,"I like to think they send a message out to the cosmos that their person needs another friend, and that another gets the message. How else does that one at the shelter just reach out and latch onto you and insist that you in particular pay attention to them, when they snub other people?"
nancam9,fe53onn,t1_fe50mwj,"Hard to say. Everyone is different.

You'll know when it is right. No regrets getting another pet. Ever.

Even the current cats who are ... aloof at best."
EllisJacks0n,fe5g2b2,t3_ensavu,"Im sorry for you, i am yet to experience this for my self.
I imagine it's horrible since a pet is with you for so long them but it just goes.
But you shouldn't be too sad about it because call me depressing but death always happens and you need a good life and if your cat had a good life then you should be proud of being such a good owner."
chloecaribou,fe5mxy9,t1_fe5g2b2,"You're right, it is a part of life! I'm not really spiritual, but I'm hoping she'll feel better when it's over."

rararaknee,fe5lr6m,t3_ensavu,Good on you for being so close to her and giving her a treasured 16 years. ✌🏼
chloecaribou,fe5ml99,t1_fe5lr6m,Thanks! I had her when I was pretty young... A lot of good memories are coming back.
Neko-Rai,fe5m1h0,t3_ensavu,"I’m so sorry you’re going through this. It’s such a hard decision to make! My 16 year old has been ill and I’m not sure how much time we have left. As I’m doing for mine, keep your baby comfortable and give all the loves you can. My thoughts are with you."
chloecaribou,fe5n4u6,t1_fe5m1h0,I hope yours will be getting better! They are wonderful friends. Thank you for your kind words.
helloyousexythink,fe5mgd5,t3_ensavu,"My kitty had liver cancer at 16. I know how you feel. Its the worst feeling. Just know you gave her a really wonderful life, and make sure that her last day is the most perfect happy day. Make her feel like everything is happy and okay, no sadness. Make sure the last thing she sees is your loving happy face. Its not going to stop hurting, you will miss her so much, but know your love made her life so incredible."
chloecaribou,fe5r73n,t1_fe5mgd5,"It was a perfect day. She slept, ate a little bit of tuna and we pet her a lot!"
mscocobongo,fe5newb,t3_ensavu,"I'm so sorry. When I put down our English Bulldog I just cried throughout the entire thing. Luckily are only a couple blocks from our vet but if your vet doesn't travel please take a moral support driver. Once again, I'm so sorry."

Catholictwinmom,fe5ambb,t3_ensavu,I am so sorry.  I have been there.  I had my almost 18 year old kitty put down almost 2 years ago.  She had such severe arthritis in her hips and hind quarters and she couldn't even sit properly.  It was obvious that she was in constant pain and I couldn't stand to see her suffering.  Hugs!
atreyuno,fe5n1rj,t3_ensavu,An honor for us that they spend they're loves with us. An honor for them to be loved and cared for like family.
Terrible_Ex-Joviot,fe5pbpi,t3_ensavu,"I'm so sorry. I know how this feels. My cat died in september. He was 14 years old and sick, maybe since his birth. But we only knew about this a year before, and it exactly explained his strange behaviour. I was 10 when we got him and the day he died was the 3rd day in my first real job. It felt like he took my whole youth with his death. I miss him now. Though we got a new cat and she is so lovely, i don't think i could handle losing her. Its our 3rd cat."
chloecaribou,fe5rkd3,t1_fe5pbpi,I'm sorry about your cat. Have fun with the new one!
GeronimoTheCat,fe5pg0w,t3_ensavu,Sorry to hear. They really are great friends. Sounds like the little one had a good home. Good on ya. Hang in there.
unclescary666,fe5qv83,t3_ensavu,Very sorry for your pain. I'm sure kitty will understand. Be there and with him when it's done. It will ease his mind and make his journey easier.
MiniMcArthur,fe5qw25,t3_ensavu,"I'm really sorry to hear! When I went through the same thing with my cat, it was awful thinking of the idea that such an important member of the family simply won't be around anymore. The only thing that made me feel better is the fact that it was the exact opposite for the pet - You were around when she was growing up, when she was sick, to cuddle up to to get warm and now when she is leaving this world. I hope you know that you gave her the best and most comfortable life any pet could ask for and she likely looks up to you in more ways than you could know.

The vet that put my cat to sleep was nice enough to give us a clay imprint of her paw as well as her ashes to keep. I would highly recommend getting some physical memorabilia to help you feel better, too! Sorry, OP."
chloecaribou,fe5s9bz,t1_fe5qw25,Thank you very much!
HobansLeaf,fe5t82o,t3_ensavu,"Oh Op, I'm so sorry. From your comments it's SO obvious how much you love her and that makes my heart as glad for her as it is sad for you. Enjoy your remaining time and thank you for the life you've shared with her. <3"
chloecaribou,fe5trnr,t1_fe5t82o,Thanks for your kind words! It means a lot :)
jazjanner,fe612n2,t3_ensavu,Just adding my sympathies and thankful for all the genuine compassion on Reddit.  It really helps when you are grieving a beloved pet.  Take care of your heart and grieve the way you need to.  We all understand and gently support you.

smartdatacharts,fe61tnl,t3_ensavu,"I can't imagine how your feeling, so sorry for your lost... Through the hard times cherish the best memories you have had with your cat over the years; Maybe think about getting a pendant created with your cat picture engraved in for a necklace, you can always have."
LoMatte,fe624d5,t3_ensavu,"I'm so sorry for you. It's really hard to step up and take on that kind of responsibility when you love your pet but it's something we must all take sooner or later. Based on your description of her health you are definitely doing the right thing but even knowing that doesn't help you feel better about your loss. You're right to spend your time together today, that will help a lot and is far better than just waiting for something to happen. 

We went through this with our 19 yr old boy a few months ago and it was the 4th time in my adult life I've had to make that decision. I have an 11 year old cat now so I'll be doing this at least one more time."
chloecaribou,fe62ehz,t1_fe624d5,"Thank you. It is a really difficult decision, but I'm getting more sure that it is the right one. Cherish your cat while it is well!"

FroggyWatcher,fe6brxx,t3_ensavu,"I am so sorry. My family has three cats and they're on the older side (14 or so I reckon). I get a knot on my throat just thinking of coming back from abroad and not having my cat annoying me to give her a piece of ham when I am making myself a melt, or gently patting me on the face or arms to wake me up at 6am to go give her some food. She's a spoiled little thing but also the sweetest and I love her to no end. I cannot possibly fathom how hard it must be for you. Much love from another cat person, your decision was for the best. I don't know if this is the kind of thing you wouldn't want to hear but it's heartfelt aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand now I'm crying."

dee935,fe5u1yj,t3_ensavu,"I had to put my cat down in June, 2017. He was only 8, turning 9 in August but wouldn't have made it. 
He had PKD since birth. We started noticing him losing weight, getting dehydrated very easily. We took him to the vets 2 days before and they gave him an injection, which did help make him more alert and more himself, but by the afternoon he was slowing down again. The vets said a blood transfusion wouldn't have worked. My family and I made the decision to spend one last day with him and the following day, put him to sleep. 

Some context, I've been heartbroken before because of shit like being dumped, but that day was one, where I really experienced heartbreak. 

It's been 2 and half years now since that day, and it does get better, but you have days where you are grieving. That never goes away. But I always think about how we gave him the best life and loved him unconditionally. 

You gave your girl a great life and she will always be apart of you no matter what. In your heart, you will know what is best for her 💙"
chloecaribou,fe5ux8l,t1_fe5u1yj,Thank you so much. You seem to love her a lot even now <3

millystarrysky,fe5v0q8,t3_ensavu,"It's been two years since I had to put my Smokey to rest which remains the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

Here is a little fact about putting pets to sleep I wish I knew ahead of time but hiding it in case you don't want to see it: >!Some pets throw up from the meds which isn't as peaceful as I felt it's portrayed, I still feel it was for the best but it was a bit traumatising for me!<

I am forever grateful my girl didn't fuss when I picked her up like she normally did so I knew it was the right thing.  I hope your dear Kitty gives you a similar clue."
chloecaribou,fe5vvld,t1_fe5v0q8,Oh thank you that's actually good to know.

rosesarebloomin,fe68zo4,t3_ensavu,"I had to put one of my dogs down last February (we called her V), she was on all different types of medication and had had her third stroke that year, she could barely keep her head up and even though she was a fighter she seemed to really be struggling. My family made sure to give her the best last day and I even chose to stay in the room with her while it happened because I didn't want her to be alone. I had read that if you have another dog (or just animal) it's good to bring them along as part of the closure since pets can get depressed too. We did let my other dog come along and say goodbye but I didn't make him stay in the room, I personally think that it was good. My dog that's still alive was having a hard time being alone the first week (although he did really love the new attention) and I  think he felt relief since he kind of took care of V in her final months (letting her eat his food, guiding her to the water bowl or on walks). He now seems to have ajusted now and doesn't sit in front of the French windows looking into the backyard for her. We cremated her but my dad stole the ashes and hoarded them somewhere (he has a room that looks like straight out of the tv show, I'm just waiting for him to pass so I can finally clean it and then I can spread her ashes at her favorite park) and so my mom saved the little pink sweater V would wear in the winter and I took her favorite and only toy (she was the pickiest when it came to toys)."
crisstiena,fe6a1jd,t3_ensavu,What a beautiful cat. We said goodbye to our almost twenty years old cat on NY eve.  She didn’t make it to the vet appointment and sadly died in my arms as I was carrying her downstairs. We are all heartbroken. There’s a cat sized hole in our lives that can never be filled. I am so sorry for your loss. 🌈💕
Rosebud174,fe6a550,t3_ensavu,Your cat is so beautiful. I'm sorry you are going to have to say goodbye to her. It sounds like you gave her such a great life and home.
fancychxn,fe6bbg2,t3_ensavu,"I hope the vet will allow you to be present when they administer the IVs. I held my 19 year old cat in my arms as she passed. After doing so, I realize it simply should not happen any other way. 

Also having a plan for the remains. We hadn't thought about it and had to scramble to find a pet crematorium since there's nowhere to dig in our yard. But now I have her ashes and a clay paw print to hold onto.

I'm very sorry for your loss. She looks like such a sweet kitty and must've lived a long, happy, beautiful life."
Fixerr59,fe6bo8d,t1_fe6bbg2,We've had 3 dogs cross the rainbow bridge in the last 2 years. The vets always asked about the remains before doing anything. Odd that your vet didn't.
fancychxn,fe6bxe4,t1_fe6bo8d,"Actually now that I think about it, they did. I think they offered to do the cremation, but we were thinking we'd bury her. It was also done in our home, so we just said no we'll keep her here until we decide."
mweinbender,fe6blwf,t3_ensavu,I know the feeling!  I had to put my 12 year old calico named Maggie down last year and it was so hard...but we know it's the right thing.   Enjoy your moments and cherish your memories.   :)

ju0725,fe6h5lw,t3_ensavu,I lost my 14 year old cat last year and it caused a YEAR flare with my autoimmune disease! I know the pain of losing a furry friend. Sending lots of love.
KyleeAsh,fe6hf50,t3_ensavu,"We had to say goodbye to our 12-year old dog a few days ago. She was our first dog and we had to make the decision as a family to put her down. She was also sick and it got to the point that she wasn’t able to do a bowel movement properly. 


The day came sooner than we expected, but we all got to spend time with her, took her paw prints, saved some of her hair, etc.


It was a hard day, but I’m grateful she’s not in pain anymore. When you feel sad, just know you’re not alone. I find that it helps me to talk to her, even though she isn’t physically here. I know she can hear me, and I know she’s happy.


She even visited me in a dream last night (which I told her she could do), and it was nice to see her."
d_tas,fe6hmsl,t3_ensavu,I'm so sorry. She was lucky to have someone who loved her this much
BalladOfBoydCrowder,fe6hucq,t3_ensavu,My most sincere condolences 😢
wendypendy66,fe6hxqg,t3_ensavu,So sorry.  Losing a pet is awful.  Thinking of you!  Hugs!
paShULka,fe6i7lg,t3_ensavu,My cat lived until 23 then we go to veterinar to kill him because he was really bad and ill.
TrailerTrashQueen,fe6j9ou,t3_ensavu,she’s so beautiful. i’m glad you’ll be with her and she will know she’s loved. sending you internet hugs ❤️
Addy_Bishop,fe6jdie,t3_ensavu,"Hello friend.  Maybe I can brighten your day with something unrelated? 

Every year the Curiosity rover plays “Happy Birthday” to itself making “Happy Birthday” the first song and Curiosity the first device used to play music on a foreign planet.

Also through studies we have learned several important things about rats:
-they are ticklish
-they have been trained to drive tiny cars to get fruit loops
-they can learn to play hide and seek
-they giggle when they play hide and seek

I can also share random facts about all sorts of stuff if you tell me a topic or interest :D"
KIR4HV1,fe6jv0j,t3_ensavu,Ah man. My cat has to go to the vet tomorrow. She has been coughing pretty badly for a few weeks now. We'll see how it goes.
Little_Lucifer_,fe6jz5f,t3_ensavu,"No matter how hard it is, make sure you're right there next to her as she's getting injected and as she  passes; I couldn't imagine being left alone by my loved ones when I die."
yepbutnah,fe6kv44,t3_ensavu,:( She looks like a great cat. Can’t imagine what you’re going through. Hope she had a great last day

nw_hippy,fe6mdiw,t3_ensavu,"Something to consider if you can is a mobile vet that will come to you. My ex wife did that when one of our cats died and it was so nice having it happen there in the house instead of in a vet's office. The other cat got to take part in it and I swear there was a moment when she thanked the vet. 

I will always try to find someone to come to me for this type of service since I believe it's easier on the cat and any other cats or animals you might have.

I really wish you all a wonderful last day. :)"
Antebios,fe6mgia,t3_ensavu,"I want to point out what others have said: you can have someone come to your house instead.  We've had to put precious fur babies to sleep at the vet and hated that it was loud and a scary location for them.  The last one was done ate home by a loving caring doctor and our cat was surrounded by loving family and at home in peace and quiet.  We held him in our arms the whole time kissing him and crying.  It was sad but also loving knowing we did all we could and made sure he left in peace.  I would highly recommend this method to anyone. It wasn't that expensive.

The doctor also can also do a paw print there at home."
kittycatdoggydo,fe6mgw0,t3_ensavu,"Does your gorgeous cat like ahi tuna? I lost technically my mom’s cat but he and I were like brother and sister. He sat on my pregnant belly with my first as a kitten. We were bros. Anyway, his last meals were ahi tuna seared. He loved that. Treat your gorgeous kitty. My heart goes out to you."
max_caulfield_,fe6n49w,t3_ensavu,"Our family had to put down our 19 year old cat last September. I'm still pretty sad about it even now, he was the best pet I've ever had and I miss him dearly. But I'm also happy I got to know and grow up with him, as you did with Miss Teigne, and make so many amazing memories. Good luck with everything and thank you for giving your cat a wonderful, happy life"
Vincent_dat_boi,fe6q8q8,t3_ensavu,Nooooooooooooo I know it’s for the best to put her to rest but noooooooooooooooooooo
Terminator7786,fe6qjum,t3_ensavu,"I'm in the same spot as you are, just yesterday I had to put down one of my dogs, she was nine years old and had the biggest heart, always wanted to be in your lap and the center of attention, out of nowhere though, her kidneys rapidly failed over the course of a day and a half. She barely drank, she didn't respond to my voice, her eyes didn't respond to anything. She just laid still as could be, only movement was breathing and occasional leg twitches. I miss her more than anything, I got both of her front paws inked and her nose as well, I plan on getting a tattoo using those to make a heart shape and have her name and birthdate and death date underneath it"

Altnob,fe6ruh2,t3_ensavu,"Recently received a foster kitten which unfortunately had pneumonia only it wasnt just pneumonia. She was misdiagnosed with a URI and went a weak without proper pneumonia treatment.

She was hospitalized for 11 days but I brought her home today. Shes not out of the woods and still receiving nebulizing 3x a day. I spent a tremendous about of money to save her and I am praying to everything that I can give her 16 years of a good loving life like you did with your sweet baby angel."
peety2269,fe6s08i,t3_ensavu,"Just be with her and give her comfort while you can, as many scratches as you possibly can and remember the fun times you had together. If shes not moving too much remember to give her a towel or something to sit on (also to soak up pee in case she can't make it to litter box). Also, if shes not blinking her eyes a lot you can give her eye drops for comfort/moisture."
thickdaddy30van,fe6s8oy,t3_ensavu,"I am really sorry to hear this, do you have access the CBD tinctures in your area? They may provide a way to bring back enjoyment into her life...

Mitch23m,fe6tf97,t3_ensavu,Bye kitty. You did a good job being a good cat. I’m sure you got a few pets in return. Well done. Say hi to my kitty up in cat heaven
kingshez123,fe6tl4y,t3_ensavu,I'm sorry to hear this. I've a 1 year cat he means world to me. Whenever i feel sad i go and cuddle my cat. He relieves my sadness away. The thought of him leaving one day tears me up. Love and strength to you through this difficult time.
Alkatreezy,fe76y5g,t3_ensavu,"It's really sad, to let go a family member. But sometimes it's better for them to be euthanized. I know that I will get the shit storm of the century after posting this, but in some cases it should be legal to do this favor to a human being. Because it's never nice to suffer from a painful sickness like f..king cancer for example. 
So peeps, if you have the chance to relieve your beloved pets from a painful sickness which can't be cured, just do it. 
Because for myself I'd rather be dead, than im never ending, intense pain"
MosquitoClarinet,fe7afff,t3_ensavu,"I know I'm kinda late to this and you might've already said goodbye to your cat. Our cat's 15 and she's getting to that point. Was diagnosed with heart failure 8 months ago with the expectation that she had maybe a few months to live if she was lucky, she's somehow stuck around this long, but any day now she could stop responding to the meds. I'm leaving home for university next month, so either she dies before then and I have to say goodbye, or she dies after then and I have to leave home knowing I'll never see her again. I've been dreading this since I was a little kid.

Don't really know why I'm saying all this. I guess I saw your post and needed a good cry. 16 years is a good life for a cat, and by the sounds of it your girl is well loved (and absolutely gorgeous). That's the best she could've asked for."
seesaw9843,fe7dt2t,t3_ensavu,"Wow. This hits really close to home. Just a couple weeks ago, right before Christmas, I had to euthanize my emotional support dog. I’ve been having such a hard time with it. I know I did the right thing, but I still think about her last day a hundred times a day replaying it in my mind. I know I need to stop and be kinder to myself, but it’s almost like I need to feel the pain so I don’t feel like I’m moving on."
weezilgirl,fe7f7a3,t3_ensavu,Sometimes the best thing is the hardest.
Shiggens,fe7iir4,t3_ensavu,"I am sorry for the loss of your beautiful friend, but happy for the 16 happy years you shared.  Pets bring a lot of love and entertainment to our lives."
ferrettimee,fe7jyne,t3_ensavu,She’s so pretty... I’m sure she had a wonderful life and she was extremely lucky to be part of your family. It’s disappointing that these things have to happen but ultimately it is the right thing to do. I hope you and your partner will be okay :)
LorenzoTheChair,fe7qp2d,t3_ensavu,"Same man, mine died today morning. Rest in piece."
andrewcepero,fe844c8,t1_fe7qp2d,Sorry to hear. I hope everything was okay for the cat until the end. RIP.
MurphyDmitry,fe7s152,t3_ensavu,I'm begging you not to do that. She could still recover!
Darentei,fe7x1ol,t3_ensavu,"I feel for you. I didn't get to say the final goodbye to my 15 year old cat, the only I had that made it that far. I do regret it, but I know she felt safe in her last moments.

Well, as fate would have it, last winter I had another cat who suddenly got sick. It came out of nowhere. Okay, maybe not entirely, but hindsight it 20/20. The previous winter to that one, his sibling had run away at 9 months. In October, we moved to a new apartment and two weeks later, we come home to find him with a large bald spot between his shoulders, which we would end up treating for the remainder of his life as it started itching and scabbing over. We still have no clue what happened there, nor what happened later that prompted us to end his suffering. One morning, after my brother had what seemed almost like a prophetic dream, we wake up to find the cat having weird spasms. It passed, but later returned, and eventually he started shaking heavily. Evidently he had suffered some kind of brain nerve damage. We very quickly had to decide if we would even attempt treatment, which could kill him not to mention be very expensive, or let him go. We chose to latter, and it was very hard to do. This was almost exactly one year ago. One thing to note was that he had been an outdoor cat until our last move. I felt really bad about keeping him indoors, as he was visibly depressed because of it. The vet speculated that he had contracted a disease, possibly cat AIDS, after being bitten months prior. We never found out what it really was.

Now we have a new cat, who was raised indoors, and will stay so for at least the coming year or two. I've always taken good care of my cats, and I will continue to do so for as long as I live, because I can't live without kitties in my life."
R3DW0LF3942,fe84aa4,t3_ensavu,"Hey, at least she will pass surrounded by family, and safe and warm."
Warm_metal_revival,fe85h9f,t3_ensavu,"Today’s gonna be rough. Thinking of you, stranger, and your beautiful BFF."
hillbillykim83,fe86x1e,t3_ensavu,I know it is really hard and breaks your heart. I had to have my kitty put to sleep a couple of weeks ago. My vet took ink and copied his footprints for me and clipped a swatch of his fur for me. I chose to stay with him and as bad as I thought it would be it was a comfort knowing I did all I could and he wasn’t suffering anymore.
Dishwhatever,fe88lro,t3_ensavu,I'm so sorry.
Reddit_Novice,fe8bjbs,t3_ensavu,Aw i’m sorry. She looks just like my cat who is turning 4 this year.
Roseamonglilies,fe8efbw,t3_ensavu,"I'm so sorry to hear about that! We had to put our dog down just recently too. It was the first time I went to see a companion be euthanized. It was hard, but I understood it was a better option than to make him suffer any longer. I hope your recovery is smooth, and that you bury her in a special place."
Big____C,fe8fxz3,t3_ensavu,"Last year I had to let go a cat that had been in my home before I was their. He died at 21. Just remember that you gave your cat a great life (or so I hope) and that it’s simply their time to go. Everything dies eventually, but the memory of your pet and your mutual love will always be there."
Drblackcobra,fe8jkgl,t3_ensavu,May your cat be in peace.

PPMachen,fe8qi68,t3_ensavu,I took Rosie to the vet hoping for treatment but knowing it was the end. I stayed with her. She was 15 and a half. We are still in mourning 7 months later
Turtle_Sensei,fe8qom5,t3_ensavu,"Hey, I'm so sorry for your loss. I know how hard this decision is. We had to make the same decision with our 16 year old Lynx Point Siamese last year.

wel_02,fe5h33s,t3_ensavu,Sorry to hear that. I don’t know what your financial situation is but if you don’t mind spending a little more maybe consider getting the vet to put your cat down in your own home that way the cat will be calm and go in a peaceful way.
FancyAdult,fe5xjyh,t3_ensavu,"I’m so sorry.  And I mean this in the most loving way, I think you should write an obituary for your cat. I think it would be sweet and a good way to think of all the wonderful things about your cats life.
   
I spent a year in therapy working through the death of my dog that died in my childhood.  This is something I did and it was great."

sleepycatinatree,fe5v22n,t3_ensavu,"My cat sadly passed away at 13 years old. One day her back legs were paralysed and turned out she had kidney failure. It was so sudden and unexpected, we always took her to the vet for yearly check up. The next day we put her to sleep as her other organs were shutting down very quickly and it was painful for her. The worst part is that I was over 2000km away for work and couldn’t get to her to say my goodbye. We buried her in a large pot plant with pretty flowers, this way we can take her with us if we ever move. 
Please cherish the last moments with your cat ❤️"
chloecaribou,fe5wiay,t1_fe5v22n,Oh I'm so sorry. Thank you <3
Remnant58,fe5vi3s,t3_ensavu,"I’m so sorry. We had to put to sleep our dog of 18 years last February. Really hard day but, like you, we knew it was the right thing for her. I wish you immense peace and comfort through this."
1329Prescott,fe5wpcp,t3_ensavu,"My old man is 15, turns 16 in July, and we have been going through a lot recently with hyperthyroidism and kidney disease. it’s certainly so hard to watch your baby slowly decline. my heart goes out to you and i hope you find peace in knowing you took the best care of him even through the difficult choices."
FuzzyMonkey95,fe63vg6,t3_ensavu,"You are doing what’s best, and you should NEVER doubt that. Your beautiful kitty has lived a fabulous life, and letting her suffer wouldn’t be right. I can’t imagine how hard this is. My old kitty had to be put down, and I remember how hard it was to say goodbye. I was little, so I didn’t bring him to the vet, but I remember saying my last goodbye and I love you. Give your kitty extra snuggles and treats tonight, she will appreciate it! Sending good vibes your way, hang in there!"

Super sorry for your loss, though."
verregnet,en7h4u,top_level,"Our family is full of drama. All the time. Eventually it apparently got to her, and she broke all ties to my mother, and the rest of the family to avoid meeting her again. Yesterday after 8 years she texted me again to meet up and clear things up. 

I don't even know how to handle this.

Edit:
Since people asked for an Update, here goes nothing. And by the way, she is 26.

We greeted each other with a hug, and she went on by offering to go grab some food at a pizzeria nearby, where we could sit down and talk.

Most of the food remained on the plates since we talked a lot about why she came to the decision that staying at home and talking to our mother just wasn't an option for her anymore, and her life is much less stressful than it was ever before when she still had contact with our mother. She also cleared up a few things that my mother has been falsely accusing her of.

Against my will she paid for my food and we left, just chatting and asking questions about how life has been going for the other one. She drove me home after that and offered me her help a couple times, should the family ever turn on me the way they did it to her. I saved her number under a false name on my phone should my mother ever get suspicious and go through it, got out of the car, gave her one final hug and walked home.

Great sister and great human, sadly with a horrible youth."
surwhyvor,fdwizmc,t3_en7h4u,"When I was six my brother left our home and I  met him again 10 years later. He's the ""black sheep"" of my family (there were some legal issues in his past) and I was pretty nervous. It was super awkward when we first saw each other because we weren't really sure what to say. Turns out we are similar af, he is super funny and we get along really well. So since then things changed for the better and I'm so glad I met him again. How was your meeting?"
rubbercunt67,fdvphdi,t3_en7h4u,"Do your best to see things from an aerial point of view. She has valid reasons for doing what she did. It wasn't about you, she waited until it was safe to talk to you. Have low expectations but give her a chance, good luck."
verregnet,fdvqktq,t1_fdvphdi,"I don't blame her for anything, since I have no idea why she did it, and my mom seems to be hiding something, too.. Blindly blaming her would be very ignorant."
xplotosphoenix,fdweffj,t1_fdvphdi,I hate hearing these kind of things. When I was little (9-10 yo) my father and my uncle (his brother) got in an arguement and cut ties. Fast forward to when I was 26 and my uncle came to my wedding and I got to see him for the first time. Never spoke to him again as he passed last year and 20 years after my wedding. I have 3 cousins that I've never met.  Please try to have her in your life. You two shouldn't be punished for your parents mistakes. You have time.

supertrashmeat,fdwogzj,t1_fdvqktq,"I'm glad to hear that. I left the house at 16 because of issues between me and my parents.

hongloumeng,fdxjh9j,t1_fdweffj,"My father and uncle got into some tiff ages ago and they didn't talk for the first 18 years of my life.  Then my uncle got diagnosed with terminal cancer and they decided to reconcile, we all had a bit of time with him before he passed.  Not enough.  It was then that I met my cousins for the first time.  It was super weird, because my uncle's daughter, whose my age, is a straight hotty.  But because I was meeting her for the first time as a grown man, I had not already naturally categorized her in that ""nope -- she's family"" part of my brain where the other attractive cousins go.

After my uncle died, their mom, who wanted nothing to do with our side of the family, turned those cousins against the rest of us (I think).  They rejected my friend request on FB.  I don't take it personally but still, you know... Whatever beef the last generation had doesn't have to be our beef.  We don't have to be besties or anything, it'd just be nice to at least be aware of each other.  Our fathers were fucking brothers, only a year apart."
meebee3,fdyqjkj,t1_fdwogzj,"How did you mend up things with your siblings? Were you in contact with them moving onward after you left?

We lived in different states (AZ/TX) and wouldnt have seen each other much and now I live in DC. My cousins didnt go to their dads funeral and I was hoping to see/meet them there.

nicannkay,fdy201i,t1_fdxxs6q,Idk. We have a family that runs a weed shop in my town and I’m seriously envious of their setup. Everyone is in on it. The youngest brother owns it and older bro and parents are always around helping out. Tbh it’s my dream to be able to work with my family. Not my mom though. She’s a klepto.
Ice_Burn,fdy0cog,t1_fdxxs6q,My sister's husband is a financial planner. He is 100% trustworthy and very good at what he does. My sister is annoyed that I don't use him and I can't make her understand why I won't do business with family under any circumstances.
Francine05,fdzhsyp,t1_fdxxs6q,I had 2 uncles that were estranged even though they worked together at their father's company that they inherited.
ViciousAsparagusFart,fdycu4b,t1_fdxxs6q,"Yeah nah, that’s not always true. they inherited their fathers business. They weren’t gonna just throw away a cash cow because they were brothers. The mishap came a few years down the line."
LyndaCarter_,fe09vpv,t1_fdxxs6q,"> This is literally why you should never, ever, EVER go into business with family.

This is just not true. Sure, there can be challenges, but it's common for people to do this and be very successful at it. It really depends on the individuals involved."

sayleanenlarge,fdzc882,t1_fdy201i,"Yeah, there are family businesses all over the world that work fine. The problem is that businesses go wrong and sometimes those businesses are family ones so it sort of skews the impression of family businesses, but most of them are fine.

I did some graphic design work for her and she wanted so many changes and after the like tenth i said “hey I told you I charge for changes after a certain point and we are well past that point.” Surprise! She got super mad at me and hasn’t spoken to me in like five years! 

Do not! Work with! family!"

samsammies6969,fdvz133,t3_en7h4u,"I spent a few years not talking to my family cause of my parents as well... you’ll probably never really truly know what was going on at the time that drove her to bounce outta there but the good news is now me and everybody in my family are on better terms than we ever were back then, so there is hope. Good luck, it’s great she reached out to you."
Brisbina,fdwjqwb,t1_fdvz133,Yep same here. My dad burnt bridges with his family and it’s only through my mum’s clandestine efforts that we had a relationship with my grandma - dad’s mum. The only way  I saw my cousins were if they happened to be visiting at the same time. My Grandma was ace and taught me loads about life and taught me to believe in myself. So glad my Mum made the effort to keep us connected.
Just-Another-Mom,fe08npj,t1_fdwjqwb,Your mum is a fucking angel and I hope that you tell her that a random internet stranger from across the world thinks so.
Brisbina,fe3ogwl,t1_fe08npj,Thank you so much. She definitely is. I am lucky to have her.
Killershot9,fdvrpg6,t3_en7h4u,Best of luck and hopefully everything goes well!
lovelyb1ch66,fdwsf85,t3_en7h4u,"I hope everything went well. My own family is very splintered, he doesn't talk to her, those two gang up on everybody else, these two haven't talked in years etc, you get the picture. My takeaway is that being family has less to do with genetics and more to do with mutual respect, understanding and acceptance. Best of luck to both of you!"
daisymaisy505,fdw9uyc,t3_en7h4u,Update when you can!! I hope all goes well!
GuzZ-EniX,fdxr0ra,t3_en7h4u,"I actually was the brother who left the house. It was 3 years ago because of extra drama in my family and house all the time too. They used my little brother as an excuse to blame me about anything (he was actually spoiled as fuck) so I just stop talking to him. It may have no sence, but I actually was so fucked up in my head. 
One year ago I cleared things up in my head and texted to my brother again. We met and just remebered our childhood and how our parents refused about us to have even a friendship makind us discuss just because. He's my age when I left and he's going through the same, so I'm just here to help him now that I can.

Hope the best for you two bro!"

sunsetsandstardust,fdxwlh5,t3_en7h4u,"Hey I’m super interested in your story because i’m in the same situation, but from the other side. i cut ties with my mom and by extension sisters, years ago now but i’m dying to get in touch with my sisters but i’m scared how they’ll react. I’d love  to hear how this all goes for you"
verregnet,fdzx4d3,t1_fdxwlh5,"Just updated it. I hope all goes well for you, too."
itsthevoiceman,fdzz3o1,t1_fdxwlh5,"I'm in a similar position as you. I cut ties with my mother, but fortunately, I can have limited (and controlled) contact with my sister via Facebook. We're friendly, but it's unlikely we'll ever be close until SHE cuts ties with my mother, because my mother likes to use anything as possible ammunition.

So, you can try something like social media  where you can still remain somewhat friendly, if that works for you. It can also help make the next step less of a jump when opportunity strikes."
mypancreashatesme78,fe0abyr,t1_fdxwlh5,My half sister and I had cut ties for 12 years or so. I finally contacted her. I'm glad I did. She has some mental health issues and now that I understand them better when she goes on rants I just ignore her and I don't engage. All you can do is try to initiate contact. If they chose not to talk to you at least you did your part. I urge you to at least try.

LazyNashAzome,fdy6px0,t3_en7h4u,"My sister went to America to study ( Im from Eastern Europe) at first we all started talking on skype but after a year or two we stopped talking. In the next 10 years Ive talked to her once (I was 8 at the time she left). My childhood felt without a sister and so I believed I didnt had one. When she came at my doorstep without telling anyone of her return expect my mother, I dropped everything (I wask cooking at the time) and went and hugged her and cried. All the blame of her leaving me went away. Now while she lives in London its far but still a lot closer then Usa. And we communicate more often. Sometimes life becomes complicated and we don't know why we do the things we do. I know she didn't mean to hurt you. Listen her out."
CptnStarkos,fdvvgo6,t3_en7h4u,"Give her a hug!

Its nice for you to come closer again."
achildofthefullmoon,fdwv56l,t3_en7h4u,"I didn't speak to my Dad for about 20+ years... It was actually strange how normal we talked when I decided to see to him again.

It wasn't til I was about 12 or 13 that we were able to see her again, and we haven't been out of touch since (I'm 65 now).  As a side note, I also found out about a half brother and two half sisters that I got in contact with."

Saphazure,fdy00yd,t3_en7h4u,"At the risk of downvotes, when I met my sister at 15 that I last saw at age four we fucked 

Be careful since you weren't raised together there isn't the aroma of a ""relative,"" I forgot the term used to describe this phenomenon, but it's a real thing since they smell like stranger to be attracted to relatives you never see."

Saphazure,fe31jnw,t1_fdy4ycd,"People are downvoting you, but you aren't wrong haha"
sarahrose249,fe01sqp,t1_fdzzwym,How is your relationship now after that?
Paul_Blart_Mall_Fart,fe02hg9,t1_fdzzsk5,"I mean I would’ve been the same in your position ignoring the sister part, but yea that’s even worse than I thought, I was expecting like 24 or something. I won’t judge but it’s still kinda sus on her part and just a bizarre situation overall but I guess shit just happens"

R-ch_l,fdxvo3g,t3_en7h4u,"When I cut my dad and stepmum out of my life because of thier constant drama, I left behind a brother at 9, another brother at 4 and my sister was 10. I still speak to my mum and my little sister who shares the same mum but as the others live with my dad and thier mum (my stepmum) I can't see them. Everyday I feel guilt and miss those kids like crazy, but they are just not old enough to understand and they're not able to form thier own opinions as thier mum is the loud voice for the whole family. This was over a year and a half ago and I cant stand the fact that they see me in the unfair way the parents paint me. Just know your sister probably feels terrible at having to lose those years with you and her contacting you was a huge step and would've been so hard for her. Try and understand she didn't want to lose you but felt she had no choice at the time. It's not too late to have a great relationship. Hope everything turns out well"
Havoc_Unlimited,fdy4h34,t3_en7h4u,"I am going to meet my brother for the first time in about 10 years tomorrow it is a very similar situation to what you described I left the family because my mother is a compulsive liar and a manipulator

cornflake93,fdzw11m,t3_en7h4u,"This made me tear up. 😭 Are you both going to have a friendship..?
Will you be seeing more of her?"
MyronBlayze,fe0fvo9,t3_en7h4u,"Wow,  this is so similar to my younger sister and I- the last time I saw her she was 11 and she would be 17 now as well. It kills me that I can't be a part of her life, but I currently have no way of contacting her and just hope that one day she can reach out and we can meet like you and your sister day. Know your sister loves you a lot,  and agreeing to meet with her probably meant the world to her. I also want to make sure my little sister has an option to get out one day,  and I'll be there when she needs me."
madsjchic,fe1i0l9,t3_en7h4u,I’m glad she got out and was able to still find a way to see you.
DaisyDondu,fe2bxtd,t3_en7h4u,"I had younger siblings reach out to me a few years ago after not seeing them in 6 or so years. It was for the same crap I cut ties off for in the first place. 

Dad was still an aggressive man by the sound of things, and they wanted to know what I knew about it. There'd been another incident. 

Unfortunately, I wasn't sure if dad was putting them up to msging me, didn't know how he decided to raise/deceive them, so gave my brother an option to contact me in future. Got no more  msgs but did not accept their friend requests either.
Have not heard from them since or made contact. 

I love them but  just can't be in their lives."
BookBec,fdxi4cd,t3_en7h4u,"I went through the same thing. 2 sisters left when I was 7 amd came back when I was 17. They were out of our lives within 5 years. The drama never ceased. 

Hope you and your sister can have a better relationship."
quebecoisamanitoba,fdy5vv0,t3_en7h4u,"My two older brothers haven't spoken or seen each other for thirty years because their wives could not get along.  This has been very hard on our mother as she wants peace and harmony in her family.  When Dad died in 2001, neither showed up to the funeral because the other might be there.  Mom was devastated.  I have managed to stay out of the drama and have relations with all parties involved (separately) but I worry most about Mom.  She wants all three of her children to get along."
elfmere,fdy85ke,t3_en7h4u,"My SO's parents split when she was 5-6 and father was never in the picture for many reasons given by her mother. She reconnected with him in her 20's and the reasons never matched up... The mother said he never paid child support and he says he has receipts for all of it. The only advice I could give her, which might not be the best was, to believe both of Thier stories as to them that is the truth unless it was something she wanted to sort out but know she would probably never get a straight amswer. So just love them for who they are now and who they are trying to be."
wallflowersghost,fdygv10,t1_fdy85ke,My best friend was 40 when he finally found out the truth about his mother.  His stepmother gave him a box of receipts showing that his father spent thousands of dollars on lawyers and detectives trying to find him all the while his mom kept telling him how awful his dad had been.

fun_egg,elt7vu,top_level,"I am really happy today. I used think that I am invisible in my office, nobody care about me or they don't notice me being there.

But today one of my colleague made a meme about me. It might sound silly and you may think it's not something to be excited about, but being noticed is a new thing for me. I feel like I can do anything today 🤩.

So the meme was really silly and most of people won't find it funny. But today I get to laugh with my colleagues, I will never forget this day."

RealSteveIrwin,ell995,top_level,"So it snowed alot today and I got stuck trying to drive home. While going down a steep hill I saw a truck at the bottom with their hazards on. I started going down this hill and all of a sudden my ABS started kicking on and I started sliding, trying to not hit the truck at the bottom which at my current rate I would have, I channeled my inner drift star and ripped my E-Brake as hard as I could locking up my back tires. This caused the butt end of my car to kick out and my car to go sideways, I was aiming for the hill on the  side of the road and I hit it. This split second decision saved me from totaling my car and most likely another one. Kinda proud of this one.

Edit: I don’t see how this is clickbait, if not made clear in the post. I purposely slid my car into a snow bank/ hill on the side of the road to avoid an accident with a car."

OneObi,fdjt00l,t1_fdiswn9,"Could be the birth of a new career. Good save champ.

Fortunately we don't have much snow here (England, UK) and when it snows the country grinds to a halt. Taking the car out in the snow can be quite the experience."
MolishPust4rd,fdj5kuk,t3_ell995,"Nice!  For future reference when driving through inclement weather such as snow - downshift to low gear.  This will retard the engine enough to slow your descent down the hill.  If a hill looks dodgey, creep down the hill in low gear and only use your brakes if absolutely necessary, even then just tap them a bit.  If your tires are bad I wouldn't even touch the brakes going downhill.  Good luck out there, glad you're safe!

EDIT:  After reading numerous comments I should clarify that the process I described is based on my experience in AUTOMATIC Front wheel or AWD vehicles only.  I do not recommend performing this in a manual transmission vehicle that is traveling at cruising speed.

If you're driving a Standard, avoid over-braking under said conditions.  Over-braking will create a barrier of snow between your tire treads and the road, robbing you of traction and send you sliding.  In that case, jam down the brake pedal, DO NOT LET UP.  Nudge the steering  wheel to send the vehicle left or right.  Whatever direction you start spinning is the direction you want to CUT the wheel to tighten the spin, DO NOT LET UP ON THE BRAKE, you will stop when momentum has dissipated.  You can then relax your sphincter, change your underwear and pat yourself on the back for being AWESOME."
thatshittyprogrammer,fdjdjyu,t1_fdj5kuk,"Good tip, but to me this sounds like it's most likely somewhere in NA, where most cars are automatic"
RealSteveIrwin,fdjodyz,t1_fdj5kuk,"When I drive in the snow i usually drive in my 2nd gear but this time I didn’t. This hill was too steep to not use brakes, I would have to use brakes even without snow since there’s a 90 degree bend at the bottom, but thank you!"

kielios,fdjuk61,t1_fdj5kuk,A manual car risks losing control when downshifting unless you clutch 100% perfectly.
Fliandin,fdkr4zl,t1_fdj5kuk,"Ok, first there is nothing wrong with downshifting a manual.  You do need to know your vehicle, but downshifting from higher gears is a great way to bleed off speed or control descent speed.  It is a fantastic choice for dealing with slowing down on sketchy roads.   If anything in a manual it is even more effective than in an automatic, as an automatic generally wont make the down shift until it deems it appropriate, and generally does not apply near as much engine braking as you can manage to pull off in a manual.  I glanced through comments and didn't see where people said not to do this in a manual, but i can assure you from a life lived in Alaska, that using the engine braking capabilities of a manual transmission is tried and true and very effective.  


The bigger concern i have is with a front wheel drive vehicle, dropping into a lower gear without using some brakes as well will put the force of the braking entirely on the front wheels (as those are what are now going slower) this will tend to slide the back around, you have to watch and be ready for this.   Whereas downshifting a rear wheel drive vehicle will put the force of the engine braking on the rear axle and will actually help keep the rear end from coming around.  


Further i'd like to note your statement of jam down on the brake pedal is fine, on an ABS equipped vehicle, but will leave you entirely at the mercy of momentum with zero ability to steer on a Non-ABS equipped vehicle.   And in the most extreme cases of wet black ice many ABS systems will still lock up blocking any ability to control your vehicle.  In these cases the driver must act as his own ABS system or just get off the brake and do their best to manage the speed and control with steering and throttle input.   


The invention of ABS, stability control, anti slip, has drastically changed how much the computer in your car does for you, that once upon a time you had to do yourself, and if any of these systems fail, or you find yourself in a vehicle without these systems its important to take a bit of time out to understand how the vehicle is going to react without these systems and how you as a driver can still drive in a safe and controlled manner even in marginal situations.   


Needless to say the single most important thing is to know your vehicle and to spend time learning how it reacts under numerous situations and understanding how to respond to its reactions to the conditions.  As well as what to do when systems fail (think fan belt going out, destroying your power assist to the brakes and steering, or battery and alternator failing and leaving you without any electronics assists, including abs, stability control etc)"

You can’t expect someone for whom shifting is not a normal part of driving to be in a dangerous situation and suddenly go “hey I know. I should do this thing I literally never do and hope for the best!”"
DCak3z,fdkfle5,t1_fdjdjyu,"There’s almost always an “overdrive off” or some function to pick a lower gear for that exact reason, I recommend learning it on your specific car"

I live 1,800ft above sea level in the Mid-Atlantic region of the US.  It's a long way down to the bottom of the hill—especially riding through ice and snow.  

I think it's important to know the limits of one's abilities and those can only be tested through experience and/or the depths of our knowledge base.  

Everybody reacts differently to situations and, who knows, maybe some random tip you recall from a faceless redditor might be what makes or breaks you when reaction happens faster than thought."
MolishPust4rd,fdke26w,t1_fdkcvxq,"This is true, sure.  If you're going that fast downhill through inclement weather...in a car, well, anyone with just a cursory amount of common sense should immediately expect the situation to go very very wrong."
Kotrats,fdjebv7,t1_fdjdo02,"Still doesnt work the same way as a manual since the automatic isnt connected to the engine via clutch like on a manual. Of course there are different types of automatics these days but with a normal old style torque coverter automatic the torque is only transferred one way through the converter. 

This is also why you cant tow automatics the same way as you tow manuals. Oil pump and cooling are powered by the engine and not the wheels. So when towing your transmission burns up because the wheels are connected to the trans and spinning gears but thats not getting cooled because the engine is the one powering the oil pump. Also you cant so push starts because the wheels wont help you get the engine turning."
Fl4shbang,fdjsusn,t1_fdjmeql,"That only goes for america though, here in europe most people have never driven an automatic transmission. I think I've only ever been in a car with an auto once or twice."
Alec123445,fdkgfoz,t1_fdjmeql,"That should be the automatic response. But it isn't. It seems like in some places in America people feel that they shouldn't have to signal. Or forget because of bad driver training.
Doesn't mean that it should change to be better. With better driver training. Some drivers I honestly don't know how they passed the drivers test. Especially when people moving at a slow speed freak out and forget which pedal is the brake and smash the accelerator and crash. That shouldn't happen, basic steering, braking and acceleration should be second nature but for some reason it isn't.
Sorry it pisses me off.
I understand that this is reality but it shouldn't be."
RealSteveIrwin,fdjojmj,t1_fdjmeql,"I’ve driven a manual once, it was a turbo 99 eclipse"
RealSteveIrwin,fdk9908,t1_fdk1kv1,I live in a rural area so it’s almost all 90 degree turns and steep hills
Fliandin,fdkuqht,t1_fdktayv,"absolutely, sharing our experiences and experiencing things ourselves is the only way forward, and I do hope that someone out there benefits from all the advice given here as well as OP's original story about how they handled a sketchy moment behind the wheel."
disturbed286,fdjensk,t1_fdjebv7,"All true.  

But if the idea is to force a lower speed by retarding the engine, choosing the lower automatic gear still accomplishes that.  It wont shift above 1/2/whatever you chose.  The engine braking still happens."
nothjarnan,fdjjljg,t1_fdjebv7,"you can still engine brake with an automatic gearbox.

source: I drive an automatic Passat with a V6, it engine brakes like a beast.

still nothing compared to a manual though"
PlaysWithPaint,fdki4uq,t1_fdkgfoz,It’s pretty difficult to develop automaticity in response to circumstances that you’ve never encountered before.
elst3r,fdkaqdt,t1_fdk9908,"Where i go to school is an old town with really steep hills and lots and lots of snow. Its not uncommon for cars to have to go the long way around to find a less steep hill they can drive up. Also almost all intersections dont have stop signs on the ways going up or downhill, only the road going along the hill has stops, but even that road has steep grades."
Megalocerus,fdkmoy1,t1_fdk9908,"Lots of roads like that.  I remember one years ago:  all ice and very steep, very narrow, with a sharp turn. I was being so careful, and then someone suddenly turned into the road driving the other way in a small pickup with a snow plow hanging way into my lane.  I did not react as smoothly as you."
MolishPust4rd,fdjfqxu,t1_fdjensk,Precisely.
Litty_McGritty,fdk4l1z,t1_fdjensk,The only people who hate automatics are the people who don't know how to properly use them. My Tacoma has went through a ton of snow and I've used engine braking fairly often when going down steep off-road hills.
Kotrats,fdjkowv,t1_fdjjljg,Tiptronic or DSG? Tiptronic has a torque converter but dsg is basically a dual clutch manual thats operated by a robot instead of a person.
Alec123445,fdl6s28,t1_fdki4uq,True.
halld15,fdjt9os,t1_fdjrs4h,"They are definitely not uncommon where I live, I learned to drive in a stick. As for using 1 it 2 in automatic, just try it in your driveway sometime on a flat just to see it won’t break your car, then go find a downhill. It’s a solid winter driving tip"
morganmachine91,fdjn6ga,t1_fdjf1xj,"I used to professionally drive a large automatic flatbed truck. Had to put it in 2 or 1 when going down hills to avoid burning up my brakes.

Don't know what you're talking about, engine braking definitely works on automatics."
disturbed286,fdjfbsx,t1_fdjf1xj,"It doesn't work as well but it does work.

That or all the times I've done it I was delusional and the speedometer lied to me."
Ancelege,fdjfgy7,t1_fdjf1xj,"I mean, it’s not quite the same as on a manual, but automatics will still slow down quite a bit when you force them into the lower gears. Definitely has helped me loads in the past going over some of the gnarly mountains in Utah."
FelixTheHouseLeopard,fdjhers,t1_fdjf1xj,"Doesn't a torque converter lock?

Isn't that the whole point?

At some point the engine must be transmitting power to the wheels, unless you're trying to tell me an automatic transmission is slipping the converter all the time when driving?

Assuming I have all that correct (which is a big assumption, I are dumb) then surely some measure of engine braking is possible?"
MechanicalEngineEar,fdk7d71,t1_fdjf1xj,"Nobody is trying to bump start an automatic here.  It’s just engine braking which automatics absolutely do.  My last car was an automatic and had a diagnostic mode where you could view fuel usage in gal/hr.  During engine braking fuel usage drops completely to 0.00 as in the engine is continuing to turn with absolutely no fuel used, known and deceleration fuel cut-off.  

So if an engine is maintaining 2000 or so RPM with no fuel input, where do you think it is getting that power?  By siphoning energy off of the kinetic energy of the vehicle, AKA, engine braking."
ricensalsa,fdlh4rz,t1_fdjf1xj,"Alot of automatics do have engine braking nowadays, as do the Nissan SUVs, theres a light that comes on in the dash depicting a car on a hill, when going downhill with your foot off the gas,  this light comes on, and it engine brakes to help maintain your speed, instead of speeding up. Also, in any automatic, if you hit your Overdrive override button, it will downshift and slow you down, I use this faily often in my old '98 Tercel to help the brakes last a little longer"
nothjarnan,fdjnmde,t1_fdjkowv,"It's the '99 Passat, so tiptronic or whatever it's called on it."
PlaysWithPaint,fdjtpsj,t1_fdjt9os,There are no hills and no winter where I live.
shaker154,fdkrjzk,t1_fdjt9os,Used my current automatic cars manual esk thing they have in place of 1/2 yesterday for the majority of my drive home from work. Seems to work pretty well in areas where braking is not advisable.
Kotrats,fdjhowg,t1_fdjhers,Older ones dont lock and the transmissions dont have overdrive. Thats why all the old cars have such bad gas mileage. The ones that dont lock are always slipping a little and the ones that lock like on my Jeep lock at a certain rpm. If they were to lock on slowers speeds and rpms you would stall at a stop like on a manual if you dont press the clutch.
disturbed286,fdjfvnj,t1_fdjfkp2,"I never said it was a good idea, just that it can be done.

All that said, my car is one of the like...4% of cars in the US that *is* a manual transmission so this is all largely academic to me anyway."
MolishPust4rd,fdjfx0h,t1_fdjfkp2,It was just a tip.  I wasn't implying what OP should or should not have done in the moment.
FelixTheHouseLeopard,fdjhqvd,t1_fdjhowg,"I know they arent permanently locked until you gain some speed, but in my head if the converter has locked up then engine braking is possible, no?"
Kotrats,fdjhkf7,t1_fdjfvnj,I live in Finland a drive a manual corolla and a 98 automatic grand cherokee and drive some other automatics and manuals often. So I do have some experience on both. Wasnt looking to pick a fight or anyhting was just pointing out that the engine braking in an automatic is marginal at best and not nearly as useful as it is in a manual. I use engine braking with a manual all the time when drivin in what we call traffic and when going down hills. You can eke out a few mpg with it that you cant do with the automatic and thats nice. On the 5.2 GC and my brothers SRT8 300C the mpg is really not something i dare to look at since fuel is like 7$/gal here.
Kotrats,fdjjyzl,t1_fdjhqvd,"Im not an expert on the locking torque converters but i would assume that the lockup releases pretty much when you lift your foot from the gas. I think the lock up  doesnt even engage on lower gears atleast on mechanical ones, only on 3rd and OD. Electronic ones probably are the same since you dont need or want the lock up to happen when driving in traffic or such because that would probably be a similar feeling like switching gears constantly. Like the OD its benefits dont really come up until highway speeds. Also you want the lock to open during acceleration to get your revs up when your kickdown drops you down a gear. 

So theoretically you could lock up and do engine braking but since they dont lock up on lower speeds it wont happen. Now i dont now about the newer 8 or more speed ones and how the computer controls what on those so maybe they have something like engine braking but the older ones that most cars have are based on some really old tech. Jeeps for example had the A500 series transmissions well in to the 2000’s and thats based on the A904 that came out in the late 50’s or early 60’s. So the electronics and fancy stuff on those was rudimentary at best."

Good for you because know you know your self better. Not saying you didnt before of course but this is the type of situation where people usually find out the hard way that they are not as capable as they tought they were."
brynleyt,fdjlah6,t3_ell995,"Nice!! I had a similar moment last year. I live in the welsh valleys where some hills are extremely steep. We had a lot of snow in our area over night so in the morning.I checked the first few hills by my house on foot and they had been gritted so I decided to make my way to work. Got down the the first hill when the road makes a chicane downhill. All of a sudden I noticed the second part hadn’t been gritted. This hill is steep but it’s too late I’m already on it. I drive an mx5 and the tail end was kicking out to the left coming into a parked vehicle. I remember screaming to my girlfriend who was sat next to me “we are fucked, we are fucked!” I turned the wheel left almost into the parked car to try and correct the back end and to my surprise it worked and we narrowly missed the parked car. 
The danger wasn’t over though as at the end of this steep hill was a narrow T junction and basically someone’s living room (there are a lot of small terraced houses in wales, you have to google it if you’ve never seen them) I had the car in first but it just wasn’t biting and was still picking up speed. I tapped the brakes very gently, lock up! Started screaming to the Mrs again “we’re fucked, we’re fucked! I had one option left that I had to try if I didn’t want my car to end up smashing through someone’s front window. I aggressively turned the wheel right and to my surprise the whole car drifted 90 degrees, at this point I was sliding down this hill sideways. Obviously I didn’t really know this would happen but the car started to slow and just like something out of a James Bond movie the car stopped dead in the middle of the T junction road. 
Couldn’t believe my luck! I’ll never drive in the snow again. It would have been badass if I didn’t scream 😂"

DeepEcho,fdjemt3,t3_ell995,Did something similar. Missed the mini van that slammed on their brakes but cost me $700 for a new bumper from the snow mound I bailed into. Sucks but might have saved a life. You made the right call. Drift safely.
jjbugman2468,fdjk0z3,t3_ell995,"Hope you're alright! Been in a similar situation when I was in middle school. I'd mostly worn out the brakes on the cheap bike I was riding and one time, when an SUV burst out of its garage in front of me, I had to decide whether to try braking anyway (and in hindsight be in just the right position/timing to get trampled underneath) or speed up and try to get myself tossed over the hood.

Considering I'm leaving this comment now, it's probably obvious which one I chose"
Waddupp,fdjwlwd,t3_ell995,i'm assuming an E-brake is a handbrake? never heard it called that before
elst3r,fdk210o,t1_fdjwlwd,E-brake stands for emergency brake. Although its usually used for parking and very rarely for emergencies. Hence also being known as parking brake. If you say hand brake it just eliminates the confusion.
RealSteveIrwin,fdk9mjy,t1_fdjwlwd,"Ya, parking brake, e brake, handbrake, all the same thing I’ve heard it been called a lot"
TysonDad,fdjxwmd,t1_fdjwlwd,Yes. Also referred to as a park brake by some.
geekoraptor,fdj0k95,t3_ell995,"I'm glad you're okay. I'm glad you didn't hurt the person/people in the truck. I don't know if it would have helped in your case, but pumping your brakes is usually better than locking them up. Even with ABS. At a certain point, it's just too late. You might have been at that point. How's your car? How are you holding up? Be proud of yourself. You could have potentially saved lives."
disturbed286,fdjdt6x,t1_fdj0k95,"I disagree.  Pumping the brakes in an ABS equipped vehicle prevents the ABS from doing its job.  Ideally you want steady pressure to let the ABS do the pumping. 

Otherwise you're just encouraging locked wheels which aren't much good."
bem13,fdjer39,t1_fdjdt6x,"I attended an advanced driving class a few weeks ago. They taught us to just slam the brakes and HOLD THEM. No need to pump if you have ABS, that's what it's for."
disturbed286,fdjewqy,t1_fdjer39,"Exactly.  ABS handles that, and faster than the human driving could hope to."
geekoraptor,fdjttuc,t1_fdjewqy,"If their ABS was kicking in and they were sliding, then the wheels were too locked up. ABS is great in just about any other condition, but I know from experience that it's not the best thing for snow/ice. I grew up on a hill that regularly got slammed with snow and wasn't always cleared off by the time I needed to go to school/work. If you slam the brakes and hold them, you're fucked."

IAmBecomeAlice,fdjofng,t3_ell995,"I had a similar situation the other day where my skills from drifting on a simulator (Assetto Corsa with a wheel/shifter/etc) kicked in and saved me from panicking and sliding into a guard rail. Was going around a very small slow bend leading to a parking lot and my rear end started sliding out from under me because I braked just a *little* too hard so I let off the brake and countersteered to almost full lock and brought it back surprisingly smoothly. Traction control beeping away the whole time. Can't believe I kept my cool as well as I did but I guess I'm kind of used to being sideways in a car even if I had never been sideways in a real car up until then, so I knew what I was dealing with and how the car was going to react to my inputs. If I didn't have those developed instincts/muscle memory I definitely would have panicked and slammed on the brakes or something and ended up in a guard rail."

My car is a newer model and I have found very little benefits from having an electronic handbrake."
MrJTwiggs,fdkiuyj,t1_fdkh4ka,No I don't think it would be possible and even if it was I probably wouldn't recommend it. The one car we have with an electronic parking brake limits it to only operate under a certain speed (I think like 5 mph?). Even then if it did somehow manage to lock the brakes it could be a pretty bad if you found yourself needing to unlock them as they're not always the fastest mechanisms.

As you found, brakes tend to lock up the wheels in frictionless situations, causing the vehicle to skid out of control. Hitting the gas forces the wheels to turn, creating friction -- allowing you to power your way out of a bad situation."

reunitedthrowaway,fdjq3hd,t3_ell995,"Oh god man I would cry. 

I try to take super good care of my car.
 
I got sad the other day because the check engine light came on. 

I was in the car screaming ""gooooD FUCKIN DAMMIT"" because I just finished fixing things that cost me around $1000 (because I want the car to last)"
RealSteveIrwin,fdjqagy,t1_fdjq3hd,I love my car it was just a choice of crashing into another truck at a higher rate of speed with my front bumper or at a slower rate or speed hitting my rear into a snow bank/hill
elst3r,fdk2qj4,t1_fdjq3hd,"Could take it in to just have them read the code. My jeep has this dumb ghost light that comes on for like a month or so and then goes back off again. Its the O2 sensor on the front right side, and doesnt do much for my car. Probably just needs cleaning and is an easy fix. But it can be expensive. So i dont really worry about it. Whenever the light comes on, I take it over and ask what it is and only once has it not been the sensor."
reunitedthrowaway,fdjqeoz,t1_fdjqagy,"Yeah no I got chu which is why I would be sad AF if I was in that situation. You're a tough cookie, especially to think so fast and efficiently."

ashowofhands,fdjz4ki,t3_ell995,"sometimes it's inevitable that you'll run into something, and you just have to choose to run into whatever will cause the least overall damage."
RealSteveIrwin,fdk9io9,t1_fdjz4ki,"I have a plastic bumper and nothing really that important in my rear so that’s what I went with, way better than hitting the front and breaking a radiator and all that"
Zath03,fdk14b5,t3_ell995,I used to rip around corners in winter to slide all over for fun. Once I ended up almost hitting the curb and had to crank it the other way while yanking the e brake. Doing so resulted in my car going to other way to the point of me being sideways. I ended up going down 3/4 of the block sideways with cars parked on either side. Never hit anything.
RealSteveIrwin,fdk9bmr,t1_fdk14b5,I’m pretty sure you used all your good luck on that one 😂
conflagrare,fdke1v4,t3_ell995,"Great job, but next time, get snow tires."
RealSteveIrwin,fdkesi9,t1_fdke1v4,"I’ve always been good with my current car in the snow, I guess this was just one of those unlucky moments. But definitely will be buying chains or snow tires"
conflagrare,fdkeyac,t1_fdkesi9,Great to hear. :)
respect-thebeard,fdkla3z,t3_ell995,A safer method would have been to start downshifting and throw it in low gear. Either way you're safe and catastrophe averted!
RealSteveIrwin,fdkmq6u,t1_fdkla3z,It’s an automatic so can’t really shift without stopping completely
respect-thebeard,fdkn6fu,t1_fdkmq6u,"Untrue, I've lived in the Northeast US my entire life, have only owned automatic vehicles, and have used this method numerous times in situations similar to yours."
RealSteveIrwin,fdkonhx,t1_fdkn6fu,"Mine doesn’t have a “manual mode” it just has the  1,2,3 on the shifter, I was always told to never shift those while driving."
respect-thebeard,fdkpmcx,t1_fdkonhx,"Yea so what you do is shift from D to 3, then to 2, and 1 if needed. The lower gear with slow down your vehicle without cause the wheels to lock up. I've done it more times than I can count and never had any mechanical issues. Time to unlearn old habits"
RealSteveIrwin,fdkpzm6,t1_fdkpmcx,"Ya I guess I was thought wrong as a kid, I’ll have to unlearn that"

RzK,fdko7ts,t3_ell995,"A little advice for people who drive bad in snow... brakes and panicking are your enemy.

You should never slam the brakes, or the e-brake otherwise your car becomes a sled. Snow fills in your tire tread and basically makes the tire smooth like a hockey puck losing its grip... however if the wheels are rolling, in winter tires they are designed to spit snow out to maintain the grip of that wheel. The best thing you can do is keep calm, go very gentle on the brake and let your car roll slowly into a stop. Even if you're spinning out of control. I even found that tapping your foot on the brake, similarly to ABS, helps a lot. Even more than ABS at times. 

Beyond that, just get winter tires. They aren't fool proof but there are so many people who cheap out on winter tires thinking ""all seasons"" will do the job, but all seasons are misleading... they arent for winter... they harden and are useless in snow."
RealSteveIrwin,fdkodos,t1_fdko7ts,"I’ve always been good in the snow, I started slowly with the brakes but when they didn’t work I slowly went to the floor with them, I’ve always found the abs better than pumping but I think it’s just a car to car thing"
RzK,fdkpl9p,t1_fdkodos,"Really nice save though, I remember one time I was sliding sideways into another car while stopped at a red light. By sheer luck the pickup I was driving at the time stopped, otherwise my day would be ruined trading insurance information. It was a ""well, what can you really do?"" situation. 

Nature is a jerk"
Leif_Erickson_,fdkq77k,t3_ell995,*i wonder if you know how they live in tokyo...*
croissantmachine,fdkrfds,t3_ell995,"I've done the same thing. Terrible roads, a truck was stuck at a stop sign and my car wasnt stopping, so I decided to hit the snowbank instead of the truck. Wouldve totally mashed the front of my car but ended up leaving without a scratch (albeit 30 minutes later after struggling to get dislodged)"
RealSteveIrwin,fdks0df,t1_fdkrfds,I have a small dent in my rear bumper but it’s plastic so should be easy to get out and it was tricky but took about 5 minutes to get out
croissantmachine,fdksene,t1_fdks0df,"not bad! living in a place with treacherous weather I don't really give a shit about dents and scratches anymore, it happens! I recieved my car with a big dent already in it and as it was my first car there are a few ""learning scratches"" on the sides. the important thing is that it runs!"
chevychasist,fdlhmop,t3_ell995,My 99 grand am went 102 and I hit a butternut bread truck and damnit if I didn't break an arm

Dreadfeel1,eo3ud1,top_level,"Even though I’ve made some dumb decisions in my life she has ALWAYS believed in me, and for some reason she still does.

She’s the light in my darkest thoughts that always manages to bring me back. If it wasn’t for her I wouldn’t be here. 

I love you, mom. So damn much.

Edit: My first gold and silver and it’s in a post about my mom. I love you guys.

Edit 2: Showed my mom the post and she almost started crying. She loved all of your comments :)"
Allons-ycupcake,fe8i7yh,t3_eo3ud1,"My mom passed a few years ago, but shortly before that she used google docs (she had just started college and was amazed by cloud storage) to write me a cheesy little poem about how the ""storm clouds"" are over my head but I am a ""fierce tiger"" who will overcome. It even had a picture to go with each line. It is a cringey AF poem, but fuck do I love it.

Appreciate your parents if you have them folks, they're never around long enough."
OsmerusMordax,fe8zvit,t1_fe8i7yh,"Agreed. I lost my Dad unexpectedly last year. I thought he would have been around longer, and I regret (as horrible as this sounds) taking him for granted and assuming he'll always be there for me.

Also, and I know this phrase means nothing, but I'm sorry for your loss. It's a real bitch."
Dreadfeel1,fe9mm0w,t1_fe8i7yh,I’m so sorry about your mom. Nothing about that is cringe. It’s really sweet.
naturalcauzes,fe9odk6,t1_fe8i7yh,"It'll be 15 years next month, and it still hurts. I don't think she made me a poem, but I do have the many jokes she made at my and other family members' expense. God I miss her. :)"
tdawg210,febhz6j,t1_fe8i7yh,"My Mom passed a few years ago as well. There isn't a day that I don't think of her.  

For everyone that is still fortunate to have their parents in their lives,  get to know them better. 

Ask them about their parents & siblings.

***Ask them about their favorite memories of each and every one of your family members.***

I did this with my Uncle and the memories he imparted to me about my grandparents,  aunts, uncle and my Mom can't be found anywhere. When he spoke about my Nana, this 6'+, war veteran & life long biker came to tears.  I promise you,  you wil not regret asking your parents or other family members about their favorite memories. 

My thoughts are with those that have lost parents.  Internet hugs to all of you.

Edit: fixed a sentence that was incorrect"
neildavies17,fecv3co,t1_fe8i7yh,"This is so true... I lost my mum just before Christmas, unexpectedly, and there are so many more things I wish I had asked and spoken to her about. I made so much more of an effort after losing my dad (actually stepdad but just as good as a dad) in 2016. At least they are together.
I still have my dad so will make sure I spend lots of time with him.
Treasure every moment you can..."
Cassknowsbest,fec0q0z,t1_fe8zvit,"I have the same regret with my dad who passed away a year and a half ago. I always assumed he’d be there for everything. I knew one day he would die, but I thought I’d be much older.. that I’d have more time."
ArmandoPayne,fea7ze1,t1_fe9odk6,"My nan passed away when my dad was 16 I believe, either 16 or 15 so I never knew her. It was a shock I guess leaving behind 6 kids, like 20 dogs, 50 cats and a husband."
Allons-ycupcake,fec1fae,t1_febhz6j,"To add to this, if they're open to it, record their stories.

When I knew my grandma was nearing the end of her good days we sat down and I asked her about a thousand questions about her family. My extended family has never been close, and if I hadn't done this I would have missed out on so much. I will always have those hours of conversation telling me about her own mother and grandma, her youth when she was a hairdresser at a high end salon, and the tragic and beautiful anecdotes about our family."

Second: i started a note book for some of the good ideas

TLDR: be kind, listen, trust your kids, be appreciative when they help, be supportive, encourage their  Interests. And bring snacks!"
Allons-ycupcake,fe8l0fx,t1_fe8h7x8,"My mom took me to all of the concerts I went to as a kid/teen, and even into adulthood we would still go together. From Aaron Carter when I was 10 to Marilyn Manson when I was 15, and far more Slipknot concerts and Warped Tours than necessary, she always supported what music I liked and never gave me flak for it.

I never had to be embarrassed about what phase I was going through with her, and she always supported me. Obsession with Harry Potter? We went to every midnight book release and we would read the books within the same week so I could talk to her about them. Tripp pants phase? She'd stop by hot topic after work to keep an eye on the clearance racks because those pants were absurdly expensive. Needing stickers to put on my notebook to get a boy to talk to me first period? Went and chose them with me. Getting into the professional world and needing nice clothes? Packages in the mail with dress shirts and slacks she found. Took a year off of college to figure things out? She was right there helping me consider different career paths.

Just be there for your kid, apologize when you fuck up, and don't make them feel like they can't come to you for support or help. Stay interested in what they enjoy and enjoy it with them, whether it's dumb or not."
AwNawHellNawBoi,fe8hvn3,t1_fe8h7x8,"My mom stuck up for me no matter what. I know that no matter what, day or night, regardless of what she has going on, she has my back and is there."
All_Seeing_Dorito,fe8qejg,t1_fe8h7x8,"Watching cartoons with me. She's been watching whatever cartoon I had liked growing up and as a young adult we still watch shows (and yes, the occasional cartoon too) together. Watching and taking interest in whatever your kid watches, I see in retrospect, is a great way to monitor that the show sends good messages to your kids, while also providing a way to bond over your love of the show.

Cuddling together, sharing blankets on the couch, and taking naps together is something I enjoy with my Mom, and she still likes to do when she visits /her/ Mom. I grew up with her patting my back gently to lull me to sleep and even now I still really enjoy that (even though she's prone to fall asleep before I do now haha).

She praises me in small, but significant ways; she tells me I'm beautiful, praises my character traits, and encourages me to be the kind daughter she sees when she looks at me.

OP, I have faith in you to be the Mother you wanted to have; I'm also sorry that your Mother doesn't show you the care you deserve, and I hope that you may find that care in a loved one someday. I respect you immensely for wanting to break the cycle you found yourself in and do better for your children."
firehorn123,fe8vq5y,t1_fe8h7x8,A Dad here.   I once heard someone recommending to smile every time you look their way.   I do this and it goes a long way.
taita2004,fe8ruvc,t1_fe8h7x8,While my mother is pretty awesome...my father is the complete opposite. So I definitely understand the wanting to be better for your kids...and so far so good. I've got a 10 year old daughter that is a total daddys girl and thinks I'm awesome. Hopefully that carries on into her teenage years as well 🤞🏻🤞🏻
AtoZZZ,fe8xxnr,t1_fe8h7x8,"Always act in your kids’ best interest, and embrace what they love (unless it’s unethical, will impede their future, or will lead to bad behavior), even if you don’t understand it. Don’t dismiss their problems. Always put their needs first.

Flothrudawind,fe8zhqs,t1_fe8h7x8,"I am experiencing some serious doubts about big decisions in my life right now and have recently admitted to my long lasting anxiety. I was afraid of telling her because i was afraid that she wouldn't understand or see me as a completely irresponsible coward. However, after letting it out, she was... different. I've always been so down and under the weather but after talking to her and finding out she was in far too many similar situations that she's never brought up before, she told me that we'd all get through this together. I don't know when that day will come if I will ever get over myself but when she kissed my forehead and wished me goodnight it just broke me. I feel so lucky and I didn't know it. I hope to find out more about myself inside one day. With her and the rest of my family and help them figure things out too. I can't say much for anyone going through difficult times; doesn't matter if it's worse or less intense as that is never an indication of the severity of the situation. However, I just want to wish you the best of luck and that you have or will find the right people by your side to stay and cheer you on."

There’s nothing more potent, nothing more transformative to your kids’ lives than that."
ashes2asherz,feaa3cc,t1_fe8h7x8,"My mom and I would do a blockbuster night together when I was growing. Back when blockbuster was a thing of course. We would go the grocery store and she would like let me pick out all the snacks I wanted. I loved it. 
She also went to all my sporting events growing up. She had a job as a house cleaner and worked her ass off but if she was able to make it, she would. It meant a lot seeing her out in the crowd watching. She invested her time in me and I’m so grateful to have had a parent that did. She cared so much. 
She will be gone four years this March. She passed in a very short battle with cancer. The most selfless, caring person I’ve ever encountered."
Madman--,fe994yp,t1_fe8h7x8,"Honestly the best thing my mums ever done was simply chatting with me about my day and other random stuff. Just being a friendly person to talk to at the end of the day.

DrEmerson,fe9lslv,t1_fe8h7x8,"My mom never judged me for anything. I've always been a weird person and she supported me no matter what I was in to. She believed me when I was scared or anxious or depressed, and either let me not do the thing scaring me or let me figure it out at my own pace.

And she trusted me. I have very rarely lied to my parents. I never needed to. They didn't overreact, they helped me solve the problem. I think that trust was one of the reasons I didn't act out too much as a teen.

But the interest you show in wanting to be better for your own kids tells me you will be a great parent. It's okay to not be perfect, just love them the best you can :)"
teb1313,feae24n,t1_fe8h7x8,"My mom knew that growing up most kids will experiment with alcohol and possibly drugs.
She told me at a young age that no matter where I was or what I was doing, if I needed her help or felt unsafe(drunk driver, creepy boy, etc) that I could call her and she would never be angry.

I used that once or twice, once when I was in ALOT of trouble, and she let it go and was just happy I was safe and felt comfortable calling her."

She still is over the top with expressing her love for me.

She also appreciates little things i do which makes me feel so.. good god. Like when i wash the dishes and clean the kitchen while shes out, like its a small thing but the way she expresses her gratitude makes me feel so good an appreciated and i only want to do even more for her if these little things make her so happy. She always notices when i clean up while shes out of the house. ALWAYS. And she always tells me how nice it is of me god. These little things matter so much."

She listens.  Asks questions and gives advice but never makes me feel judged for making my own decisions.  

When I was a kid she made my friends welcome, too.  She would always offer drinks and food and make an effort to ask what kinds of things we were doing.  

At one point in high school one of my buddies asked if he could stay with us for a couple of days.  My mom said yes without blinking and he stayed with us for over a week before thanking me and my parents and moving back home.  They never asked what was wrong or anything."

I put my weight on her small frame even if. Don’t want to and I’m a big woman. Like 5’-9” and she’s not even over 5’-0. That’s how I remember all those things that we were partners in crime.

Ever since I was a child, my parents never stopped me from doing anything, never, I never had a curfew, I was never scolded for bad grades, You know why? Because my parents always told me that they knew I was smart enough to make good decisions and I wouldn’t let them down.


After spending years surrounding by gangs, and thugs, we moved, now me and my brother are both in college, hell my brother is 20 and makes like 5 times the amount his peers make😐"

SeagullsHaveNoMorals,fecjw65,t1_fe8h7x8,"When I still believed in Santa, one Christmas, my mom set up a little clue hunt with little riddles and puzzles all over our apartment sending me from one little present to another. For example, a fish related riddle would lead me to an ornamental fish statue we kept on the piano where I’d find another clue and so on and so forth. Eventually this treasure hunt culminated in me finding my main gift, a big doll house :) My mom was super creative in the activities she set up for me, but this one is 100% my fondest memory of my childhood. 

Ironically, this is how I discovered Santa wasn’t real since I recognised her handwriting on all the clues, but I didn’t care and begged her to do it again next Christmas haha"

And I was there for them and still am. And we’re still close, so I did something right. You don’t have to be perfect. Just try and let them know you are trying."
GByteKnight,feacm6f,t1_fe8l0fx,"One of the greatest things either of my parents ever did to me was to apologize.  It wasn't even a big deal either - they loaned my car to a family friend for a couple of days while I was on away on a trip (pre-cell phone days).  I wasn't even mad.  But the car was mine and my dad realized that they didn't have the right to loan it out without asking me, and when I got back he apologized.  It stuck with me.  My dad acknowledging that he'd made a mistake and apologizing!

At 36 I have a great relationship with my parents because they treat me as an equal, an adult man with a family and a career.  They ask my advice (and I ask theirs!) and they help out with my stuff and ask me for help on theirs."

SeleneCortez,feccsgp,t1_feacm6f,"My mom would always apologize to me when she made a mistake or was having a bad day and snapped at me. No matter what, she would give a heartfelt apology. Then as a teenager, I would do the same. When I did something bad, I felt my conscience remind me that it wasn't right and that I should say I'm sorry."

DJVENZI,fecenz3,t1_fe8i2n9,"I feel the same, not necessarily the same situation but we’re in LA and coincidentally so is my grandmother and I was very excited to see her. My mom was a single mom so a lot of the times when she was at work my grandma would be the one who’d raise me in those times and she taught me so much I love that woman to no end, that’s not to say I feel any differently about my mother because I love her to no end as well. Grandmas (and mother’s) are the best."

Just today she called me confused as to why Narcos(TV show I started to watch with her at Christmas) only had one season. I checked Netflix and nope, there's 3 seasons, mom.

I’m so incredibly grateful to her. I miss her when I’m not with her, but knowing she answers the phone in the middle of the night if I need her is something I feel like I’ll never be able to repay her for. We’re so lucky to have mothers we love."

My family has never been vocally affectionate, I only remember my mom telling me she loves me once in my adult life, but I know everything she did was to make sure my sister and I could succeed. To this day, I still leave my parents house with extra socks, snacks, books, and household goods that my mom got because she just thought I could use it.

That's a whole story in and of itself) and since then we have been through a lot as a family, namely another abusive father figure for about 5 years. But despite all that we have come out stronger and closer as a family. She's done so much for us and we love her more than anyone."
ramasili,feaf9xb,t3_eo3ud1,"I stan op.

My own mommie is like. My bff. Seriously. I cannot imagine why some think its lame to have your mother be your best friend, but I guess they must not have had a great relationship with their own mom. I wish I could share mine with everyone who needs a good mom bc my mommie would adopt ever single person in a blink.

Might fuck around, write a song about her and what a strong person she is after all that terrible things she's been through, and is even still going through today (some of it admittedly my fault.)

Good to have some Mom-loving solidarity, and maybe one day my song will be on the radio so she can hear it everyday."

I got a tattoo a few months that I was having second thoughts about AFTER and was just really sad and I’m in college in Texas, my family lives in Alaska. It was hard not having anyone to talk to about it, but I called my mom and she made me feel better about it, my decision, and myself. I love her so much."

Mr_82,feb439t,t3_eo3ud1,"Yeah I hear you. I love my mom but emotionally she's a real pain; helicopter-type parenting, where even in just a basic ""conversation"" (they're usually pretty one-sided) she just asks questions and expects you to respond instantly, then throws a fit when it doesn't happen. Nevertheless she's more or less raised my siblings and me single-handedly, through a divorce where she had to find work without a college degree.

Conversely, I have a father that lives nearby, whom I didn't see much after they got divorced. He's always ready to have fun and go get a beer or whatever, but he's really weird, perhaps stingy being the best word to describe it, especially when it comes to actual problems in life. This was especially aggravating to us kids growing up, as if we had a problem, bringing it up with my mom would elicit things like ""go ask your FATHER,"" followed by a rant about him, when we all know he has money to help (if money were the issue) but simply won't.

I'm in my late twenties now, but living with my mom, with no job, no seeming ability to get an interview, and well under $500 in the bank at this point. Well last week I got pulled over by a cop for driving the car my dad was/is giving me, but which he'd cracked the windshield at some point before I got it. Even though it's patched up, still visible, and other cops had said it was fine, I got ticketed for it, in addition to a ticket for suspended licensure due to not having my emissions inspected (which I couldn't pay for then or now). I know how things would go if I tried talking to him about it, so same deal here. This shit's a pain. Also fuck cops in general; they don't do a damn thing to help you when you actually need it, as I've had to deal with when reporting things like theft in the past.

Anyway it's great you seem to have a good relationship with your mom. I guess there's a difference between having a supportive parent and one you have more of a friendly relationship with, but it seems like you've got both there."
marzipanka,feb43nt,t3_eo3ud1,"I have never thought about it, but lots of our mental problems come from our childhood - I had a group therapy and realized that I avoided tons of problems just because my mom loved me and always believed that I'm one of the best creatures in the world. As a teen I used to think that it's too much of her love, but now I understand, how much I owe her. Really think that she is one of my best friend and my guarding angel"
fanushi,febdae7,t3_eo3ud1,"My Mom was never really expressive into saying how much she loves me or how proud she is of me and that is perfectly fine with me. I'd have to admit though, I was a sucker for my Mom's validation. She's working hard on it, and I am genuinely happy whenever she tells me she loves me. I just realized I'm not getting any younger and she is, too so I make sure I always tell her how much I love her and how I wanna be a better person for her. I may have had done stupid things which lead me to rock bottom but I promised her after retiring (she's a single mom and she'll be turning 60 soon) I would give her a comfortable life. She may not have the best childhood as they were really poor growing up and whenever I am in a bad place, I remember how she always made sure we had food on the table and had enough money for my education. I love her so much just imaging losing her makes me bawl and panic as I don't think I'll ever have enough time left. I love you Mom, sorry for being stupid. I'm trying and I'm working super hard and I'll make sure we'll be okay, I promise."

FaithfulCaprisun,eodnb1,top_level,"In the one and a half years I’ve had calculus so far, I’ve never scored an A on ANY test. I maybe scored two B’s in the past year and a half. Like I struggled hardcore through Calc AB but my Calc teacher still thought I’d pass the AP exam for it...however I didn’t. I was beat up about it but I promised myself freshman year I’d make Calc BC and pass it. So I just let it keep pushing me and I worked my butt off this semester and I getting that A-, even if it’s barely an A, really just makes me feel like I can really do it. And I’m even projected for a four on the Calc BC exam this year so far! I can’t wait to continue to struggle but keep pushing myself even more! I really hope this pays off and I hope anyone that’s struggling right now believes in themselves too. We can all do this, we just have to have the right mindset."

It’s definitely one of the hardest classes up there and I think anyone that takes it should be proud of themselves."
Gothmakeuphaha,fecberm,t1_feca4k5,Haha I know what you mean about good teachers. I actually took calc again in college and ended up passing all three courses. Luckily I had way better teachers that actually sparked my interested and it’s now one of my favorite subjects
FaithfulCaprisun,fecfgq4,t1_fecberm,Teachers really do impact students a ton and I’m really happy to see that there’s more teachers (at least from my view) at schools over the years that care about the subject and students.

katieeec567,fec20ss,t3_eodnb1,That's awesome!! I never understood calculus haha
vikchow2000,fecfmgi,t3_eodnb1,Good job. That class kicked my ass. I got a C in the class and 5 on the ap test and the teacher wouldn’t bump my grade.
GhettoRamen,fecq0t4,t1_fecfmgi,"Bro that’s weak as fuck, what a shitty move. Any AP teacher at my school would have bumped that to an A easily, a 5 is no joke."
PlatinumP1us,fect2av,t1_fecfmgi,"Yeah man you got robbed. Pretty much every ap class I took in junior/senior year said that they would give you an A in the class if you got a 5 on the ap exam.

I had a c+ in ap us history and I somehow managed to get a 5 on it and my teacher gave me a 4.0 for the class."
serious_notshirley,fecoidn,t3_eodnb1,"Hi there!  I have a BA in Mathematics and worked as an educator (both teaching and tutoring) for a couple years.
 
The struggle you’re talking about is actually a super important part of developing mathematical/logical reasoning skills.  My best results as a math instructor came from pushing students to do exactly what you’re doing: struggling, getting confused, getting frustrated, and pushing through that frustration to understand and solve a problem.  In fact, that’s what mathematicians (real, PROFESSIONAL mathematicians) do every day!
 
This discipline/perseverance is a skill I didn’t learn in high school because math always came easily to me, but BOY did I have to learn it in college.  So you’re getting a head start by learning it now!  It’ll take you far, whether or not you decide to pursue math in the future."

gooselicks,elmy5y,top_level,"Just a few hours ago, I was on my way home from work when I saw a motorcyclist on the side of the highway. I noticed they were sitting next to the motorcycle and had their phone out texting or something, I couldn’t really tell as it was dark. So me being a tad bit concerned but curious to see what was going on.

Now, my parents have always told me not to do this as it could be a set up to something dangerous, and I do understand that. But the area I live in (fingers crossed and knock on wood, probably simultaneously) is a nice area that doesn’t have hardly any violence. 

So I pulled over and slowly walked over to the motorcyclist, being a little cautious just in case. I do carry a concealed weapon so I wasn’t too nervous. They looked over at me and stood up, taking their helmet off. I saw it was a young girl who I’ve seen a couple times before at my job, which somewhat made me feel a bit better. 

I asked her if everything is okay and she said she was quote on quote “incredibly dumb” and forgot to fill up her gas tank before leaving home. So I asked if anyone was on their way to either pick her up or bring gas and she told me her family lived a state away and was in the process of texting someone when I came.

So I offered her a ride to the nearest gas station, and she happily took it. I helped her lift the motorcycle into the back of my truck and as we made our way to a gas station several miles down the road, she couldn’t stop thanking me for doing this. Eventually, we got to the station and I even paid for the fuel, which she really appreciated. Before I left she gave me a hug and said that I literally restored her faith in humanity as lots of incidents happened to her that caused her to lose it in the first place. 

I feel extremely happy I did that, as I’m always willing to lend a hand to someone who needs it. Anyway, I wanted to share this with you all as it actually made my day, rather night. Cheers!"
murder_sickle,fdj0x9u,t3_elmy5y,"Having been the guy on the motorcycle on the side of the road, good on you! Seriously, most people wouldn't have stopped and helped. Your parents did something right raising you."
gooselicks,fdj1qbd,t1_fdj0x9u,"Thank you. Ive been taught to put people before myself no matter what. As I said though, while they did tell me I shouldn’t pull over and help a stranger out on the road necessarily bc of the dangers, I felt that if I didn’t help out I would regret it."
Cloaked42m,fdjoix9,t1_fdj0x9u,How do you tell if a motorcyclist needs help or is just chilling?
DangersVengeance,fdk6ntm,t1_fdj0x9u,"I had similar, didn’t know the fuel warning light wasn’t working. Pushed the bike a junction along the M25."
EdwardLewisVIII,fdj9e8y,t1_fdj1qbd,I was taught the same thing growing up. I can't see someone in need or distress and not do something. It's so ingrained in me now it has passed impulsive and is almost compulsive now. One is giving money to people who ask. I don't question. I don't usually give a lot but if I have cash I'll always give.
iamerwin,fdjqk2j,t1_fdjoix9,Ask.

ssersergio,fdjssq4,t1_fdj9e8y,"I feel good of seeing people like this, my ex girlfriend always asked me why I do that, she loved it, but stopping at the side of a road to help two dudes that you don't even know to lift his car (wheel off, car too close to the ground to put a jack) was weird for her, and I simply didn't even question it, if they need help, and you can give them, why don't do it?"
Cloaked42m,fdjsiqi,t1_fdjqk2j,kinda got about 5 seconds going down the highway to notice someone on the side of the road by their bike.  It would be nice if there was a way to figure out what was going on before trying to get out of traffic.

lucifer_1412,fdj6y31,t3_elmy5y,"That's awesome!

Btw, how did you load the bike in your truck? Did you have tools for it? (Not a truck or a bike guy btw)"
Cowboy185,fdjf2u0,t1_fdj6y31,"Trying not to sound like a complete smartass, but very carefully. Depending on the motorcycle, some can be fairly lightweight and easy to get into a truck bed, others like certain Harleys, Hondas, and Yamahas can get heavy due to their construction, so you have to be careful not to lay it over when you're loading it."
lucifer_1412,fdjfoo3,t1_fdjf2u0,Thanks for informative reply!
NOTaVelociraptr,fdk52a2,t1_fdjf2u0,I think anything over a 125cc is going to be impossible for two people to load without a ramp. 125s are about 225# and the next size up is 325+. You'd also need straps or someone to keep it steady.
flock-of-nazguls,fdkat8r,t1_fdk52a2,"This.  And most people don’t ride lightweight bikes on the highway, typical smaller bikes are Ninja 250s or Suzuki SV650s.  Which two people are not going to just casually lift into a truck.  And unless you have straps, I wouldn’t even let you try - not going to lay the bike on it’s side just to get gas.  Even a 125 is going to require a lot of sweat and effort to avoid damaging things, and the story would be describing the drama.  

Sorry to be skeptical of such a nice story, but...."
ChungoBungus,fdjd1k2,t3_elmy5y,"I used to have a shitty motorcycle, broke down all the time. 
One time I was in a parking lot, trying to pop-start my bike when this old dude comes up and teaches me how to pop the clutch and push start my bike.
I'll never forget that dude."
Kingnahum17,fdj9e2d,t3_elmy5y,"Another motorcyclist here. I am a daily rain, shine, or snow rider. I happen to live in an area with an over abundance of TERRIBLE drivers. To the point where almost everyone on the fence about riding didn't start because they firmly believe they would get killed by a driver. A daily occurrence for me is to almost be hit by someone, and a weekly occurrence is a near miss (99% of these being completely the other drivers fault). 

Aside from that I've also been in this woman's shoes. The crazy part was that I \*should\* have had enough fuel, but my bike ran out of fuel 100 feet from another biker in the exact same situation. We were able to piggy back off a gallon of fuel someone brought him, which was enough to get to the next gas station, however while you're sitting there with a thousand people passing you, everyone you text telling you they're busy, and the occasional driver flicking you off as they pass for the simple fact that you're a motorcycle rider (some of them aiming for you while you sit there), you tend to lose faith in humanity.

So long story short, good on you OP. Many people feel similarly to her, and it's fantastic people like you who show us that there are still decent people left in the world."
Mayuzumi,fdj7cec,t3_elmy5y,"Great Job OP! Same thing happened to me yesterday too!

My scooter gave up on me yesterday and was walking it home yesterday. My house was an hour away if I walked. A motorcyclist asked me whats wrong and offered me to help push using his bike. Saved me a couple minutes going home. Hoping to do the same someday!"

I was listening to the podcast on Spotify, was really into it, then told my coworker what I was listening to. She decided to try it. When we both finished, we were so into the case and couldn’t stop talking about it. 

Then we listened to [“The Devil was Watching.”](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6O7lbyGAjLxlxl7TooqLrC?si=Kcspf4XkRkaWr0QKz2infg) The case was so interesting that other coworkers were intrigued. They decided to join in.

Cipius,fdwjsdn,t3_en8jsm,I didn't realize Dateline was available as a podcast. Yeah it is always striking to me just how bizarre some of those cases are! Human beings are truly capable of incredibly strange and horrifying behavior! And you would think if you are going to do something as dramatic as to murder someone you would at least PLAN a little better! But they always seem to make the most obvious and ridiculous mistakes that get them caught!
chuckit7642,fdwpuhe,t1_fdwjsdn,"But some murderers were so clever. Like in “The Devil was Watching,” nobody would’ve known where the body was if the killer didn’t confess. I love these OMG moments when I listen to Dateline."

Stitch_Rose,fdxobox,t3_en8jsm,"I’ve been through all the Dateline podcasts episodes and there are some absolutely bizarre and interesting cases. 

My personal favorites and descriptions from the Apple Podcast app:

* **She Never Left** - “A missing mother in Jacksonville, Florida leaves behind a three-year-old son, whose memory of their last night together offers some clues as to what happened to her. The case remains cold until two decades later when the son, Aaron Fraser, solves the mystery that haunted his childhood. For the first time on network television, Aaron speaks out...”

* **Reckless** - “Lead detectives and family members speak to Dateline about the case of teenager Michelle Carter, who was convicted of bullying her boyfriend to kill himself...”

* **The Overlook** - “Two young women are shot and left for dead on a beach in Texas. After one miraculously survives, she is determined to find out who the attacker is. When a young man is eventually convicted, the long road to justice seems to be complete until a stunning twist raises a question - could the wrong man be in prison?...”

* **A Deal With the Devil** - “In this Dateline classic, Keith Morrison reports on a notorious serial killer, nicknamed Hannibal, who murdered several people while working as a confidential informant for the FBI...”

* **A Villinous Plan** - “A Connecticut bank executive is targeted by a crew of criminals who invade his home, take him and his mother hostage and order him to rob his own bank. If he doesn’t commit the crime, they threaten to blow him up with a bomb strapped to his waist. Investigators think it looks like an inside job but after a string of similar crimes in Tennessee, they learn the victims were picked based on social media posts...”

* **Unraveled** - getting too lazy to copy descriptions 

* **Death Trap**

* **The Match**

* **Deep in the Woods**

* **The Prussian Blue Mystery** - if you’re interested in toxicology, this is a great one 

* **The Thing About Pam** - has it’s own podcast

* **The Pink Skirt Plot**

* **Deliberate Evil** - this one is wild"

They now have a spin off for cold cases.  It’s called the murder squad.  Hosted by Paul Holes, former cold case investigator, and Billy Jensen former true crime journalist focused on unsolved murders.

They use the podcast and website to get public help for cold cases.

recklesschopchop,fdxfihk,t1_fdx6jrs,It's a show that reports and retells true crime stories. If you are into murder investigations and missing people cases it's suuuuper interesting.
chuckit7642,fdxfixv,t1_fdx6jrs,It’s a show about various criminal investigations
Miccar120,fdxavwd,t3_en8jsm,That's great.  Beats sitting around diddling on a cell phone.
mhopkirk,fdxjp9b,t3_en8jsm,This is awesome. I just found the Dateline podcasts recently and I am flying through them
chuckit7642,fdylp18,t1_fdxjp9b,Which episode is ur favorite?
mhopkirk,fdyx1qt,t1_fdylp18,"I liked the one called ""Deliberate Evil"" -It really kept me guessing

Also I tried one called ""Halloween Party"" and I couldn't finish it. Usually these stories don't touch my heart that much and I remain sort of detached, but this one seemed so preventable and the victim was the same age as my daughter"
saltyhumor,fdxrbgf,t3_en8jsm,"Curious, where do you work that this is possible? My last couple jobs (an office and retail) I couldn't have focused on work and a pod cast. My current job is in a factory and I could totally listen to a podcast."
chuckit7642,fdylew2,t1_fdxrbgf,I’m an electronics technician in a factory.
cranberry58,fdzuj9j,t3_en8jsm,That’s a good one!  I lose track of which show did what but a favorite of mine is the woman in politics who drops dead and it was her husband the nurse.  And they figure the guy killed her husband who was in the hospital too.  She was going to divorce the sick husband so she started hanging out with the male nurse because she figured what the hell.  They think male nurses killed husband so she would get the money.  Male nurse then marries her for said money but hates her and then kills her.  He gets the money with no wife.  He lied and lied but you could tell he was full of crap.
Paul_Blart_Mall_Fart,fe0b95j,t3_en8jsm,"Yea some of the episodes involved some of own my victims actually, so it was interesting to listen to from that angle but yea Dateline can be addicting for anyone I imagine"
pandooser,fe5pyit,t3_en8jsm,I started watching the old episodes after reading this post the other day. Thanks for pointing these out! My husband and I are really into them.
chuckit7642,fe5xihv,t1_fe5pyit,They’re very captivating. I’ll look for them on YouTube as well.
pandooser,fe5xyuy,t1_fe5xihv,If you use roku or a streaming service they have a bunch of them on NBC's streaming channel.

partypancakesbacon,fdxyd49,t3_en8jsm,Very cool!

chuckit7642,fdz49vl,t1_fdyw3ps,Yea! And we get so excited to discuss these episodes lol.
cranberry58,fdz9t0o,t3_en8jsm,"Sounds fascinating.  It would be fun to hear all the different opinions.  I watch it with my mom because, at nearly 96, true crime is her passion!"
chuckit7642,fdzt83c,t1_fdz9t0o,What is your favorite case? I frequent r/unsolvedmysteries and I watch “Cold Cases” on Netflix. My favorite case so far is about a woman who [staged her own kidnapping. ](https://www.jacksonville.com/news/20190916/quinn-gray-saga-story-behind-ponte-vedra-housewife-who-faked-her-own-kidnapping)

chuckit7642,fdzsvju,t1_fdzp4n2,Head over to r/unsolvedmysteries or maybe u can start your own “club” with your coworkers. It’s really exciting for us lol
mermaid831,fdzue7r,t1_fdzsvju,Thanks! I will try to.
twentyfivebuckduck,fdzv94k,t3_en8jsm,I love to watch dateline! Where can I get the podcast?

notAsoreloser,fe094ya,t3_en8jsm,My colleague and I do this with casefiles too. We sit next to each other and both have to pause at the same time if we need to leave our desks. It’s funny looking over and giving eyebrow raises at shocking parts
chuckit7642,fe1u57r,t1_fe094ya,Lol same here!
Helpful-Character,eof2dx,top_level,"Last year I went to a board game cafe for the first time and played Avalon. Friend of a friend’s brother and I (who I had just met, no less) were on the evil team, communicated telepathically and COMPLETELY masterminded 6 other players. I was incredibly excited, super proud of myself and him, and many expletives and very unsportsmanlike trash talking followed. Then this really sweet guy came over to us and was very gently like, “hey guys, I genuinely love how much fun you’re having and how enthusiastic you are, but so there are a lot of kids around here and you’re being really loud and swearing...” I was pretty mortified. I totally didn’t register how obnoxious I was being in a public place. 

Cut to today, some high school kids are top volume in an incredibly tiny bubble tea establishment. I definitely have done my fair share of stuff like that when with friends but it was seriously ridiculous, and swearing and talking about pretty heavy stuff right next to a young kid who looked super uncomfortable (maybe for unrelated reasons but still). Bonus, they had some of the worst opinions I’ve ever heard (They were dragging their transgender classmate for apparently defending cops because “cops would beat the shit out of her, ever heard of Stonewall?” They had a point in that that kind of brutality is still an issue but if MLK were alive today I think he’d tell you that civil rights can advance a lot in 50 years)

Anyway... even though I secretly wanted to drop kick them into orbit I was just calmly like hey guys... this place is tiny... there’s a kid right here... maybe take it down a notch. I was probably still more passive aggressive than I needed to be but I think before that guy I would’ve just been like “shut up you turds” or said nothing at all. So thank you for being a super cool adult and teaching me how to conduct myself in society without humiliating me. I think if you’re a good person getting politely called out is sufficiently embarrassing on its own"
TimeTravelerNo9,fecg4rq,t3_eof2dx,We kinda had a friends reunion in a restaurant last weekend because we don't see each other very often and all of us together even less often. There was a family with kids at the table behind us and I kinda felt bad because we were swearing a lot but I didn't say anything because those friends are not rednecks but they are mechanics and stuff and I don't want to know how they would have reacted if I told them to stop.
Helpful-Character,fechcqt,t1_fecg4rq,"Haha mechanics!! Nice. Idk, minor social “crimes” like that are so not a big deal, like kids have to go outside and they’re gonna hear that stuff for sure. I think it becomes uncool based on proximity/volume of the profanity/graphic discussion. But regardless of the extremity of the offense I think a casual suggestion to hold back isn’t out of line at all. If my mechanic friends had a problem with it I would tell them to stop being macho assholes, act like grown ass men and put the children first"
Woodstock5747,fecvekv,t1_fecg4rq,"People and tradeskills are pretty rough and tough, but honestly, we respond better to input when it involves other people then most of society because we are in true service positions. We dont stop and ""shut up"", we just adapt and continue on."
craftish,feczyd7,t1_fecg4rq,"Do No Feel Bad For Swearing In Public.

If a parent brings their child to a public restaurant, they are accepting the risk that their child will hear curse words, see drunk people, overhear arguments, etc. It's not on you to help parent the child.

That parent might give you the 'stink eye', but that exposure is on them. If you want a ""safe for your kids"" place, you go to D&B because it's so loud, or you go to Mickey D's or Chuckie Cheese.

If people around you bring their kids to a place that isn't kid-oriented, do no feel bad for cursing or being loud."
summit462,fecss0c,t1_fechcqt,My friend this seems to go against the premise of the post.  Might I encourage you to speak respectfully with your friends even when they disagree.
EmpireAndAll,fecwtq7,t1_fecvecm,"Regardless of what time period we live in, there will always be curse words. Certain words fall out of use or are used so much they aren't considered curses anymore, and new ones will take its place. The concept of 'words we shouldn't say around polite company' will never disappear. So there will always be words that are rude to say where others can hear you, even if you don't think the words are rude or not."
Helpful-Character,fecuakt,t1_fecss0c,that’s just how I/probably most people talk to their close friends bro. Like I think most people are candid and emotional with their friends and polite or at least placid toward strangers
Leakyradio,fecxrmg,t1_fecwtq7,"But am I not allowed to curate the words I choose to use in my day to day?  My personal conversations are not for others, and when out in public, others need to understand that just because they may have more sensitive sensibilities, the world does not bend to their will."
Caligecko,fecxzzs,t1_fecxrmg,"Sure, just don’t be screaming out bad words when you’re in public and there’s no problem."
EmpireAndAll,fecy23t,t1_fecxrmg,"That's life, for both sides. If you say something they don't like, they might say something you don't like back."
Leakyradio,fecy8vz,t1_fecxzzs,"There’s no such thing as an objectionable “bad word”. That’s my point.

Others don’t get to define what is and isn’t “bad” for the individual. 

You can’t go into public and expect to control the actions of others. You can speak up about it, but ultimately the decision is their own."
Leakyradio,fecy52w,t1_fecy23t,Which I am ok with.
Caligecko,fecyi2i,t1_fecy8vz,"There’s a lot of words that society deems as bad words. Just because you don’t think so doesn’t mean most people do. So, you being in the minority, be polite."
Caligecko,fed0bas,t1_fecy52w,It doesn’t seem like you are. You’re a troll then?
Leakyradio,fecysqz,t1_fecyi2i,"Quit telling me to be polite as if I’m rude, or doing any of the above mentioned actions. I am speaking hypothetically to the philosophy of free speech and social norms.

I’m sorry your sensitivities do not allow for others to personally chose how they want to express themselves. You don’t get to decide what “polite” is. You don’t get to control others. Do you get that?"
Leakyradio,fed0gb8,t1_fed0bas,"I am honest. I just don’t engage honestly with asshole busy bodies like yourself. 

You act all tough online, which is a sign of weakness in your personal life, and expect me to not laugh at you? Good luck with that one. 

Your issues start, and end with yourself."
teaintheafternoon,fecywto,t1_fecysqz,You are speaking utter bollocks and you are rude.
Caligecko,fecyyx0,t1_fecysqz,I get that you feel like acting like an asshole is acceptable. Be a better human.
Leakyradio,fecz8db,t1_fecywto,"A rare teetotaler. 

Congratulations on your scarcity."
Leakyradio,fecz69e,t1_fecyyx0,"You understand very little, that’s apparent. 

Do you understand how rude you are being, in your pursuit of wanting no rudeness?"
storgorl,fech712,t3_eof2dx,"The board game shop guy did a great job. I like to use a compliment sandwich, like -good point- followed by -this needs work- followed by -encouraging remark- when one of my employees needs a minor correction. It works well to keep everyone happy."
isworeidnevercomment,fecjmfb,t1_fech712,"As a newly promoted supervisor, I am writing this excellent shit down."
BluRupee,feclfzn,t1_fech712,"I suggested that concept to my manager when I was hired, he said it didn't work because an employee will only retain the good thing and ignore what they need to work on. I know he's wrong but it really fucks with my head to be around him.

It's also the formula for giving art critique as well, fun fact, so I know academically it is a proven winner in how to give criticism."
IngeniousTulip,fecp5rp,t1_fech712,"I actually don’t love the compliment sandwich because after you have used it with someone, if you ever just want to encourage them or tell them they did a good job, they will then be waiting for the other shoe to drop. 
I prefer a straightforward, “We need to have a conversation that might be difficult.” or “We need to talk about what happened yesterday.” And then separate conversations telling them why they are awesome."
SerendipityHappens,fecoith,t1_fech712,Fuck. Thanks for reminding me how to deal with my inept coworker. Compliment sandwich. Gonna work on it.

WhippetingWhippet,fecwjat,t1_feclfzn,"Man, your boss just isn't right at all, everyone knows if you get 1000 compliments and 1 critique, the critique lingers way harder. Maybe your boss just isn't being clear"

BluRupee,fecwq00,t1_fecwjat,"He's weird. Not very humble, doesn't seem very forgiving of mistakes (even tho he makes them)... I have a host of complaints from just a couple months of work. I am altogether glad it's just a seasonal job and I'm moving on to better pastures soon."
palekaleidoscope,feckzh3,t3_eof2dx,"Good on you for saying something! I was at a pool a little bit ago with my 5 year old and there was a group of teenage guys there tossing a ball around. They were so loud and obnoxious, lots of swears. So after one really loud “did you FUCKIN’ see that?!” out of one of them I stopped and said “hey guys, can you watch your language, this is a family pool and there’s lots of kids around” as I gestured to my daughter. I’ve never seen such red, embarrassed faces. Lots of mumbled “sorry” . They were quiet after that. Like, I don’t want to be THAT MOM but you’re in a pool with a toddler splash park so maybe tone it down. And I get there were probably times when I was a teen and was beyond obnoxious in public and if I had had a few words like that spoken to me I would be conscious of it ever more."
Helpful-Character,fecm3j8,t1_feckzh3,"Yeah I think being a teenager and trying to navigate a social situation requires so much of your brain power that you literally have no self awareness!! But yeah I agree, I never wanna be “that guy” and I try to have a pretty damn strict live and let live policy so it always takes a little extra push to speak up. And if I’m being completely honest I’m definitely partially motivated by that sweet taste of vigilante justice... and those tasty upvotes"

Rymdkommunist,fecq5vf,t3_eof2dx,You say they have the worst opinions and then directly after say they are right lol
Helpful-Character,fectuy8,t1_fecq5vf,I guess my beef with it was that the girl was expressing an opinion about something that she would have first hand knowledge of and being like “actually you’re wrong because of this event that reflects the social climate 50 years ago”
hagolu,fecw5lu,t3_eof2dx,"Dude seeing the title, I thought they rudely told you to shut up but the polite kindness can somehow even feel more brutal. Good for you to take that as a learning experience."
Wight_Fox,fecwsnw,t3_eof2dx,"It's small gestures that seem to change lives. It sounds like that man left a very positive influence on you, and has made you a better person for it. I totally approve of the way you approached the situation! I frequent a game shop myself quite often, and we sometimes get players who can be rather loud and racy when there are children present in the store. A gentle hand makes sure nobody feels alienated and keeps everyone coming back for fun."
Jack-7-1-0-,fecr2np,t3_eof2dx,"polite call outs are the worst because there's no brute force exit you can take without making the situation exponentially worse, so personally i love them they're super effective"

suburban_hyena,fecsmcj,t3_eof2dx,"yay, politeness!"
Woodstock5747,fecvmrc,t3_eof2dx,"It's funny how you worded it that you used to be like them. This is what most people are saying when they tell someone to calm down. It's not that they're pissed at you, but you are being disruptive to the environment you're in and disrespectful to the people around you. It's good you learned that you don't go to the extreme and challenge someone when you don't like their behavior but just make them self aware instead.

The internet especially conflates this with being an ""apologist"" but the truth is, you're just an asshole when you act like this."

somethindum,fe6wy2h,t1_fe6w0gl,"I’ve definitely been there more times than I can count (for example, a few hours ago!). I hope life cuts you a break soon<3"
Error_506,fe7uwul,t1_fe6w0gl,"Trust me you’re not alone here, but there’s a Les Brown speech ([easy to watch version ](https://youtu.be/Skh33Bjuj88) ) that helped me turn around my perspective. Every difficulty is a chance to grow and improve as a person and so I look at it now as rather than, “dammit universe why me!” but “Alright another test and another opportunity to better myself!”. I was riding a bad streak for about 14 months and it took me a while to adopt this mentality but ever since I did I’ve been a lot more optimistic! So best of luck!"
PainGiverInHell,fe6wppi,t1_fe6w0gl,"Sadly I agree.

It's got it in for me and has a good laugh at my expense regularly."

menicknick,fec0w6c,t1_fe73yjj,"Yeah, no.  Last year I lost a baby, my mother and my wife’s best friend may have cancer.  

Nothing about that needed attention.   I wanted to be a father and I want my mom back. 

Fuck cancer.  Sometimes life just sucks.  Hard.  And I’ve learned that it’s ok. 

But I still miss my mom.  I can’t believe I’m going to have to live the rest of my life without her.  I can still hear her voice saying “call your mother.”

Call your mom if she’s still around. Mine was pretty great."
lilkitty33,febtkod,t1_fe7xx8a,Thank you! Didn’t realize it was today haha
lilkitty33,fec1upu,t1_fec0w6c,"Wow. I’m so sorry for your losses, these are incredibly sad and unfair circumstances. I definitely don’t believe the universe is fair, it’s not meant to be that way. But when faced with the ultimate lows that human life can bring, we can either crumble or somehow become stronger in a way. It’s much certainly easier said than done, but I believe that our souls have the power to transmute even the most traumatic and painful experiences. You sound like someone who has learned this first hand. And I will definitely talk to my mom tonight. ❤️"

radiochef,fe74iq3,t3_eo1py4,"I read that as ""university is tryin to cut you some slack"". My uni allowed a girl with depression to come in late for almost 3 months. I was really amazed by their kindness considering the shit food they serve us in the canteen because they are so miserly."
McMetm,fe6ws9i,t3_eo1py4,"This time last year in west Australia  I got into the habit of diving into the ocean and saying ""thankyou"" as I went under. It confused me for a bit because I'm not religious in any way and I had no idea who I was thanking. Then I reconciled this conundrum by realising that I was thanking my own capacity to feel and give thanks. Prolly doesn't make any sense to anyone else but I've kept at it. I've only seen snow 3 times in my life. It certainly is beautiful."
nick2938,fe6xp5g,t1_fe6ws9i,I think its definitely good and healthy to realize how lucky we are to experience things as the chances of even being alive and being able to experience life are astronomically small. Ive done similar things before and it really does make me happier.
Spinningwoman,fe8olbk,t1_fe6ws9i,"There is something profound (interesting use of word since it literally means deep) about being underwater. I get it even in a swimming bath. I’m a very poor swimmer and have never been diving or snorkelling, but there is something about moving into the silence (or relative silence) of the completely separate underwater world that hits me in a spiritual way. I can absolutely imagine how free divers get addicted to the feeling."
somethindum,fe6xlfp,t1_fe6ws9i,"Makes sense to me! That sounds really quite beautiful. Maybe you should be a poet! I can’t imagine only having seen snow three times, but then again, I can’t say I’ve EVER dived into the ocean; an item for the bucket list perhaps?"
McMetm,fe6xn8o,t1_fe6xlfp,"Absolutely, definitely dive into the ocean."
DntMindMeImNtRlyHere,fe7zjn5,t3_eo1py4,"I feel like it pushes me just about as far as I can go without breaking, then it gives me gifts. 

It makes me stronger, though. Like, ""Hey, you survived all that last shit, here's a cool new friend!"" Or ""Yeah, you passed that last test, so here's a hobby for you!"" 

It's like it tests my gangster every time, then gives me the dopest people and hobbies and activities and events and memories ever to compensate. 

So see it as a gift and a win - you passed the test and now you get a prize!"
Reapr,fe8enrq,t3_eo1py4,"Nope, but it does lul me into a false sense of security sometimes just to come back with ""ha, you seriously believed that?  Loser"""

It seems as if maybe I might get a little slack this year because I've proved that I can ensure and come out the other side. I'm a little tired and need it. First time post."
Bookwormhere,fe8wn0d,t3_eo1py4,"I know it sounds crazy, but it starts raining whenever I'm having an episode. My boyfriend dumped me on 8th Jan and it started raining out of nowhere? In this very chilling winter? I wouldn't have believed this either but I have to since I did experience that."
prpslydistracted,fe8zlee,t3_eo1py4,"The thing to remember is life is cyclic ... I'm old, and there were some *terribly* rough times that started in childhood. There are days like you describe and then others that are unspeakable.

But just hang in there. Whether you're at the bottom of the trough or riding high on a wave things will change ... it's life. None of us have guarantees one way or the other. We do the best we can with what we've got.

Been a bit depressive myself, laid off from work so my working days/hours are very irregular, can barely pay my bills, both my vehicles are broken down and I'm driving a loaner from my FIL, and my basement flooded over the weekend when my sump pump went out.

The universe scoffs at my current struggles and doubles them."
invinciblesummergirl,fe9jyss,t3_eo1py4,"This is a lovely idea :)

I have felt the same thing. It's gonna sound silly, but I live in a rural place and it's really hard to find good internet out here. Like the speeds are so slow you can't do anything beyond email. But then just by chance I found this company that provides internet to RVers, and they're so nice. The internet works brilliantly and it's SUPER FAST, and the customer service people were beyond friendly. And I just can't believe that everything has worked out. This has been a thorny job on my to do list for ages, and then one day, boom, it just fell together. 

Of course, I've also had experience with the opposite, where it's like the universe is kicking me while I'm down. 

Hopefully that won't happen a lot in 2020!"
-totallynotanalien-,fe9sy7b,t3_eo1py4,I’ve had a rough few 12 months but 3 months ago I met the most amazing guy. He’s long distance but he’s literally like an angel. Like my luck in life has been so bad so far I ask him all the time if he’s real because I can’t quite believe how lucky I am to have him.

greffedufois,febi273,t3_eo1py4,"There have been some neat coincidences in my life. 

After my grandma passed (just 11 months after my grandpa) I asked that she and grandpa send me my soulmate so I could be happy like they were. 
Shortly after I met my husband. 

I used to have a horrible cat allergy and after my transplant it disappeared. Kept all my other allergies and gained a few new ones. But hey, now I get to have kitties and we have 3!"

zerofoxtrot72,fe7paxa,t3_eo1py4,There are beautiful blessings and miracles all around us. Sometimes life gets us too busy to stop and notice.
Spinningwoman,fe8pjfo,t3_eo1py4,"Interpreting the universe that way seems to be healthy and life-giving.   Maybe it’s better to have a meta-story with hope in it than one where everything feeds your depression or anger. Maybe that’s just good self care. Or maybe it’s even a hint that there is a twist in the universe towards goodness, if we give it a chance."
PerrinDreamWalker,feak9ax,t3_eo1py4,"So, nobody cares about this, but this is my story.

About three months ago my girlfriend broke up with me, I started trying distract myself by drinking and going to a lot of strip clubs( is it right to call it that?), for unhealthy amount and spent a lot of money. That plus it being winter and myself being seasonally depressed it was miserable!

I had a great Christmas tho, My friend and his family invited me to celebrate with them!

I was trying to get in to college again( my ex encouraged me)  but they were not able to process my application on time due to a lack of sufficient document and it taking way to long in to the Christmas’s break, I talked to my friend and they told me to pester them. And last week on Wednesday I went and started bothering the addition office. On Thursday, I got the email which told me that I was admitted, I got immunized and  finished my Fafsa on Friday today li went to the campus and registered for class( today was the first day of class and I was able to make it to one of the classes. 

I was feeling a little sick yesterday and it got really worse while I was driving from class to work, so I turned right and got in to an urgent care clinic. I’m waiting for my results right now and the doctor thinks it’s either strep or the flu and I might get the next two days off work!"
shadesofpink44,feccyuk,t3_eo1py4,"Once in undergrad I started having a panic attack in the middle of lecture so I got up and left and when I walked outside, there was the most incredible double rainbow I’d ever seen.

DemonDoc88,fea5hyh,t1_fe6l774,"I really appreciate you and I don't even know you. I'm super new to reddit and I was wondering if I emailed you, if you could help me out on some stuff that's depressing me (nothing financial or anything, ) I just want to explain it in private and you could maybe help me navigate the specialists on Reddit that have the skill I'm lacking in that's causing my major depressive state."
chassischuck,fea84p4,t1_fea5hyh,Definitely dm me and I will give you my email
Cherryking_,fe6p6jr,t3_enotvs,"The timing of me seeing this is amazing, thank you so much for posting this!"
bobbynatie,fe7ckwk,t3_enotvs,YouTube just gotta love this sie of reddit
Jane9812,fe7e215,t3_enotvs,Thank you. I feel like I'm on the cusp of an anxiety attack and that deep breath helped. Cheers
PDiddyWreckingBall,fe7ilb5,t3_enotvs,Thank you
furballfrank,fe7jk4y,t3_enotvs,Thank you that is just beautiful. Love it. Heart is filled. You’ve got it too.
notnicolai,fe7xy2q,t3_enotvs,"Simple words hit differently when you're feeling them. Thank you, OP."
Balanced-Breakfast,fe8if1u,t3_enotvs,Thank you. I'm having a rough morning.
Candy-Cide,fe5l477,t3_enotvs,That's not true
Racunri,fe5n6i7,t1_fe5l477,"It is, if you give yourself the chance to become okay and reach a better place, to do that you’re gonna have to go through hell sometimes, but it does get better, just, keep, moving, even when there’s no clear end in sight, because often you’ll find you’re way out of a dark place on accident along your journey."
Candy-Cide,fe6287o,t1_fe5n6i7,You must understand that it's not as simple as that right
Racunri,fe62wsh,t1_fe6287o,"Elaborate, I was pretty broad in my statements, what’s simple about removing self doubt calming your anxieties and continuing onward through whatever is taking you down."
Candy-Cide,feaea49,t1_fe62wsh,"I mean sure everyone says it hard but not impossible and stuff like Oh you'll get through it.  However, it's of no use to say that.  It won't help them through this.  They just have to find their own way.  Plus advice would be more useful"
Racunri,feahbdn,t1_feaea49,"I mean, maybe it doesn’t help you in particular because we’re all different, but I know it helps me get through stuff to hear affirmations and such, and obviously I’m not the only one. It’s essentially bringing oneself back to reality so you can get back on your own path and pull yourself out of your head. That’s what I was going for because that’s what I know I need sometimes and most people got that out of it."
Candy-Cide,fecadgn,t1_feahbdn,Telling someone it's fine will make them better but it won't make the situation better.  It will probably make the situation worsen because they will think it's alright and take no action
Racunri,fecclt2,t1_fecadgn,"I made this post for myself and people like myself, my anxiety and depression will stop me from taking any action then when I get these affirmations it gets me back on track, it’s the same with a lot of people. It’s literally a whole genre of asmr. I’m not sure why you’re so hell bent on  disliking the post, it’s clearly not for you that’s okay, just move on."
dhardwick51,fe663bi,t3_enotvs,Thank you. Seriously. I want to have sex with my ex but I know I need to cut that connection.
schnappsbooze,fe68jzv,t3_enotvs,Thank you. :)
-Izaak-,fe6fnve,t3_enotvs,"I hate to be that guy, but I would refrain from telling people that it's all in their head. I can see that you're trying to show people that their problems can be resolved etc. but this sucks to hear if they aren't resolvable."
Racunri,fe6g5xr,t1_fe6fnve,"My bad there maybe I wasn’t clear enough in how I stated it, i don’t mean all your problems are in your head but when you’re depressed or anxious it can feel like the world is closing in on you and every little inconvenience feels huge and world ending, I was targeting that specific feeling for being in your head."
genuinehuman1,fe6gerv,t1_fe6fnve,"No one can promise anything. Not even the most trustworthy person. Just because someone said everything is going to be ok, they never **promised** that it will always be ok."
Racunri,fe6g9fy,t1_fe6g5xr,things aren’t actually always as bad as they seem to be in the moment and such
-Izaak-,fe6mypy,t1_fe6g5xr,"I know you were just doing your best to be benevolent and I don't want to discourage you from doing that, but when you're talking to someone who's really down you don't necessarily want to minimize what's going on. It's better to help them acknowledge that they're experiencing something bad so they don't blame themselves for feeling bad."
-Izaak-,fe6mrte,t1_fe6gerv,"That's not the point. Sometimes, especially if you're working your way through to accepting something you previously felt was unacceptable, you need to hear that the problem isn't all in your head and that things are as bad as you think they are so you can stop blaming yourself for feeling the way you do."
genuinehuman1,fe7b2xl,t1_fe6mrte,"I get your point. But it's also important to talk to someone, but there's people that think people wont try to help them out; that he'll or she'll be alone because people might make fun or her for being imperfect and insecure. 

They are blaming themselves, yes, but are they seeking help? Some are. Others, not so much."
Darnitol1,fe8mm3q,t3_enotvs,"I'm normally the guy saying what you're saying. Last night I confronted my wife because she's being paying less and less attention to me and finding more and more time to spend with her mother, daughter, friends, and social media. I don't begrudge her any of these relationships, and I don't in any way suspect that she's cheating. But in short, I told her that I feel like I've become somewhat of a ""side note"" in her life. Her response was to let me know that she doesn't have any more bandwidth left to give me, and that if I needed more ""attention"" then I should seek it from friends. Meanwhile, I'm dealing with a slowly progressing neurological illness that's causing me to lose control of my arms, neck, and legs. I suspect she's not eager to live the life that's probably ahead of us.

I have never posted a personal problem like this online. I showed a strong face to her, but I'm about to fall apart. It's not all in my head, but thanks for the sentiment. Your concern is appreciated, but please be considerate enough to know that sometimes it's misguided."
dirtydallas40,elj7ce,top_level,"I must have done something right of good because my teenage girls still like to hang out with me and go places together and we text sweet and loving messages everyday, they are amazing and wonderful and I love them so very much and I guess I am an ok Dad."
llilaq,fdic26u,t3_elj7ce,"People seem to really exaggerate how horrible teenagers are. My girl friends and I always had good relationships with our parents. If you raise them respectfully/lovingly there's a good chance you'll get through those teenage years just fine. Good job, dad!"
dirtydallas40,fdicv2z,t1_fdic26u,Yeah I think they do...because knock on wood my girls are angels compared to me at their ages and we have very close relationships and thank you so very much :D
C_T_Robinson,fdk4yll,t1_fdicv2z,"Idk, my mum did her best raising me and was always loving, however as I grew up I was very determined to have agency over myself and inevitably ended up often locking horns with her, which eventually led to me choosing to go live with my dad, our relationship has now recovered and I truly appreciate all that she's done (and still does for me) however I do feel that our conflict was somewhat inevitable.

I think for some parents (at least for my mum) that love can sadly fuel the conflict, because as teenagers grow and seek (sometimes prematurely) independence, the parents want to protect and help their children, however that can be misinterpreted by the child as the parent undermining their free will.

I was so convinced as a teenager that if I had children I'd do it differently and would avoid falling out with my kids at that age, but now that I'm a young adult and have gained some perspective and understanding of what truly loving and caring for someone is (not that I didn't love my mother, but it's easy to take your parents for granted as a teen), I really appreciate what a difficult journey it must be to navigate from being responsible for every aspect of your child's life to gradually reaching a stage in which you let them go into the world without you being there to care and protect them from it."
dirtydallas40,fdkebwg,t1_fdk4yll,Life and love are not always easy to navigate but I have always tried to do my best to understand and hey when I am wrong I own it and say I was wrong which I believe my girls appreciate
C_T_Robinson,fdkfab1,t1_fdkebwg,"Admitting that you're wrong to your children is a really big move on your part, it's taken me until I was 20+ to hear my mother say she may have been wrong about saying/doing/handling some things, it was always so upsetting to be always lectured about how I had to admit I was wrong sometimes and couldn't pass off responsibility when I never heard the same coming from my parents. You sound like a real good parent, I wish you and the fam all the best!"
dirtydallas40,fdkg1je,t1_fdkfab1,"I freely admit I make mistakes, do things wrong and have flaws and my daughter's know this because we communicate freely"
Sabrinacolada,fdifwr2,t3_elj7ce,"I was a very bad kid. My parents used to taunt me saying “JusT WaIT UnTiL YoU HaVe KiDs ThEy WiLL Be 10 TiMes WoRsE”

I can’t tell you how many times I heard that. My folks honestly thought that my offspring were conspired with them somehow to punish me for my wicked ways. I admit i didn’t want kids for this reason. 

Then I had 2 boys. I did everything the opposite of what my parents did and guess what? Zero issues. They are a blessing and my best friends. The teenager survived divorce but since we handled it correctly he turned out fine. 

If you simply respect them and give a shit and treat them like humans parenting is a breeze. 

My parents don’t say that shit anymore. Lol"
dirtydallas40,fdihkz2,t1_fdifwr2,"Lol absolutely, and quite similar to yourself and if you respect them, love them and give a shit it goes fairly smoothly"
DaemonOwl,fdir2d7,t1_fdifwr2,"Ah my parents used to say that alot

Hope it works well for ne"
Sabrinacolada,fdisr60,t1_fdir2d7,Listen I’m becoming convinced that anyone who says that parenting is hard either isn’t doing it right or is just trying to get sympathy.
AliCracker,fdjb2c3,t1_fdisr60,"It is hard is many ways though - I worry about my ladies constantly, even though they’re solid, better versions of anything I could have hoped for 

Parenting them is easy, but I want the best for them, and those are the things that keep you up at night - the worry that they’ll be okay and happy, and find the things that give them joy 

That and hoping they have a world to inherit - it’s all a bit fucked up at the moment"
spongecake6,fdieah7,t3_elj7ce,"Good for you man. As a teenager myself I can’t imagine having a relationship like this with my parents. Don’t get me wrong I have shelter, food, and clothing but you really sound like you’re killing it"
dirtydallas40,fdiek7h,t1_fdieah7,"I try my best to be the best dad that I can be, I never had my dad in my life so from that I wanted to do the best I can ( and no I am no perfect but I do the best that I can )"
ifeellikethrowingup,fdiynlg,t3_elj7ce,I am a daughter who grew up with an absent father and a horrible step father. Thank you for showing your girls what a real man is! Aww this makes my heart full.
dirtydallas40,fdiyugk,t1_fdiynlg,"I am happy I can make your heart full and thank you so much...I never knew my father either, big hugs from me to you."
temporarybeing65,fdiseve,t3_elj7ce,I was always told rebellion was normal but our daughters always were loving and sweet also.
dirtydallas40,fdisqkt,t1_fdiseve,"Lol I was the rebellious and wild one, my daughter's not do much lol"
temporarybeing65,fdisu8t,t1_fdisqkt,Mine are 28 and 30 and text everyday so we’re lucky
Mimihop,fdifhgt,t3_elj7ce,Haha I don't why I thought you were the mom. XD well that is super awesome as a dad to have that ! Lucky girls and lucky dad
dirtydallas40,fdih7do,t1_fdifhgt,Lol that is too funny and yes lucky all around for sure and thank you :D
sublimewitch,fdiz6sg,t3_elj7ce,"This made my heart feel so full. I think just treating them with respect and understanding allows the relationship with them to be more open and trustworthy.

I don’t have this relationship with my parents and no one in my family really expresses love for each other (not saying my parents don’t love me lol,  it was just never a thing to say I love you or really hug one another). 

I’ll be 22 this year and while I appreciate all my parents have done and continue to do for me, I can’t wait until a few years down the line when I can have babies with my boyfriend and grow up to be the type of parent you are!

Edit: I’m laughing because I said grow up as if I’m not technically already an adult. Maybe semi-adult"
dirtydallas40,fdizv3x,t1_fdiz6sg,"I love that my daughter's and I text and say I love you's and we hug, not as much in public where a friend might see lol too funny on the semi-adult"
LobeliaWisteria,fdifpeg,t3_elj7ce,That is awesome! I really really hope I can have the same thing with my daughters. How did you do it?
dirtydallas40,fdihegb,t1_fdifpeg,"I hope that you can also, I am not sure it was any one thing, just creating a closeness and bring as loving and understanding as possible amongst many other things"
LobeliaWisteria,fdik4un,t1_fdihegb,"Thanks, that's what I try to do!"
dirtydallas40,fdimyu7,t1_fdik4un,Which is awesome and wonderful
VI_Mermaid,fdiuejx,t3_elj7ce,Good job Dad! This made me smile.
dirtydallas40,fdiui8b,t1_fdiuejx,Thank you so much and happy to make you smile :D
LegalEye1,fdiz9p0,t3_elj7ce,"Congratulations. You hit the jackpot! I've got two of them too, and sometimes it can feel like I'm walking in a minefield with a blindfold on."
dirtydallas40,fdj024j,t1_fdiz9p0,Lol only like a minefield when they are around each other too much and start being catty with each other
ms_eleventy,fdizsmi,t3_elj7ce,I hear ya! My teenage daughter really likes me also. Our relationship is the thing I am most proud of in the world.
dirtydallas40,fdj0hsj,t1_fdizsmi,"Absolutely, I am so proud of my relationship ( a friend of my youngest said she wished she had a relationship with her dad like the one we have, that made me happy )"
antihackerbg,fdjekea,t3_elj7ce,I'm a teenage son and I don't have the best relationship with my parents. I do love them but they're just stressing me out a whole ton.
dirtydallas40,fdjl162,t1_fdjekea,I had a very similar feeling with my mom as a teenager
antihackerbg,fdjlcgl,t1_fdjl162,They're stressing me out because I'm in 7th grade and this year we have the big exams which basically decide your future.
dirtydallas40,fdjli4n,t1_fdjlcgl,Do the best you can on your exams and do your best not to be stressed out about your exams or your parents and good luck :)
antihackerbg,fdjltyy,t1_fdjli4n,Thanks.
dirtydallas40,fdjm3rg,t1_fdjltyy,You are so very welcome :)
LoveAndCats,fdjgbcp,t3_elj7ce,"I was a nightmare because my parents expected me to be. When I was sad, angry, or upset? It was just blamed on me being a teenager. No comfort, being helped, or shown love. I could hear them talk shit about me behind my back in the kitchen to their friends. Making me sound like a spoiled brat because I cried when I broke my phone, when in reality I cried because I felt super guilty since they spent so much money on it for me. 

Thank you for doing it right, we need more good people like you"
dirtydallas40,fdjl667,t1_fdjgbcp,"Thank you very much, because I had no father and not the greatest relationship with my mom as a teen, I needed to be the best dad I could be"
sevnthcrow,fdiz17z,t3_elj7ce,Yay you! Good dads are priceless
dirtydallas40,fdizgnf,t1_fdiz17z,Thank you so very much :D
LilLexi20,fdizefx,t3_elj7ce,That’s awesome. Having a good relationship with her father is so important for a teenage girl. Wish it was something I could have had
dirtydallas40,fdj0ar5,t1_fdizefx,"Aww so very sorry you did not have that, I did not have a relationship with my father which in term made me try to be the best I can be for them ( I have lots of flaws and I make lots of mistakes but I never stop showing them love )"
trollfucker69,fdj1lu1,t3_elj7ce,"My dad gets me flowers every year on Valentine’s Day and we quote movies together all the time. He’s labeled as Captain America in my phone. 

Dads that do it right are the BEST"

trollfucker69,fdj2e2m,t1_fdj26pi,Lol he forgets my birthday is Feb 23 all the time though bc I was due on the 27th. But he’s 59 so I’ll give him some slack. He was around before time was invented so he’s still not totally used to it
dirtydallas40,fdj2jkc,t1_fdj2e2m,"Lmao that is way too funny, made me smile and laugh"
timetothethird,fdj33zl,t3_elj7ce,Was there anything you learned about girls from being a dad that you didn't expect?
dirtydallas40,fdj3nm6,t1_fdj33zl,Just that I got to really understand the love of a dad/daughter relationship
imsaneinthemembrane,fdj50gw,t3_elj7ce,"An ok dad?!

You're an incredible dad and you all are so very lucky to have eachother. Growing up I didn't know that kids had good dad's who loved them and showed it."
dirtydallas40,fdj5bas,t1_fdj50gw,"Thank you so very much, growing up I did not know it either and I would say it made me better because of it"
imsaneinthemembrane,fdj5hk2,t1_fdj5bas,"I feel the same, it took a long time to appreciate my experience. I have a father who shouldn't have stuck around but did. Now that I have boys I cannot fathom treating them the way he treated us, he definitely helped shape me into being a decent mom in his own way!"
dirtydallas40,fdj5mwv,t1_fdj5hk2,"I totally feel and understand this, I am sure you are a fantastic mom :D"
imsaneinthemembrane,fdj6073,t1_fdj5mwv,"I try!
Hope I'll be able to brag about my relationship with my boys when they're teens :)"
SomePerson32123,fdj8nz6,t3_elj7ce,Such a wholesome dad. Teenagers are just regular people too and their behaviour reflects off of their parents' behaviour. You're doing great! Keep at it!
dirtydallas40,fdjkvoh,t1_fdj8nz6,"Thank you so very much, yes indeed they are"
AliCracker,fdjapiy,t3_elj7ce,"Aww!!  How lovely was this to read - what a lovely post 

As a mom of two teenaged girls, I had prepared for the worst, and then they are both just... well, they’re both just awesome?  This was a part of parenting teenagers I was not prepared for!  

Stay honest, stay open and get involved in the thing that gets them up and moving every morning 

Sounds like you’ve got this all under control!"
dirtydallas40,fdjkzvy,t1_fdjapiy,"Thank you so very much, absolutely it is key to stay honest, open and be involved and to let them know you love them"

InfiniteWasTaken,fdjhndf,t3_elj7ce,As someone who didn't have such luck to have some good teenage years I really appreciate that you did what you did. I wish your family the best and thanks you for being there for them.
dirtydallas40,fdjldc7,t1_fdjhndf,"Thank you very much, I did not have great teenage years myself and wanted to be the best patent I could be for my girls"
InfiniteWasTaken,fdjlk3b,t1_fdjldc7,"I am sure you are ine of the best. I've heard that being a parent is a challenge itself but being a good one and keeping them close is an even greater challenge. I know they're in good care. Keep being you friend. I feel that my words may be a little ""intrusive"", and I apologise, but I apprciate a mistake being corrected and not repeated."
dirtydallas40,fdjlo5w,t1_fdjlk3b,"Thank you so very much, and I will do my best to keep being me and grow to being an even better me for me and my girls"

Askaram,fdjkugs,t3_elj7ce,"I was a terrible kid/teen. But still, I love my parents and I would do anything for them. You're an amazing dad! And yes, teens can be hard, but if you love them, they'll love you back!"
Starkville,fdkkz85,t1_fdjkugs,"Thank you for this comment. We are having a *terrible* time with our teen daughters.  We’re told there’s light at the end of the tunnel, but damn. Trying to infuse every interaction with love, hoping it’ll work."
dirtydallas40,fdjlfwf,t1_fdjkugs,"Thank you so much, I was that tough child and teenager at times. Absolutely if you love them, they will love you back"
Askaram,fdmu661,t1_fdkkz85,"I'm glad I could give you somewhat kind of hope. Yes, I remember when I was a teen, I made my parents life HELL. Got aggressive, never came back home, alcohol abuse etc. But I was reliefed when my parents still loved me. I never hated them, no matter how hard I made it for them to love me. I loved them and I still do, I just had such a hard time and didn't know what to do. I bet you guys are amazing people and you're doing whatever you can."
Benja_014,fdjny7g,t3_elj7ce,"Glad to read that!, i've always thinks that people have normalised that a relationship between parents and teenagers are complicated, stressfull, and always involucred discussions and sometimes resentment, but it's not normarl, yeah, it's daily, it's common but not normal, i gues you just understand what means to have a relationship. keep it that way man, the world needs more persons like you;)"
dirtydallas40,fdjo2we,t1_fdjny7g,"Aww thank you so very much, I have never been a perfect friend, son, co-worker, brother or Dad but I be the best me that I can :)"
thickcurvyasian,fdjpwcn,t3_elj7ce,High Five Dad! I wish my dad wanted to hang out with me when I was in my teens. I like them both tho. My dad just didn't have the parenting gene.
dirtydallas40,fdjvkbw,t1_fdjpwcn,"Thank you very much, aww I wish that he did too"
ncconch,fdk2ap4,t3_elj7ce,Good job! I only have one daughter and we made it through her teen years pretty remarkably as well. My daughter will be 23 soon and we are still close. She is still my concert-going buddy (she loves getting close to the stage and catching guitar picks) and we go to NASCAR races and college games together.
dirtydallas40,fdk35kj,t1_fdk2ap4,Aww that is awesome and wonderful and good job to you too :D
Reapr,fdk3b1l,t3_elj7ce,"There are people that remember being a kid and then there are those that don't (or refuse to).

I've found that people that do remember tend to raise their kids in a sane fashion and as a result end up with sane kids, teenagers and eventually adults.

My wife is one of those that doesn't remember, I do. Many fights ensued about raising kids, but I won her over in the end.

Our teenage daughter was incredibly sweet, had maybe two little 'snippy' events throughout her whole teenage years, but in comparison to some of the horror stories I've heard, she was an angel.

So OP, do you remember being that age?"
dirtydallas40,fdkdzvp,t1_fdk3b1l,Absolutely I remember being a teen myself and try my best to remind myself of that as much as possible
Reapr,fdkk3ry,t1_fdkdzvp,That's awesome. I really think that has a lot to do with it. The old 'treat others...'
ill_guap0,fdk4z07,t3_elj7ce,"This gives me hope because I have 2 lovely girls (7 and 4) that adore me, but I've been dreading the teen years. I always make sure that they are heard and that they know I love them. I'm also very respectful in my interactions and use ""please and thank you"" like I would with an adult. I hope that all sticks."
dirtydallas40,fdkefyn,t1_fdk4z07,That is how I am and always have been with both my girls and it has stuck which is wonderful

iamtheneek,en6u13,top_level,"So yesterday I was at the bar and it was pretty full, no seats available, and this elderly man comes in, starts to look at the seats for a while  and the football game that was going on and I simply just stood up and asked if he wanted to join me. We shared opinions and laughs troughout the whole football game. Guess a friend is really someone whom you’ve never met. Just wanted to share this with someone"
Undark_,fdvigb9,t3_en6u13,"I used to love being a bartender because I was the bit of social interaction that some of the older regulars got. There was a widower who used to come in with his dog and his paper, nurse a half pint for an hour and then leave.

After I started working there, he would nurse his half pint for an hour and then order a second one to sit with for another hour, sometimes if it was quiet and we had more time to chat, he would get a third :) I used to love talking to that old man, he was one of the nicest people I met and had such genuine love in his heart. I hope he's still doing okay, I don't work there anymore. Got fired for being late despite being the only member of staff who gave a fuck about the older regulars.

Look after the old, it's very very important."

Undark_,fdxyc8x,t1_fdwvhcs,Yeah I miss all those old guys tbh
Undark_,fdxyaso,t1_fdwlzjs,It's something we say in the UK :) just means sitting with a pint for a long time
Lynda59,fdzfjpd,t1_fdxyaso,We say that in the US as well.  At least in the midwest.

00sheven,fdvormf,t3_en6u13,"Isolation and lack of social interaction are both HUGE detriments to the health of the aged population. Lots of really elderly folk have lost their friends, and may not have the support of their family nearby. Venturing out alone can be extremely stressful and difficult, especially when everything seems so fast-paced and impersonal. The loneliness and lack of \~casual conversation\~ can really take its toll, you did a really awesome thing OP!"
iamtheneek,fdvppqr,t1_fdvormf,"It was just hard for me watching him standing there, i couldn’t help but to invite him over. The fact that this conversation could make his whole day, would make my whole week, and it did!! Was a really nice guy, and he loved to talk!"
smaestra,fdyi02n,t1_fdvppqr,"Almost 40 years ago, I was in a spa in Florida by myself and saw an old woman with crutches and braces on her legs trying to open a heavy door.  I asked her if I could help.  She smiled.  She was waiting for her friends.  I held the door for her and we started to talk. Since I was alone, I asked if I could join her and her friends. She said sure. We found seats together while waiting for her group.  As we started to talk, I said where are you from? She was from Brooklyn, New York. I said oh I was born there. We lived with my grandparents when I was little.  She asked me for the address, and when I told her her eyes filled with tears.  She said, “My doctor!”  My grandfather’s office had been on the first floor of his house.  She recognized the address. She asked about my grandmother. I told her my grandmother only lived a few blocks from the spa. I called my grandmother and told her I had met an old friend of hers. They got together. They hadn’t seen each other since my grand father passed in the 1960s. This was 1985. They were thrilled to see each other again. Now that I’m old, I understand even more  the importance of that conversation.  Your story reminded me of that experience.  Sometimes a conversation with a stranger can be more important than we will ever know.😊"

ThankYouSincerely,enogaf,top_level,"It's not significant enough to talk about it much to people around me, and nobody else saw so it doesn't really matter all that much but I thought it was pretty neat. 

Have you guys ever seen something cool with nobody around to tell about it?"
JoyousZephyr,fe2x3ko,t3_enogaf,"I saw a wasp flying straight up after landing on a lily pad. At a certain angle, I could see the drop of water she was carrying, and then she dropped it.  I saw. it. fall.  This solves the mystery of why, every now and then, a small drop of water can splash on you even when there's no visible source. No one in my life cared."

I still entertain them with pictures and trivia because I can't contain my excitement :)"
ThankYouSincerely,fe3rwl9,t1_fe3h5br,I study as an ecologist so I'm fascinated by that stuff!
JoyousZephyr,fe453i4,t1_fe3h5br,PILEATED WOODPECKER!! I desperately want to see one. I live just a little too far west for them.
MurgleMcGurgle,fe6j7ru,t1_fe3h5br,I had no idea pitcher plants grew that far north.  I always assumed they were warm climate plants.
lovelyb1ch66,fe3u8ka,t1_fe3rwl9,"Ha! Did you know that the gray ratsnake will when threatened imitate a rattlesnake by coiling up and whipping its tail, even making the rattling noise even though it doesn't have rattles?! They're endangered in my area (southeastern Ontario) due to habitat loss but also due to being extremely chill & laid back making them easy to kill by ignorant people but also prime roadkill material because they move so slowly."
lovelyb1ch66,fe46dgp,t1_fe453i4,"Omg they are gorgeous! I was sitting in the woods reading a book when one landed on an old pine a few feet away, it didn't see me so just went about its business, I didn't dare breathe out of fear I'd scare it off lol They're huge!!"

effggghhg,fe2r0sa,t3_enogaf,"This afternoon I was driving and an ""elvis"" helicopter flew right over me, planes and choppers fly over me a lot cause I live in a small town with an airport but it was particularly cool to see the elvis so close.

Another time that sticks in my memory was when I went bass fishing at midnight and there was some sort of comet or something that had left debris in the upper atmosphere or above the atmosphere. The full moon illuminated the strange looking sky and when I got to the fishing hole there were 2 large mullet milling about in circles together on the surface in the moonlight. It looked like something out of a dream or a painting."
4kicksOhio,fe31yef,t3_enogaf,"I didn't see it, but I did hear a tree fall in the Forest.  No big deal but it was cool because it was just nature being nature.  No one else around, no lightning, just an old tree(?)."
BitOCrumpet,fe3bkwt,t3_enogaf,"That is very cool! I love those small miracles in the sky.

Mine is a fireball. I *always* wanted to see a fireball, and this was in my smoking days, so I was outside the house every hour or so. Just standing there, smoking, and I saw an amazing light-green fireball streak through the sky, heading west. It was wonderful, and no one could understandmy excitement! It was just before the peak of the August meteor shower, dusk-ish. Can't imagine if it had been dark!"

willgiffotron,fe5unfm,t3_enogaf,I saw a shooting star go across a full moon once in my telescope but as I’m the only one in my family up at 1 am using a telescope I had to quietly enjoy it.
Undark_,fe60ql6,t3_enogaf,"I was walking my dog in the countryside once.

We came to a creek and I saw a massive crane perched on the railing. It was perfectly still and didn't even seem to care I was approaching.

As I got closer, it spread its massive wings and silently floated down the stream, along the tunnel created by the canopy of the trees along the banks.

I can't adequately describe it, one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen or probably will ever see in my life."
CletusP,fe6ed8c,t3_enogaf,"I was driving to work one night around 10pm, and saw an amazing sight. It looked like a comet falling through the sky, only a short distance away. Turns out it was a meteorite burning up as it entered the atmosphere. 

It was green, with a  sparkling tail. I googled it and learned that it was filled with mercury/copper which is why it burned the colors it did. 

It dissipated after about 3 seconds, but is still one of the coolest things I have ever seen."
ThankYouSincerely,fe6ob8b,t1_fe6ed8c,"Oh my goodness. Almost ten years ago a buddy of mine and I were stargazing late at night, and we saw something trail the sky in a brilliant green light; the trail even seemed to linger for a moment. We have always speculated that it was a meteorite, but never had an explanation for that bright green. I've never met anyone else who has seen that, so it's really cool to read your comment!"
wxstcoast,fe36lx0,t3_enogaf,Can I ask what type of telescope you would recommend for someone wanting to get into stargazing? It's been on my mind for a long while but I'm not sure where to begin!

Kaylors,en6dxo,top_level,"Geeky, socially awkward, intensely passionate about dinosaurs (I never was but I did feel passion back then), I really rooted for Ross. Every time he and Rachel broke up I’d be like “Whyyyyyyyy????”

Now, rewatching the show as an adult, I’m like: “Rachel honey, you’re worth ten of Ross, stop letting that loser back into your life.”

She has such a beautiful growth arc from being a bumbling rich daddy’s girl to becoming a strong independent woman, that I’m in awe.

And Ross...yeah, he’s a loser. Jealous, overbearing, inconsiderate, and kind of a hoe. Why Rachel ever got back with him I don’t know.

She’d have been infinitely better with someone else, or heck even just by herself."
Veer-Zinda,fdvfxhl,t3_en6dxo,"Unpopular opinion, so bracing for downvotes, but I always thought Rachel and Joey were a better match, and Ross would be better with Charlie.

I thought Joey's arc would have been more interesting to see him become the kind of man he looked up to his father for being initially - a family man, settling down and sticking by them, no matter what. He was so protective of Rachel when she was pregnant. He would have been a great dad and the two of them had much more in common, I think.

Ross was an important part of Rachel's life and will always be, and that would have been interesting to see too. An intimate friendship with someone you accept as not being compatible for a romantic relationship.

Loved the show regardless, but still... 🙂

*Edit: Wow, thank you for all the upvotes and the silver award! 😃 That was unexpected!*"
celestialviolets,fdvrevx,t1_fdvfxhl,"I agree with Joey and Rachel, I always felt they were a better fit. Joey was so sweet when that stranger was in labour too, it definitely would have fit his character. 

Also fuck Ross. You don't own her."
natxi,fdwfdcn,t1_fdvfxhl,There was that one where Joey and Rachel try to be romantic and Rachel keeps slapping Joey out of reflex when they try to kiss
VeryAngryBubbles,fdwqm3e,t1_fdvfxhl,"Joey should have ended up with that woman who was giving birth at the hospital when Carol was having Ben, and then the father of her kid turned up when Joey came with balloons ☹️"
samusgamgee9009,fdwmwih,t1_fdvfxhl,"That would have been an interesting direction for the show but I’m so glad it didn’t go that way.  

Joey would’ve been miserable in a long-term relationship. 

Also, Joey and Rachel would’ve had historically dumb children."
justdoinmybesttt,fdxhypf,t1_fdvfxhl,I would have loved Joey and Rachel together except for the fact that the show tried to downplay Rachel's intelligence while pushing the Joey/Rachel storyline.
keaneavepkna,fe2ettr,t1_fdwqm3e,you know that was Leah Remini right?
Grayboot92,fdvyds3,t3_en6dxo,"Everyone should have moved to Paris, Monica, Chandler, Rachel, Gunther, ugly naked guy, Janice, Carol, the whole lot. Just not Ross. 

Ross has to stay in NY and think about what he’s done."
Kaylors,fdwd433,t1_fdvyds3,"Yeah, he needs a very long timeout. I wish ugly naked guy would get his shit together and become hot naked guy again. He was once and I believe he can be again."
OhTheStarfire,fdv572b,t3_en6dxo,"Might be a dumb question, but perhaps the right thread in which to ask...

What's so good about Friends? I've watched many episodes, but I've never found it funny or even mildly entertaining at all. What do you like about it? (Not being condescending, actually curious)"
Kaylors,fdv5sqg,t1_fdv572b,"Right now it’s a nostalgia watch for me. I don’t find myself enjoying it as much as I did when I was young. If you’re watching it as an adult that could be the case.

When I was young it was easy to not think about everything wrong with the people in that show and just enjoy the gags. Same with How I Met Your Mother."
indigo_tortuga,fdwzwrq,t1_fdv572b,"These days it's nostalgia but back then I watched as a teen dreaming about how I'd have this core group of friends and we'd all hang out and have fun and support each other. After a while when my grown person mind realized how unrealistic not only their lives but their friendships were I had already invested a lot into the show and just wanted to see how it ended.

As an adult I understand why they do it but any show where a bunch of non family members hang out all the time is so unrealistic it pulls me out of the show."
seetler,fdwkxb9,t1_fdv572b,"Didn't find it funny growing up when it was on tv. 28 now, moved to a large city, met many girls, been in relationships. Now it's funny. 

All the good jokes are relationship and sex based."
GunnarRunnar,fdweuqc,t1_fdv572b,"At the time, I found it genuinely funny. I guess there wasn't anything better on TV, now that I think about it? At some point, I got so invested in the characters that I watched just to see what happens to them. Kinda like gossips but fictional. My friend being really obsessed with the show enforced my enthusiasm as well.

But now I don't think I'd enjoy it anymore. Haven't watched an episode in ages, so maybe I'd still enjoy it but probably not. It was a product of its time, as people like to say."
yankykiwi,fdvlpa5,t1_fdv572b,"With only three channels, I didnt have much of a choice back then. Anyone watching now, must be for nostalgia."
desde1984,fdyt73e,t1_fdv572b,"Just to cement your point, watch it without a laugh track. You will see how unfunny this show actually is."
anxious_ibex,fdwltw8,t1_fdv572b,"The humor is starting to age and it's a poor reflection of NYC for people who are supposed to be in their 20s. There was like 1 black character in all ten seasons lol.

There are some funny episodes but a lot of the show is the same running jokes and hinges on a very sexual audience to enjoy non jokey plot"
yunivor,fdwuimx,t1_fdv572b,"I liked the characters a lot, they were all interesting and played well off each other so I wanted to see what would happen to them next, who were they gonna end up with, how they'd solve the current problem they were going through, etc.

They were also at the same time very well defined and flexible, it was easy to associate people in real life to a character from the show and even the title 'Friends' incentives this, any friend you had who's a bit of a control freak and too preoccupied with cleaning and organizing was Monika, every friend you had who was kinda weird but genuinely a good person was Phoebe and so on but at the same time it was easy to stick them in almost any situation which made it easy to have many episodes without the show writing itself into a corner."
rektengle,fdx4tnt,t1_fdv572b,I like it- I get paid to watch it.
OhTheStarfire,fdv616f,t1_fdv5sqg,"That's so true. I used to watch Veronica Mars when I was young, and I started re-watching it recently and stopped...just wasn't as interesting. I guess tastes change hey?

What are you into nowadays?"
Glamdris,fdwt722,t1_fdv5sqg,HIMYM is awesome.  Even as an adult though.  Since you know going in he's gonna botch it all the time till the final few episodes of the series.  Takes a lot of pressure off.
indigo_tortuga,fdx00rx,t1_fdv5sqg,Himym is the WORST!
yunivor,fdwnxo9,t1_fdweuqc,"I feel very similarly with House, at the beginning (mostly the first season) I was interested in how he was going to solve the case and enjoyed how he interacted with the rest of the hospital staff (specially because he was the first 'grumpy asshole as a main character' that I saw) but for the entire rest of the series I was interested in how the characters evolved and where they'd end up and barely noticed the medical cases they were working on."
OhTheStarfire,fdz0749,t1_fdyt73e,"Yeah I have done so. Or just even ignoring the laugh track.

I observed a friend watch Friends, and he laughed every time there was a laugh track. I was so nonplussed."
OhTheStarfire,fdz0izy,t1_fdx4tnt,Paid how and why?
showmewhatyougot37,fdwtay5,t1_fdwd7zl,">intelligently written dialogue

lol"
Kaylors,fdv7tel,t1_fdv616f,"I don’t watch much, actually. I kinda have trouble shutting my brain down, most of the time and I get very very restless watching new stuff.

So I just rewatch old stuff while knitting. I feel like those two activities go together well for me. Rewatched Avatar, the Legend of Aang quite recently. Then started on Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Also interspersing with episodes of The Witcher so that when people around me are talking about it I’m not completely out of the loop.

But yeah, not really watching anything new, otherwise."
Kaylors,fdx0flr,t1_fdx00rx,I hyperbolically agree.
keaneavepkna,fe2f5np,t1_fdx00rx,every character is insufferable except Marshall
rjestrada73,fdylpfs,t1_fdwtay5,Why would you want your blue blazer black? You’re stuuupid! Hahaha It’s a moo point. It’s like a cow’s opinion. . .it doesn’t matter. It’s moo!
celestialviolets,fdvqygd,t1_fdv7tel,"I have trouble with this too, I really struggle to calm my mind down enough to enjoy something new. 

I'm rewatching Avatar at the moment as well, and I'm really enjoying the nostalgia kick. It's also quite an emotionally mature show, which I didn't get as a kid but really appreciate right now."
whotfleap,fdw7jdy,t1_fdv7tel,"I just finished watching Avatar: The Legend of Aang. It's a masterpiece of a show. I started watching Legend of Korra now, its alright not near Legend of Aang though."
vj_raj,fdvhkgo,t1_fdv7tel,"If you watch anime, I'll recommend 3 shows: hunterxhunter, my hero academia and one piece(simply the best show there is to watch)"
Kaylors,fdvrddo,t1_fdvqygd,Right? Watching it as an adult is a real treat. Emotionally mature is a good way to put it.
Kaylors,fdw8yjn,t1_fdw7jdy,I agree. Kora’s okay but she’s no Aang. How far into the show? Have they revealed the origins of the Avatar yet?
Kaylors,fdw6wzy,t1_fdvhkgo,"I’ve heard good things about all three. I even read One Piece up to a point (city in the clouds comes to mind). Thanks for the suggestions :)

To give one back, Natsume Yūjin-chō."

Kaylors,fdwctj8,t1_fdwbr0k,"Okay, I’m not gonna say much coz I don’t wanna ruin things for you."
Voktikriid,fdv2u2r,t3_en6dxo,"I didn't actually watch Friends until I was an adult, so I caught on to Ross's niceguy complex pretty quick. He's a pretty crappy person, but so are the rest of the friends, with the exception of Joey."
Kaylors,fdv5o09,t1_fdv2u2r,"Yeah, I really came to appreciate Joey’s childlike enthusiasm for things and general sincerity. He is such a good friend."
BuckeyeBikeNHike,fdv7m30,t1_fdv2u2r,Well have I got a spin-off for you.
NFSpeed,fdx4yse,t1_fdv2u2r,What’s so wrong with chandler? Hell even Monica is a bit of a tightwad but she’s not a bad person. Phoebe isn’t bad either just annoying imo.
Joodropinn,fdv8n12,t1_fdv2u2r,Joey is a creepy pervert
xxxnina,fe2a8c0,t1_fdx4yse,"Chandler and Phoebe weren’t bad... maybe chandler’s commitment issues or something is what they’re thinking of but he worked on it and even if he didn’t, it doesn’t make him a bad person. 

Phoebe could be annoying but she was great because she was self aware enough to call others out on there behaviour but also support them and just lived her life how she wanted to regardless of what people thought."
Whalerage,fdvbd1g,t1_fdv8n12,aren't the other 5 as well?
Joodropinn,fdvcl77,t1_fdvbd1g,"Not as much as he is. They’re all annoying in their own way, once you watch a few times"
snake944,fdvb22y,t3_en6dxo,"Friends without the laugh tracks is great. Ross comes off as a self aware creep, Joey is exactly the same but without self awareness. And chandler is just a snide idiot"
KittyLoverUndercover,fdwb3dc,t3_en6dxo,"Okay but what about Phoebe? I think she's the most annoying character. She always needs to be the centre of attention, og often brings others attention to her by mentioning her mum's death - in every completely unrelated situation. It drives me crazy."
Kaylors,fdwcx78,t1_fdwb3dc,"I mean, she can be annoying, sure. Ross is just emotionally unhealthy."
rosenwaiver,fdzytad,t1_fdwb3dc,"I love Phoebe. Whenever she talked about her mom or her past, it was never to get attention. To her, it was just a casual piece of information. That’s why it was funny. She didn’t take it as seriously as everyone else did."
thetrailblazer11,fdxbokn,t1_fdwb3dc,"I could never understand the people that say Phoebe is their fav character, same with Ross...I just can't relate at all"
Coffeemombie,fe070sq,t1_fdwb3dc,"The joke is her upbringing was so dysfunctional/crazy that those things don't phase her, which is why she's nonchalant about it. The other characters are from more normal upbringings so they can't relate at all. It's kind of just like some dark humor thrown in there... You either love it or hate it."
kc1328,fdvx45s,t3_en6dxo,"I was thinking the exact same thing. 
I used to watch friends steadily and in reruns just after it ended flash forward 10 years and it's kinda popped back up. Back then (and even more so now) Rachel was my least favourite character, there was something too self absorbed, stuck up ? about her, I liked Phoebes quirky charter way more.

But Ross, I kind of identified wit Ross back then but now, what a passive aggressive douche. Very annoying. I would add passive aggressive to your list of his traits.

Of course I was probably like that then which is why I identified with him then and hate it now.

I cant watch fiends, guess it's too 90s for me."
indigo_tortuga,fdwyu29,t3_en6dxo,"I dunno. I really liked Rachel alone personally.

I also didn't like how dumb they made her by the end of the series. She and Joey practically needed special services it's ridiculous how stupid they were."
helloFriend747,fdv9ioh,t3_en6dxo,Preach
idk420_,fdwcqtv,t3_en6dxo,Ross is cool but as a couple Monica and chandler are better

Lucky for me. And BIG UP to my wife."
xandarthegreat,fdymyzn,t3_en6dxo,"Some meme somewhere was like “Don’t ever date a Ross or a Ted Moseby” because even though they’re the main characters they’re very needy, arrogant etc. and honestly I get it."
TheStupidWanker,fdvvmet,t3_en6dxo,I just think that Ross is just an unlikable character overall. He's a bad version of Ted Mosby from How I met your mother
nicken_chuggets_182,fe03mvg,t3_en6dxo,"While I agree with your points about Rachel’s progression, I don’t agree that she’s in a position of “she’s worth so much more.” She was equally responsible for the relationship being crappy. I think she was as immature and addicted to the drama of their relationship as Ross and kinda narcissistic. Besides that, they were a terrible match. They had nothing common whatsoever. It was just writers/creators and the audience wanting to believe that the nerd can get the prom queen and cheerleader, which doesn’t happen 99.9% of the time."
Phoebird,fdwecf4,t3_en6dxo,"I always liked Phoebe because of her weirdness. I don't know why but I love weird characters. Luna of course is my favorite character from HP.

But yeah I'm probably a Ross."
starlinguk,fdybqml,t3_en6dxo,Ross is such an emotionally abusive asshat that I've stopped watching it.
wanderingnim,fdybtt3,t3_en6dxo,I thought they belonged together because they are both total assholes.
Mr_82,fdyedxo,t3_en6dxo,"Both Ross and Rachel are pretty terrible. Chandler, Monica, and even Joey are decent people."
Teh-Voice-of-Reason,fdzk9k8,t3_en6dxo,How I Met Your Mother is basically a show with Ross as the main character.  He doesn't do too well with the ladies and I used to secretly hope in the finale he drinks a bottle of liquor and his children are shown to be a figment of his imagination.
Kaylors,fe0dpvc,t1_fdzk9k8,I’d pay to watch that ending.
rjestrada73,fdwcsrf,t3_en6dxo,You get me! I agree one hundred percent!!
maecutsh,fdva08a,t3_en6dxo,"Rachel isn't perfect either but I feel like they were perfect for one another. Ross is really sweet despite his annoying idiosyncrasies. I mean, he's her lobster! Honestly, I feel like Phoebe is the most well-adjusted character of them all."
Kaylors,fdvb15e,t1_fdva08a,"I’m not saying Rachel is perfect but I cannot condone Ross’s behaviour. Maybe I’m being too harsh, but if one of my friends acted that way, I’d not let him get away with it."
maecutsh,fdvbvql,t1_fdvb15e,"I can see that. I think he's a nice guy overall though. I felt so badly for him when Rachel ignored him and then broke up with him on their anniversary, when she accepted Joey's proposal, and when she consistently only seemed to like Ross when he was taken. She acted pretty awful at times. Also, when she wouldn't run with Phoebe! Lol."
anxious_ibex,fdwmvt9,t1_fdvb15e,"Ross is not that terrible lol.

His wife ditched him for another woman. Who he has a kid with. That would wreck anybody.

Being ""geeky"" isn't a bad thing. Last time I checked, it pays to be interested in what you do for work and actually have a career. 

He got Rachel pregnant. Their whole shit was a mess but he really just seems like he was a dorky brother Monica kept around and he wanted a solid romantic relationship. He just did dumb things to force that with a lot of his dates"
celestialviolets,fdvrvlo,t1_fdvbvql,"But if I were to date someone, and they carried on like Ross? Red flags everywhere. Dump him and run girl."
maecutsh,fdvv71m,t1_fdvrvlo,"Oh no, agreed! Ross isn't really my type. A friend, sure. I'm more of a Chandler kinda gal."
c1arabe11e,fdwv2cz,t3_en6dxo,Really I like Rachel but think she is pretty shallow. I think Ross could do better. And you should never marry someone who isn’t as smart as you are.
Kaylors,fdx0q2b,t1_fdwv2cz,I somewhat agree. Though at this point I’ll settle for a kind person who I get along with and who shares my values. Known too many smart douches (including myself) to care about that as a criteria.
Meewol,fdw2zoo,t3_en6dxo,Ross is an ass who waits for everyone else to fix his problems for him. I always waited in anticipation for “The One Where Ross Kills Himself” but it never came.
Sujetodeprueba,fdzw73d,t3_en6dxo,Okay but they were on a break
I-eat-bees-and-wasps,fe05im6,t3_en6dxo,read this while watching an episode of friends about rosses and racheals relationship
jaygod,elcks4,top_level,"This is my first post here, and I just kinda wanted to talk about this :-)

So my girlfriend and I started a diet in early November... well, less of a diet, more of a lifestyle change. We both started taking up running as a hobby, and we ran a 4K as well as a 5K in December. It’s been going better than I thought it would honestly.

I have her weigh me because weighing myself would always bring me down, and according to her I’ve already lost at least 20 lbs!! This is the first time in my life where I truly believe that I can lose the weight I’ve always wanted to lose, and for once I’m happy. It’s nice realizing that the road I’m going down is finally the correct one."
VonnieDeak,fdhheak,t3_elcks4,I just got on the scale and I’ve lost 7 lbs. Got about 60 to go. I feel better!!!
jaygod,fdhjal2,t1_fdhheak,Awesome!!! We got this!
Midnight_Moon29,fdj7nly,t1_fdhheak,5 lost for me. We can do this!
VonnieDeak,fdhjql3,t1_fdhjal2,The way I did it was to eat less and cut carbs
jaygod,fdhk0m8,t1_fdhjql3,Yeah that’s usually the best way. I haven’t been able to cut out carbs but I’m working around it haha
Man-of-the-lake,fdjz6s3,t1_fdhk0m8,It's tough. I found that when I reduced my white sugar intake I dropped a lot of weight. Unfortunately I started eating sugar again and gained it back with more.
JMK2804,fdgv7go,t3_elcks4,That's amazing! You should definitely be proud of yourself! Keep it up!
jaygod,fdgvp5m,t1_fdgv7go,Thank you!!
scotlandisbae,fdid67m,t3_elcks4,I thought you meant as in you lost a 20 pound note and then I saw more of it and I made way more sense. Well done my dude.
jaygod,fdidnft,t1_fdid67m,"Hah, another guy thought that as well. I’d be pretty alarmed if I was proud of losing money tbh.
Thanks man :-)"
Fr33Paco,fdigkiz,t3_elcks4,"20lbs is a good chunk of change, be proud brother. I've actually gained like 6lbs so I can see your reaching your goal."
jaygod,fdiipkn,t1_fdigkiz,"Thank you. You got it brother, there were PLENTY of moments where I gained back a shit ton of weight. What matters is how you bounce back."
Fr33Paco,fdiiqyi,t1_fdiipkn,totally brother.
tabookduo,fdijtyy,t3_elcks4,"That’s awesome!! I want to take my boyfriend on runs, but he absolutely hates it; I think I’ve convinced him to try it out, in the spirit of the new year :-)

Congrats to you both for making that lifestyle change and here’s to a healthy happy 2020!"
jaygod,fdime8b,t1_fdijtyy,"Thank you! Honestly you sound exactly like my girlfriend. I absolutely hated running, and 100% dreaded it, until I actually started. I realized it wasn’t so bad when I was actually doing it! The first month or so was pretty tough to get the courage to go running but after that, it wasn’t bad. My only advice is just be patient - if he’s anything like me then it sounds worse in his head. Just give em some time :-)"
tabookduo,fdinfuo,t1_fdime8b,"Good on you for sticking with it, and thank you as well, that advice/viewpoint will definitely help! It’s not too fair since I enjoy running, but I’ll make sure to have patience and probably let him get me back with some weightlifting sessions heh :-) Oh yeah now that you mention it, he is probably overthinking and dreading it, I can’t wait for him to (hopefully) have a great time especially since I have a nice route I want to share with him! Cheers!"
TheOptimusMaximus,fdgz90t,t3_elcks4,That’s actually so awesome! So proud man
jaygod,fdh2nm9,t1_fdgz90t,Thanks man :-)
MysticTeddy309602,fdh1c5m,t3_elcks4,"Dude you’re doing great! Keep up the hard work! I was 320+ and am now a healthy 250 working out and eating right daily so I know the big homie life is a struggle. Keep working and keep pumping your girlfriend up to do the same! Even if you think the progress isn’t showing, someone notices it every day."
jaygod,fdh2zvx,t1_fdh1c5m,"Thanks man it really means a lot, Im starting from a similar weight (345), it’s inspiring knowing that others have done what I’m trying to do :-)"
Zimbabw-e,fdhckeg,t3_elcks4,"Thats incredible. It's really inspiring that you call it a lifestyle change too, makes it easier to maintain. Congratulations!"
jaygod,fdicbj0,t1_fdhckeg,"I think that’s what makes this feel different for me - I stopped seeing it as a diet, and associated it with a change with how I’m going to doing things from now on. Thank you :-)"
Elrunningtigre,fdhe2m4,t3_elcks4,"Congrats man. Nothing better than feeling and looking good, for yourself and for others to appreciate."
jaygod,fdhj9b5,t1_fdhe2m4,"I’ve always been scared because I’ve worried about showing people my progress, then relapsing back to food, but this time feels different 😁"
oliversilverstone,fdhoe9i,t3_elcks4,So Happy for you and your girlfriend.
jaygod,fdhss0s,t1_fdhoe9i,Thanks :-)
RhinoR43,fdhpfrv,t3_elcks4,"Always be motivated brother, never lose focus so good shit on you for losing the weight."
jaygod,fdht1ib,t1_fdhpfrv,Thanks man. It’s been a long journey since I first decided I needed to lose weight - one thing I know is that losing focus is insanely easy to do. I appreciate it 🙏🏽
yvubib7g7gug,fdhqb6x,t3_elcks4,I tought you lost 20 pounds as in currency -.-
jaygod,fdht4v2,t1_fdhqb6x,"Nope hah, in the US :-)"
cbmurp3,fdi0txj,t3_elcks4,Awesome!!! Keep up the great work!
jaygod,fdic7c4,t1_fdi0txj,Thank you!!

jaygod,fdic4xh,t1_fdi68yr,Always 👍🏽
badpandaunicorns,fdi8hz2,t3_elcks4,You can do it! I on the other hand have begun making other people fat with baked goods.
jaygod,fdic6uw,t1_fdi8hz2,"Lawful evil, I like it!"
badpandaunicorns,fdicbk6,t1_fdic6uw,I can't eat it so I'll make others fat. Yea. Life plan. Bake more to be more of a dick.
jaygod,fdicj4t,t1_fdicbk6,"Shit that’s what I’d do if I was good at baking too. I could not be someone who sells baked goods, there would def be a few too many items missing due to delicousness."
badpandaunicorns,fdicq79,t1_fdicj4t,I just bake. It's not hard to. You turn on a oven. Throw some measured shit in a bowl and boom sweets!
mortymom,fdiwzj7,t3_elcks4,Way to go!
jaygod,fdizasb,t1_fdiwzj7,Thanks!
WildCricket,fdj2qcr,t3_elcks4,"25 lbs here! Feels so great, doesn't it? Feels like my body makes more sense."
jaygod,fdjrbrt,t1_fdj2qcr,Agreed! Funny how losing weight also improves mental health (for most people)
Numero_x,fdjo1e2,t3_elcks4,Keep up the good work! You've got this.
jaygod,fdjr8pu,t1_fdjo1e2,Thank you :-)
hitdatye3t,fdh0iw1,t3_elcks4,"I’m almost jealous considering it took me about 5 months to do what you did in only a few! Keep up the good work man, you’re killing it for sure."
jaygod,fdh2r88,t1_fdh0iw1,Likewise!!! Pounds lost is progress no matter how long it took to lose it :)
meso27_,eo5d2c,top_level,"After 1 failure, I finally did it with a score of 87! (80 minimum in New Hampshire)

I failed the first time because i went on a really snowy day, and the roads were not treated. There was an intersection with a railroad, and a stop sign. The stop sign was on my side of the railroad, and the stop LINE was 5 ft ahead of it! Since the roads weren’t treated, the line was covered in snow... I didn’t see it... yeah, immediate fail.

Despite my troubles, I did it, and am rather proud."
heart_brain_journey,fe8ow6u,t3_eo5d2c,Congratulations!
meso27_,fe8p1pt,t1_fe8ow6u,thank you!
HirizaKyo,fe91mos,t3_eo5d2c,You did it! Good job! Driving takes a lot of time learning the unofficial rules of the road so just keep being careful ♥️
meso27_,fe91rhi,t1_fe91mos,thanks!!
Jaas_z,febetxb,t1_fe91mos,"We are all driving a heavy machine and everyone who got their license in Finland is obliged by law to know this stuff. Not knowing even one of these things count as a major/medium fail in the written drivers test and the practical. One major causes you to fail and two medium causes a fail. Its not common sense by any means, these are things that are required by law to drive and more safely. Obviously there will always be the not-so-wise people that break the law but there is the police for that. If they aint there then just call them, give license plate maybe send evidence if you have and they'll deal with it. Simple as that. I'm saying that if this is common sense for you it's makes it the ever more so obvious that the teaching and laws are just so much more low quality than in Finland."
HirizaKyo,febjbzo,t1_febetxb,"Alright I'm not sure why I'm arguing with you if this was a congrats to OP but if what I'm saying isn't getting through, there's nothing more I can say idk what to tell you. Not everyone is from Finland?"
HirizaKyo,feb36ul,t1_feb1v08,"A super common one I learned I was being an asshole about was matching speeds with the person beside you accidentally. You either speed up or slow down so other traffic can go around you. Even if you're not in a two lane road, it's just common sense. 

Not sure if other places teach that tho. Where I went it was like ""Don't be a jerk bye""."
HirizaKyo,feamw2e,t1_feampzw,???????????? Ok
SuSaNaToR,feaw5ut,t1_feampzw,You do have to get creative when the roads are covered in snow and nobody can  see the markings.
HirizaKyo,feb8915,t1_feb4zy4,"Maybe I should have been more clear. 

You will see all kinds of weird situations in the real world driving. Your whole life driving and you will get in a situation where you're basically boxed in with some slower cars and this dude ahead of you going slow but matching the car next to you in the slow lane. 

It's illegal to drive over the speed limit and I'm glad you know that, but more than half the people out there are gonna go over and they're going to travel in packs. 

The best thing to learn on the road while driving is that other people are stupid. If you get dumb and reckless, then someone can and will end your car or your life in seconds. You're driving a machine. 

Give semi trucks a little more room than you'd give a car. Stay three car lengths away from the car ahead of you. Use your blinker. If you have to use your wipers, you turn your lights on. If you're behind cars or facing cars that can be blinded by your high beams, turn them back to normal. Don't get in front of a truck unless the full front is in your rear mirror. Check your blind spots over your shoulders. Triple check that your truck and gas caps are closed. Adjust your seat so that if you lay your arms out comfortably in front of you, the wheel is under your wrists. Do not lay on the horn for stupid reasons. If someone is being reckless, avoid them at all costs. Do not break check. Do not tailgate. Learn your right of ways correctly. Another unwritten rule is ALWAYS look left and right after your light has turned green (people are idiots). When merging into traffic, merge AT the speed close to the speed limit or match the traffic you're joining. Cut someone off? Give them a wave so they know you know you messed up oops. And never... EVER... Road rage."
HirizaKyo,febbyt9,t1_febbmnc,"They're not all unwritten rules! It's just all things that should be common sense but these are all things that I learned more from driving than I did in school. It was worth it. 

Unofficial rules are things universally accepted by drivers that are not in your handbooks or DMV tests."
HirizaKyo,febdc62,t1_febcpmu,"You're. Driving. A. Heavy. Machine. 

You cannot rely on other people to not be stupid. 
You can rely on yourself to be smart. 

That's literally it, dude."
OrangeZebraStripe,fe8uhyc,t3_eo5d2c,"My buddy took his road test during a snowstorm too. There was so much snow on the road they didn't have him parallel park, which was good because he couldn't to save his life."
GalaxyMageAlt,fe8yjbz,t1_fe8uhyc,"That was pretty lucky! I had the perfect weather on the day of the exam and fortunately the guy asked me to reverse bay park before the driving and I was so so glad because I would not be able to parallel park either (I mean I could give it a try, but I would defo make a lot of mistakes) and I'd be stressing out about it during the ride."
trashbox420,fe8srwf,t3_eo5d2c,Glad you tried again. And congratulations on this big step!
AndisBoBandis,fec3z5z,t3_eo5d2c,Congrats! I failed my first drivers test because I rear ended a parked car! So it could always be waaay worse

I made it too this last halloween and wrote about it here.

Somtimes I dont beliebe I achieved it. I tried it first 4 or 5 years ago but failed and gave up. I decided to try it again this year and I passed at first!"

ExperiencedGarbage,feby4mi,t3_eo5d2c,"Congratulations!! I hope you enjoy driving, getting my license absolutely changed my life, so much more freedom, and nothing is better than driving with my own music playing. 

Seriously, enjoy this:).

You're gonna feel super independent now and now you can go wherever your gas budget takes you. Also now you can be your friends sober driver 😁."
FilteredPerfection,feb93g4,t3_eo5d2c,"Congratulations! I remember the feeling passing mine years ago. It took me four tries, I thought I was a shitty driver and started accepting the fact I wasn’t cut out for the road. My instructor was stumped as to why I was failing too as he said my driving was fine. Then he asked me how much I gave the tester for my bribe and I said what bribe. He started laughing and said “now it makes sense”. He told me to “drop” a 50 on the center console for the next test and tell the tester I saw it fall out of his pocket. I finally passed with flying colors. I wish I knew earlier, the bribe didn’t hold a candle to how much I spent on retaking the tests."

traderjoesnearme,eo7kcm,top_level,"I don’t know who to tell without sounding like I’m bragging, but here goes: my favorite artist (who’s also quite popular) noticed a drawing I posted of her and reposted it onto her Instagram story. I’m speechless right now! Not to mention that I posted it about a week ago, so I have no idea how far she had to scroll in her tagged photos to get to it. 

I’m not a professional artist by any means — I just doodle for fun in my free time — and the drawing of her was a rough one, so I’m all the more shocked. But this bit of recognition means so much to me. It makes me want to continue every one of my hobbies until eternity, even if I think I suck. As long as I can have fun and smile while doing it! I’m feeling rejuvenated and giddy right now. I’m really happy.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the kind words! For the time being, I would prefer for my Reddit account to stay completely anonymous, so I don’t have a link to the artwork or the Instagram story. I’ll brainstorm a way to share it with you all anonymously. Thanks for understanding."

gauthamsivakumar,em0mo5,top_level,"I got a patent for my invention on my own about 2 months ago. I don’t want to explain it in detail because I’m still working on it and I don’t know if it will work for sure yet. All I can say right now is that if it is successful it will have a huge impact on the world.

I have been in contact with a professor at my college regarding building a prototype in his lab. He actually liked my idea a lot but he said he had a lot of questions and doubts if it would work or not, which only made me more worried...

I am meeting him in his lab on Friday. I will explain my invention in greater detail to him and hopefully start building a prototype. I am so nervous right now. If my invention works it could change my life and countless other lives forever. If it doesn’t I have no idea what to do with the rest of my life. 

So incredibly nervous right now. Wish me luck! :)"
OptimisticPlatypus,fdlnfsa,t3_em0mo5,"Well, all right. It was a ""Jump to Conclusions"" mat. You see, it would be this mat that you would put on the floor, and it would have different conclusions written on it that you could jump to.

Plus it may very well pave the way for future inventions based on that. Whatever your invention is it might help progress something in a totally different field of what you are thinking now. 
You can do it OP!"

No, that's not useful"" because it was something they hasn't thought about yet. The prof. Will likely be doing due diligence, don't be put off by the questions. If a scientist asks questions, that is good. It's bad if they don't. Good luck."
gauthamsivakumar,fdlw008,t1_fdlvtul,Thank you!! He actually liked the invention a lot but he said he had a lot of questions and doubts about it... it’s a very radical concept so i’m not surprised but it does make me very nervous anyways 😔

Bubbert73,fdm3pzm,t3_em0mo5,"You are definitely smart to keep it quiet. Even though you have a patent, someone can improve upon it and then they're the next best thing. I'm not sure how big your prototype has to be, but I've got an engineering  background as well as metalworking equipment and experience working with machine shops for the stuff I can't do. I also have  tractor with a loader that can serve as a crane within reason. You probably need someone like that. Another option, in Pittsburgh anyway, and probably some other cities,is a place called Techshop, where you can rent by the hour and use their shop to build your prototype."
gauthamsivakumar,fdm54f2,t1_fdm3pzm,Thank you!! It involves some biotech so I had to contact one of the professors on my campus. His lab has a lot more resources I can use
theoneupstairs,fdlqhmx,t3_em0mo5,Good luck! I still have an invention in my head that hasn't been made yet. I just have no idea how to go about building a prototype. I wish I did
gauthamsivakumar,fdluokp,t1_fdlqhmx,"oh shoot! well the first step is making diagrams etc. and getting a provisional patent

once you have that you contact labs or professors at your college about building a prototype 

then once you have a functioning prototype you can present to investors and gain money to launch your business :)

at least that’s the path i’m following!! i’m at the second step haha. wishing you the best of luck! don’t let your dreams be dreams 🙏"
sebeckmas,fdm3lmp,t1_fdlqhmx,I literally started a YouTube channel last week on answering this exact question (how to make a prototype) https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCHxfz13mE0HS6FJD1Y94Uuw

theRuathan,fdmbruh,t3_em0mo5,"Make sure you have the intellectual property sorted out early on. Maybe even ask the prof to sign some good-faith paperwork before you give him ALL the deets. It's unfortunately common for professors to steal ideas from their students when they're developing stuff together and then go patent it. Doesn't just extend to taking credit in a published research paper, which is considered acceptable in many fields."

SirM0rgan,fdme7t6,t3_em0mo5,Good luck guy!  If you get it to work then remember that you have to patent any similar configuration to actually prevent other entities from using your invention.  Also your patent only matters to the extent that you are able to sue the person infringing on your patent.  Sometimes it is better to work out a deal with a larger entity with more litigative power instead of keeping the patent to yourself.
gauthamsivakumar,fdn5m72,t1_fdme7t6,Thanks! I mentioned numerous other configurations in my patent. And if this takes off I’ll work with an experienced lawyer to write up an even fuller patent to replace my provisional patent.

IncelRex,fdn3xi2,t3_em0mo5,"Hey man, I've always wanted to pitch this idea I have to an inventor. Check this out. A glove you plug into your computer and you connect to a chatroullete type app. Random strangers, who also bought the glove can control your glove and you can control theirs. Obviously the hand glove thingy has some movement restrictions. 

So, you put your penis in that glove and some stranger, on her end, moves your glove by inserting their hand in their glove and controls yours. Presto, free handjobs machine. I'm telling you man, you're gonna get worked like a summer job, for free. Picture this, you come home from a hard day at the office, you unzip, plug in the glove, place your bearded salami in the glove and you have a relaxing evening getting your junk milked. I'm pitching the idea to skype.

Think, you're in a long distance relationship, you can touch your gf's tits and feel it in the glove as it mimicks the shape if your glove is in receiving mode, and then, you put your glove in sending mode and you can do the downstairs dj on her. We're going 50/50 on this."

I was *just* talking to a friend about wanting to sprout in the art business, and that I want my drawings to be more than just a hobby.

30 mins later I talk to an acquaintance (that I usually send my sketches to), and he asked for a commission.

Man I was thrilled. Did my job, took like 45 mins. Awesome way to make 9$. Also I'm on a sick day off work, so it was nice doing this for fun AND money.

Also, moral of the story: never give up on things you wanna do.

sham9955,fe8qbye,t1_fe8px6c,Oh I will! This gave me lotsa hope. \^\^
littlesadgreenbean,fe8qbr5,t3_eo5e4l,"Congratulations! This is a big moment for an artist. It always makes you feel worth it. I remember my first commission, and I felt exactly the same. Here's hoping that it doesn't stop there, and that you're able to make a living from your art. That's the dream."
sham9955,fe8qh3b,t1_fe8qbr5,"Thanks man, I feel great with my art now. Someone loved it so bad to buy it! I feel like I won 100$ haha

I'll strive for more."
bokxng,fe8rix6,t3_eo5e4l,"That's something really nice to read honestly! When you like something and work hard on it, the feeling of it being paid off is the best, so I'm glad it worked for you ;)

Also, the drawing that you made for the commission is pretty nice, I like that art style!"
sham9955,fe8rlv9,t1_fe8rix6,"Man I'm super happy. And thank you, I very much appreciate it!"

gothbb,fe8snlv,t3_eo5e4l,"Please keep at it! You're so great and you could definitely make a business out of this! If you haven't already, make an IG for your art and you'll certainly get paid work! I have a friend that's been making a killing off of D&D players wanting to commission art of their characters. Maybe that's something you could look into if you're interested in that kind of stuff :) Congrats on your first paid piece!"
sham9955,fe8ste9,t1_fe8snlv,"I do have an ig acc for my stuff, it hasn't really worked but I think it's just because it's a larger platform. I guess working from small radius first is smarter for me. Thank you so much for your kindness!"
gothbb,fe9jzpi,t1_fe8ste9,"Totally understandable, not every artist has the same path to success. But keep at what you're doing!"
deficiency_xsgx,enpzza,top_level,"Yesterday I got a hair cut and shaved after a week, took a shower, and went to sleep. This morning when I got up I looked in the mirror and was kind of caught off guard by how good I felt with myself. I tend to have low self esteem for some reason so I'm pretty happy with this."
ethnititties_,fe3ezt5,t3_enpzza,Good for you!!
deficiency_xsgx,fe3fiy9,t1_fe3ezt5,thanks
TheStupidWanker,fe4bh1h,t3_enpzza,when I look in the mirror I think 'Wait I look like that?'
Iam_H-,fe5yjts,t1_fe4bh1h,All this time I thought I was alone!
Cougar_Snack,fe4n8by,t3_enpzza,I think the moment you're describing is how other people actually see you all the time. We're our own worst enemies.
deficiency_xsgx,fe4nnu7,t1_fe4n8by,I hope so. I used to have self esteem issues but people would always tell me that I'm handsome or had nice eyes or a good jawline and I just never believed it. Even now I feel like they where mostly just being nice even if there was a little truth to it.
shorty1027,fe60b6w,t1_fe4nnu7,"Well, usually when people try to be nice, atleast in my experience, they don't say that you're handsome or they don't point out good qualities about your face, they just stuff like say ""you're not ugly, you know"" ""you have a nice personality"" ""stuff like that doesn't even matter"". So that being said, I think it's safe to assume you're a good lookin boi."
Matthias512,fe3p9vy,t3_enpzza,Nope. But happy for you!
Fafnir_19,fe3f3yo,t3_enpzza,That's great to hear! It's a good thing that you're looking at yourself like that so suddenly.
AlessiaLife,fe3jb8s,t3_enpzza,"I am glad you feel that way about yourself. I would only say this on the internet because of obvious reasons. I actually do that all the time, because I am happy with how I look and I honestly feel like I should be happy about being happy about how I look :)"
mallenstreak,fe52t2m,t1_fe3jb8s,That’s awesome. It’s really nice to hear that someone is happy with themselves. It’s so rare and it shouldn’t be.
Dual_Nature,fe4m2dx,t3_enpzza,"Its usually ""eew, you gross blob"" 
I dont know if its true, or a chronic self esteem thing. Ive always thought like that, but looking back at highschool pictures, i actually want very big. But i remember being huge."
recklesschopchop,fe431wz,t3_enpzza,"My reaction to my reflection changes with the day lol. Last night I went in the bathroom to wash my makeup off, and when I looked in the mirror I thought ""wow I am so pretty.""

This morning I was cleaning that same bathroom, and when I looked in the mirror I actually said out loud ""oh shit, I look like ass."""
emiways,fe3pp47,t3_enpzza,"It’s good that you feel good about yourself. You’ll feel more confident out in the world and this will help your performance at work and in social situations. Just keep in mind that you have much more to offer than just your looks. Looks might get their attention, but it’s intelligence, kindness, and a sense of humor that keeps their attention."
deficiency_xsgx,fe3rjwf,t1_fe3pp47,very true words
Anon_64,fe5cb95,t3_enpzza,No.
CalmMood,fe49hsk,t3_enpzza,"Rarely enough.

My peak confidence was about two years ago, when I was in the middle of losing my 160 lbs. I could look at the relative change and say, ""wow, I look good."" But since then, I've gotten kind of used to it, and I see more flaws now."
emilioe5tevez,fe50vrf,t3_enpzza,I'd be stunning if i weighd 25kilo less...
deficiency_xsgx,fe515d5,t1_fe50vrf,that's a very attainable goal
emilioe5tevez,fe51p2t,t1_fe515d5,"I can see it happening, but it's still an everyday struggle."
deficiency_xsgx,fe52bft,t1_fe51p2t,yea just because something is attainable doesn't mean it won't be very difficult. Good luck though :)
emilioe5tevez,fe57y7p,t1_fe52bft,"thanks, im working on it."
OhGawDuhhh,fe5ff0d,t3_enpzza,"It's nice when it happens. I'm dealing with a breakup but I'm feeling more handsome as the days go by.

I'm glad to hear you're looking good and feeling good!"

WoodoVoodo,fe5y0ce,t3_enpzza,I read somewhere that we see ourselves 20% less attractive then others do. .. just a random fact
deficiency_xsgx,fe5y3cq,t1_fe5y0ce,yo if that's real thats great news
THEBROWNSTAINSOFDARK,fe58ifj,t3_enpzza,i used to
MrMeAugie79,fe5ef2o,t3_enpzza,"Yes, you must have a healthy self image:) love & respect yourself always!"
claudiyeah18,fe5f7te,t3_enpzza,That was me this morning!
Scarno7,fe5fdnb,t3_enpzza,I often look in the mirror and think I'm pretty good looking. Then I see myself in a photo and it all comes crashing down.
speedysoprano,fe5hsjt,t3_enpzza,"Very rarely, but it's a great feeling."
dasblog,fe5jinc,t3_enpzza,"From time to time when the light is right, I crane my neck in the right way and my stubble is just the right length. Basically a ton of moons have to align for me to go “I look pretty good.”

I’m currently 33 and when I look back at photos of me when I was 21, I’m like “Holy crap, you looked so good!” It’s almost a shame to not realize that until 10 years after the fact. Just proof of how powerful self esteem and self image can be."
indigo_tortuga,fe5jnlm,t3_enpzza,Yes but not lately. Glad to hear you like how you look!
Bluemonogi,fe5opk5,t3_enpzza,I can't remember ever thinking that about myself. I might think I look okay but I've never really felt good looking. I've always been pretty critical of myself.
natulm,fe5r166,t3_enpzza,Yeah I think this all the time. Opposite sex doesn't seem to agree with me though
deficiency_xsgx,fe5r674,t1_fe5r166,i agree with you
SistaSaline,fe5shin,t3_enpzza,"Every day. I’m grateful to be good looking, and to know it."
EggAllocationService,fe5tmii,t3_enpzza,"Unfortunately, no. Glad you think so though!"
chickennroll,fe5tor7,t3_enpzza,"I only feel that way when my neck is covered, for some odd reason. Turtlenecks and my robe make me feel good-looking."
wzardofoz,fe5veb7,t3_enpzza,Exact opposite. Never. Ever.
Undark_,fe61f00,t3_enpzza,"Quite frequently. Unfortunately I always look like shit in photographs and I'm pretty sure I only look good in reflections because I'm A) possibly a bit narcissistic and B) it doesn't account for my shitty posture and spindly frame etc.

But at least I get a kick out of it while I brush my teeth lol."
artichoke2me,fe6bsac,t3_enpzza,All the time. Than I remember how many times I got rejected in the past and I am humbled.
COHERENCE_CROQUETTE,fe6fc64,t3_enpzza,"I actually do. I think I’m terrible looking, and I don’t get a lot of compliments or advances, so I know I’m not attractive, but when I look at the bathroom mirror I actually think “hey, you’re kinda nice looking, actually”. 

But then every single other reflective surface tells me a different story, and it’s hard for me to pretend my bathroom mirror is the one that’s most accurate."
gingerjedi3,fe6in3o,t3_enpzza,"Yeah, but I think because I don’t look on the mirror often. How do people look in the mirror and brush their teeth? Anyway, great for you!"
billwiz2,fe6mnov,t3_enpzza,Self esteem has nothing to do with taking a bath every day although it's good to take a bath regularly. I don't take a bath always every day. Most people take baths every day and shave and then they make porn videos and drink and smoke. Oh common the best kind of self esteem you can have is to love yourself. But take baths regularly (I say this to myself too)!
LordBrowser,fe6or6x,t3_enpzza,"In mirrors yes, but in photos not so much."
JustKeepSwimmingDory,fe6pz4z,t3_enpzza,"Usually I tend to wince at my own reflection but have been trying to improve my self esteem by forcing myself to focus on positive thoughts rather than the negative.

And it’s helped a bit! Lately I’ve been dressing better, people have complimented my appearance, and I’ve actually thought to myself, “You know what? I actually do look pretty cute today!” It feels nice to not beat myself up for that!"
nurdboy42,fe6thn4,t3_enpzza,If I look in the mirror too long I start to list all the things I hate about my face.
NoopLiona,fe70a1a,t3_enpzza,I always feel more handsome when I wake up in the morning. My eyes look smaller and I look pretty sexy. (I'm a guy).
notnicolai,fe7y9ad,t3_enpzza,"I feel the same way sometimes. I'd feel like my clothes don't fit properly and my hair must be a curly mess, but when I look at the mirror by the end of the day, I'd just smile at myself because I actually looked better than I thought."
Source_Points,fe82n3w,t3_enpzza,Every once in a blue moon. Middle School recked my self esteem.

Mxt1998,enxm7s,top_level,"I just recently started dating this woman around my age, 21. We hardly talk about family, but today the conversation came up. As you do, I asked her about her parents. Mom and dad are divorced, so I assumed mom had remarried. The conversation went something like this:

Me: So did your mom remarry? She have a husband?

Her: No. My mom's gay.

Me: What. You're joking?

Her: *laughs a little* No, my mom's gay! She has a girlfriend.

Me: Oh my God, that's cool! Never met someone whose parent was gay.

Her: Yea!

Me: So.... Let's say she married her girlfriend... Would Yo Mama jokes affect you twice as much?

Dead silence. Until my girlfriend busted out with a, **""OH MY GOD, YOU'RE SO DUMB.""**

I let out a hearty laugh, probably overdid it, but I had to. This opportunity would never arise freshly new again. It was a great moment that I will cherish."
jeffdaranger,fe6agiu,t3_enxm7s,"Given an adequate amount of time and the right circumstances, a spicy yo mama joke could result in a triple kill 😆👍"
Mxt1998,fe6e7pp,t1_fe6agiu,"A triple kill 😂😂 I will definitely keep it in mind!!! Maybe pop it over dinner with them lmao. 

That will be my legacy in this relationship."

Edit: this didnt post where I meant it too. Whoops"

Mxt1998,fe6gt2g,t1_fe6glqr,"I'm glad you're both happy!

Mxt1998,fe6e8fg,t1_fe6amio,I have flashbacks to middle school.
Kabooski_Blue58,fe75pke,t3_enxm7s,That’s why it’s better to have two dads. You’ll end up being safe from the ‘Yo Mama’ jokes
GreenOrdinary,fe7dr0r,t1_fe75pke,But now you have do deal with twice the amount of dad jokes
Kabooski_Blue58,fe7dt6g,t1_fe7dr0r,I see that as a win. Dad jokes and puns are the best!

6irlfriend,eo4z66,top_level,"I have PTSD and suffer from night terrors so I spend a lot of nights unable to sleep.

One night, my bff of a cousin told me to come play fortnite. I'd never played before so I wasn't interested, but he really wanted me to join and said it'll be fun. I knew I could really use the company right then so I agreed and loaded up.

He said I'd be playing with him and his friends so I was nervous, but the vibe was super fun and friendly; It was just a bunch of guys having a good time lol. I thought my presence was going to make things awkward but they were all so welcoming! They decided to ""teach me the basics"" so we just messed around in creative as a way for me to get used to things.

It's been about two weeks of playing every night now. I used to only play once my cousin was online, but eventually I started getting invites from one or more of his friends regardless of whether or not my cousin was online, because they ACTUALLY want to play with me! And they're all night owls which suits me perfectly. Time really does fly when you're having fun so I play until I'm exhausted which means I crash pretty much as soon as I lay in bed! No more struggling/forcing myself to sleep.

Also, I sometimes leave the game on while I sleep. This might sound creepy, but seriously whenever I wake up from night terrors, the sound of their voices and the feeling of having someone there is extremely grounding for me. They are 100% fine and comfortable with this and I couldn't possibly be any more grateful.

I had yesterday off work and I fell asleep at around 4am, woke up much later than usual at around 8am, then managed to sleep right through until FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT !!!! BEST SLEEP I'VE HAD IN FOREVER. 

I could freakin cry right now. I love my squad and if you need one too, come play stupid fortnite with us :) Even if you're not into fps games, you can just come do random stuff with me in creative mode lol."

Can I offer a suggestion to help? If you can, it might not be a bad idea to look into investing in some blue-light blocking glasses. They'll likely make things look a bit yellow, but you might find yourself feeling that urge to sleep sooner and it might take you less time to fall asleep. Just thought it'd help!"

I'm happy to be 19 and doing somewhat ok, but vaping is something I need to quit - so today is the day. if anyone has good quitting tips that would be great too!

have a great day :)"
Blacksigil8,fdpns3m,t3_emmg46,"A tip for quiting
- try creating things. Drawing, writing, singing, working with your hands. interacting with others helps you know that you have a support system on your journey of staying off nicotine. 
Sending Strength 🙏"
fuckit16383962,fdpnv63,t1_fdpns3m,thanks a lot! I've wanted to start a new side hobby for fun and these will definitely help :)
Delta-Victor-Papa,fdsfqgy,t1_fdpns3m,"This

&#x200B;

I found that starting the gym helped me the most. I have an addictive personality and I develop habits quickly so I found that replacing a bad habit with a healthy one was the most productive way"
Blacksigil8,fdpo16f,t1_fdpnv63,"ALSO! if this was an addiction, the road to recovery is a journey, not a destination. Do not feel like crap for relapsing. (Tbh I feel like I can say this more freely here because it isn't an intense thing that is being quit, unlike someone who is a heavy opioid user etc) just keep going, and keep trying. Let others know that you are kicking a bad habit."
Blacksigil8,fdsg0q6,t1_fdsfqgy,"Absolutely! When you are quitting any sort of addiction, your mind will go crazy because it's not getting the dopamine it's used to getting BUT! If you get your dopamine from a positive source (such as the gym, creating, or socializing) it tends to help with the recovery process"
fuckit16383962,fdpo7gs,t1_fdpo16f,"I've been trying to quit it for a while now, and for the last 4ish months of vaping I've wanted to quit. I'm hoping this time will finally do it - I feel determined.

its definitely a bad habit but not a life threatening one. I also smoke a lot of weed pretty consistently, so I wanted to quit either that or nicotine. progress, I guess!"
Blacksigil8,fdpo8yw,t1_fdpo7gs,One step at a time. 🙏
jxwtf585,fdpqc5d,t3_emmg46,"That's awesome! Im still trying to quit mine. I quit cigarettes last year and now the vape needs to go too. Here, they have nicotine toothpicks. They're made with just enough nicotine to fight an urge which has been helping me use my vape a lot less. Also my job has me work a lot with my hands which keeps my mind off of vaping. Try toothpicks and keeping your hands busy to fight both those habits or fixations or w/e they're called. Best of luck!"
fuckit16383962,fdpr6u9,t1_fdpqc5d,"wow, toothpicks?! just looked them up, who knew...

I'll do my best to keep my hands constantly busy, that will help a lot"
jxwtf585,fds1a19,t1_fdrmle3,Only one shop sells them here. They're called nic picks
atreyuno,fdpvhla,t3_emmg46,Withdrawal symptoms get worse the second week. Don't let it catch you off guard. Make it through week three and you're home free. After that just watch out for cravings during stressful periods or when you're around other people vaping.
ohgodspidersno,fdq93ua,t3_emmg46,"When you get a craving, pause and take note of what the craving feels like. Check in with each of your muscles and bones, are they tense? What about your stomach and your breathing? Look at your thoughts as they roll through you, and as you notice them let them go.

This makes it easier to see the craving as something physical, anatomical, and most importantly: temporary."

FosterPupz,fdpuv2r,t3_emmg46,"I was 18 when I quit smoking after smoking for 6 years. That was 30 years ago and I am still so proud and so thrilled I did it. I bought lots and lots of gum and lolli pops to keep my mouth busy, and made myself aware of all my “light up” times so I could be aware (soon as I got in the car, right after a meal, making a phone call) and have a lolli handy as a replacement.

Congratulations! Stay strong. You CAN do this and will be so much healthier and wealthier for doing so!"
AlextheLyonnn,fdryzsw,t1_fdpuv2r,"I wish I could do that.
If it was a nicotine thing, I'd be so happy. Sadly for me, it's oral, and there's just no substitute for that. Sunflower seeds and gum? Disgusting; chewing on your own saliva endlessly. Lollies and such? Diabetes. Can't do that. 


What do the rest of us do to quit? If it's not a hand thing or a nicotine thing? Anyone?"
FosterPupz,fdscu41,t1_fdryzsw,"Sugar-free lollies and gum are much better now than they used to be, but if not, okay. Carry bags of baby carrots and cut up celery stalks with you, almonds, peanuts, or something healthy you like. Find what works for you."
AlextheLyonnn,fdsfqyc,t1_fdscu41,"Haha one of my complaints is that I *don't* like chewing.


There needs to be another alternative. Munchlaxing isn't my thing."
FosterPupz,fdskv5h,t1_fdsfqyc,"Okay, what else can can you do to keep your mouth busy? Whistle, hum, sing, talk, practice foreign language,  learn echolocation, count your teeth using the tip of your tongue, invent games with your tongue where you tap it rhythmically against certain teeth, practice drawing letters in the air with your tongue.... really the list of things you CAN do with your mouth is unlimited. The only reason you have not to is... “I don’t wanna.”"
AlextheLyonnn,fdstu7z,t1_fdskv5h,"I'm very skilled with my lesbian tongue, already, thanks ;).

That said, those are all annoying, I'll just keep vaping! Someday maybe we'll invent something for people who aren't addicted to nicotine, and hate chewing. Too bad pacifiers are for babies and drug addicts, I could really use one of those."

In order to fully quit you're gonna have to erase the desire to vape entirely, otherwise you wont really be a non-vaper, you'll just be a vaper who isn't vaping, but deep down wishes he was. So contrary to a lot of people's advice and just commone sense in general, I strongly recommend against using any nicotine substitutes (patches, gum, etc). They are serously awful and won't help you in the long run. I actually threw away my nic patches with all the other stuff as well. Anyways, good luck m8"
fuckit16383962,fdqn9b3,t1_fdq3k5z,"wow, congrats friend that's a huge step. we've got this.

I'm definitely going to stay away from nicotine products of any kind, as many people suggested I'm going to start chewing a ton of regular gum to substitute."

4evranxious,fdq96xm,t3_emmg46,"I quit 11 years ago and did it cold turkey. The thing that helped me most was pretending to smoke, I would hold a pen like a cigarette and act like I was smoking, taking the deep pull in and the long breath out. It helped pass the cravings by acting it out. Good luck! You are stronger than this temporary addiction."

Omphroy,fdq8lz1,t3_emmg46,Hell yeah my friend!
ohgodspidersno,fdq9ggx,t3_emmg46,"Each craving only lasts a couple of minutes. Just think about getting through that one craving, which really is very short and fleeting.


Also get rid of all the physical stuff around you that reminds you of the act of vaping. For smoking this would be stuff like ash trays, lighters, etc. I imagine vaping might have something similar. Re-arrange your furniture a bit and clean your car. This can help disrupt the habit's groove because there are fewer external triggers telling you it's time to vape."
B1SQ1T,fdqgrqj,t3_emmg46,I still have mine but I found that chewing gum helps to kidna distract yourself from the craving

MechaWASP,fdqm1ij,t3_emmg46,"Just look for a natural, plant based alternative. Like, idk, a cigarette. /s

Seriously though, good on you. As an ex smoker, find something to occupy your mouth. Gum, tooth picks, whatever. Find something to fill your time and focus on as well, when you have a moment you would normally vape. I recommend rolling a quarter over your knuckles. Takes a bit of focus and is a neat party trick."
jaihaan,fdqnb5e,t3_emmg46,"I saw some comments about hobbies. This advice is close, but not quite hitting the nail on the head. 

The real truck to quitting any addiction is to do something else when a craving hits. Get a snack, go for a run/walk, read a book, call a friend. Just do something else. Doesn't matter what. Distract yourself from the craving. That's the goal."
Curlybrac,fdsg3os,t3_emmg46,That's great. My younger cousin is only 15 and addicted to vaping and I wish he quit.

BunBunChow,el9s14,top_level,"I was having a crappy day at work. So much so it made me question my career choices (I’ve been doing the same job for 20 years now and am still years from retirement.) I called my wife to tell her to prepare for me to rant to her when I got home to help me decompress. 

I got home and the first person I saw was my one year-old girl. She happily hopped off the couch and ambled towards me. I picked her up and she just straight up embraced me as if we hadn’t seen each other for more than a day. She wouldn’t let go of me to allow me to remove my jacket. My wife had an “awwww” moment and marveled at how it seemed as if she knew I had needed a hug there and then. 

I embraced her back and all the stress of the day just melted away. I closed my eyes to savor the moment and had an epiphany:  If we hug our kids often enough, will their children and children’s children also feel it somehow? 

With that thought in mind I just kept hugging, hoping my future grandkids would feel the love I had felt at that moment. 

This was one of those times it felt so good being a parent."
UnsocialablySocial,fdgfd8q,t3_el9s14,"Pretty sure it's a valid theory, but it's a solid plan either way.

Kids who receive love freely go on to express love freely.

Mum broke the cycle with us. Her parents withheld love, like their parents and their parents before them. She can't remember ever being told she was loved.

So she made a choice and told us daily that she loved us. She was free with her hugs and her time. She was approachable.

I'm almost 40 and have two kids - 23 months and 4 weeks. Both of my sons are given love and attention freely because that's how I was raised and see no reason to do otherwise. I've had a rough life but I find it easy to make them secure. I tell them many times a day that I love them.

So yeah, my Mum's love reached her grandkids :) it's too soon to tell with the youngest what effect it'll have, but my oldest is kind and affectionate and empathetic. It's a good pattern to nurture :)"

I'm not smart enough to know the science of how our brains get wired, but I think you're going to raise her to give and receive love, and in turn she'll set the pattern for her babies! I don't know, but it's a nice thought. Thanks for sharing something so beautiful."

geekeh14,fdgp5cz,t3_el9s14,"Idk my grandfather nor I have heard much about him except that he was an angry man. He died before my father even got married. My father is an angry man too. And it turns out my brother has anger issues. He got into several violent fights.
I have pondered over what if my grandfather has hugged his son? Maybe then I'd have had a father that I wanted and most importantly needed.

I want to end this cycle here. I don't want to have kids. Its not sad. Its just that I will have to makeup for years of lost love by giving myself love, hugging myself."
FinallyIfoundaname2,fdgzbgx,t1_fdgp5cz,"Just you being aware already makes a difference, you are making a choice to end the cycle. With a supporting spouse and perhaps some therapy to learn alternative ways to interact with others, you may very well become the best parent a kid could want. It is not about being perfect, but about being able to correct mistakes and try to be better. Hug from an internet stranger!"
temporarybeing65,fdhnpux,t1_fdgp5cz,I understand this. Extreme narcissism and assholeism runs in my mothers family. My great grandfather was a very abusive man and it got passed down but I broke the cycle. Not without therapy and meds but I wasn’t abusive  but the anxiety is what I inherited.
geekeh14,fdh0rcx,t1_fdgzbgx,"As much as I love to find love in life, because of my conditioning I attract narcissists. At this point I don't even make effort because it becomes too dark. I know I need therapy and healing. As for kids I'm know I don't want them. There are already too many kids in the world who need love and family. Would like to do something for them. Thank you."
geekeh14,fdj3gmq,t1_fdhnpux,I have anxiety too. That's why bringing anyone in my life is not easy. I have great friends. But sometime I just withdraw from all when I'm trying to deal with something.

Cultusfit,fdggwx8,t3_el9s14,"Well an interesting fact, trauma leaves marks on the genetics.
So much so they can actually see the impact of things like slavery in their decedents now. ( Far as I know it's not something specifically measurable to a degree of ""oh we know your great grandmother was a slave for 38.2 years. But, we know trauma leaves a chemical marker on the genes and we see the results passed down)

It doesn't directly damage the gene, so it doesnt qualify as a mutation but can effect how proteins and such are expressed. (Epigenetics is really a facinating field...)

Any way, they found descendants of certain events tended to be twice as likely to die after middle age than others.  Still a budding fiield with lots to sort out... Like how exactly it's transfered, what all gets passed on....

But the last explanation I saw had to do with the tubes reproductive cells pass through where they could pick up some RNA that would be effected by environmental factors.  They have looked at mice with random lighting, tilting cages, smelling foxes, high fat diets. Humans they have compared slavery, civil war prisoner of war, stomach stapling. And their studies with reproductive females each successive son has an increase in the probability of him being gay. 

Any way... If negative things mark them because its the enviroment. As does prior children. Etc. There is no reason to believe that markers would not be placed based on positve events, feelings and experiences.
At the very least you are reducing the impact of the negative ones as well as not contributing to them...

So long rambling response... Yeah, your great grandkids might end up lacking some crappy epigenetic markers while boasting some good ones all because you took a minute to be a father.
Not quite same as them feeling that hug but, it is nice knowing how directly it could be impacting them.

They see every side of me. I don't hide who I am from them. They know that I can be a broken person, I share when I'm insecure, they see me get angry, they see me cry, lift hundreds of pounds in our home gym, play video games, read, be critical of myself, and even reward myself when I get it right.

CleanieWeenie,fdi77r7,t3_el9s14,"My nearly two-year-old comes to work with me on Tuesday and Thursday. Usually we only get an hour and a bowl of cheerios in before he's bored and climbing the walls. Today he wasn't feeling all that good because of a lingering cold, he was apparently starving to death because all the snacks in the diaper bag were gone by 9:00, and things are busy at the beginning of the year so no one was hanging out in our office to play with him like they usually do. By 10:00 I was about to hit the roof because he was being crazy, whiny, and destructive while I was trying to finish the last task that would let us leave. I've made a point recently to not voice my frustrations and just calmly try to resolve the situation because I don't want him to learn my bad attitude. I sent him on the task of cleaning up his books and toys so we could leave as soon as I was done. After a few minutes, he walks over to my chair with his favorite book, Llama Llama Home with Mama, sets it on my lap, waits until I make eye contact, then grabs me around the waist with a big old hug and says ""awwww mama"". I had to stop and give him a big cuddle and remind myself how much I'm going to miss not having him there with me when his sibling is born this spring. Us parents aren't the only ones that understand this kind of magic."

veryoldcarrot,fdj505h,t3_el9s14,They have supposedly found that trauma can alter your DNA and in that way the traumatic events  of your ancestor gets passed down through to future generations. (think trauma such as experienced by a holocaust survivor) Why not such moments of profound love? Wouldn't that be a wondrous thing to pass down to your progeny?
BunBunChow,fdjeaw3,t1_fdj505h,Imagine if they could identify and isolate a “hugging” gene. I’d be all about genetic modification for positive traits like that. Lol

justanotherstr4nger,fdga8aq,t3_el8ytf,"merry christmas then! i know a few things about ethiopia, so I will ask: do you have any local traditions there for Christmas?"
aheadassnigga,fdgak0t,t1_fdga8aq,Yeah. We have a bunch but my favorite is the food part. I don’t know how to describe it in English but it’s pretty much like a spicy chicken stew thingy. There’s also a tradition where you get a sheep slaughtered in your backyard and it gets split apart and cooked right there. It can be viewed as horrible but it’s culture here and we’re used to it.
XPhours,fdgg393,t1_fdgak0t,How much times do it take to drain its blood and remove intestines?
aheadassnigga,fdgiu55,t1_fdgg393,I’m not sure but the whole process starts at about 12:00PM and ends at 5:00PM. So the intestine part should take about an hour. The blood drainage is at the beginning because we start by beheading it. Still horrible on paper.

aheadassnigga,fdh559i,t1_fdguduk,"Idk about presents. That’s a possibility but mostly it’s a cultural thing. We usually chill around with the whole family, the elders and adults drink an extremely alcoholic local beverage, kids sing, “priests” come around neighborhoods singing our version of Christmas carols, animals slaughtered and cooked at the same day (I can see how that’s horrible but it’s culture) and some other things I might be missing. Christmas here is more “Celebrate Jesus” and less “Celebrate” and that’s what differentiates us from other places."

nosolicitingplease,en38ak,top_level,"I was scrolling on Facebook in one of the groups I’m in, a gal was live (live video) talking and she starts crying so I start watching. She just looks so heartbroken and depressed and is obviously going through a hard time. 

Everyone is commenting trying to get her location to see if someone can check on her. She tells them where she’s from and gives the address, it happened to be about 12 minutes from my house. I drove to the store and picked up a bunch of snacks and random coloring essentials and knocked on her door.

I felt like a creeper knocking on a random strangers door, but I was like hey I’m in the so and so group and I was worried about you. She just starts crying and hugs me. 

I ended up hanging out at her house for about three hours, she was super nice and very appreciative. 
 I felt like we got along well and I related to a lot of what she was saying. 

This was something completely out of my comfort zone but I feel like I made a life long friend out of it. I kinda felt like it was fate that it all happened. Thanks for letting me share I don’t have a lot of friends near me."

Most of us would think twice because we would put our safety first. I agree we should, but sometimes, it pays to think that the other person might be genuine, and really needs someone at this point of time.

It was not just a kind gesture, but a pretty brave gesture from your side. We should all learn to step up sometimes, like you did."

TrungusMcTungus,eljtz2,top_level,"I surprised my wife with a black lab puppy on New Years 2018. Purebred, AKC, biggest one in the litter, the whole shabang. I hated her for months. I was really stressed from work, working 12-16 hours a day and dealing with an unruly puppy for the couple hours before I went to bed. 


A few months ago she finally started to settle down and training finally set in. Recently though, I've been on extended leave from work, so I've been spending lots of time at home with the dog. My god, what an angel. She's still hyper and crazy but she's a much better dog. Since I'm at home so much, she's attached to me and follows me everywhere now. I love it. She's the best dog I've ever had, and I'm glad I'm not unfairly hating a puppy who didn't have any control over her behavior anymore."
Irregular_cow,fdid4w9,t3_eljtz2,"Bruh same. My pup was and still kinda is the most chaotic creature I know, but I've started to enjoy his little quirks. 

But it's been a journey to get there."
TrungusMcTungus,fdifm81,t1_fdid4w9,Tell me about it man. Mine is far from super well behaved but she's way more manageable and enjoyable nowadays.

CrimsonGalaxy,fdiwhbn,t3_eljtz2,"Labs are honestly kind of insane for like the first 3 years of their lives... Once they get fixedd and have that 2-3 year grace period, they're great"
TrungusMcTungus,fdj3xpp,t1_fdiwhbn,"Yep...we haven't had enough spare dough to get her fixed, but there are no male dogs that she's around so we're holding off for a while longer. She's definitely settled down a lot but still is a very chaotic pup."
Langston_Toq,fdj89e0,t1_fdiwhbn,"This. I have a labradoodle right now and honestly I very much disliked her for ~2 years just because she was so crazy. Training didn’t really help because she wasn’t disobedient, just crazily excited by everything lol. 

She’s finally calmed down though with age and she is now my favorite dog I’ve ever had! I love how it’s clear that they adore you soooo much."
alcollet,fdiwwhs,t3_eljtz2,My dog brought me to tears many times as a puppy. And tbh for a while the resentment was hard to shake but oh my god how much I adore him. It really is a phase both for the puppy and the caretaker
TrungusMcTungus,fdj3qhx,t1_fdiwwhs,"Same here... There was a time my wife was out of town and I had to work for 8 hours, come home for 30 min, then work another 6... didnt want the puppy in the kennel that long so i set her up with pee pads in one of those play pens for babies. I came home to her escaped from it, pee pads torn up, pee and poop EVERYWHERE, and just sobbed to my wife on the phone"
a-lot-of-potatoes,fdj0hp9,t3_eljtz2,"Dogs are the best! 

When I first adopted my dog, she was a year old and from a local shelter so she had some issues. Her leg was healing from a break (which was why her previous owners had given her up) and she was so anxious all the time. We gave it time, slowly encouraged her to trust us, gave her positive reinforcement for things she did well and it seems to have worked! She still has a fear of bicycles but she no longer pees inside the house or jumps the fence! She's gotten a lot more confident and her personally has started to come out. She's sweet and cheeky and *completely insane*. Dogs are so worth it."
TrungusMcTungus,fdj3uth,t1_fdj0hp9,That's so sweet! Good on you for nurturing her back to where she's at

greffedufois,fdjbo4b,t3_eljtz2,"I had a similar time with our kittens. I honestly don't understand why people go for kittens. It's literally the most rambunctious and annoying stage! 
Our tabbies were both weaned too young (sniffs mom died and Toby was abandoned outside by some asshole person) so they both tried to nurse on things. Usually fingers. Sometimes noses when we tried to sleep. Once on my actual boob (ow!) And for a while any and all buttons. 

They also get gas from changing food, you have to get the fixed pretty quickly before they become sexually mature to deter bad behaviors (marking/spraying, yowling etc) and in my case the tabbies both wanted 3am feedings. Found out later that Toby was capable of getting on top of the fridge (where his bowl was) but he just wanted someone to sit with him while he ate. Little jerk. 

They were adorable as kittens but God I'm so glad the kitten stage is past us now. My sister got a puppy a few years ago and she has said the same thing. At least our kittens didn't chew up a table like her dog did. 
I like that our boys (now 9, 5 and nearly 4) are more mellowed out now. They enjoy just being cuddly and hanging out with us."

warehousemen,fdjceb8,t3_eljtz2,"I had the same experience but with kittens.

My fiance and I had just moved across the country, trying to settle down in our first apartment away from everyone we've ever known and she started talking about wanting an animal. 

We were in a temporary apartment for the first 3 months we were here and I kept telling her let's wait until we find something more permanent and we can discuss it.

Well, one day when I was at work, she ""surprised"" me with 2 kittens.

I lost my goddamn mind. I had asked her to wait and I felt she took advantage of the fact that I was working 14-16 hours a day to go behind my back and do this.

I hated those kittens with everything I had inside of me because I truly thought they were the reason we were going to break up.

For the first 2 months we had them, I never touched them. Never pet them. Never loved on them. Never acknowledged them except to yell at my fiance that their cat box smelled horrible and to clean it.


The job I was working on ended and I had decided to take 2 months off for the holidays (I'm freelance and work when I want and take off when I want)....and, idk. Something changed.

I was no longer stressed to the max with my job and we were settled into our permanent apartment and my fiance bought one of those self cleaning litter boxes, so it no longer smelled like cat...and when she asked me one day why I hated them so much, I told her because they hated me and ran away whenever I walked in the room.

Anyways, long story long, I stopped being such a dick and realized I was taking my frustrations out on 2 poor little kittens (that are now 2 big ass cats) and started to pet them and eventually worked up quite a bond with the little boy cat and who's now my absolute little buddy and always wants to cuddle. His sister is a lot more skiddish than he is and isn't a cuddly cat, but I'm working on winning her over."
Curticorn,fdjsiqj,t3_eljtz2,"Feel you.

magrubr,fdk0v6k,t3_eljtz2,"My dog is now almost 12. I still remember when my wife and I got her as a puppy 11 years ago. We were convinced we had made a horrible decision and this tiny monster was going to ruin our lives, she was just so hyper and straight up bad. After some training classes and getting used to the chaos the dog brought, she became a true member of the family."
TrungusMcTungus,fdkdlk3,t1_fdk0v6k,Exactly what happened to us! There were so many days I wanted to surrender her because I felt like I just couldn't handle her anymore. Now she's my little shadow and I couldn't imagine my days without her following me everywhere
magrubr,fdkgtyl,t1_fdkdlk3,"I get that completely, I had full on panic attacks because of this little 5 pound puppy. Raising a dog is a great growing experience looking back at it, you and the dog get through tough times together and it really cements the relationship."
Melunite,fdkirn2,t3_eljtz2,"I think that's how it is with puppies, with both my dogs there's like loads of pics in the first few weeks of them being little, then they stop, then at about a year they start again for life.

It's hard to take a picture of the little b*stard that bites your legs when you leave the safety of your bed and eats your fave shoes/furniture.  Puppies are evil for about 6 months then they get their individual personalities."
paranoidandroid_96,fdjf2c5,t3_eljtz2,"My dog is very old. She recently had to go on some medicine for her arthritis. She is doing very well now, still very sleepy, as she is old, but she is a very cute dog, and is curled up on my bed now, in and out of sleep.

Ms-Peach,fdkavrv,t3_eljtz2,"I feel this way about my cat. I had wanted a pet to snuggle and keep me company while my fiancé works night shifts. After a year together we finally went to the shelter and adopted a year-old cat. She was super shy at first of course, then after a week or two she exploded with energy.

Zoomies all the time, cat parkour off of everything. Jumping on tables and counters, chewing things. Waking us up a few times every night with meowing and pouncing. I started to get a bit frustrated; I had wanted a little buddy, and this cat did not seem interested in sitting with me, letting me pet her much, relaxing.. She just wanted to PARTY! Hahah.

Now it's been about half a year, and she's gotten comfortable here and I love this cat so much. She runs to greet us when we come home, meows and chirps like she's having a conversation with you, jumps up into my lap and purrs like a machine. Yes, she still wakes me early in the morning a lot of the time, but it doesn't bug me anymore because I know it's because she misses us. She wants us awake to come play and hang out with her. She's also incredibly gentle (has never bit or scratched us) and loves belly rubs and sitting on our shoulders. This place would be so empty without her."
mommmabear19,fdl4tc1,t3_eljtz2,"My husband was the same with our dog... We brought her home when she was 6 weeks old. As she became older she just got crazier and crazier and add separation anxiety on top of that. Countless items were destroyed. She also is very vocal which drove my husband crazy. He was very adamant on how much he hated her but I loved her so there was that. 

 Anyways flash forward about 2 years.. 

We had the whole fam outside in the front sitting by a fire making smores and just having a good time. Then out of the darkness came this really aggressive dog at our 3 kids who were running around the front yard playing. Our dog jumped into action so fast we had no clue what was going on yet. She put herself between that dog and our family. Luckily that dog although very aggressive was very scared of our dog (for whatever reason). Gave me enough time to get the kiddos inside and my husband to grab the metal pole to shoo the other dog off. 

Ever since then he had LOVED her and now just embraces her derpness."

I deleted all social media except Instagram and Reddit. On Instagram I did a purge though, got rid of random followers, people I don't see or particular care for anymore, and deleted a lot of those ""influencer accounts"" I was following.

I was never a big fan of Twitter either, so my time on there was short lived. I was going to delete the account, as some people were trying to contact me that I had no desire associating with, but I also deleted all my friends, so it is essentially deleted. I leave the messenger up for my nan and Aunt, (nan only uses her land line and her iPad, and my aunt uses her phone for work).

Some people don't mind the idea of telling others early as they find it very comforting to know that there are others who know and will care if they lose the pregnancy. I know some people who much prefer having a big support network like that and prefer to tell people early, and some who hate the idea of having to tell people about a lost pregnancy, so they aim to avoid telling people until shortly before she starts showing.

It's a personal thing."

 We did this, except I managed to convince my wife to tell her family a week early from her 3 month appointment. We found out that appointment that it was a miscarriage, and she miscarried within the next couple of nights (*I got racially profiled and put into the back of a cop car after leaving the hospital too* XD...).

I'm not going for a scare tactic, but for her comfort, I think I'd recommend waiting the two weeks. Maybe focus your energy into a fun and personal reveal. Our next reveal will be an Airport Departure Board with our names in place of the destination and the birthdays for the flight info.

For the next pregnancy, or if y'all want to consider waiting longer, I would recommend trying to work out a consensus."

Wot? Please elaborate"
Icebolt08,fe9lsf8,t1_fe8bnd6,"I appreciate you noticing my early morning mini rant. Hopefully the truncated version does it justice.

So REALLY long story short. My wife and I were stopped immediately after leaving the hospital from her miscarriage. It was a totally legal stop, as I had an issue with my license plate that I was misinformed on.

However, the first officer acted questionably, asking about things that didn't quite pertain to the stop such as why I had USAA insurance, if we had the miscarriage papers, why I had the blue stripe (police) on my vehicle, and if my wife was willfully there.

I was cuffed and detained in the first officer's car while both officers asked my wife, by her account, the same questions. By her account, the second officer stated they should let us go multiple times; I unfortunately only heard this once.

When I was released, I was (threatened) not to drive this car until the morning, when I should take it straight to the DMV. If he did catch me driving my car tonight, I would be arrested and my car impounded (technically his authority... but why can't I drive it now if I can in the morning).

When we left with a cab some 30 minutes later, the cab, which was coincidentally the same size as my car, was approached by the first officer's car which then sped off. The second officer/car was not there then.

My wife was never asked to step out of the vehicle, nor did the second office apparently agree with some of the first officer's actions. I'm Hispanic, have been told I look Muslim here (shouldn't be an issue either). For kicks, I can't leave Walmart 1/4 of the time without being asked for a receipt; even on ridiculous purchases. Oh, I've been asked multiple times why I have a diaper bag there - with my toddler in arms."

6westt,fe8txjq,t3_enxhkd,"My cousins wife is pregnant. I recently found out from my cousins son who’s 18 . While I understand her keeping it secret-she’s close to 40yrs of age and their family in general is kind of extremely secretive. Now the keeping secret is not a problem Ofcourse she wants to be safe, but she was worried about not getting pregnant for over a year since marriage and I was showing her how to track ovulation and giving her emotional help as well. I saw her sleeping in daytime some months ago and didn’t seem well, so I jokingly commented you must be pregnant. She said no, just headache. My cousins mother said oh she’s not pregnant. 
So Now I feel very indifferent towards the whole family. They always have problem when people don’t reach out to them in trying times but they’re secretive so how would we know ? 
In response to your wife’s pregnancy, If your siblings don’t ask then you don’t need to tell them respecting your wife’s wishes."
kindofkelly,emaf5c,top_level,"i’m 28 years old, i could be a mother if i really wanted to, that just sounds so weird to me... like, i still feel like this insecure 14 year old girl who has all the time in the world. 

except i’m not, im an adult with responsibilities... i pay bills. people talk about having kids before a certain age but i feel like i’m not going to be ready to have kids before it’s too late and that really sucks. i feel so stunted in my development, i was such a clueless kid and i’m only figuring stuff out now, which is okay, it’s just weird that i have such a finite amount of time to decide whether i want kids or not, then it’s just over.

anyone else feel this way?"

kindofkelly,fdn9nv7,t1_fdn9g1o,"that’s how i’m feeling too, i hear everyone my age talking about having kids, my doctor told me to start thinking about it, everyone tells you how after 35 it’s a geriatric pregnancy.. it’s terrifying, especially when i feel so lost with my career and life in general. the only stable thing i have is my relationship."
Pengaween,fdncdpe,t1_fdn9nv7,"People have to work harder and longer to even afford kids now than they did in the past, so it's getting more and more common for people to have kids later, to not have kids, or to not have biological kids.  We tried getting pregnant years ago, found out we're infertile, did some research, and now I'm happy we're infertile because now I know how desperate the need is for people to foster or to adopt from foster care, and that seems a much better fit for me and with no real time limit to worry about either."
mokrinsky,fdnb0g9,t1_fdn9nv7,"It's not a problem that we are adults. The problem is that adults are us.

I mean I'm only 21 and I'm a guy so I can't really sympathize with you, but I can try and empathize. I think adopting a child who wants nothing more in the world than a happy home and parents who love them would be just as fulfilling as giving birth to a child :)"
That-Blacksmith,fdp49wx,t1_fdn9nv7,"I mean... you don't *have* to have children.

That-Blacksmith,fdp4d3y,t1_fdnb0g9,But would you be a better person?  A worse person?  Or just... different?  And is that difference really desired?
polywha,fdnedgb,t1_fdndx0g,I don't say this out loud a lot because I always get Negative Flack for it but I don't understand why so many people that want kids and struggle to conceive don't just adopt. I find it heartbreaking that someone would go through thousands of dollars and years of treatments to have their own kid when there are hundreds of children that need loving homes so badly. If I ever had a kid I would adopt.
mokrinsky,fdpvonm,t1_fdp4d3y,"I don't know. I'm not even sure it won't make things even more complicated. The only fact is recently I catch myself thinking something like - if I was not alone, the thing I'm doing right now would be much more interesting."
Venomous-Voice,fdnfac4,t1_fdnedgb,"I feel you. I plan on adopting as well. I get the appeal of having a child naturally, but I think adopting is just better for everyone. Personally I don't find infants cute lol. They are cute if you're seeing them occasionally or with them for a day or two at most, but I could take the chubby cheeks and baby smiles and leave the crying all night, the shitting, the screaming... You can pretty much bypass the grueling infant stages by adopting an older child. Those are my selfish reasons for wanting to adopt lol."
That-Blacksmith,fdp4w4t,t1_fdnedgb,"Yeah it's definitely something people will give you shit for, but I think the same.  There are couples who go through round after round after round of IVF, which is seriously expensive and obviously going to be disappointing when it doesn't work...  meanwhile there are children in their own countries and abroad who are languishing in fostering situations or orphanages.  

  They are *desperate* to have children apparently, but only if it's *their* DNA.  I don't know what the word for this is..."
polywha,fdnmdfe,t1_fdnfac4,An older child who has been in the system would also understand what being adopted means more. I can only imagine what it would mean to a child who has had no stability in their most formidable years finally getting a loving home. That's so much more meaningful than popping out another kid in an already crowded world.
Venomous-Voice,fdnvl9s,t1_fdnmdfe,"Yeah that's one of the more appealing aspects of it for me. I've heard (while I don't know if it's true) that many adopting parents look to adopt very young children, so older kids usually get left and eventually grow too old to remain in a foster home."
buffal0gal,fdnfnta,t3_emaf5c,"I finally felt like an adult at 36. I had married, had three kids, bought and sold two houses and had a good career.

Being a Father was something I never intended on and my circumstances have never been anything but hindering. Growing up, I always thought that this was going to be my purpose. I have since realized that isn't quite the case. It's hard and I feel no different than before, except that I have a little one I will have to worry about in addition to the other responsibilities I have. I don't see it as terrible, I don't see it as ideal. Just another aspect of life.

Maybe it's just me, but having a kid is just another thing you CAN do, IF you want. If people around you are saying things to cause you to feel pressure, or if you are comparing yourself to others whom have children and seem happy, take a step back and ask yourself if you want to have things in common with those around you or if you sincerely want a child? 

Personally, I feel like it's carrying wood into a burning house with the way things seem to be going in the world. The point I am trying to make, is that you can think yourself to death over it, but you aren't terrible or out of place for feeling the way you do. Don't rush it if you aren't sure of yourself (="

simplsurvival,fdn9wgm,t3_emaf5c,"Same, except I know I don't want kids, and I have known since.. forever? I'm the proud mother of a 14lb grey cat named Mister. The thought of parenting a small child is terrifying even though I'm pretty financially secure and responsible in general. You don't owe anyone kids or grandkids, and being a mother isn't the price you pay to exist in the world. You do you and go at your own pace."
kindofkelly,fdnacmi,t1_fdn9wgm,"i know that i don’t owe the world kids, i’m always on the fence about it tbh. but i could see myself with a daughter and i’m completely sure that i’m with a man that i want to spend the rest of my life with, i just know that right now, and probably the next couple years isn’t the right time.. 

my biggest gripe is simply the limited amount of time in which i’m fertile. if i knew i had another 20 years to have a kid, i would be totally set and not worrying about it at all. but knowing i maybe have 12 years? maybe? that’s awful to me."
IttenBittenLilDitten,fdnbu5s,t3_emaf5c,"Even when you have kids, you won't be ready. It's one of those things where you just shoot your shot and live with it"
Silent_Palpatine,fdpqzpk,t3_emaf5c,"The stranger realisation is when all your mates, the ones you went out with and got stupid with, are now parents. Then you feel two things: 

1. A sense of isolation now that going on mad benders down the clubs is out of the question for them as the little one won’t stop crying. 

2. The shocking realisation that our parents were the same and didn’t have a clue about anything either! Those omniscient beings who raised us were just making it up as they went."
tummybobby,fdn9kl6,t3_emaf5c,"I'm 21 and I feel you! I used to drink before but strangely alcohol lost the appeal to me (legal age here is 18 so not illegal) and sometimes I just realize I can get married right now and have kids and start a family (not uncommon here) but it kinda weirds me out. I feel like a 10 year old sometimes, I still watch cartoons, etc.

To your problem tho, I can wager that you'd rather raise a child properly than do it rushed because ""I better do it before I get infertile"" or something. And when that time comes that you feel you want to raise a child, you'll do great because you care. Some people even view their children as retirement money source (I know some). Besides, you're still young. A lot can happen in 10 years. So you can rest assued that that time will come."
ShiroiTora,fdncnlc,t1_fdn9kl6,"I think its less about the infertility and more about the higher risk for birth complications after 30 (premature birth, still born, certain genetic disorders like down syndrome, etc).



That being said, adoption is always an option"
kindofkelly,fdn9x18,t1_fdn9kl6,"im definitely an adult child, i still watch cartoons all the time lol. 

i really appreciate your response, i definitely think that’s the reason for me, i want to be responsible and 100% ready to have a child, and it’s so unfair that i might not be ready mentally until after my fertility is gone."
tummybobby,fdpl0oc,t1_fdncnlc,"Oh, honestly I have no idea about it (being a guy and all). That seriously sucks. I wish there's just a tool for pregnancy that you can use anytime, without side effects for the child or something. But one can only hope."
tummybobby,fdnak0s,t1_fdn9x18,"A lot of options would still be available I guess. I think there's an egg storage service kinda like sperm storage (honestly I have no idea, but I'd wager there is), there's also in vithro, or adoption."
kindofkelly,fdnq8yc,t1_fdnak0s,"the only issue with the other options are that most of them are expensive, it feels like a luxury to even have a child naturally but when you add treatments or adoption into the mix, i always wonder how anyone affords having children."
tummybobby,fdpkwa7,t1_fdnq8yc,"Oh yea, you're right. Like I said, that time will come, and I hope you won't encounter any problems when that time comes."
Wanderlustskies,fdn9tcd,t3_emaf5c,It’s so insane to me that my sister had a kid at like 21. I’d have an 8 year old by now and that’s so weird!!! I think it’s be nice to have a baby... but like in 3 years as long as I have actually found someone to be with and everything
Askaram,fdnawzu,t3_emaf5c,"I feel you. I might only be 22, but I feel like a 15 year old who happens to pay bills. It's so weird, some of my friends already have children and I still like to watch cartoons. I sometimes just feel so... Lost? I expected to be much more mature at that age, but it seems like I got even less mature."
candysirling,fdnc2uc,t3_emaf5c,"I feel this in my bones my sister's both had kids by my age, but they both got divorced and are with better people now. But they asked me when I plan on it since I'm 29 now. 

I don't want kids if I don't have a good partner first also I'm starting my own business and that's going to take a lot of time and money."
purplemamabear,fdnca5g,t3_emaf5c,You still have at least 15 years before it starts to get to the point where you wouldn’t want to get pregnant. My husband’s mom was 42 when he was born and he was the youngest of 12. By comparison I was 31 when I had my first child. Everything changes when you turn 30.
togtogtog,fdpwgjz,t1_fdnca5g,"If someone really wants children, then they should be aware that fertility for women declines sharply after 35 years old. https://www.britishfertilitysociety.org.uk/fei/at-what-age-does-fertility-begin-to-decrease/"
purplemamabear,fec7szl,t1_fdpwgjz,"Lol. Dude. I took four different biology classes in college, and three psychology courses centering around birthing and rearing children. I am also a woman. I know how it works. Just because it declines doesn’t mean it isn’t possible. Women are having children into their 50s now (straight from my midwife’s mouth), it’s just riskier and more difficult, but it can be done."
togtogtog,fectppu,t1_fec7szl,"Yes, I agree with everything you say. It can be done (my friend had her first child at 47). I was just pointing out that the chance that you will be able to get pregnant is lower, so you may not be able to get pregnant. It's never a certainty that you will be able to. I'm a woman, in my 50s, and will not be having children now, as I have no eggs left."
lanacaneMAX,fdncoxq,t3_emaf5c,"I’m 42 and mom to a 14 year old.  I only started to feel like what I assume an adult should feel like after I turned 30, probably closer to 35.  My husband is 9 years older than me, we both wanted one child and he didn’t want to be an old dad, so we went for it right after we got married.  
There are lots of things that should be taken into consideration before having a child, so  do keep talking about it with your partner.  What you two think is the most important.  :)"
asaasmltascp,fdnfhvw,t3_emaf5c,"I think it's important to not put adults and adulthood on a pedestal where it's unattainable. Most adults enjoy watching the cartoons they watched when they were young, most until now couldn't due to the way TV was set up. 

I had my first baby at 19 and he's getting into the age where I'm pulling out my old movies and buying my old favorite TV series and watching it with him. He loves my old shows and we watch them together and I love it. I gave him my old toys and he plays with them. I show him games I used to play as a kid. I pay bills, go to work, and act like a parent to him so he is well mannered, but afterwards I spend time with my son doing the same stuff I did as a child. Having a child has its perks when you still enjoy kid stuff."
ipeflower,fdnwejn,t3_emaf5c,"I felt so weird for being this way but I am happy to know I am not alone. I am 21, I am married and want to have kids, but there are so many things I want to accomplish first and I am childish. It's weird, but I love being the way I am. I love my cartoons, my videogame hahahaha so much to enjoy and so little time"
Salsa_Overlord,fdo30zb,t3_emaf5c,I feel this so hard. I’m still a guy in mid 20s but at this point my dad was raising 2 kids. I’ve been saying I don’t want kids for years and it’s been more than anything because I still feel like a child and a child can’t raise children in my mind. I still have plenty of time to get there but I feel like I never will. To steal a John Mulaney joke it’s like having a horse raise a dog.

TheHairyScribe,fdo8qek,t3_emaf5c,"Having children is NOT a requirement of being a human being. Some people think it’s your responsibility TO have kids. I feel quite the opposite. Every time someone asks me and/or my gf when or if we are having kids, I tell them never. And more people should follow suit."
kindofkelly,fdo9ueq,t1_fdo8qek,"okay but my issue is that i’m torn between wanting and not wanting them, it’s not a requirement and really not many people in my life see it as one, but it doesn’t mean i will never want one in the future."
fishtankbabe,fdogyhv,t1_fdo9ueq,"Honestly, if you ask yourself whether you want kids and the answer isn't an immediate ""hell yes!!!"" then it's a no. Too much at stake to risk having them and them spend the rest of your life regretting it. And you still have time to change your mind, you don't need to have one right now."
scarvesandcoffee,fdobyh4,t3_emaf5c,"Are you me? I'm exactly the same. 

My close friends are getting married, having kids and I'm there like.... what is a relationship? To be fair, I'm not even sure if I want kids, I've been single for waaay too long and I enjoy my solitude. 

But...I got into a crisis when within one year half of my friends got married, then doctors and other people started warning me about running of out time for pregnancy and I just keep thinking - I still feel like a child at 28. 

I know I am not a child, I am aware that I am a fully functioning adult but I feel so lost and like I'm falling behind. I know there are no set time frames in life but when everyone around you is doing one thing, you start to feel like something is wrong with you."

tinknickers,fdqgeo6,t3_emaf5c,"It's like reading my own thoughts! I'm 29, married, furnished my own place and lived alone from 18 up to moving in with my husband. In that time I've always paid my bills, ran the home and had to 'adult'. I have worked really 'grown up' jobs and always felt like I was a kid in a suit!

My mum has some health issues and the added responsibility has made me see areas I'm more mature than some of my peers but when it comes to having kids I feel like I wouldn't be mature enough!

Me AND my husband like nothing more than spending all our spare cash on a load of sweets and treats from the shop, getting a pizza and eating it in our bedroom(!) whilst watching cartoons!

We decided 4 years ago to 'see what happens'

The thing is my mum went through menopause early (early 30s), I have some fertility issues which has meant we haven't conceived in the last 4 years (no contraception but not tracking ovulation or putting 'effort' in), & medical professionals say a woman's fertility sharply declines after 35 anyway!

Also I want my kids to know my mum for them as well as for her and like I said, her health is a concern.

So now it's time we either go see a fertility specialist and go through IVF or we take the risk that our time runs out and we did nothing with it...but it makes it so so real to go to a fertility clinic and it's brought home just how unsure I am!

I want more time! I want kids but just maybe years from now..."

I realized at one point that I'd never have kids because I'd only want kids if I really loved who I was with. Not just love her, but in love for life, not just that month until the thrill is gone and fades into companionship."

As for being ready to have kids, I think it's one of those things where if you think about it too much it'll just scare you because there is no ""perfect"" time or age to have kids (although I do believe if you feel truly emotionally/financially unprepared, don't have kids!)."
drekia,fdplh1p,t3_emaf5c,"I’ve honestly always thought from a logical perspective it would be ideal to have a baby in your early 20’s. Then by the time they’re ready to move out, you are still fairly young with plenty of time to live your life. But I DEFINITELY wasn’t ready in my early 20’s, and I’m 25 now and still I don’t think I’m ready. I still need to get my GED, maybe further education, still need to work on finding a new good job... my boyfriend is doing good at his job and knows his shit pretty well, and we could probably could financially afford a child in time but it is a scary thought. I would guess by the time I’m 27-30 I might be ready but at the same time that seems so soon?! The other issue is my fertility. I have PCOS which apparently can cause issues with fertility. At the moment, I have no idea if I’m even capable of having a child. I find myself wondering if it’s better to try now rather than later when my chances would be even worse. Also, my mom died in her late 30’s. I often think about that and wonder if I will die young like her too. She had 12 years with me because she had me fairly young. The idea of leaving my child when they are so young breaks my heart. 

The good side is, I don’t doubt I could care for a child. I actually loved helping to care for my baby brother, even the bad nights where he had a hard time sleeping and crying a lot. But the physical aspect of giving birth is quite intimidating.

It really is a struggle to think about. I’m not even sure if most people fully think about it, they just kinda... do it. 🙃"

togtogtog,fdpw2r2,t3_emaf5c,"Firstly, not having kids can be great. It means you have more time and energy for all sorts of other things, for other people's kids, for nephews and nieces, for family, for friends. You have energy for getting out and doing stuff, for going places, for being creative, quiet time to think. I can have long, uninterrupted conversations, or read books, or write, or climb, or go out in the evenings, sing, do the gardening, get jobs done quickly and efficiently.

Also, life is wonderful in that you continue to change and grow all the time if you choose to. My mum is in her 80s and still has new insights. Growing up is partially about learning to be a good, kind parent to yourself, so that no one else has to do this for you."

rimfire7,fdrfdiq,t1_fdqbpu8,I hear you. Food is my thing. But if I have health goals I purposely think of those goals while I am having a craving for an unhealthy snack. It helps me to move past the craving without indulging.
SweetLiesBitterTruth,fdqrxua,t3_empdo8,"Nah. It's ramen plus you buy that $1.59 bag of frozen veggies and add a half cup, also add an egg. Very cheap but extremely fortifying.  Add in sauce packets from restaurants for flavor (Soy and mustard from chinese places, or fast food places often have hot sauces or various things for free).

Taco bell way better value anyways, two $1 tostadas are super filling, then ask for 3 extra tortillas (specify mexican pizza shells or tostada shells) for $.30 each for another $.90, plus 4 free sides of red sauce (in one large container for ease), and you have your self a proper meal on the super cheap total of $2.90 + tax."

stephenfawkes,fdstbrg,t3_empdo8,"Try doing what I do. 
I toast a couple slices of bread, then spread tuna on top of each slice. Coat the tuna in pepper. 
Then I put cucumber slices on top of the bread. I usually salt the cucumber for extra flavour. Voila, easy, healthy lunch or dinner that tastes delicious and is much cheaper than fast food"
Banner80,fdqfdbq,t3_empdo8,"I keep boxes of deluxe mac and cheese ($1.50) for days that I need a pick me up, then I'll go to the store and buy a bounty of proteins and vegetables to make a rich breakfast and lunch tomorrow. That's how I'd use those $20 (actually less). I don't eat ramen or pop tarts, my food is not that expensive, and I enjoy it. Feel free to join my side, there's plenty of room here and it's more fun than crying while eating ramen, and far more healthy than anything Jack In the Box sells.

When you think of fast food as an emotional crutch, not only it's a shitty crutch to lean on, you are hurting your body when you could be nurturing it, and it's also burning your money needlessly. A fun healthy meal at home is wholesome, nurturing and way cheaper. So I'd say try to replace that fast food habit with a love for the kitchen.

For instance, next time try this: 1 box of deluxe mac and cheese, 1 lb of chicken breast dressed in bbq sauce, and throw in 1/4 pound of frozen vegetables medley in with the chicken. This meal is large (2 servings), around $4, and you are eating something that heals the soul and falls close to healthy. Also dead easy to make. (Note: for me this is not an everyday meal, it's for when you want some soul food. On the regular I would not be eating this much grain/sugar and cheese powder)."
Dewellah,fdrl8h5,t1_fdqfdbq,I was thinking this too. Spend the $20 on some groceries (not Pop Tarts & Ramen either) - & eat good for a couple days.

Banner80,fdsicv3,t1_fdrrjxf,"I hear you, but this is the reason fast food is dragging down our society. It's so easy to relax the standards and just enjoy a tasty bad meal from the local addiction supplier.

I'm encouraging you to forge a new relationship with food. Cut costs while nurturing your body, and learn to see food as something you have to dedicate some time in your life, but it's well worth it because the benefits are right in line with what your goals for your life are: use your money more effectively, treat yourself to good foods, be happier, fitter, feel better physically for having more nutrition and mentally for making gains.

I don't remember the last time I craved a fast food burger. I enjoy them, but there are so many delicious treats I know how to make at home that are cheaper, healthier and I enjoy very much. As part of my fitness routine I'm supposed to take food cheat days but many weeks I have to remind myself to do it because I enjoy my regular ""diet"" food enough that I don't feel like making myself a cheat meal when I can just keep eating my regular stuff. I also enjoy feeling good and seeing physical gains, so now the idea of eating fries and hurting my progress makes me upset.

Picture how much nicer life can be when you have developed a habit of dedicating some time every day to the kitchen, and you've developed a few cheap+easy recipes that you enjoy making and eating. This is what I'm inviting you towards, it's so much better in terms of financial and health goals, and better wholesome fun you can be proud of."

Krux99,fdlk75i,t1_fdl8aeo,"Yeah lol. I was so blown away by the responses I did get, I didn't keep track of who all responded. 

You should try it sometime tho. It's actually a great feeling, and you get an idea for why people appreciate you"
TJRich2004,fdlf6j7,t3_elua4k,"Next time you feel down, how about you try this - text each one of your friends and tell them about the thing you think is neat about them!

Complimenting others is guaranteed to make you feel good about yourself."
Krux99,fdljsgj,t1_fdlf6j7,"Oooh, good point"
Iam_H-,fdlmhri,t3_elua4k,"It is very cool of you to do that, you know. Honestly, I would have panicked and backed away. You are brave af"
Krux99,fdlnsuu,t1_fdlmhri,I believe in you! You can also try giving out random comments. I started doing that for the people who responded to me and it felt great to know how much they appreciated it
dirtydallas40,fdlmmd5,t3_elua4k,"Love this and glad what you tried was a success, woohoo to good vibes"
Krux99,fdlnddb,t1_fdlmmd5,Yeah! Positivity all around
LobeliaWisteria,fdn1x3o,t3_elua4k,"Man that is brave! I've heard of it being done before and thought about trying it, but I didn't want to come across as conceited or fishing for compliments. Plus some of my friends do not do words of affirmation. Like, at all. They would probably find it really really awkward. 
Plus a part of me thinks if it's prompted it's less sincere.
I am so impressed you did it. Glad your friends were kind. And now you have this lovely collection of notes to lift you up, so your bravery really paid off! Really, go you!"
hiftikha,eo136i,top_level,I am so STOKED to start my new sweet job! I'm going to give them the gift of my dedication and utilize this mutually beneficial opportunity to the max and grow as an engineer as well as a human being! I'M SO HAPPY :D

BryndenRivers13,fe8invc,t3_eo136i,"Trying to get a job can be extremely stressing. What people do not often realise are the psychological repercussions of not working; sometimes it's better to work for less than not to work at all.

Bubbly-Eggplant,fe8txz7,t3_eo136i,Congrats! I will hopefully be in the same position in the next month or two. Trying to leave my toxic job right now - it's so exhausting.
SocraticDeciple,fe8u5nb,t3_eo136i,Congratulations... Perhaps next time though... Get the new job BEFORE you quit the toxic one. The trick is not waiting until you can no longer tolerate being there. Recognize it early and start interviewing before you quit. You may have to use sick days for interview dates... Or schedule your interviews for times you already have off.
TSwizzlesNipples,fe8z57h,t3_eo136i,"Make sure you don't take that toxic attitude with you. I used to work for a company whose culture was so fucking bad that if you worked there, no one in the city would hire you. They would go out of their way to avoid employees because they didn't want their corporate culture infected with the toxicity of that company.

Congrats on getting out, OP."
Akashk9,fe9uunx,t3_eo136i,"Congratulations! It's soo difficult when u quite the toxic environment. There's always this nag at the back of your head wether u made the right move.. but to reach some new place, u do have to leave the old one."
92mermaid,fea3m9r,t3_eo136i,Congrats! I know how difficult it can be navigating a toxic workplace and trying to stay present in the last few weeks once you’ve secured a new job.

I made a small story/quest for D&D, where you introduce into your world creating new spells, while doing an emotional quest where 2 sisters look for the cure of a disease. 

I posted it to dmsguild.com where you make the material avaliable for anyone, and I set it up for ""pay what you want"". And someone paid 50 cents :D 

It's not much, but knowing someone read it and actually went for all the trouble of paying for it, makes me so happy <3

koozmann,eo630d,top_level,"I know i doesn’t sound very impressive but for the past 2 years i have smoked weed almost every night when i was just relaxing. I decided this year i cant have a dependence on a drug, i am an adult now and i should be acting like one. So i went the entire week without smoking and my next goals is a month! Its a little silly but small victories should be acknowledged too.

Edit: it has been super helpful using my time in the evenings on more productive activities! Ive been drawing more  and focusing on my studies. Also includes a little bit of portal ;)"
noplzstop,fe8xr76,t3_eo630d,"People say weed isn't addictive but aside from just being mentally addictive (which anything can be, but weed especially is), a lot of habitual smokers who quit have really bad nauseau, lack of appetite, and shitty sleep.

The good news is that only lasts about a week or so, and it definitely gets a lot easier as you go. From one former daily smoker to another, congrats!"
koozmann,fe8y1qw,t1_fe8xr76,"Thank you for your kind words! I was definitely had a hard time sleeping this week but the main thing was i was overthinking everything, maybe thats just my brain waking up lol."
noplzstop,fe92wtr,t1_fe8y1qw,"Yup, you'll get used to it. I'm the same way, and weed did help calm that down for me, but it's not a healthy or sustainable solution.

I realized by doing that, I wasn't smoking to get high for fun, I was smoking just to feel normal. Better to adjust to feeling normal, you know, normally than to need to smoke something to do it.

Because I smoked so frequently, I had basically unlimited tolerance. Now when I smoke (which I do only occasionally, I don't buy it myself or keep it in the house anymore), I have to stop myself after like two hits or I get like stupid high. That's actually kind of nice sometimes, being able to enjoy it like I used to when I first smoked, but I set those pretty strict rules for myself so I don't fall back into the old habits. I didn't smoke for a few years before I even let myself smoke in social situations, but even still, the one time I did buy a stash for myself at home, I couldn't resist smoking it every chance I got, so I know I'm still not ready for that.

One other thing I noticed was my dreams got much more vivid. I basically didn't dream when I was smoking daily, which isn't uncommon. It was actually kind of hard to adjust to, especially having a bad dream, because they were so much more vivid than any I had during the years I smoked heavily."
noplzstop,fe9591e,t1_fe9115u,"That's exactly what the case is. The high itself is addictive. That's why people can develop unhealthy addictions to anything that causes pleasure, like sex, running, video games, even though there's nothing chemically addictive about them. 

What's strange, though, is that nausea, lack of appetite, and trouble sleeping are all pretty common side effects daily weed smokers have from quitting. Those could be psychosomatic, but they still appear to be physical symptoms. It's possible that while none of the compounds in marijuana are chemically addictive like nicotine is, they lead to adjustments in brain chemistry that cause people to experience a sort of withdrawal when they're stopped. The addictive part is the high, but the effects on brain or body chemistry can still produce other symptoms from suddenly stopping after years of using it multiple times a day. 

As someone who struggles with cigarette addiction, I know firsthand how different those things are, but they're also more similar than you might expect. Quitting weed and cigarettes both came with mental and physical side effects. Nicotine withdrawals were harsher and lasted longer, because there's a proven physical component to nicotine addiction, but I still found quitting weed to be about as unpleasant for that first week as quitting cigarettes. The difference was that afterwards, it was easier to not fall back into weed because you don't have those physical addiction pathways built like with cigarettes (which I fully quit for like 6 months, started smoking occasionally while drunk and now I'm back to smoking like 1-3 a day with cravings for more than that even)"
Gabbianoo,fe91po4,t1_fe9115u,"And with this j don't wanna understate your job quitting weed  dude. Because the ""stoned"" feeling can actually be addictive. You did a great job fam"
koozmann,fe96c2u,t1_fe9115u,Not a being a dickhead you are right! The addictive part was the fact it was a nightly ritual and my day didn’t feel complete unless i smoked a fat bowl lol.
koozmann,fe95yfh,t1_fe92wtr,"I relate to all of this, i have terrible self control in all aspects of life and weed is certainly no exception. I still have my bong which i think i should probably just throw out.

Im not going to quit smoking entirely and i am excited to feel as though getting high is a special occasion and a treat appose to being a part of my routine. 
 
My dreams have been so vivid this week and is that something that goes away or will i just have to live with it?  

I appreciate you sharing your experiences, its comforting to know people have gone through the same things as me!  :)"
koozmann,fe9btgh,t1_fe9591e,"I was  so oblivious to the fact that smoking everyday was not a healthy life choice. The fact i wasn’t smoking during the day and saying on top of my studies allowed me to justify smoking every night.  I would just label it as self care, which is honestly delusional.

I sympathize with your struggle and appreciate you sharing!"
noplzstop,fe98x5z,t1_fe95yfh,"The dreams definitely calmed down after a little while, definitely. And no problem! I think a lot of people have this idea that weed just isn't addictive so they tend to think that the shitty way they feel when they first quit is just how they're always going to feel when they're not high, which just isn't true. Sharing these experiences helps us get through the tough parts and past the urge to fall back into old habits, so I'm glad to do it! 

I'm not going to say you should throw out your bong, I understand the attachment for sure, but I'd say give it a few months before you try smoking at all, just so you get it out of your system and mentally readjust. If you smoke occasionally during the period, I feel like it sorta refreshes the mental addiction before you've overcome it, prolonging that mental refresh which you need after smoking daily for so long (or at least, I know I did). 

With tobacco, that's definitely the case because of the physical addiction, so YMMV, but it's easy to fall back into any addiction if you don't let your mind readjust and get used to life without it. Once you're there, that's when you can figure out a way to fit it into your life in healthy moderation. I love smoking, but I also never want to feel like I need it to feel normal again."
kristalwash,febi2wi,t1_fe95yfh,"Hi OP. I am at 30 days weed-free today. I am still having really vivid (and mostly bad honestly) dreams. Although I will say that I'm still testing positive on at home drug tests so it might just be the THC still getting out of my system? I'm not super sure why it makes your dreams so vivid. 

I recently learned that using really high THC percentage makes it stay in your system longer. I was using medical marijuana daily and 80%+ vapes and dab concentrates so I think that's why it's been a month and I'm still testing positive for it. If you've been using the good stuff, you might have the dreams for awhile too."
koozmann,fe9l6up,t1_fe98x5z,"I am for sure going to wait a while until try I smoking again because it will be several months before i wont feel ashamed to smoke. I have faith in myself that i can adopt healthy habits from here on and use weed in moderation.

Thank you for the advice on the dreams, they haven’t been particularly bad but i have woken up very stressed a few times. My dreams tend to be  plausible situations and it takes me a moment to realize it didn’t actually happen."
koozmann,febmvid,t1_febi2wi,Thanks for the heads up!! I definitely used some stronger strains but i don’t think  up to 80% i was never too particular with my weed.
noplzstop,fe9qlq1,t1_fe9l6up,"I went through the same thing. I'd dream something totally plausible but fucked up like a friend doing something shitty or me making a huge mistake at work and getting fired and it was super stressful. If the dreams weren't awful, they were usually super mundane but vivid enough I would remember them and would occasionally get confused over whether something happened in a dream or IRL. 

But like I said, that seems to have calmed down after a while. Took a few weeks, I think, but it's not an issue for me anymore. 

It sounds like you've got good internal motivation to keep on track, which is key. Try to remember why you stopped when you get tempted, and notice if you're bargaining with yourself trying to justify breaking that motivation. I catch myself doing that a lot, which is why I set pretty strict rules to myself (and still sometimes struggle with them)."
koozmann,fe9z2g5,t1_fe9qlq1,"Ya I’ve mainly been dreaming about school related stuff  which is the most stressful for me haha.   

I do feel super motivated and i want to apply this motivation to other parts of my life too!!"
DesertStorm11,fe9cy8m,t3_eo630d,"This is amazing! Even if you go one day without it, it’s still an accomplishment. Never underestimate those accomplishments.

Gabbianoo,fe8w4yv,t3_eo630d,Can weed really be addicting? Damn
koozmann,fe8wocx,t1_fe8w4yv,People always say that its not because you don’t get physical withdrawals but i most certainly felt addicted ive especially when you mix it with tobacco every night.
Gabbianoo,fe8xw7c,t1_fe8wocx,"Nice one tho, you are a good man. I'll never quit smoking cigarettes, already told my parents. ""Mom, dad? I just wanted to let you know I'll die with a cigarette between my right hand fingers"" 

Seriously tho. I think that to quit an addiction there's only one way: be motivated.
A newborn can motivate you, as I did with my dad who quitted cigarettes.
A wife can motivate you. 
Whatever just find your own motivation"
Gabbianoo,fe8xf4f,t1_fe8wocx,Are you sure you aren't addicted to tobacco then? Because I am addicted to tobacco and smoke weed regularly but I could stay without weed literally for months without any problem.
ChrisishereO2,fe9szyh,t1_fe8wocx,For me it is especially since music sounds so good on it as well. It makes it even more addictive. Also the taste.
koozmann,fe8ylya,t1_fe8xw7c,This is so true! I have recently entered a new relationship and she motivates me to be the best version of myself and i attribute this weeks success to her as well as own strong will.
koozmann,fe8y9hq,t1_fe8xf4f,I think its definitely a mixture of both but in the evenings i was thinking more about getting high than the relief of smoking tobacco.
koozmann,fe9yi9b,t1_fe9szyh,Yes listening to music while stoned was for sure one of my favourite activities but I’m trying to find new music to enjoy sober!
Gabbianoo,fe8zu3t,t1_fe8ylya,"Good one, bless you and good luck ☺️"
scooterdog,fe9be6q,t1_fe8ylya,"I read with interest looking for this OP - what was the motivation for the change.

May you be the best version of yourself, change is hard and good for you to just go for it. 

One book you may want to consider is Duhigg's The Power of Habit - some interesting insights there about habits and how important it is to form good ones, as well as encouragement to keep at it until you don't really think about it anymore.

Lastly I hope you continue with substituting productive things as well as making room for other forms of entertainment, in terms of how you use your time. All the best!"
ChrisishereO2,fe9z3yt,t1_fe9yi9b,Listen to Tool! I used it to help me get through struggles like addiction etc. It’s just an unbelievable band with so much meaning to there music and attention to detail. Start with the album Lateralus.
koozmann,fe8zzey,t1_fe8zu3t,"Thank you, i got this 💪"
koozmann,fe9ka4p,t1_fe9be6q,"The main motivation was that i turned 21 this year and i still felt as though i was acting like i was in high school and that getting stoned was still a priority.

Dr_Brown_Bro,feb6ie1,t3_eo630d,"Great job! Seriously!!! You should be very proud of yourself. 😊 As a regular pot smoker since 17 (28 now) I know how hard it can be to cut back, let alone quit altogether.

I've gone stone cold sober this new year and decade as I've gone through a lot of significant life changes that were quite traumatic. From October 2019 up until January 1st I was smoking every day from when I woke up until I went to sleep. I thought I would have major withdrawals and just be an ass because of it as I have I  the past when I tried to quit, but honestly it's been a very nice change. Also, I have two girls (2 years, 8 months) that I get 2 days out of the week and they've been a big motivator to stay clean and clear minded."
koozmann,febav1w,t1_feb6ie1,"Thank for this sentiment, the only way i know i can cut back is to go full cold turkey because ive tried and failed in the past. But to be honest this time feels different. 


Im sorry to hear you went through a rough time earlier but it seems you have things to be proud of this year! Keep it up :))"
Dr_Brown_Bro,febb0xw,t1_febav1w,Thank you! You keep it up too! I believe in you! :)
WellYouCouldAlways,febq3p6,t3_eo630d,"I've been off weed for 3 months now. I'll probably go back eventually cause i still want to smoke, but my hope is that I can control myself after forcing myself to quit. 

One week is a great accomplishment and it will get easier from here, though I still would like to smoke it's more along the lines of a craving and it passes eventually when I don't cede to it. 

I smoked daily for 5 years, at least 2, but up to 12 blunts on a more average day. When I quit I couldn't sleep, I didn't eat for 4 days, I hated life and pretty much felt like shit. I commend you for sticking to it and remember that you can go as long as you want, it's all a question of willpower."
koozmann,febsd5l,t1_febq3p6,This was very inspirational thank you! This has been a shitty week where i felt so stuck in my own head but your encouraging words are helpful and appreciated.
MY_NAME_IS_LAPIS,febqo89,t3_eo630d,"Congrats! I'm also managing my weed consumption more and it's really not easy. I'd hug you rn if I could. Also, if you need more encouragement, just think about how much deeper you experience life when you aren't high. You got this."
koozmann,febsum8,t1_febqo89,Thank you!  i am trying to concentrate on building more genuine relationships with the people around me instead of thinking about when i can go home and get high lol.
redwheelbarrow9,fecybg4,t3_eo630d,"Major props to you, dude! One of the hardest things for me was figuring out what to do with all that free time— good on you for keeping busy. 

You may not be able to become chemically addicted to weed, but you can most certainly become addicted to not being sober. A week may not feel like much, but it is. 

Be proud of yourself!"
Finishx,em8prp,top_level,"So I'm a 22yo guy and I hated reading as a child, it reminded me of studying and i was much more into video games. In 2017, after watching game of thrones, i got the ASOIAF books and got through the first 2 books and a little bit of the third before i stopped and thought i'd reread and finish them when the 6th book is out ( rip my hopeless dream). Didn't read anything until i decided to pick up harry potter and the philosopher stone last april, and boy did i enjoy reading that. 

After finishing the HP series i felt some sort of emptiness and i knew i had to find another book, so i ended up getting mistborn and i absolutely loved it. I was so love in with mistborn that i used to read around 100 pages a day ! I am an introvert with no life so i spent whole days just reading. The max number of pages i read in a single day was around 200 pagea and i shall not repeat that again for the sake of my poor eyes.

 As of now, i am reading the Anne of Green Gables books and i am totally in love with them. For the first time i found myself tearing up over a book haha ! I honestly don't know how i spent my entire life without reading novels !"

Cardinal_Funky,fdnjwwe,t3_em8prp,"I like reading, but almost everything I read starts to become irritating either because the ending the author intended wasn't the one I wanted or because aspects of the novel changed later in the story.

A recent Korean Light Novel that I was heavily invested in was Solo Leveling, written by  Chu-Gong. Almost everything about this Light Novel was PERFECT. It wasn't until they started introducing more powerful characters that it completed ruined the whole book for me; it made all other ""main"" characters seem like fillers.

Another book I read back in high school was more of a murder mystery. It was good, until it got to the point where my brain couldn't create imagery for the rest of the story. You know the feeling where the author tries to describe the surroundings in the book, but for some reason it just doesn't cohesively come together in your head? That was me..........

I love reading. At least, I love reading when I find a story that I start to become heavily invested in. Unfortunately for me,  Chu-Gong, the author of Solo Leveling intended for everything to happen as it did. Sure, it was a happy ending, but not the ending I personally wanted. While it is one of the best books I read in 2019, I will always regard that book as being just like the rest...........towards the end it was just not for me.

I hope 2020 will change that. I need a book that will not only keep me motivated to want to keep reading it, but also enjoy it from start to finish, wanting more."

Dieselsmom74,fdkzapw,t3_ely1r3,Stay hydrated and keep busy. If it gets super bad go to any emergency room and tell them you are going through alcohol withdrawal. There are medications to help get you through the worst of the physical stuff.  I thank you for making this choice. You are worth it.

josephalbright1,fdl0b3v,t3_ely1r3,"Talk to your doctor. There is medication that can help. Just out of curiosity, how much did you drink a day?"
HumaneCentiPad,fdl0kzi,t1_fdl0b3v,I would typically go through a 1.75 liter bottle of spirits every couple of days. For a while I was downing a bottle of everclear in 3 days. Sometimes 2. It was pretty bad.
three_by_five,fdl86h4,t3_ely1r3,">Any advice?

I think the top comment says this already, but I'd just echo 'keep busy'. You'd be amazed how much of your time gets freed up when you're not planning to drink, getting a drink, drinking, passing out, being hung over, and then doing it all over again. The biggest struggle is probably going to be finding ways to fill that time that aren't equally destructive.

With all that free time, it might also be worth thinking about *why* you drink so you can spot your triggers. Mindfulness is a big part of this; when you find yourself reaching for a bottle, don't beat yourself up about it... celebrate the fact that you caught yourself, and then think about what happened (and what you felt) that made you want to drink. It doesn't need to be deep, earth-shattering, or navel-gazing... in a lot of cases, it might just be boredom. Or to be social. Or to help fall asleep. My point is when you start to figure out why you're drinking, that'll help you create new associations for those feelings, rather than just numbing them.

That might be a little granola, but that's what I've got. Good luck. You're making a great decision that's really going to improve your life, and I really hope it goes well for you."
HumaneCentiPad,fdl8gri,t1_fdl86h4,Nah man Its good advice. I first got into the habit when my fiance walked out on me. So I used the alcohol to kill any negative feelings. Now I'm having to deal with those feelings and it honestly sucks more than the physical discomfort.
echomikeindialima,fdlcn7n,t1_fdl8gri,"It sure does. I'm happy you find this persons advice useful, because I totally agree with him. Never had any alcohol problems myself, but mindfulness (among other things) helped me back from hitting the wall (not sure if that translates well, but over stressed to the limit that you start to get physical reactions like bad hearing and stuff). And I'm pretty sure that if you apply it in the way he describes it can at least do no harm and very likely help you get better!
Whish you all the best and also thank you for making this decision, I'm sure you will be very proud of yourself once you're through!
Oh, and in case no one else mentioned it: this is an illness. It might be a mental one, but it's still an illness. Nobody would expect you to be able to live normally if you were recovering from a broken leg, but somehow some people dont understand that mental illnesses are just the same. This means you need to be kind to yourself. If someone offers you help with something, accept it! If you feel really under the ice some day, allow yourself to call in sick and if you feel the need ask a doctor for medical assistance or whatever they can help you with. Once again best of luck!"
Amadai,fdl9gx5,t3_ely1r3,Come join us at r/stopdrinking. It's a great support group. You got this OP!
LittleMissLovely,fdlbn2w,t3_ely1r3,"Just wanted to hop in here and say that you're not alone. 

I'm currently 2 weeks 'tapered' or whatever you want to call it. I tried cold turkey several times and always gave up on day 3. I tapered down from my nightly bottle to 1-2 beers every other night. I know its not 'ideal' but for me, its amazing progress that I cannot complain about. I'm not sure I can ever be completely sober, especially not in social settings, but I no longer feel like shit every day and I feel like I have some control over the situation and my life again. 

Keep pushing. You got this <3"
HumaneCentiPad,fdld5pz,t1_fdlbn2w,"Thats kind of what I'm going for as well. I don't want to give it up completely. I like to go out and drink with my buddies. I just want to learn moderation and actually be in charge of the drink, rather than the other way around."
squirreltard,fdncsos,t1_fdld5pz,That doesn’t usually work out for people. Get professional help. DTs can give you seizures and kill you. Thinking you can control it is typically denial all addicts go through. Good luck.
bossoline,fdld1ji,t3_ely1r3,"Health care professional, here. I'm glad you're getting healthy.

I would caution you that alcohol withdrawal can be life threatening if it gets bad. It might be a good idea to do this with some medical supervision, given how much toy were drinking. If you don't have a doctor, you might try to get some support from local resources.

Good for you, man. Good luck."

matiuhhh,fdl7h5z,t3_ely1r3,"I don’t have any physical advice, but just remember to let yourself be recovering. If the withdrawal gets too bad, go to the doctor. Take what healthy medicine you need. Take a day off work if you need to. If you relapse into excessive drinking, that’s okay. Keep pushing. Recovery isn’t a linear process and it’s hard as hell, but keep pushing through it. You’ll get there."
HumaneCentiPad,fdl7ot5,t1_fdl7h5z,Thanks man. I'm feeling confident but it's also only day 2 so I know it's gonna get worse before it gets better.

manicboi_vs_mania,fdl2el9,t3_ely1r3,"Look into a supplement called Phenibut. 



(Everything I'm about to say is off my memory, PLEASE cross-reference everything I say because it might not be 100% accurate)

Alcohol stimulates your GABA receptors, and this is what's deadly when you quit. Xanax also stimulates the GABA receptors, that's why Xans have lethal withdrawals and bad synergy with alcohol. 


Back to the Phenibut, this is a nootropic that ALSO stimulates the GABA receptors.. So guess what? You don't have to taper if you get this.. A lot of people have used phenibut to get off alcohol/xanax and the substance itself ISN'T ANYTHING LIKE THOSE TWO SUBSTANCES. It's entirely legal, and it's basically non-recreational."
HumaneCentiPad,fdl42p5,t1_fdl2el9,Ill have to look into that. It sounds interesting. 😯
manicboi_vs_mania,fdl5111,t1_fdl42p5,What's even more interesting is; Phenibut was designed for Russian astronauts. They wanted to make something that could relieve extreme anxiety without messing with the astronauts' cognitive/physical capacity (as Xanax would've done obviously).
ASilverLum,fdm081p,t1_fdl42p5,"I've had the most success with long acting benzos like diazepam (valium) and clonazepam (klonopin). That combined with fresh coconut water is perfect for easing withdrawal. 

And although it's controversial, certain strains of kratom (mainly green) have eased my withdrawals completely. I only use it every second day though because kratom withdrawal can be nasty on its own. If I ever became super dependent on alcohol again, I'd alternate daily between diazepam and kratom."

I wish so much my dad had been willing to do what you are doing right now. I wanted him to be a part of my adult life so much. He would have really liked it. He was in construction, and my husband and I had a construction co doing very technical work for 20 years. He would have really been interested in our lives, but love never called as loudly as the bottle. He ended up in a nursing home, and when my mom visited, the staff thought she was visiting her father. She was only 7 years younger. His older brother, who smoked, outlived him by 14 years. So thanks, friend, for staying around. The world needs you. And if you choose it, maybe you can help other find their way out of the darkness to be there for their loved ones."
abstract_thinker,fdlmc58,t3_ely1r3,"I’m an AOD (Alcohol and Other Drug) clinician from Australia. Please be careful coming off alcohol. 

How long have you been drinking everyday and how much do you consume in a 24 hour period?

Depending on the answer to these questions you may need to be very careful or require a medically assisted detox. You can have a seizure and die from alcohol withdrawal. 

I will do my best to assist you with advice if it will help. 

If you are drinking a significant amount everyday, and have been doing so everyday for more than 3 months PLEASE go and see a doctor so they can prescribe you diazepam so you don’t have a seizure. The most risky period is days 2 - 6 of withdraws."
HumaneCentiPad,fdloiar,t1_fdlmc58,Its been about 3 ish months of getting really drunk every night. Just once a day. Also I'm prescribed clonazepam. Which is another reason I need to cut back the booze. Mixing the two is a fools game that I've been playing for months.
abstract_thinker,fdlstst,t1_fdloiar,"Yes please don’t mix them. The clonazepam should stop you from having seizures associated with alcohol withdrawal, although it would still be best to see a doctor and tell them you’re coming off alcohol. They may change ur dosage for a week or two. I am not a doctor so can’t provide much further info than that in relation to medication. If you can, try and see a doctor. 

And well done for making a positive change in your life. If Alcohol and Other Drug treatment or counselling is available where you live and affordable, try and go to a few sessions it can help immensely to get some strategies to use when you inevitability crave drinking in the future."
trebuchetfight,fdl5zts,t3_ely1r3,"Quitting alcohol was without exaggeration the best change I've ever made.

Although I usually dealt with withdrawal on my own, the only surefire way to deal with risk is medical supervision. So please at least be prepared to get to a doctor or hospital if symptoms get serious.

Helps to realize what's on the other side of withdrawal. When it's over it never has to return. You won't need to keep worrying about getting enough alcohol to stave it off. You can just wake up and do things without structuring your life around withdrawal prevention. It's fucking liberating, and it's closer than you know."
HumaneCentiPad,fdl7k14,t1_fdl5zts,If I start hallucinating or getting delusional I have a ride set up to my local clinic. 👍

ninjara84,fdlj854,t3_ely1r3,"I would say make an AA meeting in your area ASAP. And let people know you are getting off alcohol and they will be able to help you with suggestions, and it’ll be great to be around like minded people that have been sober for a bit of time. And it’ll keep you busy to go to meetings. Also look up info on AA readings, etc online if you can’t make it out. But I def suggest making a meeting over anything else. 

But also stay busy, hydrated, pray (if you are inclined to do so), and if needed get yourself to the ER bc as I’m sure you know, it can be very dangerous to get off alcohol cold turkey. 

best of luck! I admire your courage ❤️ take it One day at a time"
SA_Starling_,fdm2pyu,t3_ely1r3,"Good job on the slow taper! Stopping cold turkey could kill you! You may want to see a doctor, who can help you figure out the rate you need to taper off at and walk you through the process while monitoring your health. 

Drink lots of water. Think about seeing a therapist. Whatever made you drink is still there. Until you face that, you're at risk. There is no shame in seeing a therapist. They're just there to shine a little light into the darkness, and help you sort things from tangled messes into neatly wound and organized areas."
JohnCrichtonsCousin,fdm4wbk,t3_ely1r3,"I've noticed something in my many attempts to quit smoking pot. Whenever a thought of smoking would emerge in my thought space, I would remind myself of the stack of negatives that are why I want to quit. My memory sucks, my relationships suffer, I dont do anything productive and years of my life have been lost to video games. I have lost touch with my family members who used to be my whole world and I'm anxious all the time. Quite the stack I've got. This was motivation, a stark reminder of why I'm quitting. I realized over many failed attempts that this is part of the problem of addiction. The mounting bad history carries with it it's own motivation for smoking. It's another fact I can't handle to conceptualize and so I want to smoke. I found that constantly reminding myself of all that negativity made quitting all the harder. I was just running through sets of deeply negative thoughts to scare myself into sobriety. All it did was tire me of the quitting process and crave a happy moment all the more. I realized then the power of positive thinking. A negative thought releases chemicals that alter your emotional state. Forcing yourself to think of a positive side ensures it's a positive emotional state. Instead of thinking of all that's wrong with smoking I would think of what's right with sobriety. ""You've wasted years on this"" turned to ""I'm excited for a new life"". ""Your lungs and brain are shite now"" to ""It's only up from here"" imagining the feeling of clean lungs and headspace.  By forming a set of positive future outcomes based on sobriety, the craving only stands to destroy your positive plans and concepts, which will trigger a response in your head to re-evaluate the reward your addiction offers and if it's worth losing all the positive outcomes for.

Anyway I hope that makes sense. Form some positive concepts around your continued sobriety and think of them when a craving strikes. Replace the nagging whisper with blaring positivity. Good luck man you can do this.

Anyway I thought I'd add that. Positivity is such a big thing. Your body is designed to feel happy merely by smiling. Allow yourself to be happy. Adopt a persona of forward thinking, of happy planning and an excited demeanor towards the future."

lucyliuflu,fdl19r5,t3_ely1r3,How long after not drinking do you feel symptoms of withdrawal?
HumaneCentiPad,fdl3xc9,t1_fdl19r5,Probably 6 to 8 hours I start to notice it. 24 plus and it gets unpleasant.
Banner80,fdlg09e,t3_ely1r3,"Don't do this on your own, seek help of others (like join the reddit support group). Be compassionate with yourself as you go throw this process. And always remind yourself that life beyond this problem is so much better and worth the effort, even when you can't see it because you are knee deep right now.

Relapses don't matter, obstacles don't matter, as long as you keep getting back up the fight continues. You can be delayed and even set back but it doesn't matter, you can only fail if you stop getting back up. As long as you refuse to give up you are guaranteed victory at the end of the road."
Theyallknowme,fdlgbkk,t3_ely1r3,"I can’t say that I know what you’re going through because I’ve never been much of a drinker but I do want to tell you I’m proud of you.

2020Illusion,fdliovb,t3_ely1r3,"I'm glad you're taking this seriously,  its not the easiest thing to do. I quit drinking so many times,  but couldn't do it on my own. I went to AA, I needed to be in a room of drunks who totally got me. They were able to share their experiences, strength  and hope.  I was able to find how I identified and how to not drink.   It means a lot that you are ready to love yourself enough to heal.  You don't have to do this alone.. stay strong, and don't give up before the miracle!!  I literally had to take it one hour at a time and worked my way up to  one day at a time.  You're totally worth it!!!!👏🤗"

anon82101,fdlo3no,t3_ely1r3,"I want to start by saying how proud of you I am! Decisions like these aren't easy. My dad battled with alcoholism. He tried to stop a couple times before he did. I dont know you or your particular situation, but one of my dads biggest problems faced while trying to overcome was having to give up some friends. He had this group that he would drink and party with and that's all they did. When he decided to quit drinking, they didnt like it and kept talking him into drinking. Eventually he realized that if he wanted to be sober, he was gonna have to stop hanging out with them and that was really hard for him. Another thing that was hard was the cravings to drink. He started drinking Moxie (we live in maine lmao) and that's all he drinks now. He found that it was easier to stop by finding another habit to take its place. It's not necessarily the healthiest and he wants to eventually cut down on the soda too but for now that's what is helping him most. Hes been 3 years without a drink! I wish you the best of luck and I hope you continue to reach out if you're struggling. There are always people put there who are willing to help!"

Each 12 pack costs me $300 in my mind. 

In addition, I just consider myself a non drinker now, in my mind.  Works for smoking too, FWIW."

If you dont stay true to it, youre gonna hurt yourself, and everyone around you. I have watched my struggling father relapse, and you don't want to put the people you care about through that.

purplechicken17,elqv32,top_level,"I took a trip to the Philippines, where my parents are from, and I kept noticing that kids around my mom's neighborhood had shirts with my family name on it. I asked my aunty and she would just say ""I'll tell you later"". 

A couple weeks later (about a week ago), my cousins and I took a trip to the mall and they kept telling me that we had to be back by 5pm and I was really confused because nobody had said anything about that and they didn't have school so I didn't see a reason why we needed to be back, but I listened. 

When we got back to the house, there were a bunch of kids and their families, all wearing new shirt with my family name on it. My relatives were serving them food and giving them sweets that aren't available/ are expensive here.

 I asked my mom and she told me that every month, her and her sisters (there's 6 of them total) set up this gathering in their home neighborhood where they feed the children and give them sweets. It was their way of giving back to where they're from. 

It brought a smile to my face knowing that my family was so giving and tried to help all these kids and families. My mom told me that me and my cousins that live in America should continue this after they all pass, and of course I will.

What I'm trying to say is, if you're able to help out those who are less fortunate than you, you should. Whether it's something small like a donation to a charity, or something bigger."

LordsOfJoop,em2s6v,top_level,"After much thought and deliberation, I decided to take on a full-time employee in my workshop. This is a radical departure from my previous standard of living and working, concerning myself with just the minimum of overhead and workplace conditions.


A very good friend of mine introduced me to their former colleague, and we hit it off immediately. They're risk-aware about working with power tools and equipment, have a strong working ethic and is also keen on the idea of not opening the shop for friends, relatives or strangers not formally introduced to the shop's protocols.


They were upfront and honest regarding their history regarding their tenure in prison, showing that they learned from the experience and want to make a full-on run at being a better person.


As a trial run, we shared a workspace at a friend's metal fabrication shop, constructing a new storage locker suite, finishing the job in a little over seven hours, not counting the hour and a half lunch break. The new lockers will serve as a storage space for their tools and projects/materials, and I have decided to allow them to make use of the workshop on their day off, so long as it is kept clean and they are paying for the supplies they are using, if it exceeds what they have stored up for it.


They're not a fan of my type of music, I am tolerant of theirs, so it's not a perfect fit, just good enough for me. Today we finished a backlog of projects in eight hours, meaning that I can upgrade our projects to both a bigger scale and likely increase the sales frequency to once a week instead of twice a month.


We plan to go get tattooed at the end of the month, and I plan to surprise them by paying for their ink, leaving them on the hook for the tip alone. I'm optimistic about new opportunities in the near future and will be as supportive as they are productive. I think that's about as fair as I should be, as a boss and co-worker.


It's my second time working with a single mom, which is a good thing; being aware of the situation and possible issues is as much of a heads-up as I am likely to need. 


Tomorrow, she'll be surprised with her own copy of the shop keys, a padlock for her new locker and the codes for the alarm. I have full faith in what happens next.

Update 1: handed her the keys just after we got back from lunch. She seems to be happy with this and I am likewise am pleased. 

Update 2: I've relaxed some of the strictures on shop visitation, allowing her to have her daughter drop in, provided that she calls in advance and not visit unless her mom is working that day. 

Update 3: scheduled an appointment with her P.O., a thing that she is aware of and will not be present for part of the visit. 

Update 4: we're holding off on the expansion to the north, choosing to close up for the months of June and July, if we meet or exceed the target profit margin. I kind of got a bit ahead of myself on that one. 

Update 5: tattoo appointment made, she sussed out that I planned to pay for it. So much for my poker face. She's agreed to listen to my music as what she considers a fair exchange. Not quite made a convert, still optimistic!

Thank you all for your conversation, support and encouragement. I think the best of her, her work and her goals. She thinks of me as the bearded weirdo and this is okay with me."

I always wondered what was so great about running. Seeing his face in agony when he runs always made me wonder why he does this to himself. Fast forward 10 years later, I haven't seen him around my neighborhood in ages and I thought he passed away. But yesterday, I decided to start running as well because I'm out of shape. I started a brisk jog around my neighborhood when I saw him again, huffing and puffing. I couldn't believe my eyes. He was still alive and still running.

I don't really know this kid very well but my sons are both asleep and my husband is conked out and I just can't bear to leave this kid watching tv and reading while he hopes to maybe eventually fall asleep.  So I am watching my iPad while he kicks back in our bonus room.  


I kinda wish I had sent him home earlier in the night so he could be comfortable but I also feel that all that does is punish the kids for a simple mistake.  Also, I want to show his parents that I'm easy-going and also that I care about their kid and that they don't have to worry when he is in my care.

Claxtonite,fe1l7jq,t3_enltr9,You're a beautifully compassionate soul.
bobbomballama,fe1ja0t,t3_enltr9,You are cool as hell for that. Nowadays letting your child stay at a friend's house in extremely nerve wracking. More parents like you please! 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Guttermouth11111,fe3u3l0,t1_fe1ja0t,And that's the thing.  I don't want his parents to think I just let their child lay in bed in the dark for 8 hours (which he would have because he did not end up going to sleep) and just did my own thing while he suffered quietly
bobbomballama,fe3wxsi,t1_fe3u3l0,Yeah that's sweet. Adhd meds ain't no joke either.
Guttermouth11111,fe3zacc,t1_fe3wxsi,"No it was a bit of a scramble when I saw his weekly pill container was empty.  ""Did it have a pill in it for today? Did he take it already? Had he already taken it today? Did it fall on the floor? Did one of the other kids open it and drop it or maybe they ate it? Did the dog eat it? Did the container open in his bag? What do I say to his mom?"""
bobbomballama,fe441t3,t1_fe3zacc,Yeah and parents can over react to things like that. All parents make mistakes and we tend to be over protective when it comes to our own kids. Do you know the parent well?
Guttermouth11111,fe67zov,t1_fe441t3,"I don't really know them well.  They are easier going, I know that, but how they are when it comes to medicating their kids and their behavioral things is a whole ass thing I didn't know how they react to"
_mr_kippers_,fe19z5m,t3_enltr9,Ritalin is an amphetamine so it's no surprise he's wide awake.
Guttermouth11111,fe1byj1,t1_fe19z5m,"Yeah the poor guy.  He seemed a bit confused why this was happening to him so I had to delicately let him know that his little ""whoops"" was gunna make for an interesting night"
_mr_kippers_,fe1ey3i,t1_fe1byj1,"I work with children, some of whom have ADHD. My experience when their medication wears of is they become more hyperactive before they crash. So don't be surprised if you get an hour of him being hyper before he sleeps. Giving him something to concentrate on could avoid things escalating. Good luck."
Guttermouth11111,fe3ueig,t1_fe1ey3i,That was good to know.  The poor dude did not end up falling asleep but he got to binge watch some Minecraft and wake everyone up as soon as it was an appropriate hour
craftish,fe6eynn,t1_fe1ey3i,Gotta fight the drowsy!
ABritishRedditor,fe1qk19,t3_enltr9,"Probably not related, but I have a nephew like this. His mum (my sister) is trying to wean him and the youngest daughter onto a sleeping schedule, since before they all used to stay up all hours of the night on their iPads, and when I went over to do an overnight babysit the other weekend she told me to not let him on electronics until past 6am, but he shouldnt be awake by then right; his medicine will make him sleep through the night?

Nope. He was up at about 5am, on his iPad. I took it off him, he hated it, wanted it back. Eventually had to sit with him until 6am in the mum’s room, trying to make him go back to sleep. 

In hindsight, probably should have just given him the iPad. But, rules are rules."
Guttermouth11111,fe3trn6,t1_fe1qk19,Awww that sucks you have to be the enforcer while they went through a huge regime change.  Nothing like watching kids go through withdrawal from their tablet
wxstcoast,fe36dsw,t3_enltr9,"Not a parent myself, but I like to think I can recognize a really good one when I see em. You are a fantastic mom or dad."
xxskinnypen,fe19o05,t3_enltr9,New episode of the good place?
Guttermouth11111,fe19v75,t1_fe19o05,I did watch the latest episode.  It's getting a scootch boring while they wrap things up
guytx74,fe19f5f,t3_enltr9,Ahhhh. You’re a sweet mom.
fundrazor,fe5i0ku,t3_enltr9,"How do you find kids at that age? My wife and I are talking about kids, alot of our friends have kids, but younger, alot of ""terrible twos and threes"". does parenting ever get more mellow?"
craftish,fe6eu4l,t3_enltr9,I love that show. I actually started watching it one night because I was having a terrible bout of insomnia.
Guttermouth11111,fe6jgcq,t1_fe6eu4l,It's pretty funny and has an interesting premise
craftish,fe6msd4,t1_fe6jgcq,"It's so off-the-wall and then it isn't. It's all dichotomy, the good and the bad, important and trivial.

It's clever because it takes simple concepts and makes them weird, while gently teaching empathy and love.

Kind of a bit of fresh air as far as shows go."
