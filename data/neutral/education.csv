Hillside_Wildflowers,fdkczso,t3_elt6ut,"Apparently they don't tie teacher performance and raises to standardized test scores in Vermont, and the average teacher to student ratio is less than 1:10, even in Burlington city highschools. The result is one of the best ranked states for education. I kinda really want to teach in Vermont"
husky429,fdkk50s,t1_fdkczso,"FYI-- There is only 1 high school in burlington. It's a tiny ""city"". And the biggest reason for the 1:10 ratio is the huge amount of refugees in the public schools. ELs and adult students (students of any age can stay in public schools on VT) have a big impact on budget.

Teacher pay also kind of sucks."
Hillside_Wildflowers,fdknjrx,t1_fdkk50s,"Yeah, I've been doing a lot of research on it since my fiancee is thinking about going to grad school there. The pay is actually about the same up there as it is here, with a similar COL. There are other highschools in the area too, in Essex, winooski, colchester, south Burlington, etc. iirc. I had heard vaguely about a lot of refugee students being there, but I hadn't come across many specifics yet. If you've had a experience there, what's it like to teach? My school has a high ESOL and ESE population so I've got experience with that, but they're mostly from the Caribbean so it's a different demographic."
Jabbey15,fdk6fwl,t3_elt6ut,"Investing in public education is a good idea. However the ultimate goal of standardized testing is ultimately flawed.

The concept that all students from all backgrounds should achieve the same test scores simply does not match reality. You are left with either teaching specifically to a test to try an artificially increase the metric or simply dumbing down the metric so more people reach the testing benchmark goal.

We are all different and we all have strengths and weaknesses. Data and common sense have taught us this. The goal of equalizing outcomes and conflating this with equal opportunity is just not tenable or even rationale.

My two cents"
RoxaniG,fdkcj8u,t3_elt6ut,"I agree with many things here. However, I don't think that tests per se are evil. ""Teaching to the test is bad"" does not necessarily equates to ""scrap the test"". I don't see why testing is fundamentally contradictory to the later part of this piece. Why do you need to remove testing to increase teacher salaries? Or improve funding of title I schools?

Some kind of evaluation of student progress and achievement is important. What are the better alternatives?"
Death2Milk,fdkg783,t1_fdkcj8u,"Tests are “evil” when they attach pressure to meet end of the year standards in December. You, as a teacher, are heavily pressured to have students make growth. But how much growth can I get out of a student that is passing grade level content? We are often told to “stay in our lane” when it comes to teaching the standards. Teach to the grade level, not above and, definitely, not below. I will get a negative impacted on the student growth portion of my evaluation if I don’t get those kids to demonstrate growth. I currently have five kids that work at that level. I pushed hard to get one moved to the grade above. It’s not an easy thing to do and rarely it is done. 

Overall, how standardized testing is used is stupid and unfair to the student and teacher."
DazzlerPlus,fdkusdh,t1_fdkcj8u,"It’s the stakes that are bad, not the test itself."
queenlitotes,fdmxuzz,t1_fdkcj8u,Those exams are wicked expensive.
Jchang0114,fdkpfu1,t1_fdkg783,"In California, we had a high school exit exam where 12th graders could not pass 8th grade material. The issue I have with no testing is that it allows grade inflation or even the teacher just passing a unqualified student. 

We can see the effects on post-secondary education where new students do not have the ability to pass lower division courses."
RoxaniG,fdknjee,t1_fdkg783,"You object on how the tests are used to evaluate teachers and I don't disagree with you. However the answer to these concerns is to change how the tests are used to evaluate teachers. It's not ""abolish all and any evaluation without proposing any alternatives"". I admittedly skipped the article, but I didn't see what exactly it is that Bernie proposes."
RoxaniG,fdnv48x,t1_fdmxuzz,Good point.
DazzlerPlus,fdlafrt,t1_fdkpfu1,Grade inflation can be controlled with a ~5% random sample being tested with no stakes. As opposed to paying billions to test the whole population multiple times
HildaMarin,fdkyjah,t1_fdknjee,"> I didn't see what exactly it is that Bernie proposes.

The article briefly summarizes some points of his plan. More about it is on his campaign site here:

https://berniesanders.com/en/issues/reinvest-in-public-education/

Dozens of different proposals there. One is raise minimum starting salary of all teachers to $60,000. Another is that since minority families are high users of charter schools when availableo in order to escape failing public schools, that charter schools should be reigned in since it ""increases segregation"" to allow black families a choice."
RoxaniG,fdl606c,t1_fdkyjah,"Thanks, yeah, I'm all in favor of increasing teacher salaries and I don't see this or many other ideas as related to testing. 

What I was trying to say is: is he proposing to abolish all testing? without replacing it with some other form of evaluation? or reduce the stakes? How? He says ""high-stakes testing is bad"" - sure, what is his proposal to improve it?"
HildaMarin,fdlpw62,t1_fdl606c,"> He says ""high-stakes testing is bad"" - sure, what is his proposal to improve it?

It's not completely clear. His campaign site says little. His op ed brings it up three times:

> My Thurgood Marshall Plan for Public Education addresses these fundamental problems by *increasing teacher pay to start at $60,000 a year, empowering teachers to craft thoughtful assessments that consider all aspects of a student’s academic progress.*

>  In some cities, teachers have refused to administer tests that do not improve learning, and increasing numbers of parents and students are opting out of standardized tests and demanding *more effective ways of assessing* student performance. 

>  Even the best *educational assessments are of limited use if* schools are underfunded, our teachers are disrespected, and millions of students and their families are living paycheck to paycheck.

It seems he's saying if we pay teachers more, testing will be better, and that's the plan.

He and his wife massively increased spending at Burlington College, spending on all sorts of things."
bukofa,fdlw71a,t3_elt6ut,Does it mention how it will be funded? I saw the $60000 number and in my area that would pretty much bankrupt every district.
nikatnight,fdma4iw,t1_fdlw71a,The richer areas of the world must always fund the poorer ones.
