JennyBagaDonuts,elzw8w,top_level,
Martian_Pudding,fdllcov,t3_elzw8w,In just like a split second in my brain it goes from 'this looks crappy' to 'this is a printed out photo'. Really trippy to loom at.
bear__attack,fdlwn8m,t1_fdllcov,These color choices take actual COURAGE. Like I guess a crappy yellow balloon drawing is fine. But then you gone put GREEN on it?! And GRAY. You better be fucking confident about exactly what those colors are going to do and how they're going to bleed and blend and dry... Major props.
RabidWench,fdmnj17,t1_fdllcov,That's because she skips a few frames in the video. It bugs me mildly in r/restofthefuckingowl fashion. Gorgeous drawing though.
anniewhovian,fdmo809,t1_fdlwn8m,"That‚Äôs actually an artist ‚Äútrick‚Äù, if you want something to look actually gold you highlight with a green color. I‚Äôm still a beginning (and self taught) artist myself so don‚Äôt totally take my word for it, but I‚Äôve heard it from a few different artists i watch on YouTube, and as you can see it‚Äôs done here! It‚Äôs a super interesting technique that I really probably should look more into üòÖ"
Nevermoremonkey,fdnyvb7,t1_fdmnj17,My immediate reaction too!
bear__attack,fdn2er1,t1_fdm0kj2,Perfect.
bear__attack,fdn2ecl,t1_fdmo809,"I was actually a painting major for a hot second and took color theory classes, so I kind of get it but it amazes me!"
dunielle,fdlf4wr,t3_elzw8w,Witchcraft!
Kms5549,fdluywv,t1_fdlf4wr,and wizardry
flower_milk,fdmchzw,t1_fdlf4wr,Those aren't pens she's using those are straight up wands holy shit
tonkerss,fdljl4o,t3_elzw8w,This is honest to god sorcery to me. How do you even know how to do this? Do you just KNOW?
wnnaone,fdlmiom,t3_elzw8w,ive watched the video over and over and i still don‚Äôt understand how.
JennyBagaDonuts,fdlmlrw,t1_fdlmiom,I think it has to do with how the markers bleed after the original mark.
BenignEgoist,fdnrj3e,t1_fdlmlrw,Roughly blocks in colors with markers. Goes over dried markers with colored pencils for details. The colored pencil part goes by really quick in the video so it‚Äôs kinda imperceptible if you don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing. But look at the first ‚Äú2‚Äù that‚Äôs already drawn. It‚Äôs got more complexity because it was already touched up with the colored pencils. They don‚Äôt touch the other three until all have been roughly blocked in and there‚Äôs a difference between how detailed they look versus that first ‚Äú2.‚Äù
thekraken27,fdll4f7,t3_elzw8w,"What‚Äôs really weird is how photorealistic this looked until I watched them use basic techniques for the last 3 numbers and suddenly it didn‚Äôt look *as* good, but damn that‚Äôs so cool. Finally a good reason to use a yellow marker"
BrownWhiskey,fdlstxz,t1_fdll4f7,I still thought the first was the best at the end though.
Meow-nificent,fdme0t7,t1_fdll4f7,"Dude, same!! It blew my mind lol"
sharkbelly,fdlrjph,t3_elzw8w,That is crazy! I thought this was /r/restofthefuckingowl material until I realized there wasn't a huge jump in the editing.
AMA_Dr_Wise_Money,fdltp2s,t1_fdlrjph,Also there's a full video on YouTube. Spoiler alert I still don't get it though :(
RabidWench,fdmnkxz,t1_fdlrjph,"It's not a huge jump, but there definitely missed frames, if you watch her hand."
d-limonene,fdltwz7,t3_elzw8w,"With Crayola markers.. really great confirmation that it's in the skill, not the tool (though nice tools are nice when you can get them)"
memoe-,fdm97bz,t1_fdltwz7,Crayola are the good ones though... They need to try it with RoseArt next
NiceGuyJoe,fdmqjte,t1_fdm97bz,Fuck RoseArt
d-limonene,fdmu4ch,t1_fdm97bz,"Haha those ones have a rather chunky, child proof felt tip by the looks of it (to stop kids flattening them) so I figured those were designed for a child‚Äôs intentions rather than a highly skilled artist. But this lady proved as all wrong. That said there‚Äôs already plenty of gorgeous art done with a lead pencil or bic pens on napkins"
Space_Cranberry,fdlpsbr,t3_elzw8w,I‚Äôm mad I can‚Äôt color that well.
JennyBagaDonuts,fdlpvun,t1_fdlpsbr,Same.

h1b1k1n0,fdm347u,t3_elzw8w,That is some solid color theory.
viva_orange,fdmb8mn,t3_elzw8w,"Ok I had to un-upvote this just to re-upvote it. I started watching thinking ‚Äúnah, this is some bullshit prank. There‚Äôs no way that.....‚Äù and then went just speechless. Damn. Bravo."

nature_remains,fdmmq36,t3_elzw8w,How does someone‚Äôs brain pick up these colors?? It‚Äôs incredible as I consider myself more artistically minded than most. And yet I can‚Äôt get my brain to break down what it sees as shiny gold into the apparent constituent colors.

theredfearnthrows,fe8pu18,t3_eo2l8y,"Awesome! 

Pro Tip: on your last copy, use a yellow highlighter to write ""original,"" the yellow highlighter will not photocopy so you won't accidentally use your last blank copy.

 Alternately, you can scan it in and save a pdf digitally, but that highlighter trick is good to know. 

Source: elementary teacher with lots of non-digital resources."
BeAGoodPersonPls,fe8t0iv,t1_fe8pu18,That's really smart - thankyou! üòÅ x
SilverpeltDoe,fe9d3jg,t1_fe8pu18,Oh that's great to know
psK1K,fec9he9,t1_fe8pu18,"Be careful: I used to do this at a medical office. Most of the time it worked flawlessly. However, if someone was messing around with the contrast options, or rarely after a fresh toner change, sometimes the ""original"" or anything in yellow highlighter would still show up. It may depend on type of highlighter, type of copier, etc.

As always, test it before committing to it 100%.
However, when it works, it's awesome!"
fastTrainBrickWall,fe7idl1,t3_eo2l8y,"Omg I love this. 
This would work perfectly as a digital setup too"

horsk9234,fec27zp,t1_fe8hk31,If you dont care about saving it and have a laminater you could also just make it a dry erase sheet.

erineegads,fe8iov2,t3_eo2l8y,"So you just keep it at your desktop, and replace it every week? I love this!"
BeAGoodPersonPls,fe8j32q,t1_fe8iov2,Exactly! Which works better for me because I can't close it like I can with a notepad. That's how I end up skipping weeks at a time of my diaries and notepads when I was younger. üòÖ I'm in dire need of the organisation right now though x

jwstevens22,febhhnh,t1_febeqqa,Use wet erase! Like Vis-a-Vis the old school projector markers. Lol

adreamtomeat,fds8wxk,t3_empgqr,So what do you do with this page? I‚Äôm trying to wrap my head round the point of these spreads. Surely it‚Äôs too tiny to write things on?
serenwipiti,fdst0db,t1_fds8wxk,"If you want to plan long term goals during the year, it serves as a reference that you can look back on when planning things during the present. 

Example: 

""*I think I want to go on a trip in Sept. 2020, right now it's January, I wonder how many weeks I have to save money until  Sept. 20,2020...and what day of the week does it fall on...hmmm let me check my year at a glance spread...""*

""*Hmm, it's Bob's birthday soon, I wonder if it's on a Wednesday or on a Thursday this year, let me check...""*"
Bananatrumpets,fdta20p,t1_fds8wxk,"I honestly just use it as a reference, when I'm planning later it's easier for me to use a page in the book than to look at the calendar on my phone."
Bananatrumpets,fdta47h,t1_fdst0db,This too!
frakramsey,fdqk2dd,t3_empgqr,The deviation from the pattern is sending me nuts Haha. Looks lovely tho
Bananatrumpets,fdqlpdo,t1_fdqk2dd,The thing was I was using a pink pen instead of orange but I accidentally put the orange for October thinking it was yellow and had to fix it by making the pink orange instead :+( it bothered me a lot too ahah
BelleMacchiato,fdq4fyu,t3_empgqr,It's simple but really pretty ü§ó way to go!

kitkat714,fdraxrr,t3_empgqr,What was the black pen that you used !? Looks super cute I might have to use a similar lay out that is looks so good :)
Bananatrumpets,fdrc89a,t1_fdraxrr,"The one I used to write the numbers is a black staedtler triplus fineliner, an artline of 0.5 also works pretty well though (or any with a fine tip).

notin10000years,fdjvgkn,t1_fdjuljt,Thank you! I‚Äôm guessing it took me around 10 or more hours. If you‚Äôre in the right mood it can be quite a relaxing technique
zonerf1,fdjz1bw,t1_fdjvgkn,What's the technique called?
notin10000years,fdjz4vf,t1_fdjz1bw,Stippling
Edhie421,fdl4sp7,t1_fdjz4vf,It's gorgeous!
notin10000years,fdk065f,t3_elqtit,"For context, I use it for making notes in Japanese. Although my note taking pages look very boring, I‚Äôd like to come up with a nice layout for those too"

Wow, nice job!!"
notin10000years,fdlgnp5,t1_fdka7rs,Thank you so much
1001tealeaves,fdl37ph,t3_elqtit,"Looks great! Until I saw this I didn‚Äôt even think about the fact that 2020 now means that we‚Äôre in the second year of Reiwa already. I was there this summer and literally everything was ‰ª§ÂíåÂÖÉÂπ¥ since it was all new and fresh so it just didn‚Äôt register with my brain that it wouldn‚Äôt last a full year. Even weirder now that I realize Heisei 31 only lasted four months.

Do you have any specific spreads or trackers you‚Äôve found helpful for Japanese study?"
notin10000years,fdlg917,t1_fdl37ph,"I don‚Äôt have any fancy trackers but when I was studying for JLPT I did use one. I basically had a column/ row for each aspect of the language: reading comprehension, listening, grammar, vocabulary. Every day I would fill in whether I studied that section or not. It really helped me visualise how much I was neglecting certain skills like listening compared to others"

wellwhatnot,fe4s330,t3_ent5e6,Pretty. Are the scarab and triangle symbolic or just cool?
Filinchen22,fe4uwh4,t1_fe4s330,"Haha, just cool! It‚Äòs a stag beetle and i‚Äôm not sure if it has any symbolic meaning, to be honest."
Josquin_TheMan,fe66rr9,t1_fe4uwh4,It makes me thing of metamorphosis by Kafka. You could create some meaning out of that if you really wanted too haha. Love it!
chailattebabe,fe6cf11,t3_ent5e6,Reminds me of Saosin‚Äôs album art

BenitaABQ,feaxkjl,t3_ent5e6,Beautifully done! We have those here and they are enormous.
writerlionel,febvgzy,t3_ent5e6,pretty cool! weren't scarabs favored by the Egyptians as symbols of Resurrection/eternal life? Could be mistaken though.

Miyutzi,elaond,top_level,
ShredderWest,fdgr4lz,t3_elaond,So glad I'm not the only one who puts sex on my period tracker too lol
Miyutzi,fdgr75e,t1_fdgr4lz,Of course! It's not an irrelevant factor at all.
frogsgoribbit737,fdh1kes,t1_fdgr4lz,"I do, but I also was trying to get pregnant. I might continue to do it anyways just because it's a habit now and I've noticed sex sometimes affects other things in my cycle"
sexy_bellsprout,fdi0nnk,t1_fdgr4lz,"Out of interest, how does sex affect your cycle? I‚Äôve never bothered to track any of this (mostly because my contraception means I rarely have periods)"
Kairee_,fdh9w3l,t1_fdgr4lz,I do this too:)
thinfritatas,fdhibth,t1_fdgr4lz,Added it To mine too for this year!
OMAD238,fdhwmx5,t1_fdgr4lz,Me too!
duckyrabbitbear,fdi7b5i,t1_fdi0nnk,I wish I had your periods. I usually get 7-9 days of heavy periods. I tend to get horrible cramps during my period. Sex helps lessen my cramping.
sexy_bellsprout,fdi8dwv,t1_fdi7b5i,"Ooh good to know! I had horrible, painful periods for years, then when I was 19 a friend who was a sexual health nurse recommended the depo provera jabs - I‚Äôve been one of the luckily ones and after a year or two on that I stopped having periods! Bar a bit of spotting of course"
presley420,fdgogmv,t3_elaond,i think this is so cute and thts a perfectly normal amount of sex lol
Miyutzi,fdgot8n,t1_fdgogmv,"Thank you a lot for your courage to speak up against this ridiculous storm of shame! (Honestly, thank you, I appreciate it)"
AlexandreZani,fdh3wnf,t1_fdgogmv,"I'm really glad the ""too much sex"" comment got downvoted into oblivion."
eveningtrain,fdi5wyv,t1_fdgogmv,Yes! It looks really nice. And pretty much any amount of sex is a normal amount of sex (unless the amount if so high you have no other time for the things you want/need to do?)
TiredSweetPotato,fdgrz66,t1_fdgot8n,I think people are just jealous :p
Kiyu_namealrdytaken,fdhjn02,t1_fdgot8n,Honestly? Shame? I was impressed tbf üòÇüòÇüòÇ
frogsgoribbit737,fdh1nuj,t1_fdgot8n,"I want to add that as long as you like the amount you have sex, it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks! We all have our own normal and this is just yours. Enjoy it!"
coffeecoffeetoffee,fdhhxgl,t1_fdgot8n,i would love to have this much sex tbh üíï
ancientflowers,fdho8h8,t1_fdgot8n,"People have shamed you for having sex?! 

Edit: I suppose I really shouldn't be surprised. This is Reddit."
cleopout,fdi1at9,t1_fdgot8n,I am jealous of the amount of sex tbh
GodOfTheThunder,fdhsjgy,t1_fdgot8n,"Whatever the amount is, is the right amount, so people should definitely not comment about it... Jesus!

Also, do you share this with your partner? I know I put an app on my phones for my partner just so I could be aware and more supportive when her period was coming, but I didnt know if that was weird for a guy to do?"
presley420,fdgxa61,t1_fdgrz66,"haha right? like why are women shamed for having sex for 1. thats not even what the post is about 2. its fantastic, normal, and healthy to have a sex life"
oliviablunt,fdh1kju,t1_fdgrz66,Can confirm am jealous but it‚Äôs wonderful you have a healthy sex life!! Not many people can say that. Cute tracker üòä
snacksarelife,fdhnfm9,t1_fdhhxgl,My thoughts exactly! I wish my bf was down with this amount hahahaha. Respect.
Tay74,fdi9bdb,t1_fdho8h8,"I mean....outside of reddit too....like, I get what you're saying, but this also very much happens outside of reddit"
Miyutzi,fdht5g1,t1_fdhsjgy,"Of course, we're talking about everything with each other, especially important things like that. I mean, I consider it a health-subject and I would be so disappointed if I wasn't allowed to let him know about my conditions."
AlexandreZani,fdh40o3,t1_fdgxa61,"Also, as Pete Davidson says, slut shaming is stupid. If you're a het guy and keep shaming women for having sex, they'll stop having sex. What kind of a dumb move is that?"
Nougattabekidding,fdh52pn,t1_fdgxa61,"Just wanna say, I totally agree with you but I also want to add that there‚Äôs no shame in not having as much sex as this, or more sex than this! We‚Äôre all individuals with different levels of sex drive and it‚Äôs important to remember that comparison is the thief of joy."
GodOfTheThunder,fdhu0w9,t1_fdht5g1,That is really cool.
akuma_sakura,fdhfrp4,t1_fdh52pn,"This is so important, thank you for noting it. As a woman with a very low sex drive, I get quite some shit about it often equally as much as my more-sex-having friends. Why bother about how often random people have sex tho.. it's not that interesting xD"
Miyutzi,fdh8m7h,t3_elaond,"The first two comments were so offensive and sex-negative that I got really insecure, but now I love how this thread turned out to be. Thank you, guys!"
pottymouthgrl,fdhm4cd,t1_fdh8m7h,Any time you get negative comments about sex (especially on subs of mostly women) you‚Äôll likely get a massive flood of positive comments. It‚Äôs the reddit defense coming through haha
GossamerLens,fdhmyc1,t1_fdh8m7h,Unfortunately there are really negative men online. Unless you are having sex with them it is wrong. At least one of those first two comments was from someone who actually posts on incel type groups. Luckily you have a lot of reasonable and supportive people on this sub!
athenanon,fdi74ag,t1_fdh8m7h,They were just jealous. Source? Me being jealous and extrapolating.
_highwaytoana,fdgoko6,t3_elaond,"I have seen plenty period trackers online but I like yours a lot because I understand it better. This may sound a bit dumb but I've seen plenty period trackers in which people track how long do they bleed and when they're ovulating (and I never know when I am ovulating). And my period is very irregular, so my symptoms really change from one time to another (and because of it being irregular, I've had more than one scare weeks after sex, so that part of your tracker is very useful too). All I've been doing until now is adding a red dot on my calendar when I start bleeding, but I may add something like this to my bujo too, thx for sharing :)"
real_bella_goth,fdgzdx9,t1_fdgoko6,"I use an app called Clue to track my period. It's very usefull, cuz it predicts your next period and ovulation window"
Miyutzi,fdgp1ks,t1_fdgoko6,"Thank you! I really don't know why people don't get that intercourse has an impact on your cycle, in one way or another. Also I appreciate the appreciation! üòä"
dory42wallabyway,fdh6u0n,t1_fdgoko6,Have you seen the app Clue? I‚Äôve been using it for years. It tells you when your fertile window is.
VelvetandElectricity,fdgr8si,t1_fdgoko6,I keep a tracker but next to it a page with dates and a one line note about my symptoms.
lannaaax3,fdhzgu8,t1_fdgoko6,"I have used Clue, Glow, and Ovia. All really great apps (I‚Äôm just super picky and like to bounce around) and all will show ovulation tracking as well!"
T-blane,fdh2rqj,t1_fdgzdx9,"I love Clue! Been tracking with it for years and you can track all sorts of things like sex, mood, discharge, etc."
hmmmmmhmmmmhmmmmmm,fdhujaq,t1_fdgzdx9,yess it's the best! I got a notification to say my period was about to start today and I immediately went to the toilet and it had literally just started - I don't know what I'd do without it ! (Probably have to replace my sheets and underwear a lot more lol)
_highwaytoana,fdh4ip4,t1_fdgzdx9,Oh thanks! I know some apps that works similarly but I've never used them because I thought that I wouldn't find them so useful because of my very irregular period. I may give it a try tho :)
cm0011,fdi6pkg,t1_fdgzdx9,+1 for Clue!
_highwaytoana,fdgt0rw,t1_fdgp1ks,"I thought the same! I understand that it's still a taboo (I personally am still a bit embarrassed to talk about some things that are sex related in some contexts), but I also think it's important to talk more often about it because it's a health thing anyway"
squishymonkey,fdhashs,t1_fdgp1ks,"Honestly I never thought about about it too much, considering I‚Äôm on bc and not worried about pregnancy. But I‚Äôve been having a lot of libido issues since starting anti depressants, and I started taking Wellbutrin which has kind of shot my libido back up (yay!) and I think I should start tracking my sex as well as my period! I could use that ego boost to remind myself that I‚Äôm doing better. Thanks so much for this idea!"
hmmmmmhmmmmhmmmmmm,fdhuro7,t1_fdgp1ks,I've found that it definitely does have an impact but I've never really heard people talk about it before !
_highwaytoana,fdharc1,t1_fdh6u0n,"It was just recommended to me about half an hour ago! I know some similar apps but I haven't try any of them because I thought it wouldn't be so useful for me because of my very irregular periods, but I may try it then! Thank you :)"
dory42wallabyway,fdhb1nb,t1_fdharc1,It‚Äôs super helpful to me because I‚Äôm in peri menopause so mine are just getting irregular.
frecklesandmimosas,fdgppsu,t3_elaond,Wow I am jealous! I had sex about 12 times last year. Total.
TiredSweetPotato,fdgr5xt,t1_fdgppsu,"Jealous here too, my libido has been dead over the past three years, I'd love to enjoy sex again.

OP, love the tracker, easy to understand at a glance, might steal the idea!"
effywap,fdgxpwg,t1_fdgppsu,Don‚Äôt feel bad I had sex zero times
milkdreams,fdh404u,t1_fdgppsu,Same. Fucking antidepressants lmao
chronicallyillsyl,fdhq86p,t1_fdgppsu,"Still 12 more times than me.

Edit: to clarify, not shaming OP, I'm jealous."
G47_51,fdh0rhq,t1_fdgppsu,Same. I am so jealous. Maybe if I make a chart I‚Äôll get more action!
allonsy_badwolf,fdi0u5z,t1_fdgppsu,"Same. Between actual illnesses, surgeries, depression, and a few cut cycles for the fianc√© it‚Äôs been rough."
Miyutzi,fdgro1h,t1_fdgr5xt,Thank you! üòä
amarinda,fdhb2ue,t1_fdgr5xt,"If you are on hormonal birth control, look into other options. My libido was non existent for over 10 years. I thought I had a low sex drive. Then I went off BC to get pregnant and discovered I do love to have sex and do have a libido when it‚Äôs not suppressed by hormones. My body reacts very strongly. I have a copper IUB now and I love it."
jonesthejovial,fdh4v8w,t1_fdh404u,Honestly that's why I haven't taken any in like four years. It's been..... Fine?
TiredSweetPotato,fdhfyii,t1_fdhb2ue,No birth control :(
DrPhilYourHoles,fdha0gh,t1_fdh4v8w,"Me too! My lows are extremely low, but I still have my highs without the SSRI"
lannaaax3,fdhzbzw,t1_fdhfyii,"I‚Äôm no doctor but certain mood drugs (antidepressants and what not) can also affect libido. 

Definitely tanked mine for a hot minute!"
Obi-WanKenOC,fdhlz05,t1_fdhfyii,Have you had your thyroid checked?
TiredSweetPotato,fdi1xor,t1_fdhzbzw,"Damn, that sucks! I started with just Wellbutrin which isn't supposed to tank libido like other antidepressants do but who knows!"
TiredSweetPotato,fdhw8nl,t1_fdhlz05,"Yeah, it's good. All my blood tests are good."
lannaaax3,fdi3rwb,t1_fdi1xor,"Like I said, I‚Äôm not a doctor so I don‚Äôt really know in depth which ones will affect what. I was on lexapro and noticed a decrease for sure. 

Worth talking to your doctor about if it‚Äôs something you‚Äôre bothered by"
theknowledgebean,fdgwrcj,t3_elaond,"To the ones commenting about too much sex, I‚Äôd have sex every day or twice per day if I could. And I‚Äôm female. No shame here! Having sex as a consenting adult is normal, natural, and your choice. Don‚Äôt ever let anyone make you feel the amount of sex you have or don‚Äôt have is shameful."
mysticbuttkrak,fdhgvmu,t1_fdgwrcj,If I drop below 3 times a week I get so irritable and pissy. Everyone has their own appetites!
thinfritatas,fdhil66,t1_fdgwrcj,Damn you're lucky
Kinsmen12,fdhq1hu,t1_fdgwrcj,I DO have sex every day and it‚Äôs still not enough. Those bitching about ‚Äútoo much sex‚Äù need to get laid.
AnythingBlue,fdhl611,t1_fdhj7tq,Why would they post it if they werent okay with it. And to say its humblebragging is silly. This is just someone sharing their tracker.
dyspnea,fdgset6,t3_elaond,Great tracking.  You have the ideal strategy if you ever decide to do fertility tracking for promoting or limiting conception.  I tracked my fertility signs and temps pre-bujo and would have loved this as a template.
Miyutzi,fdgslol,t1_fdgset6,Thank you very much! üòä
spermbankssavelives,fdgx44y,t3_elaond,"I‚Äôm super confused as to why people think this is a lot of sex, it‚Äôs about every 3 days... which is a perfectly normal amount. Anyways, I love the tracker and I think I‚Äôm going to start something like it!"
Miyutzi,fdgxbqv,t1_fdgx44y,Thank you! üòä
Grattelisa,fdgp2n5,t3_elaond,"Sorry, what does pille and stimmung mean?
It's a really nice layout!"
Miyutzi,fdgp88g,t1_fdgp2n5,"Thank you! üòä And ""Pille"" = the pill ; ""Stimmung"" = mood (though by that I only mean bad mood or mood-swings)"
Grattelisa,fdguz80,t1_fdgp88g,Thank you!
pretydarnamazing,fdgpfo2,t1_fdgp88g,"Is that pill meaning like Plan B? I‚Äôm confused because I take my pill much more than you seem to indicate. The tracker seems great by the way, I plan to rip this off in my bullet journal ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Miyutzi,fdgpncm,t1_fdgpfo2,"Thank you! No, I was meaning the normal pill. It was a time when I tried to take it again after quitting for a few months, but after two days already I got really bad side-effects again, so I decided to leave it completely. üòÖ"
pretydarnamazing,fdgrurj,t1_fdgpncm,"Oh wow I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs your experience. I actually want to start a tracker like this because when I take the pill I just bleed almost every day, but my doctor doesn‚Äôt seem to care and keeps telling me it will eventually regulate. I want to gather proof that another method might be better for me. Best of luck with whatever contraceptive you‚Äôre using lol"
G47_51,fdh15wl,t1_fdgpncm,I got horrible migraines from hormonal birth control! I finally got a salpingectomy a couple of years ago and I‚Äôm so grateful for it!!
jessiedyesyarn,fdgxvci,t1_fdgpncm,"You might want to look into an IUD (Intra Uterine Device)  they have different types, both Hormonal and non-hormonal, and one might work for you. I got my first one 3 years ago and It was life changing, I've just replaced it with a new one."
tortorlou,fdgsu9u,t1_fdgrurj,"Change docs! If they aren‚Äôt respecting you enough to listen to you, there‚Äôs too many options out there to stick with a terrible doctor"
0721217114,fdgu9b8,t1_fdgrurj,I had that issue on every pill except one specific generic of yasmin. It took a lot of work to find that one. My doctor is a nurse practitioner and she had a special little drug book for things like that. Years later after I had my daughter she pulled it out again to see what my breastfeeding safe options would be. If your doctor doesn't care fire them and get a new one. Bleeding all the time is a quality of life thing. I wish you luck in finding something that works!
Miyutzi,fdgs4lo,t1_fdgrurj,"Thank you, I wish you luck too. Hopefully you'll get to get to sort everything out."
Miyutzi,fdgy2gp,t1_fdgxvci,"I am informed already, but thank you for your concern."
pretydarnamazing,fdgtcc4,t1_fdgsu9u,"Yeah, thank you, that‚Äôs good advice and I am looking for a new one. I‚Äôm just not confident my next one will necessarily be great either so I want to be backed with data! But you‚Äôre definitely right about not staying with one who doesn‚Äôt seem to respect my concerns."
pretydarnamazing,fdgv94y,t1_fdgu9b8,"Yeah and to be honest that doesn‚Äôt even count the fact that I think it makes me crazy. I feel less in control of my emotions and mood swings when I‚Äôm on it. I originally had a man who was my gynecologist and I thought switching to a woman would help a lot of my problems, but I feel like I‚Äôm always trying to prove that I actually have issues. It might be time to find another practice altogether. I‚Äôm glad that you have such a caring doctor, if you‚Äôre lucky they‚Äôll be an age that your daughter could use them as well when she needs so you know she‚Äôs getting good care!"
Wikkalay,fdhvkr5,t1_fdgy2gp,What are you using instead lf the pill?
0721217114,fdgwtf4,t1_fdgv94y,"My doctor is actually also my mom's,  a family practice nurse practitioner, we don't have to go somewhere else to get an annual. I feel like a nurse practitioner is more inclined to spend more time and listen- nursing does that to you (not that doctors don't but my doctor actually chats with me about things that aren't visit issue related- we talk about school- we're both furthering our education and she knows I don't mind if she has students come in to see me). My daughter sees the same pediatrician I did as a child too. I got the doctor jackpot I think. 

Maybe look for a nurse practitioner in your area?"

cosmic-melodies,fdh0bui,t3_elaond,"Bonus points for forcing me to practice my German :) 

Also tracking sex makes so much sense, and who is anyone to shame you for... having a libido? Being a human being? Enjoying your life? Ignore ‚Äòem. Americans (who I will assume make up a chunk of this sub, myself included) tend to be way more weird about sex than (Western) Europeans (which I am assuming you fall into the category of), and I honestly envy you guys sometimes... internalized shame isn‚Äôt good for anyone. Go you, have sex (if you want) and enjoy yourself!"
Miyutzi,fdh42yj,t1_fdh0bui,"Thank you üòä
I was thinking the same, but wasn't sure if that would be too racist of a thing to say üòÖ"
cosmic-melodies,fdh51fc,t1_fdh42yj,"Lol, it‚Äôs totally true though (at least as far as general attitudes go.) Whenever I‚Äôve been in Germany there‚Äôs always a bit of a culture shock when I casually see a topless woman on a magazine cover just casually on display at stores (plus the various penis and breast shaped bachelor/bachelorette party paraphernalia right at the front of a shop). Having relatives and family friends in Germany, I would say that‚Äôs probably one of the sharper cultural lines [that and the amount of smoking! My lungs were suffering in Berlin :) ]"
Paranormal_Paradigm,fdhjz7b,t3_elaond,"New to the bullet journal stuff. I love the tracker page - I'm past the age to need it - but I'm ecstatic to see the conversation that's been started around it! I love the support I see here for women. It makes me happy. Guess I want to add mine too!  LOL   I had a hysterectomy when I was 29 - but damn, I remember the pain more than anything. Endometriosis.  Anyway - it didn't hurt my drive one bit back then. Ten years ago, when I went on antidepressants - and then high cholesterol/blood pressure/heart meds - it killed my nature. **Dead. Dead. As. A. Door. Nail.**  I'm married and I don't think I've had sex in 2 years.   In any case ladies - carry on!  Live life in the moment - and don't deny yourself a damn thing!"

heroicisms,fdgtq1i,t1_fdgrsvd,"if you look at it month by month it‚Äôs really not an outrageous amount of sex? sure at first glance it looks like a lot but often it‚Äôs really like, a few days consecutive and then a few days break. fucking like rabbits would have hearts every day or something lmao. it seems very normal to me.

candle_and_bra,fdh136a,t1_fdgrsvd,Your obsession with this is weird
pottymouthgrl,fdhmce7,t1_fdhjj9o,No she‚Äôs sharing a useful and helpful period tracker. Do you think her sharing her periods is also too private? And why should she have to ask her partner for permission?? Reddit is anonymous and it‚Äôs not like her partner would ever ever be identified from hearts in a journal.
-whatsalittlerain-,fdiagmi,t1_fdhjj9o,"I get what you're saying, if this was Instagram or Facebook it would be tmi (unless its a private group I guess) but that's the difference between social media and anonymous forums. We get to be way more open which lets us learn things we normally wouldnt be able to. A lot of men dont realize just how much meticulous tracking we women have to do, on top of dealing with the menstrual pains. So seeing these trackers I think could be a learning opportunity for them. And even a lot women didnt realize that they could/should track sex. She isnt violating her/her partner's privacy so what's the harm?"
loveinlilacs,fdho0gh,t1_fdhjj9o,"Then it's a good thing this post isn't about you or your sex life. 

You have no idea if OP had permission to share this or not. And if you want to feel embarrassed by talking about sex, that's your prerogative. But clearly the OP doesn't - and shouldn't - because it's literally a marking that sexual intercourse was had - OP didn't give any salacious details."
Wikkalay,fdhvfcu,t1_fdhjj9o,"The only thing you know about her is her period and how often she has sex. No race, age, skin color, height, nationality. Nothing. Why would this information be too private for a stranger that knows nothing about her?"

BadlandsViper,fdhxm6w,t3_elaond,I might have to steal this! Such a great idea to track sex with period stuff too. Personally mine both influence each other and I'd love to be able to be better in touch with my own cycles. Great job OP!
fckingmiracles,fdi0kwg,t1_fdhxm6w,"Use the OvuView app! It shows you great connections between things you never even thought of.

pottymouthgrl,fdhlzsk,t3_elaond,Omfg you can have sex on your period??? Jealous! I‚Äôve heard it alleviates cramps but I can‚Äôt even imagine it being anything but uncomfortable for me.
GossamerLens,fdht7t0,t1_fdhlzsk,My partner gives zero care about period or no. It definitely helps with cramps sometimes and is just generally fun to not have to worry about the months timing!
pottymouthgrl,fdhtv5b,t1_fdht7t0,"My SO has said he‚Äôd be up for it, that‚Äôs not the problem. I just can‚Äôt get behind it. I‚Äôm just so completely uncomfortable during my period that I am never in the mood!"
GossamerLens,fdhwlmh,t1_fdhtv5b,"That is fair! I deal with rather chronic shoulder and neck pain due to anxiety. So for me the added pain is, while painful, not a turn off as I'm always dealing with pain. While period sex is great, it really is just better for helping cramps and to not worry about vacations/dates being ruined if my period starts unpredictably. Haha"
pottymouthgrl,fdhy1da,t1_fdhwlmh,"It‚Äôs not the cramps pain, it‚Äôs the overall blah feeling, bloating, stomach issues. But I‚Äôm on the pill so I can rearrange my period to avoid special events and vacations lol"

lannaaax3,fdicbet,t1_fdibtra,"If you‚Äôre uncomfortable than move on. Nobody is forcing you to open this post, nobody forced you to go through the comments, nobody forced you to complain. 

There are people who are made uncomfortable by sex, it is their responsibility to manage their own feelings and reactions. OP posted a period tracker in a bullet journaling sub. Something that vastly affects your period is sex. They are completely in their right to post it. 

If you are so bothered by the mention of sex that tiny hearts trigger you, that‚Äôs on you to figure out. Not on the rest of us."

tinylilthang,fdhgw70,t3_elaond,"Honestly, I'm envious! My libido is super low and I wish it was higher! I'm not on any birth control either, so I don't know if there's anything I can do about it.

Also, I don't know why I didn't think about putting a period tracker in my bullet journal. I'm looking at it now like DUH!! I already track it on my phone, why not do it in my bullet journal too!"
GossamerLens,fdhu2kj,t1_fdhgw70,"If you feel like your libido isn't satisfying I would talk to your doctor. While some people are naturally low others can have hormonal imbalances that cause low libido. May be something to look into. 

Very good idea! I'm also going ""Duh!"" Haha"

theredfearnthrows,fe0a2y9,t1_fdzvqls,thats it! it will look like garbage for a while and then slowly it won't! I also like to focus in on one letter at a time and fill the whole page. There are also stroke drills to do.

theredfearnthrows,fe0a09q,t1_fdzq7ne,"not really, this is for keeping note of big important dates that are further ahead than the current month- i.e. birthdays, travel days, holidays, people visiting. My one from last year had at max about 6 entries.

maximuspovver,fdhcgav,t3_elcykj,I can definitely vouch for Knives Out and Hunt for the Wilderpeople! Now you've given me some more ideas of films to watch!
caseyoc,fdhpim1,t1_fdhcgav,Jojo Rabbit is amazingly wonderful.  Taika Waititi is brilliant.
neuroviolet,fdihuf2,t1_fdhpim1,I just watched Hunt for the Wilderpeople tonight! I love Taika Waititi üò≠
cottongrovecrochet,fdhgjr9,t3_elcykj,Grave of the Fireflies is the saddest movie I‚Äôve seen in my entire life. But it‚Äôs so good. Make sure you have some tissues üò≠

pokemiss,fdh3p9p,t3_elcykj,This is straight up lovely! So nicely done. Are you going to check off the boxes or mark them some other way?
neuroviolet,fdh70vb,t1_fdh3p9p,Thank you! :) I want to color them in but I think I might lose the film look so maybe a little check mark in each one? Or a teeny gold star sticker to check them off
hollyflaxseeds,fdh83ly,t1_fdh70vb,"I'd draw a fine line box inside the box. I think that will keep it looking like film, but the box will be different enough to see that's it's ""checked"" off. (:"

atXNola,fdi339h,t3_elcykj,Hi I'm new to bullet journaling and am trying to strategize how to plan/make one for 2020. I like the idea of this page along with one for books! Where do you put pages like this? Like in the beginning before or after the futures? and before the monthly/daily stuff? or do you space out pages and put them somewhere else?
neuroviolet,fdihoud,t1_fdi339h,"You‚Äôll learn that any ‚Äúsystem‚Äù you see is entirely up to the preference of whoever is making their bullet journal :) some people make an index and strategize the placement of every detail, others are more relaxed and free form, others are like mine where I‚Äôve decided this journal is only for media. Media like movies, tv, games, books, art inspo, etc. I love making art so I wanted to have a bullet journal reference of all the cool art I‚Äôve consumed so it can influence me in different ways. If you want a hard and fast rule you can make some pages at the start of each month with what movies or shows you want to get around to seeing, or a dedicated page or spread to movies you want to see throughout the year, doesn‚Äôt matter where you put it as long as it seems right for you"
atXNola,fdiq2k0,t1_fdihoud,"I‚Äôm definitely not trying to overthink it but the more I read and google (and scroll this subreddit and r/basicbulletjournals ) the more I 1-get overwhelmed, and 2-realize the best way to do it is just go! I‚Äôm wanting mine more for goal tracking and doing a daily gratitude journal so I‚Äôm going combine weekly‚Äôs and monthly‚Äôs somehow (I don‚Äôt need to write and rewrite my schedule three times). I also like the idea of keeping a list of books and movies I want to see/read. I think I‚Äôll use/save some pages at the beginning for stuff like this and then have the monthly/daily pages after that. It‚Äôs cool you have a journal just for art and hobbies. That will definitely be a good reference and walk down memory lane in the future!"

(sorry for my english. ;) )"
RileyTheDirewolf,fdr3tbv,t1_fdqa3jw,"If there‚Äôs a language you‚Äôre interested in learning, you could use some of those words in your bujo to help you learn, like using the days of the week in Spanish or something like that"

notideally,fdrw25v,t1_fdr3tbv,I generally try and write stuff down in spanish in my bullet journal. The best way to get better at a language is to practice it and consume it.

zoologist88,fdqwz4u,t3_empz37,"Just to let you know 8 cups is an arbitrary amount and you should be drinking however much corresponds to your weight and activity level.

What's your reference for the interpretations?"
eldoctoro,fdi5w4m,t1_fdi16vt,"Yes please feel free to get inspired (or steal it, I don‚Äôt think I invented anything here either! Ha.)

A lot of it is from Biddy Tarot, some of it is from conversations with friends, and a small bit of it is from my own experience. I copied a page that I had written out in a random notebook back in... September? So there might be some broken telephone in the interpretations!"
feanari,fdi61td,t1_fdi5w4m,"Thanks so much, I've just started reading, so I'm still very lost. This will help a ton."
eldoctoro,fdi6feu,t1_fdi61td,"The first time I wrote this out, my reading improved exponentially. Quite literally the evening after I wrote it all out I did three or four readings and they were all really good, like I had hit a flow state! Probably because it‚Äôs enough information to string together a narrative but not so much that you‚Äôre constantly reading someone else‚Äôs long winded interpretation. Good luck on your journey :)"

IShouldBCleaning,fdicgy1,t3_elhtz2,Beautiful! What journal & pens did you use?
eldoctoro,fdik8ah,t1_fdicgy1,"Thank you! The journal is by Quo Vadis and the cover says

LIFE JOURNAL

DOTS

BLACK EDITION

The white pen is a uniball signo broad white pigment ink, the gold and green are Sakura Gelly Rolls (gold is metallic, green is not), and the silver is a Pentel Slicci 0.8mm ball. 

They‚Äôre all very new to me, I‚Äôm still playing with them and figuring out what works but so far I am enjoying working with them! :)

Edit: autocorrect doesn‚Äôt share the same affinity for specific pens and their brands as we do.

Edit 2: the silver pen is what‚Äôs in the chart on the minor arcana page, major arcana is white ink wherever it looks like white ink, in case anyone was wondering."
LipstickAndCupcakes,fdirrvc,t1_fdik8ah,"Just an FYI, I had a black bujo last year and I think it was that white pen you are using (I tried out a few white pens so it could have been a different one) and it transferred over onto the other page. I would just hate to see all your hard work get ruined, so if your worried about it I suggest throwing a piece of tissue or something on the page so the two pages don‚Äôt touch when the book is closed"
eldoctoro,fdjzhmq,t1_fdirrvc,Thank you for the heads up!! I noticed a bit but assumed it was because I didn‚Äôt wait long enough for it to dry. Good to know!
jasminel96,fdi18ll,t3_elhtz2,I love how you did the major arcana!
eldoctoro,fdi67xf,t1_fdi18ll,Thanks!! I got a ruler that has a few little stencils in it and it‚Äôs giving me (and this spread) life.
jasminel96,fdi8ga3,t1_fdi67xf,"That‚Äôs pretty cool! I actually bought a pack of plastic stencils a couple months ago for my tarot journal and then I....kind of ignored it and now I‚Äôm trying to do a digital journal instead 

I hope you don‚Äôt mind if I steal your idea! I may try it out later :)"
eldoctoro,fdikgoz,t1_fdi8ga3,"Ha! I‚Äôve done that so many times with various stencils. This one is part of the ruler which I‚Äôm pretty good about keeping and using, so I‚Äôm hoping to trick myself into using the stencil more."
MissHurt,fdik7n7,t3_elhtz2,"I didn't know I needed black pages until now, this is gorgeous!"
eldoctoro,fdikjpk,t1_fdik7n7,Thank you! I saw a post on this very subreddit like four days ago that made me realize I needed a black bullet journal too.
EpiWren,fdhzkd2,t3_elhtz2,This is so beautiful!
eldoctoro,fdi63jg,t1_fdhzkd2,Thank you!! I spent waaaay too long with my bullet journal today (and not nearly enough time drinking water or being a functional member of society) but these two pages feel really special so I have no regrets!

IncredibleBulk2,fdi3twf,t3_elhtz2,Wish I could read this! What did you base it on?
eldoctoro,fdi6zpg,t1_fdi3twf,"A lot of it is from Biddy Tarot‚Äôs cheat sheets, but some of it is from my own experience and from a friend who is an *amazing* reader. She has a fun style/way of connecting everything. I think my favourite tarot thing I‚Äôve learned from her was about the ten of swords. Her elevator pitch description of that card is ‚Äúokay but why did it have to be TEN?!‚Äù 

(I know no one asked for that anecdote but I figured I may as well share while I have a somewhat captive audience!)"

i like to have them separated, but still next to each other so i can reference them easily. i found that when i have them together, my school assignments and deadlines kind of overwhelm my entire calendar!"

onlydaydreams,fdlhbpn,t1_fdlgm1z,"True, I used to keep a separate health notebook with symptoms and medications but the period part has degraded into ""spotting every damn day"".

splogkins,fdlhr2k,t1_fdlhbpn,Doctors seldom think their patients are capable of any intelligence just because the patient is sick. I have no idea about IUDs but that sounds very inconvenient. Are you alright now?
onlydaydreams,fdli8ku,t1_fdlhpmq,Oh jeez is this my future?!? The doctor told me to be patient with the spotting and it might take a month or two. Guess just need to be patient but also be mindful of any and all symptoms.
onlydaydreams,fdlidmg,t1_fdlhr2k,Body still feels like a hormonal mess but have a check up for placement and other concerns at the end of the month so will be able to go over all of that with my ob/gyn. For many women periods will become very light or stop completely with a hormonal IUD but she did warn me I would need to be patient and would have spotting for a month or two.
Drsugarbush,fdlicsn,t1_fdli8ku,"In my opinion, it was worth it in the end!"
splogkins,fdlig0w,t1_fdlidmg,"Ah. Well, I hope everything goes well for you!"

moxakitty,elylvb,top_level,Everyone please stop apologizing for posting 2020 stuff late.  You can start or finish a bullet journal at any time.
theknowledgebean,fdl73gi,t3_elylvb,"Let‚Äôs also include apologizing for your English if it‚Äôs not your native language. Reddit is global. Not everyone speaks English, and that‚Äôs great! Even if it‚Äôs broken English, most of us still know what you mean. In fact, most who apologize for their English speak better English than native speakers."
the_nothing_new,fdl7ken,t1_fdl73gi,I think they do that so people won't comment with grammar corrections which happens often on the entire platform whether the commenter is a native speaker or not.
theknowledgebean,fdl9okk,t1_fdl7ken,Good point. Didn‚Äôt think of that.
myfelicity,fdlcuy0,t3_elylvb,"Also, please don't apologize for not having an ""artsy"" bujo. Or for having a minimalistic one. Or asking if changing this tiny thing means it's still ""the right way"" to use a bujo...

You don't have to be Picasso Jr. You don't have to have a wonderful handwriting. You don't have to use all sorts of spreads.

As long as it works (and you can read your own writing), everything else doesn't matter!"
SpencerDub,fdlg9g0,t1_fdlcuy0,"Seriously. I wish this subreddit would enforce a ""no preemptive apologizing, no unsolicited criticism"" rule. People are out here apologizing left and right as if they expect commenters to tear them apart, which I've never seen happen. The result is a community culture that I worry is feeding this perfectionism: if that person, who's *clearly* more talented than me, is apologizing for their flaws, then I definitely need to apologize for mine!

The bujo community at large tends to attract perfectionist types, and I wish we would all extend a little more compassion and tolerance of imperfection, *especially* toward ourselves."
myfelicity,fdljnuz,t1_fdlg9g0,"Yes! Thank you!

To be honest, I would love if my journal would be the next big thing in the Louvre. But the effort I would have to put in there discourages me. I just don't have the time every week, and even if I do have it, I sometimes just can't be bothered.

It is wonderful if people use it as a creative outlet. I love seeing all the artistic spreads and ideas and title pages. But we shouldn't forget that all you need for a functional bujo is any kind of journal and a pen. (That's why I love to recommend the original ""how to""-video by Ryder Carroll.)"
moxakitty,fdmj6rz,t1_fdlg9g0,<3  Exactly why I haven't posted pics here yet.
scuttable,fdl8f8n,t3_elylvb,"I started in the middle of June last year, so all these ""sorry I'm late"" posts had me VERY confused for a bit. Like I didn't know the turn of the year meant THAT much to people when it comes to starting new things."
talen_lee,fdlay4z,t3_elylvb,I feel like this is a problem of Reddit and the karma system (rewarding behaviour) conflicting with the *entire point* of bujo.

monsterindecloset,fdoawgz,t3_emd5uc,this is crazy creative! did you pull any inspiration or was it all straight off the dome?
ellrxse,fdoslbv,t1_fdoawgz,"I like that phrase, straight off the dome! If I'm understanding it right then yeah, it came out of my own head - I'm always doing little projects like this. But I'm sure there was something I saw once upon a time that allowed me to think it up in the first place. All art is imitation, as the saying goes ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

LittleFluffFerial,fdqc83d,t1_fdp80fj,Have you been to r/bujo or r/basicbulletjournals? They are much less artsy and focus more on productivity (esp basic)
kitkat714,fdpysa9,t3_emjwrf,Would you be willing to take pics and post them?! I am also looking for some ideas to keep it simple and not overwhelm myself and it‚Äôs hard to read with the video. :)
shelbyspilker,fdrlsum,t1_fdpysa9,Okay [here‚Äôs](https://imgur.com/a/P0iCNXU) an imgur album for my whole layout so far with a lil explanation for each! I got a lot of ideas from Pypah‚Äôs Art on YouTube as well as some random inspo from Pinterest!
La_S,fdq7kzb,t3_emjwrf,"Wow, this is beautiful. 

Mine looks like an ugly scrawl of to-do lists in a hastily put together weekly spread (just the days written down the left-hand side) 80% of the time. But I'm fine with that - it puts zero pressure on me and lets me keep up with it.

I'd love to do a monthly art theme once. I'm not artistic but I could doodle a little something in the corner each week."
shelbyspilker,fdrmkbr,t1_fdq7kzb,"Thanks so much! I am a BIG fan of random to do lists on scraps of paper and notes on my phone, but I wanted to challenge myself to be more artistic this year. I figured it would be a perfect mashup, do something simple enough that I can keep up with while still being a lil artsy. 

I have to say I‚Äôve really enjoyed it, feels like I have something that gives me purpose to work on on the weekdays after work."

shelbyspilker,fdp7fux,t1_fdp78hs,Thanks! I started out with slimmer uniform edges done with a ruler but I thought it looked bland! Actually used a sharpie fabric marker with a brush tip for the thick borders and really dug the look of it!

ThreeWheelsOfCheese,fdqp6pm,t3_emjwrf,I really like your mushroom drawings! They‚Äôre so cute and colorful. I just overall like how you laid out your pages - the washi tape and the borders are cool. Makes me feel inspired to make my journal a bit prettier.
shelbyspilker,fdrms62,t1_fdqp6pm,"Thank you so much!! I‚Äôm definitely enjoying having such a simple artistic outlet. Like I don‚Äôt feel super pressured to come up with ideas or bang out an amazing art piece, just random fun little doodling and page layouts to help relax."

splogkins,fdnaz0d,t1_fdn80ef,Thank you so much. And yes it is. It's part of the earth tones pack. [Original swatch post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bulletjournal/comments/e004u2/finally_decided_on_a_pen_set_for_2020_faber/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) . It's beautifully pigmented and then some. It's also waterproof and light proof -rants on and on-
yoshi_in_black,fdo0txo,t3_em7kq7,"I love it. Without you mentioning it, I wouldn't have even seen any uneven lines. Be proud of your work."

heckinnoidontthinkso,fdieckm,t3_elj65e,I love how the cat has to stop for a spot of grooming. All the better to lull that vicious ribbon into a false sense of security!
shaddragon,fdibyrl,t3_elj65e,"The trailing ends are chewed off every bujo bookmark I have.  And sometimes more than the ends.  Also, teethmarks in most of the pens.  Brat cats.  (She's lovely!)"

Also cat owners must have so much patience. I think I'd get annoyed too quickly lol"

Josquin_TheMan,feb9icd,t3_eo5cq6,"This reminds me of an old windows ‚Äò95 screensaver. I used to just watch all those pipes move when I was bored, and pretend it was building a house, and convince myself I was psychic by predicting what color was gonna be next."
