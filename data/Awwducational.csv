At first, baby elephants don't really know what to do with their [trunks](https://www.thoughtco.com/about-elephants-trunks-129966). They swing them to and fro and sometimes even step on them. They will suck their trunk just as a human baby might suck its thumb.

By about 6 to 8 months, calves begin learning to use their trunks to eat and drink. By the time they are a year old, they can control their trunks pretty well and, like adult elephants, use their trunks for grasping, eating, drinking, bathing.

[https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/blogs/how-baby-elephants-drink-water](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/blogs/how-baby-elephants-drink-water)

Although it only takes newborn elephants a few hours to master standing and walking — vital skills for nursing — they need much more time to figure out how to use their trunks. The long appendages on their faces are valuable multipurpose tools, but without an instruction manual, it can be almost a year before baby elephants really understand how to use them.

vanillamasala,fdjvln0,t1_fdjk6hu,I’m almost crying because of how cute this is!
t0asti,fdjrcfn,t1_fdjokdo,"that wikipedia article actually gives a bit of a different timeline than OP suggests

> For the first few days [...] it has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. 

> For its first three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after which it begins to forage for vegetation and can use its trunk to collect water. [...] Calves continue to suckle at the same rate as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. [...] It continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older."

OP said ""Baby elephants can't use their trunks properly until 6-8 months"" - which like I said is similar enough.  It seems like they read that or something similar and then paraphrased it, since you can't post a whole paragraph as a post title.  They then linked a source with more information.  It's not untrue."

Dazvsemir,fdk0hxq,t1_fdjw777,"But it is designed to be as misleading as possible, while still technically being trueish. They're trying to create an impression of a cute baby swinging its trunk helplessly for 8-9 months while it is more like they stop making mistakes by then. You're also remembering it slightly differently than what OP said.


>At first, baby elephants don't really know what to do with their trunks. They swing them to and fro and sometimes even step on them. 

for 1-2 weeks.

>By about 6 to 8 months, calves begin learning to use their trunks to eat and drink.

they do that from birth, at about a month old they can pick up things and put them in their mouth, by 3 months they begin to eat and drink with their trunk"

We saw elephants, giraffes, hippos, antelope, a cheetah and a lion pride. It was even the time of year where baby elephants were wandering around and we were lucky enough to see a pair of babies playing together. One of the best life experiences I have so far :)

I have pictures and I was praised for having really good photos because I can take pictures through the binoculars."
Thor1noak,fdjvut0,t1_fdjlzph,"I've always heard that elephants had to be 'broken' in order to be tamed and that this process was brutal af on them, akin to animal cruelty.

What do they do differently that makes them ethical? I've always wanted to ride an elephant but always refrained to when I was in Laos, I'd be pumped to learn about an ethical way of doing it.

anonzilla,fdl3kyn,t1_fdjvut0,"They have to be broken in generally cruel ways to be ridden. Ethical experiences don't allow you to ride the elephants. It was kind of funny cause these ones just do as they please on a large tract of land, so we spent almost an hour tracking them down at first. 

And yes as /u/alex891011 correctly assumed, these were actually rescue elephants. They were adults not babies, but they loved me as soon as I started feeding them bananas. Kind of horny critters tbh, not to me but with each other, heh."

Jk lol holding your legs together is awful so you've gotta give the boys some air. It's just coincidence but I was talking to myself about my balls and in my case it's an issue cause they're  massive and I dont know why. the ratio of ball to shaft is worrisome I used to think I had cancer. As for pain yes even the slightest love tap can make your insides fold over. Knock the wind out of you crying instantly throw up if its real bad. Just 2 big lumps of nerves and organs with no protection whatsoever and no medicine or any kind of treatment you just have to let it subside. I imagine cramps are worse because they last longer a bad nut shot still will only hurt for a little while talking minutes or so If there isn't real damage.

AJTwinky,fdk11vw,t1_fdjykix,"That’s not what I meant, I just thought they breathed through their trunk and with the tip of the trunk in their mouth they might not be able to breathe as well.
I don’t know about elephant anatomy though, it was more of a question than anything.

Still think it’s cute that they suck on it in the same way how babies suck their thumb."
Tobi97,fdk17bq,t1_fdk11vw,I believe they breath through both the mouth and trunk like for us humans and our nose.

Plump_Knuckle,fdqjff5,t1_fdqdim2,"Particularly those birds that hunt squirrels in the forest.

In my experience, as a grey squirrel hunter in the NE, squirrels stick to areas of heavy underbrush when pressured by owls/hawks. Birds can dart and drive between branches at high speed, but leafy bushes keep the squirrels concealed and inaccessible.

The crafty old bushy-tails learn pretty quick that birds have no problem snagging you off a tree branch."

beanmeboi,feaiuuj,t1_fea5cyx,"I doubt they would try to relocate them unless they are in an enclosed space. Manatees are fairly hardy and can tolerate fresh and ocean water, so they often go through rivers and streams that connect with the ocean. They usually end up in places they can get out of and come and go as they please. Having manatees in your back yard isn’t a big deal, it’s actually kinda cool, they don’t harm anything.

There are comments below saying no it’s not legal, but my class went down to Clearwater FL (this would have been in Feb of 2007 because I’m old), and we went out on the water with a Swim With Manatees Tour and they were the ones who told us about the moss and tummy scritches. I made very good friends with a baby manatee who *loved* the scritches and playing so it followed me around for the whole two hours I was in the water. It’s still to this day one of my favorite memories!"
beanmeboi,feahd52,t1_fe98lgd,"Swimming with manatees is legal, and if one comes up to you and is touching you first, you are allowed to interact. You can’t interact with them if you are on a boat though, you have to be physically in the water. My marine biology class is going on a field trip to swim with manatees and we went over some of the rules in class (because high schoolers can be stupid).

Edit: I forgot to mention that you can’t force any interaction! And if they do come up and touch you, you can’t get all over them. You have to stay restricted to the area that they exposed to you or else you could have a legal problem on your hands. Manatees are really friendly and some of them will come up and touch you, they are curious by nature, but any touching back (outside of a light touch or rub) will get you in trouble."
nomadofwaves,feag35p,t1_fe98lgd,You can swim near manatees but you cannot touch them.
MrsNLupin,fe9j1w7,t1_fe9fnva,"You can snorkel with them (there are lots of tours up north that do this), but you can't touch them"
SymplyJay,fe9fmqy,t1_fe98may,"Two hands are illegal. The Endangered Species Act forbids touching a manatee unless it touches you first, and they will let you know.” There is absolutely no chasing, riding or harassing manatees.
So there is some speculation as to “what” you can do when engaging with them."
HumanistPeach,fe9ulou,t1_fe98may,"Considering the baby manatee actively followed me for two hours and I only ever scritched with one hand, sounds like I’m safe. Thanks for your concern."
nomadofwaves,feas35v,t1_feajym2,Yea I know all this. I live in Florida. I’ve never seen them in what essentially looks like a retention pond.
Dengar96,fea72wa,t1_fea3thn,"Yes because the guy sitting in the state house somehow controls how the federal government protects its wetlands and residential contamination levels. Even after Scott Pruitt, the US still has legit and strong protections on areas specifically like this. Coastal waterways are strictly protected especially near residencies and green areas."
Dengar96,fea9grj,t1_fea93ux,ah sorry right I forgot my pandering internet manners.. ahem.. Florida bad amirite?
Dengar96,febjvw1,t1_feahcci,"I have and so have regulators but, as I said, there's no controlling each individual person so some accidental spillage will occur no matter what"
Notophishthalmus,febzixz,t1_feaiuuj,"Was gonna say obvious danger discrepancy aside, these guys have access to larger water ways and can move freely. Although I wonder do the always have ocean access, can/do they get isolated?"
beanmeboi,feaprlf,t1_feac7ry,"Well, manatees aren’t territorial. I doubt they would stay in one place for an extended period of time. Mainly because they are so big and need quite a lot of food. Manatees swim in rivers, lakes and in the ocean along the coast, so they have quite a big area to go looking for food in. They don’t like sharing space with other manatees and tend to swim solo or in pairs, but some times you can see groups of 4 or 5. If a place has a lot of manatees it’s probably because it’s large and has a lot of food, once that food is gone the manatees will move on to bigger and better things. If a place doesn’t have food, there’s really no reason for the manatee to stick around, and since they are herbivores they have to search for food in other places when they run out of it where they are."
SymplyJay,fe9ejnh,t1_fe99klk,"Was here in 2016 and exactly the same things where said. You are not suppose to touch them BUT if they come up to you and engage with you it’s a grey area. 
One of the babies INSISTED I gave it a little scratch, would be right up to me nudging me.. I think at this point how are you to reject such a majestic beast! 
For sure a highlight swimming with these gentle giants. 
Manatees are very curious mammals and will for sure come up to you, advised not to make a disturbance in the water when they approach to remain calm and allow them to check you out not the other way around."
Bekah679872,fe9njcv,t1_fe99klk,As a general rule you don’t want to interact with or feed wild animals because it teaches them that all humans aren’t a threat. You want them to think that we’re a threat so that they don’t get accidentally hurt.
stifflizerd,fe9xwvk,t1_fe9fmqy,Does that still apply if they're no longer endangered?

tlevins23,fecebzr,t1_febzixz,The water level rises and falls with the tide so I’m sure there are times they get stuck but there is plenty of space for them and enough water even during low tide.  They would be safer to raise young then the ocean.

Yogs_Zach,febs2ka,t1_fe9xwvk,"There may still be state laws against it.

Edit: Googling it, they are still afforded the same protections, as they are still Threatened. 

>The Fish and Wildlife Service emphasized in its announcement Thursday that existing federal protections for manatees would remain in place, despite their removal from the endangered list. The agency credited efforts by Florida, as well as Puerto Rico, Caribbean countries and public and private organizations, for the West Indian manatee’s comeback."
DanelRahmani,fe9wp4k,t1_fe9woe1,I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good
LadySilvie,fe8qbwn,t3_eo4rqb,"When I was visiting a beach in Florida on vacation many years ago (as a child) we were taken by surprise when a bunch of manatees including babies swam right up to us. It was terrifying. 

I had refused to go into the water the entire trip until that day when my family forced me to, and out of nowhere these huge shapes moved up to us while we were playing in chest-deep water. They are so big, their tails are literally wider than I was. 

They were just curious and brushed right against us seemingly wanting to be touched as I desperately tried to swim back to shore without touching one because I was certain it was very illegal to be that close and I didn’t want to anger one but I’m very thankful it was manatees and not any other scarier critters of the deep lol."
Little-Jim,fe99iy2,t1_fe8qbwn,I can't even imagine a manatee being able to get angry.
Techi-C,feae52i,t1_fe8qbwn,"My brother and I were swimming on the beach in Florida when we saw dolphins in the distance. I went up on the dock to watch them when one swam right up to my brother and brushed against him. Marine mammals are so smart and so cute, they’re just as curious of us as we are of them. They probably get confused when they see us, land creatures, in the water, so they come to investigate."
RichestMangInBabylon,feah7ld,t1_fe8qbwn,"I went swimming with manatees on purpose last year. The guide said don't touch but if they touch you then it's their own fault lol. Apparently they're super good at sensing things in the water so they never bumped into us as we just floated there, but got pretty close."
LadySilvie,fe9d72w,t1_fe99iy2,"We didn’t go somewhere they were expected to appear so had done no research into them at all and I didn’t want to risk it haha

Also, if you couldn’t tell, I hate water. I am afraid of the ocean. Giant animals that live there were at the top of my do-not-mess-with list both so I don’t hurt them and so they don’t hurt me lol.

I grew up on a midwestern farm with a pet land-cow. I know those much better than sea-cows. There are no nearby fences I can dive over if the sea-variety started to charge, though I acknowledge the fact that they lack horns and know now they are unlikely to charge 😂"
generalright,fea4h2g,t1_fe99iy2,Aw man do they get angry though. I saw a youtube video describing a dangerous encounter between a guy and an aggressive male manatee. I’m sure if you google manatee attack you’d find it.
LadySilvie,feaepdj,t1_feae52i,"Dolphins freak me out too haha. They are really interesting though. 

I’m sure these manatees (not managers as autocorrect wants me to say, but it is funny enough to mention) were used to humans coming up to them because as we left the water we saw other tourists swimming up towards them to get a better look. I’ve read since then that they apparently enjoy being scratched/pet (even though it is illegal) so maybe they were wanting attention and not just a look at what we were up to lol."
ThatRaggedyMan,febc4sm,t1_feae52i,Their reaction to /u/LadySilvie was probably the same as our reactions to when we want to play with a cute critter in the wild and they run away.
imabeecharmer,fecbt4y,t1_feae52i,Except when they wonder what we taste like...
LadySilvie,feahtoz,t1_feah7ld,"They were rolling around playing around us I think. The baby was particularly curious which is what made me nervous the most lol. 

I got away with only touching the side of one but there were other people who they touched with their fins if I recall. 

I’m more used to wild critters like bears that you DO NOT go near when they have babies and even if they come towards you that is not a good thing lol. Tbf I guess manatees lack teeth and claws but they are still big and better at being in water than me!"

JayQue,fe9fnvt,t1_fe8zs7k,"It’s technically illegal for you to interact with them physically but it’s fine if *they* come up to *you*, which is really quite common. I’ve had a manatee hold my hand against its belly, not scary tight, but firmly."
susanreneewa,fe9tspe,t1_fe8zs7k,"My husband and I both got hugged BY manatees. We were snorkeling with them in Crystal River, and one was chewing on my husband’s wetsuit zipper pull and then wrapped its flippers around him and pulled him close. He was a little shocked, and the manatee was quite strong, but it let him go after a second and my husband was thrilled. I was swimming by our boat and I suddenly saw one to my right. It rolled over, pulled me in, hugged me, and swam away, pushing me out behind it. The dive leader of another group was laughing as I looked so startled. It was truly astonishing. She said they like our heat, but I think they just like to hug."
KingKilla568,fe95j4e,t1_fe8zs7k,"If you go kayaking down the rivers here they'll swim right up to you from time to time.  You're not supposed to get out of your boat to swim with them but its definitely legal to swim in the water.  So, if you just so happen to really need to cool down in the water (cause it always stays 72° because of the springs while being 95°+ outside) right when some manatees are coming by, nobody will bat an eye. *wink wink*"

statix138,feat86h,t1_fe8zs7k,"Not sure about hugging them but you can certainly interact with them.  I have swam with manatees a few times in Crystal River, Florida (great scallop diving there as well) and it is a lot of fun.  You absolute cannot touch them but if your hand is out and they swim by and rub up against it that is 100% allowed. If you have the opportunity I strongly you encourage you to take it, it is a blast."

The change in status from Endangered to Threatened was very controversial.  While the numbers have significantly rebounded from the 1970s low, several conservation groups feel that the downgrade in status in 2017 was premature and done for political reasons."
world-sad-sick,feb3nk0,t1_fe9lped,"It was controversial because it was done to sell water rights of Florida springs to Coca-Cola. Manatees depend on warm water from natural springs to stay warm in the winter. The protected status meant that those springs couldn't be tapped for commerce. 
 
Conservationists are now very concerned that manatees don't have enough safe places to winter and could be in real danger of extinction years from now."

Prying-Open-My-3rd-I,febdyjp,t1_fe9h3qp,You ever put a hose in the water and watch it drink the fresh water? I remember seeing manatees when I was a kid at boat docks hoarding around for fresh water from a hose.  I just did a quick search and apparently you aren’t supposed to give them water. It makes them less self reliant and can cause them to lose their natural fear of humans.
cocoabeach,fe9sz9y,t3_eo4rqb,"A few years ago near Cocoa Beach a female swam into very shallow water trying to get away from the males.  A bunch of them pushed up to her but could not get under her to mate.  They tried for a really long time. Over and over again they would nudge her trying to roll her over. Once in a while, one at a time they would swim off and then come back.

None of the males fought over her, just gently tried to get her to roll over. One old looking manatee though seemed to be really content just laying there with his snout pressed up under her.  He didn't shove or push, just hovered there. It seemed like he remembered being there was a good thing but couldn't remember what to do, or had gotten old and knew anything more was a waste of energy, the young guys would just get there first.

Then some fool human decided to walk out and stand in the middle of the group taking pictures.  He was darn near killed when he frightened them and they all abruptly turned tail and swam away."

theundercoverpapist,fe91fi1,t3_eo4rqb,"I live on the Space Coast of Florida, so these are a common sight in my neck of the woods. They love it when you spray fresh water from a hose at them. They'll pop their heads above the water so the stream goes right into their mouth. Be wary, though, because this is also illegal for some stupid reason."
myhandleonreddit,fe9p6i4,t1_fe91fi1,"Because when they've been trained to ""pop their heads above the water"", BOATS HIT THEM. Stop doing this for the love of god."
theundercoverpapist,fe9y3ru,t1_fe9p6i4,"Ok, 

A: They float on/near the surface of the water for probably 97% of their lives. They breath air, even and especially while they sleep. 

B: They don't stick their head up for fresh water from a hose unless fresh water is actually coming out of a hose and hitting the water. They don't just pop up for fresh hose water in the middle of a river. They do it near the shore when the hose is running. 

C: They already have strictly enforced boat speeds posted in areas where manatees frequent. And believe it or not, almost everyone follows the posted speeds. 

And D: None of that ^^^ even matters because they discovered 20+ years ago that the reason they get hit by boat propellers is that they can't hear the frequency of a propeller in the water until it's too close. So they invented sound emitting devices, which attach to boats beneath the waterline, that emit a warning frequency that manatees *can* hear in plenty of time to move... even with boats traveling at top speed. The attempt to make these cheap, sensible devices mandatory for boat owners was struck down multiple times for God knows what reason. Probably because people care enough to want manatees to live, but not enough to actually educate themselves on the best way to achieve that goal. 


Perhaps if the public learned more about nature, and innovations aimed toward natural ends, instead of simply parroting back regurgitated mis/disinformation, and spent less time tugging at an imaginary left/right political rope, then at-risk species like manatees (which are thriving, by the way, and have been downgraded from endangered) would get real help instead of simply serving to score fake points in social media debates."

I got my bag ripped thru and searched a few times on that trip too but nobody found my shell! I’m guessing being that it was part of native wildlife there comes a risk of specific diseases and stuff that the shell could carry. Also given that I took it right off the beach, it was not treated, sterilized or sealed in any way."
obsolete_filmmaker,fe6au0c,t1_fe6a5z5,"Huh. I wonder if its because they dont want people killing them for the shell? If it was what you said, wouldnt every airport that is a tropical location have rules about shells? Everybody grabs shells from the beach...."

I always watch them fascinated when they take a big bite out of something I want to eat or drink something from a glass. And countless of them ran around on my fingers, arms, legs and my face.

He slammed a jar over the thing on the sidewalk. It was angry as hell, buzzing in the jar, its stinger constantly attempting to sting the glass. I’d never want to experience its sting. Cicada killer wasps famously pierce the hard carapace of cicadas with its huge stinger, envenomate and paralyze the cicadas, then bring them into its ground burrow.

>It is thought that wasp species and stingless bees were the first pollinators of the avocado, before the introduction of the honeybee to the Americas. *B. mellifica* are pollinators because when they collect honey and larvae; they carry lots of pollen on their hairy head – including avocado pollen. They also carry pollen on their thorax and legs, and inside their unique thoracic cavities. While many wasp species visited the avocado flowers, they were not successful in pollination because of their hairless bodies.

>*B. mellifica* is one of few insects besides bees to create and store their own honey. Chromatographic analysis of *B. mellifica* honey showed 6/7 of the same peaks that appeared in honeybee mesquite honey. Melibiose is the only peak that did not occur in both honeys. Both the glucose and fructose content in B. mellifica honey is comparable to that of honeybee mesquite honey. The similarities in the two honeys substantiate the idea that these are foraging wasps, because honey stores come from multiple common floral sources, such as mesquite and sunflower."
Geovestigator,fdxkw78,t1_fdvnwv0,I wish to try some of this honey. I wonder if they started to sell it online and use the profits to help the bees if that would be a helpful thing

In the case of Anhingas (aka ""snake birds""), researchers think it's more about body temperature regulation rather than wing drying. With cormorants, they think it's more about wing drying. And also, I thought buzzards and turkey vultures were two wildly different species, but the internet rabbit hole says that, in the U.S. ""buzzard"" is just like a nickname for turkey vultures.

They had to dock Bianca's tail because I can only imagine how painful that would be to break your tail so many times. She's fine now, just a smiling little butt-wiggler.

That's an anecdotal case of a tail being docked for medical reasons, but most of the time, it's completely unnecessary in most dogs.

There’s also something called “happy tail” where a can keep breaking its tail or splitting it open. It’s hard to heal because it’s really difficult to keep a dog’s tail from moving, so sometimes it’s kinder just to surgically remove it.

6_seasons_and_a_movi,fe1t17w,t1_fdyjulx,One reason is that dogs like spaniels which love running around in dense undergrowth (and sometimes are used specifically for that as working dogs) have very fluffy tails which frequently get caught on brambles if they are left long.

I don’t know if she’d do that with another part of her body had her tail been natural though. The only thing I’m concerned about is ear cropping. Natural ears need to be cleaned a lot to prevent ear infections. Our natural ear baby has such bad ear infections. I don’t like that floppy ears are a consequence of domestication. I wish Dobermans had upright ears naturally. But I don’t think I would crop one’s ears if I were in that position anyway. Just a wish for natural up right ears."

Your vet did not provide you with enough information to give informed consent for the procedure. I can imagine the guilt you felt, I would’ve felt it too!

Apparently in 2019, New York became the first state to ban declawing unless medically indicated. It boggles my mind that it’s still such a common thing in America, although at least progress is being made. Source: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onychectomy"
Quantentheorie,fe1of8w,t1_fe092fn,"When it's not normalized by society people seem to very intuitively understand that docking and declawing arent okay. 

People who never heard about it tend to react consistently confused and appalled.

It's really one of those things that can very easily be addressed by outlawing it. I still get mad about the arguments in favour of maintaining the practice which are consistently superficial and selfish. The shelter killing argument is among the most infuriating, because its justifying the abuse of cats with a broken system of shelter killing excess animals that shouldn't and doesn't have to exist in that form but does because accountability for pet owners is low. Argument is not sound when it justifies itself with a series of systematic fuckups that leave a bad option as the best of alternatives.

If you cross bred something with up ears into the breed, and then bred those pups back into the gene pool after a few generations the pups would look back to breed standard AND have erect ears. But of course then they would no longer be considered purebred and for some reason that's worse than having genetic issues that could he resolved with outcrosses."

Also when I read about the Siberian fox domestication experiment, it talked about how floppy ears was one of the changes they started seeing in the more domesticated foxes. Personally I prefer up ears because I think they are more natural, and my poor baby with natural ears gets such bad ear infections. In the winter most of her ear fur sometimes falls off and she gets scabs at the ends of her ears, which when she shakes her head (from having an ear infection), causes the scabs to split open and send blood flinging everywhere! And she hates having the medicine put in (she seems to be doing much better this winter tho).

But cats are incredible hunters and super efficient, so because of the shear number of cats around they pose a serious threat to bird species who could go extinct. Cats breed really quickly and don’t often stay with their young for very long, so they can easily overwhelm bird populations because bird eggs are stationary in nests and very easy prey for cats (who already can take out adult birds, even wearing bells). Cats are responsible for ~14% of modern mammal and reptile extinction (as of 2013, I’m pretty sure this has increased in the past 7 years).
In a lot of areas cats are invasive species who have been introduced so they tend not to have any natural predators and the species that they prey on tend to not have any natural defences against cats.

The author of the book notes a potential shortcoming of the informal study is that “Of course one might argue that this study might be flawed because many of the dogs which have docked tails are working dogs designed for guarding and protection functions, such as the Rottweiler, Boxer or Doberman. Thus they might be expected to have a somewhat more forceful and insistent personality which might lead them into confrontations with other dogs.”

They also have some anecdotal evidence from adult dogs that have had their tail removed due to an accident, and were approached more cautiously by other dogs thereafter.

The author also discusses a study that used a robot dog to test how real dogs reacted to the robot with its tail long/short and wagging/still, and found dogs are more likely to approach a dog with a long/wagging than either short/wag short/still, and long/still least of all. These results are more modest afaict but pretty interesting https://web.uvic.ca/~reimlab/robodog.pdf

Overall I think I’m fairly convinced that dogs lose an important communication tool when their tails are short or cropped. I’m cautious about the specific claim “twice as likely to get into fights”, and think it might be less if you controlled for breed. I grew up with several dogs with docked tails (Australian shepherd, poodle), so it was pretty normal to me, but these results make me much more skeptical of the practice"

kinenchen,fe09bkr,t1_fe08f1n,"The term ""docking"" refers to breeds who have their tails removed within weeks of birth, usually to conform to a breed standard dictated by a kennel club or similar organization. These breed standards are not created with consultation of a veterinarian and are arbitrary, are purely aesthetic, and do not take into account temperament or health of the dog. However, veterinarians are often tasked with removing tails from healthy dogs who will probably never experience 'happy tail syndrome'.  


Dogs who suffer 'happy tail syndrome' may have all or part of their tails amputated. The term ""amputated"" refers to a procedure that is deemed medically necessary for the health and/or welfare of the dog."

If the dog is a hunting dog then (supposedly) docked tails are safer for them to do their job. Other dogs can wag their tails so hard that they cause injuries/break them/etc, and docking them prevents constant injuries and risk of infection.

I hate docking for aesthetic purposes though so I totally understand what you're trying to get at."

I very much wish they were both docked. The undocked boy injures his tail  c o n s t a n t l y and there is nothing we can do about it; it's like his brain isn't attatched to it and smashes it into everything. He would be a wonderful hunting dog but I'm very worried about how injured he could get.

I asked the vet about it and she was very nonchalantly like 'Oh, we can amputate.' Which tbh *would* be cruel because he's spent his life with a tail now and wouldn't necessarily have the plasticity to compensate like a puppy would.


Tail docking was made illegal here recently and while I agree docking for aesthetic reasons is nonsensical, in hunting breeds it is unethical to not do it. I know a top breeder who has discontinued due to the ban and the injuries she has seen in non-docked hunting dogs. My understanding is that germany recently made an exemption to their laws for that reason.


I have also assisted with docking puppies too, and can say the process is a lot less painful or upsetting that any number of other necessary procedures still practiced.


I'm suspicious of the ""all docked dogs"" catch-all too. Different breeds are docked different lengths which would influence level of available communication. Boxers, corgies for example lose almost all their tail whereas GSPs still have about 1/3."

When I take her on walks I try to avoid crossing paths with other dogs or people just because she’s easily excitable and jumps which can be annoying to others. She’s only about 20lbs and in public areas she’s excited to see other dogs rather than aggressive/defensive, but she’s been attacked by dogs bigger and smaller than her. I’m talking puncture wounds, bite marks, and emergency vet visit. I’ve been scratched head to toe trying to save my dog. We rarely go on walks now  because it’s just so scary. It’s so sad seeing her excitement of seeing a dog turn to fear because she’s being attacked. I can’t get her tail back and I’ve always felt guilty over her tail being docked. :("
black_dead_spider,fe1r6qo,t1_fe0k44q,"It sounds to me like she may need to be re-educated in how to interact with new dogs. Two new dogs should never ever meet if they are heightened. There meeting in a park area which is great because it’s neutral territory, but it sounds like other dogs are correcting her behaviour. 

My advice would be take her on walks and work on having her sit to the side of the footpath when another dog approaches where she cannot interact with the new dog., yet. The goal is to get her to calm down when in the presence of a new dog. Reward her, tell her to sit. If you find she is still to overwhelmed turn the opposite way and walk her away from the approaching dog. Try again getting her to sit. 

When she does eventually learn to sit and stay while the other dog approaches and walk past her give treats a few seconds later each time. She’s not ready to meet them till she can have them walk past and have no treat. 

Then introducing her to new dogs I would aim for dogs her size. So she’s not jumping to sniff them, or hovering over them. That can be daunting to a small dog and annoying for large dogs. Your breed is the kind who just offloads her love on everyone, side wiggle butt and active sniffing. It can be too much for some dogs. Approach the new dog or have the new dog approach you, have her sit or if you trust she can stand just not wiggling around. Have a sniff and move on. Do that for weeks, months depending how often she is introduced to new dogs and how well she responds to training. 

Personally I would never trust a strangers dog. So always keep her on a lead, always settle her down if she’s becoming too much. Teach her “that’s enough” which means she comes back to you and sits with you. And she will eventually be met with dogs who are just as high energy as she is and doesn’t mind the active meeting. She can’t get that chance at this time because her intro is holding her back. 

Hope this helps, personally I think she will do fine without a tail. I disagree with tail removal, but her tail isn’t the only thing she communicates with. Her whole body is her communication tool."
gothiccxcontrabitch6,fe3vwol,t1_fe1r6qo,"Thank you for the advice! She is always on leash and harness and while she is excited to see other dogs she does not run to them unless they are already close. She’s pretty good at walking past people and animals who are calm, but once they react she gets nervous/excited. If she and the other dog react, I stand in front of her til they pass. I don’t walk her in my own neighborhood now, after we got attacked by a neighbors dog right outside our house. I take her to the forest and the lake to decrease that territorial behavior and put more space between us and other walkers. 

Unfortunately we’ve come across so many dogs, big and small, who are unleashed and charge at her like they’re out for blood when we are minding our own business, and their owners just laugh! I know you’re supposed to stay still and calm when a dog attacks, but I don’t know how to protect my dog other than picking her up and walking away. I don’t want my dog getting seriously injured (again) or dying because someone can’t/won’t control their dog. 

I’ll definitely try a slower paced walk with treats enforcing her to sit and stay. She’s already 5 but she’s smart so she should catch on fast. Hopefully all of this will help decrease the number of attacks and she can make some dog friends instead. Thank you again!"

Sweetdee8181,fdzquoz,t3_endrki,"This is going against the popular opinion in this thread but...

A lot of the breeds that have docked tails are often bred to be more aggressive (rotties, dobermans). Then there are breeds with short tails that aren't usually aggressive or behave poorly with other dogs....yorkies, aussies, corgis, etc. Everyone is jumping to conclusions because it just ""sounds about right."""
kinenchen,fdzz8sy,t1_fdzquoz,"Here are some interesting data from the ATTS. The percentage is the animals who passed the temperament test and N is the number of animals tested. [https://atts.org/](https://atts.org/)

AMERICAN STAFFORDSHIRE TERRIER 85.5% (N=743)

Based on these data, it seems the dogs most people perceive as not being aggressive or behaving poorly with other dogs score the same or worse than dogs who are ""bred to be more aggressive"". Depending on how you calculate, there's no real difference between corgis and dobermans. The ATTS concludes that dogs' temperaments are largely predetermined and it lies with the caregiver to offer patient and consistent guidance for what we'd consider ""good manners""."

>ATTS tested 804 American Pit Bull Terriers from 2010-2011. Of these 804, 695 passed the temperament test with flying colors. This means that 86.4% of the pits tested had a good temperament. In fact, many of America’s “favorite” dog breeds scored significantly lower than pits. With Golden Retrievers coming in at 84.9%, Chihuahuas at 71%, and Yorkshire Terriers at 82.5%."

Some people who dock tails and crop ears are doing it for the aesthetic without looking into what they are actually doing (ex: doberman pinschers). They might not understand how to properly train dogs. Leading to more instances of dog fights

Or there are those special class of people who do it for dog fighting and should never be around dogs in the first place. This also increases the incidences of dog fights.

My point is...there’s a lot of reasons (confounding variables) for a dog to get into fights. Just not quite sure if docking tails are actually the source of the problem. 

That being said, I don’t agree with docking tails or cropping ears. Unless, there are medical reasons or it is a working dog that needs it for some particular purpose. And I most definitely don’t agree with doing it for aesthetic purposes or dog fights (seriously wtf is wrong with you)."

He genuinely believed that buying an expensive animal would guarantee good manners and hadn't considered the time and effort required for conditioning desired responses to stimuli. TL;DR. It would be an interesting study.

black_dead_spider,fe1nsy3,t1_fe1a26e,"I know my brothers dog who is 10 should have his tail docked as per the vets instructions, but his age and heart stop this operation. His a Tibetan Spaniel who has such a tight curl in his tail it folds up and touches his back quiet hard on his back so when he walks his tail wiggles like a normal dog does and it causes the fur to go missing and then the poor fella gets rashes just under this tail to spine skin area. So summer isn’t fun for him and we live in Australia.

If medically needed then that’s the only good reason."
miranda4jpg,fe2n575,t1_fe1nsy3,"It's also for working dogs. Hunting dogs can have their tails tangled and knocked about. Farms dogs would be more likely to have injuries because a tail could get stepped on by the flock (pick your animal for the flock). There are many other reasons. For pure looks though, would not be a good enough reason.

My last dog was a working dog mix. His tail was as long as his spine, and thick. It hurt his back because he would wag it so hard his rear would lift up of the ground and twist his spine.

My family had hard views on docking it. We thought that it wouldn't have been fair to him. If we had listened more to our vet, and done more proper research then maybe we would have been able to prevent his back pain. Possibly docking it 1/3 of the way would have lowered the swing in his tail. He was a happy dog regardless, but I feel we could have been better guardians for him in that area."

JeffGodOBiscuits,fdy3wwk,t1_fdxy9sc,"I'm South African so grew up with how they're referred to. I don't have a source other than that. It's basically dependent on the size of the antelope. Smaller antelope will be rams, ewes and lambs while larger antelope are referred to as bulls, cows and calves.

I have never heard an antelope referred to as a buck in reference to gender, though some people will call smaller antelope bucks, probably as a carry-over of them being called ""bok"" in Afrikaans."

Sloths are all about energy conservation, and as a result, they move super slowly, and have very little muscle mass. And as a result, they don't have any of the muscles that you or I would typically have that move our eyes to help us see a wider field of vision. Instead, their entire head moves.

https://phys.org/news/2016-09-mystery-teeth.html

As this article suggests, there could be a variety of reasons why leaves will have teeth on them. To protect against herbivory, could be one reason, another could be to help the leaf curl inward and keep the underside (where the holes of the stomata are) cool. The teeth could also displace heat, where as a leaf with more surface area would hold on to more heat. 

>Are any other oaks spiny?

Yes, scrub oaks, *Quercus berberidifolia*

https://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-taxon=Quercus+berberidifolia

Compare with *Quercus agrifolia* or the coast live oak I have in the post:

https://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-calrecnum=6983

Both oaks come from a similar lineage, but they have different growth form. Most coast live oaks are tree like (some are pygmy trees, like that of the Elfin Forests outside San Diego), and most scrub oaks are shrub like and commonly dot the chaparral ecosystem. Both of these plants are said to be evergreen, as they don't lose their leaves, and keep them all year round. The plant in my post has had its leaves burnt in a wildfire, which is why they are not green. Otherwise, these oaks only lose their leaves when they get infected by a pest or the tree outgrows the leaves, not because of seasonal change.

These leaves are hard, spikey, and coated in a thick cuticle. This sort of leave morphology is very common in Mediterranean ecosystems. Southwestern Australia, South Africa, parts of South America, and southern California all share this rare ecosystem of mostly shrub dominated hills where cold ocean currents brush against a hot climate. This creates long hot summers and wet winters, but mild compared to that of a desert, and dryer than that of a forest. One adaptation to this sort of climate is have Sclerophyllous leaves.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerophyll

>Are they one of the species that need fire to reproduce? If not how do they keep their seeds from getting burned?

Oak trees have traits that allow them to survive wildfires, but too frequent of wildfires can be harmful to populations. Include drought, bark beetle attack (native and non native insects), and man made climate change, and oak trees are under a lot of pressure for survival. The most important members of the population are the adults. Adult oak trees will create hundreds of thousands of acorns, sometimes in large events all at once called Masting Events (in order to overwhelm seed predators), every few years or so. Most of those acorns will never become trees. In fact, so few acorns will grow even in to a sapling. Fires usually wipe out juveniles, and adults are the only ones able to withstand most fires. Competition and disease keep sapling and juvenile tree numbers very low, especially if they grow closer to their parents. Dispersal is the key to survival. But who disperses acorns? Scrub jays.

https://oaks.cnr.berkeley.edu/jays-plant-acorns/

Scrub jays will fly acorns to new areas and cache them in the ground and under rocks, etc. This helps oak trees expand in to new habitat. There is obvious risk in this, as jays will certainly eat many of the acorns, and they don't always bury the acorns in the most suitable habitat. What they do do right though is burying the acorns away from the competition and disease of other oak trees, increasing their chance for a successful dispersion. No fire needed for oak trees, just suitable habitat for both scrub jays and the trees themselves."

**Squid and octopus can edit and direct their own brain genes**

LIFE 6 April 2017
By New Scientist staff and Press Association

Octopuses seem to have special gene editing powers
Tom Kleindinst/PA Wire

Unlike other animals, cephalopods – the family that includes octopuses, squid and cuttlefish – do not obey the commands of their DNA to the letter.

Instead, they sometimes interfere with the code as it is being carried by a molecular “messenger”. This has the effect of diversifying the proteins their cells can produce, leading to some interesting variations.

The system may have produced a special kind of evolution based on RNA editing rather than DNA mutations and could be responsible for the complex behaviour and high intelligence seen in cephalopods, some scientists believe.

RNA, a close cousin of DNA, is used to transfer software-like instructions from the genes to protein-making machinery in cells.

Scientists discovered that more than 60 per cent of RNA transcripts in the squid brain are re-coded by editing. In other animals, ranging from fruit flies to humans, such re-coding events only occur a fraction of 1 per cent of the time.

Similar high levels of RNA editing were identified in three other “smart” cephalopod species, two octopuses and one cuttlefish.

The mechanics of cephalopod RNA editing are still being investigated.

“When do they turn it on, and under what environmental influences? It could be something as simple as temperature changes or as complicated as experience, a form of memory,” says Joshua Rosenthal, lead author from the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, US.

**Octopuses and other cephalopods have a number of characteristics that have caused experts to compare them with aliens, including instantaneous colour-changing camouflage, blue blood, and an ability to see polarised light.**

Studying the creativity and intelligence of the octopus


It's one of the most bizarre creatures on Earth, and not just because it looks so different. The octopus can camouflage itself in a flash; squeeze its entire body through a one-inch hole; and their brains?  That's right, an octopus has one large central brain, and eight mini-brains, one in each arm.

""Octopuses are so brilliant,"" said author and naturalist Sy Montgomery, who believes their intelligence is almost off the charts.

""We give 'em the same toys to play with that we give our children,"" Montgomery said. ""They love to play. Play is one of those characteristics of higher minds.""

Rudy, a giant Pacific octopus, and one of the stars of the New England Aquarium in Boston, seemed to want to play with us.  

Correspondent Chip Reid said, ""Some people go, 'Eeeww, that's creepy.' You go …?""

""I say, this is one of the most beautiful creatures on this planet, one of the smartest, one of the most interesting, and one of the most alien,"" Montgomery replied.

""In fact, they're portrayed in movies as aliens,"" said Reid.

""That's right, and as monsters.""

Yes, Hollywood octopuses have torn down the Golden Gate Bridge, destroyed ships, and feasted on movie stars. Montgomery says it's unfair to demonize them: ""You would really have to go to outer space to come up with someone more different from us than this. Their mouths are in their armpits; they have three hearts; they have blue blood. And the grace? I mean, who has grace like this?""

Montgomery spent countless hours studying these other-worldly beings while writing her book, ""The Soul of an Octopus.""  

the-soul-of-an-octopus-simon-and-schuster-244.jpg 
 SIMON & SCHUSTER
Reid asked, ""Do you believe the octopus has a soul?""

""I believe if I've got a soul, this octopus has a soul,"" she replied.

And that, she claims, is not the only thing they have in common with humans.  

""When I met an octopus for the first time, I was so struck by the fact that she was just as curious about me as I was about her,"" Montgomery said.

Reid went behind the scenes to see for himself, with the help of senior aquarium biologist Bill Murphy. It turns out that calling an octopus curious is an understatement.

""Ahhh, she's more interested in you than the food!"" said Murphy. 

""That's scary,"" Reid replied. .

It was as if she wanted Reid to join her in her octopus' garden. ""She is powerful,"" he said. 

""Yeah, you feel the pull in the muscle?""

A big part of Murphy's job is keeping Rudy from getting bored. ""Because they're so smart, we try and keep them mentally stimulated,"" he said. ""And interactions like this help with that, 'cause they're figuring us out and who we are and what we're doing.""

chip-reid-shakes-hands-with-an-octopus-promo.jpg

There are about 300 species of octopus, but the giant Pacific octopus is the largest, averaging 16 feet in length, and 110 pounds. It's also the longest-lived octopus; even so, its life span is only about three to five years.

""They have such personalities,"" Murphy said. ""Each octopus is different. So, when you work this closely with them and you're interacting with them on a regular basis, you build a relationship with them.""

""That's gotta be difficult that they live such short lives,"" said Reid.

""It is. It is. It's very difficult. But you enjoy the time you have.""

To learn more, Reid headed down to Cape Cod where he met Bret Grasse of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.  He's responsible for the care and feeding of the lab's octopuses, and stocks up on their favorite food: tiny grass shrimp.

Next stop: the beach for another octopus delicacy – crabs.

Back at the lab, the day was about to get a lot better for a small California two-spot octopus – and a lot worse for one of those crabs.

Of all the octopus' oddities, perhaps the most extraordinary is its talent for disguise. The octopus changes its shape, colors, patterns, even the texture of its skin, to look like seaweed, and does it in the blink of an eye. It's called dynamic camouflage.  

octopus-camouflage-roger-hanlon-620.jpg 
Now you see him, now you don't: An octopus camouflages itself in the blink of an eye.  ROGER HANLON
""I would argue that dynamic camouflage is a form of intelligence,"" said Roger Hanlon, senior scientist and a top octopus researcher at the Marine Biological Laboratory, who recently gave a TED Talk on octopus intelligence that went viral:


Reid met him at the lab in Woods Hole, where he helped us understand what that means. 

""It doesn't just happen instinctively; they actually think and decide how to camouflage themselves?"" Reid asked.

""That's right. This is not a reflex; this is a decision-making process,"" Hanlon said. ""They're taking into account the [surroundings] for camouflage, but also an approaching threat. And they're calculating all along about what they're going to do next.""

As a scientist, Hanlon is skeptical about attributing human-like emotions to the octopus, or comparing their level of intelligence to ours.  But he says they are stunningly creative.

He said, ""This is a complex animal. It's making decisions all the time. That takes a big brain.""

A big brain in a unique and mysterious creature that scientists are only beginning to understand.
