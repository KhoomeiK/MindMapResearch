FerrisTheCrab,enrs4c,top_level,"I think I may have depression, but I find it so hard to talk about, because every time I try I feel like I am just making something out of nothing. I can write out 5 messages to a friend but never send them because everything I write feels like a lie.

I managed to initiate a conversation with a friend about it just now, then immediately had to back out of it because everything i wanted to say felt like I was simply seeking attention or somehow trying to trick them. They were so supportive but I shut it down. Now I feel even more like I am just being melodramatic or attention seeking."

It's like I can't think of my feelings as anything but performances to elicit reactions, even if I barely ever even do that because I repress how I feel so much. Even when I'm feeling bad by myself I sometimes get into this negative-feedback loop where I tell myself I'm 'rehearsing' my feelings to use for later. That sounds really stupid but for some reason I can't accept that it's okay for me to feel bad."

Ive been trying to get as many people to read this document i wrote so i could get as much advice and perspectives as possible every time i talk about it or mention it i feel like im being extremely annoying and make my friends uncomfortable. ive only had 1 friend legitmately talk to me about it but now its just become a one way conversation i think, making me feel even more guilty about something i *know is the right thing to do.* im starting to think, maybe i should be attention seeking, right? if we're struggling and hurting, why would we back away from others when seeking attention is literally the best way to get help? theres a reason why doctors say talking to others is the best thing you can do, i think that if we feel like we're being melodramatic, its to gain more attention to be able get more help. when we break our arm, our first reaction is to yell out in pain, isnt that attracting attention to yourself?

so with that, lemmie just seek some attention [right quick](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YQTaOtmaJswbUZSRETFn2VqmBh5vewVDte3X9GVQFZc/edit?usp=sharing), and if you're down, from one depresso to another, you can send me your stuff."

I hope you find the insight and shared understanding that you're looking for.

Edit: I should expand on this, because I don't want you to feel like you're not valued. I suffer from severe ME/CFS, which causes extreme fatigue and brain fog. Reading 9 pages takes a hugely disproportionate amount of my daily concentration and energy. I literally can't do it. I'm sorry."

SuperbFlight,fe6rina,t1_fe4ctbd,"> when we break our arm, our first reaction is to yell out in pain, isnt that attracting attention to yourself?

Hell yes! Emotional pain registers in the brain the same as physical pain. There was a study where they imaged people's brains when they were physically hurt and also when they were shown a picture of a very recent ex, and the two pains had the same brain activity. All that to say that I think your instinct is right, that that's actually one of the main purposes of crying. Crying signals to others that we're hurt, physically or emotionally, and need help and/or support. We are a highly social species to the point where humans in the past who didn't live in a group were way more likely to die, so we've evolved all kinds of things that enhance social bonding, or are a result of us needing to be highly social to survive. So I think you're dead on, calling attention to yourself when you're in extreme emotional pain is a highly adaptive and helpful action.

I'm sorry to hear you've had bad experiences opening up. I'm really sad that our culture doesn't value emotional intimacy and openness. I think it is hugely detrimental for humans since social connection is an actual need of ours. I actually think the root of that is our current economic system which treats humans as valuable only for what we produce and consume, not our inherent worth as people. 

It is valid and natural to want to talk to someone about feeling so crappy and to receive empathy and support. I want to offer that there *are* people out there who would be receptive and want to talk about that. It can be hard to find them unfortunately. But know that it is not wrong at all to want that.

>  thing is my overwhelming feeling of inadequacy. I'm not good at anything.

Dude, writing that document took a LOT of skill! From a total outsider's perspective, you have fantastic skills of self-awareness, ability to link your experience to other portrayed experiences, and describing your internal states. Those are not insignificant skills. Unfortunately, our highly capitalistic society doesn't always value those specific skills, but I definitely think you deserve to feel proud of them.

> Another bullet point I should cover at this point is my lack of motivation. This is the thing I understand the fucking least

I can really relate to this. I felt really similarly in the past. It's taken years to feel more motivation and I'm happy that it's much better now. The key things for me were: grieving my childhood abuse and neglect, developing self compassion for myself in any difficult situation, getting diagnosed and medicated for ADHD, building a good social network with good supportive friends, and the biggest thing: I grew up with highly authoritarian parents where they wrote the law of what was good and what was bad, and they crushed my natural childhood need for autonomy, so I developed a *highly* critical internal voice and many many ""shoulds"", which completely detached me from my natural internal motivation in life. I've worked a lot on ignoring the shoulds, validating that my need for autonomy and independence is natural and valid, and tuning into what I actually enjoy, want, and need. That's been absolutely critical.

> Besides, society views depression as “not that bad”, ""just get over it"", and there's this whole stigma about it that paints it in such a bad light.

FUCK. THOSE. PEOPLE. Seriously. People who say that clearly do not understand depression, and therefore their opinions are irrelevant. It's like people saying ""you have cancer? well just use this crystal and think happy thoughts and that'll cure it. It's not that bad, just get over it."" It's utterly ridiculous. I try to ignore those people now. 

> Something I completely forgot is that I have diagnosed ADHD. You can easily put this puzzle piece in yourself, I get distracted from something I’m supposed to be paying attention to really easily. Doesn’t help my lack of motivation at all, nor my self-esteem.

Me too! I used to beat up on myself so much for not being able to focus, for not being able to just *do stuff*. My diagnosis helped me accept my brain as it is and work *with* it. Medication also MASSIVELY helps me. Like miraculously so.

> would assume at this point you’d say “what the fuck are you doing, go get help”, but all I see coming out of that is making the problem worse, or just delaying the inevitable.

You might already know this, but this is illogical. It is definitely not the only outcome. It's one possible outcome, yes. Another possible outcome is the help helping. There *are* many cases where getting help has led to tangible improvements in people's mental health. Including me!

> They have valid reasons to be unhappy and depressed, broken marriage, unable to pick themselves up economically, parents treating them like human trash. I have none. And somehow, the fact that I have none makes me feel worse, because my emotions and situation is completely unjustified. 

In my opinion, this may be the key root of your mental health issues. No emotions are EVER unjustified. Ever. Emotions have evolved as extremely powerful and useful tools for navigating life and social situations. We wouldn't have them if they weren't useful. Every emotion arises in response to something. At their core, emotions are a way to motivate us to address things. Fear motivates us to acknowledge that we are in danger and to figure out how to get to safety. Sadness helps us process loss and realize what is actually important to us and gets us in touch with our self and body. Anger helps us recognize injustice or motivates us to set better boundaries to improve our well-being. Etc. I have found that my thoughts that have been similar to what you wrote here are actually one of the key factors in my depression, if not the most key. Because it is *so* invalidating and demoralizing. To tell yourself that you have no right to suffer, when you are clearly suffering, provokes hopelessness. I want to tell you about what I learned from Self-Compassion (a book by Kristen Neff): if you are suffering, it doesn't matter why, then you are suffering, and all humans deserve compassion when we suffer. Because to suffer is to be in pain. If you're in pain, thinking the reason why you're in pain is illogical or invalid doesn't change the fact that you're in pain. It'd be like someone driving over your foot and saying ""well it's not actually that bad because my car's pretty light relative to other cars, and you know people have had heavier things fall on their foot so it's not that bad"" -- does and of that change the fact that your foot fucking hurts? No. Those things might be true but ""it's not that bad"" can only ever be determined by the person who is in pain, because pain is a 100% internal experience, meaning that no one else can ever actually *know* how much pain you are in. You are the only one who can ever know that because no one else has access to all of your experience.

> They’ll poke harmless fun at me “Guys look! It’s a Cole sighting!” It’s become a consistent joke that I’m always upstairs either on my computer or in my room. I know it shouldn’t, but it kinda fuckin hurts.

Fuck shoulds. Does it hurt? Then it hurts. I'm guessing from your document, and this specific situation, that your parents are highly invalidating of your emotions, or at least emotionally neglectful. And you know what? That is really fucking harmful for healthy emotional development. Children have legitimate emotional needs and if they aren't met, then conditions like depression happen. If this resonates at all, look up Running On Empty by Jonice Webb, or even the website Peaceful Parenting for how parents *should* meet children's emotional needs to promote healthy development. I don't want to read too much into what you wrote or project my own experience, so of course please ignore what I write if it doesn't fit. 

In my own experience, regardless of when I knew my thoughts were illogical and countered them (which it sounds like you are doing to some degree), it was impossible to feel much better *until* I started addressing the actual root wounds, which for me were childhood and other relational trauma (neglect, minor physical abuse, intense verbal and emotional abuse, and adult sexual abuse). The deep wounds result in all these symptoms like illogical unhelpful thoughts, awful feelings, etc, and I've found that while addressing the symptoms does help, addressing the wound *causing* the symptoms is critical, especially for lasting changes. 

If what I wrote about parental neglect and invalidation resonates, I strongly suggest looking into those, because they ARE deeply impactful. I've made intense improvement from seeing a counselor who specializes in trauma, and that's been absolutely key (I saw a counselor for CBT which addressed symptoms but I needed to address the roots).

And I'm happy to talk more about any of this :) I'm really sorry to hear how much you're suffering. I feel a lot of compassion for your pain. I hope that you can get more peace and compassion and support."
lybbx,fe5vao2,t1_fe4ctbd,"I read that entire thing, and its so damn relatable... crikey"
Devilsknock,fec89cv,t1_fe4ctbd,"You definitely aren’t alone man. Your story resonates with me pretty heavily as it sounds like pretty much my entire middle-school through high school experience. I don’t know if I can really give that great of advice as I thought I got over it but now it just kind of hits me randomly and throws me into near manic depressive states. I’m 22 now btw, tried college but ended up failing out which just made more depressed so I just told people I dropped out. Can’t honestly say much has changed for me since high school. I guess getting out of the school environment made me less depressed in general but I think my main issue is jealousy for what others have. I see people being happy with loads of friends/SO/etc and that will normally set off one of those depressive states from earlier that I mentioned. Funny cause it’s so easy to talk about this behind anonymity but very few if any people that know me know that I feel this way.

Your latest edit is also pretty interesting to me, during high school, I found a decent way to numb the pain was seeing the suffering of others. I don’t think I would recommend trying that route, I half went into homicidal thoughts there instead of just suicidal. I did manage to avoid those though and now I’m pretty fucking apathetic from that whole time of doing that up until I get another breakdown again and have to coax myself into not blowing my head open. Hell, my grandma that I used to visit all the time as a child died and when face to face with her corpse, I felt absolutely nothing. Felt awkward as hell since everybody else was crying.

All in all man, I’m not sure what to tell you except that there are other people suffering through the same thing and my experience was almost the same as yours. I suppose my life did get better out of school in general but it’s still a far cry from a “happy ending”. I want what others have but I feel I’ve made myself so apathetic and uncaring that it is something I can never get.

Isolating myself is generally what seems to work the best for me but that comes with it’s own issues.

Edit: I guess to elaborate more on the jealously part, it's not exactly social contact necessarily, more that they have an actual reason to get up and keep going with their life. Most people I think tend to go through some form of depression or at least sadness but I feel most have something that they look forward to in life. I don't. I'm sure someday I'll just end up another statistic to the silent killer known as depression while most people that knew me get to say the classic line of ""well, he was joking and seemed happy most the time, who would have known he would have killed himself""."

Then I know I can ask them if I’m blowing things out of proportion or talk to them about anything and they have that context. I know it’s hard, but I have never had someone respond negatively to this. They are usually very supportive. 

I still have issues with it sometimes, but it makes it easier and sometimes, you just have to say fuck it and hit send and value your mental well-being over the effect sharing might have. I hope this helps."

I just feel completely worthless and think so little of myself overall that anyone listening to me and treating me kindly is, in my head, just pandering to my whiny bullshit.

BackToSquare1comics,fe5uwkx,t3_enrs4c,"I feel that all the time. Sometimes you do have real issues but depression makes them a million times worse. that's why when u explain it it sounds like it's not bad but in reality you are incapable of dealing with it. 

To prove it to myself I always remind myself that I have no sex drive and no desire to eat. That usually proves it to me."

TA420-69,fe5yb6k,t3_enrs4c,"All the time. Even then though, nobody listens to anything I have to say so I just keep everything to myself.

They tell me it's unhealthy to do that, but what else can I do when nobody will listen?

Sometimes I get in a good mood though and it feels like my depression was really all just attention seeking. But then I get depressed again and fall back into the bad habits."

I do it often actually asking out loud ""Am I bothering you/ am I interrupting something? "" they say I'm not.....but my mind tells they are just lying to not hurt me....I dunno."

I wish my family could feel how I do for one day, I mean not even a day, just a few hours and let me kick them around and call them names. But at times I think they’re right - maybe I am being a drama queen and lost control of it and tricked myself?

kash62,fe623pa,t3_enrs4c,"Today I tried opening up to my mom about my mental health problems and immediately I stopped myself for this same reason. I felt like if I did tell her it would be exaggerating things just to make her feel bad for me, or as an excuse for how I’ve been acting. Shits hard."

Nairinn,fe62irn,t3_enrs4c,"Yeah, I always feel like people may perceive me as wanting attention whenever the conversation leads this way. And I feel bad talking about it because other people may be going thru the same shit or worse and they're keeping quiet about it so I feel like I should too. It kinda sucks but I feel like it's part of growing up."
Wolf92xd,fe630gv,t3_enrs4c,"I've always had the thought that feeling that is actually something normal, I mean, at the end of the day you're sharing an actually serious personal issue, not just the usual nonsense and superficial things you commonly talk about with your friends. And you need to consider that fact. You yourself realizing you're not fully mentally sane and facing that fact is hard enough, let alone opening up about it to someone else.

It has happened to me (more often than not actually) that I shared my problems and overall feelings of sadness with friends or even closer people like my family, and I ended up feeling like I was some sort of burden. Even though they always listened to me and gave good me advice, I had an inner sensation of guilt and thought deep inside me that I was bothering them.

Opening up to someone is not easy. You will most likely always feel that what you're doing is somehow wrong, and you'll have that inner guilt even if it is far from reality. That's just how the mind works when it's clouded with depression and problems of that kind; you start making up false things and actually believing them, but I think that is mainly caused by insecurity.

And as you may know, one of the biggest problems of being insecure is you tend to overthinking literally everything, even if it's the simplest of things. You just need to try and face those thoughts of being a burden or acting as if you were melodramatic, and go on and sharing what you feel. Especially if it is affecting you in any harmful way.

Mental health might be overlooked by the majority of people in our current society, and that is just sickening. But that doesn't mean you have to be part of it. Give these topics the importance they deserve, and more specifically give it to yourself. You've probably heard that dozens of times, but that is only because it is true.

I would like to clarify that I'm no expert, and I've obviously had and still have my inner struggles. But I know my fair amount of information and I wanted to speak up on this because it was a strong opinion I had since a long time ago. I hope this long paragraph, analysis-type of thing could help you out, and maybe encourage you not to be afraid anymore. Remember: Taking care of your mental health is also taking care of you, don't let any false ideas prevent you from doing so. You matter."

I'm sorry on behalf of all of us who say the wrong thing. And be honest when we say something that hurts you. We don't know how you're taking it and we never want you to feel like that.

I am doing better at accepting these internally, but I still struggle with wanting to talk to anyone about it. I feel like I can't speak my truth all the time, because I don't want to bring others down. But that leaves me with nothing to talk about, and I feel incredibly boring to others."

""Are you alright?"" ""Do you need anything?"" ""Don't worry, I am here for you.""

What's even the point. You already know that it's gonna happen. How dare I feel good about getting support when I say things in such a way that it will happen?

BenIsProbablyAngry,fe8bgcw,t3_enrs4c,"You think you're worrying about your own motives, but what you're actually worrying about is how other people see you. A huge percentage of depressed people fell into the state because they began a pattern of comparing themselves to others, and their depression is a manifestation of an inferiority complex they developed as a result.

You think that you are worried you are lying, but in actuality you are worried the person will think you are lying or being melodramatic. There's a branch of psychology called individual psychology that has much to say about this; you are taking on what that branch of psychology considers ""the other person's life task"". Your life task is merely to let your friends know what is going on, and it is their life task to react to that in whatever way they deem appropriate. Right now, you are trying to control their reaction by not presenting them information, which is you trying to control their reaction to manage their opinion of you.

You may experience significant relief by recognising that you are worrying about something you do not control (how a person reacts to the truth), and simply recognising that you cannot control it."
BirEkmek,fe8bmj1,t3_enrs4c,"This happened to me a lot as well. Been taking antidepressants for a month and a half now and I am starting to see the light out of the tunnel. I would recommend the thing I did at first: step away from social media, and if you feel like talking about your problems to a friend, ask them out or tell them to visit you. The crave for connection does feel awful when your mind is constantly sabotaging you. But know that asking for help and showing your vulnerability is actually a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes a lot of courage to admit that you need help and that you are scared, because trust me, most of us human beings feel that way.  And the minute you open yourself to others great things start to happen. I am sure there are friends out there who want to help you because they genuinely care about you, just give them the opportunity, go for a coffee, let this moment pass, let all moments go. You are not your mind, you are not your actions, you are not your emotions or words, you are the consciousness that is observing your life unfold, the voice in your head that never stops, observe that voice, rise above it, take it easy on yourself, you got this :)"

QTAry,fe8j8ec,t3_enrs4c,"Absolutely. Especially because I convinced myself that my problems are a result of my own doing. I physically can’t even mutter the words out because I feel like I’m just looking for sympathy. 

It’s crazy because it’s what I want as well, I want someone to feel bad for me. But me realizing that I realize that made me realize that talking of my issues is just my own show. Again, because I convinced myself that my problems are my own doing. 

I even laugh at myself whenever I cry because of how ridiculous I see myself, and realizing that is super weird because lots of people can’t explain their problems or articulate them too well. But not me, I know where my problem stems from, down to my experiences in childhood; and that realization makes me feel like I’m just making everything up. Almost like I enjoy being depressed and enjoy shutting myself out and having anxiety attacks where I laugh and cry at the same time.

5. People aren't necessarily great at understanding human emotions, so you might need to try with another person.
6. If one juges you for that, you know that person isn't really there for you.

You're not lying or melodramatic.. You just want to feel better."
QTAry,fe8lb9f,t3_enrs4c,"I also use this justification to convince myself it’s okay to cry. 

Imagine a child; that ahold would cry if they dropped their candy and couldn’t eat it anymore. Because that candy was their world at the moment. It means as much to them, as maybe our phones to us, or our keys for example. 

So even though to everyone else, a kid dropping their candy is super minuscule and something not to cry about, it doesn’t matter because everyone sees everything differently. 

To someone, losing a loved one isn’t such a big of a deal. To another it could mean the world. 

Someone wouldn’t care if they get cheated on, but another would probably commit double homicide and suicide, 

To one person, being sad about losing an emotionally valuable autographed baseball is something to cry over; to another it doesn’t mean anything.

It’s all perspective, and we all have our own which is why we shouldn’t see anyone’s problems bigger than another’s because their world is different. 

So at the end of the day, no matter how strongly you feel about how ‘dumb’ your issue might be; it isn’t, simply because it means something to YOU, so it’s important."

However one benefit of having this shit for years is that I can better identify when I'm having a bad/shit day and 1) cope better or at least escape from the ppl I love so I don't act like a cunt with them 2) ride the wave with an assortment of techniques that I picked up over the years ( sleep = #1) 3) exercise my ass off even every fiber of my being resists it 4) up my meds. 

Also there is a physical school of thought that says that depression is related to your gut. I believe this. And believe me kombucha is like a miracle cure in this regard."

Theres people starving to death, being raped, or even just raising kids and dealing with family stuff and i am a 36 year old privileged financially independent person with my own house and friends and yet my mental health is so fucking shitty i just feel like im a depressing life sucking friend who always needs attention. Im lucky that one friend in particular has similar issues but deals better than me and honestly if it wasnt for her i wouldn't be here. Just knowing that you have one person who truly gets it and who will always return a call means a lot. But in terms of other people and my boyfriend i do feel like an attention seeking narcissist. But the way my head is it just takes over absolutely everything all the time. The meds have side effects, i spent 18 months with uncontrollable diarrhea as a result of 3 different ssris. To the point where i was sent for a colonoscopy because it was so bad. My gp wont give me more than a month at a time of meds so i feel like a hypochondriac always ringing up for prescriptions or check in appointments just to be able to get my meds. Its just never ending and im my bad periods i do think its not worth it if my lifes always going to have such massive lows when a bout hits.

And when I do manage to type out a novel of why I feel shitty, I immediately feel bad for saying it all when it’s all said and done. On top of all of that, I feel guilty for my depression because I don’t feel like I “deserve” to be depressed, if that makes sense. I don’t necessarily have a bad life, like at all. There are certain aspects that I’m very unhappy with, but generally speaking my day to day living is mostly comfortable. Sometimes I feel shitty for no reason, or at least it feels like no reason. I have a lot going through my head and certain things tend to make me feel worse than others but I feel afraid that my friends and loved ones wouldn’t understand why I feel depressed. It’s weird. Like I feel like I have some valid reasons to feel the way I do but as a whole it feels like I shouldn’t be depressed. I know it’s irrational, but I just feel like no one would believe me or just say I’m overreacting. So yeah, I am with you on that one. It really sucks"

It doesn't get easier. I'm just dealing & living with it. I still get moments where I want to fall into relapse & have to struggle not to hurt myself. I don't take medication since when I was on antidepressants it repressed my appetite & I would go two or three days without eating. 

I have breakdowns where it feels like the world fell apart & every kind word is like a knife. I want to tell them how I truly feel & want, but suppress myself as to not bother them with my problems. 

It isn't the same for everyone & yours may be more or less severe. It is important to tell someone about your problems, because it fills & bottles up inside, till it's too much & overflows. Every little thing, could be the trigger."

I could be slow at work and my coworkers wouldn't think I'm lazy. They'd understand the physical toll cancer inflicts. 

People would rally around me. I could post about my journey on Facebook without shame.

Note that I'm not talking about the energy to find a  way, there are many easy ways, I'm talking about the energy to overcome the aforemention survival istinct.

Evenkhen,fdqaugc,t3_emnl5m,"I think it's because psychiatry is not popularly considered a medical branch. It's hard to get an objective report on some conditions (apart from extreme ones). If you have cancer, you have MR pictures (or other test results which are repeatable and will always get the same outcome) and it's hard evidence which can't be disproved by another specialist. Psychiatric conditions are hard to prove in an undeniable way. That doesn't change the fact that social awareness is close to zero and people like us tend to get brushed off when it comes to moral support. No matter if you can prove it or not you do need help which many don't understand."
code_unknown_,fdqbdzb,t1_fdqaugc,"Look even medical imaging is not that cut and dry. Different modalities have pros and cons and scans can miss disease. I know your point though. I think unfortunately people experiencing depression might readily compare themselves with groups of people viewed as other, without realising that actually a lot of people have an incredibly shitty time with healthcare. Imagine having cancer but you can't get a diagnosis because they don't run the right test at the right time. Like there will be people who will be prescribed antidepressants before they get the right scan. By the time there is a diagnosis, the disease may be untreatable. If that isn't depressing as fuck, i dunno what is. 

I know precisely what you mean though which is that depression is a clinical diagnosis and not quantifiable. 

It's just that the grass isn't always greener where something can be quantified, and those tests are less straightforward than they might otherwise be. 

All in all, a long way to go, for all of us."
Evenkhen,fdqc5ev,t1_fdqbdzb,"You're right. I had an early stage cancer - taken care of in time so I didn't become a hairless skeleton, just functioned with huge doses of painkillers until I had the tumor surgically removed. I'm also not the type of person that would complain on physical pain in public. So even with the reports I was told at work that I'm probably not really ill because I don't complain. We have a collegue drama queen who cries on a papercut so when she had a tooth surgery she was given a 2 weeks leave because she looks soooo ill. With people like that around I gave up seeking support."
code_unknown_,fdqen2a,t1_fdqc5ev,"In terms of the response, I feel you. Honestly, I really do. And that response is exactly the kind of thing that wouldn't surprise me, unfortunately. Indifference is one of the frightening things about humanity.

However, I'm really, really glad they caught it in time. And i hope you are feeling a bit better now, if not entirely optimal. (A guess!)

I will say I'm quite sooky when i've got a hole in the tooth. There just isn't a sympathetic crowd to dramatically play to, though. I'd milk it if i could."

FairEnough_Lad,fdqs0hm,t3_emnl5m,"I understand your point but I wouldnt choice cancer, maybe another physical illness. After seeing my mum go through cancer, Id rather have mental illness, all the pain meds she was on and all the pain she went through made her wish for death. In the end she couldnt take anymore and was given a leathal dose of morphine. Even with cancer she struggled to get disability benifits despite not being able to do things for herself. She was a strong woman but cancer took that away from her. The endless doctors appiontments and A and E trips she took, Id sit with her 12hrs at a time whilst she got treatment. Cancers more than just chemo and a few treatments, its painful and most likely gives you depression. When I saw her die, I was relieved that it was all over and she could finaly have a good rest. Id choose mental illness over Cancer. Fuck cancer."
CrimsonPermAssurance,fdq7o6m,t3_emnl5m,"I definitely resonate with this comment. The cruel twist of fate is that I also take care of cancer patients. They are trying so hard to survive and I just want to throw in the towel.

My coworkers are all happily married or in some long term relationship, spending time with their happy families, organizing fundraising events for various cancer organizations in their free time, and general ""I'm a well adjusted, caring human"" activities. I couldn't handle working alongside these normal people so I changed roles, now working the phones, so I would interact with fewer people in person.

My job has been trying to be understanding in approving intermittent FMLA for 6 months and at Thanksgiving I lost it and was out for two weeks. I've burned thru several antidepressants in the last few months, some of which worked but I couldn't take the side effects. Also therapy, which I had never done before. I was going to throw in the towel on finding a second therapist when the first one I saw just kept trying to tell me that they have another provider who can help with sleep issues but their services aren't covered by insurance and our last session she kept nodding off. My second therapist I think can be credited with my continued existence. She is trained in numerous techniques and we regularly discuss if the approach we are using is effective. She uses evidence based practices with proven effectiveness, words that I swear healthcare providers live and die by. And she's sharp. I mean she's really paying attention; she'll comment on things and the incongruity between my words and body language.

I think, at the end of the day, you need to look at what is best for you. If you can find a good therapist, from hard core skeptic, it can be a godsend. (Even if you don't believe in that hocus pocus) And maybe you need a change. After 20 years in cancer care, I have no more to give. Now it's time for me to take, for me. I started looking for jobs that can utilize my current skills but remove my concentrated care or investment in individual patients. 

I know it's really hard, but I hope you will be allowed the time to care for yourself. I won't say hang in there because others are depending on you, but if you're in healthcare you are a compassionate person. Save some of that to use on yourself. Take it by force if need be."

Also qigong and yoga help a lot 

However, my boyfriend of a year and a half ghosted me the week before Christmas and I’m definitely in a struggle. I’ve been fucking up at work , showering twice a week, but I’m trying to hang in. Antidepressants don’t work for me unfortunately.

That aside, society is failing at recognizing and understanding mental health. If someone can take a sick day for a cold, then I should take one when I just can't talk to people. I work retail, so talking to customers and coworkers is pretty much mandatory. It drains your soul. I go out of my way to avoid customers and it's getting worse. 

People don't care if you look busy, wear headphones, or talk to yourself while working. They *still* fucking stop you for questions. Same goes for coworkers as well. I will be glued to my phone, giving off clear signs of ""don't fucking talk to me"" and they still want to chat, even with my headphones in.

This makes me not want to talk to them but then they get fucking mad when I do not. They even told me if I do not start talking to them that they will send me to a 30 day program where the people there will make me talk. So basically I am in a stressful situation too. They sometimes as well play as the victim too, for example they will use my birthday or some day where they gave me something or went somewhere that I wanted to go and use that against me. What is worse is that I tell them what they are doing wrong to me and hear what they are saying and guess what? They do not listen. They tell me I am wrong and say they do not treat me bad and keep yelling at me.. wish I never had fucked up and confusing parents like them.

blackygreen,fdru1gi,t3_emnl5m,I used to be terrified of driving because I was afraid I would intentionally drive myself off the road. Or imagine getting run over while crossing. Or imagine stabbing myself everytime i used a knife. Its better now but that feeling is scary.

sarahxfaithx,fdrx4wm,t3_emnl5m,"f17. My grandfather died of terminal pancreatic cancer, and now my mother has the same cancer, terminal. She also has lung cancer. I could lose her tomorrow, in a few weeks, a few months. I would not wish cancer on anyone, not myself, not my worst enemy. It is a slow, painful, sad death. I know mental illness is ruthless at times, and it can make you wish things on yourself, I’ve asked god to strike me down countless of times. I get  in the car and have to force myself not to swerve into a log truck. cancer is absolutely tragic. my mom doesn’t have a way out, she doesn’t have a choice in living or dying. at least mental health has the ability and the chance to improve. 

My mother was horribly depressed for nearly a decade. As a little girl I would hear her talking about taking her life to my dad, and I’d hear him say if she killed herself he would take his life too. however, she got better, and was able to quit taking antidepressants years ago.  though she knows what lies in the future, she is strong in the face of death. I know she is probably very scared and that hurts me, it hurts to see your mother cry. 

I’m saying this as a person whos dealt with suicidal thoughts everyday, severe anxiety disorder, and depression since I was young. Last year I dealt with voices and noises my head that weren’t there. I have traumatic nightmares and I wake up from them with panic attacks. I *still* would never want cancer. My family is also in SEVERE debt, $600k just for her pancreas, we haven’t treated the lung yet. it could run us over a million dollars. I feel even worse because I will be going to college and that costs a lot, too, and my parents want to help me with the fees going into freshman year. I’m not saying any of your feelings are invalid at all. I KNOW how unfair life can be. I’m just saying cancer sucks major fucking balls."
SpaceWhale88,fdshrpa,t1_fdrx4wm,I'm so sorry you have been through this. This objectivly sucks way more than depression. I added an edit to my post.

kissing_mermaids,fds908x,t1_fdrx4wm,"I'm kinda afraid that after spending a lifetime of being suicidal, life would be then like ""you wanted to die? Here you have cancer now, enjoy!"" and I would have no idea how to handle it. I'm sorry you're mom is going through this, I've lost my grandmother who was like a second mother to me due to cancer, I'm feeling you."
sarahxfaithx,fdskztc,t1_fdshrpa,"Wow I really appreciate the clarification, though you didn’t have to do that. I understand what you’re saying now, and I agree. Depression is rarely ever taken seriously. My parents never believed me when I told them I was depressed when I was 12. they never believed me when I told them I was going to try and take my life at that age, either. 

I was 16 when my mom finally realized what was going on. One night my mom said ‘the police are here for you’. Thought it was over pot lol. they had shown up at 10 pm asking me if I was planning to kill myself. someone from school overheard me and reported me. after that my mom asked if I was depressed and I was trying to kms and I just started screaming crying. She started crying too saying she was sorry she never noticed. It was a wake up call to say the least. Sadly, that isn’t the case for everyone. i was very fortunate my parents took notice, even though it took smth so obvious 

I don’t think they would’ve ever taken my mental health seriously if the cops never showed up"
sarahxfaithx,fdsb34z,t1_fds908x,"Thanks for the kindness. I feel the same. Been suicidal since I was 12. Sometimes I just bare with life cuz death is relatively probable. I’m 17 and I’ve had countless of close calls without even trying to die. It’s almost everyday now that I miraculously escape death. I’ve nearly drowned in the ocean twice but I still go in. Lol I can barely stay afloat in a pool but this summer I swam in the middle of the ocean without a life jacket. Swam to the beach from a boat, was exhausted. then when I got to the shore the boat let off a siren telling us to come back bc a shark was in the water. They had floated way out from where they let my friend and I off. If I had to swim 30 secs longer I would have drowned... 

An hour ago my heart was cramping, ribs felt like they were caving. My heart was only getting 50% blood flow because I consumed an ungodly much caffeine. Felt like I was on meth. My heart could have easily stopped today."
hootinanyyumyum,fdry44c,t3_emnl5m,"As a cancer survivor and someone who has suffered from clinical depression my whole life, I can say that I learned things about human nature through chemo, which Actually just made me hate people and life more in many ways. If I wouldn't have been in so much pain from the cancer, with a husband of 18 months, I would not have gotten treatment. I came out of it not being able to have kids and now my life is more fucked up than ever. 
Even with cancer, the time off and sympathy ends but you are still left with the battle scars of surviving cancer. 
So while I understand what you are saying because I've always struggled with depression, you don't want that shit either."
SpaceWhale88,fds22iu,t1_fdry44c,"I think I just want to not be so damned embarrassed for what I'm struggling with. People dont understand.

Every one gets sad and we still love life and function."
hootinanyyumyum,fduaut4,t1_fds22iu,That's why I just stopped telling people. They don't really give a shit. People who do not suffer from depression don't get it and never will so I just started telling people I had insomnia and tired so I wouldn't have to explain.

The mental illnesses have only gotten worse.

Sauron8,fdrmfhw,t3_emnl5m,"Beside the social stigma, what makes cancer better than depression IMHO is that with cancer you whether heal or die, in a relative short period of time, accountable in years, depending on the type of cancer. Until you have it you are perfectly fine, when you discover it is sometimes too late and you will die in a year, if you discover it earlier you can heal. What makes depression horrible is that is difficult to discover because people don't want to talk about it in the first place (social stigma) or is just misuderstood, so you have to account like many years of growing depression and when finally you fall into the major depression state, is like a torture for the rest of your life. Medication are horrible (I tried them), often ineffective and are addictive, you can live literally for decades with the symphtoms without either die or heal, in a torture limbo. As depression cause sadness, apathy, anhedonia, among the others, is a barrier to feel pleasure and in general a costant sorrow with no end, I cannot imagine a worst torture for a human being that is moreover aware of his situation."
Regatotse,fdrordq,t3_emnl5m,Ive had both.  Cancer is way scarier and treatment is horrible.  Depression requires more work but you can pull through with meds and lifestyle change.
SpaceWhale88,fdrufef,t1_fdrordq,"I guess it's not really that I want cancer, I just want no stigma. I get told I'm not working hard enough in therapy and I let myself get like this. I'm fat so depression is 100% my fault. People dont just suggest prayer and weight loss to those with cancer. 

I've been on so many meds and none are working. Been in therapy for 3 years. But people act like I enjoy being like this or that I'm not doing enough to get better. People who get chemo again and again are described as brave and strong. They dont get accused of not fighting hard enough. Depression sucks all motivation. I'm barely functioning. I'm literally doing the best I can even though its shit."

Even through all of this, I know I don't want to deal with cancer, but I'm jealous of my friend because though he suffers with depression now as i do, he has a chance to make it out. He could die from one disease or another.  I have cried until i couldn't anymore and passed out on the floor trying to make myself go against instincts and put the rope around my neck.

Simple-Value,fdvgbfx,t3_emnl5m,"I was just thinking this. Yesterday, I told someone that I was dealing with severe major depression and had been for years. I was told to just ""change your thinking"" and ""stop being so hard on yourself - that's where you're messing up."" I had to end the conversation there. I already feel like I'm not worth existing and that I already do everything wrong, and this person just added another thing that I'm doing wrong. Thank you!!!!! I was also told to not tell anyone else. Honestly, it doesn't need to be cancer, just something physical and visible that people would be more willing understand. Almost two years ago, it was discovered I had a brain tumor - it was successfully removed. People at work were more supportive and understanding. Now, I'm dealing with a very serious depressive episode and I'm being told to ""think positive"", ""be happy"", ""go volunteer, that will make you see how much better you have it"", ""just snap out of it"" on and on and on.... Now, if I had died due to the tumor, that would be more ""accepted"" than if I die from depression and suicide. I would be called a ""coward, selfish, weak."" People would say ""oh, I never knew. She never told anyone she was feeling like this."" When in all actuality, I had, people just didn't want to hear it.

Fuzzleton,fdrpuzm,t1_fdrd14q,"It's hard for me to hold people's ignorance against them. They are not being mean jerks in this thread, they are fantasizing about their pain having a reason, their constant struggle having a purpose. It's understandable. Fighting a disease sounds preferable to fighting yourself at all times. Their logic is 'I can get past cancer, but I can't stop being me'. And so logically to them, it seems preferable to have cancer.

They are obviously wrong. Cancer patients are prone to depression. Cancer patients suffer from fatigue, frailty, frequent illness, memory issues from chemo brain, loneliness, isolation, atrophied social skills, a life constantly dwelling on mortality. Cancer patients feel like a burden to their family. It's a similar mental and emotional battle, with the additional of much worse physical struggles.

Cancer isn't an alternative to depression. If you have depression while healthy, you're not going to have cancer 'instead', you'd have cancer as well. It's a pointless, ignorant and slightly hurtful fantasy. I know reading this thread made me feel invisible. Something that destroyed much of my life being idolized and craved by people is not pleasant. But I don't think they are jerks.

I am happy they do not understand. The fewer people who understand living with cancer, the better the world has gotten."

I still sometimes think about bleaching the absolute crap out of the bathroom, sterilizing it over the course of a few weeks, getting an air filter, and slicing them off in there, sometimes. (Yes, I've watched videos of an orchiectomy done, I've read the surgical procedure,  I've practiced my suturing & surgical knots, I've extracted some lidocaine from a topical gel, I bought a scalpel, some needles, and I've got a course of antibiotics for after...  I'm...  Kinda confident in my abilities, here.)

I probably already could, because they've shrunk, but the last time I tried was so uncomfortable for me that I never went back.  Delayed my transition for half a fucking decade because they kept popping out and falling down the inside of my leg.

I don't like them flopping around down there.  It feels... uhh...  I guess it feels okay, actually.

I would like to not hurt as badly if I get hit there.

I honestly feel betrayed by them.  They spent decades pumping me full of the wrong shit, giving me a fucking beard, big-ass shoulders, and ensuring every single service worker in the world called me ""sir"".  Even in a dress with a full face of makeup.  It's because of them I need to spend so much more damn time if I want to look good for an evening, or even just try to feel a little better for a bit.  Feeling a little better only lasts a day, too.  I'll have a shadow and sandpaper face in 24 hours. I hate them.  I hate them for making it so much fucking harder to not hate myself, not hate my body, and not hate life.  I'd probably still be depressed as fuck without them, but it would be easier."
CindyBunFrosted,fdukxfw,t1_fds86yy,"Any more questions? I'm feeling uhh...  idk, honest? Never actually put it in words with that level of clarity. Gonna probably print that post out and hand it to my therapist.  If that doesn't help, fucking nothing will. 😅"
kissing_mermaids,fduvwjt,t1_fdukxfw,"Ok, another question: how do you feel about your penis then? I'm a woman and if I woke up in a man's body, I would definitely feel weird, especially about my crotch, I'm not used to have organs hanging there. So I understand the problem with the testicles, but having a penis would bother me too (even if I didn't experience weird boners anymore after removing my balls)."
CindyBunFrosted,fdw9n27,t1_fduvwjt,"Eh...  It's pretty much just a big clitoris, medically speaking.  Got all the same bits.  I had the...  Privilege, let's say, of helping my ex through recovery from her vaginaplasty. Her psychological recovery was...  Rough.  I'm not sure I can go through it.

I don't think it would be worth the recovery period, the pain,  the risk of infection, and the risk of never having an orgasm again. That last one is up to 10%, depending on surgeon. My insurance won't cover a good surgeon, anyway. 

Also, I'd lose a source of income.  Nobody wants to watch a dickless trans girl diddle herself on webcam.  The dick is part of the draw, somehow, I guess."
FLdancer00,fdr8l0z,t3_emnl5m,"Brilliant. I never thought of it that way.

My mental health is in a downward spiral and I just need a few days off to get a therapist, get an evaluation so I can get meds, have a mental health day. But I can't do that because depression isn't ""valid"". And I'd I wouldn't get paid, I'd get into debt and be further depressed,

But if it was cancer? Of course I could take a day to see a doctor.

I 1000% wish I had cancer. At least then I know it would be over soon."
Claires-mom,fdrc0an,t3_emnl5m,"When my doctor’s nurse called me to tell me that I had diabetes, I told her that I would rather have cancer because with cancer, you’re either going to die or get better.  I feel the same way about my depression and anxiety.  I don’t actively plan suicide, but if something happens and I end up dying, I wouldn’t care.  I know it’s horrible, but I wish that all those people who say to just “pray away your depression”, go out and exercise, eat healthy, meditate, do yoga, and on and on, will someday experience depression."

alittlebitblue__,fdz740l,t3_emnl5m,"We’ll have to agree to disagree. Watched a family member deteriorate over several years to cancer and then watching them die in front of my eyes and wouldn’t wish that upon anyone. Wanting cancer instead of mental illness JUST because you are too self conscious to own that you have depression is actually fucked up. I will prolly receive a lot of hate for being so direct, but as a person who myself has had on and off major depressive episodes over the past year, that is not even comparable to having cancer. Crying all night, sleep all day or stay awake for days, big appetite or no appetite for weeks, pain in my whole body, a whole fuck ton of emotions and several months where I don’t feel shit and chronically suicidal is something I’d wish this person who passed away from cancer to go through instead of not being physically able to eat when they were very hungry and thirsty, throwing up all day, sleeping constantly, body aching as hell, 39 pills a day just to be able to somehow function 15% and directly dying without very painful and hard treatment is so fucking bullshit and I’m actually fucking pissed that this thread was recommended to me in my email because I’d prolly have a half decent night without reading this. At the same time I know how depression works and I don’t blame you for making such a little thought through comparison... My loved one hadn’t even energy to actually tell people what was going on with her so she couldn’t actually “just tell her work that she was going to be away to get chemo”. She sat and fucking worked on her fucking computer at the hospital while receiving her God damn chemo. You don’t directly die from depression. I haven’t received treatment for months and and I’m as alive as I don’t want to be, but you directly die from having cancer. I understand that maybe you are suicidal, but I feel like it’s almost glamorizing a deadly disease by saying that you’d rather want to have x instead of y that has ripped children away from their parents and ripped their parents away from their children."
SpaceWhale88,fe62181,t1_fdz740l,I never said I wanted cancer. I just want the attitudes toward depression to be as compassionate as they are for people suffer from cancer.
Marykirwan,fds47sq,t3_emnl5m,You just can't talk about it. It looks like some sort of melodramatic excuse.
Raph_1104,en7336,top_level,"its hard to explain but its a feeling of not wanting the pain but wanting it at the same time, i feel like depression is very comforting, even though its not supposed to be, can anyone give me ideas on what this is?"
JesusAndSoda,fdvpir4,t3_en7336,"If my experience is any indication, the things pushing you to better yourself are wanting to rid yourself of the pain, wanting to get stronger or more grounded to chase your goals, or to stop hurting anyone you hurt through the problems. Wanting to stay the same is a result of depression itself sabotaging your mental and physical efforts to change, not having an idea of who you want to be or what you want to do so you choose the devil you know (depression), and a desire for self-punishment."
Raph_1104,fdvqrxl,t1_fdvpir4,"thanks, tbh i have no goals or anything i want to do in the future and thats quite true tho the part where i desire self punishment, i relate with that a lot, because everyday i put myself down and lead myself to the dark tunnel or the deep hole because thats where i deserve to be"
kashiruvana,fdxepzz,t1_fdvpir4,"Yes, yes, yes. Depression is a parasite; it needs to keep the host from killing it by getting help. It will tell you anything it can to make sure you continue to be a good host environment."
Skynada,fdxmt79,t1_fdvpir4,"Wow made sense cos it is apart of it. The self destruction feeling like there’s no point. All part of depression and accepting that is giving into it, which is what you want don’t.

Also I’m glad that there’s people like you helping. You go on other subs like foreveralone and doesn’t help at all with your problems and that it’s everyone else’s fault not there’s and it sucks"
unqualifiedromantic,fdwv2r9,t1_fdvpir4,This is me. 100%
ManicMonkey12,fdzlxiv,t1_fdvpir4,You seem to understand this concept very well. I actually suffer from depression myself. Can we talk?
JesusAndSoda,fdvs2us,t1_fdvqrxl,"I know the feeling very well. I hope that you can find the source of those thoughts... if it's something you feel guilty about from the past, I hope you can confront it and put it right or vow never to have it happen again while you move on with your good life. But if it's just depression filtering everything in your mind towards darkness you don't deserve, whatever you do to get rid of that junk (medication, CBT, anything), I similarly hope you find most excellent success, bud."
JvIntellectual,fdy5svy,t1_fdvqrxl,I would recommend 12 rules for life. It gives great perspective on depression and nihilism.

AgileFox123,fdvlns4,t3_en7336,"YEESSS i get that! Id rather be depressed than feel absolute nothing/boredom

Obviously my thinking/ feeling has lead to depression but thats who i am, changing that would mean changing  me, so yes depression us comforting coz its what i know/ think/ feel 

Donno if this helps but yea"
Raph_1104,fdvmxqn,t1_fdvlns4,"good to know im not alone, thanks.... and same, i would rather be depressed than feel nothing, its a constant cycle i havent yet gotten rid of, i go to a therapist and everything, i feel like it isnt helping me, so i constantly put myself down and would rather not feel happy because i feel like the depressed me is the real me, again good to know im not alone with this and thanks"
Skynada,fdxluqz,t1_fdvlns4,But you’d be better without depression though like those people who enjoy life
mangogranola,fdystfh,t1_fdvlns4,It's the fear of the unknown.
fiftyspiders,fdybtl4,t1_fdvmxqn,"i learned the boredom is depression too, it’s just apathy. truly getting better feels really good. there is a difference, but your mind lies to you to keep you ill."

AgileFox123,fdz7qtf,t1_fdxluqz,"True but until i can get myswlf outa it, id rather feel anything"
Aworthyopponent,fe06q7t,t1_fdwkc1u,"Are you doing medication management along with therapy? I found that sometimes best results come from a mixture of readiness, medications, and a good connection with your therapist."

MyNamelessFace,fdvw9cy,t3_en7336,"I don't know what it is, but I feel the same. I want to get better, but I like  being alone at home, lying in bed. It's comforting. And it sounds exhausting as fuck to go out and have fun.  
After all these years happy people annoyed me with all their comments and plans and I kinda don't want to be one of them. 

It just feels like that's who I am."
Raph_1104,fdvxo6n,t1_fdvw9cy,"yea damn does that relate to me.... its really exausting and i dont want to go anywhere... i litterally live on my bed, i just get out of it to go get food or something but thats where i am 90% of the time, i see happy people around and i just feel this sense of loneliness, because ive always wanted to feel happy, but i love the comfort depression give me"
sunset_sunshine30,fdy9qj6,t1_fdvw9cy,I was invited out for drinks on Thursday. I managed about 3 hours and then I went home. People just drain me.
bweb82,fe2bbps,t1_fdvw9cy,Typed up a post and deleted it.  But you just explained exactly what I was trying to communicate.
MyNamelessFace,fdvz7ep,t1_fdvxo6n,"Yeah exactly. I'm studying, I go to work, I do things. But these things are all way too exhausting and I wish I could stay in bed forever.  I need my weekends at home to recharge energy for the week, otherwise I would have killed myself already... 

But being home on friday night, crying in bed, watching a movie, cuddled up with a hot water bottle ... it's just too comforting... I don't want to give that up."
Mark_Robert,fdyho0x,t1_fdvz7ep,"Really interesting, the joy of depression. Do you think it might be possible to let oneself totally enjoy that coziness without self-judgment? It seems to be the judgment that spoils the resting. Somehow I feel that if we can just give the bodymind what it needs, energy eventually returns. Then the question is what does the energy want to do."
phillystyleswag,fe06lvf,t1_fdyho0x,Yeah it’s perfectly normal to want to have a Friday night like that. Not everyone has to drink and party. What’s not okay is needing to do that so you don’t kill your self
MyNamelessFace,fe176j8,t1_fdyho0x,I can't remember the last time I had no self-judgment.
Mark_Robert,fe106p8,t1_fe06lvf,"I didn't intend to take that behavior out of context, as if to imply that there's nothing wrong for a severely depressed person. There is. Just like you say, there's a very good reason that the person is staying in bed. And that motivation likely doesn't feel free, but compelled.

I just don't think that fact should rob anyone of the enjoyment that is their birthright. In fact I'm hopng that whoever does it can enjoy it even more, get the most out of it. Often when people do that they severely judge themselves for it, which is just one more tie in the depression straight jacket."
Mark_Robert,fe1zjy6,t1_fe176j8,Me neither. It's a strong force. Sometimes it's nice to punch it in the face.
phillystyleswag,fe2elt8,t1_fe106p8,I think I was just more elaborating to the original poster. I completely agree with you just in different wording

InevitableUnoriginal,fdvjqjj,t3_en7336,"No, but if you find out let me know. I struggle with depression & suicidal thoughts, but I'm also on antidepressants to try stop that. But even if I feel/get better, I still fully intend to kill myself one day. It's a paradox."
Raph_1104,fdvmf14,t1_fdvjqjj,"i think i know but im not sure.... i dont look at myself with positivety, everytime i look in that mirror, i see someone who is pathetic and someone who should die, maybe i dont want to get better because i dont deserve to get better, im not sure, maybe i dont deserve to be called a good person so feeling sadness, sorrow and hatred towards myself is a very difficult habit to break and maybe thats why i dont want to get better idk... its a theory but i have no idea if this is the real reason.... also i get your feeling, a lot, i dont think im gonna live for long and i intend on killing myself one day too, ive nearly attempted it and didnt have the will power to do it maybe next time i will"

gethighsurvivethelie,fe5x6yj,t1_fdvmf14,Its so weird because i feel something similar. I think the only thing that stops me from thinking that was is knowing the disastrous consequences post death to my family and loved ones. I think im too rational. If i didnt have people that emotionally and financially depended on me i most likely would have taken my life a long time ago. Oh and this post was super comforting
wickedwritah,fdwcj1j,t3_en7336,"You are comfortable with depression because there is a routine to it, even if you don't know when the highs or lows will hit. It's what you know vs. what you don't know. I'm always at this place, it seems. Best wishes in getting better."
hinata_man,fdvv44q,t3_en7336,"Yes, I can feel that. I've been depressed for about 6 years and starting to get better now, but I feel numb. Of course I want a stable life like anyone else but the thought of being depressed again like the years I had before always passing by. Like depression is the only friend I got. I feel like I don't belong in this world and only my depression could understand that."

Suaveful,fdvtiou,t3_en7336,"the problem with depression is that it makes you want to do nothing. it sucks the life and energy out of you.

for me, i feel kinda guilty when i’m depressed. i spent like five hours cleaning my apartment today and i was reminded of how much time i’ve wasted in order to make such a mess. i was bedridden for two months. 

i know i was sick but i can’t help but think how much life i have missed because of depression. it makes me sad sometimes but i remember that it’s an illness. 

it’s okay to give yourself time to rest, but take advantage of life. at least then, the downs don’t seem so bad when you have the ups to compare them to."

Suaveful,fdyx7f9,t1_fdxlmff,"i am a hopeful person. i would like to think the pain we go through is for a reason. i'd like to be a therapist one day and while there are days where i can't stand to exist, i know that there are others who could use my help.

my piece of advice? find something to do during the day. there was a point in my life where i was just volunteering around the community because i couldn't hold down a job or stay in school. volunteering made me feel some worth because i knew i was doing something meaningful. 

also, you're strong for asking for help. we heal because of those around us. keep fighting. :)"
Suaveful,fdvv7ju,t1_fdvuby8,"you arent alone. my best advice would be to reach out to a mental health professional (therapist, social worker, psychologist). they would be well equipped to help work with you and any mental illness."

petulafaerie,fdwquyd,t3_en7336,"Me too. 

When you live with depression for a long time it becomes your every day normal. It’s your constant. You start to get scared of how much worse it could be. Better the devil you know kinda thing... 

You start to forget (if you ever even knew) what life was like without depression. This is your world now and it’s hard to want something you can barely remember even existing."
lsderay,fdvojm8,t3_en7336,Yes I can relate. It's like a part of me enjoys depression and causes immense irritability and self hate. At the same time I don't want to feel anxious and depressed. It's like being used to it. It's horrible.
Raph_1104,fdvrc9u,t1_fdvojm8,"yea its so horrible.... its quite comforting isnt it? ive been dealing with it for 2 years atm, ie justn gotten used to it and feel comforted by the feeling, and whenever i do feel it, i get this immense need to self harm, and i do it to feel something else other than this emotional pain and torture, and also do it for control"

mmzs267,fdw0im7,t3_en7336,"I really relate to this, it almost feels wrong to be happy. Its got to the point that when something bad happens in my life it makes me feel good, almost gives me a form of justification for how I feel"

I still have my bad days, but my good days make it worth it. If you can get on antidepressants or go to therapy I definitely would!

spectris_lunaris,fdxl1ni,t3_en7336,"Fear of change and the unknown. When you've struggled with depression for a long enough time, theres a certain sense of comfort in staying sick and it becomes frightening to think about moving beyond it, because we dont know what's beyond the depression and we dont know who we are without it. Our minds rationalize that while being miserable all the time is unpleasant, it's something we know, and therefore it's safer than trying to recover. 

For me, theres also the fear of being expected to do more once you've recovered, and not being able to meet those expectations because my energy levels and ability to do things has always been very shallow, and not meeting expectations would send me spiralling again."

underbridgejohn,fdwf28m,t3_en7336,I can understand. Sometimes I just want to shut the world out and drown in my sorrows. Not sure why. Just in a dark period of life right now.

neodmaster,fdwhtbt,t3_en7336,"Confusion is always a great first step to recovery! If you’re 50/50 (growth/stuckness) congrats because the ratio could be a lot worst, you just need to increase to 60/40 and edge it day by day until you get some good thrills going as your approach 80/20. At that point there is no more temptation to return to the dark side, just bumps in the road."

ilovesam69,fdwnjc3,t3_en7336,"It’s really comforting to take the easy way out and give up responsibility. Just like getting a job and going through your day, dealing with people and work is hard... so is getting better. Just like doing drugs and having sex with whoever gives you immediate gratification... so does blaming behavior on your disorder and self loathing as “a high”. “I’m fucked up so I should just give up”.. its an easy way out of everything.

Drugs are easy. Sex is easy. But they leave you feeling like shit if that’s your go for “happiness”. They leave you with nothing after. They consume you. Eventually people wont feel sorry for you and you cant be coddled. Eventually survival and positivity need to be your goal 

Just like how that meaningful job you worked hard to get and maintain, and friend circle you put time into to build up, and positive relationship building with your shitty family, and positive relationship building with a significant other... is hard... will give life meaning. It is hard.. but its worth it. Take it from someone thats been through it for years."
Random-Waffle,fdwv9te,t3_en7336,"I don't think anyone of us wants depression, but life with out depression is a lot scarier for us then life with depression. I don't know life any other way and it very hard to change to a new life."

scoliboi,fdwycyk,t3_en7336,I definitely understand that and it's such a confusing feeling too. This is why I consider depression like a parasite cause it's just latched onto us. It does feel like it's become a part of me and I think that's why it's harder to get rid of it now because my personality has adjusted to being gloomy and sad all the time now.
entelechies,fdwyhy3,t3_en7336,"I’m sure I am reiterating what others have said, but this is definitely a part of depression. Your brain gets used to it, and you aren’t in the present- your mind is stuck. I find it hard to envision myself without depression, too, and I think part of that is thinking I’ll inevitably kill myself one day, so how could I have a future? etc

It’s been helpful for me to learn DBT skills, so I would look into that if you haven’t already!"

When building a habit say going to the gym, what you feel doesn't matter. You go to the gym. No excuses. If there's a will there's a way.

That's how you build discipline. On your low days. Your why will push you. So define your purpose. Keep it up."

g9goOfNarf,fdxov09,t3_en7336,"Here is a possible factor of why would some of us feel uncomfortable to overcome depression. 

Imagin you go to a war. You suffer greatly. You loose so much, like your health, mental capability, opportunities, people, faith, you name it! Then they say ""war is over, you may return home"". Your gut feeling would hate that. Why? Because after everything you lost, you refuse to walk out empty handed. It doesn't feel right to accept your loss without a return. 
So you feel more comfortable staying in the battelfield as if the battle still going, as if you could still win something that could justify your suffering. 

Or maybe im just speaking for my self 🤮"

I think it’s more we just live in the moment, but we aren’t apart of it. It’s okay to feel this way and I think that over time or with the right people that you’re surrounded by, this feeling will eventually fade away. I think when you start to experience more things that make you smile or laugh or snort coffee out your nose is when your feelings will come back to you. That’s usually the time when we feel a little more alive and want to work towards things. Do you remember anything you wanted to work towards before you felt like this? If so, continue working towards them, don’t let your laziness and comfort in how you feel stop you from still doing things entirely!"

Raph_1104,fdx8txe,t1_fdwi6h3,pretty much.. your on point with that
TheUnidentifiedBoy,fdx4t6r,t3_en7336,"My experience of 9 years being depressed is that 6 and a half of those depressed years I didn't understand what it was and why but I only knew I just wanted the pain to go away. But since 2018 for the past 3 years I sort of developed the depression into something else, it's like its part of me and who I am and that I feel I need it to know what I want to be. Make sense? Probably not.

But I deeply felt depressed because I wanted to be a better person with a unique personality that stands out more - think of it like a hero from a movie. I wanted that attension that I could be that perfect happy person with a perfect life and family and friends and job etc, to not have something bad happen to me, to be seen as a good person, heroic, brave, happy. etc. But then I realised that I can't be that and it made me depressed, what gave me hope to move on is that I can 'IMPROVE' and try to be better, and I did, and it worked; sort of, for a while at least. But the other half of the depression the negitive part tells me that even if I were to acomplish that and have what I wanted, I'd still feel the same because the need never ends. I could be the person I want to be and be with the person I want to be (that inspired me of wanting to be like) but regardless, I still feel I can't be happy.

This is why I want the pain to go away so I don't feel that sadness, but I also don't want it to go away because I so badly want to feel that emotion of being 'brave, cute, heroic' or 'badass, strong, angry person' or whatever it is you want to be. Anyone get this or no? It's so complicated to explain if you don't feel the emotion and connection.

A proper example;

Imagine you're obsessed with your favorite movie character and you want to be like them (this example I'm going to use someone like David Tennant from Doctor Who) or someone you have a crush on, or your friend, or your doctor, or an army solider or whatever, but for this I'm using him as an example (but for me personally idc about this one). So he's brave, heroic, fights aliens, etc. You feel you want to be like him and say you were like him and with him, would you still be satisfied? Because the one half of your depression wants you to have that pain to 'feel that emotion' of being like them, but that won't just go away if you fullfil your needs, you want to feel that emotion? Yes? The way I see it 50% of your depression you want it to go away but successfully getting what you want, but the other 50% wants the pain to stay so you can feel the 'happiness' emotion of getting what you want. The hope of achieving it.

It's sooo difficult to explain but I hope someone gets it. Its all I can really say.

&#x200B;

Secondly. So many things make people depressed, there's tons of things for me, from my Weight, my balding Hair, my Personality, Job, Money, Lack of Friends and outgoing to the main one ""Wanting to be a better person, having a life like other happy people"" I would love to have a story/life like these TV stories like Lost In Space, The Flash, The 100, The Walking Dead, etc. by this I mean like take for example 'Lost In Space'. You're with a happy caring family (obviously have your problems) on a new planet after a crash, you survive together, you do crazy things together, you have a connection to things like robots or whatever. That emotion I feel is deeply strong. In a way it makes me happy and the other sad. Because everyone has a story, we all have one, with different people in it. But I'm inspired by so many ones that make me feel a strong connection or emotion that I would love to have a story like others. Why? I feel I'd be happy. But if I had that story, wouldn't you still feel the same? Hmm"
Raph_1104,fdx7vay,t1_fdx4t6r,"where my depression manifested from is my loneliness as a person, drugs, self hatred from things like my face, body shape, and such....  to me its like riding a bike, its supposed to be fun right but its not everything feels the same and nothings changed, you try to fill that emptiness with drugs, sex and positive people around you, but you cant, in truth my story is a sad one in itself... my dad doesnt care about me, constantly puts me down, my friends i feel like they dont care about me and im single so theres that to add to the loneliness, one thing i can take from this is that at least ive got my mum, brother and sister, but even though i have that, i still feel alone in life and thats how i can explain my one, it wasnt too indepth though"
TheUnidentifiedBoy,fdxigie,t1_fdx7vay,"Yeah I really feel you. This is why I come to the internet to talk to people I don't know about depression rather than my own friends/family because a lot of the time its easier to talk to someone else who is going through the same or similar thing as myself.

A lot of the time I feel alone too. I did a test because I really wanted to see something. I sent a message to people I have known for about 1 year and last spoke to them a few weeks ago. I sent 5 people a message. Only 2 responded.

To be honest, we have to find the people who are right for us in our lives and try to not let those types of people drag us down more than we already are."

VanillaGhoul,fdwgcka,t3_en7336,"I also feel the same. Ever since my father died my depression spiraled out of control. Before then, I got by without antidepressants. But now, I am taking two of them and an antipsychotic because I couldn’t sleep. I admit I wished I couldn’t feel my emotions anymore and I think my cptsd is haunting me again. 

Part of me thinks I will not get better. It is just a constant war inside my head."
softheartedcynic,fdxei4a,t3_en7336,"Yeah. I understand. It’s safe down here. It feels like you can’t feel much worse and that’s somehow comforting. I am trying to do the best I know how, but it’s scary. It’s like I’m in a deep dark pit and I have a rope I can climb to get out of it but every time I try I’ll start to get tired and I’ll start wanting to let go because I don’t know what to expect when I get up there. That’s a world of opportunities and choices, and up there, you’re reliant on only yourself. I could just sleep at the bottom and wait for a new day. There’s always a new day, another time. That’s nice to keep in mind, but it’s also enabling."
MQZ17,fdxh769,t3_en7336,"Feeling pain *is* technically feeling something.

L0YAL_SKY,fdxmp0y,t3_en7336,"I know exactly how you feel. I even wrote a song about it called ❤/🧠. It's essentially 2 diffent perspectives about suicide and depression. When you're entangled to your thoughts, it's very hard to see the greater good of the world. This is why people contemplate suicide even when they have everything, because there in a different world than their peers. Whereas the heart knows that getting better and overcoming the fiends within your mind is a better solution for everyone. Overall, these perspectives intertwine together to your emotions. (This is why it is very hard to explain; emotions are complicated.) That's just my opinion on a matter like this, I think it differs for everyone else."
OnceInMyLife,fdxn6tp,t3_en7336,Similar situation as me
Pitifool,fdxnbr8,t3_en7336,"When I get suicidal, becoming more depressed becomes productive in my mindset, because in order to finally commit suicide and thereby actually do something about my fundamental issues, I have to be more depressed and hopeless than I've ever been. So every step away from being a productive normal person feels bad because I'm even further away from attaining that, but it also feels good because it puts me one step closer to finally destroying myself and abandoning the futile quest of trying to not be a giant steaming pile of garbage."

Squishy9994,fdxtvst,t3_en7336,"I definitely get that, it can be so comfortable to just be depressed but once you get out of that rut it gets so much better, you get to enjoy life and spend time with people you love."
pniak_w_kominku,fdy3mpi,t3_en7336,"So relatable man. I think it's kinda  *cool* to be depressed these days, especially among people who tend to enjoy melancholy, like those who like sad music or film or literature. I also sometimes think that if I stop being depressed I would be a less interesting person (not that I am lol), or if for instance I stopped being socially awkward, which I think some people find relatable, or kinda cute even (myself for instance). Like there are series like Bojack or 13 reasons or entire music scenes like depressive black metal or idk indie rock which generally revolve around being sad, and I think it is one of the reasons why it is so. The weird part is I don't even mind it to be honest.  
And there's also that what you said in a comment that depression seems to be better than nothingness"
DrainGothGTBSG,fdyfyb0,t3_en7336,I feel like this sometimes because I just *know* there is no real happyness. Like I don’t want to just fake it and smile because it’s so tiring and there is nothing to smile about. So it throws me through depression and I kind of just know it’s how I’ll be for good.
Weird-Ratio,fdyhr16,t3_en7336,"I know what you mean. I am no longer diagnosed with depression, but I am diagnosed with anxiety and take medication for it. Sometimes I get so scared not to suffer from it, since it's basically the only thing I know. My anxiety is trauma related, and one of my first ever memories was me having a panic attack at four years old. I don't know who I am without it and that is terrifying. It's not only that it's the only thing I know but also that it comforts me, and makes me in a way feel safe. Which makes recovery very hard."

endorpheus,fdz16fd,t3_en7336,"I tend to have seasonal depression which for me personally, I've discovered is accompanied by a general feeling of anxiety.   Perhaps not quite how you experience it.  I would rather be numb quite frankly.  I am in the process of trying non-pharmaceutical supplements to take control of that toxic burning feeling I get primarily from my face to my navel on into my arms.  It's triggered by music, past relationships, odors, awkwardness in social situations, and especially being alone.  The sensation tends to take my breath away and is very uncomfortable.  I would do anything to make it stop or at least know how to topple it quickly.  I would rather feel nothing than anxiety or depression any day.  It's uncomfortable, robs me of my smile, my energy, and gets in the way of me being awesome.  And I am.  When spring shows up and the sun shines, my depression/anxiety ends.  But then around September, it modulates back again.  It's a lousy feeling, especially knowing what to expect and being unable to do much about it.  I just can't imagine how anyone could be comforted or addicted to being depressed.  It's nothing short of a curse for me.  Whatever the case, I hope you figure out what's up with it and discover whatever is going on there.  Thanks for all the awakened comments and best wishes."
NoDeedUnpunished,fe02ql8,t1_fdz16fd,"I've been on a two year excursion into supplements to treat my depression and anxiety and I've had good results. I'm sure you probably know that vitamin D is the likely suspect for seasonal depression. I also take 5thp, tyrosine, B6 and C. I can't say my depression has completely lifted, but I can say with 100% confidence that I'm no where near as low as I was.   


The biggest frustration I have is connecting with those who are serious about fighting this horrible life sapping curse. In the last year I've spent a thousand hours researching depression and it's cause. Currently, I'm fighting candida."
Phebeosa,fdz49mn,t3_en7336,"I set super small goals at first. Exercise for 15 minutes. Just get on me knees and do pushups, sit ups, resistance bands, etc. Make sure atleast my room was clean. Go outside for 30 minutes, even if its just driving. An showering atleast once a day. Very small, very simple, but that really got the ball rolling. Also, staying away from any type of news, social media (never had social media but i see what it does to people.) And all that negativity BS that its become.

Animekween8,fdzcyxe,t3_en7336,"I can definitely relate to that feeling. Like others have implied, I do believe it is a mix of wanting to be free of the pain but not wanting to get out of your comfort zone. I know it is very difficult, (I have a lot of trouble too), but try to do some things that may be out of your comfort zone. That may liberate you from this feeling because although it may hurt or be uncomfortable at first, if you get used to it, you will definitely be a new person. Good luck! You got this! ❤"

I don't know if your depression has hampered your life at all but if it has and you aren't as active as you were before, you don't care about responsibility as much, it could be you've found comfort in that. Not to mention you have to fight the depression now as well as problems you may have been ignoring, if you want to get back to where you were, which is demotivating.

Luna14Sith,fe00n3b,t3_en7336,"You most likely feel “attached” to your depression for a few reasons.
1) Being addicted to the sudden jumps in dopamine and serotonin when you suddenly get “happy” for a few hours.
2) You built your life/personality/existence around and/or on your depression, so now if you get better then you’re starting completely new.
3) You’re scared of change, kinda goes with #2. 
4) You crave attention and depression, depending on how people react to your depression, can provide a specific type of attention that people who’ve been lacking attention from others will typically want/need.
Obviously, there are many more reasons, but these are some of the reasons why I’m still not wanting to fully get better."

People in thos territory can either sink back into the quicksand of depression, or they can graplpple whatever they can and use as much fortitude as they have to move upward and forward.

Sports physical therapists call thos the breaking point.  When Marshawn Lynch was qual' for the NFL, he reached a point in his workouts where they said he could either just maintain his workouts and keep at the same physical performance on the field, or he could explode with energy and reach a new level of strength training and energy on the field.  The physical therapists call this explosion of energy ""field focus"", where the player sets his mind to break tye plateau and push into another level of performance on the fieldds.

Scientists were asked what causes this phenomenon, thay wrre told that it is pure mindset that is ingrained into their psyche from the beginning.

I am a warrior. I am confident. I am successful. I will not fallback into the pit of darkness I was in before. I will grab into every hand hold I can to pull myself out of this depression.  Then I will walk--no run away from that hole as far as I can get. When I see others approaching that hole, I WILL YELL ""HEY! HEY YOU! WATCH OUT FOR THAT 60 FOOT DEEP CAVERN!! ITS TERRIBLE TO GET OUT!

I AM CONFIDENT.

I AM VICTORIOUS.

I AM MAN."
internally,elycos,top_level,"I'm a sophomore in college right now and I am constantly surrounded by wise people... People who did things with their lives in high school and didn't waste it away crying, starving themselves, neglecting their work... They were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all. They were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues. They were able to make friends without poor social cues.

I had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday, and even then I never had positive influences to help me. My parents were so busy with work that since my youth I was always alone at home. I have trouble having fun... I can't emotionally feel like a happy person, it's always forced. It doesn't come naturally to me so people didn't like people like me.

I'm too lazy to write this but basically I feel so bitter. I wish I did more so I could show off my potential but nope, I wasn't certain of myself ever. I'm trying to improve but my past latches onto me. ): Sigh.

Edit: I have something to add. First, I am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post. We all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past. I also didn't get to finish writing this (because I hadn't the energy to finish) but there were moments where I stopped eating, showering, and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time. I also hid my feelings all the time. When people used to say, ""You don't understand!"" it would hurt so much because I really did in some way, or so I thought. I had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but I was never very honest because I was always afraid of the consequences. I feel a little bit of pride I guess saying this but I feel like I'm an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all, like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until I can remove it completely. Nowadays I struggle to even read sometimes, I just don;t have the strength, but I try.

I do say though writing this was therapeutic because I am severely overwhelmed saying this but thanks for reading."

Of course if I am an adult, I won't be the same person I was when I was ten or so, but I truly felt like I have shed the skin of the person I was a mere two years ago, seven years ago, ten years ago... I am so saddened by it lol."
graveboi,fdlv0y2,t3_elycos,"From ages 19-22 I felt more 16 than I when I was actually 16.

It didn't come overnight, but its when you make the conscious decision to make those changes and stick to them long enough where you start reaping the benefits that it starts to help. You feel better about yourself, other people actually want to be seen around you, and maybe even invite you to hang out from time to time. It's hard and it's not overnight but putting the effort into yourself by reflecting on yourself and having self-awareness is a good place to start."

2serve,fdlz0vw,t3_elycos,"Yeah for sure.  Im nearly 30 but some days and in certain I feel like a child still. Even though I am a fully independent and functional adult in the eyes of the world, when all the responsibilities are over, I kind of just revert somewhat.  I dont know why or how to fully explain it but I think its mainly just missing out on so much of the social aspect of maturing because of the depression and anxiety.  In my case, in those crucial developmental years, everyone else went out and made connections and learned key social skills, while I stayed home in my safe bubble in isolation. 

May not be your case but its something ive noticed about the workings of my weird little brain"
andromedex,fdlzjuv,t1_fdlz0vw,"I don't think it's weird at all. When you don't  get to really be a ""normal"" kid you end up an adult trying to figure out how to fill that gap. And there's so much pressure from society it never feels like you have room or the time to nurture that inner child in a healthy way."
2serve,fdm40en,t1_fdlzjuv,"Yeah its kind of like how there were all those cliques back in school and if you werent in with the ""popular kids"" and were in the fringe groups, you now have to completely change and become like them in order to survive in this world as it is now run by them. 

The way I see it, its sort of class based as well. If you think about it most of those cliques, at least when I was in school, were kind of seperated by social class and wealth.  Wealth, even of middle class, breeds (for the most part) confident children who end up as jocks, preps, or what have you. Even those of them who had mental illness were probably diagnosed by a good psychiatrist and medicated from an early age.  In adulthood their parents have connections so they many times end up as managers, business owners, etc.  Then they expect everyone to fit into their box of what they perceive to be normalcy and look down on those who do not quite fit the mold because theyve never experienced any other way of living.  Not to say all children with wealthy parents fit this bill but statistically speaking and from personal experience, id say a good majority do. 

Of course, thats no excuse for a lack of social skills, as were are social creatures and our very survival and progression as a species has always depended on social structure and communication.  It does, however, create a stigma and as a result, a severe pressure and anxiety for those of us who were not so blessed with the geneological roll of the dice."
Some-Looser,fdmqz9c,t1_fdlzjuv,"I'm very similar. I am 27 and started getting depressed around 19-20, now in my school life I was mostly happy, I had lots of friends and such but as school ended we all went our ways and I was left alone. From there I guess I was used to being social I felt alone, felt like I never belonged and whilst everyone else my age was having fun, I was alone and comparing my life to others which didn't help.
I still live a lonely and sad life, I still dont feel like a ""adult"", sure i work and such but it's hardly different to school just with a pay slip. Actually I enjoy work, not because I like my job (I really don't) but it's the one place I am forced to interact with people who feel like they want to talk to me instead of having to. 

But yeah, I still feel like someone trapped at 20, I have all the makings of a adult in that I can drive, drink and work but that's all, I look like a teen and feel like one most of the time."
DrDougExeter,fdmsmon,t1_fdlzjuv,"Yes that's how I feel.  All I want is to fill the gap and get the experiences I never got to have, but now I know I'm too old and I'll never get it.  So what's the point of living?  I need those things to move forward and now I can never get it so I'm just going to be stuck and frustrated the rest of my life until I kill myself."
Snowsneezer,fdlomkb,t3_elycos,"I completely understand. I've spent the first half of my life isolated. I was so scared to do anything more but go about my day, fading into background. And now I look back and it hurts so bad at the things I wish I could've done, at the memories, friends, and experiences I could've made. I look back and realize there was never anything to be afraid of in the first place. 

I can't know what you're going through right now but I do know what it means to long for the past. I found a quote the other day and it's resonated with me ever since. 

""The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The next best time is now.""

 Life moves on. Don't waste today wishing for a better yesterday because one day, you'll look back on today and wish you had lived. 

You know what's helped me tremendously? Thinking about the past and writing about it. Crying about the time that I've lost, allowing myself to grieve, but only for so long. Only for a limited amount of time. Set a timer and allow yourself that time to be sad, but once that timer is up, focus on the present and take the steps to a better tomorrow 

I hope to one day come to terms with my past and look forward to tomorrow. I hope you can too."

Not even because of my pain in life but the part of the city I live in... Everyone is so sad looking, many crack addicts and such, old ladies who are near their deathbeds, but I was so depressed and anxious the only people I could help were my friends.

andromedex,fdlxekv,t3_elycos,"I wrote out stuff and deleted it because it got too real but I was you just a year ago lmao. But University surrounded by fucking geniuses nurtured by wealthy parents. I was always too ashamed to let anyone know I was 2 or 3 years older than them, that I had to take less credits because I literally couldn't handle more because of my mental illness. 

But along the way I realized I wasnt the only one pretending, and pretty much everyone around me was in a constant state of feeling inadequate. Pretty much everyone in college is an overachiever. The kids with a C envies the B kid, who envies the A kid, who envies the C kids people skills. When you're programmed to feel inadequate, it will NEVER feel like enough. And if you have anxiety, it's so easy to feel anxious because if dumb brain chemicals and assume that means that something is wrong, that YOU are doing something wrong. 

If it makes you feel better, life is looking kinda good now, actually. I didn't make any honors but after a soul crushing 6 month job search I found an amazing job. Im still trying to process the reality that everything worked out. To be independent with a small place, able to get healthcare and spoil my cats. I was literally you and it worked out for me, so try not to lose hope yet.

I always envied those that participated in sports/extracurriculars. I wanted to be like those people but the part of me that wanted to stay in my room and be sad about everything won over. I disliked social activities yet longed for more company. Life has always felt like a chore, and it took some time before I realized that not everyone feels like this."
internally,fdm3tx1,t1_fdm13is,"Don't remind me, please. I am 100% positive that having depression for as long as I have had it is the reason why I can't even do some tasks the way I wish I could.

NightR0cker,fdm4w6o,t1_fdm3tx1,"Don't worry about that. Your brain will heal completely via neurogenesis once you get better and maintain it.

do psychotherapy, I think it might the the way out of this."

I feel I'm about 5-10 years behind my peers.

What they have accomplished years ago I am just getting around to. But at the same time, I also did not grow up with the same resources they did and was still able to do some things (e.g. go to college), so that feel like a triumph. 

My setbacks were mostly due to growing up in poverty. I didn't develop the social skills needed to develop relationships with people. Who would want to befriend the smelly kid that worse oversized handmedowns. Childhood was lonely. Actually, life was lonely until not long ago. I finally paid off my student loans. I was able to work fewer hours because I lived frugaly. I used that extra time to work on my social skills which lead me to interviewing better and getting a way better paying job.

I'm no longer homeless. Started the year off with no bills, no debts, and a full stomach. Looking back, I think povery lead my depression which lead a cycle of staying in povery."

ophiuchusmoon,fdlx77w,t3_elycos,"Oh it set me back and it frustrates me a lot! When I was not depressed I was the best of my classes at university, I did my hobbies, mantained a relationship, hanged out with friends, did voluntary work at an NGO... all I wanted to do was possible and I got it. Now? Well now I don't have a job and sometimes I just don't want to wake up nor go outside, and off course I don't want to talk with anyone. So yeah, I get what you say."
onejiveassturkey,fdlz37w,t3_elycos,"For sure, and some of my best years. But that's why I'm so glad that I'm out of the black hole. A year of medication and therapy and I finally untangled those pervasive negative thoughts that were holding me back."
youngling9797,fdm2ktx,t3_elycos,"A week ago I found myself thinking the same thing, how I didn't have the number and depth of relationships and history as other kids my age because I wasted my high school experience away in solitude, depression, and anxiety. But then I realized there's nothing to be gained from that kind of comparison. Life is a glass. It's filled with water, but not completely. We can either pay attention to the half of the glass that's full, or the half that's empty. It's not a matter of truth, it's a matter of choice. Things happened to me in my life that I can't change at this point. Should I ruminate on it and waste away? Or focus on the things that bring me joy *now* and the things I could do that could bring me joy."
NegativeHour,fdm2v49,t3_elycos,"I am so sorry for what you have suffered through. I can relate to feeling like you have been   
""set back."" I am 20 and I have only taken a handful of classes. No college, no parties, no friends, no girls, no fun, none of anything, really. My depression, bipolar, and OCD have really ruined my life. I can relate to not eating almost all day, not showering, and not brushing teeth, because that's me now. I am not sure that my meds are the right ones for me as well. I wish you the best, and hope that we can both make it out of this pain and suffering. It can be so, so hard."

Dinosaur21222324,fdmia4z,t3_elycos,"Just to let you know, and this is my humble take on smarts: People who are deemed intellectual are those who have good memory. Take testing for example. They make you read and/or listen on something  over and over. Then, they asses how well you REMEMBER what the taught meaning was, NOT what you actually absorbed and translated. Therefore, ""knowledge"" is simply a test of memory, not being intellectual. Focus on remembering things that make you feel, not memorizing what others want you to memorize. Getting better grades will follow suit. Happy New Year, btw."
KaptanKrops,fdmjsj1,t3_elycos,"yeah I definitely relate. I would always waste my life just doing nothing but playing video games or watching YouTube, and I can definitely see the consequences of my actions. I always wanted to create - literature, music, languages - but I never had the energy, and then I'd feel bad about never doing anything and then just play more video games to drown everything out. it was a vicious cycle of wasting my time and then wasting more time to ignore the fact that I feel bad about wasting time. it sucked. 

what I said about seeing the consequences of my actions: I am a music major, and I play tuba. but when I look at the great people around me, the reason they're so much better than me is because they were able to use all their time to effectively practice during their high school years. now I fear I'll never be as good as them because they got such a head start. 

idrk why I bothered commenting any of this, but... idk

I'm nowhere near as depressed as I used to be, but I always feel really badly about the time I wasted because of my depression, even though I couldn't help it. 

anyway, idk why I commented this, I guess I secretly needed to vent? sorry"
argnold-palmer,fdnnhu2,t3_elycos,"I understand this. A lot of the time I feel like a sack of wasted potential. I feel like if I had more confidence I could be more successful in life. If I just worked harder, I could have probably had a career in music, art, or even poetry. But I’m too self-conscious—so I never thought/think I could really make something of myself."
lillipup03,fdlxt87,t3_elycos,"It definitely set me back in school. Growing up I was always expected to have good grades and go to a prestigious college (not necessarily an Ivy League school, but still a rather competitive one). But once my symptoms started to kick in during middle/high school, I struggled so much with motivation in terms of doing work because... ugh. I just didn’t feel like it was worth it.

Now I’m a junior in high school, and although I finally feel like I’m getting my school career back on track, it’s still all shit that I should’ve been doing since like 8th grade. I have a 2.3 GPA (although it’ll likely rise this semester) so really the only option I see right now is community college. And there’s nothing wrong with that... but I’m just not gonna be able to go to the college I’ve wanted to go to since I was 8. 

...and it’s all thanks to depression, anxiety, and ASD. Those three killed all my motivation and self confidence for several years, and it’s completely knocked me off the path I expected myself to be on. Adults say the nice thing about being a kid is that I can still “restart”, but can I really? It’s too late. I’ll *never* go to Ohio State, no matter how much I want to. The way it worked out for me is that my school didn’t realize I needed all the help I did, so I had absolutely no support for the first two and a half years.

Not to mention my social life... that’s somehow even worse. And that’s more thanks to the ASD than the depression, but I never learned how to make friends as a kid. Then everyone got comfortable in their friend groups and I was stuck alone. I had nobody to talk to when I was severely depressed, so it was so hard to improve. I still haven’t, really. Even though my depression is doing a lot better than it has been the last couple of years, there’s still so much missing from my life that it just sets me back."
the_vent,fdly0x8,t3_elycos,I've been wanting to make a similar post for a long time. It took a while for me to reduce my indulgent rumination over this. I try to keep in mind that the grass seems greener.

internally,fdm4tzc,t1_fdlzioy,"how old are you right now? please try to do extracurricular activities and focus on your education as much as possible. just try something. put the energy of your emotions into your work. that is my biggest regret... not exploring more options. i'm in compsci now and think that some of the tools i could have learned back then would be applicable now to make apps today. of course literally absolutely everything im saying is easier said than done but i promise you it helps to build a work ethic. think about what you can do now for the future. for tomorrow's you! just think, do you want who you are today to be the person you are in five years from now? or do you want to be a better version of you? take care."

Chmilona,fdm16od,t3_elycos,Ever since I dropped out of college life has been shit and I need to change but don’t know if there is any point. I never achieved anything before dropping out and sometimes wonder if going back would be good. The real question is what do you want you want from life and chase that goal like heck if you can’t find one like me you might be fucked
exuberantfish,fdm2i2k,t3_elycos,If definitely set me back socially but it didn’t set me back in intelligence. Other than memory problems I think it’s made me smarter because I’ve learned a lot of observational and analytical skills
TheRandomPig,fdm5fg0,t3_elycos,"Before I had depression I was the top of my class and even ahead a grade or 2 but after I started experiencing depression I could no longer pay attention or work as efficiently as I used to, so yes I do think it did"
kneechasenpai,fdm8tlt,t3_elycos,"I'm 27 and still in my first year of uni. I lost 2 years because of health issues but the rest were due to mental problems. I've sold my own clothes and gadgets for drugs but never ever sold my books though. I can give full attention every period, for whole semesters but the moment I step inside my own house, I lose all motivation to work hard. I love learning but there are hurdles too big to overcome sometimes. I have big dreams. I also have depression. Fucking sucks."
Belllringer,fdmbhao,t3_elycos,"I feel you OP on a lot you have said. I feel depression and anxiety and the other attached things still set me back now. I had a ton of medical problems as a teen so I feel, in many ways, that was the spark to all of this. I missed years of HS and did tutoring in the hospital and after in the physical therapy rehab. At that age, my life stopped as completely changed trajectory. Now, I’m supposedly an adult and I think I have a PTSD from everything I went through and I feel like family around me was so affected by circumstance that it’s an unspoken topic. When you talk about screaming,crying,shitting it all out. Getting all the emotion(etc) that is holding you back, I feel the exact same. I think I even tried it once many years back. I’ve been in mental health therapy for my whole life and I’m sick of just talking, I have heard people do change, why can’t I? I read about, talk about, try to take action but it ends up in tears. It’s all so goddamn tiring. My rules of getting up and dressed daily are getting harder and harder.
Edit: I wish you the best, I do hear you very vividly."
YikYakCadillac,fdmnjqw,t3_elycos,"Oh yeah, developmentally I stalled from 16-21 and now I'm almost 23 and I'm still playing catch up. But in the past couple years (even couple months) I've made some progress such as traveling abroad, living on my own, etc. If there's one thing I've learned, its better to be a late bloomer that to have grown up too early. Those that've lived too fast spend years paying for their mistakes while late bloomers can observe what went wrong and learn from them."
avakadava,fdm091u,t3_elycos,"Oh for sure... socially, academically and  professionally. Impacts ur physical health negatively too because ur less motivated to look after it"
cbunni666,fdlzt2m,t3_elycos,All the damn time. I still feel its holding me back in some aspects. Like having kids. I feel my husband resents me for not wanting to.
Thebiglloydtree,fdm3kwx,t3_elycos,"Frankly, yes. I'm told I've gotten smarter and more emotionally intelligent since leaving school but frankly, my experience led to some very damaging choices, numbing most emotion and isolating myself from most people.

Trying to unravel it now, it kinda feels like I've been in stasis for 15 years, a teenager surrounded by people marrying and having kids. It can be frustrating, but ultimately I just had to acknowledge that it was what I felt was necessary to survive. I may be a late bloomer, but I'm still here, and I guess that counts for something."
SureNarwhal,fdm5zgr,t3_elycos,"I'm feeling that right now.  I was fired from my job last year and time is slipping.  There aren't very many opportunities and no one wants to hire me for them.  The longer it goes, the worse this will get, of course.  To an extent, they are right of course.  I am sitting here and my skills and knowledge are just slipping away.  And there is the prejudice against the unemployed as well - they will assume I must be a terrible employee because I am not working.  

And what am I to do about it?  Nothing.  I can't do anything.  People will say go network.  But how does a severely depressed and anxious person who can barely leave the house or speak to anyone network?  I'll tell you - it isn't possible.  I don't have the social skills to do it.  And I certainly don't have the mental fortitude to present convincingly as a relatively normal person right now.  Especially for the meaningless shit of networking - I don't care about those people, I am not interested in those people, and I know the reverse is true.  It would be true even if I was not uninteresting, completely lacking in personality, and have a tendency to say nothing or stupid things.  Which is all true."

knockdownthewall,fdmvypk,t3_elycos,"All the fucking time. I never got to enjoy my years aged 8-13 and I always wish I could go back and time and grow up normally and healthily and without having to adopt the maturity and responsibility of an adult. I've always had troubles with school because of my mental health, and while at the moment I'm 100% ready for and interested in my A levels I just never developed the work ethic which you get from GCSEs etc. Depression took everything away from me. My relationship with my parents and friends, my hobbies, my skills, my passions. While I'm trying to get better at the moment it's still hard to struggle with the fallout of a decade of having absolutely nothing except my shitty emotions. 

It will get better for us though. Old hobbies can be re-adopted and all these things can be compensated for. It's just hard when you're stuck in a state of grief over your childhood."
MaximumGamer1,fdmw92e,t3_elycos,"It's not that I feel depression set me back a few years. Depression did set me back several years. By all rights, I should be three years into a very successful career right now like everyone else in my graduating class and major in college, but here I am, still living with a family that actively dislikes me, sustained on odd jobs spread out months apart. I'm still haunted by the loss of a friend that occurred nearly three years ago now, and I have too little self-confidence or motivation to be able to succeed at getting the kind of career that I deserve for all the hard work I did in college. It's all been a giant mess."

UraniumGriffin,fdn6p8q,t3_elycos,"I know exactly what you mean. I was hopelessly depressed and stagnant from 17-23. a few glimmers of hope maybe surmounting to about half a year over those 6 years. It took me till 23 to finally realise how utterly vacant those years were. And now i'm 24 and i'm finally addressing those problems.


God its so painful, so fucking painful but i'll be damned if i'll let it get the better of me any more. You can succumb to the feelings of diminished returns and sunk cost but that'll only keep that cycle going and then you can say you spent even more years depressed...


Cliche but an important idiom: The best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago, the second best time is right now. Giving in to the idea that its too late is just depression talking, don't let your past totally define who you are now, let what you do now define that."
lostbetween_,fdn8ug2,t3_elycos,"Yeah, I feel this. I am 21 and just starting my year 0 at university (basically like an access year so that I can go on to do my full bachelors). I ended up quitting Sixth Form in the first year because I was going through too much mentally. It has definitely set me back a few years, considering people in my year at school are now finishing university and I’m only just starting. However, I do think taking the time out has helped me and I’m already doing really well. I know what I want with life now and I think it’s been better this way. Especially considering I now have over three years of work experience, including managerial experience so I’m pretty well set up I like to believe."
xenaontheflipside,fdn9mjp,t3_elycos,"I would like to say that you are not the only one. I have graduated from university now and along with the end of the decade, I feel like crap looking at all the time and sleep spent on crying and trying to cope with the bare minimum requirements of being a student, a daughter or a friend. I only had the headspace to participate in things but never enough to take my hobbies one step further or make myself successful in them. I lost that ambitious Xena in me somewhere in between and now I am only just getting started on building my identity and life together again. 

It makes you feel like you could have done so much more than just scrapping through everything if the depression was not there in the first place. But I guess the turning point is realising that I need to find what was contributing to the depression and remove/resolve those things. Even if it is family or a close friend I've had in years. This was the only reason I could free myself from it and move on. 

I am 24 and I feel like I've only started puberty or something. I assure yo, it is never too late. At your own pace."

It does feel like there is no point to it.  It feels like it’s rigged somehow.  I’m not sure what to make of it.

rootlessindividual,fdplhko,t3_elycos,"I’m 28 and have been practising piano for 12 years now, first on my own, and then up until master’s degree in piano performance. It took me a hella a lot more time than required to complete my curriculum (not even finished yet) because of depression downs. A lot of colleagues and teachers never fully understood why I missed classes or why I was too tired to practice, etc. In short yeah, I have the legitimate feeling depression set me back a couple years and contributed to rocky, unconsistent academic performance. Piano is my passion really, I wish I could of have started younger but I had a single bipolar mom and she was an emotional train wreck thus I didn’t have proper education or encouragement towards my talents (I wouldn’t say I was gifted, but I showed great ease in music classes from a young age) or passions. Besides this setback I am now heavily indebted because of times I was so tired I couldn’t work or keep a job (I was on my own since 17 years old). Anyways, I keep a positive attitude and don’t give a f\*ck about debts or the past now I focus on the present and what I can improve and how I can learn more of what I love, and how I can become a positive influence on my relatives in general, and helping to others (as a form of purpose to my life).

I feel very unsettled with myself because I used to be known as a gifted kid but since I had really bad anxiety I didn't allow anyone to embrace it. I would be given opportunities to speak in front of crowds and I didn't take it. To join brilliant programs and I would make huge fusses about it.

I know there’s no perfect fix or anything. There’re many days I’d rather just lay in bed and forget the world exists.

Yea depression makes you feel like shit. Anxiety makes you struggle more than other. But don’t mop about it and say it set you back. Look at it and see what you need to learn and what you can do at that point of time. Think of how you would make your world a better place and a better feel than yesterday."

Took a couple years of doing nothing with my life to realize that they didn’t matter. I had to find happiness within myself and did what I wanted to do. To this day I’m not successful or have it figured out I actually work 2 full time jobs. I feel like the depression didn’t set you back, but it gave you a little lesson on how to help yourself out.

I can fully relate to that. I'm 27 and  10 years or so are those lost years. I actually did nothing over these years. I lost my all my friends, if I can call them like that, cuz they were quite toxic. I have been taking medications since then but my real therapy started two yeras ago. I decided to finally visit psychologists and talk and talk and talk. Of course in the meantime I made many mistakes but I could finally learn from them and get my shit together. Nowadays I'm having few days episodes when I cry and even want to kill myself but  for the next day I am still alive again and have power to move on. I don't want to waste my life anymore. I'm still going to therapist, taking meds. I don't know if I ever be happy again and feel like a normal person. Maybe it is ok to feel different, it makes us special, kind of ;)

Eight216,fdmllgp,t3_elycos,"Fuck. yes. so many people who've had cool ass life experiences and are generally comfortable interacting with others. 
 I don't 100% blame depression and I think of it more as actions taken on behalf of depression by me, because I don't want to avoid responsibility for what I've (or haven't) done but it still sucks and I wonder how much I could be done and seen if I wasn't just so.... Bleh."
Ce6,fdmmquv,t3_elycos,I personally didn’t do activities in school by my own choice I’d always get nervous or lots of anxiety before going out so I ended up just staying in. After highschool tho I went through a bad relation and that sent me down a dark depression period for about a year and a half. I felt it severely limited my self during the time looking back. It made me make so many bad decisions. Doing better now tho!
dazzling-tale,fdmmvw8,t3_elycos,"I completely get what you mean. I'm in my first year of university and I look around seeing so many people who are doing so much with their lives. I have some 'up' moments which seem to tell me that things are good and that I will be truly happy. But then that all gets ruined with my depressive episodes. I feel like it takes 3 times the amount of effort to do things that most people would find extremely simple, no matter whether that is taking the trash out or getting my notebook out to do work. I feel like I'm lagging behind everyone else, especially those days when I don't leave my room - time seems to go completely still."

Depression has the ability to hold you back from yourself. 

I'm leaving a career that I worked 5 years to build, a huge reason is because my depression and anxiety. Depression can set any person back. 

I've been trying to tell myself, this isn't the end. You have more to give! 

Remind yourself that you have more to give!"
ishadawn,fdms4qb,t3_elycos,I'm way too late but I've been thinking about this a lot lately. From 11 on and off until I turned 18 I was involuntarily hospitalized and during those years I learned nothing and the trauma of being locked up really stunned me. I feel like I'm still stumbling around. I have MDD and anxiety and being isolated in institutions away from every familiar safe thing only seems like it worked to train me for my life of being mentally I'll adult and hospitalizing myself. I'm on disability and basically  just isolate all the time because of my illness and I so deeply feel like a scared child
DrDougExeter,fdmsdzz,t3_elycos,It took my life from me so yeah I guess so...  It didn't just set me back it took it all away and I never caught up to anything.
Elusth,fdmvwbs,t3_elycos,"Yes. I'm a freshman in college, and a bit older than most in my class, but everyone I talk to seems more grown up and mature. I have issues being social and being an adult, but for everyone else its smooth sailing."
BenIsProbablyAngry,fdmz4cr,t3_elycos,"The only thing you're surrounded by is a lot of people you need to stop comparing yourself to. You'll have a million reasons why you should, vaguely hinting that it'll somehow motivate you, but actually all you're doing is sapping your own psychic energy.

You're not them,"
internally,fdmzrxl,t1_fdmz4cr,"This is kind of impossible. The more I put myself out there, the more I'm exposed to people more experienced than me. But this is probably for the best."
BenIsProbablyAngry,fdn2eyp,t1_fdmzrxl,"It's not impossible. Do you think everyone you are around is looking at you and comparing themselves to you, whether to think themselves better or worse?

No. People who compare pathologically become ill with worry and feelings of inferiority. The people who aren't crippled in the way you are literally aren't comparing themselves to you or really anyone else. Inferiority and superiority complexes arise out of this comparison; if people don't have them, it means simply that they don't do it.

You're the same mechanism as they are. You are no more obliged to compare yourself to others in the way you did in this post than they are. You simply need to stop doing it. Even your language belies this is your true problem; you equate simply being exposed to people as needing to compare yourself to them, and you only describe this negatively (meaning you only do it to make yourself feel inferior).

The book ""The Courage to be Disliked"" is about fixing this problem. It would be a useful read to you, because right now you think the symptom of your problem is the cause, which means you'll constantly be asking yourself ""why can't I do/think/feel x"" discovering you can't explain your own behaviour at-all."

Somedays I still feel like a failure, but that's me pushing myself harder than necessary. My brand of depression. Having said that... My IQ test came back with high results, I corrected my teachers and my memory is beyond the typical. 

My point is, wisdom doesn't come out of being a good student in a good college in a good country... wisdom comes out of being the best you when you face difficulties and learning from that. Sure wise people are often learned, but not every learned person is wise. Those people at your college probably are not wise, they may be smart and may had had it easier than you did. You'll be ok."

MindfulCoffee,fdzel8d,t3_enfyh1,"I believe the term is Distorted Thinking. It takes many forms, but one is making assumptions without evidence. In addition, depression makes you see things in a negative light. This can lead to mistrust of other people and yourself. You assume that others aren't sincere, and you don't see yourself as worthy of their friendship either. 

The best way I've found to deal with this is to look at the evidence I do have. Maybe I have an awkward conversation with someone that makes me think they must hate me on the inside. But then I think back to past interactions and remember that they helped me out last week without me asking, and that's stronger evidence that they like me rather than an awkward conversation meaning they hate me."
drivenbyorcrippledby,fdzkyu2,t1_fdzel8d,"In my head I just jump from one to the other- well they were so nice so obviously we are good friends/ well they ignored my message so clearly they hate me and I’m a total idiot for thinking otherwise.

SureNarwhal,fe5uw92,t1_fdzel8d,"The problem is, though, when you have so much past experience with people not liking you and being horrible human beings...the evidence says that they will never like you, you should never trust them, they are always horrible, etc.  It's not distorted thinking when it's true, afterall."
MindfulCoffee,fdzpn8v,t1_fdzkyu2,I totally get it. It's so frustrating when you can't even trust yourself. :(
thr0w4w4y_666,fe05ycz,t1_fdzkyu2,"I struggle w this too. I think its natural for us to guess how people are and what they think about you if you dont know them enough to an extent. ButvIt can be dangerous because you could create something from nothing sometimes and youre in your head about something that isnt even going on. I say if you dont know, it isnt your business until someone makes it your business. Leave the ball in their court to show whether they like you or not and keep everything face value. Now What if someone actually doesnt like you. Then what? Thats where you gotta like yourself enough to forgive yourself for your own mistakes if you made any or just say hey i did what i could and i was just being myself. you really dont need anyone to like you if you already appreciate those that already do. And yourself counts."
dreamofdreamcatcher,fe0bpsp,t1_fdzkyu2,"Honestly same. My head bounces between ""you should keep being friends so you don't whine about being lonely"" and ""well you're a boring person anyways, so what friends would care about you?"". So frustrating :("
EhManana,fe1iwzz,t1_fdzkyu2,"This hits the nail 100% on the head.   


My friend was pretty upfront like the first time we hung out - ""if I ignore your messages, don't take it personally, it's me, not you"", they too fall under the sad boi gang.  


not so much a ""problem"" but if I have the slightest thought that I may have offended/insulted/otherwise harmed them whether its an awkward conversation or w/e I'll apologize/make amends for it, like they have been NOTHING but just WICKED GOOD and a chill ass person to just shoot the shit with it, A I wouldn't want to toss that away, fuck that, and B I would NEVER, EVER want to do any ""bad"" to someone who's just been.... so good, they get life for what it is and it's so awesome to be able to talk w/ someone who GETS it.   


it's hard sometimes cause I def fall under the feeling 'not worthy' category, and I hate that I still have the ""are they doing this because they feel bad/think its funny"" thoughts once in a blue moon, but they've definitely subsided and gotten less, for sure, but being stuck in that rabbit hole of ""what if"" stinks. like they're just a good friend, and I don't want to mess with that or fuck it up, that's all..."

MindfulCoffee,fe2x94h,t1_fe2gkz6,"That's the time to seek outside help. I've been in therapy for three years and only in the past few months have started to get better at this. You literally have to retrain your brain, and it's hard work. Like if you decided to use your left hand instead of your right. You're fighting habits that have built up over a long period of time without you even noticing them, and it's going to be uncomfortable, unpleasant and awkward, but it is possible. Having someone like a therapist to give guidance can make a big difference."

BedlamAndBoomsticks,fe01k5k,t3_enfyh1,"Depression and anxiety color the way we see everything. It magnifies the dark, distorts the light and makes us think that people hate us or are angry with us over the smallest things. Sometimes even one tiny gesture, or lack of a gesture, can have us questioning everything. I know it's scary, but sometimes the best thing to do is just to ask them. When I was depressed, I literally have asked some of my best friends ""do you like me"" so many times I thought I was going to drive them nuts. But, being best friends, they reassured me every time. And the people who didn't say yes? Meh. They were on their own journey. Everyone's path is different. Maybe I'll see them again, maybe I won't, but to be happy now, I keep the focus on myself and my own path."

rosins20,fe08t9m,t3_enfyh1,"Whenever I find myself having these thoughts, I think of myself as an outside person. For example: if this person told me they had to cancel plans because they are sick, would I be angry? Of course not. Therefore, if I had to cancel plans, I know it is not rational to think that someone would be upset. You have to rationalize and like others said, use evidence you do have.

For me it stemmed from my realizing that I was somehow different than they they were, but how different?  Maybe I am a curious observation to them, an alien in a person suit who doesn't know he's from another planet.

The therapist I eventually was lucky enough to find has spent decades studying non-verbal communication clues and the way he put it ""I have spent over 25 years studying what people says without words, what their body language means, things they say when they are saying something different and if I guess what someone is thinking I am going to be wrong 85% of the time.   Without all that training what chance do you think you have of guessing correctly?""

If you have something that someone else need...probably they will act friendly towards you. The problem is that whenever they obtain what they need,  they all leave because the main reason they liked you in the first place simply isn’t there anymore.

MagistrateDeTemps,fe2uyss,t3_enfyh1,"I have the same problem. Like MindfulCoffee said, its distorted thinking.

I am not a therapist or anything but I have been dealing with this issue myself and I found that this helps me. I write this on a piece of paper in my small notebook that I keep with me:

1. Do they talk to me kindly and frequently?
2. Are they engaged in conversation with me?
3. Despite any past mess ups or odd comments, do they still talk to me?
4. Do they ever attempt to quickly get away from me/the conversation quite often? (Keeping the fact that they might be busy in mind)

If yes (no to the last one), then they do not mind your company and do not think you are a burden to them. 

I don't know if this has happened to you OP, but I had my fair share of friendships where I thought we were great together but it turns out they hated me the entire time. THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT. THEY are the ones being snakes. Whatever they say to you is immediately thrown out the window because they are the ones being rude and terrible. 

Hope this helps somewhat. Sometimes it helps to physically write this down or physically stop and go through the steps."

We had been talking earlier about a coworker (Charlie) who had made a really presumptuous comment toward me that had ruined me for the better part of that week. It had led to me thinking that everyone else at work hated me. She listened for a bit, then she essentially asked me how my presuming to know the thoughts of other people, to ascribe feelings to them that I have no evidence of, isn’t more presumptuous and arrogant than the thing I was upset about.

Having someone call out my bullshit as “arrogant” was such a wake-up slap. Easily, the single most helpful moment I’ve spent in therapy.

One girl literally asked me if I thought she looked better with her skirt on or off, and I told her to do whatever makes her comfortable because that's what's most important. She proceeded to literally start undressing in front of me and gave me her phone to add her number and I didnt even put it in correctly because I apparently forgot how to fucking make a new contact and didnt wanna ask.

It is exhausting . It is horrible. It makes every day feel so shit.

zryan3564,fe20p6q,t3_enfyh1,My guess is our brains aren'treceivng or sending signals correctly because of depression. That's why people with depression are constantly thinking negatively. Your brain wants to make neurons with positive thoughts but because of a chemical imbalance in the brain it can't do that.  Some depression medicine helps by balancing the chemicals so neurons can branch and bring back positive thoughts.  My psychiatrist explain the neuron thing to me the other day after I asked how my meds work. It was a very simplistic explanation but I for got it.

She didn't care much about me, as I was only for a few days there in her town and not many hours to spend together, she talked more with her other buddies. And it goes on and on.

We have a two year old daughter. I just graduated college and all of my plans for graduation have fallen apart, I’ve been rejected from every fellowship I’ve applied to and interviewed for. I had a surgery two years ago that still is bothering me with complications. 

I can’t tell my wife, the only person I used to talk to about my depression or if I’m feeling suicidal.

I’m so tired of feeling this way. I’m in so much pain all of the time. I feel completely and utterly humiliated. I just want the pain to stop. Please help me. I can’t take this anymore. Please. I don’t know what to do. Fuck.

I don’t want to lose my daughter. I love her so much. I’m just so lonely, scared, and hurt. I just want the pain to stop. I don’t want to deal with this pain anymore. 

Is there a point when it’s okay to stop? I loved my wife so much, she was everything to me. 

I feel so broken.

Edit: I have read every single comment on my post, and deeply appreciate all of your support. You’re all channeling the anger I’ve been suppressing for a few weeks now.

The parent that is awarded custody is the only person who can make the decisions for the child that affect the child's life.  Not the parent with visitation privileges.

Maybe ask r/legaladvice. I don't know.

If you have a bad relationship with your wife, the best thing is to go ahead with the divorce. There's nothing worse (besides abuse) than growing up with parents who hate each other but refuse to split up. It's a hard thing to accept, but things will simmer down eventually - you can find another partner, and other reasons to live - and it's for the best. Life is like an obstacle course, you might get used to jumping hurdles but every now and then something will swing down and hit you in the face for no reason and send you flying. You'll end up on the floor hundreds of meters back wondering ""why the fuck am I even trying?"" but every now and then the path clears and becomes so beautiful you can't help but carry on. Talking to people who know the path can help you find the good bits and help you reach them - talking is soso important - but you still have to acknowledge your inherent value, the sheer beauty of your existence and your daughters existence to be motivated to carry on.  Shitty and mediocre metaphor, I know, but essentially, carrying on is worth it. If not for yourself, then for your daughter. 

I feel like this won't be helpful at all, but I'm just thinking out loud here. Your wife is 100% in the wrong here. None of this is your fault, please remember that. I wish you the best of luck, whatever happens."
Chewingyourmomspussy,fdqtq5k,t1_fdq34ea,">There's nothing worse (besides abuse) than growing up with parents who hate each other but refuse to split up.

True. My parents haven't had a functioning relationship for most of my life. It sucks to be stuck in the middle of two parents hating eachother. I love both my parents, but I hate to listen to them, complaining about eachother all the fucking time. I think growing up under these circumstances is one of the reasons, I've got so many issues today. Please, for the sake of your children and yourself end the relationship, if you stop loving eachother.

Keep it equal for how we treat the boys and the girls in 2020 instead of rewarding her with full custody of a kid she has already failed. - but that's not the kind of equality women want.

In the US, I do think cheating is illegal in some states though, where you can actually sue the person who committed adulatory. That being said, I feel like cheating should be illegal everywhere, because the paperwork and etc costs so much; if a person cheats they should have to pay the other person all the money it costed to get married along with all the fees for divorce 🤔."
The1r1shSt0n3r,fdqfi7z,t1_fdq8hzx,Adultery is a common theme in at fault divorce in the US and does give higher chance of the party getting a higher amount of custody
MeImDraven,fdqav5o,t1_fdq9gfs,"Basic statistics. There's thousands of articles too, it pretty much makes it impossible for the kid to trust that parent as much as the faithful one ever again. Google it if you want.

Would you trust your parent who knowingly cheated understanding the harm it would cause more than your parent who was faithful? Its also a reoccurring personality trait of sociopathic-like behavior, so that parent who cheated is also the one who will give more false promises and perform more actions which walk over the child's feelings."
Eddwo12,fdsm0d4,t1_fds2fhw,"It's not a wounded ego. She is controlling, manipulative and abusive and that sort of person shouldn't have access to children. 

Growing in a house with domestic violence damages kids. Teaches them its either okay to treat someone like that or will just fucking terrify them.

If this was the other way around you'd be advising she protect herself from the a controlling dude and report the abuse to the police, get a lawyer and get sole custody.

This isn't about the fact she slept with someone else, it's the blackmail, and abuse that followed. The fact she is using her kid as collateral to get approval to keep on doing things op would rather she didn't.

This isn't a wounded ego, I'm sorry. This is a dangerous situation for op and his baby. Contrary to popular belief, domestic abuse can happen to men as well."

You're being dismissive as fuck saying that the only problem here is that op is butt hurt because his lady fancied some strange. You're also missing the point entirely of you think the only problem identified in Ops post is the cheating. Yes, that's bad enough, but did you not notice the abuse? Or just not make the connection because the victim has a penis? Maybe it's just not as important if the abuser is a woman? It's 2020! Anything the boys can do the girls can do better? 

Abuse isn't just physical violence. Abuse isn't just perpetrated by entitled white men with mummy issues. This is a classic case and I'd be willing to bet if one of your girlfriends said her bf was fucking girls behind her back and threatened to take their kid if she did anything about it you'd take action. So why is it that this absolute cunt just a bad ass boss bitch living her best life?"

Yet your advice to this guy is simply ""get over it, bro"". This is so fucking typical. Everyone wants equality, until it's time for a man to be protected.

Well guess what, you're not second-hand goods. You're amazing and you don't have to be stuck with a liar, a cheater, or someone who treats you any less than you deserve. Your kid will 100% still love you growing up and as they age, trust me, they'll see everything; they could either pity you for staying with her while they despise their mom, or they could be proud of you for leaving her and standing your ground, while also seeing their mother's mistakes, but still respect both of you.

If you don't want an open relationship, don't give in to that bs, a parent shouldn't have to worry about STDs or their wife getting pregnant by another guy, that's too immature for someone who has a kid to have to deal with.

My ex was mentally, verbally, and emotionally abusive; she lied about me to everyone around her to make me seem like a bad person then had sex with some random guy a week after she broke up with me based on fabricated stories that she and her mother+grandfather made up about me. Now shes calling me about 100 times each month and constantly searching me on social media and I have her blocked on just about everything, the reason she is reaching out to me is because I'm worth more, relationship-wise. I'm faithful, I don't lie, I'm honest, I try my best to do the right thing. You're the same.

Take the divorce with pride and don't look back, thats not right for her to lie about that, its not right for you to force her to stay with you, and most of all its not right for her to knowingly do something that hurts you. You deserve better!"

I know it hurts, I know you loved your wife dearly, but don't ruminate on it.

You're daughter won't think less of you, for doing what's best for you."
the_ape_speaks,fdrulxu,t1_fdpv1v0,"Even if he is okay with an open marriage, this one needs to end. She clearly doesn't respect him enough not to betray his trust. She's a manipulative psychopath and a cheater."
musihn01,fdrctbg,t3_emnbdm,"If she is open to it, would you consider couples counseling? I know everyone is quick to bash a cheater, but I truly believe that if someone cheats, it’s because they’re lacking something that they need in a relationship. I’ve never cheated on my husband, but the only time the thought even ENTERED my mind that I could find affection elsewhere, was after 2 and a half years of basically no affection, no sex, etc. (not saying your marriage was like this, just using it as an example). I would bring it up constantly, and he would basically tell me there were no issues and that I was making it up. If I asked for some kind of affection from him, he would maybe for a day, and then go back to isolating himself. I practically begged for our sex life to become existent again, nothing would change. I felt single even though I was married, and just lonely. I felt dismissed and rejected at all times, and it felt like my feelings didn’t matter to him at all, felt completely unloved. I had never been more insecure in a relationship than I was during that part of our marriage. He truly is a wonderful guy, and never has bad intentions. We are just very different people with very different needs. If she wants an open relationship, I really think that the relationship should either end, or you should try counseling to figure out what you BOTH need from each other that either of you aren’t getting. Rather than focusing on being open and having new relationships with others, re-focus on each other! The only thing I’ll say about marriage counseling, that I wish someone would’ve said to us, is that you can’t go into it with the mindset of her having wronged you and that you’re going to counseling to fix what SHE did to you. There could be so many reasons she did what she did. It wasn’t justified and was definitely not okay, but that can’t be the focus of it. You can’t go into it saying like “I was the best husband and did everything I could and you cheated.” You have to go in with a strong desire to learn how to love her better in a way that she needs (maybe she’s tried telling you in the past and you just both weren’t on the same page). And she needs to go into it wanting to learn how to communicate with you better if there’s something she needs from you that she isn’t getting, and learn to talk to you more before just taking the easy way out and finding it with someone else. Even if you try and it doesn’t work, at least you tried. If you think you’d be able to regain trust, that is. 

I know a lot of people will disagree with all of that. I definitely think there are people out there who just cheat no matter who they’re with. But there are also situations where there are things lacking and there’s not enough communication. Its easy to look at marriage from the outside and say “anyone who cheats is a piece of shit,” but if you feel lost and alone in a relationship, I can see how it could happen. Like I said, I never felt more alone than I did during the time where my relationship with my husband was very rough, and when I told him how I felt, he basically didn’t acknowledge it for a really long time. So I was trapped somewhere in a situation with someone who I thought didn’t love me. I can see how if certain situations go on for too long, even situations different than mine, it could cause people to act in ways they usually wouldn’t. 

If you divorced, do you think your wife is the type of person to take your daughter away? I truly hope not. But if she does, please fight it. Please don’t give up, don’t do anything impulsive, and please don’t hurt yourself. I know you didn’t say you were going to, but it feels like that’s what you were implying. You have the best thing to live for-your little girl. And it only gets more and more rewarding as they age. I promise you don’t want to miss that."
Sbeven_Spooniverse,fdrkezl,t3_emnbdm,"I say go with a divorce. If you have enough evidence, you may win custody. You also ask for advice from r/legaladvice and r/MensRights"
bingedrinkr,fdrska3,t3_emnbdm,"My advice to you is to forgive and move on. I've also been hurt, I've also forgiven the person who hurt me. It is a horrible feeling that no matter what you do it will linger for weeks or months. But you should take it one day at a time. 

I also think that forgiving can make you a better person. Don't try to get revenge, I've done it and I still regret it. If you can go to therapy with your wife, go. It will help a lot.

If you don't agree with what your wife is trying to do, then it is time to walk away. Whatever happens, try putting your daughter first before making a decision..."
JakeTheHuman83,fds1xly,t3_emnbdm,"There’s some decent advice about talking to a lawyer here but I think more importantly than that: please see a therapist. You owe it to your daughter to be the best you can be, and that doesn’t have to mean you’re perfect, just that you remain alive and in her life. As for the work thing, if you can’t find something in you’re field, try looking for some local office work in the interim. Keep looking, but don’t be needlessly unemployed as that will hurt both you and your court case if she’s the sole “breadwinner”."

EDIT: it might be worth recording all your texts and conversations (maybe in secret?) and keeping copies. If there will be a custody and divorce battle, it will help you. Consult a lawyer asap. I know you're broken, but you need to do this man. You can do it."

Sounds absolutely horrible! Do you have legal insurance? Sounds like I would try to fight for the kid's custody and with evidence that she was blackmailing you that might even work out.

Anyways: I cannot imagine how this relationship  is supposed to go on in a positive way. To me it's a clear catch 22. I could not accept her forcing me to accept something I did not want to (especially after basically being betrayed).

Try to focus on you and yourself only! Look for what option is the most promising for your own personal future. I know this situation fells terrible and combined with your other health issues and depression as well as collapsed plan for the future I totally understand to just not be able to take it anymore.  
But trust me, you can do it. Try to get help, if you cannot afford therapy, try a self help group, for divorces/marriage problems or depression or both. Or if it is an emergency and you feel totally hopeless and no one is accessible, please always call your national helpline for such crises! These people are very happy to help!

If she went as low as to do that understand she will never come back to you again and that she already in her mind has lost respect for you as a man. I'm sorry but this situation simply cannot be repaired unless a miracle of some sort. Given that information, what I would personally do is go along with the open relationship negotiation and see other women myself. No problem. If you don't have the heart to do that kind of thing, I'd say battle to take custody of your daughter and divorce but only if your odds in winning are higher than hers, otherwise forget it. These seem to be your only two options, and I also would not suggest telling anyone about this situation unless it becomes legal as even family can spread rumors like a house fire. Best of luck man, I hope you choose wisely."
DisabledMuse,fdpxziq,t3_emnbdm,That's messed up. Doesn't sound like someone you want to keep around to be honest. But as she is the one cheating you have a better than average chance of getting full or partial custody of your daughter I believe? I'd check with a lawyer about it. Only open up your relationship if you feel comfortable with it and she agrees to couples counseling. I've seen too many monogamous people dragged through poly and it's never a pretty sight.
InspectorHornswaggle,fdq5cm4,t3_emnbdm,"Leave her, she cheated on you AND is treating you like shit as a way of gaslighting you. This has gone from 'simple' infidelity to an abusive relationship.  
 
Get out, get away, go somewhere mentally safe and start to process it all. Yes, you'll want a divorce, but you need to look after yourself right now. 

Go to your parents or your current best friend or your old neighbors from when you were a kid, whatever, just people you trust, tell them what has happened, they'll look after you. 

You're going to need time and support, that's ok.

That's a major pet peeve for my therapist, who is Christian - fellow Christians telling her that her profession is bogus,  that therapy isn't needed and all you need to get better is to pray so that God can heal you. Like, I've heard prayer group leaders and priests repeat constantly that we should let God do as He wishes, the way he wants to, and yet people insist that if you're depressed,  there's no way God may want you to go to therapy and take meds.

It’s not only until they’re faced with situations that require more than just believing in a story (Jesus) that they realize mental illness is more than just praying. Can’t really blame them, but I’m also not going to put myself there to hear all that because it causes me more damage than good - and I start to subconsciously blame myself for not being faithful and happy like i used to be when I was a little girl. Hope this makes sense to someone."

OhMyFucikngWhuut,fe5koof,t3_eno7v3,"I found peace in science.

The fact that energy can not be created nor destroyed helps me feel like even when I die, the energy that runs me will be transferred into a different form.

I know my consciousness might be gone, I have no real opinions on the afterlife at all, but at least a part of what I was will continue throughout all of existence. 

I think they just try to push religion because it’s true. It will make you feel better. It gives you this big fuck in the sky that is in control of everything good and a bad guy in the ground that is to blame for all your negative thoughts and behaviors. It’s easy to be religious because you don’t have to accept you’re in control of anything. “God has a plan and if you slip up, it’s the devil influencing it.” 

It’s such a blindness that I refuse to allow into my life or home (unless my children decide they want to be Christians some day due to their own personal findings... but, let’s fucking hope not. Lmao!) plus, the abrahamic religions preach violence, pedophilia, genocide, rape, killing babies, killing children... pretty much raping and killing anything that has differing beliefs... even the fucking horses. It’s fucked.

I think it’s best to just figure out what gives you peace. If no after life gives you peace, of believing your energy will continue on gives you peace, if finding religion gives you peace, or if ignoring it completely gives you peace, do it! Don’t let anyone take your peace because we’re all entitled to find peace and happiness in our lives, so long as it doesn’t harm anyone else.

I truly hope you’re able to find a reason to continue on and happiness finds you. I’ve struggled with depression, PTSD, and anxiety for as long as I can remember and have attempted suicide in my past. I’m genuinely happy that it failed because my life is finally at the point where it’s taking a turn for the better and has been for a while. I’m hoping this for you as well. 

Much love! Sending positive vibes of peace and love!"

If I would just give in to the dumb ass belief that there is a God and everything is going to plan then I would not have arrived at this conundrum.

It’s like someone trying to get you to do a line or shoot up heroin. It’s an addiction they have and they want to share it. The religious people want you to feel their “high” that they get when in “connection” with the lord.

Bigbaby22,fe59jox,t3_eno7v3,"That's the problem... 

  It's not magic. Christ isn't going to just take away your troubles. He's not going to protect you from everything negative. But He will be there to give you strength. To offer relief for a time. To show and tell you what changes you need to make in order to achieve a happier and healthier life. 

  The most important thing is that He has experienced everything you have. He has felt all of your pains. And He can help you endure. 

  The other aspect is that by being around people you can also find relief and fellowship and love. If nothing else, believe in that. Take part in volunteer and service opportunities. One of the best ways to ease your pain is to serve others. 

  I hope this helps. Church or religion isn't a cure. I hate that misconception that so many believers peddle. I can attest that it isn't. I've attended Church all my life, both by parental obligation and now because I choose to. I'm sitting in church right now and I feel like I don't exist. I feel so lonely and empty.

I understand many find comfort in the idea of surrendering control and accepting that you can’t engineer every event/outcome in your life, which is true, but many religious people do not acknowledge how much more complex it is than that. They don’t think about the 3 different providers you’ve been to in the last year, the 3rd med you’ve tried that doesn’t fucking work either, the people who talk to you like you’re a POS for self-medicating to catch a break—or tell you that you just have to push yourself to feel better.

Because faith and spirituality is different from religion.

My parents blamed my depression on stopping going to church. I was a believer as a kid, but even not wanting to go to church sometimes wasn't an option or there would be physical consequences.

I did go to a Christmas gathering with my large family a couple years ago and felt pretty awkward there with all the Christian songs I was expected to sing (I don't feel comfortable singing, period) and the Bible verses.

VannaDominion,fe6ml6l,t3_eno7v3,"It doesn't solve your problems by making you happy. Finding Yah opens your eyes to the evils of this world. On top of being depressed it scares you. Eventually you will come to an acceptance that ypu are not running the show. That the most high loves you, died for you and wants you in his kingdom.  How many people are willing to die for you? How often do you feel like noone gives a crap about you? He does and wants you to be woke and have a personal relationship with him. ♡♡♡"
FoodCoopPres,fe6mvzj,t3_eno7v3,"I'm sorry you're finding this lack of understanding.  As a serious Christian myself, who also had a bout of depression at one time, I realize this is not a simple issue.  There are so many causes of depression, not all of them related to spiritual issues.  If depression has a physical cause, a physical solution is needed.  That's not necessarily medication, either.  Nutrition and exercise are both important.  See [mercola.com](https://mercola.com) for many articles about depression.  No matter the cause, while God does sometimes perform a miraculous healing, we can't count on that; it's not always His plan.  There might also be multiple causes.  For me, the physical catalyst was a traumatic childbirth with unnecessary surgery.  But added to that was anger.  I needed physical healing, but I also had to address the anger.  So there was a spiritual component, but just praying wasn't enough even for that.  Please try to be patient with people who just don't know the whole score and think they are being helpful.  I hope that you  will find the answers and healing that you need."

And it was a solid speech, i was honestly enlightened but then they ended with, ""but remember whatever you do... you can always trust in God to fix those problems. Have faith, and trust God with your pain."" I literally deflated. They said nothing about therapy, or talking to anyone, or any advice really.  Just hit up the big G up there. Cool."

I'm not in that group anymore, but I feel the experience was worth it. It's all about balance. If you' re not a believer it's no big deal most of the time. I don't know how it works in US thought.

Just ask then why, if religion hasn't even cured them of the urge to stick their noses I to your business, what chance does it have against depression?

Ironically, what they are doing is constantly trying to dominate you with the message ""we are better than you because we have religion"", which invites precisely the type of shame-based self comparison that does cause depression.

I suspect that if you could look into their lives you'd find they have much more profound mental health problems than you, as they complete in a hopeless struggle to be seen as ""the most religious"" amongst everyone around them, seething at those who appear moreso and cruelly denigrating those they see as less-so."

But Joel Osteen has a very obvious goal; money. He isn't trying to dominate people with religion, he is trying to *get their money* (which includes simply raising his own profile), something he succeeds at grandly.

OP's family have a much more horrible goal; dominating and degrading a depressed person to make themselves feel like they're superior. If they weren't religious they'd be telling him to get a job, or to pick up running, or to embrace veganism, or whatever other moronic thing they like to beat people over the head with. 

It's a foul mindset and it really isn't hard to see how a person could end up depressed surrounded by such idiocy."

LeReux,fe84ovq,t3_eno7v3,"I can tell you my experience with this, and I can relate to what your saying, and yeah I thought about that as well when I was young, and for most of life I was depressed and growing up with a religious family, they always brought me to church like 6am in the morning... And I tried my best not to sleep or else my grandparents would scold me for doing so, and they would always bring me to church not only on Sundays but whenever they possibly can, but also growing up in a Catholic school for 12 years of my life... And what you are saying is true. When I was depressed I prayed and begged the Lord to make it stop and it did not it led to a point where I was deeply depressed that I begged the Lord to kill me, and yet I'm still here. I'm not a perfect Catholic, I've had my fair share of frustration with Christ, sins that I committed that I am far too ashamed of telling a soul, screaming and yelling why am I like this. And still to this day I still praise God even though my life is shit. When I was young I was molested by my barber when I was in 3rd grade, growing up I never had a father, my family was poor where in some occasions we shared one fish for the 3 of us, I had an abusive drunkard uncle, my mom was out of town so I had to stay with my over religious grandparents, and never had that many friends in school and my junior high years where I was occasionally bullied. But regardless of how much I didn't like it, I worship a God not because of what He does, but who He is. Christ isn't magic where all my problems would get fixed, but He let it happen and I will be honest I hated my life and attempted suicide 4 times because I hated my life and at some point frustrated with the Lord. And yet I'm still here, I finally understood that my life was like this and stopped blaming Jesus or my religion, when my life is again falling apart I tell my self ""God's knocking on my door again"" the moment when you start a relationship with God, automatically there's a bullseye on you, and when a Christian or Catholic says my life is with the Lord, they're liars. That's all it's just a piece of my experience with my religion and God..."

It could be that your lack of direction and/or desire isn't an inherent fault in your psyche but rather a shortcoming of your external environment. Are there ways in which you could restructure your life so that meaning, purpose, and intensity of emotion came into existence organically? There are certain circumstances in which life and vibrance manifest themselves so intensely that nothingness, nihilism, and meaninglessness struggle to take up space in your consciousness. 

Perhaps you owe it to yourself to know what life would be like if you altered your external environment."

Sure I can work at a job, I can play games, I can go out and have fun every now and again but deep inside my emotion is pain. It's like your not really having fun like people think you are.

""Hi can I take your order, please. What can I get you today"" (smiles), takes payment, customer leaves \[thoughts in my head feel sad - 'ughhh'\]

Everything is a distraction but now its not really working anymore for me. I wake up and I can't physically go and play a game because the thoughts and emotions are too strong to care.

Risay117,fe1vf5d,t1_fdzzxq8,"Ehh, if they can't watch it maybe we should not convince them to."
DrDougExeter,fe1oted,t1_fdzzxq8,ok but what if I love the joker?
tremendoyarna420,fe07rrn,t1_fe06vuk,Yup also “the worst part about having a mental illness is that everyone wants you to pretend like you don’t” ‼️‼️
TheMantis17,fe0aalw,t1_fe06vuk,"I *loved* Joker for that reason. As a victim of bullying, it brought me such joy to see critics and people scared after watching that movie,

Why you may ask? Because they should be. Monsters aren’t born, they’re created. People need to be aware that the monsters they create are likely thinking about them."
UniThrow98,fe319p2,t1_fe06vuk,Username checks out
tremendoyarna420,fe0z2zy,t1_fe0xpzu,"Yeah that’s what I meant also. Available sufficient Help needs to be provided in our society. If not a psychologist, maybe a good friend? What if that neighbour chick ever gave 5 seconds of her day to talk to him? What if neighbours were kind to each other and took care of each other?"
tremendoyarna420,fe1vu53,t1_fe1vf5d,"No one is convincing them, just that it seems they fear they are JUST like joker but they are not because if they were they would be busy killing people outside instead of posting on reddit 🤣 they can relate to the depression and mental illness part. Which we are SUPPOSE to relate to because of reasons I explained in my OG answer 😅"
tremendoyarna420,fe1q7sc,t1_fe1oted,"Joker wouldn’t care. He turned his human off when he killed his mother so he no longer would  have anything to lose so he allowed himself to become a monsters that was easier for his damage soul to be. He wouldn’t understand or care for your love as love is a human feeling. He would kill you, your parents, your kids, destroy anything that’s important to you just because he feels like it 🤷🏾‍♀️ that’s who joker is! The Villain we love to see because of his wicketness. The joker showed in suicide squad where joker actually cares for harleys feeling was such a joke and unlike his character which is also why the movie flopped."
tells_you_hard_truth,fe0hb9m,t1_fe0aalw,Exactly.
hoshi___,fe06uyd,t3_engd6e,"Tbh I unexpectedly shed a few tears in the first few minutes. Yeah it is relatable, maybe that’s why I enjoyed the movie a lot more. I disagree with his actions but I still feel bad for him. Kinda sad how if you don’t clarify that, people for some reason think you glorify the joker lmao."
-stonedbaloney,fdzq3lz,t3_engd6e,I havent tried watching it yet. Scared to
pandorasbox71,fdzu35o,t1_fdzq3lz,I’m just too close to the edge of that spiral looking down right now. I think/hope that from the other side of this cycle I will be able to watch it and appreciate it.
telbu1,fe04c4q,t3_engd6e,"I haven’t watched it yet, but I’m going to before I off myself"
pandorasbox71,fe07ags,t1_fe04c4q,Dark humor perhaps?
OnePieceJunge,fe05l6d,t3_engd6e,Definitely worth finishing. It's the most cathartic movie I've ever seen.
AllieKyle,fe08vfy,t3_engd6e,"Watched it when I was extremely in denial something was wrong with me. Oof that was a mistake lol

It's oddly both triggering and comforting. Was it like that for anyone else?"
WeirdNameGuy28,fe091gh,t3_engd6e,"I get what you're going through. I remember just being glued to the screen. But the time after it, I just felt like a hollow shell. It scared me, because I just saw myself in it. It was a reflection, like looking into a mirror. And if you feel the same way, then talk to someone about it. Cause it's not healthy. 

The Joker's just a dark reflection of our inner and outer alienation from society. Don't give into it. Don't sympathise with Joker. You aren't meant to."
Coldlostsoul,fe02f1g,t3_engd6e,I watched that movie 7 times because of how much I relate and recognize everything. Honestly I haven’t had a favourite movie until the joker came out and had chills throughout the whole movie.
usualfuckingidiot,fe0ciy7,t3_engd6e,"""I just don't want to feel so bad anymore"""
BedlamAndBoomsticks,fe01qzy,t3_engd6e,"I hear it was written with that very hook in mind. It wants to be relatable to those who have gone through mental health issues, so it is. I understand not being able to watch it though. Sometimes the weirdest things can trigger us (though being triggered by something that is kinda supposed to trigger those feelings isn't particularly weird to me)."
whatmoneycantfix,fe09itc,t3_engd6e,"I actually found it cathartic and enjoyable to watch. There was a time when sad things would trigger me and I would avoid them to not think about anything too raw and serious. But now as I'm healing watching someone go through similar things is just validating and doesn't hurt I feel empathy and a connection to them that calms me. Seeing people who are hyper or very happy is what triggers me now to doubt myself. What he has is not just depression but eccentric behavior he can't control that I relate to. His quotes were the most powerful to me that I resonated with the most. Like during his scenes with his social worker or therapist. I'm impressed that a director known for the most ridiculous of comedies can do such a serious and raw film. When I first saw it I was sitting closer to the screen in the theater and it really pulled me in. It's one of my top movies now.

&#x200B;

I understand what you mean when you say it feels like an emotion physically hurts. Emotions can be so powerful that it feels like psychical pain. I've had those times a lot before and it almost feels like you're dissociating because you feel so absorbed in that emotion and you can't always put a name to what it is."
mycouriousmind,fe06cy9,t3_engd6e,I broke into tears when I watched it. It was so relatable to the situation I am in.
hotsalsapants,fe02b3g,t3_engd6e,I don’t plan on watching it. It’s just to real.
mariaj97,fe02cx5,t3_engd6e,I watched the movie before I relapsed and even then it was a bit disturbing.
pandorasbox71,fe0osx7,t1_fe02cx5,How are you now?
mariaj97,fe3l9rp,t1_fe0osx7,"Struggling, but I’d still watch it again because otherwise, it would feel as if I’m trying to escape the reality of my illness. Idk about how I would feel afterwards though."
penniwysee,fe06vjw,t3_engd6e,"I related to the depression parts, but when people bullied him it felt a little excessive and unrealistic. People usually don't just beat the shit out of you for no reason"
whatmoneycantfix,fe09x99,t1_fe06vjw,I think those kids beat him up because they wanted to take his money or because they wanted feel tough it's more common than you might think. I would say more about the movies real or unrealistic scenes but I don't want to spoil anything.
Mermerman10,fe09ql6,t1_fe06vjw,I have been jumped before for literally no reason by guys I've never seen before. I think it depends on where you live cuase I was in philadelphia at the time.
ihatelifetoo,fe0pmlj,t1_fe06vjw,"It’s completely realistic, most kids that get bullied are often the quiet kid that leaves everyone alone"
newuser0722,fe5m9ng,t1_fe09ql6,"I was always confused by this criticism (I've seen a lot of other people make this point before) but I think you're right, it probably does have a lot to do with where you live.

I'm from Philly as well and honestly nothing Arthur went through would be terribly out of the ordinary here."
avt2020,fe07g7o,t3_engd6e,"I really loved it in theaters, I honestly almost cried in the beginning. It was sad, but extremely relatable. It's just nice to know some people know what it's like to have any sort of mental illness."
Gingerluke85,fe1b9aq,t3_engd6e,I absolutely loved Joker.  Anything that brings awareness to the clear failings of mental health care is a plus in my book.
Raven-OA_,fe08zu4,t3_engd6e,I know his paradoxical laughter too well.
Kietu,fe0a7n2,t3_engd6e,It's a really amazing thing to watch BECAUSE of how relevant it is to you. Watch it and let yourself suffer alongside Joaquin. It's really worth it.
saddyforlife,fe0aq5h,t3_engd6e,"So hard to watch. I wanted to cry multiple times. That’s what makes an amazing movie... something that makes you feel!!! Don’t be afraid of your emotions, watch the movie"
barononwheels,fe1akrb,t3_engd6e,I liked Joker but it still is not good as my favorite film: Taxi Driver. I highly recommend it... if you are willing to watch it.
CMnoswag,fe29o6g,t3_engd6e,My parents have actively told me to not watch it because they’re scared of how it may affect me.
Justarandompolegirl,fe2dbxg,t3_engd6e,"I literally threw up after the movie, probably because I could relate to more things than I would've thought before. So it was hard to watch but beside that I think it's a really good movie!"
breakaway223,fe00i1y,t3_engd6e,"I could relate to every bit of the movie. Being a reject in life. The best part for me was when he realizes that his neighbor was a ""thing"" in his head. 

My LDR ex dumped me over a year ago and I'm forcing myself to believe that I was hallucinating or making shit in my own head that she was real and she loved me. I say this because she never wanted me from the start and just wanted her ex whom she got together with as well."
Unnamed-Visitor,fe0978u,t3_engd6e,I have a similar problem. I watch it and I physically hurt at how much I sympathize with the man.
annaaii,fe1264b,t3_engd6e,"Watched it twice and every time it gave me this feeling that I still can't describe properly. It makes me feel uneasy, uncomfortable, scared at times, then sad and a bit hurt but in the same time it can be so relatable. At times, it feels like a hug."
BadbadwickedZoot,fe1ubrv,t3_engd6e,I came away from that movie quite upset.  It just hurts so much.
DarkElf7345,fe22b20,t3_engd6e,"I get you, the first time I watched it I related much to what was happening. Worried me a bit at first but realized how brilliant Phoneix was in the role. Became one of the best movies I've ever seen once I realized how well it was done."
Freladdy11,fe23f7j,t3_engd6e,"i have watched it, is incredible. you should watch it


i just hated when in some parts of the movie everyone at the cinema laughed and i was like ""dude wt* he's suffering"""
PikpikTurnip,fe28pfl,t3_engd6e,"One of my friends paid for my ticket so I watched all the way out of courtesy, but fuck did it mess me up. Just watching someone struggling against their mind on the verge of ruin, and then seeing them go over the edge... it's fucking scary man..."
EdgyChild,fe2v5j1,t3_engd6e,"Joker and Taxin Driver were some of the movies I related to most to the point where, while watching them they gave me a sort feeling of familiarity and comfort. For me it's always interesting to see the sort of situations the protagonists are in, which path they chose and where it leads them since there is no progression in my life. I've been depressed for years and nothing comes out of it. No killing spree which ends with some dead pimps and certainly no uprising of the working class."
NEETHUGS,fe31v2b,t3_engd6e,i still need to watch it
ihwearse,fe3hhhk,t3_engd6e,"tbh i cant relate my depression to Joaquin's joker character, its too weak for me.. though i can relate to his other movie called: ""you were never really here""
it was more accurate depiction personally.."
trappedidk,fe472lo,t3_engd6e,I agree this movie hits hard just like the disney movie Inside Out
MuayThaiJedi13,fe4inao,t3_engd6e,I loved it. So relatable
JAMM9,fe4ucts,t3_engd6e,"So hard to watch.

""All I have are negative thoughts.""

Relatable and heart-breaking at the same time."
OctanesLeg,fe4ylnb,t3_engd6e,"I loved it, I felt good in the theater because even when reading in Reddit about other people's experiences, I sometimes wonder if people really understand what I'm going through. I always give people the benefit of the doubt because they're brave enough to post their feelings here, but this movie matched me. I saw myself in Arthur. It made me feel like I wasnt alone because I could actually see his honest thoughts and emotions in action.

Favorite line: ""You don't get it, do you? All I have  are negative thoughts..."""
UpliftSquid,fe1kqtv,t3_engd6e,I liked it because it made the world feel on the wrong rather that the person
ihatelifetoo,fe0pgvx,t3_engd6e,"Watching the joker makes me sad because It made realize I’m not the only one having such sadness and misery, I 100 percent relate to the part where he having fun with a kid on the bus, one time I was at the dentist and a kid sat next to me playing video games, we talk about games and so on, he wanted my bread chip thingy ( it’s hard to explain but it’s a snack) I offer him some and his dad came out of nowhere and snatch him away and ran off like if I posion the snack and wanted to harm him, it was a sad moment and I felt like some kind of monster"
MomentousIce,fe18dug,t3_engd6e,"I had the opposite reaction. I was overjoyed that experiences that are so taboo to talk about were put on display in such a well-received film. How my friends reacted kind of bothered me though. They were shocked and thought it was extreme, when in truth Arthur’s struggles are very realistic and the violence depicted could very possibly happen and likely has happened in the past."
saltyboi18,fe1f84e,t3_engd6e,I don't entirely relate to Joker. Although I see myself as more of an Edward Norton from Fight Club (1999).
MeImDraven,fe1htbf,t3_engd6e,It hits so close to home. They did a perfect job at portraying depression and social ticks. I've never had a movie cripple me like that.
joker8800,fe1n3ue,t3_engd6e,it's a good movie though it's dark but it's true not a fantasy ... i  could understand his reasons
NumberOneSayoriLover,fe1s28a,t3_engd6e,It's a good(ish) portrayal of mental illness but oh god I couldn't stand the actual story.
Chalken,fe1xi7o,t3_engd6e,I loved that movie. I didn't find it that triggering and it was pretty insightful imo. Shows how far a person failed by society can go.
ILoveVenomousSpiders,fe28mgw,t3_engd6e,I watched it in a cinema with my friend. It made me feel horrible and a little sick and I was really close to asking her if I can just get out several times. It hit really hard.
strongbad4u,fe2gpot,t3_engd6e,I actually have similar issues with laughing  at my problems. It makes me uncomfortable.
Brok3nJ,fe2pk9p,t3_engd6e,"I've been hesitant to watch. I don't know how I'll take it, in the state that I'm currently in"
Merc636,fe2v1ac,t3_engd6e,One of my favorite s because I can relate and dont feel like I'm alone for a few minutes
Czitus,fe2xtfw,t3_engd6e,"Watch it, if you relate to it that's even better :)"
fizzgig36933,fe3a8hn,t3_engd6e,"Such a heart breaking story, and so relatable. Loved this film. But i can see how it can be too disturbing. I tend to like dark movies and storylines though."
SoulDestroyer_Z,fe3cd9x,t3_engd6e,I love the movie sums up my life exactly
subberhubber,fe3t3ti,t3_engd6e,Thays why I have an issue watching the supranos I'm a strong proud man but beneath I'm crumbling with depression. I'm a sheep in wolves clothing.
CruelCooper,fe3yw7j,t3_engd6e,i couldn’t finish it cause it’s so bad lol. it gave me adult version of those faux edgy myspace era relatable“depression” meme vibes.
Bigbaby22,fe5d6c8,t3_engd6e,"One of the first things a friend said to me (they saw a premiere screening) is that this movie is not for those who have a hard time seperating reality from fiction. 

  I have major depression but I loved the movie. But don't feel bad if you can't watch it. It certainly isn't (and never was intended) for everyone."
chocodove92,fe6cjad,t3_engd6e,"Dude, I have ptsd and depression diagnosed, I swear this is too real. I could not watch the movie, it hurts even try to."
UnstoppableExcalipur,fe6e82i,t3_engd6e,"I'm not normally a fan of superhero comics but I was interested in the movie because of its darker tone, and also wanted to see what the fuss was about after all the hit pieces on it. My dad wanted someone to see it with so I decided to join him. He normally loves superhero movies, but he thought the movie sent an inappropriate, dangerous message. He is also someone who has never tried to understand the physical and mental health problems I suffer with, though, and thinks that religion, alternative medicine, and positive thinking will solve all problems, so I wasn't surprised. I mean, I don't condone violence, but I do think it's true that a lot of people with health problems that are difficult to see are expected to act normal. That part of the movie resonated with me."
GrassTastesBad2016,fecvg51,t3_engd6e,Holy fuck that movie is such a trigger. Went to go see it the weekend it premiered and I have never seen more people get up in and out of a movie theater. Don't know if it was because the US army was sending out warnings of possible shootings at showings or if people were just uncomfortable but I definitely think it's one of those movies I'll only be able to watch every few years because it's so hard hitting.
Fight3rOfTheNightman,fdzx0m0,t3_engd6e,"Stop trying then lol, sorry for finding this funny but it seems like the obvious solution"
pandorasbox71,fdzxmil,t1_fdzx0m0,"It does, doesn’t it? 😊I did decide to stop. But I paid for it on demand and some people I know were raving about it. Feels like a waste. Plus I wanted to use it as a common touchstone to talk about depression with some. 

I like the humor!"
Fight3rOfTheNightman,fdzxuog,t1_fdzxmil,"Well i didn't think it was amazing anyway so you aren't missing alot, though like you said its very popular so it nice to be able to talk to people about it. 
And you must have that dark sense of humour then haha"
pandorasbox71,fdzyd3o,t1_fdzxuog,Yes! I have to bite my tongue a lot though. Glad to know it’s a shared affliction
jOeyr91,em40kf,top_level,"I’m in college, struggling with depression and I find that I crave affection like hugs and cuddling, because I never got a lot of it in my childhood. Now (though I never act on it) I crave physical affection from guys. I always want to hug my guy friends, or put my head on their shoulder if I’m sitting next to them on the couch, but I don’t because I’m afraid it will be weird."

AnotherTrowaway12,fdmjjxd,t1_fdmjeot,"Yeah same here! Like it’s so sad when all you have to hug is your pillow but at least it won’t leave you haha, my pillow has always been there and never stops me from hugging it : )."

DrDougExeter,fdmttx5,t1_fdmjjxd,"its not the same, at all"
AnotherTrowaway12,fdmkf0s,t1_fdmk408,"Aww same here! My pillow is always there even when people tell me that I have to grow up and grow some balls I can just be my sensitive self to it and cry as much as I need. 

Aww I know. My pillow has been there for so long, it even had a familiar smell to it so I know it’s ""her"" hahaha, does yours have that too"
AnotherTrowaway12,fdmtwnb,t1_fdmttx5,?
Throwawayuser626,fdmkkht,t1_fdmkf0s,It does! But it’s actually the smell from someone I was with. It’s very faint but...comforting.
AnotherTrowaway12,fdmksoc,t1_fdmkkht,"Aww that’s very sweet, I’m glad it stays with your pillow. For me it’s a weird comforting smell of sweat and tears (sounds wonderful I know hahah). I don’t know why but over these weeks it’s become such a comforting smell and sensation and I can’t get enough of that, if I lay in bed I’ll probably stay there for a few hours instead of getting up haha.

alt74927,fdm8w3n,t3_em40kf,Same but the other way round. Of course I think about sex and the likes but I  would rather have a relationship without sex and have it be meaningful and loving than with it.

I let them do it because I assume they need it, or its comfortable for them, but man I can't describe the feeling. it's like when you put a harness on a cat and they just flop over because it feels wrong.

I had lunch with one of my best friends today, I've known her for the same amount of time, she's single. We talked about this. I told her about how I would just want to ""Netflix and Chill"" with a woman but like... literally that's it... but you can't just do that with girl friends.

Of course I would love to do that with her, but no way would I ask. I want to hug her for more than one second but that's... 

Man I just want to lay on someone's lap and watch Death Note, no flirting, no touching, no fucking, can we just normalize this already?"

Deadcurry,fdmr9i3,t3_em40kf,"I'm a male and I feel the same way. I have aspergers and find it hard to show affection to other people, probably one of the reasons why I've never had a partner. And I crave just being cuddled and emotional support."
Lighthuro,fdmrnvu,t3_em40kf,Yeah at 30. True fact. When they begin to understand there's almost no time left to have a good partner. They try to choose wisely and they don't in some cases. The table turn at this point.
some1nth,fdmncis,t3_em40kf,I would hug you. :)
lifeislikeadick,fdmoedi,t3_em40kf,"i need like a , minimal‘ amount of affection from anybody, or i get even more depressed. but its not sexual and i just need that , if i dont get it i feel worse"
Phebeosa,fdndtkn,t3_em40kf,"Modern women, imo, have really done a disservice to one another. Its like every one just expects it has to be sexual because so many people will meet a ""date"" or someone at a bar and have sex with them within a few hours of knowing them. Think about how damaging that actually is. The most intimate thing you can do with someone, within an hour or two of meeting them. I may sound like a loser for thinking this but i wish people would get to know one another or at least not make everything so sexualized. I guess when there are billions of hours of free porn and sex being sold on every channel this is what you get."

AnotherTrowaway12,fdmj7qt,t3_em40kf,"Sorry I’m not female but I feel the same way! I’d love to just get a hug from another girl, just to feel cared for and cuddled for just a few minute, that would cheer my broken heart up : )"

ProtonRequiem,fdmq81i,t3_em40kf,With good communication this can be possible! I don't know you or your friends but as long as it is established that your relationship to that person is purely platonic then this kind of small physical contact could work out without anything negative springing up
aesthetic-Q,fdmsem6,t3_em40kf,As a guy I can tell everything can be weird but just do it personally I don’t think it’s weird and like when girls do that cause I feel appreciated so don’t be afraid
RossTheNinja,fdmtb96,t3_em40kf,Ask. I'm sure most would be fine with it. I've had female friends where we were affectionate but never anything other than friends.

we started dating and the affection from purely friendly turned to something more romantic
i hated it. at first i told him to stop doing it this much but even then i was bending away from him touch 
we started seeing each other less and less and i saw i was hurting him
we talked and decided it will be best for us to break up
I still fell bad for what i done but also haven't had any even a bit romantic relationship because i am so afraid that it will happen again"

God damn, we all need some god damned hugs, would make the world a better place"
identitynumber4,fdn49r3,t3_em40kf,"Hey! Never be afraid to ask any of your friends for a hug! Trust me, they don't mind. Friends are meant to be support and comfort, and it is a two-way street. Having an open line of communication in all of your relationships in life can vastly improve your outlook on life. If you feel like you need some physical affection just say something like ""Hey, I'm having a rough day, can I get a hug?"" It's a simple to understand request and usually (hopefully) can't be misconstrued as flirting. 

Physical connection releases dopamine in our brains so there is nothing more normal than wanting that!"
happyplaces23,fdn8atl,t3_em40kf,Its so normal
Xinder99,fdn8lfq,t3_em40kf,"As a guy personally I crave physical attention. Granted I am a slut for attention and asexual so I never crave sexual attention.

TheWildRedditor,fdnabrh,t3_em40kf,"Yesssss (I found out I’m asexual about year and a half ago and that explains it all, I never crave sexual contact with anyone)"
ceanahope,fdnbs7e,t3_em40kf,"Yes.  Cuddles are the best with no expectations but more cuddles.  There are cuddle parties which have strict rules around boundaries where consent is the center of the event.  Here is a website to check out and maybe find one in your area.  http://www.cuddleparty.com/

I have not attended one myself (been a little shy to attend), but I hear they can be awesome no stress space where you are in control of what you want that gets you cuddles."

HotDogBurps,fdnfa5x,t3_em40kf,"How close are you with the guy friends that you have? I'm a really cuddly and touchy person and am needy most days so I like that I grew up with guys that are all basically ""brother like"" or ""cousin like"" to me. I always put my feet up on them or lean a head on their shoulder without it ever being weird. It's nice. I think if you've always had a completely platonic relationship with them it wouldn't be weird and I highly doubt they would find it weird too."
Kr4ativ4r4infall,fdnffuv,t3_em40kf,"Yeah, but only with two close male friends of mine One of them is my best friend since primary school and even if I'm not quite sure that I've experienced what romantic love feels like, I know that what I'm feeling for him is definitely true love, although the platonic kind."
PlaguedEarth,fdng0bo,t3_em40kf,Most Humans crave physical contact with another person. It’s how we are wired
rhaskew,fdng0tt,t3_em40kf,"Yeah i totally do. All the guys i have been with in the past just wanna fuck and aren't the cuddling type.  Which is really hard on me cause i don't really like sex, and i just need hugs and cuddling and talking. Plus i am shy and awkward so it's not like i could communicate this well to them."
jimmy_randall,fdngcdw,t3_em40kf,"I’m a guy and I kindof crave that too. Not badly enough to go and seek it out, but when I’m feeling lonely.

My medication is weird, I don’t have any interest in sex anymore. But I’d love to cuddle, hug, spoon, fall asleep, any non-sexual human contact."
thejokerknight_,fdnge1p,t3_em40kf,"Yeah that’s how I feel with this guy I like. I long to hug him like not even anything else like kiss him or anything (tho I wouldn’t complain), but I get an actual craving to hug him. We’re just acquaintances/kinda friends so it’d be weird tho. But I get what you’re saying ever since I was younger I craved hugs and I remember when I was sad as a kid I would only cheer up after a hug."
Bohus57,fdngkvu,t3_em40kf,"I am a guy who is looking for a relationship, not because sex but to have someone to hug and just love & never let go. I too struggle with this aswell with depression and anxiety, but no matter what I do I cannot succeed in anything I want. I just feel that I need someone really bad, but everyone just tells me it’s pointless and “too soon” because I am only 18."
AtomicThunder21,fdnkjkq,t3_em40kf,Yes. I really enjoy cuddling and hugs
bryan7500,fdnlmut,t3_em40kf,"You will find the odd guy who doesn't mind a hug hello, go ahead hug it out if they aren't uncomfortable. I'm not a touchy, Feely person. But I always hug my Affectionate friends because I know they just like a hug. We all need love and acceptance."
Lilliampumpernickelx,fdnon5y,t3_em40kf,"I'm a dude and I feel the same. Not that I don't crave intimate relationships as well but the thought of having a girl as some kind of ""cuddle buddy"" is comforting. Just lying in bed, watching movies and cuddling.

I'm too tired for an actual relationship but I'd love this."
ActiveGeek,fdnp0if,t3_em40kf,"Lots of people, male and female, like non-sexual physical affection."
Leeroy_JenkinsVIII,fdnpvai,t3_em40kf,"Aye, sometimes shite like that can prove a bit dicey depending on the kind of guy friend you're working with. 

Like, if a guy is also feeling lonely and depressed due to an inability to attract women, he might mistake that kind of physical affection as sexual affection, especially if he's had no real contact prior. Something like that might send a signal you didn't intend to send, and now the friend might develop feelings for you that you won't be able to reciprocate. 

I should know, as I've mistaken platonic affection for sexual affection plenty of times in the past due to my own insecurities. It's led to many burnt bridges I wish I could rebuild. 

No one's really to blame in that situation, but just be ready to communicate your intentions properly if you sense that might be happening. Maybe provide a platonic shoulder to cry on if you know he's going through some shite, too."
Squeakymeeper13,fdnwosl,t3_em40kf,It's a love language thing.  Doesnt have to be romantic love either!

hillgiantpunpun,fdomims,t3_em40kf,"As a male who feels this way, and is otherwise abstinent, I wholeheartedly feel your pain. The last female that I did fall for thought my lack of sexual advances and frequent desire for hand holding, cuddling, cheek brushing, eskimo/butterfly kisses, and the like meant I was gay. If sex is obligatory my parts don't function. I just want to feel closeness with someone who gets me."
HretoKimiko,fdoqcl3,t3_em40kf,I do crave it too though I'm a guy. I don't know how it is for you but I feel safe and like I can relax for once when I do that
jibjib69,fdotlpv,t3_em40kf,"Yeah, I get that. my dad wasn’t around and isn’t around anymore and that really messed up my ability to be social with guys in anyway among other things that happened. I’m scared of them honestly, they make me nervous.

Having said that I really do love the few guy friends that I’ve been able to make and hugging them/when they play with my hair/whatever else makes me feel so happy and safe. 

I don’t know if it’s because a guy actually cares about me or if the only thing I still live for is hugs from anyone.

But I feel like that’s so normal! They probably won’t mind and will even be happy you want physical contact like that honestly"
madifatty1221,fdp1lhd,t3_em40kf,I just want someone to light rub my back and play with my hair before I go to bed.

jOeyr91,fdo74rm,t1_fdn3fh8,"Honestly it’s just the first word that came to mind. I call myself “female, woman, girl” etc and guys “guys, men, males” etc but sometimes my brain just does weird things when typing 😂😂"
darkguardian823,fdncwog,t1_fdn3fh8,"Because sometimes people get a bad response for saying girls, gals, or chicks."
Available_Newt,fdmut0w,t3_em40kf,"I totally get this. I think it's ok to hug your guy friends, but I understand it's also pretty difficult to ask. You can often hug goodbye/hello or if there is a guy friend you are close with you can openly say ""I feel down and shitty, can I have a hug?""

Otherwise I find other physical things can help a little. Stroking pets, weighted blanket, teddies, hot water bottles. Anything that gives you that hugging sensation. Appreciate it's not the same though.

Also things like yoga or exercise because they generically make your body feel good. Hope that helps in some way, but you're definitely not alone."
Wolfess_Moon,fdn6a7d,t3_em40kf,Yes
NEXEL33,fdowni2,t3_em40kf,"I’m telling u this now, he/they will love it, all guys love attention from girls, at least that’s my experience. If a girl did that to me I would be happier and probably be flirting with her.

Fuck her indeed."

People should not be having children and forcing them to play in this fucked up world. We aren’t even close to making this fucking world a decent place to live in and yet fuckers keep breeding Lmfao.

finethankshowareyou_,fe6b3ta,t3_env9a0,"For me ignorance is not bliss, but a tool to stay sane in today’s world.. we’re the first to live in this age of awareness overload with the internet. Constantly exposed to every terrible thing happening in the world in real time, only to realize what makes the headlines is just the tip of the iceberg. So I get the gist of the headlines (just for the sake of conversation) but try not to allow myself to care too much about it all. Once I start caring too much is when I get emotional, and everything gets harder. 

You care about your life. You care about quality of life. Which may be why having to spend it in such shitty ways is having such an effect. And I presume you don’t mean just work, but other bullshit like taxes and laundry and dishes or whatever. It takes a lot to live even a basic life and goddamn I don’t know how people do it. I just assume everyone I meet is severely depressed in some way and it helps explain some of the behavior, which helps me accept people who fucking suck sometimes, which helps keep me calm and feel like I’m not alone. 

My work comes home with me, freelance style, which sounds great to some, but all weekend I’ve been putting off work that was due last week. I’ve hardly been able to enjoy anything for the last 5 days as the constant need to do this work I’m not passionate about looms over my every moment. And I could have done it by now but I just can’t bring myself to do it. And I hate myself for it. And yet here I am... Now the weekend is gone and I have to do it tonight and I’m gonna get a shitty night sleep to start the week aaaaand the cycle continues. 

I say this because while you may hate what you do, if the work doesn’t come home with you, at least you’re free when you’re on your own. I’ve had “homework” constantly my entire adult life and it can be very depressing. 

Remember if it ever truly goes to shit you can always get a one-way ticket somewhere and start over. I wonder if you’re not being selfish enough. Do what’s right for you, if people are draining you, just tell them. Or ghost them but say you’re fine when they worry. 

Embrace being able to ignore the world. There’s enough music, movies, video games, to last a lifetime. Keep yourself, and your mind, distracted. The news makes it all look terrible, and everyone is afraid of everything, but there’s mostly good people in the word. I earnestly believe. You just only ever hear about the shitty ones. If this didn’t help at all please let me know and I’ll delete it. 

“Fuck it” also helps. Just fuck it. Whatever. Who cares. Eat well and try again tomorrow. Something will light that fire of excitement in you. Or someone. Or somewhere. But there’s so many options and so many things to try... try it all first, by the time you do that you’ll be dead from time anyway."

itstimetobeatbpd,fe6hmlh,t3_env9a0,I think this all the time!!! No one understands me. They always say shit like “that’s just life”. But why!?! Why does life have to be spending so much of your time doing something you hate for other people to make more money. I am working to find a way to work for myself right now so I don’t have to spend my life working for some dickhole.

There's no love. There's only settling."
PsychedelicSkeptic,fe6eoy3,t3_env9a0,"I feel that way a lot, too. I’ve worked so many pointless menial hard labor jobs and it’s extremely hard to cope when you’re working just as a wage slave. Based on this post alone, you seem like an intelligent person. I think for most intelligent people, we think deeply and critically about all aspects of life. If we don’t create our own meaning to our existence, we end up depressed because the system is flawed and favors worker bees who can be more simple-minded. (I don’t mean to judge anyone by saying that - some people find meaning even in the worst/hardest of jobs. I’m just not one of those types, either.)

Perhaps think of careers that would help you feel like you’re contributing to making the world, or even just your community, a better place. This world is fucked up, for sure. But that’s seemingly the only solace I have found, personally — contemplating how to develop a career that will lessen the suffering of others.

If that’s not really your thing, maybe try to think of what interests you and how to turn that into a career.
College or trade school can at least get you more skills and expand your options. You can even teach yourself without school, ofc, but either way it helps to have valued knowledge or skills. 

Then again, I know how bad depression can get, and that sometimes it feels impossible to think of interests or long-term goals. You will have better days and this too shall pass someday. 

In the end, no one has more control over your destiny than yourself. If you don’t want to be a wage slave, then find a way out, even if it takes a long time. You have so much value as a human being and the power to overcome anything, I promise you. It’s going to be ok."

We are just using up resources that would be better spent on people who want to live. I don’t understand why society wants to force us to kill ourselves. It’s like forcing us to fill our own cavities or to operate on ourselves. There are trained professionals who will do these things for us so as to ease the pain in these procedures as much as possible. I just wish suicide was the same.

There is this old movie called Soylent Green which is about this dystopian future where the world is so overpopulated that only the rich can afford real food. They have these medically assisted suicides to held lower the population and seeing the procedure it seemed like such a wonderful process. It was just a throw away scene in the movie, but to me, that was the best part. Since seeing that movie, maybe 30 years ago, I’ve always wished for something like that in real life."

You deserve to feel good, no matter what's happened or what you may have done in the past if you want to live an honest and happy life then you deserve to. 

Your inner demons will tell you you don't deserve to be happy. You're just craving attention, you just want someone to pity you. That's what demons do. They whisper to you and make you doubt yourself. 

You might think people have it worse, and you don't have a right to feel the way you do but that's bullshit. The way you feel is just as important and just as real as someone who has it ""worse"". 

You can fight this, I'm not telling you your demons will go away, they may always tempt you, but you can beat them down and learn to give them the middle finger every time they do."

1. Beeing narcisstic isn't tha same as  acknowledging your issus
2. People dont already think about you this way. They see and like you for how you behave and make them feel. When you change that it changes your relationship.

I'm bipolar, and when my depressive episode comes it hits so heavy I can't imagine keeping it to myself.  I kind of just make light of it and joke about it at work (idk, I bartend/serve, so a little less formal), and then I go home and I cry in the shower until it runs cold and I still can't get out.

collingunter,fdk9jg5,t3_elpxkm,"That’s the depression that is making u think that. Also if you ever find yourself in that state of mind while talking to people, chances are you are not talking to the right people. The right people are going to go out of your way to make sure you know that it is okay not to be okay. And they will know that it is absolutely imperative that you have outlets and therapy sessions (whether or not they are with an actual therapist) because you need that allotted time and energy to vent your frustrations and come up with reasons and causes (and more importantly) avenues for your plan to ease your depression. You are not craving attention, depression is a bunch of uphill battles in an incredibly strategic war. You need to be able to talk about your problems. Otherwise, If that was the case and all depressed people were “craving attention” then no one would get better and everyone would stay depressed."

Tiphanne,fdkr1lj,t3_elpxkm,"This could be the result of parents saying “Stop crying or I will give you something to cry about” or “Big girls/boys don’t cry” or any dismissive neglectful behaviour realized or not. However, that may have also been their upbringing as well so before you start blaming mom and dad for this, try to be kind. As kind as you need to be for yourself! First! Neglect is still neglect even if it’s completely unconscious. I feel your pain of needing to bottle up emotions and almost a denial that anything is wrong but yet you feel it. You know something is not right. Trust that. It’s likely just because you were never shown that feelings (good, bad and ugly) are all normal and perfectly okay to express. When you don’t have examples in early development of healthy emotional expression, it can have negative impacts later in life. We as humans need to express and release our emotions or it becomes a festering train wreck of confusion and pain. And in this case also guilt. What you are feeling is okay. Get out as much as you can. It takes time. You may be literally reparenting yourself. Therapy can be very beneficial in helping you make a lasting change. Best of luck! Be kind to yourself and don’t hesitate to reach out when you feel a desire to express ALL your feelings. You are not a burden!"

It's a state of denial, but the only real way to differ the two is to attempt treatment. If validation from peers is treating your depressive issues, you're lacking social relations with other people. If the treatment is working more than the validation, you're only suffering from self doubt, and that is a problem only solved by believing in yourself and silencing those voices by proving them wrong, which they always are wrong, sometimes less than you'd like, but they're always wrong."

I love metal and I recently started learning guitar, I want to play so bad and that for two weeks I have practiced almost every day for at least an hour or two. Sure I am still struggling as I just started,  but the pride you feel learning an instrument is amazing. Then having the passion to make my own music by the end of 2020, is something I look very forward to, the ability to express myself through my love of metal. Learning an instrument is one of the best things in life I ever decided to do"

I just dont fucking understand what I am suppose to do. I finally got tired of it and started looking for help on the internet.

RoninParzival,fdih1n5,t3_eleyhh,"I’m almost 50 and I can tell you all that it does not stop. Meds help. Therapy. Forcing yourself to get up and fight. Major Depression is a real deal and terrifying to boot bc as you all know, most of the time the people we cry out for help usually don’t have the ability to understand. I understand. I know where you’re at. I’ve been there many times so I don’t want anyone taking what I’m about to say out of context...
You can choose to fight. 
Yell. Scream. Break something. (Try not to go jail-I’ve been there too). Dig deep within yourself and find your Monster (he/she is in there) and set that Monster free. 
Find your strength- your courage- all your rage and MOVE. Your disease thrives on complacency. 
MOVE and feel the quiet stir in your chest grow into a nuclear explosion and put yourself into attack mode. 
Take shit from NO ONE!!!
MOVE. 
Keep Moving."

Osprey49,fdk7qfy,t1_fdih1n5,This is great advice. I'm also 50 and have had depression all these years. Getting pissed off does help. I go for a long hike and start off depressed but after the first mile I'm in attack mode and feel ready to take on anything. Same thing happens when I mow the yard. Sitting around the house doing nothing is the worse thing for depressed people.

Some days I’ll feel beyond happy and the next day I just want to die. But those days, I found help in just thinking of all the things that make me want to live. It doesnt even have to be big. Music, baths, smiling, sunsets... those things just give me that tiny bit of energy to not do it today. I dont know if it will ever get better.

Khelebragon,fdidi1t,t3_eleyhh,"As someone who attempted suicide years ago I can tell you this. Life does get better. I know you must be hearing this a countless number of times but it’s true. You’re 19, are you going to college? 

Going to college helped me a lot. I met amazing understanding people and even though they didn’t directly help me improve, they did so inderictly. Being surrounded by positive, loving, caring people is a huge boost for yourself and helps with your mental health.

I know that you migth think that no one wants to be friends with you but it’s not true. There’s always people like us who can understand and love us for who we are. I don’t know your background but mine was mostly about being bullied at school and having to face my family extremely high expectations. I was a mess when I got to college and the people I met helped me get out of it. 

I know this might not work for everyone we all have different experiences and fall somewere on the spectrum but it’s undeniable that being in a positive environment gets you happier.

Seeking profesionnal help might also be an option to help you. Or even reaching the suicide hotline.

The thing is improvement sadly won’t come to you, you have to go seek it and I know how hard it must be and feel but in my opinion being out of my suicidal mindset and living life as it is now makes me so happy to be able to enjoy my life.

I just wish you the best and hope you won’t hurt yourself. I know what it’s like to be hurting but we also have to think about the people we might hurt. When I saw my parents after my suicide attemp I felt so devastated seeing how scared and relieved they were. We all have someone waiting on us. It can be a friend, a family member, anyone.

I know you don’t see it this way but it’s true life is worth living and I hope you realise it one day too ❤️."
talklowtalkslow,fdizp05,t1_fdidi1t,"Going to college helped me a lot too. I’m in college currently and even though it stresses me out sometimes it helps me feel like I have a purpose. Planning into the future helps me feel like I’m actually going to accomplish something and makes me be able to wake up each morning feeling determined. Some days it’s harder than others but the main thing to remember in the back of my mind is that I only have one life, and even though it sometimes feels like shit, it’s important to realize I was even lucky enough to be born. We always need to step back and realize that there are people here for us and even though our families and friends might not realize what we go through internally, they still care about us and our wellbeing. It takes patience with yourself and other people to begin the journey to getting better."

loadofballcocks,fdjas46,t3_eleyhh,"You might want to check out Buddhism. The first noble truth to Buddhism is that suffering exists. However, there is an end to suffering. Just like satisfaction, suffering is temporary. I’m nearing a bankruptcy right now for some stupid financial decisions I’ve made over the past few years and a bad sales slump over the last quarter. My material things may leave me, but I’ll still remain. The wanting of this things is what causes me so much pain. But I am still a good person, and I continue to grow everyday. Wanting the world to turn out a certain way is where we find ourselves in trouble because this outlook will surely fail us sometimes. Even in the most troubling of times we can still find at least one thing we are still grateful for. 

Whatever traumas you have experienced in the past are not your fault. But it is your responsibility to heal."

But I’m also super frustrated at the fact that I have to live a life I never asked for in the first place, and I feel totally guilty that I’m not grateful for something that’s really sacred to a lot of people. The suicidal thoughts, for me, have never really gone away no matter my emotional state. Since being on medication my mood has been a ton better but the way I ponder suicidal ideation has stayed, its just become super passive.  I just want you to know that you’re not alone, and maybe there’s something worth it in the end, or we find it or create something worth living for and something that eases the suffering. I wish you all the best and thank you so much for sharing this"

Focus on the ones that love you and don't spend a second worrying about the opinions of the rest. We're all human. We all get lazy, tired, emotional, anxious, make fools of ourselves, and make mistakes. It's all a part of life, it doesn't make you any less worthy of a human being. You still deserve love. Life is a lesson though, learn from your past. You can't change the past but that doesn't mean you can't change you future. There's something about you that makes you so uniquely who you are. Love that about yourself. If you're in a low place, please trust me in telling you that you don't have to be there forever. Just keep trying, one step and one day at a time.

djkku,fdp9n0c,t3_emfeyp,"'Now, what I would call a really swinging human being is a person who lives on two levels at once. He’s able to live on the level of being his ordinary ego, his everyday personality, and play his role in life, and to observe all the rules, and so on, that go with that. But if he is only on that level—if he’s only playing that kind of thing—and thinks that’s all there is, it becomes a drag. He starts being the kind of person who feels that he’s just got to go on surviving, see? It’s terribly important to go on surviving; to live. And he works at that. And his children learn the same attitude from him. He says, “Well, I’ve got to survive because I’ve got all these children I have to support,” and so on, and so forth, and then they take the same attitude, and they breed up children, and they feel compulsive about supporting them, because they’ve got to go on. And so nobody really has any fun. It’s just... “Ungh! Ungh! Ungh! Ungh! You’ve got to make this thing! You see?"" ...And you don’t have to!

See, whenever I get somebody who comes to me and says, “I really can’t go on. I have to commit suicide,” I say, “Well, that’s entirely your right. There’s really no reason why you should go on, and if you want to commit suicide, do it.” You can check out.
....
The trouble comes into the world largely because various beings take themselves seriously, instead of playfully. After all, you must become serious if you think that something is desperately important, but you will only think that something is desperately important if you are afraid of losing it. In one way, however, if you fear losing something, it isn't really worth having. There are people who live in dread, and then drag on living because they are afraid to die. They will probably teach their children to do the same, and their children will in turn teach their own children to live that way. And so it goes on and on.'

All the chairs on waitingroom were vacant, so I had to wait in the hallway. Im fully in view, more than I could want to be honest.

Then she just walks past me, looking disinterested, and not responding when I greet her. She disappears to one of the many rooms, and now its been half an hour.

There is a policy that if your time is 15 min late, you can inform the office and they might do something about it. 

All I got was ""She will call you, so please wait in the waiting room.""

Might I add, these services are in the same space, office is next to the waiting room. So no way that I could miss her.

undersquirl,fdqi3xg,t3_emo7hq,"Hey, they are people too. You shouldn't ever, EVER feel bad about how other people act. It's just up to you to make a decision on how you respond to those actions. If she's an asshole you can't change that, you can only change the way you respond to that person.

I hope you feel better today! And remember, we're always here if you want to talk or share anything. You got this!"
InterabangSmoose,fdqwazp,t1_fdqi3xg,"Your comment kind of speaks to the heart of our(well, my) problems, though. I know logically that someone being late or rude or nasty to me is 99% of the time not about me, but it FEELS awful and crushing and painful. It's outlandish the number of times people have told me not to be so sensitive, and then I get to feel bad about feeling bad. Man, it's even a struggle to express this. I absolutely believe your comment is meant as supportive, but it feels like blame."
undersquirl,fdqxmk0,t1_fdqwazp,"Yes, you're right. I'm sorry, that was not at all my intention. It's just something that i tell myself everytime something like this happens to me.

When i start blaming myself for the way i react i just say this in my head over and over and it seems to help me. It's just the way i handle it myself. I promise i was just trying to be helpful."
InterabangSmoose,fdqz0w8,t1_fdqxmk0,"As I said, i really felt like your intentions were good, I don't want to make you feel bad for trying, and hey, you were offering up something that works for you. It just brought something up for me personally that I've struggled with. It may be just me and not the author of the original post at all. It's just something to possibly consider, but good on you for reaching out."
binsbein2,fdq3lg6,t3_emo7hq,So any update why she behaved the way she did?
Titutchu,fdq44ed,t1_fdq3lg6,"My time was up, so I needed to book another pointment. Sorry, no explanation yet."
Randotek,fdq574z,t1_fdq44ed,"When you leave the place or go back please tell the person at the front desk you want another psychologist. Tell them you feel your needs were not met and that you feel that her actions were unjust. Have them set you up with someone else. I know I had to when it came to my medication doctor. The one I had was like a blank wall. I would tell him things and all I would get after is a look like I was some sort of moron. So, I told the front desk people to change him out for another doctor. They did. He thus far has listened to everything I have had to say and hooked me up with medication that has thus far worked out for me. I wish you luck. Its not easy the first go around."
nono1210,fdrjoh2,t3_emo7hq,"Hey, we gotta remember also that therapist's carry A LOT of people's issues on top of their own issues. Maybe she was having a bad day, maybe she had tunnel vision and didn't see you or hear you or maybe there was some type of crisis. I don't think this single act makes her a bad person or a bad therapist, just how a single unintentional thing YOU have done hasn't ever made you a bad person or bad at your job. We all make mistakes, don't take this one too personally, could very understandably be a mix up."
blu3h4wk,fdqtk22,t3_emo7hq,she is only human too. She probably has a lot on her mind and didnt really notice you because shes probably stressing out about something completely different.
nightstalker_55,fdq00ni,t3_emo7hq,"Change therapists. Just leave and don’t give them your money. 

There are people out there that do care."
Titutchu,fdq2ltr,t1_fdq00ni,Thank you for your advice. That surely wasnt something expecting from her.
echoGroot,fdry3hp,t3_emo7hq,Ask for an explanation or a change of therapist. It’s possible something dramatic happened and she was in a daze. Maybe she got a call that her father just died or something.
throwaway_xox_,fdpzprm,t3_emo7hq,this is why i dont bother getting help. even therapists hate the sight of me
Titutchu,fdq2wij,t1_fdpzprm,"Please do if you feel like you need it.

Not everyone can work together, but there is always somebody that can help."
RagingDragon8,fdqfz62,t1_fdq2wij,"I agree with you, there is always someone that can help. I went to therapy once and found a great professional. I met her once on the street, she was talking with a friend and she stopped to greet me and even ask me how was I doing. Later, I invited her to an event and she said she would consider it, but she called me  later to tell me it wouldn't be proper since she was my therapist. I appreciated the detail of call, thing that some ""friends"" don't do many times. 

&#x200B;

So it's best to find a good therapist whenever you have the chance."

Open yourself up to being likeable and it may be hard and difficult and scary, but the key is to keep trying."
throwaway_xox_,fdrkjl4,t1_fdrkfpm,yep just lecture me and pick on me like everyone else did yesterday. no wonder i was in tears and had no sleep last night.
nono1210,fdrlh1s,t1_fdrkjl4,"Yeah, you do need a lecture to snap out of your victim mentality. I'm not going to pity you because you're depressed like the rest of us. You shouldn't be looking for pity either. You should be looking for help and being understood. You put yourself in a victim role, are resistant to any type of help/advice/encouragement and then twist it so that you can continue painting yourself as the victim and everyone else as bad people who are attacking you. If you want to help yourself, you need to stop believing you're a victim."

electrikinfinity,fdswh7n,t3_emo7hq,"I would ask to speak with a higher up if it’s not a private practice, or drop them and find a new therapist. I’ve been through many horrible therapists over the last 10 years. The last one I had was the worst, I would get into therapy and she would be on her phone with her husband half the time, then tell me how stressed she was and that she needed a vacation. She double booked me by accident a few times so I would get to my appointment to have to turn around and go home. Then caught her in a lie a few times that she was ill and had to reschedule. I finally called and complained about her which is difficult for me to do. But moral is therapists are just human beings, some of them don’t do their jobs well, some have issues of their own, and some are just not great people. So don’t let anyone make you feel insignificant, just find someone who does have the mental capacity to act professional and do their job."
BreaghaGreenEyes,fdt7s1l,t3_emo7hq," How long have you been seeing her? Establishing a personal, trusting relationship with your therapist is essential. I'd feel very hurt by her actions. It may not make sense to other people, but hello, things not making sense is why we go to therapy!

 Every therapist I've seen has come into the room, made eye contact with me and called my name or just called my name if I wasn't paying attention. I've seen some therapists walk up to their patients sitting in the lobby, then say their name. 

 If you haven't seen the lady enough for her to recognize you, she should have at least asked your name. I'd talk to her about it just because that's what a ""normal"" person would do. I hate confrontation but you'll feel much better and be more able to decide what to do from there."

Pausole,fduz4qr,t3_emo7hq,"People like us tend to overthink and overanalyze everything, and that can really mess up our human interactions. Being like this made me lose a girl I was into and that was into me too. I was paranoid. I accused her and had resentment for her. And it wasn't justified.

Maybe you're completely wrong. Maybe you're not. Talk to her. Only way you can know for sure if she truly doesn't care about you."

daftv4der,fe7rka3,t3_envmp8,"I had the same thing. I can remember songs I listened to in very traumatic times of my life, and how some songs even inspired me to work my way out of those situations.

I’m a 22 year old girl who just started working in the healthcare field and landed a decent job. I’m only working part time right now and my parents don’t know because I didn’t want them being disappointed. My boyfriend knows however and today he sort of made fun of me and called me lazy for only having a part time job in a joking way. I know he wasn’t serious but apparently his parents were saying too that I’m only doing a part time job and seeing that as lazy. My anxiety and depression is always so high that it’s all I can handle. Why is working full time an expectation of our society? I really hate that Im supposed to slave my life away working. It’s not that I don’t have motivation, I enjoy what I do. But I also want the time for the luxuries and comforts that life has to offer. I’m someone who wants to travel the world and have money. But that comes with having to study and work forever. It’s awful. I hate life. I’m just crying in bed everything sucks"
Galliprant,fe6xqci,t3_eo1usb,I know exactly how you feel. It is a terrifying thought when I think of spending my life like working so long just to fund a life I am not entirely sure is worth living. It really does suck. I'm here if you need anyone to talk to. I really mean that.
shru4i97,fe6y0eh,t1_fe6xqci,Thank you for taking the time to reply to my post. It really is terrifying that this is what our society is and everyone is just expected to work. I think that it would be better if each individual had the ability to enjoy what the world has to offer and travel and be happy. It’s unfortunate that we have to work the way we do. I appreciate it. I feel so lonely at times but it’s nice to know others feel like me. I feel burnt out sometimes and I just started working
dexterdrag,fe8i0jf,t1_fe6xqci,"Oh wow. That line ""to fund a life I am not entirely sure is worth living"". I question myself a lot on this. We spend most of our waking moments at work. The money from work, we spend it on holiday, clothes, items, which provide a temporary boost of enjoyment. However, at the end of the day we still clock in and out. I feel the money spent on those enjoyments are as a goal for us to look forward and to be happy but I also feel that it is there as a goal because we are generally not happy in the first place otherwise it wouldn't bring us so much enjoyment and thereafter depression when we have to go back to reality (talking more about myself here). If we are not happy then, realistically and statistically, it has to be due to what we have mainly be doing with our life which is working. Then again, I need to work, otherwise I can't even live. I mean I need a roof, food and all those necessities to survive but it also begs the question, why do I need to survive in the first place? What is the purpose of me being alive? I generally feel hopeless about having to continue to live when everything is just a shit show"
dexterdrag,fe8jm61,t1_fe6y0eh,"I feel alone when I see my existence as pointless. Funny when someone asked if I enjoyed working and when I replied I'm indifferent because it is just work to me I was told that I'm too young to feel like this and how am I to survive if this is my outlook at this age. I was told to look for other jobs that pay more and allow more flexibility. I feel so depressed hearing that because it makes me feel extremely dumb and incompetent like it is that easy to get a high paying job with great flexibility and I unlike the mass am not able to clinch such a job. It also makes me feel so low, like I am that worthless that I have to settle for this job and lifestyle. Unfortunately, I don't have the qualification that is in demand where I can just go around and make demands. In my current position, more money means more work and boy, do I feel what is on my plate is enough. I hate it when people kept saying impliedly that, at the end of the day, I am not successful. Bloody hell"
Galliprant,fe8m2pw,t1_fe8i0jf,"It always comes back to that question of why. Why do any of that if I'm obviously so bad at it? Why do any of that if I'll just be miserable?

Everybody seems to be out there to *thrive*, while I'm just trying and struggling to keep my shirt together and *survive*. And everybody is constantly nagging and making fun of me - yes my job is stressful, I don't really like it that much, but I can do it even when depression hits hard. It provides me with a functionality even when everything sucks. That's more than most of my ""friends"" do, who are complaining about me not putting more effort into finding something else. I would, if right now I had the peace of mind and the capacity, but the pressure and the shirt I'm getting from ""friends"", don't really help with that.

People aren’t always able to understand that, and it’s easier some days then others. You can handle what you can handle. Do your best. Unfortunately, when it comes to other people putting you down, the best you can do is just force yourself to think that they don’t mean what you think they mean. They aren’t making fun of you, even though that’s how it feels. And you just have to deal with how you feel, honestly. You’re doing ok though.

Also they should be actually jealous you can have a ok lifestyle while working half of the time they do. Your mental health is your priority. Other people might have different priorities and this is ok too. 

I also hate the idea of slaving my life away. This is why I have high paying, very challenging but extremely flexible seasonal job and I dont care if people call me lazy because I take months off. 

On the side note: make sure you actually enjoy what you do. If you have the energy you can spend time off on education of self development and this is great investment. And if all you do is sleep cause your body needs it now that tis ok for some time too!  Good luck..and dont let peoples opinions affect you! You boyfriend should be more supportive. He probably is stick between you and his parents and does not realize you should be his priority and he should be having your back. He is adult now and he should stand against his parents to protect you. But he is still super young so I see this can be difficult."
asax9,fe76sfc,t3_eo1usb,"This seems to be the way asian culture think, but trust me, there are plenty of people in the western world who live alternative lifestyles. Digital nomads, people who work odd jobs, van dwellers and on and on. Don't fall into the trap of full time work, it is exactly that, a trap to keep you enslaved. Don't be ashamed of 'only' having a part time job either, that's more than many people in the world will ever have. Money is money, and as long as you get enough to have a basic existence that is good enough. Life is what you make it, and i'd rather have my freedom than spend 40+ years slaving away to make someone else rich."
AllHailSundin,fe89wox,t3_eo1usb,"I was placed into a part-time job by a government agency, and an struggling. I hadn’t worked in years because of my mother’s illness and my mental health, plus failing to find work before that.

I’m here now, and while I was told I’d be scanning and filing and doing office admin work, I’m the garbage collector, the floor sweeper and mopper, and then organizing papers that will be junked in a dirty room. Nobody knows what they want to do with the junk I’m moving and organizing, some of which has mould, and I just move it from one place to another then sit on Reddit most of the day.

I can’t wait to be let go, because this is not what I agreed to, is not giving me confidence and is making my mental health worse. I actively dread coming in here to make less than minimum wage doing this shit, and it’s making my IBS flare up too"

Who cares if it's only part time right now?  If you can only do part time for now because of your anxiety then that's great.  You're young and you have time, just getting the experience on your resume for now is awesome and will really help you out down the line when you're able to work more.

Honestly just don't even listen to them, some people just do not understand.  People who are so judgemental like that probably had an easy life with no real struggle or they would be more understanding of what other people deal with."
cyrusromeo,fe7x78n,t3_eo1usb,"I think you should give yourself credit for getting to that job while fighting anxiety and depression.

Good for you and keep up whatever you are doing to get there, and decide on a different answer to answer to anyone asking about why u work part time.... make it a positive...

If his parents are saying stuff, and he repeated back, was it a joke? I mean stuff can be said ""jokingly"" but be completely full of truth.

Fuck full time, let others destroy their souls working full time for a corporation or business that will never give a shit about them. It is a toxic capitalist bullshit human made concept, so the workers have to work to bones for the elite to enjoy life, while we work ourselves to death. Next time they try to pull that shit, tell them that full time work is unnatural to humans. We won't made for productivity, we were made to just fucking live, but the ruling class especially the US and China truly believe people are for means of production and nothing else. So fucked up. I can't wait for climate change to take all of us, or if we could already eat the fucking rich and put up laws against this fucking insanity we have allowed. I hate capitalism, and I believe almost all of my depression and anxiety stems from capitalism and the hellscape world it has created."
girl988,fe8w1tg,t3_eo1usb,"Girl, i’m the same exact way. I’ll be 22 in July, i’m doing school but all online and my parents own their own business so I can work there but I’ve been doing that since high school and every time I’m there i’m so used to everything that my mind is constantly running about everything and I just get more depressed. I wanted to move but my boyfriends mom is making him do classes so he has to stay and I can’t get myself to go alone. I don’t wanna get a job around here because i’ve looked and can’t find anything, and I don’t want just a normal job like at a store or restaurant because my anxiety is so bad and especially when seeing people I know. I was gonna work at this one children’s hospital as a adolescent girls care taker but I got scared and backed out, because I don’t know if I even wanna do that anymore. I feel like i’m failing at everything and my parents are so upset with me. I live at home so they know everything. I even went to my mom crying the other day and told her how I was sad all the time and she just doesn’t understand. It’s upsetting. My boyfriend says he understands but he doesn’t and he doesn’t understand sometimes I just need him to be there for me and hold me, not constantly try to make me talk to him. I just feel like no one understands and i’m going through this alone and everyone not understanding and forcing me to do stuff I don’t want to is only making it worse. I’m so unhappy and I don’t know what to do anymore."

FuriousTalons,fe9i3tq,t3_eo1usb,"I've been in your spot before. I could barely handle part time, and I knew my parents and family were disappointed in me.

I'm envious of my relatives who have gone to Greece, Italy, Scotland, and generally get to tour other countries while my immediate family is trying to plan to go to Yellowstone within the next 2 years...

I have a full time job now, but it's not a ""respectable"" one. I love it, but even working full time here I wouldn't be able to make it on my own due to the low pay. Our society is super bullshit - no one should have to work 2 jobs just to make ends meet. In addition to that, no one should have to work themselves sick from stress either."
Moshi2555,fe9lwag,t3_eo1usb,"I'm 22 too but a guy. I used to be really depressed a couple years ago and had zero motivation to do anything because I felt the same way. 
I had to try a lot of things before I found out what I really wanted in life. I dropped out of the army after 1 year, dropped out of college, failed at several business attempts. At this point I think most people would consider my life a failure. But, I choose to live my life according to what I want and not what society expects of me. Along the way I learned a lot about myself(and saved a lot of money too). I got fired from my last job because I didn't fit in socially, but it allowed me to stop making excuses and start my indie game dev company. I'm glad I took the risk to try all of these different things otherwise I would just be like most people who are just living life in a daze regretting they aren't living life to the fullest.

From my perspective, I think you just don't know what you want in life so you are lost. My suggestion is try and research many different things to find out what you want in life. You seem to believe work is a bad thing. I think you just haven't found your dream job. It took me trying so many things and failing so much before I found out I wanted to be a game dev and entrepreneur
. 
Also, the more money I make and the more things I try, I find out that many of the stuff I wanted I actually don't really want. I bought a $120 lobster dinner once but it wasn't as great as I imagined it. I thought I wanted to travel all the time but after traveling to Seattle for a couple days it started to get tiring and lost its appeal. Now, I realized that the simple life is good enough. Playing video games, watching anime, walking in the park, eating good home cooked food, and hanging with good company is plenty to enjoy life. And you don't need to be rich either to do that. The only reason I'm trying to get rich is for the financial security, but not for my happiness. You don't need to be rich to have true happiness."

Thirstythrowaway101,fe9ogpu,t3_eo1usb,"I too hate being a prole. I'm 26 and stepped down for the family. I've been working full time since graduating high school to help make ends meet. Fast forward to 4 yrs ago and I couldn't hold a job. 

I've always wanted to study full time. So I do. I have a little anxiety about school at times. But ""education makes a man unfit to be a slave""- fredrick Douglas. I now work in the library at my college part time. And I call off sometimes. I miss very few classes but sometimes I do feel anxiety and depressions weigh me down however a workout and study sessions make me feel better to take on life. 

Working full time i think is a full time expectation because people would rather work for someone else than to not do anything at all. Sometimes we are overwhelmed with life when we do nothing. 

I feel like people sometimes dont have other purposes with their time than make God money. They dont read, or work out. Or both if they do either. Time is worth more than money. So I'd rather have more time to explore life. 

But time laying in bed, I dont think is worth losing money you could've gained. Or I dont it's worth laying there for hours while we can get lost and see there is more to life than our hometowns.

Over time, you will be able to pick up more hours, without it seeming like a chaotic overcommitment.  
If you build routines which maximize for productivity and minimize time-sink, you will find that you can accomplish great things.  
You are nervous because you feel you are not up to the task.  You are depressed because you feel the effort is futile.  But if you are mindful of what actually transpires, you will begin to see these accomplishments.  

Perhaps your depression and anxiety are less circumstancial, more biochemical, than others; this is an unfortunate possibility, but that is a separate part of your situation altogether.  
The trick is to MAKE yourself follow the routines.

And don't forget to build in time to take care of you.  Like muscle heads who never got the gym on Sunday, so they can go to church and whatnot without any other obligations on them.  That's just a redneck self care day.

paladin_omega78,emt07l,top_level,"I...don't really know where else to let it out, but here goes.

2019 was quite simply, the worst year of my life. I was diagnosed with clinical depression late 2017, but the problems surmounted the past year. Came back home after graduating, thought things would finally change. But..bad breakup with the love of my life, unemployment and repeated repeated rejections, problems at home, had a ligament tear....it goes on and on. Wanted to start afresh the new decade, but it just plummeted lower and lower. Interviewed for this really awesome job last week but still haven't been gotten back to, so I think that's that- my last chance at some redemption is gone, im gonna have to stay home in this fucked up environment. Been shutting myself off everything, but a close friend invited me to his party today so ended up going. We were on the terrace smoking a fag, and at a time it was only me there. Then all the pent-up frustration let loose. All the failures had taken a toll, and I broke down. Went to the edge, said some words and was just ABOUT to jump when I saw something flash by me. A white trail of light. Wasn't a bird, or paper, or anything. My mind became even more blank but instead of jumping,  I staggered back and fell back on the floor. 

I am a man of science and am not supersititous but it just felt like a sign. To not give up, keep going. However the world keeps kicking me down. I still dont know why I didn't jump. Not that anything's better now, but dunno, just felt like this isn't the time. 

Sorry for the long post, I love this group (a lurker but still) and thought this would be the place to try to pen whatever i'm feeling into words.

If you hold on each day for just one more day,  you can make it through and things can change and get better."
paladin_omega78,fds70s6,t1_fdrsp5k,That really helped. Thank you friend. I mean it :)
GothWitchOfBrooklyn,fds8ds1,t1_fds70s6,I hope only the best for you in 2020!!
hjajwko,fdt8hyt,t3_emt07l,"I am literally going through the same thing as you, I was diagnosed with clinical depression in late 2017 and 2019 has been kicking me in the nuts. 

I have been unemployed and I feel so dejected and useless. I don’t know if time will make things better but I’m still going to try to live. 

Depression gets worse if you overthink and give up on yourself. 

Let’s get through this together buddy."
paladin_omega78,fdutwpp,t1_fdt8hyt,Absolutely mate. My inbox is always open if you wanna chat. Let's do this :)
LittleSmokeyWeiners,fds3d67,t3_emt07l,"2019 was a shit-ass year for many people (myself included). If depression was a Chinese Zodiac, it would be for 2019. And I fucking hate to be that person, but it can or even will get better. It just takes some really fucked up situations to make you stronger. Suicide is something that can stay in the back of your head, like you know what your capable of doing. Stay strong."
mommy-in-need,fdsilg2,t3_emt07l,2019 damn near killed me. NOTHING is helping the depression. I just want to be normal.

paladin_omega78,fds748v,t1_fds4cx2,Aye. They say the light shines the brightest after the darkest night. Hope to see the dawn soon.
cestlavie2728,fds7m9c,t1_fds748v,"Exactly :) I believe that flash of light was real. And I have faith in you. I wish you the best, friend."
Scradzz,fdsddx2,t3_emt07l,"Hey man a lot of us will go through some very tough times in our lives, when theres so much compiling like in your instance its very easy to have those thoughts, most people have probably had them in their life but wont admit it, nobody’s perfect.

Glad to hear you made it to the other side of the thoughts whatever it may be that saved you.

If you ever need a chat ill be around 😁"
paladin_omega78,fdutmxd,t1_fdsddx2,"Thanks bud, appreciate the message. I'm always down to have new conversations :)"
DisabledMuse,fdsi4ju,t3_emt07l,Wow. I'm glad you got a sign! Sounds like you've had a tough time but I have a feeling things are going to change for you. Also a person of science but I know there is a lot we don't understand. Maybe someone is looking out for you.
rolplix,fdsqlzg,t3_emt07l,"2019 was absolute dookie. On a cruise with my family and I walked the top deck every night debating if I should jump. glad I didn't and glad u didn't either. don't wanna miss out on the tiny fun things in life tbh, even if they don't last"
powerpuffgirl3,fdsxar6,t3_emt07l,"OP I'm so sorry you felt this way.  I have been there.  It is a lonely and sad feeling, but at the same time you feel everything and nothing.  I think you saw a spirit, an angel, they come through for us when we need it most.

I wish you all the love in the world.  Life is fucking hard.  Stay strong."
paladin_omega78,fdutuke,t1_fdsxar6,"Thank you so much. I dunno what light I saw, but hopefully life ends up having a bit more of light after this. Much love, blossom!"

ivanator27,fdtm8wy,t3_emt07l,"Just from my experience, having dealt with and beat depression, in the moment you simply cannot see how it would get better or how you will go about doing that but it does, trust me. I never believed it but my life is much better now. Keep fighting there is a reason you were born and most importantly still are here on this earth, you just haven't found it yet and you must do some searching. Best of luck to you."
IRSparkytheWonderdog,fe2h8kx,t3_emt07l,"OP, how you doing today? Caring folks want to know."
paladin_omega78,fe6rs67,t1_fe2h8kx,"Better I guess. Still waiting on that job, the anxiety is always there. But I’ll persevere. Thank you for checking in, mate :)"
IRSparkytheWonderdog,fdqynub,t3_emt07l,"Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  Yes, life sucks right now, but it WILL get better - you're absolutely right: This isn't the time - and it never will be.  Somewhere, you have people who care about you and who would miss you if you were gone.  Sometime, you will meet the right one, and the pain will all be worth it.  Posting here is a great first step toward reaching out for a connection with people who understand and empathize with what you are going through, and can offer a shoulder to steady yourself on when it gets to be too much."
AverageDingbat,fds11il,t1_fdqynub,"Saying that ""it WILL get better"" is disinformation. How can you know for sure? That doesn't help the OP."
IRSparkytheWonderdog,fdsi1ly,t1_fds11il,"Because I've been kicking around this planet for nearly 60 years, and I've been where OP is.  Between then and now there have been a lot of ups and downs, but I wouldn't trade those experiences for anything.  If I would have taken that last step a long time ago, I would have never had them.  Hang in there, OP.  It's worth it."
TrueSpins,fds57ot,t1_fds11il,Agree. Hate this. No one can guarantee life will get better. But it might...
AHBS8,fds6opu,t1_fds11il,Nobody can know that it will get better but suicide guarantees that it definitely won't get better. Hugs to everyone here \*
AceCurrentRL,fdsjcz3,t1_fds11il,So you’re saying you should only make a claim if you know for sure? Nothing’s guaranteed.
wirescraper,fdsy1lr,t1_fdsjcz3,What if it not getting worse actually means it’s gotten better?
Hyperungen01,enqkiy,top_level,It happens to me sometimes and honestly it is one of the most gut-wrenching feelings.
Background-Temporary,fe3vrqy,t3_enqkiy,The first really “autumn” day of the year always transports me back to being a kid on Halloween. That was a simpler time and things were going good.
Hyperungen01,fe3xf3l,t1_fe3vrqy,"It’s usually summer for me and yes, those blue-eyed times where you could just focus on living..."
TheDevAbides,fe4h7ea,t3_enqkiy,"Part of me wishes I could forget the ""good times"".

When those feelings come up it just further contrasts how terrible I feel now.

It is especially crushing."
ImaBandito1,fe5ko3r,t3_enqkiy,"Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young

How come? I'd never be able to identify where it's coming from. I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it. Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one.

&#x200B;

It would be to my brother cause we have the same nose, same clothes homegrown a stone's throw from the creak we used to roam but it would remind us of when nothing really mattered, out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter..."
gafoja,fe5szww,t3_enqkiy,"What an interesting topic. Yes, I have had that sensation. It's usually just some natural fragrance, and for a moment, I'm reminded of good, unburdened times. And then I just want to shut those memories off -- I can't bear the thought of longing for what was. I'm suddenly aware of this incredible chasm between where I am and where I used to be. I'm grateful you brought this up; it's just good to feel understood.

Good luck to you."
castor_troy07,fe3zao2,t3_enqkiy,Yup. I get it and i get it strong. It’s somewhat crushing.
cy6erbird,fe3wwdt,t3_enqkiy,"I think I can relate, but partially.
When I smell something unusual, it instantly reminds me of something good (like countryside chill with my friends or visiting granny when I was a kid), maybe those thoughts are evoked since the unusual scents align perfectly, can't be sure about that.
Now that I think about it, scents somehow actually lead to some nostalgy, but for me that's about little moments, not whole ""grass was more green, now it's nothing like it's used to be before"".
Very interesting topic, thanks for the post!"
Hyperungen01,fe3xk0w,t1_fe3wwdt,"Yeah that’s it, nostalgia. It’s a hard feeling to describe because it’s usually tied to someting specific. Scents (especially nature) are a huge trigger for me."
Sockfucker9000,fe4kllt,t3_enqkiy,"The smell of balsam poplar reminds me of being in my early teens in central Texas in the early 80s, somehow.  
When I was still optimistic and had imagination & so on."
SureNarwhal,fe4x6sp,t3_enqkiy,"Oh sure.  Not that things were ever good, really, but there were at least good moments in the past.  As much as I hated my childhood, I was much more innocent then and there were moments when I did feel happiness, I think.  Now, there's nothing really good about life.  I can't really remember those feelings because I can't feel things properly and my memory is all fucked up, but I think I did.  Well, until something triggers it...like you said, it's gut wrenching."
B_Baerbel,fe5dxf2,t3_enqkiy,I moved back to the area I grew up in 7 years ago. In the summer it's the same smell like back in the day when I rode my bike and had no worries. Hits you like a smack in the face when you realize what happened since then so yeah. I can relate but I have absolutely no clue on how to deal with it. Just know you're not alone my dude
Tattooedwhovian,fe5h8wj,t3_enqkiy,Yes. Whenever the air feels an smells a certain way or if I hear a certain song or if the weather is a certain way I remember a time when it was better or simpler and a time where I was actually happy.
What_I_do_45,fe5kzla,t3_enqkiy,"Yup. I can smell the better, but I don't feel it anymore."
unlikely1879,fe5sl9m,t3_enqkiy,"Holy fuck yes. The smell of the morning air takes me back to my youth (youth relatively speaking I'm still quite young). I remember stepping out in to the garden and smelling the air. I was excited to start my day, there was so much that excited me and I had so much to look forward to and so much potential. I remember the afternoon air, towards sunset when me and my friends would go home after a day of playing. It was peaceful and serene. I remember the night time air, when I would crack a window to help me sleep. It took me to a happy place. I don't think I'll ever have those feelings again, and the smell of the air is a brutal and unavoidable reminder of what I've lost."
jlfaloon71,fe59szt,t3_enqkiy,Yes!!
Otaku_Queen669,fe5zubo,t3_enqkiy,Yep. Usually the first day if school or when I go to a friends house and I see all the happy and brite stuff.
CarryOnCarrion38,fe689ra,t3_enqkiy,"For me, there never was a 'better time'. My life's been shit through and through, though it looks like it's both getting better and worse at the same time. Some fucking how."
JskyeJ,fe6adry,t3_enqkiy,"Literally always. I can feel those feelings when things were better, and then I have to feel them fade as the emptiness crashes back in. It’s like a momentary high that leaves me chasing something I can never truly experience again."
WedScaramouch,fe6amn4,t3_enqkiy,I caught a whiff of paint earlier today and it reminded me of a time two years ago back in high school when i was painting sets for my school's production. fuck i miss those times. i was swimming in the amount of friends i had. now ive gotten so lonely
jay-sid-,fe5bzsz,t3_enqkiy,No But i Can take a deep breath outside and depending on the weather different memories come flashing through my mind . Really weird feeling
unbrokenstreamof,fe5la57,t3_enqkiy,Yes! So often. Or often it reminds me of the invisible wall between me and non depressed people. Hang in there.
Nickronicle,fe5pta2,t3_enqkiy,Tf how's this so accurate
plushiepoke,fe8a1n4,t3_enqkiy,"For me, it’s anything that reminds me of preschool-2nd grade. The scent of those wooden puzzles where you would put shapes in the right spot. The smell of kids paint. Plastic toy animals... The most pure memories of my life. I was helping my 5 year old niece do one of those wooden puzzles yesterday, and I had to take a moment to just sit there and take in how good it made me feel to go back to that for a little. I was close to tears, honestly."

Yeah i get Depressed and then feel empty for that whole day. And then i wake up the next day and im fine until something triggers it. I dont really know anymore. Its just such an ongoing feeling suicide atm is extremely comforting to think about. I feel like comfort is one thing i need because it gives me an escape route. The structuring of my sentences is awful i know. Cant really be bothered to take the time to correct it kind of just wanto right my feelings. I assume no one will reply or even read this but this feeling is so recurrent in my life. And im getting tired. It is draining i just wanto be comfortable financially and emotionally. I left school and dont work or study. I go to the gym and do bodybuilding. My dream is to become a bodybuilder but that dream becomes more and more vague every day with doubt. My parents are poor and are in a complicated situation. Most of the time if im not eating or at the gym or sleeping or planning meals etc. Im on the internet trying to learn about nutrition and fitness. Or watching twitch which is what i do a lot. Anyway i dont know anymore i might kill myself but i probably wont or definitely wont i dont know."

louisagoth,emvtuu,top_level,"I’ve spent too long suffering and I can’t do it anymore but equally, I can’t bear the thought of hurting my parents. I can’t speak to them about how suicidal I feel because whenever I have before they’ve just got worried but have not been able to help in any way. They have no idea how to discuss mental health and it ends up making me feel more isolated. 

I’ve made the decision that I can’t face carrying on much longer, but whenever I begin to plan to end my life I start to feel so deeply guilty at the thoughts of my parents having to deal with that. 

I’m so torn about it because then when I think of carrying on for them, which has always been my motivation, I don’t want to keep feeling this debilitating pain any longer"

HCCI,fds3f6p,t3_emvtuu,"I feel the same. Been 24/7 depressed for 9 years with a few good days in between. Fuck my life.
Good luck"
Frankenmoo1,fdtw3os,t3_emvtuu,"I unfortunately know exactly how you feel. For the longest ( close to 20 years) ive been dealing with suicidal thoughts, though I attempted once in high school but I couldn't go through with it. I realized that I couldn't hurt my mom so I bottled it. 

I decided to join the military at 23 so it could happen without me doing it, because I figured this way it wouldnt hurt my mom as much and then I met wife in the military. 
For a while it was good but the thoughts kept slowly kept creeping in, ive tried to talk about my depression with her but I dont think she understands that its not about being sad, its just a constant feeling of not wanting to live, Like the world would be better without me. 
I decided that I would get some help, went to a counselor and she helped with ""softening the dark voice"" but with personal issues and the realization that now I have one more person that I could hurt if I hurt myself made the thoughts got worse and  worse. Counselor got me on ssri's and I felt better for a while until I started to feel ""numb"" to everything including the thoughts.

(Feeling numb is not necessarily better)

I thought that was the end of it, ""I was fixed"" I thought but one thing that they dont tell you about ssri's is that they make you not cum lol. So I stopped using them.

Now (4 months ago) my twin boys were born and I'm happy because I love them but I'm more depressed because of the same reasons, I want to end my pain everyday but I dont want my boys to live without a father like I did. 

After all my rambling all I want to say to you is, the pain from the depression is rough and the fight you have in your head to smile while all you want to do is end it can be head splitting but ending it is not the answer because you are letting your depression beat you. Talk to a counselor, write in journal, take medication or smoke some weed (best thing that helps me) but killing your self is not the fix.

I dont know what triggers your deppression (mine is feeling like a failure) but I can tell you that once you find that trigger it helps fight the bastard in your head telling you ""kill yourself "". Its not easy to fight it nor softens it when you do feel depressed but it will help to go more and more days between the constant thoughts. 

I hope this helps you 
Remember find your trigger"

I thank tge universe for providing my needs and the amazing breakfast I had.  I thank myself for taking care of my body. Then I go talk with people Up and out of the house.

I have no one. god I am so tired of living and I think about killing myself like nearly everyday. Life is such a fucking struggle and I hate every minute of it.

Don't throw away your life just because your engulfed in darkness because your not alone and if you are I will be that light you need to get your life back on course and yes I might be a total stranger but every human deserves a happy life including you so let this be the first step towards happiness"

As gruelling as what you are feeling and experiencing is, there are always opportunities to lend your perspective to others that see the world differently in order to rebalance your own. That might help with making a change to your current state of feels.

And whilst using Reddit to ventilate your woes to people that know what you're going through is comforting, I would argue that it's much more important to use your voice to express how you feel. 

Our bodies vibrate when we speak. These vibrations move in accordance with a range of emotion, denoted by pitch & timbre and things we don't even think about, and in conversation, we subconsciously pick up on these things. You can't get that with the internet. So if there's one thing that you could do to feel better in order to make a change, please make expression that thing.

I feel exactly the same, couldn't have said it better myself. I wonder if a cure for this exists."
0nemorelight,em82f6,top_level,"I'm not sure if it was a cry for help, or a legitimate attempt, but it has really gotten to me. I was working the nightshift just stocking shelves and a girl approached me asking me if she could buy two packets of paracetamol. I told her she had to go to the self checkouts, but she begged me to let her buy them now from myself. She said she had already bought some and wont be allowed to buy more. I told her it is store policy and that we cant sell more than two, and asked her if she really needed them then and there, and told her to wait and get more when she needs them. 

But seeing her face, I realised theere was something deeper going on. It's a face I recognised all too well, as I once had to help a close friend who had overdosed on paracetamol before, as well as my sister, and I too have attempted suicide via overdose in the past, albeit with other drugs rather than paracetamol. I saw her desperation as she begged me for them, saying she isn't a shop lifter but will run out with them if i don't let her buy them, so I pleaded with her to come with me somewhere quiet so I could speak to her. 

We went to the bathroom and I asked her what was going on, and what had happened to make her feel this way. I tried to reassure her that she wasn't alone in how she was feeling, I told her in such a way that she realised I was speaking from personal experience, but it didn't seem to do much to change her mind. She did cry and start to open up a little, and I tried to convince her to go to a hospital, but she showed me scars on her arm and told me she's already gone before and nobody cared. She became even more unstable and started taking the paracetamol off of me and opening it, swallowing four pills down with a drink before I could snatch the packets back off her. I didn't want to, and I was barely keeping it together myself, but it's the only thing I could do. I ran to get security but he wasnt allowed in the girls bathroom, so I had to go back in there and coax her out. I was worried because she had already bought and possibly taken two packets of 16, which can be toxic. 

I finally got her to come out with me and she tried to pay the security for the paracetamol. He was absolutely no help, and I felt completely alone like I was the only one trying to do something. My boss came down and he is the worst communicator in the history of communicators, like robots show more emotion than this guy, so he also did nothing except say that there is nothing I can do except let her go, so the girl walked off and went out. 

I guess I just feel like a bit of a failure, like I couldn't help her, couldn't think of the right words. I almost froze and I don't know what gave me the confidence to talk to her but I did my best. My boss called 111 (UK non-emergency police number), and I spoke to the police and they had a patrol looking for her, I just wish I could have done more and I hope nothing I did or said caused her to potentially put herself in more danger. 

Any advice on putting this behind me? It's brought some stuff of the past back, things i'd rather forget, and I feel like nobody really cares what I went through. It was very emotionally harrowing and I spent the rest of the shift just overthinking everything and wishing I had somebody to speak to about how much it affected me."
JumpingJackJoe,fdmygtm,t3_em82f6,"Hopefully, she does realize that someone cares/d about her. It sounded like you did care about her wellbeing and tried to have her look at other options.  That said,  you realize you tried your best and that's all you can ask for. It sucks that this happened, but please don't best yourself up too much over it."
0nemorelight,fdnjoz0,t1_fdmygtm,"Yeah I cared a lot, she wasn't just a stranger to me she was somebody who was desperate and wanted somebody to help her. I'll try not to, just think that in this day and age there should be better provisions for things like this, and I should not have had to convince my boss and security to get her help"
JumpingJackJoe,fdnnin0,t1_fdnjoz0,"I don't know if it makes you feel any better, but years ago. There was a certain person who ran away from home and was upset.

This is why I agree with you that you shouldn't have had to convince your boss or security to get her help. At the same time, some people (not all) are to worried about getting involved or simply don't care.

iamconfusedta,fdnevtu,t1_fdnauk1,Some people don't realize how much painful an overdose is. They think they're just gonna fall asleep and die.
MiserysBastard,fdnh2ld,t1_fdnauk1,Yes. Suicide by overdose is actually a fairly unsuccessful method. A lot of people don't know that. It's normally depicted as effective and just falling asleep peacefully. Documented cases show a method such as paracetamol overdose can be an extremely excruciating experience with a lot of damage to your liver and other systems. If you die it could sometimes take days of suffering before you go. Not a good way to die.
DalIuTae,fdnulkj,t1_fdnevtu,"Not wanting to give hints but with the right drugs (all controlled), it is actually just falling asleep and dying. Thankfully, those drugs are heavily controlled."

Mostly any drug with CNS or Respiratory depression side effects. And some pretty normal (still requiring prescription) drugs have those.

No OTC drugs will work though."
MiserysBastard,fdn8unx,t3_em82f6,"You did your best in the situation. You did all the right things in trying to talk to her first and then alerting higher authority when things got bad. It's not your fault that she left. She must have been in a very very lonely and desperate state. I know how you feel cause I tried to talk my cousin out of swallowing my monthly blood pressure meds while he was locked in the bedroom but he did anyway. Well he came out himself before passing out and I had to drag him outside before I got someone to help me put him in the car to rush him to the hospital.  And the ride wasn't easy. I felt guilty for failing to talk him out and not driving fast/effectively enough. He survived though and he's really well mental healthwise, though he's been having challenges here and there with life. But he's overall good. Point is you shouldn't beat yourself up cause whatever happened you really did well on your part. It's not an easy situation to deal. I'm sorry this happened to you and I'm sorry that she found herself in that spot too.  Know that I'm proud of you for doing something about it unlike the other people who were around."
0nemorelight,fdni4hg,t1_fdn8unx,"I guess, I just wish people around me didn't take it so lightly like oh theres nothing you can do just get back to work like all they care about is getting their own stuff done which angered me cause I feel like I could have done more. If something went bad I'd feel like that was on me, and I don't want that weight on my shoulders. Ah I am so sorry that happened to you, it must have been scary and sad. That is a really good anecdote actually. I guess you can't always talk someone out of it and it's not our fault if we can't, sometimes people are just in a desperate state. Glad he is okay now. Thankyou that means a lot. Sometimes I hate having all this empathy but seeing how cold some people are I am glad to have a heart!"
MiserysBastard,fdpyq78,t1_fdni4hg,Yeah I've had challenges with my own empathy. Sometimes it feels like a burden. But then there are moments when you realize it's better that I could feel that way cause then some people wouldn't have felt like they matter in that particular moment.
parikuma,fdncizh,t3_em82f6,"This is a sad example of how much the world is proving her right. They don't understand, they don't try, and they don't care. 

As a side note, you can perhaps check out some of the resources out there to either share with staff/colleagues or perhaps even make available in-store to people who might come in a similar state of mind as that person.  
My quick research seems to indicate that save.org does a good deal in that direction:  
https://save.org/what-we-do/products-and-resources/print-resources/    
https://save.org/product-category/pdf-files-coming-soon/   

Seems like the staff you work with should be made aware of what they could do to spot someone vulnerable and to help out as much as possible. When you were comforting her, another person should have been calling on the helpline to guarantee a continuity of care from your current place to the team showing up.  
Nevertheless, your actions might have made the difference between that girl's life and death, and anyone in a similar situation should be as equipped as possible to make a difference too. Seek to share the empathy you have with others so that they get to understand that being able to help is a gift they could learn to give too.  
  
I think if she went with paracetamol there's a decent chance it will be more of a messed up attempt (which might still land her in the hospital, lead to complications for the liver and potentially other organs, and hurt like a bitch), and I hope you get to have some news someday.. You did a lot, and it obviously hit you hard too, so I suggest you talk about it with competent people for your own sake. Thanks for caring."
0nemorelight,fdnh390,t1_fdncizh,"I agree, the main reason this affected me so much was the attitude of my colleagues. Then the lack of follow up with me about the incident. I ended up having to go for a walk clear my head and sit away from everyone. I know more could have been done if more people gave a damn. Pretty upsetting, and I hope at least one person caring showed her that she can come back from this. 

Yeah paracetamol can be toxic to the liver even though she said she didn't feel anything I told her it can be a delayed reaction and pleaded with her to go to the hospital. I hope she did. Thank you I hope so too. I'll probably talk about it with my closer colleagues, although today it just felt like people wanted to gossip about it rather than let me express how it made me feel so I avoided the conversation. Guess that's the way most people are. Shame really"
parikuma,fdnidun,t1_fdnh390,"Take the time to digest some of it first, and if-or-when you have the ability to talk to closer colleagues, do so. Keeping in mind that they're probably not quite as far down the path of understanding as you are, and that they might take some time and energy to understand what you're even talking about.  
By being in this world and doing what you think is best, with empathy, you've helped her and will help others like her. Helping out is a privilege and not a burden, which is what I hope your colleagues will come to understand.  
Most people on subreddits like this one have a profound feeling that nobody cares, which comes from experiences with people who don't help them. At the darkest times, it feels like it's the only truth, especially when our empirical data (limited experiences we can have) backs it up. But it's not the whole picture.  
While you can't change the world unilaterally (because you're not everybody, you're just one person), every bit counts a lot. Every person helped is an infinity of possibilities, so thanks for what you did. And good luck going forward!"
0nemorelight,fdnj57l,t1_fdnidun,"Yeah you're right there. I don't want them to think I am over sensitive, I'm usually the bubbly bright one, everyone says I smile too much etc, so I think it would be weird for them to see me like that, so for now I'll just process and take time as you say. I agree, I am happy that I am able to empathise, it's a skill I am positive I want to develop into a career. I'm actually glad it was me it happened to, because anybody else and I would fear for what might happen. I still fear but I know that at least it was somebody who cared and understood rather than somebody who might have dismissed her or worse still, let her buy the paracetamol if they hadn't picked up on her body language. That is very profound and very true. I'm glad I could help. Thankyou!"
Wattsherfayce,fdne12y,t3_em82f6,This would be something you could call a crisis hotline about. They have trained staff who can help you process what you had gone through.

Wattsherfayce,fdnkliz,t1_fdnh6pj,"If you look up your local crisis line, it will tell you on their website ""who usually calls?""

You were this persons first responder and you are experiencing a block in processing. They welcome calls like yours with open ears. The least they can do is give you a live person to bounce your feelings off... which will help you process it all in the end.

The thing about a crisis is that you cant compare it to another persons. It's all a unique experience, and there is no hierarchy."
LoneArcher96,fdn4mqi,t3_em82f6,"Maybe try to find where she is now, and pay her a visit to show her someone actually cares, this will give her hope and will surely help you to put it behind."

NightZone3,fdncn7q,t3_em82f6,"You did your best and took the packets off her so you fulfilled your duty of care within the environment you were in at that time.

Sadly people like this can often end up making multiple attempts and it's the responsibility of their family/friends/the mental health system to be offering the support ideally.

I tried to offer support to a lady via twitter in the past who was threatening suicide and had tried to hang herself a number of times.  I spoke to her on there with others and we tried to get mental health services involved  - she was already on their radar - and I chatted to her on Facebook, listened to her problems (which sounded pretty complex) and offered to visit her but she didn't want this.  There's only so much you can do when a person isn't open to receiving support."
0nemorelight,fdnhoo4,t1_fdncn7q,"Yeah when I was talking to her she said she had been to the hospital before, I think for self harm by the looks of it. She also said she did have family who cared so I hope that was something for her to hold onto. She said nobody seems to care and unfortunately over in the UK at least, NHS is so stretched that mental health is very low priority for them. But I hope she saw that if even a random stranger cares, there's still hope. 

That was really nice of you! You're right, sometimes all you can do is speak to someone and offer them help and support and the rest is up to them. They have to want to get better after all"
NightZone3,fdnifoe,t1_fdnhoo4,"Thanks

NHS Mental Health services are pretty bad as there's lot of gatekeeping and very long waiting lists.  It's a mistake to rely on any service being provided full stop or that it will even be appropriate as it tends to be a one a one size fits all thing.

People need to read up on their condition themselves, join support forums online and get appropriate medication via their GP if needed."

0nemorelight,fdp0wqk,t1_fdnrno3,Me too.
DalIuTae,fdnti4x,t3_em82f6,"Well, it was more a cry for help than suicide. Paracetamol won't kill you with a super overdose, it kills you if you take a lot for a period of time. Single huge dose of paracetamol is ""safe"" enough that Paracetamol is the drug of choice to mix on Codeine packets. Ever wondered why put such small painkiller in a pill with such a strong painkiller? its not there to help the Codeine, its there to cause paracetamol overdose BEFORE Codeine overdose. The Paracetamol overdose will cause vomiting and diarrhea, which will prevent the remainder of Codeine from being absorbed.

Most people who get serious liver damage due to paracetamol have been taking big (non overdose) doses of it for long periods of time. But a single overdose will cause you to be so ill that you end up getting treatment and Paracetamol HAVE an antidote that can be administered in the ER (or you can take it yourself even).

My advice to put this behind you is: it happens, people are depressed, and sometimes they will try self-harm. In my experience, you cannot kill yourself with OTC drugs (yes, most ER visits are due to paracetamol overdose, but they do not always lead to death, often a quick treatment to clean the system off of it and then liver monitoring). Almost all drugs that can be lethal in overdose are controlled.

Here stays my warning: thinking of self-harm, don't use Paracetamol, it will just grant you a visit and bad day at the ER. Worst thing you can do when you are depressed and down is to make it worse."
0nemorelight,fdp0p4l,t1_fdnti4x,"Yeah I agree I think she knew it wouldn't necessarily kill her, and told me because she wanted help, which is even sadder to be honest. Feeling so alone you have to count on the kindness of a stranger to get you help. Yup believe my I know all about codeine and paracetamol based tablets, we call it co codamol here or zapain etc. I used to be addicted to them. I also attempted a codeine and diazepam overdose a few years ago, without the paracetamol though, for the reasons you outlined. My friend at University was hospitalised for a paracetamol overdose and it didn't cause any lasting damage, which is the main reason why I believe the girl will be okay, physically anyway. 

But thanks for the info, I am sure some people will read it and learn something new. It certainly seems like an uncomfortable way to overdose, as you'd have to take a LOT for it to be fatal, and even then it would be a slow and agonising death not the calm and peaceful death people would believe."

Which the world honestly needs so much more of."

And you know what - when this unnamed girl was at one of her lowest points of life, you was beside her, you tried your best. Will she realise it or not, you were that one person who cared - not your boss, not her friends, not security guy, but you. You became that one person, the person who you wished long time ago would be there by your side to care and listen what you went through. I'm glad you shared this story, I hope this girl will find some way through things. I'm proud of you."
0nemorelight,fdnox2k,t1_fdnman9,"This was lovely, thank you so much. You're so right, I wanted to be the person I wish I had when I was in a similar situation. I hope I gave her some kind of hope, knowing people do care. Me too. And thankyou!"

Starthelegend,eofgoa,top_level,Are you someone’s favorite person? I’ve come to the realization recently that I’m not ones favorite. No wakes up in the morning excited to see me. No one texts me to make sure I get home safe. No looks out for me when I’m hurting. And no one is there for me when my dark thoughts start to bubble. How common is the feeling? Is it something rare? It can’t just be me at least I hope it’s not who knows at this point anymore.

elizaofhousestark,fecypd1,t1_fecf86f,"**I am someone’s favorite person.** But that’s not always a good thing.

We’ve been together 5 years but I’ve been suicidal for 10 years now. Everytime I have a depressive episode, an anxiety attack, or an urge to take my life, I struggle against telling him how I feel. On one hand, I don’t want him to carry the burden of seeing how much I suffer.  On the other hand, I can’t just bottle up my affliction all to myself (I tried therapy but it didn’t work for me, and I decided to stop my medicine after 2 years of taking them. I also find it impossible to open up to family and friends.).

So yeah, having someone love you despite how messed up you are can be a source of happiness, hope, and love but dealing with mental illness can also be very painful and confusing for both of you.

I sometimes think it would be much easier to die if nobody loved me.

Also, what happens when he stops loving me and leaves me? How the fuck do I even proceed after that?"

If I just randomly died and there was no one to tell anyone about it it would be weeks if not months before people would realize I’m gone. My biggest fear if I die is people writing phony shit on my facebook and pretending they “miss” me so much. With that said I’ve been learning to love myself.

Plus, I’m pretty certain the people I would consider to be my closest friends have friends they’re closer to than me. 

It just feels hard to love myself when it feels like no one likes me that much. For a while my friends tried to refute this when I told them how sad I was, but they’ve stopped trying — probably because they know it’s futile, and/or they’re exhausted by my sadness and don’t know what to say.

I wouldn't say he ever really looked out for me or had my back, though, and actually dissed me a lot when it could get him social status. I dropped connection with him completely shortly after I finished college saying I only wanted true friends in my life after he had sent me a text and wanted to have a contest to hook up with as many women as possible. Someone told me he felt bad, but he never said anything, and we haven't talked in 11 years. There are times I still think about contacting him despite how I was treated having been friendless for a long time, but fortunately, I haven't done that yet.

You have to get in touch with the parts of you that are the most YOU that you can be: in terms of humor, your taste, and what you enjoy doing with your time. I am incredibly lucky to have a partner that feels that way about me (and I her), and it is absolutely a result of us both having had the time to find what we cared about in ourselves, others, and the world enough to have very defined senses of humor and tastes to where we just never run out of things to talk about or enjoy, to the point where we have to make an effort to hang out with our friends. We both still struggle horribly with depression sometimes, but we always love and appreciate each other. I hope the very best for you and I hope you get into therapy and give yourself the love and care you deserve so that you will someday be a favorite person to all your favorite people."

1. Distract yourself from the pointlessness of everything.

Debaser1990,fe9jn2z,t3_eo71t2,"While obviously this only applies to my experience, for me it's a double edged sword that is my craving for freedom,adventure and new experiences. My soul craves adventure and this is both the source of my depression and my drive to somehow get past it and manage to live the life I desire. 

I'm trapped in a situation of financial torture, My depression requires that I work a job with a flexible schedule, which leaves me doing rideshare, it's great because I don't have to explain to a boss why I can't come in on those days that the depression is overwhelming, however this affects my income if it happens too often. Thus leaving me in a cycle of working just enough to pay the bills and eat but never having savings to go anywhere or do anything. 

I suppose where i'm going with this is, having a goal could help some people, I want nothing more than to see the world and have new, better experiences, I want to finish the Mongol Rally one day without chronic financial troubles and a narcissistic teammate bringing me down. 

Of course the dark side to this being, it seems so unobtainable that it puts me in a depressed state which only serves to lessen my income and make getting out there again even more unobtainable.

Following herds, traveling, working only 4-6 hours a day (like our ancestors used to.) Anyone here read the book Sapiens? I'm reading it now and it's all I can think about.

I already failed one exam...Oh also I'm kinda looking forward to having sex for the first time, my friend tells me it's not that big of a deal, but I'm curious. Falling in love, gettin old (if I ever get that far, I'm just curious about it), having enough money to buy fancy cheese or something. Living on my own and not having family members judge my every decision. Basically I imagine a lot of things and sometimes I get curious about them?? Even cheesy shit like a wedding and moving in with someone and maybe adopting a child? Or like a cat, I'll figure that out if I live to see it. I have no idea why I'm still here, I'm probably just a coward, and also I love my friends too much. Probably the only thing that matters at this point. I just try to hang into unimportant stuff too.

Back to your questions, surely there were times where you didn't think about life's point but were just normally living or even happy. I tend to see that these kind of questions are false too. Not more real than the normal emotions you get from seeing friends, being home. Now that's if you have friends and home that make you feel happy.

My trick in general, is to let the question flow off me, and do something average (walking, some groceries). Maybe try something new albeit I rarely do so."

hydratehydrate,fec88uw,t3_eo71t2,"I relate super hard. I feel like I've done everything I wanted to accomplish in life and I'm only 29. This seems really freaking dumb but there's nothing else I want to do, and everything seems like I'm just faking it. I am at a spot right now where I only work when I want to, I have no desire to have children or pets, I'm pretty unattached. I take music classes, singing lessons, exercise daily, eat healthy, but I'm still pretty hopeless. I want to say that the constant dopamine hits that I've gotten BY accomplishing anything now has just altered my brain chemistry or something. Like I'm just now naturally depressed, ""likes"" don't do anything for me except exude an ""oh okay"", I look forward to going home and getting tea and then when I do all the intruding thoughts come in. I meditate a LOT and it just isn't great for me anymore. The thought of falling in love even bums me out because I've been there, done that and it just hurts too much to let anyone in. I just broke up with someone who told me they're in love with me because I didn't want to have a future where I'd have to care for his child (and I've been back and forth saying, maybe I should -- maybe being attached for a little while will ground me).

I found one job position that looked super exciting to me but I play the tape forward and I know that I'll do a great job and then at the end, I'll be back to this place of misery. I even set goals like being the president of the USA and I know that if I work hard at it, I could actually probably achieve it (I'm a bi racial female who is a creative director/strategist for a growing non profit and works at a homeless shelter and with addicts; and I have a lot of creative ideas for UBI/HC)

I'm in a city that I dislike and thinking about moving to another city at the end of next month, but I just think of how difficult and time consuming it's going to be to make relationships and find friends over the age of 25. It's not worth it, and it makes me think of just going back to the dude I just broke up with, at least he HAS to stay in the city for the next 10 years. It might be a good thing that he's so committed. I'm not even seeking happiness anymore, I just want some damn inner peace. Something tells me I should delete social media but honest to God it's sometimes the only social interaction I get (not for lack of trying). I'm just tired of getting to know people and then finding out they are Antifa or hate on other people because they're not feminists etc OR they're trying to sell you something. It makes me not want to try to sell my art to people, knowing I can potentially come across like that. It's shitty, like I want to be twice removed from all people. Bleh.

I did a study of product design by going into a ton of Japanese department stores and had a mental breakdown about a month in. Seeing all of the CRAP we've made with packaging and knowing that 99% is going to end up in a landfill just devastates me to a point where I have to mentally prepare myself to go grocery shopping and just go into the store get exactly what I need and get out. It helps when I put on music or a podcast while I shop. I feel tremendous guilt knowing I'm contributing to the destruction of the Earth at such a rapid pace. 

I've never been seriously depressed before and I think this is it. I feel so confused and uncertain and really tired and the only thing that's holding me up is the thought of disappointing my brother if I took myself out of the world. We're not even that close. We talk maybe once a month. I'm crying as I write this. Maybe that's what I look forward to. He's really cool.

I also have to pay my mom back $20,000. and I know I'll be able to achieve that if I apply myself. Maybe that'll put me in a better head space once that's gone.

But probably unlikely. I've never been like this before. I don't know if I'll ever be able to come back to my normal."

Buddhism to me always seemed related to depression in my mind because I've come to the same seperate conclusions before learning about it in passing.

Life is a meaningless piece of shit that is forced upon us and tells you to get on with existance and work, because if you don't do it, then you will be EVEN more miserable.

How do people not realize that they are just cattle exploited by a handful of people at the top and want to die?"
snorken123,fdr9kse,t3_emqxrt,"Killing yourself is painful and humans like animals have a strong drive to live, reproduce and continue their species because of it's how they're wired. Depressed people's brain works differently than other people's one. People have an irrational fear of death because of they can't imagine how it's being non-existent, but life is something they're familiar with regardless of how shitty it's. Since the world consist of much pain and suffering, people are used to it and thinks that's just biology, tries to overcome it and then have more children to go through the same. It's like a hedonistic thread mill. People seek pleasure although they know their mental state would turn back to normal again."
spacesauce96,fdrx1to,t3_emqxrt,"Buddhism says this is hell and we are sent back here until we learn our sins and stop emotionally attaching ourselves to the material.
I honestly believe them. This is ""hell"", ran by ideas of materialism, by psychopaths, with no regard to life or anything else for that matter. They are there to cause us pain.
This is the fucking purgatory of souls and we are damned to repeat this forever.
This is not even a new idea. The greeks already knew the world goes between 4 ages. Golden, silver, bronze and iron then it repeats. After every cycle there is a big ""harvest"", a big war. We are in the iron age of the slaves, and we are dancing on razors edge between self destruction and revolution.
We are a slave planet, a prison planet, bred to be killed like cattle. They feed off our suffering.
Call me insane, that I believed too much of ""the matrix"". I tell you that the concept in the movie is nothing new. Those are all based on ancient gnostic ideas of the ""learnt elders"". Hollywood is toying with us, admitting things they do, want or did just to feel sinless and yet make people who speak of these look like loonies. Look at Eyes wide shut. Why the fuck would a man make that movie other than to confess what goes on inside these sicko movie factories?
Fuck this planet, this satanic, exploiting, godless system of living, paycheck to paycheck. Fuck all the people who throw away $millions daily and look away when the poor reach their hands. 
Fuck the governments that turn a blind eye on all our problems, that MADE our problems in the first place. They do not even represent us. If they did they would have solved nationwide problems in months. It takes only a law to ban polluting manufacturers, it takes 1 law to ban plastic bottles to manufacture glass bottles, it takes 1 law to give higher pensions etc... They pretend it's complicated. NO IT IS NOT.
They pretend to care. They care only about how many people have died inland from various causes, how thin they can make the middleclass, so nobody can escape the low wage grinder to gain power, and how long they can prolong wars on others, how many wedges they can put between people. 
All who rebel will die a martyr and those who try from inside get JFK-d, either forgotten by history or twisted out by the media and history as evil. Ignorance is a bliss in this world. The more empty headed you are, the more everything outside your tiny existence flies above you, the more ""fullfilled"" you can get with cheap joys and the more lies you can believe. The more you see, the more you try, the more shunned you are by society.
""Who are these ""dr.evil"" people at the top?"" you may ask. Honestly I don't know. Theories are floating around and you've probably heard some. The most ironic would be if they are just psychopaths having joy playing god. Unlikely. The most sad and widespread idea is that this is a death sect that has a new covenant/testament with their ""god"" (sounds familiar?) every cycle, getting promised everything and this has been going on for a long... long... time. 
Our planet is suffering and most of Earth's population is suffering. You are normal and it's ""ok"" to be depressed. Society labels it an illness but it is a state of clearheadedness, a state of disillusionment. Those who are happy in here are the most not-normal, ignorant. You are fine. Embrace the suck. Exploit this shit worthless system, hell if I care and try finding easy money and act like all the stupid people around you. Or live on the edge. Be what other are not and stick out like a sore thumb. Be what you would like to see yourself and take a fat dump on those who say you are foolish. Ride the tiger. Read ""John Lash Lamb: Not in His Image"" (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) and ""Julius Evola: Ride the Tiger"" and it will redefine your values in life. You feel like trash because schools don't teach values and goals.

 Sorry for the wall of text and the rant. It seems demotivating but truth sets you free. I hope you will benefit from my words. I have hit a low in my life so I came here to find sympathy. I am depressed because even though I am full of goals yet fail to start the journey because of fear. I know it sounds contradictory, but believe me I am in pain. My soul feels trapped. I am afraid, full of shame because of myself, because I disrespect my parents, because I lie to them and because I am afraid I will fail and afraid to confess that I want to change course in life, confess that my schooling was a waste of money and I want out.

If you believes in a nice God, that everyone would go to heaven, hell don't exist and that this world is a mistake that can get fixed it's a cozy thing. But if you believes in an evil creator, in rebirth or eternal hell religion is like a plague worse than nihilism.

I don't believe in gods, any afterlives, meaning with life, in humanity, all evil would end before our extinction etc. But it's far from the worst thing. Rebirth and hell sounds so much worse. I believe in eternal non-existence and peace after death."

The reason why I always find it so disturbing is that, when we went to visit my cousins' house (after he was found dead), I could hear his mother (obviously my aunt) wailing with grief, and I would rather live in this world, with all of the recurring demons, than inflict that severity of emotional (and even possibly physical) pain on those that I hold dear.

wisqrg50,fdtl2ua,t3_emqxrt,"cause most ppl are self unaware. they don't think about life or their actions. 

i met so many ppl over the years and it's crystal clear how much they lack self awareness. let me give u a few example

i know a gambling addict who works at a factory 8-10hrs a day and on the weekends he would blow all his money at casinos. Think about his life for a second, he works and he gives his money to casinos. That's his life, he's been an addict for over 10yrs but he refuse to change. he's a fucking idiot, he has kids too.

other example, i met ppl who are addicted to drugs. this lady, he earns about 80k a year. a great job, young, beautiful but she's addicted to meth. she literally spends all her money on drugs. WORK, drugs, work drugs.

majority of ppl don't understand their behavior or ever think about what they do. they just spend it. 

the problem for me, im too self-aware. ppl don't like to admit their faults but i know every flaws I have. so i feel depressed thinking about my flaws, there's no way to improve on it. I tried"
catsarethis,fdtq9rn,t3_emqxrt,"People who “don’t want to die” don’t really think about it, or are afraid thinking about it. 

People who are fooled by this matrix are asleep and like staying asleep.

Make no mistake. Everyone has an unconscious death wish. Every. One. Ask yourself, why does *everyone* believe they’re going to die by a certain age and not refute it? They’re simply holding off thinking about their death, that’s all. 

Depressed people want something to live for. They realize life can be pretty bleak. If it weren’t for my son I’m pretty sure...I wouldn’t be doing as well. It doesn’t get rid of my desire to die. But it makes me choose something different.

That’s what matters. Choose something different. Good luck my friend."
Will2Pow3r,fdtt4dj,t3_emqxrt,"This is something I’ve considered a lot over the years and here’s a (hopefully) semi-coherent summary of what I’ve found.  Take it as you will and be warned I wrote this stream of conscious style...

The issue starts with an existential crisis; most people are desperate to find meaning in an existence built on entropy.  In a chaotic reality, searching for meaning is inherently meaningless and inevitably leads to cognitive dissonance, particularly if one requires it for validation.

Some people are blessed with the gift of being able to wholly convince themselves that there is meaning in life, that they have it and therefore naturally desire to continue it.  Those who see past it, by one method or another, but still believe they need to find meaning grow ever more frustrated at the prospect of continuing to live and then find it hard to not think about death as it would free them from this state, which can, by its very nature, dominate ones thoughts and continue indefinitely.

This usually occurs later in life, as these aren’t the type of things you typically consider when you’re a child.  In fact, it stands in stark opposition to what we are raised to believe.  As children we are told, (in one form or another) that life is about finding a purpose, that there is a divine plan of sorts, that there is someone for everyone, that you will find something you were meant to do, etc...

As you get older, depending on how many coin flips go your way, you will be increasingly confronted by evidence that the entire premise of your life has been built on a false narrative.  Nothing ever goes the way it should have gone, things fall apart for no reason, you have a cyclone of bad luck hanging over your head, etc...

At that point, you reach a crossroads born of cognitive dissonance, where one can either be destroyed, ignore what lies before you, or say fuck it and just go with it.  For the first group, life becomes unappealing, for the second it goes on as before, and for the third it moves forward but in a totally different way.  I’m not sure I can fully articulate it, but for this final group it goes something like this -

Everything is random.  Control is an illusion.  Go along for the ride, see what you see, do as you do, but with eyes open to the idea that everything that has happened, is happening, or will happens is determined by an unknowable flip of a coin resulting from billions of coin flips that proceeded it.  You don’t want to live because you have a purpose or meaning, you want to live to revel in the chaos around you.

For this class of individuals,  playing along with the system is still necessary to a degree, but their underlying awareness of the big picture prevents it from defining them.  Some color inside the lines, others color outside the lines, but they all go forth knowing that the only thing they know for sure is that they know nothing with regards to what tomorrow will bring.  

Discovering the world is a sandbox in the center of a maelstrom or chaotic chance happens to most at some point and how they react to the realization determines how they feel about living within it."

My mother does that too, she has bipolar but is in the depressed spectrum (i'm only here because I'm trying to find any info that might help me help her).

And she starts getting anxiety when she is about to finish watching everything because she knows she is going to start watching the same ones all over again.

But me and my sister are grown up now, so its different on that front.

TheUnidentifiedBoy,febwnk6,t3_enx6ff,"**SHORT STORY:**

I'm 23 and I accepted my depression 2-3 weeks ago. Accepted I will never be happy and just watch TV on a loop to avoid the pain. I'm only alive for 2 reasons. Hope that one day it randomly gets better and to avoid my family going through the pain I go through, because nobody should go through this pain. My young daily life routine is;

Wake up and Cry > Eat > Attempt Workout to stay healthy in my depressed state (cry throughout sometimes) > Shower > Grab food and drink > Bed and TV until I fall asleep > Cry > Wake Up and repeat.

**LONG STORY:**

I'm 23 and super depressed and watch some of the same shows over and over on a loop start to finish with the lights off, door shut, heating on, staying in bed and l do it to trap my mind inside the show's world as if I was there myself; wishing I had that fantasy life the TV Characters have.

It removes my emotional pain whilst I'm watching it by about 90%. There are some spikes in the middle that trigger when I'm a little bored of the repeated boring scene where I wish I wasn't there but usually doesn't happen much as the shows are long and getting back to the repeated episode can take days or weeks so I usually don't get bored. But before sleep I cry and then when I wake up I cry even worse.

It's a horrible life for me. But 2-3 weeks ago I accepted my depression and I haven't smiled since. I try to stay in a healthy routine by not eating super bad and by attempting a 1 hour workout daily 6 days per week (in which I cry whilst working out...)

Anyway, distracting myself with TV makes me feel better for the duration of it but afterwards the depression is 2-3x worse than before I started watching the TV."
sadness_throwaway_,fe6lbma,t3_enx6ff,"It sounds like you love your daughter a lot, that's honestly the most important thing. I binge shows too to distract myself and also because I just don't have the motivation to do anything more than that sometimes, you're not alone. If you have people you trust in your support system irl, please talk to them - a partner, family, friends, anyone you feel comfortable sharing your feelings with. It's hard at first and feels like it'll make everything worse but it does help if you talk to the right people and get some support. Seeing a doctor or therapist might be good too, if you're ready to do that. If you can't or don't want to talk to anyone yet irl, you have the community here too if you need anything. 

Your daughter needs you and loves you the way you are, don't tell yourself stuff like she deserves better. If my mom ever said that about herself I'd be so sad, I teared up just reading your post. Every parent has flaws but if you care about your kid and do your best that's all you can really do and that's all we can ask for as kids."
Coldlostsoul,fe8rziq,t3_enx6ff,"My mom is depressed and when I was living with her the house hold was just depressing and made my depression much worse. So pretty much your depression will spread onto her unless she finds a way to vent. My way of venting was just playing video games all day and night eating unhealthy and day dreaming, but ultimately it made me even more fucked up and on top of that she would always scream at me calling me worth less, lazy, stupid and much more. You gotta show your daughter lots of love and not neglect her. If I had a mother who would of showed me love and care rather than just neglect and buy me materialistic shit I probably would be a different. But nope I’m 18 and have nothing to show for"

mariaj97,fdtsysb,t1_fdtr190,I don’t think she can do that... What you discuss in office is confidential. Try to get a copy of their privacy notice or formal agreement. It’s really important that you tell her this so she can properly assess your situation. You really don’t want to be misdiagnosed. It’ll bring on much more bad than good (to be clear there’s no good at all).
sassycrier,fdtt7mi,t1_fdtr190,"I totally get that!! I’ve had therapists who were a complete waste of time for me because I never felt comfortable talking about the scary stuff with.

browneyedretard,fdvj80t,t1_fdtr190,"Keep fighting!. I've been having strong suicidal thoughts for the past year, and I understand it. Once you have that rooted in your head with plan in place everything seems so clear. It feels blissful right? But ask yourself, do you want to give up that easily? 

Honestly, I do not know what you're going through but my advise is to keep your therapy going. I did not believe in therapy at all but luckily at my worst point I spoke to a friend of mine and asked for help from him, crying all the time through that call. He is a doctor and took me to a psychiatrist.

I was diagnosed with Dysthymia (Chronic depression). I opened up to the psychiatrist and it made me remember of my attempts at life when I was just a kid as well. I had even forgotten about them by that point, but it made me realize what I'm dealing with is not me being a coward but a medical condition, and I wanted to treat is as such.

It wasn't very fun, even while being on anti depressants I continued to fantasize suicide and they've only gotten worse. But it is a slow process and you have to hang in there.. believe in yourself. You'd get there.

I'm almost one year up in my treatments now and honestly been feeling a lot better and a lot alive in the past couple of months. I know I can get through this. I hope you could too.. Life is worth living and enjoyed, after all!"
SureNarwhal,fdw0bd6,t1_fdtsysb,"I would read those agreements carefully.  They always have exceptions that include self-harm.  If a counselor or therapist decides that what you say means that you constitute an imminent risk to yourself or others, they can and will report you.  And that can result in psychiatric holds.

I'm not trying to discourage people from seeking help, but they should be aware of what they are signing and the potential consequences.  It may be different in other countries, but in my country people who have actually experienced this often say that those psychiatric holds are more damaging than helpful.  Being held in a hospital for a couple days doesn't provide meaningful treatment and can often traumatize a person.

I know someone who went voluntarily because they were feeling suicidal and thought that it was what they should do.  It's what people encourage you to do - go to the hospital if you feel like that.  He said that they didn't help him and the people there, likely involuntarily, were just drugged.  One of them was just lying on the floor and any time they started to move a nurse would come over and inject them with something.  It honestly sounded like something out of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  Like an asylum.

For me...I am terribly afraid of those places.  I'm terrified of having things done to me against my will and I'm phobic of needles, so it's even worse.  The idea of someone stabbing me with a needle as they do to non-consenting patients...  I would come out of there much worse than I went in, undoubtedly.  If I ever came out."

I was going through a really dark time, felt alone, lost, heartbroken, and such a piece of trash, had just one friend I could tell everything to because I felt all my other friends (not too many tho) thought I was a burden. Through the help of this friend, getting meds and going spiritual (not Christian but somewhat pagan) I started to feel better. I would recommend you to investigate the spiritual, even if you are skeptic with a bit of belief, it might help you to feel more secure about your life and actions. For example, I’m super insecure about the future, but practicing divination gave me a lot of peace of mind, things to work on, understanding of other people’s actions. Even if you don’t believe, it might get you entertained, but if it’s not your cup of tea choose something to grip on to keep living.

The worst is when they say ""Well I've had mental health issues all my life and I've learned to live with it"" I'm glad you have but that doesn't mean it's the same for all of us, some people never get used to their issues, otherwise we wouldn't have such high suicide rates."
AnotherTrowaway12,fdmtor2,t1_fdmt59t,"Thanks x. Yeah I agree, they clearly don’t understand it sucks, I should treat myself with some self respect and not listen to those types of people, like I didn’t have enough problems with my voices as it is."
Fly4AWhiteGuy_,fdl8xzd,t3_elwlee,"Men can have a really hard time when going through mental illnesses. It is often expected that you show no weakness or emotions. It's shit and I'm so sorry you have to go through this. I read somewhere that 2/3 of suicides are committed by men, yet people still fail to realise that everyone can suffer mental illnesses. Often I have panic attacks or depressive episodes (I'm a female) and most people are supportive or at least don't tell me to suck it up, this same people are the first ones to tease my male friends for the same shit. How is this fair? Mental ILLNESSES, are called like that for a reason. No one chooses to have one. And even if you don't actually have one, even if you are just sad because something bad happened, you should be able to grieve it without being told to man up."
AnotherTrowaway12,fdl9bto,t1_fdl8xzd,"The worst part was that I was told this by a female friend and that she said ""I suffer too but I learned to feel with it"" it just made me feel guilty for being weak or not strong enough and made it even worse"
Fly4AWhiteGuy_,fdlajoc,t1_fdl9bto,"You should never feel guilty for something like this. Everyone deals with emotions differently. Something that might make me have a panic attack, might not make someone else even flinch. We can't compare our pain to everyone else, simply because we are not them. Our bodies are different, we have different lives, and we have different pasts. Females go through a lot of shit but most of the time we have someone to talk to without being judged or feeling guilty about it. Also we can't really control how much we suffer, there is therapy and many other things you can try, but it doesn't work the same way for everyone. She probably doesn't have a good understanding of mental illnesses, which is why you should try to ignore her as much as you would a flat earther giving you a lesson about geography. Make sure you are getting the help you need, and don't let others put you off."
adigloop,fdmnp2p,t1_fdl9bto,"Yikes that would not sit well with me either. I've found it harder talking to women about depression than a fellow man because we're kind of inept when it comes to this and I always often misunderstood, but it's not a rule.

Depressed men often fluctuate between feeling guilty and feeling powerful, and it's to do with how we're raised. I think it helps us perform and compete. It's like low self esteem or something.

Suicide, something called Alexithymia, and addiction are all problems for depressed men."
Cr1318zz,fdmyp24,t1_fdlajoc,I'm scared to open up to anyone or even ask my family for proffessional help and this is the reason why. I'm already critical and judge myself. People just don't understand I didn't ask to be anxious and deppressed.
AnotherTrowaway12,fdmnu98,t1_fdmnp2p,"Thanks for your reply : )

Yeah I agree. For us men it’s still stigmatized to show emotions and that sucks, I thought we had come much further than that. I’ve got nothing personal against my friend but she doesn’t know how it feels to be told by your own father to ""man up"""
DrDougExeter,fdmtda8,t1_fdmnp2p,"Those aren't the problems I deal with.  Well addiction sometimes to alcohol and weed, but most of my depression comes with a lot of sadness, bitterness and anger these days.  And I feel it very strongly.  I don't feel guilty or powerful almost ever.  A lot of anger lately though."

So you feel guilty for even sharing an ounce of your feelings to them because they use it against you. I'm left to bottle it up, self-medicate (hit myself, stop eating, don't drink water, induce concussions) in order to keep myself dull. We go to therapy, and the  psychologists all tell us the same thing above. It's like the entire world is against us and wished that we don't exist or at least crawl back into the cave where we came from and come back out thinking everything is peaches and cream again."

ronerychiver,fecqitk,t3_eo9v2a,"What I recommend is not to look at your therapist as your friend (which they aren’t there to be) but as an objective observer. The thing you don’t like about them may be that they don’t have any vested stake in you because you pay them but what they provide is an asset. They have nothing to Lise by telling you the truth in what they see. Sometimes the truth they see is hard to accept and it can challenge your view of yourself but your therapist should be providing you with insight that makes you happier with yourself and makes you see yourself in a better light. If they aren’t doing that, fire them and find someone else. If all they do is take notes and ask you “how does that make you feel?”, they might not be worth your time. But when you find the right one that you trust with your feelings and who is giving you the tools to find happiness within yourself and to find it around you, stick with them and use them. They can’t be the person who gets drinks with you after a long day, but the right one can help you find the tools to build a network on your own. You’re not alone in your fight, friend. The hardest part of being sad is that you feel like you’re the only one that is. You’re not. We’re here with you."

**My hell time:**

I have suffered from sexual, physical and verbal abuse along with bullying. I have ADD, borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety and severe dissociation (due to BPD). These issues completely ruined my academics (something that has always been my priority) and my relationships. My self harm got increasingly worse and I tried killing myself multiple times (luckily I backed out right at the last moment). I even secretly tried killing myself in my own fucking school (and was caught and that event traumatises me). I have been betrayed by the two I got attached to and actually let in. I found out that my ex emotionally cheated on me. In retrospect I think he genuinely has NPD. He emotionally abused me and made my mental health a thousand times worse. In a moment of weakness (my fault), I cheated on him. I confessed and he manipulated me and used me for fucking and emotional support after that because he wanted to 'make things work' and then insult the life out of me when he wasn't horny or sad. I can't explain the horrible ways he hurt me and lied to me (even before the cheating). I would cut myself while on call with him because he would be so inconsiderate about my emotions and just so so so condescending (in the subtlest ways possible). He gaslit me 24/7. My boyfriend before that treated me like absolute shit too and pressured me sexually and just so many things I'm too tired to list. And my past and even present consists of sexual assault etc. I have suicide notes stacked up in case I want to die. My best friend (who I sacrificed more things than you can imagine for) left me the minute she got a boyfriend because I was a burden. And just all my past trauma and mental illnesses couldn't handle all this. On top of that as an (ex) overachiever, unable to cope academically (as things got harder and I got sadder, I couldn't work at all - I couldn't work before also but i was less depressed etc. - I learnt I have ADD now) which made me even worse. My dreams got crushed and everyone left me and i was anyway in an awful state and I don't even have the guts to mention my most traumatic experiences here. i was genuinely banking on psychiatric euthanasia in Netherlands in a few years and my thighs have the deepest scars. I did so many impulsive things to try and fill my void and made my life a hundred times worse. I have had BPD and ADD and mild depression my entire life, but since 2018 it really really intensified. With college apps coming up and being an IB student so like extra pressure, I really didn't think I would make it alive. I saw 8 psychiatrists/therapists in just this past year and no matter how much I tried, nothing worked and I was convinced I was doomed. I had to leave a course I attended mid way because my mental health couldn't handle it. My dissociation got so bad it inhibited my functioning to a whole new level. I couldn't process sentences I was reading, even during my most critical exams. All the friends I made slowly left me for multiple reasons (sometimes I screwed it up because I am so bad at relationships). Aware of my addictive tendencies, I never touched alcohol in my life. This year, I was so sad that I drank and developed major alcohol dependency. Even now, when I'm low I try drinking in secret. I have tried to overdose (nothing really happened fortunately). I have severe dependency to some of my medication and it's not healthy at all. I was close to my seniors (the only place where i felt like I belonged), but they all went to universities abroad (IVIES). Assuming I'm still the 'smart girl', it is so painful to explain to them that i am going to some meh college most probably. I have let so many people down and my family is suffering so so so much because of me. People consider me to be this 'pretty, smart and great personality' but who is delusion-ed due to her mental illness. I feel undermined because of this because they think I have everything and no right to complain. While I understand that, why is everything so shitty for me? Why am I alone and barely passing? I even lost sense of my 'fun quirky whatever' personality, I couldn't talk about anything but depression and loneliness. Things were absolute hell for me. But no matter what, and despite trying to take my life multiple times, I never completely gave up, like I did about everything, but I continued my search for doctors, despite it being absolutely hopeless. i was scammed twice in fact. My family undermined and treated my illness as a joke for the longest time, same for my teachers. But again, I never completely gave up. And trust me, it really paid off.

**The effort and progress:**

After finally finding a psychiatrist and therapist that felt right, I continuously went to them. it was so sos os o hard, in fact i avoided going to them as much as I could. I didn't want help, I was used to being miserable. But over time, it got easier to go to them. It took a while for them to pick up on my BPD, I myself didn't know I had it, but it explained a lot. After months, they finally found the right medication for me (not completely, but mood stabilizers really changed my life). Then they found stuff to suit my dissociation etc. My therapist helped me too, it was subconscious, but it worked. After years of effort, I finally began feeling better. In fact, I am perhaps the loneliest right now and have more work load than I ever did before. I am seeing people get into all my dream universities. I am seeing everyone that betrayed me doing much better than me in life. I never thought that I could feel better with these circumstances, especially since I couldn't handle myself during easier times. It is a shock, I didn't even think I would make it alive. I feel independent and strong. Nothing worked out for me, nothing. But I am doing what I can with what I have you know? I finally have the energy to put in the effort. I don't cut myself (as much) anymore and am less dependent on substances. Genuinely, everything is hell right now, but fuck I feel good (most of the times). Yes, I still have crying spells and breakdowns, especially at night when I'm alone, but I cope with it much better now. I don't let my mental health dictate how much work I do, in fact my work improves my mental health. Of course, I have fall backs, but everything is much better. When my razors were confiscated, I banged on my mirror to break it and cut myself. I don't do that anymore. I am able to fall in love with learning again, bit by bit. I never ever ever thought i would reach this point. Ever. I felt so jealous and irritated by success stories because they felt like bullshit and I never thought I could ever ever ever write one. But now, I feel the urge to, because now I don't have good moments that fade away and I feel like shit in thirty seconds. I actually feel better overall. I understand if this doesn't give you hope, but i promise you, it gets better. Like genuinely, it does. My life is objectively more hell than it was before, but I am still doing better. I really hope that someone feels some hope through this, anyone.

**Preachy:**

I have learnt and grown so much, I had the shittiest preadolescence and well life. People feel confused about how I am still alive with everything I went through. I haven't even shared everything here or to them. So please understand, it can get better. I don't mean to say that I had it worst because that isn't true. But I really felt like I did and felt like there was no way out and tried to get out of this life etc etc And here i am. I just wish I could convince people who are still going through hell that it actually gets better. I understand how you feel, but keep going. I would love to tell you guys some of my coping mechanisms that might actually help.

**Advice:**

\- If you're at rock bottom, give up on everything if you can't handle it, but don't give up on finding psychiatric help or therapy. Literally, ditch studies, friends, jobs, everything, but find whatever way you can to get help. I can't say don't self harm or 'exercise' because that stuff is hard. I can't say reach out to friends or fake it till you make it or try to work no matter what it will help. I understand that stuff is impossible, even fucking waking up each morning is. But just fight for one thing. One thing. Help. And if your gut feels wrong about the help you are receiving give it just a little bit of time because sometimes you can be wrong, but after that certain amount of time bounce and KEEP LOOKING. No matter what, keep looking. If you have money restrictions or anything, use online help or helplines or find some lowkey way to get help. ANYTHING. Just find a way. There always is one. Contact me if needed. Don't waste energy on anything but getting help. Please.

\- Identify your weird tendencies and habits. Everyone has a few random things that distract them or sort of help them. I obsessively make playlists. I feel much better when I am cleaning my room. Watching TV shows that i have seen before really help me. Sometimes, I want to clean my room but don't have the energy to and being alone with my thoughts terrifies me. So I watch television while cleaning it up to kind of stay distracted and when my room is clean i feel somewhat accomplished and my head feels clear. Another thing that works for me is putting on makeup. It takes a lot of energy for me. But when I start it really helps. Looking good makes you feel good yk.

**To get up in the morning:**

\- So hopefully you find some random tendency. Even something you used to like. Even lighting a candle or ordering something from Amazon or listening to one song counts. Anything. Writing poems. So make chits with all these little things. Mini steps. Reading a chapter of a book or making a mug cake for yourself that takes 15 minutes. If looking good helps you but you don't have energy, keep makeup removing products right next to you and cleanse your face when you get up so you don't really wash your face and you get up and put on your makeup.

Now all these tendencies you have, and things that you may not normally do but could maybe enjoy (for me it's making a mug cake), make chits for all of them. Put them in a box or jar and when you can't get up in the morning because life sucks, pick one out and trust me, if it is a small task you will have the energy to do it. Trust me. Use this box during depression episodes also.

Because my self harm addiction was so bad, I knew that I would ditch these chits and instead jump to the razor. I decided to add a chit for self harm in my box so that i know I have the option and am less likely to just harm myself. Trust me, this works. And over time your brain gets conditioned to do one of these stupid distraction thingies when you are upset. It is a slow process but very very very worth it.

**If you can't deal with your thoughts and don't have the energy to work (especially at night):**

\- AUDIOBOOKS. I often can't get myself to read or even watch TV and open my eyes, but silence and even music make me sad. I listen to audiobooks as I try to sleep so I am somewhat distracted but am also relaxing and will be able to sleep. Melatonin pills etc. may also genuinely help.

\- When I am really sad I have this notebook, I doodle my emotions on it. Like I will draw myself at the edge of a cliff and all the things that haunt me would be written on the cliff, pushing me. It is stupid but it helps.

**FIND YOUR SAFE PLACE**

I feel safe at this specific cafe near my house and this corner in my room. I don't know why, but it just helps me.

**Remember oddly specific and very very tiny accomplishments (or big ones) and compliments you have received**

Maybe pen them down or list them somewhere. When you are in a less awful mood, you can remember random SPECIFIC compliments you have received or unexpected accomplishments you have achieved (it could be the stupidest thing). Make them as specific as you can so it is harder to discredit the good things. When you are hating yourself or feel completely demotivated or are stressed, go over these. They genuinely can help.

**Give yourself time, and give up sometimes. It is OK. I understand. But remember to not compromise with HUGE deadlines etc. But otherwise, give up sometimes. Let yourself mourn. But again, not always.**

**I am sorry if this didn't help much. But I am always here for everyone. Love you all. <3 It gets better.**

Also, a really hard thing to accept is that when you self sabotage, it is on you. Yes mental illness sucks and you can't really control it, but you need to accept that it is on you and you need to work on it instead of blaming everything on it."

humaneHolocaust,el9plo,top_level,"Look, Im not ""good"" or ""great"" or whatever bs canned answer you are expecting from me in this fakeass human interaction to make you feel good about yourself that you care about others.

Chances are while you asked me that, I was most likely in the middle of regretting not jumping under my commute train this morning and praying for death. Either stop asking me or stop with the follow up questions when I just nod my head or say ""fine"". I am tired of lying okay? And I dont need your bullshit advice you read on instagram either

Sorry, back from vacation and again its the same old

""how are you?good! You? Good good!"" fake shit 50 times all over the place, feels like Im working with robots"
TheDravenMain,fdh3jbi,t3_el9plo,"I ask people this at work because I’m genuinely curious, and while I myself from time to time lie and say I am well, I’d prefer people to be honest and tell me what’s on their mind and how they feel. Even if it gets dark or depressing"

Superior_Herringbone,fdisu6l,t3_el9plo,"It's frustrating that this intimate question has become equivalent to ""hi"". I've found replying with any greeting, ""hello"" or ""good morning"" works well for me. A greeting is all they're really communicating, even though it's clumsy and can be hurtful on bad days. I don't BS. They don't have to pretend to care. I don't get more depressed that they don't really care. etc. If I'm feeling bad already, replying this way has helped me avoid spiraling down deeper.


If I say hello first and get how are you in reply, a half smile or nod is enough while waiting at the coffee pot. Or, I need to talk with them, so I just get on with it.


If they're actually interested, they'll ask again. That person is potentially worth opening up to and sharing.


Full disclosure: I still catch myself saying, ""How are you,"" as a greeting sometimes though I'm getting better."

pirh_,fdi1x7i,t3_el9plo,"I've done as others suggested and in my personal experience, more often than not it backfires. Why would you tell someone how bad it is? Because you want relief for a minute from the pain. But other people are not generally prepared to handle it, and you'll end up feeling more isolated."
neodmaster,fdi2ytl,t3_el9plo,"Damn, I was literally walking down the street like an hour ago pondering something like that! I was thinking, I get it! I watched someone say to another as they approached each other; “How are you?”, and I totally got it, people say “How are you?” on an almost whim or social nicety but; man, I heard that and to me it was like, yeah, I totally get it! People should say “How are you?” and respond appropriately so that the social interactions keep going and talk therapy and emotional support begins. Its like, inside the crazy whirl of emotion I’m in today this felt like a reassuring, like if things worked out differently for me I too would be saying that nonchalantly like everyone else and not even be thinking about the reasons behind."

CidCrisis,fdicx6y,t3_el9plo,"I like to respond with ""Not too bad"" with that kinda upward inflection so you still sound like you're being positive. When in reality it's like, ""I have been so much worse."" Lol"
Nightshader587,fdii9mp,t3_el9plo,"Oh gawd damn I fucking hate this shit soo much too.... whenever anyone asks me im like, "" Im doing ok...I think"" or ""Today? Or the rest of my life?"" Or how about ""Feeling depressed as always, you?"""
iomegalul,fdiwdka,t3_el9plo,100% relatable. I hate that question with a passion and dread it. At this point I have more or less conceded and answer with typical 1-2 word bullshit because it's easier than being honest and dealing with weird looks and follow up questions. But I still don't ask back and occasionally I'll ignore the question all together if the context of the conversation allows for it without being too obvious.
stratusmonkey,fdkvvnk,t3_el9plo,"I had a job where I was at a small office away from the home office, and every time someone from the home office called, they'd lead with that, and it got really tedious. 
  
And then, one day the home office called, I presumed (correctly) to end my employment and the manager was like, ""How are you?"" and I was stunned they were asking that under the circumstances. They wouldn't accept a non-answer, and when I realized *why* they wanted to know my emotional state, all I could answer was, ""I'm not in immediate danger of hurting myself or others, and that's all I'm comfortable saying."" It was untrue; I did want to hurt myself, but I knew I was sufficiently inhibited against doing so, and didn't want the situation to escalate. 
  
Maybe it's an occupational (lol) hazard, but in a situation where I know people are taking notes if not taping, and whatever I say can (only) be used against me, I *can* keep my mouth shut."

Puckslun,endd1q,top_level,"I feel like I’m unique in the worst way possible. I have difficulty relating with other people no matter how hard I try. It’s like being a foreigner in a country and trying to speak their language, yet the fluency still hasn’t come. On top of that I’m repulsive to look at. At best I’d consider myself maybe a 3/10 so I have to fight hard just to get my foot in the door when interacting with people. From an outsider perspective, I’m just some ugly quiet autistic nobody. I doubt anybody even notices I exist. If I can’t win people over with my looks, and my personality makes me a fish out of water no matter where I go, then what options do I even have?

I want to be loved. I want friends. I want to be accepted. I want to feel like a human."
musiclover1998,fdy93jf,t3_endd1q,"I had autism too. I had tons of therapy so I eventually learned how to socialize properly, but however you feel, I can relate to it. I will always treat you like a human OP. Because you are one."
Puckslun,fdyc2ya,t1_fdy93jf,It’s sad that the answer to so many of our problems seems to be therapy. I simply can’t afford it. I’m glad it worked out for you though and I appreciate the support.
musiclover1998,fdyd24y,t1_fdyc2ya,"Even if you could, therapy is significantly less effective after early childhood. I was in early intervention when I was 3 and the fact that I got it so early is a big reason I’m able to live a normal life today. I’m rooting for you though. I want you to do well."
Background-Temporary,fdyiuti,t3_endd1q,"""High-function"" autistic guy here, checking in. I'm... average looking at best. I'm sure there's a couple people who are into what I'm offering physically, but that's not exactly an optimistic feeling.

I feel you on the desire to be wanted. I think everyone has that, but for neurotypicals, its easier to fulfill. Most people can get a baseline of social fulfillment just from interacting with employees at the grocery store, a phone call home, and a tinder-date. I can't manage those three things at all.

Any chance there are language-immersion groups where you are? Maybe people looking to learn your native language, so you spend some time talking in your language and then the other one? 

As for how to win people over... I feel you on that too. Naturally good-looking people have it easiest, for sure. Naturally outgoing and charismatic people also have a leg up. Going into it for me seems like I am blindfolded and have my arms tied behind my back, its just a combined pile of disadvantages. The only advice I have, which is easier said than done, is to focus on yourself. What do you like? What are your interests, what gets you curious, what gets you a little more excited? You can really focus on those and develop some hobbies. 

Once you have a few hobbies, it gets a little easier. Conversation is easier when someone asks you what you've been up to. It's easier when you can say you've finally finished a painting or are close to running a ten minute mile. You make the conversation a little easier since its now about what you've been doing, so you have some things to add. I find chatting hard because I can't pull topics out of thin air.

There's no perfect solution, but there are things you can do to feel better, and I hope you do feel better soon."

Puckslun,fdybsnv,t1_fdy9hdn,I’m oddly confident when I drink. It’s like a whole different person comes out of me who isn’t constantly over analyzing their every action. People tend to like me on the rare occasions that I get drunk. The only problem is I come from a family of horrible alcoholics and I don’t want to become an addict myself.
wkgko,fe2344m,t1_fdy9hdn,"> Maybe if you could be more confident about yourself

how did you do that?"
Evilevilcow,fdyhlwr,t1_fdybsnv,That feeling you get with alcohol. You don't need alcohol. You don't. Alcohol lowers inhibition. It does not give you skills. It makes you care less. Don't care as much what people think of you. Stretch your comfort zone and go forth and interact. You can do this.
ElChuchoBarracho,fe33xeb,t1_fe2344m,"I was never one to care about others' opinions of me. Try that. I've heard that a great deal of people find it hard to do, but I'd say it's worth it."

Crepe_Butt,fe0s0er,t3_endd1q,"I'm in the same boat. Mildly autistic, just turned 34 don't have a single friend. I don't know how old you are but I can tell you from my experience, it does get better.

I lost my mum last Monday she had just turned 53.
It was my little boys birthday and my mum was to ill to come by the time my dad got home he found her dead in the bathroom and had to do CPR . He called me screaming that my mum had collapsed and then rang back to say she had gone, i've been in a daze ever since.
I LOVED her so much, we were so close weirdly close some would say we knew everything about eachother.

She suffered with being alcohol dependant and had a hidden eating disorder and laxative addiction. ( My dad didn't know this she hid it well). Do I even tell him ? Would there be any point ? 


We're still waiting for her post mortem results which should be another week. 
I'm numb, I can't cry, I'm scared that realisation is going to smack me in the face and I'm going to lose my mind. Or if I am just actually a sick fuck because I'm so numb.


I said months before I feel my mum is going to die. I've been preparing myself for years watching her body deteriorate. My mum still worked full time kept a spotless house was the most amazing grandma and mother. 
I'm a recovering alcoholic and I've drank 3xs this week but will continue group therapy on Thursday.

My mum was my world my rock and I was her little chic. I don't know how my world is going to keep turning but I have to to make her proud. My mum gave me so much laughter we'd call everyday laughing and telling eachother we loved eachother. My little boy was her world and she was his i wonder what hurt he is going through and should he go to the funeral ? 

Why can't I feel anything !!!!!!!!!!! 

I had to write this down thanks for anyone who actually gets to the bottom.

Sophie"
justmadetosay,fdkypyd,t3_elwuh3,"Very sorry for your loss. Best wishes to you and your familyand I hope you can get through this difficult time.

moodistry,fdl5ybs,t3_elwuh3,"Really so very sorry for your loss.  It is devastating and life-transforming to lose a parent, especially one loved as much as you loved your mom.

Grief unfolds in stages, and you're in shock.  You will move through the stages, some of which everybody does, and some of which will be unique to you.

I hope you have a really good cry soon.  Loss can really crack our hearts open, and that is a terrible and powerful thing.  The power of your love for her is the power that will help you heal in the long run.  

Consider grief counseling, particularly in a group setting.  It can really help a lot."
fluffbutt66,fdl77l4,t3_elwuh3,"So sorry for your loss. Don’t beat yourself up about how your handling her death, we all grieve in different ways. Be patient with yourself. It’s the hardest thing to go through is someone dying. The first few weeks are the worst. I was really close with my brother and we talked 3-4 times a day. His last two weeks were the worst the worst days of my life. He was on life support and there was a bit of hope he would make it and then he was dead. It’s been two years and I’m still miss like crazy. Just remember the good times and she is watching over you now."

hobit2112,fdm1k11,t3_elwuh3,Everyone has there own way of grieving.  Your is just the way your body and mind are processing the loss. That first week to month is difficult but as it goes on it becomes easier. You learn to cope and the like. Try and not use alcohol as much as possible and I know it’s difficult for you right now. Once the initial shock is over and you can safely say your life is back to normal maybe pick up a hobby. It will help you take your mind off of your current situation and bring some joy. I’m so sorry for your loss. Losing a parent is one of the hardest things.
bopflop,fdm4sz8,t3_elwuh3,"I'm so sorry for your loss, Sophie. I know the pain of losing a parent. I lost my dad a few years ago in terrible circumstances that are still hard to grasp but I'll tell you it gets better. Your body and mind are in shock of course your body is going into coping mode so that's why you feel numb. I felt the same. I remember not being able to cry for about 4 days. Only after a month or two could I truly grieve. Be gentle with yourself, don't drink alcohol, try to eat small meals throughout the day, drink water. 

You'll be ok and you'll make your mom proud. It's a profound loss but it's one you can overcome to see better days. It's good to also stay busy so you aren't just left with your grieve. Best wishes."

I was in a relationship with someone who suffers from compulsive behavior and has a lot of feelings of low self worth, and an eating disorder (which is a means of feeling in control for those who didn't know). She works really, really hard to control the image that others have of her to the point that her life became dominated by constructing that image. Of course social media is a huge part of that and she can't stay away from it.

We got close enough that she was trying to straddle being real with me and maintaining a different image for others. Our relationship lost out of course. As manipulative and dishonest as she was, it still makes me sad that someone would choose to prioritize a veneer of a life on some app that hundreds of people can follow, vs a real life with a few people that actually care about them."

Social media is toxic and I honestly think more people should avoid it."

sadness_throwaway_,fdmad9n,t3_em1ggo,"There's a quote I saw a while ago that stuck with me, and it can be applied to social media: ""Don't compare your behind-the-scenes to someone else's highlight reel."" Whatever people put on social media is usually heavily edited and is carefully picked to make it seem like they're living their best lives, but that doesn't show their day-to-day lives or the struggles they're going through. Most people post on social media to make it seem like they're happy and having a good life, it's never as good as it looks like it is from someone's Instagram. It's healthy that you're unplugging from social media, I admire you for making that choice. If it's bringing you negative thoughts, I hope it helps to remove it from your life."

But even if I wanted to stay out of SocMed, I somehow need to stay in it. Like promoting my art. Keeping myself updated with the news. Looking for freelance job. Joining organizations or events. It sucks that everyone and every businesses are independent to it (mostly Facebook).

co-wurker,fdmeitc,t3_em1ggo,"I've been off all social media for 3 years now. For awhile I questioned it, but I'm way past the point of ever wanting to go back now.

The shitty thing is, the big businesses behind all the social platforms have worked really hard to normalize being ""connected"" all the time and it's changed people's behavior and thinking. I've noticed more people than I would have expected react negatively to me not being part of it... but the same can be said any time someone goes against the grain of societal norms.

I feel so much less stress and comparitive thinking being off all that. Was a good move for me."

haymansafc,fdnax0e,t3_em1ggo,"Social Media, in my opinion, is probably one of the worst things to come out of the 21st Century to date. Forums are fine, but beyond that I do question them now. 

If I had my way, the likes of Facebook e.t.c would be subscription-based. The more you post, the more you pay per month. Money raised would go towards charities such as Samaritans e.t.c to help those who don't have the same connections or friends as others. 

I appreciate that may sound a little draconian to some, but I see no other way to 'claw back' some use out of the social nightmare that Social Media is for many people."

Thanks for reminding me that I need to permanently delete that account. 

My only current social media outlets are Reddit and Steam (if you could call it one). I don't use any of that other crap. Probably other best decision was to get a vanilla Android phone that doesn't come with all of those little attention whore apps preinstalled and non removable unless you root."

Facebook is toxic as all hell, seeing people shit post everything from your favorite hobbies to politics. Like, who the fuck cares ?

McTomatOle,fdq0ulp,t3_em1ggo,"I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have been depressed if it wasn't for social media.

It changed society in an awful way. Before it we lived for ourselves and didn't really give a crap about what others do or think. Nowadays we live for others, seeking validation and fall off a mental cliff when we don't get it.

Fuck this shit, FB is a cesspool, Twitter is a cesspool, never been on IG but I'm pretty sure it's a cesspool. I'm only on few Reddit subs that don't involve heavier themes like politics or societal issues.

I still can't come with terms to how toxic and evil people are in reality. They smile and act all cordial and shit in real life. Only to go hide behind their screens throwing shit at others without even knowing anything about them. Yeah fuck people, I was never really fond of them, but ever since people started letting all their filth out on the internet, I honestly became a dedicated misanthrope."

He isnt affectionate unless we fuck and I'm getting tired of not even getting it much. I feel like a shell that's just here to keep my kids alive and that's it.

I'm now approaching my mid-thirties and I don't even know what ringtone is on my mobile phone. Text messages are few and far between - and those are only ever from the parents. 

I've dealt with social anxiety for many years. I've never been the life and soul of the party anyway - it's just not 'me'. However, all my previous efforts to connect with people have resulted people joking about me, criticising me or simply throwing it back in my face. In turn - it's just made me even worse and now I'm actually quite content being 'alone'. 

I didn't really want it to be this way - no connections or friends. However, I'm satisfied I've done what I can to change this and the same old pieces of advice simply haven't worked for me."
philpill11,fds8l2v,t1_fdqkram,"The same happened to me. I think it was 2012 when I last went out with a friend. Then my remaining friends got partners and that was it, they cut me off.

I haven't had a text from a friend for 7 or 8 years now. The only texts I get are from my network provider, recruitment agencies or my family. Come to think of it, I don't know what my ringtone sounds like either.

The other day my parents asked me what I will do when they are not around and I didn't have an answer.

I can't say I'm content with being alone. I'm sat in my room again on a Friday night watching the hangover on ITV for the 100th time. I'm bored and I can't carry on living my life like this. This lifestyle isn't sustainable for anyone.

Surely everybody knows what this is like. But they don’t. So we are mutants. But we’re in abundance. This is natural selection trying to eliminate bad genes from the gene pool. And the only way we stay alive is stronger survival mechanism. But really, we are defying nature with pharmaceuticals. I really should be dead. Nature is telling me to off myself. I’m sure."

manaferry,fe38u9c,t3_enmeu5,"I've been in that place so many times and it's the worst, it seems that nobody will ever understand when they're in a different place and their advice will always be somehow off. I'll just share what I do when I feel like I want to end my life. I hope this will help you as it helped me so far. 

I think of death as an eternal sleep, that would give me peace because I won't feel anything. So when I feel that this is my last day on earth I just want to grant myself that last meal, that last conversation, that last cigarette I'll ever have, etc. Everything has to be on my terms. I'll get myself a full cup of water, I'd go out and have my last meal, I'd call the only one person I feel I want to say goodbye to, and ask them if they want to meet up. I'll then go home and have my last cigarette and I'd just go to sleep. That sleep won't be eternal but will bury a lot of what I was the day before.  I like to think that my old self is actually dead and this is a new version of me that can live a different life. 

Usually the next day I feel a little better, it won't be a great day, but just another day. Sometimes I feel glad I haven't ended it sooner because life can surprise us every day, and while I won't like any of the surprises I'm just curious to know what it's in there in the next chapter. As painful as it can turn out to be I can always start from scratch after a long sleep.

Think of it this way, everybody is going to die someday, me, you, everybody you ever knew, so why rush it, just get some sleep or whatever works for you. These days may be very painful but there's no way to know if your next day will be a great day, a nice day or just a day more.

Volthrr,fe1aowx,t3_enj587,"Absolutely. I know tons of people who do, and these people don't even have depression. I have a blanket I usually snuggle up with every night. I also have a hoodie that's super comfy and sometimes I'll just use that. It's totally normal. You're in the clear, bud."
JBnotJB,fe1ohtn,t3_enj587,Not going to give my age away online but I am an adult and I still sleep with my baby doll that I’ve had since I was little

the-next-whiskey-bar,fe1tg8y,t3_enj587,I'm 21 and I've slept with stuffed animals ever since I was a kid. No one seems to think it's weird. Once we had an after party at my place and all of us fell asleep and this one buff dude hugged my crocodile  plush the whole night
MoGretsch,fe25wrh,t3_enj587,Get a dog. Its like that times 10000.
internetexploreguy12,fe271ec,t3_enj587,Yeah I have a dolphin.
ILoveVenomousSpiders,fe28wbs,t3_enj587,"I can't fall asleep unless I'm hugging something. Usually it's a pillow. 
I think it is normal."
B_T_B_,fe2a4eu,t3_enj587,"I think it's completely normal, what animal do you have?"
Riselythe,fe2dxga,t3_enj587,It's more common than you would think. I have a stuffed animal I sleep with almost every night. Had it since I was born so it's been by my side forever. Helps me sleep easier.
arinhatessubway,fe2k3ep,t3_enj587,totally. i sleep with two- a peach and a penguin i got from Korea. It’s cute in other cultures and not at all strange
Raichu_07,fe2kuff,t3_enj587,I have a stuffed animal on my bed that my grandma gave me when I was 7 (she passed away in my teens). I've always had it on my bed since. I'm in my 30s.
Astre01,fe2lqfk,t3_enj587,"It's normal according to me, I sleep with my stuffed bird every night, on some cases I *even* spoke to it."
moonwish18,fe2o0la,t3_enj587,I sleep with my stuffed Eeyore. He cheers me up when I’m blue.
MagistrateDeTemps,fe2vksb,t3_enj587,"Not at all. I sleep with stuffed animals all the time. Life is too short and sucks already- all the comfort in all the places count.

Plus, a majority of people really don't care, I've come to find. And believe me, people who do criticize it most likely do the same thing.  

Edit to add: If you really like stuffed animals, you could always start a collection? Its what I have been doing and its honestly therapeutic. I buy maybe one every couple of months of an animal I really want and its cozy in bed and pleasing to me. Just a thought."
manaferry,fe2wnds,t3_enj587,It's totally normal (F30). I get the hug I need from mine and things are a little easier knowing my totem is there for me. Mine is a ram. What kind of animal is yours?
rickyianpatrick,fe33vqs,t3_enj587,Yeah most nights I sleep either resting on or hugging my stuffed bear. I have depression and anxiety and he calms that and there's a noticeable difference when he's not there
ragdoll-6,fe3g3ld,t3_enj587,"I sleep with a dog next to me. If it helps, it helps and fuck all else who says differently"
Gameperson700,fe4yfcs,t3_enj587,I sleep with pillow pets at my moms house. They’re Disney ones. I sleep with Stitch because I like him. It’s comforting and let’s me know that everything will be ok.
givemeunbeso,fe5h795,t3_enj587,"I have a teddy bear I could absolutely hug in bed, I just don't because my bed is on the smaller size and I'm not fond of finding it on the floor in the morning. It's very normal imo? I know more people who do sleep with one than not."
EsotericOcelot,fe61050,t3_enj587,"My roommate works in customer support at a fancy tech company and is in his mid twenties and sleeps with two, a dino and a fox. I have a friend who is 27 (I think) and a divorced mom and still sleeps with her bunny. I have to hold something, be it cat, boyfriend, or pillow. It's okay. Even if it's not 'normal', it's what meets our needs so we can do what we need to do. Your needs and comfort are more important than being normal. Anyone who would give you crap for it doesn't deserve to give an opinion because they value normal more than they value you taking care of yourself."
Bradiscool21,fe618mf,t3_enj587,of course i do it all the time
Kasakta7,enuyii,top_level,"here it is, found it a couple of days after.  
decided to post it to remind everyone to always be there for the people you love in your life and that you are never ever alone.  


I give too many fucks but at the same time i don't give any at all.  
I'm tired.  
So so tired.  
Can i even keep this up? for how long? why?  
Everyday is just a day i need to survive.  
How much more?  
I'm tired.  
So tired.  
Tired of everything and nothing.  
Tired of myself and everyone around me, of my thoughts, the voices in my head, my ideas,my tears and my fake smile as i say ""i'm fine"" while my insides squeeze tightly.

  
I'm scared.  
I'm scared of life, of breathing, of the mirror, of people, the outside, the world itself. I'm scared of myself and i hate it. I'm scared of what i am or what i will become. I'm scared of the future, i'm scared of the past and i'm scared of the present.  
I'm scared of time. No, i HATE time.  
I lose it, yet i don't have any reason to.  
I want time, yet i don't.  
No future for me. what future?! why?! i don't want it.  
So i never think about it. So why am i scared of it?  
Because i'm a coward.  
I should have ended it when i had the chance but now all i do is hide.  
Is it too late? I can just try again but why cant i?  
I'm not scared of death, i'm scared of nothingness, emptiness.  
I already feel all of that from being alive so why? Why do i still stop? Why do i care if i wont be here TO care? Is it mom? She lost so much already, i cant do this to her... but she..they never believed me anyway so why?  
WHY DO I GIVE A SHIT?!  
I should just do it!  
But what about my pets? the only ones i feel truly happy with. My mom doesn't like them, who will be there for them?  


Nobody cares.  
Nobody believes me.  
Nobody did.  
I just want somebody to care, i want attention, i want to be taken seriously.  
Maybe one day you will be sorry and wish you tried to understand me before it got too late.  
I don't know.  
I don't know what i can do.  
I don't trust myself.  
I don't trust anyone.  
You cant trust anyone in this world.  
""Remember darling, even the closest person will have a knife ready when you turn your back. for their own selfish reasons.""  
Everyone want something.  
""Nothing is ever free.""

I cant get help.  
Only makes it worse. Reminds me how fucked up and ""not normal"" i became,reminds me how i see the world now.  
Everything is fucked, we all fucked. Everything and everyone always have a dark side, nothing is sunshine and rainbows. It can look like it for a short while, i try to feel like that but it ends way too fast and only reminds me that nothing will help a depressed fuck like me.  
Cant take medicine.  
Will only make me think that i'm sick, that there's something wrong with me. Mom does a good job at reminding me not to take this kind of medicine cuz only ""not normal, crazy people"" take it.  
I'm already numb as it is. Feel like a sleepy zombie, i don't need to feel any more numb then i am.  
Maybe i should?  
Maybe i'll become so numb that i wont be my dumb self.  
So numb that maybe i wont be able to think anymore.  
I wish i could sleep and never wake up.  


I work everyday and i don't even know why.  
It wont change anything even if my family thinks so.  
I just ""keep drinking coffee and getting lost in my imagination.""  
Its not that it has been a hard couple of weeks, it just came out of nowhere. I don't know, i used to be a happy child years ago.  
Am i being dramatic?  
Am i being full of shit?  
Looking for attention?  
After all there's people who actually have a good reason to be depressed.   
I'm just here hating on life and me.  
Why am i such sad trash?  


I keep seeing bad things, imagining something happening to me or me doing something to myself, thinking how to do it.  
Why?  
Is this what i really want or am i going crazy?  
My head hurts.  
But so much more to think about.  


I hate feelings.  
Was never good with them, i don't understand them.  
Yet i change them nonstop.  
I hate when they come out.  
Just shows i'm weak, cant control myself.  
I try to look tough on the outside but fail.  
I'm weak.  
Always so angry and sad without a ""bright side"".  
Of course people will get tired of me.  
Need my smokes and booze to keep me calm and ""happy"".  
when i have panic attacks.  
I'm scared of my own heart beat.  


Can't sleep.  
Sleep too much.  
Can't eat.  
Eat too much.  
Don't have hope.  
Wish i could turn off my mind.  
Doing everything i can to keep busy.  
Hate being bored because being bored means being alone with your thoughts.  
Its bad.  
I'm stuck.  
Lost.  
My mind is a maze.  
I feel like a curse.  
I'm selfish.  
I am not doing well.  
Nobody else needs my shit, people have their own problems. They don't need me as well.  
They aren't really there anyway.  
Who cares.  
I'm a mess.  
I just want to wake up and ACTUALLY BE fine for once.  
Sick of feeling this way.  
I""m better as a memory.  
Don't mean to make you upset.

  
I'm just tired."
ThunderChild247,fe5i656,t3_enuyii,"All very familiar thoughts. 
My advice to anyone feeling like this is to find something to keep them in the world, their anchor. For me, it’s my pet. I can’t leave him, and I refuse to “take him with me,” so I’m staying to look after him even when things are at their worst. And boy have they been bad, but even at those times I want to end everything, I know I’ll be leaving him, and I have to stay.

It might not be a positive reason to stay, but anything which keeps me alive into one more day is a little victory."
Altbaldaccount,fe87668,t1_fe5i656,"I have no anchor, I just involve myself in something which keeps me busy and my mind diverted throughout the day, but even then every time there's a situation where I think there's a possibility of an accident happening and me dying I wish it happens.  
  
I don't share this with anyone but people here because I don't want to add to anyone else's already existing problem. Do I've become a recluse. I don't know what I'll do when I'll be out of things to keep me busy.  
  
Hope you're doing fine and your pet never leaves your side or you his in the mortal world"
ThunderChild247,fe94hm8,t1_fe87668,"One thing I’ve learned is that the people who really care about you won’t mind you adding to their problems by sharing yours. The ones who care will likely be worrying about you anyway, and letting them in is actually a relief for them in some ways. 

Never suffer alone."
Altbaldaccount,feaau58,t1_fe94hm8,"That's true. But I've tried my best to hide this side of mine from people who care about me. Pretty sure they don't even know I have such kind of thoughts.  
  
So there's nothing for them to worry about me so much. They only know about few things which I'm concerned about but that's all trivial matter and doesn't even begin to scratch the surface.  
  
Even if I want to share with them, I won't be able to, atleast not now. Might build up the courage to do so in a few years, but nothing now."
ThunderChild247,febcmcp,t1_feaau58,"That’s precisely what I told myself, but when things did get too much and I told the people who had to know, they did know something was wrong, and they listened to what I needed. 

The best advice I ever got was to treat depression like a  fight with a monster in your head. The monster wants to fight you on your own, the sooner you get reinforcements, the better."
Altbaldaccount,fec38fd,t1_febcmcp,Sound advise. It'll take me time to call for help
sOmwhereElse,fe5ydai,t3_enuyii,"This is crazy how accurate this is to my life and the thoughts I have. Maybe some people will hate me saying this or think it’s morbid, but in a way this is a very beautifully crafted suicide note. Mine will likely be much less...I don’t know, just less than this. He/she described the “behind the scenes” stuff very well, all the thought processes depressed/suicidal people go through."
22Savage671,fe5xyp6,t3_enuyii,"What if you love nobody? Or you're trying to force yourself to love nobody, save for a few select people who have genuinely been there for you in life, or even the few who barely know you but manage to be kind to you everyday? These bonds, all they've done is cause me agony."
Kasakta7,fe6g6dt,t1_fe5xyp6,"Those ""selected few"" are exactly who you should care about and let them be there for you and you be there for them. Even when you hate the world theres always someone out there who you cant hate. Cherish them, some bounds worth everything.
Be strong my friend."
22Savage671,fe6k5jz,t1_fe6g6dt,The problem is that they're usually people of my past or people I can't really see or talk with often. Why should I be fair when the world is everything but fair?
Kasakta7,fe6s0bb,t1_fe6k5jz,"Be the change you wanna see, as they say. Even if those people are in the past it doesnt mean you wont find new even better people."
22Savage671,fe6ujs8,t1_fe6s0bb,Or maybe the solution is to not find anyone at all. Only bond with people when I need something from them or when they're useful to me. Few people I've cared about have done the same to me. Why should I be fair when the world is everything but?
Kasakta7,fe7baqj,t1_fe6ujs8,"You will only make it harder on yourself, we cant be alone forever. Instead of thinking you should be unfair too, think of being better.
Find people who truly deserve you and your trust."
fuckoffimreading,fe6djzq,t3_enuyii,"Dude this is terrifyingly familiar. 
This is exactly how I've felt for the last 10 15 years this could have been my note"
Sadboy____,fe6eq3e,t3_enuyii,I feel the same
Alternate_cloud,fe6ui73,t3_enuyii,"Everything is weird, isn’t it? You’d think that with so many problems there’d be at least half as many solutions.

Nope.

Even after thinking so hard about how to be happy, most, if not all people, whether they realise it or not, fail to achieve the life they truly want.

Though failure isn’t the end. You can always do something more, no matter how meaningless. You only have to give that meaninglessness meaning.

This is a warped world. Being warped isn’t a bad thing, but that doesn’t mean our world isn’t bad. My point is, if the world can be warped, why can’t other things be? Warp meaning. Self care is more than just what people would ‘normally’ think it is.

Limit your responsibilities, reject what others say, And spend your time on something you think you might find at least a tiny bit enjoyable.

Just make sure you’re in a position to be doing this; if there are people who rely on you financially, like kids or a spouse, you don’t want to screw them over by leaving them penniless.

Anyway,

Feel free to die at any time if you want, but in the meantime, experience a fulfilling existence, no matter how small. Cut out the bad, and live your best, no matter how little time this leaves you.

If your finances only last a week, leaving you unable to support yourself? So be it. You got rid of everything bad and hopefully felt a little better after everything was all said and done.

If you’re going to kill yourself anyway, experience a life worth living, even if it’s just a tiny portion of that life.

If even after experiencing that, you still want to die? It’s your choice, and I wish you the best"
Snerfblatt,fe6jb19,t3_enuyii,"Aww, I'm so sorry that you lost your friend. And that they were going through so much. I promise that I will never give up on my friends who have depression."
Kasakta7,fe6s0w8,t1_fe6jb19,Thank you. That makes me happy to hear
Snerfblatt,fe6xyfk,t1_fe6s0w8,Thank you for sharing it with us.
Anniethelab,fe6jmhl,t3_enuyii,"It startles me how much of this thought process I have had myself. I don't think of myself as suicidal -- there's something holding me back. But I have thought these thoughts, imagined my death daily in various gruesome ways. And here is another soul lost in the same tormenting thoughts. 

I know when people say they experience the same thing it's supposed to offer some sort of support, but it almost makes me abandon any scraps of hope or strength that I cling to. How can anyone get better?"
honeybee_hive,fe7s4rs,t3_enuyii,It's almost eerie how relatable this is.
Altbaldaccount,fe87n51,t3_enuyii,"Wow, perfectly expresses how I feel"
beemarti,fe8aufl,t3_enuyii,"I spent years feeling and thinking like this, but then I randomly and unexpectedly met my husband. Out of the blue I met him at time I was my worst. He is my anchor and why I stay. If he goes so do i. 
I'm so sorry for the loss of your friend, I hope she has found peace now."
Senyum169,fe8v3nj,t3_enuyii,"I feel the same.. a never ending question, question after question whether im busy working or working out"
joycee97,eoclci,top_level,"I’ve been struggling with depression for over 7,5 years now and all this time I could never find the root of the problem. I’ve had 4 different therapists in the last 7 years and the last one made all the difference. Where the other 3 ‘gave up’ and sent me back into the big bad world after treatment was over, this woman actually was there for me. She admitted that I needed more specific care than she could provide as a ‘normal’ therapist. I feel like she did everything she could and instead of giving up on me she saw to it that I’d be in the right hands to continue my journey when she couldn’t provide the care I need.

And at my new (specialized) therapist is where the autism comes in. After weeks of interviews, conversations, questionnaires and tests today I got diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder. It turns out that I was not failing as a human being all along, my brain is just wired a bit differently. This is also why my previous therapist were unsuccessful, because the care they could provide was not the care I needed. I’m starting group therapy in a few weeks so I can learn how to cater to my needs. Once I know how to provide a good environment for myself I know I can find the strength to kick depressions ass!"
agumonkey,fec5ck8,t3_eoclci,I wonder if I should take that test. I know I have bits of autistic traits (difficulties with social interactions) but it's never really something clear.
jesterinancientcourt,feceoys,t1_fec5ck8,"You should see a psychologist about that. I was recommended to a psychologist who specialised in autism disorders & instead of just assuming I had autism, she spent time with me to see what was affecting me, whether I might have another disorder. Turns out I definitely am Autistic."
PrecisionStrike,fectk1u,t1_fec5ck8,I have more of those traits than I'd like to admit but I refuse to ever get diagnosed with anything. It's just another label that the normies will use to abuse and disrespect you. So I play undercover agent as best I can and blend in while I do my thing.
joycee97,fed094w,t1_fec5ck8,"You could always see your doctor about it, explain your struggles and suspicions and they will decide wether it’s useful for you to start the diagnostic journey. Sidenote: keep in mind that you if you don’t experience depression or severe anxiety because of it your doctor might say no. This is because there are a very long waiting lists for therapists and people who experience other mental health issues go first. It’s sad that there are not enough therapists out there because in my opinion everyone has the right to see a therapist if they feel the need to"
Osprey731,fecl677,t1_feceoys,I have aspergers
agumonkey,fechui5,t1_feceoys,I'll try. thanks
joycee97,fed02ex,t1_feceoys,"Glad to hear the mental health care in your country is this up to date. Autism often gets misdiagnosed for ADHD, bipolar disorder or borderline disorder so it’s very important they look at all the possibilities. I’m grateful my therapist also looked at all the options. Hopefully the mental health care will get just as good in other countries"
joycee97,feczwya,t1_fectk1u,It’s just sad that labels are seen by society as a bad thing. They can be very helpful in catering others needs if they were just accepted more. You could always get the research done. No one has to know if you turn out to have autism. You can continue the same way as you do now in public and no one would ever know. But it might make your home life and understanding yourself a whole lot easier
ClamDeFacto,fecit1g,t3_eoclci,"My kindergarten teacher saw it and my mom freaked out. We actually moved to avoid any further discussion. ""You're not retarded, she said you're retarded...""

I struggled for decades, never understanding what was so wrong with me, why I never fit. I had a high IQ and that's all my school cared about. 

Mom was neglectful & abusive and I think she mostly didn't want anyone scrutinizing our home life.

I was in therapy for many years but it wasn't until my 40's that a therapist recognized the female Asperger's and I remembered that heartbreaking day in kindergarten. So much suffering could have been avoided. Congrats."
Mieczyslaw_Stilinski,fecnp6b,t1_fecit1g,When my son first started kindergarten the teacher told us he was autistic. We didn't see it. He paced a lot but we thought he was just hyperactive (he was our only boy). We kind of had a hard time accepting it. Now it's really obvious to us.
ClamDeFacto,fecolt0,t1_fecnp6b,"That was in the 70's, so that teacher was really ahead of her time. Not one educator after that ever suggested it. They only berated, shamed and punished me for not understanding how to conform and be 'normal'.
I don't think people will ever understand how brutal adults and kids can be to autistic students. I became progressively more troubled & confused as time went on."
Rakali,fecxpg6,t1_fecolt0,"Yeah I also got picked up early, but moved and the teachers at the new school were told I was a horrible liar. Dad didn't want anyone paying too much attention to what was going on at home. Could've spared me a lifetime of trying to fit in and getting screwed over, only to wind up in my fifties, on disability, in public housing and with complex trauma that will never really go away. I shouldn't be so hard on myself for being so depressed and not having the energy to even shower. As my doctor once said, it's amazing I'm even still alive."
Snaper_XD,fecbote,t3_eoclci,Same. When I was in a hospital they tested me
xxshadow101x,fecfvdl,t3_eoclci,"I admire your enthusiasm towards beating your depression. That's a huge step in my mid to beating depression. Good luck mate, no doubt u can't do it."
joycee97,feczrpu,t1_fecfvdl,"Thank you so much! I have to admit: I was really close to giving up. After 3 failed therapy paths I was very sceptical about the 4th. That lady changed my life by not just doing what she had to do as a therapist, but actually looking past my mental illness and looking at me as a person. I’m so grateful to her. Because of her I got to the therapist who made the diagnosis. In my country those are specialized therapists you can’t just randomly apply to. You need a redirection from a regular therapist to even start there"
PotatoChips2001x,febnkj2,t3_eoclci,What disorder?
jesterinancientcourt,feceh84,t1_febnkj2,Autism spectrum disorder
jesterinancientcourt,fecku9z,t1_fecj76j,Autism spectrum disorder means you have some form of Autism. Kind of like how Anti social behaviour disorder works
Pnuttn,fecswh4,t1_fecj76j,It used to be like that but now they just call it autism spectrum disorder because it's like a spectrum. You can be a little autistic or more or something in between.
frank105311499,fecl3df,t3_eoclci,What's the difference between introvert and autistic ?     can't tell what's different
Osprey731,feclb9a,t1_fecl3df,Being non verbal. Not understanding non verbal facial cues. Or facial expressions. Sensitivity to foods or sounds or textures of clothing. Severe repetition.
mavericksage11,fecnbo5,t3_eoclci,"Out of curiosity, I read somewhere that they diagnose autism when we're kids? Can they miss it in out childhood, and get the correct diagnosis later in our adulthood?"
Pnuttn,fecsqyu,t1_fecnbo5,A lot of people gets diagnosed as adults. It can easily be missed if you have mild autism.
joycee97,feczbcl,t1_fecnbo5,In some people the signs are more clear than in others. Especially females often get diagnosed much later in live. This has to do with the fact that girls at a young age are much better at mirroring their peers behavior than most boys. This makes them fly under the radar much more often than boys. There are a lot of TED talks on YouTube where women explain how this was for them if you want to learn more about it
kelremy,fecuu3c,t3_eoclci,"I have been struggling with depression for +10 years, and last year I was diagnosed with autism. I finally have an explanation as to why I am the way I am and why I have always struggled with things. I only wish I had been tested sooner instead of as an adult so I didn't have to spend all my life thinking I was failing as a human."
joycee97,fecz6l2,t1_fecuu3c,I feel you mate. Highschool was the most horrible time of my life because I couldn’t fit interact properly with my peers and I didn’t know why. I got bullied a lot because of it. Hopefully you were able to work through those feelings of thinking you were a failure as a human. Better late than never right?
Bromm18,fecv403,t3_eoclci,"I had several therapists suspect it, parents suspected it and primary doctor said it was likely. Got tested and told I missed the mark by a few points and since I am technically not Autistic I have found everyone to be quite harsh since the testing result. Even parents have outright stated that ""you tested as not autistic which means its all a result of your own actions and have only yourself to blame"". Never have I ever wanted to fail (pass) a test more than I did."
joycee97,fecyzzv,t1_fecv403,"You could always go to another therapist for a second opinion. Different therapists use different methods to see if you’re autistic. So if this test says you’re not by just a few points, another might say you are. It’s worth looking into!"
Rytez6,feczrlo,t3_eoclci,get use to being alone no female cares. sorry bro unless you make money no bitch is gonna look at you
TheMightyWizardKing,eofgj0,top_level,"I know it makes me sound inconsiderate, but I'm so tired of this. I'm so tired of fighting it and I'm tired of everything. Why do I have to force myself to keep suffering for God knows how much longer because people's feelings might get hurt if I die. I just want to be at peace. It's not fair."
LehndrixC,fecff5e,t3_eofgj0,I have felt like this for years and years
bouncing-boba,fecj6uc,t3_eofgj0,"I can empathize with what you are saying. I’m afraid to really say anything further than that because I feel like whenever someone tries to talk about suicide, and I mean _talk_ about it and not just jump to the “oh people will miss you you shouldn’t hurt yourself blah blah” stuff. It’s so real wanting to escape this twisted prison of a reality. Sure, if you’re lucky enough to not be completely numb to them there are little things, like big  fields with no one for miles, perfect breezes, endless seas and the tastes of certain foods. There are little bursts of dopamine in exchange for endless psychological torture and humiliation. It’s fucking cheap. And we’re supposed to stay, to lie about how we feel about this horrible life because we don’t want to make OTHER people uncomfortable. I hate it I hate fucking hate it. People need to shut the fuck up about how suicide is selfish because of you’re loved ones or some shit. Because it makes OTHER people feel bad. We’re supposed to endure this. Something we get NOTHING out of. For other people."
kash62,fects91,t1_fecj6uc,Thank you for taking the time to write out exactly how I’ve been feeling
MiserysBastard,fecw04t,t1_fecj6uc,Yep it's a beautiful situation for us ain't it /s
Stasi1975,fecq57p,t3_eofgj0,"Oh, no, honey, stay alive for yourself. Depression is a thief, a thief of joy, relationships, pleasure, in short, you're being robbed of your will to LIVE, not just exist for one more day. Screw the people you'll ""hurt"" because their grief is temporary.  You taking your life is robbing yourself of future ioy. I tried.  Three times, I tried to end it, the pain, the numbness, the hopelessness and futility of this sexually transmitted disease I was the product of. But I failed. The last time I said ""Fine, make it worth it"". It is. Those small things add up. Slowly, I LIVED, instead of existing.  I TOOK my pleasures and held them like shields, and I'm worth every selfish thing I've done. LIVE, don't exist."
DongDongExtreme,fecx7uo,t1_fecq57p,"> their grief is temporary

Not to take away from your message, but that's not really true. Suicide has a lifelong affect on people. My uncle and grandfather killed themselves before I was born and it hasn't stopped affecting my dad. I've also met people who had suicides tear apart families and friendship groups. It can be fucking devastating and it tends to leave a mark on people (in my experience).

That doesn't mean I think OP should live for the sake of others, but it's reductive to say that the grief of this kind of loss is temporary."
xx_nothing_to_say_xx,fecvmbb,t1_fecq57p,"out of curiosity what do you mean by ""numbness"" ?"
deadstone_,fectsaz,t3_eofgj0,"It's so frustrating and I hate how obligated I feel to remain alive for the sake of others, especially considering I'm not really adding much to their life or happiness but if I die it makes a much bigger difference to them.

Torment"
Theres_No_Light,fecsalr,t3_eofgj0,"Yup, it's also messed up they lock you up in a mental hospital like an animal if you speak of not wanting to be alive anymore."
forgetmenot66,fecshnt,t3_eofgj0,"I sincerely understand you.  I have asked that question a million times.  I have been there not long ago but 2 days ago. 
I don't have the right answer.  I swear I don't know why am not dead yet. 
I wish I had an answer that would soothe your pain.  
But all I have is me so you are not alone. Am a mess and I can not hide it anymore.  But you are not alone."
wanderingsouless,fect1n7,t3_eofgj0,"You are alive for the hope that it will get better. And I’ve been up and I e been real real low and yes at times the only thing keeping me alive was the thought of how much it would hurt those I love. Honestly that’s all I need sometimes is to remember that as much as life sucks sometimes, it’s not completely worthless. Even my pain has a lesson and a meaning even if it is only to remind me that tomorrow can be a different day. Do what you can to help yourself, for yourself. Find someone who you can talk to or even a hotline to just air your pain. Tomorrow might not be different, but what if it is?
Oh and get some meds! I’m not sure where I would be without them."
thenightwemet_,fectxaj,t3_eofgj0,I feel you dude. I would have taken my life a thousand times if I could have but I cant stop seeing my little brothers face when they tell him I killed myself and I wonder if anyone would feed my cat enough or love him enough to always keep him safe and make sure he comes in every night and I can't stop seeing my big brother who has worked so hard for the great life he has completely shutting down when he gets the call. And I hear my little sister who wont even remember much of me bc shes so little asking my mom what I was like some day and I think of my grandparents who I've never really gotten to be around getting the call and them feeling lost and guilty and not being able to understand. And I swear not many people in this whole world would care if I died but I'd protect some people with all I have in me and imagining hurting them when I know there are so many other resources and things i haven't tried yet is horrible. Suicide to me would be a dream come true but I cant pretend that it's not selfish if I haven't tried every single fucking way in my power to help myself
Hitchhiking-Ghost,fecukme,t3_eofgj0,"I have felt this way for over 30 years ( I’m 51), and truthfully, it is exhausting. My only advice is that you try to find the right medications to help you, and to talk about your problems with it others (Doctors, Support Groups, . . .). I go to Depression Support Groups twice a week and just knowing that there are others like me going through the same problems, makes life a little bit more tolerable. You are not alone."
lady_k80,fecwvw6,t3_eofgj0,"god it is so frustrating. my fiancé ended things with me about a month ago and has been forcing me to stay at our house throughout it because she’s scared of what i’ll do to myself. obviously i appreciate it so much, but we ended on bad terms and being in our old house and hearing her say hurtful things to me makes me feel exponentially worse. my plan intentionally includes the least amount of pain inflicted on others, but it makes me feel awful knowing that i’m literally being babysat so i don’t kill myself. i would never want to put that responsibility on anyone."
MiserysBastard,fecxbqq,t3_eofgj0,It's a fucking headache. I'll be going over a potential suicide scenario in my head and suddenly there's the fact my mom would be devastated popping up. There's the thought of body discovery and all that shit. It pisses me right off. Sometimes I feel like it'd be ideal if we all just died in an accident or something. Better yet if the world just ended.
harsherthanmemory,fecs7ty,t3_eofgj0,"You don't though. If you're not in a psych unit then nobody is stopping you from killing yourself. If you're still alive it's because you've continually chosen not to kill yourself. You want to live, or some part of you does. I know from my own experience that it's tough, but you need to accept that. You're not doing this for other people, you're doing it for yourself. There's no shame in that."
toosadtooreddit,fecud2p,t3_eofgj0,"It is not very easy to read other people thought and intention. Yes it is true if you kill yourself other people emotion will get hurt. But life is bullshit and we all know very well it is bullshit because we ourselves have endure that bullshit from time to time. So why this time you dont think maybe just maybe this time what you think is wrong. That if other people feel sad when you kill yourself then they also feel happy when you still around. They enjoy your company, every little thing you had done for them. You shouldn't expect good gesture from them all the time because we know absolute happiness doesn't exit but so does absolute sadness. And it is true that you had suffered for very long time but you don't have to be that all the time. Open yourself more and you can see how a mess life is but in that mess there can still be genuine happiness."
Dowager-queen-beagle,fecv8oc,t3_eofgj0,"I’m so sorry that you are going through this. You are heard, seen, and validated. ❤️"
K4LIBR8,feczxdl,t3_eofgj0,I've been trying not to kill myself the whole year and keeping it mostly away from my girlfriend. Yesterday she freaked out at me because she feels I'm not making enough progress... I think I might be close to doing it now but I don't want her life to be ruined but I feel I deserve to die because I will always fail now since I broke two years ago...
