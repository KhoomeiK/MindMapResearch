depression,fekywrc,t3_epmgz5,1579210485.0,"It is pretty incredible when you think about it. I can't believe there are so many people who fight against the idea of global warming. It all boils down to, for me anyway, that pollution is bad. Thing is the people who are doing most the damage are the business leaders. They got rich off of pollution. They aren't going to help solve the problem."
comicbookmovies,feky4n3,t3_ephiua,1579210015.0,This goes back a bit but I'd say the Rocketeer.
HarleyDilly,fejct4f,t3_epdjcr,1579167622.0,I'm sure we're not being told everything. I guess his mom busted his phone during that fight. Imagine if he had his phone on him?
insomnia,fejcmk9,t3_epge2d,1579167351.0,When I worked first shift I got into the bad habit of sleeping for a few hours after work. But I guess any sleep was better than no sleep.
Browns,feiz318,t3_ep3fvv,1579151291.0,"There was more. I remember he said something like ""how can you not make money owning an NFL team in Cleveland?"""
comicbookcollecting,fehs71d,t3_ep1tn8,1579122822.0,I got these when they came out. Read them so often as a kid that they aren't in the greatest shape. Wish I would have taken better care of my collection back then.
lonely,fehrzlh,t3_eozz6y,1579122706.0,"Exactly. I got married and I have kids but it's still like I'm from another planet. I'm shocked at how awful my loneliness is when I'm surrounded by people, especially ones that share my DNA."
Browns,fehr0tf,t1_fegtuk8,1579122155.0,Marty just had the worst luck. I think it was the Chargers that intercepted a bal on 4th down and then fumbled it back to the Pats. I also think the Pats made a deal with the devil somewhere along the way.
Marvel,fecttgz,t1_fecg1fr,1578984353.0,"ROM would be awesome, but I like Morbius. He had a really good comic in the 90s and the new one isn't that bad. I'm psyched for this and New Mutants."
depression,fecnp6b,t1_fecit1g,1578978506.0,When my son first started kindergarten the teacher told us he was autistic. We didn't see it. He paced a lot but we thought he was just hyperactive (he was our only boy). We kind of had a hard time accepting it. Now it's really obvious to us.
Cleveland,fecm576,t3_eoaayu,1578977324.0,I guess the question would be if the vouchers are working or not. Are children that get and use the vouchers more educated that the ones that don't? I think that would be easy to check with SAT scores and all the other testing they do.
FriendsOver40,fe6xo1i,t3_enwziw,1578907334.0,"I might be going through one right now, but I'm not sure."
nfl,fe0j57l,t3_enfxrl,1578814206.0,"Wait, so they have made the playoffs 30 times since the Super Bowl started? Does this count the Super Bowl loses as well? And they have never won a Super Bowl? Man, that sucks."
insomnia,fdwkqat,t3_en4ohn,1578759734.0,What I do is I turn on YouTube and listen to documentaries or true crime shows with my eyes shut. It distracts me enough to help me sleep.
death,fdoypzo,t3_emije9,1578615926.0,"God, I feel so bad for you. I would hate to go through this at such an early age. What do you mean by ""close deaths""? Did you have people who were close to you die or are you dealing with an illness? I don't know if this helps, but your brain isn't done growing yet."
comicbookcollecting,fdeypc8,t3_eky5hy,1578349429.0,The back end of Psi-Force is one of my favorite runs.
comicbooksuggest,fdd2jpe,t3_ekhiyd,1578292208.0,I really like the Savage Avengers. They are about 7 or 8 issues in.
menwritingwomen,fdat4p0,t3_ekcxqv,1578249779.0,"Wow, this is brilliant! I wonder if it works in Target as well? She can spend an hour in the three dollar aisles they have in the front of the store."
nfl,fd6l1kk,t1_fd68n6j,1578192588.0,The two defenders seemed to hit at the same time. That might have kept Watson upright.
loneliness,fcvvui9,t3_ej095p,1578011254.0,Definitely. Headaches at the very least are common.
MakeNewFriendsHere,fcvrmp4,t1_fcuim6h,1578008539.0,I guess. I do think that the central problem i have with them in their drug/alcohol use. My eldest got into a car accident and was arrested because she had drug paraphernalia on the seat. She's lost a few jobs and is just a mess. My second eldest just got a DUI. She was leaving our house Thanksgiving carrying her kid and fell down on top of her kid. My daughter had to get six staples in her head. She and her boyfriend keep wrecking cars. It's difficult watching your kids live like this.
Marvel,fct89gq,t3_eik1kc,1577935500.0,"Man, I just want them to get back together in the comics. It's been 30 years since they broke up. They are my favorite comic couple and this is killing me."
MakeNewFriendsHere,fct81qs,t1_fct0tdt,1577935333.0,"Sorry if that didn't make sense. I always thought that if I had a son it would be a disaster because I just didn't along with guys like I did with girls, so it just occurred to me while I was typing of how backwards my relationships with my kids turned out."
comicbookcollecting,fct7um8,t1_fct05y3,1577935182.0,Wasn't all the limited series from those years all newstands? I remember getting this as a kid. I didn't really know who Logan was but it was a first issue so of course I bought it.
MakeNewFriendsHere,fcsi1b5,t1_fcrygqs,1577916897.0,I'm the same way. I don't know why I get along better with women than men. I've been like this since I was a teen. And yet I'm not on speaking terms with my adult daughters.
Browns,fcshc60,t1_fcseq5d,1577916562.0,"I'm the same! That Monday Night game....Plus when I started following the Browns the Steelers were the worst team in our division. I can get behind Buffalo.  Every team has asshole fans (except the Browns, obviously)."
loneliness,fcpcmd9,t3_ei2wrl,1577858374.0,Same here. I think I'm at the point that I don't think it will get better.
Needafriend,fcp53u0,t1_fco8qt0,1577850751.0,"Ah man, this is the dream. Although I think I'd want to start before Thanksgiving."
comicbookmovies,fcp50q2,t1_fcmrg2e,1577850670.0,"I mean the casting is really good, I think anyway, and I've always liked the team. I have hope for this."
comicbookmovies,fcmhn2e,t3_ehy5hh,1577775625.0,Wouldn't it be funny if this movie actually does well?
Needafriend,fcjd9xi,t3_ehg0z4,1577683649.0,Ha-Ha! Wait till your 50s!
clevelandbrowns,fcj5rde,t3_eheqga,1577677948.0,We need to be thinking ahead more. Who should the Browns' HC be after they fire Kitchens' replacement? I think Kerry Locklin will be a good candidate in a couple of years.
MGTOW,fcij7q8,t3_eh67oa,1577663449.0,"My sister homeschools her kids and she's as dumb as shit. There should be some kind of baseline for teaching kids, cause now her kids are getting into the real world and they can't function."
Browns,fcihwh1,t3_ehbi74,1577662818.0,I bet they regret firing Chudzinski.
Browns,fci79ah,t3_ehbivm,1577658571.0,I thought those unforms brought bad luck.
lonely,fcb2orl,t1_fc8qdwv,1577581519.0,No. I'm done with them. They drink and start fights with me. DUI. Staples to the skull because of falling down drunk. Grand-daughter has a huge scar across her cheek because her mom fell on top of her. Pulled over after an automobile accident and has license suspended for drug paraphernalia in the car. Still drives and gets arrested. Living with one guy and sleeping with another. Lying about me behind my back to make me sound like an abusive father. There's a lot more but I'm tired of the craziness and the BS. I'm out.
nfl,fc7tdqf,t3_egk0hr,1577518136.0,"I think even if they never cheated, they would have still won a couple Super Bowls together."
lonely,fc7t678,t3_eglebo,1577517988.0,"I'm 50, married 23 years, five kids, two grandkids and lonely as hell. How is that possible? If you can't fit in with your family.....is there any you hope? So yeah, I feel your pain."
unpopularopinion,fc595kj,t3_eg7c7s,1577449439.0,"Are they failing? Let's see...Ghostbusters, Star Wars, Charlie's Angels, did less than expected. Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel did better (to be honest I wouldn't have gone seen Captain Marvel except for the fact that Nick Fury was in it and I was interested in his back story). I think the writing's is the main culprit, but we have so many networks and streaming services the pool of writers are probably running out."
lonely,fc4tuib,t3_eg5h2w,1577428204.0,"I'm in the same boat, except I'm allergic to cats."
comicbooks,fc4trau,t3_eg2q7u,1577428105.0,I remember the days when being a mutant used to mean something.
AskMen,fc4tlui,t3_eg2jmk,1577427935.0,I have a pinched nerve in my right arm that hampers some things. Learning how to play musical instruments can help. It forces you to increase your dexterity in your non-dominant hand.
FriendsOver40,fc4t06h,t1_fc4sl7y,1577427282.0,"In that case, just send me a reminder."
depression,fc4syg1,t3_eg1alh,1577427231.0,"If you posted this, you have a reason to be depressed. Don't disregard your unhappiness. It's important to let your feelings and thoughts out. Also, happy birthday."
FriendsOver40,fc4sish,t3_eg79tm,1577426777.0,I don't know.....it's kind of cold out.
depression,fc4qqsb,t3_eg4o7u,1577424997.0,Sorry this happened to you. I think this is just the way people are. Mental illness just doesn't get the same respect. It sucks.
AskMen,fc4qdo6,t3_eg5e8f,1577424642.0,"It's about the quality of the people you're with. If you're with a bunch of people who just gather for the sake of, I don't know, drinking, it gets kind of boring. I love being with people you can really get a great conversation going with, but for the most part everyone's just shallow."
Needafriend,fc4q32c,t3_eg23ke,1577424358.0,I worked as a alcohol/drug counselor. Pretty much most of the people you see are there to fulfill a legal requirement of some kind. It got old real fast. Sorry to be a downer.
depression,fc3sqpi,t3_efz27n,1577397672.0,I think this is the perfect way to go. I just wish I could melt away into nothingness and be done.
depression,fc3sg9g,t3_efwqy4,1577397465.0,"Blind, deaf and dumb."
Needafriend,fc1zvx2,t3_efp237,1577335061.0,"I really need to see that text. It's going to bother me until I do. Sorry, I'm OCD."
lonely,fbztkua,t3_efbiif,1577260819.0,Not a big deal. I go by myself all the time. I'm going tomorrow. People watch TV by themselves. Don't let that bother you. Maybe one day you'll meet someone that also went by themselves.
comicbookcollecting,fbx8qrh,t3_eeuljc,1577174512.0,"I started buying Spidey a few issues earlier, and this was a great two parter."
comicbookmovies,fbu6b5a,t3_eejekm,1577108571.0,"I'm usually the one that hates everything that others like, but I love Batman Vs. Superman. That was such an epic movie. I wish they could have stayed on course with the two part Justice League movies, but I think they were in a rush to compete with Marvel."
depression,fbu61w5,t3_eeh20j,1577108424.0,"I think our society has moved away from empathy. Everyone talks about sharing if you're in a crisis, getting help, but that's just all talk. The medical side of it is still the same as it was years ago. It's really just a sad joke."
depression,fbtrmd6,t3_eeen6v,1577092123.0,"I think we are smarter. I know that sounds bad and not politically correct, but I think in our brains intelligence and depression are linked somehow. Then we're outnumbered. Depression affects about 15%, which is still a huge amount of people. I wish there was an AA kind of thing for depression."
Adoption,fbtmf03,t3_eegrsy,1577084730.0,I think you should still do the search. My childhood wasn't as bad as yours but I definitely feel like my parents really didn't care. I was like a pet. I don't know. I still wonder why they even adopted in the first place. They didn't seem like they wanted kids. I found out my origin story and I don't think I would have ended up much better off after meeting my birth-mom's husband. I wouldn't mind going back in time and changing who adopted me.
DCcomics,fbtm1hd,t1_fbt3jdq,1577084253.0,I hate the JSA and JLA on the same Earth as well.
mildlyinteresting,fbtlx7s,t1_fbthbf9,1577084100.0,"That reflection is from me taking a picture from my phone to load on to here. I'm sure there's a way to turn the flash off, but I'm old and technology scares me, and my teenagers are already in bed, so I just figured the hell with it."
MGTOW,fbtbx3p,t3_ee8wo8,1577073987.0,"I always thought that these women should say yes in front of everyone then later turn the guy down, just to save him from the embarrassment."
insomnia,fbtbs5v,t3_eed06g,1577073870.0,This is very common. Best thing to do is just get out of bed and do something not too stimulating for about 30 minutes then try again.
goddesses,fbtblg7,t1_fbt2g4k,1577073715.0,Looks like Gone With The Wind.
Browns,fbt4w5i,t1_fbsxmam,1577068367.0,"Yeah, I agree. I don't know why players feel the need to celebrate things like first downs. They keep the drive alive, and maybe at the end of a game in which you need that first down to run out the clock, but otherwise........I don't know."
comicbookmovies,fbo1lsn,t1_fbkmsai,1577005719.0,"I like Morbius. He had a comic in the 90s that I really liked.  None of the others appeal to me. I was looking forward to New Mutants, but all buzz seems to be negative."
Marvel,fbnzsc0,t3_edx0qf,1577005225.0,My son's autistic. He really loved the Super Hero Squad figures and cartoon.
DCcomics,fbmxijj,t1_fbj2dut,1576990064.0,"Oh, that makes sense. Never really go to conventions but maybe now I have to."
AskMen,fbmwmf0,t3_edxldx,1576989757.0,"You don't sound intimidating, so I don't think that's the issue. How long do the relationship usually last?"
DCcomics,fbj1icg,t1_fbiuq3u,1576922201.0,I grabbed this because it was the last one. Got home and thought the same thing. What was the point? Just to fool people like me I guess.
loneliness,fbj0r2u,t3_edm55v,1576921543.0,I can't imagine being normal. After a few minutes of small talk I get bored.
nfl,fb9tcty,t3_ebz2dc,1576649119.0,Roger Staubach didn't have any? I would have thought otherwise.
PostConcussion,fb9s667,t3_ec7ft1,1576647892.0,It sounds like PCS. You can get it after one concussion. Also there's a wide range of how bad it can be. It's different for everyone.
MensLib,fb8x4v0,t1_fb81gfb,1576623926.0,"They wouldn't be able to help. We had to see someone to see if that would help when we filed bankruptcy, but the money issues are from my work injury and the case is just dragging on."
