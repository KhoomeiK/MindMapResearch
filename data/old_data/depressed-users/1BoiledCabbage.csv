While it's not uncommon to have simeone abandon a loved one over mental health issues, there's a lot of context missing, like what led up to said admission to the ward. Simply being depressed isn't enough to be placed in the ward, severe depression usually only gets patients a week or so, but they aren't often admitted into the ward. There had to have been something severe going on for a person to put their fiance in the ward and somehow ghost them."

My favorite generation us definitely TNG, mostly because the grade 9 characters and I were the same age when the episodes aired. It helped me through a lot of tough times as a teenager and it was really nice to have something to relate to.

Emma's constant ""save the earth"" story got overbearing at times. Manny knew this, but still helped her do whatever Emma needed her to do. Manny wanted to stop looking cute and looked for male attention and Emma loses her mind.
