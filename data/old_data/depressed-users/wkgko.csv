Your perception of another person's struggles is very limited though, especially if it's just based on someone's comment here or there.

Some people simply are out of their comfort zone all the time, I think we all know that it's not as simple as doing difficult things a few times and then it's all fixed. In many cases, there are multiple factors involved in the avoidance pattern, not just unwillingness to expose ourselves to scary situations. In my case, I have forced myself into scary situations many times, even when it was clearly traumatizing for me, because otherwise I wouldn't have been able to complete my degree or find work.

When you've been in a shitty situation for a long time, it's hard not to become bitter about it, and being accused of wallowing in self pity or not really trying or whatever is just the right icing on the depression cake."

Then there's stoic and Buddhist philosophy or meditation, but either I'm not good at making use of those or they're just not very effective for me.

The difference is that Huawei is a state-controlled enterprise, and the CCP is a fascist regime. No matter what one thinks of US politics, at least you can speak up about it and vote against whatever you don't like. Also there's a higher level of transparency than in the PRC. 

Idk, I don't want to write an essay, I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree of our assessment of Huawei's role and its relevance in terms of human rights."

Well, the rest of the world kind of frowns upon things like ethnic cleansing, concentration camps and kin punishment these days, and Huawei is one of the CCP instruments for establishing the surveillance system that perfects this.

No doubt the US does lots of horrible shit too, but that's not really relevant in a topic about Huawei.

> Huawei is the only company that proposed a treaty with countries like UK to guarantee their devices would not be used for spying. 

Yeah, nobody is stupid enough to believe such a treaty will hold up later once all the infrastructure is Huawei-made. It follows the belt-and-road ""soft"" power grab the PRC employs everywhere: first gain a foothold, then gradually start asserting control. The CCP couldn't even be bothered to honor the Sino-British declaration over HK, so why would anyone trust them now?"

LOL, this kind of defense comes up in the most ridiculous scenarios. Someone who is ""very nice"" (what does that even mean?) doesn't participate in that kind of thing. This wasn't just a split second decision that he immediately realized was wrong.

Hopefully he'll get a serious talking to,  so he can learn the value of humility and fundamental respect for other people and other beliefs. Otherwise his ""bright future"" is going to confirm that it's totally fine to be an asshole. We really don't need more of those."

It can be funny sometimes how people can talk past each other and still keep the ""conversation"" going, but it's always been very confusing to me. I guess for some people it's more important to talk than to be heard. Anyway, doesn't apply to you, just something I remembered in this context.

I'm not sure how you can make your own safety. After a recent health scare, I was reminded just how unable I am to generate the feeling of being safe. 

I've been aware that my lifestyle isn't really sustainable for a long time, but I feel like I'm simply stuck between behavioral patterns (anxiety / depression / avoidance), non-negotiable issues (e.g. health, work, chores), and external realities (e.g. not being all that interesting or attractive)."

AvPD,fc7ue4t,t1_fc5uynw,1577518890.0,"For me it was always more of a coping mechanism. For context, I've been living with more or less intense depression for all my life, so I had to learn to use will power to do everything.

I would say it can reduce the time to action for me, i.e. it can shift my mood and energy levels from feeling defeated and hopeless to ""let me approach this head on"", step by step, systematically. So it breaks the avoidance to some degree. I guess as a side effect it will also make me do more, but it's not so much a productivity tool as it is emotionally stabilizing.

It's also not something I think I have used with much intention. A lot of the time it is rather imitation, absorbing the behavioral patterns of fictional characters, e.g. when I binge watch a TV show or read a book. I don't imagine I *am* them or anything like that, but it's also not analytical.

That's why I consider my escapism to be beneficial and productive, because it stabilizes me. I dislike the generalization of calling escapism ""bad"". When I don't have any good show to watch for that, I feel much worse and I'm much more susceptible to anxiety and depression. It might be different if I weren't so socially isolated, I don't know, but I sure as hell function a lot better with that safety net.

I don't think I break out of this merged state quickly, it's rather something that fades over time if the external characters that I merge with disappear from my experience.

Not sure if that makes sense."

I've noticed that if I'm fully identified with my experience, then life can be very scary and overwhelming, especially emotionally. When something bad happens, I pretty much regress emotionally into a terrified child-like state in which I really, really want someone to come along and take care of things for me in the way parents do it for their children.

On the other hand, I can feel trust in the narrative of characters who persist under very difficult circumstances, simply because I believe in their competence and strength (probably because I have ""experienced"" them in fiction, with escapism being one of my main coping mechanisms). Personally there's  a breaking point where I always feel weak and helpless, and it's extremely difficult to cope with life requirements in this state. 

Getting some distance between that distressing experience and moving to the narrative / character perspective has felt reassuring at times, but I haven't stayed in this state for longer stretches."
