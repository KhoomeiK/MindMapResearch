SuicideWatch,fekx5no,t3_epmh3y,1579209435.0,People would be sad I guess. They'd get over me pretty fast.
depression,fekn3uj,t3_epileo,1579203494.0,Living is more effort than it's worth sometimes.
depression,fec8lsl,t3_eo55m9,1578968557.0,"The amount of times I've been told it's the easy way out is ridiculous. It's a hard choice. It's permanent. Forever. But sometimes it's the easier choice than having everything around us burn and crumble while we stand in the middle of the debris and ruins. We don't want to see the ruins, so blinding ourselves is the only option. 

I'm not condoning it, I'm just saying it's a lot harder than people think."
depression,fe8jr3z,t3_enrs4c,1578926912.0,"Yes. I stopped writing in my journal for his very reason. Everything ends up reading extremely depressing and horrible because of the way I write, and I prefer not to look back on that.

I also break down more often than people realize. I feel like a burden at all times. My life rolled the unluckiest possible option in all categories and I'm sick of making other people sad or upset by letting my emotions out."

depression,fdd1o5i,t1_fdd1eq0,1578291254.0,Thanks for the offer. I may or may not take you up on it later.
depression,fdchk7w,t3_ekc47f,1578275065.0,"I feel you. I don't think you're a piece of shit hough, everyone has their virtues. You'll find yours eventually. I'm sure you're a much better person han you're making yourself out to be, friend."
depression,fdchdgr,t3_ekj9jz,1578274932.0,"I did too. My paranoia about my friends took over and they made last minute plans without me. They're probably talking about me. If they are, then I don't feel comfortable around them anymore. If they aren't then I was never important enough to be spoken about anyway. And my brain just spasmed from there and everything rushed to my head so fast. When I came to, I was in the corner of my bed.

It sucks. Take a breather, get some water. It's okay to be sad, but if you keep it all in then it comes out inthe form of a panic attack or mental breakdown. Let yourself feel sad or upset. It'll save you the stress of it hitting you all at once later. Stay safe."
depression,fdcgc3d,t3_ekeedb,1578274208.0,"I'm at the same point, except I'm only 19 and female. The three boyfriends I had only lasted a couple months each and turned out to be rapey, obnoxiously obsessive, and emotionally detached, respectively.

I don't get many advances. I'm below average, have no self esteem, and I come from a background that is difficult for a normal person to deal with. Most people outright won't deal with it. I have no skills,, nothing to offer, my only friend group is slowly pushing me out at the moment, and I'm just so unstable that I'm more of a challenge than a relationship. And it makes me sad, because I'm lonely."
depression,fcpdmuz,t1_fcp5dey,1577859530.0,"Thanks homie. It's a good game...when I'm winning, anyway.

I mean, I just don't talk. I'm here and nobody initiates conversations with me. It's lonely and I hate it. I just want someone to talk to me. Like, a fully blown conversation instead of people using the same joke about my name for the millionth time. They care but I guess I'm just too boring of a person.

I'm 19. It's ten times as hard for me to get up on my feet compared to a lot of other people and I hate it. My family is dirt poor, I had to drop school for them, I'm an ugly fuck with adhd and severe chronic depression and romantic relationships don't happen for me. I'm in too bad of a place for them but I'd like nothing more than human companionship.

Thanks though."
SuicideWatch,fcpa1la,t3_eieayu,1577855712.0,"Yes. I'm staying the night at a friend's house because the bus I need doesn't run tonight. I wish I was on a bridge instead. I don't deserve to be here. People don't want me here, anyway."

depression,fbx7eby,t3_eevdx0,1577172663.0,"It's weird for me. I have everything bad, as bad as it can possibly get, and people still tell me to ""get over it"". How can I get over a horrid and abusive family, little money, and the overall awful luck I've been granted? I need to work ten times as hard as the average person to get on my feet- yet people still tell me I'm not trying hard enough. That I should be happy I'm a year away from leaving. I just don't have the energy to try anymore."
