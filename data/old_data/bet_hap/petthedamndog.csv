doktor_wankenstein,fdoyuhq,t1_fdotyrl,"""I might have been killed! I think I need a belly rub."""
K3nFr0st,fdpe6ra,t1_fdotyrl,It's always this when it comes to doggos...no doubt about it.
i_wap_to_warcraft,fdoohif,t3_emgcx9,"And then goes straight for the face lick I see, just like mine 😍"
moustached_pistachio,fdp6wtq,t3_emgcx9,"My dog gets those eyes only when he helps himself to the contents of the garbage can. I used to get mad at him, but we’ve had each other for so long now that I just clean up the mess while he wags happily in the kitchen. I love my good boy so much."
honest_blonde,fdqxwyo,t1_fdp6wtq,"I hate being that person, but I think it’s important I say something just Incase it helps someone. Always be careful if your dog loves getting into the garbage. I heard a horror story about a friend of a friends dog that got into the trash and suffocated while the owners were at work trying to get to some food out of a plastic bag they had thrown away. I’m sure coming home to find your dog like this is every dog owners worst nightmare, so please just be aware of what you’re throwing away if this is a habit your pup has."
jld2k6,fdrc8ih,t1_fdqxwyo,A good tip we used to have to use is that you're supposed to cut off the bottom of chip bags and other bags like that with scissors if you've got a dog known to get in the trash. Ours liked to get into it as a puppy and we had to do that for about a year
itsrainingpens,fdoniw9,t3_emgcx9,So cute!!!
EldraziKlap,fdopfjp,t3_emgcx9,YOU SIR WILL PET THIS DOG OR I AM GONNA FREAK
bryanja1,fdoo1r7,t3_emgcx9,He sure does!    But you can’t stay upset with him very long because he’s so stinking cute!!!
RequiemOfLigh,fdooq6r,t3_emgcx9,Oh god the eyes.
whorewithaheart_,fdozair,t3_emgcx9,Unless you catch them in the act they don’t actually know they did anything wrong. The dog just associates a mess on the floor with you being angry. Good boy deserved pets regardless
tickonadog,fdp35ce,t1_fdozair,"I feel like my pup knows when she was bad.  If she gets the rare urge in her to maul something like this, when I get home she won’t come greet me and will just look sad on the couch.  

That usually sets me on the hunt to find what was destroyed.  Don’t know why she gets so sad, all I ever do is show her the destroyed item and in a stern voice say “you were a bad girl.”  After that she slinks outside for 5 minutes.  That seems to reset her and she goes back to being a happy pup."
Natural_Piglet,fdp7m65,t1_fdozair,I don't mind when my dog rips his toy to shreds to be honest. I'll gladly clean it up if it means I don't have to deal with him ripping *my* shit to shreds. He's a good boy :)
fallway,fdp6req,t1_fdozair,I’ve always read and believed this until I got a dog. It’s absolutely not true.
whorewithaheart_,fdpao1a,t1_fdp35ce,"Because she doesn’t like being shamed and she associates whatever the aftermath is as the problem. Dogs can’t recollect memories like you think or have conscious thinking  where they view time in the same prism humans do

They have the emotional intelligence of a 4 year old"
Billy_Joels_holes,fdpb9xa,t1_fdpao1a,So you're saying a 4 year old is incapable of remembering or recalling something? Lmao
Brian175,fdpy69o,t1_fdpao1a,"I had a dog that would sometimes pee on the 3rd floor of our house that we didn't go up to frequently after she got older. If she saw you go up there and come back down only after she did she would immediately get into a panic. We didn't even get upset because she had gotten to a point where she couldn't seem to help it, but due to potty training from when she was younger she'd get upset. But regardless, I feel failure certain a dog can recollect something that happened a few hours ago."
Sofia_Bellavista,fdq1g7r,t1_fdpao1a,"We can’t claim that, studies that “proved” this may have been poorly designed. There’s plenty of empirical evidence of the contrary, so we need to keep design more accurate and conclusive studies before being 100% sure."
LostandFoundUser,fdp7sw8,t1_fdp79qa,YO THERE ARE WAY MORE SIGNIFICANT REASONS TO CALL SOMEONE A BAD DOG OWNER AND GIVING A STERN “ bad dog” ISNT FUCKING ONE OF THEM.
fallway,fdp7tz3,t1_fdp79qa,You have no idea what you're talking about and I'm not going to explain my personal circumstances so some idiot on the internet
whorewithaheart_,fdpckcl,t1_fdpb9xa,"Here's what is happening. While you are away the dog gets into some super self rewarding behavior. Woo hoo I get to chew on shoes, play in the trash. It's rewarding and fun. Now when you come home you get angry or punish the dog for the after effects of the behavior. So you get angry at the chewed shoe, or the trash everywhere and the dog makes that association. They are two completely separate events. Your dog doesn't realize that you are upset over the event of chewing a shoe or getting into the trash.

For a human example it would be like getting upset that your girlfriend got pregnant despite your refusal to wear a condom. The reward and pleasure from the act itself is forefront to the consequences later.

Hope this helps"
whorewithaheart_,fdqoqju,t1_fdpy69o,"It’s hard to wrap your head around because the dog knows what happened was bad. Her behavior was a result of you being upset therefore she hid it on the third floor. 

I don’t think people are grasping even if you catch a dog in the act it’s not going to really work as well as if you caught them right before the act 

They just cannot connect why you are mad at the moment to what they did before. They just understand what happened creates a bad reaction from you and they won’t understand why

Potty training should require allot of treats no punishment, put the food where the dog went to the bathroom so it understands it’s pissing it’s house. 

Here the dog doesn’t truly understand outside vs inside. That’s why you crate train and keep the crate small enough the dog doesn’t have room to shit. It’s about them understanding the entire house is inside"
whorewithaheart_,fdqo9lc,t1_fdq1g7r,"You have a source of the opposite? All I found were daily mail with 0 reliability

More than happy to read about it if you can support your argument

Tons of studies have been conducted as far back as the 60’s"
tidbitsofblah,fdphxxo,t1_fdpckcl,How does that explain the dog behaving ashamed/sad before the owner even gets home and finds the shoe/trash/whatever?
alexthebiologist,fdpthxx,t1_fdpckcl,"I don’t buy it. What about the dogs you see who are chewing the couch/shoe/etc happy as can be and suddenly notice they’re being watched. They do the “I’m a naughty dog” thing, forbidden item still in mouth. They know the chewing is bad"
Brian175,fdrplq2,t1_fdqoqju,I think you are mistaken. The dog was potty trained. The dog just got really old and couldn't make it from the time we left until we got back. This particular dog would scratch the door anytime she needed to be let out if we were actually around. Previously she could hold it from morning til evening.
Sofia_Bellavista,fdqpxav,t1_fdqo9lc,"Yes the book The Genius of Dogs by anthropologist Brian Hare presents several studies. Hare is Associate Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University, where he founded the Duke Canine Cognition Center. There are more authors but I can’t remember their names from the top of my head

Edit: typo"
fallway,fdp8ddr,t1_fdp82kk,"""Reading up on dogs"" is precisely where one gets anecdotal evidence. As a responsible pet owner, I instead opted to go through formal training to receive information directly from educated professionals rather than uninformed opinions passed mindlessly along on the internet, such as the infinite wisdom you came forward with. Somehow you think my response means I haven't done anything upon catching my dog in the act, lol. Keep making assumptions, your opinion and words are meaningless."
whorewithaheart_,fdpij7y,t1_fdphxxo,"The result of whatever the dog did is clear to him if he’s seen your reaction before therefore it’s  trying to stop you from providing it with a negative action. It’s not really guilt more so the dog trying to change your behavior. 

Second point: 
It’s associating the end result than understanding the action of the event. The only point I’m trying to make is correcting a dogs behavior past the event will confuse the dog and it won’t understand why you are mad at it

If you own a dog it’s really fun to read about them then spend time and see how they react to certain things. I love dogs allot which is why I get upset when I see owners yelling at a dog that pissed on the floor and they didn’t catch it"
ajwinter94,fdq48wf,t1_fdpthxx,"Because they have been caught in the act, and have been conditioned from previous responses to understand that *being caught chewing* is a bad thing, not *actually chewing the shoe*. That's why the continue to go back and chew the shoe. They don't associate actually chewing the shoe as bad when you respond in anger or guilt tripping, only that being caught is bad. As far as they're concerned the act of chewing the shoe is fine."
whorewithaheart_,fdrpqfn,t1_fdrplq2,Ah right I mean makes sense
whorewithaheart_,fdqss80,t1_fdqpxav,"I’ll have a read, I always love reading about dogs but I would have to understand the content Fully to see what it is counter arguing. Thanks for the references though, much appreciated"

I'm a dog trainer with 20 years experience of working with dogs, including working as the primary supervisor on dog yards at over half a dozen doggie daycares in 3 different cities.  I am a certified expert in Dog Behaviors and a Pet Care Technician.  I currently run my own dog training/sitting service.

But hell, don't take MY word for it...take Jack Volhard's word for it.  

 ""A popular misconception is that the dog knows ""what he did"" because he looks ""guilty"". ABSOLUTELY NOT SO! He has that look because from prior experience he knows that when you happen to come across a mess, you get mad at him. He has learned to associate a mess with your response. He hasn't and CAN'T make the connection between having made the mess in the first place and your anger. Discipline after the fact is the quickest way to undermine the relationship you're trying to build with your dog.""

Jack and Wendy Volhard are world renowned dog trainers with over 50 performance and conformation titles with their dogs. They are known as the ""trainers of trainers"", and are award winning authors with books translated into three languages. Trainers from every state and 15 countries have attended their training camps.

Jack Volhard is the author of ""Teaching Dog Obedience Classes : The Manual for Instructors"" which is also known as ""the bible"" the entire world over. He has also been an American Kennel Judge for over 30 years.

Wendy, Jack's wife, is also an award winning author about dog behaviors in her own right, and is the developer of ""The Canine Personality Profile"". She also developed the most widely used system for evaluating and selecting puppies, and released award winning films on dog behaviors.

&#x200B;

I have yet to meet ANY dog trainer worth their salt who thinks otherwise.  You are simply wrong"
whorewithaheart_,fdp8tvr,t1_fdp8ddr,Tons of studies have been done on it. It’s 2020 no ones just passing on hearsay.
tidbitsofblah,fdprvii,t1_fdpij7y,"If the dog can understand that the thing they did will cause a negative reaction, which they show that they do by behaving differently after doing certain things before you even know about it, then they must understand that your negative reaction is connected to the thing they did. How else can they know that you will have a bad reaction?

If it's guilt or not is kind of impossible to say philosophically. That's not the point."
ElephantSquad,fdq9zcu,t1_fdq48wf,"nah, they know"
fallway,fdqiqym,t1_fdpnh0q,"So just for your awareness, it appears that the other commenter may have edited their comments because they specifically called me a bad dog owner for not punishing my pets (which is pure speculation anyways, regardless of right or wrong), among other things. You then support their position by using using the quote that “discipline after the fact is the quickest way to undermine the relationship you’re trying to build with your dog”. 

They have taken a bad faith position for their argument, which led to you misinterpreting the exchange. No, that person is absolutely NOT 100% right. 

My mere contention was that a statement such as “the dog just associates a mess on the floor with you being angry” is not accurate as it does not address any degree of nuance and complexity, as there are other variables.

I’ve been through more than one puppy training school, have engaged many professionals in the field and have actively researched pet behavior with my wife so we know we are doing the right thing. That other commenter has since admitted that they were a bad pet owner, and that people should do a quick google search to inform themselves. Sorry, they may have an opinion that may be right, but their approach is completely wrong. I would expect someone with the experience you claim to have to appreciate that."
cometbaby,fdpcc3r,t1_fdp8tvr,"Clearly you’ve never been on the internet then. People say whatever they want and feel without any evidence whatsoever. Just put the shovel down, friend. People are gonna think what they think and no one is accomplishing anything here other than making random people angry. 10/10 not worth it. As long as no one is beating or neglecting their pups then we should all be fine."
Moral_Anarchist,fdpnw9i,t1_fdp8tvr,"It's an uphill battle, isn't it?  All these casual dog owners know so much more than any expert.

&#x200B;

Every single time I bring this up outside of a group of actual Dog Trainers I get downvoted to oblivion...but if even one person reads it and realizes the truth, it's been worth it.  

&#x200B;

Keep spreading the truth...we'll teach them someday"
ajwinter94,fdq4187,t1_fdprvii,"When you walk in and are angry when you find a chewed shoe, they associate the anger with the chewed shoe.

When you walk in and are angry when you find the dog actually *in the act* of chewing the shoe, they associate the anger with the act of *being caught* chewing the shoe.

The chewed shoe, and the act of chewing the shoe, are two completely independent events in the mind of a dog. They live in the moment, and don't draw linear timelines like we do from chewing shoe -> chewed shoe -> bad. Whatever was the most recent event is what they respond to. The proof is in the pudding - show me one dog that stopped chewing shoes from being 'guilt tripped' like in this video. You have to catch them in the act to affect any change."
whorewithaheart_,fdqox2z,t1_fdq9zcu,"He’s spot on

You want the dog to stop you catch them right before they do and then reward them for not doing it

He’s trying to explain dogs are conditioned to your response and their reward system for building healthy habits

Catching dogs in the act is way less productive than catching right before. It’s almost not even worth it to reprimand if you catch them in the act. They wi just behave well when you are around. When you’re gone, they will go right back to chewing shoes 

Hope this makes sense"
ajwinter94,fds9fx6,t1_fdq9zcu,"I'm a dog trainer, I do this every day. It's the same reason rubbing a dogs nose in its pee when you come home and find it's gone to the bathroom in the house does nothing to change the behaviour. All it does is train it to pee in hidden places on the house so you can't find it."
Moral_Anarchist,fdqo8iw,t1_fdqiqym,"Wait, they called you a bad dog owner for NOT punishing your pets?  

&#x200B;

Yeah maybe they did edit their statement, because that's not what it read when I responded at all...or indeed what it reads now.

&#x200B;

Of course there are other variables...way too many to list in a simple reddit post without visual aids and descriptions of the area and type of mess itself...I simply use the broad strokes to try to get the point across.

&#x200B;

As I said before, you should NEVER punish your pet after the fact...if the earlier person said that, I take back my statement that that person was 100 percent right.  I meant that they were 100 percent right in that the dog cannot associate making the mess with your reaction unless they are literally caught in the act"
whorewithaheart_,fdpd05o,t1_fdpcc3r,"Eh it’s important to try and educate dog owners even if it’s an uphill battle. Even if one person now understands dogs are unable to connect two different events at two different points in time. 

My point was just don’t reprimand a dog if you don’t catch it to the person I was responding to"
whorewithaheart_,fdpos8e,t1_fdpnw9i,I think or hope people do a quick google search and start questioning themselves. I just grew up a shitty dog owner for multiple reasons. It took me a long time to get it right bc I just accepted what people told me. Definitely reading the books you posted

mijoli,fdpm61m,t3_emgcx9,"Party pooper dog trainer here. The body language that we humans interpret as ""guilt"" is just appeasement behavior unrelated to their actions, but related to the environment and the owners behavior.

In one study, dogs were taught that the presence of a specific object in a room, would mean their owner would scold them when they got there. They very quickly started looking ""guilty"" when their owner entered the room, though they had absolutely nothing to do with the ""bad dog"" object. If the object wasn't there, no ""guilty"" face. The dogs actions didn't matter, the environment did.

Dogs that don't get scolded don't do this, regardless of the environment. They're just happy their owner is back.

These expressions are really just fear. Dogs look like this when they anticipate something scary. They likely anticipate their owner being mad because of what the room looks like, not because they made the room look like that. Guilt in humans is a different kind of fear. 

This face indicates a learning history that includes fear. It's not any cuter than a video of a crying child. The good news is you don't need to ever scold your dog, there are more humane and efficient ways to teach dogs to behave well. Manage the environment, mind the motivating operations and help the dog feel safe when alone."

Mine will chase a soccer/tennis/lacrosse ball until she died lol. She does the same thing to anyone who comes into the house. We had electricians doing some work a few months back and when one of them went outside to finish installing some outside outlets, she followed him into the yard and when I came out she was standing behind him with her soccer ball in her mouth with a thousand yard stare in his direction—“hey you, new guy, put down the screwdriver and throw my ball please” 😂"

dadankness,fdmd4mq,t3_em20hx,This is the one trait in dogs I get annoyed with.  Only slight annoyance.  But still.
comfortable_madness,fdmkbb8,t1_fdmd4mq,"It only annoys me because it worries me that something is wrong with them. Like you've been fed, you have water, you've been out and walked... are you hurting? Is something wrong? Are you sick?"
appaulling,fdmrza3,t1_fdmd4mq,"Dog just wants to play. Or maybe she needs to poop.

I have a GSD who does the exact same thing, makes the same exact noises. Just wants attention. It's very sweet, imo. In the morning when everyone is sleepy she will happily entertain herself but she will get like this if I ignore her all day."
random_nightmare,fdmp0no,t1_fdmkbb8,Usually it’s just that they don’t have your 100% undivided attention and how dare you look away for one second pay attention to me! Or at least that’s the case for my girl. Can’t take a phone call with out her getting jealous.
comfortable_madness,fdmpjne,t1_fdmp0no,"My beagle started it a few months ago. She does it mostly after she eats. Not *all* the time, but when she does it, it's usually after she eats. I thought maybe her belly hurt so I cut back on her food a little so she wouldn't over eat. Nope, still does it. So I gave her a little more, thinking maybe she was still hungry. Nope. She doesn't eat fast and her teeth are good so... I dunno.

But this is the same dog who walks around with a water bottle in her mouth, whining the entire time while looking for a place to hide it for about 20 mins before giving up and dropping it in the middle of the floor.

She's done it so often now my blue heeler mix is doing it lol."
CtrlAltPajeet,fdmq6gd,t1_fdmp0no,"It’s from them being poorly trained. My mother bought a cocker spaniel and treats it like a teddy bear, not a dog. It whines and barks constantly and is so annoying. If you start having a conversation he starts whining and barking louder and louder to drown you out and to try and get the attention back to himself. Train your dogs guys. My mums one is literally neurotic because of it."
random_nightmare,fdmpoqm,t1_fdmpjne,I’ve got a GSD she just does almost anytime she wants attention and isn’t getting it. It’s gotten better when it’s just me and her at home. But anyone else in the mix and she’s back to whining if she doesn’t have something else to distract her.
random_nightmare,fdmrfts,t1_fdmq6gd,"Hopefully you’re not insinuating my dogs untrained based on her whining a bit when she wants attention. Yeah if it’s overt and constant it’s can be because of training or they’re not getting enough exercise. In my case she’s a GSD and they’re known whiners. Outside of that she’s well behaved and hardly barks even when home alone. I live in a apartment and have given my number to my neighbors so I’d know if she’s an actual issue.
She could use a bit more training at other houses but it’s hard for me to do in my current situation."

KnightBourne,fdl5qga,t1_fdkrdrs,That’s incorrect. Natural selection is the opposite of artificial selection. Both of which are types of evolution.

Kettchitup,fdk0rib,t3_elprzg,"I love huskies but I know my work schedule would not allow me to properly take care of one, unless I make up an injury so I can bring it to work (service dog)"
Redeemer206,fdkp6if,t1_fdk0rib,"You know.... There are people you can hire for that sort of thing... To ""change your status"" to injured I mean"
ThePr0tag0n1st,fdln831,t1_fdk0rib,"Huskies are very uncommon service dogs I believe. Have to remember when they are working its not you taking care of them its them taking care of you and you still have to take care of them at some point. 
I know you meant this more theoretically but still."

xoxrobot,fe8dova,t3_eny6k7,My Great Pyrenees is the same way! They’re hyper gentle giants and I love it.
gijoe75,fe98f3g,t1_fe8dova,"Yep we keep them for guard dogs on our farm. Super lazy all day and sleep in the shade but they patrol all night and we find dead skunks, coyotes, and snakes all the time! If you don’t walk into the yard with a family member you are liable to get bit. Cute lil murder pups."
d0nut0bsession,fec7uhh,t1_fe8dova,My part-pyrenees is the same too! They love with their teeth and like to slap you with love
DaGoat99,feaa8u3,t1_fe98f3g,That's the same reason we have ours. As long as we introduce them to new people it's good but as soon as someone or something they dont know even tries to step foot on the property there is no stopping them.
xoxrobot,feccc5n,t1_fec7uhh,"Mines not like that at all! He won’t even take a treat from you with his teeth, he uses his tongue. He’s territorial with squirrels and other animals but if it’s a person all he wants is pets. I’ve never seen him get aggressive with a person and he’s 7 years old."
layres3,feaqz2e,t1_feaa8u3,"Got a guy at our church. Has two for livestock protection. He woke up one morning to his boys covered in stick blackish red goop. Definitely blood. They walk him into the woods and lo and behold, dead coyote. They were so proud."

a_girl__has_no_name,fdseaa5,t3_emqony,The stray dogs in turkey are very independent!  They didn’t seem to care so much about people being around (unless they were offered food) and just hung out in pretty informal packs. Really want to go back there and pet them all!
mkeSpecial,fdsb651,t3_emqony,Dat air lick

Zoso757,fdywa45,t1_fdyuh0v,Yes and yes. Current doggo is big on sneaking French kisses on the unwary whenever possible.
pinchecody,fdyzqgg,t1_fdywa45,"Lol. That's how ours were. Right now my mom has some terrier/dachshund mix she adopted. The sweetest, cutest little thing but she'll shove her tongue right in your mouth when you least expect it"
