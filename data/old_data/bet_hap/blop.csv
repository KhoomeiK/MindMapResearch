Lamella,fdw98bd,t3_en5jd1,Fist bump from a fellow keeshond parent!
JenniMGF,fdwb1cd,t1_fdw98bd,"*returns first bump* 
I had never heard of them until I met my husband! He really wanted (still wants) to get a Eurasier but they seem to be a lot harder breed to find in Australia, so we settled on a Keeshond as we will also be inheriting the mother-in-law‚Äôs in the near future. It‚Äôs funny explaining the breed to other people as most people I know also haven‚Äôt heard of Kees!"
kitty_kuddles,fdx8pjo,t1_fdwb1cd,"I have a Eurasier (Canada) and she is the BEST! Our breeder was sending one off to Germany at the time as well, I truly don‚Äôt know how ethical or expensive it is to send to Australia from here, but perhaps looking into foreign options might be a good idea if you really want one."
Lamella,fdwbzut,t1_fdwb1cd,"Most people ask me if she's a chow chow or they think she's a mix or something. I get so many questions when we're on walks. They're great dogs though, if a little high strung lol."
JenniMGF,fdyg12k,t1_fdx8pjo,"Thanks! We have had a look in the past and i think it would be really expensive. And correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but Eurasier‚Äôs require a good amount of yard space to run around in regularly? I seem to recall that was a thing and currently we basically have no yard. The Keeshonds we have are typically indoorsy but they so love going out for walks so we do that daily. If we get a place in the future with plenty of room (and if we can save some $) we might be able to look at importing an Eurasier, for now we have these adorable floofs to take care of :)"
kitty_kuddles,fdyuita,t1_fdyg12k,Fair enough! Enjoy them they‚Äôre absolutely gorgeous!
P0sitive_Outlook,fdwlrye,t3_en5jd1,Never seen this kind of dog before! :D It looks like you got your dog a dog outfit.
JenniMGF,fdyf40m,t1_fdwlrye,"Awww, I can assure you she is 100% Keeshond doggo (as close as you can get 100% anyway)! Be sure to look them up, they are a gorgeous breed :)"

JenniMGF,fdygudq,t1_fdxbdfe,We joke all the time about how they act like cats. Our mother-in-law‚Äôs oldest seems to act like a cat a lot. Even this little pupper looks like a cat from behind when she‚Äôs laying down. I can assure you they are very much doggo though!
errantapostrophe,fdxj26c,t3_en5jd1,"Kees are such great dogs! We had three when my kids were little and they were very kid friendly, but just a little too smart. They learned how to open our fridge and eat all the cheese. One would distract us by being cute while the other two went and got into trouble."
JenniMGF,fdynf83,t1_fdxj26c,Yes absolutely! I believe that 100%. They are sometimes too smart for their own good. I‚Äôm sure my husband has many more stories but the mother-in-law‚Äôs eldest is called Mischief (I‚Äôm sure you can guess why!). She doesn‚Äôt like loud or annoying noises (like beeping or thunder). One day the dishwasher kept making a beeping noise so she kept going outside. When my husband got home she went outside at the front and then started going into the pond; because she knew if she was wet she‚Äôs not allowed into the house and she didn‚Äôt want to go into the house because of the annoying beeping..... it‚Äôs crazy sometimes how they make connections like that!
