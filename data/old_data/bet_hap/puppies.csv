JoeDaBruh,fdlrd4r,t3_elpk9l,I though she was going to use him as a phone
SymbolOfFlight,fdm8ob3,t3_elpk9l,like a moving marshmellow
Ikillesuper,fdlm5ao,t3_elpk9l,Vets favorite patients are the ones they don’t have to see often. Dogs this small have tons of health problems.
gobbliegoop,fdlp82h,t1_fdlm5ao,"True but this looks like a maltese puppy and will (hopefully) grow to the appropriate weight . I have 2, the tail and hair look identical to mine when they were puppies."

xcasandraXspenderx,fdjeewf,t3_elnpph,Is this a car wash for dogs?!
spicy_tim,fdjgeo5,t1_fdjeewf,"Yes! It's amazing! It has shampoo, oatmeal shampoo, conditioner, flea and tick treatment, plus a few other things that all come out of one sprayer, and has a blow dryer!"
MissZT,fdlcasq,t1_fdjgeo5,"And if it's anything like the one in my town, it has a basin the dog stands in with a non slip bottom and a chain to clip your dog to so they cant jump out either side! Its waist height so no bending over and ours only costs 7 dollars for 10 mins of wash and dry time!"
spicy_tim,fdlyiqn,t1_fdlcasq,Yeah basically the exact same it's so much easier with a 60lb dog.
glitterwitch18,fdjop4h,t3_elnpph,I thought the towel was his ears for a moment!
predneck1,fdjbjee,t3_elnpph,This Apollo mission failed.
athanathios,fdjx37b,t3_elnpph,He feels betrayed. I moved to showering my dog in the shower with nice warm water and the massage head helps get the suds out and she loves the massage! She gladly tolerates it.
S1X0N3F0UR,fdkx4s8,t3_elnpph,I thought that was a Jedi.

calamityfriends,fdtmcuz,t3_en2mmc,"He is too afraid of the tray his food is on to eat it, he's just laying in front of it now"
thisismyhawaiiacct,fduf2q9,t1_fdtmcuz,"Poor guy! Have you had ant issues? My parents had a Boxer that was traumatized by the movement of a sudden influx of ants, and refused to eat from his metal food bowl due to the reflections, movement, etc. Matte white paper plates ended up being necessary in his case."
calamityfriends,fdwl6t9,t1_fduf2q9,"Oh nothing like that, he was a bit overweight so we are trying to get him to eat slower, and spreading out the food helps, hes just afraid of it right now because he's a little bit of a coward. His water bowl stressed him out for awhile."
thisismyhawaiiacct,fdwupi3,t1_fdwl6t9,"Aw, sweet boy is just having a big drama! Hope he adjusts soon."
calamityfriends,fdwwsuc,t1_fdwupi3,"He's the most pampered dog I have ever met and yet he has strange anxiety over thing like his water bowl, not being given enough affection (he gets it all the time), the Roomba surprisingly doesn't freak him out, but the cats do, also the rug"
codygooch,fdtv3p1,t3_en2mmc,"Can confirm, is coward.

I'm trying out feeding him on a tray to keep him from snarfing his food down in three seconds."
sheedu,fdx9gvk,t3_en2mmc,Breed?

sheedu,fdy4ykb,t1_fdxczp4,Cool.  Looks bigger than average
