admiralmandrake,fe5q1fx,t1_fe2rmwp,Make sure to take a lot of pictures with his ear down.  When my pups propped up permanently (at about 11-12 weeks) I was worried I didn't get enough of them.

admiralmandrake,fe5pytk,t3_enn11w,When I got my corgi puppy last year one of his ears was up and one was down.  One morning I did a double take in his pen and noticed his ear was standing up!  It only lasted five minutes but I was briefly disappointed that I didn't get enough pictures of him with his ear down.  Over the next few days I took a flurry of pics with him until his ear permanently stood up one day forever.  I still miss those days a little bit :(.  Except all the accidents.
spottedram,fe60i86,t3_enn11w,"This is the cutest thing I've seen all day. That expression, tucked in, ready for bedtime. Priceless."

jmrobinson18,fdr72ok,t3_emupou,What happened?!
LastDeadEYEZ,fdrafe1,t1_fdr72ok,A biggo raccoon got him😢
bubbleyum92,fdrx0on,t1_fdrafe1,"Holy fuck...thank you for saying this..we have HUGE raccoons in my neighborhood. My parents have corgis and I have yorkies but I was never super worried about the raccoons, especially around their not tiny corgis. But now I will definitely be worried and be cautious. Good lord."
vinsomm,fds9vnt,t1_fdrafe1,I watched my dads dog get mauled and killed by a raccoon when I was a kiddo. Devastating. This was a 70lb dog too.
spottedram,fdsyg0g,t1_fdrafe1,Jesus. Poor little doggo.  What a smile. Please give him a hug and treat for me.
God_Damnit_Nappa,fdt80d2,t1_fdrafe1,"Damn, I thought a raccoon wouldn't stand a chance against a corgi. That little guy is a trooper though."

LastDeadEYEZ,fdrxby5,t1_fdrx0on,U can never be too careful !!
deserrat713,fdsnnp3,t1_fdrx0on,"I think it is common for people to misjudge the raccoon, often seen as a comical burgler, or a ""trash panda,"" and even kept as a pet.  This creature is classified as a carnivore that will kill and eat anything it can catch.  Supple and liquid, they can squeeze into just about any enclosure to get at domestic animals. They're very cute, but they are killers, nonetheless, with a mouthful of some very wicked teeth. I have lost livestock, pets and aquatic creatures to raccoons so frequently that I really don't like them anymore."
yungmermaidlilariel,fdtscsk,t1_fdrx0on,I've seen a 70 ish pound dog messed up by raccoons. They're cute enough on reddit but many people seriously underestimate how vicious they can get.
spottedram,fdsylth,t1_fds9vnt,Yikes
pearlpursepills,fdvpkne,t1_fdt80d2,how would a corgi even stand a chance?
shader_m,fdsfb1t,t1_fdrxby5,"agreed. Raised a raccoon for a bit. Awfully strong for its size but he was very friendly and playful towards everyone, the dog and the cat. Wild raccoons? I stay the hell away.

Now Opossums, i wouldnt mind them being nearby more often. Not nearly as adorable, but a hell of a lot less dangerous in every way."
crashcanuck,fdtgaxa,t1_fdsfb1t,"Opossums also eat ticks, so if one lives nearby just leave them be."
pearlpursepills,fdvp66g,t1_fds4wvo,no
SenorPierre,fdsi8w6,t1_fdsi4qm,"opossums can't carry rabies.

edit: technically any mammal can but the chances of an opossum carrying it are ridiculously small."
God_Damnit_Nappa,fdt7coh,t1_fdsoq4r,[Ya well the Humane Society says you're wrong](https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/what-do-about-opossums)
TheWoodsman5,fdsr32q,t1_fdsoq4r,"You can't disagree with a fact lmao it's not an opinion. Their low body temperature makes it nearly impossible for them to carry rabies. 

Just so with nearly any animal as well, if they're domesticated you won't have to worry about them having rabies unless they come into contact with it so don't generalize an entire species."
WikiTextBot,fdte4v8,t1_fdte3zt,"**Rabies**

Rabies is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the brain in humans and other mammals. Early symptoms can include fever and tingling at the site of exposure. These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms: violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and loss of consciousness. Once symptoms appear, the result is nearly always death.

gigglesmcbug,fdl4un7,t1_fdkchvu,"No.

I was in a car accident a while back. My foster dog was tied up in the back seat and my dog was in the front seat. The airbags went off and beat my dog up pretty well. He's never riding in the front again."
kwh11,fdkr73u,t1_fdkchvu,"Thank you, one solitary voice in the wilderness of these comments & upvotes!  It is NOT safe to drive with a dog in the front seat, and yes the airbag will assuredly kill the dog.  There are restraint systems for small and large dogs for use in the back seat.  All employ halters tied into locked seatbelts.  A dog this size can use an elevated car bed that allows him to sit or lie down & look out the window."

Perki15,fdl3gi4,t1_fdkr73u,I heard that kind of stuff happens but never really understood why. How doesn’t the airbag kill a human? Is it just a matter of size or is it the position?

TotalSolipsist,fdl5ozl,t1_fdl3gi4,"Some of both, plus properly installed airbags are carefully timed to blow at just the right moment to cushion a seatbelted human while minimizing potential injury. If that timing is off, it could seriously injure a human passenger, too.

athanathios,fdqazbl,t3_emck6g,"OMG that's the most precious baby ever, I got my corgi at 9 weeks and met her at 8, but this dumpling is so adorable!"
vinsomm,fdqb2v6,t1_fdqazbl,She was born on thanksgiving. She’s a bit smaller than the rest of her litter so the breeder is going to keep her until 10 weeks. I seriously cannot wait! She is also the niece of my corgi who passed away last year. So she’s already family ☺️
athanathios,fdqbam8,t1_fdqb2v6,"Awww that's so sweet, when I met my puppy she was more of the Alpha, but the wee baby loved us too and it was a hard choice, but I think this baby is totally perfect and will have a very loving home and a fantastic life. That's so great. I'm actually pumped for you, I remember getting my corgi pup, it was my first and she was above average sassiness, but it's been the best."
vinsomm,fdqbmkt,t1_fdqbam8,My last one was a spicy little bastard too! I miss her more than anything. More personality than most people lol
athanathios,fdqbtts,t1_fdqbmkt,"I know what you mean, our girl came to us with piss and vinegar, she  (as an 8 week old), stole her siblings food, overslept, then got up and ran around teasing them and playing, bit her mom on the butt for not playing and then ran around and went back to bed after the other tuckered out. She was and still is so great and very sassy, so I feel you. She didn't calm down until 9 months and now she's so sweet and expressive, even kisses. I know how sweet and sassy these corgis can be, I'm so happy you knew such love and such a great girl and you must have shared so much love and sweet moments, I myself have them daily, many times, so I'm happy yo knew that and I know this baby will have a fantastic life. I'm excited for you!"
spokchewy,fdp78pr,t3_emck6g,"Has to be a cardigan, right?"
vinsomm,fdp7jt0,t1_fdp78pr,"Her father was bred 4 generations back with cardigan, the mom is AKC pembroke. So absolutely some cardigan in there as technically the blue merle doesn’t show up in pembroke. The breeder breeds herding / horse farm corgis and isn’t necessarily concerned with what AKC consideres “correct” as far as the division of breeds go. She does some pure bread pembrokes - as well as this little ones father who has a tad bit of blue merle in him. This particular litter only had one blue merle. She has a near identical coat to my Aussie and is also the niece to my full bred Pembroke that passed away last year. So correct! She has trace heritage of cardigan but mostly pembroke.

*fun fact about the breeder. She has an annual “corgi family reunion” on her horse farm and people from all over the country come and the corgis play all day. It’s a really special thing and she is an incredibly amazing human."

konstantine8,fdiee6i,t1_fdidu5w,"He literally has to army crawl to get under it, too, like it’s not casual at all. Our old couch was a reclining one so didn’t have any space, when we got this one in November he just decided that was his place to hang out 😂"
mariaheam,fdiej4f,t1_fdiee6i,"Yea, I always wonder how he's gonna get his big booty under ours.  He kicks and struggles, and eventually gets it.  Can't be cozy!  Such goofballs!"
konstantine8,fdiesfg,t1_fdiej4f,Hahah I love it! They’re so funny and full of personality and quirks

She also likes to hide under there when it's bath time."

Lolomary,fdlqv2y,t1_fdlpar8,She doesn’t like the feeling of rain. She does better on walks in the rain with it on.
bartmaniv,fdm8fq4,t3_elvuvq,"Man,Maggie loves water, if there is one puddle she heads for it & loves rain- thunder not too much.
Rooney is beautiful,, thanks for. Answering my. Question"
Lolomary,fdm939m,t1_fdm8fq4,Rooney loves puddles too! And is ok in the bath until I put water on her so I’m thinking it’s water being “splashed or poured” on her. She’s a picky little pup haha
bartmaniv,fdn6nxn,t3_elvuvq,"Yes, she is,, have fun!"

Thaun84,fea9osu,t3_eo9ekm,As a Corgi owner it's almost a chore to bring my dog for a walk. You can hear the squeals coming from a mile awat. Everyone wants to rob the handsome fella. Nevermind the late night walks when the drunkies are out and about.
Poot-dispenser,feaa82c,t1_fea9osu,You sound just like my dad about the “watch out for late night drunks” part
helicopter_corgi_mom,fecqns1,t1_fea9osu,"i remember being in my pjs, taking my corgi out for her last bathroom of the night, and (i live above a bar) we walked by a table of very drunk girls outside and i hear the squeal - turn into many - and the key words “cute” and “corgi”.  if there’s one thing my girl has, it’s a keenly tuned ear for the specific range of squeals that come from 20-something year old women, who she knows will fawn over her like she deserves. she immediately plants as i’m trying to hustle past, and pulls me with all 28 yearning-to-be-adored pounds of corgi might and drug me back to the table of drunk women. where i then had to make awkward conversation about my dog to a group that was many cocktails in. She was, of course, in dog heaven."
