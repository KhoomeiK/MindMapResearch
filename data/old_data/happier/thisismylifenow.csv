Does he heal at the same subjective rate as normal? Does some aspect of him permanently stay outside the flow of time?

So hockey washrooms/showers are often shared between two dressing rooms. Ice times and rooms are staggered enough that *most* of the time you’re not actively sharing with the other room anyway.

My teammate and I were the last two showering and he thought it would be funny to take my towel and lock me in, forcing me to go through the other dressing room and down the hall naked to get to our room. It’s a fairly common prank. Anyways, he didn’t know the other room was locked as well and he decided to go home, so I was left in this bathroom and I knew we were the last ice time of the night. I was banging on the door yelling for help and my biggest fear was that soon the lights would go out for the night and I’d be stuck there. It took almost an hour for a rink attendant closing up to hear me and let me out.

Needless to say I was pissed and called the teammate and he was like “oh shit! Hahaha didn’t know the other room was locked lol. I’ll bring you a Gatorade next time for your troubles”...."

Additionally, these bulbs seem to be high intensity discharge type bulbs. These are extremely energy efficient (rivaling LEDs), but take several MINUTES to warm up to full brightness.

Finally, leaving the lights on has security benefits. Police can glance in the windows while driving by, and see if there's anyone inside.

Much of my team decided to work from home, but I didn't have the set up to do so comfortably.

The motion sensor was at the entrance to a hallway, about 100 feet away from my desk. I ended up finding some long ethernet cable, taping some paper to it and routing it over the lights to my desk. This way, if the lights went off, I had a ""light switch"" that I could just tug to turn it back on."

Basically you walk into Red Lobster on a stormy Wednesday evening. You sit down with your wife and two kids. The waiter comes by to take your order as you hungrily ask for the endless shrimp.

15 minutes later everybody is served. Your wife and kids ordered the endless shrimp as well. As the night morphs into inky blackness outside you all talk and laugh and eat. You eat plate after plate after plate of shrimp. After a couple hours, you and your family are stuffed. You motion to the waiter to bring the bill and look down at your plate, letting out a small chuckle. It looks like you haven't even eaten a single bit of shrimp- a curious thing since you have been gorging yourself on shrimp constantly for the better part of two hours. But before you can puzzle over this small oddity any longer, the waiter bustles over to your table and hands you the bill.

As you reach over to grab the check your hand closes instead around a squishy pile of shrimp. There is no check being held out to you, just another plate of shrimp. A loud thunderclap booms outside as you look up at the waiter to ask why he brought you more shrimp instead of the check, when you are suddenly alarmed to find not the waiter, but a giant, human-sized shrimp in server attire staring blankly down at you. You spin around in your seat to see if your wife can see the shrimp waiter and are immediately frightened out of your wits. Your wife is no longer seated there next to you- only another human-sized shrimp wearing your wife's dress and hoop earrings.

Numb with horror, you quickly glance across the table at your two children. They are both shrimps. You let out a yell as another thunderclap echoes across the sky and it begins to rain. You distantly register the start of the torrential downfall outside, which sounds like large hail, as you spare a sweeping glance across the restaurant. There are no humans present. There are only shrimps seated at booths, shrimps seated at tables, and even a small group of shrimps at the bar. They are all eating large platefuls of shrimp and leering at you menacingly.

Your heart begins to pound in your chest like a war drum. You stumble backwards, half falling over your chair in your haste to get up. You sprint for the door and run outside into the dark stormy night. As you dash through the parking lot towards your car you feel something like a giant hot raindrop hit your face and bounce off towards the ground. Looking down you see a shrimp lying on the ground. You look out across the parking lot and see puddles of shrimp collecting in the cracks in the pavement and across the roofs of the closest cars. Another warm object strikes your head. It's literally raining shrimp.

You find your car and fumble, hands shaking uncontrollably, with your keys. Finally unlocking the car you slip inside and engage the door locks. The human-sized shrimp from the restaurant are now congregating outside the front doors, staring across the parking lot at you. Their pale orange-pink bodies eerily backlit from the light streaming out from the open doors behind them.

You try to cram the key into the ignition, but it folds against the ignition plate and squishes in your hand. You look down. There are no car keys, only several mangled shrimp on a keyring in your trembling hand. You punch the steering wheel in frustration accidentally setting off the car alarm.

The shrimps outside the restaurant hear the noise and hungrily start to advance across the parking lot towards you. You try in vain to cram the shrimp key into the ignition but you know it is pointless.

The shrimp slowly approach the car and surround it, rocking it back and forth, pressing their slimy bodies against the frame. You hear the fiberglass doors groan under the pressure as one of the rear windows shatters, spraying the backseat of the car with fragments of glass.

You know there is no hope left. There is no escape. White-faced and shaking, you reach across the console and open the glovebox. Crammed under the insurance papers and a pile of napkins is the Glock 19 you always bring with you when you leave the house. You pull the gun from its holster and pause for a fraction of a second that holds an eternity. With tears streaming down your face, you put the gun to the roof of your mouth. Trying not to imagine what it feels like to die, only forcing yourself to think of your wife and kids you close your eyes. Then you pull the trigger.

A singular shrimp comes zooming out of the barrel into your mouth. In your darkest hour, death itself refuses to end you. For death is not the end. There can only be shrimp- and they are endless."
southwoodhunter,fe9l387,t1_fe7k9i1,"This reminds me of my favorite Patton Oswalt routine:

At Black Angus, we’ll start you off with our appetizer platter, featuring five jumbo deep fried gulf shrimp, served on a disk of salted butter, with 15 of our potato bacon bombs and a big bowl of pork cracklins with our cheese and butter dippin’ sauce. “

Your like, um we’re all gonna split that…

“Awe, you’ll each get your own!”

“Then well take you to our mile long soup and salad bar featuring bacon and cheese cream soup and our five head of ice burg lettuce He-Man salad, served in a punch bowl with 18 pounds of ranch dressing, pork stuff deep fried croutons and, what the hell, a couple of corn dogs.”

Uh, hey man, I tell you what, I’ll just get like a mixed green salad.


“Hey, I’ll suck a cock on the Golden Gate Bridge before I bring you a mixed green buddy.”

I.. what? I?

“Then we’ll wheel out our bottomless trough of fried dough.”

Wait a minute, am I getting a steak?

“Oh you’ll get a fucking steak. Cause then we’ll bring out our 55 ounce Lost Mesa, He-Man steak slab, served with a deep fried pumpkin, stuffed with buttered scallops and 53 of our potato bacon bombs.”

Oh dude, I don’t think…

Police only get called if no managers on the list answer, or you punch the panic codes into the alarm system. Firemen, on the other hand, get called automatically, but you can expect a call from the alarm company to call the firemen off, if you want. Much fewer false alarms for fire, and much greater risk for loss of life or product.

So I drove all the way back (I was probably only 10 minutes out) unlocked the building, went upstairs to look, and there was some guy wearing headphones listening to music working out. I had to kick him out and then lock everything up and go home. He completely did not hear any of my gym closing announcements because of his music and he didn't care that everyone else was leaving.

im a certified pool operator. there can be some legal repercussion over not managing a pool properly, their kinda a night mare of rules. i would flip on who ever was in charge. like id honestly want their job.  im typically all for supporting my co workers but having someone actually in the fucking pool when you locked the doors? holy shit. imagine if someone drowned and you found them in the morning. my pool is life guard on duty all the time so i dont even fucking understand that.  


also, if they managed to ""Clean"" the pool deck with out having anyone notice hey theres a guy swiming, like wtf? not to mention the locker rooms. just so much wtf were you doing. idk the set up maybe they come in the back door but theres a buncha bacteria and viral issues with pools you need to stay ontop of.

They get almost zero foot traffic after those huge buildings nextdoor close up shop, so they do too. Really dumb if you ask me.

ChopUpTheBeatsKanye,fdic706,t3_elgk97,"This video has a really melancholy back story, but I can’t retell it because I can’t remember it fully.

I think it was something about these being two sisters that had just lost another sister not long ago. While the late sister was still alive, she told them she’d give them a sign after dying, involving cardinals. This is the reason for the emotional reaction that they had upon the cardinal coming back.

Edit: /u/ItsSatineActually corrected some of the mistakes I made regarding the context of the video

“It’s actually two sisters who lost their mother. The shorter lady in the purple shirt is my best friend’s mom. Grandma’s favorite bird was a cardinal, and a few days after her death, one flew and hit the window. They went out to see if it was okay, BFF’s mom puts her hand out and it hopped on, and wouldn’t leave.”"
3lmusic,fdif8q4,t1_fdic706,"This is a trip, this video caught my eye because of the cardinal. My grandpa had a thing for them and told my family that he would be visiting as cardinals when he passed. I see them all the time and it makes me think of him, then I saw this comment and have this facination with synchronicity and it was this whole crazy moment. Anyway thought Id share. Very heartwarming. But Im kinda sad now. Lol."

Iz-Grizzy,fdjg4f4,t3_elgk97,"Last summer I found a robin chick lying on the pavement outside my house with both of its wings unable to move, and unable to stand up. It had apparently fallen out of its nest which was at least 30 to 40 feet in the air.
So being the big softie I am I took the bird in fed it with a syringe, made a bed for him to sleep in, and monitoring his recovery. This carried on for at least two and a half weeks, for which I named it Birdie Sanders, because of its really wild feathers around its head making him look like Bernie Sanders. Which unfortunately doing this was a mistake because while trying to teach him how to fly, it always kept gliding and landing back on me whenever I tossed him up in the air.I think he at some point thought of me as his mother or something. 

Eventually he did manage to fly away but out of the hundreds of times I tossed him in air, he always flew back. 

I hope he's doing well now..."

He took a foot long piece of scotch tape, and stuck it to his shirt repeatedly until it was barely sticky. He then announced, ""Hey look!"" to get everyone's attention, then said ""Lowrider cat!"" and put the unstickied tape down his cat's spine.

The cat crouched down, trying to slowly walk under the tape on his back. Lowrider cat, indeed.

He then took the tape off, and gave the kitty some love. It didn't seem to mind too much."

iLiveInAHologram94,fdpkfl3,t1_fdpkc6x,Lol not the same exact just the similarities made me laugh! I’ve had my boy for three months now! He really enjoys being held like that
MohammadBashirSidani,fdpklgq,t1_fdpkfl3,"But i really need to ask you, does he still bite? Mine is a bitch when he wants to bite. He'll search for the most painful point and sqeeze from his heart whenever I'm returning him to cage etc.. Love him to pieces though"
iLiveInAHologram94,fdply5q,t1_fdpklgq,"Yes and no...so there are two groups of biting in my opinion. One would be fear and anger and the other group: want and don’t want biting. When the bird is new to you ive heard that you’re not supposed to react to the bite, to take it. Because if they’re still afraid or territorial and angry then they will bite to get you away from them. Only once the bird is bonded to you, which judging from your picture you definitely are bonded friends, you can react to their bites by yelling in pain and distress even exaggerating and take away your attention from the bird. Turn around, or walk away or move the bird another few feet away. If they are bonded to you then birds crave your attention. Needy conures in my experience at least. My bird was FRANTIC to make things right with me and had to LEARN the strength of his own beak. So in part that may be one issue at play here. 

My GCC is a baby at 10 months old and I found he gets over tired and cranky and more likely to bite when he’s been out for awhile and that takes my noticing how long he’s been out and even though he doesn’t want to go in and rest, I have to put him in. He’s been overstimulated. 

Anotherrr thing in the same vein as this is my little guy is VERY excitable and sometimes he gets so excited he forgets himself and nibbles too hard. And sometimes bites out of being in a frenzy of excitement. So the key is to notice what’s got him so excited and not to expose him to that all at once. 

Also because he’s a baby, he’s very nibbly and curious about everything and would bite me a lot due to being nibbly, curious, excited and overstimulated or some convo of those. The key to that problem was to hold a toy and whenever he starts getting bitey, sub in the toy right away. If he gets you, act upset and in pain AND take away your attention to him. Sometimes I put him back in his cage when he bites or move him far from me and tell him “bye bye”. He hates going bye bye now. 

Also, for putting him back, I’m having a bit of the same problem. There are a few things I would do: one I would try to have your bird do a simple trick or two (like stepping up onto your finger) and praise the heck out of him then put him in. Try to make going into his cage a positive experience. Two I use a mini wooden perch to put him back when he’s being very naughty and biting. Three sometimes I bribe him in with a nutriberry or food. Four I wait until he’s at the end of my hand then tuck my hand under my arm or roll it up into my sleeve so he couldn’t get to it and then put him and my arm into his cage with a perch at his feet and slowly pull my arm out until he has nothing to stand on but the perch in front of him. That was kinda tough to explain hopefully the fourth point made sense. 

I honestly thought I had brought home a little velociraptor at first. We had bonded but he liked to sit on me and just gnaw away on my fingers. Since doing all this and realizing his own limits too and his age is a huge factor aaaaand working with or against what he wants has been HUGE. he doesn’t bite me anymore and we’ve grown closer for it."

thesweetestberry,fe2mfjx,t3_enh696,Kids mistreating animals is not cute.
runslowalot,fe2r3em,t1_fe2mfjx,"I agree and it places the animal in terrible position. First the pup has to endure mistreatment, and second, there’s a huge safety risk that the pup will act out as a knee jerk reaction to pain."
ErrantWeiner,fe2rthr,t1_fe2r3em,Yep and then get euthanized as a “dangerous animal.” SMH.
thesweetestberry,fe2xnl0,t1_fe2tehp,"I saw this quite awhile ago and think it helps here. I don’t think your kid is abusing your dog in the way they society worries  about, but consider this:

“To the people who say kids come first and it's the animal's fault if they lash out, think of this:  An animal can only learn so much. It relies heavily on its instincts, and dogs rely on their ""pack-mentality"". Yes, it is important to train your animals, but human children have MUCH more ""training"" potential. They are people, and can learn with repetition. TO expect an animal to learn like your child or act like a human is really expecting too much. I know, I may not be able to control an animal, but my son, I can.  It doesn't matter if the child ""doesn't know better"" or if they have ""zero impulse control"". YOU have to BE their impulse control until they can do it for themselves. You wouldn't let your kid break a glass or touch fire because he ""doesn't know better"", would you? Well, animals can also be dangerous and must be repected.  My son, one year, has NEVER been allowed to torment our 3 cats. Learning how to handle animals has been taught to him ever since he was able to crawl. We taught him the word ""gentle"" by taking his hand and showing him how to pet them. Whenever he would get excited and grab a chunk of hair, I would make him let go and say, ""No! You have to be gentle, gentle.""  Also, I forbid him from bothering the cats while they are sleeping or eating (this is for my son's safety, too-animals can lash out while they are eating or surprised). Sure, it means he cries sometimes when I pick him up and tell him, ""No kitty, kitty is eating"".  Bottom line, you have to get physically involved, just like if he was hurting a person. If he pulls hair or ears, actually take his hands firmly and tell him no. If he insists on chasing the dog, PICK HIM UP and remove him, put him in time out if necessary. It's a limit, just like any other. Now, my son IS ""gentle"" when I say the word. Sure, he still needs reminding now and then, but it works, try it. The end result is a kinder, gentler child who respects living things AND who has less of a chance being mauled by an animal because he never learned how to behave around them.  It should have started as soon as he was mobile. At 18 months it's going to be much harder.   Kindness and sensitivity toward lesser creatures is a virtue, it's a shame some of you don't feel that way. Perhaps you should not have animals with your children.”

You wouldn’t allow an animal 3-4 times the weight of your child to sit on your child’s head and bark. It also wouldn’t be ok to allow an adult human to do what your child is doing. It’s “cute” because you think it’s cute that your child is doing it to your dog. I think it’s mistreatment. I don’t think I am alone here. My parents always had a dog and we were trained to respect animals. I am tired of seeing this stuff and parents thinking it’s cute. 

Your kid is not learning boundaries with animals. By teaching the child how to interact worth your dog, you will be teaching it how to interact with all dogs. If the kid does this to another dog, let’s say a friend of the family’s dog,  and gets bit, who gets in trouble?"
DontmindthePanda,fe2pe3q,t3_enh696,"This is the perfect situation to teach your daughter boundaries and respecting other beings, human or not.

I mean, how is there a good outcome of this for the dog? The best he can hope for is for her to stop. The worst is showing displeasure, your daughter not reacting and him doing, what dogs do in this situation. Which will harm your daughter and probably end your doggos life."
