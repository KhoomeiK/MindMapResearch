dropitlikeafad,en400o,top_level,"I like comparing it to a skill tree in a game, except in this case, it constantly updates and modifies itself. Our brain is like a machine housing experiences, and those are ultimately what are going to dictate what you're aware of in the world and how wide your POV of the world is. It's like your processing capabilities will evolve based on how relevant the info is to your lived experience.

Some quick ways to expand your POV and evolve your processor (your brain)?

- Moving out
- Experiencing a different culture (travelling somewhere new and working there for a while).
- Reaching your peak natural body's physical fitness (you can imagine what it's like to be fit, but nothing compares to the actual experience of full body fluidity)
- Some people purposely suffer but I don't recommend it. Going through discomfort is definitely a way to grow though depending on the situation and your end goal.
etc. 

Your time in this world is limited. Be wise with how you gain your experiences because it will ultimately decide what level of awareness you have of reality.

You can choose to stay at a lower awareness and just exist though. Nothing wrong with that either. Ignorance is bliss. It depends what you want."
corntriangle,fdubuxk,t3_en400o,Super true. I‚Äôve tried to adopt a mindful ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù mentality re: taking risks and getting out of my comfort zone. It‚Äôs helped me grow immensely.
takas_,fdw6mt9,t1_fdubuxk,what kind of discomforts and risks?
HMWMAA1012,fdwlzw0,t1_fdw6mt9,"I can‚Äôt guarantee that I can answer for corntriangle, but off of what I know from my own experience and other‚Äôs, it depends on the person. If you commented so you could learn how to grow as a person, just do whatever makes you uncomfortable. If you don‚Äôt like to try new activities, see what sounds interesting and don‚Äôt give into the fear. Don‚Äôt like meeting new people? Go do something you‚Äôll enjoy that will have a ton of people attending and go try to talk. There‚Äôs a good chance it‚Äôll feel awkward for a while, but the only way to get better is to try, and trying often meaning failing, but that‚Äôs the only way to grow."
im595126,fdzr54z,t1_fdwlzw0,"A cold shower FUCKING WORKS. Read up about it online but it worked for me and everyone around me, it has changed us in such a positive way. Its a natural stressor for your body unlike alot of the nornal stress we go through such as work life and other random things like that. Make sure to take deep breaths in and out though and just know that our bodies and mind are more powerful than you think."
nvo14,fdvy4gk,t3_en400o,"Thank you very much for sharing this! The points you described are great ways to put yourself into a position to gain a broader view.

May I add one more quick way to expand your POV: **ask people for feedback**! In my opinion, the easiest way to expand your own view is through a dialogue with other people and their POVs.

**Have a look at the post** ""Ask everyone for feedback"" in the subreddit **HabitExchange**, which describes very well how you can develop a habit to continuously learn from your environment through feedback.

**The big advantage:** other methods loose their impact after some time. You can only move out once, you can only travel a certain amount of countries, but getting to know people and asking them about their POV gives you unlimited opportunities."

Cicute,fdwbcak,t3_en400o,"I really like the ""skill tree"" approach! I have a hard time thinking about my life/self improvement as progression and tend to spread myself thin, but that instantly gave me a better appreciation of how making progress in one goal can ""unlock"" the next step in addition to giving its own benefits.

Thanks for that :) I might redesign my process around that framing."
starsinpurgatory,fdw04il,t3_en400o,"I agree. Though my relatively negative experiences have made me slow to trusting people‚Äôs intentions, so that‚Äôs unfortunate. I don‚Äôt open up/warm up to new people that easily because of it."
lightning_head,fe0agy7,t1_fdw04il,I used to feel this way too from years of trauma and abuse but I gave up on it and it was the best thing I did for myself. Now I almost never let my past experiences dictate how I will interact with others even if I feel like they've lived a privileged life. You never really know another person's lived experiences.
tamar,fdyiw1a,t3_en400o,"I didn't purposely suffer but I was in an intensely abusive relationship that made me into a significantly better person. Sometimes we don't choose but it just happens. The element of choice comes in during the recovery, if we just let it eat at us emotionally or become better people for it. I chose the latter.

We might suffer tragedy, hardship, loss, etc. and it is no fault of our own. But our response and how we internalize it is completely in our control. Choose those responses wisely. Because sometimes we can't choose what happens to us."

It's one life, whatever I do is this time only. This moment is never gonna happen again. No one's gonna remember what happened after few years down the line. So live the life to fullest. Why should we cry for silly things. We are a just a spark of life in this vast endless universe. So make it count and live life. So when you die you could say that yes I lived my life satisfied.

Most people fear to live. The only thing that I fear and you should is ""regret"". Grab ""whatever"" is holding you back by its throat.

lucidible,fdqou47,t3_emcv1k,"First off, you've taken the hardest step which is getting off your ass.  Contgratulations!   The key to success at this point is to realize that discouragement and self-doubt are normal and not signs that you are on the wrong track.  You'll have good days and bad days and the key is to persevere through the latter.    The same bravery you've shown by posting here is the same bravery that will get you through those bad days.  So you've already shown you have what it takes.

I would also suggest that you see if there are any meetup groups in the area.  The bigger, the better so you feel more anonymous as that makes it easier to be a fly on the wall rather than have a lot of attention put on yourself when you're not ready for it.  They often have people present things and that could spur ideas for what you want to look into.     When you are ready to decloak, they are pretty uniformly super supportive as well.   People who go through the trouble of starting a meetup group are usually passionate about the topic and also somewhat outgoing which is a good combination for someone like you to seek advice from.   Kind of reddit in real life."

InfinitePayment,fe7opyt,t1_fe6iw0b,"Study less, study smart is the main thesis of the book. From then on it's full of actionable tips. 

* Schedule every minute of the day, including rest and entertainment. 
* Find places in campus that you won't be distracted - especially by peers - for studying during the day; have fun during the evenings. No, your dorm isn't a study room. 
* Write essays in three days: research, draft, edit. 
* Active recall trumps passive review for both understanding concepts and memorization. This means explaining out loud, without looking at notes, everything that you need to know. 
* Passive methods like highlighting or re-reading textbook and notes are complete waste of time. 
* Set actionable study goals. e.g. ""I will do active recall on chapter 3 of organic chemistry from 9 am to 10 am tomorrow at this library"" instead of vaguely stating ""I will study (never use the word ""study"") tomorrow."" Since active recall is efficient but very mentally taxing, plan short study sessions with breaks in-between. 
* For skill-based courses like math and physics, solving questions that are similar to exam questions is the most efficient active form of learning. 

EDIT: Previous comment got removed. I suggest checking out Cal Newport's old blog archives."

Nothing more. I'm tired of being measured by a yardstick which prizes only ambitious careers. I can buy myself a house by thirty; isn't that enough? Why the fuck do I have to want to start a business or be a doctor or a manager or the CEO someday? Why doesn't it matter that I'd hate every single one of those things? I'm so tired of hustle and grind culture. All I ever wanted to do was to write books and make art within a small happy life, and I turned my back on both of those things for a sensible, long-term job, because it is not possible to make a living writing books or making art in 90% of cases, and certainly not where the COL is as high as it is where I live.

I don't think there is anything wrong with your POV by any means.

I personally am going to try for an ambitious career. But not just for the sake of having one but because there are things that I am passionate about and want to spend my life attempting and hopefully changing for the better. I would like to change the face of mental health care. 

I honestly agree with you and don't really see the utility in having an ambitious career just for the sake of having an ambitious career. But at the same time who the hell am I to tell them how to live their life? Just like I would never tell you how to live your life, I wouldn't want to tell them either. It's their life. If that's how they want to spend it, then I say go for it and congratulate them on doing so as long as they're not hurting anyone else."

Yes, it causes me anxiety, but not for the reason you think."
Red_Health_Potion,fe5yvr5,t1_fe5vqfk,My point is living your life as you are is fine. You don't seem alright with it though - you are literally on self-improvement commenting. It would be like me going on a reddit about public speaking saying that I don't need to know how to speak in public.

humble1989,fe78su4,t1_fe52wi1,"Yes, this book was the catalyst for a life changing perspective shift for me too."
Jeremy____,fe4xuuv,t1_fe4t9po,"Sort of. It's more of a guide on how to be the kind of person that people want to be friends with. It doesn't provide a magic solution on how to pretend to be an extrovert or anything like that.

It has a focus on changing the way that you view and interact with others. In fact, as I was reading it, I didn't really learn anything ""new"". I found myself saying, ""well duh!"", quite a bit. But seeing all these things together forced me to look at them in aggregate. And when viewed as an aggregate, you see how everything impacts your ability to win friends and influence people.

There are many things you can take away from reading it, and I only took 2 things; genuinely care about the people around you. Don't just pretend, actually care. MAKE them important to you. And always offer encouragement. I offer encouragement and praise every opportunity I get; not flattery, I offer genuine praise when they deserve it. I never let an interaction go by without a compliment or a question that shows I care about their life. Those 2 things have changed how people interact with me. People enjoy seeing me walk in their direction because they know they'll have an enjoyable conversation. Those conversations lead to friendships all the time.

If you're interested in reading it, I'd suggest buying the updated version, how to win friends and influence people in the digital age. Same book, updated terminologies and stuff.

EDIT: Re-commented since I added the amazon link to the book in my other comment and it got removed for being in violation of rule #2 :/"
Sjourn,fe4m4s6,t1_fe3ynmo,"OP, I highly discourage driving while doing dishes."
OkTemporary0,fe55ihi,t1_fe54ufq,Sounds like a great idea. I planned on taking the book everywhere I go as much as I can to kind of have as a reminder and a reference if need be in certain situations.

HypridElastiAccord27,fe5uo9v,t1_fe54ufq,"Thats a good idea and wise mindset. How can you consider yourself completely changed and improved with one book? Being that changing and self improvement is a life long process, how could you say your life was changed or even changed completely by one book?"

ProfessorCarter,fe5w4s8,t1_fe5ucvi,I studied them in college
pabhu5,fe6ipxr,t1_fe5w4s8,that's amazing! what age did u start learning them and did u learn them all through college courses or through other methods as well. This is one of my life's goals so very interested in ur answer / more info if ur okay with sharing!
ProfessorCarter,fe8xt3i,t1_fe6ipxr,"I started taking French my sophomore year of high school, I think I was 14ish. Took that for three years, then took two years in community college. Was planning on being a French and English teacher. Then I transferred to a university and read Gulliver‚Äôs Travels the summer before I moved. Decided I wanted to learn more languages so I could have adventures like Gulliver, so I signed up for Spanish and Arabic. My second semester I studied abroad in France for 6 months. I had studied French for 5 years at this point, so the study abroad really took me to the next level as I had a solid foundation in grammar and linguistics. When I returned to home, I continued taking all three languages simultaneously for four years. At the end of my university, I studied abroad in Egypt for six weeks. It was incredible. Definitely had adventures like Gulliver had, except without the giants and the tiny civilisations. I was very invested and self-motivated so I studied A LOT, but it was very helpful to have the formal instruction so I could learn the rules of the languages and get real-time feedback. Language classes are held every day, unlike other disciplines where you go twice a week. I now run a Middle Eastern restaurant where I use all my languages from time to time with guests and employees. As part of my employment, I get to take a trip abroad each year to get new recipe ideas. Last year I went to Morocco and it was fabulous! I was supposed to go to Turkey this year, but I got injured and have to recover from surgery.

My study advice: 
- Study for 30-60 minutes at least every day. Take one or two days off each week to let your brain rest.
- Create a specific environment when you study. Learning French? Put on French music or talk radio in the background, have a certain smell available that connects you to the language (coffee, sweets, a candle or incense,etc). This helps trigger your memory.
- Since I was learning multiple languages, I color coded my folders, notebooks and highlighters. Everything Arabic was purple, French was orange, and Spanish was green. Helped my brain switch gears.
- Find a way to ask questions to native speakers. Face to face is even better.
- I'm a hands-on learner, so I recommend writing everything down by hand. Typing is faster, but hand writing really cements it in your brain. You think about it more, and you always learn better from experience. Autocorrect, even in the target language, will handicap you by making you rely on it. Only rely on your brain. Write vocab words repeatedly. Use them in full sentences that you write down. Have an instructor check your work, then rewrite your mistakes as full sentences.

That's all I can think of for now, but I'm happy to answer other questions! Bonne chance!"

Dogas-Z,fe4ywy2,t1_fe4l2lb,"Man, let me give you a story concerning that book. It was summer in Croatia 2017 when I was finishing it, and at that time I had a little heartbreak since my best friend met the girl, which I had a crush on, and after meeting her once he scored better than I did trying almost half a year. So I am pretty devastated but I kept reading this damn book. The winter before that I finished Siddartha, from which I then knew how to read Steppenwolf. So without spoiling anything here but it made me realize the biggest flaws in my life and what a Harry Haller I was. This realization instantly messed with my mind so much that I developed unbearable social anxiety, shame, and depression. I couldn't go out of my house without talking to my inner Harry in front of a mirror bathed in cold sweat and wanting to get to the paradise of poets. Well, Siddartha stuck in the back of my head and I then and there realized why this son of a bitch got 2 Nobel Prices ( i believe and like to believe it's two) for his works. Then and there my persona made a full circle and I realized it was okay being a shitty shit person as long as you know how shitty you are and want to change it. So being a Steppenwolf is not a state to stay in forever, but more a process that is necessary to develop oneself.   
I am also very excited to see that there are people who genuinely see the value in his books. What experiences did you have with Hesse?"
Dogas-Z,fe6x4ge,t1_fe6iokv,Okay added that to my to-read-list. Thank you a lot:)

Blue-Paladin,fe9ibhe,t1_fe6kkgi,"I came across Alan before I found his book, but it ,more or less, says the same things as the videos online. He gets into free will, inadequacies of language, spirituality without religion. Altogether, I think it‚Äôs the most important book I‚Äôve read and I still have to reread it. I‚Äôd give up an awful lot to have been there for his lectures. Here‚Äôs a passage that I‚Äôve shared here once before:


We must here make a clear distinction between belief and faith, because, in general practice, belief has come to mean a state of mind which is almost the opposite of faith. Belief, as I use the word here, is the insistence that the truth is what one would ‚Äúlief‚Äù or wish it to be. The believer will open his mind to the truth on the condition that it fits in with his preconceived ideas and wishes. Faith, on the other hand, is an unreserved opening of the mind to the truth, whatever it may turn out to be. Faith has no preconceptions; it is a plunge into the unknown. Belief clings, but faith lets go. In this sense of the word, faith is the essential virtue of science, and likewise of any religion that is not self-deception.

[‚Ä¶]

The present phase of human thought and history ‚Ä¶ almost compels us to face reality with open minds, and you can only know God through an open mind just as you can only see the sky through a clear window. You will not see the sky if you have covered the glass with blue paint.

But ‚Äúreligious‚Äù people who resist the scraping of the paint from the glass, who regard the scientific attitude with fear and mistrust, and confuse faith with clinging to certain ideas, are curiously ignorant of laws of the spiritual life which they might find in their own traditional records. A careful study of comparative religion and spiritual philosophy reveals that abandonment of belief, of any clinging to a future life for one‚Äôs own, and of any attempt to escape from finitude and mortality, is a regular and normal stage in the way of the spirit. Indeed, this is actually such a ‚Äúfirst principle‚Äù of the spiritual life that it should have been obvious from the beginning, and it seems, after all, surprising that learned theologians should adopt anything but a cooperative attitude towards the critical philosophy of science."

qKrfKwMI,fe6rwwo,t1_fe6dov6,"The biggest thing is that I was always portraying myself ""better"" than I really was, never showing any vulnerability and therefore I never felt close to anyone, not even my parents or best friends. This isn't even dating (with which I still haven't made much progress), it's basic interpersonal relationships.

Second was that I spent my life caring way too much about what others think, despite not even knowing their opinion. This part is closer to ""not giving a fuck"": if you want to do something, don't let others (implicitly) hold you back. And saying what you think instead of what you think others want to hear builds confidence.

One big reason why I have Models and Subtle Art tied is because Models is more focused, which makes it more concrete and easier to apply. Subtle Art is more abstract but when I reread it, my experiences since the last time I read it make it feel like a totally different book."
getstartedbeef,fe2n5ey,t3_eno12m,"Probably not a super unique answer.. but Harry Potter actually did some wonders for me. I had read them when I was a kid, and watched all the movies a few times in my life, but never revisited the books until much later in my life. I had just turned 29 and went through each book via audiobook. 

It's not a self help book or anything, but it definitely was inspiring and entertaining. I guess my point in this response is you may find help in odd places. Listen to other responses to this thread, maybe just explore r/books and find something there too."

Im just saying negative or positive, don't let other people define who you are or what you do. You should be the only one who is talking to yourself inside your head. Not some other person's voice. You do you and eventually you will know yourself better and start to see who you really are."

But ""The Law of Attraction"" by Esther Hicks was key for me. I know I know, law of attraction, how awful, blah blah. But the techniques themselves have more to do with the mindset behind cognitive therapy in my opinion. You obviously have to have a tolerance for new age stuff to handle Abe-Hicks (as they are known), but you don't actually have to agree with all of it. The same patterns apply to all the parts of life where attitude and mindset matter, even if you don't believe that attitude and mindset bring about Amazing Coincidences. It isn't just the book, but also their recordings--many of which are bootlegged on youtube right now--and also the exercises (aka processes) in the back of ""Ask and It Is Given."" There is a lot of material to potentially trawl through--I think when they talk about comparing the inner guidance to GPS, for navigating the emotional scale, that's some of the best. ""From Phoenix to Yuma..."" Anyway, Abe-Hicks taught me how to be a lot more efficient with my thoughts and emotions--not much wasting energy, churning, spinning wheels in the mud. And being more peaceful. Approaching problems with a practical yet absolutely positive perspective--this works better on stuff that isn't core stuff that I'm still stuck on. And there's much more that I can apply. There's really a lot there.

If you're going through a rough patch in life for sure read *Man's Search for Meaning.* Using the authors horrific traumatic experiences in the Holocaust as a great example of perseverance, it helped me work through my own trauma. Also bonus points for a very short read.

*The Unbearable Lightness of Being* and *The Stranger* are both books that were incredibly influential to my life philosophy. The first being a beautiful take on the aimless albeit enjoyable pursuits in life, the second is a take on the meaningless of life. Both deal with Existentialism which can be boiled down to the idea that life has no clear purpose other than that which we chose as being meaningful.

If you're finding yourself dwelling on what others thought of you back in highschool just always keep in mind that** the best revenge is living well**. Read more, do more, get curious about something, work on creating the life you want to live. After so many years doing that, any bad memories from the high school days start to fade more and more into the background. Hope you pick up one of these books soon and I hope the funk you find yourself in passes. Good luck."
Varggang,fe6q8bf,t3_eno12m,"Coming from someone who has read them all, all the fancy titles circulating the internet... Everything from the 40 laws of power, Meditations, Rich Dad/Poor Dad, 7 bla bla rules of highly bla bla, to the bible - **None. Taking action literally changed my life.**   
10 minute conversation with strangers at the buss stop/train station gave me more than 3 books written by the most successful motivators did.  
Books are great and all, but most of them do more harm than good, especially for introverted/social anxious people as the provide an escape, and also tend to give you rules and definitions of things you should define for yourself - Through exploration and real life experience.

The only thing that will really change your life is taking action and facing your deepest social fears. There is no getting around that. The sooner you break yourself down the faster you can rebuild.  


With that being said, if you are exploring certain things in real life then you could **combine that action with a book on that subject. Books work, but only if you do.**"

I also started rejecting self-improvement content that focuses on us *lacking* self-worth, *lacking* experience, *lacking* love, because self-improvement isn't about fixing what sucks but about improving what is already good enough.

GameStartCancel,emsm7k,top_level,"What's the difference? Being important means, you act in a way that pushes you further on your journey, not caring about how you look in the eyes of others. Looking important means, you have stuff that others can see and admire: your attractive career, car, spouse, house, body and so on. Everything that looks attractive and makes you look important in the eyes of others. 

# Am I not allowed to look important?

Hell no. It simply means that our focus is not on looking important, but on the things that make us important: Our skills, our mind, the work we do every day, and the value we create. Then, looking important will come automatically. Not because we strive for it, but because it is inevitable. Looking important is a side effect of being important.

If you want to look important, you are going to listen to your shadow calling, when no one is watching, because your actions are only motivated by the eyes of others. You are going to make poor decisions in the most crucial moments. If you want to be important, you are going to listen to your true calling, even when no one is watching, because your actions are only motivated by your own growth. You are going to make smart decisions in the most crucial moments, following your true calling. Use your compass to recognize the difference.

By changing this perspective, you manage to walk away from the expectations of others, following your own path, into the direction of your true calling. 

If you need more of this, just google **gamestartcancel**.

I will be glad to help you if you have more questions.

Have fun grinding :))"

I havent done my month long project with deadline day 2 days later. Nothing done. I just want rest. There are moments where I get excited and motivated but they disappear pretty quick. Im not depressed but just lack motivatuon to do anything
Edit: what* motivation*"
Nephilim20,fdr0t9h,t1_fdqyzog,Motivation is a bunch of bull. It‚Äôs very fleeting lasting only a few moments or maybe a little longer and then poof. Practice discipline so that when the motivation does die off(and it will. It always will) you can keep pushing forward. At least that is the perception that has helped me keep working towards my goals.
tlewallen,fdt81hw,t1_fdqyzog,Discipline != Motivation
InfinitePayment,fds1g9y,t1_fdqyzog,"That‚Äôs exactly what I thought before getting diagnosed for major depression and getting medicated. Even if you have reasons to believe you‚Äôre not depressed, I‚Äôd still suggest you talk to a professional to exclude it from possible root causes of your demotivation. It‚Äôs also possible you are persistently depressed, which is a lower level of depression that persists longer instead of being episodic like major depression."

tamim1991,fds7bkl,t1_fdr0t9h,"I feel that a lot dude. That's exactly what happened when I started a martial art (BJJ). A great deal of motivation before my first session and then it just went away only to be replaced by anxiety and looking for excuses just to skip classes. I realised the root of my anxiety before the class was to do with time, time away from my wife and how she will be, if she will get bored alone at home etc. Dissociating from my thoughts and just going to the class no matter is what kept me consistent - just being disciplined."
Nephilim20,fdv8h99,t1_fds1g9y,"I believed I suffered from depression for 25 years. Mostly due to a rough upbringing and my mother was a mess of mental health issues so it led me to believe that I naturally had to be as well. But in reality I was playing victim and not taking responsibility from my situations. When I realized this, everything changed. 

Now, I‚Äôm not saying that anyone here is doing the same. I know it‚Äôs a very real issue that some have to live with for life.Just putting it out there as food for thought. Depression can stem from a poor mindset and can be difficult to escape from. I got my escape 1.5 years ago and haven‚Äôt felt that way since. Depression is a fickle bitch no matter where it comes from. Take care my friends and good luck on your roads!"
bippybup,fdslfkw,t3_emsm7k,"One quote I really like is, ""Do important things and you'll be an important person."" I can't remember where I heard it unfortunately.

Anyways, I was thinking if you'd be up to do the ""30 days pot free challenge"" with me ? Like that we can keep ourselves accountable to eachother. Tell me what you think about the idea !"

Also kudos on you for not gatekeeping smoking because you can't do it. I've had too many people being ""can you not smoke because I don't want to?"", and I respect you for being a big enough person to make it with all the temptation around you"

dyingpie1,fe4bn2h,t1_fe0svdy,"You may think you didn't bat an eye, but you definitely thought to yourself that you want to get high. Maybe if not conciously, then subconsciously. You've lived so long getting high so much, your body is used to it. Being around others who use is difficult."

dyingpie1,fe4cgcs,t1_fe42j5d,"If you can't accept not smoking in front of someone then that's disrespectful. It's not about being a big enough person. It is extremely difficult for anyone who is quitting something they are addicted to not conciously or subconsciously think to themselves ""wow I wish I could use right now"" and the more you're around the substance, the more it becomes ingrained in your brain."
FroggyWatcher,fe5gtg2,t1_fe4cgcs,"I agree with you that it is disrespectful if it is an addiction. I didn't see the situation as an addiction sort of thing.

If I hang out with friends I usually smoke with but I can't/don't want to, I will just let them know. It's not disrespectful if I am okay with them doing it, though it might make it harder for me not to. Either way I want to hang out with them so I'm okay with it."

Ever since I found my love for the plant, my Youtube channel has become nearly idle. I'm just now getting back into uploading content because I have been smoking less because I can't afford the price of it anymore. It drains me of productivity and narrows my budget to where I can't buy new mics or other equipment for the channel. It's a temporary pleasure, puts you in an altered state of mind, which may or may not make you a little more creative."

No smoking until I‚Äôve completed everything I planned for the day. Simple as that. 

If I have to work, buy groceries and cook dinner, smoking can only happen after all three of these tasks have been completed. 

Helps reducing quantities and also not affect productivity."

MechanicalOwl117,fe312gx,t3_enh6bl,"Keep strong to stay off the stuff if you feel it is needed. Some people can handle using it responsibly and some cant. If your gut is telling you to stop, then listen. I am 31 and stopped smoking at 22 and can honestly see that my life and the quality of people around me have drastically improved. I have nothing against those who want to smoke but it was a eye opening and sad day when I decided to stop and my ""friends"" didn't deem it worth while to hang out with me since I didn't want to partake in smoking. I do note that I didn't try to make them stop and still didn't mind being around it. At one point I asked why I was not invited to chill and play videogames with my normal crew and unanimously everyone agreed that is wasn't worth me being there because I did't smoke anymore. Those people now are either still broke and going nowhere in life, in prison, or have dropped off the face of the earth into the unknown. 

On the flip side, one guy I know who smoked and still does - He is married of now 6 years, has 2 kids, and works in Accounting/Payroll as a Specialized Account Manager. We still speak from time to time and play chess online.

FuzzyChefisGod,elpgux,top_level,"I‚Äôm 17m and have been taking steps to be happy. I had a break thru the past few days

I‚Äôve really opened up to some people in my life about my mental health and my issues. It‚Äôs been hard to do but has kind of changed my whole meaning of life. When my friend learned I felt like I lived by a false identity and that ive been battling depression for 5 years now he broke. My friend who i didn‚Äôt know felt so strongly about our friendship told me how much I mean to him, and how he wants my life to be the best it can be. And that if something where to happen to me a lot more that just my friends would care. We both cried a bit and got back to what we where doing. One thing led to another and here I am on reddit for the first time probably ever thinking people think positive about me.

Another one of my friends I‚Äôve only known for a month knows more about me than most of my friends. Me and her really clicked and we have helped each other a lot, and I‚Äôd didn‚Äôt know me being there for her was so much. The fact that when I had a mental breakdown she texted and called me multiple times. I didn‚Äôt know she did this till after I came back to where I left my phone. She has been the one to start me on my spree of improving my mental health and the only friend who has seen me so broken like that.

It makes me wonder what some people think about me and how much some people care. The best part of my day is making the people around me smile and laugh and I really wonder how much my stupid comments or jokes mean to some people. I don‚Äôt think I know anyone who hates me and I don‚Äôt hate anyone. For the first time ever I don‚Äôt think everyone just puts up with me."
kiththan,fdjszyl,t3_elpgux,Maan I been through stuff like that too. And it really changed me to know that people really care! Makes one more positive. Hope you will find peace!

FakeBritishGal,fdsgcln,t3_emx9tp,I feel like most people on this kind of subreddits (or at least the ones who stick around) simply want a community to share their improvement or doubts with. Not everyone is good at making friends irl so an online support system of people trying to better themselves can be very helpful. Just saying not everyone is looking for the magic potion or wants the tough love treatment :)

Oberon_Swanson,fdsejmt,t3_emx9tp,"Yes I think the vast majority of people know what they need to do. Seeking more advice, tips, tricks, equipment, joining groups, etc is all just procrastination."

Oberon_Swanson,fdshhkn,t1_fdsfsa7,Yes so many people spend decades taking baby steps then giving up then taking baby steps then giving up. consistency is hugely important.  seriously there are a lot of things where if you just do it 15 minutes a day you will be amazed at your progress and you won't even be giving up that much time. eg. when you first wake up practice a musical instrument for 15 minutes. two years later your life will be the exact same as it otherwise would have been EXCEPT you will also be pretty good at a musical instrument and have your lfie enriched through the experience and possibilities it brings.
amandajskye,fdtx5u7,t3_emx9tp,I realized this a while back. I just kept buying every self help book you could imagine. Eventually I knew all there was to know. Knowledge is useless without action.  And reading those books was absolutely procrastination.

lostboy9119,fe05q08,t1_fe01i55,"When you stated that everyone should simply just do what they should do regardless of anything, you implied that one should disregard how they feel about doing something they should do and do it anyway meaning even if they didn't feel like doing what they should do, they should still do it anyways and when you do something you dont feel like doing, you use willpower.

And you said stop looking for magical advice meaning advice that makes what you should do seem like something you want to do. That's what people want from self help. To understand how to want to do the things they should do so they dont have to rely on willpower.

You're implying that the only way to do something is to just do it. Everybody knows what they should do, they're just here to figuire out how to get themselves to do it with means that are more reliable than willpower."
Stay_Frosty_Friends,fe308hi,t1_fe05q08,I'm implying nothing of the sort. I'm stating that the knowledge of the correct course of action (and also the incorrect) is already possessed by most and doesn't need to be stated by some guru first.

OneOriginalMoment,fdtzo7d,t3_emx9tp,"Finding and attempting strategies that have successfully allowed people to stick to their long term goals is far from magical...

&#x200B;

Of course everyone knows what to do, the fact of the matter is is that most people will not do everything the way they want to, for one reason or another; if someone's found a way to improve their adherence and / or intensity with respect to following through with some goal it is useful knowledge

&#x200B;

The point of self improvement strategy is to find better reactions to various events in our day to day lives such that our future selves are better off as opposed to doing some suboptimal reaction, where optimality includes latent factors which we don't understand yet such as motivation, discipline, etc

&#x200B;

So you can try every strategy under the sun and observe over time your delta of improvement a la plain Monte Carlo, or you can incorporate some bias by adopting a strategy that worked for some person (which is likely more similar to you than you'd think) and learn/adopt the strategy much, *much* faster"

faewyn01,eo05yr,top_level,"I graduated college about a year ago and I‚Äôm having a lot of trouble adjusting to the 9-5 life. I‚Äôve never really been good at maintaining hobbies. But life has become very boring since graduating. (Hate using that word...)

Not sure why but even though I sit at a desk all day, I literally feel like my life force has been drained from me when I get home. 

I don‚Äôt want to do ANYTHING. It takes everything in me to even cook dinner. For a while I was going to the gym but even that felt like too much to me? 

My coworkers talk about crafts they do, hikes they go on, small side hustles they have, books they read, etc. And I really feel like I have nothing. Nor do I have the energy to even do it. Meeting up for drinks after work is too much for me and I mostly sleep on weekends because I‚Äôm so exhausted. But I do nothing except work during the week, so I don‚Äôt know why I feel this way. 

It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like anything, I guess I‚Äôm just one of those people who have to be in the mood to do something. And I‚Äôm never in the mood after making dinner and cleaning up the kitchen post-work. By then it‚Äôs close to 7. I‚Äôm trying to shift my schedule to 7-3 so I don‚Äôt feel like the day escapes me. 

But I wanted to ask - how do you keep your energy after work? How do you indulge in new hobbies or make sure you keep time for the ones you have? 

I have all these ideas in my head but that‚Äôs just what they are. I fantasize at work about the things I want to try, classes I want to take, books I want to read, etc., but I always end up coming home and being a vegetable. 

Tips?"
Throwaway733286,fe6uzfl,t3_eo05yr,Get your blood work done. I was in a similar boat until I realised I had vitamin B and D deficiencies along with less iron in my blood. Once I got on supplements I have more energy than I used to
WarmOutOfTheDryer,fe77vaj,t1_fe6uzfl,"Vitamin D supplements (that were given to me after a blood test by my doctor) have literally rewritten my attitude on life. They weren't kidding when they tell you that nutrition and vitamins are important not just for physical health, but mental. 

No, it didn't cure me, yes, I still take my antidepressants, but it made a huge a noticeable difference in my day-to-day mood. Every once in a while, I even feel normal now.

So here's an enthusiastic seconding to having blood work done!"
iGaav,fe788us,t1_fe6uzfl,"This one is definitely true for energy levels. If you get 7-9 hours of sleep each night, that's probably not the issue.

I would suggest fixing it through proper diet instead of supplements first though. When I notice low energy levels despite proper sleep, I can bet on it that I lack iron. A meal with a good portion of leafy greens (I like kale or spinach) and the next day I'll be back to stable energy levels."
Throwaway733286,fe7hczd,t1_fe77vaj,"Serious vitamin D deficiency mimics symptoms of depression, fatigue, loss of interest and energy, body pain etc, which is what I was dealing with.

Get that checked by a psychiatrist. I had about the same issues. Wellbutrin works really good in that regard. No wounder pill, but a good help."
-FR3SH-,fe9qycs,t1_fe78tqf,"This is important to consider.

When I was in a similar situation as OP, I called my Employee Assistance Program and talked to someone about about why I was struggling to do anything I wanted to do after work. I wanted to study to help advance my career. I was interested in the study material. I was driven, in my head, to grow in my career. I had the time. But, after work, I always ended up just watching TV with my wife, who was sick.

So I called the EAP and they suggested counseling to see why I wasn't able to make myself do what I felt I wanted to do. I started talking to the counselor, and that's how I found out, that although I felt happy and I never would've thought so,  I was depressed.

I learned a lot about myself (everything I learned made sense per my past experiences), and through what I learned about myself, I felt like I was able to slowly improve. I didn't take any meds or anything, but I was able to talk through some stuff with the counselor, and try to make efforts to make things better.

Truth is, though, it didn't get much better for a long time, for me. My wife passed away a few months or so later. 

I stopped going to that counselor, but continued to work on things on my own.

Things have gotten much better over time. I can't say I don't have depression anymore, but I feel I'm able to manage it without medication. This won't be the case for everyone with depression. You just need to know if it's depression and see what the options are.

I think it could be very helpful to look into your mental health and see if there's more to the picture than you're seeing. Mental health is important, and it's good to be informed.

OP, I hope you are able to find the improvements you seek, and I hope the best for you! Good luck!"

As others here pionted out, the 1st one can be a health problem: you should make blood check, switch to healthier foods and more exercise. I'm doing half an hour of exercising in the evening (I also finish at 7ish), at home, from a mobile app - so there is no excuse here to do something minimal that can possibly help you have more energy during the day.

The 2nd point is important, because I don't know if you are gaming, Netflixing or using your mobile phone in the remaining time. If after 7 you just log into Facebook or Youtube (or Reddit), and spend hours there, you will have a very hard time finding hobbies. These activities are lazy replacements of creative, creating hobbies, and the feed your brain with so many inputs that a hobbi never can give. Sadly, you will never enjoy cross-stitch or cooking or chess if your brain knows that it could be watching Netflix, which is far more rewarding on the short term.

So I suggest you: 1. Try to change you lifestyle to a healthier/more active one, because you need the energy for a hobby;  2. Cut out cheap entertainments that replace hobbies.

After this, finding a hobbi is exactly as simple as you could imagine: search on Wikipedia for list of hobbies, and try out the ones you are interested in. At this point, your body will naturally react positively if you find something you like, because the tiredness/overloadedness factors are out of the way."
CrochetHoe,fe7f4sp,t3_eo05yr,"Honestly when I started working my first 9-5 job I had the same problem, it felt like the evenings were too short to really do anything. However I forced myself to do something, even if it was playing video games, for a little while after work instead of wasting the time and once i started it became easier to be a bit more optimistic about the evenings. Nowadays I actively look forward to doing things after work."
justlosttbh,fe7e76x,t3_eo05yr,"I strongly recommend doing a dopamine-fast, the benefits you'll reap are wonderful.

 In my personal experience, it resets willpower and motivation, plus it energices you and motivates you incredibly, and it also, helps clear out your thoughts and focus on the things you desire and feel, like, I felt discomfort and sadness at the beginning, and embracing those feelings with nothing to distract me from them enabled me to find the source of the negative feelings, fix things, focus on what I TRULY wanted, and I'm way happier now. 

Also, I think it's beneficial to do one periodacally. I do a dopamine-fast every week, and I try to minimise the activities that give us a lot of ""dopamine highs"" or ""rewards"" without really earning them such us: junk food, porn, or the internet, I also minimise mi use of electronic devices. 

A dopamine-fast consists in a whole day (or the whole weekend) were de only things you can do are: sleep, drink water (you can't eat during the fast), write your thoughts (you can't read anything or consume any source of information besides your own thoughts, this includes being with other people, you need to be alone) exercise (with no music or podcasts), meditate, go for a walk, and activities were only you and your body are involved, you can't use anything else besides yourself. 

You can't however, eat, jerk-off, watch any form of video, movie or series, listen to any music (you can sing), listen to any podcasts or any form of talk shows, interact with any people, consume any form of information, enter any sort of social media, or basically, do any activity that requires an external source (from yourself) to be done. 

I won't lie, it's tough at first. But really, being alone with your thoughts and your life and feeling happy is a bliss. And in the beginning you may encounter discomfort or negative emotions, but understanding them can be the starting point of a happy life.

Hope this post helps you!"
ProfessorCarter,fe9en37,t1_fe7e76x,"I like this idea, I should try this"
sakshatkolhatkar,fe7u07m,t1_fe7e76x,This sounds really interesting. I am going to try this out maybe like once a month.
MentorFriend,febr0e2,t1_fe7e76x,"This sounds so interesting and so much needed, in a world of constant stimulation and distraction. It reminds me of my grandparents who would tell us about how their parents turned off the radio and were still, as the day turned into night. It was called 'quiet-hour'."

Mordecai_Cometh,fe7vd3t,t3_eo05yr,"Some hobbies don't require that much energy. I have two fishtanks. They're quite sophisticated. And I don't need energy to care of them. 

And about sleep. Sleep is your number one priority."
Cjanesh,fe8cgsc,t3_eo05yr,Action comes before motivation
MechanicalOwl117,fe8mbzc,t3_eo05yr,"  

Energy drainage can be a result of a lot of things. The first steps I would say - watch what you eat (eat quality meals and snacks), make a point to stretch through out your work day, and get good sleep. There may be more extreme issue of why energy is crap, but those 3 are the basic and easiest to address first and test for better results. All 3 can be elaborated in more detail of specifics.

When you get home, make sure to refuel. Have a small snacks or something to recharge your batteries. My personal favorite after an 8-hour work day is a small bowl of cereal (Kashi) and dry fruit.

It seems that you have ideas of what you want to do when you get off work. Try to focus on one at a time. Having to many options can overwhelm your subconscious and make you feel drained on the idea of making a choice in the end. When your next idea comes up, write it down and focus only on making that one thing happen. Over time of thinking of it, it will develop into a plan of commitment.

Example-

\-I want to read a new book-

\-Commit to reading 10 pages, then another 10, then another 10

\-Enjoy a favorite beer or tea while reading

\-Can‚Äôt concentrate at home; go to coffee shop

\-Read non spoiler online articles to entice my interest more

Speaking of reading, that was one of my goals a few years back. I decided to commit to reading 20 pages of a novel a day and was marking it on the calendar. Now I consistently read daily. Some days more, but typically always 30-40. It has become a habit and my grammar thanks me for it."
Ipiu3,fe763hz,t3_eo05yr,"I have the exact same issue, except I don't always manage to at least feed myself and clean, so, y'know, good job !
Try to get healthier, sleep regularly and enough, eat well, exercise, maybe meditate.

If that doesn't seem to work, go to the doctor, get some blood tests done, check for thyroid issues, or food intolerance if you also have some digestive issues for example."
Remahlehs,febvz7z,t3_eo05yr,"Schedule time in advance. If I say I'm going to read at 8 PM, then I know what I need to do at 8. If my schedule is open and I want to enjoy a hobby, I can get overwhelmed at my options and spend my time on Reddit instead."
Jemmy_Time,fe7dqbv,t3_eo05yr,"I was in that position last year doing my 9-5 grind. It was such menial, repetitive boring work that I just didn't have anything during the day to be excited FOR. That may have been the issue. Anyways, I had some financial troubles at the time which required me to get a second job for after work and on the weekends. This job paid a bit less but was more physical and more free/engaging than my main job. I was worried I wouldn't have the energy to perform this job, but to my surprise, I actually had way more energy, even after working a full shift at the 9-5. I think just having a job that can be at least a little exciting and physically stimulating would help in your situation. So if I were you I'd either try to get a better 9-5, or try to make a routine out of a physically engaging activity after work until you get used to it. I don't know, good luck and best wishes."
spoon27,fe7k4jg,t3_eo05yr,"Are you getting enough nutrition from what your eating? Huge difference in my energy levels if I eat well vs not. Also our brains love to tell us we're more tired than we actually maybe. Last Friday I was invited to a restaurant opening after work. I worked 10-6.30 and right after my shift ended I was like awww fuck this shit I'm too tired. Aww fuck why did I say I would go??!
 I said I'd be there so I went. I had a great night as soon as I started chatting to people - new people I hadn't met before, I felt so much better. Like I was bouncing with energy.
Sometimes I think you just need to override the part of your brain that's telling you you're tired. Or you might be dehydrated. Water is great, we should all drink more."
Avenger725,fe7kfdc,t3_eo05yr,"Other than all the medical reasons listed above by other people, I think you should not look at the day as just being over after 7pm. That's coz if u spend that time thinking about how the day is over, it's just gonna make u think about the day that went by or the day that is yet to come. You might spend the next 2-3 hrs just doing that. Even if it's doing something you had on your mind for 10 mins, do it. Gradually you might even start doing that thing for longer than 10 mins and begin to seriously enjoy it. Im not in a 9-5 yet, but I can imagine how exhausting it can be. Wishing you the best."
beizbol,fe97n1l,t3_eo05yr,"Physically: Consistent sleep schedule, exercise, food choices (limiting sugar/processed carbs especially), hydration, and vitamin levels all help. Keeping these in line is practically a full hobby in and of itself. 

Mentally: Time box it. Just start with 15 mins. Like literally set a timer on your phone. If you don't want to stop when the timer goes that's up to you but make yourself do a bit no matter what. Worst case you have read a few pages of a book for example and after a week you've read a chapter. There's always the chance you accidentally get in the zone and read half the book too but there's no pressure. If you can do 1% per day, you're done in 3-4 months. 500 page book --> 5 pages a day. 

Quick trick: Feeling dead? Like don't even feel like sitting dead? But it's time for your 15 mins...? Do some quick squats or something to get enough blood going to keep your brain running. Maybe get a groovy song going in your head or better yet play it. Then start quick before your heart slows back down and your energy drops."
Kammen1990,fe6npjj,t3_eo05yr,"Well you‚Äôll have to find something you really like and that will give you the energy to do it.

But you do have to start somewhere... only thing I can say is just do it!"
evyatari,fe83493,t3_eo05yr,Have sex regularly
FreedomManOfGlory,fe7dkdn,t3_eo05yr,"Here's a few things you can do:

1. Look into the ketogenic diet or the carnivore diet and adopt either. A shitty diet will affect your health and energy levels, as will relying on stimulants like coffee. Coffee might make you feel awake for a while after you drink it, but it also messes you up and generally only makes you more tired. So you'll have to drink more and more of it just to get to the same level you'd be at if you never drank it at all.
2. Find something you'd actually enjoy doing. The only way to do that is by actively looking for it and by trying out different things. Joining a gym to work out on machines, as most people do, is the most boring thing imaginable. It's just one of the many ways in which people make their life so much more difficult than it has to be. You have endless amounts of options available to get some physical exercise and to find any hobbies that you truly enjoy doing. So look for those things. Stop doing what everyone else is doing. You'll just end up as miserable as them while telling yourself that ""it's not that bad"". Things could always be worse but they sure could always be better as well, so look for better ways.
3. And the last thing ties in with what I've already just said. The more energy you expand, the more you'll have. Assuming that you give your body enough time to rest as well as all the energy and nutrients it needs for proper functioning. So find any kind of workout that you enjoy and adopt a healthy diet. I highly recommend the ones I mentioned simply because they eliminate all the crap that makes people fat and sick. And that will provide you with more energy. You have to get through the initial period of course where you're not used to it and are still in poor shape. But if you can stick it out for at least a few weeks, then you should reach the point where you start to enjoy it and then things can be effortless. Working out should not a hassle and a struggle, it should be something you enjoy. After sitting on your ass all day in a very sedentary job you should be looking forward to moving your body, because it makes you feel better and improves your health and fitness. Physical exercise has a lot of benefits, but the biggest one comes from doing something that you actually enjoy as well, as that makes everything easier.
4. And this applies to your drive and motivation as well. What is it that drives people? Your mental attitude and what you expect from life is important for that. And so if you get stuck in a daily routine, then that can lead you to forget about everything you really care about and life becomes a drag. But if you find things you're passionate about and you start spending time on those, then that will motivate you and revitalize you. That's what gives your life a meaning. Fulfilling obligations and doing what you're told doesn't. But even if you still have a to work a job you don't care about and do other things you don't enjoy that much, having things you're passionate about to work on in your free time will provide you with the enjoyment you're looking for. And it will make putting up with your job and everything else much easier as well because now your life doesn't revolve purely around fulfilling obligations anymore. So find some things that you really care about and truly enjoy."
ivan_aivazovsky,fe7zrzn,t3_eo05yr,"Maybe its the job that's draining the energy from you? I learnt from experience that  when you sont have a sense of purpose when you are working, it quickly becomes something that takes energy away from you. I started working as a freelancer a while back, on things I love doing, that make me feel alive. And it drives me to work harder, plus the idea of earning more, and learning more and achieving more is a huge drive for me. It has always been a ""lets show the world that I can do anything"" mindset. Plus I think a huge part of doing activities that make you better as a person (finding ways to creatively express yourself, cooking healthy meals, exercise, social events etc) come from self love. If you feel like you love the person that you are, you will only wish the best for yourself and thus work on it. 

I myself have gone through a period in life where I felt like doing nothing except the bare minimum, and I always explained it as a seasonal thing, so maybe that's the case for you too? It just takes sometimes slowly nudging yourself in the right direction to build that momentum, and then you will like it and the effect it has on you, and it will become a habit. At least for me that's how it worked. Look at motivating people around you! For instance I turned to look at people like Gary V and other content creators that advocate for the ""hustle culture"" and slowly but surely I started getting back to all those additional activities such as side hustles, new projects, soul projects... 

Recognizing a problem is the first step to the solution, so good luck!"
SirGiepmanos,fe84gjf,t3_eo05yr,"Focus on what you eat. Work out 3 times week for about an hour. Limit sugar and other crap food intake. See if you can get your bloodwork done. After a while you should feel more energetic and when thks routine is in your system try and think about who you are, and what you like, and if you want to be someothing else. If this is the case read about it, and try to make this activity fit in your schedule.
Systems sound boring, but if you mealprep every Sunday, go the gym or whatever things you do on this day, youll get used to it. After that it will be easier to fit other activities in thia schedule. Just randomly doing stuff rarely works out, I can speak from experience.
Writing a 200-500 words diary at the end of most of your days also realy helps reflecting on what you do.
Also remember that nothing is a straight line up. Sometimes you wont work out, eat shit, not prep a meal, not write in your diary. Everbody has this, dont be hard on yourself and bounce back.

I used to be just like you, and im alot better now. You got this!"
ZZ3xhZz,fe8ap4y,t3_eo05yr,"You're not alone. Ive go through many waves where this happens to me. You dont have to do anything either, just relax. currently I am doing a part time correspondence course. The only time I have energy is early morning. So i study for 90 mins then work then come home. It sounds cleche, but drink more water. I feel drained if I dont."
DrJin,fe8jkps,t3_eo05yr,Do you get headaches? I went through something similar for years and it ended up being related to tight and strained muscles.
Oberon_Swanson,fe8olg9,t3_eo05yr,"You may find more success getting up earlier and doing stuff you enjoy before work. 

Also see what you can do to find out why work is so draining for you. Maybe the light conditions put a huge strain on your eyes, or noise strains your ears. Or maybe it's just a stressful environment. Anything you can get like a more comfortable chair, better placement in your office, etc. can help you. Also take the stress out of your commute if you can. Take transit if feasible.

Watch your diet for things like setting yourself up for a caffeine crash when you're done work.

Also you may just consider taking a nap when you get home if that's what's needed. Having say, 5 hours of time to yourself when you get home at night, where you have energy to pursue hobbies and passions and meaningful living outside work, vs. 6 hours of time when you're tired as fuck, the 5 hours is way better."

socialjusticecleric7,fe9nnww,t3_eo05yr,"1. There could be a medical thing going on ‚Äî maybe see a doctor? Specifically I think depression can sometimes manifest this way. 

2. I‚Äôd suggest trying small changes over time and recording what happens. For instance, you say you have to be in the right mood to do anything, but what happens if you try doing something you‚Äôre not in the mood for? Does going for a 15 minute walk every day after work for a week cause any changes? Ok what about 15 minutes of (hobby you‚Äôve enjoyed in the past?) If you get drinks with co-workers one day even though you don‚Äôt feel like it, how does that feel during and after? You might find that pushing yourself to do things actually gives you motivation. 

Or not, idk."

MentorFriend,febnknn,t3_eo05yr,"It does take a little more than a year to adjust to the new routine, for sure. However, what you're describing is similar to something that I've dealt with personally. My situation might have been different than yours and so my comment might not be of direct help. It might give you something to reflect about at worst.

I came to find that the reason for my low energy post work, was that the field that I was working in, was not even close to being aligned with how I get my energy levels up naturally. It was draining me for the most part and so I had to analyse what I was missing in my job.

I came to find that I am driven by helping others in their personal lives and to create big turnarounds for people by working closely with them, more so than being a tiny fragment of a large corporation and giving all my advise to other counsellors etc.

I am a people person, calm and creative and so I need the place that I'm working in, to reflect that. I had to make a few quite big changes in order to get closer to what I'm personally more happy with and I'm still working on that.

Again, this might not be your case, but maybe it belongs somewhere in the perspective.

Good luck to you."

Varggang,fe6rjsj,t3_eo05yr,"Sounds like your body is very unhealthy.  


Energy wise it very simple: People who live a lazy life will always feel tired and beat.   
People who exercise, sleep 7-9 hours, eat a decent diet will always have good energy.  


So, if you dont exercise, start there. There is no secret formula or magic."
iHateKnives,fe7cpib,t3_eo05yr,"I think it's harmless to seek out help from mental health professionals (psychiatrists/psychologists/counselors). It'll cost your wallet but you should come out of it as a better person. I'm not saying you have anything, but someone in the mental health field could def point you in the right direction. There's one other caveat tho: it takes some work to find the right person for you

Best of luck OP"
CuteCandyCane,enatky,top_level,"Hey there! Here's my backstory: I'm 19 years old and I've always battled with depression and suicidal thoughts. My anxiety was severely high I was scared to talk to girls or anyone in general. I always used to give up way too easily and always had negative thoughts. My negative thoughts were always inside of me and always occurred at night. I had been dealing with hairloss and other medical issues that fucked with my mind. Everyday i would research side effects of the drug that treats hairloss and always scared me. I developed severe health anxiety and everyone was annoyed at me.i was also very insecure of my looks, my jealousy and paranoia of other people were so hard I'd always cry myself to sleep, I'd always get jealous of other people's looks it kills me. 

August: from the back story gradually getting worse and worse I attempted suicide. I was cutting myself and I always wanted to die. The thoughts were permanently in my mind. I'd always watch high school shooting videos like Columbine and I've been doing this every week. I watched it because i felt a connection between the shooters and I which are depression and isolation (which I'll explain later in how that's bullshit). I was crying everyday at work and the managers were always there for me, all my friends were freaking out and such , it was horrible. 

September-October: after August even though I built a support system, everything was still going downhill, I'd get depressed outta nowhere and then watch those videos again to make myself feel good. I was failing university, I dropped all my courses except calculus because I didn't want to drop out. My friend was helping me since the beginning and told me to take a year off which I didn't. She kept on telling me to stop comparing myself to others which I never listened at the time. I was literally going to the darkest paths of my life. I then got a prescription of the drug but o had a anxiety attack and threw away the pills. In October I posted something really dark on social media and the police came to my door and I explained everything to them and brought me to the hospital. There I had to be awake till 5am waiting for a professional to evaluate me, and after I spoke I slept. The next morning I was so tired and two others had to evaluate me again by asking the same questions and later on there were other prisoners who were yelling profanity and it was the worst experience I've ever had.  I thought i was a criminal. The professional told me if I was in the United States I'd be charged with terrioism and I felt a relief of hope inside of me. Later I was released and I was having the best time of my life. My family and I reconnected and i started studying for the first time in months and I made so many friends. 

November: that didn't last long. After two and a half weeks I had a sudden crash. All those thoughts came again and I said something really bad to my friend and I told her i was gonna take the drug and kill myself, she called the cops and they came to my work place and I explained to them everything again. They then left and I realized at that point I need to change. I need to take action, this was my final wake up call. The police told me that the idea of me connecting to the school shooters is very bad bc they said I'm not insane they are and made me realize everyone has some type of isolation. It was eye opening. After that I lost my best friend but I couldn't make the same mistake again. My family is my support system as well as my friends 

December: this was the best months of my life. I made new friends, I talked to my favourite people, I stoped going on those websites that talk about the drug, I continued studying and I went from a failing grade to  B (my final grade), I was so happy. My university was checking up on me, and I was living my best life. I made plans for my future, I got rid of my old habits. I started exploring new things. I actually felt happy for once. I only had a crash ONCE but that was very minor and not like the crashes before. 

To this day I haven't been suicidal or depressed. It's been two months since I haven't been suicidal or depressed. I actually feel amazing, at work I'm now filled with energy and filled with joy. I used to be abusive and extremely edgy. Now I'm the complete opposite. I feel like my old self again. I'm now going to start joining clubs at my school, skate (it's winter!), read,  make more friends, and enjoy my best fucking life! I no longer have severe health anxiety, I'm no longer depressed or suicidal, I'm still anxious and insecure but I've always been that way. No more negative thoughts thst happens at night. No more school shooting videos. I'm the best person. My next goal is to start brushing my teeth twice a day and try to reduce my lazziness. 

I'm really proud of myself. My friends are, my family is, my managers are. It feels amazing to still be living here and for once in three years, I actively feel like I have a purpose here in my life."

Bethybee77,engpp4,top_level,"Long story short - I dont stick to anything and it's really really bad. Jobs are the worst. 

When I was younger I was severely bullied at school, my mum decided to move me to a different school, but the damage was already done and I had severe anxiety. I kept moving from one school into another thinking things would be better, I dont blame my mum because honestly i think that she just wanted to take the pain away. Eventually I was homeschooled and I loved it and learned much more than school because I could finally concentrate. 

But fast forward to adulthood, and I freak out with everything. Starting a new job? Cant do it , need to be safe and comfortable again. I really really need to break this habit. Its not that I think I shouldn't have to do hard things because I know life is not always like that. But I get an instant reaction in my brain when I do something I find difficult and sometimes I'm not even aware that I've sabotaged it because I'm scared of being uncomfortable. 

I feel like I'm the only one in the world with this problem... 

Please no nasty comments, I really genuinely need advice and want to improve.

UPDATE: 
Thank you everyone for your amazing advice and comment, it honestly means so much and you've all inspired me to apply for jobs. I've got an interview for a small job, but I'm really scared!

somaandfeelies,fdzvoax,t3_engpp4,"Many people, if not all, experience some discomfort when encountering new and difficult situations. You're certainly not the only one in the world with this problem and as you build relationships and spend more time around people, this will likely become increasingly apparent. I don't know you and I'm going exclusively off of ten sentences, so take the paragraph of armchair psychology for what it's worth... not much. You need to figure out why you're like this and what you can do about it yourself or with a qualified professional.

It sounds like you and your mother took a stance of avoidance as the means of dealing with a series of less than desirable social circumstances. Your comfortable place became where you could learn unhindered by the difficulties of navigating social environments or your emotions that arose from them. Unfortunately, much of life, both personal and professional, requires communication, relationship building, team work and a variety of basic social skills that maybe you've had difficulty developing. Like so many other skills, this is one that can be improved through practice.

Maybe you can go through an entire life avoiding any discomfort or challenge but, is that really the life you want for yourself? Even if you can manage it, you'll likely make countless concessions of fulfillment and growth for the sake of familiarity and comfort.

At the end of the day, life can be difficult and is frequently uncomfortable. There's not much advice for you but to accept your short comings and do what you can to improve on them. Excuse my language but I'd prefer not to sound like a shoe commercial... Just fucking do it and keep doing it isn't really the advice anyone wants to hear but sometimes it's really the only thing for it. Find a therapist you jive with. Find some social gatherings for activities that you enjoy so you can be around people and the only discomfort isn't doing something you're uncomfortable with and rather just being around people. Make an effort to communicate with the people you encounter in your daily life; it might be rocky at first but that's not a big deal, you'll learn how to both be yourself and appropriately react to other people. Get the job and show up. Find proper, healthy coping mechanisms like breathing exercises or physical exercise.

Learn to anticipate thoughts of self-sabotage and be ready with mental frameworks and physical routines to counteract negative or impulsive behavior. Whether you need to take three deep breaths, tell yourself that you can do it, remember a happy memory or a time you pushed through adversity to achieve a meaningful reward, think of something that doing this activity will enable you to do or anything else that works, you need to figure out ways to encourage the kind of positive reaction and self-talk to enable you to overcome these obstacles to personal fulfillment. Maybe you just grit your teeth and bear it and establish a positive, meaningful reward afterwards to associate with that perseverance. Find out what works for you. That's what life is.

You can do it. It probably won't be as easy as you'd like but it will probably be worth it and will almost certainly result in you growing as a human being."
rodpwned07,fdzxiy8,t1_fdzvoax,Well put
Bethybee77,fe1246f,t1_fdzvoax,"Thank you so much for this, I need to keep referring to it!"
theladycrimson,fe2oj1u,t3_engpp4,"Let me first off start by saying I am so sorry you are going through this.

You are definitely not alone. I had a friend in middle school and high school that was this way, the main difference is she failed to realize it within herself. Every time a report came up where we'd have to present to the front of the class, she'd be home sick. If she got into an argument with her sister on the way to school, her mother would keep her home sick. Band tryouts? Sick the initial day. Band gets too difficult? She'd suddenly become sick right before band class. Her mother almost lost custody of her because she missed more than half of the school year one year and had to go to court over her excessive absences.

It was obvious to us friends that every time a stressful situation would arrive, she suddenly became sick. What's worse is half the time she was sick, her mother kept her home just because her stomach hurt and nothing else was wrong. So because of this, my friend truly equated upset stomach to beginning stages of being sick, not the fact that the upset stomach is a *nervous* stomach, full of anxiety.

I tried to help her, but because she didn't see things from our perspective and didn't see anything wrong with how she's done things, she's now struggling as an adult.

So, I commend you for realizing there is a problem here. You are definitely not alone. I condense souped version my friends story for you, but your story is **very** similar to hers.

I recommend you continue seeing your therapist. Have your therapist work with you to push your boundaries.

Do you use a bullet journal? If so (or not, just use a notebook) and make an ""Anti-Anxiety"" page. Split the page in half by drawing a line down the middle. At the top of the pagyw for the left side, write down ""What I think will happen"", and on the right write down ""What actually happened"". Every time you are about to encounter an uncomfortable situation, write down on the left side of the page what you feel is the worst thing will happen. ""Will be bullied, made a mockery, won't be able to relax"" etc etc. Then, after the event has happened, reflect and write down what *really* happened. If you do this enough you'll notice that your anxieties **greatly** exaggerate the worst case scenario. Use it enough, and you'll be comforted by the idea that what you write down will not happen, because the vast majority (if not all) your past anxieties didn't play out as you feared.

Not sure how you feel about medication, but there are things out there that can help. My daughter has anxiety (different triggers) and has medication that does help her through those situations.

Take baby steps trying to build yourself up. What are small things you can do now to push yourself? Can you handle going to the grocery store or therapist alone? What about going to the library and asking about the location of a book (irreguardless if you know how to find it, the point is to find those uncomfortable moments).

Also, figure out what exactly makes you afraid. Is it 100% just going outside of your comfort zone, or is it the interaction with strangers and unfamiliar places? Do authoritative figures cause you discomfort? 

I wish you the best of luck. I hope you can find the help you need. I am very proud of the fact that you realize this is a problem that needs worked, and not diluted with the idea that the outside world and unconformable situations are to be avoided. Hearing that, I feel you will be able to overcome this. Just takes one step at a time."
Bethybee77,fe4zie7,t1_fe2oj1u,"This is really helpful, thank you very much."
theladycrimson,fe58e83,t1_fe4zie7,"You're welcome.

I'm not sure of the degree your anxieties lay, but I do have another idea that may help.

Is there any object that you know of that helps you calm down when you feel unconformable? Could be a locket, a stuffed animal, or maybe even a pet. If so, maybe use that comfort item to your advantage as you move into stressful situations.

My son is moderately-severely autistic. When he was very little, he had a grover doll that was his comfort item. He took him everywhere with him. He was small enough to somewhat fit in his pant pockets when he was school age. As he got older, it switched from the grover doll to a purple teddy bear he got for Christmas. Was bigger than the grover doll, but he took that bear everywhere. I kid you not he constantly sat on the poor thing when at home, but held it tight whenever he got anxious or scared.

My daughter has developed anxiety as she's gotten older. She currently has a Porg doll (bird thing from Star Wars) that she uses when her anxieties get bad. She tries not to rely on the Porg doll, but she will get severe anxiety and panic attacks, and handling the doll helps to calm her down.

Do you have an item that helps you? Sure, this is not the best solution to things (becoming codependent upon another object to make you feel safe). However, if your anxieties are severe enough, then it may be an idea to consider. Find something that give you peace of mind so that you can face those difficult situations, and then over time wean yourself off. My son no longer relies on any objects to give him peace in stressful situations. He still has both of his dolls, tucked away in shoe boxes in his closet ""sleeping"" as he puts it, but hasn't touched them in a few years. This was all his doing, we never pushed him to become unattached to his comforts (having a comfort item for an autistic as severe as he is when he has his meltdowns is a godsend). However, he slowly broke away and now can cope on his own much better.

Another thought. One of the big reasons my son no longer requires a comfort item is because his therapist taught him a breathing technique for when he's stressed. I've seen him use it when an ordinary situation would cause him to meltdown or panic, and it works greatly. Has your therapist tried teaching you breathing techniques to help you calm yourself down? If not, may be something to ask. If you know you're about to get into a stressful situation, having the ability to calm yourself by breathing could do a world of good.

I hope this helps!"
stickysweetastytreat,fdztbz5,t3_engpp4,"You are definitely not the only one with this problem!

What is it exactly that makes you feel unsafe and uncomfortable in, let's say, the new job as an example? Are they thoughts? Emotions? And what's happening at the new job that triggers this? Or is it the thought of starting something new?

Also-- don't overlook that asking for help with this is a huge step!!!"

Raziel3,fe02jsp,t3_engpp4,Its not about hard work. Its about getting in a motivating cycle. When you feel what you re doing provides relief and you re in balance then a little hard work is doable. Hard work is all about doing good things. If they arnt good then why do you do them? There is something in game design called balance. But it also applies beyond game design to life. Its the key to an experience that isnt conflicting your emotions into bad feelings.

Do something that makes you uncomfortable today. Then the next day you might take it a step further and so on. As long as you keep it up and stay on track you might get used to facing discomfort much quicker than you'd have ever thought. But of course it requires that you push through the resistance and especially in the beginning that might not be easy. Still, it's the only option, so think about what overcoming this will do for you and just start working on it."

If you have a therapist already they can refer you to psychiatry. There are also a lot of cool online services. I use talkspace because it really cuts down the time on picking and trying to choose a good therapist/psychiatrist and waiting a month for your appt.

But if you are afraid of doing something and you do it anyway, you've kind of won already.   Doing it well after that is really just icing on the cake.    

In fact, I would be willing to bet that you were nervous posting this in the first place but that once you did, you felt good about yourself.   That feeling of pride is what you have to look forward to and the more you are scared of something the more pride you will have by doing it anyway."

For a practical point of view, you MUST take action. This is critical. Here are some suggestions:

\-get counselling. this is necessary for you as your anxiety is at a clinical level, its not simple day-to-day anxiety. Please take this seriously, there is NO shame in getting help. 

\-sign up for ToastMasters. This is a very nurturing and supportive way to do public speaking.

\-take an evening college class just for fun (not some difficult skill). I would suggest something like psychology 101, cooking classes or maybe even basic financial planning.

\-research and read some self help books on anxiety; youtube videos are good also. 

\-practice lots of small talk with strangers like store clerks (even if you have to use some fake questions), neighbors, meetup, etc

\-put a strict time limit on gaming. For example, 2 hours a day. You must document your times and you are not allowed to break the rules.

Remember friend, you **MUST TAKE ACTION** to fix this problem. Repeating some motivational phrase *wont* help. Using plain willpower *wont* work. Wishing *wont* work. Taking action *will* work."

Then it turned into showing up for that one class and going straight back home. Slowly it  turned goinfgfor lunch with a friend after class.

RemarkableFlow,fdnxxsd,t3_em8vt9,"Hey man, its really crazy to read this. I feel like this was totally me about 2 years ago. Fear took me over. In fact the most relateable part of this is you mentioned your parents were not ""hard on you"" growing up. I had that some experience! I was given nearly everything, was in a comfortable cocoon constantly nurtured by my parents. I wasn't exposed to much adversity and never was forced to take on much responsibility, which I think amounted to a person not aware of my own capabilities. Once I escaped the cocoon, out into the real world, I was shook. I wasn't equipped with the proper mindset and tools to overcome my fears. I wallowed in them for a few years, cowering back any chance I was given. Then everything turned around over the course of about a year and I think what really helped me was learning a good life philosophy, and a big part of that philosophy was viewing those fears as challenges, rather than something chasing me down. There is a big psychological difference there, instead of letting the fear consume me and beat me down, I viewed these things I was afraid of as a challenge to overcome, and in doing so I experienced some positive emotion (as I was moving toward a goal, instead of running away), and built up a ton of confidence in myself (by seeing myself in the light of a person who doesn't back to down to challenge).

That was probably the biggest attitude adjustment that had a profound effect on my life, and I still can't believe the person I've become and the confident approach I take to fear now. Additionally, I think that daily exercise (running in my case - having a goal is huge, like marathon training is what keeps me motivated. The confidence building effect here is HUGE) and cold showers (voluntarily exposing yourself to discomfort as part of a daily routine that essentially keeps my mind conditioned to voluntarily face discomfort -which is closely linked to fear).

I tried to keep this short, but as a result of facing fear and overcoming obstacles my horizons have expanded so much it's hard to decouple the individual effects of the numerous changes that have come along the upward spiraled path this has taken me. Some books that really made this whole attitude adjustment click to me are 12 Rules for Life by JBP and Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins.

You are very conscientious and self-aware.  That would be good for self-protection.  You are aware of the problem, which is stopping you from pretty much doing anything.

I actually agree with you that we are so limited and have so much out of our control.  It would therefore be difficult for anyone to rely solely on themself.  If they do, they really are taking a risk on any moves.

James said in the Bible, ""Come now, you who say, ‚ÄúToday or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit‚Äù‚Äî yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes.  Instead you ought to say, ‚ÄúIf the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.‚Äù (James 4:13-15)

 You see, we can plan all we can, but it is the Lord who helps us in anything we say or do.  So it is important that we have a relationship with Him.  We broke our relationship with God because of our wrongdoings.  All that you need to do is to confess your sins and accept Jesus who died on the cross for you.  God is for you and not against you.

Machele_LifeLeap,fdod4nc,t3_em8vt9,"A good journal exercise for you would be to answer what if to each one...the fear is the problem, not the actual outcome you're fearing. For example, why would it be so bad if you blanked? Or why would it be so bad if you offended someone? Why would an accident be so bad - they happen all the time and people recover. I would spend less time trying to get over the fear and more time worrying about why that feared outcome would be so bad. 

Assume that someone gets offended by something you say (some will, some won't), so what? Like seriously. People can even get offended if you don't talk...we have no control over that.
