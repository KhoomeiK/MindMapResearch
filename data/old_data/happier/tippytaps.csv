Imlovingyou,fdk5uzm,t1_fdk5tg8,No...but...I freakin love the idea!!!!!!!
Ghotilad,fdkdeln,t1_fdk5uzm,"How you start it is you do an over branching comment to everyone saying you love them all looking for anyone who refuses or says no thank you. Then you proceed to annoyingly convince them to just accept it. Where you find the most difficulty is keeping them hooked.  My tactic is responding with over simplified and most likely false armchair psychology and that accepting my love with make them feel better. To add more annoyance maKe sure you correct any grammer or spelling errors they make. Another key part is to never define the type or intensity of love. Your love lies anywhere between love for yor fellow man to straight up sexual and obsessive. If you want to end the conversation, implant some creepiness have have your love suddenly escalate in style or intensity. I did this on world of warcraft and i managed to find where the guy was questing so i set my character to fallow him making everything that much creepier

> While the former moonwalker has no problem suggesting that Earth is being visited by extraterrestrials who may also be using the moon as a good vantage point for keeping an eye on our planet, in this particular case, he’s saying that the specific quotes attributed to him by The Mirror were, frankly, alien to him.

> Mitchell does believe ETs have an interest in humanity’s destructive capabilities. In his email to HuffPost, he states the following:

> “I have told several sources about my connections over the years with military officers manning missile silos during the Cold War with the Soviet Union who told me personally of UFOs hovering over their missile sites and disabling the missiles targeting the Soviet Union.

> “Also, that some of our military missiles were shot down by UFOs during some missile tests from a military station on the California coast. This was rather common knowledge coming from various military officers from years back.”

> The “common knowledge” factor doesn’t refer to what the public was told of these incidents. It was information that he believes was shared among military officers who were stationed at locations where UFOs were allegedly responsible for disabling American missiles.

RogueThief7,fdjvjku,t1_fdhtzsk,"You don't know how how your milk is produced.

Yes, cows do give milk constantly, actually.

Cows won't stop lactating if the calf doesn't stop feeding. Lactation is a physiological response, it's not time dependent or driven by hormones. If you keep feeding a cow calories and keep milking it you will keep getting milk.

And no, milking does not take from what calves need. Firstly, the first few lactations don't contain any milk, they're colostrum. It's a kind of mucus substance, it's all antibodies and vitamins for the calf, almost zero milk. Secondly, cows produce far more milk than required and as stated previously, so long as they eat enough and keep getting stimulated, they keep lactating. So actually, calves get all the milk they need because humans just take the huge surpluses.

Helps if you actually read and learn about agribusiness rather than just digesting vegan propaganda on YouTube.

Yes, you are ignorant about it."

But once lab grown meat is available there will be no excuse for humans to continue murdering animals.

Wark_Kweh,fdhwyhd,t1_fdhqrjg,"I suspect I know more about cattle than you do. For starters, cows aren't artificially inseminated unless they are in estrous because that would be a waste of time and resources. While in estrous a cow will stand still to be bred by a bull, and they exhibit the same behavior during artificial insemination. And AI carries the benefit of avoiding the dangers inherent to an animal that weighs a literal ton mounting another animal that weighs slightly less. Safer for both animals.

Let's not pretend that the word rape here isn't being used specifically because it evokes a uniquely human evil with a uniquely human perception of sex. Artificial insemination of a cow isn't rape any more than artificial insemination of a human is rape. It's a clinical process used to mitigate certain dangers and increase certain probabilities."
roses269,fdhqd7v,t1_fdhpkas,Fun fact: Cows are often bred in the fall so they don't go into heat in the winter.  Because when they're in heat they friggin' mount each other and are more likely to slip on ice and break a leg.
roses269,fdky93f,t1_fdi28ac,If it makes you feel better some cows are kept for a long time.  I've known milking cows who are around 14 years old.  I also knew a cow who had about a two year retirement from milking before she was put down due to lameness.   She wasn't beefed out though (I swear that's the term for it) just put into the compost pile.
JackGlinsky,fdi48sd,t1_fdi28ac,"I mean, it depends on what kind of operation it is. No one wants to eat old, tough, flavorless meat. If it's a regular ranch or farm they could just keep the cow around. Plus it may still be able to breed."

If I know a company treats animals like crap before slaughtering them I probably just won't buy what they sell."

JackGlinsky,fdihmo3,t1_fdigikg,"Right, that's what I thought you were saying. I think the big issue here (and with other politics) is that people are very black and white about it. They think that just because the meat industry is cruel, that means there can't be a meat industry at all."
Macklinmore,fdiuc1g,t1_fditzuz,Well then she must be a really smart cow huh
RogueThief7,fdk4f4s,t1_fdjy3lo,"Actually, no.

You do not need to get a cow pregnant every year. As I said, lactation is a stimulation; it's not time dependent, it's not hormone dependent, so long as there is sufficient nourishment of the mother and unbroken stimuli of the mammary glands, they will continue to lactate.

Same for all mammals... Actually, don't quote me on that, there may be some animals which are an exception.

What I believe you're thinking of is peak production, i.e. Maximum yield. Yeild of lactation starts to fall off around a year, though it continues - to the best of our knowledge - pretty much indefinitely. The data we have thus far (from memory, so don't quote me) demonstrates that cows can maintain lactation for at least 4-5 years but due to profitability reasons this isn't done and due to the costs associated, studies have not been conducted to discover just how far a cow can lactate for until it just stops.

In that instance, yes, you are 100% correct. To maintain peak yield you would have to cycle your dairy cows yearly, as they do most often currently.

So good input."

They don't want animal food, it's a luxury and it's not healthy to eat daily. Why do you think Latinos (I myself am one) suffer from heart disease, obesity, and diabetes? Genetics only plays a small part, but diet is increasingly becoming the major factor. I have an uncle who is well off and he suffered a stroke and heart failure. That man has been athletic his whole life, but he chose to eat a Mexican diet full of red meat and seafood. His doctor told him to reduce his consumption or face a heart attack next.
Supplements are still needed, animal sources do not provide everything, and as for soy sausages, what's wrong with them? Are they not relatively healthier, more sustainable and can be fortified with additional vitamins and minerals? They also taste amazing (Beyond Sausage Hot Italian tastes ridiculously close to the real thing, it's creepy good!)."

As time passes we advance and don’t have to do things the way we used to. I understand where you’re coming from, I really do. I thought the exact same way for a very long time. The whole notion that you can’t get the same level of nutrients from alternatives is an absolute fabrication created by the meat industry, you can get just as much and more nourishment from a vegan diet without hurting any animals. 

Animals are tasty, no one is denying that. I’m not calling you a bad person for eating meat, I’m not even vegan and I eat meat sometimes. But the second that lab grown meat is indistinguishable and available I will never eat an animal ever again, there is no need to at all. “If it ain’t broke don’t fix it” doesn’t apply when there’s living things on the line.

But that is thier role. I respect cows greatly, sounds goofy but your talking about a animal that feeds millions by giving up it's life.  Its not a animal that should be trivialized by taking away its purpose.

It is food we need though."

What that means is that consuming dairy isn't inherently evil or anything, but if we want to change processes as a society to something we'd view as *more ethical* then that comes with a cost and that cost often comes in lower efficiency and thus often higher prices.

Interesting that you're a vet student. I'm a knowledge sponge, I soak up bits of disjointed information to create a very sparse web of general knowledge.

Most recent studies using more sensitive techniques for detecting B12 deficiency have found that 68% of vegetarians and 83% of vegans are B12 deficient, compared to just 5% of omnivores. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12816782

Fruits and Vegetables
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12064344
 
This is significant, because ferritin depletion is the first stage of iron deficiency. Moreover, although vegetarians often have similar iron intakes to omnivores on paper, it is more common for vegetarians (and particularly vegans) to be iron deficient. For example, this study of 75 vegan women in Germany found that 40% of them were iron deficient, despite average iron intakes that were above the recommended daily allowance.

many plant foods that contain zinc also contain phytate, which inhibits zinc absorption. Vegetarian diets tend to reduce zinc absorption by about 35% compared with omniovorous diet.
http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/633S.long
 
Thus, even when the diet meets or exceeds the RDA for zinc, deficiency may still occur. One study suggested that vegetarians may require up to 50% more zinc than omnivores for this reason.

yungheezy,fdkcghv,t1_fdkc134,">Leave them alone? From what? Humans? Other animals?

We leave them alone, obviously. Let nature do what it's going to do, but do not participate in cruelty where possible.

>They live with us even if we wanted to we cant leave them alone.

No, we cage them and deprive them of their liberty.

>Even vegans rely on animals for their fat,flesh, and byproducts Vaccinations are made with eggs and bovine serum, the device you are typing to me on is made with animal parts.

Yes. We do not live in a vegan world. Definition of veganism:

*A philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals*

**as far as is possible and practicable**

Is the important part

>Just because i eat animal products does not mean i approve of conventional agricultural practices

You buying animal products is you approving of them. If you truly don't approve, then don't continue to consume them. You cannot complain about something and do nothing, especially when the solution is so simple."
yungheezy,fdkirn6,t1_fdkhnh7,">If they go and buy produce from the supermarket they rely on the labor of millions of bees and the destruction of the environment via fertilizers and pesticides and tillage

Again, it's all about reducing harm where possible, not reducing ALL HARM.

>If you want to do a body count then I would say veganism is far worse than someone who sources there animal products

If you eat both animals and vegetables, you are contributing to both. If you only eat vegetables, you are only contributing to one of the problems. Absolutely ludicrous to say that eating Vegan means more animals die.

>Look up fish die offs

Look up 'fishing' and the idea of 'bycatch'. 40% of fish caught are collateral damage. We as a planet have fished 97% of pacific tuna stocks. Fishing kills more fish than anything else.

> im against using subsidized crops to feed animals that can live just as well if not better on pasture

So you are allowed to come up with a load of bullshit in response to veganism, but you can opt out of one MASSIVE aspect of the animal agriculture problem? Most people do not eat animals that have been pasture fed.

>I've seen plenty of livestock animals spend their entire lives Outdoors living live Bar Superior then their wild counterparts

Some animals live a decent life. The vast majority are beaten, caged and some are even skinned alive. The animal kingdom can be brutal, we don't have to be part of their abuse too.

>If I were a ruminant herbivore I would prefer to live in the Captivity of a human then risk being eaten ass first by a predator

Apart from, presumably the bit where you get murdered after a few weeks/months?

>If you really cared about animals you do understand that animal rights calls for the prioritization of animal abolition as opposed to improving the quality of an animal's life.

You seem to have mixed up 'abolitionism' and ... genocide?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_(animal_rights)

Most vegans would want animal livestock numbers to slowly reduce until animal agriculture was no longer a thing. Animals wouldn't be culled, they would be released, and let nature find it's own balance.

animal welfare + animal rights"
WikiTextBot,fdkisbp,t1_fdkirn6,"**Abolitionism (animal rights)**

Abolitionism or abolitionist veganism is the animal rights based opposition to all animal use by humans. Abolitionism maintains that all sentient beings, humans or nonhumans, share a basic right: the right not to be treated as the property of others. Abolitionist vegans emphasise that animal products require treating animals as property or resources and that animal products are not necessary for human health in modern societies. Abolitionists believe that everyone who can live vegan is therefore morally obligated to be vegan.Abolitionists generally oppose movements that seek to make animal use more humane or to abolish specific forms of animal use, since they believe this undermines the movement to abolish all forms of animal use.

I don't think I've eaten that well and that tasty of food ever before. It's definitely a learning process but once you know what you're doing and know some basics to cook it's a pure joy :D"
explosivcorn,fdhouxj,t1_fdhorwe,"Practice my guy, you'll burn many many more things but cooking is really fun and rewarding when you get your first dishes down"
eff5_,fdhuaw4,t1_fdhorwe,"You'll have to learn eventually when you're not under your parents roof, so might as well practice now!"
GuillotineGash,fdic7ph,t1_fdhorwe,"Honestly, cooking is so much easier when you don't have to deal with all the worries of meat! No cutting board contamination, minimum internal temperatures or risking getting sick. Animal products are the first things to go bad in the fridge, too. Many veggie alternatives just need to be reheated and you're good to go! 

I get most of my vegan recipes from Pinterest, but take a quick look at (and maybe show your parents):

/r/vegan

/r/veganrecipes

/r/veganbaking

/r/veganmemes :)

If you/your parents have a favourite recipe they like and make often, I'd love to try and help convert the recipe for you! Best of luck!"

aevye,fdji254,t1_fdikhrc,"hey, i'm 17 and i still live with my parents as well. i turned vegan by cooking for myself (im honestly really bad but im slowly getting better haha). after they saw how important it is for me, they started accepting it >< its still a long process until they'll 100% understand my moral stances but it's a start. good luck! also, veganuary is running rn, you can still participate i think. cruelty free recipes for 30 days :)"

TheSmex,fdjlexz,t1_fdhqdz2,You can block users on Reddit. After you come to a thread like this and block a few you notice a lot less of the idiots shouting about cow rape and such. It's just a very vocal minority so its not to hard to block most of them.
darkfight13,fdi88hm,t1_fdhqdz2,"Ruind this and other similar post's.

And they wonder why people find them annoying."

SarcasmisEasier,fdhu7al,t1_fdhqdz2,"It's the only reason I hate seeing cow gifs and pictures. I also like that the first response you got was someone blathering about ""you should go vegan"".

Edit: I just want to point out, since a couple people thought this needed downvotes, I think both sides are idiots and annoying. The people that come in and comment ""looks like good steak"" are just is dumb as those that comment ""this is why the world should be vegan"", or ""I'm going vegan now."""

You brigade on Reddit but join the real world for a second, vegan kfc lol, capitalism is fucking your cause"
genderish,fdjx6t6,t1_fdjwkfb,"Fair point, the end goal is that they are bred back to a wild state and released, or allowed to slowly die out, seeing how mutilated and unnatural human breeding vaused them to be. So maybe when this gif is posted in the vegan future the comments will be about how terrible we were to these cute animals. But at least that's not yelling?"

genderish,fdhtdct,t1_fdhsil9,"Not even you believe that's even kind of a remote equivalence. And even if that was the case, veganism is about doing the least harm, and a lot fewer plants will be killed if people go vegan, because of trophic levels.

Is your argument really ""cant achieve perfection therefore I shouldnt try to improve""?"
DownOnTheUpside,fdjmyui,t1_fdjlqfv,Gurantee you couldn't watch it
Schnauzerbutt,fdjxw8b,t1_fdjx6t6,"They'll just start yelling about how we've unfairly bred plants to be unnaturally large for our own selfish purposes and how we should only eat processed minerals from dirt because farming is cruel to wildlife, insects and the poor, mutated plants. Trust me, too many people just enjoy feeling superior to others for the self righteous yelling to stop, plus vegan diets aren't very good for brain health as it turns out."
Ihearrhapsody,fdjrsu3,t1_fdjo5vx,Hmmm a little off base but you got the spirit
JessicaMurawski,fdjw9dn,t1_fdjvwdz,"Facts don’t give a fuck about your feelings. And neither do I. I don’t feel bad for killing animals. I’m satisfied knowing that the animal will be feeding my family and it was food I grew myself. Just try guilt tripping me more because it’s not working. 

If you think it’s murder, I dare you to try taking someone that kills animals to court for murder. As soon as they hear you say you’re charging them for animal “murder” and you say that you feel like it’s murder, that case will be over and you’ll probably be sent to the loony bin."

genderish,fdjwqw8,t1_fdjw9dn,"I literally just said idgaf about the legal definition. Implying I know what the legal definition is, which you could have deduced meant id know that legally they wouldn't be in trouble for murder. That's why I'm on reddit and not in a court room. 

And I find you to be a monstrous person for feeling no empathy towards these animals. Does that feeling extend to cats and dogs? Would you eat them without remorse?"
DownOnTheUpside,fdjnyou,t1_fdjn4oi,Funny how smug you're acting when you're just proving my point.
Schnauzerbutt,fdkf7fz,t1_fdjy3lj,Proof?
JessicaMurawski,fdjx55w,t1_fdjwqw8,"The only animal I would never eat is cats. Anything else is fair game. And oh boo fucking hoo. I’m glad that my diet triggers you that much. Keep saying how horrible I am. I’ve heard it all from assholes like you. You’re not hurting my feelings any. And the more you insult me in your effort to make me go vegan, the more meat I’ll eat just to piss you the fuck off. It’s people like you that give all vegans a bad name and make people hate your miserable guts. 

Vegans: I don’t understand why people hate us and don’t want to go vegan!
Also vegans: *bitch at everyone, calling them a murderer and a horrible person for what they eat, scream and whine and cry every time they see a farm animal, etc*"
cinnamonsnuggle,fdhv81y,t1_fdhv0bg,"I know not every vegan is like you so I won't lump y'all together but hot damn it's the sad ones that are the most vocal but I guess that goes for every group. Clearly I hit a nerve with ya bro, hope your day gets better. :)))"

You got this shit backwards, but you meat eaters do seem to get upset when you realize you might have been doing immoral things for years. Check out innuendo studios ""why are you so angry jack"" on youtube to better understand that phenomenon. Its pretty neat and a good way for you to catch yourself falling into that trap.

redherring96,fdk4a1b,t1_fdk3x8a,"1. not everyone on earth is going to go vegan all at once. so asking “what will happen to the farm animals alive now?” is not a realistic question to ask. as more people go vegan the demand for meat will decrease, therefore the supply will gradually decrease as well. that is the goal. i know that the earth will never be 100% vegan. 

2. the vast majority of crops are grown to feed livestock that are killed for food. so, going vegan will reduce the amount of crops we need to grow to feed the population, and therefore less small animals will be killed overall."

redherring96,fdi7xjl,t1_fdhuodx,"because it’s a vid of a cute cow, and most of the people saying she’s cute are also likely meat eaters. so, i am saying that if they think cows are cute and want them to have good lives, then they should be vegan."

redherring96,fdkjhev,t1_fdk7bry,"i feel like you are deliberately misunderstanding my point. it’s not ok to harm animals, but sometimes, harming them is inevitable — like when it comes to harvesting crops. however, we can REDUCE the amount of harm by going vegan, since the majority of crops grown are used to feed livestock. less livestock = less crops grown = less small animals killed. 

and again, i feel like you are misunderstanding my second point. we breed cows into existence to be killed. eating less cows means we will breed less, so there will be fewer cows. there is a huge surplus of billions of cows currently, so i don’t know why you think there being a bit less is a bad thing. it’s not like they’re going to go extinct."

Aegon_Targaryen_VII,fdh77qj,t1_fdh6fz4,"People like to think of being vegetarian as an all-or-nothing thing, but doing it by increments is seriously underrated. I started by giving up meat just for Lent, thinking I’d go back after a few weeks, but it was way easier than I realized. Over the years, I just gradually made fewer exceptions for myself, and I eased in to being vegetarian. 

If you care about stuff like this, maybe try being vegetarian for one meal a day, or two meals a day - something like that. There’s nothing wrong with trying part-way."

That aside, for a omnivorous diet not only would I have to ""kill"" plants for my diet, I would also have to ""kill"" plants for the animals diet that I would also have to kill. Do you know how much plants are fed to livestock? It's not that we don't produce enough food to feed the entire worlds population, it's just that we export food out of those countries for our livestock in which human children die of starvation. 

So if you care about either plants, animals OR humans, a plant based diet would still mean the least amount of suffering among all groups."

Samoyed, Afghan hounds, hairless breeds like Xoloitzcuintle or American hairless terrier, other curly haired breeds besides poodles, drop coat dogs like Maltese/Lowchen/Havanese/Lhasa apso/ etc. Ignore doodles, they are rarely actually low allergen. 

My ex boyfriend was SEVERELY allergic to dog dander. Would make his asthma skyrocket and he’d break out. Zero issues with poodles and happily lived with one.

Note for knowledge: hypoallergenic means less likely to cause a reaction, not “will not cause a reaction.” There are definitely dogs like I listed above that are much less likely to cause allergic reactions but each person is individual. :)

Shits_Kittens,fdt311l,t1_fdqrxfs,"Ok, let me jump in here real quick and offer you some insight.

> That animal is almost as smart as us, and shouldn’t be made to do tricks for our amusement.

This is exactly the purpose of asking dolphins to present these behaviors... or what you call tricks. This is especially the case for behaviors that do not come naturally to them. They need to be mentally and physically stimulated, and given challenges to maintain good health. You’re absolutely right, they are smart af, and what do you think they would do if they just had to swim in their pools all day with absolutely no enrichment? Wouldn’t be fun for any living creature having nothing stimulating about their day. To add to that, they are basically muscle, topped with blubber, but mostly muscle. It is very important to make sure they get enough exercise every single day, hence the theatrics you see in their high flying leaps that are common in aquatic facility shows. Speaking of shows, this is how facilities that house them afford to take care of them. It pays for their food, veterinary care, environmental enrichment, their water that is meticulously maintained. By providing a crowd an opportunity to see these animals up close, you’re doing many things. You’re educating an audience on a species they may never see in their lifetime otherwise, you’re promoting conservation of their wild counterparts, all while providing these very smart and very strong animals essential enrichment and exercise. And finally... do you think for one second these 400-600 pound animals could be forced into doing anything they don’t want to? The reason why trainers use the phrase “ask for a behavior” is because that’s exactly what they’re doing. If the animals don’t want to participate, they don’t have to. They can fuck off and do whatever the hell it is that they want. And for all of you wondering, “so does that mean they don’t get fed?” Absolutely not. In every single accredited facility out there, you will NEVER find trainers withholding food. What in the world would be the purpose of that? Do you have to starve your dog to get him to shake your hand? Of course not. Positive reinforcement, never punishment, is what builds good relationships with these animals, so that when they have veterinary checkups, they willingly participate in their own healthcare. In the event the animals don’t feel like participating in a training session, show, guest program, whatever, they will absolutely have that food made up in another session. No big deal.

> we need to stop housing aquatic animals with habitats we can’t realistically emulate.

I won’t disagree with you. I’m sure in the animal care world my stance on breeding programs being unnecessary may not be a popular one. Enough animals are stranded and unable to be returned to the ocean (this is decided by the government, not the rehabilitating facility in the US) to really necessitate breeding. 

Finally, are there places that are shit and a shame to the industry? Unfortunately yes, I would know... I worked for one as both a marine mammal trainer and stranding and rehabilitation technician. The utter disregard for the safety of staff and animals, along with shady business practices were absolutely my reason for leaving. That is why accreditation is so important. Accredited facilities are held to the highest standards and must maintain such standards. This is why if you are concerned about the welfare of the animal, and you’re in the US, look for the [AZA](https://www.aza.org/what-is-accreditation) logo on their website. One thing that I can tell you though, is that even at the shit facilities the people caring for these animals would risk their lives to make sure they get the best care possible. No one’s delusioned into believing these animals love them, but their caregivers love them and may even stay at one of those bad facilities just to ensure for their own conscience that the animals are ok. They get paid garbage to do so, even though they are required to have a 4 year degree... we’re talking starting pay as low as $9.00/hr, and that is AFTER you’ve interned for 3 months, 40 hours/week for free, which you only got because you first were a volunteer for countless hours in some animal care related role. 

I am happy to answer any questions that you have. I truly believe the more transparency the better."

Status_Flux,fdr46qj,t1_fdqvj64,"Not end of story. There are still reasons it might be a good idea. For one, some species are at high risk in the wild and only have a good chance at survival through artificial habitats. For another, they provide a public service by putting humans in direct contact with animals. People will simply care a lot more about animals that they see up close than those they only see on TV or read about in books. Also they provide a lot of opportunity for study so we can better learn about their needs and capabilities. Would you even know how smart a dolphin is if none had ever been placed in captivity? Of course their habitats should be as high quality as possible and the benefits of bringing them in should be weighed against the downsides of taking them out of the wild, but the issue is not as black and white as you make it out to be."
Shits_Kittens,fdt4yv7,t1_fdrotqa,"You are very very wrong. None of these animals are starved or forced to do anything they don’t want to. Not in the United States, at least.

Is captivity ideal? No, but please don’t go around propagating a myth that all facilities torture and starve animals. That is simply not the case. If you’d like to know more, please see my comment on the parent thread."
BeholdTheCrazedFiend,fdsf1bl,t1_fdsexk3,She's uh...how to put this politely...batshit crazy.
lollapaloozafork,fdthas3,t1_fdsmzi6,"But at this point “dogs” are a severely domesticated breed and most couldn’t live without humans feeding and caring for them. 


These dolphins are taken from an environment where they thrive, or genetically identical to those who could live significantly better lives in the wild.


Basically dogs are happy and these dolphins are probably depressed as fuck."
Pwnysaurus_Rex,fdra3s8,t1_fdr98zw,I just figured this issue of all things is as close to cut and dry as it gets. People still find a way to take offense. I hate this timeline
Pwnysaurus_Rex,fdqtayk,t1_fdqt7cb,Wut?
Pwnysaurus_Rex,fdqtyb2,t1_fdqtlx6,"Oh my fucking god. Nothing about the trick in this gif is relevant to my point. Anytime I see a dolphin in an aquarium doing silly tricks I say the same thing. 

There have been countless studies on the intelligence of these animals including the ability to recognize themselves in a mirror, mourn dead relatives, and even have regional accents with how they communicate. Their intelligence is almost as high as ours. I did not see this, think the dolphin is reading and then come to this conclusion"
fireinthemountains,fds2jog,t1_fdqtlx6,"I understand that it’s easy to assume people are assuming too much into an animal, because plenty of that happens with less intelligent (trained) animals, it shows up in reddit comments all the time. However, for the level of self-assuredness you have about this, you really need to do some research on this, before making assumptions on whether or not people are anthropomorphizing dolphins based on some tricks. There’s plenty of research that confirms dolphins and whales as being intelligent and self-aware. Some countries even classify them legally as “non-human persons.”  
This is not speculation, it is not based on them being trained to do tricks. It’s scientific fact backed up by plenty of biological/neurological, psychological testing and research. Did you know they even have a proportionally larger emotional center in the brain than we do? They are also one of the very few species to have spindle neurons, which appear in every highly intelligent creature (including elephants).  
  
I worked for a coastal studies center, that specifically focused on cetaceans (whales etc)."
crash5545,fdr9d46,t1_fdqwm0w,"The dudes going to pick his battles as they see fit. They clearly care about how dolphins are treated in captivity and wants to dispel the common belief that dolphins do great in aquariums. 

Also, saying he shouldn’t worry about one thing when another worse thing is happening is a logic fallacy. “Fallacy of relative privation”, if it does you to look it up. I agree there are worse things in the world, but that could be argued of literally anything."
bxzidff,fdrgol8,t1_fdqwm0w,"You wouldn't care about Honry the Dolphin because there are pets that get hit by their owners daily.

Pwnysaurus_Rex,fdquvqz,t1_fdqtnr5,"Humans are forced to go to school and hang out with other humans from 7am to around 3pm, 5 days a week, 9 months out of the year, for 13 years. 

Is it really your position that forcing an animal out of its natural habitat to live in a tub and do tricks for is is the same as our education system? Is that really what you fucking think?"
jknew,fdt61kb,t1_fdqtnr5,"An exercise designed to enrich said humans, introducing them to the hard-won knowledge of literally millions of hours of effort.

Pwnysaurus_Rex,fdqubpo,t1_fdqttem,What the fuck is your point? Are you saying people suffer so we shouldn’t give a shit about animals? This has got to be the dumbest response I’ve ever seen
tjackson87,fdr2bmb,t1_fdqttem,"Agency is the key distinction. Once humans are adults, they can fuck off and do whatever they want, and the only ones forcing humans to do anything are their parents, who typically are doing it for their well being  Animals don't get to make a choice ever, and humans are making the decisions for them for the humans' pleasure."

Pwnysaurus_Rex,fdqwmep,t1_fdqvoje,"Jesus Christ.

BitsAndBobs304,fdtvo6f,t1_fds77bv,do you have proof it's not true?
Shits_Kittens,fdu5a3o,t1_fdu1e66,"I’m sorry, what? I’m saying the word “someone” in a general statement about your actions... not myself. As in, a person on the internet with professional knowledge and experience in the field (hello, it’s me) tries to be transparent, and offers you information to try to assuage your concerns about marine parks, and you shoot that person down (yup, that’s me again) without even trying to learn something. See, it’s about your actions, not me trying to refer to myself in the third person. Is that easier to understand?"
Pwnysaurus_Rex,fdqytx4,t1_fdqyp38,Seriously I can’t with how irrelevant some of those responses were.
tjackson87,fdw1fif,t1_fdtvg48,"People can change their religion or country, or go get land and provide for themselves (lots of people still do this in Montana where we lived). Again, agency is the key. We have choices. They may be limited because we were born at a certain time and place, but all creatures have to do the labor required to survive. The dolphin will be forced to spend it's entire life in a tiny box that it can never leave where it can never make a decision for itself, and it will be forced to do things for the pleasure of the humans that had the freewill to come pay to watch it do tricks."
TheTurtleBear,fdu7be5,t1_fdtvo6f,"School serves the purpose of educating and encouraging the growth of the students. Aquatic parks serve the primary purpose of caging intelligent creatures for the entertainment of humans

You're either incredibly dense or insane to think they're comparable"
Pwnysaurus_Rex,fdqzs3w,t1_fdqzj2d,This has got to be the dumbest response. Please go away.
fireinthemountains,fds2w1z,t1_fdqzj2d,It takes like ten minutes of googling to find the examples of these captive animals expressing suffering.
Blizz360,fdr8n2p,t1_fdqzj2d,"You really wanna go and put yourself in the camp of the jackass above? Listen I’m sure you’re a nice person, and have made the world a better place through some actions in your life, but please, shut the fuck up."
Shits_Kittens,fdunoa3,t1_fdueu3a,"Ok Karen, here’s a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/tippytaps/comments/emrfdd/cute_dolphin_tippy_taps/fdt311l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) to my in depth comment in response to the parent comment of this thread. It goes into far greater detail then what we’ve discussed here. I’m sure you won’t read it, because you don’t really want information that doesn’t fit your narrative. While animal care professionals are working their asses off everyday to educate the public on the importance of conservation, working insane hours when rehabilitating stranded mammals, all while working for near nothing... what exactly are you doing besides spewing activist propaganda? 

And while I don’t expect you to believe that I have worked as both a marine mammal trainer and stranding and rehabilitation technician, I’m not going to doxx myself just to appease an internet troll. However, I’d be happy to provide you with some more helpful links that you’re not going to read:

[Scientific literature highlighting how marine mammals are trained](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stan_Kuczaj/publication/265683472_It_Takes_More_Than_Fish_The_Psychology_of_Marine_Mammal_Training/links/5418480f0cf2218008bf3351/It-Takes-More-Than-Fish-The-Psychology-of-Marine-Mammal-Training.pdf). Please be sure to look over the food deprivation and punishment sections. I know those are the ones you’re most interested in. There are plenty more papers, so let me know if I have to google for you some more.

[Requirements for an AZA accreditation ](https://assets.speakcdn.com/assets/2332/aza-accreditation-standards.pdf) 

[International Marine Animal Trainer’s Association](https://www.imata.org/), for a look at what goes into training and what is expected of trainers.

In case you’d like to familiarize yourself with the [Animal Welfare Act](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_welfare/downloads/AC_BlueBook_AWA_508_comp_version.pdf) to see that facilities are actually being held to standards and undergo inspections.

[NOAA Fisheries stranding information](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/insight/understanding-marine-wildlife-stranding-and-response#what-is-a-marine-wildlife-stranding?) for a light read on the in depth work that MANY marine park trainers participate in, in order to get these animals back to their natural habitat... and for the record, the government decides when animals cannot be released, not the rehabilitating facility.

And where are YOUR sources? Are they reputable or just activist organizations that tell you what to think? And what animals are being released into the ocean? It is irresponsible and inhumane to just toss an animal with no survival skills back into the wild, and I can guarantee you those animals are not tossed into the wild when a facility shuts down. They are transferred to a different facility. And NO ONE in the United States wants to pluck whales or dolphins out of the ocean, nor is it even legal here. Those purchasing from the likes of Taiji are all Asian countries, so please feel free to redirect your anger elsewhere."

It doesn't understand the gestures for ""yes"" or ""no"", but it can recognize materials and has been trained to do a specific action when it sees those materials in relation to a specific shape and then to do that little happy dance when somebody puts the thing in the right hole. 

It's doesn't understand the context of what it's doing, and it's whole celebration is just another trained action. It's just a captive creature following commands for treats."

Lawlenne,fdokepf,t3_emdgz0,"Actually, why do dogs do that? It seems they always do that when you scratch them on the back legs."
icouldeatthemoon,fdpl3sl,t1_fdokepf,Vet tech here.  It is a reflex caused by itchy skin/ears.  This dog needs some allergy relief!  Cats have a similar reflex too.
SaiyanInTraining,fdol3gg,t1_fdokepf,I think it's a reflex. Like the knee jerk reflex we experience when a doctor tests this by slightly hitting the front part of your knee with a reflex hammer and your lower leg bolts upwards.
archy000,fdosa25,t1_fdokepf,"I assume it's because they're just itchy.

My dog occasionally starts scratching the air when I'm petting her. I discovered it happens when I touch a place she can't reach. So I try and find the itchy spot by scratching around her back while checking the feet to see when it starts to move. Once it starts to move I give her a good scratch on that spot until she stops moving her feet."
spelunk_in_ya_badonk,fdpyuna,t1_fdokepf,"Itchy dog, likely allergies"
Stegs75,fdpmtu8,t1_fdpl3sl,Wow that makes sense! I’ve ever only seen this in my friends pup and he has skin issues.
RedstoneArsenal,fdq83pd,t1_fdpl3sl,"I've had a cat just start, for a lack of a better word, stupidly looking around and licking the air until I stopped. Comepletely normal cat, until I give it scritches. Would that be similar?"
Xeillan,fdphg9m,t1_fdp7p81,"Odd, mine literally comes over for me to scratch areas he cant reach."
TripleSecretSquirrel,fdpkes2,t1_fdp7p81,"I’ve read this too, but every time I’m petting or scratching a dog and their leg starts to kick, they genuinely seem to enjoy it based on body language, so now I’m not sure what to believe!!"
TriggsIsMe,fdq994u,t1_fdq83pd,Yes
icouldeatthemoon,fdsvq9c,t1_fdq83pd,"Yep!  Very similar.  Some cats will lick the air, some kick their leg, and some will chew whatever is in front of them!  Usually it's their own legs, but watch out!  They have very little control over it!  I've been scratched pretty good by a cat that had itchy ears, and all we did was look down them with an otoscope.  Usually when cats have it, it's a very powerful reflex."
amfoolishness,fdzcpra,t1_fdq83pd,"Same here but miniature Schnauzer getting scritches on mid-lower back. He doesn't lick the air, just stupidly looks around and then lifts his head like good is directly speaking to him 😂 until he can't see any ""higher back"" 😂"
BookKit,fdqdjxw,t1_fdpkes2,"It really depends on the dog. I wouldn't try to trigger that scratch relfex in a dog I'm unfamiliar with, but if you know your dog's body language, then you're probably fine. It's like humans and tickling. Some people like it; some people tolerate it; some people hate it. Whatever way they feel, they tend to let you know.

It also matter **who** does it. It's positive and fun when my three year old niece starts a play tickle fight with me. If a random stranger came up and tried to tickle me, it would not be okay. At most, I'd punch them. At the least, I'd be creeped out and try to get away."
Servali_,fdqecos,t1_fdqdjxw,What kind of psychopath likes being tickled???
BookKit,fdqgjws,t1_fdqecos,"Likes tickling... maybe that wasn't the best word choice. Perhaps a better way to put it would be the some people see it as play, like play wrestling, and enjoy the interaction. Some people absolutely hate it. 

I don't think any dog likes to itch, but some dogs like being groomed and the interaction of getting scritches more than they dislike the little bit of itch from hitting spot that triggers the scratch reflex."
sliplover,fdqh7um,t1_fdqecos,I think you meant masochist.
shimokoo,fdoiu4d,t3_emdgz0,its like that nintendogs part of the game where you groom ur dog and all the sparkles and tippy taps intensifies and ur just mashing on the stylus bc they good bois

abrookman1987,fdopx6u,t3_emdgz0,"You’re stimulating a nerve.  Doesn’t mean he likes it, one of mine does the same if you scratch his hip"
diehardgiraffe,fdow6ie,t1_fdou51s,"Depends on the context. They have a spot that you can always touch/scratch that gets their leg going? You're probably annoying them.  
  
My dog gets itchy during certain times of the year and will help guide my hand to the itchy spots, when I hit it the leg goes until the itch is taken care of. If I stop before she's done I get the long paw of the law so I assume she enjoys it."
abrookman1987,fdoup9c,t1_fdou51s,It’s like when someone/something brushes the hair on your neck and you do that shudder thing.
cosworthsmerrymen,fdpgejh,t1_fdou51s,Do you have any sources for that at all?
youngsmeg,fdp4k0o,t1_fdou51s,"Thanks for the vet lesson, Dolittle."
abrookman1987,fdoywad,t1_fdow6ie,Long paw of the law may be my new favourite phrase.
cosworthsmerrymen,fdpglsz,t1_fdp413r,Wouldn't the animal just move out of the way? Most people don't hold their dogs in a stranglehold while they pet/scratch them so they dog would just move away if they weren't into it.
cosworthsmerrymen,fdpmsg7,t1_fdphwvz,"Ok, I understand what you are saying now. However, they are talking about scratching their belly. Not an itchy back due to dry skin or whatever else. My sister's mini Aussie is itchy right now to the weather change and she loves it when I get home because I'll scratch her. She will do it herself by wiggling around on her back to scratch it. She loves it. I don't hold her when I scratch her and she activity comes back to me to scratch her.

I understand what you are saying but I think they are different things that are happening."

Though if she doesn't tippy tap like this gorgeous pooch she wags her tail so hard that her back end goes back and fourth so wide it stops her from walking straight. When she does it we call her Little Miss Wagglebottom.

hannahftw,fecjphx,t3_eocm8b,"No responses from OP yet but some asking what this dog has - I'm a veterinary student and think it is likely cerebellar hypoplasia. If it is, this dog is in no way suffering and will have a happy life despite some mobility issues! It is a disorder where the cerebellum in the brain doesn't fully develop - it is seen more frequently in cats and you can sometimes find these special need kitties in shelters looking for homes. As I said, it typically does not lessen an animal's quality of life, and I encourage people to adopt special need animals like this (or other special needs if they feel qualified to handle it). Thanks for sharing your adorable pup, OP."

MpMeowMeow,fdob5bq,t1_fdnrim4,And people still have no business buying them as pets. Just because they're not classified as endangered yet doesn't mean it's okay to have them as pets. Stick to domesticated animals.

turquoisebee,fdok2q5,t1_fdobpmv,It’s not six degrees of separation if the people selling non-endangered wildlife as pets are the same folks selling the endangered ones.
thrownowayyo,fdp4ac4,t3_embjh4,"Bush babies should not be pets, it is morally wrong. They have a complex diet as primate omnivores, they are nocturnal, they naturally live in large groups, they are endangered and many are stolen for the pet trade, they need an environment that has plenty of climbing space and is like their native environment in Africa, they are highly intelligent and need a lot of enrichment, as primates good vets are hard to find and they are at risk of catching human illnesses. It is practically impossible to provide a nocturnal primate with the care a enrichment nessecary. Typically they live about 10 years in captivity and will have to be diapered the entire time to avoid them marking all over the house. They cannot be happily kept in a cage. Primates have distinct personalities, getting a bushbaby is almost like getting a nocturnal baby that can climb the walls and will never grow up."
