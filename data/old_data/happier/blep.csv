 But I also just looked it up and it can apparently mean happiness or stress as well. So kind of like purring."

EverybodyGetsCheese,fdqg6d9,t1_fdpl3nf,"My local vet told me that since she did so well that she could have food and water right away.  I was told to keep her ""calm"" but...she's a kitten so that was difficult.  The best I could do was put her in a room with food, water, litter and nothing to play with unfortunately.  And I had to keep her locked away from her older brother because they played rough.  They told me to call them or make an appointment if it started to look infected.  I saw it BARELY start to turn colors so I started treating her with peroxide/neosporin and the infection went away and she healed up within about a week.  The vet said to get a cone if she seems to be licking/picking at it a lot.  I only caught mine licking it once and that was right after the neosporin. (stopped her of course)  - um....I think that's about it?  Be careful with the wound.  Don't pull on it at all."

flaminglauren,fe98sr5,t3_eo4vqm,"For those wondering and commenting on Bailey‚Äôs nails: 

My boyfriend and I regularly put nail caps on both of our young kitties because, for the time being, they live with him in his parents newly furnished home. He and his parents both own a lot of leather furniture and the nail caps have done a great job at keeping the fixtures scratch-free. They do fall off with the regular shedding cycle that cat‚Äôs claws undergo, and sometimes the kitties do manage to chew them off, though that has become less frequent with time and practice. Bailey here has a variety of colors on his nails because the caps we ordered off of amazon came in a rainbow assortment, which was a questionable choice in retrospect, and we just replace them with random colors as they fall off. My boyfriend just ordered a new pack of all black nail caps the other day to keep the nails consistent. Bad manicures will soon be a thing of the past. 

To be clear, these nail caps are completely safe to apply, wear, and digest if they do bite them off and swallow them. We did our research. And believe it or not, the cats are still able to use feline novelties like a scratching post and cardboard scratch boards. It‚Äôs just probably a little less satisfying for them. The relocation of the cats to a space where nail caps are not required is not in the current foreseeable future, but my boyfriend and I predict that the caps are most likely  not going to be a permanent fixture. We consider them a temporary solution for now. This is obviously much safer and humane than doing something as terrible as declawing our lil fur babies. 

TLDR: Nail caps are safe, albeit a little annoying and tacky looking at times."
Dunksterp,fe92uy8,t3_eo4vqm,"Why have you painted your cats claws?

MjrSkillz,fe93wct,t1_fe92uy8,Plastic caps instead of cutting the claws.
