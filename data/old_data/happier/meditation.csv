Lordarshyn,emb9qw,top_level,"So I did Sam Harris' intro course on waking up.

After that I decided to try my hand at metta meditation. Didn't feel much.

Then today, his daily meditation was metta. For the entire 20 minutes session, I felt frustrated. It felt fake. Felt like nonsense.

Then he had me turn it into myself for the last minute.

I began to cry. Then cry some more. Then felt myself laughing and crying at the same time. I didn't know what to do with these emotions!

I was bullied so heavily as a kid. I never felt worthy of love, especially not self love. I've always kept myself closed off.

Suddenly looking in at myself and seeing myself as a being worthy of love and well being... It just overflowed me with emotion. I had never seen myself in that light. Ever. 

I have had depression my whole life. I think I made a life changing breakthrough today. I just needed to share my experience with someone. Thanks for listening.

Edit: I don't even have the words for the love and support you all are giving me here. It's amazing. Thank you all so much and I love all of you too. 

As for the guy talking about ISIS. He got butthurt over getting downvoted in another sub, and is following me around reddit and threatening to dox me. I hope he finds peace, love and acceptance too."
stratint,fdnhedu,t3_emb9qw,You are definitely loveable. Thank you for loving yourself.
TinManCeski,fdnlbvr,t1_fdnkkl5,All life is capable of love and lovable. This is unconditional and without judgement.
DoctorStephenStark,fdny1bc,t1_fdnkkl5,"Since you got downvoted so much, here have my upvote. And no neither you nor the op is unloveable"
megabus69,fdpxb46,t1_fdnkkl5,"You're lovable. You're human. The homeless man is human with a broken past. He's loveable. Some people just need time to peel off the layers an slayers of masks they've hidden behind for years to become acceptable in society eyes, or to not care what others think about them. We're all led by our ego, trying to protect ourselves and sometimes you get lost in that.
You are loved. You are loveable. Message me if you want to explore how and why together x"
imdad_bot,fdnkkwr,t1_fdnkkl5,"Hi just thinking about myself, I'm Dadüë®"
blowmystraw,fdohj0z,t1_fdnkkl5,Why would you even comment that dude. I feel like you might have a lot of self hatred for yourself you should try to meditate sometime man. Learn to love yourself before you can love anyone else.
lvcv2020,fdp61g4,t1_fdnkkl5,"Calm down, jelly bean ;\*"
Zzeellddaa,fdp92ir,t1_fdnkkl5,"I got turned on to stoicism.  Take a look at it and see if it helps you see yourself differently.  


Most people are insecure and abuse and hurts others to feel better. 

Most people feel shitty about themselves as well.   You are not alone in this.


Upvote for you."
Crushmonster123,fdqbuza,t1_fdnkkl5,"Everyone is loveable, even you."
Openpentagon,fduo6uj,t1_fdny1bc,Just cuz This is like a tribe and they feel im attacking their ideology. They Have concluded That there is no way that someone could be unloveable not even hypothetically.
imdad_bot,fdnklx8,t1_fdnkkwr,"Hi Dadüë®, I'm Dadüë®"
Andynym,fdnmptp,t1_fdnlsr9,"Pity requires judgement. Compassion, empathy, and love do not. It is possible to extend these traits to all living beings unconditionally. When this seems impossible, I find that usually it is due to a lack of self love, which is where we all have to start."
bbyflesh,fdnqbx5,t1_fdnlsr9,this is such a strange comment... usually homeless people are victims to a cruel society that left them impoverished. i don‚Äôt know why you would assume a homeless person is a bad person. if a homeless person is being/acting ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù then they probably have a mental illness that may not be diagnosed and that they don‚Äôt have the resources to get treatment for. a person in that situation definitely deserves at the bare minimum love and kindness and compassion.
TinManCeski,fdnm42r,t1_fdnlsr9,"Yes, I do love them.

I may keep my distance to protect them and myself, but that is how I will choose to love them in that moment. My family brings food to homeless people all the time and it's painful to see some of them with mental conditions that prevent us from getting close enough to offer them food, but that does not mean I do not love them and care for their well-being. It is not pity."
13stevensonc,fdnrvzb,t1_fdnlsr9,You really don‚Äôt understand the word ‚Äúunconditional‚Äù huh buddy?
aaron0043,fdodmpy,t1_fdnklx8,I‚Äòm in love with this bot
Seek_Equilibrium,fdpt209,t1_fdnklx8,I‚Äôm sad that this didn‚Äôt trigger an infinite regress.
vincitopusme,fdnp4za,t1_fdnmptp,Beautiful sentiment
beto_747,fdorfoa,t1_fdnqbx5,"If anyone deserves and needs our love desperately, it‚Äôs the homeless."
imfookinlegalmate,fdtfkw9,t1_fdpt209,"Hi sad that this didn't trigger an infinite regress, I'm Dad ü§™"
13stevensonc,fdnrys3,t1_fdnmk9h,Yes.
pepushe,fdnrb78,t1_fdnn64k,Can you stop posting?
Andynym,fdnnht4,t1_fdnn64k,Do you think it‚Äôs impossible to get angry at someone you love?
positivepeoplehater,fdpfei1,t1_fdnrb78,Is there a way to report people? Tried their profile but can‚Äôt find anything.
qpv,fdphz3f,t1_fdpfei1,"You can report the comments they make, mods take it from there"
13stevensonc,fdnsiz7,t1_fdnrxp9,I love you :)
Openpentagon,fdntahu,t1_fdnsiz7,Great
Bigbean88,fdnje1i,t3_emb9qw,It‚Äôs so simple yet so hard for so many of us to accept. We are all worthy of love. We are all ‚Äúenough‚Äù. It seems quite easy to offer unconditional compassionate love to others but hard to accept that we are just one of ‚Äúthe others‚Äù and just as worthy.
Almost-Batman,fdnjhl2,t3_emb9qw,"Thats awesome man!

You gotta remember that feeling next time you have a tough day, life is still gonna be shitty ever now and then, and its easy to feel like nothing has changed on those days, but now you've seen the light at the end of the tunnel.

I am only a little ways ahead of you and allthough progress takes time with mental health I promise you everything is going to become a little brighter, you'll breathe a little easier and notice the world change before you little by little if you keep up the good work!

Thank you for sharing with us ‚ù§Ô∏è"
tasslehof,fdq1lz7,t1_fdnjhl2,Promise?
Almost-Batman,fdq50xx,t1_fdq1lz7,"Idk if it translated well, but its works in my language?"
tasslehof,fdq52xk,t1_fdq50xx,"Sorry I was being a bit silly. I meant do you promise this will happen, as I needed to hear that this morning :)"
Almost-Batman,fdq5i9k,t1_fdq52xk,"No problem man, you will get through this!
I am fighting with a little extra anxiety even as i write this today, but today was actually great in reality, so was yesterday. 

Its all about focus; we give the negative thoughts too much attention and the positives too little. I know you can do this because I know I can do this!

- You can always dm me if you need to vent, i work a lot, so i might not see it right away, but sharing helps both parties when its done right :)"
tasslehof,fdrm215,t1_fdq5i9k,"Thanks dude. I'm just starting my journey but each day I feel I'm getting better. Your right, your attention has to be on *something* so I'm starting to find that ruminating over old embarrassing situations is not super healthy :)

Focus focus focus, much love"
solaza,fdnkv60,t3_emb9qw,"That is so excellent. What a beautiful experience :‚Äô) 

Have you joined a sangha yet? I find so much value in speaking with others in my are who value meditation as much as I do!"
usernamenotfooound,fdnxyb8,t1_fdnkv60,Where or how do you usually find your Sangha?
solaza,fdodrd6,t1_fdnxyb8,"I found my sangha of choice quite by accident, I met them at a protest a few months ago. They‚Äôre in the plum village tradition under Thich Nhat Hanh, I love their focus on /r/engagedbuddhism to bring the practice into the world to better the planet"
Alpha_Bit_Poop,fdpfq2x,t1_fdnxyb8,"Pretty sure you can just hop on google maps and type in meditation and see what comes up.  Easy place to start, also lots of buddhist temples hidden around that usually have public meditation classes."
allltogethernow,fdocqye,t1_fdnxyb8,Follow your heart!
usernamenotfooound,fdoqfrj,t1_fdodrd6,Do you guys meet often to meditate together? I'm still doing a lot of my Meditation by myself. I don't know what having a Sangha even means. Like friends who meditate together? Or you Google a group? I have no idea
solaza,fdp96gd,t1_fdoqfrj,"We meet weekly, and our time goes 

‚Äî brief guided meditation 
‚Äî 20 minute silent sit
‚Äî 10 minute walking meditation 

Then, we spend the remainder of the time together encouraging each other in our practice in different ways that change week to week. Yesterday, we read out loud something called the 5 mindfulness trainings, which you can find on google. It‚Äôs basically the 5 precepts, but renamed and extended according to Thich Nhat Hanh, who is a well-known zen monk. 

Other days we might share about our practice, etc, it‚Äôs really up to the sangha leaders, who in my group are some of the most compassionate, loving people I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure to meet. They‚Äôre the reason I keep going back, really. 

Feel free to shoot me a PM with your area and I can help you locate a group for yourself!"
usernamenotfooound,fdow7dt,t1_fdoqh34,Or are you a bot?? We're onto you
PleaseGiveMeAUserNit,fdnlari,t3_emb9qw,"Man. I love you. I was never bullied as a kid, nor do I have any traumatic experiences, but I'm never in control of myself. It's good to hear that somebody is developing! I really want to fix myself. Thank you for loving yourself. :))"
CaptSquarepants,fdnfdtk,t3_emb9qw,Good stuff. You may find Louise Hay's books or audio helpful for this step.
Lordarshyn,fdnftjq,t1_fdnfdtk,"Thanks, I am pretty much addicted to audio books, I will check them out"
smellsofsnow,fdnjc34,t3_emb9qw,I had this same experience when I first started to love myself. It‚Äôs a continuous process but you can keep returning to the meditation if you need help loving yourself at any time.
alan5000watts,fdnjl12,t3_emb9qw,"Self love is the only love we can ever be sure of. I also believe that this is what ancient mystics meant by ""God's"" love being unconditional."
AGUSuru,fdnfgpo,t3_emb9qw,"Wonderful experience, thanks for sharing :)"
DestructorEFX,fdnfiv4,t3_emb9qw,Nice!
matheussanchesc,fdnjkc3,t3_emb9qw,"I am happy for you man. Meditation also helped me a lot in this situation. Keep loving yorself, cause we are all uniques!

Besides, I didnt know this Sam Harris' couse and I got really interested in it. Thanks for it."
Lordarshyn,fdnlbuo,t1_fdnjkc3,"It's a great app! If it's too expensive for you, you can send an email and he will give it to you free for a year."
SpaceKuntress,fdpwb7f,t1_fdnlbuo,Do you happen to know his email? Or do I just message support?
Earnesto101,fdq3014,t1_fdpwb7f,"Just message the support email address on the Waking Up website and let them know. I‚Äôve heard that they get back to you very quickly, so enjoy meditating :)"
Lordarshyn,fdq15bb,t1_fdpwb7f,"I don't off hand, I just subscribed for it"
SpaceKuntress,fdziwz7,t1_fdq3014,"Done and done! Thank you, my friend!"
FunGuyGreg,fdnljyd,t3_emb9qw,Yeah I never felt love for myself until I started meditating as well. Still a work in progress but it's a wonderful feeling to cultivate
danf87,fdno3f5,t3_emb9qw,"Some people are too lazy to meditate they opt for lsd for a taste of that self love. It is the first principle to a happy life in my opinion. Good job discovering self love the hard earned way, you deserve it."
thealtarshebuilt,fdpgkz7,t1_fdno3f5,"In my experience, it helped me open my eyes to the amount of love that is actually available at all time. I had never experienced the feeling of pure unconditional love for myself or anyone/anything else, believing that I was not ¬´cut out for it¬ª. Lsd made me realize that it is so much more obtainable than I had ever imagined, which in turn made me seek growth and development in a sober state on a daily basis. I see your point, but I just wanted to point out that sometimes certain substances can be what shows you possibilities that you would maybe never have been able to believe were there at all"
sambamsatan,fdnpz0v,t3_emb9qw," So glad you had this experience. You are worthy, loved and deserving. Thank you for sharing your story! üíôüôèüèª"
Physicaccount,fdnr9et,t3_emb9qw,I found Loch Kelly through Sam Harris' conversation in Waking up and downloaded his audiobok called Shift Into Freedom. I can highly recommend it!
Lordarshyn,fdnrndq,t1_fdnr9et,Thanks for recommending it. I saw the lecture in there but haven't listened yet. I'll give it a go and look into the book. Appreciate it.
Recent_Level,fdo6pk2,t3_emb9qw,"Could you share a link to that material i have trouble with that concept of self love, too thank you ... it¬¥s okay i found it and yes you are lovable"
Lordarshyn,fdoblxp,t1_fdo6pk2,The app is called Waking up. Hope you enjoy it.
kyakis,fdq09hc,t1_fdoblxp,"I'm curious, is the app worth it if you don't subscribe? I mean, it seems everyone who posts about it has gotten a subscription.."
Lordarshyn,fdq14nv,t1_fdq09hc,You need to apply but you can get it free for a while if you email them and say you can't afford it
MyBumIsClammy,fdnlws1,t3_emb9qw,That‚Äôs awesome! Glad for ya
dreruss122,fdnn3tz,t3_emb9qw,Really happy to know this friend. I am also following the waking up app and I am on 34th lesson. Really loving it and finding it useful so far.
breinbanaan,fdnpr5n,t3_emb9qw,Yessssssssssssssssssssss love you!
lostausername,fdntjn8,t3_emb9qw,I downloaded the waking up app about a week ago.  It's amazing what 7 days has done for me.   Keep going because you are beautiful and you're worth it.
AggravatedAndroid,fdnw2uh,t3_emb9qw,"Thanks for sharing your story. I also had a similar experience within the past couple months. Been going to therapy for symptoms of depression and anxiety, and am working on a number of past traumas. During one my meditations I turned inward to my ""inner child"" and it was like a dam broke. An overwhelming flood of emotions and tears and sobs‚Äîcan't remember the last time I ugly-cried like that. 

It's been easier to have positive self-talk and reassuring myself as I push myself to be a better human, most of which involves opening up and being vulnerable with other humans. 

tl;dr Being compassionate towards yourself feels weird at first, but is truly transformative over time."
rachel8188,fdo5ggv,t3_emb9qw,"ah yeah, the laugh cry! Such an awesome, light feeling! good for you"
SpaceKuntress,fdpwece,t1_fdo5ggv,Im not sure I've had the chance to experience this.
MajesticPresentation,fdocvte,t3_emb9qw,"I agree its powerful. I just started metta last week and have seen a few new posts like yours even since then. 

I did it last night and also started crying. It was the 16 min meta that he has and it's such a powerful meditation.

Glad you're benefiting from it too!"
Johnny9497,fdokv9w,t3_emb9qw,"That's beautiful, you are deserving of love, and let me be first to say I love you, you are love by more people than you know, and that energy should be flowing back to you know, meditation literally saved my life, and I believe we are all connected, but sometimes we have to grab it by quieting our mind completely, God bless you, and he loves you too, you better believe it !"
scoot87,fdp6gfx,t3_emb9qw,"The inability to feel love is not due to the past traumatic experiences, but the walls that we put up as a response to those experiences that keeps us in darkness from the loving light of life."
aaipod,fdp8z6a,t3_emb9qw,Keep on keepin on
turbophysics,fdnrb0x,t3_emb9qw,Thats excellent!!
Legofeet,fdny98z,t3_emb9qw,"Awesome! This is something I need right now. I was gifted a free year of the Waking Up app a while ago, I guess I should give it a try. Thanks and happy new year :)"
Lordarshyn,fdo0ec8,t1_fdny98z,Try it! The intro meditations are ten minutes a piece and you can of course do a few in a row if you're really feeling in the zone. It was awesome for me
Legofeet,fdobvqq,t1_fdo0ec8,"Can I ask you kind of a weird question? Is it weird that I feel a kind of anxiety about doing that? I've used headspace for a while and I'm always timid about doing more than one session at a time, like it's violating the rules or something lol? I'm afraid that it might ruin the experience"
Lordarshyn,fdoc50y,t1_fdobvqq,"Sam even says himself that it's okay. It won't hurt anything. Just do what you're comfortable with. Sometimes I would do just one, other times 4 or 5. I actually found that I got more out of them when doing more than 1 because you're already kind of in a zone with it."
Legofeet,fdofix1,t1_fdoc50y,Thanks so much!! :) <3
NikaPalmers,fdnz4sn,t3_emb9qw,I‚Äôm so glad you experienced this!

mastercaboose3,fdo535z,t3_emb9qw,"Meditation, going and enjoying nice weather, trying to find positive thoughts with things i was previously thinking negative about all help me. I‚Äôm glad you were able to start finding peace, it‚Äôs amazing when you start actually feeling good about yourself for once."
TheSheibs,fdo9j36,t3_emb9qw,"Metta Meditation isn't just about projecting loving-kindness towards other but also for yourself.

Don't confuse an emotion for loving-kindness.  There is a difference.

It sounds like Sam Harris had you showing loving-kindness to others, such as your parents, friends, family, acquaintances, people you dislike, and then finished with showing loving-kindness to yourself.  From what I read that is the correct method.

Keep practicing it and you will be able to look at some random person and show them loving-kindness just by thinking it."
brotherxaos,fdo9jqo,t3_emb9qw,This is basically the same problem I have... Can you tell me how to find the course that you did? I'd do most anything to get the results you did.
Lordarshyn,fdobhl0,t1_fdo9jqo,"Same Harris has an app called waking up. It's 14 a month but if you email them they'll give you a free year. The intro course is a nice easy intro to meditation, 50 10-13 minute meditations. And there is a small section for metta meditations and he works those into the daily meditation which unlocks after the intro course. It's a really great program. I have thoroughly enjoyed it."
brotherxaos,fdp0z3i,t1_fdobhl0,Cool. I will look into that. Thank you very much!

reddituser5309,fdongrz,t3_emb9qw,"There‚Äôs a small book called fear by Thich Nhat Hanh that really helps you direct the energy you get from metta into basically self healing. It gave me a similar break through, well worth a read :)"

KeyAirPuzzle,fdp46xw,t3_emb9qw,This is so very beautiful. I appreciate this. I‚Äôm so glad to hear of a breakthrough. Self love is so elusive to me. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve felt it but it‚Äôs a challenge to accept sometimes. It really is a paradox to me. - I have cried once over self forgiveness meditation. who knew I needed to forgive my own self
_learning_as_I_go_,fdp5atz,t3_emb9qw,Amazing! Keep at it!
GavC54321,fdpd01w,t3_emb9qw,"Good for you pal! :-) Started doing my own form of meditation a couple of months ago called Reiki Tummo and it's awesome! Anyone from all religions or any belief can take part so it's totally inclusive (as long as there's respect in understanding from everyone or at least that they're willing to make an effort to do so)

I'd ignore that Isis chap that's giving you trouble. He'd probably find meaning in this meaningless luck-of-the-moment snap I just caught scrolling past your post xD ""OMG gotta mean something!!"" lol

Cleffer,fdqm3wn,t3_emb9qw,"Been meditating and practicing mindfulness for quite a while now but just realized self-love is BY FAR my worst problem. This has become my one of my goals. I'm still learning how to go about accomplish it and am kind of lost. I see a lot of words about it, but am falling short in regards to the comprehension. It almost feels self-defeatist or like a self protection mechanism."
Lordarshyn,fdqwllf,t1_fdqm3wn,"Could you understand mindfulness before you started meditating? I think it's something you have to do to understand. I was facing it with nothing but mental resistance until he turned it around and had me look at myself. Reading about it, I never understood it. Just had to try it. Look up some guided metta meditations and give it a shot. You've got nothing to lose and so much to gain. I wish you luck with your journey!"
Cleffer,fdqz1xp,t1_fdqwllf,"I could. However, as I started meditating, I gained deeper insight as to how they worked hand-in-hand and it became easier. 

I will give it a try and look up that ap everyone is talking about as well. Thank you for your kind words."

I am just so happy by this that I wanted to share it with you guys."
ketOMADomnivoreINTP,fdkelv2,t3_elsybm,"I think the problem comes with judging. The Universe is neutral, what we judge ""good"" can have consequences judged as ""bad"" and so on. In fact, the human brain cannot understand causality in a holistic way, only by scientifically isolating elements, we can get some knowledge about the future (like predicting a chemical reaction).

Meditation allows the judging mind to shut the fuck up and flow with the Universe, that's why everything is so ""easy"" or ""natural"" in a meditative/flow state. But I think the ability to meditate is correlated with an infinite amount of factors, you may think it's the key to everything but that's again the human mind trying to grasp a grain of the Sand of Causality. No, we really can't understand, we can just feel, explore, experience... enjoying the ride, enjoying the adventure. Otherwise we would control everything like god mod in games, it becomes boring and meaningless in a matter of minutes."

besticandorightnow,fdk6gz9,t3_elsybm,Well said . I feel the same way. I did guided meditation for many years without this effect and started silent meditation about a year ago- it‚Äôs been life changing!
IrishJayjay94,fdkiwlg,t1_fdk6gz9,I've started meditation lately and I've been using guided. You recommend do it in silence instead?
RawkPeepl,fdkjwx8,t1_fdk6gz9,So interesting! I started in silent meditation and recently started dabbling with Insight guided meditations and have felt I‚Äôm getting a lot more from it in the sense of expanding my understanding of myself and how to apply the methods daily
future_fit_person,fdlo0kj,t1_fdk6gz9,"What's the biggest difference? I have done some silent and recently started doing some guided meditations to learn how to do mindfulness, the ones I have been doing tend to have a lot of silence between the talking parts though."
besticandorightnow,fdkk0y3,t1_fdkiwlg,I love guided but silent meditation took me to places I didn‚Äôt know I had inside. I started with just 1 minute and worked up to 20 minutes daily.  I still do guided at night most nights while I‚Äôm falling asleep.
Chingchicken,fdla6ct,t1_fdkiwlg,I meditated for 2 years with headspace. I think it gave me a good introduction and a good knowledge about meditation and how to deal with problems that can occur. Silence meditation allows me to go much deeper because you are undistracted and also longer ones 20-30mins did the biggest change in my experience! It can be difficult at start but its worth a try. But if your new i think guided is a good start for now:-)
EggsForGalaxy,fdlk65u,t1_fdkiwlg,"Guided meditation is a good guide to how to meditate, but I think you should transition to silent after. At the beginning a lot of people feel they are doing it 'wrong' or want to go on reddit and ask if they did it wrong, (you aren't doing it wrong as long as you are trying to focus and bringing yourself back to focus when you realize you have gone off trail) but guided meditation has none of this ""am I doing it wrong"" factor"
besticandorightnow,fdkkvga,t1_fdkjwx8,"I have done some type of guided meditation since the 80‚Äôs but one day I was talking to my son,  who is an avid meditator and he casually said ‚Äúisn‚Äôt silence kinda the point? ‚Äú I thought about it and started doing it to experiment and found it very very helpful for me. I don‚Äôt know if starting with guided for so long helped or what but I‚Äôm happier than ever and I like the routine of silent in am and guided at night. Give it a try start with one or two minutes and increase as you feel ready - not much of a commitment for a potentially amazing payoff!!!"
besticandorightnow,fdo1t50,t1_fdlo0kj,I think for me it‚Äôs that guided meditation relaxes me but silent meditation teaches me to relax myself.
sensible_human,fdkm266,t1_fdkk0y3,Same here. I'm considering giving up my Headspace subscription since I primarily only use it for unguided and semi-guided meditations lately. Most of the guided meditations on there are the same. I'm grandfathered in to the $50 per year price though so I would lose that.
YOLOSELLHIGH,fdkyfzg,t1_fdkk0y3,"Not snarky AT ALL, but curious as to why you stopped at 20. I worked up to 35 mins with a goal of 60 mins someday and the benefits from longer sits are immense."
cokehq,fdmqzrr,t1_fdkk0y3,"So what do you do in silent meditation. closed eyes, deep breaths and just observe your thoughts? do you start thinking about things when you meditate, try to understand yourself more or what? want to get into meditation but I want to do it right"
future_fit_person,fdo9l5g,t1_fdo1t50,Thanks
Altostratus,fdltp76,t1_fdkm266,"One solution I've found for this is simply downloading the headspace packs online. I understand that this is not ethical. Most of the time I'm fine with silence and the gong of Insight Timer. But everyone now  and then, I just crave the soothing sound of Andy's voice. I also enjoy the transition they do in headspace of deep breaths, then bringing attention to grounding on seat, sound, body scan, etc...My body calms more easily starting with something like this before focusing on the breath. I've setup preset interval timers in Insight Timer to mimic these stages."
Palito415,fdlrwqk,t1_fdkyfzg,"I want to get back into meditating, what benefits would you say you've gained from meditation?"
besticandorightnow,fdo23lq,t1_fdkyfzg,Sometimes I go longer. I usually meditate first thing in the morning and I have to get on with my routine for the day.
deebo911,fdn5and,t1_fdmqzrr,"Have you ever done something really physically demanding like an intense workout and then sat down and just released? I mean really let it all go? It's kind of like that (for me). 

I sit in a comfortable position and just RELEASE. Might feel goofy or unsure at first but eventually you'll be able to slip into instant calm relaxation. If a thought, feeling or anything else comes up, I don't resist it - I just release. Give no f-cks. 

It's like giving yourself a space to be aware and awake but completely releasing and not concerning yourself with anything. Bliss.

One trick I was taught is to get started is to squeeze all the muscles of your face towards your nose as hard as you can for an entire minute. You should really be feeling it by the end of a minute. Then let it go and release. It's like EFFORT, EFFORT, EFFORT and then ahhhhhhhhh release. With every breath I try to conjure that ahhhh release. 

Once you've practiced it a few times, you'll slip into it easier with no effort. It's where you mind wants to go naturally."
YOLOSELLHIGH,fdlvz30,t1_fdlrwqk,"Ya know I started to try to type a list, but it‚Äôs just so much. It‚Äôs also hard to put some of it into words because it deals with emotions. Well, hard for me to put into words because I‚Äôm not good at identifying my emotions yet lol which is why we meditate!!"
cokehq,fdn8e5k,t1_fdn5and,Thanks for this! Gonna try it out
capri71,fdk8mg1,t3_elsybm,I can report similar. I also put it down to the meditation. I'm no longer feeling like a victim.
sihmarnancy,fdkm2y2,t3_elsybm,It's so good. Continue doing it.. after 3 years of regular yoga and meditation practice I am in a completely different headspace. Totally renewed.

nobrainermaui,fdkoaqh,t3_elsybm,"Good to hear, my friend. I just began formal meditation practice this past February, and have experienced similar results. I started with 10-20 minute guided meditations via the Headspace app for the first couple of months, which helped me lay a solid groundwork for my practice. Not even quite a year into my journey, I‚Äôm doing 30 minutes of silent meditation first thing in the morning, and 30 minutes before bed. The synchronicities in my life are like never before."
shawdowr,fdlz778,t1_fdkoaqh,You do it as soon as you get out of bed?
nobrainermaui,fdm82w4,t1_fdlz778,"Sometimes I get up to pee first, but yeah haha"
redditimes,fdkz4rr,t3_elsybm,I was just thinking about this! I'm coming around three months of meditation and realizing just how terribly I speak to myself. One of my goals for 2020 is to be kinder to myself and I have meditation to thank for it. :)
mayaurneighbor,fdl5tz1,t3_elsybm,SO proud of you!!
TweetyFirs,fdkgxza,t3_elsybm,"I tried meditating several times but my head goes like 100/mph and I get so overwhelmed that end up feeling very anxious. Did you have this happening? Could this get better? And if so how can I do that, any suggestions?"
merewautt,fdkvf8l,t1_fdkgxza,"Yes, to the point where I usually cried as soon as I started.

Let it happen and just observe. Sit with whatever is going on. Focus on the physical sensation of it, don't search for or entertain any abstract thoughts that go along with it.

Example: I start to cry and have a panic attack as soon as I lay down to begin my session.

Do: -Notice the sensation of wetness on your cheeks

\-Experience the sensation of you breath hitching

\-Become aware of the tightness of specific muscles in your neck or back

Don't: -Attach abstract labels to what is going on (""I'm crying""; ""I'm having a panic attack"")

\-Attach an abstract ""why"" to what is going on (""God my job is what makes me this miserable, I can't live like this"";""I hated that offhanded comment my friend made today. I can't let it go."")

\-Assign any short term or long term behavior (""OK breathe, no more crying""; ""Calm down, read the nice text your friend *also* sent you when you're done. She meant well"")

If any of these abstract thoughts do arise (they will), just let them go and you're back to physical sensation. Don't entertain them, or have meta-abstract thoughts about them. 

Unpleasant feelings, like all strong feelings, are simply physical sensations. You can reason through them (label them, explain them, set goals based on them) *at* *any other time,* meditation is not for that. Meditation is *for physically feeling them*. *No abstract thought*, just sensation. You say your mind races. What does that **physically** *feel like?* Are you eyes darting behind your eyelids? Is your jaw muscle engaged? Are you wincing?

You might wonder ""what I can't reason through my emotions? That's why I started meditating in the first place! I want to feel better."" You can't begin to do that until you *physically* feel the range of your emotions in your body. Emotions are terrifying until you realize that (by stripping away all the cluttered labels, explanations, etc.) all they are *by themselves* is just tense neck muscles, wincing, wetness on cheeks, choking breaths, vomiting.

*You'll never live as you should or come to a conclusion on what you should do, until you reduce emotions down to their physical sensations.* Until then, they usually loom far too large or far too small in our minds.

Saying ""I'm struggling to do that because I'll be scared"" is so different from saying ""I can't do that because my hands will shake a little and my voice might crack once at first"". When you understand that's what emotions are, you see how little is *actually* holding you back.

Why is it so hard to do something that will make our hands shake and our voice quiver a little? Because those things used to mean much larger amounts of danger than they do now. Evolution endowed us with emotions to either inhibit or encourage certain physical actions. It really was life or death.

Sitting with these pleasant and unpleasant physical sensations (emotions) lets us acclimate to them and only give them the amount of physical response in our life plan that they deserve. ""Oh that's the feeling of embarrassment again. But this isn't life or death, and I've meditated while embarrassed before and I survived the flushed cheeks and wincing just fine."" -Does embarrassing thing One needs to do, feels embarrassed and, again, survives it-.

Or on the other hand ""I need to get out of bed but god this feels so good"". Meditation gives you the experience of knowing this intense feeling of rest, and that it's not that impressive. And that the cold out of getting out from on the covers isn't that bad. You should get out of bed and go to work on time. It lets you correctly value pleasant sensations too and resist temptation.

It's not about changing or getting rid of certain emotions, it's about becoming so aware of them that you can plan or act *around them.* Think about it, if you can accept and work with the fact that you might feel absolutely awful for a period of time, what can't you do? We can't do things because we're not *willing* to feeling certain awful physical sensations (emotions).

Meditation and mindfulness are the most successful way humans have found to get to that point. The point where you know all the physical sensations of living your body so well that you rarely ever take action (or fail to take action) in ways that will have repercussions *worse* than just an upset stomach or wet cheeks.

vvienne,fdkj8gk,t1_fdkgxza,"So completely normal. This should lessen with practice and meditation will a,low you to observe and release your thoughts, without judgement. 

I use the free app Insight Timer and it‚Äôs been nothing short of a miracle for anxietyb& PTSD after losing 3 loved ones tragically.

They have beginners guided meditation, as well as guided meditations and music, like tens of thousands for free. And of course just a Timer for silent meditation. I have a hard time sleeping and there are sleep music options, as well as body scans (aka Yoga Nidra). So much goodness in this free app! 

I do think it‚Äôll help quiet the monkey mind during guided meditation (for me, headphones in always!), and then silent meditation. At least it did for me. I committed to daily practice after my dad died and I‚Äôm now at over 300+ consecutive days of meditation üíì"

ludflu,fdkid33,t1_fdkgxza,"This is to totally normal and expected.

Once you realize this is happening, tell yourself its ok, then gently direct your attention back to the breath (or whatever your using as your meditation object.)

whipstickagopop,fdl5743,t1_fdkgxza,"I think the others have already provided better input than I could have given, so I will just highlight something that helps me and Sam Harris mentions sometimes during his guided meditations.

It's just 10 minutes, if you really have to worry about everything you have to do that day, or the things you have done in the past that you regretted, you have the rest of the day to worry about it. Just give yourself these 10 minutes of rest and attention to meditation and then go back and worry about the other stuff."

For the record, my husband is doing better, one day at the time and I feel blessed for that and I hope you stay strong and keep doing what you are doing for you good and again thank you for sharing so much, I‚Äôm inspired to not give up and give meditation more chances üôèüèº"

sholandayomama,fdn10vg,t3_elsybm,I am currently having the same experience. Starting to practice yoga and meditate every day and it gets easier and easier for me to reach that stillness each time. I sometimes end up meditating for longer than I originally planned because I'm so deep in my headspace. I feel like I am just now truly appreciating and understanding what meditation and yoga have to offer :-) great feeling.

besticandorightnow,fdo3sq5,t3_elsybm,My practice keeps evolving right now I like to start by noticing my breath for 10 to 15 counts then I imagine healing energy flowing from the ground through my feet - then healing energy coming from above and mixing . Then when I feel really calm myself I spread calm to whatever situations I am currently stressed about - I offer calm to all my thoughts basically. I extend healing energy to my loved ones and often to political leaders and especially people with whom I‚Äôm  having any sort of conflict . Then I try to relax in the love feeling.  if my thoughts stray I think of a candle flame and keep bringing my mind back to the flame or my breath.

Abe-Solotely,fds6eer,t1_fdqoaru,"Reddit is the worst kind of Social Media for me. I've used an app called RescueTime since ~2014. Only at the end of 2018 did I look at my habit.

In 2017, my peak reddit usage year, I spent ***160 hours*** on reddit. About 150 hours in 2018. 90 hours in 2019. My goal this year is 50 hours, but the less the better.

How I am doing it: using Chrome application StayFocusd with a 30 min timer for all social websites, coupled with Samsung Galaxy S10's built-in app timer setting Reddit is Fun for 25 mins a day.

My only subreddits are those like this one. Subs I go to for entertainment are only in the shortcuts, not my homepage. 

****

Reddit is addictive for everyone. I live a very active lifestyle, went through a renowned university, and work a demanding job, yet look at the hours I put in. Part of me wishes I never discovered it, but honestly, I did learn a lot of important things I would have never learned otherwise (at least, not as early as I have). It brought me many good things, but at the price of many things I wish I never came across.

As with all things, I take responsibility for my past, and Reddit isn't something that happened to me, rather something I've done to myself. Gotta make it a tool and control yourself. Imagine if those 160 hours were used to purely to develop myself.

Apologies for the confessional/ wall of text, your comment just sparked me."
Spiritual_Factor,fdv07e8,t1_fdqoaru,Reddit is better then the other social medias since you can control the information you wanna see.

nicklegit11,fdtlr00,t1_fdtds4n,Its why more people see movies than read books. Movies are a fast display of pictures and information vs a book while has more detailed information but it takes a longer period of time to soak in. Thats why it does matter what content of social media you are consuming merely on a physical display of videos vs text. A scrolling feed of videos is worse for the mind than a scrolling feed of forums.

jenniferjuniper,fdqnc7f,t1_fdqc9xt,"I noticed after starting to meditate regularly, my desire to just browse social media for no reason went down.

I also spent less time on there as I was more satisfied with what I was seeing."

nootdude,fdqmdvf,t1_fdqc9xt,"How is it a form of meditation if everything that‚Äôs recommended to you is scantly dressed people, viral short clips of people doing random things for views, material things like exotic cars and expensive clothing, and people traveling luxuriously while you‚Äôre grinding at work, etc, etc? It‚Äôs like, let me go meditate in the middle of New York City time square instead of in the calm peaceful forest or your own meditation room."
hostilemimosa,fdqnrxz,t1_fdqnc7f,"Definitely. If I spend hours a day on reddit I will start arguing and getting heated, but i notice if I check for a few minutes a day or every other day then I‚Äôm less attached and I focus on the posts/comments that are actually meaningful to me. 

Moderation/balance is definitely a key.

Kinda going against my initial comment, I do notice that when I goto my in-laws property , which has no cell service or internet, I am forced to sit with myself, family, and nature more , and definitely can do me some good. that break also seems to help keep me more moderated with my social media use for some time after I leave, and do have access to the net."
atlgeek87,fdqtirc,t1_fdqnc7f,"Same I just check my stuff every now and again.i barely post updates and go about my day.its the same with tv,according to my box I saved three days of energy.i prefer being productive now then just being sucked into my old bad habits."
franklinruan22,fdqlufn,t1_fdqilcl,"I agree. If you are an alcoholic and decides to not drink anymore, going into a bar is not the smartest idea, even if you are decided to not drink again. One has to know its limitations.

I know that I'm addicted to social media, so I just try to not use them most of the time, even if they no longer have as much power over me as they had before."
WordRick,fdqmrsj,t1_fdqilcl,"I think Reddit is worse than ig for the reason you listed. Mindless scrolling and you're constantly barraged with biased stories, clickbait titles, and random people's opinions on every topic.  Also why Twitter is a cesspool."
HatrikLaine,fdqpdrw,t1_fdqilcl,As you‚Äôre posting on reddit haha
hostilemimosa,fdqmx44,t1_fdqmdvf,Those are all temptations and lusts which one has to learn to become non-attached to.
furyzer00,fdqo7sb,t1_fdqmrsj,I think in reddit at least you can dive into a specific topic. It depends how you use Reddit but you can be in Reddit for 30 minutes and just browsed 3 posts if you read comments. As a result you will consume much less different content but with much more depth.
spooky_f0x,fdquevk,t1_fdqmrsj,"I agree. I follow people I care about on Instagram, so I only see content from people I want."
Kesslandia,fdscqrp,t1_fdqmrsj,"To me, these days, FB is the cesspool. I like Reddit because I can choose what I look at and what I participate in. FB has their sticky algorithms that filter your feed and now you see if junk vs. what your friends are doing. I've even gone up to a friend's page and not found all their posts. Filtering. 

IG I actually like, because I use it to stay in touch with nieces/nephews and their kids. They post there more than FB. And that's fine with me. Plus I feel like the feed isn't as manipulated as it is on FB. 

But if we are talking about things that put people to sleep, let's look at television..."
jj8jj8jj8,fdqqdqr,t1_fdqmx44,"True, but for those who aren't on this path, social media is irredeemable and completely toxic to them. I know several people who, if social media disappeared over night, would be happier people. Insecure people who get pulled into comparing themselves to others on social media are never happy, ever. If you're deep into meditation, it might be healthy to tempt yourself and show yourself it has no pull over you. For the average person, they would be better off without it."
nootdude,fdqtcko,t1_fdqmx44,But why would one choose to be exposed to those temptations daily? It‚Äôs like knowing masturbating to porn is not good for you but you going on porn sites everyday and trying to resist the temptations and attachments.
WordRick,fdshfm7,t1_fdscqrp,I definitely agree. Facebook is probably the worst out of all of them. I swear every other post I see on FB is an ad. I'm only on it to keep up with family back home but seeing as they only post political meme's I'm thinking I won't miss much.
hostilemimosa,fdqqh5y,t1_fdqqdqr,Very fair argument!
hostilemimosa,fdqtq25,t1_fdqtcko,"I go on social media mainly for plant/gardening, and music. I don‚Äôt get a lot of ads with scantily clad women or fancy cars unless I actively seek it out.

NikaPalmers,fdqoyfs,t3_emqhiw,"Yes, I noticed it too. I tried no Facebook for a week and I had so many hours in a day, I was finally creative because I thought a lot about my art instead of scrolling. Somehow Reddit doesn‚Äôt become this addictive for me."

uxfreak,fdqqkan,t3_emqhiw,I think being aware while using social media helps.
fornax55,fdqxuux,t3_emqhiw,"Huge up. Trying to meditate after a big social media session is much more difficult. I also find it much harder to maintain general clarity of thought when I've been scrolling a lot.

My last month has been insane so I took a few days of downtime this week. I spent *way* too much time scrolling, and I notice that the bombardment of random thoughts is now incessant, rather than occasional. But with more use, it also becomes easier to rely on social media for stimulation / distraction."

dreruss122,fdr06os,t3_emqhiw,The worst thing to follow on social media is politics. The toxicity and hatred there always gets me into a state opposite to that of a meditated state.
_Steve_T,fdrblph,t1_fdr06os,I would say the toxicity of just everyday people is just as bad. All three drama and senseless inane garbage is pretty depressing.

I only get on for a total of 2 hours by the end of the night.  I spend 15 mins a day mediating ,13 doing yoga & then 10 mins doing  ab work outs. Learning to keep things in  moderation. Also trying to find a balance and knowing when to stop was the hardest for me, now it works great for me making limitations and separating my mind from useless information. :)"

TheSheibs,fdruuxw,t1_fdrhxcj,"That's why I read and then practice what I read.  Then if necessary, I go back to the book for clarification on something.  If I have more questions I do a Google search and look at PDFs instead of Wikipedia or YouTube."
itzdjengo,fds7pyv,t3_emqhiw,I personally think YouTube is my biggest addiction of them all. It's very hard to step away from youtube.
proteousKohan,fds7x1j,t3_emqhiw,"I deleted FB from my phone a few months ago and left it uninstalled for about 2 months. I noticed whenever I was bored or had down time, i'd automatically just swipe to facebook on my phone and start mindlessly scrolling without really getting anything from it, as opposed to reddit where we actually have deep conversations about real shit. Not just ""Oh gurlll, you're so perfect hehehe""   ""no you are hehehehe""   ""Oh stop, it's all you hehehehehehehehe""...  
After about 2 months, I noticed that I wasn't swiping up to use facebook anymore (after deleting I always went to open but it wasn't there of course), so I decided I had broken the habit, and now I check FB like once a day, if that and only really read reddit.  


My GF has also had the same realisation about FB and Instagram and as part of building a better relationship and improving herself, she's also uninstalling both for a while until it's not a habit. Honestly, when I reflect on how social media has influenced us and our relationship I think about all the times we sat next to each other mindlessly scrolling, instead of talking to each other."

someshnarwade,fdtiatw,t3_emqhiw,Just being aware of the fact that you are spending time on social media is enough. Slowly as you move forward in your meditation journey you start to become aware of things including distractions and also the things that make you happy.
KLBikey,fdtjfpt,t3_emqhiw,"I tend to agree with your post. Facebook in particular seemed so distracting to my mind. Their algorithm just baits you to controversial news of your preferred topic. I've disabled my FB account for over a months and I have to say, my mind is a lot more in peace now. Local politics has very minor effect on what I think and do daily.

I'm trying the same with Youtube, but it's more difficult because it's harder to live without YT. It's the only video-sharing platform of any significance out there."
rollin_olan,fdtlrzo,t3_emqhiw,It would probably be more constructive to just consume information that you deem to actually be important and filter out the drivel.

I be mindful when I'm out in public instead of scrolling. There's so many opportunities to be mindful, and those are often moments we reach for our phones & social media (waiting for appointments, eating a quick meal, walking somewhere...). Not to mention that on social media, you're changing topics, mediums, etc so quickly, it's so bad for you."

-AMARYANA-,eo3t4y,top_level,"I discovered Buddha and his teachings in 2009 when I was 19. This same phase is when I discovered cannabis, mushrooms and LSD. Over the next decade, I got fully immersed in learning everything I could about Dharma and striving to live in harmony with it. I learned about meditation at the Tibetan monastery in my city, it happened to be partnered with a major university nearby for neuroscience research.

My journey spanned across space and time as I studied the ancient world and tried to integrate it into modern life through creativity, service, and entrepreneurship. Around 25, I started to apply the 80/20 rule to my life every year and started to shed possessions, relationships, ambitions, vices. It's interesting how 64% of the total value comes from 4%.

By 27.5, I wasn't drinking beer or smoking weed and barely eating meat or processed foods. I was able to consolidate my life down to a backpack and a briefcase. It was liberating in many ways. Around this time, I went to an ayahuasca retreat and start to shed inner weights like resentments, fears, trauma, repressed emotions. I also started to see just how subtle the ego was in it's constant manipulating.

At the end of 2018, after a few months on the road exploring the National Parks, my grandmother had a stroke and I helped take care of her. In her final days, I saw first hand the things that inspired Buddha to leave the palace behind: aging, sickness, death, awakening. I started to realize a lot of things in a deeper way but felt Buddhism was not for me because it has become another -ism full of dogma. I still study Buddha though, funny thing is that he wasn't 'a Buddhist.'

In 2019, I began to study the connections between different civilizations and find the common ground. I met many characters in my travels clinging to concepts, identities, and ambitions. They reminded me of my younger days where I thought salvation was out there. I got into a routine of waking up at 5am and noticed 'time clutter' start to disappear. I noticed social media had much less appeal to me because it caused more suffering than joy, even reddit was losing it's appeal.

After another month long roadtrip in August, I revisited ayahuasca and got the message, 'You are the Way'. I went to a meditation retreat in December and the teacher started his first lecture with the same message: 'You are the Way.' That brings me to the present moment sharing this journey and what I've learned with you. I hope this message finds you well and helps you on your journey. I'm so grateful that we live in a world where it's possible to wake up and just be."

I‚Äôve never formally studied the Buddha but I feel that maybe ‚Äúattachment‚Äù is a similar or related concept.

I also love that you have the strength and discipline to not let that message ‚Äúgo to your head‚Äù. These insights can start or stop doctrines, and I believe they are only apparent to people when they‚Äôre ready. I‚Äôm happy for you.

Life is continuous growth and change. Like trees grow as they give oxygen, we grow as we give love."
-AMARYANA-,fe8rny6,t1_fe8pmgg,":) I'm glad it resonates, my only intention for sharing it was that it benefited others and added to their practice. 

That feeling is something we all know, it's like an undercurrent to being human, being alive really. We all have these drives. I like to ask where are they coming from? Why? Why (again)? Is it leading to freedom or suffering? Meditation gives us a moment to settle into our bodies and break from living on autopilot. 

Yes! If something isn't growing, it is dying. And even when something dies, it disintegrates and reintegrates into something new. I'm fascinated by this!"
BarryO44thCommander,fe9ysof,t1_fe8pmgg,Change is the only constant in life.
messy_messiah,fe8vaam,t1_fe8rny6,Growth can only be possible because of death. Thousands of the cells that make up our bodies are dying all the time. We are dying and regenerating in every moment. Growth and death are just words for different parts of the swirl.
debacular,fe8uih6,t1_fe8rny6,"I think about these questions all the time, and can only approximate an answer that is acceptable (to me) using analogies!

Basically, I think we are all entities that are meant to take in food and produce waste. When each of us does this properly we are harmonized because each waste product is food for another along the chain.

However, if my upstream food provider gives me non-food (to me) / non-waste (to him/her), I have a choice to make. I can either reject the non-food, and pass it on down the chain, or I can adapt and learn to process the non-food to produce food for my dependent(s). In doing this, I effectively switch places with my provider.

We all move around in this chain throughout life- up, down, left, right- and here me here- no one is ever in charge of anyone else. The only thing we are in charge of is what we do with the non-food that is given to us. This is the choice: responsibility.

When individuals put in effort to adapt, the community as a whole finds harmony and equilibrium. When they do not put in the effort and do not adapt, parts of the community begin to die.

When whole chains keep passing the non-food down the line and it never gets processed, it eventually reaches the original non-processor again and the same choice is given, yet again."
jecrois222,fe9j9j8,t1_fe8uih6,Non-food? I‚Äôm so confused
debacular,fe9uc7w,t1_fe9j9j8,"My analogies probably suck to read! Sorry. I‚Äôll try to add more words which may muddle it for me but clear it for you.

Food means love given to you in a form that you naturally benefit from, without effort on your part.

Non-food means love given to you in a form that you do not naturally benefit from, which requires effort to process and benefit from.

For example. I just exercised during my lunch break, which is normal for me but out of the norm from my coworker‚Äôs perspective. She told me that it is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to exercise in the morning or at night, but not during the day when you should be working. I am too busy with other commitments morning and night, so mid-day is the only time I have. I come to work early and get started so I have the time, but most people don‚Äôt see that part. I explained this and told her ‚Äúeverybody‚Äôs different‚Äù. She was demonstrating a protective love by trying to make me conform to a perceived norm. Instead of getting upset or defensive, I found the love in what she was saying even though it took effort."
jecrois222,feafhoh,t1_fe9uc7w,"Thank you, that is helpful.

Don‚Äôt want to start an off-topic debate here but that makes me wonder how that relates to actual food. We adapted to eat meat or we adapted to eat plants? I‚Äôm torn as it which is ‚Äúnatural‚Äù for us. I‚Äôm leaning towards meat being our more natural food source based upon our hunter ancestors (before we had agriculture). But going back even further did we eat plants and then adapt to eating meat when the forest started dwindling and we were forced to hunt? I go back and forth."

I don't mean detach from them literally. I mean, not have a minor panic attack if I think of different scenarios that could happen and how I'd react."
-AMARYANA-,feaw4tf,t1_fe9vsf7,"I have a niece and a nephew, 2 and 4. How old are they? The best any of us can do for others is be loving, supportive, stern at times to cultivate excellence. 

If they are young, kids will be kids. Mold them best you can. If they are adults, make amends to them best you can and make sure they know you love them and are always there for them. 

I'm sorry I can't help much more than this. I am not a father yet."
LEGALinSCCCA,fec7bnt,t1_feaw4tf,"Thank you for your reply. 

Being a parent is very difficult and stressful but rewarding. Seeing them progress. 

I am just worried that if something happens to them, how would I respond? Not healthily probably. And I want to nip that in the bud. In case it happens, because it does every day and hour. But also so I can learn to accept death for others as well as myself. It really scares me, and I avoid thinking about it because of that."
johncoltrane69,fe8v36x,t3_eo3t4y,"Please don‚Äôt take this question the wrong way, I‚Äôm just curious. Do you have much fun? Are you sexually active?"

I just turned 30, it was a much higher priority a few years ago but I'm content with my life as it is right now. I was seriously involved with a woman a year ago and after that experience, I've just been focusing on myself. I'm feeling that I'll start dating again this year and see myself settling down in my 30's but none of this is the highest priority right now."

Interesting, When I turned 30 a year ago, I was in the exact same place. It's also around that time I discovered Buddhism and mediation. I feel like when I was in my 20s, I was trying to hard to make something happen. It resulted in a number of stressful relationships, and a number of painful rejections that were rooted in caring too much about my ego. These days I'm putting myself out there again, but trying to go with the flow. If something happens, it will happen naturally."
bobocliche,fe8ncee,t3_eo3t4y,">In her final days, I saw first hand the things that inspired Buddha to leave the palace behind: aging, sickness, death, awakening.

Would you mind telling us more abou that? I've been thinking a lot about aging and death and would be very interested to know.

Thanks for your testimony!"
-AMARYANA-,fe8pq1i,t1_fe8ncee,"She raised me as a boy, would read scripture to me when I was a toddler, and was my refuge throughout my life when I needed warmth. She had been through so much in her life but was so sweet, funny, and fierce. She was also the eldest person in a very big family, I was very fortunate to be her grandson.  

This experience was very visceral for me, death was a concept until this experience. Seeing this woman who loved me more than I knew go from a vibrant 80something year old to being bedridden for the final month of her life just made an impression on me. This is the circle of life, being born comes with an eventual death. In between, we have this time and we have choices. Some of us have more time and more choices, some of us have less time and fewer choices. Whatever the situation, none of us knows exactly how much time or how our choices will compound over time. The best I can do is value each day enough to cultivate my practice and to be of service to others best I can. I have little to no control over what others do or world events but the little bit that is in my sphere is influence is all I need to focus on to be healthy and happy in the present, to age gracefully, and to die with a clean conscience. 

When she passed, the whole family forest showed up. They barely called her or cared for her when she was alive, she knew that. I felt like an outcast too, that's why we bonded so deeply. After the funeral, it just dawned on me more and more that facing the fear of death is the way to keep growing. What really is the body? What really is life? What is witnessing all of this? Does That ever die? Was It ever born? 

Hope this helps, I'm all over the place with this response."
bobocliche,fe8un4u,t1_fe8pq1i,"I like your answer a lot. Some months ago I had to do a minor medical procedure but decided I'd write my partner a letter to keep in case I died (not trying to be overdramatic, it just gave me, and still gives, so much peace of mind to know that if I died today he would have that reminder him of how much I love him). By writing it, I really had to confront my own mortality and decide to be ok with it, not because I don't want to live but because worrying will not change the fact that I will eventually age and die. I also realised I don't care how or if people will remember me, or even what they think of me now. If I died today, I would want to do good and be kind because I wouldn't want my time on earth to have been in vain, not to get people to like me.

Not absolutely related but since then, I've been writing more letters to my family and friends to let them know what they mean to me (and usually acknowledging some kind of wrongdoing or anything I felt bad for in my relationship with them) and every time it felt like a transformative experience. I kinda see why so many 12 steps programs incentive it.

Edit: I didn't really address your comment in my reply but now that I read it again it's kind of similar to what you wrote..."

I know what you mean, I try to live my life in a way that makes amends to all beings I have harmed across countless eons. I've learned that forgiveness is the most powerful medicine too. It lightens the heart to not carry around resentment and anger. Confronting death has also helped me be a victor and not a victim.

FlamboyantlyStraight,fe9dq0u,t3_eo3t4y,"I appreciate m this post. Interesting how you saw Buddhism as another -ism, or how I interpreted that, as another way for power to be redirected from the self to an intangible answer to our self-created problem of existence. ‚ÄúYou are the Way, be here now, you are god, you are love‚Äù I think are all the individualistic paths toward our higher selves, but do you think for collectivistic cultures this would be seen differently?"
-AMARYANA-,feaznn5,t1_fe9dq0u,"I see the way forward for our species as a synthesis of individualistic and collectivistic. Each of us has to be an individual, able to think and feel for ourselves. At the same time, it is important for each of us to 'pay our rent' to civilization by being of service with our gifts, skills, and experiences."
Jokurr87,feabhhd,t3_eo3t4y,"I'm curious to what you mean when you say The Buddha wasn't a Buddhist? Of course the religion is based off of his teachings so the label ""Buddhist"" didn't exist when he was alive, but I am curious as to what you context you mean it in here?"
-AMARYANA-,feasih1,t1_feabhhd,"Just like Christ wasn't a Christian. People built the institution of the Church. A similar thing has happened with Buddhism. There are many sects and subsects, the difference between Mahayana and Theraveda is a good place to start. The important thing is just to directly study the Sutras and learn from experience. This isn't an intellectual liberation in the end, it's all-encompassing. Persronally, I resonate most with Zen because of it's simplicity and emphasis that everyone is a sleeping Buddha waiting to awaken. This notion exists in other schools but it's most pronounced here. Just to be clear, I will go to Zen temples when I go to Japan but I won't identify as 'zen'. Identities are limitations."

-AMARYANA-,feb1hry,t1_feavd3d,"Never heard of him but will check him out! Thanks for sharing! I've been doing a study like that myself, also with Vedanta. I've gone as far as to read Einstein's papers to see what he actually thought instead of what other people think he thought. Highly recommend that to you, Einstein believed Buddhadharma to be the 'religion of the future'. He was spot on, it has grown exponentially when you consider how much brands like Apple and Nike shaped modern culture, both were inspired by Zen."
drsm61,febr57x,t1_feb1hry,"I would be interested in what you've found that was written about Buddhism by Einstein. There are a lot of mis-attributed quotes online. The verifiable one I've found is:

>What humanity owes to personalities like Buddha, Moses, and Jesus ranks  for me higher than all the achievements of the enquiring and  constructive mind.

Although I admire Einstein immensely, I don't find the contributions of Moses or Jesus to be anywhere near to those of the Buddha."
-AMARYANA-,fec0jcv,t1_febr57x,"I've never seen that quote before but thanks for letting me though in case I do. This is something I used to dig into a lot in my early 20's but I don't really anymore. Here is a collection of his essays on the subject: https://www.einsteinandreligion.com/

If those are not really him, let me know. I admire him immensely but I think it's also important not to deify anyone and learn to think for yourself. He was very attached to finding a 'theory of everything', married his cousin. He was a great man to my estimation though."

I recommend you meditate.  Read over some of the other comments I‚Äôve made about how you should approach meditation.  Re rack positive events in your head.  Because I too find myself sometimes drowning in misery.  And shortly into meditating come to realize all the great things I looked over during my day because I was too busy basking in my sadness.

Lily_Roza,fe37bns,t1_fe0wscq,"A very popular system that includes meditation is the Wim Hof Method. It has been studied extensively and continues to be studied. The founder, Wim Hof says that it helps people overcome psychological trauma and depression and anxiety. It includes cold showers and I know that helps because I used to get suicidally depressed then would swim in the ocean, and feel fine. I never realized why the pool didn't provide the same benefit until I read about the Wim Hof Method. It also includes pranayama to prepare for meditation. If you can't get into the cold showers, especially in the winter, at least try the pranayama and meditation. WHM is based on Tibetan Buddhist techniques, without the religious aspects. Art of Living also teaches a meditation technique that includes pranayama. It is offered as part of a Hindi yogi's philosophy, and tries to be secular, but some yogi worship can sneak in, depending on the leader. Some teachers are much better than others. Anyway, we took the 5 day course and found it really useful, as it set us on a solid program of daily pranayama and meditation. Although any meditation is better than none, a 20 or better yet 40 minutes a day done regularly will usually bring better results in your mental state. There are also many places that offer free introductory Buddhist meditations for beginners. But they don't include the pranayama, in my experience, a definite plus for deep meditation. If you want an easy immediate substitute you might try 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise, breathing deeply, before meditation.

TheGreatAssFairy,fe38vb3,t1_fe18cma,How long taking fish oil suppplements till you noticed an improvement?

djompom,fe2qbmd,t3_enila2,This post really inspires me to meditate
quietZen,fe2z0ag,t3_enila2,"Same thing here. I often wondered why I remember absolutely nothing from my childhood (5-14 roughly). There was just this emptiness whenever I tried to remember. Although for me it happened over the period of a few months, I also got back so many memories. I can confidently say now that I do remember my childhood. For me it happened when I had a consistent practice of anywhere between 1-2 hours a day for about 3 months. I stopped meditating mostly due to laziness but the memory stayed."
earthtuner,fe3g2i7,t3_enila2,Meditation has the ability to rewire the brain and change our default thinking process.Meditate long enough and every moment will become the present moment.A 70 year old meditator has greater mental elasticity than a 30 year old non meditator.I have been meditating for 45 years and can remember pieces of music I learned when I was young.Music and meditation can help keep our memories and minds intact.

ArubanoCurasoleno,fe0ooko,t3_enila2,What kind of meditation did you? And for how many times?
Calebkeller2,fe3bv81,t1_fe0ooko,Just your average joe meditation focused on pulling and re registering positive parts of my day and week.  And addressing the negatives and letting them go
DanielAppelquist,fe4z13b,t1_fe3bv81,"Never heard of that (though I'm familiar with a few techniques, such as Anapana, Metta, Tonglen, SHF, ""TMI""....) , where did you pick it up?  


What do you mean by ""addressing the negatives""? How is that done, simply remembering them or is it more involved?"
Calebkeller2,fe5brz5,t1_fe4z13b,"I sort of developed my own technique for now.  It works for me.  By that I mean I think about things that happened to me during the day that my busy mind discounted as negative or bad, and I evaluate them for what they are.  How was I wrong, did I mistake or misinterpret the situation, and was it something I could control.  Typically you‚Äôre left with a huge sense of relief in the realization that many of the so called ‚Äúbad‚Äù day to day events are not in your control, and often I find myself mentally forgiving others; their mind is equally as corrupted as mine."
DanielAppelquist,fe7tjsy,t1_fe5brz5,"Sounds like a nice practice. The most similar I've heard of (though I don't think they thought about it as meditation) was a practice where you move backwards  through the day, I think that was taught as a way to help people sleep better."
BigSky0916,eletkk,top_level," We can afford to open our hearts. Meditation is a gradual remembering who we are beyond the personality, coming and going of all the outer activities.  Take your time to awaken at whatever pace your need to.

Fall in Love with the process of moving through love, acceptance, rejection, death, loss, grief and mourning. Fall strips the old leaves from the trees only to quiver with an excited anticipation of the springs budding. Winter is a joyful slumber of inner restoration. Life is always moving. Love is rhythmic but only appears far away at times. Every sunrise promises new opportunities to begin again after grieving.

Fall in Love with Love itself. It speaks in a thousand tongues. Love is always present but the old leaves must be stripped away by the ice cold winds. Death is simply dropping off the old garments to Goodwill.

lonesome_pioneer,fdhbho7,t3_eletkk,So beautiful
Geovicsha,fdj0p34,t3_eletkk,"Beautiful. Thank you for sharing. Deep suffering to the level of trauma can be a turning point for so many. For many reasons, so many of us turn away from it and suppress it - with addiction, with codependency, and a neglect of our pain. I feel this is where the duality in the psyche is born - Jung's ego being what we identify with; the shadow being everything else.

Stress and trauma in real life can resurrect our childhood wounds. Many run away from it again, and it is painful to see, with the intellect's power of pattern recognition, the trauma scripts - both within their own mind's and between others - that get played out again and again.

If you've been practicing meditation prior, you're in luck. You may have spaciousness to that resurrected hurt. Having vipassana insights surely help - impermanence, non-self, suffering - but, often, we need a Higher Self/Inner Child model. We need to be our own light and love. I would say that's one in the same as Kundalini.

Vipassana meditation seems to be the masculine/cerebal component of awakening. It is needed. The self is an illusion. But Kundalini is the Divine Feminine, and it is the light within all human beings who have consciousness. It is our home."

Suffering, despite what misguided religious or spiritual teachers say that it strengthens us and builds character is nonsense , because suffering decreases our state of awareness, and often people just conclude that life is shit and unfair, more baggage, more experience. And with this same damaged self, we are supposed to find Truth.

All experiences, good or bad, are limits which are boundaries. Truth is not a limit and so never an experience."
mikehc123,fdi6hmz,t1_fdi5clp,"It‚Äôs not suffering itself, but your perception and interpretation of suffering. Suffering is not always a choice, but you have the choice in how you respond to it.

EmbracingHoffman,fdj96pv,t1_fdi5clp,"Suffering is inevitable. We can only control the way we view suffering. Non-attachment is a good tool for dealing with suffering. Difficult times push us to explore non-attachment in a way that comfortable times do not. 

That's the meaning of suffering is grace. Suffering brings us closer to ""God""/unitive consciousness."
peterrabbit88867,fdi7zmr,t1_fdi6hmz,"All suffering can do is to learn us new habits. Oh, sure, we can learn from pain, but only in a very limited way. Such teachings are wasting your time.

Experiences leave impressions on the mind, which then condition behaviour and further degrade consciousness; so all experiences, instead of expanding awareness, actually limit it, so no lessons can be learnt of any spiritual use.  If it has a beginning, middle and ending then it‚Äôs a prison."

I was really lost and broken way beyond what I can explain in a reddit post. I believed strongly that the way I wanted things to be needed to be , even though it was out of my hands. Through a meditation practice, allot of philosophical readings and other positive tools, I can definitely say I have learned not to suffer as much when life doesn‚Äôt go the way I want it.

sayleanenlarge,fdzcq6b,t1_fdzcfyu,So what am I? Do I emerge from the brain or am I something outside of the physics of brain?
Sharktopus_Jones,fdzpxh5,t1_fdzcq6b,"You've likely heard the phrase ""the self is an illusion"" before, yeah? What this refers to is the sense that we all have by default that we are a locus of consciousness riding around inside of our head. When asking the questions that you're asking, you're defining this sense as your self.

Being mindful of your thoughts you may notice that the exact wording your thoughts will take unknown to you until the moment that it is experienced as thought. In the same way that when someone is speaking to you, you don't know what they will say until you experience it as sound. Just like sound, thoughts simply appear within your conscious experience.

Noticing this, many people conclude that the self is actually the observer rather than the thinker. This is just another variation of the illusion of self. There needn't be a thinker or an observer. There is just consciousness and it's contents.

The self does exist in the sense that you are a human being with a subjective conscious experience. That conscious experience does emerge from the inner workings of the brain, but the self is not limited to the sense of being a locus of consciousness inside of our heads. It is also not limited to the brain, or the body. What defines you is all of that together, the brain, the body it's apart of, and the subjective experience that emerges from its biology."

I confess I was quite tempted, but eventually sanity overtook me.

>Do I emerge from the brain

I believe this is partly true. It's hard for me to imagine writing this, or meditating, without a brain. 

>am I something outside of the physics of brain?

In a reductionist view, the nervous system extends well  beyond the brain. When I focus on my breath, my dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (control and planning), somatosensory cortex (feeling and sensing) and peripheral nervous system (receptors in my throat and body) jointly help *me* quieting the mind and prioritizing ascending feedback to the brain. 

In a more spiritual view, I think this exchange can be summarized in a position sometimes referred to as *dialectic monism*. While our brain (interpreted as a synecdoche) enables us with computational processing qualitatively different from other life forms, the sole possession of a brain might be not enough to deem a creature ""conscious"".

GetOffMyLawn_,fdxe1j1,t3_en64wq,"I was extremely ill about 12 years ago. I could only lie in bed and stare at the wall for several months. this meant I would observe my mind a lot since I couldn't really do much else. One thing that was weird was, I would wonder about something, then move on to another topic. When I came back to the first topic it was like some invisible file clerk had suddenly left a huge pile of papers about topic 1 on my mental desk. So parts of my mind were going off and doing things without me being aware of them. After a while I discovered there was more than 1 clerk. It's like your brain is a multiprocessor.

Awareness of ourselves and others is very important, so if it causes you stress to be more aware it is possible that you are now judging instead of simply being aware.

Don't let your attention be carried away by anxious thoughts, just keep observing the thought arise and then let it go. If you just observe and keep your monkey brain in leash, the stress goes away as your attention keeps focus on being aware.

At some point you might develop a habit of letting go of anxiety this way in social and other kinds of situation, but it is easier to practice this in a calm environment where there is no distraction to derail your attention."

Wollff,fe5izoz,t3_ensi2o,"I think it's best when you limit meditation to the stereotypical meditation thing in the beginning: You sit down. Don't move. Return to your breath for 20 minutes when distracted.

When sitting down, it's usually easier to get a hold of the problem you are experiencing when you try to practice with everyday life running along: When you sit and watch the breath, you get distracted and entangled. That's normal. Thoughts come up, and you follow along with them. Even though you don't want to.

At that point you recognize what is happening, and return to your object of meditation. That's the important part. That's how you get better at recognizing when you are invested into something that isn't your meditation object, and you also get better at returning your attention to what matters.

What you experience in everyday life is the same thing: You notice thoughts. And then you get entangled, and are rushed along with them. Without an anchor or an object, they just run wild, and you don't even know what's going on.

So, if you want to try practicing in everyday life, I would propose you go the Zen way: You pay attention to your job, and do your job in the most accurate, fastest, and most efficient way possible. You can't do that when you are constantly worried. You have to go away from the worry, and pay attention to the actions you perform.

That's a little more difficult than getting a hang of meditation by sitting down, and doing very little. But if you want to start out with meditation as part of everyday activities, that is what I would propose."
Lathaal,fe5rliz,t3_ensi2o,"I had a lot of trouble with this as well, so much awareness of mine and others pain or suffering just made life quite dreary.

Asked a teacher about it, the key was that awareness and equanimity are two seperate parts of the balance. All awareness and no equanimity means you arent processing and dealing calmly with suffering, while vice versa provides a blissful mind but in complete ignorance of the real suffering of your subconcious and the suffering around you.

The teacher suggested to focus on the balance, when you are feeling overwhelmed, step back and re-focus on only your breathing until your breath is calm and even, then and only then return to whatever meditation style you are doing.

For me, this was a massive game changer. Keep the balance to move further into your meditation, but dont push to hard in either direction, or quantify the levels in any way. Just accept what is."

Copperknock,fe5lx83,t3_ensi2o,"Becoming more aware almost invariably makes things worse at first, unless your life is truly blessed. That's why mindfulness is a bit of a two edged sword and kinda the training wheels version of meditation. The next step is letting go of all phenomena as they occur to you.

At first this feels like you're simply fleeing reality, and your are in a way, but the rabbit hole goes way deeper than that. For one, you're training your mind not to ""grasp"" automatically anymore--to stop latching onto ideas and feelkngs automatically at a deep level... 

Over time, this gives you a kind of freedom, as well as the understanding to use it. Almost immediately you begin to feel better though, as your mind let's go of the thoughts and feelings that occur during meditation. Beware of feeling good, when that happens though. Feelings and thoughts that occur to you by accident in meditation must be let go of, because they're meant to be distractions from the unifying work you're doing to yourself."

It‚Äôs weird, I was actually handling my life and social situations pretty well before the year began, but ever since it‚Äôs just been a downward spiral of regression into suffering and anxiety for seemingly no reason."
MGsadhana,fe5xhwf,t1_fe5txzt,"Here's an easy trick that will help you. You just have to commit to it 100% or it won't quite work. If you're on board, here we go:

Find a quiet place to sit down and get comfy. 

Next, commit yourself to fully focusing on one of your senses (I advise using hearing if that's available. If not, use the sensation of the cushion under you. The point is just to have some continuous sensation to focus on).

Finally, sit there and soak in that sensation as hard as you can. Put 100% of all your concentration, focus, and effort into just taking in one particular sense. 

Now that you're sitting there, ready with focus, clap your hands 3 times while focusing on the sound or sensations of the claps. 

Ready? 

Go!


Now that you're done, I have a question.

What were you thinking about during those claps?


I'm not asking what thoughts happened before or after, but only specifically while you were clapping.

If you're anything like everyone else I've said this too, your mind was empty of all thoughts. You were just listening. The mind was at rest as far as thinking goes, but fully focused as far as awareness goes.

That's meditation in a nutshell, and this meditation is called a one-point concentration. It's as easy as listening, which is an effortless task as the ears are always receiving new information, and it causes the mind to stop focusing on thoughts and start focusing on awareness. 

There's a lot more significance to the mind while empty of thoughts than you may notice at first glance. For instance, there is often an emotional reaction to thoughts, and by concentrating on the present in this way, those reactions fall away into a stillness once the mind is undisturbed for a long enough time to settle into a restful state.

It's like ripples on a pond. You can't force the ripples away. You must cease trying to change the mind and instead let it be until it feels tranquil again. 

You wake up every morning not thinking about anything. Now you know how to not think about anything any time you want. Whether or not you invest in your thoughts from this point on is entirely up to you. If you're anything like me you'll find them to be useful tools that are easy to trip over if you don't put them away when there's no real problem to solve. 

Meditation, just as a side note, also tends to release things that have been repressed. This means that you may notice how out-of-control your thought-stream really is. There's no conquering it into submission or repression. You can't smack the ripples out of a pond. The only logical option is to humbly surrender and let go of trying to control the thought stream entirely. 

Instead, when thoughts do arise, watch them rise and fall as your concentration wavers. See the relationship between thoughts and awareness firsthand. Does awareness exist while thinking? Can you still maintain focus on listening to whatever sounds you're hearing right now even while you think? Study the mind and you will master it in time.

If you feel a surge of anxiety while meditating, concentrate on it. Feel how it fills your body without judging it or trying to escape it. Just feel it. As you do, concentrate on keeping your breaths at normal intervals. Anxiety causes involuntary rapid deep breaths for me, which actually makes the anxiety much worse than small, calm breaths. See the relationship between your emotions and the length and intervals of breathing for yourself as well. It will help you in future anxious moments, as it's certainly helped me (during a painful surgery no less).

Every cause has an effect and vice versa. If you are experiencing negative effects, chances are good there are negative causes. These causes may come to you in meditation as realizations (""Oh that's why I feel that way!""). It's all a part of studying the mind.

Best advice I can give: When roadblocks are met, try new tactics and see what works and why.

CuriousIndividual0,fe63egv,t3_ensi2o,">It‚Äôs common advice in meditation/spiritual circles that being aware and conscious of what you are doing and what is happening brings a higher level of peace and eases a lot of suffering and worry.

If we follow the Buddhist line, yes being more aware can alleviate suffering, but in a particular kind of way. According to Buddhism, we suffer because of how we react to the world, *craving* for it to be other than it is. So being more aware means to become aware of how our suffering is a result of this craving, which involves being aware of craving as it arises. This is not an easy task and involves changing the habit patterns of ones mind through meditation. 

In the context of your social situation, being more aware of how you react to the world gives the ability to chose how you want to react, rather than being blindly led by your automatic responses. If someone drops a plate which breaks in your house for example, and you are trained in meditation, you might ""see"" some thoughts of anger and frustration appear in your mind, that you would have otherwise latched onto, guiding your response to that situation. But with this new ""awareness"" you can notice those, let them pass, and then choose how you would otherwise want to respond.

>when I am in autopilot mode I don‚Äôt seem to struggle that much at all, and it‚Äôs easy for me to forget about my worries and sufferings

Meditation is a way to help you deal with your worries and sufferings, it's a kind of therapy. From what you are describing it sounds like when you practice being aware in your social situation, your becoming more aware of the possibilities for action, i.e. you're *thinking more*, but you're not aware of this thinking *as* thinking."
swump,fe64ga9,t3_ensi2o,For what its worth same.

kmc2349,fe66zz1,t3_ensi2o,"It sounds like you are giving your brain a general task of ""being aware"" and getting overwhelmed by being aware of too much stuff all at once.

Pick one thing to be mindful of and let go of all other chatter and worries that your brain brings up. 

In my opinion it's more about focusing on one thing you want to focus on and practicing letting go of random unhelpful thoughts. Just ""being aware"" though is too vague."
beto_747,fe6e016,t3_ensi2o,"To me, being mindful when I‚Äôm speaking to someone is not to become more aware of everything my mind is doing, as it‚Äôs always active.

dantheman6140,fe6fwoo,t3_ensi2o,"I hit this stage many times, and usually revert back to my old ways which brings some relief and some difficulties from abandoning meditation. As another poster mentioned, you are noticing things you haven't noticed before or bothered paying attention to, and are now a little distracted by details of your interactions etc. I have had similar experiences, and can assure you you're on the right path! The next step is to be mindful of your THOUGHTS about your behavior or whatever it is you're specifically referring to. It's tricky and takes practice, but I have recently made it past that stage (for now, assuming I keep the practice up) and my quality of life has been ticked up a couple notches. 
A couple more quick tips that always help with those kinds of situations: a) don't try to be perfect. You're human, and will make mistakes, again and again. Mindfulness helped me realize my mistakes and mishaps, and I immediately rush to correct them, or get angry when I repeat mistakes. But just observe, and over time mistakes that are able to be averted will naturally cease. b) don't label things in black and white categories of ""good"" and ""bad"". When I started noticing all the details of my interactions, I was judging things as acceptable or not. But that's not how things are; they're more on a continuum between good and bad. 
Keep practicing and moving forward. It might seem like you're moving backwards, but you are actually headed in the right direction!"

Staying as awareness would be staying aware of this feeling and not acting on it.


As this is just a cloud appearing in the sky and you are the background of knowing, thoughts and phenomena are just clouds passing by, sit as the observer of the person who thinks he needs to do X or Y and simply be present.

Thluks,fe6oz0d,t3_ensi2o,"One of the goals of meditation is to let go of all that. You don't have to perform, you don't have to socially interact in a certain way. Therefore you don't have to think about it either. Yes perhaps it can be a bit disorienting to get out of autopilot, but very liberating.

Watch your thoughts come and go, without identifying with them or acting on them. I found it helpful to just label each thought that comes up, let it pass and refocus on breathing."
redbearsociety,fe6pgxs,t3_ensi2o,"Right now you are noticing your discomfort and probably reacting to it negatively. So your newfound awareness is causing second suffering. Your mind has found a new problem so to speak.

Wheras when you are in flow, your mind is no longer finding problems, you notice the good sides of social interaction and you dont suffer so much. 

So you can do 2 things. 
1. Focus where the problem isnt
2. Stop having a problem

1. Could be gratitude or loving kindness. Metta is great, gratitude is great, focusing on finding the positives around people is a great practice. 
2. Could be really being mindful of it all - become aware of the second suffering mentioned earlier and allowing that with compassion and space too. Eventually it doesnt feel like a problem anymore, and so your problem finding mind wont care or show you it as much! Great how that works..."
tripsteady,fe6pua8,t3_ensi2o,"its not unique to you, you are just more aware now thats all. continue with your practice and continue to dis identify from thoughts."
rumiromiramen,fe6qsdu,t3_ensi2o,"The key to being aware is to allow the sensations to outweigh the thoughts, by thinking more about everything you are actually becoming less aware and more in your head."
vipassanamed,fe6srux,t3_ensi2o,"I think this is quite common, especially in the early stages of meditation. We start to become aware of what we are doing and saying and then of how bad we often feel as a consequence. It is possible to separate the mindfulness from the social situations but again it takes time and practice. Because you are more aware of what is going on you see much more and we seem to have an inbuilt tendency to see all the negatives!   
Someone here has suggested metta practice and I think that's a great idea. In case it may be of help, here's a link to a good podcast that describes the practice and how to do it.

wobblydan,fe6t5t7,t3_ensi2o,"The concepts of consciousness and awareness aren't well defined. I think a better way to think about it is the concept of *focus*. Focus on what you're doing. If you feel uncomfortable, focus on the uncomfortableness. When in doubt, focus."

darrensurrey,fe770l1,t3_ensi2o,"The problem with mindfulness is that there is a tendency to just think it's about focusing on the present and so someone will seek out beautiful things like a lake, a stream, trees, a quiet room with just a zafu cushion and absolutely no noise outside, a mountain top.

The key bit that many people miss out is the bit about accepting what is happening, being non-judgemental of whatever you witness. So you should be able to meditate happily while sitting at a bus stop in a noisy city while the person next to you is playing drill ([https://youtu.be/XW14xMNUFWQ](https://youtu.be/XW14xMNUFWQ)) on their BT speaker.

I have something called Borderline Personality Disorder and awareness in social situations tends to have a negative effect on me as well, as I see me acting in ways that I can't control and it's hard on me."
BetterBe5,feaanha,t3_ensi2o,"You're misunderstanding awareness and consciousness. Conscious doesn't mean the same as it does in Western terminology. You shouldn't be over analysing or even monitoring what you are doing. It means putting your awareness outside you. 

Rather than monitoring what you're doing, you should monitor the other person or your environment. Monitoring your actions suggests judgement, which is going to lead to overthinking. 

I see consciousness as a V shape, on one end, there's the unconscious autopilot you're describing - not really thinking, but also lacking awareness. At the bottom of the V is the constant internal monologue, overthinking and overanalysing. At the other side is presence, it may look or feel similar to autopilot, but with more clarity and control over what you're doing.

The autopilot you're describing may not be 'autopilot'. It's easier to be outwardly present in social situations and that may be your default."
fangirlsqueee,fe5pidu,t3_ensi2o,"It sounds like maybe you need to assess your values. That is a totally different process than meditation.

Figuring out your values requires you to closely examine what is important to you. You focus on which things matter most to you - whether it's financial stability, being creative, supporting family, helping animals, traveling, or any other possibility.

Meditation requires you to let go of consciously controlling every aspect of your self. It allows you to be aware that the physical self is a seperate entity from the mental (some say spiritual) self. Meditating can help you find clearer vision to examine or practice your values, but it does not decide what they are.

You have to decide your values."
WayTooBlazed,encz2u,top_level,"If you haven't done that yet, try smiling while meditating. Come back here and share the results later :)

P.S: Please note I'm not saying you should add this to your regular practice or even do it non-stop during a single meditation. I'm also not saying you should do this as a means to be happy or force it if you don't feel that you should.

Don't forget to smile sounds catchy but I'm really just proposing that you try it out and observe the effects. For me personally, it felt like a breakthrough at a moment when I had a hard time letting go of control of the breath. Smiling for about a minute helped me relax and I was able to move to a state where I could easily acknowledge and become more acceptant of arising thoughts and feelings and let them go quickly. After that, following the breath became natural and effortless with zero effort and expectations involved. I must have dropped the smiling naturally a minute or two later, but it definitely helped a ton. I should mention that I was a bit anxious before sitting down that time.

So yeah, use it as you may, or don't. No pressure. Peace and love!"

Milficedcoffee,elnqpn,top_level,"Hello, 27 years old male here! I suffered from mild depression from the ages of 20 to 23 and was diagnosed with major depression when I turned 24. The years from 24 to now felt completely hopeless and I couldn't find a way to get out of my life situation, resulting often in suicidal thoughts. Those years were very taxing for me and I consulted professional treatment in the form of a cbt therapist. I was dead sure that my depression was my own fault, as I made a lot of life breaking mistakes, apathy, laziness and generally just feeling trapped in life. My therapist showed me that there was a lot more going on that keeped me depressed. We worked on solving these issues. One of the solutions was changing my environment, particularly moving to another city which I will do in the next four months. Even though I have some hopeless days, I finally feel that I can truly change my life, experience happiness and generally just finally enjoying life after years of misery.

My issue is this: my mind has the tendency to constantly pull me down. Thoughts cross my mind like: ""Well, you could have found a solution to your problems sooner, it's too late for you to change. You could have been happy all those years and shouldn't have lived so awful all those wasted years. Even if you tried to find a way out all those years, you should have tried harder etc...""

How do I deal with this constantly nagging mind that wants to feed itself a better story for its ""me""? Should I see my past as a seperate entity and move freshly and newborn into my future? Thank you so much. Love."
pbw,fdj5x1l,t3_elnqpn,"What I've been told, and what somewhat works for me, is when a memory comes up you need to choose a new reaction to it. Rather than embarrassment, it's ""oh man that was silly"" or something light. Forgive your past self.

But it's not intellectual there is an emotion tied to that memory, and that emotion comes back each time. You need to change that emotion to something harmless. Turn it into sort of a knowing laugh. Everytime the sour memory comes up, rewrite it. Might take months or years but eventually it should change.

A totally different take, useful on its own, is just really appreciating that time moves in one direction, and things in the past are in the past and cannot be changed. That's super easy to say and agree with, but you have to feel it in your bones. What's done is done, we live life moving forward.

Some people are naturals at that. Something goes horribly wrong, they break a leg, and they are like matter of fact ""okay given my leg is broken, we should do this next"". Someone else will be moaning and wailing about how unlucky it was and how awful it is, for weeks. Two different ways of thinking.

Maybe a third approach is live life one day at a time. You wake up with some state, some situation. You have a certain level of fitness, certain skills, certain bank account. None of that is your fault, none of that is your doing. You woke up that way. You live out the day with that situation. Boom, same every day. Don't blame yourself for your situation, but don't give yourself credit either. It's like a game and every day is a new level, you start clean."
LimitedHangout69,fdjwqhl,t1_fdj5x1l,"These are all great.  I'd like to add a couple others I learned from ACT.

Assign voices to the common problematic thought trains in your head.  So anytime you start hearing shameful thoughts, re-hear them in say Mickey Mouses voice, along with the ""ho-ho!""s.  It's hard to take it seriously then.

Assign names to the thought patterns in your head.  For instance I have a ""can't do anything right so why bother trying"" thought pattern that I get commonly.  But now when it comes I think oh hi again mr. Do no right.  It gives me a little emotional breathing room and reminds me that I am not my thoughts but rather an observer of them.

Another one I think ACT took this directly from meditation practice is to hear the thought, and say to yourself ""I am noticing I am having the thought that ..."" And finish the sentence.  ACT calls this ""defusion"" where you purposefully are trying to reestablish you are not your thoughts and vice versa.

Last thing I've tried is to simply start thanking your brain for your thoughts.  Have a problematic thought, saying thank you acknowledges it in a way where trying to fight it/avoid it tends to make it just come back stronger.

Obviously not all techniques work for every person so give them a try and see what works for you."

FappingFop,fdjztzp,t1_fdj5x1l,Your suggestion to reframe the memory has strong science behind it (like down to the neurological response). I talked with my therapist about it for pretty much an entire hour and we know that the brain alters memories every time they are recalled. So we can carefully change the emotion we associate with the memory by deliberately reframing our perspective everytime it pops up. He said neuroscientists have even observed this change at the neuron level. Cool stuff and great response
pauklzorz,fdk5sfi,t1_fdj5x1l,"> Forgive your past self

It can be helpful to think of your past self as a separate person. We can be so much harsher on ourselves that thinking of it like that can really bring out empathy that you wouldn't ordinarily give to yourself."
DunHuss,fdjwxqf,t1_fdj5x1l,"this is similar to the dianetics therapy that scientology use. It is based on the reactive part of memories that you are encouraged to revisit  to and just be observant of a neutral situation in order to tone down any painful emotions you hold. this is stolen by scientology & not thier own techniques, and in no way would i endorse this dangerous cult, just this technique can be very useful."

WachTraeumer,fdkldco,t1_fdk1s78,"ACT is designed to be a therapy, but it can actually be useful for ""healthy"" or ""normal"" people too. One of the core concepts of ACT is that pain is a natural consequence of being human. It does not focus on getting rid of the pain as that most of the time won't work but instead *accept* it and live your best life regardless, meaning living *committed* to your values. Mindfulness is core to the therapy. It really has some beautiful concepts in it. 

This book by the founder of ACT can be wordy or difficult to understand but also very beautiful.

redditKeyy,fdjpyx6,t3_elnqpn,"The mind won't ever stop shaming and making you feel guilty. It is something that inevitably happens once you set on to the journey of coming to a place of no-ego.

Once you realize the ego is not something you wish to serve, it will make you ""obey"" by making you feel undesired emotions, sensations, thoughts, it will do everything possible to make you submit to the mind once again and bring you back into unconsciousness where the mind has control over what is going on.  
The one thing you need to realize is that the mind is not going to work for you, ever, you must make it work for you. You do that by understanding the mechanisms of the mind, how it is trying to manipulate you, how it is trying to take your power from you or rather, making you believe that you have no power over the mind. Hence this post.

You believe you have no power over these thoughts, emotions, sensations, you feel like they are just overpowering you and you are so desperate that you made a thread about it. Not blaming you, I am just showing you how the mind tricked you to believe you are powerless. 

Now that you are aware of these tricks of the mind to keep pulling you back into this old identity of yours which was used to shaming and guilting itself (It is based on the conditioning you received as a child, teenager and adult up until this day), you were taught to feel shame and guilt, therefore your mind does these things on auto-pilot. 

This is an old program of thoughts running in your consciousness right now, and you believe this program has anything to do with you. You take it personally and you feel like you need to ""deal"" with it.   
In fact, there is nothing to deal with. The only thing you need to realize is that you should be aware. You should be aware of all of these things appearing to happen within your being, it is not personal, it is just the conditioning you were made to believe in and abide by. 

Now that you are aware that you are not these thoughts, beliefs, ideas, concepts, emotions, sensations, desires, attachments and imagination that belonged to this conditioning, you can finally complete you self-realization by understanding that none of these things that you are aware of, are you.

Notice how the mind even says ""You are useless"" or ""You should feel shame"", it is saying ""You"" not ""I"", it is clearly something that is not you, funny, isn't it? None of these thoughts, sensations and emotions produced by your mind have anything to do with you, and yet it seems like they are paralyzing you in this way.

It seems to paralyze you only because you gave such an importance to these emotions, sensations and thoughts that because of this importance and belief that it has meaning, **you** gave it the power to offend you.   
You should realize that mind (thoughts, emotions, sensations etc) can't exist without you. You are the one beyond the mind.

You can exist with nothing at all, yet the mind can't exist without you. You need to realize who is the bigger one, you need to understand that the mind has absolutely 0 power over you, unless you give it the power of your belief to affect you. 

What you should be doing is be aware of being aware of these thoughts, emotions, sensations. Do not identify your self as these things, as they are not generated by you. They have nothing to do with you. They are simply a kind of conditioning program that you are aware of. Be aware of being aware of that. That is the greatest power you have, the power to be your self, the stillness that is deep within any kind of storm and any kind of bullshit the mind is trying to ""attack"" you with.

Take a look, who is the mind trying to offend? It is trying to offend that old identity you believed your self to be, once you completely dis-identify from the past, and understand that it has nothing to do with you **now**, you will be able to completely carry on with your life without any real importance given to the mind. The mind can't attack you, it can only attack an idea of who you believe your self to be.

If you understand, directly experience the fact that you are **nothing**, the mind is **incapable** of touching you. It can try and offend that old identity for how long it wants to, but it has nothing to do with you. Let it be. Keep on being your self. There is no need to give importance, significance or trying to figure out why this is happening.

They are just thoughts, emotions and sensations. You were conditioned to believe this has some kind of meaning and that these are important but this is just another conditioned belief. You in fact have nothing to do with these natural phenomena that occur within consciousness. You are the universal consciousness it self, the no-thing aware of being aware, you are beyond all phenomena which appear to arise and then disappear.

Notice how everything in your life comes and goes, except that one thing. That no-thing. Which is you. 

Identity, emotions, sensations, thoughts, beliefs, ideas, concepts, imagination, attachments, desires they all come, and they all go. They are unstable, inconsistent, and none of them are you. As you are the one aware of being aware of all of these phenomena. You can't be something that is coming and going. You are the no-thing aware of that. You are beyond all these phenomena, do not believe the emotions, sensations and thoughts that make you think you are scared. You **can't** be scared. It is only a thought saying ""You are scared"" or ""I am scared"" disguising itself to be you, but it is not you, it is just the mind trying to lure you back into unconsciousness. Overcome that, **Transcend** that, **realize what you truly are. The being itself. The awareness of awareness itself.**"

Temporary_Search,fdj7p4b,t3_elnqpn,"Hello,

New Buddhist here myself, and I share a similar path regarding depression. Currently 35, feeling trapped, currently going through meditation sessions where I come out just weeping. Weeping over the pain and suffering I regret I've created through the actions of my past.

I think shame exists to remind us not to walk down that path again. Touch a hot stove; get burnt. The shame exists as an unpleasant feeling to keep us away from creating those experiences in our lives again. At least, that's my guess.

Maybe the ego wants to be spotless or without any imperfection. It wants ""100% completion"" or a ""perfect"" recital of an entire life. We have to release attachment to these outcomes. These expectations of perfection are keeping us locked in the cycle of suffering. You're here, now. You are more than good enough. You are more than trying; you are doing.

Much love to you on your path."

kidcubby,fdjsvtr,t3_elnqpn,"As a caveat, I have suffered from anxiety but not major depression. Give these ideas a try but don't treat them as if they'll cure anything going. They worked for me, so hopefully they will for you.

The points I always give people are these:

You aren't obliged to deal with a thought when it comes up. Acknowledge it exists then decide to deal with it later. Be firm - if it comes back, talk to it. 'I told you, I'll deal with you another time.'. It gives you a feeling of agency.

Learn to see ludicrousness in everything. Things can often become funny if you pick them apart and find something ridiculous. Allow yourself to laugh. If you don't feel like laughing at something, make yourself. It can trick endorphins into coming out.

Acknowledge your own place in the scheme of things. Remind yourself there are things you can't control, and that you can't go back in time to redo things. Talking to your thoughts helps here, too. 'Well I didn't do it sooner, but I'm going to deal with it when I decide to.'

And a dumb one that's not really meditative: learn to use your mirror as a conversational tool. Look at yourself and have a chat. Find even a tiny thing that you've done well or that looks nice etc. about you that day and say it to yourself. 'Well done, you got out of bed even though you found it hard.'

People feel silly talking to themselves but honestly it worked for me."

You could have been happy all those years and shouldn't have lived so awful all those wasted years. Even if you tried to find a way out all those years, you should have tried harder etc...""

First, recognize that while everyone's situation is different, all our minds do this. The mind either pulls you into the past to dwell, regret, or second guess...or, it pushes you into the future or creates alternate realities for you to ""get lost"" in. It's the human condition.

Second, understand meditation is what you do about it/how you deal with it. Meditation helps you strengthen awareness of what's happening in the mind, and it helps you develop the ability to stop indulging what you become aware of. The simplest instructions are (1.) Focus your attention on an anchor (the breath, a mantra), (2.) When you notice your attention is caught up in mental activity (thoughts, stories, etc.), note that mental activity and return your attention to the anchor. The more you do it while meditating, the better you can apply the skills you develop while not meditating*.

Don't substitute better stories, or continue to indulge the current stories your mind spins: that's simply providing more fuel for the mind to continue doing what it's doing.

*Take the skills you develop while meditating, and apply them to your non-meditating time. Be mindful of the stories when they arise, note them, and return your attention to the present moment. The more you do this, the more you'll find those stories don't have the control over you they used to have."

As far as the past is concerned, you have just as much control over the asteroid that struck earth and wiped away the dinosaurs as you do to your own history. None. Just keep that context every time your mind thinks back to the past.

Now, you have control over what you do TODAY so that‚Äôs the most important thing. Then tomorrow and the day after that. The more you better yourself today even just a little step, the more you inch forward closer to where you want to be. Eventually you will arrive.

Also increase exercise and time outdoors. Decrease time spent with negative people and sugar intake.

DangerWizzle,fdkewif,t3_elnqpn,"Hey OP, do you think you might have ADHD?

Depression is a comorbid disorder - I recently got diagnosed with ADHD myself (at 32) and it's explained so much about why I always felt so worthless. 

Turns out you don't have to be a hyperactive child to have it - it's hugely more wide reaching and interesting than that. 

Symptoms are, broadly, around self-regulation due to differences in the brain: physical, emotional, speaking, etc.

 Turns out ADHD is also the reason my bloody shoulders are always so tense and sore. It affects every part of your life and health.

It was your comment about apathy, laziness and life-breaking mistakes that jumped out at me, as well as the depression. I honestly could have written your post myself. It sounds like you're aware of what you need to do, but have difficulty doing it, which is fairly standard to ADHD. 

Not saying the CBT or meditation won't help - it helps me. It's just that perhaps there's something else going on that, if addressed and diagnosed, will make it easier for you to forgive yourself and know what to work on :) 

Wish you all the best - you're not alone in your struggles and you'll get through this.

Happy to give more info if you're interested!"
SirCSquared,fdk72gk,t3_elnqpn,"Awareness cultivated over time reveals to you the mechanisms behind this sort of thinking. Our mind has a tendency to overvalue the negative, largely because identifying negatives can protect you emotionally and ensure you‚Äôre more likely to survive. 

Our brains, at least insofar as we understand them, are the long process of millions of years of evolution. Certain traits, capacities, and patterns developed through natural selection. On the physical level, your thoughts are just a phenomenon in the brain. Consciousness is your experience and awareness of those thoughts. 

The content of those thoughts are meaningless. In the same way that a breeze doesn‚Äôt necessarily have a meaning. A tree whose leaves are shaking from a violent wind isn‚Äôt thinking to itself, ‚Äúwhat must I have done, or what is it about me, that I‚Äôm being attacked in this way?‚Äù It‚Äôs just a natural occurrence in the material world. As conscious beings, when a thought arises our judgments/preconceptions/biases pour in and construct a narrative around it.

Your depression is dictating the narrative. This is perfectly human and understandable, and your emotional experience is very palpable, immediate and real. That doesn‚Äôt change what I‚Äôve said above. 

Keep practicing. Rest in mindful awareness, and notice when the mind starts to wander or assess the thoughts. Trying to change them, or improve them, is just mindlessness of another degree. Awareness itself is the ‚Äúobjective‚Äù, even if paradoxically there is no ‚Äúobjective‚Äù.

Good luck on your journey, and I am proud of you for seeking professional help for your issues. I, too, have battled depression and OCD for most of my life. It‚Äôs cliche, but I can say unequivocally that it does get better."

Dante-Hitt,fdjxu3l,t3_elnqpn,"Your personality is made up of how you think, act and feel. 

Your personality creates your personal reality. 

What has created our current personality?

Our past life experiences.

Through them we have built literal neural highways of connections in our brain to those thoughts and ways of thinking.

They‚Äôre strong and hardwired into our brain.

It‚Äôs extremely easy for us to think them.

The thoughts we think produce chemicals in our brain which rush through our body giving us feeling / emotion.

Over time, our body becomes conditioned to the ‚Äúrush‚Äù or ‚Äúhit‚Äù of these emotions.

We become emotionally (which is really chemically) addicted and dependent on those emotions.

So, each day we wake up and think 90% the same thoughts which produce the same exact feelings which lead to the same behaviors and outcomes.

We virtually live the same day over and over again.

I completely understand what you‚Äôre going through and I‚Äôm THE MOST empathetic guy on all of Reddit reading this post thinking of you and your situation.

All of us are emotional junkies addicted to our habits of thought and feeling.

The worst part (if those thoughts and emotions are painful) is that they complement each other.

If you think you‚Äôre a loser, you‚Äôre going to feel like a loser. 

If you feel like you‚Äôre a loser, you‚Äôll think you‚Äôre a loser.

The solution is implementing a practice that creates awareness and helps you detach from these habitual processes so you can OBSERVE them.

The simple act of doing this is extremely powerful and you‚Äôll begin to break away from your current conditioning and personality.

This will also shift you out of your chronically stressed state (any negative emotion = stress because they all send our body out of homeostasis, out of balance) and out of High Beta Waves which make us over analyze and LOOP on our problems and INTO a state of relaxation, empowerment and creativity.

If we‚Äôre stressed out, ironically we‚Äôre blocked off from the solution to our problems.

Albert Einstein has this quote ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt solve a problem from the same level of energy that created it.‚Äù

If we‚Äôre doubting ourselves, it‚Äôs going to be tremendously harder to figure out a solution to our problems (albeit impossible).

If we‚Äôre confident and inspired, the solution will literally ‚Äújump‚Äù out at us. 

This is a game of focus and awareness, my friend.

I was where you were at and I had to reinvent myself or kill myself. I was at that precipice.

I had to destroy my old personality and create a new one.

Remember what this means‚Äîit means changing how we think, act and feel.

If you give me 12 weeks, I can help you create a new life for yourself free from stress."

jfcelano,fdkcp9g,t3_elnqpn,"I have found Thich Nhat Hanh's advise to be the most helpful here:

Paraphrasing - you should treat these emotions and thoughts with compassion, as you would a friend.  Welcome them, hug them, give them the space they need without becoming attached to them.  Let them come and welcome them and, when they are ready to go, let them go.    


I have found that by welcoming these feelings and giving them a mental ""hug"" they are ready to go much quicker than when I engage them in a ""conversation"" or fight with them.  There are times when a certain memory comes up and I simply say ""it's okay that you (XYZ), you did the best you could do at the time"" 

This is far different than engaging with the emotion and giving it luxury accommodations in which to run wild and have it's way with you.  It's an act of compassion more than an act of resignation.

An actual quote from Thich Nath Hanh:

 

(if you have fear) *you recognize that fear. You embrace it tenderly and look deeply into it. And as you embrace your pain, you get relief and you find out how to handle that emotion. And if you know how to handle the fear, then you have enough insight in order to solve the problem. The problem is to not allow that anxiety to take over. When these feelings arise, you have to practice in order to use the energy of mindfulness to recognize them, embrace them, look deeply into them. It‚Äôs like a mother when the baby is crying. Your anxiety is your baby. You have to take care of it.*

*You have to go back to yourself, recognize the suffering in you, embrace the suffering, and you get relief. And if you continue with your practice of mindfulness, you understand the roots, the nature of the suffering, and you know the way to transform it.*"

You're assuming that something called ""my mind"" has tendencies and pulls ""you"" down. All those words refer to abstract things that actual are the same. According to my recent experience and following some scientific evidence, this depressive state is the result of a huge inflamatory response, promoting a state of low activity. Your mind is not a magic object coming from another dimension, it's part of your biology.

In my case, but maybe not in yours, carbs were a leading cause of inflamation (dairy too). I started keto, everything goes well. I became a god. Now, people addicted to carbs, downvote me you ignorants.

Personally I just let my eyes do what they want and don't think about it too hard, they are usually closed by default but sometimes I have them open and not focused on anything, it just depends on what's most comfortable.

Comfort is key. Lotus position is not essential, if lotus position strains your body you can either focus on the sensation as part of your meditation, or the sensation itself can be distracting. 

I just tried your technique with the eyes and found it physically difficult to maintain and therefore extremely distracting.

If you are focusing too much on your posture, what you are now doing is essentially yoga, which is certainly a type of body meditation but I don't know if it's what most ppl in this sub are going for.

MrGuttFeeling,fe85omq,t1_fe70d8v,A regular time and place is good but not necessary. It's about developing a habit and if you do it enough times at the same time then your body will anticipate it and look forward to that time but if you miss it then get it in whenever you can.
toastedslightly3,fea1nh8,t1_fe70d8v,Eventually you'll find you can bring meditation with you anywhere. It can be as little as noticing the trees on a walk or truly being present in a conversation. The best days (in my opinion) are when i can really put emphasis on the knowledge ive gained and put it to use. Enjoy!
polardope,fe8m44s,t1_fe70d8v,I think the only answer to this question is you should chill tf and do it whenever feels right.

uazaa,fe83bxs,t1_fe823lo,"Great and congrats. However, I don't think it's a prerequisite for it to be enjoyable or to feel calmer directly as a consequence of a meditation session, meaning, if you felt frustrated or agitated it would still be just as valuable. In fact, meditating when it's difficult to meditate could be more beneficial than when it's easy.

Can someone who is more experience weigh in on this? I am a beginner."
grittypigeon,fea5hcx,t1_fe83bxs,There really isn't a right answer to that. This sub casts such a wide net for meditation practitioners even in one thread you can really see the variety of different traditions chiming in all thinking that they're right or correct or at least have it a little better than the other guys. Honestly you need to see for yourself.
hOpOnTheSpaceship,feadqat,t1_fe83bxs,"I would agree with you. There is a wide variety of traditions/backgrounds here, but as far as I see it there should be nothing ""special"" per se about sitting on the cushion. Whether you're sitting, standing, walking, eating, shitting - it is all practice. Furthermore, mindfully dealing with difficult thoughts/emotions/situations is the fruit of the practice, so I agree that practicing when you're not in the ideal state of mind is quite beneficial."

Or maybe just the nature of a communication medium where righteous ragers can vomit their frustrations onto someone *else*? I mean, Reddit is hardly the only place on the Internet that attracts those the great Aaron Beck called [*Prisoners of Hate*](https://www.amazon.com/Prisoners-Hate-Cognitive-Hostility-Violence-ebook/dp/B005586XEO). 

IME over the past 25 years on the Web, most discussion forums find their way to the hard-core hateful sooner or later.

There's a thought. For me that would be kneejerk polarizing or [dichotomizing]( https://www.google.com/search?q=dichotomy&oq=dicho&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.6477j1j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) 

> it takes deeper insight to actually recognize that living beings are receiving that hate

I work with such people in a clinical setting. I've yet to meet one (since 1987) who isn't 

1) a survivor of repeated abuse, usually during or beginning in early childhood, 

2) [conditioned](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fixing-psychology/201402/explaining-behaviorism-operant-classical-conditioning), in-doctrine-ated, in[struct](https://www.google.com/search?q=social+construction+of+reality+sociology&oq=social+construction+of+reality&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59j0l4.7012j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)ed, [socialized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization), habituated, [normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(sociology)) and neurally ‚Äúhard-wired‚Äù to the expectation of further abuse in almost all human interactions, 

3) at least somewhat paranoid, and

4) desperately clinging to whatever [compensations](https://www.google.com/search?q=compensation+psychology&oq=compensation+psytch&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.6795j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and [defense mechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_mechanisms) he or she can come up with. 

Most of them are way too far into their mental two-year-old, [compensatory narcissism]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ResponsibleRecovery/comments/9imrhq/compensatory_narcissistic_personality_disorder/?) to be able to envision the mental state of anyone else.

Sad."
TaraDrolma,fdtnfwp,t1_fdtn134,Thanks again for sharing your insight. It's all very interesting.
champ_mc99,eni4z9,top_level,"No I'm not crazy (well not sure, maybe).

I haven't meditated in over a month and have since had my depression creep back onto me. 

Just 10 minutes ago I locked myself in the bathroom and crouched into a ball on the floor.

For a brief moment, I started observing thoughts and living in the present until I realised I didn't want to let go of those unhappy feelings.

I wanted to continue feeling angry and sad so I could continue to feel sorry for myself. Part of me thought about how egotistical and arrogant this was of me which made feel worse.

I don't want to feel sad and self pity but at the same time I kind of do?

Why do I like feeling sad? I'm so confused."
PJ_1991,fe008ob,t3_eni4z9,"Because it's comfortable, easy, and familiar"
champ_mc99,fe00uu6,t1_fe008ob,"Truth.

I hate 'letting go' of anger when it's so much easier to just... explode."
AylaCatpaw,fe0s29d,t1_fe008ob,"Exactly. I don't think it's about ""liking the depression"", it's more the brain liking having a habit/routine, and disliking change, because if you're used to something (and you're mentally/physically tired), it's often more comfortable to just let things remain the way they are. Kind of a state of learned helplessness. 

This is also one of the contributing reasons for why it's so hard to break away from addictions.       

Until I read about [the extinction burst](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/07/07/extinction-burst/), having an explosive ""relapse"" into a behaviour I've been trying to stop (or change) would trigger so many feelings of worthlessness, self-loathing, shame and powerlessness. And I would just give up, because I've failed spectacularly‚ÄîAGAIN‚Äîand will always keep failing, so what's the point in even trying, right?       
But now that I finally understand *why* it happens, and understand that I am a person whose compulsive disordered behaviours cause *binges*, and that bingeing is a form of addictive behaviour‚Äîthat I struggle with *addiction*‚Äîchanged everything. 'Cause when you binge various things in an almost cyclical manner, it's hard to see that there is a connection between them, and that it forms a pattern of addiction.       
Whenever I managed to resist 1 behaviour, another one took over in its place, or sometimes it felt like these issues were either completely on or off, and that I kept losing control and couldn't choose to turn them off by sheer willpower. It was absolutely exhausting, and the distress it caused me would be crushing.      
But instead of viewing these bad habits as an overwhelming amount of *individual* issues, viewing these as the symptoms/consequences of an overarching addiction suddenly made everything make sense to me, and was finally able to realize what's actually going on. I now understand what it is that I am tackling, and what it really is that I need to focus on.        
I binge!            
Beyond making it easier to forgive myself and recover after a ""relapse"", it makes it much easier to attempt to adjust my lifestyle to avoid bingeing on things too.


**EDIT: Messed up the link! It's fixed now.**       
*Btw, here's a list of most of the things I binge or have binged, which are due to my prone-to-addiction personality:*      
The internet (overarching internet addiction), examples being: reddit; Wikipedia; various news outlets; TV shows/YouTube/documentaries/videos in general; ""online shopping"" and/or research (not necessarily buying things, but more like excessive ""looking""/researching/review-reading/comparing before making any sort of decision on almost anything, which is obviously useful to an extent (buy nice or buy twice, right?), but I go way, way beyond that extent with hundreds of tabs); porn.         
Compulsive skin picking; trichotillomania; nail-biting (Body-Focused Repetitive Disorders).         
Chronic and sometimes extreme sleep deprivation (I have ADHD, so my pills make this habit exponentially easier, or in other words, worse).         
Masturbation.      
Socially: infatuation; quick and intense friendships that fizzle out; partying.      
Collecting/hoarding.      
Alcohol. Cigarettes. Sugar.           

These lead to disordered eating too, but that's mostly as a consequence of my other issues (I luckily don't have an eating disorder).

All of these aren't things that I want/need to completely stop‚ÄîEXCEPT the BFRDs (which cause scarring and also really fucks up my teeth and joints etc.), cigarettes, the sleep issues, and the ""people-bingeing"" at the expense of others' wellbeing, and kinda porn too as it's risky because it's so fucking addictive‚Äîit's the *uncontrollable bingeing itself* that is the issue."

zziisshh,fe2h1jr,t1_fe00uu6,"I found myself thinking the same pattern of thought, throughout my lowest lows.

For me, the illness would blur lines between thought and belief.

Ideas about the world and myself became reinforced through the comfortable cycle of familiarity.

I would subconsciously bend reality to fit my self-perception/beliefs. 

If you do what you've always done, you'd do what you'll always do.

Only when you break out of a cycle can you look back on it with objectivity.

I don't believe you can ever fully let go. 

I believe the intensity fades in the same way that time speeds as we grow.

From my experience, it is more like the breathing exercises of meditation.

The marginal relaxation with an exhale.

The feeling is still there, so acknowledge its existence.

But more importantly, the thought is just a thought, your consciousness can stop it becoming a belief...or self-fulfilling prophecy.

usa_chan_cupcakes,fe070za,t3_eni4z9,"David Burns, one of the pioneers of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, addresses this resistance with every patient at the start of every therapeutic relationship. In all of us, even those who want to change, have some type of subconscious resistance to change that needs to be broken down before we can really change. You are on the right path now that you have identified it"
champ_mc99,fe08uu5,t1_fe070za,"So I guess the right move would be to fight it?

I should truly let these feelings go even if I don't want to?"
usa_chan_cupcakes,fe0fd9e,t1_fe08uu5,"In a way yes. But I wouldn't use the word fight I would say maybe either accept or revise. I highly encourage you to check out David Burns' podcast he has a few episodes on resistance that are more in depth. I would give you a link to it but it's against the rules of the subreddit :( 

A concept he talks about often is a magic button. And if you press the magic button, your depression/anxiety/anger/addiction or whatever it is goes away in an instant. Now the first instinct is to say yes please I wish I could hit a button to make it go away. But when we take the time to think about it, often we come to the realization that you have come to, and that is that a part of us doesn't want to change. We actually view our problem as the solution, something that helps us. I can't say what it would be for you but you got to ask yourself what it would mean for your self-pity or anger to go away and why you might not want it to go away. For me I struggle with anxiety. And my resistance is that if I suddenly stopped worrying then everything would fall apart. My anxiety makes me feel protected in a way because it's my subconscious attempt to control my life and if I pressed a button to make it go away, I would lose control. 

It takes time and effort but there are a lot of techniques you can use to breakdown this resistance I believe identifying it is the hardest step. Another concept after using the magic button technique is to say ok what if it was a dial instead of a button. Because the resistance in some cases will never go away completely. That has been the case for me with anxiety so far. But with the magic dial I can say ok I don't want to hit a button and make it go away, but what I would do is turn a dial from 100% anxiety to maybe 20%. I can look at my anxiety and realize the benefits it does have in motivating me and protecting me in some situations, but also realize that if left unchecked, it can be paralyzing and overwhelming. 

I hope this helps you in some way and I urge you to look into yourself some more! I will leave you with a quote from a class I took about self-pity and maybe it can help you be more willing to let go of that resistance if it applies to you. Best of luck to you on your journey!

""Pity is an emotion that often brings about emotional intimacy with others as we share in their pain. Pity can also motivate us to take action on the part of another person. Self-pity is the process of turning an emotion inward that is meant to bring about emotional intimacy with others; thereby blocking our ability to emotionally connect with others. Ironically, self-pity is driven by a desire for emotional intimacy. It can become an addictive behavior as we seek the pity of others in an attempt to connect emotionally. But, since it is difficult to connect emotionally with someone whose focus is inward, that need goes unmet, which increases the self-pity; thus a vicious cycle begins. It can become a thirst that is never satisfied and can become an addictive behavior. Many would rather live with their self-pity because they don't know how they can live without it. They adopt the identity of a victim and want to stay that way."""

stibgock,fe1hnxq,t3_eni4z9,"[Gross Out Alert] 

When I was a teen I had really bad athlete's foot and scratching it was pure Bliss. There was nothing that came close to the euphoria I would experience from getting a good scratch season in: my eyes would roll back, my heart would melt.

But I would scratch to point of my feet being totally disgusting and bloody and if I wasn't actively scratching my feet would hurt really bad. I could not be barefoot or wear sandals at the beach and that was such an embarrassing thing for a teen. My fingers would develop burns from how I was scratching.

There were times when I could not wait to get home from school and scratch. I would even keep my nails cut really short because I could get a real hearty scratch that way.

I remember it eventually started to go away on its own and one day, it was gone. I found myself depressed that I couldn't replicate that feeling. I actually missed my athlete's foot! I thought I was insane!

But after finally being able to chill by the pool and on the sand with my bare feet enjoying the nice sun or Cool breeze or comfy sand, it started to replace the loss of the scratch. It allowed me to socialize more, meet girls and feel confident about my body. That was more important and I think healthier than staying in my room all day, scratching my foot!

Maybe you're feeling that scratch and it feels great momentarily, but it's only a temporary high.

Sorry if this grossed anybody out! I've been thinking about this lately and marveling at the body being able to make such pleasure out of something that looks/should be painful."

Once you do it regularly, it just makes those patterns - addiction to depression, to sadness, to food, drugs, sex, whatever - just go away.  I used to be a binge drinker, and now I barely think about alcohol.  It's the real deal."
champ_mc99,fe08xmo,t1_fe06tpy,Vipassana is focused on sounds isn't it?
str8red,fe0e5d2,t1_fe08xmo,"No, it is focused on sharpening the attention by using the sensation. A little bit of attention sharpening is done at the start sometimes if you can‚Äôt feel any subtle sensations but eventually you just build awareness by using sensations. In fact, it‚Äôs not so easy to be aware of subtle sensations so keeping sounds to a minimum is helpful."
baerbelleksa,fe6ig2b,t1_fe08xmo,Nope.  Observing body sensations as a means to improve awareness and equanimity. :)
RabbitF00d,fe0y2my,t3_eni4z9,"I see this as a monumental post. People do not like to admit this at all, because getting well from depression takes hard work and lifestyle changes. No one wants to do admit that they're doing anything to themselves that would worsen their situation. 

 I commend you. Awareness is the beginning of change."
champ_mc99,fe1worm,t3_eni4z9,"Woke up to a ton of replies, thanks everyone!

Going to carefully read all of these :)"
Bam123321,fe0f0xk,t3_eni4z9,"I have/had the same problem. What you need to do to get out of it is to sit still in a chair and feel the emotion of depression/self pity/hopelessness. Don't pay attention to thoughts or stories, just go back to the emotion and the place in the body you find it to be.

You'll find that it will slowly drain out and your thoughts will somehow be more positive. You may think nothing is happening but you will feel different a few hours later. Start with feeling the emotion 5-10 minutes but aim for more.

The book ""Letting go: the pathway of sutrender"" by David Hawkins covers this technique as well as the pay offs we seek in indulging in lower emotions."
DJH0gan,fe0yrdv,t3_eni4z9,Depression traps you in that way. It offers a safe space which keeps you from reaching your potential. And because of this you begin to accept it as an undeniable truth. But it in fact is a liar.
champ_mc99,fe825dx,t1_fe0yrdv,Wow why is it such a dick?
DJH0gan,fe9ssni,t1_fe825dx,Because its actually you! Surprise! Thats how you treat yourself.
champ_mc99,feav8f9,t1_fe9ssni,I mean damn you're pretty much right.
CrushingMeditation,fe5fdfm,t3_eni4z9,"The part of you that wants to stay depressed, is not you. It is your ego. Your ego is attached to your identity and depression has become a part of your identity. So any efforts you make to crush that depression, is a threat to the ego because it doesn't want to lose that identity. 

In other words, don't  give too much weight to the thoughts that want you to stay down. Ignore them. Or rather, observe them, acknowledge them and let them go - exactly what we do in meditation!

"" I wanted to continue feeling angry and sad so I could continue to feel sorry for myself. "" - This is not you, this is your depression talking. Your depression wants to take over your mind. Do not let it win that battle. *You* deserve to win that battle.

Please continue meditating, and please see a professional if you can.  I want you to know that you matter and you are enough. Hugs!"
30Minds,fe0bntk,t3_eni4z9,Also it feels safer to stay sad. Then no risk of getting happiness and then having it taken away.
MotorcyclePete,fe0epnb,t3_eni4z9,"Allow it to be there. When you have a sad thought just try to say I‚Äôm having a thought of ... 
doing this continuously will slowly start to separate your thoughts from your identity. I believe the term for this is willingness. Look up some videos on YouTube. 
The problem with most of us is that we truly believe we are our thoughts, meditation helps increase awareness of thinking and Ive been using willingness for a little while now to stop bad habits and had some positive results with it. Whenever I feel like smoking a cigarette (I have maybe 2-3 a week) or eat that unhealthy snack I stop and say to myself I‚Äôm having a thought about eating a snack ... you‚Äôll be surprised how with time you start to separate your thoughts from your automatic reactions"
ProfessorFinesser_13,fe0pe9d,t3_eni4z9,"Not crazy at all. Depression is a part of the mind and its important to know about it, if that makes sense. Not a strong overwhelming depression, but a mild, reality setting depression. You can snap out of it quick, but you still feel it for a little bit. Its amazing the depths your mind goes through and how that can altar your physical language, your spiritual being, and your perspective on life and the world."
tripleophiuchus,fe0sle7,t3_eni4z9,"Your brain might also be addicted to it. 

But yes it‚Äôs true, everyone is complicit in their own misery."
FoxThaSage,fe1o3bp,t3_eni4z9,"The sadness is often a compass, it lets you be vulnerable within your subconscious as it leads into conscious thought. Being that sadness is a somatic emotion it is a strong one that takes us over unconsciously; it is also one we use to process our other sensation and organize our thought. 
There is no flawed emotion, to feel sadness or even anger is often passion or a desire to improve upon your current state of life. Your heart is caring for you in those moments, in its own odd way; so to speak."
TunneltotheSun,fe1urlr,t3_eni4z9,"The brain enjoys playing out old patterns. Depression is a part of you now. But it's a less fulfilling part than what could be in its place. 
There's nothing wrong with trying something new. If you're looking to become a more evolved human that has peace and joy in their every moment, that self pity will have to go. And it will be so much more wonderful when it does."
djompom,fe2ssme,t3_eni4z9,"Finding balance in your life is important, if you don't have balance the ego wants to attach to a less wide array of feelings (sometimes only one)"
curkri,fe3rjvy,t3_eni4z9,"It's harder to fix a problem than tolerate it. We become familiar with our flaws and relate to them as if they are our self. But we can change if we put the hard work in, it is possible to change yourself and then become comfortable with those changes."
BoredKidy,fe3x7pm,t3_eni4z9,"For me it often feels like depression is a safety mechanism for my brain. On one side all i want is a good life but on the other side thinking about what i would have to do for that gives me anxiety, so i jump in the hole of depression and hide myself in self pity from reality."
LiveBullfrog,fe47sdo,t3_eni4z9,"""When you keep your mouth shut and endure everything, you become a coward. As you put up with it, your self-pity grows. You just sit there and lick your wounds. People are competitive about how unfortunate they are. Maybe feeling like the most unfortunate person in the world gives you the very same pleasure as being the happiest person in the world. Being happy seems so simple, yet it‚Äôs very difficult."" -Juuni Kokuki"
HypeToHype,fe4g851,t3_eni4z9,A big reason why I'm depressed is because it's more comfortable. I think when we feel really down it's a strong feeling and you cant get any lower. Less to lose. (A big one) Less responsibilities . It's tough to have a good outlook when you see things how they are too. You see all the struggling people and question why do I deserve this
Osellic,fe0c5fm,t3_eni4z9,"Perhaps it‚Äôs because you are currently identified with it, and through that inflating your sense of self, or labeling yourself with those feelings.

Such as, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sad because ___, people misunderstand me and don‚Äôt realize how deep I am.‚Äù 

I‚Äôd recommend reading A New Earth.

Congratulations on your discovery and blossoming awareness!"
JotaroJotaro,fe1lut7,t3_eni4z9,"This is well detailed in the 4 noble truths from Buddhism. While we exist whiout meditation our untrained mind travels to negative states so it looks like is natural but is just uncontrolled mind. (Things of living in society)

In my case meditation is an habit because  I crave it like is food that our body needs to work properly. So don't wait until you are depressed to meditate  because is going to be really hard, like learning to swim when you are drowning, meditate more and mostly when you are more happy and healthy and it will multiply.!! Good luck."
Run_Che,fe3rxy0,t3_eni4z9,Read book Power of Now. It addresses this exact thing that you described.
champ_mc99,fe4mzmc,t1_fe3rxy0,I'm about half way :p
brander20,fe4on2p,t3_eni4z9,"I think you are having the same thought a lot of people have about depression. You want it to have purpose because of the forced self-consciousness, and you want to explore it as a beneficial thing because the process of extreme negative self-reflection can be beneficial. You are processing your sense of agency and your sense of embodiment in a world, and in that process the emotions exist as a type of verified reality, or your embodied sense of your situation. That teaches you to reflect in a manner that sets your attitude towards a narrative. You're basically allowing a reality to exist around you because of an uninhibited passivity. 

It reminds me of falling in and out of sleep, or like healing, or those times when you're a kid when you have your first flu or bad cold. You probably got a lot of attention, you probably went through a mini crisis of boredom. You had to learn to think through the process. You had to have a narrative to getting better, taking control. You probably got a sense of purpose from getting sick and then getting better. Almost like you're inviting sickness into you because of the tedium of your life.

Have you ever meditated on a mountain in the middle of winter? The entire world is very cold and beautiful."
A_drien,fe5b4tc,t3_eni4z9,"During the changes you are going to encounter during this transition and even after, you have to know that you are now strong enough to face these feelings with a new approach, getting only the good stuff (remembering where you come from and how far you have traveled, etc. ) and learning to make the best out of the sadness (which can be used as a fuel or as a way to put your new life's challenges in perspective). 
You already achieved a lot and the rest of the journey is worth taking a leap into an unknown you, even out of curiosity!"
capbassboi,fe5y2p3,t3_eni4z9,"Don't worry, I've come to the same realisation in the past. Being depressed and moody became part of my identity, and without I didn't know what I'd become and I wasn't ready to grow past the easy limitations that I placed upon myself. I think a lot of people like being depressed but they don't want to realise it, and OBVIOUSLY this doesn't go for all depressed people in the absolute slightest"
seanmcdon,envc75,top_level,"I am 39. 

I‚Äôve always loved the idea of meditation, back into my teens even. But I never really ‚Äúgot it‚Äù until this past holiday break. Then this sub just keeps reinforcing and supporting me. 

I was going to sleep after 3-4 hours of heavy conversation with extended family. I just kind of let my head ‚Äúlisten‚Äù to all the voices of my family members - speaking random things in their own voices - going 100 mph - and I just let it go instead of fighting it. I did not try to silence it - it was actually funny and enjoyable. I was surprised at how quickly I relaxed. And also the sounds died away quickly. 

This sub has since supported me understanding what meditation truly is!"
guitarino,fe80v8x,t3_envc75,"That's what acceptance means. You're there and you observe without judgement, without reaction."
Invisible_Peas,fe9ux65,t3_envc75,"Meditation is very simple. It‚Äôs the benefits that it brings that can make the difference. All anyone needs for mediation is to put some time aside, and be able to sit still."
redditKeyy,fe5tzef,t3_envc75,"What is meditation, truly?"
phallingFantom,fe6n3ue,t1_fe5tzef,The practice of bringing your concentration to a single point.  Samadhi.
Dario56,fe6sl9y,t1_fe5tzef,Being concentrated on something in the present moment :)
Jake19031997,fe8eoue,t1_fe5tzef,"I guess meditation is just that state of being within yourself, while expanding out at the same time.
It's about acknowledging the chaos within, making peace with it and looking at things from a neutral, non biased point of view."
Wollff,fe7yq2w,t1_fe5tzef,"Sitting around, while doing very little."
Alpha_Bit_Poop,fe6gmvq,t1_fe5z4yy,"Truly, meditation *is*.
