Gentleman was Dominican so maybe different connotation there?"

Cheeseand0nions,fdloayy,t1_fdldiih,"OP here.

I live in a fantasy world where all these women had good stable long-term relationships in their daytime life and simply indulge the fantasy of being naughty naughty girls at their own pleasure.

Please don't mess that up for me with the reality that ""sex workers""  are often, almost always victims of terrible abuse who are incapable of truly enjoying one of life's greatest pleasures."
nos4atugoddess,fdl90z5,t1_fdl2o34,I think you are right because mami always skeeves me out but I’ve only ever heard it in the form of a catcall so maybe it’s context too

XtarXyan,fdkstw7,t1_fdkldmd,I thought they used *tovarishch*

Edit: Thx for the discussion. A lot more prevalent than I realized. My perspective is in comparison to my Deep South American heritage where it is used both earnestly and profusely, especially with anyone who is your elder, both within and without your family group. It’s kind of a voluntary over-enforced sign of manners, but it is rare for people to assume it’s being used facetiously."

jduska,fdowu4q,t1_fdosk61,That’s hella cute man
kbs8707,fdp2qex,t1_fdosk61,Maybe your kid wants to make you feel useful and enjoy spending time together with you just like you with your dad lol.
StpPstngMmsOnMyPrnAp,fdp2co9,t1_fdosk61,That is without a doubt the most wholesome comment I have ever seen.
Randyismymom,fdp3e9k,t1_fdosk61,"Do you have any tips on how to get your kid to want to spend time with you like that? My dad is a good guy and was nice to me for the most part, not crazy strict, but for some reason growing up I never saw him as a friend like other kids saw their dads. I kinda wonder why that is and worry that the same thing will happen with my kids"
batmessiah,fdp75lk,t1_fdosk61,"I’m 37, and my dad will be 70 this year.  He and I have had a rough 15 years, not having the greatest relationship.  Now that I have a daughter, we’re both trying really hard to keep in touch more, and talk on the regular.  Just last week, he drove down to help me build two 8’ long work benches, so one of my garage walls is now effectively a 16’ workbench.  I mentioned wanting to build a deck this spring, and he’s already helping me draw up plans for it all.

I could totally handle this by myself, but I know he enjoys coming down and helping me, and it gives us a reason to spend time together."
densetsu23,fdp5xwb,t1_fdosk61,"I wish I could do that with my dad. He grew up poor and does ghetto fixes on things; him and my mom raised us well and gave us opportunities, and we're all upper middle class.

I want to do fixes the right way -- buy the right materials, do it well, do it safe. But dad is still stuck in ghetto mode, like skipping the ground wire when adding new outlets (""copper is expensive!""). Opting for untreated lumber when the wood will get wet. Not replacing rotten plywood on the roof when replacing shingles. (That one my brother and I just bought for them and did ourselves.)

My brother and I try to teach him now, it's almost backwards lol. Tough to teach that old dog new tricks though."
icecreamsandwitch,fdp5vgs,t1_fdosk61,"aw man. at 29, im still working through my pattern of being competitive with my dad and establishing independence. i dont like getting much help from him and when he tries to help, my tendency is to argue and prove that i dont need him. it's something im aware of and working on so that our relationship can improve."

TonyTontanaSanta,fdphtta,t1_fdosk61,"Ive started doing this with my father aswell, we never had a really good relationship growing up he being grumpy always gonna have his way and that pushed me into being kind of rebellion and definitely not going along with his way. Recently I noticed his physical health had deteroriated and I just felt like shit and put everything aside and he showed me how to do lasagna and spaghetti with meatsauce (he is incredibly serious about those two dishes) and he also been teaching me how to play on horses (Im already in debt because of that shit but he enjoys it so I put a few dollars down when were together).

Im just under 30 hes going on just over 70 and this is a cliche but life is too short to be petty against those close to you. Plus I know he is a petty bastard because I have a bunch of family on his side I've never met because he and his Sister dont talk and knowing him it was probably about the remote control or something and neither of them would give it up lol."

Thornblade,fdp5uq1,t1_fdp3e9k,I'm in the same boat as you. My dad worked nonstop to provide us with the things he couldn't have when he was younger so I don't have a close relationship with him at all. I'm worried I'm going to be the same because even without kids I work like he did just for cushion...
LucSanchezMD,fdp9j4v,t1_fdp3e9k,"Honestly I just picked up a couple of maths books one day geared towards 5yr olds and just try and make it exciting for her and encourage her. I read somewhere that kids learn a lot this age by just the parent taking an interest, nothing more. They see it as a positive experience because they get one on one time with you where you are focused on just them. Best way to learn and build a lasting relationship."
serpentjaguar,fdpi85s,t1_fdp75lk,"Dig it while you can, man.  I'm 50 and my dad died when I was 40, due to long-term alcoholism.  He was a damn fine human being, but the war in Vietnam fucked him up in ways that he never fully recovered from.  

He could build houses from scratch and could completely tear apart and rebuild any motor vehicle that was made prior to the '90s.  

He built a road and a bridge into his remote Northern Californian property, down miles of dirt roads, built a house out there, and then slowly drank himself to an early death.  

I miss my dad."
LucSanchezMD,fdp9xw7,t1_fdp5xwb,My father in law is ghetto like that. I now get him to show me stuff that my own dad doesn't do a lot of anymore and is safe for the most part like wood turning. The stuff he makes comes out pretty wonky but he enjoys it and the kids don't know any different except that grandpa made them something and that's awesome.
ave_empirator,fdp7l96,t1_fdp5vgs,"It can be frustrating working with your dad sometimes but man, don't miss out on a second of it. The other weird thing about being around 30 is how the composition of your family can change quickly, both additions and subtractions."
Cheeseisextra,fdp7368,t1_fdp5vgs,"Yep. I'm 50 and my dad told me ""you are on your own now"" after I watched my mom die right in front of me when I was 19 years old. Life will really smack you upside the head if you aren't ready for it."
LucSanchezMD,fdp9nt0,t1_fdp5vgs,That was pretty much me until I had kids to be honest. My relationship with my dad has improved a lot in the last 5 years.

icecreamsandwitch,fdpq0gc,t1_fdp9nt0,that's somewhat reassuring to know. a part of me intuitively knows that i would regret a lot of my interactions with my dad once i become a dad myself.

All “real” adults can be as (and are often even more) immature, petty and existentially lost as you are. Even if theyre in high profile careers, with children, homes etc. 

Don’t worry about it. I have to remind myself this all the time."

Crunkbutter,fdpa8cw,t1_fdorv8q,"Haha I just think of how stupid I was and eventually you just encourage them to have fun as teenagers but don't be so stupid that you harm other people. I'm ex-mil so I got to see the young guys do the same dumb shit I did and I could never be mad at them, lol.

You know they're not going to pick up your advice for years if it ever means anything to them at all.

Also I feel like a total idiot teenager around people older than me"
curiousbydesign,fdp2psj,t1_fdp1xcx,"My wife and I have a game - we are mid-thirties. We have two stuffed kids balls from IKEA - one for each of us. The rules are you cannot throw the ball at each other. You have to kick it. Sometimes I nail her booty while she is getting ready in the upstairs guest bathroom from the downstairs living room. Then I throw my hands up and cheer like I scored the game-ending goal in the World Cup.

We live in front of a stop sign and keep our windows opened most of the time. I am sure our neighbors are concerned but we are simply living our best life."
Lazarus_Pits,fdp4upu,t1_fdp1xcx,"As a 32 yr old doing their practicum as a therapist, this is 100% true.

LazarusCrowley,fdp5747,t1_fdp2psj,"I, up until recently worked at a pretty well known place in the field I worked in. We needed to be professional, respectful and neatly dressed. 

I had 5 roommates in an, admittedly, giant house. (1 couple / 4 rms)

One day it was decided when someone did something invariably stupid, we'd just sorta. . .ambush them with nerf guns and bows chanting them down with the naughty thing. I was often ambushed with, ""Laundry, Asshole!""

webernicke,fdphml6,t1_fdp58u6,"Are we though?

I mean it's a comforting, relatable Millennial cliche to claim that nobody knows how to adult, but when it comes down to brass tacks there's a real variation in having one's shit together. We all know people the that will laugh at the same adulting memes but, like, some people still have a family, successful career, relationships, house and some still live in the same room and work the same job they did in highschool."

TheMindSelf,fdp32te,t1_fdp0kc8,"/u/sgush7861 I turned 28 at the end of November and I have a question for you two. I hope both of you are male and in the dating scene *or at least were during your high 20s*. Alrighty. Don't y'all have problems identifying the age of women? I look at too many women and have no idea if they are..25 or 32. 22 or 28. Etc. Hell, some take good care of themselves and look around my age only to find out they're 35."

crapircornsniper88,fdpvii6,t1_fdp32te,I turned 32 yesterday. I don't believe it. Most people assume I'm early to mid 20s. I still feel 21 with no fucking clue. The thought of having kids is as scary as it was in highschool.
Onomatopesha,fdpc2qc,t1_fdp32te,"29yr old teacher about to hit 30, I teach people from all ages. I think regarding looks, 27 yr Olds onwards are the ones that stand out the most. I'm not necessarily saying all 27s are like that, but there's a physical transition at that age range for both men and women that you just can't ignore.

However the easiest tell tale sign of age is the moment they speak; how do they handle a conversation, how they deal other people and how they express their frustrations. 

In my case, I'm still trying to learn from everyone, some teens are extremely adept at expressing their feelings, while other adults (late 20s, early 30s) still show difficulties doing the simplest of social tasks."
RickZanches,fdp7qdu,t1_fdp32te,It's tough. I have the same problem. I usually go based off personality. Only let me down once lol

DaggerMoth,fdp7am0,t1_fdosn2e,I think it's been skewed. I think people that were young when we were young look older than the people of the same age look today.  It's hard to tell anymore.  Like fit people of the past even look like donkeys.

lookoutforthebadger,fdp9m95,t3_emgow3,"I think the trick is that there's no actual age where you become a ""real adult."" You just reach a point where you mostly stop giving a shit how much of an adult you are considered to be and start living life as you are. Hopefully by that point, you've matured significantly or you're going to be a very toxic person to deal with who is set in their ways.

Edit: Also, I wonder if the solidity largely comes from accepting your weaknesses as a reality that you aren't going to change and/or learning how to work around them. I mean, you can swap in some of your strengths/weaknesses for other ones along the way, but you can't escape having flaws."

ReasonAndWanderlust,fdpeokg,t1_fdpbb6n,"I spent my combat tour during the ""surge"" with teenagers because they all joined the army when they were 18.

Then I went to college when I got back.

The difference in these two types of teenagers was so radical its hard to believe they were both from the same society."
TrippingOnCrack,fdpf4pa,t1_fdpeokg,That's an interesting perspective. Care to share some examples?
ReasonAndWanderlust,fdpoiym,t1_fdpf4pa,"One of the more obvious examples would be social interaction; When you hang out with  soldiers from the war you'll get nicknames that accurately describe a defining feature you have even if that feature is something a civilian would be horrified to be known by.  I was older than the teens in the war so you can expect nicknames that reflect your identity. ""Pops"", ""Old man"", ""Wolfman"" ""Zeus"". This nickname can be racist as fuck but it doesn't matter what ethnicity or religion you are. It matters because of *who* you are.  It can even be based on the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to you. Some guys in the military have names you wouldn't say in front of your mother. In fact you can call people ""Motherfucker"" in the military it just motivates them. You can get into fist fights yet you'll be friends later because you're invested in their future. You'll know them tomorrow. *Really* know them. You love them like a brother. The military is harsh but it's a meritocracy and you learn to love it.

You try any of that shit with a teenager in college and you'll get kicked out of the school.  I don't know how many times a young soldier has told me about their first interaction with a civilian once they get out of the military. It's like they visit another world. People are late. People lie to your face. People smile in a smart ass way when you get pissed at them for not doing their job. In the military world if that financial aid guy was late or told you something that wasn't true or was incompetent he would get his ass fucking destroyed by his superiors.   He would lose pay and get disciplined. People's heads would roll until it gets fixed because in the military world you'll die if you don't fix it. When you take a young dude who became an adult *in that world* and suddenly place him in front of a college financial aid desk  it's not  pretty. One ends up acting like a sniveling incompetent little worm and the other acts like an aggressive jerk and so they both walk away wondering what the fuck is wrong with civilians/veterans. 

and take note I'm not saying either group of people is right or wrong. This process can be extremely difficult  for a veteran. It would be easy to say veterans are more independent and self disciplined. It would easy for me to say you'll never hear about a veteran not being able to change a flat tire or be late to school because of it. But in reality that's not always a sign that you're doing things the right way. A veteran should learn to rely on others and call someone for assistance or help. 

Sorry for the long answer for just an example."

There is no innate ""betterness"" someone can have over you, only the illusion of it. If you look at other people and see them with the things you think you're supposed to have, try to remember that what you think you're supposed to have is also based on what other people say and do. Don't think of yourself as lagging behind in some imaginary race, instead value how far you've come and how far you can still go. The finish line is the same for everyone anyway."

It sucks being home all the time but it's worth it to me when you get to experience an entirely different culture for two weeks straight.

My memory's not great, I'm not good at making instant friends in strange towns, and I don't take a lot of pictures, plus once the travel demon eats my money I never get to do as many things as I'd like. Once I've spent $2000 on some travel I get home thinking about the nice thing I could have gotten for $2000 and enjoyed every day of the year. It took a full year to put together that $2000. This computer could have a 2080 in it, and a damn Threadripper, probably. Or I could have bought a nice chair, instead of the brokebacked thing I'm sitting on now.

What if something comes up and I can’t go and get kicked out of the group? These aren’t the only things my brain can come up with, but I want to be able to fall asleep tonight and shouldn’t spend time thinking up more. 

Telling myself there are always reasons not to do something hasn’t helped. Telling myself that they’re just excuses hasn’t helped. Asking myself, “What if I have a great time and everything is perfect?” isn’t enough.

After a day in the outdoors my muscles ache like crazy. I'm lucky enough to have a desk job, so my work doesn't physically exhaust me. I have enough energy to pursue my hobbies. But damn if it isn't a struggle to get off my ass and leave my comfortable apartment every single time."

Being human is no easy feat. Being you is an outstanding thing.

Change is imminent, and in situations where your current status quo will be changing, it can seem like staying stagnant and safe is the best option. But that’s not the case. Change can be good and in a lot of my own personal cases, has led to more joy in my life than before.

There’s a quote from the Office said by Andy that I like a lot: “I wish there was a way to know you’re in the good old days before you’ve actually left them.” 

The good news is that you’re aware of the short time you have left in school and I’ve found that being present and aware to be the more difficult things to be when you’re young. 

Good luck with your last few months of school! I hope it all goes well for you, and your transition into your next big stage of life goes smoothly :)"

Phoenix334,fdjhapu,t3_elpm6f,Yo what bands u listen to?
plagueisthedumb,fdjinsc,t1_fdjhapu,Melodic death metal bands
Shotty98,fdjlfsz,t1_fdjhapu,Death! They're amazing!
BoobsAndGuitars,fdjo3h9,t1_fdjhapu,Opeth and Gojira are sometimes melodic and super good.
Kenjamin91,fdjnqo2,t1_fdjhapu,Dark Tranquillity! Character is probably my fav album.
MajinVader,fdjpxyv,t1_fdjhapu,"I'd definitely recommend Ne Obliviscaris, as someone else in the comments already has. They're amazing! You can't really go wrong with any of their albums. If you prefer purely instrumental music, though, I can't speak highly enough of Angel Vivaldi. His most recent album, Synapse, is a masterpiece, in my eyes."
thanksforallthedicks,fdjspck,t1_fdjhapu,Gotta be slinging some BLACK DAHLIA MURDER
4e696b,fdjswq2,t1_fdjhapu,"Since everyone started mentioning bands that are not melo-death, I will also do that. Check out Rivers of Nihil, Fleshgod Apocalypse, Vale of Pnath, and Black Crown Initiate."
chiefyk,fdjovzn,t1_fdjhapu,The latest Fit For an Autopsy album is well worth a spin. My favroute album from last year.
thedavidbjorn1,fdjphzg,t1_fdjhapu,I think insomnium is currently the best melodic death band.
BlackWhiteRedYellow,fdjo3ip,t1_fdjhapu,"The ocean, gojira, ISIS"
EDtetraestheticA,fdjrgso,t1_fdjhapu,"Probably not melodic death but Avatar, Powerwolf, and Sabaton are all good"
Radguyjake69420,fdjvwm2,t1_fdjhapu,"Cattle Decapitations new album Death Atlas is pretty brutal as fuck, but is super melodic parts. A top album of 2019 for sure would check it out"

ranarrdealer,fdjtshv,t1_fdjhapu,Carcass ofc.
KKShiz,fdjrwx9,t1_fdjhapu,"Haven't heard anyone mentioned Threat Signal yet. Also, August Burns Red, Inferi, Bleed From Within, and some of Carcass's discography is melodic death metal."
Lemak0,fdjtq2v,t1_fdjhapu,Dont forget Kreator
Fossekall,fdjuqv2,t1_fdjhapu,"Everyone should check out ""In Mourning""."
Oray388,fdjx99n,t1_fdjhapu,Intestine Baalism. You can thank me later.
acethetix,fdjzwj0,t1_fdjhapu,Born of Osiris and Veil of Maya

Ghost reveries was an awesome album though."
TerrainIII,fdjo89c,t1_fdjo3h9,What album by Gojira would you say? I’ve only heard a song or two from Magma.
Sauceror,fdjtyqm,t1_fdjo3h9,"I absolutely love The Mars Volta, though I couldn't tell you what the hell that music is (Electro synth melodic rock/metal whatever). But it's melodic as fuck. 'Octahedron' is an amazing album and I have never not loved it. It's just incredibly moody and melancholic while also having high energy."

Kiri-SuteGomen,fdk16gi,t1_fdjspck,Fuck yeah. TBDM is the most death metal band I can think of that still counts as melodic death metal. They're brutal as fuck.

empyreanmax,fdjwx17,t1_fdjphzg,"Check out Belzebubs if you haven't. Melodic black, but it's a virtual band a la Dethklok. The real members are anonymous, except the vocalist is pretty well understood to be from Insomnium."
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjsy5d,t1_fdjphzg,Them and Kalmah are two of the most underrated bands out there.
Fl4shbang,fdjy903,t1_fdjo3ip,"Is gojira considered melodic death metal? I don't even know how what genre they are, but I do like a bunch of their songs."
BigBluntBurner,fdjy5j0,t1_fdjrgso,Not even close my dude
empyreanmax,fdjy97k,t1_fdjrgso,If you like power metal check out Ascension by Paladin. It's their first full-length and just came out last year.

Inferi is probably techdeath"
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjncht,t1_fdjltvc,"Insomnium, Soilwork, At The Gates, Dark Tranquillity, In Flames (90's albums), Children of Bodom, Be'lakor, Amorphis, and Kalmah are a good starting point."

woodsoffeels,fdjrbxt,t1_fdjltvc,CARCASS
HoodoftheMountain,fdju72a,t1_fdjltvc,"Allegaeon's latest album ""Apoptosis"" is one of the best of 2019 imo. I absolutely love ""Stellar Tidal Disruption"" from it. Also ""The Secular Age"". 

A little less melodic but love Cattle Decapitation's new album ""Death Atlas"". ""Bring back the Plague"" ""With all disrespect"" ""One day closer to the end of the world"". Are some favorites from it."

LockeLamoraLies,fdjydxf,t1_fdjltvc,On top of what was already named. Mors principium est and ablaze my sorrow are great.
Talrand01,fdk0s1p,t1_fdjltvc,"Æther Realm, Wolfheart, Ex Deo, and Eluveitie (more folk death) are among my favorite death metal bands right now."
Shadyacr2,fdkyyj1,t1_fdjltvc,Holographic universe is 🤙
HypatiaRising,fdk0u4z,t1_fdjltvc,"Darkest Hour is great. Here are some albums to check out:

Godless Prophets and the Migrant Flora

Deliver Us

Undoing Ruin

Hidden Hands of the Sadist Nation"

alwaysnefarious,fdk1x9t,t1_fdjltvc,"Dethklok is amazing, I only discovered them recently but am addicted now."
_Letum_,fdk3oi4,t1_fdjltvc,"Check out Avatar, ""paint me red""is probably my favorite song"
kmach1ne,fdk448z,t1_fdjltvc,"Some of my favorites are Death, Gojira, Carcass (they're more grindcore), The Absence, Words of Farewell, and to some extent Opeth."
DjSigal,fdjp2r8,t1_fdjo9n1,"Ah yes, a fellow circle clicker. ICDD indeed is pretty fucking awesome, but unlucky morpheus is also really frickin good in my opinion."
Anduin_Lothar,fdjlb0u,t1_fdjl2az,I lost a lot of respect for them after the whole photographer fiasco.
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjuwdy,t1_fdjpel1,"I agree. Watershed was decent, but holy shit did it pale compared to the genius of Ghost Reveries."
SexyWhitedemoman,fdkczuf,t1_fdjpel1,"Check out Ne Obliviscaris, they sort of capture the feel of early Opeth without sounding like a blatant rip off. My personal favorite song in Forget Not."
BoobsAndGuitars,fdjo9yl,t1_fdjo89c,"Are you more into heavy stuff, melodic stuff, or progressive stuff?

From Mars to Sirius, Magma, and The Way of All Flesh; respectively you the previous mentioned genres."
demonbrew66,fdjpe87,t1_fdjo89c,Start with Magma and work backward through their discography. It that order each album gets progressively heavier. Gojira never made a bad album IMHO. L'Enfant Sauvage is soooooo fucking good
KKShiz,fdjrjoj,t1_fdjo89c,"As someone else mentioned, if you listen to their catalog in reverse, they'll get heavier. I still love them, but each proceeding album gets softer and softer. Not a huge fan of Magma relative to their previous stuff. The Link is my personal favorite. Not a bad song to be found on it. The Way of All Flesh is great too. Some sick drum work on that album."
AWanderersStar,fdjw4p9,t1_fdjnvzo,Im all about Skydancer
sheepholio,fdk5s0x,t1_fdk16gi,Yeah I've always put them in a completely separate category from all the other Melodic DM bands

You were right btw, I've just listened to the latest Xenobiotic song, some good shit!"

thedavidbjorn1,fdlxigq,t1_fdjwx17,"You’re right it really sounds like Nilo Sevanen, love it. I feel embarrassed that I didn’t know about it. I have two pictures with Nilo 10 years apart ..."
Thecrazywizards,fdk30ug,t1_fdjy903,Death/groove with tech-death elements
Toeknee99,fdk6fsn,t1_fdjy903,I can confidently say they are Technical Death metal.
Radguyjake69420,fdk635w,t1_fdk5xfs,Agreed. I really really enjoy the melodic parts of this album. Literally the only “complaint” I have is I feel like there’s just a TINY lack of heavy parts. Finish Them and the Japanese bonus track are two tracks that are brutal front tier back and I wish there was like one more song like that lol
Talrand01,fdjr6wr,t1_fdjncht,"Amon Amarth was my gateway drug, personally."
WaitingCuriously,fdjnt4e,t1_fdjncht,Sucks you gotta specify a certain erra for in flames.
MiredInIrony,fdjrdxr,t1_fdjncht,Check out Mors Principium Est and Sunnata bro

kennykerosene,fdjv51s,t1_fdjncht,"And if you like these check out Ensiferum, Mors Principium Est, Wintersun, Suidakra, Tyr, and Harikiri for the Sky."
NammyNammy123,fdjvlmd,t1_fdjncht,Be'lakor is my jam. If you're looking for something similar Ne Obliviscaris is also very good.

Nopetheworld,fdjomzd,t1_fdjncht,"Fuck yeah, good taste"
princam_,fdk0ktv,t1_fdjncht,Love to see some Amorphis representation out here
dis_the_chris,fdjoj5c,t1_fdjncht,Bodom best melo band
KenkerDebiel,fdjstk3,t1_fdjncht,I love necrophagist but that is more on the techincal than melodic side. Still the solo’s have great melody!
cheapcab,fdjudwe,t1_fdjncht,Wintersun also.
Catsu_Miola,fdjwoa7,t1_fdjncht,Hahaha I'm listening to Soilwork rn

SuperSalad_OrElse,fdkjhbu,t1_fdjncht,"All hail the masterpiece album “Colony”!

In Flames was my gateway into metal when I was a kid. It was hard to find their stuff, had to order it through Barnes and Nobles"
Mistress_Stephanie,fdjrl46,t1_fdjod5l,"Ne Obliviscaris is amazing. I’ve also been really into Wilderun lately, and Crypt Sermon (though they’re more doom)"
Trashcyon,fdk0opy,t1_fdjod5l,"Aether realm is badass! I bought there first album and when I got it the jewel case was empty. So I messaged the  band faceboom and the singer added me and was like dude what size shirt too and we will send you one with a new cd. He sent me a download link for the digital, A shirt, two signed stickers saying they loved me lol and my cd."
PieIsGross,fdmhs1m,t1_fdjngit,Yo I checked em out and they're fucking sick!
FluffyYuuki,fdjo994,t1_fdjngit,Not yet. But I will
FluffyYuuki,fdjwhct,t1_fdjngit,"Really love Japanese metal. I listen to a lot of Japanese Power Metal, like Bridear, Mary's Blood, Aldious. Great recommendation"
FluffyYuuki,fdjwe73,t1_fdju72a,Really liking the Apoptosis album. Thanks for the recommendation
Divergence1048596,fdjuifb,t1_fdju72a,"Best cattle decap album so far, I reckon they just keep getting better."

RIP Josef ben Meddour."
NicksAunt,fdjp886,t1_fdjnzde,Caladan Brood like from fuckin Malzan?
FluffyYuuki,fdjwcri,t1_fdjtex4,"I got into death metal pretty late. I first listened to them around 2012, and my first album was Holographic Universe, which is still my favorite Scar Symmetry album right now"
FluffyYuuki,fdjsok8,t1_fdjs4nf,"I mostly love the show, but the instrumental is really well composed for me"
SyStRm,fdjuei4,t1_fdjrf8i,I like Meshuggah too! Doesn't really fit melodic metal though. Probably Metalcore?( I don't know)
FluffyYuuki,fdlpc8w,t1_fdkyyj1,14 yro me was blown away by the album
mattymufc,fdjlo2o,t1_fdjlb0u,"I don't know who you are talking about, but what is this fiasco? Care to share?"
nerdyogre254,fdjqvm6,t1_fdjlb0u,"Yeah, I dumped them off my big playlist after that shit. Probably means nothing to them financially, but it is what it is."
Kiri-SuteGomen,fdk0tl5,t1_fdjlb0u,I lost a lot of respect for them when I realized they have such a stacked lineup talent wise but still choose to release such uninspired melodeath. They helped get me into more extreme styles of metal so they will always have a special place for that but they have been very mediocre for a long time now.
thedavidbjorn1,fdlwwlm,t1_fdkczuf,Thanks man that song is good
TerrainIII,fdjobpl,t1_fdjo9yl,"I’d say melodic, though there’s always a couple songs from other genres that catch my ear. Thanks for the info!"
Penis-Butt,fdk0wmm,t1_fdk0j4z,This whole thread is a goldmine of new bands to listen to.
Snowing_Throwballs,fdk26u9,t1_fdk0j4z,Hydra is a fucking hype song as well
sheepholio,fdk6bbx,t1_fdk635w,"Finish Them was definitely my favorite song on the album. It was nice to have just a mindlessly heavy track to take a break from all of the technical riffing and black metal-esque passages, so it stood out to me, but I enjoyed pretty much every part of the album regardless"
TheUnwritenMyth,fdjt97o,t1_fdjr6wr,"I started out with Gaurdians of Asgard and they got me into death metal, though In Flames had a part in getting me into metal as a whole."
Oh_Pun_Says_Me,fdkhvcb,t1_fdjr6wr,"In the late 90's when Golden Hall came out, I was blown away.  God that Victorious March."
chanandlerbong420,fdk21dh,t1_fdjr6wr,Imo if you already listen to amon amarth you don't need any other death metal bands
theonetruehoff,fdjxtqx,t1_fdjr6wr,"Ensiferum here, Amon Amarth came immediately afterwards."
Lbohnrn,fdjzv1f,t1_fdjr6wr,Love me some Viking metal. Does Dimmu Borgir count? I remember liking Into Eternity back in the day too if we’re looking for bands not mentioned yet.
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjnvak,t1_fdjnt4e,"It does, looking at Jester Race and Colony then looking at the last 10-15 years is so disappointing."
Medd_Ler,fdk4b9w,t1_fdjnt4e,erra is a good prog metal band :)
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjrhrn,t1_fdjrdxr,"Ah shit, I forgot about Mors Principium Est, and Swallow The Sun come to think of it! I'll give Sunnata a look. I also forgot Stam1na, they sing in Finnish."
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjshz0,t1_fdjsguv,Digging the name. They're painfully underrated.
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjv9kb,t1_fdjv51s,"I'm a fan of Ensiferum, Mors Principium Est, Winter Sun and Try. I forgot to mention them, same as Swallow the Sun. I will give Suidaka and Harikiri for the Sky a look though!"
TheWhiteBuffalo,fdk2yov,t1_fdjv51s,"Havnt listened to much of Suidakra's music yet, but Ive come across both Birog's Oath and Over Nine Waves and I fuckin love those ones."
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjvpu0,t1_fdjvlmd,"I'm a big fan of both bands, I live in Melbourne where they're from :). Check out Twelve Foot Ninja, they're from Melbourne too, they're not prog, but do alot of genre jumping/bending."
SexyWhitedemoman,fdkcbjj,t1_fdjvlmd,Ne Obliviscaris is the only band I've been able to find that scratches that Opeth itch. Do you know any others?
KersZZ,fdki1v3,t1_fdjvlmd,Ne Obliviscaris is life. Love them.
KKShiz,fdjr8w6,t1_fdjpnmn,"I've listened to it many times now, and I'm almost certain Verkligheten is my favorite of their catalog. For me, they really captured magic in that album. The Panic Broadcast is a close second.

EDIT: I love how everyone who responded to me has a different favorite album. Soilwork rules."
JekkuPekku,fdjsdpz,t1_fdjoj5c,Agreed
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjsvw8,t1_fdjstk3,"Still an amazing band, I'd rate them up there with Cattle Decapitation and old-medium era Decapitated."
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjwx5v,t1_fdjwoa7,"I like all of Soilwork, but their first four albums are just godly."
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdkzyj2,t1_fdkjhbu,"Lunar Strain through to, and including Clayman are amazing. Colony has always been my favourite but, I have no idea why."
HoodoftheMountain,fdjw2s8,t1_fdjuifb,"Absolutely. I can't say I have a favorite but ""Monolith of Inhumanity""  is a hard contender with it."
TheoreticalPlayer,fdjsoai,t1_fdjp886,"Dope, just started reading garden of the moon."
WillTDP,fdjtg5a,t1_fdjsok8,"Never watched the show, are there instrumentals?"
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjunwu,t1_fdjuei4,"They're kind of their own thing. They spawned djent, but aren't djent. Probably Avant-garde?
Metalcore is like Bullet for my Valentine, Killswitch Engage, As I Lay Dying that kind of stuff."
Anduin_Lothar,fdjn2vr,t1_fdjlo2o,"The OP of this thread summarizes it well in the comments.

Anduin_Lothar,fdk2a8r,t1_fdk0tl5,"I totally agree. The only reason I still listened to them was because I was a big fan of Michael Amott, but the band definitely sounded pretty uninspired and generic with their later stuff. Totally dropped them after the incident though."
BoobsAndGuitars,fdjodgo,t1_fdjobpl,"Katatonia is such a good melodic metal band, their album, Dead End Kings is 10/10"
RevengimusMaximus,fdkxn5p,t1_fdjt97o,"Fuuuuuck I used to listen to so much In Flames, thanks for the reminder"
Muserallusion,fdjxn8y,t1_fdjnvak,"In Flames:  The Metallica of melodic death. 

(A few great albums and then decades of mediocrity or worse.)"
MegaFonz,fdjo45o,t1_fdjnvak,They lost me at the video clip on the Ferris wheel...
Rosxjun-,fdjr5lx,t1_fdjnvak,"Ha you telling me. I first got into In Flames when Reroute to Remain came out. At the time I thought that was bad ass...until I heard their much earlier albums.

 I think one of the very few songs I like from them within the past 10 years was their collab with Pendulum ""Self vs Self""."
Pjyilthaeykh,fdjutmt,t1_fdjnvak,"I first listened to I, The Mask and thought they were an edgy rock band but people kept talking about OG In Flames and after listening to their first couple of albums I realized I could’ve been a fan if I got to them earlier. Just glad they kept the jester head from Jester Race as a logo so I can still get cool merch."
l0dry,fdjvzs9,t1_fdjnvak,"I really don't get it why so many people hate the newer albums. For me, they indeed are not quite good as the old ones, but they're still fantastic"
TheDracula666,fdjvagk,t1_fdjnvak,I do have a soft spot for Clayman. Definitely has some weird Van Halen vibes on that album
Fl4shbang,fdjy4ag,t1_fdjnvak,"I actually like their last 2 albums. They're not bad, the band just moved to a different style, maybe because Anders can't really scream anymore. That said, I do prefer their first albums too."
MiredInIrony,fdjrw5f,t1_fdjrhrn,"Yeah, I should definitely look at some you recommended as well. Start with the song Beasts of Prey. All their music is pretty trippy if your into that"
alarumba,fdjuxlv,t1_fdjshz0,First I've heard of them outside of my group of friends.
NammyNammy123,fdk42y5,t1_fdjvpu0,Lucky! There's sooo many good Prog metal bands from Australia! Twelve foot ninja is great.
NammyNammy123,fdl2p06,t1_fdkcbjj,"Beyond Creation is a tech death metal band that I'm a big fan of. Black Crown Initiate (specifically their album Song of the Cripple Bull) is also very good. A few more to list off (not specifically related to Ne Obliviscaris): The Faceless, Born of Osiris, Jinjer, Rivers of Nihil, Shadow of Intent, and Slice the Cake's Odyssey of the West is one of my top 5 favourite albums of all time."
bddiddy,fdljzuz,t1_fdkcbjj,"Wilderun

Xanthochroid"
SuburbanPotato,fdjuxbi,t1_fdjr8w6,"The Living Infinite does it for me. A double album that somehow never gets boring, and Spectrum of Eternity is a 10/10 track"
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjsr60,t1_fdjr8w6,"I'd have to say Natural Born Chaos, and Predators Portrait are my favourites. Verkligheten just didn't really do anything for me, even after multiple listens."

KenkerDebiel,fdjsxwu,t1_fdjsvw8,Absolutely! Since late i can count myself as a proud owner of a limited edition vinyl of epitath album!
SuperSalad_OrElse,fe4smh9,t1_fdkzyj2,"It’s a shame how their later albums ended up. They’re still super talented, but it’s not the sound I prefer.

Soundtrack to Your Escape was when I was skeptical but it had great riffs and good choruses."
Firestar488,fdju0ki,t1_fdjtg5a,"In just about every episode, the band plays sort of stripped down versions of actual Dethklok songs. They sound almost like song demos at the time. And also, if you're not a huge fan of the voice but love the instrumentation, I would recommend checking out Brendon Small's Galaktikon. It's the same guy that writes the guitar and vocal parts for Dethklok."
mattymufc,fdjoqql,t1_fdjn2vr,Thanks
4e696b,fdjt5tg,t1_fdjodgo,"They're doom metal, though."
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjxrlk,t1_fdjxn8y,"Fucking brilliant way of putting it, haha. At The Gates were the opposite, made a masterpiece, disappeared, then returned with a banger."
Covetouscraven,fdjvpsn,t1_fdjo45o,Can't remember the name of that song but that was definitely the tipping point for me as well.
Gorperino,fdjsd83,t1_fdjr5lx,There need to be more metal and drum and bass collabs. The drums go hard.
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjv0hw,t1_fdjutmt,Is old school melodic death not your thing? Or is it more what they turned into has turned you off them?
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjwh09,t1_fdjvzs9,"Alot of what I see is because of the reason why they changed. They altered their sound to appeal to more people, it was a business decision (this is their job, I get understand it), Bodom did the same thing then went back to making more technical albums. I purely don't like the new albums because they just don't do anything for me, I find them a bit boring, especially compared to the uniqueness of they're older material."
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjvcr7,t1_fdjvagk,"Mate, I love Clayman it's an amazing album. Even Reroute and Come Clarity have a couple of songs I like each."
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjv2kc,t1_fdjuxlv,Swamplord and The Black Waltz 10/10 albums
SexyWhitedemoman,fdl445s,t1_fdl2p06,"Thanks! I've listened to a little Beyond Creation and Born of Osiris but never dived deep into their discography, and the rest are new to me. Looks like I'm gonna be busy when I get home."
Xx_gaystuntman_xX,fdmsijt,t1_fdjuxbi,"There are so many bangers on The Living Infinite, I just play the album through."

savage_engineer,fdjx1dr,t1_fdju0ki,"Be sure to also check out Home Movies. Not metal, but love me some Brendon Small."
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjut0n,t1_fdjt5tg,"Ehhh, they started as Doom. I'd say they're more Gothic metal these days."
AWanderersStar,fdjw2gc,t1_fdjvpsn,Deliver Us. I like that song a lot :/
Pjyilthaeykh,fdjv2gs,t1_fdjv0hw,"What they turned into, I love their old albums. I was saying that now I can’t really get into them because if I look for merch or go to live shows it’s gonna be all about their new stuff that I don’t like"
Trashcyon,fdk0eem,t1_fdjwh09,Some would say they had to...reroute to remain.
alarumba,fdjvy0z,t1_fdjv2kc,"Well aware. Amazing to think how old those albums are now.

Taken your comment for recommendations on Spotify. Big fan of Bodom, Soilwork, DT (have a tattoo of artwork from the Iridium video) and old In Flames but hadn't heard of or got into the rest.

I always get this bittersweet feeling getting into bands that have been around for years. Feel like I've missed out not catching them sooner, but glad to know them now. It was harder back then with Limewire and dial up to get albums though.

If you haven't heard of them already, Disarmonia Mundi are damned good. Same singer from Soilwork."
AWanderersStar,fdjx4g1,t1_fdjv2kc,"There’s a band called Dreamlord that only has one release, an EP titled “Eternal Night” released last year. It really has the style of Kalmah/Bodom. I’m mentioning it because they have like a non-existent following and I would like to show them to more people. It is just as good as any MDM release of 2019"
Covetouscraven,fdjw4jb,t1_fdjw2gc,"Each to their own m'dude, keep listening to it."
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjv56v,t1_fdjv2gs,"Ahhh, yeah. They're playing Download festival soon here in Melbourne. I don't even know if I'll bother seeing them based on the latest setlist."
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjw77k,t1_fdjvy0z,"Love that idea for a tattoo. Haha, fuck Limewire, those were the days.

Well, better late than never to get into any band :) glad to have helped someone find new bands. I'll give Dosarmonka Mundi a look, big fan of Speeds vocals."
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjxaw0,t1_fdjx4g1,"Fuck yeah, just put them into my Spotify. Will give them a listen and keep my eye on them and show it around."
Shotty98,fdjleqr,t3_elpm6f,Death is the best band
firesharknado,fdk1f84,t1_fdjleqr,RIP chuck
help_me_im_in_pain,fdjxq24,t1_fdjleqr,They're such a solid band
atrocity_exhlbition,fdk30i1,t1_fdjleqr,The Sound of Perseverance is perfection.
myvirginityisstrong,fdjua1u,t1_fdjleqr,"yes, the best melodic death metal band!"
Cosmic_Cretin,fdk9nnn,t1_fdjleqr,I dont listen to them as often as I should anymore but I will say their record 'Human (1991)' might just be the best death metal album ever recorded.
NotAzakanAtAll,fdko62x,t1_fdjleqr,"> Death

Oh man I remember first time I heard them. I was in the army library for the first time, saw a row of head phones. I asked the librarian what kind of music they had - I was given a log with all the different choices. There was ONE band under death metal. So naturally I picked that one. 

Listened to all of it. Good times, until it wasn't."
Vagabond_Crambus,fdk653z,t1_fdk30i1,"Symbolic is still a top 10 album for me, even as I don't listen to much metal nowadays"
-totallynotanalien-,fdjlx5a,t3_elpm6f,"It’s like me and power metal, sometimes my dog thinks the singers are trying to communicate with her. High screams intrigue her haha"

i-came-for-the-memes,fdjyve5,t1_fdjxswz,Blind guardian is good to
Lbohnrn,fdjzxn3,t1_fdjyve5,I still wish they’d revive Demons and Wizards.
JFAD1494,fdjjq39,t3_elpm6f,They're not 'death' but Ghost are a good melodic metal band
shady_traveller,fdjm670,t1_fdjjq39,"Thanks for the recommendation, I'm really enjoying this band!"
Zepren7,fdjojvn,t1_fdjjq39,Second I read this meme I thought about Ghost
Mistress_Stephanie,fdjrgif,t1_fdjjq39,"They are also a great band to see live, I’ve been to a few shows and was at the final one of their latest tour and they were so good, great crowd. I highly recommend when they go on tour again!"
DirtyFuzeMain,fdjol4i,t1_fdjjq39,In times of turmoil
Fl4shbang,fdjyad1,t1_fdjjq39,Ghost are amazing.
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjn9hg,t1_fdjjq39,Ghost are rock.
SvenQ,fdjovtf,t1_fdjjq39,"Damn, thank you for that!"
poupon_macaque,fdjpld1,t1_fdjjq39,Since we're throwing out bands here Scar Symmetry is a Swedish melodic death metal band that got me into heavy music altogether. The Swedes have a knack for this stuff.
derdestroyer2004,fdjs1jt,t1_fdjjq39,They aren’t considered metal by alot of people too
Zephid15,fdjxm2l,t1_fdjjq39,Up through their third album. Then they took a nose dive.
MsYeet_chan,fdjntdg,t1_fdjm670,"Check out Being As An Ocean. They are melodic hardcore, you might like them"
lordfreakingpenguins,fdjq8zg,t1_fdjm670,"Trivium's last few albums have shifted to more melodic music, also not deathcore."
Lubcke,fdjsei5,t1_fdjm670,Also very entertaining to experience live.

MythicalRadiator,fdjncsw,t1_fdjn9hg,"Ghost is whatever people want it to be. Music is subjective, genre doesn't really matter any more. No point in arguing over minute details that really don't matter at all, it doesn't change the music does it? No it doesn't. You'll still hear the same music."
I_Am_Indifferent,fdjq9b3,t1_fdjn9hg,Are you on about the Japanese band?
Pyro_Cryo,fdjw0vg,t1_fdjn9hg,Still sound good tho
SpiderMax95,fdjq31v,t1_fdjntdg,"Sadly, their sound has changed quite substantially since their third album... I still listen to the old stuff regularly, but the latest album is a whole other genre.

""Waiting for morning"" has a few banger tracks though."
acethetix,fdk0lch,t1_fdjntdg,I hung out with them for the entire night at a tiny bar down the street from my apartment in college back in like 2012. They had been together for four months and were across the country from their hometown already. Nicest dudes ever and as someone who played in my own metalcore band at the time these dudes obviously just completely blew my mind. Awesome experience. They liked a couple of my IG posts the next day and to this day they’re one out of the like two likes on those posts 😂 which I think is cool lol
Paradox2063,fdjqvgg,t1_fdjpz5r,"I think that's my favorite song of theirs. Hard to pick though.

Maybe Witch Image."
hieronymus_bossk7,fdjoaba,t1_fdjncsw,Genre actually does matter when you're trying to describe what a bands music sounds like to someone. It's ironic that the thread that you're replying to exemplifies why you're wrong.
New-Aeon-Chaos,fdjneea,t1_fdjncsw,"I only said that because I thought I remembered reading that the frontman said they're more rock, and not metal."
LordApocalyptica,fdjox4s,t1_fdjncsw,"Very much disagree.

Being able to delineate different genres is largely what helps us *make more genres*. It also helps us find sounds that are less popular. 

“Genre” doesn’t really matter anymore in its concrete sense, but the modern use as adjectives is immensely helpful. I sure as fuck don’t know what “Psychedelic Singer-Songwriter Sludge” sounds like, but damn now if I don’t wanna find it or make it myself. There are so many bands innovating today because we’ve embraced the power of both flexibility and delineation in genre descriptors. And being able to promote that innovation and flexibility starts at creating a baseline frame of reference like distinguishing between “Rock” and “Metal”

No, genre labels don’t change what I’m hearing. But they sure as hell help me find more of *what I want to hear or haven’t heard*. The only time genre is a problem is when people are diminutive dicks about it.

**EDIT:** Damn, this really got my gears turning in the morning. Anyway, expanding a bit in case it flies over anyone’s heads.

Delineation and description, even outside of genre, is pretty much *never* a bad thing. It’s in fact what allows us to learn *more* about these things. Problems from delineation only arise when people are dicks. For example: racism. Recognizing differences in ancestral genetics is actually *super* helpful for diagnosing disease. It has also helped with a lot of anthropological study and cultural exhibition. It only becomes a problem when *people are dicks about it.* The problem has never been the delineation itself; its the people using it (and meta-cognitively: the people putting down those who delineate) to put others down. Those are the people using it to boost their own egos.

Wrapping back to the genre discussion for concretion: diminution of someone for delineating is just as malicious as diminution of a genre. Guys, yes, rock and metal are different... **AND THAT’S OK**. Use that as a platform to discuss what elements of a band are rock and what elements are metal and how the band blurs the line. Its super fun when you get the ego part of genre discussion put of the way and focus on the identification, intermingling, and “adjective-izing”.

Blame the dicks, not the differences. Recognize differences and allow them to enrich you and others. Celebrate being able to recognize new things and that things can be different. It makes things pretty wild as long as you aren’t mean."

sc00t83,fdjqx5x,t1_fdjqvgg,I can't choose between 'he is' and 'square hammer'
Fl4shbang,fdjybw1,t1_fdjqvgg,I like that song's lyrics so much
GranularGray,fdjq4cf,t1_fdjoaba,"If you're trying to give a general idea of what kind of music a band makes, for sure naming a genre they fit in definitely helps. However recently it's been more and more rare for a band to just stick in the genre that they are known for. 

A fantastic example would be someone like Devin Townsend. In general he's known for making rock and metal music, but if you look through his quite expansive discography he's written songs in any genre you could name from country to blues to hardcore, just to name a few. Now it seems like he's mostly sticking to progressive rock/metal, but he throws in some weird stuff pretty frequently."
ghoulishtendency,fdjr9wi,t1_fdjneea,"I've also heard people describe them as doom metal, because of the subject matter they sing about rather than sound. So. Theres that.

Personally, I think people throw them in with metal more because of their lyrics rather than sound. They definitely have more of a rock sound, but their lyrics are much darker and, ya know, satanic, than a lot of other rock bands. 

I dunno. I think they're awesome regardless of genre. Saw them at festivals twice last summer, and they were great! Would recommend if ya get the chance."
daughterofpolonius,fdjr173,t1_fdjox4s,They’re genre fluid
hieronymus_bossk7,fdjs0d4,t1_fdjq4cf,Nobody said you have to label a band as a single genre. The way you described Devin Townsend music using genre labels is actually great. Notice how you wouldn't have been able to describe how his music has changed without genres? You keep unintentionally disproving your own point.
DoD_DusK,fdjzt7r,t1_fdjr9wi,"I do think you can hear elements of doom metal in ghost (other then the lyrics). I don't agree that they are doom metal, but if compared to something like Candlemass and Cirith Ungol I don't think its unfair to try to group them or at least some of their songs in the same genre. 

Rock is the one word answer to what they are, but they are a lot of things. I mean the verse of Dance Macabre is a vocal change away from being ABBA: https://youtu.be/OPIfO-R5Yic?t=32

But yeah, they are awsome regardless. Sadly I keep missing their gigs when they come to Finland :/"

Piggynosepitbull,fdjn6c7,t1_fdjjnr5,Most people who work at shelters like the animals more than people. Just ask someone working there how to get started and I’m sure they’d be happy to show you some of their favorite pups.

You'd be doing them a favor, rather them going out of their way to help you."
Sauceror,fdjtjrp,t1_fdjjnr5,"You could also try something like an organization that has foster homes for animals that need new owners. It's more private and might be easier. I got my first act through something like that and my mum has since gotten another one and they take great effort in helping you start off right.

Doesn't matter where you go to in the end, if it's a good resource. You could even just tell them that you are shy about it and they probably would understand. I assure you, loads of dog and cat people are just as weird and awkward as you and I. ;)"
axel310,fdjt2t1,t1_fdjjnr5,Same here friend. My issue is I want to take good care of a dog and not sure how to manage it with a full time job. Don’t like the idea of leaving a dog alone for like 9-10 hours a day

KneeDeepInTheDead,fdk2pe5,t1_fdjlf7c,"you gotta be more specific, if you listen to Scream Bloody Gore its not really melodic"
loseitplz,fdjog6x,t1_fdjj5xr,"Hate being a terrible metal niche hipster but... Melodic Death Metal has nothing to do with clean vocals. The genre seperates itself by having more melodic guitar lines. Most of the originators of the genre do not have clean vocals. At the Gates' 1996 'Slaughter of the Soul' is the quintessential album imo. The modern interpretation on albums by The Black Dahlia Murder is also stellar, start with 'Miasma'."
AuthoritahFigure,fdjogtq,t1_fdjj5xr,Melodeath is mostly screaming though
Kiri-SuteGomen,fdk1vp1,t1_fdjj5xr,I felt that way for a long time but eventually reached a point where 90 percent of melodeath started to sound too melodic and cheesy sounding to me. Now I primarily listen to death/black metal.
60_Icebolt,fdjxjcd,t1_fdjnu2k,"I might be in a minority here, but I gotta say my favorite Arch Enemy albums, at least from a compositional standpoint, are their first three. The original singer’s vocals are not fantastic, especially on their first album. But by the second album, and most particularly the third, he had cleaned up his act a decent bit and sounded pretty good. Not sure how much of a shot you’ve given Burning Bridges, but I highly recommend it. Stigmata also has a lot of fun songs"

callMeDirtyDan,fdjtogw,t1_fdjpbsp,There's an old school (70s) punk band named Death that isn't to be forgotten

loseitplz,fdjpi3q,t1_fdjpdpq,"They actively acknowledge At the Gates as their main inspiration. They're at least half of both : ) They get thrown in with Deathcore because of the breakdowns / mosh and the fact that their popularity rose at the time Deathcore was the hot new thing in metal land. But in metal and hardcore genre discussions, no one ever wins ; )"
Kiri-SuteGomen,fdk1n0e,t1_fdjpdpq,I love TBDM but I honestly have no idea why they are sometimes called Deathcore. I don't hear it at all. They do tour with a lot of core bands so maybe that's how they got that association.
Shotty98,fdjuch2,t1_fdjtogw,I had absolutely no idea I will definitely check them out!
demonik187,fdjqzvx,t1_fdjpdm9,Thanks I'll check it out!
HMJ87,fdjppw3,t1_fdjpi3q,"That's a fair point lol although one thing I would say is inspiration doesn't mean they emulate their style or fit in the same genre - that's how music grows and evolves, inspiration is taken from one area and then adapted and changed to create a new style :) I admit I'm an old fart when it comes to -core stuff though, I never understood the popularity myself (each to their own though of course!)"
KneeDeepInTheDead,fdk2o06,t1_fdjuch2,theyre really good too

loseitplz,fdjpy5z,t1_fdjppw3,"Yeah true, that's why I carefully called it a modern interpretation. It's closer to At the Gates than Job for a Cowboy imo. Old farting right back at ya. It's the reason for when I see melodic deathmeta named with bands that do something quite different, old man me has to chase the metal kids of his lawn.

Al thought it was played on a 14"" CRT monitor and dad saw it from other side of the room so with that definition it might as well have looked like a real match on a glance :)"
Theygonnabanme,fe9gwpb,t1_fe8kv6f,"He knew, but just wanted to feel the same connection as when you were little and he was explaining things to you."
NorthernLaw,fea8gr4,t1_fe8kv6f,I wish my dad would do that instead of getting to the brink of breaking down about how technology has ruined everything.
Lamplord72,fea5h9h,t1_fe8kv6f,I had a similar experience with my dad actually! I was playing rouge squadron on the gamecube and my dad was FASCINATED by how good the cloud city level looked. To the point of inviting the neighbors inside and showing them lol my dad is a pretty cool guy :)
Kr33mCh33z,fea72qs,t1_fe8kv6f,"My first cod was COD Ghosts (I know it’s a bad game but it was my first Xbox game), anyways, my dad saw it and he was like wow! Look at these graphics. Now I’ve introduced him to pc vr. I showed him doom vr and he showed me the original doom, and it was just a wholesome experience."
420blazeit69nubz,fe8v75u,t1_fe8uj5z,My dad would do the same haha We’re big Boston Bruins fans so I’d be playing and he’d come down like wtf I didn’t know there was even a game on! I’d let him sit then like you said about 10 minutes in he’s like wait a second...
Stew-Pitt,fe96yro,t1_fe8uj5z,Fifa 13 the best fifa ever!
Brian_M,fe97o4n,t1_fe8wbts,"I remember in the SEGA FIFA games you could get the referee to chase you around the field, if you ran away from them when they tried to give you a red or yellow card. That would have been quite the stunt to pull in front of someone who thought they were watching a real game."

I have an older dog (10 years) who's full of puppy energy. He trusts us and all that, but also has bouts of whining and nervousness. He's been with us a year, and we plan on keeping him until either he or we die, but I'm never certain if he's ever comfortable and happy that he's found owners that love him."
sentientdumpsterbaby,fdsli7d,t1_fdskx6g,I’ve had sunny for about two years and I had to leave him at a border a few weeks ago for a vacation. Sunny lost it bc it reminded him of the shelter and when he saw me again he was so happy. I think they’ll always have that worry in the back of their minds but feel the most secure when they’re with you.
cultmember2000,fdspeog,t1_fdsli7d,Awwww!  That’s why I always let my friends leave their pups with me when they’re out of town.  Our dogs can play together and have sleepovers instead of worrying that they’re being left at the pound again.

mythrowaway_account1,fdsuhmt,t1_fdslsnx,😳. Oh no. Be careful. I would be crying and running all day looking. Oh man. I’m sure u didn’t mean for it to happen though. My cat is the same. Runs out into the hall. He’s also escaped out the window cuz it’s a shitty ancient window. Are there treats that might make him run back?
sentientdumpsterbaby,fdsumn6,t1_fdsuhmt,He’s a free spirit that gets caught in the moment. He loves to run and just runs too far. I usually use a toy to lure him back because food doesn’t work when he’s so excited
mythrowaway_account1,fdzoe7q,t1_fdsumn6,"Oh ok that’s good. Thank gawd. Haha he sounds so adorable lol. 😄
I ended up moving due to my window issue. I occasionally have nightmares about him escaping lol.

sentientdumpsterbaby,fdzraq6,t1_fdzoe7q,South Georgia is like Satan’s anus. It’s humid and sticky and I would not recommend lol. I would suggest the mountains. I live in more of a swampy area but I’ve visited mountainous regions and those are much better.

Here’s a song for him  https://genius.com/Bobby-hebb-sunny-lyrics"
sentientdumpsterbaby,fdsiob5,t1_fdsiakm,Omg I love it! I know this is dark but when he passed this will help me remember him.
Typhron,fdsy5p1,t1_fdsiakm,"Not the OP, but thank for this."
dogsledonice,fdsksfs,t3_emxf5l,"Hi Sunny! Our dog's called Sunny too, she's a black lab mix!"
sentientdumpsterbaby,fdslahv,t1_fdsksfs,My Sunny is a lab/golden retriever mix!
StGeorgeAlone,fdsubse,t3_emxf5l,I see Sunny also has a roku
some0ne3lse,fdt7qb0,t3_emxf5l,I'm pretty sure this was the same emotional journey my husband went through...
Hooknight,fdsfjrk,t3_emxf5l,"kinda worries me about sunny that he thought the his new home was temporary

like if he thinks that, its probably happened many times before"
sentientdumpsterbaby,fdsgykh,t1_fdsfjrk,"Well, after I adopted him, I posted a picture of him in a local pet group asking for advice about his chicken allergy, and a woman messaged me “hey that’s my dog” and I was like ???? Bitch wtf I adopted him he’s mine but sure enough she had pics and his name used to be Marley until he ran away with his brother. His brother was never found but sunny was collected by a shelter and passed around by many shelters for months until I adopted him. He had a puppy who died in this woman’s care as well. He also has bird pellet in him from being shot at as a stray, so basically small bullets throughout his body. There’s on right between his eyes. She asked to see him sometime and I said I guess but it never happened and at this point I don’t want her to see him."
JuliaOphelia,fdshbcr,t1_fdsgykh,You're an angel for saving him.
bathandredwine,fdsi85f,t1_fdsgykh,All I need is five minutes alone with the person who shot him.
Reallyhotshowers,fdsm9zj,t1_fdsgykh,"So this woman didn't bother to get her dog chipped, let at least one puppy you know of die, had enclosures that allowed two dogs to run away, didn't check the shelters to see if her dog showed up, and then requested a visit she never followed through on?

Definitely don't let her see Sunny if she hits you up again. It'll probably just be confusing/distressing for Sunny for her to show up just to disappear again, especially with his separation anxiety. 

He's very lucky to have found you. :)"
trsrz,fdsij8h,t1_fdsgykh,"if you got any tips on the chicken allergy can you share them please? 😊

PS I love Sunny and fuck that lady"
RossTheChihuahua,fdsi0uz,t1_fdsgykh,"Oh, that poor baby!

Thank you for saving him"
Kalappianer,fdxrdem,t1_fdsgykh,"Does he have corn allergy, too?"
sentientdumpsterbaby,fdshrox,t1_fdshbcr,"Thanks, but so is everyone else who adopts! Sunny was adopted to serve as my ESA as I suffered with pretty bad depression when I began college and he has helped tremendously. On the downside, he is obsessed with me and his separation anxiety is so bad he’ll throw up if I’m gone too long, so I’m his emotional support human lol."
sentientdumpsterbaby,fdsiitx,t1_fdsi85f,"Oh dude like a month after I got him we were lying in bed and there had always been this black dot on his arm. I asked the vet about it and they were like “it’s a blackhead” so I left it alone. Well, we’re lying in bed and I run my finger over it and POP a bb pops out and there’s a hole in his arm. He has about five more I’ve been able to find, but they’re too deep to ever pop out."
sentientdumpsterbaby,fdsmuug,t1_fdsm9zj,Thank you!
sentientdumpsterbaby,fdsj1t2,t1_fdsij8h,"Goodness chicken allergies are the worst and now I feel like an expert. Basically, if your dog is allergic to chicken, they’re more likely to be allergic to beef & pork as well. So, better alternatives are rabbit, venison, or fish. Make sure to check the ingredients because a lot use chicken fat to bind ingredients even when they say chicken free. Dogs are least likely to be allergic to fish, idk why. After trying the cheapest brands and the most expensive, Sunny has done the best (i.e. no diarrhea, no hair loss, no vomiting) on this food: https://www.chewy.com/gentle-giants-canine-nutrition-salmon/dp/133791"
sentientdumpsterbaby,fdypdcg,t1_fdxrdem,"When I cut the chicken, I also cut the corn. But, I know he’s allergic to chicken bc every time he sneaks some, he gets violently ill. The last time he ended up in the vet with dehydration."
JuliaOphelia,fdsn16s,t1_fdshrox,Hugss to both of you! You and Sunny are meant for each other 🥰
bathandredwine,fdth94u,t1_fdsiitx,Give him a hug RIGHT NOW from me.
bathandredwine,fdth30v,t1_fdsiitx,Oh my God I would kill that person. I’m not exaggerating. Who would do this? I hate humans just surround me with dogs.
Kalappianer,fdyqmv3,t1_fdypdcg,"Ok. My all three dogs are allergic to corn (breed group characteristic) and for some reason, they also react to cornfed chickens. One of them had bowel issues, so she had to eat rice and chicken, but she kept reacting to the chicken. I had bought cornfed chicken."
sentientdumpsterbaby,fdtj8cn,t1_fdth94u,Will do! We’re in bed getting ready to sleep! He’s curled at my feet.
sentientdumpsterbaby,fdtj5hj,t1_fdth30v,I’m from the south so it’s not uncommon for people to shoot at dogs. He was probably digging in someone’s trash for food and they shot bird pellets at his feet to scare him and they ricocheted up.
sentientdumpsterbaby,fdzasi2,t1_fdyqmv3,Maybe go chicken-free? The food I linked is awesome and if I feed my dog around any other dogs the nearby dogs go crazy wanting it bc it smells so good to them. It’s mainly made of veggies and fruits.
bathandredwine,fdtmbte,t1_fdtj5hj,Shooting at dogs? This is just not normal AT ALL. What the hell is going on down there?
Kalappianer,fdzb03t,t1_fdzasi2,It's been years without chicken.
sentientdumpsterbaby,fdtmscz,t1_fdtmbte,"I don’t agree with it, but some people shoot dogs that wander onto their property, especially their farms. I lost a couple of dogs that way when I was growing up."
phtevenofthesea,fdskatg,t3_emxf5l,Man I have a Stevie who is basically Sunny in girl-hound-mutt form!!

AndreaDTX,fdtjq2h,t3_en1obl,Those boys had better skeedadle which is an even faster way to hightail it.
LickToesAndSlayHoes,fdtrsqp,t1_fdtjq2h,"Or they could go one further and scram, the fastest possible way to skeedadle."
ultranoodles,fdu1bzr,t1_fdtjq2h,"I would say that skedaddle is more of a sprint and hide, whereas a hightail is more of a long distance, high speed, endeavor."

Cael87,fduf6il,t1_fdtjq2h,"A skeedadle and hightail are about the same in terms of urgency, scram on the other hand is a panicked fleeing for ones own safety.

chickenfoot4less,fdu5vfs,t1_fdtjq2h,Skee-fucking-daddle
DoTheEvolution,fdveee4,t1_fdtjq2h,"skeedadle is definitely not faster, you just felt like saying something"
KingdomCrown,fdtw750,t1_fdtrsqp,Both skeedadle and scram imply that one was engaging in devious shenanigans prior. In a classic skedaddle the miscreants will flee the scene (likely before being discovered). Scram conveys a sense of urgency as in most cases they’ve already been discovered and are being chased by mall security.
JeeceRones,fdtt6d4,t1_fdtrsqp,"Skeedadling is the pinnacle of the R.U.N.N.O.F.T. system, you obviously haven’t studied the pertinent literature."

AndreaDTX,fdwlns0,t1_fdtw750,Skeedaddle makes me think of that Tom and Jerry noise implying urgency but no true threat. Scram makes me think of a group of kids who’ve just done something they shouldn’t have who now feel a threat is imminent.

FitHippieCanada,fdzu5m2,t1_fdztcpa,"Hey now, the emotional pain and distress experienced by the person with dementia and that suffered by friends, family and loved ones watching their cognitive decline is not trivial.

Just because you don’t understand it, or don’t see it that way, doesn’t mean that you should be condescending to those that feel differently.

There’s room for everyone’s feelings here.

Edit: source: I was a primary caregiver for my grandmother during her cognitive decline with Alzheimer’s. I watched the woman who helped raise me devolve into an old woman, inflicted with the terrors of the only memories she had left - her childhood in Amsterdam during WWII. Not knowing where her parents were, and being terrified for her life constantly. Thinking everything she ate was dressed up tulip bulbs or eel.

That was an incredibly painful experience for everyone involved. There is no pain medication for that."
Lupin_AAGL,fdzvugo,t1_fdztcpa,"I have acid reflux which causes esophagus pains that I've heard be compared to a heart attack. I can't breathe properly, can't speak and all I want is to kill myself to stop the pain when in the middle of a crisis, which can last from 1 to 3 hours. It feels like my internal organs are being crushed by my own skeleton.



I would live through the pain everyday if that's what it took to be able to recognize the people I love and keep control of my own mind."
FitHippieCanada,fdzvr3j,t1_fdztcpa,"Well you deleted the comment I was replying to, so I’m going to go ahead and reply again here.

You said something along the lines of:
“You know what shouldn’t be trivialized? Real actual pain.”

Here’s my reply:

I’m not trivializing anyone else’s pain with my comment. I was simply trying to explain how emotional pain is real, too.

My father lived in excruciating pain during the last couple months of his life, as dozens of cancerous metastases literally took over his body. I would not trivialize that.

I have given birth. Which is incredibly painful. I would not trivialize that, either.

Physical pain and emotional pain are both real. Nobody’s experience of pain should be trivialized."

Yidam,fe0d6ft,t1_fe08xie,">I do not agree. I much rather take pain and death over losing the memory of everything

Why? If you lose your memory your are no longer you, and if you are no longer you, you have nothing to worry about. It might be tougher on your caretakers, but you do not suffer. On the other hand dying in agony is agonizing, having your wits about you doesn't make it any better, worse in fact, having caretakers do not ease the acute pain of suffering either, you remember them but you dont want to see them or talk to them depending on the severity of pain involved, it will consume all your mind and your soul, but hey, you're still you!"

aangnesiac,fe0ygfg,t1_fe0d6ft,"I hope you come out of this realizing why people are down-voting and arguing with you. You seem like the type of person to draw a line and assume that anyone who disagrees with you is on the other side of it, though. In this case, I have a feeling that you will come away from this thinking that many of the people here don't think cancer is that severe or that they have no idea how bad it is. But that's not necessary for people to not agree with you here. You've positioned yourself against dementia and Alzheimer's being severe which is what people are truly responding to. 

Memory loss is incredibly difficult for everyone involved--certainly the person suffering from it. For starters, they typically have many other ailments and pains simply due to old age, but they often have no idea why. They often can't remember their family members and what little they do remember is never accurate. I've seen people who forgot their child had already passed, so effectively they were constantly losing their child. It was hell for them and their loved ones. 

It's not a matter of cancer being awesome or something. It's that you are downplaying the severity of diseases that are truly devastating."

zephyrsong888,fdzumqx,t1_fdztykm,"Being frank with you, you sound like a bit of a jerk in this thread. Disabilities aren't ""sucking with directions"", they're physical problems inside of the brain.  You probably don't joke about dyslexia being about ""bad reading"", you joke about getting things backwards. That's at least an honest association with the problem. 

Discalcula messes with all spatial reasoning and often includes signs of dyslexia as well (though not always). There are tests for it, and it's quite difficult to live with, getting lost on your way to work and not being *able* to hit the store on your way home, rather *needing* to go home first so you can go to the store without getting lost."
MaybeImTheNanny,fdzv1e0,t1_fdzuv5m,Oh I know it can but those are accommodations that are considered reasonable for the disability. “Applying for disability” generally means applying for SSDI or SSI which are programs that are only available to those who are disabled to the point that they are unable to work for income.

MaddieRuin,fdi9hjf,t1_fdi1w97,“When my dog’s friend comes over” is the cutest sentence. It’s like the dog’s owners have coffee with you and they’re only there for the pups’ play date.
frogsgoribbit737,fdinyku,t1_fdi1w97,"I have two dogs. We got the second because we wanted another but also because we thought they could play with each other. Nope. They either both want to play with us or they want us to stand in the middle while they play with each other.

Zephyr was taken so I changed the spelling slightly. When I decided to get a puppy, for some reason the name popped back into my head and I thought it sounded good for a female shepherd.

PM-ME-YOUR-1ST-BORN,fdi78qx,t3_elfwsd,"A huge part of the reason why I got my second dog was so that my first dog would be more entertained/less lonely - they could play with each other when I'm gone, he'd have a friend all the time!  
  
But nope. This comic shows the reality. When I'm gone, they BOTH sleep. When I'm there, they each come bring me a toy and stare me down until I play with both of them, simultaneously. If I stop, they don't continue playing with each other, they just stare at me like ""oh, we're done?"" Dorks."
pugmom1967,fdivo86,t1_fdi78qx,"But I love love love those dorks! Humans don’t deserve dogs, IMO. My two pug boys are such a joy to me...don’t remember life without them! The cartoon is spot on ..."
ElmosBigRedSchlong,fdj0uh8,t1_fdi78qx,Samsies. First dog is super energetic and playful. Thought the second guy would help. But he's a lazy boy and prefers to just do his own thing. Oh and he also doesn't understand play. So I throw the ball to first dog and second dog bullies the ball and won't bring it back. Now I have two dogs and no one to play fetch with.

CosmicAbundances,fdv2sy7,t3_en5l8o,"I actually do play video games. I posted this meme because he’ll play as I’m getting ready for bed and I’m watching him play MW  and he’s killing it but I’m
cold and need his warmth to go to bed


EDIT: I’m a girl lmao. And my boyfriend and I work late so when we come home, we immediately play video games to destress from our service job. He likes to play until super late and I’m falling asleep by three am. If I’m up playing games he’ll kiss my forehead in between rounds or we’re on PS4 voice chat just enjoying our dumb sighs and “FUCK YEAHS”. He loves me very much and he’s not prioritizing games over me, rather I love watching him do the thing he introduced me to (that I extremely love) and I understand that that’s his free time and he’ll come to bed eventually.

Edit 2: holy shit this blew up!! Thank you!!! I hope all my fellow gamers find love out there! I battled with depression most of my life and didn’t think I would make it to 22. I struggled but kept moving forward and right out of high school I met the one. It gets better and the one for you is out there. If y’all ever need a friend to talk to my inbox is open.

Edit 3: I didn’t think I’d have to say this but obviously this is a joke and I’m not actually getting mad at my boyfriend for playing video games instead of cuddling me. Sometimes the roles are reversed and he wants to cuddle and watch Netflix while I’m playing rainbow 6. We just joke about being needy for affection even though we literally spend almost every waking moment together. We’re each other’s best friend. Stop saying rude stuff about my relationship on a wholesome subreddit. That’s wack af."

lydocia,fdvzlhr,t1_fdvzd5n,"I just disagree. It's uncomfortable to me and I just feel you can game first, cuddle later (or the other way around). No need to half-ass both things just to do them at the same time if you can whole-ass them in sequence."
motivatingguineapig,fdw27mt,t1_fdvy7c4,"Before my hubby’s heart attack, he’d sit on the couch and I’d sit on the floor between his legs and he’d rub my shoulders when he wasn’t actively playing. But this was when I was in my early twenties and could get up off the floor without needing a crane and a first aid kit. 

He and his dad also hooked me up with WOW because their guild needed a healer, as tradition dictates. TBH, I was planning on playing anyway, but when I expressed interest and said I was gonna save up for a computer, they got all excited and my FIL gave me his old one and they bought me the game and expansions for Christmas. This was...Lich I think. I feel old. Literally stopped using my Northrend map mouse pad last month, it finally wore out."
De_Rossi_But_Juve,fdw2nsv,t1_fdvy7c4,"So you can cuddle.

I'd sit on the floor if my so thinks it's a problem."
lydocia,fdw2cpz,t1_fdw27mt,"> But this was when I was in my early twenties and could get up off the floor without needing a crane and a first aid kit.

Before I say ""ugh I feel that sister"", I'm going to ask how old you are now and hope it's older than 30."
lydocia,fdw2t1z,t1_fdw2nsv,"Like I said in another comment, I just feel you can game first, cuddle later (or the other way around). 

No need to half-ass both things just to do them at the same time if you can whole-ass them in sequence."
motivatingguineapig,fdw4uuf,t1_fdw2cpz,"Lol I’m 32. Feel older though, I worked in a very physical profession and fucked myself up."
De_Rossi_But_Juve,fdwuyys,t1_fdw2t1z,Depends how hardcore you game. If it's just chill gaming then you don't need to tryhard and can just half cuddle and chill game.
lydocia,fdw9xek,t1_fdw4uuf,"Ah, I don't feel so bad being 30 and barely being able to get up without killing my back, then! Mine's just a fucked up back I was born with, though, not one I earned through physical labour."
lydocia,fdxdunu,t1_fdwuyys,I don't know why I have to keep defending my personal opinion here though :P
Indecisive-Penguin,fdvlkin,t3_en5l8o,"I'm not going to lie. This is 100% me. I want the cuddles, but I love backseat gaming and watching his gaming face.

He plays many games and one of my favorite moments is when he let me play Overwatch with his gaming friends on COMP!

(I did not do great, but I had fun and learned I can play Winston!!)

I lost him points but he said it's okay and then won all the points back and then some.

His online friends have basically adopted me and enjoy trying to teach me.

Right now he is playing Monster Hunter. It's a very interesting.

He really is the best!!!! 😊

Update: boyfriend taught me how to do updates!!!

Thanks for all the likes😊

Update two: 

I did not think this would explode!!! You all are so kind, and my boyfriend said I can run around Monster Hunter!!

This is the first time a comment of mine has ever gotten this much attention!

You all have definitely made my morning.

(My boyfriend is definitely loving my reaction to all of this)"

motivatingguineapig,fdw2wcd,t1_fdvx90v,"Big hugs, sweetie. Took my husband 43 years to find someone and he had fully given up by the time we met. He had decided that he was going to focus on friendships because his wheelchair, as far as he was concerned, ruined any chance of romance. But it worked out in the end! He struck up a conversation with me because of a video game shirt I was wearing, then we ran into each other at the comic book store several times, and it just went from there. It can be super rough, and I’m sorry that you’re discouraged. I’m rooting for you!"

Then I pretended to shank him with a steel DPN but misjudged and actually mildly stabbed him in the forearm. He admitted that he deserved it and from then on would pay attention and if he noticed me trying to count he’d pause the movie without even being asked.

Now we make googly eyes at each other, hold hands, and kiss across the desk between rounds/missions. He's my tank/DPS, I'm his healer.  I have horrible social anxiety, so he makes my call outs.  I found that while sniping was originally (Destiny) my play style, mid range (OW-Lucio) is what I'm best at. 

Word of advice for the gamers in relationships: when your non-gamer significant other goes to bed, go with them. If your significant other is willing to try, move mountains so they can game with you. Have patience as they learn the mechanics. 

Word of advice for the non-gamer significant other: give it a try. Even if it's not your favorite thing or if you think you're terrible, at least it's one more thing you can do together. Your gamer would much rather play with you. And you might discover something you're actually pretty good at and/or enjoy."

He's so sweet and never gets upset when I make a bad call or miss shooting the enemy and his online friends are so supportive as well.

He’d go days without texting me and I just thought he wanted his space so i’d let him be, and he’d hit me up to hang out about once every week where i’d hit him up to hang out about three times a week. I never even got jealous when he hung out with other girls because I trusted him. But I actively tried to engage in what he likes, I’d get him gifts that I know he would like, and I tried to be direct about what was bothering me in the relationship so we could try and change it. He never did any of that for me. I changed for him, he never changed for me but kept saying he would..."

Jdaddy2u,fe39upx,t1_fe35hwi,"Sounds like youthful immaturity on his part. You were ready for something that he wasn't able to give yet. Most of us guys take a lot longer to have the type of relationship you wanted. We often don't realize what he have until its gone. For your sake, let a guy know your expectations, boundaries etc. Be very direct  because we don't often see the intention until its too late. Also...you can't change anyone. They have to actively achieve it themselves."

thomasluna1995,fe3ha8k,t1_fe39upx,"I can say this is true. Me and my ex were like this. I was the guy who wasn’t ready and realized what I had when she was Gone. Half a year later I was blessed to have her come back into my life. I realized that we need to be on somewhat same page of communication. You are right, let the other one know expectation boundaries. Let it be known and have those talks. As a guy it’s hard for a change but if you are willing to sacrifice for someone who’s truly worth it, the outcome is so much better. Trust me."
FrigidLollipop,fe3le1p,t1_fe39upx,"To add on to what you posted, if after laying down your boundaries and intentions they still trespass them, believe them! Looking to actions vs words can save you from heartbreak. If one party is way more enthusiastic about the relationship than the other, dont ignore those signs."

I got rejected so many times in my life that when I frist got into a relationship I couldn't believe it. Confess to her man, you got it"

The closest I ever came to having a girl show genuine affection towards me was when I confessed to her that I liked her.


For two years, everytime I looked at her, I felt my heart skip beats at a time. Eventually it got so great that I had to let it out. So I wrote a poem.


At first, I thought it was a crappy poem, but then I showed a few friends it and they said it was really good. This gave me the confidence to show my crush the poem and tell her.


Later, she told me it was the sweetest thing she had ever received an thanked me for it. At first, I felt pretty good, but then she started sharing it with people that I didn't want to know or read the poem.


Now she mainly just (by my guess), tries to pretend I don't exist only making short remarks to stuff I say sparingly. And it crushes me whenever I see her.


After this year, I'm moving to a new school and will probably get the reason why she stopped talking to me. Especially when she is always with a group of girls.


Oh god. I hope she doesn't think I'm gay. That would crush me further.


But maybe when I move on to my new school I can find a girl who will show me this sort of affection. It would be really comforting. Gotta stay positive."

I grew up with a lot of pressure to perform well, and it scared me away from trying anything I wasn't a natural at.  Breaking that mentality is the single healthiest change I've made for myself - I embrace the opportunity to try anything new, and nearly every time I enjoy myself, if not learn something valuable.

It took some doing though, so anyone who's trying to make a similar change, don't be discouraged."

When I realized that everyone always looked so confident because they were at the dead centre of their comfort zone changed how I view things. 

Now I really do think I look confident even when I don't know something because I am willing to put my ego aside, understand that some people know more than I do on various topics and genuinely be interested in what they have to say so I can learn it myself."
JustWantsToChat,fdrovc9,t1_fdrn4c1,"100%, and that's what wisdom is, knowing that it's more important to know the information than be perceived as someone who does.  You won't look foolish for asking, but you will be a fool for trying without guidance when it's there for you."
JustWantsToChat,fdroewh,t1_fdrmd2b,"That's awesome boss.  It's tough for sure, you have to break you comfort zone open to realize it's bigger than you thought.  In my case, I'd kind of make a scene out of it, which seems counter-intuitive.  But something about inviting the attention, ""Hey, look at me about to embarrass myself!"" made it easier to swallow.  It's on my terms, almost performative, and that made it more comfortable.

For a while I worried about being perceived as a fool, but to my surprise, I've had some friends say they think highly of me for that trait because I'll say and do things they're scared of, and make them feel more at ease.  Fortunately I'm a large, scary-looking guy, so it's rare that anyone who might talk down to me actually does lol.

Nowadays I've inverted the problem: I'm the first to speak up in public settings, I order the weird things at restaurants, I agree to things I've never done without hesitation.  It's made me happier, and I feel like I'm making the people around me want to embrace new things too by following my example."

I found english quite easy.
and it's broad availability made it quite easy to learn it. But the listening comprehension and right pronunciation wasn't that easy and I'm still conscious about the latter. 
The option to speak with someone is a great benefit for learning a language. Oh and after Latin (which I gave up after a year) and French English was like ""Wow there are easy languages in this world! Yeah!"". In my first year I was still bad but at the end my mom took me to a pow wow (is it written that way?) and refused to translate for me. I wanted to buy this beautiful handmade bangle and there was this artist who made the most beautiful furniture I had ever seen. So I HAD to talk and it worked. After that I felt like ""wow I can more than I think"" and my grades went from an e to a c in one year, to an a in the next and I finished school with a certificate exam where I didn't have any mistakes. The good thing about English is once you know a little you make great progress.

I tried learning sign language, and I did decently well for the semester I took it, but I didn’t get much exposure. After the class ended I lost it pretty quickly, but I may try again sometime.

And don't forget, yall do it for fun, to escape some of life's stressing moments that makes you anxious, so you should focus a bit more on that aspect!


On the other side of the coin, you could also tell him you're not really into it if that's the case! I'm sure he'd be more than understanding!"

He said “A lot of people want to learn something, like a language or guitar. But they give up after a little bit, because they realize it will take years to learn. The thing is, in 5 years, you’re still going to have aged 5 years. That’s inevitable. The only difference will be in one scenario you will be 5 years older and be able to play guitar or speak spanish, or you can give up, not learn anything, and still be 5 years older.”"

Triggered_Mod,fdrhv60,t3_emr3mm,"2 stories to add that hopefully help:

I am a giant Greek Adonis at 6’6” 245lbs of rippling tattoo covered muscles in my hoodie ripped down the sides and short shorts- so naturally all I have to do is stare to the sky and Zeus will strike me with a lightning bolt of knowledge.  I calmly look off in the distance and whisper “I know one legged Romanian deadlifts” like Neo from the Matrix. 

Truthfully I fall constantly doing things.  I am on day 3 of heavy yolk walks and I convulse, fall over, ditch the bar, slowly list to one side and end up looking like a drunk ox.  Sometimes I laugh, sometimes I yell, sometimes when I do it I yell one of my “gym catch phrases.”  (“That’s how babies are made” or “Magic Motherfuckers!”)

There is absolutely nothing wrong with failing in the gym and anyone who tells you there is is a douche.  Don’t be self conscious and always ask for help.  

Second- When I was 18 I had to parallel park on Market St in Philadelphia with my dad’s business partner up by the City Center.  I was failing.  Cars behind me were honking, people were staring.  I looked at him and was like “I can’t do this, let’s trade places.”  He was the first adult person in my entire life to be like “you won’t ever be able
to do it if you don’t keep going until you succeed.”  It occurred to me that in my entire life my parents would give me a try then call me an idiot and do it themselves.  My teachers would be like “you didn’t get it. You fail.” 

I’m not saying every time and I’m not saying you have to...but maybe the next time you’re being inconvenienced by a kid or young adult trying to learn- if you have the time, be patient.  It will pay off in the long run for all of humanity."

nonoimgoodthanks,fdta8d7,t3_emr3mm,It sucks that judgy people exist. But it’s reality. There are people who will be judgmental that you are learning a new skill and aren’t proficient yet. They will make passive aggressive comments or roll their eyes or whatever. But screw em. Screw em right in the face. You learn that new skill and you mess up and you learn from your mistakes and you grow from it all. And when you are proficient you can look that Barbara right in the face and smile a sweet smile and kick ass.

Mortenskjell,fe79iim,t1_fe6gdrq,"Ok since we are kind of om the topic

I have this female friend, and we have been flirting a little with each other and i bought her some gifts every now and then. Wine, chocolate etc.

Last thursday she invited me on a trip in the mountains/Woods to sleep in hammocks. And that friday we did. However she is a very genuine person and she is kind to most people.
But as a girl, would you invite someone you met only about a month or two ago, to do something like that if you didn't have a thing for him?

I am a little blind when it comes to girls since i had very low confidence back in the days."
Cries_In_Russian,fe6l5mp,t1_fe6l2ap,I definitely want to. He’s probably the best thing that’s ever happened to me and is just overall so kind and supportive! Thank you
Cries_In_Russian,fe7a08n,t1_fe79iim,"I think she might, but it depends a lot on how she acted during the trip and her body language. As a girl I tend to put my feet pointing towards my bf subconsciously. Humans in general also dilate their pupils when they see someone they’re attracted to and play with their hair"

I am pretty sure she is into me
Im just used to never being good enough for people..."
Mortenskjell,fe7i388,t1_fe7a08n,"Also while laying in our hammocks she had her head out looking my direction the whole time

theguywhichmakespuns,fe7h0zi,t1_fe7a08n,"Wow can you be my advice giver? I tend to be very bad at receiving signals. I either think something is a signal or just straight up don’t see any. So there is this girl, but I don’t like her. I like her as a friend, but not like like her. She says something mean as a joke and then immediately says she ‘still loves me‘. So if she says that I just reply with: ‘Do I have to say something back?’, because I’m socially awkward. Does this might sound like she likes me or is she just messing with me? Besides this there is someone I like. How do I catch a girls attention?"

TurKoise,fe7yfxh,t1_fe7gxqe,"You should definitely tell her how you feel!! It will take a lot of courage, but what’s worse than rejection, is missing out on the opportunity to be with someone you really wanna be with. 

You honestly have nothing to lose by telling her how you feel. If she likes you in a romantic way as well - WOOHOO!! If she doesn’t like you in a romantic way - WOOHOO!! (Bc now you can move on and find the person who is crazy about you and would do anything to be with you!!)

Trust me!!! You could sit here and waste time by trying to analyze every situation with her, looking for “hints” that she’s into you. Instead, just talk to her about it!! Good luck friend you got this!!!"

theguywhichmakespuns,fe7eniw,t1_fe6wosn,"I started with English when I was 10 in school. Later I started with French and German, but I think German is way harder than English. English sounds more natural than German does. Might have to do something with the ages at what I started learning. I’m still improving my English and French, but stopped with German. I’ve tried Latin and old Greece too, but stopped with that due to some health issues"

Ander109,fe9kxo8,t1_fe7eniw,"Having grown up speaking several languages (I was taught French alongside English by my mom), then not speaking them since elementary school, and trying to relearn them, English is a strange language. The way English conjugates (or tends to not conjugate) nouns and the sentence structure, especially with questions, makes European languages pretty difficult. Learning any language is hard, but I've found a passion for German bc it allows me to connect with my dad's side of the family and I think it's a beautiful language even if somewhat difficult."

Andreas00Tm13,fe6o5eo,t1_fe6nfn8,"I once fell in love with a girl who considered herself ""ugly"" and ""bellow average"". You know why? She was genuine. She was and still is one of the most genuine persons I've ever met. I found her to be absolutely gorgeous.. From her smile to her cute little gestures. For months on end I couldn't stop thinking about how awesome she was. 

I couldn't get into a relationship with her because depression hit me hard afterwards because life happened.... but that's not the point, the point is that  by being geniune and developing yourself as a person will you attract someone.. And this goes both ways, for men and women.

Lol, this post made me realize how much I want to cuddle... :'(

Edit:typo"

screaminginfidels,fe6qecz,t1_fe6nfn8,"I'm sure someone does! I can tell from a 30 second profile stalk that you are uplifting and have dope taste in music, so I'm sure there are people that admire you! I've been single for years and it gets lonely, but I have faith that if I continue bettering myself, I will meet someone worth loving someday. And if I don't I will learn how to better love those around me who need it more than I do. 
My current crush told me how she will never make the first move because she got rejected once. My view is yes heartbreak is awful, but I'd rather take a chance than wonder what if? 
It can be dumb the things we don't realize until later as well. I remember one of the rare times a woman pursued me, it was a high school friend confessing her feelings toward me years later, and coincidentally I had JUST reconnected with another high school friend I semi-dated one summer and I thought now was my chance to make it happen. It never did, and I turned down the other friend reaching out because I ""had feelings for someone else."" Okay valid, but I should have at least tried and seen if we had a connection! I never really tried to make anything happen with the reconnected crush, and now shes married and just had her first kid.
Okay I've been rambling for an hour. My point is shoot your shot: you got this."

screaminginfidels,fe6qz9p,t1_fe6qx97,Can't have the whole without the sum and that makes it wholesome
polarpand,fe9jbyy,t1_fe7fzy8,"You probably feel this way because it happened so recently. Maybe instead of trying to find a new relationship right away (to avoid it being a way to get back at someone) take a while to do things that make you happy and find hobbies you enjoy. After you do that, maybe the despair you're feeling right now will have gone away, or at least subsided, making it easier to find a more meaningful relationship instead of jumping into one for the sole purpose of having a relationship."

Sendrith,fe6sroh,t1_fe6nrzj,"I was really fucked from my divorce, like I felt gutted emotionally. For years I never even wanted to contemplate another relationship. I had no interest anymore. I thought that part of me was just broken beyond repair.

I was in a toxic relationship myself early last year - had to cut ties with two different people, one who had been such an important person to my life over the last 7 or so years, but now that they're gone, it's an entirely different planet. You miss em but you realize that you're better off without them, and there's plenty of room for em to be replaced with people who serve your life so much better."
mysteriofukyourhead,fe6udrf,t1_fe6ovbw,"Just have to say your positivity, encouragement, and insight is super fucking life giving to read on this Sunday night. I am in US right now and this is the note I'm gonna end the night on. I recently got out of a long beautiful, adventurous relationship that ended with toxicity, confusion, and her wanting me to be someone I'm not. I recently have discovered a lot of healing and feel so much happier!! I respect myself and value my needs more. I've been dating again for the sake of meeting great people and making the most out of my time here on this Earth. Anyway, thank you for being such a breath of fresh air. Stoked for you and your boyfriend!"
therealmorko,fe6r84t,t1_fe6r02s,That’s 100% correct and I feel really priviledged that I have friends who I could talk about it but lately I’ve been really stressed out and my self-confidence has been like shit and I’ve not been able to speak with even my best friends anymore because I’m so paranoid about everything I say.
Cries_In_Russian,fe6uid3,t1_fe6udrf,Thank you so much. I hope you’re doing better! Have a wonderful night!
masterof80smetal,fe6xb8g,t1_fe6r84t,"Been there; done that. Man it's a hard thing to get over, but you can. I don't say it to sound cliche. It's just sometimes you need space and allowing yourself to breathe and vent and let it out.

What I did was take something you enjoy and find a way to make it therapeutic. 

Personally I am not a very good singer, or a fan of bars but I love karaoke. So I'd sing ""Fine Again"" by Seether for what was easily a couple months on end.

Then I got the courage to talk to said friends about the situation which led to the one being cut off. You have to take it in waves. It will never be easy to get over and become yourself again, but it can be done.

I'm now in a state where life isn't perfect - it's stressful still, but I'm learning more and more, growing, and have a great group of friends; old and new that I cannot imagine life without.

Stay strong OP. The light at the end of the tunnel is there. The journey is rough but the other side is a beauty."

luk9s0n,fe6p8sq,t1_fe6p6fh,Interesting. Though uve had several *signs* that a girl or teo were into me but i have never responded properly i domt even know what those signs meant lmao.
NickasBCray,fe7ys06,t1_fe6p6fh,I’m other words just be confident. If your confident and not reading from a script you’ll be fine.
Patsonical,fe6v322,t1_fe6p8sq,"Wait, you guys are getting *signs*‽"
Cries_In_Russian,fe6pahd,t1_fe6p8sq,"Yeah that’s pretty fair. My best solution is to just have a no bullshit talk, even if it’s about anything, to get the facts straight"
quaductas,fe9ozdz,t1_fe6v322,Upvote for the interrobang. Who needs a girlfriend if they can have punctuation
luk9s0n,fe6pbu9,t1_fe6pahd,The no bullshit talk? What exactly do you mean
Cries_In_Russian,fe6pef7,t1_fe6pbu9,"Like for example 
“Hey. I wanted to know if you legitimately have feelings for me or are just leading me on, because I want to get the facts straight”
Or just something similar, it’s a hard line to walk but a fruitful one nonethless"
luk9s0n,fe6pg86,t1_fe6pef7,Idk about others but no way im being that straightforward :ddd
Not_Jew_Dank,fe7sd8f,t1_fe6pef7,"This is just a little too forward and a bit accusatory. 

Maybe something closer to ""Yo. I'm vibing you. You vibing me too?"""
Cries_In_Russian,fe6phhh,t1_fe6pg86,That’s completely fair I can understand that coming from a big anxious boi like me

theasdfplayer,fe6qxmb,t1_fe6pxj5,How old are you anyway? I am 25 and still found nothing!
Cries_In_Russian,fe6r2be,t1_fe6qxmb,Lmao I shouldn’t really say but let’s just leave it at “minor” so maybe I’m not entirely experienced but still I hope soon you will find the love you deserve. There is always someone out there who will appreciate and support you. I read this interesting Article on how love is not a feeling but a conscious choice to support and care for someone and receive support and care from them.
NickasBCray,fe80z0f,t1_fe6r2be,"Listen sweetie I’m only 20 and already getting married. We’ve been together for 4 years now and have lived on our own for two years. We’re both so dedicated to each other. 

So many people say that after a couple months you’ll be sleeping in other rooms or getting in petty arguments, or that it won’t last. We still shower and sleep together everyday. The only thing we argue about is what we’re gonna eat because she says “I don’t care what we eat” and then gets picky.

You’ll know if they’re the one."
Cries_In_Russian,fe8ggz5,t1_fe80z0f,Thank you so much. That makes me feel so much better I wish I could give you a big ol hug

i’m 19 turning 20 this year and i thought it was weird but fuck man they’re so cold when i first get in bed so it’s nice on the neck to cuddle, plus they’re comforting lol. and yes i bring them with me when i travel or ill have one hell of a shitty sleep"
Rikitikitavi9162,fds4zho,t1_fdqysjv,"I'm 30 and I still sleep with my stuffed black leopard, Bagheera. My dad got me him when I was 7 or 8 for Christmas. I used to watch The Jungle Book all of the time when I was little. Baggy is the best."

My brother is a 24-year-old trucker who is getting married this summer, and I still bought him the new Star Wars LEGO set for his birthday. My best friend is an equally grown ass film director and a professional movie critic who lives in another state, and we still mail each other Squishmallows and rainbow pillows for the holidays.

I used to cuddle with a specific one for a while but now I've got so many and I love all of them, I can not cuddle with them all!!"
WhyNotJustMakeOne,fds9xay,t1_fdqysjv,"I'm 29, and I've had the same blanket for like 15 years. The texture is comforting for me. Unfortunately it's falling apart (in like 4 pieces now) and the manufacturer doesn't exist anymore."

purpskurrp,fdsb376,t1_fdqysjv,I’m 25 and got a stuffed animal doggy for my first birthday. I think I’ve spent less than 5 nights in my whole life (not including my first year of life) without him.
Iraelyth,fdsbfvn,t1_fdqysjv,"I just turned 30 and I have a teddy called Scottie that was as big as me when I was about 2. I slept cuddling him nearly every night but he sometimes got rotated out for some other teddies I was given. Now I’m married I still have Scottie, but I tend to cuddle my husband or the tiny cute Vulpix plush he bought me for my birthday the year before last (or both, because she is smol and fits between us 😊)"
IslandDanOSRS,fdscauk,t1_fdqysjv,"I’m 28 too and I have a teddy bear named ‘Beary Bear’ (Beary as in Berry) and I got it on my first birthday when I was 1 years old. I took it with me to college and every place I’ve ever slept. I recently got married and my wife has started to snuggle with Beary Bear whenever she takes a nap, but she knows that when it’s time to sleep that it’s time for Beary Bear and I to get our cuddle time."

SarahLRL,fdscnaf,t1_fdqysjv,"28 too and still sleep with my teddy bear. He was a gift on the day I was born and I’ve slept with him ever since (bar when I was ill as a child and he’d be taken away and another bear took his place so he didn’t get germy). We went to nursery together on my first day as I was nervous, and years later he came to university with me too.  My mum tried to convince me not to take him as people might laugh at me, to which I said I’d know who not to be friends with. Turns out I ended up best friends with a girl who also had two cuddly toys in her bedroom, and a flouncy flowery quilt her nana made her."

clamchauder,fdsf0ma,t1_fdqysjv,"Reading all these lovely stories, makes me sick to my stomach that I threw away my own plush puppy, bunny and baby blanket last year. :( I had a boyfriend who didn't like to share the bed with them, so they went into storage in the closet for years before I decided to let them go (including the boyfriend). 

I miss all my comfort items so much now that I'm alone."
monsoon_in_a_mug,fdsf6m0,t1_fdqysjv,"33 here and I still have my childhood companions- a stuffed leopard and a teddy bear. They used to sleep with me but my 4 year old daughter had nightmares so now the leopard sleeps with her to protect her dreams and my 1.5 year old decided she needed a companion too, so she sleeps with my teddy bear. Secretly, it was hard to give them up but I console myself with the idea that they enjoy having proper full time toy jobs again."
Sherlock_Homiez,fdsfnwy,t1_fdqysjv,18 and when I’m lonely I sleep with a teddy bear named Oscar I’ve had since I was 8 or 9. Just having it makes me happy and if it someday somehow disappears or gets destroyed I will cry for days...

duuckyy,fdsal9j,t1_fdqzmsp,"My boyfriend gave me this teddy bear he got when he was a kid (it has superman pajamas and he knew my dad loved super man). On our one year anniversary he got me a monkey from build-a-bear (because he calls me monkey). When I'm at his place and he goes out for the night with his friends, I sleep with the monkey. If I'm spending a few days at my own house without him, I sleep with the teddy bear. Both help me fall asleep and he thinks it's so cute when he comes home and I'm cuddled up with the monkey. I love him"

Fef_,fdsaqwt,t1_fdqzmsp,"My mom always brings her teddy when she stays the night with us. She got it from her now husband. I never gave it too much thought but I also never realised how nice it is to have something comforting from your own home with you on trips. I think I might pull out my 19yo cat plush, the only plush I brought to see my family in Surinam with, the plush I had when I was asleep in a burning car, went with me to see gramma after my parents divorce. Come to think of it, they're such a big support when you're young, why not when you're getting older as well? Plushie are awesome. I love you, mom."
waywardhero,fdsvg63,t1_fdqzmsp,Aaaaaaand I’m gonna go buy a plush for my girl. You might have caused an up market in plushies.

Fef_,fdsb4vz,t1_fdrvhlt,"My mom is turning 42 this year and always brings her teddy when she sleeps over at our place, comfort is important at any age, what's better than a soft teddy to cuddle with?

BrokenSaint333,fdself7,t1_fdrzure,I'm 30 and sleep with a blanket I got the day I was born. It's falling apart now so eventually I'll have to say goodbye but until it literally disintegrates I'll have it. I can sleep without it but it's never as restful.
rainumi,fdsa65p,t1_fds0w0e,"Also having something from childhood, specially something that you've grown up around will give you comfort and provide you with familiarity even when stressed out."

Ihadacow,fdsak2i,t1_fdrydti,"Yes, he had it on a bejeweled collar around it's neck. He gave it to me as a Christmas gift and I couldn't understand why he was so excited to give me a stuffy.

I dont see that dude very much anymore lol"
brokegradstudent_93,fds0ll2,t1_fdrpwsm,I don’t get why people can’t just say “that trend isn’t for me” there is no reason to belittle others for the hobbies or trends they enjoy.

On the other hand, now that they *are* adults, they have to recognise that their habits and modes of thinking hurt both themselves and the people that they care about, and they have a responsibility to try to change."
brokegradstudent_93,fdsbaox,t1_fdsa3cs,Oh I agree. If someone respectfully says “it’s not for me” that should be respected as well. However sometimes people refuse to try new things and it’s good to get people out of their comfort zones sometimes. But don’t harass someone

Oh, and she hated FPS games, but I got her into The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, as its still an first-person perspective RPG.  Then she got into Skyrim, and has logged over 2000 hours, completing that game with every race.  This was after she logged about 300 hours on my Steam account, before I bought her a copy for herself.

A \*lot\* of people are a lot older than you and still play Pokémon when it comes out, and I have a few friends that bond with their kids over Pokémon.

If you want Pokémon, just buy it.  Once your fiancee sees you happy, they honestly should be happy that you've found something you love.  Just... don't spend \*all\* of your time on it.

BeautifulPlankton,fdsg5n0,t1_fdr3rcn,I just started a relationship and she has been positive about me being a Pokémon fan (I'm 28). I was expecting her to mock me (like some friends and most of my family) but she started playing Pokémon Go with me and thinks about maybe playing Sword with me. She's the best :)
Zavahl,fdryaq0,t1_fdr6h4f,"Believe it or not, but a large part of Pokemon fans are 25+ as they grew up with it starting in the first generation (I myself am 25 and have played every single Pokemon generation thus far)"

Being child-like = finding simple happiness in things and looking at the world with delight and wonder and curiosity.

We just completed the Galar Pokédex and are super pumped for the expansions for Sword and Shield.  <3 They’re all-ages games, man. Enjoy them!"
boo29may,fdsdorr,t1_fdsd12v,"I've never played it on phone so I can't tell. I find playing it on thw switch much nicer because I'm not confined to the game saving only every time you go to sleep and being able to play in bed. I did think of buying it on the mobile too and seing other discussions on reddit it seems to be worth it.

Edit: sorry I just realised this is not a comment from r/stardewvalley. You should absolutely buy it! I have it on my PC and switch. It is an awesome relaxing game. But at the same time, time in the game flies by and you feel like it is never enough. Check out the subreddit. One of the amazing things about this game is it's positivity.

I don’t get it, I can’t stand that music, I can’t stand that toxic industry, I can’t stand the toxic idol culture. What do i do? I fucking tag him in Kpop stuff I see, send him snaps of Kpop stuff that make me think of him, and buy him those weird caps with  peircings for his birthday. We don’t need to love the same music to love each other.

krispwnsu,fds2e9v,t1_fdryqfq,I agree with this except if you really think the industry don't buy your friend their products just because you like him. If a friend of mine liked Chick Fil'A and I thought their hate group support was awful I wouldn't buy their gift cards for a friend. Get him a different gift you think he will like.

I knew them for 6 years and we never shared the exact same interests prior. I think the difference in the culture of Korean music was too much for them and they just didnt know how to talk to me. It was a pretty harsh experience but I'm over it now. Hopefully they are happy doing whatever they're up to."
lemoonriv,fdrnhhb,t1_fdrke9u,"Same for me, I mean they know I like them but they definitely don't have any interest in them so I don’t have anyone who wants to binge watch and listen to them haha"
heros_soup,fdrkiss,t1_fdrke9u,You should check put Ateez and Stray Kids. They're both amazing and super hardworking.  Dont worry about your friends laughing at you. The people who matter will be happy you have something you like.
heros_soup,fdse88u,t1_fdrt1gf,I commend you for your honesty and appreciate your respect. Thata basically how I feel about things. I think my old  friend just panicked and didnt know what to talk about anymore.

nocimus,fds69di,t1_fds0dbx,"idk man, kpop fans are a breed apart.  You're talking about an industry with a massive amount of issues, including things like the idols not being allowed to openly date whomever they want.  I could 100% see a friend getting weirded out or turned off by all of that if someone went _hardcore_ into it."
heros_soup,fds8oh3,t1_fds2daz,Haha you're the first person to recognize it. Nice to run into another STAY.
Vicky135246,fds7n3s,t1_fds69di,"\^ this. I've been into the genre since 2011., now only following BTS and MAMAMOO, and I'd never judge someone for istening to anything.  


But the moment I hear someone drooling over kpop idols, or ignoring the negative sides of the industry, or stupidly commenting on Asian culture acting like they know it better than actual Asians speaking out about it, I'm out."
voksul,fds9in7,t1_fds7n3s,"There's a reason Kpop stans have the reputation that they do. There's nothing wrong with liking the genre in general, but someone going hardcore into it is a red flag that can absolutely spin into friendship-ending issues. The community is *incredibly* toxic. Like, sending death threats to people who don't like Kpop or sending death threats to the idols themselves when they don't act exactly how they want them to. It very much gets into the ""hurting anyone"" category."
heros_soup,fds9mb9,t1_fds7n3s,"As someone who is an ""older"" kpop fan I agree that there is a dark side to kpop fans sexualizing idols or ignoring some of the dark side of the industry. I've found myself rather selective in which companies I choose to support because of that."

Besides what if challenging yourself and stepping outside your comfort zone to encourage growth makes you happy?"
AutomaticTale,fds6mt6,t1_fdrtl4k,I feel really sad for you if challenging yourself or growing doesnt make you happy.
justhereforacomment6,fds5bug,t1_fdrtl4k,"It's trying to define happiness into a libertine view away from an aristotelian view which argues happiness is derived from (virtuous) achievement, not contentment with frivolities."
generic_8752,fds9qok,t1_fdrtl4k,Agreed. You gotta expand your artistic boundaries sometimes by reading things or watching movies or listening to music that takes extra-effort to appreciate (and might not automatically make you happy) but it helps you grow as a person.

purplearmored,fds2j59,t3_emtoc1,Maybe you should read something besides 'trash' once in a while though? I can't see this being said to anyone who merely had a preferred genre and didn't come off as ill-informed.
BrokenSaint333,fdse1qb,t1_fds2j59,"Like what? People keep saying shit like this but I can't really fathom what they mean. Like pretentious shit like ""the classics""? Or self help books or some shit? I honestly don't know lol"
purplearmored,fdsts7w,t1_fdse1qb,I mean vary it up. There's nothing wrong with 'trash' but if someone comes off shallow enough that someone would actually say that to you there's benefits in variety. Most 'classics' are trash that have stood the test of time and connect with a lot of people and make them think so that's a good place to start.

champbob,fdsou92,t3_emtoc1,"My first year in college, me and my roommates went to an anime store. Mainly because they were curious and it was on the way back from Walmart.

I see a little anime plush that I want to buy. Before I buy, a roommate pulls me aside and goes ""... Aren't you a little too old for that?"". Confused, but compromising, I didn't buy it. Some of the walk back was them ranting at how childish plushies were and me being embarrassed trying to say it's not a big deal. Well, we were all brand new freshman in college at this point, and those roommates have barely had any interaction with anime aside of Pokemon, Naruto, and One Piece, so I'm sure they were all very weirded out already, but man, being told your acting like a little kid for wanting something sucks. 

And then in the next year, I get my first anime plush from someone (in a completely separate friend group from the roomy's) in a Secret Santa. That made me super happy! At this point, the roomie who pulled me aside already moved out and the other roomie was way more accepting of it now, since he himself was exposed a lot more to much weirder people. And now, my anime merch is exponentially growing, amd my weeb level continues to rise!

Tldr; People are weirded out by what's completely foreign to them. And it's hard to enjoy those foreign things in the face of them. But things get better, and I hope you always have a safe space to enjoy whatever you want!"

RFC793,fdhloyt,t3_elcfaa,"Somewhat tangential (pun intended), but here is some advice to those who are going to take the GRE. I got a 800/800 on the quantitative section (the older scoring system). I wouldn’t have been able to if I didn’t memorize one critical thing. Learn how to draw the unit circle at 45 and 30 deg (pi/4, pi/6 rad) increments. That is, the coordinates for each angle. It isn’t too hard if you remember how some of them reflect. Draw it on your scratch paper as the first thing you do.

There are so many questions that will touch on trig. And even just knowing the sign or max bounds of the answer will isolate a single answer from the multiple choices. You won’t even have to solve them. You can even deduce most of the trig identities via the unit circle.

Cheers!

He’s even gotten me things like one of their records and a sweatshirt, among other things, so I’m really happy about that.

Then he would make friends with whoever was working the tables or the band members who came into the crowd. He likes to give people a god casual conversation every now and then.

My Dad was the drummer for a cover band called Sun back when my Mom was pregnant with me, so my first concert WAS my Dad, before and after I was born. My first ‘not Dad’ concert was ZZ Top, just before I was born, if that counts. 
My parents split up when I was 2, but they’ve both made sure music and the arts are huge parts of our lives, with music being Dads area of expertise, obviously. 
To this day, whenever any of us (Dad, my 2 sisters, or our brother) goes to a concert without each other, we will call each other from the venue so we can all listen together. I mean, okay, the music sounds pretty terrible coming out of the phone. But that doesn’t matter! 
We’re with Dad, and Dad is with us. That’s what really counts."

Instead she called me after classed and asked me if the person in the drawing was her, I said yes. She asked me if I wanted to become a designer or something related, I said no. She said thank god and pretended to be angry because maybe I drew her hair way too big and cartoonish, but I knew that deep inside she was laughing.

In my defense I've always been terrible at drawing. Ever since that happened, she would tell me not to draw her never again before every exam. It kind of became our thing."

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."

ScenicHwyOverpass,fdkzmbg,t3_elx9wc,"Why is the human body so ill equipped for snuggling, there is legitimately not a single position that I find comfortable for longer than like 5 minutes."
Not_jeff__,fdlhcdw,t1_fdkzmbg,"Sleep on your back and have your SO face you and use above ur armpit as a pillow with ur arm around them. My favorite way, super relaxing and comfy"
1stOnRt1,fdl2pav,t1_fdkzmbg,"I dont get this at all. 

The gf and I are the kind of couple who literally sleeps wrapped around eachother. Maximize skin to skin contact."
RememberTheKracken,fdlnvbx,t1_fdkzmbg,"You're asking the wrong question, the real question is why aren't beds designed to make it easier? Like there's pillows that can cradle your knees elbows head and neck perfectly while still providing good testicle support and allow you to easily breathe. but the whole mega pillow market seems to be solely focused on catering to lonely people. Why not a couple's pillow with an arm slot? Or a small barrier that keeps the hair out of the face but still allows you to breathe?"
Rogersgirl75,fdm06of,t1_fdkzmbg,"This is why having a huge height difference is amazing.  My bf is 6’4 and I am 4’11.”  

If he is the big spoon, I can slide down enough to where my butt is at his groin, and then since I’m much shorter, his arm can comfortably go over my head, or under my neck without my head putting too much pressure on it.   Even better if he puts it under my neck because he can stretch his whole arm around my collarbone or shoulders in a big hug."
Havest22,fdljfk1,t1_fdkzmbg,"do yoga, it helps with this"
TheMagicalJohnson,fdlwzob,t1_fdkzmbg,Put your arm under the pillow for easy release and so you don't RIP their hair out.
Piebro314,fdm3743,t1_fdkzmbg,"Become your partners mattress, simple"
CrumbledCookieDreams,fdm0y08,t1_fdkzmbg,I just curl up on the middle of their chest like a cat.
Oh_its_that_asshole,fdm07m4,t1_fdkzmbg,"Arm underneath goes to waist, a bit above hip, hand + forearm wraps around. Arm on top breastbone to shoulder. Pull your human teddy bear close and snuggle. Sorted."
Ladyqui3tbottom,fdm4qdd,t1_fdkzmbg,"You just have to put the lower arm slightly above the head and properly cushion your neck (if your a healthy person without limitations). I've never had a problem with spooning.

Edit: under the neck also works perfectly fine. Why are people torturing themselves?"
Holts70,fdm6czj,t1_fdkzmbg,"Face to face, arms wrapped

Ahh, I remember intimacy.  It was pretty great."
ptmd,fdm6r97,t1_fdkzmbg,Get one of the stiffer memory foam pillows that gives clearance if your head is on it.  Your arm can comfortably fit in there while feeling minimal pressure.
empirelts,fdm7a5e,t1_fdkzmbg,"I like to lie right on top of my bf, he loves the pressure and he’s basically my personal pillow. But I doubt we could sleep that way"
OlafMcBiggles,fdn1u0n,t1_fdkzmbg,"Just be really large and have the much smaller person lay on top of you. That's what I M-6'5""-250lbs do with my partner F-5'5""-125lbs. 

At least that's how it WOULD go if she could sit still for 30 seconds. Usually we both end up laying on our sides with our backs against each other. It's oddly comforting and we still get to sleep in our preferred positions and have a good amount of physical contact. I'm pretty sure she only keeps me around because I'm a human furnace!

The other position I call psuedo-spooning. She lays on her side facing away from me but still uses my arm as a pillow. I lay on my back and put my knee in the nook of hers. I'm large enough that she feels like she's getting full spoon and the position allows me the freedom so my arm doesn't die."
HaresWillRoll,fdljexv,t1_fdlhcdw,Yes but then what does your partner do with their other arm? That always my issue. I either lie on it until it gets numb or have it just sticking out behind me which is awkward
Dmaj6,fdlrkv7,t1_fdlhcdw,"I can’t sleep on my back and be comfy at the same time lol, when I sleep I HAVE to be on my side. Doesn’t matter anyways cause I don’t got anyone to cuddle"
bhowandthehows,fdltd06,t1_fdlhcdw,"My SO does this, but with her back to me. It has the added bonus of me being able to roll onto my side and be insta-big spoon if I need to adjust my sleeping position. It also means her arm doesn’t get trapped between us."
Shortsonfire79,fdls4sv,t1_fdlhcdw,"I love this, but she puts her leg (or both) over mine and hyperextends one or either of my knees. I already have bad knees. If she goes higher up on my thigh it's fine, but she's taller than I am so as she falls into sleep her legs relax and slide down to my knees."
t-nugz,fdlkodr,t1_fdlhcdw,This guy knows how to snuggle!
feAgrs,fdm07hn,t1_fdlhcdw,"If I lay on my back, I just can't sleep for the life of me. I can lay awake on my back for hours and 3 seconds after I roll over I'm asleep. It's pretty annoying"
ScenicHwyOverpass,fdlz17g,t1_fdlhcdw,"You're very lucky, I am too warm, too fussy a sleeper, and my limbs are always going numb."
mattforsleep92,fdm4jka,t1_fdlhcdw,Sleeping on my back gives me sleep paralysis tho 😭😭😭
zffacsB,fdm2tsv,t1_fdlhcdw,I’m HIGHLY ticklish so I would end up having a complete meltdown
slayersaint,fdm6vzq,t1_fdlhcdw,"Ah yes, me and the wife call this “comfy position”. And it is exactly that."
thescarwar,fdmeflw,t1_fdlhcdw,And then I get in trouble for snoring :( rightfully so of course
Left_Shark88,fdm6mjl,t1_fdlhcdw,Bold of you to assume I have someone to cuddle with
eclectic_banana,fdl66lu,t1_fdl2pav,"Good for you guys. For me, it usually gets hot after five minutes even if it's winter."
Von_Moistus,fdlorn0,t1_fdl2pav,My wife radiates enough heat in her sleep to smelt copper. I can’t do the snuggles for more than a few minutes before I feel my internal organs start to cook.
contrabille,fdlo106,t1_fdl2pav,It helps if she's smaller. I have a good nine inches on my gf (and three in her on my birthday) so it's usually comfy.
Shuiner,fdlnrzy,t1_fdl2pav,Skin to skin makes me so itchy. I'm always putting a sheet between my husband and I.
LESSANGRYTHANISOUND,fdltgr5,t1_fdl2pav,You’re probably the right height for each other. Also right size. It’s difficult to get the dimensions right!
SAI_Peregrinus,fdlsuey,t1_fdlnvbx,"They make them. https://www.amazon.com/Sendk-Washable-Improves-Circulation-Pressure/dp/B07W66MYMJ for example. They're decent, but may not work well for you depending on the size of whoever has their arm through it and whoever has their head on it. Too thick a bicep (or too big/small a shoulder) will be uncomfortable."
Catharsis,fdm56s3,t1_fdlnvbx,There are mattresses that have escape hatches for your arms: https://www.cuddle-mattress.com/
Not_jeff__,fdljmfs,t1_fdljexv,Never thought of that rlly. Isn’t it just the same as when you sleep on your side?
Slammogram,fdlytx4,t1_fdljexv,"I curl it against my chest, which is also awkward."
Phaedrug,fdloghz,t1_fdljexv,This question always reminds me of that scene in Mallrats.
RegularWoahMan,fdlvh1j,t1_fdljexv,"I tuck my bottom arm up so my hand is near my sternum. I do this when I jetpack too because I have a weird nerve condition where I pinch them much more easily than most people, so extending my arm by his neck is a bad idea."
Aforkeocelot,fdm3m82,t1_fdljexv,Get an one armed partner. Or use a bone saw.
silverrfire09,fdm539a,t1_fdljexv,my ex used to like to sleep on his back and I like to sleep on my side and it worked out great. not sure what I do with my arm tbh even though I sleep like that every night
notsurewhatsunique3,fdme4w9,t1_fdljexv,"The one sleeping on their back? They wrap the pillow arm around the other person. The one using the pillow arm can rest their top arm on the others chest/stomach. The bottom arm can be bent at the elbow with the hand on their own face or straightened and put between their own legs. Whatever's comfortable really. 

Bonus tip put a pillow above the arm of the one laying on their back but below the one on their sides head. More comfort less dead arm."
copperwatt,fdm5qmt,t1_fdljexv,Only date amputees. Solved!
-plz-dont-touch-me-,fdls6sy,t1_fdlrkv7,Lonely gang where you at
athelas_07,fdlu3jb,t1_fdls4sv,Thin pillow under your knees?
Not_jeff__,fdmandv,t1_fdm6mjl,Don’t worry I don’t either right now :/ this was from previous experience
OdinDOUCS,fdldzf2,t1_fdl66lu,Just means you're a hot couple
1stOnRt1,fdl6ful,t1_fdl66lu,"Its a fine balancing act. 

Weve had moments where we suddenly wake up covered in sweat lol

Living in Toronto and only sleeping under a sheet usually keeps us cool enough."
TheDarkSwordsman,fdlov2x,t1_fdlo106,"I was going to reply with:

> > I have a good nine inches on my gf 

> I sure hope so

Until I actually finished reading:

> and three in her on my birthday"
Alpha3031,fdm3ta8,t1_fdlo106,"> three in her on my birthday

For the whole day? That sounds uncomfortable."
thoughtofitrightnow,fdlxzuk,t1_fdlnrzy,I’m glad you have someone you can cuddle comfortably with. ^=^
1stOnRt1,fdma00l,t1_fdltgr5,haha the right size is right. 6'4 and 5'2
TriflingGnome,fdm6u8u,t1_fdlsuey,Have one. They totally suck. I'd say it even makes things more uncomfortable
Elle_mactans,fdlkd58,t1_fdljmfs,"We use you're technique to cuddle, but I cant forever because I (F and the shoulder sleeper) like to sleep with my elbow folded up with my palm touching my cheek, my preferred way is the fetal position. 

Sometimes i end up just sleeping just sprawled poo out over him with my head on his shoulder like you mentioned before, belly tucked down, left arm over his chest. We like to cuddle until the brink of uncomfortability.

Edit. Sprawled poo typo hehehe."
IGiveOffTheGayVibe,fdlk3lw,t1_fdljmfs,"Personally, my bestfriend (we cuddle, she's got depression and it makes her feel better) curles her arm and presses it against me. That's the comfiest way for her."
ShebanotDoge,fdlzggn,t1_fdljmfs,Well now we know what cuddler you are.
intimatebadthoughts,fdlsrse,t1_fdls6sy,username checks out?
Shortsonfire79,fdmn6es,t1_fdlu3jb,I'll give that a shot. My pillows have become pretty compressed anyways. Thanks!
supernasty,fdlpj84,t1_fdldzf2,I’ve notice this also depends on the size of your partner. I’ve had problems with sweating within minutes of cuddling past partners. But my girlfriend of 1 year is very small compared to me and we can cuddle for hours before I get to that point.
Pyrollamasteak,fdlrtxn,t1_fdldzf2,Or if the couple is married they are hot husband and hot wife.
cndloowho,fdlq55v,t1_fdl6ful,"Delicate balance, indeed! We balance by cuddling for a little and then go to our separate bed corners. We’re both tall (and he’s rather burly), we both toss and turn and run quite hot as well, so we don’t like cuddling to sleep. 

However, over the years we’ve developed ‘touch check’ habits during the night to make sure the other is still there, like we’ll go butt to butt, give a quick back rub, or touch the other’s leg with our toes."
AlCapwn351,fdls1mc,t1_fdl6ful,"Oh man, I get really hot really fast but my fiancée is on the opposite side of the spectrum and gets really cold. Like she wants to bump the heat up to 71 and I want it at 60. So I sleep with nothing and she puts on heated blankets. She’s fine but I still wake up sweaty."
contrabille,fdmc9rp,t1_fdm3ta8,No that's her birthday.
G-III,fdllsxi,t1_fdlkd58,"I should’ve known this wasn’t the thread for me lol, ah man happy couples."
thoughtofitrightnow,fdlxm3t,t1_fdlkd58,"Saaaaame. Me more so than my boyfriend. He likes cuddles but has back problems (yay living into your 30s). I have some abandonment trauma from my past so cuddling can sometimes feel like a necessity for me. But I’ve been trying to nurture my past selves and convince myself nothing is wrong. I think I’m finally starting to believe it. 

But yeah I destroyed my arm this past cuddle session. I love when he falls asleep in my arms so I don’t move like the guy in the comic. I stay for as long as I can lol."
taoistchainsaw,fdlqltf,t1_fdlkd58,That’s a very specific way to sprawl poo.
The_Indian_Gamer,fdlsvwx,t1_fdlkd58,Sprawled poo?
Muskrat43,fdm89td,t1_fdlkd58,"From my experience with my wife, no matter how we fall asleep, I wake up with half her body on my side of the bed and somehow sideways"
Doom7313,fdlqlx9,t1_fdlk3lw,That’s nice that you do that for your friend!
__despicable,fdlsv0c,t1_fdlk3lw,Something about you is giving off the gay vibe...
Forsaken_Accountant,fdludov,t1_fdlk3lw,You're such a sweet friend! Great that you help her that way 😊
-plz-dont-touch-me-,fdltqxc,t1_fdlsrse,:(
TheSpyrexian,fdlptqc,t1_fdlpj84,"I think I get what you mean with ‘girlfriend of 1 year’... but all the same. Come on
“Very small compared to me”"
Kc1319310,fdlr79u,t1_fdlpj84,"I’m only 5’2 and sadly cuddling with my fiancé is still far too uncomfortable for sleepy times. His arm goes dead and I end up drenched in sweat because he radiates heat like an erupting volcano. Snuggles are relegated to a random, middle of the day activity."
1stOnRt1,fdma48t,t1_fdls1mc,"This is our exact circumstance. Its why we use a sheet.

Use your warmth to keep her from getting cold, and her cold stops you from getting warm :)"
Notthatcoolawolf,fdls2op,t1_fdllsxi,"Hang in there bud. Just store this information so that  one day when you’re in this situation, you’ll recall and it’ll make you and someone special very happy.

This period sucks. But if you practice self improvement,  good grooming habits, and respect those around you, you will no doubt be a catch."
Aeropolitanflan,fdm1npw,t1_fdllsxi,"Don't worry, my body pillow never complains. °¤°"
copperwatt,fdm5wvj,t1_fdlqltf,Dude straight up sprawled poo yo!
thoughtofitrightnow,fdlxoax,t1_fdlsvwx,Sprawled out I’m guessing.

Forsaken_Accountant,fdlu4eu,t1_fdlptqc,*Oh no*
anthroteuthis,fdlwjhw,t1_fdlr79u,"My husband does that too.  It's like cuddling an oven, but only when he's actually asleep.  Some weird metabolism thing, I guess."
DaftZack,fdlx7q8,t1_fdlr79u,"I'm like your man. I love cuddling, but when it's bed time I get waaaay to warm. Like, some nights I wake up and have to get a towel and dry off, which is just great, haha."
828-20,fdlt8j4,t1_fdls2op,"Not OP, but thanks mate, really. Got out of a relationship rather recently and Ive been second guessing myself for it. I needed to hear that"
G-III,fdlv2vt,t1_fdls2op,"Honestly what sucks is I don’t even really struggle with women, always get along famously with everyone really. I just have no motivation for life, and no semblance of happiness to get me through to a place where I could find some. It’s my responsibility though, so while I’m miserable I only blame myself.

Good advice though, and appreciate the positivity for sure. Cheers"

FrankanelloKODT,fdm0dvr,t1_fdlx7q8,Can relate; the blood runs too hot. It’s good for a little while as my wife runs a bit cold so I get 5-10mins of awesome cuddles before I start overheating both of us

Ka_Mi,fdm892m,t1_fdlv2vt,"There are streaks in life where it can feel painfully robotic.  I've had to pull myself out with a number of techniques. Seeing a counselor, taking SAM-e, daily gratitude journal, workouts, strict diet, etc.

I hope you figure out how to pull that purpose back into your life ❤️"
canttellthecat,fdmqm7w,t1_fdlv2vt,"Sounds like you might be depressed. If life is how you want it but you feel bad, that sounds like something is wrong. I hope you'll think about talking to someone about it, these things CAN be helped."
Notthatcoolawolf,fdmk8mm,t1_fdm312v,"That’s very kind of you. And because you took the time to write that out, means more to me than some flair. So thank you"
weskokigen,fdm0ej8,t1_fdlyczl,You too!
G-III,fdmeqhk,t1_fdlzdiw,Honestly? No. Thanks for asking. Hope you are though!
G-III,fdmey9u,t1_fdm892m,"I dearly wish I could find anything in life worth working toward. Honestly I’m just waiting for my parents to pass it seems most days. As long as I can be relatively in their life until they’re gone, they’ll be happy enough. And that’s it, beyond that I don’t care. I mean I care, I care tremendously about everyone. But certainly not enough to suffer through life for them."

Back to sleep: I highly recommend having a king size bed, creating a pillow divide and sleeping with your own blankets and pillows. 

People think it’s weird at first to not share covers, but when you’re not wrestling and tugging at your blankets all night you will thank me! And when you wake up next to each other and actually feel well rested, it’s the best. 

Enjoy some coffee in bed the next morning, and have a nice day 😊"
thoughtofitrightnow,fdlyk9j,t1_fdll22i,"Yes so much to separate blankets. I was in a long term and she somewhat got the concept but was not sure why we needed it. I loved it, maybe she wanted more affection, or it felt like another divide coming between us. Honestly after 10 years we kinda stopped cuddling and would sleep at different times. Kinda just fuck and go back to our own thing. Maybe that’s too cynical, who knows. 

Funnily enough been dating this guy for about 6 months and I’m super affectionate and cuddly with him. Wouldn’t want to have separate blankets with him just yet. I’m sure with time the big cuddly phase will pass. And if it becomes long term hopefully I remember the flaws from my past and actively work on improving them."
YourSkatingHobbit,fdm07aw,t1_fdll22i,"This! The only time I’ve slept even remotely well next to my boyfriend is when we had an AirBnB with a super-king bed. One duvet but so huge he couldn’t steal it, or boil me with his furnace-like body heat. (I have a regular double bed but we don’t live together). My folks (m 31yrs) have a king with separate sides/mattresses and a divide in the middle."

Pet play is a fetish where one human takes the role of another humans pet. This would essentially make the ""pet"" immortal until their owner dies.

Now imagine the consequences. Suddenly the BDSM community would turn into the greatest military force any country could have. A single ""pet"" would be worth hundreds if not thousands of soldiers. Capable of surviving anything as long as the owner is not killed, and in some cases even relishing the pain.

PlayTheFookinOBJ,fdgroys,t1_fdgd5bf,"Sure, a good chunk of human society can be pretty nasty towards nature. But to deem all of human society as terrible is like generalizing a certain race or ethnicity of people to a stereotypical trait. We humans are capable of good and bad. 

To a nihilist, a pessimist, and certain religious sects, we can be perceived as inherently evil. But as one stated before me. The concept of “being terrible” is one that was created by us. I won’t deny that humans have sped up the process to the next mass extinction event. But we’re definitely not a *plague*. That’s some big eco-doomer energy right there! We’re just a different type of force of nature... Just way too OP I guess. 

We’re essentially like bees, in which we can help pollinate the land and help the environment. But we’re also like locusts and other destructive species. We trod on others’ territory and consume more than we should."

We are still animals, and sometimes we can do terrible things for some really silly reasons. But to quote one of my favourites quotes from true detective :   “Well, once there was only dark.

Who is to say that we human beings aren't doing exactly what we are meant/designed/evolved to do? Drain a bunch of natural resources in our sprint up the technological ladder, cause a mass extinction or two on the way, and then fly off into space like a bunch of spores from an old mushroom.

The Earth has lost large percentages of species in the past to natural disasters and climate shifts. How exactly can anyone be sure that species like humanity aren't the same thing? A natural phenomenon that will come and go, and a few hundred million years later the cycle persists."

The_Best_01,fdhbe53,t1_fdh7x6f,"> if NASA detected an unstoppable earth destroying asteroid...impact us in 40 years

I would hope they would spend the next 40 years developing something to intercept or destroy the asteroid. In 40 years I don't think they'll be such a thing as an ""unstoppable"" asteroid. Your point would be correct if we were talking about an impact next week, or even in a few years.

I think a more urgent reason to leave earth is overpopulation, and I personally think building space habitats in addition would be better than just colonizing Mars, as I doubt all of humanity could comfortably fit on Mars habitats, unless we terraform it or something, which would take another couple of centuries or longer.

Also, we're going back to the Moon and sending women now, so that's cute. But living on the Moon will end badly if the Earth gets fucked and there's still no way to defend against an asteroid.

But yeah, to summarize, our best priorities right now are developing clean energy, ways to get more food and water to people because scarcity *will* become a problem before too long, and asteroid defense systems. Better ways to deal with natural disasters would be great too."

There's so many other scenarios from distant supernovas to solar flares to God knows what else, that couldn't be defended from. The undeniable fact is, if we want to keep from going extinct, we need to leave this planet. Period. All our astrophysicists agree on this.

You're worried about how to keep this planet alive in the long term, when you should be worrying about how to keep *humanity* alive in the long term.

If we had to strip every natural resource from earth to turn humanity into a self sufficient interstellar species, the only correct reaction would be ""Let's do it."" To do anything else and remain on this planet is an eventual death sentence to us (and also all other life)."

How can a locust swarm be something natural, but the human swarm be something unnatural? Is it because one can destroy an entire ecosystem in a year, and take decades to recover, while the other takes hundreds of thousands of years, and (might) take millions of years to recover?

I don't think is nihilism to actually believe humanity's time on Earth, and our effects upon it, are no more or less equal to any other organisms."

This isn't Star Trek, a warp drive is still far from possible. What's the point of spending many decades making painfully slow progress on space travel and habitats for everyone when we could just wait another century until we have much better tech and then worry about leaving Earth? It's better to develop force fields or something against any conceivable threat, don't you think? Better for all life here too.

I want to cut off ties with China. I want to fine companies polluting so much that they struggle to exist anymore, and arrest the heads of companies who spread anti-reality propaganda with the express purpose of ending the world for profit. I want the end of the meat industry, humans can be 100% healthy while being 100% vegan at every stage of life, and it's not even expensive to do so deliciously. I want the government to drop support for fossil fuel cars and power plants and establish solar plants and fund electric cars. 

We can't do any of this overnight. But we can start the long transition now, and maybe we'll be finished in time  These changes are all ludicrously radical and won't happen, but they're necessary. Because, and I cannot stress this enough despite you not believing it, the world as we know it is ending. (These changes would all be positive changes regardless)."
SirDinkus,fdhi2ju,t1_fdhfgtr,"It's not sci-fi to colonize at least this solar system. The point I'm trying to impose is that we may not even have 100 years. A plague could pop up and off all of us within a few years. Yellowstone could blow at any time and throw the planet into near darkness for decades if not centuries.

You seem to think the priority is to constantly develope solutions to the insecurities and threats this planet constantly imposes upon us, instead of developing solutions that get us away from them permanently.

We've got all our eggs in this one basket, and instead of trying our hardest to spread them out as fast as possible, we instead want to spend many trillions of dollars keeping our one basket from falling apart. Most Astrophysicists agree, Earth isn't really that special. We've got the means to leave already. We just need to fund it and make it a higher priority.

A thought that helps me often through those dark times is remembering that things just are, they aren't necessarily bad or good, they just are, and if things with your SO aren't working, well, perhaps it's best for both to go your separate ways.

unicorn_345,fecnszx,t1_fecnmxr,I have a thing for noise when I sleep. Some tv shows and movies are easy to sleep to. Others are a big fat no. Maybe I’ll try Bob Ross for sleep. Obviously worked for the adhd one. Might work for me.

TrepanationBy45,feb5dn2,t3_eo7w89,"In one of my classes, we did a kindness project where we'd write down encouraging words and give them to people around campus. You had to have enough to give to 25 people - it could be notecards, folded cards, some people printed and taped them to snacks to hand out, so on and so forth. Don't overthink it, just give someone kind words that they can keep.

A Chinese exchange student gave me a granola bar with the words, *""your wounds are where the light enters""* on it.

I was having a tough time then, and still am, but I kept that damn granola bar. It's purposefully in my car, and everytime I see it, I read it, and it helps me get a little soft reset for the moment."

My dad was trying to do research and thought Bob Ross was something new and then found out he died and didn't understand why I was into a guy that died so long ago.

Also he couldn't find a paint set so he got me a talking bobblehead of him instead.   It's adorable."

_DepressedSunflower_,fdhoy6f,t1_fdhosif,Right?!
_DepressedSunflower_,fdhz9bl,t1_fdhya9h,"I only see him about once a month, so we can't really do that."
_DepressedSunflower_,fdini5d,t1_fdi7h2j,Someone will come along eventually. You've got time.
_DepressedSunflower_,fdi20ss,t1_fdhznqz,"We met in college and I knew I was smitten when I would leave his dorm room and when I would get back to my room, I would realize my shirt now smelled a little bit like him and it made me super happy. This was at the very beginning of the relationship too. I was absolutely in love and I wouldn't have it any other way."
Oookulele,fdic21s,t1_fdhznqz,"Actually I tell my boyfriend that he smells nice like three times on average each time we see each other and we live in the same city. Even so, I purposefully curl up on the place in bed that smells most like him when I sleep alone these days."
elderberryink,fdixy0y,t1_fdhznqz,Idk why but my brain decided to parse LDR as left 4 dead redemption
_DepressedSunflower_,fdinnwy,t1_fdigwmq,"I don't wear scarves enough to do that, but that is a good idea. I love the way his cologne smells, mostly because I associate it with him."
_DepressedSunflower_,fdinkip,t1_fdif41n,"I've thought about it, or spraying a stuffed animal so it will get locked in the stuffing."
ChilaG,fdi4h16,t1_fdhz9bl,"I feel you so hard! My solution was to always steal another shirt. Like give the one back my SO gave me on our previous meeting and take a new one he had already worn a few times with me. For me it's not about the shirt but only smell so I don't really care what piece of clothing it is lol. (I'm also not a fan of his cologne but of his natural smell so it wouldn't work for me anyway,  but we all have our little tricks, ain't we? :p)"

morningbryd,fdhmnm0,t1_fdhltfe,"It could significantly increase your chances by purchasing one. It must be fuzzy on the inside though, apparently."
Oookulele,fdic9jy,t1_fdhltfe,"Nah. I'm wearing my bf's t-shirt as I'm typing this and it's very nice, too. Key is that it smells like bae and is kinda oversized."
OG_Boggs,fdiajii,t1_fdhltfe,"If that is how you get a girlfriend, then I'd never be single as I have plenty of hoodies. Actually thinking on that a little more, no amount of hoodies could work that miracle."

Smallslimysnail,fdhqp3n,t3_elg1n4,Steal the second one. Give back the first to make it smell like him again. Never-ending cycle of literally the. Best. Hoodie.
Wuinx,fdii126,t1_fdhqp3n,My girlfriend has had my pink hoodie for two months and she was supposed to bring it back to exchange it for another one. she didnt give it back and I really want my pink hoodie back :((

KamIsan55,fdi5uuf,t3_elg1n4,I'm wearing his right now. I've been wearing it almost nonstop. Only taken it off to hide it from my parents so they don't get suspicious that I'm gay :p

JettyMaree,fdi2eed,t3_elg1n4,Ha! Every time I buy my teenage son a new hoodie I have to say “don’t give this one to your girlfriend “. But eventually she wears it. It is cute.
tenorsaxhero,fdi9bdw,t3_elg1n4,I cuddle with one of my girlfriends sweaters and I can smell it and it puts me right to sleep real quickly. God I love her.
vastowen,fdibvln,t1_fdi9bdw,"Hah! I have my ex's oversized sweater, but it's a bit too small for me. So I'm working out to lose a bit of mass so I can wear it comfortably. (among other reasons.. That one will be the HUZZAH moment though.)

LAANAAAAAA,fdhp6k5,t1_fdhp2iw,Just get in there with her lol
ElineFabianne,fdi50om,t3_elg1n4,I don't entirely get the hoodie stealing. Do you just take it? Just go into their closet and get a piece of their clothing and take it home without feeling guilty or them getting mad at you?
ZukusCatHeaven_Art,fdi6jk0,t1_fdi50om,"What happens is that they typically say they’re cold when it gets a little chilly so you say “oh okay here, you can wear my hoodie,” or sweater, jacket etc.

But then later you forget about it and they never give it back to you.

*never*"
LAANAAAAAA,fdibsom,t1_fdi50om,"Lol no. It's usually you're out and get cold and he hands it over. When you get home you kinda forget you're wearing it until they're gone, then it becomes a cuddle reminder"

joeret,fe7z4zs,t1_fe6ropd,"You’re right. While there is definitely a hardship for the wife for having to literally make a human and then push it out of their bodies. 

This shouldn’t take away from the spouses role. While it may not be physically taxing there is an enormous amount of mental stress involved in the entire process. 

Once the labor is over the mother is in recovery mode the spouse assumes all responsibility for the family unit which can be a daunting task depending on the family situation.  Lack of sleep, having to juggle work, household, and recovering wife is a lot for one person to take on. 

While the wife has to handle the physical side the spouse has to handle the mental side. 

Not saying the spouse is more difficult than the wife but it’s hardly The Rock in cool sunglasses."
z_formation,fe8zpow,t1_fe7z4zs,"The mother has a lot of mental stuff to consider too, like figuring out breastfeeding. After I gave birth the mental part of it was much worse than the physical, because you are worried about everything. It’s not like I got to lay there and recover- it was like running a mental, emotional and physical marathon after I just finished another one. 

Not diminishing the partner’s contribution, but the person giving birth still typically ends up doing the lion’s share of the work, and that can’t be denied. Most of this depends on whether she is breastfeeding or not tbh."

He was so stressed about my mom’s labour that he forgot to eat for the entire day (and tbh he had every right to be stressed. I’m honestly surprised my mom went through 5 birth considering the first two went horribly. The plasenta ruptured when I was born and my mom almost bled out and died (along with me). And my first brother was born with a rare very deadly heart defect. He was lucky to live)"

I_own_reddit_AMA,fe4yzgj,t1_fe4opk1,"No. It’s based off the story posted that the female bird form your picture got plucked too much from other birds and can’t grow feathers anymore, but the male bird has bonded with her regardless."

altariasong,fe5y2h9,t1_fe5x22h,"I’m afraid this is the wrong place to ask. I do know a bit about bird behavior though. You may want to have the red neck hen looked at by a vet. She may be sick and hiding it, cause birds and other prey animals are really good at that. But she can’t hide it from her fellow hens. 

The other answer is that the hens just don’t like her. Regardless  you should keep a close eye on them all. Hens are known to bully and peck ostracized members to death."

Majinphu455,fe5coe6,t1_fe43xet,Teachers are underpaid and underappreciated. They're pressured to have kids score hugh in test and they have to buy school supplies themselves if they need it. Many teachers have another job on the side.
rblaze09,fe5l0ed,t1_fe43xet,"Private and Public schools very throughout the US. Some are great, some are bad. Some allocate more money for printing quality, others spend it on their library, or physical education. One thing is for certain though, teachers need more money and training.

Markantonpeterson,fdkil5o,t1_fdjly7g,"Just wanna add on to the pile of replies here that I was a fat awkward kid growing up and I had next to zero confidence about my physical appearance. Feeling poorly about how I looked was a huge part of every day for 7th grade me. Randomly one day in the hall I was talking with friends and a girl just kinda casually mentioned I had really nice eyes. It wasn't flirtacious or anything just felt like.. her honest observation. It's the type of thing that I not only STILL think about when i'm feeling down about me, and this is 10+ years later, but at the time it was the first compliment I had ever recieved from a non-family member. I was 12 just getting one compliment gave me something to fight back against that part of me that felt worthless. Ugh, probably better for a therapist lmao but compliments are so small and they really can mean SO much to people."

Experiment with types of buns, tight twisty buns leave better curls, and a bun held by a clip instead of a tie will be less likely to leave crimps 

I’m a girl but I don’t like to use product or heat to get waves, so this is what I like to do!"

IBlobs,fdjnvb1,t1_fdjdpil,Lol
kalimoo,fdje6pg,t3_elmvg2,I compliment girls all the time but don’t really think to compliment boys because I’m always scared they’ll think I’m flirting and will end up being creepy. But that’s no reason to not make normal guys feel good about themselves. I’m gonna try complimenting more boys until one follows me home
Declorobine,fdjh2h1,t1_fdje6pg,"The sad thing is the reason some guys develop feelings for girls who are nice to them is because we don’t get complimented much and see that as a sign of attraction. And then there are people that do get flirted with but are afraid that the girl is just being nice and has no other feelings towards them. It’s a vicious cycle, really."
IBlobs,fdjntw6,t1_fdje6pg,"Lol im the exact opposite, especially with how homophobic my school is, i would rather compliment the opposite sex then the same and proceed to be shamed."

Tarotdragoon,fdjk1pm,t1_fdjh2h1,"Men are so starved for attention that they act out negatively in order to get it. Or are just so grateful for any they get.

Women are so lavished with unwanted attention that they hate it and want it to stop. Or they become arrogant and expect it. 

Both are negative developmental situations that can drive people to react unhealthily.

Compliment your guy friends, compliment (no catcall) your girl friends, and if they fall somewhere else on the spectrum ask them how they feel about compliments then if good, compliment the shit out of them."
Ulanyouknow,fdjkdut,t1_fdjh2h1,"Happens to me pretty much every time. It is very hard for me to try not to confuse those warm giddy feelings for something else. As it happens to me I don't see it as ""this girl may like me"" but as in ""Why do I feel so warm and fuzzy when I look at her?""

Its normal, and natural, we all like to be complimented. I am so so starved for this kind of positive attention that getting some makes me feel incredibly special."

Ulanyouknow,fdjq69r,t1_fdjltj7,"> I remember just last year when someone laid their hand on top of mine as a joke 

That must have felt amazing right?? 

&#x200B;

I kinda don't know how to feel about all this stuff, if positive or negative. On one side is kinda infantile to catch feelings for the first person that throws token appreciation at you.

On the other side, wanting to feel love and warmth and appreciation is natural and human and it feels good, so it's only normal that I want more of it. I certainly won't get angry at my brain for giving me some of those feel good chemicals that we all crave."

I'm a motherly sort in my 40s and he was much younger, and honestly since my sons keep getting terrible haircuts I've taken to scrutinizing men's haircuts to see what makes them good. I think he took it ok, but I was mortified that I might have made him uncomfortable, which apparently made him feel the need to to reassure me I hadn't. It was like nonsense out of a sitcom."

Not on appearance, personality, not even on a simple thing like a new bag. Not even a ""cool shoes!"" or ""nice shirt!"" 

I regret wasting my short, but shitty life away. I have lived like an asshole, now that I think of it. Even now, I am surely ruining *someone's* mood,  when they just wanted a wholesome, happy experience. But that's the only way I know how to act. 

I deserve to be alone. I deserve this. This might be my last month. Now I understand why everyone distances themselves from me. The only  contribution I can do at this point, is ridding myself.

What a pathetic excuse of a being I am, and what a wasteful life I've led."

glory_of_dawn,fdjyral,t3_elmvg2,"So here's a weird thing -- this exact compliment has ruined my self confidence and really harmed my ability to trust people who give it. 

When I was in high school, I dated a girl who was absolutely fucking insane, but really good at hiding it. She put me through all sorts of mental abuse and I never even fuckin' noticed because I thought I knew what abuse looked like due to some previous experiences. 

She always told me that my eyes were pretty. She'd complement other parts of my appearance as well, but she always focused on my eyes. 

Well, three and a half years later, my family finally gets it through my skull that she's the literal worst thing for me, thanks in no small part to her trying to solidify her control over me and it backfiring spectacularly. I break up with her and she throws everything in the book at me, including that she's pregnant. She obviously was not. Get past all that, whatever, life goes on. 

When I started dating my wife, she gave me this compliment, and I had an immediate and visceral reaction to it. My first thought was that she was lying to me. Then I started to wonder what else she'd been lying to me about. I can't have been that attractive. My friends told me for years that I wasn't, and they're obviously right, the only two people who ever said otherwise were fucking psychotic (also an ex). My mind immediately spiraled into a despairing mess of scenarios about how our relationship was going to end and that she wasn't how she said she was. 

Because she complimented my *eyes.*

To make this entirely clear, while we hadn't been dating for more than a few months at that point, I'd known my wife for almost a decade. And one sincere complement completely circumvented everything I knew about her. 

I had to tell her that that compliment was off limits. She accidentally said it again last week and I immediately shut down socially. 

How fucking weird is that?"

The comic is like 99% wholesome (he does flip his children off behind their backs sometimes) and pretty progressive so this is just an unfortunate choice of words.

SovOuster,fdxrcdo,t1_fdxmlcv,"That's a good point. But since it's apparently a one room basement apartment (bottom of the stairs), no dishwasher and an antique bag vac I'm going to say he works two jobs and she's just returning from a 10hr shift herself. So normally he's only home about 6hrs to sleep"
thelibrariangirl,fdxub8e,t1_fdxmlcv,"My husband does all the shopping, cooking, repairs, and outdoor stuff like snowblowing or mowing. He also takes care of our children just about as much as I do (its not even since he works 24hrs at a time)! :)"
HollisTaakitz420,fdy32uf,t1_fdxrcdo,the fiction people are weaving to try to undermine the joke that this is similar to 50s roles is funnier than the original goof
spectralvixen,fdzzr9b,t1_fdxrcdo,I interpreted it as her coming downstairs after sleeping in or taking a nap or similar on the weekend.
HollisTaakitz420,fdy2w7e,t1_fdxub8e,"yea I know a few men who are stay at home husbands. Things are changing. 

My dad used to yell at my mom if she didnt have dinner on the table, but she worked more hours and made more money. Most of the chores were done by the girls. So different people are different and a lot of households have sexism. 

The joke is based on the fact that these are all chores that typically used to be for women, and men didnt used to do many chores, so it seems old fashioned when there is no context of him having any chores we know about"
HollisTaakitz420,fe01210,t1_fe00n8v,"again, I have been living independently for almost 20 years. If doing dishes AND laundry AND wiping a counter is a special treat, usually put all on one people, you arent doing your chores fairly

the joke is that a daily things like dishes are typically shared evenly in modern times, and a husband considering them female chores is like the 1950s

honestly at this point all the butthurt feels like sexist people who maybe dont really do enough of their share at home"
HollisTaakitz420,fdyn9b7,t1_fdyn088,he’s literally the one at home with the kid and she’s the one coming home
SovOuster,fdyfd3i,t1_fdy32uf,"Honestly I noticed it too though. The sensitivity is sending the message that doing someone's chores ""one time"" is such a nice gesture when really they're overburdened by the unfair division the rest of the time.

That's a real thing people put up with so I think the comic is just unfortunately vague.

But obviously it was intended to not be that."
thelibrariangirl,fdyg9j3,t1_fdy2w7e,"Yeah I got it, just saying there ARE other chores, that’s all."
spectralvixen,fe01rsn,t1_fdy2w7e,"In the context of the comic, the “punchline” is actually a wholesome one about him teaching his child by example how to be a kind and considerate partner (and person in general). Maybe the author took for granted that his audience skews progressive and would NOT see the chores presented as “women’s”. I don’t think they are the joke at all.

(Also joke seems like a strong word, some comics are just for making you smile, not laugh. See sub title.)"
notmadeofstraw,fdzyxc0,t1_fdyn9b7,"yeah day off for him, day out at the mothers for her.

ez"
HollisTaakitz420,fdyixvr,t1_fdyfd3i,"also, no one is pointing out that she seemingly takes it for granted that he is in charge of child care (which again makes it weird he wouldnt just be cleaning like that normally bc SAHDs tend to)"
HollisTaakitz420,fdyisp9,t1_fdyfd3i,"honestly, all that would have to change imo would be her instead of calling it her chores saying “wow it’s so clean in here!” instead. It’s definitely good to compliment people who do tend to typically do it, and its realistic to think that both parents dont always keep up with everything so Dad going beast mode is special but not necessarily gendered or anything"
HollisTaakitz420,fdyicg3,t1_fdyg9j3,"Ive been living on my own for like 20 years I know. Because I know, I know that certain chores should kinda be seen as something everyone covers when they see it needs doing"

Certifiedpoocleaner,fdz6l68,t1_fdwicpe,"My boyfriend and I decide up the chores. Mine are typically laundry, and general cleaning/tidying of the house, his are cleaning the kitchen, dishes, and all the cooking.

sourpickles0,fdxe1ou,t1_fdwicpe,Excuse me?
_bio_,fdy3trf,t1_fdwicpe,I'm pretty sure it's supposed to mean that they split the chores so the husband did his chores and did hers as well.
luciegarciap,fdx7uls,t1_fdx6llc,"That's why she says ""my"" chores. What I understood is they divide chores and it was her turn to do the dishes and vacuum. So the nice gesture was they did it anyway, even though those weren't *their* chores to do. Their chores were probably taking out the trash, shoveling snow or whatever, something else."
FunGryphon,fdx82st,t1_fdx6llc,"I mean, it’s not like this is uncommon? Plus the hiding and watching the reaction of the mother without telling her they did the chores means they just wanted the reaction. Even today I live in a household where my mom is at home and my dad works. There’s no shame in doing the chores and getting praised. On top of that, that age group grew up in a time where mostly women did the housework.

I think it’s wholesome bc he’s teaching his kid about why we do work and chores. Like I said, for the father it was never about the praise, it was the reaction.

TLDR; Just enjoy it"
Entrefut,fdxjckd,t1_fdx7uls,Yeah but that would be a sensible and wholesome way to look at a comic. I’d rather try to find something oppressive about it and totally miss the point. /s
HollisTaakitz420,fdxmw72,t1_fdx7uls,"but besides trash, those chores are all the normal daily chores that if you leave to only one person, there isnt much left to do. 

Stuff like shoveling is rare. 

That’s exactly why all of these are traditionally women’s chores, bc men were supposed to work more outside the home and get to mostly relax at home. It just doesnt work as well today, and not everyone has adjusted."
Ensvey,fdyax30,t1_fdxjckd,"Seriously. If someone wants to try to poke holes in the message of a comic, they should look somewhere besides lunarbaboon. He's like the most wholesome comic artist out there."
thelibrariangirl,fdxv494,t1_fdxmw72,"I find this hilarious because I feel like a lot of these commenters can’t imagine more chores because they themselves don’t do any. Lol.

Maybe this man here just paid bills, balanced the checkbook, did the grocery store run, cooked a meal, walked the dog, repaired the cabinet in the kitchen, all while watching his son, THEN did these tasks."
HollisTaakitz420,fdy1wlh,t1_fdxv494,"Ive lived independently for 20 years. Do YOU do chores? 

Youre talking again about mostly random stuff that isnt daily like repairs lol, or that isnt shown here, like a meal or a dog. 

Im talking about this; wiping down a counter or doing some dishes is a daily chore and isnt a special treat and has typically been left to women and taken for granted as women’s work so **that is why people are making jokes about it being old-fashioned**.

irl, even if chores were divided 50/50, a good humored man would probably be able to make that joke *himself* about how they had divided them and how it looks. 

but, like, if she took out the dog they dont have would that deserve praise? Not really, a thanks is nice but she could thank him for doing it daily and vice versa.

**the value of the comic is in teaching a kid that a clean home makes people happy**

it just could have been executed better, so people had jokes, **its no big deal really lol** it’s all in good humor."
thelibrariangirl,fdy3ig2,t1_fdy1wlh,"I feel like you completely misread my comment? Of course his chores aren’t shown in the comic, that’s the point. That’s where the two camps of people lie: those who think he must not do any, and those who know there are a million and one other chores that could have been “his”. 

Some people are kidding about him being a lazy no-good, and some people are not. Regardless of that, my point was only that there are a ton of other daily chores to do than what is shown. There are people acting like these are the only daily chores that exist, and that is false. My only point.

And yeah no argument from me on the value of the comic, no idea why you bolded that."
thelibrariangirl,fdygx38,t1_fdy46k4,"I never said it wasn’t initially a joke or was butthurt. You have seriously misread this situation. I did not downvote you, by the way, you’re just trying to explain yourself. I’m just saying you’re arguing against... not me..."
HollisTaakitz420,fdyhzfg,t1_fdygx38,"I think maybe you don’t understand how it came across to me but if you didnt mean it like that, ok

chloelizaw,fdy41qk,t3_en7suh,"Oh boy, I have a story about a former friend of mine. I don't care all that much about her identity, so we're just gonna call her by her real name: *Karyssa.* 

Karyssa came over one afternoon to hang out and help me dye my hair. As my hair dye is processing, and we're chatting in the kitchen, I bring out a basket of clean laundry and start folding it. 

Karyssa immediately stops me and goes, ""Why are you folding *your boyfriend's* clothes like a house wife? I think every couple should split all chores 50/50."" 

I was a little baffled and began to try and explain. 

1. I am disabled, and don't work. My boyfriend works long days at his job, with not a lot of guaranteed time off. No, I don't do every chore in the apartment. He doesn't like folding laundry, where as I don't mind it. I don't like doing dishes, and he's all for it. 

2. Even if I *was* doing all the chores, I wouldn't mind. Because I love him, and I know it makes his life happier and easier for me to get this done.

3. I can't imagine how rude it would be for him to get home and me to be like, ""I washed exactly half of the dishes, only folded my clothes and scrubbed down exactly 1/2 of the toilet. Enjoy."" 

I explained this all to her in a state of genuine confusion as to why she was acting so hostile towards me. At the end of my response, Karyssa asked if I was good to wash the dye out of my hair on my own and walked out. 

We weren't friends for much longer after that."

HoneysuckleHeinie,fdm29ah,t1_fdluqnm,"Yeah, it’s extremely similar to a Blue Chair comic. And Blue Chair has comics featuring Cthulhu dating back to at least [March 7, 2016](https://www.webtoons.com/en/comedy/bluechair/ep-180-unforeseen-horrors/viewer?title_no=199&episode_no=252)"

Giraffelord777,fdm51n6,t1_fdm2dka,"I believe it's similar to one of Shens or ""Owl Turds"" Blue Chair comic, but I think the punchline was different? Either way, I always love this type of wholesomeness and I really like your art style."
kabojjin,fdmhnta,t1_fdm2dka,"Stolen is obviously a very harsh word but it is very similar to Shens comic where someone summons Cthulu to ask it how to talk to girls. Even the panels are very similar.

Call_The_Banners,fdmja2j,t1_fdmiwb7,"There's actually a third comic where a girl gets the help of Cthulhu when she's being berated by a crowd. The artist seems to have a few of these stories. I'll need to locate the name. 

It seems to be a trend right now. Which is GOOD. It means you're not alone in trying to make someone smile today."
kaitrbl,fdn0irl,t1_fdmiwb7,"no one thinks you’re a thief, at least i don’t, it’s just the fact you’re acting as if you’ve never seen shen’s comic before when yours is eerily similar to a formula with the same character he’s used in the past. 

there’s nothing wrong with saying you were inspired by him, doesn’t make the comic any less nice/wholesome."
bonus_duk,fdm8oms,t3_em0yhp,"This concept. It's not new. There's a comic in which a guy asks Cthulhu how to to talk to his crush or something, and Cthulhu helps him. Idk if you just got inspired by it or it's just a big coincidence. Either way nice comic."
Abigaylord,fdmqgul,t1_fdm8oms,"You’re thinking of Shen Comix. His very first comic about Cthulhu is him opening a Jar, if I’m correct. 

This artist must have been inspired by him a lot, as there is a “cure my sadness” comic by Shen too, but with Godzilla.

copybookpizza,fdo33xt,t1_fdntz3s,I had no idea! You learn something new everyday :)
lazespud2,fdoohyl,t1_fdntz3s,"Another fun fact; you will essentially never ever ever come across a Sphinx cat at a shelter (source, I ran the world's largest cat adoption org and sanctuary and have helped adopt out somewhere around 25,000 cats).

The reasons? First, they are very uncommon. Second, people with exotic cats tend to be part of breed affinity groups and invariably they work with these groups first if and when they need to place a cat (which also tends to be rare). They also generally never let their kitties breed with cats of a different breed.

I mean you will probably find Sphinx cats at some shelter somewhere for a brief time (cue the comments from people who tell us they got a sphinx cat at their local shelter and have seen literally thousands spilling out of the cages); but it's basically astonishingly rare."

Most people actually aren’t allergic to the fur, they are allergic to dander! dander is a protein present in the saliva, urine and skin of animals and is often transferred via fur. “Hypoallergenic” breeds of cats and dogs that produce or shed less (ie, dogs that don’t shed) dander, but they still produce it. So for those with the severe allergies getting a pet, even a hypoallergenic one will mean baths for kitty, air purifiers and being on allergy medication. Just saying this because I think there’s a lot of confusion around this and I’ve met people who are allergic to their hypoallergenic pets and either suffer or have to give them up! :("

chaoticidealism,fdoe4bd,t1_fdo6ap5,"Rare in shelters, but not unheard-of.

If you want to adopt a purebred, your best bet is to look for a rescue that specializes in them. They'll have nothing but Sphynx cats, or maybe Sphynx and Rex cats. These rescues will go around to general shelters and pull the cats that fit into their breed, and then advertise for lovers of that particular breed to adopt. It helps take pressure off the general shelters. (There are also rescues for special-needs cats, pregnant queens, feral cats, and older cats; it's not just breed-specific ones. If you're looking for a particular type of cat there is often a rescue that specializes in them.)"

ferrettimee,fdoq0x3,t3_emcha3,It’s rare to find a non common purebred cat in a shelter especially Sphinx cats as they are worth a few grand and getting rid of it instead of selling it is just not a good idea. The most unique cat I ever saw during my stint at the spca was an Siamese/shorthair mix.

Uglarinn,fdpgcwh,t3_emcha3,"I wanted to share my own personal story about this, in the interest of keeping things wholesome! My wife and I adopted our girl, Lily, from a foster home. When we were first interested in her, she was heavily marked down, older than the other cats (2 years old, she's 3 now) and she had been back and forth between the foster home and the petsmart adoption center about 9 times (which was nerve wracking for her and heartbreaking for the foster lady we affectionately call Grandma now.). As soon as we heard that, we immediately said she was the one for us. Despite the Foster lady's hesitation (she had been adopted before, but was sent back because she was ""too difficult to deal with"" somehow), we eventually adopted her and she has been with our family for over a year now!"

jeriho,fe4de2z,t3_enntcr,"I had a conversation with a rich girl not long time ago. She was extremely focus on wealth, although she repeatedly emphasized that she don't care about wealth. I told her that my main aim is life is to be happy, having friends, family, etc. not so much if I get rich or not. She could not comprehend it, for her any happiness was directly tied to money, for example, if you want to have good friends, they have to be rich also, if you want to have a good time, you have to be rich in order to enjoy life (by enjoy life she meant actually to enjoy luxury). I felt like she doesn't understand the most basic human needs, like company and friendship, instead she substitute it with luxury. She was also full of contradictions, she told me on the one hand that she wishes her dad wouldn't have work so much when she was a child and be more around, but at the same time she told me that one has to work hard and a lot in life (in order to have money, so that you can enjoy life). She was intelligent, but when it came to certain topics she was close minded, like brainwashed. Also, she seemed rather lonely and was very hard on herself, unfortunately, she was equivalent hard on anyone that became close to her...

icraigun,fdx0qw6,t3_en6vzm,"You shouldn’t give excuses, especially if they give you solutions. It means that they really want to spend time with you and will come up with ideas to see you. Imagine how you’d feel if someone you were friends with kept coming up with excuses to avoid spending time together"
jentlefolk,fdxv2ou,t1_fdx0qw6,"Just because they want to spend time with me doesn't mean I *have* to drop everything to go hang out with them.

I massively value my best friend. She's a fantastic person. Unfortunately she often wants to hang out more than I'm able to, either because of the distance I'd have to travel, lack of funds, or simply because I'm stressed and need to be home. It's not about her if I choose not to go out, and I do my best to make that clear.

It's rough trying to balance the needs of an extrovert friend with the needs of an introvert friend, but some friendships are worth the effort."
Lurka_Doncic,fdyawlh,t1_fdx0qw6,"I agree that you should be honest with your friends and not give excuses.  If you're not up for a night out or whatever, you should be up front about it and not lie.

That said, many people who are more extroverted may not totally understand that, and it could be off putting.  So people come up with excuses to compensate and spare their friend's feelings.  Continuing to offer solutions to their excuses is almost just as (if not more) rude, because you're refusing to give them the simple out they want, or maybe even need in that moment, just compounding whatever social anxiety they were already feeling.  In that case it's more or less a covert form of peer pressure.

Additionally, they may genuinely not want to hang out, period.  Coming up with white lies or excuses is more socially acceptable than just telling someone to fuck off, for better or worse.  If someone continues to give you excuses as to why they can't hang out, take the hint and move on with your life.  You shouldn't prioritize someone who does not prioritize you."
allinighshoe,fdy8mxs,t1_fdx0qw6,I think this meme applys to people with anxiety/depression. It definitely resonated with me. Sometimes you just can't do it. But you don't want to say I don't want to outright.
chewupthenswallow,fdw7knq,t3_en6vzm,"It says a lot about the quality of a friendship if you can just tell them that you simply don't want to spend time with them or do that thing and your friend never makes you feel guilty about it.
If people want to spend time with you, they will. Don't try to force them. Don't lie about it either.."

T2For1Special,fdwtgik,t3_en6vzm,It is important to understand everyone is different. We all respond to different situations differently. Going out causes some of us stress and anxiety. Sometimes we need friends to urge us to go out and sometimes we need friends to understand when we need our space.
TheRiseAndFallOfB,fdxkk87,t1_fdwtgik,I feel like theres a difference between not wanting to go because it gives you anxiety and not wanting to go simply because you want to play video games at home
T2For1Special,fdxye23,t1_fdxkk87,"There is a difference, you are correct."
Lurka_Doncic,fdybwna,t1_fdxkk87,"Maybe there's a difference but should that matter?  Everyone had different wants/needs, and they may not always align with other's wants/needs.  You don't owe it to anyone to go out and be social if you don't want to be.  You may lose your friends if it becomes a consistent refrain, but a little alone time with video games may be exactly what someone needs on a given night."
TheRiseAndFallOfB,fdy94y1,t1_fdxye23,"What I mean is that being lazy and not wanting to go out should be looked down upon and the people who are lazy and dont go out shouldnt use anxiety as an excuse. However, I am not saying that people who actually have anxiety cant use it as a answer when asked why they dont like being in public spaces."

Wife Googled it and was able to report back that the part I'd figured out about doing it quickly meant _really_ quickly, as in using the bike, which I didn't have yet. I'd solved it perfectly, and just needed to come back later!

God only knows how much more time I'd have wasted and how frustrated I'd have been without that simple help."

I will admit that there has been a few times I looked something up for her and it has ended up spoiling a few things in the game for me, but she's worth it. I prefer her to be happy while gaming, so I'm willing to make that sacrifice, happily.

SelirKiith,fdxl24i,t1_fdxjjgs,"Well, Experience taught me so...

Sure, not ever single instance was totally bad but I would guess 75-90% of changes are clear downwards going.

Even the worst experiences often lead to something better, so long as you let them. Whether it’s a lesson learned, or an experience that causes you to be more compassionate, or something that forces you out of a bad habit...change can nearly always lead to improvement."

We have a very short amount of time on Earth and spending that time loathing our current state and not continuously reaching for what you love is the wrong way to live.

This isn't about trying to spin bad things into good things. I agree that something like cancer or losing a stable job are objectively bad for your life and often have no silver lining, as you've said. But my point was about *accepting* the bad things. Accepting the change that they bring and still choosing to focus on the good in your life. That takes courage and isn't easy to do, but in the end that is what the comic is portraying. Someone who longs for times when things were better and isn't focusing on the present."

sunfl0wers0ur,fdxjgdk,t3_en8zia,I hate that some women feel they have to disclose that they aren’t wearing make up or apologize for it when they’re going to meet up with someone. It’s literally sad and I’m glad I broke out of make up culture.
mosieray,fdy7rv9,t1_fdxjgdk,"I wouldn't go anywhere without a full face when I was younger, now I put a bit of mascara on to hide my pissed in snow holes. Since I met my partner and he didn't care about things like that I only put a face on for occasions now"
Lazy_Cana,fdyc0zv,t1_fdxjgdk,I decided at a young age that I wouldn't wear makeup because I knew how men reacted when they saw a woman without any. That and my mom always has a full face of makeup and at night when she takes it off its like a whole other person. I'd rather a person get used to seeing my natural face than a face of makeup
AJandUkubaby,fdygcv4,t1_fdxjgdk,"high schooler here, i'm too far into makeup land to turn back now. my look according to my friends has become synonymous with the amount of eyeliner i wear, and im too self conscious to go out without at least mascara and coverup. but to be honest, i don't mind it! i love how i look with makeup, and i wear it more for me than anyone else :)

edit: noticed a grammar error damn you to vs too"
gradstudent1234,fdyxgr4,t1_fdxjgdk,it's sad makeup was like that for you. but some ppl enjoy it and they shouldn't be put down for it

ObtuseSage,fdyfduu,t3_en8zia,"Yeah... The effect of the meme is a bit awkward. 

It seems like it's implying that she would indeed look like crap without getting all dolled up. Or at least that she'd look like SpongeBob with a wig?"
ZukusCatHeaven_Art,fe01bkq,t1_fdz57vl,No it says “her” in the post before SpongeBob. xD
TheCapitalKing,fe1z0i1,t1_fe01bkq,Yeah she makes a face like that. He looks kinda nervous like a girl do you still think I look cute with no makeup on. Or that's how I read it I could be giving it way to much benefit of the doubt
KThomas316,fdxrhqf,t3_en8zia,"I don't know what you're trying to imply, but she looks beautiful"
yeetedgurl_,fdxkzhk,t3_en8zia,This shit be hittin different
RombieZombie25,fdxdrbf,t3_en8zia,this is me but like actually genuinely i find her the most attractive in this state. some eye makeup can go a long way for sure but beyond that i think makeup distracts from natural beauty. and don’t nobody give me that “girls are often wearing makeup without you realizing it” because i’m talking about my long-term girlfriend and i know when she’s in no makeup/naked makeup/full makeup. she looks her best with none or little. and i feel this about pretty much everyone and any makeup look. natural beauty always wins out for me.
oringedoorhinge,fdxzen2,t1_fdxdrbf,This works with genuinely attractive people. People who aren't attractive can make themselves look much more presentable with some make-up. That's just the truth.
flower_child411,fdy7mk6,t1_fdxdrbf,"While this is true for a lot of dudes, just keep in mind that some/most girls really just wear makeup to boost their their own confidence"
Chrisdecalis,fdy4nd4,t1_fdxzen2,"I like to look at it this way.

On the first few dates you find her attractive because that's what it's supposed to do. She will look stunning. But over time you start to become attracted to her as a person and make-up sort of hides that attractiveness that makes her special to you. That's why we keep saying; ""You don't need make-up!"" 


But y'know, I'm juste a dude."
RombieZombie25,fdyd673,t1_fdy7mk6,oh i know. and i understand that about my girlfriend too. if she wears a full face of makeup when we go out i don’t tell her she shouldn’t have because now i find her less attractive. i tell her she looks beautiful just like any other time. it’s more about them and their confidence 100%.

Do you think you could tear another animal's throat out with our shitty human teeth?

Humans are omnivores, not obligate carnivores. We don't need meat to survive. We're not cavemen any more, we can make a conscious ethical decision about what (and who) we eat.

This appeal to physiology is so weak it makes me want to take a b12 supplement."

To look at our physiology as evidence for needing meat is so profoundly ridiculous. 

Whether you eat meat or not at this point is an ethical consideration, not a physiological one. 

Humans do not *need* meat to survive, that is fact. The point you should be arguing is if humans *should* eat meat."

KlitzYT,fdoxjjo,t3_emfb0l,Why do people only care about koalas?
e_nathan,fdq1m52,t3_emfb0l,"**Around 480 million - 1 billion animals are feared to have died in Australia’s bushfires, including nearly a third of the koalas in New South Wales's main habitat.**

These catastrophic megafires are worsening the extinction crisis we’re already facing.

Here is some general advice for helping wildlife during bushfires:

1. **Take domestic animals with you if you evacuate** or keep cats indoors and dogs under control wherever possible so that wildlife can flee safely through your yard if needed.
2. **Leave out bowls of water for animals fleeing the fires**, use shallow bowls with a few sticks or stones on one side to allow smaller animals to escape if they fall in.
3. **Keep a cardboard box and towel in the boot of your car** in case you find an injured animal that you can safely contain without putting yourself in any danger.
4. **If you rescue an animal that has been burnt, do NOT attempt to feed it; wrap it loosely, ideally in 100% cotton fabric, place it in a ventilated box with a lid and keep it in a dark, quiet place whilst waiting for a rescuer or for transport to the nearest vet.**
5. **If you can safely take injured animals to your nearest vet do so**, as injured animals will require urgent vet assessment. If you can also contact your local wildlife rescue service or WIRES: 1300 094 737
6. **Do not approach injured snakes, flying-foxes, large macropods, raptors or monitors as these must be rescued by trained specialists**, for these species please call WIRES first for rescue assistance on 1300 094 737.
7. **If you own a swimming pool and live near where fires are burning** there are some simple things you can do to assist wildlife who may be seeking water. 

Always drape something over the edge of your pool so that animals have a surface to grab hold of and climb out. A length of heavy duty rope or even a bodyboard, secured at one end to something heavy outside the pool, is ideal as it does not absorb water and provides a platform for an exhausted animal to rest on. 

Pool steps are also frequently too high to allow animals an easy exit and placing bricks or large stones to the side of each step can make it easier for animals to gain a foothold and climb out. 

Always check your pool regularly (twice daily) including in the skimmer box. If you do find any animal trapped in a pool, call WIRES immediately on 1300 094 737 for advice.

True, antinatilism is more it's own philosophical position and this sub is not for the gen pop - my family would probably banish me in some form if they knew of my interest. 
I definitely understand the need for support, I can see myself needing that if I were to reveal myself childfree to friends and family and the like. I know it's not designed to convince people to be childfree, but someone like myself, who is undecided, finds a lot of value in the real life stories of these childfree people, and they may ultimately help many undecided people choose. Often the posts are as funny as they are mean. I read it every once in a while, but sooner or later the bitterness at a child or a parent is very distracting and off-putting."
Vezi_Ordinary,fdry314,t1_fdrf0a9,Ha. I often feel like life IS trying new things and suffering but it's worthwhile if you can build resilience to withstand all the BS.

icebiker,fdrifek,t1_fdrgs4b,"That's an interesting point. Even though it isn't designed for the general population, it is a public group and may turn people off from being childfree rather than being welcome to fence-sitters. 

I also don't understand the hate towards anti-natalists (not saying this is you!) - it's a philosophical position like utilitarianism or nihilism. I'm an anti-natalist, but I'm not out there killing kids or anything lol. I just believe the world would be a better place with fewer children, and we should adopt kids who need homes."
queenxboudicca,fds0999,t1_fdry314,"Even if you can't rn, it's all good, you will."
Vezi_Ordinary,fdrxedk,t1_fdrifek,"I think I understand the anti-natalist position and I also understand the hate towards it. I personally commend anyone who is able to take that stance in public. My family is quite traditional when it comes to bloodlines, adopting is not something we really do in our culture and not having children (blood related or not) is to not really live or do your duty. That mindset is probably what kept populations alive and thriving in the past, but I think it's old-fashioned and does nothing to move us forward anymore."

ricardortr,fdqw4os,t1_fdqnktj,This guy on my fb shared one of those poles that you can vote on with this image titled:” would you rather have a hollow award or a fulfilling child?” I chose the award tbh because eating children is not advised if you’re on keto.

Calvy93,fdrd4jj,t1_fdqu8hk,"It's rather a ""victory at the cost of abortion is not a victory""-pic. It referenced Michelle Williams and her speech after winning a Golden Globe, when she said that she had an abortion in order to achieve this victory."

Kangarou,fdsf55b,t1_fds5em9,"As long as other people on the planet exist, there are other legacies one can leave behind besides flesh.

There are many notable historical figures who never had children, and many historical or influential figures who did are still more well known for the exploits of their life than the lineage of their blood. 

Except Genghis Khan. Dude fucked like an absolute monster, apparently."
orphiclacuna,fdsbu2m,t3_emrvv5,"Listen listen. Idc if this gets downvoted. I'm about to talk about the original. There's more to being a woman than having kids. If having a kid is what makes you feel fulfilled then great. I'm glad you're happy with your personal choices. But that should not be forced onto other women who feel differently. If she feels fulfilled with her actions then fine. She didn't hurt anyone. ""But wait,"" i hear you say, ""she got an abortion!"" Fun fact, [this](https://www.livescience.com/54774-fetal-pain-anesthesia.html) article says ""...the fetus is not capable of feeling pain until the third trimester..."" Women who don't want kids aren't wrong. Women who do want kids aren't wrong. People who think that one is correct are the ones who are actually wrong. Having kids is a CHOICE that anyone should be allowed to accept or decline. Call it murder. Call it a sin. Call it whatever the fuck you want. It's not your life. It's not your choice. It's not your business. Fuck off."

altocleph,fdywh1v,t1_fdyw4px,"bro does a freshly fertilized egg have a conscience, feelings, emotions, memories, or anything resembling what we consider to be traits of people? it doesn’t because it is merely a clump of cells. most women who get abortions get them when the embryo is a clump of cells."
calvin12304,fdyyh2c,t1_fdywh1v,"So can I kill you if your in a coma? Because people in comas don't have conscience, feelings, emotions, or memories. Also embryos have human DNA which is typically found in people in case you didn't know."

LilyOrchids,fe60y4a,t1_fe5ui5b,"The first image is of a lump of coal, the second is a diamond. Pressurized coal is how diamonds are formed. So the 'she' in the picture thinks she's like coal when she's not wearing make up, but they think she's more like a diamond when not wearing it. You don't really need to know Minecraft to follow this one. :)"

myestrangedfather33,fe6rres,t3_ente8b,"Ok I know this advice is unsolicited, but never tell a girl that she looks better without makeup. You’re basically insulting the makeup, telling her that she’s putting all this effort in for nothing, and  probably making her insecure about it. Instead you should hype up her make up and tell her how good it looks, or just tell her she’s beautiful no matter what. I’ve seen so many relationships where guys say this, thinking they’re giving a compliment on natural beauty, but it never comes across that way to a woman."

untipoquenojuega,fds9r3p,t1_fds8dyg,"I think that concept is pretty liberating as well. Essentially, you're moving the onus away from other people to either like you or dislike you and putting it on yourself. If others can only love or hate their idea of you, and ideas are ever shifting and prone to change, then you should only be focused on loving yourself and enjoying those who happen to reciprocate that love."
PupPop,fdsffon,t1_fds8dyg,"I don't think that is the logic laid our here. The more simple logic is that people who don't know you but display hate towards you anyway cannot reasonably truly hate you. They simply do not know anything about you but the way you look, for example racism. They can only hate their preconceptions of you, and not who you truly are because they know nothing about you. This allows you to feel better about being ""hated"" because who are they to judge you?"

TheHaip,fdx7jgx,t1_fds9r3p,Agreed.
The_Decoy,fduas3u,t1_fds9r3p,But the comic specifically addresses the hate of strangers. So for my interpretation I see this as saying those that hate do not know the true character of the creature. Whereas those that are expressing love know the character of that creature.

G0DW1N14,fe6ks13,t3_enuacc,I never had a pet myself but all my cousin's had dogs in their house and all and them were a year older than me. I used to fear every single of them while growing up. I turned 14-15 and didn't fear dogs anymore and when i went to their house after a long time i asked them where were their dog? They said they passed away. That moment i felt so sad. It hit me that i used to fear from them and now they are gone and no one's gonna come running to gate to sniff me and run crazy with happiness and getting me to pet them and i would try to be stiff as a pole. I miss the dogs even after 3 years of all this. All the dogs loved me since i was the youngest kid in the family and it hit me that they loved me as their younger sibling and all of them would always come and lick me and i could never appreciate them. I miss those wonderful dogs.

I personally prefer the weather where it's between the 18-23 degrees Celsius, so it's warm enough to function but you can still go swimming and things like that. 

Last summer I went on vacation to Greece, and within 2 weeks I got a heatstroke 3 times. Each time I tried to stay in the shadows, or inside, or swim in the shadows but whatever I did, it didn't help. I guess I'm just not made for the hot weather."

wheres-the-pig,fdmnu5c,t1_fdmnk1e,"You can usually tell by the tone. If they’re irritated “mate” can be passive-aggressive.

exhausted_cactus,fdng3s3,t1_fdnb1mr,"Depends on the context. Usually it’s a positive thing. “Bruv” obviously means “brother”, the term is almost exclusively used in London. But sometimes it can be used in a threatening way. And if you’ve upset someone and Then afterwards you call them “Bruv” it’s disrespectful. Don’t call someone bruv unless u are already friends, otherwise it might come across as disrespectful."

When they really get into it, I tell them that he doesn't normally respond to scritches like that so they must be really good at it!

It's so nice when it happens around the end of the workday - Some people come home from a bad day of work (or school) and you can see it in their shoulders and their posture, then Bugsy rocks up and is insistent about being petted and scritched.

MagesticPegasus,fdpt7ff,t1_fdpeu5g,"Burnt trees doesn’t mean dead trees, a lot of our bush land thrives after bushfires. I know these fires have been the worst yet, but hopefully they’ll still be alive on the inside like usual and sprout new growth in a few months"

SwedishWaffle,fdpzzn3,t1_fdpt7ff,Ash is one hell of a fertilizer
Solindolent,fdq41as,t1_fdpt7ff,There’s also the plants and trees that require fire for their seeds to sprout. So there’ll always be new stuff growing after a fire
Loxus,fdq66wp,t1_fdpt7ff,"Australia will be VERY interesting from a biological point, I'd believe."
Stoumpf,fdqhsa2,t1_fdpt7ff,"In Quebec, Canada burnt trees means a lot of blue berry in few years. AND a shit lot of new trees !"
Wooshmeister55,fdr83xs,t1_fdpt7ff,"Eucalyptus trees in particular are pyrophillic, they prefer to be burned down every so and so years so they can have a very furtile soil again for their offspring"
Hephaestus_God,fds2fqv,t1_fdpt7ff,The problem is recently more and more weeds and shrubs have been growing in place of trees after fires (all around the world). They grow faster and end up stealing the light and nutrients needed for the saplings to grow. This limiting tree growth.
spades_king,fdq42fq,t1_fdpqhr4,would the burnt trees made more CO2 in atmosphere?
MichelleUprising,fdqjutq,t1_fdpqhr4,"Trees only produce a small amount of the oxygen we breathe (most is used locally, globally oxygen comes primarily from phytoplankton) , and frankly oxygen isn’t a big concern right now. The problem is the carbon dioxide. It takes a very long time for trees to sequester CO2 from the air, except when they burn, it all goes right back up. It will take decades at the least to even come close to cleaning up the carbon pollution from the fires. 

It’s not a net benefit. Australia’s land was forced into poor management but colonialism and genocide of its ancestral caretakers. Regular fires stopped and the fuel started stacking up, setting up for mega fires. With climate change-induced drought and that acting hand in hand, we get the situation today."
Andy_Reas,fdqdveq,t1_fdphe73,"Christmas trees are farmed, they'll plant new ones."

MichelleUprising,fdqk01x,t1_fdq42fq,"Yep. Even if trees grow back, they won’t absorb that much CO2 again for decades at best. Some areas of ancient rainforest burned too, those will never be the same."

  But on the plus side I went and pulled a door from junkyrd and found some missing parts I needed and fixed my lock while I was changing door so it's smooth as butter and better than before although different color. Fixed the window and got it all switched out. Also I'm 11-0 as of this writing on pulling a random paper fortune cookie like paper out each morning I had written down and completing task each day. From making bed with a smile to 15min meditation..I did that in lieu of some grand resolutions to declare and at the end of January I'll make February papers to fold up and pull out randomly each day.

A lot of times they're too quick to fix someone else's problem (either because they've been there before or they think the answer is obvious) when what the person desperately needs is to just process their own emotions. For some people that means alone time, for others it means talking it out with someone who will listen."

catfurbeard,fe0brqb,t1_fdylwfq,"The worst is when they *haven't* been there before, but still somehow think the solution they came up with on the spot after listening to you for a couple minutes is really helpful. And then when you tell them it's not, they argue with you.

""When I'm telling you how I feel, it's not supposed to be a debate"" is something I've told people, but I think for some it's a reflex so it's hard to stop."

boobchopper,fe0o3hk,t1_fdylwfq,"I thank you so much for giving me this. I always tried to help people until I finally found I was just trying to solve their problems and not really caring about what they need. I understand that it's not the solution they're always looking for, sometimes just the strength to go through it. And with this, I believe I'm going to start to give less advice and more ears. Idk, I feel I'm enlightened."

FuckMelnTheAssDaddy,fe11y9c,t1_fe0b8kf,Your emotions are always valid.
Nomulite,fe31umh,t1_fe0guy5,"It can sometimes come off as egotistical to listen to someone's complex, personal situation and then after thinking about it for a second, thinking your immediate idea is a worthy suggestion. Nobody else is going to know their situation better than they do, and a lot of the time, your suggestions have either already been considered or wouldn't work. Sometimes it's a lot easier and wiser to just listen to their situation and allow them to decompress it through communication. There's a reason that the psychologist is literally just sitting there listening to a character talk about their problems until the character comes up with their own solution is common enough to be a trope."

But hell, I’m 30 and have never been embraced by a woman I love and loves me back. It’s an awful feeling as many know. For the past two years I took up fitness kickboxing as a way to get healthy and meet others. But it didn’t fix anything. I hate my flaws more than I love my abilities. It’s getting worse too with time. I love meeting and talking with lots of different girls, but as soon as I think of trying to approach someone romantically I swell up with crippling fear. Fear not just of embarrassment and rejection, but fear that they might like me back and not knowing what to do from there. Worrying I will disappoint them like I have so many others in my life. What if I hurt them with all of my problems? I desire romance with all my heart but I’m terrified of it as well. I know I shouldn’t hate myself, but I can’t stop."

**Wing it**. You will only learn from experience. You can practice and if things don't work remember it's not the end of the world. Not everyone is meant for each other.

I know it might sound easier said than done but I believe in you."
merqurycitymeltdown,fe6n9h1,t1_fe6eidk,"No. Narcissistic behavior involves constantly needing to be the center of attention because you feel you should be, infatuation with yourself, grandiose posturing and a general disregard for the feelings of others.

Loving yourself is understanding that while you may have flaws, there are a lot of parts of you that are awesome and even if nobody else loves those things about you (which people do love those awesome things about you) at least you love those things about you. Because like the original person who said to love yourself more, it really won’t matter how much somebody else loves you if you hate yourself. Because your internal hatred will push away any external affection, whether you realize it or not."
nukedduck,fe7mp0v,t1_fe6i5us,"Thanks bud. I tell myself this kind of advice all the time, I just can’t follow through when I realize I’m attracted to someone.

PaperPonies,fdiiotj,t3_eljasn,"When my older brother was still in highschool he had three friends who unfortunately became unwelcome in their own homes. Three boys from different families had nowhere to go or felt uncomfortable at home. It was unbelievable. 

My parents let them all move in with us at the farm, one by one. They were able to set up beds upstairs and had their own rooms. It felt so good having the house full. I felt so special when they'd all rave and compliment the dinners I'd cook for everyone. It was like having extra brothers. They ate a ton, I felt like an army cook! Anyway,

One night one of them told us that he couldn't believe how my family talked to one another, that we didn't yell or argue. I completely took that for granted, it had never even occurred to me. At one point another said he could finally breathe at our house. 

I'll never forget when the oldest of the three told my mother, ""You're like another mom to me."" She said he could call her mom if he wanted and he just burst into tears. This big tough teenager just wanted a hug from my mom. 

In the time they stayed, these ""throwaway"", angry, hurt, rejected boys were able to just relax. My mom got them all to graduate (two were wanting to drop out), she helped them with resumes, job hunting, taxes, car troubles... She somehow got them off drugs so they could get jobs. But she didn't do it with anger or force, she supported them and **helped** instead of reprimanded. It was incredible to see them all transform. 

It was a great time in my life, I loved having such a big family and that experience is why I've decided to become a foster parent in the future. 

Not sure why I typed all this out but I can't wait to be that person in someone's life and I really hope others open their hearts and homes to those who don't have one or don't feel welcome in their own because you can absolutely make a difference in someone's life."

Sansko,fdjgj35,t3_eljasn,"My grandma was really the last to do this, we nade her best friend a part of our family. Invited her on dinners all the time, she visited her and us children close to daily, we went out on sightsing in Oslo all the time. Her husband was dead and her own children were absent, so we did grow into one large family. But grandma died, and ''(grand) aunt Ella'', as we called her got dementia. Now she is at hospital, just waiting to die, her biological son refuses to cut out her medicine, he doesn't want to lose her. She can't even talk anymote, she just screams constantly, or cries out of fear out of not knowing where she is. And she gets nightmares of her childhood all the time, of her abuse at home and bullying at school for being abused at home. It is just so gruesome, I love her!, but I just wish that she could die without more pain now, she has gone through enough!


Sorry, I went off topic and even began to cry out of thinking of this. We are a very close family tbh, we only include people when they either marry or have been life long friends. My stepmum has been both, but she is about to remarry dad soon, so that's why I didn't mention her. Who knows, maybe we will ''adopt'' more people soon?"

Dansworth,fdlk1lw,t3_em09td,"That excited trepidation before I asked her to marry me was such an amazing feeling. Two weeks of having the ring and KNOWING the answer, but terrified that I might be wrong.

That was 18 years and 8 kids ago.

Now I get excited wondering if she is awake enough to kiss back when I say goodbye while I'm leaving for work in the morning. (not gonna lie, it's a long commute when you need a house for a big family that you can still afford)"
insertfunnyusernameh,fdm96x7,t1_fdlk1lw,"8 kids... wow. I mean no offense you live your life how it makes you happy, but how do you deal with so many kids? I’m like actually curious this isn’t rhetorical."
Dansworth,fdmgjpt,t1_fdm96x7,"The biggest changes I experienced in life are (from smallest to largest) I'm married, I have a kid, there is more than one, ""Honey - they out number us!""

Once the kids out numbered us, each new one wasn't that much of a change in the daily routine. Things take longer and each kid can't do every extra curricular activity, but they each get one (bonus if two+ kids pick the same one at the same or adjacent time.

I don't make an obscene amount of money, just enough really to cover bills, with rent/mortgage being the only one bigger than food ($1450 a month on food, no eating out without it being planned and budgeted well in advance). At our family size it is more cost effective for my wife to be at home than it is to have her work and us pay for daycare. Also we clawed our way out of debt when we had fewer kids, this size would not work with interest accruing. 

The kids are not raising themselves but they do have chores they are held responsible for completing, such as cleaning their bathroom, washing dishes, vaccuming, sweeping, and for the ones over 12 cooking a dinner a week (they start assisting in meal prep with my wife or I at 10.) These are assigned based on age, and we are fortunate that we don't have any special needs children. They share rooms, no one gets their own, finding a house with more than 5 rooms is difficult and seemingly impossible in my price range.

Honestly at this point I can't imagine having fewer kids, not just because I can't pick one and say everyone younger needs to not be here, but because things would be boring. They are not angels and I frequently think, as I get out of my car and hear the shouting, laughing, and sometimes screaming (little girls are so high pitched) that I wouldn't be at the right house if things were quiet. I'm fairly handy, which is good because a lot of stuff seems to get broken and need repairing.

I love my wife, kids, and life and am looking forward to grandchildren (just please not for another 7 years, I'd like my oldest to be at least 22 for his sanity). The hardest part is simply being on time."

dirtandstarsinmyeyes,fdrdct3,t3_emucwo,"I remember doing this. It was always embarrassing. And for the people talking about the foster parents being paid money to provide clothes that should cover a suite case/luggage: the first time you use a garbage bag, it’s from your family, not from foster care. The next few times, you probably haven’t been in the home long enough to go shopping, at least I wasn’t. Bouncing around from home to home is way different than you think, even when you think you understand. The idea is nice and will make kids feel more human, I like it."
Neilpoleon,fdru1bn,t3_emucwo,"This was addressed when this was posted somewhere else, duffel bags and backpacks are more helpful than suitcases. Suitcases are too large and bulky for foster care workers to potentially keep in their cars."
Pixel-1606,fdrr8ff,t3_emucwo,"See, this is the kind of stuf I like seeing here, 

as someone who doesn't know anyone in this situation I would never have thought of this, but now I will in the future."
torrentialstorm,fdr29l1,t3_emucwo,"It’s a nice idea and I guess it depends on where you are in the world. 
In the UK foster carers should be paid a decent amount to buy the foster children good quality clothes - preferable new too rather then getting second hand clothes. 
It’s true that sadly some children in care still move from placement to placement with black bags, there is a massive incentive to stop this and foster carers and child’s SW should ensure they do not move with their belongings in black bags - there are some great charities around who also provide these for children in care!"
quiesttonnom,fdraof1,t1_fdr29l1,"It is also true in the states that foster families receive a small stipend up front and a smaller one each month to get the children new clothes and essentials; however, most children are taken from whatever situation as quickly as possible, so more often than not they are carrying all their belongings in trash bags. For older children, it can be embarrassing especially if they live in a large apartment complex where the children play outside. Here, there is less of an emphasis on dignity on behalf of the child, the focus is to get them out of whatever situation. I understand speed is a necessity, but a person's a person, no matter how small."
icanhasnaptime,fdt1bf6,t1_fdr29l1,"In the US, foster parents do get a stipend but every penny gets stretched.  I’d rather spend that money on more clothes, better shoes, etc than something easily donatable like bags.  But really, more foster kids are getting moved from aunts to cousins to grandmas to whoever else- and those people do NOT get a stipend in many states.  The idea is that kids are better off with family than formal foster care, but those people don’t get as much support, financial or otherwise."
torrentialstorm,fdrbvkr,t1_fdraof1,"That is no different here, kids sometimes arrive in placements literally with only the clothes the wear - sometimes not even have shoes. Your story makes me thankful that here there is an emergency allowance so that essentials can be bought for these kids straight away. 
Thank you for educating me on how things are done where you live - is that in the US?"
DeathstarIndustries,fdrteo3,t1_fdraof1,"I'm not sure what the going rate is in the US, but foster carers in the UK get more than a small stipend. It equates to over $2500 a month for each child. 

It's a nice thought but I think if you turned up with a load of old luggage at a UK foster agency they'd probably say 'thanks for the thought, but we don't need it so take it to a charity shop'."
torrentialstorm,fduo9w9,t1_fdt1bf6,That is awful!!! In the UK there is a friends and family scheme too but they also get decent pay too. It’s mind blowing how differently foster care looked upon in different countries
quiesttonnom,fdrd6wa,t1_fdrbvkr,"Yes, some friends of mine were foster parents (they adopted the kids about a year ago).

sevenbraincells,fdnmsgz,t3_em71hx,"A while ago I was extremely suicidal, I never tried it but I had an exact plan for it every detail to my suicide was though out throughly and I was too close to attempting it. But then I decided that I need to talk about it and that's what I did. I talked to my best friend and just absolutely vented everything, it is insane I went to bed and had the best sleep I've had in years.

And it's been about 4 years and I haven't felt suicidal yet, it is great advice to find someone you trust and let it all out."

badbitch4eva,fdp0k22,t3_em71hx,This is making me wanna cry because I’ve honestly been really confused about my gender identity lately and I know I need to talk to my therapist about it.
belsamber,fdpiubf,t1_fdp0k22,"<3

I can imagine that being a really intimidating thing to bring up, but it’s probably the first step towards becoming less confused :) Just remember gender can be fluid and how you feel about it can change daily, and that’s ok (though I imagine it to be pretty challenging, even though I’ve not been through it myself.)"
szkies,fdq25jg,t1_fdp0k22,don’t feel pressured to be any certain way or gender. just go with the flow and eventually everything will straighten itself out ~<3
MisterEChops,fdpklg2,t3_em71hx,"Absolutely.

Toxic masculinity kills more men per year than almost any other ‘illness’. Suicide is far too common, and a big part of the reason is how certain people are raised to not talk about their emotions."

belsamber,fdo5g99,t1_fdmub48,"Many countries have free phone counselling services which can offer a listening ear and support. I’m not sure where you’re based, but for the US there’s a list [here](https://www.opencounseling.com/hotlines-us)  and googling for “free phone counselling <your country>” might turn something up. Best wishes."

Arkronu,fdmuopl,t3_em71hx,Society won't agree sadly
MisterEChops,fdpkh4n,t1_fdmuopl,"Society already does. If you have toxic people around you who disagree, you need to find better company."
whoop_there_she_is,fdndnbj,t1_fdn4vrr,"Those are opinions, though, not feelings.

""I am feeling lost and hopeless"" is a feeling. ""I feel like jews should die"" is an opinion. ""I don't want to live"" is a feeling. ""I feel like other people would be better off without me"" is an opinion. The word ""feeling"" has two different definitions, so I see where you're getting mixed up. The validation wave is supposed to reassure others of their *emotional* feelings. Nobody is saying all opinions that begin with ""i feel"" are valid."
spirituallyinsane,fdo5by8,t1_fdndnbj,"Even what you distinguish as ""opinions"" can be valuable to share, in certain situations, because it allows the person to feel heard.  This validates them as a person, without necessarily validating the opinion.  It opens the door for those feelings and opinions to be worked through, rather than hardened in place as a defensive measure."
Donalds_neckfat,fdn2u58,t3_em71hx,“No matter your gender” could have been left out..
Euroranger,fdo2gu9,t1_fdn2u58,"I think it was meant for men.

That said, many years ago I was in a marriage where the wife at the time would get physically violent and ended one such episode with heaving a heavy crystal vase at me.  Missed the back of my head by perhaps a quarter inch but would likely have killed me had she connected.

Fast forward to the next day and I'm calling the local shelters to see what my options were.  Guess what: if you're a woman and your male partner is beating on you, you have unlimited support and immediate assumption and validation of your story.  I discovered though that when the tables are turned, the first question they asked at this particular shelter was ""What did you do?  Did you strike her first?"".  During that conversation I was snickered at and then told my best bet was to call the police or sheriff as they were a battered women's shelter and had zero services to offer a man.  In fact, they didn't even know anyone they could refer me to...and, TBH, by their attitude they couldn't have cared less.

I divorced that woman coming on 5 years ago and have remarried a much-better-in-every-way human being and we're exceptionally happy.  But if you're a man in our western society today, your support options are fairly sparse."
belsamber,fdo4h8k,t1_fdn2u58,"It’s actually an important point, as the source material which I linked to in another comment deals with toxic masculinity and how it negatively impacts men. The issue of not seeking help impacts everyone, but impacts men more than women[1], because “talking about your problems” in many groups of men is not seen as possible or is laughed at.

It’s taught me how incredibly important for it is for EVERYONE to talk about stuff and be able to reach out, it’s quite amazing what can happen if you do, in cases of addiction it’s actually life saving."
