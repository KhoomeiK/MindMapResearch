Relatively_Curious,enw4hp,top_level,
Urlilpetal,fe5ugos,t3_enw4hp,Lol I wouldn‚Äôt be able to trust strangers with my cats but I‚Äôm glad you had a good experience with the air bnb kitty! Sounds like a dream
Relatively_Curious,fe5v02q,t1_fe5ugos,"The kitty and I shared the bed for the first few hours of the night, and he continue to sleep on the chair next to the bed. Then he came back to bed in the morning to wake me up. It was a great service. 

I left the door open to let the kitty in and out. 

It was a private room Airbnb and the host stayed in another room. So I guess she was fine leaving the cat with a stranger."
lalabearie,fe6bsaw,t1_fe5ugos,">I wouldn‚Äôt be able to trust strangers with my cats  

I read way too much stories about human beings abusing all sorts of animals. Even feeding stray dog with nails inside the food, purposely. :(, So yea, I agree with you."
iwascompromised,fe6j7z7,t1_fe5ugos,It‚Äôs NEVER being left alone. This is ALWAYS a room in someone‚Äôs house. Every. Single. Time. These pets simply live in the house and the guest is staying there and the pets are just friendly. They aren‚Äôt being left in the care of a total stranger.
DamienPwnz,fe6g0rb,t1_fe5ugos,"As cute and wholesome as this post was, that was my first thought lol"
TinyKittenConsulting,fe86vas,t1_fe5ugos,"I think this is not uncommon for AirBnBer's who rent out rooms, not their whole houses. That being said, our AirBnB in Minnesota let their big cloud of a dog come visit with us while we stayed in their next door house."
nomadicfangirl,fe8f1l2,t1_fe5ugos,"If I had an AirBnB, the people who stayed would never see my kitties. They are very scared of strangers. (But yeah also I‚Äôd never leave my kitties with people I didn‚Äôt know. I worry enough about leaving them with my good friends who catsit.)"
DownWithTheShip,fecq7wl,t1_fe5ugos,I would pay extra for an airbnb with a cat.
0utcazt,fe6ivzg,t1_fe5v02q,Did you tip him?
TheDocJ,fe6wogb,t1_fe5v02q,"My goodness. If I ran an airb'n'b, my cat would be waking guests every hour on the hour to try and persuade them that it was feeding time."
eatmydonuts,fe8jfuh,t1_fe5v02q,"Oh man, like u/Urlilpetal said, I could NEVER trust my cat with a stranger. You never know when you're going to get a guest who hates cats, and/or decides to take it out on her. Or, even worse, they end up loving her and decide to grab her and disappear in the middle of the night."
Tup00,fe6c7b4,t1_fe6bsaw,Fuckimg evil!!!! Why??? Why???
Lalalalethal,fe6l2kj,t1_fe6j7z7,Thank you. I honestly always wondered about this as I could NEVER imagine letting a stranger take care of my cats (let alone chill in my house but that's another thing I guess haha).
phonethrowaway55,fe6t7gd,t1_fe6j7z7,Friendly pets are the best pets
Diazepampoovey,fe8gj1x,t1_fe6j7z7,"I mean, if your host is staying in a different room & leaving you your privacy, they could decide to take the cat on the way out the door or something. 

I'm pretty protective of my animals and definitely couldn't imagine leaving them around strangers"
sparkling-whine,febpz0h,t1_fe86vas,I have an adorable mental image of a big cloud of a dog and it‚Äôs making me smile!!!
michaeldbrooks,fe6j43o,t1_fe6ivzg,Do people tip Airbnb hosts?
Relatively_Curious,fe8n9xl,t1_fe6ivzg,"He insisted that he gets more than enough wet food from his boss, and he doesn‚Äôt want tips for his honest service. 

Very forward thinking cat. No cats should rely on generosity of strangers. #minimimwage"
TinyKittenConsulting,fe86x9o,t1_fe6ivzg,"0.4 g of catnip is the going rate, I believe."
prettybunnys,fe7uizw,t1_fe6wogb,"‚ÄúListen, you may not know this but I‚Äôm actually trapped here. They never feed me. Ever. I need food now. Please. Or I WILL die.‚Äù"
Relatively_Curious,fe8jy4v,t1_fe8jfuh,"She mentioned multiple times in the description that there‚Äôs a cat. That should deter anyone who doesn‚Äôt like cats or allergic to cats.

You are true that the cat could get stolen, but I guess that‚Äôs something the host was willing to take chance. 

Also, I don‚Äôt know for sure, but visitors also get reviewed by the hosts. And I would think hosts can see the reviews. So that might help a little with picking good people."
lalabearie,fe6cb20,t1_fe6c7b4,"Idk, I read it [here](https://philnews.ph/2019/12/28/street-dogs-fed-with-nails-inside-food-goes-viral/) . If you wanna read. It‚Äôs so sad :("
sewbrilliant,fe851ej,t1_fe6c7b4,"Theres a documentary on Netflix takes place in South America. They provide a refuge for abandoned dogs. They must have had hundreds, if not thousands. Many of them were abused. Its very sad what some people do. The very act of abandoning your dog is abuse in itself. You are supposed to adopt a dog for life, they only live 15 years if they are lucky. Poor dogs..."
iwascompromised,fe83ssg,t1_fe826fg,"What about this post isn‚Äôt true?

OP literally said they rented a room in someone‚Äôs house.

0utcazt,fe6j9ui,t1_fe6j43o,Idk. But they should tip the cat for extra cuddle service not specified in the rental agreement.
BeanDemon,fe6mlnj,t1_fe6j43o,I think they meant the cat!
IMissHanSolo,fe6lzmp,t1_fe6j43o,I don't think I'd do airbnb if a tip was expected. I already pay for cleaning.
shizzmynizz,fe886yl,t1_fe6j43o,"I mean he should straight up pay the cat, you know, for ""services"" rendered and being discrete about it and all that.  

And he should tip too. I mean, the cat DID spend the whole night. Usually it's just an hour or two."
0utcazt,fe94cbk,t1_fe8n9xl,Lol.
0utcazt,fe949i4,t1_fe86x9o,Seems about right.
TheDocJ,fe83anv,t1_fe7uizw,"""Fat? Appearances can be deceptive. I'm wasting away under all of this fur. Wasting away, I tell you."""
nomadicfangirl,fe8f6vw,t1_fe7uizw,"My cat, every morning, is like Frodo in Return of the King. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt remember the taste of water...or food....‚Äù"
TechnoVKNG23,fe9fych,t1_fe7uizw,"These are my cats, with the people they see every day at home, they think that it will eventually work."
eatmydonuts,fe8ldal,t1_fe8jy4v,"Well I was also thinking about someone who enjoys hurting/tormenting cats, specifically picking an AirBnB to act out some of those urges.

It isn't a rational fear, because I know that's not a very common thing. All I'm saying is I would never take that chance, no matter how small."
BeanDemon,fe6mmy1,t1_fe6cb20,Gonna be a hard pass for me
michaeldbrooks,fe6jo6e,t1_fe6j9ui,Ah yeah that‚Äôs very true. Hopefully that tip would would also buy the kitty cat some treats for being a good companion.
ap539,fe7nqv5,t1_fe6j9ui,"‚ÄúYou scratch my back, I scratch your face‚Äù"
TinyKittenConsulting,fe872sb,t1_fe6lzmp,"I... do tip on AirBnB. But I'm old and used to travel with VRBO, where it was strongly implied that tipping was appropriate for the cleaning service."
CutthroatTeaser,fe6p7k0,t1_fe6lzmp,I've done a ton of Air BnB and have never tipped or heard of people tipping.
Relatively_Curious,fe8lm77,t1_fe8ldal,"I can see the concern. 

With the host being around, I‚Äôd imagine she would notice if a guest was hurting the cat and the host hear the cat screaming."
sparkling-whine,febpkcf,t1_fe8ldal,Oh my god what a horrible thought!!! I could never take that chance with my own kitties. But I sure would love to stay at an AirBnB with a cat included! I got close once in Iceland. The neighbor‚Äôs cat that we had been talking to/petting outside all week got into our apartment and would not leave. So we just enjoyed his company until he decided to leave.
Teslewton,fe6o912,t1_fe6mmy1,I live in germany and just recently read in local news that a dog found a sausage somewhere in a park and the owner was fast to notice that there were razor blades inside of it! Just sick! I don't want to imagine what could have happened if the owner wasn't fast enough..
iwascompromised,fe8bp5f,t1_fe8a6sd,"There may be some people that rent their whole place out with pets included, but it‚Äôs probably extremely rare and a really stupid idea. But overall, it‚Äôs a private room in an occupied house that has pets."
0utcazt,fe6p64l,t1_fe6jo6e,"Or you could just tip him in cat treats, or from your food. Your extra chicken, salmon, ice cream, cheese, etc."
orokami11,fe6qlq6,t1_fe6o912,"People are fucking sick.

My friend has a neighbour who poisoned her cat. She'd always feed chicken through the wall, and my friend thought the neighbour just liked cats but one day my friend found her cat on the floor with froth all over the mouth. Couple days later she overheard the neighbour's family saying how they're so glad the cat isn't around anymore. Worst thing is she gave birth to 4 kittens a month before that. So they still needed mom around....

In my country it's a 50/50 with people and strays. Some love them, and some go out to put rat poison or antifreeze in their food."
samudec,fe6qdwr,t1_fe6p64l,Is a little salami included in the etc?
comyuse,fe6t9kl,t1_fe6qlq6,That sounds like a sure fire way of having your house set on fire at 2 in the morning
0utcazt,fe6qhez,t1_fe6qdwr,Of course.

jojenboben,fe5zr34,t3_enw4hp,I just bookmarked a few airbnb's with house cats thinking it will be nice to get some cat love on our summer trip. So sweet!
danni_shadow,fe66sxy,t1_fe5zr34,I hate leaving the cats. Having a cat to hold me over would make trips so much better.
pinkkittenfur,fe69m6h,t1_fe5zr34,"My husband and I stayed in a hotel with a cat-mascot in Amsterdam. If you go, the hotel is called Hotel La Boh√®me, and the kitty is called Mimi. She's so sweet."
wrackspurrt,fe69k63,t1_fe5zr34,"Check out [Trusted Housesitters](www.trustedhousesitters.com) 
There pets are the main factor and you don't even have to pay for the stay (only annual fee for the website). I discovered it when I googled for how to only find Airbnbs with pets."
justnopethefuckout,fe6jdsl,t1_fe5zr34,"Do pups count too? I have a pup and a kitten. My pup thinks everyone he meets is a friend and wants to cuddle. Anytime someone ignores him on a walk, he gets a sad look. Neighbors kids love him.

Edit: He loves watching tv too."
embracing_insanity,fe72jp0,t1_fe5zr34,House cats as an Airbnb amenity? Who'd have thunk? Now that I know - anything less just simply won't do. House Cat or Bust!
neegarplease,fe6he5z,t1_fe66sxy,Wow. You'd really just cheat on your cats like that? Shame on you.
windyna,fe6b2hv,t1_fe66sxy,Same. I don't have mine anymore but I remember I left for a week and when I came back he forgot who I was. It took him a bit over a week to get used to me again.
nostalgeek81,fe6rkq4,t1_fe66sxy,Same. When I was dating this guy we always went to his house and I had to leave my cat at home. Luckily he had 2! The first night there I slept with the kitten on me and she purred all night long (I give awesome scritches).

racecaracecaracecar,fe6egj9,t1_fe6b2hv,"He didn't forget, he was just pissed you left and took a while to get over it. Cats aren't dumb. My ex and I split last year, but we still occasionally catsit for each other (we had 4 collectively). It can be month or more, but my old cats remember me and just pick up where we left off. One waits at the door for hours after I leave. Each cat is different. Some hold grudges, some don't. But they all remember."

Look into Magic Arena (MTGA). It‚Äôs free to play on windows, coming soon to Mac"

McDedzy,fe1c50i,t1_fdzwcc4,"Nah, a young cat could never grow that tiny moustache at the end of their nose."
PanicAtTheMiniso,fe10t6k,t1_fdzx31j,Can't you drop his skincare routine for us? And his aesthetician's clinic?
FootprintsD131,fe1ge1i,t1_fdzx31j,May I ask what you feed him? Also any other specific things you do for him?
horizons0,fe2t9de,t1_fe1ge1i,"Wet food 4 times a day and dry food/milk is available for him at all times. There‚Äôs not really anything else that we do for him, I do give him daily cuddles and he sleeps at the end of my bed though!"

Does he get lacto free milk?"
horizons0,fe51i09,t1_fe4w13w,"Yeah he rarely drinks it though, but at least it‚Äôs there for him"
JustLouu,fe54oc0,t1_fe51i09,"Lucky kitty. Mine has never been interested in lacto free milk, but I'm lucky she likes water. Specifically the water in my drinking water glass... It apparently tastes better when it's stolen :)

But I've heard that it's important that cats drink, so we just leave out glasses of water for her :)"

elevashroom,fe0qs5a,t1_fdzy0u5,It's wet food. My cat is 21 and can no longer clean his nose properly so he gets wet food on there that he can't wipe off. It'll come off with a bit of warm water and a cloth :) happy birthday to your fluffy little friend
peachesofme,fdzzqod,t1_fdzy0u5,I find it super adorable.

HalfDeadGamer,fe8531f,t3_eo2bnd,They came to a mutual agreement that while the baby may have a monopoly on hugs and cuddles the cat can blame everything on the baby till he's 3

dilla506944,fe8iwga,t3_eo2bnd,"Our cat was always mean to our other kitty, who unfortunately passed away a few months before our son was born, and also to any other animal or visiting child to our house. We were a little nervous about how she would get on with our kid, but she's since been the sweetest, most *tolerant* cat for our boy. It's remarkable, like she's claimed him as her own, even when he's rough with her."
Raging_Bullgod,fe7u0jj,t3_eo2bnd,Looks sweet to us but is just the cat marking territory. He has claimed the little one as his.
HurkHurkBlaa,fe89nrj,t1_fe7u0jj,Making him smell like family
the-greenest-thumb,fe8smi3,t1_fe7u0jj,"It's a little more mutual than that. When cats rub heads they are rubbing each others scent glands on each other to mingle their scents, this shared scent says they are friends/family. If the cat wanted to scent the child to claim them, they'd rub the length of their body all over the child. Like when a cat weaves between your legs or rubs up against your cupboards, that's scent marking. But cheek and forehead rubbing is an ""I like you, let's be friends"" gesture. And it is almost always preceded by slow blinking (which is generally a cat asking permission to head rub)."
Mulsanne,fe9t10f,t1_fe7u0jj,"And what about that description is less sweet? I don't understand the people that point this out and think they're being clever

>Oh yeah? Well that cat just thinks of that boy as something very valuable and wants the boy to smell like him

...as if that undercuts the sweetness"
cant_think_of_one_,feab05y,t1_fe7u0jj,"I thought that's what cats were doing when they run the sides of their head against people/things, but that this headbutt thing is just to show affection. I didn't think they had the scent glands on the front/top of their heads like that. I would be interested if you know differently though."
AdventurousAddition,fec46hw,t1_fe7u0jj,They headbutt you to claim you as their own. I also had a cat that would bite your nose to express his love üòª
yummycorpse,fe8cm1w,t1_fe89nrj,i wouldn't trust anything that didn't smell like me
VexMythoclast69,feabfg5,t1_fe8smi3,How do subscribe for mo cat facts?
Raging_Bullgod,fec75l0,t1_fe8smi3,"I may not have put it as eloquent as you did but, he is still marking territory to show other they belong together.

And slow blink is a sign of trust just like sitting with their backs to you. They are watching your back while you watch theirs."
Raging_Bullgod,fec6b4w,t1_fe9t10f,I'm not being clever. Just pointing out the real reason. A lot of people confuse cat behavior for the wrong thing. To us to looks sweet. And is because he is accepting the little guy into his family.
the-greenest-thumb,feadkbs,t1_feabfg5,"üòÇ I don't know, I kinda just spew out the odd fact I know when I come across misinformation, or when someone asks. It's random, and not always about cats either. A lot of it is from when my mum did rescue work, others from when I wanted to be a vet."
the-greenest-thumb,fec9etg,t1_fec75l0,"Technically yes, in which case the baby is also marking the cat (in the cats eyes). But it's not as passive aggressive as true marking is. It's their version of a handshake or a hug. True marking will give intruding cats pause when they smell it, whereas scent mingling won't stop them. That's why when you pet your own cat then pet someone else's cat they generally don't mind. But if you took a blanket from your cat and gave it to the other cat they probably wouldn't want to use it right away. 

And slow blinking does mean different things, but at its most basic it is an avoidance of eye contact. Cats who are trusting do slow blink more, but it's not it's main function. Cats may slow blink to say ""I don't want to be mean, let's greet each other and be friends"", or they may use it when facing a more aggressive cat and are showing they don't want to fight. They also use it when in pain or discomfort as a way to reduce stress."
VexMythoclast69,feafe2u,t1_feadkbs,"Well, as a cat owner, I find these interesting and helpful."
the-greenest-thumb,feafijz,t1_feafe2u,"Well stay tuned I guess. Or try asking, I may know üòä"

feierfrosch,fe8w85d,t1_fe8dtbk,I'd rather get rid of kids (that I luckily don't have and never will) to get a cat than the other way round.
BangarangPita,fe9e17c,t1_fe8dtbk,"That's how I got my ginger gal.  Her name was Baby, and she was brought to the SPCA because someone in their house was having a baby and they worried that Baby would climb in the crib and smother or scratch it or something because she's so affectionate.  It was shitty of them to do that, but I'm glad because I have her, and I love her dearly.  She's an adorable orange monster, and to be fair, they weren't off in their reasoning.  She likes to lie on my chest/neck/mouth, and I get scratches in my sleep all the time from her trying to make a kitty cave under my blankets."
potato_potato_potato,fe9um3t,t1_fe8dtbk,"Some cats don't adjust well to the big changes that come with a new baby, and it can create a very stressful environment for both pet and new parents. Sometimes it's best to re-home the cat so they have a chance at a long and happy life in a child-free home rather than subject them to years of stress. It can be a difficult and heartbreaking decision, especially if the cat has been a beloved family member for a long time.

We've been very lucky that our cat is very sweet, but it still took him over a year to warm up to our kid. My best friend has 2 cats, and one of them is fine with their kid but the other has begun reacting fearfully (and aggressively) to everyone in the the household. The baby only just recently began walking and is already an expert at ""gentle pets"", and they have made sure the cat has plenty of safe baby-free zones to escape to. They've tried to help her adjust, but it's at the point that they think she'll be happier in a child-free home. This was my best friend's first cat and she is absolutely heartbroken and guilt-ridden just considering it. But it's not ""giving up"" or abandonment - she just wants the cat to be happy."
dont_remember_eatin,fe9etr9,t1_fe8dtbk,"My mom rehomed their cat after I was born because he liked to sleep in the crib with me.

Not because she's scum, but because she was an excessively-worried first-time mother in the early 80s, living in a new place with few friends, and with no living mother of her own to give her advice about pets and babies.

The fact that they got a kitten when I was just a year old, and he was my best bud until he died in my arms when I was 17, invalidates your ""scum"" claim.

Edit: and her last two or three cats that's she's taken on as adults are ones who needed rehoming for the same reason she did. She loves cats so much that she won't try to allay anyone's fears -- she'll gladly take on more kitties.

Edit mk2: Jesus tapdancing -- fuck this thread. Y'all just go ahead and dogpile with the downvotes. I'm sure you'd rather my mom have just kicked Stinky the cat (aforementioned crib hopper) out of the house to sleep with the cows and goats rather than give her another home where she could live indoors like she preferred."

It‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve been in an LTR but I‚Äôm okay with just staying in a committed relationship with a partner, but we wouldn‚Äôt need to tie the knot. Plus, I‚Äôm not interested in having children, so that‚Äôs even less motivation. 

And if I ever meet a guy and truly feel like we‚Äôd realistically stay together until one of us croaks, then I‚Äôd rather we just elope.

The only reason we got engaged was because the titles of boyfriend/girlfriend weren‚Äôt really adequate. We‚Äôve got no plans to actually wed.

We‚Äôve been together 10 years as of yesterday, whereas my sister is going through a divorce from a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù (read: sexist) guy. I really wish she hadn‚Äôt tried so hard to fix him, and I feel she did because she didn‚Äôt want to face the stigma of a divorce ‚Äî which is a terrible reason to stay with someone.

cant_think_of_one_,fdwfz2p,t1_fdweinq,"I don't mean to criticise how you feel, I'm just confused by why people are against it. I don't get how it is different to being unmarried in a long term committed and exclusive relationship, other than legal/administrative things are easier, really. As I said though, I'm not criticising, just don't understand and am curious. You don't have to defend your feelings, I'm just curious. ""I just feel like that and don't know why"" is a perfectly valid answer, and not giving one is absolutely your right too obviously. Partly I'm asking because I am curious about everyone who says this, but suspect they get asked a lot and are sick of answering, and feel like it is less pressure online, so am taking to opportunity to now. Sorry that it means you get asked yet again.

It is like people not wanting children I guess, except there are so many obvious reasons not to want children, so I don't get why people ask why."

We already had one cat that was my baby from when I first got her when I was 10. But our second cat definitely filled the void of losing a human baby."
greengingerwine,fdumyu2,t1_fdukg2w,"I cannot agree more about the difficulties that couples can have conceiving. I've had friends struggle with this and losing babies mid and full term and my heart breaks for them. 

There are also plenty of ppl who choose furbabies over the semihairless variety. This can also be challenging, with the all knowing, ""you'll change your mind"" like some stranger knows your life and body better than you do. All I know is that there is nothing more fulfilling than caring for a cat, because they are contrary.. also their sharts go straight into the litter tray rather than up their back+ bedsheets."

cicalino,fdrdds5,t3_emuo1h,"I feed my cat his wet food in a frisbee. He doesn't like his whiskers touching the edge of the bowl, so I chunk it up and spread it out in clumps. You think Lacy has whisker issues too?"
Atty_for_hire,fdrql1b,t1_fdrdds5,"Also, some cats benefit from having the bowls elevated a bit. So they don‚Äôt have to crouch down or over to eat."
Jicd,fdrtxyg,t1_fdrdds5,I was thinking that too until he picked it up off the floor. He had a flat surface there so maybe Lacy is just a weirdo who likes eating like humans.
StrayaMate2000,fds7c49,t1_fdrdds5,"100% need a shallow and wide dish.

>Whisker fatigue¬†happens to some cats when their sensitive¬†whiskers¬†are routinely being brushed up against something such as food or water bowls. It causes discomfort and even pain, and it makes eating and drinking stressful."
minicpst,fds8b6j,t1_fdrdds5,"We used cheap IKEA plates. No whisker fatigue, they were just easy to use, you can get a dozen for $2 or something, and they‚Äôre dishwasher safe."
RedHairThunderWonder,fdspm9e,t1_fdrdds5,"This most likely. Cats don't like having all their whiskers scrunched at the same time as they are very sensitive and can even make them feel anxious by suddenly not being able to feel their surroundings correctly. Cats are weird. All their whiskers and hairs and everything act as a sort of 3d imaging computer of their immediate surroundings. If you can't also has any eyesight issues this could add to not wanting to have its face completely in the bowl. 
It is also 100% possible your cat is just weird or bored and likes making a game out of eating for no other reason at all. 

I'm not an expert. Just really like cats. 

Also a fun fact is that certain types of plastic bowls can breed bacteria that will give your cat acne on their face. It's best to use a metal or ceramic bowl in those cases."
clawback18,fdsad3u,t1_fdrdds5,My first thought for OPs cat was the bowl is too small.
FoxInKneeSocks,fds99w9,t1_fdrdds5,Yeah I have to feed my cat Waffles on a plate because her face is too small and short to get food out of a bowl properly
SJO28,fdsjnnl,t1_fdrdds5,Ahhhhhhhhh!! That‚Äôs why my cat drags its food out onto the floor from its bowl! I had tried so many different bowls. Thanks for the tip!
superpony123,fdtjxgr,t1_fdrdds5,"Target has really nice bowls like this that are cheap, almost no lip and nice wide and flat. <$2 and they have  rubber bottoms so no sliding, but the bowls come in copper (fake i'm sure) and stainless steel. I just bought a few, the brand is Boots and Barkley. Might wanna check it out"
aveindha25,fdu5xdx,t1_fdrdds5,It‚Äôs called whisker fatigue. Some Cats need shallow dishes or they get overwhelmed.
gregoireclan,fdsjr4x,t1_fdrdds5,Good idea!  My 2 cats share a flat plate but there is always some that gets pushed over the edge.
Userdataunavailable,fdsuu2l,t1_fdrdds5,I literally just put my cats food into a larger flatter dish and they are both binging. Thanks!!!
Pythias,fdtgmyn,t1_fdrdds5,"I agree with this. My little one has the longest whiskers, she would eat in a similar manner but only with one paw not both. So we got her a wide bowl and now she eats from her bowl. Or maybe your little on is just a weirdo, who knows?"
TonytheCatGuy,fdtr0fi,t1_fdrdds5,"Good call, some cats suffer from ""whisker fatigue"", I actually just learned about it a few weeks ago! I put my cats wet food on a plate but had it too close to the wall, I noticed he was acting kinda funny while trying to eat so I moved it 4-5"" away from the wall and he resumed eating without issue."

Randygilesforpres,fdrqoxf,t1_fdrdds5,This. They actually have bowls on amazon to help with this. Poor kitty.
Sardoodledum,fdvbiyr,t1_fdrdds5,"I thought my cat didn't like his whiskers touching the bowl, so I got him a dish.  He still eats with his paws.  I like to tease him and tell him it's too bad he doesn't have thumbs otherwise I'd give him a fork."
pianistonstrike,fdsdv5e,t1_fdrdds5,"My cats get their food in saucer-like dishes, the rim is only like half an inch tall. One has no problem with it, the other either scoops the food out with her paw or takes a piece, turns her head, and eats it over the floor. I think she's just weird."
PrincessCritterPants,fds2qoz,t1_fdrql1b,"My cat likes to turn into a feeding-loaf when it‚Äôs meal time. The bowls are elevated, but he‚Äôs a big cat (and also never misses a nap), so I guess it‚Äôs the optimal feeding position for him?"
Who_GNU,fdso0ul,t1_fdrql1b,"I have my cats' food bowls elevated, mostly to make it more difficult for ants or rodents to happen across it.

Once, while cleaning, I put the food bowl on the ground, and turned away for a minute, only to come back to the cat crouching on the elevated platform, eating from the food bowl that was on the ground.

I swear cats find the most inconvenient way to do anything they do."
trustmeimahuman,fdt5ojr,t1_fdrql1b,"I tried to do that with my 12 year old boy. He's a big kitty and I thought he's getting old and he has a long way to bend down, so I'll put this bowls up for him.

Ganzuul,fdsabyc,t1_fdrtxyg,"They do seem to mimic what they see.

What ever are cats?"
mcfartso,fdsc1qo,t1_fdrtxyg,"I would try a puzzle feeder, gives them something to paw the food from before eating it. It has plenty of uses, usually to slow down pets who scarf their food, but it‚Äôs also great enrichment for cats who eat like this."
ppw23,fdt18im,t1_fdrtxyg,"I had a cat that would put his food on the floor and eat it, just not in the bowl. Maybe it was a whisker thing. He had a huge head."
EFCFrost,fdugmea,t1_fdrtxyg,He is definitely a weird cat. He also bats his food around the house for fun.
zyphelion,fdsiifs,t1_fds7c49,but the cat lifted the food up from the floor. the ultimate shallow and wide dish
VWVWVXXVWVWVWV,fdtarj6,t1_fds7c49,Interesting. Is that why cats cry for you to fill their bowl if there‚Äôs food in it but only a little down at the bottom?
EFCFrost,fdugt7y,t1_fdsad3u,We‚Äôve tried him on other bowls and plates and he still does this. When he‚Äôs actually hungry he‚Äôll mash his face in the bowl and eat like a dog.

RedHairThunderWonder,fdspxb8,t1_fds2qoz,"My oldest (biggest) girl does this with our water bowl. No matter what kind of bowl we use, even the ones that autorefil, she will hunker down with her front legs wrapped around it and when she's not drinking will just rest her head on it and yell at my dogs when they walk by. She also likes to drink by dipping a paw in while she is laying down and then licking her paw. Probably so she doesn't have to get up to take a drink. She's just the best."

Viper9087,fdua5mk,t1_fds8cma,"Cats are carnivores, and it is naturally unhealthy to drink water from near a dead carcass.   
   
So the issue is not that the water is in a bowl, but that the bowl is next to the food and the glass is not.   
   
I keep our cat's water bowl on the coffee table, and they love it.   
   
Or they just drink out of our glass.

dancer15,fdtbd0n,t1_fds9tzf,"One of my cats does this if I have the sink running or let her in the bathroom while I'm taking a bath.  Kind of annoying when I'm trying to relax in my bath and getting splashed because she keeps flicking her wet paw at my face.  She like dunks it, flicks it off, and then sucks.  I have to be holding my glass if I have an open glass of water for the same reason.  As soon as I set it down it belongs to her!"
h4ppy60lucky,fdtl5qp,t1_fds9tzf,Ugh my cat ~~died~~ does his with any glass of milk. He always shakes his paw and gets it everywhere
sweetmaklebs,fdscrk9,t1_fdsbwji,Or a meow-garita glass? üòÇ
SmokeAbeer,fdsd3mf,t1_fdsbwji,These cats are definitely classier than I am.
thestralcounter44,fdsczdr,t1_fdsacon,Plastic can give them zits from the moisture and irritation.  They are very sensitive animals.
SmokeAbeer,fdsaw7q,t1_fdsacon,"Hmm, ceramic. Just like a cereal bowl. They‚Äôre both still kittens basically. About 4 months. Always have a few glasses of water around and just let them drink out of them cause it was cute. Then they got used to it I guess."
doneroamin,fdsdsk8,t1_fdsbgxa,Our cat does that too.
PrincessCritterPants,fdsn62t,t1_fdsbgxa,"It‚Äôs the best <3 I thought my beast was doing it one day (from the dog‚Äôs water dish), but it turned out he was ‚Äòdigging‚Äô in the water before drinking it, and splashed a lot of the water out of the bowl from doing so. Despite the mess, it was still pretty cute since he would leave his paw/leg in the water while drinking."
TheGT1030MasterRace,fdsv94h,t1_fdsbgxa,My cat does that too!
EFCFrost,fdug8id,t1_fdsbgxa,Lacy does that too. He‚Äôll also bat his food around the house and chase it.
bearillusions,fdtdo8t,t1_fdsclyw,Mine too! He'll even run to the washroom when we go in that general direction and meow on the counter waiting for us to turn the tap on.
PrincessCritterPants,fdu3wux,t1_fdtbd0n,"Haha ughh so bad but so cute! I‚Äôm always worried they‚Äôre going to fall in, or that the other will come along and push the other in. You glass situation reminds me of something my friend (that I house sat for) told me. One day, her husband left his glass of water unattended. Spice comes along, has some water, and goes on her merry way. She was mad/annoyed at him, so she didn‚Äôt say anything about it! She decided he deserved it as he drank from the glass üò≥"

I guess you mean your cat does this. :-)"
macphile,fdsd1ch,t1_fdscrk9,"I was kind of picturing the cat like, ""Bitch, I asked for ice?""

My cats get water in a bowl with a fish on the bottom of it. They also drink from my own glass, if they happen to be sitting there. It's all good, I guess.

Also, I just flashed on this [SNL bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9Tn3F9sWNs)."
TheWrongTap,fdsfx7l,t1_fdsczdr,"Really? Oh no, my cat's favourite drinking bowl is the plastic tub i use to do my fish tank water changing (It usually has some dechlorinated tap water in there). She has to stand in the water with her paws to get to it. She also eats like OP's cat sometimes, while we are on the subject. Should i be concerned?"
PartyPorpoise,fdtluyl,t1_fdsczdr,"One of my cats gets this. And if she has the zits, we have to use Stridex pads (like, the ones made for people) and she makes such a big fuss about it."
TahoeSnow,fdtx54i,t1_fdsdsk8,So does one of ours! And here I thought she was a total weirdo.
Doiihachirou,fdtqbub,t1_fdtdo8t,"Mine has like 3 different water bowls. She's offended at those and would rather drink from anywhere else. Spilled water on the floor (she'll be the one to spill it), a puddle, the toilet (trained my brothers to close the lid, finally!!), and even my wet hair from the shower. But her nice fresh bowl with a little ice cube in it on hot summer days?? Ew wtf!? No!"
h4ppy60lucky,fdvb2c8,t1_fdu8fp1,Oh man yes. Still happily alive
SmokeAbeer,fdsfmf8,t1_fdsd1ch,"Hah, when he smears it with his finger. Good plating is like half of the meal."
thestralcounter44,fdsgagq,t1_fdsfx7l,No. Probably not if you don‚Äôt notice irritation.  I guess he must like the remnants of any salty fish water if there is some.  lol.
thestralcounter44,fdtn6og,t1_fdtluyl,I had a hairless who did and I switched bowls and it went away. We just kept it clean I didn‚Äôt use the zit cream cause it stung too much.

anonymousforever,fdrwwwk,t1_fdr4ydz,Try a flatter dish. Some cats hate their whiskers touching the sides of a container while eating. Put a few kibbles on a flat saucer and see what he does.
ayzee93,fds041c,t1_fdr4ydz,Or maybe he's the start of the next evolutionary step for cats.
STINKY-BUNGHOLE,fdsc8u3,t1_fdr4ydz,It's likely whisker fatigue. I'd get a frisbee shaped bowl if I were you

EFCFrost,fdr62yg,t1_fdr544t,"His name is Lacy. We were told he was female when we picked him up as a kitten. 

One day he sprouted testicles and we just kept the name."
esoteric_milkshake,fds929i,t1_fdrwwwk,"> Some cats hate their whiskers touching the sides of a container while eating.   


Ahhhhh, so that is why our cat won't eat treats from a bowl. He gets his treats on the countertop (the bar is his and only his, and to return respect, he doesn't go on any other countertops). He likes eating treats directly from the countertop. If I try to put it in a bowl (for cleanliness) he just smacks it down. He's so not having it. Lol"
esoteric_milkshake,fdrdhak,t1_fdr62yg,"Does it happen often that they misgender a kitten? I was wondering because husband wants to introduce a female kitten as a companion to our male cat, to avoid potential hostility."
kitkat9000take5,fdrwxp5,t1_fdr62yg,"Years ago, my brother brought home a cat he rescued. He said it was a girl. I thought she was pregnant and took her to the vet for a general checkup (she'd been with the family at this point for about three days). The vet told me it was a male with small testicles. OK. Didn't agree, but didn't argue.

Two weeks later ""his"" belly popped- nope, vet was *very* wrong, ""he's"" definitely a ""she"". Turns out, it wasn't small testicles so much as enlarged labia. 

She gave birth to five kittens. We kept 2, gave 3 up for adoption and got everyone fixed.

But first, we switched vets."
mmebonjour,fdrt21w,t1_fdr62yg,"Similar story happened to my cousin and I. She got a cat, thought it was a girl and named it Tinkerbell (Tink for short). Cat wandered off and started staying at my house (we live right down the street from each other). Tink started meowing much like a male cat, and I finally got a chance to see Tink‚Äôs junk, and turns out she was a male. So we had a male cat named Tinkerbell. My dad wanted to change his name to Tank, but I didn‚Äôt like that."
neutral-mente,fds6jjb,t1_fdr62yg,I love opposite sex names. Lacy is a good one. Growing up I had a female mouse named Ralph.
Ohmesone,fds6qvz,t1_fdr62yg,Didn‚Äôt think it was possible to find scrotum adorable. Now that I have the visual of ‚Äúkitten sprouting testicles‚Äù in my mind‚Äôs eye the world will never be the same.
sharkusilly,fdsbsvw,t1_fdr62yg,He just wanted to be Lancy
djmattyd,fdsbv57,t1_fdr62yg,I have sisters named Lenny and Logan. Honestly once they are fixed being a he or a she is kind of irrelevant.
SuspiciousPeppermint,fdsbz51,t1_fdr62yg,"Opposite thing happened with my cat Bowie! We genuinely could not tell if she was a male or female, until we dropped her off to get fixed and she came back with a lil nick on her tummy."
TheLittleKicks,fdseifw,t1_fdr62yg,I have a male cat named Phoebe for the same reason.  I usually call him Pheebs.
CaliCheezHed,fdsul9v,t1_fdr62yg,Omg.  We have a calico that eats the same way on occasion.   Her name is Lacy after a former NFL running back.
Rose1323,fdt3slu,t1_fdr62yg,I have a female cat named George for this reason too but opposite.
ScoopOKarma,fdrg2b7,t1_fdrdhak,The (opposite direction) same thing happened to my brother which is why his female cat is named Paul.
EFCFrost,fdrfxv3,t1_fdrdhak,Nah. I just took their word without checking under the skirt.
wheelfoot,fdrzmjh,t1_fdrdhak,Two neutered males will be a better pair than a male and a female.
Catharas,fdrj8wg,t1_fdrdhak,It's hard with kittens
Katzimir_Malevich,fdrl336,t1_fdrdhak,I dare say it happens very vey very frequently. I've had at least 4 cats who we were told were girls and ended up being boys.
MinimumExamination8,fds2njj,t1_fdrdhak,"I've found that males get along better with other males than females do with other females, but cats are all unique and you just have to hope for the best.  Generally the older cats are good with the kittens because they aren't threatened by a kitten.  My cat loves other cats, of any gender, even loves dogs.  Some cats just have better social skills, I guess."
countrylemon,fdrsik5,t1_fdrdhak,honestly getting a year old male will be easier on a male cat than a female kitten would be. Male cats are easier to bond.
scarlett_butler,fds15u7,t1_fdrdhak,My female cat took weeks to warm up to my male kitten! But they're best buds now üòä
estili,fds2qmt,t1_fdrdhak,"It honestly depends on the individual personalities of the cats. I‚Äôve had it go either way, and sometimes it takes longer than others for them to be marginally friendly, or at least not hostile. At the end of the day just go slow and do your integration research and hope for the best."
_tarasbulba,fdscjhf,t1_fdrdhak,We got a female kitten and named her RuPaul. She went to get spayed and then we found out actually she'd been a man the whole time. No joke.
BellerophonM,fds3e7z,t1_fdrdhak,"Eh, two boys usually get along in my experience. It's two females that usually has a bit of friction. Either way, if one comes in as a kitten it's fine as long as the existing cat isn't extremely anti-cat."
Pizzagurl1994,fds6w97,t1_fdrdhak,My aunt and uncle have a cat that was misgendered. His name is Arletta but we use she/her pronouns cuz my cousins were very little when they got him and grew up thinking he was a she.
CaptainSmoker,fdsca5f,t1_fdrdhak,"Yes, for the same reason as OP my friends male cat is named Precious."
MyzMyz1995,fds59r5,t1_fdrdhak,"2 male cat is usually better than 1 male and 1 female because male cat like to fight until they get a lot older while female cat get tired of playing fighting when they're 4-5 years old, so the cats will be less compatible to play together the older they get."
spicychickeninfinity,fdsiy64,t1_fdrdhak,"The same happened with my kitten but opposite way. Thought she was a male for a while, then one day the vet told me she was a girl. Still kept the name Neptune, but call her Neptunia sometimes lol"
Aliasis,fdsuu12,t1_fdrdhak,"I just adopted a fluffy kitten a few days ago. He is indeed a boy, but when the rescue organization brought him to the vet, they thought he was a girl and literally shaved him and made a surgical cut to start spaying him, before they found his balls..."
hellofascinationn,fdt19in,t1_fdrdhak,"I worked at an animal shelter for a little while. Sexing kittens is really not difficult once they reach a few weeks of age, assuming you know what to look for. Someone inexperienced could mix them up, and every once in a while a mistake could happen."
I_am_the_flower_lord,fdtisf7,t1_fdrdhak,"I don't know if it is entirely true, but when we wanted to adopt a sister for our Ghost, they told us that actually male-male relationships are usually the best, as they won't fight much. Female-male are medium, and female-female are the worst. They said that as long as you have space big enough for both of them to not fight over it (with shelfs or cat houses so they're not entirely on floor level), male-male are best with each other.

We still adopted a girl, and judging by their relationship now, I think it would actually be better if we adopted her brother, because he seemed like more shy, timid one. She's a little princess and tries to steal the spotlight everytime. Now she and Ghost get jealous of each other and actually fight over who will sleep closer to us (she wins because she's smaller and can sleep on my chest lol).

As to the actual question - Ghost for almost 3 months was Lilith, even though he went trough 2 different vets and was ""inspected"" by an avid cat. So yeah, it can happen, and I'd imagine it's really common."

PensiveObservor,fds51no,t1_fdrzmjh,"In feral cats, small family groups of females tend to form, rejecting males. I have three females, however, two of whom have always been best buddies.

He was ill at 12 and they were separated and never got on again,  but the big boy lived to 19 1/2 in my computer room.  Both utter sweeties.  BFFs before the one got ill too.

However, the cat bowl is where he deposits any toy he has completed playing with. Hairties, dead moles, and once a bunny that was around the same size he was.  Once this thing is in the bowl (with the exception of the bunny, it didn't fit), he will then refuse to eat because there is an obstruction in his bowl. 

He's a thin guy, he has food issues. He also refuses to eat pate or any flavor of food other than seafood. If he doesn't like what he has been served, he will sit and meow piteously at me because he's starving and I haven't fed him."

purest_blue_nugget,fdvgo9k,t1_fduhgkp,Definitely made the video more amusing
vivacious_mermaid,fds0y5i,t3_emuo1h,are you sure that's not a squirrel?
Turtle_Sensei,fds588z,t3_emuo1h,"I think our cats might be related.

Boney (Bonito) likes to have me throw a piece of food across the floor and skip it like a stone, he'll then chase it down and munch it up!

His little brother Butters has no idea what's going on and always tries to chase down the food, and when he realizes it's just regular food and not a treat, he glares at both me and Boney!"
EFCFrost,fduhd9q,t1_fds588z,Lacy has been known to do this as well.

EFCFrost,fdsht8c,t1_fdsfya4,lol you‚Äôre welcome.
sailororgana,fds0u74,t3_emuo1h,"Have you tried getting wider/flatter dishes? Cat whiskers are very sensitive and when they touch the sides of a food/water bowl too much they get whisker fatigue. Your kitty may be trying to avoid that.

CultEscaped,fds1fmh,t3_emuo1h,I wonder how he ever finishes a meal?  Lol. I also wonder if he was raised by a raccoon?  A neighborhood raccoon seemed to have a kitty with it's other baby.  You could hear the little meow.

_Throwaway9989,fdtftl1,t3_emuo1h,Aw that cat thinks it's a human.
Dontyouclimbtrees,fdtpt60,t3_emuo1h,To add onto what others have said about alternative ways to feed your kitty; you could try getting a feeding ball that you fill with the food and it has little holes that‚Äôs the food slowly falls out of while they push it around. We had to do that for my cat because he eats too quickly and gets sick.
realcats,fdtrn2u,t3_emuo1h,"I had a cat that used to eat like this until we started serving him on a dish. Whiskey fatigue is real and probably sucks. But I think he was also just picky, wouldn't drink out of anything unless it was glass"

willows54,fdvrqjs,t3_emuo1h,"lol, funny kitty ..:)"
0fiuco,fdwlfk9,t3_emuo1h,it must take forever to finish his meal
Boomersgang,fdsgg0l,t3_emuo1h,"Kitty may have whisker fatigue. It's a real thing, when their whiskers touch the bowl they eat from  it makes the whiskers very sensitive. I have had a few cats with it. A more shallow open bowl is the best fix."
radiobaby,fdtc8d5,t1_fdsgg0l,I hope they see this comment.
Boomersgang,fdtcwhe,t1_fdtc8d5,"Thanks, me too. It's a weird thing, but it's true."
EFCFrost,fduh9ms,t1_fdtc8d5,I‚Äôve seen it and the dozens just like it lol. He is normally just fine with his bowl. He just does this when he‚Äôs bored.
radiobaby,fdte9y9,t1_fdtcwhe,"Yeah, if it's is a regular occurance as they implied, I'd defintiely change the bowls. Could also be he's uncomfortable with the bowl on the floor for some reason, maybe a little riser would be in order as well."
Boomersgang,fdtelus,t1_fdte9y9,"Yes, that can help too."

Nate_Calman,fdt61bh,t3_emuo1h,"He has very good manners, I see."
captaincj2005,fdt62ak,t3_emuo1h,That cat eats like a raccoon.
SickViking,fdt6ai0,t3_emuo1h,Was he raised by raccoons?
Sketchy_Uncle,fdt6gcx,t3_emuo1h,"Me: man... That's odd.
My 7 year old: No! It's good.  They're finally learning our human way."
Dolpenis,fdt6qi2,t3_emuo1h,"My cat drinks water with his paw, very amusing, but when he catches us looking at him he just walks away ignoring us for the rest of the day"
theSourestPower,fdt75gw,t3_emuo1h,r/notlikemostcats
weepingjordan,fdt7kmt,t3_emuo1h,He eats it like how raccoons eat their food
kachipoirier,fdt8agj,t3_emuo1h,Part otter
Tup00,fdta1vv,t3_emuo1h,U know I read because whiskers hit the high borders of the (wrongly made) bowls and it hurts them a lot. Whiskers having all the nervous termination.... let me find the explanation in the bowl (I‚Äôll put the name of it and the link so you can see what I mean and look for it and get the infos yourself....) so it‚Äôs gonna be clearer. Bottom line though: get LOW OPEN kind of bowls for cats cos whiskers are oversensitive and the ones you have there hurt the cats while eating. That‚Äôs why they took the food out. To ease the pain and discomfort. I learned this lately too and I‚Äôm trying to make this common knowledge to help our furry friends. (Bowls makers should study the physical cats traits better though!!)
Hanook,fdtagaj,t3_emuo1h,"*cue Gollum voice* 

Cat: my precious!"
dancer15,fdtaw8e,t3_emuo1h,"My kitty pushes a piece of food out of her bowl and then chases it around the room.  She will push it away from her so it continues to slide around, and then after chasing it a while she finally eats the one piece.  She only eats her food after chasing it a while.  Somehow she's still chunky, though.  

I just always wonder where cats learn this stuff?  I know they are born to hunt, but you would think that domestication would have taken that out of them."
Jamesybo555,fdtb34j,t3_emuo1h,Has he been around squirrels?
thatstraycat,fdtbozq,t3_emuo1h,It‚Äôs a squirrel in disguise xD
KaizokuShojo,fdtby8r,t3_emuo1h,I wonder if he has whisker fatigue or if he's just bored and likes the play/catch/nom aspect! So adorable. I bet he'd like one of those puzzle feeder balls.
VenomousPlaty,fdted4f,t3_emuo1h,Omg. That‚Äôs so cute. I was going to ask if you tried raised bowls?  Maybe kitty prefers that?
Crowgurrl,fdtedz6,t3_emuo1h,"Reggie my big boy kitty loves to play with his kibble.  He pulls it out of the bowl with a paw & then chases it around.  When he catches it he eats it just like prey.  Don't think it is whisker fatigue cause he eats it out of the bowl too.

My old girl GiGi (she is 17 plus) loves a cup of water on the kitchen counter.  Just a bit spoiled since I hate to see her jump down if she does't need to.  

That is my two kids funny behavior that we just love."
Sybaritee,fdtffix,t3_emuo1h,Cats are sensitive to plastic so metal or ceramic bowls are preferred. The bowls should be wider than their whiskers but shallow.
iyote6,fdtfkg3,t3_emuo1h,"My cat will eat normally from his own bowl, but he'll eat like this from my other cats' bowls.  I'm pretty sure he thinks he's being sneaky that way."
May-Ng,fdtg1jd,t3_emuo1h,Your cat can also use chopsticks?
mssarac,fdtg1uk,t3_emuo1h,Maybe she wants to go on a dietüòÅ
queencatmother,fdtgb56,t3_emuo1h,That‚Äôs how he stays so skinny. Remind me to start slapping my food before I eat it
EFCFrost,fduaxy3,t1_fdtgb56,Maybe but he‚Äôs also quite large. He‚Äôs double the size of our older cat.
vanshika_g,fdti5pj,t3_emuo1h,Like a little monkey ü§≠ü§≠
tawyy,fdtj59s,t3_emuo1h,I feel like this cat learned that by watching the owners
flyfaraway23,fdtjfca,t3_emuo1h,Omg he's a raccoon!! üòç
Gameboy152,fdtkhci,t3_emuo1h,Cats are evolving.
SangestheLurker,fdtlymn,t3_emuo1h,"Have you tried a treat ball, the kind that needs to be rolled around to let the food out? (Sry if mentioned already.)"
mc408,fdtnmzd,t3_emuo1h,"Exercise negates the calories, right? :-)"

WHlTERABBlT,fdtvrgf,t3_emuo1h,u/hayls2018
Dom-au-lykos,fdtxb2y,t3_emuo1h,Maybe was raised by raccoons. They eat a very similar way
zenmaster1969,fdu2bbg,t3_emuo1h,I‚Äôm not going to show this to my cat cuz she‚Äôs a copy cat ü§£
BunnyRider2,fdu7dn6,t3_emuo1h,Did you guys breed him? It‚Äôs evolution in front of us
EFCFrost,fduhxdv,t1_fdu7dn6,Nah. Got him from an old farmer just outside our city.
pauloosanz,fdu8zms,t3_emuo1h,"This is another level cat, really kind one!"
jpGrind,fducce5,t3_emuo1h,"unlikely that this cat will ever have a weight problem

and that is a reincarnated soul having problems adjusting"
Joeschmo2000,fdumslm,t3_emuo1h,Lol
t0mmyboy68,fdvjw8q,t3_emuo1h,That cat needs thumbs for Christmas.
Maroulax,fdvuw6v,t3_emuo1h,"I've seen cats doing this for so many years, but why they does that ?"
nguyenvietdungntt,fdw0y7c,t3_emuo1h,eating directly by mouth is impolite :)

hugsanddrugs42,fe8yi9g,t3_emuo1h,Good kitty cat.
AbyssalKultist,fds5htz,t3_emuo1h,"Cute, but as the others have said this could be due to whisker fatigue. 
He might be more comfortable eating from a plate."
Colszy,fds4lg5,t3_emuo1h,Whisker fatigue?
NerdCat131,el9s7k,top_level,
nomopyt,fdghses,t3_el9s7k,That is a rare full loaf! My cat doesn't typically hide both paws like that when catloafing.
Vampyre_Lilith,fdgqrnx,t1_fdghses,My 6.5lbs cat Emily does this and just looks like a very disgruntled slipper on the floor.
drmonix,fdgz5ez,t1_fdghses,Both my cats hide one paw and keep another paw fully extended when loafing.
Hrolfir,fdh089x,t1_fdghses,Mine looks more akin to a pancake or one of those animal throw rugs with the head. His fur and slight loose belly just spread out and flatten like melted butter.
WoahThereFelix,fdh66z2,t1_fdghses,"I never knew the term was ""loaf"" my cat does this all the time and I just call it chicken. Because it looks like a chicken nesting an egg."
wwphoenix1,fdgz08u,t1_fdghses,my cat always becomes a fluff loaf
shrubberypig,fdh31kg,t1_fdghses,Old enough to stop giving a damn
boobsshmoobsss,fdh7oq1,t1_fdghses,"My super fluffy big guy does this constantly and I refer to him as ‚ÄúChicken Chunk‚Äù (his name is Chunk) :)

This post makes me so happy to see - my bubs are both 10 years old and I need them around for another 10+ years!"
anonbabii,fdhli8m,t1_fdghses,I have an orange tabby and he looks like a rotisserie chicken when he does this
bballkj7,fdiqvp3,t1_fdghses,"The only loaf is a full loaf.  
Except for half loafs, semi-half lazy loafs, one paw out loafs, dabbing cat loafs, and whole grain wheat bread loafs."
NerdCat131,fdgzqk7,t1_fdgqrnx,Disgruntled slipper on the floor...I can just picture this! Hehe
nomopyt,fdgrb3z,t1_fdgqrnx,My cat is three Emilys... He does it too but usually you can still see his cat arms.
AnyDayGal,fdh5n4w,t1_fdgqrnx,A beautiful and vivid description.
Squarmptin,fdhcxqb,t1_fdgqrnx,I love that you used the word disgruntled!
cuppiecakex8,fdi2zbp,t1_fdgqrnx,"We call our cat a rotisserie when he does this. A little morbid, but it's cute :)"
Squarmptin,fdhd1rz,t1_fdgz5ez,Same
felinetattoo,fdhgns5,t1_fdh66z2,I say this too! I always call her a little hen and ask if she‚Äôs keeping her eggs warm. üòπ
awkwardpaige26,fdhlupn,t1_fdh66z2,"My roommates cat is 18lbs. When he loafs, I call him a thanksgiving day turkey bc he looks SO big & could feed a 10 person family üòÇ"
Vampyre_Lilith,fdi34b7,t1_fdi2zbp,Ha. We call Emily a fat b!tch all the time. It's her nickname because all she does is eat!
Evenyx,fdgna68,t3_el9s7k,"Whoa, Could just be this angle but she doesn't look like a senior cat! Super duper cute tho"
NerdCat131,fdgzz4b,t1_fdgna68,"She certainly knows how to strike a good pose! 
You can certainly see she's not a kitten anymore but I just adore that little face"
kaydunlap,fdhz4xz,t1_fdgna68,Some cats seriously don't age! My old lady cat was a young adult when I got her... 15 years ago! She's only ~6lbs so people are always surprised that she isn't a kitten. I also have a rescue kitty who was estimated to be 5-8 when I got him... 9 years ago. You wouldn't know it by looking at him.
brownishgirl,fdhyppk,t1_fdgzz4b,/r/seniorcats would be as impressed as I am! Gorgeous girl.
salomey5,fdj776a,t1_fdgzz4b,"How could you not, she's adorable!"
Blackletterdragon,fdgeukk,t3_el9s7k,And she wears it well.
sadgirl45,fdgk8be,t3_el9s7k,What do you feed your cat if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? Also do they get there teeth cleaned etc!!
NerdCat131,fdgkv0p,t1_fdgk8be,"She gets a mix of wet and dry food, dry food is for senior cats but nothing special otherwise. We're checking her teeth regularly too.

She used to be a feral cat but is with us now for 20 years. No idea how old she was when she moved in with us"
black_white_cats,fdgu5u5,t1_fdgk8be,"Yes, teeth are important. My mom had a very old cat, and he has huge tartar in his mouth. She did not brush her teeth."
jus7g0nnakms,fdglyd9,t1_fdgkv0p,"That‚Äôs crazy! She‚Äôs a fighter for sure, what a badass cat!"
pinkr0se,fdgqdx8,t1_fdgkv0p,"my vet stressed the importance of dental care with my cat as well! I don't hesitate to take that advice after seeing this, thank you for sharing!"
sadgirl45,fdgq7qg,t1_fdgkv0p,I ask because I‚Äôd like to extend my baby‚Äôs life! does she get cleanings did she get any through her life?
sadgirl45,fdi7pes,t1_fdgu5u5,Yeah I‚Äôll get his cleaning done but I‚Äôm going to be a nervous wreck
RedditLostOldAccount,fdh9a8j,t1_fdgqdx8,Any tips on making sure it's all good? I'd love for my girl to be around that long. I love her more than anything.
NerdCat131,fdhs85q,t1_fdgq7qg,"Only very rarely to be honest. I think in 20 years we brought her to the vet twice...once when she finally had enough trust in us so we could bring her to the vet to get neutered (she was feral before and had quite a few kittens...all in our backyard! We homed the kittens once they were old enough but were running out of friends/family who wanted cats. So that trip to the vet was a blessing, also for her) and then recently when she had an ear infection. Other than that she's in good shape."
pinkr0se,fdheno1,t1_fdh9a8j,"Mine is still a kitten but I just picked up a dental care kit for cats, I think most pet stores have them. My boy hates the taste of the toothpaste I got tho, it smells a little like cream of chicken soup, so I try to do it when hes more worn out and less likely to wiggle away lmao. I make sure to give him treats when im done too. My vet said you really only need to worry about brushing the outside."
RedditLostOldAccount,fdhgh45,t1_fdheno1,Thanks! I'll have to look out for that. I appreciate you
annjolly,fdgnqv5,t3_el9s7k,She wouldn‚Äôt stay if she wasn‚Äôt happy!
NerdCat131,fdgo0ri,t1_fdgnqv5,Nowadays she's 99% of the time indoors. Preferring the warmth of her favourite spot to the outside
S2560,fdgnbek,t3_el9s7k,r/catloaf
Berk-Laydee,fdgxlec,t1_fdgnbek,I didn't even know this was a thing. I'm already obessed with this subreddit. Thanks for this.
S2560,fdgy6r4,t1_fdgxlec,There's that many cat subreddits you could make several of those one-a-day calendars out of them
Berk-Laydee,fdgyf87,t1_fdgy6r4,"I know I'm on many of them. It keeps me from actually aching to get a cat. 

I'd love to have a cat, and so would my bf but he is allergic. So this is the next best thing. We laugh at all of the asshole cats."
anaspis,fdh9ohr,t1_fdgyf87,you can always go hairless üòâ
kay_knox,fdhqo4m,t1_fdh9ohr,I don't think her waxing is going to convince the boyfriend if he's very allergic.
Berk-Laydee,fdk34gf,t1_fdh9ohr,"Unfortunately, he doesn't find that breed particularly cute like I do. Besides, it won't help much because he's allergic to their saliva."
anaspis,fdhymkr,t1_fdhqo4m,no doubt. it‚Äôs not worth make an SO uncomfortable. i was more joking than anything else
anaspis,fdkddjs,t1_fdk34gf,that‚Äôs understandable. good luck to you guys :)
Berk-Laydee,fdne8ap,t1_fdkddjs,"Thanks. He acts like a cat from time to time, so that does help and makes me laugh."

Machikoneko,fdgqc67,t3_el9s7k,All seniors have that wise look about them.  She's no exception.  :)
TacticalGuy64,fdh1q7b,t1_fdgqc67,She knows everything
deadlymanager,fdgqcrx,t3_el9s7k,hope it goes another 20 :)
lRoninlcolumbo,fdh9fq0,t1_fdgqcrx,That would make everything right if cats lived another 20 years more now. These little runts live too short and l hate that lol
Purplekittens88,fdgtvpe,t3_el9s7k,Makes me happy to see that! My baby is 14 and still looks good for her age. Just found out she‚Äôs in the first stages of renal disease but as long as she does well with preventative care I‚Äôll keep her around for a good bit longer :)
macphile,fdhmy7k,t1_fdgtvpe,"One of mine is 14, and you'd never know it. I got him when he was 1, and he hasn't changed at all. Not in looks, not in activity level, nothing. His only health issues have been a clogged ureter and occasional herpes flare-ups. 

Meanwhile, his sister (more newly acquired) is like 6 and has been in and out of the vet with dental problems, not eating, etc., and she's not been using the box properly for a while. Sigh."

purple_dragon_9,fdgtlrx,t3_el9s7k,"Woah, doesn't look 20 to me! If you told me this was a younger cat I would have believed you."
Guided_Wolfram,fdgsyqe,t3_el9s7k,Man I hate when cats get older cause it means they have less time to spend with me
guoheng,fdgvhhv,t3_el9s7k,"What is your secret for her longevity, besides food and dental care that you mentioned? Mine both just turned 4 and they are both in prime health, but I can't help but start to wonder about what I can do to make sure I can have as many more years with them as I would like."
NerdCat131,fdhsily,t1_fdgvhhv,"She's always been low maintenance, there's no secret I'm afraid (other than unlimited pets and belly rubs, but that goes without saying). Guess we were just lucky with her!"
majeric,fdgzirw,t3_el9s7k,That cat has a painting of itself somewhere in an attic that‚Äôs aging.
TheRealRoybot,fdh1bdf,t3_el9s7k,This cat is older than me (about to graduate high school). Let the longevity of this absolute cutie pie set in.

1plus1equalsfun,fdhh28w,t3_el9s7k,"Wow, he looks so healthy and appears much younger than he actually is. By the time our last cat (always indoors) reached 15, he slowed right down, the fur around his mouth and eyes had gone white, and he got so thin that it was like petting a washboard.

Glad to see this guy is chugging along so well."
thundersprite,fdhh75g,t3_el9s7k,"I hope that my cat is like this, too. She means the absolute world to my husband and I and the thought of losing her is too much. She has so much anxiety, though, that I feel like her being stressed all the time will shorten her lifespan alone."
shad0w19,fdhkn9e,t3_el9s7k,"Looking very good, beautiful and healthy. My baby cat looked exactly like yours, he just died last month at 16, he left us all of a sudden and looked perfectly healthy 2 days before. Give your cat a big hug from me please."

reiiayanami,fe7rs2d,t1_fe2ijx3,"My old cat would sit on the edge of my bed and make petting gestures into empty air with her paws whenever I had to get dressed for work. She didn‚Äôt pet her own head, but it was still sickeningly adorable."
SsweetDixie,fe5s9ay,t1_fe5ixxn,Mine just slams her head into the ground
fightwithgrace,fe6aszl,t1_fe5ixxn,"I know, right? My littlest one wants constant attention (he‚Äôs 5 months old) and just climbs on my lap then gets his hooks in so I can‚Äôt remove him until he is satisfied with the exact number of pets I‚Äôve given him. Otherwise, a good bit of my skin along will be removed along with him.

His ‚Äúbrother‚Äù is much more aloof, but will allow a few head pats if you humble yourself and approach him at his perch and show proper reverence first. But he ‚Äúasks‚Äù for nothing, he gives very clear orders. He does show some love for his baby bro, though, and will occasionally allow him to share a nap in one of his little caves.
(He is a rescue Bengal, so a domestic/wildcat hybrid that had been dumped for being too...wild. No shelters or rescues in the area accept hybrids, so it was either take him ourselves or have him  euthanized. Both my brothers work for animal rescues and we‚Äôve been rehabilitating feral and stray animals since we were kids, so it was a challenge we felt we could take. And it‚Äôs great, but exotic animals are NOT the same as domesticated pets. We love him, but also respect that he behaves differently than house cats do and work with it. We also installed a lot of perches and climbing trees for him so he can live the best life possible for a partially wild animal in an unnatural habitat.)

Aaaaand I just went on a tangent about my cats that had almost nothing to do with this post OR your comment. I‚Äôm becoming a cat lady... sorry."

Very very religious groups do what they can to hold onto members, even if it means upholding rules that say people who leave can never even speak to their family again. I'm almost positive there's significant abuse in these devout groups because there's kinda no other way to keep it going without at least emotional abuse.

He is an outdoor but now spends 90% at home.
There's even a robin that falls him around our garden and he does nothing. Like he's grown out of chasing birds.

We got him a lead,but he escaped again. 

Sure in an ideal world all cats would remain indoors but they animals and need freedom to see outside.

It would also be beneficial for the cats to stay indoors as they won't fight eachother too."

ItisCrazey,fdprb2e,t1_fdol0vp,"Well we live in a very small village in which all cats are allowed outside. We got her basically from the street of out village and she was already 15 years old. She lived a few more years. Our current  Cat was half a year when we found her on the street. Pregnant. We gave 3/4 kittens another home and kept one. Both are going outside.


Everyone in our village knows whos cat is whos and whos dog us whos.


So if we would have kept her inside not letting her out we would have made them depressed. They stay inside at night and in winter they are home most of the time anyway.


So we would have negligted their wellbeing more then if we would keep them in and never let them out.

Hope that changes your view.

If you haven‚Äôt vaccinated her against feline leukemia you need to get her tested ASAP.  You have no idea what she may have been exposed to outside.  I can tell you, from having watched a beloved cat wither away from that awful disease, this is NOT the fate you want for her.

Edit:  I‚Äôll add this - we discovered his leukemia status when he was super skinny, limping and too weak to jump up on anything.  Stupid naive me thought he was just being lazy.  Please be a responsible pet owner, or don‚Äôt own any damn pets."

It would be amazing to see the lot of you just telling it to her straight. 

I picked up the least obvious solution, not knowing if it was voluntary, but I am of the same opinion regardless. 

Cats should be kept intside if not vaccinated, or if the master does not want them to go for, say, financial reasons such as unwanted, preventable, accidents, which are happening so easily from careless people these days.

I love you reddit cat lovers.

daabilge,fdo5ors,t1_fdo10jf,"Thank you for this - I would also take her to the vet anyway for the injury.

krool1969,fdnvt56,t3_em9sjk,"When I was a kid we had a cat just walk up to me wanting a scratch. I did and the damn thing followed me, right into the house.

Well, this cat had clearly adopted me so I started taking care of it. We took him to the vet, got its shots, had it check for parasites (it had none, unusual for a stray) and just adopted him.

It would come in and sleep in my bed every night.

One day the cat was sitting in the window when my neighbor knocked on the door. Turns out the cat belonged to them. I was sad to see it go, but the cat did belong to them.

An hour later he came back, meowing to be let in. I took the cat home, and it tried following me home again.

The owner just said, ""Well, it looks like he prefers you.""

So I got to keep him in the end. He'd go see his old home sometimes, but the cat was clearly just visiting (usually while I was at school) and it always came back to me.

Cats will do that sometimes. They just decide some day, they'd rather go live with someone else for no reason. Well none we lowly humans can work out.

BittyBaton,fdns3ww,t1_fdnrvy3,"Good.  The practice should be outlawed.  It is cruel and painful and denies kitties the ability to defend themselves, especially cruel if they are not 100% indoor all the time.  We inherited a kitty that the former owner declawed.

TechnoVKNG23,fdnwi4c,t3_em9sjk,"So glad she came back to you! 

My cat was about 2 years old, always waited at the door to my apartment when he ""sensed"" me coming home. Does the same thing now at the garage door. One day he kind of bolted out the door before I could block it and he got spooked and ran into the woods. I looked for him for hours, put out food, put out his box so he could smell it, and couldn't find him. This was at an apartment complex of approximately 500 units or so, and I worked on the property. After about a week of looking I figured he was gone, taken in by someone else, or one of the local owls nabbed him at night. Toward the end of the second week I was showing some prospective residents a unit in the back of the property and heard a cat whining on the 3rd floor...and it was him, trying to get into another apartment because the dingus couldn't find his way back home. Ii apologized to them, but basically said my missing cat was more important, scooped him up and took him in the golf cart back to my place, told him he was in BIG trouble and locked him in the bedroom. Of course when I got home from work he got a bath, food, and all the trimmings. Ever since then he's glued to me at all times and doesn't try to ""escape"" anymore, but I know how much of a relief it is to get your cat back."

Maybe this only happened with my cat but when she went missing for 3 months she came back with some different eating habits. She would eat ANYTHING made of foam.

He was dirty, skinny and frostbitten... but he made it.   Well.. one of his ears didn't and I think he has PTSD... as he totally freaks out when I take the dog out.

I'm a judgemental person when it comes to art and photography and I wouldn't fault this at all, in fact I'd enhance it by digitally importing it and adding a ""film grain"" or ""paintbrush"" effect then get it enlarged and printed as an artistic image of your best friend. :)"

CirrusAviaticus,fdpu29r,t3_emk5c9,Beautiful cat and great picture.
toby_ornautobey,fdpzyd0,t3_emk5c9,That's how I found my best friend. She took refuge in the engine bay of my dad's truck when he drove over it to chase off the ravens attacking her. She made it ~100 miles in the engine bay before he got home. She's 16 now and sleeping on my hand (her favorite headrest lately) as I write this. I'll love her so much. I'm sure that you two will have just a great a relationship throughout your future years together.

marmaladegrass,fdqe98k,t3_emk5c9,"Went through a break-up, and subsequent bankruptcy...started my life at ground zero in my late 20's.

&#x200B;

If it wasn't for my cats, giving me something to work for, I don't know if I would've survived that.

And for the record, before anyone is concerned, doing a ton better now...the realization that bumps happen in life."

EagleCatchingFish,fecf6w9,t1_feay0cq,Enhance.
karstin1812,fecoig3,t1_feay0cq,Thabk god you did. All I saw in the original image was an ominous shadow with eyes...
fatweakpieceofshit,fec9quj,t1_febp5ho,If only their eyes were smart enough to see brighter
QDKeck,fe9o18e,t3_eo7ydp,Coworkers blind?  That cat is too too cute.
Meme-Master209,feap531,t1_fe9o18e,They just have no taste for adorable cats
JulianoRamirez,feceoh1,t1_fe9o18e,Their co-workers are dogs.
Just-Call-Me-J,febiq9g,t1_fe9o18e,Sort of. It is kind of hard to see the void.
maxk1236,fecg9tm,t1_fe9o18e,"Looks like a soot sprite, haha, all fluff with some eyes. I have a black cat too, and he is really hard to get good pictures of with indoor lighting, I could understand how they might be rather unimpressed with a pic of a vantacat where it pretty much just looks like a black blob. On a related note, black cats are the least adopted because of superstition, adopt a black cat if you can!"
MizShellL,feco7gv,t1_fe9o18e,He is the most adorable floof. I love black cats.

beldaran1224,febftik,t1_fe9vzyb,I'm also confused as to what kind of weird anti-social person doesn't know better than to pretend as if someone's cat/dog/baby/bird is adorable....which is another issue entirely from wondering what kind of person doesn't actually think this cat is adorable.

HaileyandRoccosMom,en1vnn,top_level,
Amacrum,fdt5uy9,t3_en1vnn,Oh congratulations! He looks so desperately happy to be home! How terrifying for everyone
HaileyandRoccosMom,fdt60sw,t1_fdt5uy9,Thank you!  We are so happy to have him home!
pinchecody,fdvi6ze,t1_fdt60sw,So happy you got your kitty back :) I recently found a kitty that is too well fed and friendly to be stray and I just can't stand thinking how worried the owners might be. I'm trying to find them. She is so sweet...I would be very sad if she were mine
JLHumor,fdxyd5e,t1_fdt60sw,Was it pure luck you found him?
HaileyandRoccosMom,fdzmr7x,t1_fdvi6ze,"This is so kind of you.   I hope you are able to find the owners,  even if you don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs good of you to take him in.  Connor got so scrawny and beat up in just 2 months.  I can‚Äôt imagine the life of a cat that lives outside all the time and doesn‚Äôt have a family."
Amacrum,fe0c6mi,t1_fdvi6ze,You would be surprised how many homeless cats do pretty well for themselves staying clean and FAT! And if their associations with people  have been good they can be so loving and grateful for security and home. Even if they've never lived in one or had much interaction with a human. I've seen feral cats everyone was afraid of 'choose' their person and become fluffy docile beacons of love before the gouges they put in my arms have stopped bleeding.. Worked for a long time in a shelter in an area with big feral cat problems.  They are capable of taking care of themselves and just like people some are better than others at taking care of themselves and managing their lives.  Don't stress yourself too much If you can't find a home because there may not be one. And if you're giving her a good home you're at least fulfilling a wish her original family would have for her.
pinchecody,fdzsr5h,t1_fdzmr7x,"Thank you :) yes she just showed up the other day. She had 3 scratches on her nose that had scabbed up and only looked a few days old. I'm guessing it was from the other cats out here, she doesn't seem to like them and stops purring anytime she sees one but I met her while holding my sweet Mittens (who can be kind of a grump) and she is sweet around Mittens but they don't interact. She is really chonky which is part of how I know she isn't wild (and she let's me hold her and kiss her nose which NO wild cat will do) but she seems more interested in seeing me than getting food which is why I imagine she misses her family :( so I've been trying to spend lots of time with her when I can. She will let you hold her as long as you're willing to pet her. I would happily take her in though. Idk if I already said this but coincidentally, I haven't seen the other cat I have in about a week or more :( so that's part of what inspires me to get this one back home but it's also really nice the universe brought her to me for now"
pinchecody,fe0cs65,t1_fe0c6mi,"Wow, that is interesting! See I live in the country right now and there are tons of wild cats that we feed. They hang around because we feed them and none of them are fat, they all look about the same. My other cat has lived outside most of her life but she was spayed and developed the little chub a lot of spayed cats do. A few of these cats will let me pick them up. The younger I start doing it, the better, but otherwise it just seems to all depend on how much they like affection and even ones who have let me hold them still run when I try to pet them. But the more they like affection, the more they let me pet them and the more they trust me. It can take a lot of time and work though but almost all of them scrunch back when I try to kiss them, like they think I'm going to bite. This cat doesn't really do that, she let me pick her up right off the bat and will let me hold her as long as I want. She also stays away from all the wild ones and has a few scratches on her nose so I guess she got in a fight with one. But she seems about as comfortable with me as a domesticated cat but also probably weighs maybe 15 pounds. But I agree, if I do not find her owner or if she doesn't have one, I will happily keep her and be taking her with me when I move (and don't worry, when I move, someone else will still be taking care of all the other wild ones, even though they all could probably survive on their own but some have been getting fed since they were old enough to be independent kittens, so I'm not sure if they could. I guess they would since they still have enough instincts to be wild)"
Amacrum,fe0edlw,t1_fe0cs65,Such a kindred spirit vibe here lol. I just love every word of that‚ô•Ô∏è you're doing such a wonderful thing for those cats.

HaileyandRoccosMom,fdt7nwh,t1_fdt6jx7,"I had joined a Facebook group for ‚ÄúLost and Found Pets‚Äù for my area.  I had made several posts on the group page and in the nextdoor app, as well as putting up several posters in my neighborhood and any neighborhood there was a ‚ÄúConnor sighting.‚Äù  A woman had posted on the Facebook group page and another woman recognized him from my posts and tagged me.  I didn‚Äôt have an exact address, just an area, but I drove there at 11pm and looked for him, calling his name, with a headlamp on and when he heard me he came running and meowing.  I had to jump a fence to get him and then put him over the fence and then jump back over, myself.  He just waited there for me and then I picked him up and he rested his head on my shoulder as I carried him back to my car."

Azar002,fdu662d,t1_fdt7nwh,"That's awesome! Our cat Bailey (in my profile) was missing 7 weeks last April/May and was only 4-5 blocks away. The campaign to find him was tough but worth it. Online postings, paper posters, and a ""pet amber alert"" to my nearest few hundred neighbors really helped. A bunch of people stored my number and called me with sightings. He's all black so I was getting false positives every week, kinda disheartening.. finally one was actually him and I coaxed him out and carried him home. He peed on me a little. >B["
froggyfrogfrog123,fdtk0dx,t1_fdt7nwh,"That us so sweet! I know how exciting this is and how much work it takes to recover a lost pet, especially a cat! 

I‚Äôm impressed he came running when you called him! I don‚Äôt have much experience with lost cats, but lost dogs often go into wild mode and act as if they‚Äôre being hunted when called, so calling their name often makes them run farther away from you. 

I got into helping find lost dogs when my dad lost my parent‚Äôs dog at a reservation land a few miles away from home. I had just graduated and didn‚Äôt have a job yet, so I took on the task of recovering him. The first or so was the hardest because we didn‚Äôt receive a call of a single sighting, it was extremely discouraging. Once the phone calls of sightings started to come in, it became a lot easier because it felt like it was more a matter of when we found him, not if we found him. It took 11 days, like 15+ miles of hiking a day, and around $700 in posters and supplies and food for the trap (and 10 people to help put up posters) and I finally got him back when he hurt his leg and sat on the footsteps of a multimillion dollar mansion (apparently he had great taste) a few miles from where we lost him one day. The landscapers saw some of my posters while out to lunch and called me. I literally cannot imagine 2 months, you must have grieved the loss and everything in that time, how do you keep hope that whole time!"

MongrolSmush,fdut9x1,t1_fdt7nwh,"A lot will already know this but A good tip that I have actually seen work if you lose a cat, put its litter tray and blankets they have slept on or favorite food just outside your house it helps them find their way back through the scent."

I walk into the cat room and hear the loudest cat meow in my life, and he wouldnt stop either.  I turn to look and there he is!!!!

She had crawled underneath a pile of clothes. I was so scared and devastated then immediately relieved. I can‚Äôt dream of going through 2 months of that worry, my fear only lasted an hour. Best Christmas present ever. I kept telling my family that I didn‚Äôt need a single gift after finding her, nothing else mattered. I am so happy you found your cat. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
dancing_apples,fdukxdm,t1_fdtv720,"One of my cats was pregnant close to the very end of her pregnancy she just disappeared one day we only adopted her as a stray a couple months earlier but we loved her. I checked everywhere in the boise thought someone must have let her out and she's gone to give birth outside or something checked the whole street.

Came back in after an hour standing at my front door and heard this faint meow (she has a very quiet meow) thought I was hallucinating so called her name again and I could hear her again coming from one of the steps.

Turned out she went under the stair where we store all our junk. When I pulled everything out there she was with an additional 6 little cats. I was incredibly relieved and happy the she was fine. Cleared the area and made that space up for her kittens (we had another better space for her but she chose the stairs behind an old microwave)."
hugegrape,fdtxjkz,t1_fdtv720,"What a happy ending!

HuhWillThisOneWork,fdw31jw,t1_fdtv720,"A similar thing happened with my cat! My grandfather built a toy box that looks like a train caboose.

Grashley0208,fdw42a7,t1_fdtv720,"We had just moved into this house with a creepy, mostly unfinished basement. We had to have some  workmen come by while we were at work, so my spouse put the cat in the basement. When he got home from work, he couldn‚Äôt find the cat! We looked for hours and hours all over the house and basement. We eventually realized the worker must have gone in the basement, and the cat must have ran out that door and outside somehow. We start looking outside, calling him, looking around our neighbors houses, and no sign of him. 

We are just about to start writing up missing posters for our neighborhood, when we checked the basement one more time and the cat was just chilling in some corner by the hot water heater."

Askye72,fdyl59c,t1_fdyj2kv,"When I first discovered that it was him, I tried, they weren't nasty about wanting to keep them, they just tried convincing me it was a female and they've had it for years (you can see his balls lol) but one of their kids told me later that yes they found him and brought him home around the same time mine went missing, but she was so upset and worried that she'd lose her new kitty, so I'm leaving it be. I'm sure her parents lied because they didn't want their kids upset after falling in love with him. They take good care of him, and by this point there'd be a cat brawl with the 2 I still have lol"
catcatcat8,fdyn38g,t1_fdyl59c,"That‚Äôs such a shame, it doesn‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôre overly upset about it and I‚Äôm also glad they take care of him, so at least there‚Äôs that"
Askye72,fdyozbq,t1_fdyn38g,"This was years ago, I'm not as upset now as I was, I'm more worried for Loki, because even though he looked healthy, I can't determine if he has a home and I haven't been able to trap him :("
LollyHutzenklutz,fdtx00u,t3_en1vnn,"So happy for you and Connor... and it gives me a sliver of hope, since my sweet boy [Oswald](https://imgur.com/a/1y64l5z) has been missing for exactly 4 months now.

It‚Äôs probably false hope (as we have mountain lions & coyotes around our property), but even so, it warms my heart to see this. If nothing else, just to know that another missing cat was reunited with their family. Please give him a kiss from me. üíï"
urkel_psp,fdwcoe2,t1_fdtx00u,"My Crash has also been missing for about 4 months I think. We have coyotes and hawks/eagles around, so I also have some false hope. But since he went missing I‚Äôve heard so many people say ‚ÄúI thought so and so was dead but then they showed back up months or years later‚Äù. So fingers crossed for those kitties that decide to go on really long expeditions.

My cats are also indoor/outdoor and if they stay inside for too long the harmony disappears. Sometimes they just need that freedom, despite the risks."
alisonclaree,fduoz74,t1_fdtx00u,"See this is why my cats are house cats, I‚Äôve had too many of my childhood pet cats die too soon from outside sources. My little ones are happy as Larry and don‚Äôt care about the outside unless they‚Äôre trying to catch the flies on the other side of the glass. I will keep my fingers crossed for your little guy to come home! I can‚Äôt imagine how you must feel"
LollyHutzenklutz,fdwolnw,t1_fdwcoe2,"I‚Äôll send good vibes your way! My Oswald wasn‚Äôt happy being strictly indoors either, and had a wandering spirit (likely since he was a stray kitten) I couldn‚Äôt tame. It‚Äôs sad that I lost him so young, but at least I know he was happy while I had him. Some consolation in that, I guess."
LollyHutzenklutz,fdur9am,t1_fduoz74,"I do my best to keep them inside, but some cats are too determined... plus I have a dog door (which the cats also know how to use), since my 14 year-old pup shouldn‚Äôt hold it while I‚Äôm at work for 9-10 hours/day.

My other two cats are happy with being inside, thankfully. They might sunbathe on the deck when it‚Äôs nice, but otherwise spend their time in the house. Trust me, I‚Äôm aware of the risks."
okurrbitch,fdygtdt,t1_fdur9am,"Thank you! Someone said it! My 3 cats cannot he kept inside, so it‚Äôs very frustrating when someone says ‚Äújust make them indoor cats‚Äù. it‚Äôs pretty much impossible for me & my cats. plus, they‚Äôre much happier outside."
LollyHutzenklutz,fdv0ihw,t1_fduxa4t,"Yes, they do exist - but require cutting a hole in the wall, which I doubt my landlord would approve. Then again, we were discussing ways to keep their cat from (breaking into and) eating at my place. Hmmm, maybe I‚Äôll mention it.

FYI: The door I have now is just a panel, which pops into the sliding patio door."
LollyHutzenklutz,fdwnl8d,t1_fdvm86s,"I do have a sliding door, which already has the dog door installed... it‚Äôs the chip-activated ones that require cutting the wall, as they don‚Äôt just slide in like mine. They‚Äôre also very expensive, btw. Like $500+?

At any rate, this all sounds too complicated and expensive for a place I‚Äôm only living short-term. And since I don‚Äôt have the skills or tools to do this myself, I‚Äôd also have to pay someone to do it for me. Appreciate the advice, but it‚Äôs just not feasible at this time. My current two cats don‚Äôt wander, anyway, so I think it‚Äôs cool for now."

spicychickeninfinity,fdubgsn,t3_en1vnn,"So happy for you that you got him back! My furry man was missing for 10 days before I found him and I was so messed up the entire time (plastering flyers everywhere, driving and walking the neighborhood(s), checking shelters, posting on Nextdoor [which is how I eventually got him home]). When he got home, he smelled like tires and was skinny and thirsty so he ate for like an hour and drank for like 30 minutes and then he slept in my bed for a good whole day. I can only imagine your relief/joy when you finally found your furry dude! Happy reunion to you both!"

ronnepon1991,fduw5fb,t3_en1vnn,"I myself understand the absolute joy of having your furbaby back after being missing for an extended amount of time.
My old sir King(11 at the time) was missing for 3 months, through a very cold winter, and through new years(wich turns into a shitstorm in the netherlands) 
My heart was so heavy, and everyone around me assumed he was dead in a ditch somewhere and said I should give up. 
Did alot of flyering and posting in fb groups. Eventually I was contacted by someone that King went home with their family's cats and he was stealing their food and was yowling outside their house. 
Went over ASAP and there he was. Scrawny and scraggy but alive. That feeling of having him back was unlike anything else. It looks like the whole ordeal aged him a but though. But he recovered very well otherwise thankfully. 
I'm so glad you got Connor home again and I wish you all the best. And tell him he's grounded for the forseeable future lol."
jamebenn,fdwal48,t3_en1vnn,"He must have been chased and gone out of 'his territory'. Difficult then for them to find their way home without familiar landmarks and smells.
 It sounds as though he was as relieved and happy to see you as you were to find him. So glad for you all."
HaileyandRoccosMom,fdwccln,t1_fdwal48,"Yes, and we were living at my mom‚Äôs house because my condo is being renovated.  So he had only been living there 2 months before going missing and wasn‚Äôt very familiar with the area.  Also, there are canals near her home and the only way to cross them is on the main streets, and if he wandered over to the other side of the canal, I think it would be very difficult for him to find his way back.  He had actually crossed 2 canals to get the location where I found him."

Eventually they built him a little cat home and put the bed he had been using in there and he became a part of the family. He was never an indoor cat, usually tearing up furniture and peeing everywhere and he genuinely seemed happier outside but there were coyotes in the area and they were worried about him. So eventually they decided to give him to a family that could keep him safer. They happened to have some friends two states over (were in Washington so the only real options are California and Montana, but I'm unclear on the specifics) who were looking for a cat. They drove all the way with him gave him to their friends and went on their way. Three months later he was at their back door begging for food. Cats are crazy dude."

whiteclawrafting,fdne5w1,t1_fdndmsr,"I do the same thing, I start having conversations with him. One cat is quiet, the other sounds exactly like OPs cat. I ask him if he's dying too üòÇ"
kate_L019,fdnhntu,t1_fdndmsr,"Oh man, I meow back too, sometimes matching his tone and pitch. It's hilarious music and he just looks at me like I'M the crazy one."
RJean83,fdnl5de,t1_fdndmsr,"Had to take my cat to the vet 3 times over the Christmas/New Year's break. Each time, she would let out so many little mews, like she knew the Uber driver would free her if she was sad enough.

All you can do is say ""I know"" and get there asap."
Agony_Mouse,fdniwmf,t1_fdndmsr,"I find myself saying, ""It's okay. You're okay,"" over and over."

Darth-Sarah,fdo0bt6,t1_fdndmsr,"SAME! I moved my cats across town last year and it was about a 30ish minute drive with three cats. All three of my cats meowed the whole way and I responded to every meow with some variation ""I know buddy I knowwww."" or ""It's okay, you're all doing so great!"""
Anxiousballgal,fdns624,t1_fdndmsr,"One of our cats also does this whenever she is in a car. She calms down immediately when my husband reaches to pet her. Not just any person, specifically him and only him."

OSCgal,fdnz8qt,t1_fdndmsr,"I learned that talking only made him meow more. I guess if I ignore him, he figures things must not be that bad?"
Mangobunny98,fdnzkux,t1_fdndmsr,"I do this too and I always tell her ""we're almost there then you can be free"" she always sounds so upset to be in the carrier but she's not calm enough to only be in her harness in the car."
7echArtist,fdnqf1u,t1_fdndmsr,My cats do the same. They hate going to the Vet. Just gotta reassure them it's for their own good.
KharnalBloodlust,fdoah1w,t1_fdndmsr,"Same. His pupils get all blown and he starts hyperventilating. It's a 10 minutes drive to the vet and I feel like I'm torturing both of us. When I moved to a different state he did this for the whole 3.5 hour drive. The last hour or so the other cat started chiming in. We were all exhausted by the end of it. I can only say, ""it's ok buddy, you're fine"" so many times..."
dreamfall,fdon9r5,t1_fdndmsr,"I say that to mine as well, I think everyone says that to an unhappy cat because they just sound so heartbroken. A friend of mine who lives in Chicago has a funny story about taking her cat to the vet, in a carrier she had strapped to one of those little luggage type carts. Of course the cat was crying and as she walked past this one woman, the woman said ""I know honey, I know""."
Wrath_Of_Aguirre,fdozyiv,t1_fdndmsr,"Same. I NEVER call my cat ""buddy"" *except* for this circumstance. It just seems apt."

enhyl,fdoamwz,t1_fdndmsr,"My vet is only about 2 blocks from my house, so when I take my cat in I usually just walk over with him in his carrier. Pretty sure my neighbours all think I'm nuts cause I talk to him to calm him down lol"
b_thomp_53,fdofjz2,t1_fdndmsr,"Took my four month old kitty on a 7 hour road trip to my family's over the holidays and it broke my heart to hear her cry so much. I kept saying, ""It's okay baby. We'll be there soon."""

ohmegalomaniac,fdnu9cm,t1_fdnqky0,"Lol I thought that until my one of my cats needed a vaccine. Sad meows all the way in the car, then when we got to actually injecting her...

The most horrific fucking scream I have ever heard from a cat. 

My other cat was totally chill though, she tried to walk across the table with the injection still in her lol"
BlueberryToastCrunch,fdokqmq,t1_fdnqky0,"Lol my cat is the exact opposite! Maybe one meow during the 30 min trip to the vet, then once the vet touches him he's all Hissy McBitey... He has to be sedated so that he can get a thorough checkup."
zealeus,fdotsv6,t1_fdnqky0,"The car ride is the easy part for us. The vet? As soon as she smells all the intruders, she goes into psycho mode.  The vet tech has had to get falconer gloves to hold her down due to theatrics. Her file has a giant BITER label and when I come in; the vet is, ‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs you. We‚Äôll bring Rose to the back. If you hear screaming (human or cat), just ignore it.‚Äù"
scarlett_butler,fdoia8k,t1_fdogs1z,Me too!
lianali,fdnv89r,t1_fdnu9cm,"Shroedinger, god rest her furry soul, *absolutely hated* having her temperature taken. Being the soft-hearted mushes we are, we were okay with her being taken from the room to take her vitals. From the other room comes this demonic howling cat noise and my fianc√© and I look at each other. It had to be Shroedie. We confirmed it with the vet tech, who fervently agreed that Shroedie absolutely, positively did NOT like getting her temperature taken.

Life Pro Tip: Don't name your cat after dead chemists, they will be loud, opinionated, and smart to spite you."
7echArtist,fdnujye,t1_fdnu9cm,I love the checkups where you get to be there as they check out the kitty. It‚Äôs interesting to see how they handle it. My cats try to find a way out of the situation constantly. They won‚Äôt sit still and immediately try to find the tightest corner in the room they can get to. Luckily the vet we have is pretty good at keeping them contained so they can do their work.
figgypie,fdonzn1,t1_fdnu9cm,"My cat would hunker down into a little rage loaf once we got to the vet. I'd have to take the top off the carrier to even get her out. After that, she'd only willingly move when it was time to go home, which is when she'd scurry back inside the reassembled cat carrier.

Occasionally she'd let out a low growl at the veterinarian, but she never tried to bite them thank goodness."
BreadPuddding,fdp7uya,t1_fdnu9cm,"Wow, I‚Äôve never had a cat get upset about vaccination. The needle goes into the loose skin around the shoulder and they‚Äôre totally chill about it - or at least not any more upset than they were about being at the vet to begin with."
Poodlepied,fdp2q0t,t1_fdokqmq,Our monster too! Have to drop him off in the morning so he can get a shot while still in his carrier. That shot calms him enough that he can be sedated enough for the actual exam. He‚Äôs bitten the vet more than once.
DrPhilYourHoles,fdnyoqp,t1_fdnv89r,Can I have permission to name my inevitable next cat after yours???
markrichtsspraytan,fdo5ebx,t1_fdnv89r,I had a cat named Beans that would act like nothing happened when his temp was taken. I just gave him an eyebrow raise every time. Little dude did not mind stuff being put in his bootyhole.
Hippiechick5280,fdohdr3,t1_fdnv89r,Haha my son named his cat shrody after shroedinger. She is crazy as hell!
thartal,fdp54e2,t1_fdnv89r,hahaha i love your pro-tip
cassandraterra,fdpmqsn,t1_fdnv89r,My cat has to get her anal glands poked/expressed a few times a year. I have never heard such a noise from a cat before. It was horrible!  It takes 3 people to do it she really REALLY hates having her butt touched.
cheesebuns4lyfeyoyo,fdp82un,t1_fdnv89r,"> Being the soft-hearted mushes we are, we were okay with her being taken from the room to take her vitals. 

Can I ask your experience about this? My new vet does this every time and I'm not used to it so it really weirds me out. My cat has mad separation anxiety, so I'm not being an overly attached cat lady when I tell them ""she really will be more relaxed if I'm here to push her face a little"", but I don't wanna cause a huge fuss if it's a major inconvenience for them. Why do they want to take her to a different room? And is it a pain in the ass if I request they don't?"
riwalenn,fdohmnu,t1_fdnujye,"Mine too. Apparently, the tightest corner is... Between my breast.

He put his head in between and didn't move for the all checkup /vaccine. At least, he stayed still and was easily to check for the vet."
lianali,fdoy72m,t1_fdnyoqp,"Absolutely! Also, don't say I didn't warn you. It's like naming a dog Loki."

rainyria,fdp4bau,t1_fdo4f68,Talk to your vet. They can give you something that can calm them but not knock them out. Its better for everyone but its really not fair for the kitties to be so scared for so long.
fearthainne,fdpeb12,t1_fdo4f68,"I moved from Oklahoma to Indiana a few years ago (12 hr drive, with stops) with my cat. She typically yowls like a demon is chewing her tail on car rides. There was so much stuff under her carrier she could see out the window and didn't make a peep the whole drive. I'm not certain that seeing out was actually the difference that kept her quiet, but anytime she has to have a car ride, I make sure she can see out and she's always quiet now."

absolute_timewaster,fdnbr7y,t3_em9s6d,"Had to take a cat on a plane once...

Once.

Never again.

Fortunately the rest of the people on the flight were chill and felt soooooooo bad for her. Screaming babies? No. Incessantly meowing cat? Surprisingly yes."
Agony_Mouse,fdnjw7r,t1_fdnbr7y,"I had to take my cat on a plane when I moved across the country. She was a good girl thanks to her cat xanax, but TSA was SO RUDE. They wanted me to take her out of her carrier and walk through the metal detector with her. I was like, are you kidding? She will sprint away as fast as she can. Then it took them forever to find someone to go into a personal examination room with her because ""no one wants to handle a cat with claws."" Mind you, she was being very well behaved. I couldn't believe the attitude I got from everybody, considering I had to pay a premium to fly with her in the first place and didn't have any other choice. Pfft. Never again.

Edit: Metal detector, not x-ray"
brookski_lee,fdnqq01,t1_fdnbr7y,The last time I flew there was both a cat and a baby on our flight. The cat did way better than the baby.

dunce-hattt,fdo8ooa,t1_fdnjw7r,refusing to handle a cat with claws......... these people would rather the cat was mutilated? yikes. declawed cats use teeth which is arguably worse.
chocokittynyaa,fdnl3vk,t1_fdnjw7r,"It isn't rude, it's standard for traveling with an in-cabin animal. I go through this with my own cat four times a year and TSA ppl always make goo-goo eyes at her and are very accommodating. Cat needs to be on a harness and leash during security, then you can take it off afterwards as long as they're in the carrier.

Edit: Also, it's not an x-ray. It's a metal detector. They don't put animals through an x-ray, that's the point!"
keakealani,fdp1htp,t1_fdnjw7r,"Ugh, this happened to us too! Our cat was the most chill of little scared dudes but there was NO WAY I would take a cat out in a crowded airport, even with a leash on (and I don‚Äôt think we had his harness on hand anyway). I am glad we flew with him but it was still pretty awful getting through TSA."
NotLikeThis3,fdowofa,t1_fdnjw7r,I've had to fly with my cat a few times and had to take her out of the carrier as well. That's what harnesses and leashes are for.

chocokittynyaa,fdnu2n5,t1_fdntvy0,"You are technically required to put them on a harness and leash when out of the carrier. That is what I was referring to. I'm sure that they don't really enforce the rule, though."
NotLikeThis3,fdowwwx,t1_fdntvy0,"Maybe you don't have to, but it just makes things easier. If the cat gets startled and claws themselves from you then you have the leash you're holding on to

I have a carrier that has an attachment to her harness within the carrier, so I open it up, attach her leash and detach the carrier. No chance of her sprinting off and hiding who knows where"

gummitch_uk,fdnaekb,t3_em9s6d,Eight and a half minutes? I once took a cat from London to Brussels (in a car via the Channel Tunnel) and she miaowed the \*entire\* way.

sjallllday,fdnl3r0,t3_em9s6d,"I adopted my kitty in April and she was basically silent on the ride home, which was to be expected bc she was very very skittish.

Paavo_Nurmi,fdosdbk,t1_fdokkux,"I had a cat that would poop every time and puke half the time. He had one eye and had to have the other eye checked regularly at a specialist that was an hour drive away. He never made it more than halfway before pooping, and the record was 5 minutes from home.

I would line the bottom and sides of the carrier with puppy pads, and bring plenty of paper towels and garbage bags. He never had a problem on the drive home so it was ok to throw everything away when I got there."

Its-Kyla,fdohx7y,t3_em9s6d,"I LOVE this! My girl was diagnosed with diabetes April last year, this meant loads of car trips to the vets, not only did she complain like your boy. She vomed through the door of her carrier onto my car seat.

Edit: spelling error"
TonytheCatGuy,fdokj24,t1_fdohx7y,"Oh no! My sister had a diabetic cat named Broccoli, I was scared to give her shots but soon realized that she didn't mind it at all, they're so tough!"
Theodopolopodis,fdoi2ao,t3_em9s6d,Hilarious editing! I moved house a few months ago with 3 cats. The journey took 15 minutes and it was ridiculous.
TonytheCatGuy,fdok7t6,t1_fdoi2ao,"Thank you very much! I can just imagine what the interior of that car must have sounded like, which is of course music to my ears lol"
TechnoVKNG23,fdoi9qv,t3_em9s6d,"LOL I love this. I have 2 cats, one is the ""talker"" or the ""mouth of the south"" as we lovingly call her. Always has to get the last word and meows non-stop on the way to the vet. The hilarious thing is she loves her vet and the tech and never wants to leave the vet. Always complains when they take her temperature or have to give her a shot. Other cat is beyond chill, they're sticking shots in him and he's just like ""whatever man..."" I have to take the little mouth in for rabies shot on Saturday, so I'll be reliving this experience soon."
TonytheCatGuy,fdok3xm,t1_fdoi9qv,"Haha, my Nero is somehow like both of your cats at the same time, she can never listen to his breathing bc he'll start purring as soon as you even look in his general direction. Good luck to kitty with the rabies shot!"
TechnoVKNG23,fdoorl5,t1_fdok3xm,"That's my big 16 lb. tabby, you look at him or barely touch him he's purring like a freight train."
TonytheCatGuy,fdtjumm,t1_fdoorl5,Isn't it the best? Until the vet needs to listen to their heart/breathing and they can't because the motor is runnin' too loud :S
Sofw2424,fdol0qd,t3_em9s6d,"My cat also does this the poor baby, at least until we let her out of the carrier and I carry her in my lap and then she calms down"
TonytheCatGuy,fdomkbt,t1_fdol0qd,"He's definitely more calm outside the carrier, we did that on the way home but it's a risky move so I drove about 15km/hr and everybody behind me hated it but oh well, priorities!"
Sofw2424,fdpyzvq,t1_fdomkbt,"I mean it‚Äôs not that risky if your holding them in your slap/arms and act like their own personal seat belt cause that what I do, that way she gets to see around and not be confined into a small space"
KatBleu,fdolorh,t3_em9s6d,I relate so much! Thanks for the laffs!
TonytheCatGuy,fdom89h,t1_fdolorh,"Haha, you are most certainly welcome :)"
4gardencats,fdolrzu,t3_em9s6d,"I took 3 of my cats to the vet once for their annual do-dah, thinking I'd save myself some time. Problem was, all the meowing and wailing that two of them did caused the very sensitive 3rd one to get so upset he vomited before we got there. Took him alone after that and he did fine."
TonytheCatGuy,fdom24f,t1_fdolrzu,"So the time saved traveling was then used cleaning cat puke, definitely not an ideal outcome but it all worked out in the end! :D"
shreeloop,fdomh7t,t3_em9s6d,oh my god this is so funny!!üòÇ literally cats lol why are they like this
Sunny_E30,fdomvdy,t3_em9s6d,Whens the remix dropping?
TheOneEyedPussy,fdopx10,t3_em9s6d,I paused it and I still hear meowing
TonytheCatGuy,fdtmcsj,t1_fdopx10,"Better check the door, your cat might want back inside XD"
TheOneEyedPussy,fdu1c1t,t1_fdtmcsj,"I listened to it in class, I heard the meowing in the garbled conversations I was hearing. My cats would run out and never look back, they always try to sprint out when we open doors."
TonytheCatGuy,fdvhuxh,t1_fdu1c1t,"haha, Nero used to do that when I lived in an apartment building by a busy road so I didn't let him outside, thankfully there was a second door. They're sneaky little ninjas sometimes, eat paw lined with several tiny cat-ana blades"
shellie49,fdoq5vb,t3_em9s6d,My cat is about to get on a 13-hour flight from Jacksonville to Washington state. This is her on a ride to a vet. I can't imagine what it's going to be like for her in cargo.
TonytheCatGuy,fdtna21,t1_fdoq5vb,"She will be putting on the performance of a lifetime for all the other cats/dogs! It could be funny if you had a little audio recorder to put in her carrier to hear the chaos that ensued after landing, but it might also be super sad so maybe don't do that :S either way once you're at the final destination and you dish out some treats she will forget all about it immediately!"
k123abc,fdoslhd,t1_fdoq5vb,carry her on and have your vet give you some sedatives !!
shellie49,fdotklq,t1_fdoslhd,"She's going cargo cause I'm not flying with her, I really hope the vet allows her sedatives"
violetm00n,fdoqqvo,t3_em9s6d,Just took my girl to the vet today and she did the same thing. Then as soon as she‚Äôs out of the crate everything‚Äôs fine lol
TonytheCatGuy,fdtnsdm,t1_fdoqqvo,I hope it wasn't anything serious :S do you have a kitty-pic we can see? :)
violetm00n,fdtua5p,t1_fdtnsdm,"It was just her annual checkup and vaccinations. I don‚Äôt know how to use imgur, but I do have pictures of her on here if you click on my profile. She‚Äôs the black kitty :)"
StevenAU,fdor8g7,t3_em9s6d,"Significantly more hilarious than I was expecting.

Ours do this really deep meow too, like when they see an enemy kitty in their garden."
VerityParody,fdorl0e,t3_em9s6d,My normally very quiet cat does this too. I have driven her from Washington to North Dakota to New Mexico to  Texas. Idk how I'm still sane. The very first move she got worked up so hard she vomited and shat at the same time! I've learned to transport on an empty stomach and it helps *a little ** to cover the box completely. I've fashioned my own covers out of sheets so she can't see but still good air exchange.
Ithilai,fdou87c,t3_em9s6d,"My name is Ithilai, and this is my favorite post on Reddit."

littlestmedic,fdoy3uj,t3_em9s6d,"I took my 14 year old cat to the vet last month and she was exactly the same. Meowing before we even got in the car, 5 minutes round the corner, meowing the whole way, meowing in the car park walking to the vet, meowing somehow even louder when we actually got inside... 


And then completely silent when the vet started examining her."
FUGarciems,fdpb6ax,t3_em9s6d,This is amazing footage!
LadyDevonna13,fdpc9bq,t3_em9s6d,What a fire mixtape
Vanille536,fdpcnmd,t3_em9s6d,"Just because knowledge is power: Most cats get motion sickness during transport. Therefore, they meow *a lot* because of the discomfort and distress the motion sickness causes.One way to alleviate the motion sickness is to completely block the view of the outside moving scenery.  Just throw a blanket on the carrier, so the cat won't see outside. It's seem counterproductive, but it helped with either of my cats. And, I hope they felt less sick since they meowed less..."
OneMorePenguin,fdpscws,t3_em9s6d,"I recommend ear plugs.  It took me a while to not get anxious when the cats all meowed on the trip to the vet.  Surprisingly, the rides home were always quiet.  My new vet is 2 miles away and I so much happier."
kacybryan89,fdnj30a,t3_em9s6d,I laughed to hard at this LOL
Davidoviec,fdnfy4d,t3_em9s6d,Haha this too sweet
OnlyPaperListens,fdng60l,t3_em9s6d,"Ok, I have to know. Is the title facetious, or did you actually count the meows? If so, props on your multitasking skills. My brain would melt ten meows in."
Kewtee,fdngagr,t3_em9s6d,Sounds familiar.
Wildroses2009,fdngnbo,t3_em9s6d,When I was a little kid and we took our Siamese cats to the vet I used to entertain myself by counting meows. They always broke 100. Always.
spooktember,fdnh4zm,t3_em9s6d,"Oh damn, did that make me laugh. Freaking cats, man, they are amazing and ridiculous."
pastelchannl,fdnha4n,t3_em9s6d,"our cat has only been in the car 3 times. all 3 times he demanded to get let out of the carrier, even pulled out the door of the carrier (it's a plastic carrier). glad our vet is close by, no need for a car."

haganwills,fdnnvz1,t3_em9s6d,This was my cat yesterday. Took her to the vet and she wasn't happy.
carriegood,fdnnxwz,t3_em9s6d,"Oh boy, I feel your pain.  Our cat is a non-stop yeller when we take him to the vet.  The whole way there, crying himself hoarse, and usually peeing or shitting in the carrier just to make it worse for everyone involved.

Then while sitting in the waiting room, he works himself up into such a frenzy that by the time the vet tries to open the carrier door, he is screaming and hissing and howling and making that scary back of the throat growl.  The vet has to sedate him and keep him overnight to even do the most basic examination.  

The trip home is a little better; he still meows the whole way, but it's quieter.  Still heartbreaking."
thequeenshand,fdno6wz,t3_em9s6d,"Just came back from a round-trip to the vet with my cat. Things went fine during the car ride to the vet, with the usual meowing, but once we were called into the vet's room... He pooped. So much."

Tarienlover,fdnq1c6,t3_em9s6d,Ah yes. My cat does this and if I turn up the radio he will then screech louder so as to be heard. He then continues even once we're at the vet and every one can hear him. Even the techs in the very back behind walls and closed doors could hear him!!
RedditRoxanne,fdnq2aw,t3_em9s6d,This is amazing! Thank you for taking all the time to edit it.

Ohmyactual,fdo0vb2,t3_em9s6d,Brilliant üòÇ
mjbrady83,fdo14lq,t3_em9s6d,"Omg this is giving me flashbacks. My cat HATES the car. It's like this but with an extra bit of desperation. I when I have to do it, it sends me through so many emotions, I feel helpless and sad that I can't ease her anxiety, but then I'm also frustrated and stressed because her meowing is piercing my brain, and then the whole situation is hilarious, too. Ugh, too much. And if you think that's bad, you should hear her the first time I tried to put her in her carrier. Literal screams. It sounded like I was actually murdering a human woman in my house."
Breninnog,fdo18va,t3_em9s6d,"That must be a nightmare of fun.

I find singing to mine when we're on the way to the vet helps lots, plus putting her into the passenger footwell. I can't sing, but she doesn't know that."
bobcat633,fdo1f2p,t3_em9s6d,Ours meow on the way there only. Never on the way home. Just glad to get out of there I guess.
lunademayo,fdo1vw9,t3_em9s6d,"When I used to live with my ex, once we take to the vet our cats and his cat... well... she screamed the hole trip, mine was just with the creepy face of ""what did i go wrong"". The worst thing that happen was when arriving to the vet for blood test, his cat never let us take her the test, mine was all quietly cooperating"

xXx_TheSenate_xXx,fdo78nu,t3_em9s6d,I always wondered about truckers or people who drove around with cats and they were always calm and happy to be sitting on the dash. But this cat is just like my cats. They don‚Äôt want to ever leave the house.
scarletnightingale,fdo7lq9,t3_em9s6d,"My cats' vet is 20 minutes away (with no traffic).  One of them cries the entire way there in the most sad, betrayed way possible.  It is incredibly stressful and I never feel more guilty.


They are due for a vet check up this month...  I am not looking forward to it or trying to wrestle them into the carrier."

deadpatch,fdoawmy,t3_em9s6d,I have a cat that does this too. A few years back I moved from NYC to LA via car. I‚Äôm still not over the mental trauma.
DrOCD,fdob3se,t3_em9s6d,"When I got my boy I had a 5 hour drive with him to get him home.  He was just a kitten, so I couldn't drug him to sleep... he screeeeaaammmeeedddd at me the entire way.  And continues to scream at me to this day."
hzein,fdob50i,t3_em9s6d,"Two years ago, I drove with my cat from Texas to North Carolina in a 36 hours trip lol. Didn‚Äôt put her in a kennel. She slept on my lap the majority of times. Every few hours she would stand by the side windows, back window or even windshield and meow like her life depends on it, but not for too long."
Rylyshar,fdobb9s,t3_em9s6d,"Ok, my cat would not only yowl the whole way, he would also poop in the carrrier and sometimes barf too. So I got one of those canvas cat carrier bags ‚ÄúCat-in-the-bag Cozy Comfort Carrier.‚Äù We were moving to a town 3 hours away. 

Put him on the front passenger seat with seatbelt through the bag loop and kept my hand near his head. Once he got his feet under him in the bag he actually drifted off a few times with his head on my hand. Absolutely worth the cost!"
TechnoVKNG23,fdoiprp,t1_fdobb9s,"I had to spend 10 hours in the car with mine, but since she's only 7 lbs. I made her a ""cat condo"" which was essentially a small dog carrier that fit completely on my front passenger seat. I was able to put her entire bed in it with room for a small feeding tray in the front and several of her toys, she complained a bit at the start, but then went right to sleep. There was enough room for her to stretch and turn around and she'd wake up when I'd go through the drive through for food and meow at the food workers, it was pretty funny."
Trinkitt,fdobdmi,t3_em9s6d,"I have a Siamese. I feel this in my soul. 

When I bring him in to the vet office, the other pet parents are concerned that he‚Äôs DYING because of the noises he‚Äôs making. Perfectly healthy, just letting everyone know he is not happy and does not approve."
Urswedishbasicbitch,fdobk36,t3_em9s6d,Taking my cat to they vet is about the only time I've ever heard him meow like a normal cat.
MrPicklesOnDevon,fdobmdc,t3_em9s6d,Kitty was stressed really bad for that to happen.
Gurkeprinsen,fdocdei,t3_em9s6d,I like how the meows at the end became slightly softer.

elkinsj210,fdof3w8,t3_em9s6d,"My wife and I moved across multiple states for a 15 hour trip. Our cat did this nearly the entire time. We went to the vet before hand to get sedatives but either they didn't take, or he just didn't give a damn."
applejackrr,fdofksu,t3_em9s6d,My guy never meows at it. In fact the only time he meows is when he poops.
-bitchpudding-,fdofvkj,t3_em9s6d,"Taking my Lorge boye to the vet is fucking awful. He cries like I'm beating him with a stick on the car but then gets mad when he's forced to leave the clinic after a clean bill of health and free pats (they aren't free pal, they cost $). My honky-tonker rode from Canada back to Seattle like he does it on the daily. The contrast is stark and loud."
TechnoVKNG23,fdoigeu,t1_fdofvkj,"This describes my little fluff ball pretty much exactly. Hates the ride to the vet, constantly complains, as soon as we get there she wants to prance around the vet table and enjoy all the attention, loves her primary vet and the tech, and then never wants to leave and complains and tries as hard as she can to not get back in the carrier."

TonytheCatGuy,fdoo2lj,t1_fdok6c8,Fit as the fiddle his namesake played while Rome burned! :)
ablackcatstail,fdoo8np,t1_fdoo2lj,Glad he's doin' well. None of my cats ever fancied the trip to the vet.

TonytheCatGuy,fdon5ch,t1_fdokjnk,"Ha, yeah I was curious so I made a video with a little counter at the bottom of the screen and this video was made afterwards, full length meow-count video is on my IGTV (@)tonydecoste"
FireInsideofMe,fdonpp4,t1_fdon5ch,I have a cat who did that. We had a vet that was 30 minutes away(new to area and this cat walked onto my apartment dying so we were like OMG SOMEONE RECOMMEND A GOOD VET TO ME). We moved again and thankfully his is now 5 minutes away. Holy terror  in a cage with that one.

TonytheCatGuy,fdtkh8i,t1_fdoowpm,"Sorry bout that, Nero got over it as soon as I gave him some treats you should try that! Not cat treats though, people treats, like Doritos or M&M's!"

Vampyre_Lilith,fdop84y,t3_em9s6d,For a second I thought you were the one meowing!

tikipunch4,fdopjou,t3_em9s6d,"I moved at the beginning of the year and my cat, Left Eye, did this when I plopped her in the new house. I had to sit there and hold her for an hour before she built the courage to explore."
TonytheCatGuy,fdtlz0o,t1_fdopjou,"Left Eye Lopes? When we moved and Nero was in this house for the first time he became confused and hissed at me for the first and only time ever, it really freaked me out because I was walking up the stairs at the time so I was at eye level with him and he is a big boi! Do you have a pic of Left Eye you could share with us? :)"

k123abc,fdosq8c,t3_em9s6d,"ugh god, every time my cat goes in the car it's the same symphony. the other week i took her to the ER (for a URI, she is ok now) and she DIDN'T cry when she went in her crate and that's when i knew something was \~actually\~ wrong....but man was it peaceful."
mightbeaquarian,fdotcs8,t3_em9s6d,two fine specimens in that car
NorthWestTown,fdothab,t3_em9s6d,"My cat did this on the trip to the vet too. We used to have conversations with him üòÇ sometimes he would do a meow that sounded like he was asking a question, and we'd answer him with ''yes we are nearly there'' '' meow? '' '' no its a routine check up nothing to worry about''.

I'll never forget how eerily silent the car ride back home was the day we had him pts üò¢ my dad just sang him a song to say goodbye the entire way back."
TonytheCatGuy,fdtj7ws,t1_fdothab,"There is a full version of this video on my IGTV (www.instagram.com/tonydecoste) where I do the same thing, when their meows go up in pitch at the end it is the perfect opportunity to answer a question they didn't realize they asked!
And what a great cat dad he is to sing them off. I had to say goodbye to a kitty very very recently and it was devastating, but I am thankful that I had 14 great years with her.

Thank you for sharing this story with me, I really do appreciate it :)"
MicaSarcanus,fdouhuh,t3_em9s6d,"My cat was the same way when I took him to get shots. He hates cars. Which I'm glad for because he steers clear of them whenever he hears them, which is really only on the few occasions where he slips out of the house."

Poor dog was sweet but...so not bright.  He did it again ten minutes later. Just didn't learn.  Yipe Yipe!

LuminousOcean,fe5js3j,t3_enojwz,"Yep.  Had a stunted-growth cat of my own, lived to 18.  His growth was presumably stunted due to the conditions we found him in.  Someone abandoned him out in the middle of a snow-covered field in the middle of a Canadian winter.  By the time my parents got to him, his fur had started freezing and falling off.

Did yours by chance not meow for the longest time, and then one day just up and start emitting a really, really raspy meow?"
Chikita11,fe5l0ew,t1_fe5js3j,"Oh god that sounds horrifying, poor kitty üò¢

I wouldn't say he's grow-stunted, his mother was also small and he was a petite baby like his siblings. He meows normally as far as I can tell.

He happens to have very youthful features, most older cats (8+) I know actually look their age."
LuminousOcean,fe5sa6r,t1_fe5l0ew,"My guy mostly started showing his age in his last year of life.  But up until that point, he was relatively small, and his fur stayed nice and kitten soft for his entire life.  He also had some odd quirks.

Her ma went from threatening to get rid of him, tonone day absentmindedly petting him while he was on her lap. I pointed it out to her and how he use to be and she said she never thought she'd ever like the cat. Then, about 6 months after her and I broke up, they ended up giving him to the local shelter right before Halloween without telling me. I had told her that if they ever had to get rid of him that I would take him because I loved that cat. He became my bud over there. I'd go say hi to him as soon as I walked in the door.

So I'm gonna pretend that this is him and that somehow you guys ended up with my little demon kitty."

_LadyHero_,fdn6je7,t3_ema20o,"Max was supposed to have his eye removed next Wednesday, but due to his pain levels the vet shifted her schedule around to get him seen today.


I have had next to no time to accept the fact that he will be losing his eye... I was hoping for one last walk outside, one last time to sit in his favorite tree, one last time for him to look at me with those beautiful eyes. But things can change *literally* in the blink of an eye.


Hug your fur babies and live each day to the fullest.


Will post updates of my soon-to-be pirate as I have news.

EDIT: Wow! We are really feeling the love here... so great to hear all the well wishes and also stories of your pets that have thrived after going through the same thing. The vet said he should be going into surgery around 11am(PT)... I will know more soon. Thank you all SO much! ‚ô•Ô∏è

EDIT 2: Just got the call that everything went as expected in surgery. They are going to let me take him home once the anesthesia wears off. They warned me his face is shaved and obviously many stitches, but I am so thankful!
I don't have any family or anyone to share this with, just my BF and I, so I just want to say how incredibly grateful I am to all of you for your support today. It's really cheered us up! I'll be giving him lots of snuggles and hugs on your behalf!

Final Edit: He is home and doing far better than we ever expected! He tore through the house, purring so loudly and checking out every inch of the house with his new vision. We had to stop him from crashing into things, and now that he is starting to settle down, we have him barricaded in one room for safety tonight. We moved our mattress to the floor to keep him company. I think this is going to be a great change for him...he seems so happy!

Thank you for everything, Reddit. You are amazing!"
catsinspace,fdno2u1,t1_fdn6je7,"Every cat I've had has had one eye (my first cat had one eye so I've specifically looked for one-eyed kitties ever since.) He'll be totally fine!

TheSuperSucker,fdorb8v,t1_fdnxwba,One of our cats had to have a leg amputated. We're still trying to figure out how to fashion a peg left for him.
catsinspace,fdr2qvi,t1_fdnxwba,"I've thought about this so many times. If you put an eyepatch on your one-eyed cats, it just kinda looks like you're an asshole who put an eyepatch on your two-eyed cat. I do, however, have a cat-sized pirate hat for my one-eyed cats, and 2 out of the 3 cats I've had have tolerated it."

Maledictum,fdn96nw,t3_ema20o,"Our sweet foster cat [Bonnie](https://i.imgur.com/ShPNIb3.jpg) just had hers removed today. She was hit by a car several months ago, had surgery to have her cleft palate (as a result of the accident) fixed, and her eye was also rendered non-functional :( We had to wait a bit for her immune system to get stronger and today was the big day. She was in pain, as the eye shrunk and her inner lid kept curling inside, hairs and all, so there was not much deciding to do.

You're doing a great job with Max! Wishing him a speedy recovery <3"

_LadyHero_,fdr03o3,t1_fdn96nw,Just wanted to check in on Bonnie... how is she doing today?
Maledictum,fdpyt3p,t1_fdnm8ue,"I love the updates with Max! Bonnie also [slept in the crate](https://i.imgur.com/2pFelBk.jpg) in our bedroom last night, as we waited for the anesthesia to wear off before moving her back with the other 3 foster ladies. She was rather scared when I let her out, as she was trying to do the usual stuff, such as jumping on the windowsill and falling due to the cone of shame. It was so sad to watch :( I put a 3-step ladder next to the window and I'm hoping she will use it to get up, as opposed to jumping.   


She's a champ at taking her medication and she [doesn't even flinch](https://i.imgur.com/B857vqd.jpg) when I give her the injections. She also purrs like there's no tomorrow and love love loves getting pet. Even if she's still in pain and will be for a while, the future is bright for her. We'll find her the best adoptive family ever, pinky promise!"

Maledictum,fdqdl34,t1_fdqcsrk,"We love her so much! We take a great liking to all of our fosters, but I have a soft spot for the broken ones and she has a special place in my heart.   


Just next Tuesday we're sending Ares, a 6-month-old incontinent (both urine and feces) kitten that we found at 3 weeks old and taken care of ever since, to be placed in a new foster family and then assessed and put up for adoption in Belgium. We are located in Romania and the chances of finding him a family that could properly take care of him here were slim to none.  


Animals like Max, Bonnie, Ares are so amazing and deserve only the best ü•∞"
keeleyalohna,fdqef51,t1_fdqdl34,You have such a warm and giving heart. That‚Äôs gotta be hard seeing them go but so rewarding! You‚Äôre saving their lives. You‚Äôre special people helping animals with more extensive health hiccups.
Maledictum,fdqfrqh,t1_fdqef51,"I'm sure I'm gonna ugly cry when I drop off Ares üòÑ The other cats and kittens we adopted out locally (25 of them in 2019) and we either keep in touch or follow them on social media, so we know about all of them even after adoption.

We don't only tend to sick or injured cats, we take in all kinds of kittens, but as it so happens, in December we had one returned to us because she had gotten sick (2 months in -.-') - turns out she had Coronavirus, which is highly infectious and with nasty gastroenteritis symptoms, and before we found out what was wrong with her we managed to infect 2 others. With help from out great vets we pulled through, but then one of the other kittens (we keep them somewhat separated and he did not get Corona) ran a fever and we found out he had calicivirus (again, contagious but unlike Corona, is covered by a vaccine) and also tested positive for panleukopenia. We were SO lucky that he didn't get the panleuk symptoms, because along with calicivirus, it would have been too much for him to handle (3 months old). It appears his mother had it, because he has cerebellar hypoplasia and his walk is a little wobbly. Bonus, he now has developed ringworm as a result of the compromised immune system.

Then last weekend one of our own cats (which didn't get in contact with the fosters) stopped eating and ran a 40.9 fever; after full bloodwork and ultrasounds and all of the rapid tests we do in cats, we still have no clue what was wrong. She has received symptomatic treatment and is now back to normal but left us scratching our heads.

Being a foster parent is such a difficult but so, so rewarding occupation! I can't say job, because we work full time besides fostering the little furballs üòÉ

I know we have totally hijacked Max's post, but I thought you'd find my little story interesting!"
keeleyalohna,fdqj9vx,t1_fdqfrqh,December was the month for everyone to fall under something it sounds like:/ are you still fighting all those ailments with the kitten and others?
Maledictum,fdqlc9w,t1_fdqj9vx,"The corona girls have finished their treatment, but we are still fighting ringworm in the little kitten and some IBS symptoms in one of the other cats I forgot to mention ü§£ It's been a wild ride for sure!"
_LadyHero_,fdr2ixh,t1_fdqlc9w,"Wow, you are your foster babies have been through SO much! You are an unbelievable human to care for these worthy animals in need.

keeleyalohna,fdn6pwv,t3_ema20o,"I‚Äôm sorry. You‚Äôre doing the right thing though. Animals are far more resilient than we think, especially cats. Just try to be as positive as possible and just give him love and comfort. I‚Äôm sorry Max and yourself are dealing with this:/"

BittyBaton,fdserkd,t1_fdsemwi,"So very glad he is doing so well.  That can often happen post surgery if something really hurt or was infected.  Bit of care and boom, better!  Very awesome he's purring so much.   Know he's getting his cuddles."

Edit: One bit of advice that we have learned with our own pirate - be very vocal with them. Faris has learned to be able to follow our voices when we're calling that it's feeding time, or if she gets disoriented (other eye isn't that great and she can't see well in the dark), but she will follow our voices, no problem."

The silver lining is that he at least has one eye left. I would feel heartbroken for him if he lost both eyes because I can't imagine how bad that would be. My dog who passed away in 2012 I think was starting to have Diabetes or something or something was going wrong with him and he started to lose his eyesight. He was at a kennel while we were away and he shredded up his blanket he had there and it broke my heart because he must've hated life so much not being able to see when he was born with sight and it was what he's ever known. My dad went home earlier than my mom and I and they thought it was best they put him down so he wouldn't be in pain anymore. I didn't get to say goodbye to him. He was like a childhood friend because I had him since I was 5 or so. And he passed away when I was 14 I guess in 2012. Rest in Peace, Cody, I still think of you often. :'("

Sometimes there's a cause, like trauma, other times it's just degenerative or maybe even hereditary. Max hasn't had any trauma and the vet didn't have a reason... probably just old age. The condition can sometimes be fixed by removing the lens, but it can also cause glaucoma and other problems. So the vet recommended complete removal for his situation..."
shareef74,fdoj612,t3_ema20o,What happened to his eye before it got taken out?
_LadyHero_,fdojrdv,t1_fdoj612,"A detached lens. Probably from old age, or maybe hereditary. They aren't sure why."

PacxDragon,fdp725l,t3_ema20o,I remember when one of my childhood cats had to have his eye removed. We got him as a kitten and named him ‚ÄúRambo‚Äù because of the marking on his face that looked like camouflage (he had both eyes at the time). Later on when he lost his eye at around 4 years old it took him awhile to adjust but he was hunting (and catching) birds again in no time. Lived his best years after that. Ended up tragically losing a fight with a German Shepard after the dog‚Äôs owner stepped in to help.

The next day, he lost all his energy.  I think the anesthetics do weird things.  Be prepared to see him being more sedate tomorrow.  He's a handsome boy!  Sending healing thoughts to Max and peace and calming energy to you."
_LadyHero_,fdql629,t1_fdpsluz,"Aww, poor Domino! This is good to know, thank you. He was running all over last night, then just zonked out. He's eating his breakfast now, and just adorable as ever, but you are absolutely right...far less energy! Give Domino a hug for me!"
OneMorePenguin,fds459j,t1_fdql629,"[https://imgur.com/gallery/EKe4YXp](https://imgur.com/gallery/EKe4YXp) His surgery was just over two hours.  He's fine except for head tilt.  There's a major facial nerve that runs along the ear canal and that gets moved during the surgery.  Fortunately, there was no permanent nerve damage!  I hope Max is continuing to do well.  Eating and litter box are important.  Next is making sure there is no infection."

xtakenotesx16,emr5ht,top_level,
scceberscoo,fdqoaub,t3_emr5ht,Oh no! My vet immediately takes out the giant bite-proof gloves of shame when my cat comes in. I know the feeling haha
karenreddit999,fdqqsm9,t1_fdqoaub,"Yes, I‚Äôve got a cat like that. So gentle otherwise!  In 10 years I never heard him growl except when he started at the vet‚Äôs."
miizme,fdrx2an,t1_fdqoaub,"My old cat had a reputation at the vet we went to. She was a sweet and calm cat, but when we went to the vet she would hiss and bite and claw and you could hear her from the waiting area. And since she had a bad heart they had to try and be quick and not stress her too much, so the vets would normally go and ask for another vet to help them hold her to make things faster and smoother. One time we were in the room and the vet came back and had apparently talked aboyt my cat and her situation, and the helping vet went ""Oh! The angry one!""

They had to take some blood once and put like a bandage thing on... And it had skulls with cat ears on it..."
UnculturedLout,fdr9oei,t1_fdqoaub,I took my girl to a vet that specialized in cats. She was 17 and weighed about 7lbs. The vet had to use leather gauntlets and an apron to handle her.
rumblyrumbly,fds04hk,t1_fdqoaub,"My cat got to a point where the vet would get her assistant to help deal with him. Eventually they decided they would just sedate him whenever he came in so he wouldn‚Äôt get too stressed out from the experience.

He would still give you this glare of death the entire time he was sedated tho."
littleunknownn,fds7t7r,t1_fdqoaub,"One of my cats had the red dot on her file, which pretty much meant all hands on deck/armor up when it was time to give her her shots. She lived to be 19.

It was interesting to see 6 people hold her down just to give her a single shot."
Youhavemyaxeee,fdslcwk,t1_fdqoaub,"My cat went absolutely nuts at the vet once. The door to the room was left open so he bolted out and not only ran around the entire place, but was bouncing off the walls. He ran upstairs, and we heard crashing and banging and then lots of barking. Started coming down, saw us, and bounced off more walls.

I was the one who caught him, and then they threw a blanket over him. Four people held him down for his treatment.

Whenever I go to the vet I have to confirm whether the cat I've brought is the crazy one. I've got two and they're practically identical littermates.

Fun times."

ChunShu,fds5wcb,t1_fds04hk,"Mine also needs to be sedated. Last time when the vet was putting him in the carrier while he was sedated, he was lucid enough to growl but unable to move, poor baby. He's so sweet and cuddly with us, a friend of mine didn't believe until he went to the vet with us"
warkittehs,fds9v0e,t1_fds7t7r,"My cat had ""CAUTION"" written not once but twice and highlighted. Screamed and fought the entire time. You could hear him through doors. Picks lived to be 21."

hurts50good,fdrys35,t1_fdqjg74,"I'm not convinced my cat is actually a cat...the vet calls her ""Angel Face"", bc she's so chill. Let's people cut her nails, take blood, give shots, and she never makes a peep or freaks out. Weirdo üêà."
tirgurltri,fds3xs3,t1_fdrys35,"Both of mine were like that.  They were so in love with Fluffy because he would purr and follow them around the office.  The vet techs cried when I had to put him down.   I still have Mouse and she lets the vet do anything, even if she's not as chill and Fluffy.  If I try to cut her nails end up with stitches though."
plmokiuhv,fds4vn9,t1_fdrys35,"My cat is the same way. She takes all her shots without even a peep or a mroww. Minimal fuss getting her nails trimmed. Generally just enjoys all the attention and ""what a good kitty!"" that she gets."
flaunna,fds6fnu,t1_fdrys35,"Same!! My vet always calls my kitty a little princess and gives her kisses. All the tech's love her too, like I can see the relief on their faces when my cat rubs against them. I always feel bad for people with angry cats, my grandma has one for sure, and I saw them a lot while doing volunteer work, so I know how awful it can be... You could be doing everything right to make them feel safe and they'll still suddenly viciously attack you or pee on you. Cats can have such unpredictable personalities, sometimes."
wuphonsreach,fdtohb4,t1_fdrys35,"Both of mine are that way.  They may cry a bit, but that's the extent of it.  Both are skittish cats.  They hide whenever anyone comes over.

When I take them to the vet, it's in a blanket-covered carrier with their pet bed inside.  The one actually sleeps inside her carrier at home.  I put the blanket on the cold table and then put cat on the blanket.  (Blanket goes in the wash when I get home.)  The blanket over the carrier really reduces the stress level.

They also get handled a lot at home, with rewards given for good behavior.  Manipulation of paws, turning them over, restraining them while brushing, opening their mouth, etc."
navikredstar,fds6d31,t1_fds4vn9,"Same with my girlie. She loves all the praise and attention she gets (she's a little attention whore and *LOVES* people), and lets her nails be trimmed without any issues. I'm sure the Feliway diffusers in the checkup rooms helps, but she just really loves people and getting praise. 
  
Our previous cat, unfortunately, *hated* going to the vet and would yowl and freak out, until the vets would bring out the warm towels sprayed with Feliway to cover him with. He'd mostly chill out then. Mostly. It sucked, though, because the poor guy had a lot of health issues late in his life and was in the vet's office quite a few times toward the end and was horribly upset by the visits to the point where the vet offered to make special home visits for him, to keep from stressing him out too badly. He was an incredibly sweet boy, except for when at the vet's office."

kathakana,fdr1i1q,t3_emr5ht,"If your cat freaks out really badly and you can afford it, it's worth seeing if your vet will do a home visit.  One of our cats used to freak out and we'd need to stay with him so he didn't totally shred the vets arms. When it came time for him to cross the rainbow bridge the vet did a home visit and he stayed calm and drifted off with my mum stroking him.  We'd have asked for a home visit before but didn't know it was an option at that time."
Zoethor2,fdruik1,t1_fdr1i1q,You can also ask your vet for a mild sedative to provide prior to the vet visit. My former feral did just fine at the vet when she was high as a kite.
Definitely_Not_Erin,fdrystx,t1_fdr1i1q,"The home rainbow bridge visits are the kindest thing - no more car rides, no stressful waiting rooms, no strange barks/meows, just familiar, just home. Truly a blessing."
HipsterGengar,fds2f1v,t1_fdr1i1q,I'm really dumb and when I read the rainbow bridge I imagined like a Cat Cafe but it's for cat owners to come and let their cats play with other cats or something cool like that. Then I realized what it meant and now I'm really sad :(
Emiloo74,fdrwux7,t1_fdruik1,We have to sedate our torbie. She hates home visits as much as office visits. The vet has specifically asked she be sedated and placed in a bathroom because of past behavior.
miosgoldenchance,fdsj5im,t1_fdruik1,"This! We have lots of good oral medications now you can give your cat (or dog!) beforehand to chill them out.

Doesn‚Äôt work for everyone but I‚Äôd say at least 3/4 have improvement."
wheelfoot,fds087c,t1_fdrystx,I did that for the last cat I had to put down. I felt much better about it than previous times. Ain't cheap though.
kathakana,fds814j,t1_fdrystx,Definitely.  I told a friend about this a few years ago.  He had an elderly special needs cat who freaked out about the vets and had to have a sedative to get in the carrier.  He had a final home visit.

EarthboundExotics,fdstb2p,t3_emr5ht,"In the future, for the sake of both the vet staff and your cat, have your vet prescribe gabapentin. Progressive vet clinics are moving towards fear free practices, and they'll gladly provide you with a sedative to ensure your cat has a more comfortable experience. Not only does this make the appt less stressful for anyone, but the appt itself will be better, as the vet can more effectively examine the animal. There should be no reason for things like you described to happen these days."

So that's how trips to the vet went with Emma. 

We found later in an x-ray needed for something else that she had discloated hips, so she had probably been in pain since an incident as a kitten. Could have been swung by her tail or something heavy falling on her tail and trying to run from it.

ChefMaggie,fdti8ub,t3_emr5ht,"Poor baby. My two girls are the gentlest kitties, and instead of lashing out when they‚Äôre scared, they just try to run/hide. Once caught they freeze up, which makes them super easy for the vet to handle. BUT, you‚Äôd never know it from the blood curdling yowling and screams that emanate from them whenever I have to put them in their carriers, and they fight like crazy to avoid being shoved in there. To spare us all the stress I switched to home vet visits years ago, which works great now that I have a system down to keep them in the bathroom in advance. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt think to do that the first time, and one squirreled herself into a corner under the bed while the other was cowering on top of the refrigerator wedged partway under a high cabinet.

BlueBelleNOLA,fecohyt,t3_eocqsw,"Here is what I need to know - how do ya keep collars on them? Not once in my life having had multiple cats, would one keep the blinking thing on. What am I doing wrong? Am I adopting them too late? Buying the wrong kitten collars?

Edit also this is a beautiful Anna Karenina looking cat. Excellent rescue."
Boomersgang,fecs2xz,t1_fecohyt,"It's not easy. I have 2 cats that are in a competition to lose the most collars. The count is high. 2 of the others don't lose them at all,  and one looses her mind when I put one on. It really depends on the cat. I never leave the bells on the damn things. The least amount of crap you have on the collar the better. Each item (bows, etc.) adds a handle and an easier way to get the collar off.  Make sure the clip is secure. A lot of the cheap ones have shitty clips. Tightness makes a difference too. To loose and a scratching back foot can pop it off easily. I use the 2 finger under method. Don't measure at the clip site, use the opposite side from the clip."
surkur,fecqxiu,t3_eocqsw,"Almost same story here. A few weeks old and brought him in. He is 5 months old now too. Its crazy that they both are white as fuck too

Trained your cat to stay off the counter tops? That will last untill you leave him alone home. Besides all cats have their own quirks, some messier than others. I have a ginger tabby who insists on dragging his water bowl across the room before drinking, doesn't matter how much or little water is in it, where in the house it is positioned, water fountain or water bowl, he will throw it across the floor before he drinks."

desivaperUSA,fe1d79o,t3_enlzmk,i'm very sorry for your loss. this sucks. hang in there. i'm sure you'll miss her a lot. she'll look in on you from time to time i'm sure.
Skipaspace,fe2qqlf,t1_fe1d79o,"I just wanted to add that I'm not a believer in the afterlife and all that. But let me tell you when I dream about pets I have loss I get ridiculously happy. And it is like they are back with me. 

So no matter you beliefs they really are always with you."
desivaperUSA,fe2utac,t1_fe2qqlf,"i always feel like a loss of a pet is comparable to the loss of a human family member. except with human family member it's never a situation where you go well he's hurting and i don't want him/her to suffer so i'll just put him down. growing up the concept of putting a pet down was something that never made sense to me. but obviously as you get older your thoughts mature and you realize wait one of the duties as a responsible pet owner is to making this tough call when it comes to end your pet's suffering. 

i look at op's cat here in this picture and my heart breaks. she looks tired. she looks sad like she realizes these last few glances are all she's gonna get as everything is going to go blank soon. i think for her and think she thinks and she would be thinking about her journey in life. the good and bad times. the loving family she was a part of. the cuddles, hugs and endless love and treats. 

that's why i always when browsing cats seek out the posts about mourning and loss and try to say some words to give op's strength because when my cat goes i too will post a picture and say some nice things about my cat and hope the community shows up and offers me consolation. 

my heart breaks at all posts in cats that are marked with the red mourning/loss and my heart breaks for op's cat and op as well. but like you said there is a silver lining there that causes us to think about all the happy moments and we have to hold on to that even after our loved pets are gone. 

i really hope op reads all of our words and finds a little solace. i know god has created a place in the afterlife for animals and op's cat is there along with all our pets who have passed away. they are hanging out. being silly. being goofy. playing and occasionally they probably sense their humans are missing them and they stop playing and look into some sort of reflective pool or lake by where they are and when they do they see their loving human. 

when my cat goes i'm going to hurt like op and like many others. but i give him the best life i can despite all my struggles with him. that's all we can really do."
Xenjael,fe2teqn,t1_fe2qqlf,"Nothing ever leaves us. It's enough to me sometimes I had the honour to spend that time with them. I just wish it could have lasted longer. But remembering that before they go. As long as they can exit with a smile we did our duty to the end.

Best advice is while everyone responds to grief differently, do what feels best for you. 

It‚Äôs going to hurt for a bit, or a lot of bit. And that‚Äôs okay, mourn. Take care of yourself. Know you did what you could & your sweet boy is no longer suffering. 

Depending on your beliefs, there‚Äôs a really great book that helped me grieve. Saying goodbye to your angel animals by Allen & Linda Anderson. 

It‚Äôll be rough, but keep going. 
Do your favorite hobbies & activities. Do things that are calming. Journal it out. Reach out to people asking for extra love/ support. 
& Rest! Grief can be exhausting. 

If it helps you to adopt another kitty, then do that & don‚Äôt feel shame & understand it‚Äôs not replacing. Maybe you don‚Äôt want to adopt for awhile, also okay. Everyone is different.  

Take time to self soothe, & be easy on yourself. 
Know the love you share will always be there. 
Heartbreak is real, but so is healing üíú"

He is no longer in pain. Take your time and do what is right for you! Do hobbies and talk about what you're going through that what helps me. I lost my Mischif due to cancer as well and we had to put him to sleep then 2 months later we had to out his brother to sleep he was very sick. I know in my heart that we did the tight thing, but it still hurts. Take time for yourself."

The new kitty isn't a replacement, but a new member of the house.  

I still miss Simba. In fact it's been over a year and it still ""pulls"" on me to type out ""my buddy Simba"".  You just have to give it time."
CabalBot,fdwlmra,t1_fdwbh5e,So true.. I‚Äôll never forget any of my kitties & still talk about them to this day.. even the ones I had as a child- but I can‚Äôt NOT have one- the house is just not the same. A new kitty will help ease the pain & bring a smile back to your face
fuzzbeebs,fdxi7l7,t1_fdwbh5e,"It's been over a year since my sweet baby girl Luna died of leukemia (she was only four years old). I still miss her tremendously, especially since she was so young and we were supposed to be together for many more years. She and my other cat were also inseparable best friends and she spent most of her time hiding under my bed after her buddy was gone. I still miss her terribly.

But, now another sweet girl has a loving home and a cat buddy. It's taken a lot of time but my other cat has warmed up to her and while I doubt she'll ever love her as much as she loved Luna, it's getting to be more and more rare to see one without the other.

For a bit of background, I had Luna before I got my other cat Tisha. Tisha was a feral cat and she had a tough time adjusting to having a home. The person who had fostered her told me that she would probably never be a very affectionate cat, and would never be okay with being held. She hid for weeks, and she used to eat so fast that she would vomit. Luna was 100% welcoming and was a huge help in getting her new friend used to having a home. I think she actually taught Tisha how to communicate with humans, because Luna had this very distinct ""beeping"" meow that Tisha uses to this day. Four years and two apartments later, Tisha is doing very well. She is one of the most affectionate cats I've ever had the pleasure of knowing, and not only is she okay with being held, but she loves getting hugs. When I pick her up she settles into my arms and purrs like a chainsaw. Yesterday I was leaning forward on the couch and she jumped up my back and laid down across my shoulders. 

To make a long story short, Luna made a huge impact in her short life. She loved anyone and everyone"
AmaltheaPrime,fdv0lta,t3_en69wh,"Honestly? It's probably always going to hurt but it will become easier to handle. 

LET YOURSELF GRIEVE. 

Then continue on and be thankful for the time you did have.

And don't get another cat until you know who aren't doing it just to replace him."

XxI_Love_KittensxX,fdz8i7j,t1_fdvbeku,"This depends. Though 'filling the void' helps, don't do it too quickly. You might have expectations for the oet to be like the old one and it'll hurt you more that they're their own personality. It might also hurt the pet because of the expectations set down for them. It all depends on the person you are though."

motherofcats112,fdw025i,t1_fdvwvq8,I recognise the feeling from when one of my cats died during dental suregery in 2016 (he never woke up).

When she had to cross it felt lile I lost both of them.

motherofcats112,fdw2igo,t1_fdw1n4b,I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that! It‚Äôs so difficult to say goodbye. I do hope you still have quite a bit of time together.

I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. (((Hugs)))"
ALoudMeow,fdxgz76,t1_fdw6e0y,"When my first and most unique kitty died, I immediately wrote up a list of little things about her, from nicknames I called her, to her various quirks and details about how she napped with me, knowing that while my love for her would never fade (it‚Äôs been ten years), some of these details would.  Periodically I reread what I wrote (through so many tears!) and it brings so much about her in focus.  I still love you, Corners, and wish we‚Äôd have even longer time together.  May your memories of Kitty Boy be a blessing to you as well."

Kaneelbroodjes,fdvu156,t3_en69wh,"I lost mine of lung cancer too, he was at that time 10 years old. And in all honestly, I cried, cried so much! Don't push anything, just feel the way you feel. You will start to feel better in the coming days/weeks but the pain will never really go away. And a new cat? Don't force it, I got myself a new kitten 2 months later, but if you are not up for that don't do it. The new cat will never make up for the loss of your previous boy, mine thankfully gave me the love and comfort I needed at that point.  


For now, take a deep breath, and remember all the good memories you had! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

space_fox_overlord,fdvsmt6,t3_en69wh,"Sorry for your loss.

It's so soon, it's normal to be sad and overwhelmed. Forcing yourself to snap out of it will only make this process longer, if possible allow yourself some space to grieve."
Maggiemayday,fdw0yxg,t3_en69wh,"I am so sorry for your loss.

You can move forward, but not move on.  You will always love him, and your grief will reflect that love.  Go ahead, feel all the feels.  Try to take care of yourself and don't get dehydrated or forget to eat.    
Are you having him cremated?  You can get a pinch of the ashes made into a lovely glass memory piece, there's a number of good artists online who offer that service."

Sending you love #catsarefamily"
CatLadyGrip,fdvwk2f,t3_en69wh,"I'm so sorry. üò≠ He was a cutie pie with a sweet face. 

Always remember, he knew you loved him. Never forget, because of you he had a great life and was always loved and cared for. It always takes time, but eventually you'll be able to think of him and smile instead of hurt. You'll always miss him but you will remember the good times and the funny things he did. 

After a while you'll be able to take in another cat that needs you and the loving, lifelong home you can give. Then you can make new happy memories."
rockinej,fdw57rc,t3_en69wh,"When my childhood dog passed away I regrettably tried to forget about him. I refused to look at pictures and I didn't want to cry... But what really helped me accept that he's gone is watching videos of him and crying it out. I didn't want his memory to die and I'd always tell stories of him until eventually it became more joyful than upsetting. Don't be afraid to remember him and speak about him as though he's still here, you may be in denial for a while and grief takes time but if you try to speed up the process and move on itlll only take longer. I'm so sorry for your loss and I wish you the best :)"
Sleepingseason,fdw8w00,t3_en69wh,"I'm really sorry for your loss. I lost a pet recently, and it is really hard. Understand that you can't rush this process, there's no speedrunning getting over a loss. Be patient and understanding with yourself, and try not to beat yourself up if you haven't moved on in a certain period of time. I think we can give ourselves an arbitrary time period in our head where we feel like we should've moved on by then, and then hold it against ourselves when we haven't. This is a normal part of grieving, but if we beat ourselves up over our process then that can hurt our ability to heal.

Take some time to focus on yourself, maybe focus your attention on another hobby you have or see this as the time to get started with a hobby you've always thought of picking up. If you have the spare time, maybe get involved in helping out animal charities. I'm sure they would benefit from your help a lot, and knowing that you're helping others (both animals and humans alike) can give you some happiness and a sense of fulfilment. Be gentle with yourself too, don't overburden yourself trying to give yourself ample distractions because you'll just burn yourself out. But don't give yourself so much spare time trapped in your thoughts that you can't move on. It's okay to have times when you just want to think about happy memories with your cat, and it's also okay to realise when those sad thoughts are going on and trying to distract yourself.

I know a lot of people will recommend getting a new pet, but don't feel as though you have to do this right away. You don't have to rush into the next pet, and having a new pet won't necessarily help with your feelings of loss. Take your time and be patient with yourself, and if you feel as though you're ready for (and wanting) a new pet then go for it. You wouldn't be letting your cat down by getting a new one, nor would you be letting your cat down by taking your time to heal."

TheElvenCyclops,fdw24v2,t3_en69wh,"I'm sorry, OP, I lost a cat to cancer too. losing a fluffy friend is never fun, I just focused on the fact that he's not in pain anymore and I did my best to give him a long and happy life. I went to a nearby shelter and hung out with the animals there (And later brought one of them home). the world goes on and the best we can do is keep the dead in our memories."
datdangdoe,fdw2ok4,t3_en69wh,"It‚Äôll take time for the pain to go away, you‚Äôll never stop missing him but when you‚Äôre ready I would highly recommend getting another kitten.

PrincessSassyBrat,fdw2u6t,t3_en69wh,"I'm so sorry for your loss.  Allow yourself time to grieve.  It truly is a process and one you can't rush.

JustAShyCat,fdw6of5,t3_en69wh,"I am so sorry for your loss. Take time to grieve for him, remember all the good times you had with him, and treasure those memories. You will be sad for a while, but that‚Äôs okay. Pets are family and losing a family member is never easy. Don‚Äôt be ashamed to cry.

I lost my family cat when she was 14 very suddenly (we suspect she had a stroke but have no confirmation). I was heart-broken and couldn‚Äôt talk about her for the longest time without tearing up (still do sometimes). I actually ended up adopting my own cat from a local humane society a little less than 2 years after her death, and my new fur baby has helped me move on so much.

My suggestion is to take time to process the loss and grieve, then, once you feel ready, adopt another kitty for your household. The new kitty is not a replacement for your lost boy, but rather the start of a new chapter for your life."

ALoudMeow,fdxhmxy,t1_fdw7g8k,I would definitely advise you wait.  I adopted a new cat a few months after my first died and it was too soon.  I resented the new kitty for not being the same as the other one and it took maybe a year before I could start to appreciate her for herself.  Don‚Äôt rush grief.
nixiedust,fdw85nw,t3_en69wh,"I am so sorry! I lost my cat to lung cancer at 18 and it still hurt more than anything. Allow yourself grieving time. It will hurt, but knowing that you stood by your boy and gave him a wonderful life is a good comfort. You did right by him for his whole existence, until his last moments, and that is beautiful. 

One thing that helped me was making a memory box for our cat. I found an old wooden box with a padlock on eBay. I put the box with her ashes inside, along with her favorite toys, some catnip, and other stuff she loved. It felt right to do something kind of Egyptian-style for a cat, and it comforts me to feel like she ""has"" everything she needs to rest comfortably."
Aeshaw90,fdx2z3o,t1_fdw85nw,"I love the memory box, that‚Äôs a great idea. I put my cat‚Äôs ashes in a suncatcher on my porch (it was his favorite spot), and had some of them infused into a stone that I wear on a necklace every day. It feels good to keep a little piece of him close to me all the time."
Codles,fdw9nfo,t3_en69wh,"Advice? Allow yourself to feel whatever you feel, as deeply and as powerfully as you feel it. Lean into the skid. Accept the pain, the hurt, the loss. Cry if you feel like crying. If you feel like ""nothingness"", embrace it. Angry? That's okay, too. 


Just give yourself permission to grieve in whatever way it unfolds. No right or wrong answer. Allow yourself to grieve fully. 


It'll make it so much easier if you give yourself permission to feel what you are feeling.

Spugnacious,fdz4526,t3_en69wh,"There is no getting over such a great cat. And look at that picture! He was obviously a great cat!

And that's the point. All those good memories come from that relationship. You loved him and he loved you and you had 11 wonderful years with him. 

It's good that you remember him, and remember what was. You are honoring his memory and him. And those memories make you sad because of the absence of what was there.

So like I said, there is no getting over a cat like that. You will remember him until the day you die. What you can do is get a new cat. A scared, lonely cat in a little shelter cage. A cat that needs someone to love him that he or she can love back. Take that cat home and start making new memories.

Eventually there will be more time between the times when you are sad. You will smile again, you will laugh again, and you will someday be able to look at his picture and not cry. 

Remember: all the good things he had in life were because of you. You loved him and cared for him and you gave him the best years he could have known. We go through multiple pets over our lives, but to them, we are their everything, so there are many many things to be happy about in regard to his life. Try to remember that, and know that he would want you to remember him fondly."

It's OK to be very sad and to grieve.  I always have had multiple cats and have experienced loss.  I prefer to not be by myself afterward, but don't necessarily want to interact with people.  Something to distract me from my grief.  When Charlie died, I went for a sunset walk out at the bay and spent the hour remembering our time together.  Went through quite a few tissues.

Find some close friends/family who want to hear some kitty stories and share them.  Post some photos and memorable stories on reddit or other social media.

For the first week or so, I frequently had to go find a place to be by myself to be sad and be weepy.  Focusing at work could be challenging.

Eventually, I hope you find room in your heart to go to the shelter and save the life of another kitty.

thx1138jr,fdwr1qc,t3_en69wh,"Sorry for your loss. What a sweetie. This poem is sad but has always helped me realize letting a pet go (I've lost four kitties in my life) is an owner's final gift of love.
‚Äú If it should be that I grow weak,
And pain should keep me from my sleep.
Then you must do what must be done,
For this last battle cannot be won.
You will be sad, I understand:
Don't let your grief then stay your hand.
For this day more than all the rest,
Your love for me must stand the test.
We've had so many happy years-
What is to come can hold no fears.
You'd not want me to suffer so;
The time has come, so let me go.
Take me where my needs they'll tend,
And please stay with me until the end.
Hold me firm and speak to me,
Until my eyes no longer see.
I know in time that you will see,
The kindness that you did for me.
Although my tail its last has waved,
From pain and suffering I've been saved.
Please do not grieve- it must be you,
Who had the painful thing to do.
We've been so close, we two, these years,
Don't let your heart hold back it's tears."""

The_Chaos_Pope,fdwyo14,t3_en69wh,"I'm so sorry for your loss. He looks like he was happy and well loved. 

It's ok to be sad. Give yourself some time to grieve. Distracting yourself with other things can appear to help but it doesn't take away the pain of the loss; you're going to have to absorb that. 

If you can, take some time off of work. If you want to be at home, be at home. If you want to go out, go out. If you have another cat (or cats), spend some time with them. 

If you need something constructive to do, find any pictures/videos/media you have for your boy and at the very least make sure that its backed up somewhere."
rebby2000,fdx06gu,t3_en69wh,"Honestly, the best advice is to let yourself grieve. It hurts and it's okay to hurt, but trying to ignore it or push past it faster just isn't going to work. For me, trying to do that can even make it last longer. So, let yourself grieve. But also remember that your buddy isn't hurting anymore and, if you believe in the afterlife, is somewhere they are happy."
Aeshaw90,fdx1p7l,t3_en69wh,"What a handsome boy! I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. Know that you gave him a beautiful life and that he is free of any pain or discomfort he was feeling. 

I lost my boy after only having him for 7 years (adopted him when he was 3), and I know it feels so unfair. This happened almost two years ago and I still think about him every day. You‚Äôll never stop missing him but eventually this hurt that you‚Äôre feeling now will change into something more manageable. Let yourself grieve this loss for as long as you need to and in whatever way feels best. 

Sometime in the future if you‚Äôre ready (whether that‚Äôs two months or two years from now), you might find comfort in adopting another cat. A new pet will never replace your love for this cute little boy, but you might be able to channel some of that pain into love for another kitty. That‚Äôs an idea for another day, since this loss is so fresh, but it might be worth revisiting later on.

Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents. I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see. As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive. In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life. Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.

Secondly, this is gonna sound counterintuitive, but hear me out: Don't TRY to move on. 

Let yourself mourn. Scream, cry, punch a pillow, eat an entire carton of ice cream. Anything that isn't self-destructive or harmful, let yourself do it. You are hurting and in pain. And that's okay. 

Releasing the sadness is both cathartic and neccessary. Trying to force healing is just going to cause you more pain down the road. 

Once you have let yourself grieve, try and distract yourself. Watch funny YouTube videos that make you laugh, go get lunch with friends, hell, just go grocery shopping. Anything to keep your body occupied. 

When you're ready, put his things away. Make a lovely box and respectfully put them away. If you get another cat, you can then bring it back out and reuse some of the stuff. Or just keep it as a precious memento of your friend. 

I've lost pets that I've had for years. The pain is intense and very real. But I promise you, while you will always miss your friend, the pain will get easier.

In six months, go to an animal shelter and rescue a kitten. I am NOT suggesting that you replace your cat, as cats are all individuals. This isn't just ""oh just get a new one"" as though they're all the same. What I'm suggesting is that go to the shelter and let yourself fall in love again, not as a replacement but just as a new friend who needs a home. I honestly think this is the best way to stop feeling quite so sad about missing your beloved pet. You give yourself time first to start to get used to life without them, and to mourn them, and then you fall in love with a new kitten, who helps you remember that life goes on and brings new joys, even without your old friend at your side."

ItsShovelyJoe,fdxs82t,t3_en69wh,"I am so sorry for your loss. The pain of losing a beloved pet is really the worst kind of pain. 

I‚Äôd like to share a story with you. Several years ago I was at a cat store next to the vet and a couple came in, eyes still swollen from crying. My heart broke for them because it was clear that they had just lost their pet. They were coming to the pet store to buy something to remind them of their pet. They ended up buying a cat Christmas ornament. They were crying as they checked out, but the woman told me that when the pain of the loss subsides and they instead look back on those memories positively without pain, they will be so grateful to have that ornament to remind them of the life of their cat and all the love they shared. I thought it was really beautiful. 

My other advice is be patient with yourself. You are mourning a great loss and that takes time. Let yourself feel how you feel. But know that you did the humane thing for your little guy, and that you gave him a wonderful life. He was lucky to have you as his owner. üíó"

‚ÄúThe only good thing about us living longer than our pets is that we get to save more than one of them.‚Äù

Losing a pet after a life journey together is the absolute hardest thing. And there are so many souls out there that need a special someone who will love them to save them. No cat could ever replace your cat; but there are so many different ways to love out there. Take your time, mourn and grieve, and know that you did everything you could to make your cat happy. His life was better because you were in it- that is all any owner could ever ask for."

But here I am, 2.5 years later and I still miss him dearly, but I feel happy knowing he had a good life and we didn‚Äôt let him suffer. 

OP- take the time to grieve. Some people won‚Äôt understand, but don‚Äôt let them make you feel you can‚Äôt mourn. You will always miss him, but it will get easier each day. They‚Äôre legit family so there is no set formula on grief. 

Give yourself time, remember all the good times you had. Everyone is different as to when they get a new companion- I waited a year before I was ready, some people wait barely a week.

ashw82,fdyc5to,t3_en69wh,"Right now you don't need to move on. There is time for that later. Grieve, let your self be sad and cry. Celebrate his life and your time together. I'm am so sorry for your loss. He will waiting for you on the other side of the rainbow Bridge"
Krazykatlady93,fdycuml,t3_en69wh,"Let yourself grieve his loss. And let yourself remember that you gave him a loving home and that he isn‚Äôt in pain now. He got to love you his whole life and you will love him your whole life, even if he isn‚Äôt with you anymore. 

Do something in his memory, if you can (examples: pay to sponsor a shelter cat, if you are burying him plant something pretty or a fancy rock or something near his grave, make or buy art to put in your room, make a memorial out of his fav toys/collar/bed/ stuff, if you are getting his ashes something like a nice urn or jewelry to keep his ashes in, a tattoo, there‚Äôs probably lots of other things. It‚Äôs really whatever you feel fits best for you though)

It‚Äôs cliche but time does make it easier. Losing my cat 3 years ago still hurts but it does hurt less now. At the beginning I felt like I‚Äôd never feel anything other than the pain of missing her but while it is still painful, I do feel other things. I do feel happy even when I miss her. I do feel lucky for the time I got with her even when I wish it had been longer.

If there is a pet loss support group in your area (some vets offices have these) that might be a good idea too.

And don‚Äôt let anyone pressure you into moving on or getting a new cat if you don‚Äôt want to. It can be helpful to get another cat if that‚Äôs what you want but you don‚Äôt have to. Take your time on that kind of decision."

Clear out all his toys from the house, they were HIS and always will be so when I suggest you visit shelters to find someone to rescue, you wont feel in conflict if they play with toys. Make all new belongings new for your new soul mate.  When searching, just look into their eyes and talk softly- you will know, they will pick you."

ginger_beck,fdyum0s,t3_en69wh,"i‚Äôm so sorry for your loss! i lost my cat last summer, and my best advice is to give it time. it hurts a lot at first but the longer you wait the easier it‚Äôll get. and though i know this is really clich√©, it‚Äôs also worth remembering that he‚Äôs not in pain anymore, and you did the right thing by letting him go. i‚Äôm sure you have lots of great memories with your cat, and surprisingly it actually helps to look back on those. i figured it would make it hurt worse, but it actually helped a lot when i lost my cat. 

go easy on yourself, too. everyone acts like losing a pet isn‚Äôt as bad as losing a human loved one, but your cat‚Äôs been your companion for 11 years, of course it‚Äôll take a  while to move on. don‚Äôt beat yourself up if you‚Äôre not moving on as fast as you think you ‚Äúshould‚Äù be, these things take time. don‚Äôt push yourself to get over her, because you can‚Äôt, you can only move on without her. 

finally, and this is obvious but still worth mentioning because when you‚Äôre grieving you think you‚Äôll be the exception to this rule but it‚Äôs always a bad idea, please resist the urge to get another pet. it will make you feel better for a little while, trust me, i know, i spent the afternoon after my cat died in petsmart looking at kittens lol, but sooner or later you will feel really guilty, and it‚Äôs not fair to your new pet if you only got him to get over your previous one. you‚Äôre better off waiting until you can give your new pet your whole heart. i‚Äôm only saying this to be safe, some people don‚Äôt even go through this. when my mom‚Äôs dog died she didn‚Äôt even think about getting another dog for like, seven years. i‚Äôm only saying it because i really wanted another cat after mine passed, i just wasn‚Äôt used to living without her, but a new cat wouldn‚Äôt have made it easier.

again, i‚Äôm so sorry. losing a kitty is like, one of the worst things in the world. i hope you feel better soon. i‚Äôm sure he was the best cat in the world."

The best advice I can give is to let yourself grieve, for however long you need to, and don't feel guilty about it. But don't let it overtake you. I threw myself back into work after I lost my girl, but still came home and cried myself to sleep because she was gone. I refuse to take her little urn out of its box because that would make it too final (even though it already is).

Some time ago I found this little text that I feel is always a source of strenght when this time comes.

It goes like this:

*""Before humans die, they write their last Will and Testament, give their home and all they have to those they leave behind.*

*If with my paws I could do the same, this is what I‚Äôd ask‚Ä¶*

*To a poor and lonely stray I‚Äôd give:*

*-My happy home.*

*-My bowl and cozy bed, my soft pillows and all my toys.*

*-The lap, which I loved so much.*

*-The hand that stroked my fur and the sweet voice which spoke my name.*

*I‚Äôd Will to the sad, scared shelter pet, the place I had in my human‚Äôs loving heart, of which there seemed no bounds.*

*So, when I die, please do not say ‚ÄúI will never have a pet again, for the loss and pain is more than I can stand‚Äù.*

*Instead go find an unloved pet, one whose life has held no joy or hope and give MY place to HIM or HER.*

*This is the only thing I can give‚Ä¶ The love I left behind.""*"

Time. You will never move on, but as cliche as this is, time will ease the pain. There is no rule book on how to handle your grieving. Take care of yourself and remember you filled his 11 years with so much love and joy.

Disease, parasites, accidents, other wild animals who may harm your cat, or the wild animals your cat harms. Bengals are a hybrid of a sort but definitely still a domestic controlled breed, it's not like you have a serval which shouldn't be a pet anyways. Theres pet strollers, harnesses which Bengals can stay in (seriously I work in the pet industry and see many people who do this with no issue, especially since you'd be with the cat the whole time and could see when it tries to slip out), catios.

I understand having high maintenance pets. J have a border collie. He needs mental and physical stimulation. 

How is your cat being fed? There are a ton of different interactive feeders out there or better yet use training for them to earn their meals. 

How much play do you do with them? 

How slowly did you introduce the harness, did you use a clicker and treats,  what different harnesses did you try that did not work. There are a lot of different options out there. First step is getting the cat fully comfortable  with a properly fitted harness. The cat wear the harness for every meal. Then you have the harness on and earn food or treats in the house. Then you add a leash. Then you try this in the backyard. 

Cats do need mental and physical stimulation. They do not need that being met by being outdoor cats. There is a lot you can do to provide and meet those needs for this cat you our purchased."

RandomGunner,fdjs83p,t1_fdj71qd,"Not really. My bengal is small and lean as a female and I had a solid harness made just for her. Kitty holster is the brand. Very sturdy, lot of material, it's a vest, not a bundle of strings your cat can easily get off."
jrdrinkingwine,fdj3q1b,t1_fdj2rr6,"People are framing this as domestic vs wild. That's not the case. They're either feral cats or house cats. It's incredibly difficult to tame a feral cat. And then there are a lot of cats that are partially feral. 

There are literally countries that have feral cats everywhere. Cats are incredibly intelligent and capable of navigating the outdoors on their own. They form colonies and go on without humans. Letting a cat outside is not some kind of wild sin (unless your cat is not neutered, then you're hella irresponsible). 

That being said, if you ever do adopt a cat from a shelter, it really should be kept inside. 

And just don't buy a cat. Never buy."

TheCatsMe0wth,fdi45bq,t1_fdhwo37,"Agreed. 

The cat doesnt *need* to be let out. If OP doesn't know how to properly control and provide a stimulating environment for their Begal cat, which is known to be full of energy, then OP shouldn't have that breed at all. 

It's clear that OP did **not** do their research before buying, and cannot handle the extra responsibility of providing a better environment for their cat so they chose the easy way out and let her outside, which is dangerous and cruel. 

There are many many risks; injury (which could have been avoided), diseases, exposure to the elements, mites, etc. Not to mention wreaking havoc on the local wildlife population. 

I sincerely hope that OP has taken most of these comments (minus the insults because it's neither productive or nice) into consideration and keeps their kitty indoors from now on. If not, u/__Darkwing__, PLEASE consider rehoming her to a family who CAN provide her with a better indoor environment."

It‚Äôs harder with her having been outside already, but that‚Äôs a choice you made and now have to deal with. She is not a wild cat (notice how she‚Äôs in a house). Also notice how you posted a picture of a life-threatening injury she sustained due to being outside.

Also notice which crowd is waving referenced facts/studies around, and which one is saying ‚Äúoh no don‚Äôt do that because my outdoor cat hasn‚Äôt died yet‚Äù.

I‚Äôm so very happy that your cat is on the way to a full recovery, but the picture you just posted is the strongest evidence imaginable that you need to keep her inside.

At LEAST get a fenced in yard, an outside cat room (sold online that you connect to an open window) or a sunroom for the cat, if you INSIST on keeping it outside. Or maybe get a leash and walk it outside. There are PLENTY of ways to give the cat outside time without it being out all night alone and almost dying.

Your kitty‚Äôs beautiful and I‚Äôm glad she survived. Now please never let her outside again,

I have for the past three years spent all my money and free time TNR-ing, fostering and adopting out and feeding/caring for abandoned, lost and feral community cats in my backyard. Most likely originate from a neighbor who let her unfixed cats outside. 

I‚Äôve seen a kitten hit and killed by a bus, a cat with a giant flap of rotten necrotic skin hanging off his neck, took in and fostered a cat with an infected leg wound. A cat down the street was stabbed and a cat elsewhere in my city was found alive and shot through with an arrow. Outside cats will contract parasites. I never want to have fleas in my house again. Ever heard of liver flukes? I know all the varieties of intestinal worms now. There are countless ways kitties can suffer outdoors. 

Two of my current ‚Äúcore‚Äù pet cats came from my backyard, a calico it took me nine months to tame and bring inside (I still feed her outside brother who I‚Äôve never been able to touch) and a part Maine Coone tabby boy, one of her playmates/suitors from outside. They are both content being indoor cats now.

Please keep your poor cat inside. As others suggested, she will enjoy playing with you (wand toys with feather on end have been a hit along w chasing red for from laser pointer) and going for walks on a harness/leash."
Toast_IS_Cannibalism,fdj4fhx,t1_fdj1wx6,"Please consider other options. I grew up in a very quiet suburb with a woodland not far away. 

Our oldest cat disappeared for weeks and came back with a huge gash that got gangrene. The vet was shocked he made it but he lost half his weight and never fully recovered. RIP Smokey

One of my earliest memories was seeing one of the family cats dead in the driveway because we was hit by a car in the street but crawled his was as close to home as he could. He never made it and was cold by the time we found him. RIP Jingles.

We had another family cat that was shot by the neighbors boys with BB guns- one got him in the eye and he eventually died from complications from it. RIP Sunny

The boys parents apologized but the damage was done. Just because you‚Äôre neighbors know your cat, it won‚Äôt stop stupid and dumb kids (or drivers in your case) from accidentally or deliberately hurting your cat. Or from fleas, ticks, raccoons, opossums, infections, and other harmful things. Nature is amazing, but it is also harsh.

Stop seeing the outdoors as the best option to make your pets life fulfilling- because more than likely something else‚Äôs will happen. Don‚Äôt waste the time and love you give your cat just to have it harmed while it‚Äôs outdoors.please, please take this from someone that had to seen very loved cats suffer because my family had the same thought that the outdoors was a good place for our cats. Learn from this."
katyusha8,fdjmaht,t1_fdj1wx6,I live in suburbs too and I see run-over and missing cat posts all the time. It‚Äôs mind-boggling that after having your cat injured once you are ok with her getting injured again or maybe even dying
discojing,fdj81qy,t1_fdj1wx6,"Wouldn‚Äôt this be a good time to re-train her to stay indoors since she is healing? Cats are fast learners and adapt to new routines quickly.

My friends cat was hit by a car and almost made it home ‚Äî died in her neighbors yard. All because she is is too lazy to close the windows / get a microchip doggy door. 

I know many people with bengals and even savannah cats that thrive with indoor life. My cat was rescued off the street and put into a shelter. He has no desire to go outside ‚Äî sometimes we take him for walks down the hallway in our building, but that‚Äôs it."
__Darkwing__,fdjw8k6,t1_fdjmaht,"No one‚Äôs kitty ever gets injured in our neighborhood. She roams in a school zone and doesn‚Äôt roam in the morning during the school craze.

catchupcatsup,fdijdkh,t1_fdig08o,"I'm not against letting cats outside while supervised, in an enclosure or on a harness. Free-roam is no go. Same goes for dogs - too many incidents have happened where pets have died prematurely because their owners decided to let them go anywhere they want without supervision - roadkill, people or pets injured, complaints from neighbors. That, and the bird population needs to stay free from human intervention (yes, you are responsible for your pets, and the animals in your area); do we not remember what happened to other extinct animals?"

I‚Äôm sure everyone hopes the cat gets well soon, but they also see that the owner is willing to continue risking their cat‚Äôs life.

And sure...cats are less happy inside...just like kids are less happy going to bed at bedtime and not eating candy. Part of being a responsible pet parent is keeping them safe, despite their urges. Just play with them, buy them a wheel, or even take them on walks. Don‚Äôt let them run wild to get shot, hit by a car, or fall sick.

And also, your cat won‚Äôt be unhappy inside if they aren‚Äôt let out in the first place. In addition, outdoor cats quickly adjust to staying inside and are plenty happy."
FirePixies,fdi3d5j,t1_fdhcxdz,"Bengals are domesticated animals. They are a breed of domestic cat. They aren't a subspecies of wild cat. They are literally just a high energy breed of domestic cat.

The amount of people I know who have bengals have never had their cat hit by a car. They also don't let their cats outside unsupervised.

If this cat is meant to be your pet and your companion, you have a responsibility to take care of her at all times. Keep her inside, and take her outside under your supervision. Get a custom harness made if her ""anatomy is different"". 

I know people love to project human characteristics onto animals, but they don't actually know the difference between inside living and outside living, if they've always been conditioned to live indoors. Mine is terrified of the outdoors. He would never survive outside. Yours very narrowly escaped death. 

Get a damn harness or give her to someone who can take care of her and keep her alive and well."

Zophixious,fdj7tgc,t3_elel20,The vet should've kept him judging by OP's incompetence.
__Darkwing__,fdj80k0,t1_fdj7tgc,"Counseling is a thing, better place to siphon your emotions. You are not constructive and are simply looking to vent. I accept constructive comments happily as I respect everybody‚Äôs opinion, but I have no respect for wanton venting. Please appreciate the picture and move on."
Zophixious,fdj84go,t1_fdj80k0,"You've received enough constructive criticism and don't listen, why should I bother?"
__Darkwing__,fdj8b3i,t1_fdj84go,"Because in a debate with pros and cons on either side, the opposite side is not necessarily right (or wrong). You are a hurt/damaged person and I hope you heal. Please find a different release for your negativity as far away from my kitty as possible. She doesn‚Äôt have room for bad vibes rn."
collectsparkles,fdjkzed,t1_fdj8b3i,"Except there are ZERO pros for your cat in being outside, only cons. The pros are all centered around what's easy for YOU. As many have already told you, Bengals are perfectly capable of living happy lives, safely indoors. They can also be trained to go on supervised walks outdoors. No one is saying that it's easy to keep a Bengal entertained indoors but that's what you take on when choosing to adopt a more energetic breed. It's so heartbreaking that you're being so stubborn and putting your own comfort and preferences over the wellbeing of your cat.

Did you know that many cat rescue organizations make you sign a contract explicitly agreeing that your cat will be indoors ONLY because it is factually safer for them and less harmful to the surrounding wildlife population? Did you know that some boarding houses for cats won't accept outdoor cats, as they are susceptible to different illnesses and put other cats at risk? Did you know that outdoor cats on average have much shorter lifespans?

Seriously, best of luck and a speedy recovery to your precious kitty. She's not just some animal though, she's your responsibility. You are her caretaker and you're letting her down with your laziness. You can keep repeating that she's wandering in a safe neighborhood but she's already been injured once and the statistics don't lie."
__Darkwing__,fdjwff5,t1_fdjkzed,"Thank you for your concerned comment. Letting your cat outside is not a sin and this injury is not my fault, she is pampered and taken care of. Please note that cats have different personalities and some really are happier going outside. Most of the world let‚Äôs their cats wander, and she‚Äôs in far better conditions here. Please take this argument to a suitable thread, but your concern really is appreciated."
RoamingRaptor,fdhygli,t3_elel20,"Poor Kitty! Min snapped her ligament in the knee and got the same chicken leg as yours. She's almost as good as new.

BadRobot007,fdiouto,t3_elel20,Pleased for you. Our cat (Bertie) wasn't so fortunate - sadly missed..
__Darkwing__,fdj43b0,t1_fdiouto,I‚Äôm sorry to hear. May he rest in peace.
Hopium4years,fdj9rfh,t3_elel20,"I sincerely hope she has a full recovery. And I sincerely wish you will use these weeks of indoor recovery to get her used to a happy (and likely much longer) life as an indoor cat.

My first cat was hit by a car. And killed. In a lovely, friendly suburb. I was devastated.

I have only had indoor cats since then.

I‚Äôve also learned in the meantime that cats kill a few BILLION birds in the U.S. every year - according to the Audubon Society, more than vehicles, buildings, and poisoning combined. 

Cats kill and injure lots of bunnies too (speaking of keeping them indoors around holidays only, cats make it a very UnHappy Easter for a lot of cottontails).

Domestic cats that are allowed to roam outside, unlike mountain lions and bobcats, function as an invasive species. Outdoor cats upset the normal balance and have an enormous negative impact. Your beautiful kitty has probably killed a large number of birds, and possibly a few bunnies."
__Darkwing__,fdj9u5o,t1_fdj9rfh,"‚ù§Ô∏è

I really do love comments like yours. It has been read and taken to heart."
__Darkwing__,fdjw1e0,t1_fdjn6ni,"I do not agree, but I make an effort to read every comment and I reply to almost all of them. As I said, they have been read and taken to heart. There is nothing wrong with giving an animal a bit of time outside and I‚Äôm tired of people telling me how to treat my cat. Please appreciate her and her good vibes and move on to a thread created for this debate."

hufflepoet,fdjdxne,t3_elel20,"If you can't (or refuse to) be a responsible owner, please find your cat a better home."
redytosell,fdj5uby,t3_elel20,"This cat needs a new owner right away, you are not fit. I read the comments, you are trying to play it off as cool and have the knowledge when you are going to get this ‚Äúbeast‚Äù killed. 

Cats are not beasts man, fucking wake up."
__Darkwing__,fdj62ng,t1_fdj5uby,"No they are not, I do not use that term derogatorily as she is a kind and gentle soul. Letting your cat out is owner‚Äôs choice and there are pros and cons either way. She was not happy despite our efforts and constant attention *and* her partner cat until let out. She is a smart and nimble creature. Accidents happen, tha my my for your concern but the hate is unwarranted."
redytosell,fdj663j,t1_fdj62ng,"Okay but you said that in different comments, you are contradicting yourself. 

Keep your cat inside or build a safe area to let off the energy. You are lazy otherwise and would rather get her killed"
__Darkwing__,fdj6ad7,t1_fdj663j,"Noted, but she is in a very safe and pet friendly suburb. Cats roam regularly. They rarely sustain injury. I respect your opinion, this is my choice on how to treat my kitty."
drivingalexis,fdj97km,t1_fdj6ad7,Safe... LOL. She got hit by a bloody car. I really hope someone picks up your cat and gives it a better life than you ever will.
__Darkwing__,fdj9hao,t1_fdj97km,"And I hope you find a better place to vent negative emotions. Constructive criticism is combed over and appreciated. I do not need to agree with you to respect your opinions. I do not respect your comment, as you suggest taking her away from her love, her family, and her best friend (our other cat). I am not the cruel one here..."
lokiapologist,fdjh202,t1_fdj9hao,You are not a responsible owner
lokiapologist,fdksunf,t1_fdkng6w,part of taking care of cats is not letting them outside by themselves even though they may want to go out. If your cat gets injured because you choose to let it roam freely outside that‚Äôs entirely your responsibility as the owner.

__Darkwing__,fdj0lj4,t1_fdiwe1y,"We aren‚Äôt entirely sure because we were not present, but the surgeon said that that‚Äôs what this looks like. She was out on Christmas Eve, unfortunately, and we hypothesize that a tipsy driver late at night coming home from a party hit her, because everyone in our neighborhood knows her and would‚Äôve known to contact us."
Freeloafer,fdj5vdw,t3_elel20,"I Wish that this picture came with a good story. Cause all that is stuck to me head right now is a specsavers commercial. (Something about grandma and a turkey)

jehovahslitness,fdjiy8a,t3_elel20,"What I think a lot of people are trying to tell you, is although your kitty may love roaming and playing outdoors like so may of our pets do, it‚Äôs your job to stop that behavior or find another outlet. Like having a child, much of what they want to do is dangerous and unhealthy, and although they want to do it we are the grownups, we have the responsibility to say no."
__Darkwing__,fdjwp2f,t1_fdjiy8a,"Thank you for trying to rephrase, but I have enough comments telling me how to care for my cat. I respect the lack of jargon in your comment, and wish you a lovely day."

I'm so glad she's watching over you & hope you get well real soon! Kitties have an uncanny sense of when we need extra TLC. I know this to be true because, 30 years ago when my husband had cancer and was acutely ill from chemo, we had 4 cats (mother & 3 kiddos) do the same for him as your little sweety is doing for you. They would each take turns cuddling up to him, and when one would leave to eat or go to the litterbox, another one would immediately take their place. It was incredible and so very comforting. My husband has been healthy & cancer-free since then and our furry little healers certainly did their part  <3"

Zerstorer_der_Welten,fdpau1s,t3_em8ob9,"My cat used to do this when he couldn't find a dark place to sleep near me, often when I closed the curtains he would adjust himself to a more circular position and proceed to enter a deep sleep.  But every cat is different so yours just might like the comfort factor of nose on surface action, there is however a small, very slim chance of medical reasons like Epilepsy and tumorous growths and some cats can lie like this for a form of relief from the symptoms, but as I said it is a very very slim chance, and certainly wasn't why my boy done it, he just liked the darkness. :)"

Granock,fdguhrw,t3_el81o7,"what is his story?

i'l lend you an ear"
Ishikama,fdhtaka,t1_fdguhrw,"I said it below in another thread, but I'll put it here too! He's a rescue baby ‚ò∫Ô∏è

The first photo is about a week after initially bringing him home. He was so tiny, and very weak. He slept for 2 days straight, which had me so worried, but quickly regained strength and energy after eating a good meal and drinking some water.

He was found outside a vocational building by a professor and brought to my high school by a friend near the end of the school year. He ended up taking the mom and the rest of the litter to a local shelter, but where this kitten had a wound on it's head, he ended up keeping it and trying to find it a home so it wouldn't be put down. 

One of my friends was taking classes there when I was a sophomore in high school and volunteered to bring the kitten back with her to school to find it a home. She smuggled him in her bag and hid him in the math room. The teacher was surprisingly ok with it, even though she was a bit on the stricter side. Well, word spread around the school about the kitten and I heard about it during lunch, and I knew immediately then that I needed him. I had lost my best kitty about a year before this, a gigantic, orange, fluffy tom cat I named Nehow. I needed a fluffy companion, and this kitten needed a loving home. 

I called my dad, told him about it, and the only thing he did was ask me what color it was, and if it was a boy or girl. After telling him the kitten was an orange boy, he was like ""well, your mom isn't gonna be happy about, but bring him home."" My dad also has a soft spot for big, dumb, orange boy cats.

At the end of the day, I met up with her in the math room, got the kitten, went to the store for supplies, and he's been with me for almost 6 years now! 

We still have absolutely no idea where his other ear went either. When he first came to me, he did have a red sore wound on that side of his head, but it healed quick. He also has a crooked jaw, and when he looks at you, he has the cutest little crooked toothed smile. 

He's been to the vet every year since then for shots and check ups, but even when they shaved his head and tried to figure it out when he got fixed, still no clue. He was either attacked, or born that way, but it honestly doesn't matter. He's not bothered by it, and is still the best boy ever to me üíô"
XDkacperXD,fdgexli,t3_el81o7,He doesn't have an ear? ‚òπÔ∏è
Ishikama,fdgfbdf,t1_fdgexli,"Nope! He still has the little hole where his ear would be, just no outer ear. He's been to vet every year, and they even shaved his head and tried to figure out what happened, but we honestly have no idea. He was possibly attacked as a very young kitten, or it could be a birth defect. It doesn't bother him at all, but we also aren't sure how well, if at all, he can hear on that side. 

He's also got a crooked jaw where one of his teeth pokes out the side. It doesn't bother him at all either, other than needing dental treats and a teeth cleaning every so often. It does make him have the cutest little crooked toothed smile when he looks at you though ‚ò∫Ô∏è

He's become quite the legend at my local vet too. Every time we come on for his yearly shots all the vet techs have to get pictures of him and the new ones have to be introduced to the the one eared Van Gogh cat üòÜ"
XDkacperXD,fdmsmng,t1_fdgfbdf,Okey ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Rogleson,fdgpaxd,t3_el81o7,"We have a one eared ginger boy too. He got out in a deep snow and lost his to frostbite. We still think he's the handsomest, and now he doesn't try to get out any more."
Ishikama,fdhry32,t1_fdgpaxd,"I have such a huge soft spot for big, dumb, ginger kitties. Other than my first ever cat, a black cat that I named shadow, all of my best kitty companions have been orange boys.

I love your story and how you adopted him! He is the cutest and deserves all the love!

They are our babies after all!‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you for taking him in and loving him so much! Give him lots and lots of snugglesüêæ"
ablackcatstail,fdgskf7,t3_el81o7,Just curious but what happened to his left ear?
Ishikama,fdhswog,t1_fdgskf7,"We're not sure! He came to me as a super tiny little thing and had a big red patch on that side of his head, but it healed really quickly. When he was old enough to take to the vet for shots and a check up, they looked him over but couldn't figure it out. Then when he went in to be fixed, they actually shaved his head and tried to see if there were any signs of scar tissue or anything. 

Turns out, he still has the little hole where his ear would be, just no outer ear. We don't know of he can hear out of that side though. He's also got a crooked jaw where one of his teeth pokes out the side, but he's not bothered by any of it other than needing dental treats and a teeth cleaning every so often. It does make him have the cutest little one toothed smile when he looks at you though! 

The best we can guess is he was either born with it as a birth defect, or something attacked him as a newborn. Though, you wouldn't be able to tell any of it by his behavior, he's definitely the king of this household now üòÜ"
ablackcatstail,fdhw97f,t1_fdhswog,Nice! Well thank you for giving a lot of love to the perfectly imperfect cat. This from a perfectly imperfect human being like myself.
Ishikama,fdi70tz,t1_fdhw97f,"Honestly, same. Van's been with me for the last almost 6 years, through all my family troubles, 3 houses, a year and a half of highschool, almost 3 1/2 years of college, and all the trials and tribulations life throws at me. 

I do have a good group of friends, a loving boyfriend, and my family, but I think the best thing about having an animal companion is that they don't care about how imperfect we are. All they know is love, and they give it unconditionally. They dont care if you eat chicken noodle soup and watch youtube videos for 4 hours straight, or stay up all night working on a ceramics project, or if you haven't brushed your hair and taken off your pajamas. They're the best and deserve all the love in the world üíô"

bravepalmtrees,fdryihd,t3_emxdnk,"This is Maria- we adopted her and her baby from a high kill shelter in Tijuana. She's four years old and the absolutely light of our life even though we've only had her and her baby for about two years shes an unreal cat. She waits for us by the door when we come home, meows hello when we say her name, cuddles and purrs. We always call her our ""Therapy cat"" because whenever we're upset or crying she runs over and crawls into our lap until we calm down. She's even tried to pull us out of the shower before because she doesn't think we want to be there in the water!!   


About four months ago We packed up her and her baby (Kittan) And moved across the country from San Diego to Maryland but a few weeks after we arrived she started sneezing- then a tumor popped up. We thought it was nasal cryptococis but....a quick test confirmed Nasal Lymphoma. We were devastated, but decided to go with radiation treatment. A whole lot of driving (and 10,000$ later;seriously check out your pet insurance options- we thought we would be covered and we weren't :/ ) its been such a relief to see her looking and acting like her old self again!!!   


We go back in for a CT scan in three months to see if the cancer is still present. If its not; yay! Remission, we could have anywhere from 2-5 years before the cancer pops up again. If its still there we'll try to get our finances together enough to do chemo.   


she's an amazing little girl and worth the whole world to us! Please guys, hug and snuggle your pets and live every day like it may be your last with them. Her cancer came out of left field we would have never expected it. Im just happy shes doing well now <3"
Claudiana96,fds7qql,t1_fdryihd,You guys are amazing.. They are lucky cats :)

Come! I want to be lucky enough to see her grow old :)"
bravepalmtrees,fdtg8am,t1_fdtffpb,"YEAH you‚Äôre telling me. We had pet insurance so the way that our works is reimbursed- you pay for the treatment then they send you the money. We had a 500$ deductible and it covered up to 12,000$. So we got a loan and figured we‚Äôd pay if off when insurance came through but they ended up refusing to cover her; and we had already had her treatment. 

In all honesty we would have found a way to make it work anyway- even if we weren‚Äôt banking on insurance. Lymphomas are highly responsive to radiation and she‚Äôs still so young that we had to try everything for her.  I‚Äôm literally doing one whole paycheck for rent and one whole paycheck for her cancer treatments but idk we lived in San Diego- I‚Äôm good at being poor. 

BUT THATS WHY it‚Äôs really important to get GOOD pet insurance. Pet plan is like 19$ a month for a pet and has a 300$ deductible and covers up to 15000$ and they‚Äôre apparently much better at giving out money. It‚Äôs a hard lesson to learn and the next couple
Months are gonna SUCK but they‚Äôd suck so much more without Maria in them !"
bravepalmtrees,fdvf8ct,t1_fduna21,"RIGHT at some point it‚Äôs just like; we‚Äôve come this far and honestly everything worth it. We ended up having to get two CT scans because her tumor changed drastically between the three days of between her first CT scan and her radiation but our vets were amazing. When they heard our insurance denied us they knocked off the price of the second CT scan and all of the medication they used (sedatives etc) because they said she was ‚Äúso small they hardly used anything‚Äù they ended up saving us around 5K; cyber knife vet clinic in Malvern PA has some of the most amazing human beings you‚Äôll ever meet!! 

And yes, as soon as we pay off our debts I‚Äôm going to start saving towards a 5K emergency pet fund! Pet costs can be so expensive but it‚Äôs so worth it to see them healthy & happy! I‚Äôm so glad you treated your pet too!!!! They absolutely deserve every penny."

GoldenEyedHawk,fdte18c,t3_emxdnk,"Random question, how does radiation therapy go for animals? Have a strange image of a poor little balding kitty who has to regrow fur or wear sweaters once done with treatment"
bravepalmtrees,fdtf9xp,t1_fdte18c,"Good question! Hers was a nasal lymphoma so it was treated with a special technology called cyber knife radiation. Think of it like a giant robot arm that lasers radiation directly into the cancerous tumors- they use this on people too it‚Äôs an incredible technology! Because her cancer was so localized to her nasal passage this was the most effective treatment of radiation. She didn‚Äôt experience any hair loss side effects but it‚Äôs totally normal for animals to experience hair loss after radiation. The hair falls out and then grows back in white or silver- If that happened to her it wouldn‚Äôt be so noticeable since her fur is white there all ready; it‚Äôs much more startling to see those changes on a black or orange cat! We could have also seen discharge from her eyes and burns in her mouth/ around the radiated area but we got very lucky and didn‚Äôt see any side effects at all :)   The did however shave her stomach  for an ultrasound (to make sure there was no cancer in her organs) right when it was getting cold she she has a robe she wears on cold days until her fur grows back. 

If the cancer had spread farther and into her organs we would have gone with chemo instead- there would be no way we could radiate her whole body. Cats can handle chemo surprisingly well; dogs too- their bodies both handle it way better than human bodies do and most are back to their normal selves a few hours after treatment.  

Honestly hair loss,blistering, all of that is a possible radiation side effect (though chances of those are slightly lower using cyber knife because of the precise nature of it- less cells exposed to radiation) and we got really lucky she didn‚Äôt have to deal with any of that :)"
GoldenEyedHawk,fdtis0h,t1_fdtf9xp,"Makes sense. The less cutting needed the better, laser and cyberknife are doing wonders. Good that it doesn't bug them as badly as it does humans, chemo and radiation are rough on humans. Hope she continues to get better and doesn't have any recurrences"

This will be a tough time to get used to a new reality, one we would do almost anything to avoid, but unfortunately can't. My best advice is to grieve your way and at your own pace.  When we've had our furbabies that long they are like our best friend. I used to call mine my furkid.  Mine, also after 17 years which felt like it had just flewn by, I still feel her presence after 2 years of being gone. I believe there are alot of things in this world we don't understand, such as ""feeling"" her presence somehow. Perhaps its my mind still trying to deal with a super deep connection I felt with her and now she's not here!!!  Don't get me wrong. Time does help to deal with the loss, but we never can forget them.  Whatever the real truth is, try to take care of yourself through all this.  Try to eat as best as you can.  Sleep when you can.   Allow yourself quiet time if you need it. Take your time.  Don't let anyone rush you through the stages of grief.  Everyones' is a little different due to specific details. Mine was within a few weeks after open heart surgery. Other folks have other circumstances. I don't know what circumstances in your life that your dealing with besides this, but please know that I will pray for you and I send my deepest condolences."

mssarac,fdva3fy,t1_fdux9zf,"I want to get a second cat but mine is soooo possessive I know it would be really hard on her. I took care of a colleague's kitten for ten days, she barely made it, she spent ten days hissing at this poor kitty like crazy, although in the end she started licking her, don't ask me why. But I could tell it was traumatising. How long did it take for your cats to get along? Did you do something in particular to help? How did the new kitty react to all that?"
Strosity,fdvgpoe,t1_fdux9zf,I just moved and my 2 started doing it again. They got better in a couple days but they still hiss when they‚Äôre close. They used to get into friendly kitty wrestling over who‚Äôs licking who‚Äôs head. They‚Äôll be back soon enough.

ilikespamandcornbeef,fdvhbl5,t1_fdva3fy,"It took a few weeks for sure. We tried separating them with those wooden child barrier, but the older cat would just hop over and head boop. New cat was just around 8-9 weeks old so she didn‚Äôt know what was going on when she got head booped.  I think what helped was the new cat would play with my Yorkie and the older jerk cat would just watch. Eventually older cat got used to the new one and they all got along. Now my two cats are the best of friends. I sometimes feel bad for my third cat(my yorkie) she tends to get left out now."
Crober45,fdwagox,t1_fdva3fy,"We had a cat we were concerned wouldn't adjust well to a second cat, so we talked to her vet and got Zylkene and Feliway and used them every day for the first week and there was still some hissing at first but now they are inseparable!"

Crober45,fdxcdv0,t1_fdwkfac,Zylkene is a natural supplement for cats and dogs that helps with anxiety but doesn't require a prescription and Feliway is a hormone spray for cats that helps them relax.

RebelMountainman,fdnwvzz,t3_embwcr,"Yeah but there are hundreds of thousands out there like her. This country has to start seriously thinking about licensing breeding to stop the over population of feral cats in the US. I live near Fresno California and that county alone in 2015 euthanized over 40,000 unwanted cats and kittens. Feral cats are responsible for wiping out bird populations. Something has to be done we need breeding laws in this country. Cats make great pets but when they are outside and feral they wreak havoc on the environment"
keekeeVogel,fdo1cf8,t1_fdnwvzz,"Yep. Could not agree more. When I find out someone breeds cats or dogs and just today rabbits ( which are euthanized just as often)  for money it makes me seethe. I‚Äôve worked in shelters in 4 different parts of the country. They‚Äôre always too much work after their adorable stage. I just don‚Äôt get why you don‚Äôt need an approved license to breed. When I lived in Orange County I met a girl that was trying to find someone that had a pit bull to breed hers for money. I was livid. I‚Äôve seen more pit bulls that have stolen my heart than any other breed put down but there are just too many of them. Then people like this, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs breed more‚Äù

We did not become friends. 
My dog was bred and it pisses me off to know she was just a factory for someone to make some cash. She‚Äôll never have to know that again.

Also here‚Äôs my story about living in Orange County. I met a woman who said she just gave her first down payment for her dog. I said ‚Äúthe shelters are over populated very badly.‚Äù She said ‚Äú I‚Äôm not taking a broken dog, I‚Äôm broken why would I want that?‚Äù 

Yeah we didn‚Äôt become friends either. My dog came from a puppy mill. She spent her life in a cage being bred. For the rest of her life all she will know is warmth, kisses, treats, bed, play time and a family that absolutely adores her."
guardianfire,fdos3zx,t1_fdnwvzz,"I grew up around Fresno CO and I agree that it could use more strict breeding laws, but ultimately I think it‚Äôs a cultural issue of people not valuing animals. I frequently heard / saw animals dumped in the orchards because they became pregnant or litters abandoned after moms gave birth. 

People like the idea of owning pets, but not the responsibility of them. Even if they had responsible breeders If the owners aren‚Äôt responsible for getting them spayed and neutered it won‚Äôt resolve the problem."
oldcat007,fdp8dji,t1_fdnwvzz,Stopping breeders won't affect this in the slightest.  Ferals breed on their own and the populations only mix to a small extent.
imalwayslostok,fdoc2ek,t1_fdo1cf8,I really dislike when people pay thousands of dollars for fancy cat breeds because they‚Äôre ‚Äúpretty‚Äù when there are so many homeless cats in shelters.
RebelMountainman,fdo9qbw,t1_fdo1cf8,"I love all animals as a kid my brother and I trapped he used grabbers and I made my own box traps that didnt harm the animals. We both had foxes as pets. I love cats and dogs and have had several, but what bothers me is seeing the feral cats destructive behavior on the environment and Eco systems. I live near Yosemite and at one point I had no wildlife on my property at all because of the feral cats killing everything, and I do mean everything. I had no snakes, lizards I feed the birds, and they wouldn't land on my property because of the feral cats. I ended up having to trap them and send them to the pound to be euthanized. I guess it has gotten so bad in some Cal coastal cities they have enacted laws and stopped people from giving away kittens in the newspapers and at stores, but they will not enact licensing laws which is stupid."
keekeeVogel,fdovb7y,t1_fdo9qbw,"I really didn‚Äôt know that they had an effect on the eco system. I‚Äôve never had a cat or dog that I didn‚Äôt fix right away. Or keep indoor. (My cat was feral and terrified of going outside after we took him in) I fixed him the second I knew we were keeping him. That should be a law too. 

The shelter I got my dog from is huge. I mean huge. Like separate pavilions huge. They have a ‚Äúred alert‚Äù which means many of them are going to be euthanized tonight. My heart is breaking. Nothing I can do but encourage people to not buy and to fix your fucking animal so I don‚Äôt have to see these desperate for just a chance faces I see. And they know. They smell it. They have to be dragged. They know. It‚Äôs the worst feeling I‚Äôve ever felt. And I have accept it until people learn."
PrincessFuckFace2You,fdnvavj,t3_embwcr,Freaking adorable! Thanks for being a good human.
NyQuilneatwaterback,fdorhp6,t3_embwcr,"Wait wtf, there's such thing as a kitten exterminator??????? üò¢"
theonesixsix,fdosttm,t1_fdorhp6,"Right? I mean, idk what they actually do with them when they catch them, but my understanding is that they are in the business of getting rid of ‚Äúnuisance‚Äù animals, not re-homing them. All I could think about was the creepy child catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang luring kids with lollipops and I was like Hell no, this chicks coming home with me. Best decision ever!"
marauding-bagel,fdp9777,t1_fdosttm,"If you are in the United States then the animal control will be part of the local government and will take healthy animals to a traditional shelter. Many people label these as ""kill shelters"" juxtaposed with ""no-kill shelters"" which in reality also euthanize animals. Traditional shelters are not evil places that love killing animals contrary to how many talk about them.

The difference is that Traditional shelters take in every animal brought to them regardless of it's condition. Say a shelter can house 100 cats. If it is a no-kill shelter once it has hit 100 it can refuse to take anymore cats, turning away anyone who brings one. If it is a traditional shelter it has to accept the 101st cat even though there is no where to put it. At that point they are forced to put down a cat to not be over max capacity. No-kill may seem better, but by turning away that 101st cat they may have doomed it to a horrible death out on the streets or created a scenario where it will breed and create cats 102-106. 

It's good you took in the kitten, circumventing the entire system to keep a cat out, but there is very little chance it would have been ""exterminated"". Kittens are highly sought after from shelters and very adoptable. The worst case is that it would have tipped over the capacity and a much older cat, probably a sick one, would have been put to sleep to make space. Just make sure when they're old enough you get them fixed! Have give them a hug from me!"
NyQuilneatwaterback,fdou3fe,t1_fdosttm,"yes, thank you for taking this one in. plus she honestly looks like she's gonna be a real special cat. the stray pet problem in the us makes me really sad and angry. when someone takes in a stray, they're doing one of the best things they can do in life imho. it really matters."

All will come to us for rubs and pets but they sure don't like the other cats.  They love our two dogs, though. I guess what I am saying is, unless you like drama, you might keep the kit as an only child. We don't like the drama but we live in feral kitty central and I pet sit to keep them in vet visits, food, and meds."

mazzlestar,fdp5ip6,t3_emjppw,"I'm so sorry for your loss, I know it's awful to hear it happened when you're not there. If you're feeling up to it, maybe you could tell me a bit about her? Her name, how old she was, your memories of her? But if it hurts too much, that's fine too.

Just know that cats aren't stupid, she knew you loved her even when you went away. It's gonna suck the next time you go back and she's not there, but it will get easier. Treasure the love and companionship she gave you, and try not fyi compare your grief to your family's - everyone is different and this is about you and your kitty, no one else."
billykeke,fdp6hxk,t1_fdp5ip6,"Thanks a lot. Her name was Meowy, my sister named her cause she meowed a lot. She was 4 when we adopted her along with her brother and she passed last week at 14. She would've been 15  somewhere in June or July I believe. I feel like all cats she was a bit annoying and sometimes I would get frustrated but I loved her. I never thought she would pass when I was away. If I had known I feel I would have showed her even more before I left. She would meow on my door every morning and night to call me for food or to let her in. I'm going to miss that a lot. It just feels weird because my sister was especially close to her and she didn't seem phased at all. Just feels wrong to be crying so much over it when my sister was even closer to her and doesn't seem to care at all."
mazzlestar,fdp79wn,t1_fdp6hxk,"She was beautiful, I have three ridiculously overgrown boy cats at the moment and you're right, they're always a bit annoying (how do they always get RIGHT under your feet when you're walking somewhere!?) but we love them. You will miss her, of course, she was your companion for a decade! But for all those years, you had each other, and that is a beautiful thing :) as for your sister, there could be lots of reasons for her seeming not to care - she may have already done her grieving privately, she may not want to worry you because you're far away, she could just not want to upset you more, it's impossible to know for sure. But I can tell that Meowy was a much-loved, shouty little monster, and in time you will remember her demanding meows with love but with less pain. Unfortunately, this is just the price we pay for the gift of their companionship - they leave a big hole in your heart when they leave."
ALoudMeow,fdpfqq6,t1_fdp6hxk,"Everyone mourns differently; don‚Äôt compare your expressions and feelings with anyone else‚Äôs.  It sounds like Meowy loved you a lot, choosing to come to you so often.  She clearly knew she could depend on you.  May her memory be a blessing."
miserablepileoftits,fdptw4t,t1_fdp6hxk,This made me teary eyed and I don‚Äôt know you or this beautiful kitty. Nothing wrong with you at all. You‚Äôre human and it‚Äôs ok to have emotions. Maybe it‚Äôs affecting your sister in other ways that you can‚Äôt see right now.
WampaCat,fdq3qgd,t1_fdp6hxk,I‚Äôm so sorry about your sweet kitty. Maybe if you are feeling like you can‚Äôt express your feeling a to your family your sister is feeling the same way? Maybe she thinks you don‚Äôt care and everyone just doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing how sad they are. Thanks for sharing about Meowy here and her adorable photo ‚ù§Ô∏è
acctforsadchildhood,fdp9nxe,t3_emjppw,"I don't get people losing pets and having the ""meh"" response. I'm so sorry OP. I know it hurts, really, really bad. The same thing happened to me, except my family was devastated too."
raddler99,fdqxcur,t1_fdp9nxe,"Its sad, but unfortunately some people see animals as an expendable being. Its there for some entertainment when they want it and when its gone it's easily replaced. I use to be that person, but with age, my compassion has grown. I also finally having two of my own cats, and I treat them like they're my kids."
HadHerses,fdpuxqb,t3_emjppw,"I'm sorry for your loss.

Just some anecdotal advice that I hope helps...I have a feeling your family back home are devastated, but you're not together to experience the grief together.

As someone who has lived on the other side of the world to my family for nearly a decade, connections to home become amplified. I know you'd also be devastated back home, but because you're away, it always makes the pain so much worse and it is hard to gauge people's reactions back home.

Since I've been away, I have two family cats pass, two grandparents, and aunt and an uncle. Trust me, I know what it's like to experience grief when you're so far away. It's harder. It feels more intense. 

People back home try to limit my grief by acting together, tough and strong even though they're far from it. I was upset my family cats pass, but I would be further upset if I knew my parents weren't handling it well.

I think your cats loss is being felt by everyone, and you're not alone in what you're feeling."
mpls123456,fdp5ilo,t3_emjppw,This photo is adorable. So sorry for your loss.
keekyfreaky,fdqhgtg,t3_emjppw,"Check animal shelters near your parent‚Äôs, are they the type to surrender her since it seems like you‚Äôre the only one who cares about her wellbeing"

kykapoo,fdpkucw,t3_emjppw,"Your feelings are valid, please know that. Don't try to hide it, just focus on yourself and the love that you had for her. It doesn't matter what they think or how they react, we all grieve differently. I wish you the best. I lost my cat a little over a year ago and easily cry about her if I think too long. She loved you and that's why you feel pain. You have her a good life. Let yourself hurt and time will lessen the ache without taking away your good memories."
gehazi707,fdq3ik8,t3_emjppw,"It‚Äôs so wonderful to see all the loving responses from the reddit cat family.  This family understands your pain and feels it too.  Are there people in your life right now in this country you‚Äôre in that you can share this with?  I know it‚Äôs horribly vulnerable to share grief, but sometimes letting it flow is part of the healing.  I once broke into ugly-crying shaking bawling in the dentists office when the lovely sensitive receptionist asked me how I was... I was so embarrassed at first but they were all very accepting‚Äîtotal strangers‚Äîand it really helped me.  I hadn‚Äôt realized my feelings were so deep."

To me losing one of my cats would probably feel like losing a family member. Because basically, they are a family member."
CornChippyFeet,fdq86dl,t3_emjppw,"What a beautiful friend. I'm so incredibly sorry for your loss. My kitty passed away a few days ago, too, and when I saw your title it made me cry because I relate so much. When I told my mother about her passing she responded similarly to yours. Like my car broke down or I caught a cold, not like I lost my best friend. Some people have no empathy or perhaps can't express it, but that will never take away from the love you have in your heart. Internet hugs to you fellow cat lover."

OgreSentByCyberlife,fdqk3up,t3_emjppw,Sorry that happened
magearon,fdqmvh5,t3_emjppw,"I'm so sorry you lost her while you were away :(. I'm sorry you feel like you have to go through his alone, too. I lost my cat a little more than a year ago so I remember how it feels to lose a beloved pet. It'll get better over time, but for now the best thing you can do it just cry it out. Put on a sad song and just cry it out. You'll feel a lot better afterward, trust me."
karenreddit999,fdqs6np,t3_emjppw,"Sorry ‚Äî know the feeling. My cat and my horse both died the first semester after I went to college. The cat I knew was ill , but the horse? ... Hmm ... I always suspected that my dad drove her to the knackers so he wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about her feed and water in the winter, even though she was pastured and mostly took care of herself."

I know the pain you are going through and I wish I could help more. If there‚Äôs anything I (or the whole reddit family) can do, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask."

Topsyroxy,fdpsbp9,t3_emjppw,I too am sorry for your loss. It's always hard when you loose you're first four legged best friend. There will be a day when you can remember her happily. Until then feel everything you want. They deserve the mourning. We are lucky to have them.

mypetitmal,fdpvck4,t3_emjppw,"I'm so sorry for your loss. Meowy looks like an awesome kitty. You'll most likely feel her absence when you go home, and it'll be sad, but I hope you find comfort in the memories you shared with her. Sending comforting hugs"

neuromantic92,fdpx8b2,t3_emjppw,"I'm so sorry for your loss. 

When my boy was put down, I think it seemed like I was blase and cold about it. 

In actual fact, I was hanging on by the skin of my teeth, and I knew I had to shut off my feelings until we'd gotten through it and put on a brave face. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to do it and I would have made a hysterical decision that would have prolonged his suffering selfishly.

I got home and cried for six consecutive days. 

I'll bet your parents are putting on a brave face too."
ParsnipPizza2,fdpywf8,t3_emjppw,"I'm so sorry for your loss.

My dog Bear got lymphoma about a month after I left for college. I missed all but a week of the last three months of his life, and we had to put him down the day after I got back from my first semester. I know it hurts really badly that you weren't there more, and I'm sorry you couldn't be there to say goodbye. But I promise, Meowy knew she was loved. She sounds like she was a happy kitty, and I'm sure she'll be waiting for you (if you believe in any kind of afterlife.)

I know it feels like the world should stop spinning. Just take things one day at a time. It still hurts to think that my boy should be here, but it's gotten better over the year. You can survive this, I promise ‚ù§Ô∏è"
elfshimmer,fdq156u,t3_emjppw,"My cat passed away when i was living overseas. I was absolutely devastated - he had been in the vet hospital and was fine but had a heart attack. My parents called me while I was at work and I lost it. 

This happened 10 years ago and i still regret that I wasn't there but i know that I did the best thing for him by leaving him in a world he knew and felt comfortable in, rather than dragging him across the world for my sake. 

It feels like your family doesn't care but it's difficult to know.  They may be hiding their own sadness from you to help you feel better.  What's important is your own emotions and feelings, focus on them and not your family.

It is really painful and the first few trips home are really difficult but it passes with time. 
The pain eases and you can focus on the beautiful memories you had together. The love you have for your cat never dies, and the love they have for you doesn't die either. 

*hugs*"

He was a little skittish at first, but wanted to chase leaves and was doing the cute little chatter thing cats do when they see birds.

I was so depressed after my last girl died (Reina), that nothing could pull me out of it. I finally did something that I had never done before and bid on an auction to name a serval (she almost died from being so malnourished) who was rescued and taken to a sanctuary. I won and now I always go to the sanctuary's site to see how Reina ""#2"" as I call her is doing. I obviously miss Reina so much, but seeing a new Reina grow up and play and have a whole new personality makes the loss a little bittersweet. If that makes sense. 

I hope that the pain and sadness get a little easier each day for you."

And my science teacher told me to leave since I was supposed to go and I did and I got in saw my sister and Mom crying they told me we were going to the vet to spend his final moments with me and that's what happened."

g_pelly,fdsiiox,t3_en03rv,"I am absolutely gutted right now.   I feel like a druid without an animal companion.  Just broken.

The worst was walking home with no cat at the door to greet me.

At least she isn't suffering and was surrounded by love in her final moments.  15 years was a hell of a run and she was a great cat.

I hope I'll have a bond with another cat as strong as this one day.  


EDIT: Thank you for the gold, kind stranger!  My first Reddit award <3"
bonbonashley,fdsjoap,t3_en03rv,Absolute Angel. I‚Äôm so sorry for your lose. I was a wreck when I lost my childhood cat. Wait a while before you get another fur baby. You‚Äôll need time to heal. Your sweet fur angel will always watch over you ü§ó

awnothecorn,fdsu6ms,t3_en03rv,I'm so sorry. She's beautiful.
g_pelly,fdtya8u,t1_fdsu6ms,Yeah she is.  She used that to her advantage.  She'd do something terrible and I could never be mad at her.  The eyes got me every time.
toadtattoo,fdsx5io,t3_en03rv,I am so sorry you had to say goodbye to her today:( i am positive she knew she was loved and felt the same way about you. she looks like an absolute doll and complete sweetheart.

But as she got older, she was a total cuddlebug and absolute sweetheart."
Sleepingseason,fdsusfe,t3_en03rv,"I'm so sorry for your loss, I lost a pet recently and it is really tough. The house always feels so much more empty, and you realise just how much space these small furry creatures can take up. Just know that she is still occupying that space and is with you always. What an adorable cat, I'm glad you both got to experience a wonderful friendship with one another"

She is the most beautiful and most loving cat I‚Äôve ever had. She is sleeping and purring under the covers, staying warm against my belly as I type this. I hate to be someone who compares stories, but I just want to say I feel for you because I can‚Äôt imagine what kind of mess I‚Äôll be when I lose my little girl. Feel better."

cammanders2,fdtdh1n,t3_en03rv,Im sorry to see this. Im glad that you had 15 good years with her though and that those years must have been great for her as well.
g_pelly,fdtzevo,t1_fdtdh1n,"My wife says she wishes she could be reincarnated as one of my cats, lol  


She was a former stray, so to go from that, to a loving owner made her a lucky girl indeed."

hexular,fdttp20,t3_en03rv,"My heart goes out to you. I know what it's like to lose a dear companion, it's heartbreaking. What got me through the toughest times was remembering the happiness, love and full life my cat has lived until her last day, and thinking back on all the beautiful memories I have with her. 

I'm certain Minnie will forever live on in your memories, and your heart."
g_pelly,fdu0if0,t1_fdttp20,100%  I will never forget her and treasure our time together always.

foxkittie,fduhjnm,t3_en03rv,"You got me. I'm unusually good at avoiding deceased cat posts. Not only did I read this one, I also watched the video and smiled. I send you tight hugs. Losing your cat is like a piece of you disappearing. When my 17.5 year old cat died, I felt so alone. He was my companion. We were in love. You have my congratulations and deepest sympathy. It does get better."
g_pelly,fdwo88y,t1_fduhjnm,"Yeah, it's hard right now.  


For me the hardest part is being in the house and realizing my routine is never going to be the same again.  


In time, new routines will form and it'll get easier.  But thank you for the kind words."
OneMorePenguin,fduod8m,t3_en03rv,"MInnie will live forever in your heart and in your memories.  Knowing that we can take their pain away does not make it easy to do.  Being there with her in her final moments shows how much you truly loved her.  My condolences on the loss of Minnie.  Thank you for sharing.  I've ben watching this video over and over, mesmerized by her adeptness at tracking and catching the toy and her beautiful coat that looks oh so soft.  You were fortunate to have found each other."
g_pelly,fdwohae,t1_fduod8m,"Thank you so much!  It really is the most difficult job of any loving pet owner.  


But yeah, I've watched that video over and over too.  It really captures her playful side to a tee.  And yeah, she was a pretty girl for sure.   


Your words truly mean a lot to me, friend."
himcowandchicken,fdur94i,t3_en03rv,So sorry for your loss. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve given her the best 9 lives. My cat is old too (14 yrs old) and it breaks my heart to think of the day where he‚Äôll one day leave me.
g_pelly,fdwoyw2,t1_fdur94i,"Take it from me, lots of photos and videos to remember him by really help.  


I lost another cat years ago, suddenly and I have very little to remember him by.  This time, we have an entire album of pictures.  In her last month, lots of friends got to come by and see her and say goodbye, seeing how many she touched, really meant the world to me."
desivaperUSA,fduv3ju,t3_en03rv,15 years was a great run. i'm sorry for the loss. hang in there.
g_pelly,fdwp6hj,t1_fduv3ju,"Thank you!

The cat in question was born in Denmark I believe, so I wouldn't doubt it :)"

I, coincidentally. Rescued one of her kittens. Who is still with me. Was a lovely moment to get the certificate and see it confirmed. I had no idea, it was just a puss that needed it a home."

murphlicious,fdnjixg,t3_em3r4n,I live alone so I just never close the door. Yogi is my bathroom buddy who figured out I‚Äôm a captive audience that he can get pets from.
Stecknight,fdmxegs,t3_em3r4n,"So clever, how did you teach him opening doors?"
not_sosecretgarden,fdobfwi,t1_fdmxegs,"He taught himself. We have the same handle to our front door leading outside and have to keep it locked at all times, or else he lets himself out!"
catlady306,fdmzruo,t3_em3r4n,we just stopped closing doors in the house because ours thinks closed door = humans keeping fun away from me
hts4life,fdn2obo,t3_em3r4n,good show
tinadollny,fdnbzis,t3_em3r4n,"My cat does the same thing when im in the bathroom. 

Its a sign they love you lots <3"
BeccSi11,fdncskz,t3_em3r4n,Hilarious! My cat sat in the sink and watched me while I had a bath the other day ü§£üòª
opalfield,fdnxsil,t3_em3r4n,"Hide your kids

Hide your wife"
KuaLeifArne,fdoddix,t3_em3r4n,My bf's ex's cat used to do that. They had set the handle to point upwards to get him to stop
Basslakegirl,fdoz0vh,t3_em3r4n,Door is closed? BUT I LOVE YOU.

Drackenstein,fdom9k8,t3_emfwb6,This is hilarious. I actually lol‚Äôd when he jumped in your lap!
TonytheCatGuy,fdoomr6,t1_fdom9k8,haha well I'm glad someone enjoyed it :D
cytowrecknologist,fdong11,t3_emfwb6,"It's 2020, no more kinkshaming the cats"
TonytheCatGuy,fdool93,t1_fdong11,"lol you are right, he doesn't bat an eye when I bust out my Judi Dench kawaii body pillow so I owe him that much."
cytowrecknologist,fdoop6r,t1_fdool93,"But if he's a true cat, he most certainly watches and judges."
whystherumgong,fdpbdeu,t3_emfwb6,Do you have a YouTube channel? Because I could watch you two all day honestly

ThankfulImposter,fdpecgb,t3_emfwb6,"I'll never forget taking my cat to the vet and they put the thermometer in her butt. She didnt meow or struggle, she just turned around and gave the doctor a ""What the actual fuck?"" look."
Emukitty6767,fdofwyj,t3_emfwb6,Amazing. You're joking about the bum thing right???
TonytheCatGuy,fdooado,t1_fdofwyj,"lol kinda, he doesn't seem to mind, I mean the first time she stuck in it he raised an eyebrow and put his paw on her hand so I just assumed."

LoneStar2911,fdpes0t,t3_emfwb6,"Your facial expressions are extremely entertaining.

You should look into acting or doing stand-up, maybe. :D"
princess_of_thorns,fdohyri,t3_emfwb6,Please don‚Äôt drive with the cat loose in the car it isn‚Äôt safe!
TonytheCatGuy,fdokc6t,t1_fdohyri,"Yeah I know it was fool hardy of me, in fact as soon as I returned home and parked the car in the driveway he jumped up on the dash and stood in front of the steering wheel :S I got lucky but never again!"
noxinboxes,fdonokp,t1_fdohyri,"I have a large plastic carrier that will totally become airborne and kill me if I got into a car accident. Plus, it has to be in the passenger seat facing me or the beast will display his displeasure  from both ends. On the upside, he‚Äôd surely survive and carry in my family name!"
StrayaMate2000,fdozd3b,t1_fdokc6t,"There's a cat in Japan (lambo cat) who just chills on his owners dash and travels with them.

TonytheCatGuy,fdooq47,t1_fdonokp,"damn right those carriers are little tanks, built like an early 90's Volvo!"
Random_Weirdo_Girl,fdpzz9x,t1_fdonokp,Strap the seatbelt around the carrier and buckle it in. That's what I do.
spooktember,fdpcnta,t3_emfwb6,I love Nero to absolute bits
TonytheCatGuy,fdrdzs1,t1_fdpcnta,"Thank you so much! Tjere's a bunch more of him if you're interested :)

Snarkybibliophile,fdp8mg3,t3_emfwb6,Such a perfect name for him.
rmrgdr,fdpbyh4,t3_emfwb6,"Jeesh man, for Nero's safety get a carrier!"
satuuration3,fdpaidn,t3_emfwb6,"When cats stick their tongue out like that, does that mean they‚Äôre just nervous from the car ride? When I was taking my cat back to Texas after visiting with me in Tennessee for a while he did that and I‚Äôd never seen him do that before. Freaked me out lol."
GoldMegaPhotographer,fdppwkq,t1_fdpaidn,salivating and feeling sick i think.
XXTwnz,fdpqnq0,t1_fdpaidn,From my experience they do it for the same reason dogs do -- to cool off.  I've found that I have to run my car's temp at 60F to keep my cat from panting.
Ice_tail,fdqn1j5,t1_fdpqnq0,"No it means they're stressed as fuck, dont spread misinformation."
cindyscrazy,fdqpsvv,t1_fdqn1j5,"It's both. I had a cat who insisted on being outside while my sister was sunbathing. He was young, just really learning how to cat. 

He ended up panting because he was very warm.  I eventually took him inside to cool him down. He never panted after that. 

So, yes, it can be if they get warm."
mooncake968,fdpesvi,t3_emfwb6,I love your videos so much! My cats always pant in the car
XXTwnz,fdpqona,t1_fdpesvi,Its because they are hot.  Cars are warm and they have a big fur coat on.
Alfhiildr,fdpiofn,t3_emfwb6,I think we need regular posts about this kitty! I‚Äôm in love!
boomba1330,fdpn30l,t3_emfwb6,This dude is my new favourite
Spuntmire,fdpsk8p,t3_emfwb6,"God, my boy's name was Nero... üò≠"
guyette_fox,fdptf40,t3_emfwb6,"This is the best update I‚Äôve seen in a while, way to take the claws!"
mrcrumpetman,fdpthdg,t3_emfwb6,My cat used to pant and meow. Maybe try putting him in a carrier with a blanket over it so he cant see out. I found if i catch him off guard and he doesnt see where hes going hes totally chill the entire ride. Until the thermometer goes into his butt of course.

CatSaddleback,fe249g3,t3_enmhpx,Barry is beautiful!
cheyroseb,fe27imn,t3_enmhpx,We stan Barry.
needlefish,fe2s0mw,t3_enmhpx,My cat Barry was also a shy cat! He's made a habit of sitting on me on the couch right when I want to go get water or something. I hope you and your Barry have many fun years together :)
SirenEveline,fe3xv62,t1_fe2s0mw,Aren‚Äôt Barrys the best?! I think cats can sense that you want to leave so they make sure you‚Äôll stay.
Shellie7297,fe2ye59,t3_enmhpx,Kitties and doggos aren‚Äôt shy when they find Their Person. ‚ù§Ô∏è
SkullCollectorD5,fe302ke,t3_enmhpx,"I have one of those supposedly shy types, too! Her first order of business on adoption was to find the litter box, then she explored her home and spent the evening on my lap.

Here's to the introvert cats like fluffy Barry and Skadi."
SirenEveline,fe3sp6s,t1_fe302ke,"Skadi sounds amazing! Barry is a bit slower with the exploring, he is also 9 years so maybe a bit more careful, but he‚Äôs definitely a lap cat. 

Hope you and Skadi have a lot of fun together and an endless amount of hugs."
SkullCollectorD5,fe4k81z,t1_fe3sp6s,"Barry seems to enjoy hugs more than her, though! He's had a couple more years to find his chill, too. Skadi was 7 when I got her and over the last couple of months she has opened up to be a right kitten. Age is just a number to these cats.

Best of fun to you two, too."
LittlestDebbie,fe2xbxl,t3_enmhpx,Thank you for adopting that beautiful baby boy!ü•∞
Willie-Tanner,fe48bn8,t3_enmhpx,Sorry to break the news but it will eventually hit you that Barry adopted you. That‚Äôs how things go in cat world. Enjoy
SirenEveline,fe4kztc,t1_fe48bn8,Hahaha that‚Äôs definitely true for us. We did feel like Barry chose us. He crawled on our lap after en few pets when first meeting him in the shelter. Love at first sight for the both of us.
shortstuff03,fe2u884,t3_enmhpx,"Ah yes, a chonky polydactyl cat. I am jealous. Love the name"
