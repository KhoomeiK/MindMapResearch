dmglakewood,fdxo9uh,t1_fdw4s3f,I made one of those cool circle airplanes with my kids once... Turns out they enjoy destroying things more than creating them.

XxKittenMittonsXx,fdxpmef,t1_fdwdbqt,Fun fact you can’t fold a child more than 12 times
dt78237,fdwzn77,t1_fdwdbqt,No wonder why i couldn't get mine to work

rabidmonkeys,fdwdevk,t3_en81xf,My son and I have tried to make this multiple times. Goes down like the Hindenburg every time.
jchasse,fdwizfc,t1_fdwdevk,"The trick is in “throwing” it.  
Hard to tell from the short vid.

Pointer finger sits on top of the paper crease in the middle bottom of the circle with thumb and middle finger below the paper on earthier side.  (Take those thee fingers and point them in front of you.  That triangle shape is what you are going for)
You don’t grasp the paper (like a traditional paper airplane) so much as let it rest between the fingers like a launching rail.
 
Now HERE’S THE TRICK...

DON’T toss/throw this like you think of a normal paper airplane!  
This is all about a gentle push/release.

GENTLE PUSH & RELEASE.

Let the air currents do all the work NOT the snap of your arm or wrist.

Once you have that down you can start to throw it by facing it vertical up in the air and adding a bit more of a wrist snap before releasing it horizontally, but again this is not about power more about grace.  

Do this from the nose bleed seats in a stadium and you can reach all the way to the courts.

As far as the flappy wings never tried that before, curious if they add lift in some manner."
Iforgot_my_other_pw,fdwynrg,t1_fdwdevk,Try not lighting it on fire maybe
MustSeeReason,fdxkchs,t1_fdwdevk,Was gonna say the same thing. I’ll give gold to the first person in this thread that actually can do this themselves. Video looks cool but I doubt just anyone can make it and throw it right.
caldera,fdwf5ts,t1_fdwdevk,yeah - i was thinking this has to highly depend on quite a few variables
LeprosyDick,fdwyvcu,t1_fdwdevk,"I just tried and it flew perfectly! Well, perfectly for .00001 seconds and then it crashed."
taken_velociraptor,fdwuo2d,t1_fdwdevk,*goes down faster than the **Berlin Wall**
Platinumdogshit,fe0al3j,t1_fdwdevk,Usually I fold these along the flat edge instead of the corner so I end up with just a cylinder. It looks less cool but you throw it gently like a football and it still flies awesomely.
Drunkernaught,fdwkfey,t1_fdwizfc,Does it require a downslope like a staircase then too? Or could you gently push and release down a hall way effectively?
_A-R_,fdywwyp,t1_fdwizfc,"Man all the way through that I thought, ‘this will end with - and then shove it up your butt’."
kabukistar,fdzlvte,t1_fdwizfc,"I jumped to the end of your comment before reading the whole thing, just to make sure it wouldn't end with something about a wrestling match."
Sasha2k1,fdxwmpl,t1_fdwizfc,Scientific method says flappy wings make it worse. Though I *did* mount them with a paper clip but I don’t think it contributed to the flight in any meaningful way
GuiSim,fdxrwye,t1_fdwynrg,Oh the humanity.
MileysMooseKnuckle,fdy6iu0,t1_fdxkchs,"Just made one that works using printer paper and duct tape, was honestly surprised.

Not as good as the clip and not easy to throw right but it glides."
BucketDucker182,fdxl2eb,t1_fdxkchs,"Someone accept this challenge! I would, but i have the origami skills of a child with congenital hand deformities."
KilicS,fdxg268,t1_fdwf5ts,"They fly pretty well most of the time. This one is folded diagonally, but folding it horizontally also works well. You might want to snip some of the paper in the back though."
jchasse,fdwl0d3,t1_fdwkfey,"Anywhere, although the larger the room vs drop the longer the glide.
Do it in my living room or office when I’m bored.

Outside can be dicey with stronger breezes.
Those mild currents you get from inside air are t’bomb"
FictionVent,fdya3b9,t1_fdwkfey,If you make it without the “wings” and make the tail flat rather than pointed (basically a regular old paper cylinder) you can throw it like a football.  We used to make these in school all the time.
jchasse,fe27cs1,t1_fdzlvte,I am truly honored (serious)
RepulsiveGuard,fdy1ps5,t1_fdxwmpl,I mean the wings might still be worse but I'd imagine using a paperclip adds way more weight than a tiny piece of tape

thinksoftchildren,fdxp5am,t1_fdwl0d3,"Cool, I wanna try this.. do you have an app that notifies me when you're bored, and whether or not you're home or at the office?"
Sasha2k1,fdy39s2,t1_fdy1ps5,"*One scientific method later*

Yeah it was the paper clip, winged version gives about 20-25% more distance"

derete,fdy7410,t1_fdy6vjw,Oh that worked. Thanks!
Davachman,fdxvkwc,t1_fdxu1bv,It didn't work at all. A super basic paper airplane made by someone with tremors would fly better.
NickKappy,fdyf29f,t1_fdy9yte,Now this is pod racing

jaldala,fdravyt,t1_fdnos8e,It is highly toxic in a sense. It is addictive and erodes your metabolism which is not very good at metabolizing it. Your body is supposed to consume fruit sugars. Consuming little amounts of it is okay but in large amounts is a big no. So gloves are on point.

willynillee,fdo7380,t1_fdnrvki,A simple rinse with warm water would get rid of sugary fingers.  It dissolves easily.  No scrubbing needed
The_Night_Of_Pan,fdp4x20,t1_fdnrvki,I’m going to assume that he’s making an effort to keep the cubes clean for later (more practical) use. I’m sure the other members of his household would prefer not to drop germ-covered sugar in their tea.
Megatronic5678,fdp4hkr,t1_fdnrvki,Just lick your fingers
DuvetCapeMan,fdobdh9,t1_fdnrvki,is that the best you can do? in that case you should wear gloves 24/7 because I can guarantee your touching worse stuff than sugar on a daily basis. it literally takes more effort to get out and put on and take off plastic gloves than to run your hand under the tap for three seconds

10 calories, zero sugar, <4 net carbs, caffeine equivalent to a 1/3rd of a cup of coffee, acidity roughly equal to coffee, and rest of ingredients have scary names but aren't actually bad for you (unless in excess), e.g., Taurine, L-Tartrate, etc.

But when I would bang a Red Bull in the morning it would geek me up and get me going. If I would take one at night, say while I’m playing video games after a long day it just sharpens the sense a bit. It sort of gives back a little of your edge. You’re still tired because you’ve been awake for 18 hours but the energy drink helps you focus *while you’re focusing*. When you go to sleep you’ll just sleep pretty shittily."

I'm one of those people. I can drink a 300mg caffeine energy drink and go right to bed, I don't know why but I don't feel anything.

 I love energy drinks because they taste delicious.  The variety of fruit/abstract flavors is awesome compared to sodas.  I will drink soda, but I just choose not to because they have a lot of sugar and most taste the same(just really sweet). Bang/some lines of other brands are 0 calories(IM NOT SAYING THEY ARE HEALTHIER THOUGH). Unfortunately, they are more expensive 

Some of my favorites:
Original NOS

Fruit punch and whipped rockstars

Original and orange monsters

Champagne and peach mango bangs

Red and purple venoms

I don't like redbulls"
JDLRosa223,fdoqec5,t1_fdoe1in,"Yeah I’m like that, caffeine barely affects me and i like the taste. Imo the energy drink part being taken out would be amazing, and i wish they’d make one"
Benjirich,fdpp3lo,t1_fdoe1in,Caffeine addiction/dependency is extremely common nowadays.
dasher11,fdpt1bz,t1_fdoe1in,"I do that.  I at least get the Sugarfree Red Bulls, though that's only so much better.

Also, despite caffeine not giving me energy, it still developed into an addiction where I'll get headaches from caffeine withdrawal."

handsomepirates1,fdoi6s5,t1_fdogv12,"Ah copy that, I mean I drink it occasionally (usually with vodka) and don't mind it, but the tart/sharp taste isn't something I would crave enough to want to sip on without a purpose."
Snickfritzzz,fdokjw3,t1_fdoegzr,Definitely a habit. I HAD to have a 5 hour energy every single morning before work. I would be grouchy and so tired without one. Even on days I told myself “nah I won’t get one today I need to stop drinking that shit” next thing you know I’m turning into wawa out of habit to grab one. My stomach would hurt after drinking them and I knew it was tearing my stomach apart but I still drank them for a while until I forced myself to stop buying them. It was kind of like a cigarette habit lol
dt204196,fdphh4z,t1_fdp27l2,Holy fuck
bathroom_break,fdpn0b4,t1_fdpmec4,"That's the point of all the other ingredients and B vitamins, it's still a fantastic energy drink for staying awake. Just won't rot the teeth as bad. 

Also the sugar-high is a myth, been debunked and no more than placebo effect, many studies concluding it may have opposite effects. 

So it's not the sugar in the drinks that you need if the aim is to stay energized."

I still drink Starbucks but not everyday. Around 2 or more lt of water every day makes the difference."
Baardhooft,fdnr2dd,t1_fdnf7x1,"At least make the switch to Coke Zero if you don't want to give up on it completely. Taste wise it hardly differs for me and I prefer Zero, Diet tastes different for some reason, not good. 

I always made it a habit to look on the back of every item I'm purchasing. Before I started doing that I would just chuck it into my basket because I thought it couldn't be so bad, but reading the  calorie list made it easier for me to not pick up something sweet or filled with sugar."
HourLongBlunt,fdng99x,t1_fdnf7x1,Try seltzer! It’s how I stopped drinking sodas
Bakingxpancake,fdnjvwg,t1_fdnf7x1,"I had a problem like that too, I stopped once I decided I didn't like spending $2 a day putting a bunch of sugar into my body. I literally forced myself self turning down soda in meals and whenever going to the store and drank water instead since it's free!! Who doesn't like saving money?? Though, when having dinner I'll have a soda every now and then. I think it's ok as long it's in moderation. 

Though for Starbucks, I actually work at one. At first, it was hard not leaving with a sugary ass drink when getting out of work but I started to notice it was too much. At most I'll just get flat white (no syrup added just milk and espresso) and water. But when I do feel like having something sweet then I'll go all out since most of our drinks taste terrible with half the sweetness. I've gotten to the point where regular sweetness is too sweet for me so I have to put less of a pump.

Good luck with cutting soft drinks! It is possible if you can't completely cut it then try lower the amount you drink so if you drink daily maybe cut it to every other day then to 3x a week to maybe once a week."
cangath,fdnmss4,t1_fdnf7x1,"The best thing that helped me cut out sugar was learning about it. I recommend Stuff You Should Know Podcast on : Soda, Junk good, and diabetes. When you understand your favorite treat was designed to be that way it just isn’t appetizing."

Ragingwhirlpool,fdoxzcm,t1_fdnf7x1,"I stopped drinking soda and sugary coffee like 6-7 months ago. I quelled the urge with sparkling water and black espresso. For soda it was less about the sweetness and more about the carbonation.

Since then I feel significantly healthier. I sort of became aware of how bad sugar really is for you, and the rate at which people consume it is actually pretty gross. Just go to the grocery store and look at the labels for stuff you think is healthy (fruit juices are the worst example, they pass them off as healthy, a lot of them are worse than soda). 

You can do it though, and you’ll feel good about it after a few days."

I'm at an age where a lot of people are overweight or even obese (in America). I was a little overweight until I was about 19 or 20, but I just stopped eating until I was very full every time I eat.

BohPoe,fdny58m,t3_emb0sd,"Cutting out or severely limiting intake of processed sugar (especially in soft drinks witch have A LOT of it) and high fructose corn syrup is one of the easiest ways to avoid getting  obese. Drinking 4-5 cokes a day (or even 2-3) not realizing how much sugar and HFCS you're consuming will get you real fat real quick.

They should be a treat, not a daily consumption. Start by trying to only have a soda or two on weekends. If you want flavored drinks during the week just try flavored water, or things that are only sweetened with Stevia or erythritol, since these do not effect your blood sugar levels the way other artificial sweeteners like aspartame and sucralose do.

You can buy Stevia packets at the grocery store or online."
Ravrutu,fdngh22,t3_emb0sd,"Some of the popular soft drinks producers also uses Maltase- An enzyme which produced more sweetness in addition to sugar. So, you shouldn’t consume them on daily basis and reduce the consumption."
EmilyU1F984,fdo0bzg,t1_fdngh22,"Do you have a source for this? 

Maltase is a type of enzyme that catalysis the hydrolysis of maltose into glucose.

It doesn't have anything to do directly with sweetness.



Maltose is a malty tasting sugar that's perfectly harmless and naturally present in all kinds of foods and drinks.

Maltase is an enzyme that our body releases into the mucus of our digestive system.


When our body digests starch, it breaks the starch first down into maltose, and then further into glucose.




Even if drinks contained maltase, it wouldn't make them toxic or really change anything.




Maybe you were thinking of the sugar alcohol maltitol? That's the sugar alcohol of maltose, which is about 3/4 as sweet as Saccharose (regular sugar) but has only about half as many calories by weight.

Due to extreme differences in our gut microbiome some people are somewhat intolerant or all kinds of sugar alcohols, because their bacteria digest the sugar alcohol into bloating gasses or diarrhea.

For anyone else, sugar alcohols like maltitol, sorbitol or xylitol are perfectly fine to eat in any amount you'd reasonably consume.

(Dogs are a different story because their bodies mistake Xylitol for glucose, making their pancreas believe their blood glucose is far too high releasing as much insulin as possible. Thus the treatment for dogs who are sugar free gum etc is an infusion of glucose and monitoring).




Soft drinks aren't very different to the same sugar content juices really. Sure you get a few vitamins from the juice, but apart from that it's still nearly empty calories.

The difference happens when you don't pre extract all the sugar and eat the actual fruit. That way the glucose will only slowly enter your blood stream, reducing the impact in causing insulin tolerance and type 2 diabetes)."

* Total Sugars 77g
* Incl 77g Added Sugars 154%

So does each one of these actually have 154 grams of sugar?"

its 77 grams of sugar, all added, none naturally occurring"
phantacc,fdqj2qz,t1_fdp1ix5,Thank you! You wouldn't happen to know what the difference is between the 28% and the 154% would you? 28% of carb daily allowance and 154% of sugar daily allowance?
PM_ME_Y0UR_ARMPITS,fdqzx23,t1_fdqj2qz,"those are RDA values (recommended daily allowance). they are guidelines for how much of anything you should be having in a day. in this case, they are guidelines for how many of what types of carbs you should have

its saying that 77g of carbs is only 28% of the total carbs you should/could have in a day. however, 77g of sugar is 154% of the sugar you should be having in a day.

so in terms of carbs you have room for more (28% out of 100%). in terms of sugar you've already had too much (154% out of 100%). this means you can eat more carbs but they better not be from sugar because you've already exceeded your daily allowance of sugar by a lot"

There’s also Arizona tea, they make some awesome diet drinks too:

Diet Arizona Peach Tea (awesome and tastes great)

Diet Arizona Green Tea (my favorite)

I believe they also have a diet half and half (lemon and tea.) Delicious.

Seriously try it. It is really worth cutting back on the sugary sodas for health. Over time you don’t even notice the taste difference, a lot of people’s tastebuds are just overly-blasted with sugar. I had a lot of anxiety and heart palpitations and majorly cutting my soda intake helped buttloads.

That's well more than 3% of the population even considering what is likely a much higher number.

mercival,fdgx3wt,t3_elbpv3,"Some weird jumping of countries at times (e.g. NZ in 1943 from 9.4% to off the graph, then back to 9.4%)

I'm assuming it's due to lack of data for some years? I wonder how it'd look with estimations/smoothing if this was the case."
NumberStory,fdgya12,t1_fdgx3wt,"I just checked the original data source. The data is missing in 1943 for New Zealand. If interpolation is used in this case, the ranking will be distorted."
j-dewitt,fdhcofl,t3_elbpv3,"Very interesting, thanks for doing this!

Note that number of personnel does not really correlate to military ""strength"" overall. There are way to many other factors such as training, equipment, natural resources, budget, experience, technology, etc. But this wasn't intended to measure ""strength"", and is quite interesting."

Robbie122,fdhsd9k,t3_elbpv3,"interesting to see the russia just fall off midway through ww1 then skyrocket during the bolshevik revolution then dip back down by several million.  Then post ww2 see the tensions between USSR v China, USA v China/Nkorea, and USSR v USA."

snoosh00,fdhotr3,t1_fdhdl6l,"Odds are it's got something to do with the tensions they have with Pakistan about Kashmir, fishing rights and border disputes.

I could be wrong, anyone can fact check that if they feel like it."
drassaultrifle,fdjnzbm,t1_fdhdl6l,Pakistan and China are acting like assholes again. That’s what
chacha-choudhri,fdjs0wr,t1_fdhdl6l,"China mostly, just like almost every other country which shares border with them. India, Japan, Bhutan, Vietnam, Philippines are all wary of chinese threats, land grabs and threats.

China has also illegal transfered lots of military equipment including nuclear bombs and missiles to Pakistan and facilitated nuclear know how exchange between North Korea and Pakistan. So India has more than one reason of being wary of China."
millerstreet,fdjb68y,t1_fdhotr3,"Indian Army is trying to fill its ranks due to increasing threat from Pakistan and China. Surprisingly, Indian Army is short of 50,000 soldiers and 8,000 officers."
Spetzfoos,fdgzpnp,t3_elbpv3,Would think that Russia would change to the Soviet Union since it's states such as East Germany or Ukraine weren't represented seperately.
SmokeyUnicycle,fdhghc4,t1_fdgzpnp,GDR was not part of the USSR
Spetzfoos,fdi0pr3,t1_fdhghc4,Oh ok thanks for letting me know.
SmokeyUnicycle,fdi1o64,t1_fdi0pr3,"It was very much under Soviet influence but it was not integrated directly into the country.

 If they had tried to do things that the Soviet Union didn't approve of there would be Soviet tanks rolling through and the offending politicians removed.

See the Prague Spring for a relevant example of what that looks like."
Spetzfoos,fdi1vfu,t1_fdi1o64,So it's under pretty much but not in name. I would expect their military to be sizable enough to be on this list though? Or was it just proxy Soviet troops or I just missed it's inclusion.
SmokeyUnicycle,fdi2fn4,t1_fdi1vfu,"The USSR did at least try renegotiating first and the reforms were pretty wide sweeping  to the point where the Soviets were afraid that the the country would turn towards the Western Powers become a threat.

 Just the fact that they started doing these reforms does show that they had a fair amount of autonomy in their day-to-day affairs up until the point where the USSR considered it as  endangering their security.

So not quite a puppet state but close to it."
Spetzfoos,fdi3fk8,t1_fdi2fn4,"Interesting really, never knew they were that independent. Thanks for all the info!"

clothes_fall_off,fdh8eey,t3_elbpv3,What was the deal with Paraguay?
thejoeblack,fdhtvf9,t1_fdh8eey,"Despite being de facto independent since 1811 and having proclaimed a Republic in 1813, Paraguay formally declared independence only on November 25, 1842 and in 1844 adopted a new Constitution that replaced the Constitution of 1813.[16] Based on this, Paraguay started to gain official international recognition.

Foreign relations began to increase in importance under López, who retained Paraguay's traditional mistrust of the surrounding states, yet lacked Francia's diplomatic skills. Initially, López feared an attack by the Buenos Aires dictator Rosas. With Brazilian encouragement, López dropped Francia's policy of neutrality and began meddling in Argentine politics. Using the slogan ""Independence or Death"", **López declared war against Rosas in 1845** to support what was ultimately an unsuccessful rebellion in the Argentine province of Corrientes. Although Britain and France prevented him from moving against Paraguay, Rosas established a trade embargo on Paraguayan goods.

Edit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Paraguay"
de_Modulator,fdh9c5h,t3_elbpv3,"Some ""small"" details as constructive criticism:
Republic of Turkey was announced and recognized in 29th October 1923. Anything before that would have been the Ottoman empire. Although mostly seen as its ""successor"" these two entities were vastly different and sworn enemies during the war of independence. Just like how you distinguish Bavaria from Germany, or Austria-Hungary from Austria or Hungary, the difference between Ottomans and Rep. of Turkey are huge. For some, 1923 is the end of 623 years of  sadistic monarchy and slavery."

NumberStory,fe7q8bx,t3_eo3a9v,"Submission statement:

Uranium  is a chemical element with the symbol U and atomic number 92. The major  application of uranium in the military sector is in high-density  penetrators. During the later stages of World War II, the entire Cold  War, and to a lesser extent afterwards, uranium-235 has been used as the  fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. The main use of  uranium in the civilian sector is to fuel nuclear power plants.

This  video shows the top 10 largest uranium producing countries from 1963 to  2018 based on uranium production (metric tons). After a decade of  falling mine production to 1993, output of uranium has generally risen  since then and now meets almost all the demand for power generation. Now  Kazakhstan produces the largest share of uranium from mines (41% of  world supply from mines in 2018), followed by Canada (13%) and Australia  (12%)."
Kenitzka,fe83m5n,t1_fe7q8bx,"What is the end product this video aggregates? Is it refined uranium 235? Or is it just unrefined uranium ore?

Nuclear energy uses 20% refined U235/U238 whereas weapons grade is anywhere north of 85%. But the isotope U235 is only about 0.72% naturally occurring in mined uranium (largely U238) ore so tons of ore is required to mined and refined to achieve any substantial amount of fissile material."
RichyG7,fe9iu4k,t1_fe7q8bx,Kazakhstan is number one exporter of potassium
Trusterr,fe7z7ck,t1_fe7q8bx,Czechoslovaks were taken by Soviets and most all uranium mined was “stolen”by them so should be included in USSR numbers
