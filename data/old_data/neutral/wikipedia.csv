Example -- there's an gap in the fossil record between two species, 10 million years apart.

Fundamentalist: Ah ha! See? Your science can't explain that! Therefore, god exists. No other explanation makes sense.

Scientist: Oh hey, we discovered a transition fossil that perfectly bisects the timeline, it is from 5 million years between the two and looks like it fits perfectly. This is a good find but more work is needed.

Fundamentalist: Now there are \*TWO GAPS\*. Twice the ambiguity. Only god can explain this.

js_aust,fdnrdub,t1_fdmgpk6,"The utility of a morality in terms of what? Survival? You would still be positing survival as the key value here, which of course his a moral prejudice..."
Tuberoinfundibular,fdnryev,t1_fdnrdub,"Sure, survival. Survival isn't really a value though - it's something that life does regardless of values. My general point is that morality can be scientifically explained, from why it occurs to the brain mechanisms associated with moral behavior."
Tuberoinfundibular,fdnys7x,t1_fdnulla,"You should really try to read the link I sent. What you and Nagel are referring to is known as the ""binding problem"" in neuroscience, which is the question of how exactly qualia (subjective experiences) form from brain activity. Nagel wrote the paper you referencing decades ago, and in that time we have come closer to understanding how consciousness is generated by the brain."
js_aust,fdntb75,t1_fdnryev,"The inclination to choose survival as key to your utilitarian theory is based on a value judgment. 
My point is that all moralities are based on value judgments. 

Also, you cannot link a specific segment of the brain to an action that is moral."
Tuberoinfundibular,fdnvbh4,t1_fdntb75,"It's not a value judgement - natural selection is based off of how well an organism can survive. As such, organisms that have adaptations that help them survive are able to pass on their genes to future offspring. Morality can be explained as an adaptation that occurred in social primates that has been passed down to humans.

Also, read this if you really think brain activity can't be linked to moral behavior: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770908/#__sec9title"
Tuberoinfundibular,fdo3uvm,t1_fdnzzj3,"Nagel's thesis, while influential (I read about it in high school philosophy class), is not without it's critics. For instance, neuroscientist Daniel Dennett denies Nagel's claim that the bat's consciousness is inaccessible, contending that any ""interesting or theoretically important"" features of a bat's consciousness would be amenable to third-person observation. For instance, it is clear that bats cannot detect objects more than a few meters away because echolocation has a limited range. He holds that any similar aspects of its experiences could be gleaned by further scientific experiments. In other words, you don't really need to be a bat in order to determine what it is like to be a bat.

Philosopher Peter Hacker goes [further](http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/scr/hacker/docs/ConsciousnessAChallenge.pdf), arguing that Nagel's thesis is philosophically misconceived and has needlessly contributed to much confusion regarding the study of consciousness."
js_aust,fdnvwyj,t1_fdnvbh4,Natural selection isn’t a moral. There are in fact moralities that go directly against natural selection.
js_aust,fdpgq8a,t1_fdo3uvm,"Again, there is no way to understand subjectivity, in its entirety, objectively. It goes against the very essence of the scientific method.

 ""interesting or theoretically important"" - This still does not capture subjectivity. It looks at certain features, but not the whole of its experience."
freebelion,fdkr2bc,t3_elsnj6,"It seems okay to attribute unexplained stuff to some unknown entity. The problem arises when that unknown entity is accepted as the final explanation so any further search for answers becomes unnecessary.

Reagalan,fdlsaxz,t1_fdkitm8,"Theoretically, all it takes to disprove a preposition  is to prove it's negation. Assume God exists. If God exists, then x. By modus tollens; if not x, therefore, not God. Just need a suitable x to disprove (which rules out like all the historical mythological gods)."

M_Bus,fdkiztm,t3_elsnj6,"I mean, by Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, you can basically prove (alert: hand-wavey explanation incoming) that no matter how much logic you throw at the universe, there will either be things that we have ""proven"" true that are false (or vice versa) or things that are true or false that we can't say anything about.

That is to say, logic by necessity creates gaps that can only be filled with additional axioms, i.e., beliefs.

In science (or math) those axioms are typically based on what we think represent rational conclusions based on our own observations of the known universe, but I think probably philosophically speaking there is room to argue about what constitutes a ""rational conclusion based on our observations of the known universe"" or the extent to which any base truth is ultimately observable.

So to my way of thinking, the ""god of the gaps"" philosophy is basically tautological. It starts with the necessary finiteness of human understanding and concludes that there is necessarily something that is permanently outside of human understanding. That is actually a fact (per Godel) - there are things that are permanently outside of human understanding. The only problem is... which things are they?"
voidrex,fe34lnw,t1_fdkiztm,"Gödels Theorems are formulated specifically to apply to formal systems powerful enough  to express plain arithmetics. Based on a set of assumed logical-mathematical axioms there will be true unprovable theorems about logic and mathematics. Notice its a limited domain, it does not hold for all domains."
M_Bus,fdkus3y,t1_fdkothl,"[No offense, but it's kind of scientific fact!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) And, yeah, mathematicians and logicians were not super thrilled when Godel figured that out. It led to a lot of soul searching by scientists and philosophers.

Now, given that there is a logically consistent proof of this concept - that logic can demonstrate the existence of theorems that cannot be evaluated by logic OR that logic cannot be demonstrated to be internally consistent - I'm afraid you're left with two choices:

a) Godel's incompleteness theorem is correct

b) Godel's incompleteness theorem is incorrect. But in this case, since it was proven USING CONSISTENT LOGIC, we know that logic is self-inconsistent.

Doesn't look good, I'm afraid.

I mean, consider also the fact that there are an uncountably many unique true statements, but language is finite and can only express countably many true things in finite time. Consider the fact that math can prove the existence of [""uncomputable numbers""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_number) and, in fact, uncomputable numbers FAR EXCEED computable ones in number! It's not a stretch to believe that logical systems necessarily have limits. That isn't a comment about the knowability of any specific scientific ""fact,"" just about the broad limits of human reasoning. We know it's limited. We just don't know where the limit is.

That said, I agree with you about ""pointlessly believing that god exists."" I guess that's part of what I'm implying. Since all interesting logical systems can be proven to have limitations, you can (perhaps meaninglessly) put god in all of the limitations outside of the system."
commander_nice,fdkxadi,t1_fdkus3y,I'm not disagreeing with Godel's theorem. I'm disagreeing with using it to prove the existence of a god.
M_Bus,fdkza5q,t1_fdkxadi,"Ah! Well I guess I didn't mean to imply that god exists because logic is limited. I guess I thought I said that. I just meant what you stated already about how the notion of a god can be inserted into the necessary gap in logical reasoning without changing logic at all. It's mostly meaningless, but it's interesting at least that there is no way to close every gap."
RichardMau5,fdlv3oz,t1_fdkxadi,"Hey u/commander_nice, I think you are right. Sorry people gave you downvotes.  

Most people really like to throw in Gödel all the time. But realize that Gödels theorem is about a “formal proof system” powerful enough to express Peano Arithmetic (+, -, x, / with an infinite set of natural numbers). It is NOT about our universe. Our universe might be well described with some parts of mathematics, did does not imply that all mathematical proofs have direct consequences in the physical reality.

I’m by no means an expert, but I read a couple of books about Gödels Incompleteness Theorem and study Mathematics."

RogerVanRabbit,fdhbb01,t1_fdh03w3,"Yes I have read several mentions of that as well i several different places. 

To be fair, I can see why massacring a massive number of unarmed starving fanatical peasants calling themselves a Crusade would give you a rather low opinion of the fighting, logistical and political skill of anybody claiming an affiliation with the term. 

Then the properly professional knights, sergeants and men-at-arms show up (and in very large numbers for the era, no less), with quality leaders (even if in-fighting, at least political, was definitely real), backed by Lombard, Genoan & Venetian banking, Sicilian ships (although more so in later crusades for this specific point I'd think) and with (lukewarm but still) Byzantine support.

ancientmelodies,fdqnh4c,t3_emr32l,"The lady suffered a pneumothorax which is air in the plural cavity (the space between the chest wall and lungs). With each breath air will fill the space in her chest around her lungs until her lungs could no longer inflate under the pressure and she would not be able to breathe and then she would die.  Changing altitude could cause the pressure on her lungs to increase as noted in the article. 

The note worthy thing about this is the only thing that can be done to help her is inserting a chest tube or needle decompression which would release the air pushing on her lungs.  This is done through making a small cut in the chest into the plural space and creating a one way valve so air can exit but not enter (thus the tube and probably a makeshift valve). If you put a hole in the chest and don’t put a one way valve on it, air will enter the plural space through the tube (such as with a gunshot wound (open pneumothorax) ).

This doesn’t fix the pneumothorax but will prevent her lungs from collapsing and ensuring she can breathe until the problem is fixed. So the surgery was just that, a tube inserted in the right spot to release that pressure with a one way valve to let air out but not in. The same thing could have been done for a hemothorax which is blood in the plural cavity. 
 

Therefore if they doctors did not do this she would have died."

The other hole lets the air escape into the atmosphere (in this case, pressurized plane cabin).

atoms-and-void,fduuvlf,t1_fdugyoz,"It was Tension pneumothorax. This one is a medical emergency. 

With the increased intra-thoracic pressure, the mediastinum (heart) is pushed to the other side of the chest. At the beginning, it will compensate (tachycardia to compensate for low blood pressure due to the inability of the ventricles to overcome high external pressure).

But then, as the pressure keeps increasing after each breath, the heart will be so compressed that it will become bradycardic (slow) and then stop (go into fibrillation first). 

'Tension' pneumothorax is a type of obstructive shock. Different from 'simple' acute or chronic (like yours) pneumo. TP needs medical intervention asap. Drainage, like they did, or at least needle decompression (rather than a full drain, you just leave a needle, thus transforming 'tension' into 'simple', before it can be managed properly."

And

>The conditions of the will were met in 2010 after the 1989 death of his last grandchild. In May 2011, twelve of Burt's descendants finally received the estate, worth about $100 million.

If it was $40m then, to be as conservative as possible, and only returned 5% annually (rather than the 8-9% it would've invested in the stock market over that time period), that's still $2m a year compounding. The absolute largest annuity was $30k, and most are much much smaller. It couldn't've been more than $100k or so. And they expired eventually with the recipients. Even allowing for the $5m in leases which were forced out and legal expenses, it's hard to see how all that opportunity cost could have been so badly squandered."
SilverLion,fdpkt5m,t1_fdob7bt,"I'm guessing some shady stuff with the investors? There was nobody around to over-see it and make sure it was invested properly, so why not scrape some off the top for yourself?"

Edit: apparently I misremembered this."
gwern,fdqp48l,t1_fdprf2b,"The article doesn't say anything about Canadian assets, and implies that the will was broken to only a minor extent:

> A legal hole was found in 1920 because part of the estate was composed of iron leases in Minnesota, and Minnesota had a law against trusts of such long standing. This portion of the estate, amounting to $5 million, was distributed to Burt's children and grandchildren[5] (a son, three daughters and four granddaughters).[15] In 1961, an additional $720,000 was taken from the trust in settlement of a suit filed by nine heirs and the estates of three other descendants.[15]

The Canada part sounds a little unlikely: Burt designed the will to operate this way. Did he and all his expensive lawyers hired to draft an ironclad trust just somehow overlook the teensy tiny minor detail that it ""wasn't valid in Canada""?

Even if you assume that, there's still a puzzle there. Under any kind of reasonable investment strategy, even at the low end, the estate should have been worth tens of billions, possibly hundreds of billions, by being allowed to compound for a century in possibly the best economic conditions to ever obtain in human history, a period of time that made fortunes like Warren Buffett's; instead, the final disbursement was worth *less* in real terms than the original estate!"
old-guy-with-data,fdqvh6v,t1_fdqp48l,"You’re right, it is awfully peculiar.

During the search the Russians did the following things to obstruct the search

fake light signals, sending an armed boarding party to threaten to board a U.S.-chartered Japanese auxiliary vessel (blocked by U.S. warship interposition), interfering with a helicopter coming off the USS Elliot (Sept. 7), attempted ramming of rigs used by the South Koreans in their quadrant search, hazardous maneuvering of Gavril Sarychev and near-collision with the USS Callaghan (September 15, 18), removing U.S. sonars, setting false pingers in deep international waters, sending Backfire bombers armed with air-to-surface nuclear-armed missiles to threaten U.S. naval units, criss-crossing in front of U.S. combatant vessels (October 26), cutting and attempted cutting of moorings of Japanese auxiliary vessels, particularly Kaiko Maru III, and radar lock-ons by a Soviet Kara-class cruiser, Petropavlovsk, and a Kashin-class destroyer, Odarennyy, targeting U.S. naval ships and the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter USCGC Douglas Munro (WHEC-724), USS Towers, escorting USS Conserver, experienced all of the above interference and was involved in a near-collision with Odarennyy (September 23–27).
