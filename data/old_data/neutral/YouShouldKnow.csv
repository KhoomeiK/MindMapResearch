i_forget_what_i_do,emyez1,top_level,"Koalas are cute and fuzzy, but please be careful when harboring any if you are sheltering some.  Avoid their urine and other bodily waste such as feces and any blood.  Use disinfectant and make sure to clean your hands and cloths thoroughly after interacting with them."
Kuritos,fdsf14r,t3_emyez1,"Reasons you don't want chlamydia:

1. Damages the female reproductive system, good luck having kids if you never treat this.

2. You have to explain that you contracted a **sexually** transmitted disease from a Koala. The percentage of people that know this is possible without having sex with it is less than half. So good luck with your ""I didn't fuck a Koala, here's how I was actually infected..."" speech.

Thankfully this STD can be treated easily, but seriously don't wait if you value your reproduction system."
ukgxBigDog,fdsfg5f,t1_fdsf14r,"Doesn't matter if everyone knows koalas carry it and you can get it like this, no matter what you will always be known for fucking a koala"
AhemExcuseMeSir,fdsvrir,t1_fdsf14r,"There‚Äôs more than one type of chlamydia. Chlamydia trachomatis, the ‚ÄúSTD type,‚Äù isn‚Äôt the [type that koalas have. ](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/australia/koalas-chlamydia-john-oliver.html)

Chlamydia is also site specific. So if you‚Äôre handling a koala, you‚Äôre not just going to automatically get it in your genitals, unless you‚Äôre douching with their urine as some fucked-up homeopathic shit. And I think the type that can be transmitted to humans is just a respiratory thing, so maybe not even then (but you probably shouldn‚Äôt drink or bathe in it to ‚Äúremove toxins‚Äù either)."
Imthejuggernautbitch,fdtkccm,t1_fdsf14r,">	You have to explain that you contracted a **sexually** transmitted disease from a Koala.

G47_51,fdsnhua,t1_fdsf14r,"So.. instead of paying all of that money to be sterilized, I could have just got a koala?"
FacesOfEth,fdu2awy,t1_fdsf14r,"Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change.

In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan.

Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals.

Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system.

Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating.

If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet.

I fucking hate them."

 ""Valdez, will you shut up a minute? All right, people, lift!"" I said in my best US Army voice of authority. We got that bitch of a wall unit up above our shoulders, and were winning the fight against gravity, when Valdez gasped

 ""'Then MacDougal says, ‚Äòbut you fuck one sheep‚Äô-."" 

We lost it. Men scattered as the wall unit came crashing down, and people were rolling on the ground laughing. I tried to bark an order, but I was laughing so hard that a snot bubble came out of my nose, and when people saw that, they fell over laughing again.

PurpleHooloovoo,fdsqieo,t3_emyez1,"Koalas are fucking horrible animals.


They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan.


Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.


Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently...


Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals.
Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here).


When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on.


This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why?
Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape.


Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain:


Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree.
An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.



Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute.
If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.

(Edit - this is a copypasta. My favorite of all time and it wasn't posted in a literal thread about koalas with chlamydia.)"
WikY28,fdt8hpz,t1_fdsqieo,"I don't know why it is that these things bother me---it just makes me picture a seven year old first discovering things about an animal and, having no context about the subject, ranting about how stupid they are. I get it's a joke, but people take it as an actual, educational joke like it's a man yelling at the sea, and that's just wrong. Furthermore, these things have an actual impact on discussions about conservation efforts---If every time Koalas get brought up, someone posts this copypasta, that means it's seriously shaping public opinion about the animal and their supposed lack of importance.

>Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives.

Non-ecologists always talk this way, and the problem is you‚Äôre looking at this backwards.

An entire continent is covered with Eucalyptus trees. They suck the moisture out of the entire surrounding area and use allelopathy to ensure that most of what‚Äôs beneath them is just bare red dust. No animal is making use of them‚Äî‚Äîthey have virtually no herbivore predator. A niche is empty. Then inevitably, natural selection fills that niche by creating an animal which can eat Eucalyptus leaves. Of course, it takes great sacrifice for it to be able to do so‚Äî‚Äîit certainly can‚Äôt expend much energy on costly things. Isn‚Äôt it a good thing that a niche is being filled?

>Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death

This applies to all herbivores, because the wild is not a grocery store‚Äîwhere meat is just sitting next to celery.

Herbivores gradually wear their teeth down‚Äîcarnivores fracture their teeth, and break their bones in attempting to take down prey.

>They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal

It's pretty typical of herbivores, and is higher than many, many species. According to Ashwell (2008), their encephalisation quotient is 0.5288 +/- 0.051. Higher than comparable marsupials like the wombat (~0.52), some possums (~0.468), cuscus (~0.462) and even some wallabies are <0.5. According to wiki, rabbits are also around 0.4, and they're placental mammals.

>additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons.

Again, this is not unique to koalas. Brain folds (gyri) are not present in rodents, which we consider to be incredibly intelligent for their size.

>If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food.

If you present a human with a random piece of meat, they will not recognise it as food (hopefully). Fresh leaves might be important for koala digestion, especially since their gut flora is clearly important for the digestion of Eucalyptus. It might make sense not to screw with that gut flora by eating decaying leaves.

>Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.

That's an extremely weird reason to dislike an animal. But whilst we're talking about their digestion, let's discuss their poop. It's delightful. It smells like a Eucalyptus drop!

>Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here).

Marsupial milk is incredibly complex and much more interesting than any placentals. This is because they raise their offspring essentially from an embryo, and the milk needs to adapt to the changing needs of a growing fetus. And yeah, of course the yield is low; at one point they are feeding an animal that is half a gram!

>When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system.

Humans probably do this, we just likely do it during childbirth. You know how women often shit during contractions? There is evidence to suggest that this innoculates a baby with her gut flora. A child born via cesarian has significantly different gut flora for the first six months of life than a child born vaginally.

>Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher.

Chlamydia was introduced to their populations by humans. We introduced a novel disease that they have very little immunity to, and is a major contributor to their possible extinction. Do you hate Native Americans because they were killed by smallpox and influenza?

>This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree,

Almost every animal does this.

>which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Errmmm.. They have protection against falling from a tree, which they spend 99% of their life in? Yeah... That's a stupid adaptation."

The antibiotics might not be the best for the intestinal microflora, and there may not be the funding for full treatment of all the animals, but maybe now we can gather samples for gene banks, or test a chlamydia vaccine (which is currently undergoing human trials) with the young who haven't caught it from their mothers yet.  
Wherever animals are being returned to afterward, if isolated by stretches of burnt land, it could host a population of disease free, non-zoo koala.  This might give us a little more time to better figure out how to cure the remainder of the population, especially after numbers have dropped dramatically in the fires.   It wouldn't be the best, but look how far we're progressing with selective breeding for cheetahs to increase the gene pool... some koalas would be better than none.

TalkingMoose05,fdu1q6r,t3_emyez1,"Koalas are the worst

Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them."

shearB,fdpvnsm,t3_emlplf,"Yes. My husband has a very strong ""resting bitch face"". So much so that even I have asked him on several occasions""why are you looking at me like that?"" It hurt his feelings and we had a good and open conversation about it. 

It's frustrating because while he can interact with other people, it takes the right kind of environment for him to actually relax enough to engage with everyone. I had a friend/co-worker who thought my husband hated her for over a year until they finally got together in a comfortable place outside of work. She said to me after ""wow I've never seen your husband like that, he seemed so much more talkative!"" All I could do was tell her that's what I've been trying to say about him. He doesn't ""hate"" anyone, he's just not very social.

Anyway, yeah. Don't assume the worst in someone just because they don't seem to want to talk to you. If they don't know you, they're probably just worried about what you're thinking of them. Be patient with them. I'm still learning with my husband how to not assume he's upset when there's no good reason for me to assume that, but I make mistakes."
annaaii,fdqbu0f,t1_fdpvnsm,"> it takes the right kind of environment for him to actually relax enough to engage with everyone

This is exactly the same for me. People seem to have a rather narrow idea of what a sociable and 'nice' person should look and behave like and if you don't fit into that idea, they automatically assume you hate them or something. In all fairness though, they probably have little to no experience with socially anxious people or people who have any sort of mental illness. So if everyone around them does fit that idea and talks/behaves in a similar way, they'll naturally come to think of that way as the ""normal"". 

Not saying they shouldn't try to be more open-minded though. They absolutely should."

Always remember to treat your employees the way you want to be treated in every situation. Be humble and remember to give them positive feedback when they deserve it. Sometimes people forget that and only focus on things others do wrong. They may not like you, but they will respect that you know what youre talking about and you treat them like human beings.

Is there anything you find yourself doing a little different to convey that you don't actually want the person to stop talking to you?"
fretka999,fdq3iee,t1_fdq0exc,I'm similar. If the conversation is moving forward and I'm not actively trying to participate there is something wrong. Usually it happens when I get irritated or angry at someone and my mind fills with negative ideas. It overshadows my other thoughts and I use the energy I have left to keep myself from acting out. I enter a rock-like state of mind and just observe the other person.
ErynEbnzr,fdq74hg,t1_fdq3iee,"I don't identify with most of this, but the rock-like state of mind is something I know all too well. When I'm anxious, I just stop. Everything. I can't speak, I can't move, I can't even feel. The only thing I feel is numbness and hate. I forget to breathe and blink and my muscles tense up. Then I just sit there, frozen. No matter how much people try to talk to me, make eye contact, shake me, anything. It's like I've been turned off. 

(PS: for those of you who have a lot of trouble speaking during anxiety attacks and don't know why, you might have r/selectivemutism.

Having social anxiety isn‚Äôt an excuse to be a dick to anyone, but if you tell them nicely and explain how it affects you, the vast majority of people will be understanding. 

Of course, people with mental or physical disabilities or conditions should never have to explain - it‚Äôs not that persons business. They shouldn‚Äôt need an explanation to be NICE. But that‚Äôs a societal and human issue, not a simple social workaround."
DappercatEsq,fdqe2t4,t1_fdq940k,"Hell yeah bud. I conflated my identity with my illness, and it absolutely held me back for a long time. 

It's a very easy thing to do. Getting caught up in a lot of avoidance based coping mechanisms sets some hard borders on someone's life and identity, and I definitely found it simpler to define myself through ""I can't,"" which further limited exploration into ""I can."" When you determine who you are through absence instead of presence, you're kind of the photo negative of a human being. 

Especially young people are susceptible to this, as they are already struggling for an anchor point for their identity. Probably why I got caught up in it for a long time."
SuperMuffin,fdqdak7,t1_fdq940k,"Hey. You act autistic the same way people act neurotypical - its not something to be excused, it's who you are. Processing is a need that we experience more often than NTs, but it's a human phenomenon. They do the same when overwhelmed, it's just that it takes extraordinary circumstances for them to crack, and we encounter those ""extraordinary circumstances"" more often. You're the one that recognises your needs and takes care of them, and that doesn't imply anything bad. 

People who judge people that aren't doing them any harm can fuck right off. The times when being autistic meant you didn't know how to behave should be long gone. If the number of people on the autism spectrum vs. neurotypical spectrum we're reversed and the world catered to an autistic frame of mind, they'd be weird. Not saying it's the way it should be, just painting a thought experiment to say that we feel out of place because of chance, not wrongdoing.

Sorry if this was off topic. My point is, you don't need to be ""excused"" for acting in a way you can't control because people shouldn't judge."

It's like when I'm exhausted after I walked a mile to the train then a mile to work, then stayed on my feet for 8 hours for work, then walked the mile to train then mile to home walk in the opposite direction. Upon getting home I've been away for 11 hours and spent about 90% of the day on my feet and actively moving a lot. I'm physically exhausted. But it's a really good feeling because I got plenty of cardio and my muscles are happy from the work I did. Compared to when I'm feeling lazy and decide to just drive every day - I can feel the effects of the earlier cardio from walkingv just melting away and it's harder to do the 8hr shift, my heart protests, and it's harder to catch my breath.

Exactly the same for me!

I don't really talk unless I have something to say. If there's something that happened and I want to share it, I'll share it with my parents or my close friends, but that's about it. I've noticed that most people at work enjoy sharing stuff with each other, talking about their day/vacation and stuff. I just don't like doing that. If someone comes and asks me about my weekend or whatever, my replies are never very long because I just don't feel like sharing with them. Somehow, I think this is seen as anti-social behavior? 

If they were to talk to me about something I'm truly passionate about (unfortunately, my co-workers and I don't seem to have much in common) they'd probably beg me to stop talking.

And when im with a group of people, sometimes they just interrupt me, which in turn makes me feel like i shit and then i start to overthink every action i did. It also makes me scared to approach these certain people because i feel like im just a disturbance to them and that they dont genuinely want to be friends with me.

Now, when given the floor for me to speak, i couldnt even express myself properly. I start stuttering and just messing up words. It sucks so much. All i wanted is to just be a normal person like everyone else.. Other people seem to get along immediately. I still need to exert some effort or else everything will be awkward. I always overthink what im going to say next and it just doesnt feel spontaneous. Its so forced.  I also always feel like im boring, and all in all, a piece of shit.

I mitigate as much as possible by smiling like I‚Äôm at Disney world, but that doesn‚Äôt always help and it drains me like a motherfucker.

I spent a lot of time and effort on this topic in particular, until I just settled to a job where I don‚Äôt interact with people hardly at all to recuperate.

OP‚Äôs statement about ‚ÄúThey're not looking down on you‚Äù is SO true.  Apparently people thought I was always Always silently judging them and my silence meant I thought I was too good to talk to them.  Meanwhile, I‚Äôm thinking about fuckin‚Äô ninja turtles or some shit.  Completely unaware of all of that animosity around me, until someone made it plain by getting verbally aggressive with me."
acepukas,fdqu7gv,t1_fdq9a5z,"God this pisses me off. We shouldn't have to adjust for them because they are paranoid and insecure, thinking people who aren't saying something 24/7 are somehow judging them. As far as I'm concerned it's their behavior that's unhealthy. I'd like people to like me but if I have to jump through 50 hoops just to make them feel comfortable than they're just too damn tedious for my tastes and I'm better off without their approval."

When you act friendly and open, it's because you don't want to be ostracized, not because you're magnanimously looking out for their comfort. If you don't want that, power to you, it takes a lot to be comfortable in your own skin and I think everyone struggles with that. However, don't act as if it wasn't for yourself."

If they won't put any effort in after I've made an attempt to socialize with them, than it's a lost cause. Of course then people take my indifference as ""wow that guy's a jerk"". So yeah, back to square one. Seems like that's just the way it's gotta be."

I choose not to talk to others (other than the 2 or 3) at work by own choice. I feel like I‚Äôm the type of person who doesn‚Äôt talk unless there‚Äôs something to say and I don‚Äôt really like small talk just to shoot the shit. But that‚Äôs just me.

When someone tries to talk to me I usually freak out and will just say stuff like ""hm"" or nod. And then they often say they see I don't want to talk so they leave me there. I don't have any ""real life"" friends mainly because of this. I also have a really hard time saying hello to people, which resulted in my only normal relationship ending, and I can't express emotions if I'm with someone, which prevented like 3 other relationships from happening, lol.

I got to know him a little more and it turns out he's nearly deaf, but can hear enough to not have to use sign language. That explained why he talks over quiet people, and why he has social anxiety. We all make sure to speak up when we talk to him and lean more on email and instant messages, and it's worked out better for everyone."
foonsirhc,fdqq3kh,t3_emlplf,"Thanks for this. My social anxiety absolutely manifests itself with me looking like an irritable jerk. Obligatory social gatherings (work party is a perfect example) make me feel trapped and are usually a panic attack waiting to happen - so I usually start looking like asshole beforehand when I try to avoid the situation altogether.

If nothing else, I definitely come off as disinterested. I completely understand when people take offense to me avoiding social things and I often feel incredibly guilty about it. Theres a lot of old friends I feel I owe an apology to who I've essentially lost touch with altogether. To any abandoned friends out there, I'm sorry. I never *wanted* to be a shitty friend."

Frankly, if you're the guy making decisions in the work place, or choosing players for your softball team, you dont have the time to sit and wonder about whether this guy is an asshole or is merely a little shy. I support any viable cure to mental disorders like anxiety, such as meditation and psychedelics, but I'm not sure ambiguating the true intentions of jerks helps. Also, if you're ""mentally healthy"" and still have the audacity to feel anything but compassion and/or indifference to jerks, maybe you're not so mentally healthy.

foxbase,fdqcyxz,t3_emlplf,"Reminds me of this girl who used to work on my team. I have an anxiety disorder so most of this is true for me, and in particular I can come across as cold or rude especially over chat. 

So this girl has the same kind of anxiety as me, but she‚Äôs not so good at being patient with people who she thinks are being rude (as where I‚Äôm used to it so I know when to step away from the keyboard for a moment and to take a breather). This is particularly bad in her case because she almost certainly has some negative cognitive bias that causes her to see people as being hostile when they‚Äôre not. I can relate to this very well, so I can sympathize.

I‚Äôm pretty sure she thought I was always angry with her, because she would constantly start yelling at me over chat out of nowhere, which of course triggered my own anxiety and caused me to have to try to respond calmly which I‚Äôm sure she took as aggression.

Our whole conversations were basically both of us triggering our anxiety with our anxiety, it was like an endless cycle haha. I‚Äôm sad to say I did not enjoy conversing with her, as much as I tried to get her to not see me as a threat, it was in vain because she was very non-confrontational in person. Not that I was particularly interested after finding out she was talking trash about me behind my back, but I digress.

So I guess the moral of this story is yes, having anxiety can make you come off as rude, but you certainly don‚Äôt have to put up with open hostility especially if you‚Äôve talked to the person about it and tried to reconcile no no avail on their end. Be cognizant of the cause, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to suffer because someone else with a problem is unwilling to listen."
roraima_is_very_tall,fdqdk02,t3_emlplf,"this should be popular on reddit. 

as one of those people I can tell you, I AM often a jerk. While this is mostly the result of my anxiety, at some point sufferers need to wake up and actively make efforts to readjust their mindset. For example, in the past I wouldn't move from 'my' side of the sidewalk and if someone was walking towards me, they'd either have to move or we'd collide. Now I try to simply move out of the way. Most people probably don't even go through this math, but for me these are 'boundary violations' and 'I'm not budging' is my go-to. Moving out of the way is so much easier than not and makes a non-incident out of a potential incident."

If it were up to me I'd be back in my native chassis, but for reasons I am not privy to, I have been implanted in this wetware construct to learn things.

I looked at people that I'd like to be like and tried to see how they were. I noticed that many of them smoked weed so I felt like I needed to try it too. I smoked weed a few times with a mindset of being out there. It worked for me. I didn't realize it until a few years after that the shy boy was mostly in my past.    

The weed may have had nothing to do with it and it may have been more of my mindset but the weed let me experience my brain without a shy block. Just to say what I was feeling without restrictions.     

I did noticed that it is something you have to practice though. Anytime I got into a long relationship my social skills dropped since I wasn't putting myself out there as I was just hanging around with one person.    

Maybe my thought process was stupid but if you're really tired of being that guy in the corner it's worth giving it a try.     

Just as a side note, I only smoked weed maybe 5 times. I didn't want to depend on it to not have anxiety. Weed was just to open my view."

I would think that person doesn't like me, and I probably wouldn't like that person in return because of that, especially if I didn't know they have social anxiety and I was receiving the vibe that they don't like me. I get that would be hard to communicate, but unfortunately if I don't have a way of knowing, I don't have a way of thinking differently. I can see the frustration in that, especially how those situations could cause more anxiety, making it more difficult. I think if it is affecting that person's life that much I should be told by someone who knows of the that person having social anxiety, if it is too much for that person to do themselves. If I know, I can easily accommodate it, but regardless I'll definitely keep it in mind in the future.

I would assume this person prefers little social interaction. I would also assume litterally nothing else about this person because they very passively avoided sharing any details upon which to properly make judgments about a person‚Äôs character with and would refrain from doing so without first making an ACTUAL observation and it baffles me that other people decide to jump to conclusions in much the same way you described even though I have observed probably the majority of people doing so."

   If one is so concerned with another; why not make the effort of interaction first, or otherwise understanding what information one has from observation?

   If one didn‚Äôt care about interacting, or becoming friends, with another who‚Äôs unsocial; then why put any thought, effort, feeling into making a judgement?

Or maybe what you ordered wasn't from Amazon itself but one of the 3rd party sellers. I know the 3rd party sellers can have wildly different packaging. Like for example  some have just slapped a shipping label on the actual retail box and sent it and on the other end of the spectrum one time they sent me a box inside a box inside a box with what seemed like a roll of clear tape wrapped around the outermost box lol.

waxedmintfloss,fdqj4mk,t1_fdpb8ua,"Yes, they get around fair pay by using subcontractors as well as by other methods including legalized wage theft and restricting hours to part-time.

I work for a subcontractor and I believe many of the last-mile delivery is done by subcontractors. 

In certain areas anyone with a car can sign up to do freelance deliveries for commissions. Amazon also [encourages](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pros-and-cons-of-amazon-delivery-business-offer/) individuals to become small business owners by recruiting a ‚Äúfleet‚Äù of workers who have to comply with Amazon regulations and quotas, while Amazon is not responsible for providing insurance, materials or benefits. 

Drivers rushing to meet quotas have gotten into accidents and ran people over and Amazon denied [responsibility](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-not-legally-responsible-for-delivery-related-deaths-contract-drivers-2019-9). I‚Äôve also seen YouTube videos shadowing drivers who say their work would be easier with a uniform or safety vest so customers aren‚Äôt suspicious of a stranger coming onto their property, but Amazon won‚Äôt spring for that. 

My own job is in rush grocery delivery. Amazon contracts logistics companies to deliver Whole Foods. Arguably buying Whole Foods was a move to compete with options like Fresh Direct or Peapod in a growing industry. It‚Äôs a tipped industry which means that we receive a subminimum wage and our employer can use part of our tips to pay our minimum wage. My employer justifies this because they are constantly jockeying with competitors to keep the contracts. People who drive directly for Amazon have also shown the [media](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-amazon-drivers-tips-20190207-story.html) proof of wage theft. The delivery app does not show tip payouts, discourages us from face-to-face interaction with a customer, and we are forbidden per Amazon policy to take cash tips. 

By the way, for those who don‚Äôt think we deserve tips - Many of us are hauling multiple customers‚Äô orders by foot or bicycle (cheaper for subcontractors) and customers often don‚Äôt consider how accessible their home is to someone carrying a heavy or numerous load. People will order 12 gallons of water to an apartment with no elevator or a house that has a decorative flight of steps to the door. PrimeNow is a premium service and even if Amazon incentivizes using it, there is ALWAYS an environmental or human cost to getting whatever you want, whenever you want.

I also know people who are employed directly by Amazon and while there is a $15/hour rate and benefits options, hours are kept under 25 a week. Don‚Äôt forget that they recently [slashed](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/12/whole-foods-to-cut-healthcare-for-1900-part-time-employees-in-2020.html) benefits for part-time Whole Foods workers. Whole Foods used to have profit sharing among other [progressive](https://fortune.com/2011/05/18/5-reasons-why-its-great-to-work-at-whole-foods/) benefits. After takeover, Amazon‚Äôs prerogative was to [discourage](https://gizmodo.com/amazons-aggressive-anti-union-tactics-revealed-in-leake-1829305201) unionizing.

TLDR: Yes, they get around fair pay by using subcontractors as well as by other methods including legalized wage theft and restricting hours to part-time."

Landfills Are Too Overcrowded for Trash to Biodegrade. Most landfills are fundamentally anaerobic because they are compacted so tightly, and thus do not let much air in. As such, any biodegradation that does take place does so very slowly.

‚ÄúTypically in landfills, there‚Äôs not much dirt, very little oxygen, and few if any microorganisms,‚Äù says green consumer advocate and author Debra Lynn Dadd. She cites a landfill study conducted by University of Arizona researchers that uncovered still-recognizable 25-year-old hot dogs, corncobs, and grapes in landfills, as well as 50-year-old newspapers that were still readable."

I agree that an important aspect of sustainability is economic sustainability. And I would agree with you that a low cost product would have lower environmental impacts as that low inherent cost suggests less resources to make, however, the difficulty comes when defining proper or efficient handling. For instance, should we define coke as the materials recycler such that they sell the bottle, then handle the downstream material path so that each bottle can be reused until the end of its structural life? 

In a simple paper vs plastic debate, my personal take is that logging is not a comparable environmental impact as something like micro or macro plastics in the ocean, or oil and gas production. In fact, there is a reasonable argument to make that forestry stewardship and responsible logging can significantly reduce or outright mitigate environmental impacts such as a forest fire.

I am an elementary teacher, and I have a large white board that is also a smartboard in my classroom. At least once a year, someone accidentally writes on it with magic marker or sharpie instead of dry erase.  If this happens, all you need to do is cover the markings from the permanent marker using a dry erase marker. Then simply wipe off using a dry washcloth or eraser. I don‚Äôt know why (I‚Äôm sure someone here knows the scientific explanation!), but the dry erase marker ink breaks up the permanent marker ink, and both marks will be erased together!

Here's what I found.

Source 1: Some point to the age of the writer or speaker for the differences in usage between¬†by accident¬†vs.¬†on accident, stating that older speakers and writers are more likely to use¬†by accident¬†while younger ones are more likely to use¬†on accident.

While this might be true in spoken English, it‚Äôs clearly not being transferred to formal written English. As the above graph shows, virtually no one uses¬†on accident¬†in professionally edited writing.

For every one use of¬†on accident,¬†there is 75 uses of¬†by accident. In other words, professional writers and editors do not find¬†on accident¬†to be an acceptable variation of this phrase.



In spoken conversation, you can probably use whichever version sounds more natural to you, at least if you are speaking to an American.

In writing, though,¬†by accident¬†is the standard variant of this phrase. Since¬†by¬†comes before¬†on¬†in the alphabet, remember to use¬†by accident¬†before you even think of using¬†on accident.

It might be an even better idea, though, to use the adverb¬†accidentally¬†instead in most contexts.

https://writingexplained.org/on-accident-or-by-accident

Source 2: On accident¬†is a variation found almost exclusively inside the United States. It¬†is grammatically on par with the phrase¬†on purpose. One can either do something on purpose or¬†on accident. Outside that particular comparison, this version is much less popular than¬†by accident,¬†with the latter being eight times more common. This is including instances outside of the United States as well.

We made little whiteboards up to mark down clues as we go.  We use permanent markers for the grid and dry erase markers for checkmarks etc. so we can wipe them off and play again.   

Long story short: Every week, we have to redo them since the dry erase markers take off the permanent marker if we run into the grid boxes.  I doubt anyone cares, but here I am anyway telling my little story and how this is relevant to me.

Edit: we‚Äôll look into tape for the grids lol I don‚Äôt know why we didn‚Äôt do that in the first place now"
B0bbyDr4k3,fdln95n,t1_fdljsut,"You can buy auto pinstripe tape to make the grids, I've used those in the air force for our flight briefing boards as it keeps things straight and organized."

NessLeonhart,fdmrcng,t1_fdljsut,"i did something similar at work to track something and found the same issue. 

i used half-thickness strips of scotch tape over the permanent lines to 'laminate' them. worked like a charm. basically just stretched a few feet of scotch tape onto a table top, and ran a blade down the center to make thin strips. 

peel them up, apply over the marker lines, long term grid problem solved."

lady_archimedes,fdnupfp,t1_fdljsut,Another trick I used in my classroom is to use wet erase markers for grids and dry erase for marks. Handy for drawing graphs each period without redrawing the axes.

WiIlboBaggins,fdmf6qq,t1_fdljsut,"Buy some washi tape or a sheet of decal vinyl and make your grid semi-permanent!

LongEZE,fdn4fmr,t1_fdmagfz,"It‚Äôs difficult since there is no real secrecy. At the beginning everyone takes turns looking at the cards they got but the rest of the game clues are shared but they are super cryptic. Someone will make a guess.. let‚Äôs say green, candlestick, hall. And it‚Äôll spit out something like ‚Äúthe candlestick was not in the hall‚Äù. This is where having a grid board helps substantially since you can mark down where things weren‚Äôt and draw a conclusion based on the cards only you see at the beginning."
LongEZE,fdn3swa,t1_fdmtfhj,We have an original SNES we bought off eBay. The game and system isn‚Äôt too much. Could probably get everything for 50 bucks.
LongEZE,fdn49xm,t1_fdmci03,"We did at first but we‚Äôd have to re-make the board every game. The matches don‚Äôt last too long so we would play a few games a night and it‚Äôs a pain. From the other responses telling me to use tape, I think we‚Äôll go that route"

angrytacoz,fdly67u,t1_fdlrb1y,"Well no, it is just the solvent. Try erasing dried permanent marker ink with dried dry erase ink. 

At the same time, yes the solvent dissolves both because of their similar polarity, but it‚Äôs really just because this means the same kind of solvents can be used on both. 

The solvent in both is the same, which is why writing over one with the other and wiping before it‚Äôs dried will remove it. You can also just clean it with rubbing alcohol, acetone, or any other similar solvent.

Edit: downvote me all you want, doesn‚Äôt make it any less true"
BewilderNadi,fdm1dac,t3_em0dp2,Easiest way I've found of removing permanent marker from a dry erase board is anti-bac hand gel or perfume (anything with alcohol in it). Works brill every time.

turtletechy,fdm5rrh,t3_em0dp2,"K12 IT here. It works, we recommend it as well for newer Smartboard models too. It works because the solvent in the marker is usually isopropyl alcohol, which will pull up the dye from the marker with both kinds. Permanent marker gets harder the longer it is there though, so early action is key."
spencrou,fdm7zvn,t3_em0dp2,"I've a story about this.  I learned this in 2nd grade. My teacher used a small whiteboard as a bathroom sign out. The chart was drawn in permanent marker, and every once in a while it would get faded parts, and of course we 2nd graders tried to patch it up with the dry erase. My teacher had to tell us to stop doing that, and I've carried the knowledge with me ever since, and it has helped at least 3 other teachers of mine over the years.

**Isopropyl alcohol**, like all alcohols, is **polar**. I'm not saying the solvent can't have some part, but it's primarily thanks to the polarity of the substances that lets you use them to dissolve.

I assume the solvents in the dry erase marker dissolve the permanent ink enough for the release agent to work and the ink to be washed off. One can also use just any kind of alcohol in a high enough concentration but as others mentioned that apparently slowly kills the surface of the white board."

TONKAHANAH,fdlxbqf,t3_em0dp2,"you can also just use rubbing alcohol. I wouldnt advise doing this often though as it can take off the material that allows the white board to effectively let you ""dry"" erase the appropriate markers. If you do need to clean a white board in this way Expo advises using their cleaning material to help keep your whiteboards working properly with dry erase markers. no idea if thats just marketing bs, I dont know what their solution in the bottle really is but I know a white board that's lost its ability to effectively erase proper dry erase markers is not near as much fun as a whiteboard that works properly and a good size white board is not cheap."

draeth1013,fdnbcbi,t3_em0dp2,"Rubbing alcohol does the trick too. Rubbing alcohol + Mr. Clean Magic Eraser will clean up just about anything. Though I'm not sure if the eraser might be a bit abrasive for a white board. At any rate, a rag, rubbing, and some elbow grease will do the trick."

nick0884,fdooi6b,t3_em0dp2,Permanent marker can easily be lifted off a white board using aerosol deodorant.  Basic college teaching survival.
Dogkosher,fdosnbn,t3_em0dp2,You actually said the thing
hitthewallrunning,fdoxqw5,t3_em0dp2,Acetone will remove permanent marker
Dotz0cat,fdppbam,t3_em0dp2,I think it is isopropyl for permanent markers and acetone for dry-erase
THEAmanWithoutaFace,fdq2hvk,t3_em0dp2,"He he this reminds me of an old trick I used to do to teachers that were unfair or just pissed me off enough
Simply find another similar sized permanent texta and swap the guts out of both of them. Making sure that when it is put back it is dropped discreetly in the corner so it‚Äôs just assumed it was overlooked previously. Wait a day or two for the ink to soak through and you get your revenge quietly in the middle of class"

Then the vomiting started. 

For 2 hours. I threw up every 10-15 minutes. 45minutes in dad started giving me popsicles so I would have something to throw up. The liquid was still cold when I threw it up so that felt a lot better than dry heaving bile.

Then you wake up your mom and rush to the hospital after losing well over a pint of blood, and then your sister wakes up during the yelling and panic only to come downstairs to a kitchen covered in blood and thinks her older brother just died and has a panic attack waking everyone else up?

However, blood is VERY irritating to the body when it‚Äôs in places it‚Äôs not supposed to be.  If you start swallowing blood, there‚Äôs a high likelihood you are going to get nauseous and vomit.  Blood in the stomach from oro/nasopharyngeal surgery, or a bloody nose, or upper GI bleed is almost guaranteed to make you puke.

You never know if it‚Äôs clotted or not so you will inevitably remove the tissue and start dripping blood on your shirt again.

It‚Äôs faster to lean back and take deep breaths in and out of your nose. The airflow will make it dry up fast enough before you swallow enough blood to get sick.  I‚Äôve never been sick from this method"

This is what my dad had been taught and so was what I was taught.  My aunt had been a nurse for many years and it was the procedure she followed throughout the 80s.

* Leaning forward, you wind up with a wad of blood you need to deal with.

* Leaning back, inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth.  I can stop my nose from bleeding in under a minute.  Yes, you taste some blood, and it's not exactly pleasant, but it doesn't take long.

LunaLivesX,fdguiro,t1_fdghmv8,"From my experience icing the nose works pretty good as well. I put a washcloth with cold water on it and that helps already. 

When you have a bloody nose you can pinch it at the place where you feel the bone of your face, and that also decreases the blood flow to the nose. It only works for nosebleeds down low in your nose, so if they are higher up icing works better because you can ice the space at the very top of your nose close to your eyes."
arranriois,fdh6ory,t1_fdghmv8,"It's actually more effective. 

The ice on the back of the neck is not well supported by medical literature. But icing your nose is -at least theoretically- better as treatment for epistaxis.

Sucking on ice does work as it reduces blood flow by around 20%"
AzkaBanzai,fdgm7e0,t1_fdgkhga,It might also depend on which part of the nasal canal is bleeding. I‚Äôm guessing the outer parts might work fine with localized icing but the inner parts wouldn‚Äôt benefit nearly as much ü§î

goxg,fdh4vof,t1_fdgjmde,nasal saline is a lifesaver for me (in the winter mostly). i‚Äôll do a couple sprays in each nostril when i wake up and just before going to sleep. i used to have one or two nosebleeds a day in the winter and now it‚Äôs reduced to only one or two a week (if that).
CoolerRon,fdgezgm,t3_el86o3,"I've had nosebleeds since I was a little kid because the lining inside my nostrils is very thin. I've had treatments up to when I was in college and nothing worked. I've tried all tricks in the book - pinching my nostrils and leaning forward, putting an ice pack on my nape (back of the neck), etc. etc. For more than 20 years now what has worked for me is to stuff rolled toilet paper up the nostril where it bleeds, pinch my nose, and replace the tp as it gets soaked. I do this and repeat until it stops bleeding. The blood never goes down my esophagus nor does it pool in my throat. My nose bleeds about every other day"
Pawn78,fdgfehz,t1_fdgezgm,Broke my nose as a child and now I'm cursed with weekly nosebleeds. This is honestly the best way to deal with them imo.
LordCongra,fdgudws,t1_fdgezgm,"I wrote this in another comment but if your nose bleeds every other day I feel like you need to hear it too so I'll type the trick I learned here too.

Whatever nostril you're bleeding from, stomp the opposite side heel on the ground 5 or so times (more if it doesn't stop). It *should* stop the bleeding, though if you reach 10 stomps the bleed might be too bad or something? Idk it's black magic I learned from an Athletic Trainer friend of mine. She's used it with her athletes to great effect so far, and I've tried it once or twice and it's worked for me."
MayOverexplain,fdhcg1v,t1_fdgezgm,"Same here, never gotten sick from swallowing a lot of blood either, throat just gets irritated.

Tight roll of TP is best solution definitely. Acts as compress against septum which is typically where the bleeding is coming from."
DoctorSalt,fdj2ygd,t1_fdgezgm,My trick is to roll up paper towel/TP and place it under my upper lip - thick enough to slow the flow of blood and allow clotting. I don't have any medical literature to back it up but empirically it works quickly.
Borderline_Insane22,fdh4k8p,t1_fdgudws,What?
FreezingPyro36,fdix6du,t1_fdh4k8p,My best guess is that it lessens the blood flow. Idk thats just a guess
LordCongra,fdhc6jt,t1_fdh4k8p,Closest theory on why I've had it explained for why it works is a reflexive vasoconstriction (you have certain nerve points in your feet that connect to different parts of your body) so in this case it works to cause the capillaries in the nostril to constrict and stop the bleeding

The bleeding eventually stopped and I went to bed a few hours later. Around midnight I woke up feeling very nauseous and basically threw up all the blood I had swallowed.

When my parents came to see what was wrong (I had yelled for them), they freaked out like mad. The vomit was very dark red, almost kind of purply with thick lumpy clots. They obviously called the ambulance because their kid just threw up blood. They didn't realise it was from the nosebleed and my dad suffered a shock that gave him something kind of similar to a heart attack and got checked up on at hospital too.

So yeah, I learnt my lesson and never tipped my head back again during the many heavy nosebleeds I would suffer from for the next few years."

LunaLivesX,fdgv5tr,t1_fdgj9i0,"Really? I always learned to pinch not at the flexible part of the nose but higher, like across the bridge of the nose. You should pinch the nose at a place where there are bones so that you have something to use force against. The goal is not to close off your nose but to restrict blood flow to it. When you pinch a higher part of the nose, the blood can still flow out of your nose but there will be less of it.

Not funny side effect of pinching your nose in a way that closes it off: one time I actually cried blood because the blood could not go out through my nose. It's really scary."

So once I was having a pretty bad case of the flu and had a few nosebleeds a day, where bloody snot would build up at the back of my nose (enjoy your lunch, dear readers). My mother insisted that I put my head back to stop the bleeding, because it was really gushing out of me. I resisted, told her no, but she simply put her hands on my head and tilted it backwards. So the big ass blob of bloody mucus slid right down my throat. I couldn't even cough it up and spit it out because my head was tilted backwards. And I swallowed. I had no choice. I swallowed the entire blob. It was sickening. And I was upset and mad and crying. It was gross and my stomach was upset.

&#x200B;

Later that day I had another one of those nosebleeds. And I managed to spit it out. A towel filled with some sort of afterbirth. My parents were shocked. Yeah bitches, earlier today you made me swallow this shit.

&#x200B;

And after this blob was out, the blooding stopped as well."
PresidentZagan,fdgj2p8,t3_el86o3,I know someone who thinks they just need to keep blowing their nose until it stops bleeding.
Wolffir,fdgkdnk,t3_el86o3,I always lean back when my nose bleeds and I have never had a problem. Maybe it's just me.
N-Word-Pass-Verified,fdgkk9h,t3_el86o3,"I had an obese teacher that took the ""clotting"" term to be dangerous when it comes to blood noses. Even 3rd grade me knew it was because of her health problems, most likely too many heart attacks and she still, presumably spent her entire life insisting the word ""clot"" was very dangerous in every situation."
tripanfal,fdgkx81,t3_el86o3,If you want to stop a nosebleed fast roll paper towel about double the width of a cigarette and about two inches long.  Run it under cold water and then pack it in your mouth under your top lip.  I used to visit the hospital often as a kid to get them cauterized then a dr did this in the waiting room once.  Never been back.

tronselm,fdgnc4n,t3_el86o3,My mom used to make me lay on my back.  I swallowed stomach-fulls of blood as a child.  My teacher taught me this trick.
GoressenGlover,fdgnjsj,t3_el86o3,"As someone with regular nosebleeds, especially during hot weather, I've never had any issues tilting my head back. Not suggesting that it's the right thing to do, just that I've never had any negative side affects and found my nosebleeds stopped a lot quicker that way. Could this be different from person to person?"
Shicaca44811,fdgnx28,t3_el86o3,"I used to get nose bleeds SO often when I was younger, but this was a recommendation that didn‚Äôt come until later in my life. 

I always leaned back and it‚Äôd stop relatively quickly. When I read this I tried the ‚Äúlean forwards‚Äù method. I sat there for 15-20 minutes and it wouldn‚Äôt stop (and didn‚Äôt slow down either), so I leaned it back and in a few minutes it slowed down and stopped.

Luckily since I‚Äôve aged, this has slowed considerably. 

I got a nose bleed at work and went to the on-site medic. They refused to let me lean my head back so we did the head forwards thing again. That, ice on the bridge of my nose, etc., it wouldn‚Äôt stop even after an hour. I kept telling them to let me lean back and they said no. Finally the medic said, ‚ÄúIf it doesn‚Äôt stop in the next 5 minutes we‚Äôll have to have you transported to the ER‚Äù. I said, ‚ÄúFine but I‚Äôm leaning back until then‚Äù & he finally said OK. 5 minutes later it stopped. 

The TL;DR - while yes this is what the medical communities suggest, it may not work and not bleeding is far superior to bleeding... do what works for you."
DrScience-PhD,fdgnyin,t3_el86o3,"Obviously you don't swallow it but tipping your head back makes it clot faster, at least for me. Breathing in through your nose, out of your mouth, and spitting everything out will clot in a minute or two. I used to get 2-3 a week and tipping your head forward will just have you hemmoraging blood for a good 15 minutes."

Itshowyoueatit,fdgpj1i,t3_el86o3,"A word of advise.   I have suffered from nosebleeds for a long time.  A couple of months ago I got the worse one ever.   Almost seven hours straight with very minor breaks in between.  It was not light, it was heavy.   I tried everything I knew.    I even have this stuff they sell at the pharmacy that has worked for me before.

It finally stopped at about 8:00am and I headed directly to the doctor.  She said, two things.  You probably have a weak blood vessel and you may want to have it cauterised.  First try vitamin K2.  I did and not one nosebleed since."

cruxfire,fdgqu7f,t3_el86o3,YES! I used to get nosebleeds all the time as a kid and the nurse would always tell me to tilt my nose back and I would almost throw up from swallowing all the blood. I figured out later that tilting my head forward and blowing into a tissue would make it stop faster.
phoenix415,fdgrfun,t3_el86o3,"I had chronic nosebleeds as a child. I've heard the full range of suggestions a million times, but none of them were as effective as making a little tissue bullet, sticking it in the nostril, and just continuing on with my day. Done."

randomuser659,fdgtkbz,t3_el86o3,"More tips.... If you're prone to nosebleeds, use a qtip to apply KY inside your nostrils twice a day. Avoid things like Vaseline or bacitracin. It will help properly moisturize inside your nose during dry times. 

Hold pressure for five minutes with no peeking. This will ensure a good clot had the chance to form.  Try not to blow your nose for a while after to allow the mucus membrane to heal."
LordCongra,fdgu3cz,t3_el86o3,"It's a bit late so idk if this comment will get any traction but: weird nosebleed solution

Whatever nostril the blood is coming from, stomp your opposite heel 5 or so times (more if you need to). The bleeding will stop basically instantly. 

Learned this trick from a friend of mine who is an Athletic Trainer, she uses it whenever any of her athletes get a nosebleed."
ChrisPly,fdguazh,t3_el86o3,And don't forget the cold press or cold wash cloth either on the nose or you could even do the base of back of the neck. That can really help too!
TheArborphiliac,fdgudp2,t3_el86o3,"I used to get nosebleeds constantly and my strategy was to just lean over the toilet and let it bleed for a while before I started trying to clean up and stop it.  Good to know that was the correct strategy.

I did go see There Will Be Blood in the theater and got a nosebleed that lasted most of the film, and I just tipped my head back and swallowed. Every now and again I'd lean forward to see if it was still bleeding, but I only had a couple napkins and didn't want to miss the movie so I mainly kept it in.  Never vomited, though, so maybe having them so often younger made my stomach able to handle the blood or something."
GabeShadoww,fdgumks,t3_el86o3,I agree. I have nosebleeds about every 2 weeks in winter an leaning your head forward over a sink (or outside) may even get you a completely free nose if you just let the blood flow out freely.
inferno7799,fdgut28,t3_el86o3,"Putting my head forward makes the blood drip from my nose which makes a big mess everywhere. Tilting it back and holding my nose slowly blocks the bleeding and some trickles down to my stomach indeed, but it has never irritated my stomach."

If I lean forward it just increases the flow of blood, presumably because of more pressure on my head. If I lean backwards it just goes down my throat (never felt any nausea/irritation, not sure why everyone says that). The solution that works best for me is to roll/fold a strip of kleenex/toiletpaper into a ball/cylinder kind of shape and stick it hard into my nostril. Hurts at first but once you get used to it it's nothing. Wait 30 mins or longer and take it out.

BlueStoneArt,eob76n,top_level,"I had my own paralegal buisness and one of the things we dealt with daily was wills/estates.  We also received far too many calls about someone passing who left NO instructions, NO will and no information at all, looking on what the next step would be.

The most common reason for those calls was because children were involved and now what.

Even if you are married and have significant family you assume will take care of it...don't assume. Life changes in a heartbeat. I could tell story after story about children left in foster care because of parents lack of planning.  Or of people losing houses, vehicles, entire life savings, just everything.

No one wants to think about end of life. It's dark, it's uncomfortable, it's boring.  But lack of planning has caused nightmarish situations that can go on for years after your death.

The minute you find out you are pregnant, you should contact an attorney/paralegal for creating a will and get life insurance.

You cannot presume your spouse will automatically get everything. That is not true. An attorney/paralegal can advise you best on this and your local/state laws.

Do not forget bank accounts, and passwords. Not for social media, but for access to a lot of things. Safe deposit boxes. Location of documents, making sure your social security number is available for survivor benefits.

This is twice as important if you have children and you are divorced. Your former spouse will not have access to anything if you have not specified it legally and in writing. You have a vintage Shelby you want your 9 year old to have when he turns 16? Put it in legal writing or it will likely be sold, or have no legal title or be uninsurable.  Have a collection of vintage toys your daughter would love, even if she's only two now?  Put it in writing, because it could be sold, tossed or fought over.  

Sorry to be dark, but another thread made me think of this. Most people don't think about it until they are older. Or they presume, ""eh, my spouse will get everything"" or ""I don't have anything so what the heck"".  It matters. Far too many nightmares have ensued because of lack of planning over simple things.

Take an afternoon to plan, take another to sit down and put it in writing and have it properly notarized and witnessed.  Your loved ones will thank you.

EDIT: I didn't realize this would get so much attention, but I am really glad it did. It's important. One of the most important things you will do.

I have responded to quite a few questions and provided significant information on where to find attorneys to do this, what to do if you can't afford it, and more. 

No one is allowed to give legal advice online, please dont ask. I am not an attorney, and even if I were, again, no one is allowed to give legal advice.  I can give suggestions, and guidelines, to the best of my ability and knowledge. But I cannot tell you how to word it so Aunt Rosie doesn't waltz off with your poodle, and Uncle Ralph can't take your motorcyle. That would be legal advice lol. 

If you do have questions, please feel free to ask. I do have a life, so I'm not sitting here waiting to answer questions, it's not an AMA, so have patience. I'm looking at over 30 PMs and I will do my best. Thanks!"
readerf52,febnj7w,t3_eob76n,"I would add to ask the people you want to be responsible for your children if *they* want that responsibility as well.  

We have a special needs child, and as soon as we heard about it (she was 4 or 5) we drew up a special needs trust fund with a lawyer who did those, and pretty much only those.  We contacted a family member and explained the responsibilities of being in charge of her funds, and since he is a financial planner, he was open to being named in our will.  

Our lawyer contacts us whenever there are changes in the law, or just because we haven‚Äôt gone over things in a while.  Yes, it‚Äôs billable hours, but it is always worth it.

This is a solid YSK."
BlueStoneArt,fec52ui,t1_febnj7w,"You are an unsung hero for being prepared. It is a true act of love.

 It is with high hopes that it is never utilized and you see your child grow to adulthood.

It is extremely important to make sure that the ones you designate are okay with it. You simply cannot assume people will do it, even if it's your mom or your brother. Life changes.

Especially if you have a child with mental, emotional or physical needs beyond the norm. It can be a lot to take on.

You sound prepared so I will say this for others: make sure people know the doctors for your child, immunization records, therapists, etc. Think of all the things you know about your child.  Someone else will not know these things and it will make it so much harder on the little one.

My sister died unexpectedly and she has a special needs child. There was nothing. We had no idea who he saw for anything, not even which school he went to since it wasn't the local child center. We knew he went to ""school"" and that was it. He couldn't tell us, he wasn't verbal.  We had no idea where the oxygen came from, how to get the wheelchair fixed, who prescribed his glasses and hearing aids...nothing. We knew these things happened, we just didn't know how or with whom.  It was a puzzle that had to be figured out and fast, along with the grief. That and who he'd be living with. None of us were set up for wheelchairs and hearing impairment. We didn't know sign language. An absolute nightmare for this poor child."

littlebudgie,fecoruq,t1_fecm5my,People on reddit (read: Americans) get weird about this one. They see it as either volunteering to be legal guardian if required or it's at least implied in godparent status. I'm in NZ and a godparent and this is not a common way of thinking.
moodycats,fecqfhj,t1_fecm5my,Good point. I've only heard godparent being used in the context of one who looks after a child in the case of something happening to the parents - so legal guardian.

Feenzauber,feb38y2,t3_eob76n,Absolutely true and very important.
lowhangingfruitcake,fecfdll,t1_feb38y2,"Kids think about this stuff, and are reassured by matter of fact truth and planning.  When I was a kid, I knew what aunt and uncle I‚Äôd live with if the worst happened.  My own kids lost their dad to cancer three years ago,  so they are unfortunately very aware of how bad things really do happen.  One of the things their bio dad did right was to have conversations with everyone in the same room- to make it explicitly clear what he wanted.  It was in his will, but it would have been hard to argue something in court that he laid out in front of everyone.  My kids and I have a lot of candid conversations about what would happen to them if I died or if their stepdad and I both died and where they would want to go.   They are lucky that they have options, but their personal preferences aren‚Äôt necessarily the most obvious choices.  Stepdads do not have legal rights, part of why we are moving forward with formal is because they want to stay with him.   It sounds morbid and scary to talk about death with kids, but in reality they think about it all the time, we‚Äôre just too chicken to talk truthfully too then.   

Talking about things, your preferences, to the right people matters.  It‚Äôs good to have a living will, better to have a health care proxy, but even better when everyone in your family knows what you want.  As an MD- if the whole family is at the bedside saying ‚Äòthis is what xxx said they want‚Äô then that carries a lot more weight than a piece of paper.  And if there is disagreement at the bedside, even with a solid legal power, there may be trouble or more heartbreak in having your wishes carried out

Also- besides a clear will - make a list of all your accounts and passwords, or have sone kind of system where someone can access it all.   That password book was incredibly helpful."

None of us knew where any of it was minus one farm. It wasn't cheap to settle her estate. If she had left ANY kind of probate it would have been inexpensive and we could have honored her real wishes instead of guessing. She was almost 80 but still didn't expect to die.

Spend the money and get a proper Will drafted up you dolts!"
BlueStoneArt,fec8uwh,t1_febq04q,"THIS is exactly the reason I've posted this. It is a bloody freaking nightmare to deal with intestate death.

The only reason I specified children in the headline is that so many people really don't think about the real and serious threat to their children should anything happen to them.

One woman we had as a case study for wills was walking in a crosswalk with her two children.  They were hit by a car and severely injured.  She had no spouse and the childrens father was in custody in another state, with no legal access or rights.

She was left in a coma for 60 days. The children were hospitalized for two days for one, ten days for the other.  None of the social workers could find anything for family or friends to contact. Police officers went to her home and looked for anything. 

A piece of paper with some names and phone numbers. They contacted the five people on the list and only one was a relative, and lived in another country.  They had no way to come to the US and did not really want to deal with the issue at all.

The children were released, one on the second day, and went to a childrens home. The other was released ten days later, into a special needs home because they needed ongoing care to heal from their injuries. A case worker had to be assigned that could make medical decisions for the children.

The youngest child, the one released on day two, had severe allergies and no one knew this. They didn't know who her doctor was, and at three years old she couldn't tell them anything. She had a severe reaction to an allergen. Then another. And another. They put her back in the hospital before she ended up dying from allergic reactions.

The mom wakes up.  She's got serious recovery to do from her injuries.  But no one knows where her kids are. Eventually it all gets brought to her, but it's WEEKS, not hours or days. She is released to a rehab facility to continue her recovery. She is not seeing her children because they now live too far away. The special needs one (just for injuries) lived over 500 miles away now.

It took her 3.5 years to get her children back. Can you imagine? All because she did not plan, or have instructions, or designate someone. The youngest went from three years old to around 7 when she went home, to a stranger she called ""Mom"".

Really sad but truly brings it home how important it is."
splendid-raven,fechi5f,t1_fec2k0i,"Wouldn't she have been able to contest the will? From my understanding, most places will take into account the fact that she hadn't been born yet and see that as a valid reason.

noriender,fecdj2h,t1_fec2k0i,Wtf. In my country every child has to get at least a certain percentage of the will of their parents (even if the will states differently).

SoVerySleepy81,febnlh3,t3_eob76n,"I think it's important for people to know that while your wishes for who you kids live with is taken into account, the final decision is made by a judge as far as I'm aware. So if there are people you absolutely do NOT want your children to live with document it. Document the nasty shit they do, talk to your close friends and family. Make it incredibly clear that X people are unsuitable and that you don't want them to have custody, nor do you want them to have visitation. Please correct me if I'm wrong OP but from what I understand children cannot be ""willed"" to someone because they're people."
BlueStoneArt,fec9sg2,t1_febnlh3,"You are correct, children are not ""willed"".  Parents can assign temporary guardianship for who can take immediate custody/care and make legal and medical decisions for them in the interim. But yes, there will be court documents filed that give full legal custody. Indeed, if anyone comes forth that thinks they will be  a better home for the children and debates it, the judge can make a decision that goes against your wishes.

This is why going to an attorney/paralegal who specializes in these things is essential. There are many twists and turns in financial/family/business/real estate matters. Getting it right is extremely important.

I've covered a lot of information to the best of my ability and with what I know.  Things could have changed or may not apply in your area.  Wills/estates law addresses very complicated issues, so just having a general attorney may not work if you have things that are complicated.

A famous case is the children of Michael Jackson and how he named his quite elderly mother as the custodial parent and the family fought that because of her age. If I remember correctly (I didn't follow it closely so I could be wrong) they left custody with his mother, but his brothers or a cousin had legal decision making abilities regarding living arrangements and funds."

I was putting off writing a will for my parrot because hiring a lawyer is just one of those things that gets put off again and again. But in Texas, a will is valid if you write it by hand.

BlueStoneArt,fec7qtx,t1_febrxk2,"It depends on your situation. If it is just you, yes. Use a template you get online, print it out.  Don't ""put it away somewhere"" though. If someone does not know where it is or what it contains, it's useless. No one is going to go through all of your stuff and paperwork looking for it. Not happily.  Especially if grieving. They may assume you died intesate (no will) and let the state take everything.

If you have  more than yourself, you should do more. I've written out quite a bit throughout the thread, a lot of information, and you can see if any of that helps you decide."
wupdup,fecivwx,t1_febrxk2,"Unless you have a complicated estate, no, you don't need a lawyer. Get Nolo Willmaker software or similar. It has a wizard interface where you answer questions. Then you print the will and get it notarized with 2 witnesses, for most states.

Even more important than a will in my book is to designate beneficiaries for your bank accounts and house. This bypasses probate, which can also bypass claims on your estate, like from the hospital. For a bank account it's called a Payable on Death designation. Include retirement accounts like a 401k or IRAs. For a house it's called a Transfer on Death designation, done via the county recorder. You may need to own the house with no mortgage. Some states also allow cars to have beneficiaries.

2nd most important in my book is a document for your heirs that tells them all they need to know about your assets, like the bank accounts you have and the beneficiaries you designated. In some states the accounts you specify in your will are forced to go through probate, so you want to omit from your will those that have designated beneficiaries, and then it's important to list those in the main document. In my document I tell my heir how to find the logins for all of my accounts."

The state of Texas by law leaves the spouse the primary beneficiary. He was never legally divorced. 

He properly designated his girlfriend as the beneficiary on all of his paperwork. His girlfriend actually got the life insurance because he filled out the right paperwork and that‚Äôs what the carrier goes by unless proven otherwise. 

His estranged wife has a case, but she‚Äôll have to fight for it. Apparently she is trying, but it‚Äôs a fight with the insurance carrier and not with the girlfriend and son luckily.

They actually check in with the girlfriend and son. They gave additional financial help with son‚Äôs tuition, son‚Äôs housing, and girlfriend‚Äôs housing. That kid and lady have more help and love than they can ever hope for and they both appreciate it so much. 

They made it part of their promise (in writing) to employees to help and assist their family. As electrical workers I‚Äôm sure you can imagine the relief and positive impact. They very rarely have turnover. 

But honestly this is such a rare situation. 

I‚Äôve had employers fight to NOT give the life insurance because they were planning on firing or they were getting written up or blah blah blah bullshit.

Sure, she could ruin us if she decided to open it and use it for nefarious purposes. But, we trust her with our kids so we trust her with this as well. As things change, I ask for the letter back and give her an updated version."

If they tried to take advantage of your personal information you would notice, and stop them (admittedly with some difficulty and cost). And more importantly, these are the people you‚Äôre potentially entrusting with your children. If you can‚Äôt trust them with your personal info while you‚Äôre alive, you shouldn‚Äôt trust them with your children after your dead. Sounds like you chose good people."
legendofriss,febsd6e,t3_eob76n,How would you go about doing that? There are certain people that i do not want to have access my to children. Does it cost me money to leave a will? Does it have to be notorized? Can I just sign a piece of paper writing my wishes? This is something I want to do but have no idea the steps to make it official.
fiftyMM,fec4m4u,t1_febsd6e,"We went to an estate lawyer, two appointments at her office, the cost is about $4K ‚Äî we‚Äôre in SF. Costs could be different in you‚Äôre area.  Totally worth it and the peace of mind of course."
BlueStoneArt,fec7963,t1_febsd6e,"You can just sign a piece of paper and it will have zero legal standing. It is possible that if there is a court case because of your death and custody is an issue, the judge MIGHT take your wishes into consideration. There would be a guardian ad litem granted the children to determine what is best for them. The GAL may not know all that you know about family, and decide that the mansion life is best in spite of Mommy Dearest being the wicked witch you don't want anywhere around them.

Legal Aid will not do wills for low income folks, however they MAY be able to steer to a pro bono lawyer (free). Lawyers are required to do so many pro bono cases per year and doing a will would fulfill that requirement and be fairly easy. You can contact Legal Aid and ask if they'd be able to help you with a referral. Some lawyers do let Legal Aid know they'd be open to pro  bono referrals.

Another low income option is if you have a university nearby that has a law school.  The law school may have clinics that are open to seniors/disabled/low income.

You can ask at the local DHS office if there are legal clinics or referrals.

That's the best I can come up with off the top of my head.  You can also call the State Bar Association for your state and see if there is anything.  Even if they don't have a specific referral, they can give the names and phone numbers of lawyers in your area that specialize.  Most lawyers have a free 15/30 min consult. Not all, so ask.  When you make an appt tell them you are looking for a pro bono or very low cost will. If they can't do it, they might know who needs the pro bono hours.

They can best advise you on how to make your children bullet proof to any unwanted family trying to weasel into their lives.

Best of luck. Don't give up! It's important."
NotThrowAwayAccount9,fec3w9p,t1_febsd6e,"There are lots for wills and other legal documents, but the safest route is to hire a lawyer or at least a legal professional to guide you through the process. This ensures that everything is properly noted and signed off on and the documents are legal.

If you try to do it on your own it might help your wishes be known, but it likely won't hold up in court."
piouiy,fec5jut,t1_febsd6e,"In the UK, drafting a standard will for my wife and I, cost about ¬£300. We wrote complimentary wills, so if I die, it goes to her, and vice versa. And if we both died, we have the exact same specifications of who should get what, including money going to friends and family in exchange for them looking after our kids. 

Worth doing, and a good lawyer can write things which mean you don‚Äôt need to keep amending their will. For example, When we wrote the first one we only had one child. Now we have more. But that‚Äôs fine because all the provisions for children were written with that in mind. 

You can do it yourself. There are templates available, but I would only use that if you had a very simple case - ie you‚Äôre a young and single person with no dependents. Once you have a partner and kids, there‚Äôs more room to screw up or accidentally write something contradictory."

ZionIsFat,fecmd4x,t1_fecdi6f,"Not OP's fault that you don't have the financial literacy to save up some money. Don't rant about how you have no money while you are also paying a monthly bill on a $1000 smartphone. How about buy a $250 smartphone and then use the other $750 on being a responsible parent and creating a will?

It's not a matter of having a thousand dollars ""lying around,"" it's a matter of treating your will like any other major expense in life.

I grew up on welfare and food stamps, I'm not disconnected from the reality of living poor. Owning a $1000 cell phone when you live paycheck to paycheck is being disconnected from reality. Earning $50k and being incredulous on how you could possibly save up a couple hundred dollars is being disconnected from reality. This isn't ""I need $1000 NOW,"" this is saving up money at *any* point in your future."
Manticx,fecjkrq,t1_fecixt3,"Comparatively, you are absolutely well off. Yes, as I said in another comment, poor financial choices isn't an excuse, but it's still the reality that millions of people live in. 

But the idea that you either qualify for financial assistance or you already have money in your savings account is ludicrous. A lot of people, average people, people you walk by every day, live in the middle.

edit: You can easily say ""well just have a budget"". But that's dismissive of a lot of people's realities.

Edit 2: I just keep laughing at the comment I replied to. Emergencies happen constantly. For everyone. Life doesn't care about your financial problems. Life throws car maintenance at you, vet bills because your dog is sick or cat got attacked by another local pet, or don't get me started on your own medial bills. Haven't hit your maximum out of pocket for the year? Need minor surgery? You now owe thousands of dollars. 

After all those emergencies, you still have cash in your bank account? Yes, you're well off. Those emergencies didn't happen to you? Thank God every night.

Edit3: a family member died and now you have to pay to drive, or God forbid fly, for the funeral. Another family members house burnt down, not you have to spend savings to buy your loved ones food and clothes, not to mention fire proof your own home. Your car has two flats. Your wife's car has transmission problems. You want to buy your children gifts, or maybe your nieces and nephews gifts because otherwise you'll know they'll get nothing from Santa this year if you don't. You need minor surgery that require three different labs running test and each doctor/nurse will be billing you. Every bill is late, so add on late fees. 

Life doesn't stop throwing problems at you. Yes, if you have money saved after all of that, you are well off. You don't think you are, because you're version of ""well off"" is flying first class to Jamaica for holidays. And that person's idea of well off is flying a personal jet to their holiday Mansion. 

It's all relative. I know there are people who are low income and see that I have a used car note and think I'm well off."
Manticx,fecmz9e,t1_fecmd4x,"Very dismissive. As I've stated, poor financial planning isn't an excuse. And yet it's the reality we live in. Many people. Right now. Not theoretical or hypothetical.

""I'm not like you, so I'm not sure I need x, and anyway I bought y a few years back""

""It's not my fault you bought y! You're an idiot!""

When I mention my bills, I want to express that im not low income. I know I have luxuries. I would have plenty of money in the back account if not for the constant bullshit life throws my way. Like everyone else.

Maybe one day the car will be paid off, and the credit card balance will be zero, and the college debt will be done.

cicadasinmyears,fecd9z3,t3_eob76n,"I‚Äôd just like to add, especially for those of you who are going the DIY route: please, please ensure your wills and powers of attorney are properly witnessed (requirements will vary by location; the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù I‚Äôve always seen used is you sign in front of two witnesses who are there at the same time; everyone uses blue ink; everyone initials each page - and they don‚Äôt need to read your will to do so, you can use the bottom right-hand corner) and get several (three or more) original certified true copies or notarized originals executed. One should go to each of your executors/POAs and their alternates, one should be kept somewhere safe. For good measure, I always write ‚ÄúThis is copy X of Y total original executed copies‚Äù as a footer along the bottom.


Also: as others have mentioned, make a list of your assets - account numbers, contact info, locations, etc., for your major assets and attach it as a Schedule (terms may vary) to your will. You will save your executor/family a lot of time and effort when they are trying to cope with losing you, and fewer things will be forgotten/missed.

BlueStoneArt,fec63oa,t1_febubgq,"If you look online you can get templates for filling out a will. The needs change depending on your situation. Is it just you? Or you and a spouse?  Basic template will be fine, being sure you make your spouse beneficiary and make accommodation for if you should both die at the same time.

Is there a business? Property? Children? Get an attorney/paralegal who specialize in this area.  The more complicated your situation (divorce, partnerships in business, children with different partners, etc) the more important this becomes. 

Also important to designate any funds if there should be a significant payout because of your death. Such as if you die in a plane crash, or result of medical negligence, or catastrophic failure of some sort.

Not having good advice can be catastrophic and laws change. You can find an estates/will attorney (I was going to say yellow pages..that's my age showing lol) online.  Do look at reviews for the attorney if available.

BlueStoneArt,fecd7t2,t1_fec5suw,"Many attorneys will do a free 15/30 min consult. It would be really hard to give an estimate without knowing what it entails.

Depending on your area, and how complicated, it could be $300 to $5000. That's a big range, yes, but there is so much to be considered.

Call an attorney and make an appt. Negotiate the initial consult if you can. You may not be able to.  Plan on $150 as a median figure. Go and lay out a rough idea and what you have in mind. You can say ""I have rental properties, I manage them, I have a spouse, one kid, and some vacation property undeveloped. I co own a business with two others.  What are we looking at in terms of hours and cost?""

If an attorney charges $200/hour and it's three hours...

It's not just about having kids or having complicated assets or families--even the simplest situation will be a pain because it will have to go through probate and all sorts of BS first. Plus, I named charities in the will, so they'll get some money as well.

The only tricky thing is having some sort of digital will...I wanted to set up something in LastPass, but I gather my family member(s) would need their own account first, and I don't think they have them.

BlueStoneArt,fecfbrm,t1_fecbi4r,"Is your daughter a minor? Then it is not good enough.

Usually you would leave a copy with a trusted friend/family member. In this day and age, we don't always have that. So I would suggest that it be left someplace visible in a labeled envelope, such as clipped to the fridge.

Seniors and disabled folks leave important information such as contacts, family members, meds taken, drs they use, in an envelope on the fridge for EMTs to use. I don't see why this wouldn't work for a will. Just label it ""Last Will and Testament"" or ""in case of serious injury or death"" or anything you desire. Plain #10 envelope or a manila, doesn't matter.

Or pin it to a bulletin board. Whatever works for you."

comparablebeast,fecfun8,t3_eob76n,"Why wouldn‚Äôt a spouse automatically get custody of the things you leave behind? Unless you have a prenuptial agreement, isn‚Äôt that the whole point of marriage? Combining two into one? 

I say this as an unmarried person. I also know that tax write offs are an appealing reason why some choose to marry but that seems lame that you‚Äôd have to write a will in that case to designate."
BlueStoneArt,fecgrx5,t1_fecfun8,"Unfortunately I cannot go into specifics because legalities against that.  But a few that come to mind:

A bank account with just the deceased name on it.

Life insurance through an employer that did not name the spouse and wasn't changed at marriage.

A vehicle that has just the deceased persons name on title, barring sale or insurance.

A vacation property co owned by the deceased persons family without the spouse as a named co owner.

Access to children from a previous marriage, even if the deceased person is custodial. Let's say Joe and Jenny are married, but Jenny had kids with Bob when they were married.  Jenny dies. Bob could come take the kids away from Joe, if he is not named as the person to care for the children after Jennys' death. Bob has that right, and may fight custody. But Joe will have MUCH better legal standing in court if he is named custodial.

Thats just a few I can think of. There is quite a bit that is more specific.

Marriage makes many things easier, legally. It's not to say the spouse wouldn't get the vehicle, let's say, but now there are five more steps to it. 

Probate addreses these issues."

Make an appointment with an attorney FOR your father, and take him to it. Help him get his documents in order. That would be best route.

This one, I'm not so sure about but I'm going to suggest it anyway.

Film a deposition type thing.

Sit down with dad at the kitchen table. Someplace where it's bright, well lit, and it's clear he's not under the influence of alcohol or medication that would alter his thinking.

Have a set of questions available. Tell him you want to discuss family business. Have his wife there if you prefer. Have your sister there if you prefer. Witnesses would be good.

""Hi, dad, can you tell us the day and date today for the purpose of this taping?""  Let's them know he's oriented.

""Okay, how about your birthday? Just go along with it dad, the legal stuff's boring but they might send you a cake in the great beyond, you never know""

""Annd your social security number?"" (You may or may not. Some people are very skeptical of giving that number for fear of scams. It's cool, as long as you have it or know it. Still ask)

""So, you know we're here to talk about what happens if anything happens to your or Mrs. You, right? Yeah, it's boring and I'll be fast, promise""

""First, can you tell us what you want done if you end up on life support? I know, sis has to donate a kidney and you dont' want my liver, got it. But what about Mrs You over there...you want the plug to stay in so you can tell her bad jokes and ask when dinners ready?  Or would you prefer to go meet Frank Sinatra?""

""Okay, moving on, what about the house? You want us to just blow it up for fun? You want Sis living here with the kids? You got ideas?""

""What about the car?""

""What about life insurance?""

""What about if you and Mrs You disappear in a poof of smoke together?""

So, cover the legal parts (oriented to time and date, remembers name date of birth, who his wife is, etc). Then keeping it light AND serious, go on the more serious stuff.   Don't sit with the phone or camera in your hand. That shaky video is brain shattering. Mount it somewhere, straight at your dad. Before you start, take a video of everyone there, ask them to state their names.

Later, you can type up a transcript, load it to the cloud or a ....oh fudge the word escapes me, the little drive you  plug in? Make three copies. One for you, one for sis and one in case of fire, flood, etc...kept in a safe spot.

That's the best I have. Hope it helps.

Rolling the dice with foster care would have been preferable to what I knew I‚Äôd experience with my grandparents.

If my parents had made legal arrangements for my care, I would have at least had the peace of mind of knowing I would have somebody on my side if my parents were gone. It‚Äôs not something anybody wants to think about, and definitely not something you would normally want to discuss with your children, but having those arrangements in place would have made me feel much more secure while I was growing up."

My mother and father were unmarried, and when he passed there was no will. The only documentation present was an affidavit saying that I was his child. No life insurance, no will, nothing. 

My mother was fortunate enough that his brother (the only one of the family who displayed kindness towards her) took as much control as he could. He convinced the family to let us stay in our home until I was born, and he let my mother take a couple of things the family wouldn't miss. 

All of my father's funds went to his 2 (much older) children who were alcoholics and addicts. The house was taken over by another family member. His clothes, his precious memorabilia and keepsakes fought over shrewn throughout the family for pawning for drugs and alcohol. 

I have his wallet, a tee shirt, and an origami frog he made. My mother has his drum, a couple of pictures, and a couple pieces of his artwork. 

In the end my mother was kicked out with no income, no home, and a 6 month old baby.

My situation may not have been as bad as some, but its hurt every day of my life that I couldnt have a little part of the man who created and loved me.

gem25,fecor1j,t3_eob76n,"I‚Äôm a legal assistant working in estate planning. The most mind boggling thing to me is that if you have a will, your loved ones have to go through Probate court proceedings in order for the state to assign your assets to recipients, even if you have had an attorney write and notarize your will. The legal fees for probate can cost tens of thousands of dollars, fees for which your surviving beneficiaries are responsible. 

Revocable Living Trusts allow your loved ones to bypass Probate proceedings by creating ancillary documents, including a pour over will. The trust directs the assets of your estate to be passed onto surviving spouses and intended beneficiaries while the pour over will instructs assets not included in the trust. 

I cannot overemphasize the importance of this post and this practice. Most people assume wills and estate planning are only for old people and I‚Äôm telling you, it‚Äôs NOT. If you‚Äôre incapacitated and you don‚Äôt have a Financial or Medical POA, a court has to appoint a conservator for you and on behalf of you. Things could decline rapidly while waiting for the courts to make decisions and something even worse can happen to you. Land? The state will take that in a second without an estate plan. Finances and accounts? Gotta instruct who you want to take care of those or the state will. Laws vary state by state, my state is a community property state, which affects asset distribution upon death. The state is not afraid to take your stuff. Make sure your loved ones are taken care of if something happens to you. Make sure you have a plan if something happens to your loved ones.

area51suicidalfunrun,fdktwbx,t1_fdjnyds,"It's actually a 360 radar, learned this because of cop radars. A good quality cop radar (which is only illegal in North Carolina and West Virginia for the continental US, and perfectly legal in other states) picks up several frequencies. You've got ""X band"" which is a camera or some type of security device usually goes off the most around super markets and big brand stores, and also detects camera within traffic lights. 
Then ""k band"" & ""Ka band"" these are the two types of radars cops use while driving around. I believe one tracks ahead of them and the other is the 360. 
Then ""laser alert"" which is of course the laser gun that they need to be stopped in order to use. They can use the above radars while stopped as well. The laser alert can also go off because of sunlight, I've personally only seen it go off for an actual radar gun a hand full of times. 

If it's legal in your state get one. A good one can be between $200-$300, there are cheaper ones that work just as well, but either way it gives you a few seconds heads up and alerts you if a cop is in the area, it can save you a lot on tickets. (K and Ka band give a couple of seconds notice and beeps more frequently the closer you are to a cop. The laser alert is possible a 1-2 second notice, literally enough time to slam your breaks and prey he doesn't go after you.) 

Cops could give you a hard time about them if they really wanted to. Some people put it smack dab in the middle of their windshield, others put it lower and more discreet. A cop may or may not ask about it when they see it but in my experience they usually don't notice it or don't comment.

My boyfriend actually got out of a speeding ticket because of his. We were driving separately and were passing a truck past the barracks. A cop happened to watch it happen and assumed we were going much faster than we were. (At most 80) my bf has a Mazda speed 3, with a shity exhaust that's been on it since he bought. The cop witnessed both of us pass in our separate cars. (Worth mentioning I drove a Taurus SHO which looks like a cop car) he hopped in a cruiser and chased us down. By the time he caught up to us, him driving extremely recklessly, we had slowed down just about to merge out of the left land for our exit. He came up on my tail extremely fast then went around me on the shoulder, almost hit me and my boyfriend and THEN threw his lights and sirens on.  When he pulled him off the road his car was half on the highway and I merged into the exit just as he threw the door open of his car into traffic. I thankfully avoided hitting him. 

Because of the radar the cop had no choice to admit that he reacted based on what he saw, that he had no type of radar to determine how fast we were going. He gave my boyfriend a ticket for a moving violation and I contacted the state over it.

nguyenerdavid,fdky2pr,t1_fdktwbx,"Good understanding of concept and terminology. For those who want more in-depth information, Vortex Radar is a great source. I've been running a V1 since I got my driver's permit; it's paid for itself ten fold. I know some people are going to say that I am a habitual speeder, but going through the great state of Texas, small towns thrive through the revenue generation of traffic enforcement. This is coming from someone who is friends with LEOs, and hey guess what, they speed, too, because we're all human.

Now, back to your comment. Radar speed enforcement is not ""360"" in the sense that you are thinking about. For an officer to acquire your speed, their radar enforcement tool (hard mounted into the vehicle or handheld), you have to be coming at the within the same axis, meaning the officer cannot acquire your speed if the equipment used is perpendicular to you. Essentially, the equipment has to be facing you for it to work but it cannot single out your vehicle like laser/LIDAR guns can. This means if you travel in a pack, chances of you being caught by radar are slim unless you are obviously way over the PSL (posted speed limit). Radar enforcement can be used while moving and stationary, and also is togglable. Most officers know that people run a radar detector and it becomes a game; wait until your prey is in a 'kill zone' and turn the radar on and turn it off and speed is acquired.

Laser speed enforcement is a different story. Like you said, laser cannot be used while in motion. And again, can only be acquired if the tool is used in the same axis. The user has to be stationary, and is usually reserved to departments with a larger budget. For one laser gun, you can purchase a lot more radar units and maintain them, too. LIDAR is sensitive and usually used in dense traffic areas, whether urban or vehicles, because you can literally single out vehicles and acquire their speed in seconds. No radar detector will save you from a direct laser hit; if you hear it, you're busted. Now, more expensive detectors have very sensitive sensors to detect laser scatter from an officer scanning across lanes of travel to get another vehicle's speed or reflection of the IR light off a vehicle's reflective surface. That buys you time to slow the heck down and hope you're not prey. The only counter to LIDAR are laser jammers, which are a discussion for another time given the legality of these units.

Not all law enforcement officers can do speed enforcement either, you have to be certified by the department to use this equipment. This certification includes estimating vehicle speed and in some states such as California, an officer can write you a ticket based on visual estimation. For states where visual estimation is not admissible in court, they visually estimate your speed first, then hit you with radar or laser to have a written lock of your speed."

2 - that definitely isnt a legal reason for a the OP to have been speeding  but it's usually left up to hte judges discretion anyway. So maybe the judge was being lenient that day...or maybe Op lives in a district where they dont make all their money off of speeding case"
Northernlighter,fdkzao2,t1_fdkf9wm,Yeah not interfering and tail gating the cop. Just cruising behind him and the cop is not on a call. But this happened more than 25 hears ago... things might have changed haha.

ncshooter426,fdlfa8g,t1_fdkf9wm,"Cops do not have the ""legal right"" to exceed the speed limit *unless* their lights and/or siren are engaged. Meaning, they have a specific reason to be moving at a higher speed than normal, and are notifying the public via the use of visual and auditory means in the pursuit of duty. So, that means:

* Cops can be cited for speeding.

* Cops can be cited for using their lights in a scenario where they are not actively policing (ie: trying to cut through traffic).

* Cops causing accidents while speeding and not lawfully engaged on the above are subject to the same rules as anyone else."

I see later that he is pulled off the side to nascar in my rear view mirror. Like literally he is in an unmarked car but you can still tell he is a cop. He is nascar people in the left lane. So I pull into the right lane. The car in front me of me is next. He does the same. and him and the next and the next and the next. Eventually the cop car was going so fast as the gaps were made for him that he caught up to someone up there and I remember passing the poor sap that got busted a while later.

takencareofbusiness,fdkjkmp,t1_fdkbtfw,"No, they don't have to be going the same speed as you to track you on Radar. Their speed is not a factor if they are using Radar. The only time their speed would be relevant is if they are pacing you. And that's not even completely necessary. An officer who is Radar certified can watch your speed and estimate your speed and stop and write you a ticket, without using Radar or pacing you. Based on their training and experience in the estimation of speed they are able to write the ticket. Officers are supposed to estimate the drivers speed visually and then use the radar to confirm their speed."
takencareofbusiness,fdkkrry,t1_fdkcln7,"Alot of that depends on what the officer is doing. If they are a traffic cop you'll probably get stopped and written a ticket. If they are on the way to a call for service, you'll probably get a pass.

Canadian_Infidel,fdkyph7,t1_fdkcln7,You got lucky. I have learned that in reality a cop can say you were going any speed they want and there is nothing you can do.
takencareofbusiness,fdkkdqf,t1_fdkdx1h,"If you are following an officer at a high rate of speed,  the officer may pull them over for following too close, not necessarily for speed. 

Also , many officers use the technique of driving 5 mph under the speed limit. When a car pulls up beside them and won't pass, there is usually a reason the driver won't pass. The officer may slow down to get behind that vehicle to run the tag and the registered owner to see if there is a reason to pull them over."

VA used to use a non-radar system called VASCAR to catch speeders. The trooper would visually track your travel time between two marked points, usually wide white lines painted on the highway perpendicular to the direction of travel, and calculate your average speed based on the known distance between the two points. Some places had a spotter in an airplane to time the car and radio down to a trooper on the ground."

Cop gives you the keys to a sports car and tells you to have fun with it, then pulls you over for speeding? Still not entrapment, you're under no obligation to drive beyond the rules of the road.

Entrapment only occurs when the police, or one of their agents, deliberately engineers a situation where you would commit a crime you weren't already predisposed to, breaking down your resistance to the act through trickery or duress.

To the people calling the cops, what is happening to them is the most important thing ever, so it matters if the cops come fast. Most of the times cops are called to domestic disputes. And domestic disputes can get really dangerous really fast, they escalate. But on the initial call it just seems like an argument. So the cops aren‚Äôt allowed to do lights and sirens on there way to that call, but that‚Äôs a call where someone could get hurt and time does matter.

If the cop even just mis-remembers something you said it can cause trouble. It's best to wait for a lawyer for even basic interactions or when you know you're fully innocent or were just a witness. Obviously there are times like a traffic stop where that'll cause more trouble, but the rule is essentially: say the legal minimum to save yourself any trouble.

There's also merrit to your statement about not being required to protect us, there was a supreme Court ruling that stated cops are not obligated to put themselves in harm's way for the sake of an individual. It applied to a domestic violence case IIRC where LEOs weren't comfortable confronting a dangerous suspect so they didn't enter the house to protect the victim soon enough to do anything. They have an obligation to protect the public at large, but at an interpersonal level they can get away with no busting in your house before you get stabbed, so yeah realistically the only person who has to save you, is you."

reflected_shadows,fdkep6h,t1_fdkdhjg,"I mean, most people don't do that when they see the cop car or police license plate, right? Most people see the car, slow down at a distance away, and never get pulled over. 

Where I live, things are complicated because we have a grey area ""Slow Poke"" law; police can ticket you for going too slow in the left lane.

What I see a lot of is lane closures up ahead - and ""that guy"" pulls into said lane and speeds up to try to get ahead of the line and butt in and some dummy always lets a chain of them in."
c0d3e,fdkgskt,t1_fdkep6h,"""That Guy""

It causes a world of issues because no one likes change and likes being assholes."

The ones I'm familiar with don't always ""pull up"" information, as in every passing car gets sent to the officer's mobile computer. I know some of them do though. Ours just queries passing cars, and cross-references the plate with a database which contains warrants and stolen vehicles. It doesn't even alert us of suspended drivers or expired plates. The only time anything ever pops up is when there's a match for a warrant or stolen vehicle, there's a ""DING DING"", and the ALPR sends a message to my computer with the return. You can find so many stolen vehicles just by making rounds in the Walmart parking lot at 2 AM, it's great."

Waiting in a way that makes the DMV sound delightful. 

in 21 states, wrongfully convicted individuals are not compensated for being wrongfully convicted and all that entails. Even if you get let out the next day, chances are its had a devastating impact on your life and future. After 40 years, its *been* your life and stolen your future.

I was going the speed limit, I hadn't recently changed lanes, pretty much anything I could think of, I had done right to my knowledge. 

He then says he pulled me over because I didn't signal when I turned into the parking lot, which I only turned into because he had his lights on. Basically it sounds like he only pulled me over because I had out of state plates and he was trying to find anything wrong he could use against me."

Jordzy2j,fdk9qhx,t3_elr3gq,By your post I assume that every police force on the planet has these? Be specific.
Plummyr,fdlolg2,t1_fdk9qhx,"No. Each department and agency is different inside the united states. Each county can have, for example, two police department, one sheriff department. There's also state and federal agencies, like highway patrol and wildlife and parks rangers. So, for this example anyway, 1 county with 5 agencies. There's a good chance every single one of them are going to have different radar devices because they all have different budgets to go off of. Some might not even have radar because it's too expensive.

There's still the old method of getting a distance and timing an object as it passes through, such as the distance between two utility poles and using a stopwatch. So just because an agency doesn't have radar, doesn't mean you can't get pulled over for speeding. Officers can also pull you over and cite you for basic speed law. Which means you went too fast to safely drive for conditions. Its pretty obvious by a trained eye when someone is doing 100 in a 65, or 50 in a twenty. You might not get it on radar, but you know just by observing it that it's going extremely over the limit."

LIDAR is superior to RADAR as it can target individual vehicles instead of having to assume which vehicle out of a group was the one that returned the speed to your reader. 

Another advantage to LIDAR, since it a pin point use device it defeats radar detectors, while the driver would get a notification lidar is in the area, it would already be too late, where as with radar if you are not in direct line of sight of the officer you have a chance to slow down before detection."

MightyMille,fdrsi9b,t1_fdhx0xr,"Here's another fun fact, not regarding cats though: Most human babies cannot have lactose intolerance since breastmilk contains lactose. 

What human babies however can have trouble digesting is milk protein from cows milk, which is the reason some babies also gradually loose the ability to digest lactose over time, since they are not continually including diary products to their diet. 

In order to keep the ability to digest lactose, you have to introduce diary from an early age, around the 9 month mark - otherwise the body will just stop producing lactase gradually over time (lactase is the enzyme that breaks down lactose)."

koschbosch,fdjflg8,t1_fdj66d0,"Peace lily isn't a real lily. They are still toxic but not near as bad as real lilies. Peace lilies (Spathiphyllum sp.) along with a number of other plants on the list are toxic by way of calcium oxalate which typically causes irritation to their mouth before ingesting enough to cause permanent damage. Real lilies (Lilium sp., Liliacaea) are pretty much guaranteed organ damage and possible death with small amounts. Poinsettias are another that is toxic but unlikely to be fatal because they typically won't chew enough to ingest a toxic amount- poinsettias release a nasty latex (yup, latex!) that is gooey and burns. I've had numerous but minor chemical irritation on my hands when I was pruning poinsettias in a production greenouse. You're supposed to wear gloves but makes much more difficult. In any case, if you have a peace lily I would say you can let your cats around it but keep an eye on them and if they start munching you'll know to keep it away, but that munching won't be a major deal. Real lilies though, never allow them near it, a quick bite could mean major damage. Keep in mind day lilies, easter lilies, and asiatic lilies are also often used in floral arrangements, so know what flowers are in them! Also daffodil/Narcissus and tulips."

""Poinsettias are not poisonous if consumed by¬†pets¬†either, says Steven Hansen, director of the¬†ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center¬†and a veterinary toxicologist. But they can irritate a cat or dog if eaten in large quantities. So if Fido or Fluffy does chow down on the showy red shrub and shows signs of lethargy, drools, vomits or has diarrhea, don‚Äôt feed them for 24 hours, and give them water until the effects subside. If their side effects don‚Äôt stop, go to the veterinarian.

Hansen does caution that all types of lilies‚Äîespecially the Easter and tiger lilies popular during the holidays‚Äîare extremely poisonous to cats, but not dogs. The number of reported feline deaths is low, but consuming the lily can cause¬†kidney failure¬†if the cat is not taken to a hospital immediately"""

TurKoise,fe6fiuj,t1_fe3ud5u,"Two ways that I know of on mobile:

1) in the Youtube app, create a playlist with the song(s) that you want to loop/repeat. From Library, open the playlist and beneath the video you should see a ‚Äúrepeat/loop‚Äù button right next to the ‚Äúshuffle‚Äù button.

2) Copy and paste the url of the YouTube video into [Listen on Repeat](https://listenonrepeat.com/?v=Y5WQ6gF-8vA&s=0&e=38#Wel_e_to_ListenOnRepeat). It‚Äôs a free site specifically for putting YouTube videos on repeat. It works in any browser on mobile and desktop."

llort-egdirb,fe59ear,t1_fe52zhb,"I‚Äôm not an expert, but I would bet on it requiring data each time. I think every time the video replays, new information in the program has to go through to load the replay data. On the other hand, it‚Äôs probably not much data since the entire page isn‚Äôt reloading. 

This is just based on how the video sometimes lags even when going back in the video where the information has supposedly already been loaded and because when the video loops, the grey bar resets."
llort-egdirb,fe4dwnf,t1_fe4de0j,"I always though right clicking was done by pressing and holding, but if that doesn‚Äôt work and you‚Äôre really invested, you can go to youtubeloop.net and enter the url. I think you can even loop sections of videos instead of being limited to the whole thing. The website has more explanation on how that stuff works though."

Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's what I used to do until it stopped working, then I switched over to NewPipe app and Vanced app, as others have suggested.  Those are way better methods, imo.  I'm not sure what you can do if using Apple."
pants_full_of_pants,fe5s7hb,t1_fe486eb,If you have YouTube red the regular app still allows it. I have it because I use Google Music instead of Spotify.

civ-e,fe5aks9,t1_fe59ear,yeah my hunch is similar to what you said too.  thanks!
DontBeABadPerson,fe5obub,t1_fe59ear,"Nope. In my experience 99% of the time youtube caches the entire video once it's loaded. The lag you're talking about happens even if you don't have an internet connection, so it's not really ""downloading"" the video again from the internet. Of course this is only valid in videos that are a few minutes long, maybe 8-10 minutes max"
kieran3296,fe5erhe,t1_fe4aomx,"If youre on IOS Cercube 5 works on non-jailbroken devices, only issue is you have to do some VPN trickery to stop apple revoking the certificates every 3-4 days"

Around 9 am they were sound asleep.  I remembered a story I heard about George HW Bush using ""Panama"" by Van Halen on repeat to make Noreaga leave his house and face authorities.  

I had bought a surround system for my room from a coworker a few years earlier.  I plugged my laptop into it, and found ""Panama"" by Van Halen on YouTube.  I had to look up how to do it, but I made it play in a loop.

Around 10:30 I turned it off.  I gave them time to fall back asleep.  Around 11:00 I blasted it again ""She's running..."".  My stepmom was dying laughing.  She didn't even mind the annoyance because it was so simplistically devilish.

For fries: turn your oven broiler on low, scatter fries over foil, place under broiler. For thick fries turn them ... 2-3 minutes they crisp up a bit.

For pizza: turn your oven on bake, place on foil, bottom rack ... when cheese begins to melt, take them out."

FuzzyMonkey95,fdnrw64,t1_fdnprxh,"I do something similar when I warm up pizza, I bake it until it is heated up, then I broil it for a minute or two to crisp it up. Works especially well for pepperoni pizza since the pepperoni gets all crispy again."

I guess it's for the same reason you don't have electric kettles: the fact you use 110v instead of 230v. The lower voltage makes it impractical to use devices that use a lot of power because the current would be too high. Deep fryers use similar amounts of power as electric kettles (usually 2000-3000 watt) and both would require a custom outlet in a typical US home. And although you can make a lower-power electric kettle (that takes forever to boil water) a low-power fryer would be quite useless as it wouldn't be able to keep temperature once you toss in frozen snacks."

A recent filmmaker of the BBC (Panorama or something similar) has been strongly critical of the BBC in 2019. Saying films he and others made which were critical of the Tory party policies had been heavily edited by the BBC or simply not shown at all.

I still read the NYTs, WAPO, the BBC and look at the headlines on CNN but, like many people I know, I am wondering about the wisdom of doing even that.

So, although I know every medication is different, I'm going to share my experience so that you don't try this shit and go through the same hell I did.

First thing you should know, modern anti-depressants are designed to be difficult to overdose on. They can still kill you, but they are MUCH more likely to cause extreme discomfort, pain, and possible long term damage that you'll have to add to the list of shit that's wrong with you. I was fortunate enough to have no such long term side effects. That said, I did not get off easy.

So, first thing that happens after you take the 40 something pills to overdose is you have what I can only describe as a post-suicide clarity. You are no longer worrying about life because, well, you're pretty sure its over. Enjoy that feeling while it lasts, it is the most relaxed I've felt in over a decade, and it's all downhill from there.

Now that you are thinking more clearly, you will probably do what I did and call 911 (Maybe so they can save you, maybe because you figure dying in your parents house would be a bit too traumatic for them). So, the ambulance comes and you get in. 

At this point, you feel you have to apologize to the EMTs, who you know are working their asses off trying to keep your dumb ass alive, and how traumatic this might be for them. They ask you a few questions, try to cheer you up a bit, they're nice.

You get into the hospital, and instead of pumping your stomach, what they do is have you drink charcoal. Now, when you hear ""get him a cup of charcoal"", you might think that's medical short term for something... nope. They get you a disposable cup filled with what I can only describe as a THICK charcoal smoothy... like, if you had a straw it would stand up in it thick. You've got to drink the charcoal... so, fighting your gag reflex, you empty a cup of fireplace sweepings into your mouth and try your best to swallow it. It tastes worse than you think, and is like trying to drink mud. You somehow manage to get it down... then, they hand you another one...

After you finish your two cups of charcoal, you get hooked up to an IV and wheeled into a ward. Now, you are not feeling so good after your two cups of black death, and the effects of the drugs are starting to kick in. While your parents hug/smack you, you do your best to apologize to them, as you don't want things left badly when you die (which you are probably still fairly confident of). 

So, eventually you are just lying there, and you start to feel the drugs kick in. The charcoal of course has lessened the effects somewhat, but you start to feel restless... like you need to move. This is difficult considering you're in a hospital bed with an IV, so you resort to turning your head back and forth every few seconds like a crazy person.

You start to feel more and more tense, at which point your heart rate starts to climb. They park a crash cart outside your room and your moms crying as every muscle in your body starts to flex. Now, you weren't warned about this, so your fingernails are starting to literally dig into your skin are you get a full body cramp.

This lasts for about... 6-8 hours. You go from ""feeling the burn"" to feeling like you've run two marathons and can't stop running. Your heart rate is sitting up at around 300, and they can't really give you much to help because the reason you are in here in the first place is too much medication... so no pain killers, and a little muscle relaxant. 

So, once your body gradually starts to relax, you would think things are over... nope. Your body has been flexing its muscles for 8 hours straight. Your body is sore, and you have difficulty sitting up, let alone walking. You try to piss in a container they give you, a good deal of which ends up on you because, well, you're not in the best condition at the moment. 

You are instructed to try and sleep, which you manage to a certain extent, your parents trying to sleep in hospital chairs next to you (less successfully). You feel horrible, both due to the physical strain you've just been through, and for frightening the hell out of your parents. Over the next few hours people visit, it's extremely awkward, and you spend the next few days unable to walk (and occasionally pissing on yourself). You don't fully recover for 3-4 weeks.

Now that that is over, things aren't back to normal, because you've single handedly given your parents the worst day of their life, and they are going to watch you like a hawk (understandably). You get to watch people blame themselves for what happened, have literal break downs, and all because of your own actions. 

tl;dr: Suicide by anti-depressants is probably one of the most painful things you'll ever experience, and it puts your family and loved ones through hell. Go to a doctor, get help, check yourself into a mental hospital. It is a lot easier to get help then to put yourself, and everyone else, through that shit."

Granted, they got worse before better. But I survived some catastrophic shit, and it had an effect. I'm actually living now.

dorkphoenyx,fdqtwli,t1_fdqt1g3,Thank you. That's really kind and empowering to hear.
ElphabaTheGood,fdqv04a,t1_fdqrcwn,"I kind of see it as change through loving self acceptance. If you have a trait or action that causes you harm in some way, you have to accept it before you change it. 

For example, if I‚Äôm late to work every morning and keep beating myself up about it and/or self-castigating to ‚Äújust be quicker in the morning,‚Äù it probably won‚Äôt change. However, if I accept that I am late every morning and think about it with self-love, I start to see options. ‚ÄúAs it is, I am late every morning, and I cannot change that by ‚Äògoing quicker‚Äô b/c despite my best efforts, ‚Äògoing quicker‚Äô never happens. Therefore, I can try to change something else. Make lunch the night before? Limit wardrobe choices? Set the alarm earlier?...‚Äù It helps change actions as well as feelings and thoughts about yourself. 

Like I said, I am in no way an expert. Wikipedia would probably give a better definition, a psychologist could probably give a better example, and a therapist could utilize it better, and I am none of those things. But that‚Äôs the kind of mindset change that made a huge difference in my life, so I wanted to answer from my experience :-)."
my_second_choice,fdqz0k7,t1_fdqrcwn,"I‚Äôm no authority on the matter, but I personally see it as making a deliberate (often difficult) choice to accept current circumstances as a ‚Äòplace to start‚Äô. As part of this we should shift our focus away from things we cannot change and onto things we do have control over. 

As much grief as they get, I feel that 12 step programs are a good example here. The steps often start something like:
* Accept there are things we don‚Äôt control. 
* Accept someone or something else is in control of those things. 
* Be at peace with not having control over those things.
* Take inventory of what we do have control over.
* ...

For instance, I‚Äôve never heard of anyone claiming to be a ‚Äòformer‚Äô alcoholic. Instead everyone I‚Äôve spoken with has stated they currently are and will always be  a‚Äòrecovering alcoholic‚Äô, presumably because they have ‚Äòradically accepted‚Äô themselves, their affliction, and their willingness to move forward. 

If you haven‚Äôt read it, I recommend ‚ÄúWho Moved My Cheese‚Äù by Spencer Johnson

From: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/pieces-mind/201207/radical-acceptance

> Radical acceptance is about accepting life on life‚Äôs terms and not resisting what you cannot or choose not to change. Radical acceptance is about saying yes to life, just as it is.

> Radical acceptance is a skill that requires practice. The ability to accept that traffic is heavy, that it‚Äôs raining on the day you wanted to go to the beach, and that your friend cancels when you had plans to spend the day together is important for coping well and living a more contented life. When you practice acceptance, you are still disappointed, sad, and perhaps fearful in such situations, but you don‚Äôt add the pain of non-acceptance to those emotions and make things worse. Practicing acceptance in these situations also helps you prepare for more difficult circumstances."
Calligraphie,fdr4umz,t1_fdqrcwn,"Not the same person as above, but...

Have you heard of the Serenity Prayer? ""Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."" It's kind of the same concept. Sometimes crummy things happen (or are done by us or other people), and the easiest way to deal with them is to accept that they happened and see where you can go from there; avoiding the pain of crummy things just leads to more pain.

There's a really awesome book on the subject by Tara Brach!"

dorkphoenyx,fdrooj1,t1_fdrddnd,"Thank you! I appreciate your comment.

I actually took that as quite a compliment. Honestly, during some periods in my life, the goal was simply to survive. ""When I chose to life, there was no joy - it's just a line I crossed"". That lyric is from a Dar Williams song called 'After All', and it's kind of my anthem."
ElphabaTheGood,fdruoll,t1_fdqz17i,"Absolutely! It made my life happier (or at least my understanding of it did,) so I hope it positively impacts you, as well :-)."
ElphabaTheGood,fdrum8s,t1_fdr9dvm,"I don‚Äôt know, maybe acceptance in that case means accepting you‚Äôre apathetic, but since you know doing nothing b/c you feel nothing is unhealthy, you take steps to become more healthy, like going to a therapist, working out, being in nature, eating healthy, etc...  

If such a person denies their apathy, maybe they‚Äôd just keep getting mad at themselves for not doing things bc they don‚Äôt care, but feeling like they ‚Äúshould‚Äù be doing those things. In contrast, maybe if that person accepted their apathy, they‚Äôd know interest/passion wasn‚Äôt going to be a motivator, so they need to do things for other reasons, like gradual steps toward better mental health. 

It also has a lot to do with being gentle and forgiving of yourself. If a person has depression and it is hard for them to get out of bed, it is an achievement to get out of bed! It often can be disheartening b/c they might compare themselves w others who appear to be accomplishing more things, but loving yourself for doing the best you can on any day is crucial, even if ‚Äúthe best you can‚Äù isn‚Äôt what you might have wanted."

area51suicidalfunrun,fdqqv27,t1_fdqju3v,"I remember when I attempted to voluntarily committed myself, though I didn't have any access to pain meds at the time. I was at work in a highrise construction site having a major panic attack/mental breakdown. I got myself out of there before I could throw myself off the building. 

Boyfriend had to call my boss to explain that I was leaving. Pretty sure boss called my dad cus before I could even get home my mom was calling me to find out what happened. Waited till the following morning to go in. Got turned away because I wasn't a risk at that moment to myself or others with instructions to seek help and a list of doctors they suggested seeing. 

Took two weeks off work and went back. Working all the time made me too tired to wake up for doctors appointments. Nothing like unloading all your issues to a therapist and then having them turn around and dump you as a patient. (I worked nights still and would get mandatory OT, so some nights I wouldn't get home till 1 am or later) It was a physical job so more often than not I'd sleep through an alarm.

I've sense left that job and my bf is determined to not have me go back. It was a great job with benefits and high pay but left you with very little time for life or yourself.  I never understood the whole ""money can't buy happiness"" sentiment until I worked at that job. 

Doing a lot better now, almost a year from the hospital incident. I no longer am seeking professional help but getting back into my hobbies and rediscovering myself as a person helps a lot. But I also know that this wasn't an isolated incident because I've on and off suffered from depression.

I had to quit or they might find my body hanging from a ceiling. I felt like a failure and I was drowning. I wanted out so bad. It didn't help that my boss didn't believe I was depressed because I was functioning well. When I quit, my body shut down and I slept straight for 20+ hours. My recovery was slow probably because I didn't go see a psychiatrist or counselor. I'm in a better place now."

Overdosing on pills isnt easy in the slightest, last year at around this time I took a bottle of advil and three boxes worth of sleeping pills, along with the anti depressants I had been taking. It took almost an hour before I noticed anything happening, which was the most calm hour of my life. I was sitting on a couch in the living room of my place and that entire time I had accepted that I was going to fall asleep and die there. After that hour I felt really sick and dizzy, so I tried to stand up and couldn't. I fell down immediately and dragged myself by my hands to the bathroom where I threw up a bunch of the advil luckily. 

At that point I knew I wasn't going to die from this like I wanted to and called an ambulance. I dont remember any of the call and only have vague memories of a lot of that night but my room mate came with me and told me afterwards what happened. All I remember about that night was I was in a hospital bed and I was in the worst pain of my life. 

From what my roommate told me, once we got to the hospital they asked him a bunch of questions about what I had taken, if there was any alcohol involved and if I had done cocaine. Apparently they thought I had overdosed on crack because I couldn't control my jaw. I was constantly looking like I was chewing and grating my teeth. According to my roommate all I could say was that I took sleeping pills and that I had an empty box of them in my hand until they took it from me. 

I dont know if they gave anything to me or what else they did. I woke up two days later according to the doctor's and I had ivs, breathing tubes and needle marks in my arms from all they did to save me. They told me afterwards that occasionally I mumbled ""sorry"" in my sleep, which I believe because I felt like I was in a fever dream and wanted to apologize to everyone I was going to leave behind by dying. 

After that they transferred me to a mental health ward for three weeks until they could verify that I wasnt going to try killing myself again. 

*TL;DR* trying to overdose on over the counter pills was one of the worst experiences of my life. Dont think that taking pills is the easy way out."

After an hour, I started to feel BAD. Like ""the world is ending and I also need to throw up"" bad. After I checked the pills and called poison control to verify I wouldn't die, I went home and instantly went to sleep.

I felt a little less bad for the next few days but definitely got the tensing part of it."

jackaroniandcheese,fdqu6p3,t1_fdqqdos,I was just reading about this! It saved me from possibly dying because I was considering psychedelics.
invaderben123,fdqxgfn,t3_emqvvk,"Back when I was in the army I tried taking an entire bottle(100 pills) of Tylenol. I wrote a note that simply said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù and went to sleep thinking that I wouldn‚Äôt wake up. I did. Then I went on a three mile run. I didn‚Äôt make it the whole three miles due to stomach cramps. My squad leader was pissed at me for making him look bad. I was equally pissed because I was still alive and in pain so I yelled at him that I took Tylenol in an effort to kill myself. That kicked off the worst weeks of my time in the service. 

First I was taking to the base medical facility where they took vitals and put me on an IV. I was given a plastic basin to throw up in which I did a lot. Then I was loaded into an ambulance and taken to the nearest Army hospital ( I was stationed in Korea at the time so the hospital was in Seoul I was in Dongducheon.) 

Once at the hospital I was taken to the intensive care unit and they started monitoring me to see if my liver was going to make it. I love as visited by my squad leader my platoon sergeant and company commander and well as the chaplain and division commander.  None of them (with the exception of the chaplain) had anything nice to say as in their eyes I was a coward who didn‚Äôt belong in their Army. 

After about five days I had recovered enough to be moved from the ICU to the mental health ward. I was on total lock down and had to be observed constantly doing everything from ironing my uniform and shining my shoes to showering and shaving. I spent about a week there until they thought I was well enough to be sent back to my unit. 

When I got back to my unit I was treated like I was a piece of shit who didn‚Äôt belong there. My platoon sergeant and squad leader were replaced because ‚Äúthey should know what‚Äôs going on in their soldier‚Äôs life‚Äù I seriously considered trying another way until I started seeing the Army therapist. She helped me talk things through and I was able to get through the last few months I was in Korea. 

When I left I flew into Dallas and was met by family and I broke down because with them I didn‚Äôt feel like I had to hide my feelings as much. 

I am in a much better place now and have been off antidepressants for five years. But I still get days where I feel worthless."

c3h8pro,fdr2u3p,t3_emqvvk,"I've been a paramedic since 1975. I worked in NYC for almost my entire career retiring in 2007. I have seen every possible combination of methods and technique to kill oneself imaginable. I want people to understand what I deal with when you decide it's time to exit. First and foremost I don't care why you want to die, it isn't my problem. I'm not uncaring but I can't fix social issues or the fact that your parents are narcissists that is way past my pay grade. I have one simple job and that is to keep your life processes going till we can get you safe from danger. Hopefully in a nice clean hospital where people can address more then your physical needs. If I know what you ingested like the OP example I can get guidance from my online physician or poison control. I can put a naso-gastric tube in your stomach and fill you up with that lovely charcoal slurry and possibly suck it back out. I will place an I.V. line to give you medication like everybody's favorite Narcan. I can also give that drug via a shot or wifes in your nostril, if you're dehydrated or in the stages of shut down and your veins are hiding I will drill into your bone marrow to infuse you. Yes, I drill that hole without the benefit of pain control. Narcan can only do so much, I will titrate its dose to the effect I seek. Usually I need to raise your respiratory rate so I give doses via whatever route till I get what I need from your body, if you like your fentanyl I may decide to infuse Narcan as a drip medication giving a continuous amount to keep the effect where I need it. You may buy a breathing tube, you won't be talking so no big deal. Someone may need to ""bag"" you, this is when a BVM or bag valve mask is used to push room air with added oxygen mostly into your lungs via the tube or just to assist your breathing. The goal being to keep the level of oxygen in your circulating blood up so your vital tissues dont die. In the field we don't process blood work but it's very likely that lactic acid is building in your muscles, when the fibers contract the tissue tires and you get that burnt up feeling. Blood work will show if this situation needs to be corrected, contracted and locked muscles can be painful. If contractions become dangerous you maybe restrained for safety, soft restraints are preferred. I don't want you further injured so soft cuffs are just like a padded loop 3"" wide. If we feel you are still dangerous to yourself or others you may spend some time in those wrist and ankle straps plus the seatbelts of our streacher. It really is in your best interest to relax, you aren't going to beat the strap in a tug o' war. Prepair yourself that some facilities may put you in a ""Turtle suit"", your completely nude and the suit is basically a tube dress made of a reinforced moving blanket. No buttons or zips, just velcro closures. The ER will take over the treatment of your OD or injurys, you may need another intervention or different medications. Injured tissue will be sutured and bones set, some medications people OD on could require dialysis to get removed from your system. As your health becomes less tenuous the talking will begin and social work will visit sometimes with psychological  service providers. It's very likely you will be transferred to inpatient care and continue your care from there. 

The other route.

If the condition becomes grave everything will be done to try and correct each symptom as they become evident. No one wants you to die, we all take it personally if you do. We may not be the best communicators but trust me no one wants to see someone pass, all the promise and potential goes to waste. That hurts more then anything. 

A code will be called, your airway, breathing and circulation will be supported. A ET tube or something similar will be inserted to protect your airway from the inevitable vomiting that will occur. If that vomit reaches the lung the acid damages the tissue and the debris becomes pneumonia. Infection sets in and all sorts or problems come up. Breathing is supplemented with the BVM and oxygen til a ventilator can be set up. The oxygenated blood gets moved by the heart and if needed the EKG gets corrected with meds or shocks depending on the issue. When these measures are exhausted you'll be pronounced dead. 

I've lost way too many over the years and I can tell you I still see them all. I have tried to talk people off bridges and failed. I have watched a young man push a hunting knife into his chest, he had to wiggle the blade to get it past his rib. That is a depth of depression I pray no one ever experiences. I frequently take the lead on suicides so the younger providers can bow out when it becomes too much. The effects on the provider are very real as are the effects on bystanders and the person who finds the decedent. 

Please ask for help. You are no less of a person for being sad, infact the bravest people I know are the ones who lean on others when they need too."

acornstu,fdqr8cy,t3_emqvvk,"Can confirm.  Not so much on the drugs but i had my ankle bolted back together and shattered my heel about 10 years ago.

It took me several days to figure out that the soul crushing pain in my foot was a cramp...  it felt like someone hit my foot with a 40 pound sledgehammer and the used a machete to chop it up.

It hurt like hell for 3 days in the hospital but i was strung out on god knows what and pumping the morphine button like a nervous habbit non stop.  It was okay there though with all the meds and watching the Chilean miners all get rescued.  

But an hour after i left the hospital the meds were basically useless.  I spent the next 3 DAYS laying in a recliner hyperventilating until I'd pass out for a few minutes and do it again.  Over and over and over.  It felt like i was tortured for 1,000 years and anytime i get the slightest cramp i freak the fuck out until it's over still.

Like i said that was a decade ago.  I'm 34 and that was hands down the worst pain I've ever been in.  That includes a motorcycle crash where i slid down a cement ditch with a tshirt and jeans on.  Stitches in the head, road rash puncture wounds, several fingernails ripped off, and a torn shoulder that will never be right again is a laughable scratch compared to that foot cramp and all those assholes gave me was ib prophen since i had no insurance.

I would take OPs word for it.  You DO NOT want to go through that hell.

And after losing 2 of my best friends to suicide i will of course ask yall not to do it.  People you barely know will cry themselves to sleep at night for years think they should have done more.  Or regret things they may have said or done.  They'll carry that pain and doubt forever.

And ffs if you do decide to check out early at least make it look like a fucking accident or run away leaving a note saying you need to ""find yourself"" or some bullshit.  Then wonder into the jungle and off yourself.  Everyone will be really pissed but it's NOTHING compared to the hell you will cause your friends and family if you just end it basically right in front of them.  I promise you this.  I've been through it 2 times (so far...) so I'm well aware of it.

If you are well and done at least have the courtesy to save everyone you love some heartache.  Make it look like an accident or disappear."

EDIT:


Apologies if my comment was insensitive, I‚Äôve been ill and I think I posted that when I was still pretty sicky and wished to contribute but in hindsight didn‚Äôt have the time to do so properly. 

I should say that I am a mental health professional and have several friends/family members with mental health issues that I support with to varying degrees. So whilst I made a blanket statement and have never personally been suicidal I am not ignorant of the issues at hand. I work with well over half of my patients on ways to manage suicidal thoughts and what to do if it gets too much.

In response to the people who have no one around them considering suicide; I do appreciate where you‚Äôve come from with that but I also disagree. It is saddening that asking someone to think of the consequences can result in them feeling unimportant. Please know that complete strangers can be affected by a suicide e.g. the paramedics. I still remember every little thing about a man I met just once in a previous job who ended his life shortly after I left him. Without going into details it was tragic and upsetting, mostly because I acknowledge the extreme suffering he experienced in his lifetime. I don‚Äôt want to sound like I‚Äôm making people feel selfish talking about suicide as I‚Äôd like to think I have more tact than that and I know I‚Äôm good at my job. 

I‚Äôve rambled and have lacked eloquence in trying to clarify my point here, I should have reread the responses again midway through but I‚Äôm tired. Hope I‚Äôve not come across as a total insensitive idiot.."

ImSadPleaseSendBoobs,fdql6yf,t1_fdqk2dv,"Why do we love blanket statements so much?

Firstly, lets establish that a suicidal persons pain is likely very very severe. 

Next, the quantity of people the suicidal person knows (is close to) varies as well as how the event would affect them varies.

If you are a 16 year old who's depressed and try to kill yourself, then there's a good chance (let's say 99% even though that's just a guess) you'd be giving your parents a great amount of their own depression.

What if we're older though? What if our parents are dead/old enough to be fairly absent from our lives or maybe we're younger still but they never were present. Who are we hurting then? If we have no S/O, no friends, then there is nobody to transfer that pain to when we die."
gena_st,fdqor31,t1_fdql6yf,"I agree with you, especially that first bit. People often say ‚Äúsuicide is selfish,‚Äù but I think they have no idea the sort of pain the suicidal person is experiencing. Saying it would hurt person B for person A to end their life really belittles person A‚Äôs suffering. It‚Äôs like saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care how awful your life is, you have to be here for *MEE*.‚Äù Who‚Äôs selfish now?

To clarify, I‚Äôm not trying to argue for suicide being good. It‚Äôs just, I‚Äôve been there, and those sorts of statements hurt more than they helped. Like, I‚Äôm so unimportant that my suffering doesn‚Äôt matter next to other people‚Äôs potential sadness.

It really takes a lot more than a blanket statement to deal with something as serious as suicidalism. To really help, you need to get to the root of the problem and offer some sort of hope. Even if not, ‚ÄúWe can fix this,‚Äù at least, ‚ÄúWe can make this bearable, and you won‚Äôt have to do it alone.‚Äù

Fun fact: the muscle flexing thing you described is also how people die from nerve gas. The difference is that their lungs also tense up, so they actually die of suffocation while their body gets damn near saturated with lactic acid.

Your experience sounds absolutely horrible and I know it‚Äôs hard but we‚Äôre all glad that you made it through. /r/depression and /r/suicidewatch would love to hear from you if you haven‚Äôt been there already.

HauntedButtCheeks,fdqs5qc,t3_emqvvk,"Thank you for sharing the reality you experienced. Several people in my life struggle with depression and suicidal ideation, and understanding the truth of what happens when you try to commit suicide (suffering, pain, trauma of loved ones, funeral costs, court case costs, etc.) has prevented them from a death they didn't really want. 

If anyone reading this is struggling with thoughts of suicide, don't give in to the lies your brain chemistry is telling you! You are loved & needed, & people do care about you."
Lady_Lavelle,fdqsjlx,t3_emqvvk,"I was suicidal once. For a long time. For months I was so close to ending it all. This is after years and years of complete misery after so many tragic instances in my life.

But one thing that has helped massively - as I'll never be in that place again - is that all the thoughts in my head that led me into that pit of despair were just that, thoughts. You're too attached to your inner monologue. But it's not really you. 

Learn to separate yourself from the incessant narrative that wants to talk about and feel everything. You're not the thoughts in your head, you're the deeper awareness that observes them.

I highly recommend a book called The Untethered Soul by Michael Singer. Please read this. I know how long the road to recovery is. It may take years for you as it did me. But do it. Take back ownership of yourself and live your life with heart."

Sydney142,fdqwi16,t3_emqvvk,"I once had a fight with a friend and when I got home just started chugging a bottle of vodka. My roommate was home (pretty luckily) and very concerned, especially when I started to threaten to take the whole bottle of Prozac I had since I was on it at the time for my OCD. 

I ended up just getting super drunk and passing out before anything happened and then she brought me to the ER with a BAC of .35, after which I was briefly committed. 

Every once in a while I still think maybe I should have gone through with it and taken the pills. Even though I‚Äôm happier for the most part now, it‚Äôs almost like I know I‚Äôll never try it again, and when I have those periods when I‚Äôm feeling down I just think it‚Äôd be easier if I‚Äôd just done it and not have to be dealing with whatever I‚Äôm dealing with now.

1001tigers,fdraga6,t1_fdr8gq3,"Original Post text that was removed by the dumbfuck mods.

Figured I should start with why people should know this before I get downvoted to hell.
The way I see it, the easier suicide appears to be, the more likely is an individual is to see it as a viable option. I figure if more people know it isn't the ""slowly drift off to sleep forever"" kind of thing people see in movies, hear in songs, they might not be as likely to give it a try.
So, although I know every medication is different, I'm going to share my experience so that you don't try this shit and go through the same hell I did.
First thing you should know, modern anti-depressants are designed to be difficult to overdose on. They can still kill you, but they are MUCH more likely to cause extreme discomfort, pain, and possible long term damage that you'll have to add to the list of shit that's wrong with you. I was fortunate enough to have no such long term side effects. That said, I did not get off easy.
So, first thing that happens after you take the 40 something pills to overdose is you have what I can only describe as a post-suicide clarity. You are no longer worrying about life because, well, you're pretty sure its over. Enjoy that feeling while it lasts, it is the most relaxed I've felt in over a decade, and it's all downhill from there.
Now that you are thinking more clearly, you will probably do what I did and call 911 (Maybe so they can save you, maybe because you figure dying in your parents house would be a bit too traumatic for them). So, the ambulance comes and you get in.
At this point, you feel you have to apologize to the EMTs, who you know are working their asses off trying to keep your dumb ass alive, and how traumatic this might be for them. They ask you a few questions, try to cheer you up a bit, they're nice.
You get into the hospital, and instead of pumping your stomach, what they do is have you drink charcoal. Now, when you hear ""get him a cup of charcoal"", you might think that's medical short term for something... nope. They get you a disposable cup filled with what I can only describe as a THICK charcoal smoothy... like, if you had a straw it would stand up in it thick. You've got to drink the charcoal... so, fighting your gag reflex, you empty a cup of fireplace sweepings into your mouth and try your best to swallow it. It tastes worse than you think, and is like trying to drink mud. You somehow manage to get it down... then, they hand you another one...
After you finish your two cups of charcoal, you get hooked up to an IV and wheeled into a ward. Now, you are not feeling so good after your two cups of black death, and the effects of the drugs are starting to kick in. While your parents hug/smack you, you do your best to apologize to them, as you don't want things left badly when you die (which you are probably still fairly confident of).
So, eventually you are just lying there, and you start to feel the drugs kick in. The charcoal of course has lessened the effects somewhat, but you start to feel restless... like you need to move. This is difficult considering you're in a hospital bed with an IV, so you resort to turning your head back and forth every few seconds like a crazy person.
You start to feel more and more tense, at which point your heart rate starts to climb. They park a crash cart outside your room and your moms crying as every muscle in your body starts to flex. Now, you weren't warned about this, so your fingernails are starting to literally dig into your skin are you get a full body cramp.
This lasts for about... 6-8 hours. You go from ""feeling the burn"" to feeling like you've run two marathons and can't stop running. Your heart rate is sitting up at around 300, and they can't really give you much to help because the reason you are in here in the first place is too much medication... so no pain killers, and a little muscle relaxant.
So, once your body gradually starts to relax, you would think things are over... nope. Your body has been flexing its muscles for 8 hours straight. Your body is sore, and you have difficulty sitting up, let alone walking. You try to piss in a container they give you, a good deal of which ends up on you because, well, you're not in the best condition at the moment.
You are instructed to try and sleep, which you manage to a certain extent, your parents trying to sleep in hospital chairs next to you (less successfully). You feel horrible, both due to the physical strain you've just been through, and for frightening the hell out of your parents. Over the next few hours people visit, it's extremely awkward, and you spend the next few days unable to walk (and occasionally pissing on yourself). You don't fully recover for 3-4 weeks.
Now that that is over, things aren't back to normal, because you've single handedly given your parents the worst day of their life, and they are going to watch you like a hawk (understandably). You get to watch people blame themselves for what happened, have literal break downs, and all because of your own actions.
tl;dr: Suicide by anti-depressants is probably one of the most painful things you'll ever experience, and it puts your family and loved ones through hell. Go to a doctor, get help, check yourself into a mental hospital. It is a lot easier to get help then to put yourself, and everyone else, through that shit."

drive2fast,fdkzow1,t1_fdkxex2,"THIS. 

Also weight close to the centre, slightly forward of the axle is much much safer than weight away from the axle of the trailer.  If the weight is too far from the pivot point it tends to throw around the back of your car.  So if possible keep the weight in the middle of the trailer rather than spreading it out. A tight skid of bricks is safer than a loose load spread over the whole trailer. (Sometimes you just have to deal with what ya got though)"

The world hasn't been so optimized that the option doesn't exist, I just think that people forget having a personal car everywhere you go was once considered a luxury.

Also, some HIV clinics/specialty pharmacies will carry brand name HIV meds because they qualify for special state grants and programs. In that case the brand will be cheaper and the generic will be unavailable. 


If you ever have billing questions please feel free to ask us at the pharmacy, we are happy to help."
steelallies,fdiszey,t1_fdia1sp,when a prescription is written is it just a dosage for the main ingredient or does the prescriber specify a brand? if they do can i change it at the pharmacy or is it a conversation you have to have with your prescriber?
RjoTTU-bio,fdivt13,t1_fdiszey,"So for us to fill brand the prescriber would have to write ""brand necessary"" or ""substitution not permitted"". We fill for generic unless the doctor or patient specifies brand. The patient can choose generic even if the doctor writes ""brand necessary"".

I work in the outpatient retail setting, so to us it isn't a huge concern generally. It may be a bigger concern in a hospital setting with more dangerous drugs, or ones with a narrow therapeutic index (effective dose and toxic dose are close together).

no_u17,fech1rt,t1_fdwflge,"Not exactly, if it's a store than they can ""hold"" you. They can't keep you at the store, but they can send police if you leave if they have reasonable cause. It's what I believe is called ""shopkeeper's right"""
TonyPerez27,fdqxxfl,t3_emrvrd,"So are security guards in the UK not given training and certification like they are here in the US (Oregon)?

At least for the company I worked for there was four levels of security certificate. Basic employees that most people would run into, actually don't have any special certifications they just go through the training with the company and/or venue. 
Then you have your OLCC (Oregon liquor license), we're allowed to cut people off from consuming alcohol and check IDs.

The next level up was your DPSST, which is your unarmed security guard license. These people can escort people out and perform citizen arrest until the cops arrive, with whatever forces required so they don't harm other patrons.

The final level was your managerial license which gives you even more rights when arresting and escorting people out.

Then you can also get your armed security license (no one in my company had one), and that allows you to carry a taser and/or gun depending on where you work and who you work for. These are the people you typically see at banks or escorting someone famous around.

Most states have a liquor license you can get, so it kind of applies to the whole US but not quite. What I can assume from your post is that the UK doesn't have any equivalent of the DPSST?"
Free-_-Yourself,fdqyo34,t1_fdqxxfl,"In the UK you have: 

Security Guard: you cannot work in pubs and nightclubs.

Door Supervisor: you can work in the same places as you do as a security guard but you can also work in pubs and nightclubs.

Close protection: I‚Äôm not completely sure about this one, but I guess you can do all of the above and do escort people, etc. as this is the license you need to become a bodyguard. 

With security guard and door supervisor licenses you have the same right and power than any other civilizan.  I repeat: EXACTLY THE SAME POWER AND RIGHT to detain, restraint, etc. AS ANY OTHER CIVILIZAN. Again, I‚Äôm not sure about the close protection license, but not many people have those licenses as they are very expensive to obtain. So 90% of people working on clubs, etc. have a door supervisor license.

Also, at any case you carry guns. Even police are not allowed to carry guns (I know, crazy), just specially trained police."
TonyPerez27,fdrq66l,t1_fdqyo34,"So the first two levels, which are what the average person will run into, are about the same. 

HOWEVER: Any stadium, event center, outdoor amphitheatre, etc, is private property. The guards are sanctioned by the owner to remove trespassers from their property. When we would remove someone, we first had to tell them they're now trespassing and need to leave the property."

Yes, I had no rights above that of a civilian but there are some differences. Most importantly, I was empowered by the business to remove people from the premises that we no longer wanted to serve. Obviously we would first ask them to leave on their own, but we could use force if they refused. Other than that we could perform a citizen's arrest and detain someone for the deputies. Legally anyone can do this, but since we recieved training, were the sober ones in a sea of drunks, and mostly more objective, our decisions were generally well received."

realdappermuis,fds6sdn,t3_emrvrd,"Security guards often behave like they have the power.

I was trying to get out of the bordered area to go home and the guy assumed I was slipping in. In my later life I've managed them at festivals I was running Ops at and they stole us and festival goers blind. Also around where I stay they have alot of condominiums with security guards on post, and the amount of times I've caught them watching me in the shower /using master keys to enter my flat/ etc... I trust them way less because of their illusion of power and getting away with shit."

But hey, I have to work with them everyday and that‚Äôs not my battle. I just thought that I it would be more useful to simply share some information that a lot of people just don‚Äôt know.

Also you will find that, many times, security guards apply for those jobs because they lack confidence and want to hide behind the respect of a license to just pretend that they can do whatever they want. Don‚Äôt let their muscles confuse you: many of them use what you can see outside to hide what it is inside. I see many times at work things...some people should even be able to get a license."

The confusion happens when you only see security guards (which, unsurprisingly do something about it because they are getting paid) doing it, but they have the same right as any other to stop you if you genuinely think someone supposed a threat to others. 

The key is: security guards are just civilians that are getting paid to exercise the rights that everybody else have."

sharkmuhaha,em2ohc,top_level,"I‚Äôve been doing this for years and not only does this remove the moldy residue from the shower head, it also removes water marks from handles. 

Just take a ziploc bag filled appropriately with diluted white vinegar (1:1 vinegar/water ratio or 2:1 for more potency) with a rubber band or hair tie around the opening and  slide it onto the shower head. Let it sit for an hour or so. Remove the bag and wipe the shower head and watch the nasty stuff exit the holes in the shower head. Equally gross and satisfying.

BinBender,em2cof,top_level,"(A bit of a long read, TLDR at bottom.) 

When I was a little boy, I believed that the floor would fall down if I flushed the toilet. 

Why? 

When I was about 3 or 4, I needed to use the toilet at an old school. It was the kind of toilets where you had to pull a chain to flush. Some older boys I met on my way in told me the floor would fall down if I pulled the chain. I was terrified, and of course didn‚Äôt pull it. I told someone else what I had been told about the chain, and they told me it was to flush the toilet. My conclusion? Floor would fall down if you flushed a toilet. (Or it might at least, who really knows these things for sure?)

I didn‚Äôt flush a toilet for years, not even at home, and often shit my pants due to this. Shitting in a toilet without flushing made people angry, but if I shit my pants, people treated it as an accident. I tried to hold it in for as long as possible, but shit has a tendency to come out eventually. (Many politicians can confirm.) As there is very little room for food when nothing has come out for a week or so, I think this is the main reason I ate very little, and was very skinny, and also after a while, became a lot shorter than other children my age.

I saw/heard/understood that other people flushed, and that the floor didn‚Äôt fall down, but I still couldn‚Äôt make myself do it. It wasn‚Äôt until I was 7, and we moved to a house where the toilet was so close to the door that I could stand outside and flush that I gradually overcame my ‚Äúflush phobia‚Äù, first by standing outside and flushing, then in the door opening, and finally without opening the door at all. It still took quite a while (maybe a couple of years) before I dared to take a dump, or flush after peeing, away from home. And for years, I still had a tendency to hold it in rather than just taking a dump when I felt the need. (More or less unconsciously, and mostly just by habit at this point.) And I guess I was short and skinny my entire childhood and teenage years due to (after effects of) this.

Today, as a grown man, I can almost laugh about the entire matter, and I rather blame my (single parent) mom, who never realized what was going on with me, that it went this far, rather than those young boys who just made a silly joke on their way out of a toilet. But I guess the morale of the story still must be that you should be really careful what you tell children as a ‚Äúharmless joke‚Äù. 

_____

TLDR;

When I was about 3, some boys tricked me into believing the floor would fall down if I flushed the toilet. This gave me a real phobia against flushing the toilet for years, and also led to an eating disorder of sorts, that followed me my entire childhood and adolescence.

MistaBobMarley,fdmx87w,t1_fdmwqtm,"Here's a little info, I did all this too.. it wasbt caused by a joke or prank, I'm not entirely sure why it began but I had the issues you had, guess what I didn't do? Blame my mom.. why? Because how tf would she know? I hid it from her as I'm sure you did with your mom, shes not superhuman. I blame myself for not telling my mom sooner, cus when she did find out, I got help. It's not your moms fault"
Stercore_,fdox8vi,t1_fdmwnu4,"he did but for the right reasons. his mom should absolutely have seen wtf was going on, if my kid didn‚Äôt flush, shit his pants on the regular all the way to seven years old and still struggled with flushing fpr years after i would definetly have a sit down with him, most likely even counseling."
BinBender,fdmzl4y,t1_fdmx87w,"Thanks for sharing. I guess you have a point, it may have been difficult for her to find the cause of the problems, and apart from constantly shitting my pants, I guess I hid it from her the best I could. And since this was so long ago, I can‚Äôt really know what she tried or thought. I only remember she was really annoyed with me when she constantly had to wash shit from my underwear, and often told me I had to wear diapers if I didn‚Äôt learn to use the toilet. (She never made me do that, thankfully...) I still find it a bit concerning, though, that she hardly could remember that I had these problems as a child when I brought it up with her in my twenties. (It‚Äôs not like she has dementia or anything.) Seems to me she never really noticed, or didn‚Äôt really care that much..."
10points_4Gryffindor,fdn54f4,t1_fdmzl4y,"Just trying to think on her side of things, she also just may not have wanted to really talk about it. She may have thought it would embarrass you again, she may think it‚Äôs just better not to bring it up bc it was that much of a problem, or hell maybe she just didn‚Äôt want to think back to the time she was cleaning shit a lot you know? Easiest way to avoid talking about it would be to say you don‚Äôt really remember. Idk just my two cents I don‚Äôt know your guys‚Äô relationship"
nigerianprince00,fdw8tq4,t1_fdmzl4y,If you haven't had told her straight up that you can't flush the toilet because you think the floor will collapse then it's not her fault
ryebread91,fdwrnw6,t1_fdn54f4,Being afraid of embarrassing your child by bringing something up like that is not correct either though. Those five minutes of embarrassment could've stopped it years earlier. At the same time some new parents just think something like that may be normal until someone they mention it to tells them it's not.
BinBender,fdz2plx,t1_fdw8tq4,"I respect your opinion, and I‚Äôm not saying she should have been able to read my mind, but I do think she should have done more to figure out what was going on with me. But my point was really just that I find it hard to blame it all on those boys who said those things to me, it was just a silly prank to them. And after all, it was my mother‚Äôs job to ensure my wellbeing, and I must say I think she failed at that. I could also tell you a lot of other reasons why I think my mom did a terrible job as a parent, but that is way beside the point here..."
EPscumbag,fdm2j36,t3_em2cof,"Customer‚Äôs child had to use toilet at my restaurant. I hand over WC key and casually mention ‚Äòthe light flickers, I think the bathroom is haunted‚Äô Child freaked out and refused to go in.

I really hope I didn‚Äôt cause any permanent damage."
SantasDead,fdm3yvg,t1_fdm2j36,You did the kid a favor. Sounds like his/her parents coddled them.
Lexdyslic,fdm56sr,t1_fdm3yvg,"Makes me think of young kids who are scared of dogs or other common pets, never understood it."
mooneb,fdo98tp,t1_fdm3yvg,"Does it, though?  Where do you get that?  
You don't even know if this was a 14 year old, 9 year old or a 4 year old.  

Kids get scared for all sorts of reasons, about all sorts of things that don't seem like they make a lot of sense until you dig into it a little.  Then you find the cause and can help them get past it with some talk."
rumade,fdqhdec,t1_fdm3yvg,"Some kids have very active imaginations and can't help themselves when it comes to things like this though. You plant a seed and it runs away from them.

That said, we need to get better at teaching kids coping mechanisms for times like these. I got over my fear of the dark by imagining a protective shield around me that could kill any ghosts or monsters."
nappyamy,fdms8fw,t1_fdm56sr,"i can confirm when i was younger i was scared of dogs because my aunt had this particularly scary ankle biter that would chase me/ actually ended up biting me once.
to this day i have a hard time warming up to dogs, and throughout my time growing up always had a fear of them. i feel as though i was more afraid because the family never did anything about it, my guardian ignored it and so i was raised to believe some dogs acted like that normally / it wasn‚Äôt looked upon as a bad thing."
Quizzical_Cat,fdqtjam,t1_fdm56sr,"Grew up around constantly angry small dogs which bit me a lot. This lead to a fear of all dogs, which I had until I recently got an adorable 50-pound mountain cur who loves belly rubs. Early experiences matter a lot."
specific-impulse,fdlzghr,t3_em2cof,This entire post is fucking hilarious.
brbulk,fdlzge8,t3_em2cof,"So because some boys played a prank you blame them for a irrational phobia and an eating disorder? Let‚Äôs take some responsibility here dude, people play pranks all the time. And you knew other people were flushing and nothing happened so..... 

If every prank was taken literally a lot more kids would have weird ass quirks today but they don‚Äôt. Sorry dude you‚Äôre kind of an outlier here"
kakayj,fdmiwar,t1_fdlzge8,I don't think you understand what a phobia or a toddler is.
BinBender,fdmx2er,t1_fdlzge8,"As I wrote, I blame my mom for letting it go that far, not the kids. And I agree this is an extreme example. But little kids are not rational, and phobias are not rational. A simple joke can be really scary for a small child, that‚Äôs my point. It‚Äôs not funny to scare a child."
brbulk,fdmj18u,t1_fdmiwar,He said it affected him till he was a teenager and even after 7 he would ‚Äúseldom flush‚Äù and would ‚Äúhold it in‚Äù creating an ‚Äúeating disorder‚Äù but okay lol
jishnusankar,fdm3zlq,t3_em2cof,"Okay, you are dumb. Your mom has got nothing to do with it, don't blame her. Also, please note, this is not a joke. I don't want you to spend your rest of life thinking this is a joke."
BinBender,fdmxtm5,t1_fdm3zlq,"Thank you for your insightful and constructive criticism. My mom obviously had nothing to do with my wellbeing as a child, and of course, at the age of four, no children are easy to fool, and I just should have seen through a joke like that, and just choose not to develop a phobia for flushing toilets, because that‚Äôs how phobia works..."
Donkeybutttwerk,fdnejgs,t3_em2cof,"I can relate. We went snorkeling in the ocean on a boat trip and i (8yrs old) went to secure my goggles to my face and before i dove under water a family relative told me, ""dont go too deep or the goggles will suck your eyes out from pressure and your skull will cave in"" üò≤ So i didnt. For years!! Till i was abt 13 and warned a friend not to swim deep with goggles or your eyes will get sucked out. Ive never heard some one laugh so hard and long before she dove as deep as possible and came up without her skull caved in and eyes still intact. My mind was blown!!üòÇ"
Zappsqueak,fdqxw0h,t3_em2cof,"Wow. Something went seriously wrong in your brain there.   

If someone had told my 4yo self ""the floor will fall down if you flush!"" I would've been like ""TROLOLOL"" and flush all the time without going.  

So I get what you're saying; I wouldn't have known that it was impossible. I always had to try such things out because you can not be sure of anything if you know nothing."
hellabella333,fdr28ip,t3_em2cof,"I guess I have supreme bladder control,  because I wasn't afraid of the floor falling,  but something about ALL public toilets until I was 10 years old or so, terrified me to the point I just didn't use them
 I would always hold it till I got home, this post makes me wonder if someone or something said was the trigger."
BinBender,fdsuxdj,t1_fdr28ip,I can also hold it for hours. My wife is really envious!
FrankSavage420,fdxs7pi,t3_em2cof,Upvoted for slamming politicians
Hack_Cubit,fdn6hjw,t3_em2cof,"Fortunately my parents were smart about the whole kids will believe anything trick. They convinced be not to touch slugs by claiming that my skin would become like theirs if I did.

Also idk if it's true or not but they told me pets throw up if you pet them while they're eating."
kosher-salty,fe6ivtd,t1_fdn6hjw,"pets won't throw up - they told you this so you wouldn't get mauled! a lot of animals are food aggressive (they get defensive when eating and will perceive any interaction as an attack), unless they were trained otherwise. don't pet an eating/drinking animal unless you already know they're cool with it!"
CaptainAwesome06,fdqpjrv,t3_em2cof,Now you have me thinking about when I told my 6 year old daughter that you grow a tail at about 8 years old.  By the time she was 10 she thought she was a late bloomer.  I'm pretty sure she knows it's not true now but she never brings it up.
linwar_au,fdm1nrv,t3_em2cof,That‚Äôs why you shouldn‚Äôt take kids to church. Lol getting down voted because the truth hurts
nappyamy,fdmsgek,t1_fdm1nrv,"i understand why people might find your comment offensive, but i grew up having a close to phobia level fear of ‚Äúgoing to hell‚Äù. The idea that i would be tortured for the rest of eternity was hard to swallow i guess.
So i can see where the mentality lies even though i don‚Äôt entirely agree with your comment."
aspirationalcornhusk,fdmve2q,t3_em2cof,"I get what you're saying and all and people should for sure be careful not to flat out lie to kids, but one kid having what sounds like a crippling anxiety disorder and disordered eating shouldn't preclude people from making jokes to kids. Yeah, some jokes can cause a misunderstanding for a while, but you're definitely an outlier here - especially because somehow this lasted until you were a teenager. This is a bit like expecting media or teachers not to talk about difficult topics because it might trigger someone's trauma. It's not right to expect the world to cater to everyone's neuroses, coping with those so you can handle what the world throws at you (within reason) is your own responsibility. 

I do agree with you though that it's strange that your mom didn't notice something serious was going on."
BinBender,fdmy2wu,t1_fdmve2q,"I agree to some extent. But I don‚Äôt think it is right to play pranks on children, and have a laugh at their expense. Chances are it will leave a greater mark than you can imagine. Small kids are really impressionable. That‚Äôs my point with this post."
aspirationalcornhusk,fdmybid,t1_fdmy2wu,I posit that you shouldn't play pranks on anyone.
BinBender,fdmzyak,t1_fdmybid,"Agreed. If it‚Äôs not funny for everyone, it‚Äôs not funny."
