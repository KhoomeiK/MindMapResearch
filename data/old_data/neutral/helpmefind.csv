melvinthefish,fe19xzm,t1_fdye7cm,I was trying to help people laugh and failed miserably.  Sorry I'll try not to do it again. Didnt mean any harm.
peoplegrower,fdw4yri,t3_en35eg,"I own these socks. Love them! They were a gag gift from my sister because I was always really thin and she used to call me chicken legs as a kid. Anyway, I decided to wear them one random day a few weeks ago, needed to run some errands and a quick dr visit to check how my bp meds were doing. Turns out, I was due for a pap. They said “take off everything below the waist, but your socks.” Dr and nurse weren’t expecting literal chicken legs in the stirrups... Definitely made for a more relaxed atmosphere. Highly recommend."

Worthpoint also shows two prior sales of the pink version in 2013.  But I can't even find a picture of the blue/purple one anywhere.  Was hoping that seeing what color it originally was would help with searching, but I guess we're stuck trying both ""blue"" and ""purple""."
BrunetteMami,fdoyjkn,t1_fdoxt2j,My daughter just confirmed the same.  I have a duplicate here somewhere that I ended up not needing.  Hopefully it wasn’t tossed out- Ill look around!

FearAndDelight,fe9uvum,t1_fe77to9,This is pathetically simple for that price. I would honestly make it myself if I wanted to. No crazy thing going on. Just some materials. My dad's use to make me furniture. Every 2 years or so he would make me a desk a little higher because I grew up. Even though I could just take a higher chair. He just like to do it in his free time. And I learn somethings from him. That it better to make it yourself.

DomUK89,fe8zvy6,t1_fe8xo5b,"Honestly it doesn't look difficult to make at all. Run some dowel horizontally for the pivot, which goes through a hole across everything, and then for each hanger, have a 45 degree mitre at the base to allow it to open to that range and have it press against a sheet of ply on the back when opene. Scale the concept to whatever size you want. The rest is very basic joinery."

ubmt1861,fdfwqbn,t1_fdfnubs,Do you have the pictures of the rest of the angles? If so I'm sure you could get some bored kind redditor to provide you with vector artwork. Most small companies that have a mug press don't give a shit about copyright infringement on one offs and shit like that (worked at a few over 12 years). Just find a local engraving or screen printing place.
