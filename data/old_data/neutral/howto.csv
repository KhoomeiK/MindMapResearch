ChronicallySad,elnk0f,top_level,
nervyliras,fdj4gpu,t3_elnk0f,Would someone be kind enough to explain which tools are being used here?
1s1woodshop,fdj4o9g,t1_fdj4gpu,"Table saw, router, band saw, drill, belt sander, orbital sander, planer, blow torch."
KeroZelo,fdjgehd,t1_fdj4gpu,I wood if i could
oceanchimp,fdla1jx,t1_fdj4gpu,*wood
nervyliras,fdj5ei7,t1_fdj4o9g,Any ideas as to the rough cost associated with each item you listed?
zhiryst,fdjwcbf,t1_fdj4o9g,"Don't forget the important but homemade jigs, cross cut jig for the table saw and the router base which looks home made too"
strong_grey_hero,fdk04rc,t1_fdj4o9g,Hammer
ahufs,fdjaqmm,t1_fdj5ei7,"I’ll price them based on Craigslist pricing I’ve seen in Las Vegas, NV and Denver, CO. Looking at the tools used starting with the thickness planer($65-300) for a 12inch model on Craigslist. Used to change the thickness of the wood. For this project you could use the table saw to do almost the same thing. A planer leaves a nice smooth finish where as the table saw blade not so much.

Contractor Table saw $50-450. Also used two homemade table saw sleds which can be made from scrap. It’s personal preference on material used to make a sled. First sled used was to make a slot for the bottom of the mug. Second sled was used to put an angle on the wood.

Cordless drill $30-100 I’ve picked up old corded drills for $1-5 at yard sales. Used to make a makeshift router table.

Drill bits - I pick these up at yard sales from time to time. Their decently cheap in store as well. With most things you get what you pay for especially drill bits

Router $15-100 was used to route the edges to be able to make a circle. He also used the router to put a smooth edge on the cups handle.

Bandsaw $100-300 was used to cut out the handle. An alternative could be a skillsaw $20-50.

Belt sander $30-100 he mounted his upside down and probably used a clamp to keep the power switch engaged.

What the clip didn’t show was how he cut out the circle for the bottom of the mug. He could’ve used a circle cutting jig for the bandsaw or table saw. Or just bought a wooden circle off the inter webs such as Etsy or eBay.

Then you’ve got your misc clamps, hose clamp, hammer, glue etc.

The low prices on the list are what I’ve seen things listed at and some of which I’ve purchased at. The high prices I’ve listed can obviously go higher it just depends on brand, quality and other variables. I enjoy looking for quality tools for my shop. I’ve found deals a plenty but it’s definitely a waiting game. Put a few items on your lookout list and if you’re lucky you might spot that shiny piece quickly."
ChronicallySad,fdj5tum,t1_fdj5ei7,"If you have a Goodwill Outlet store in your area, they are a good resource for cheap tools. Just bought a router for 4 bucks (69 cents a pound)"
Creativegoblin,fdjn4ru,t1_fdj5ei7,"If you find a maker space they will let you use their stuff.  
My area one has all of those i think and its 60 a month for unlimited access or 30 dollars a month i you only want to go 4 times  
And they have people who will help you learn how to use the tools.  
If this is something you want to make a butt load like a business venture it might eventually be worth it to get everything if you are planning on getting it used but new then (at least the ones near me) you get three years almost and no need for space and maintenance"
Xephyrous,fdjxz5m,t1_fdj5ei7,"Most of that could be done with hand tools without too much difficulty.  I wouldn't trust myself to cut the angles on the staves right or to put the dado in the right place manually though.  Rounding over those edges could be done with a rasp, although it'd be hard to get it to look as neat as with a router.

So, say a table saw, a coping saw, some sandpaper, a half-round rasp, and a plumber's torch should do the trick.  It'd probably look a lot nicer if you have a router, though."
1s1woodshop,fdj5mtl,t1_fdj5ei7,"Oooooh man, if ever there was a loaded question lol. 

I mean, it's HIGHLY variable from the types you get to the brands. Bare minimum $1500 for all. And the sky's the limit on the high end. That's not including the bits, blades, belts, etc. that were used."
Im_Lars,fdkh0z7,t1_fdj5ei7,"Just wanted to add in, though not known for most items having long-term quality, Harbor Freight is a good alternative for buying tools. Especially if they're ones you don't plan on using often. The nice thing about Harbor Freight is if an item breaks (usually) you know that it's an item worth paying more for. You can also double check reviews on stuff to see if it's worth it for certain stuff. However unless you got the money and/or are a weekend warrior there's no need to go spend $3-5k on professional DeWalt or Milwaukee tools."
nervyliras,fdk563b,t1_fdjaqmm,I happen to live in one of those cities you listed so that's very accurate and helpful haha thank you 😊
ladytri277,fdx4r1z,t1_fdjaqmm,That’s over $1000 to make a mug. Getting right on that...
1s1woodshop,fdjqyx0,t1_fdj5tum,"They say Reddit will expose you in ways you never thought possible. Today, I can say that is true for me. I've never heard anyone price a tool purchase by the pound, as if it were ground chuck. Thank you Reddit. The gifts you provide are plentiful"
Mr_MacGrubber,fdk192c,t1_fdj5mtl,$1500? You can definitely buy that stuff for significantly less. Would be like $500 from Harbor Freight.
ChronicallySad,fdlh10f,t1_fdjqyx0,"Just for clarity, they sell all types of things in the outlet store so you have to hunt. Sometimes you find gems. One time I found a bong."
moldy912,fdm00d5,t1_fdlh10f,But how much was the bong per pound?
ChronicallySad,fdm27jx,t1_fdm00d5,69 cents buddy
TheOilyHill,fdmanz0,t1_fdm27jx,that bong has seen some stuffs then
StopShoutingAtMe,fdjhmub,t3_elnk0f,This will be great to drink my beer from while i sing 1700s sea shanties.
Loveyourwifenow,fdjpxkl,t3_elnk0f,How do you clean a mug like this to keep it clean and safe to use?
Todo744,fdk2nwj,t1_fdjpxkl,Beeswax or epoxy.
ElusiveWhark,fdk2pga,t1_fdjpxkl,"Same way you would clean anything else. I believe titebond 2 or 3 is food safe so as long as you dont use a soft, porous wood you should be fine"
ahufs,fdnqcqi,t1_fdjpxkl,You can use some white vinegar on the wood to disinfect it. I use laxative oil found at your local pharmacy to maintain it on the cheap. Would be the same method you use to clean a wooden cutting board.
LVLupIRL,fdj9od5,t3_elnk0f,"I wonder how often he actually uses it. You guys ever make/build shit, but then rarely ever use it because you're busy making/building other shit?

Edit: Or you're trying to keep it pristine so you never touch it. Is that just me?"
snailspace,fdm20c0,t1_fdj9od5,Same. I have a beautiful fish tank stand that I worked on for weeks until it was gorgeous. Now it holds an empty fish tank. I'm too busy to keep fish!

I have permanent loss of feeling in one of my fingers compliments of my table saw.  I learned the hard way.  

Great project though, thanks for sharing!"
eagle00255,fdjva2a,t1_fdjv048,What should he have done differently to be a safer process?
toaster-riot,fdlb5w5,t1_fdjva2a,"Using push blocks would have kept his hands a little further away and it also puts another object between your flesh and the tool.  

Router tables are notorious for grabbing your work piece and throwing it away if you don't read the grain and plan your cut path correctly.  When that happens you really don't want your hand to go along for the ride or slide into the bit when you're startled.

You can buy dedicated push blocks that are basically plastic with foam pads on the bottom or you can use any old piece of wood you have laying around."
eagle00255,fdlce5s,t1_fdlb5w5,Is there any reason to not use a fence with these pieces?
toaster-riot,fdnwr1f,t1_fdlce5s,"Yup, he was using a bit with a bearing on it.  It goes by really quick but there's a small ball bearing at the top of the tool.  That rides against the workpiece and kind of acts like a fence.  It keeps the piece from diving into the bit and it ensure that the profile you're routing maintains a consistent depth relative to the edge.  

You could use a fence but it's much easier to ride the bearing because there's no setup involved."
eagle00255,fdo41dc,t1_fdnwr1f,Thanks for the explanation. Aspiring woodworker with only hand tools because powered stuff is expensive and intimidating
toaster-riot,fdph9es,t1_fdo41dc,"Sure thing!

I really hate using the router.  It's so loud and...aggressive?  I don't know, it just isn't fun like hand tools are.

Cheers"
twofirstnamesjj,fdk0kvy,t3_elnk0f,I read the title as “how to make a wooden RUG” and was very intrigued to see how this could be done and then confused at the end because what the hell kind of rug has a handle and is cylindrical. Then I reread the title and it all made sense once more

hobbymerlin,fdkp128,t3_elnk0f,"I love the fact that he used individual pieces instead of one huge block.

qeryi,fdpxt0m,t1_fdp69h2,Curious - why were you against pacifiers?
eightcarpileup,fdpy7ai,t1_fdpxt0m,"Not OP, but I come from a family who doesn’t use them. My parents told me it was because they saw their friends try to take them away from their toddlers before (my parents) got pregnant and didn’t want to go through the fuss. My dad once said to me, “why would I give you a crutch as a baby? Pacifiers make babies dependent on them for comfort.” My sister’s and I weren’t criers.Also, I’m not sure if the science supports this, but my parents also believe it fucks up the alignment of children’s teeth."
RedMisread,fdqbvl6,t1_fdpxt0m,"I was against using them (for my own kid personally not in general cuz you do you!!) because I was breastfeeding and I was worried about nipple confusion. And I also didn't realize how some babies just need more suckling comfort than would be comfortable or reasonable with breastfeeding. 

And just to list some pro/cons for anyone interested, from the research I've seen, using pacifiers also help to reduce SIDS so another benefit there. And like another poster said, a con of using pacifiers is that it can mess up their teeth/palate but only if used too long."
sandos,fdq8h0c,t1_fdpy7ai,"Well here in Sweden it is taken as fact that it does screw up the alignment, but if weened before the age of 3 or so it doesnt seem to be a problem."
Arbok-Obama,fdqa92y,t1_fdpy7ai,"Thumb sucking definitely fucks with teeth alignment, no doubt. I had a cousin who sucked his thumb until he was like 8-9 and his teeth were fucked. Granted it’s anecdotal, but the front teeth shot out exactly where he put his thumb.  Can’t speak to pacifiers though."
theseshoesrock,fdqzgch,t1_fdpy7ai,"I once saw a video at my dentist's office explaining exactly how it messes up the teeth. Basically, the prolonged forward pressure of the thumb against the upper jaw pushes the teeth out and elongates the roof of the mouth forward. This is why children who suck their thumb until late in childhood have a huge overbite. I went to school with some girls who were still sucking their thumbs in 3rd or 4th grade. They had to have braces for about 5 years, and still have massive overbites as adults in their late 30s."
qeryi,fdt4fhn,t1_fdqbvl6,Oh I see! Interesting - I didn't know a pacifier could do so much
rtant,fdp7qk0,t3_emg4sv,Cool. Please do one on a toddler next.

mOdQuArK,fea338y,t1_fe9lcwn,"Brain develops like muscles; the more you struggle with specific types of information, your brain will get better & more efficient at it until it makes sense (weightlifting for brains).

I beat my head against the mathematics wall in college for years, grinding out problem sets even though I barely understand what it was I was solving, but somewhere in my 3rd year my brain made some sort of connection & all of the stuff I learned in the 1st year suddenly made intuitive sense.

Of course, like muscles, once you stop using that specific knowledge it can fade pretty fast. When I look at my old college textbooks, it _feels_ familiar, but I couldn't solve the same problem sets to save my life right now."

DEKEFFIN_DEFIBER,fe2pqeq,t1_fe2behs,"This is correct.  I travel for a living and have never rolled.  I don’t get folds in my suit jacket.  

I have used hanging suitcases and this is way more convenient for travel if you don’t like checking bags."
sabin357,fe5uj6w,t1_fe5l2nh,"> What’s the point in even looking at this sub if you’re just going to come here to say “my way is better”.

Because this is a place to learn about a wide variety of things, not just one. So if you see someone giving bad/situational/partial advice on something you're already knowledgeable about, you should try to help the people here that are also trying to learn, but aren't yet knowledgeable. In many cases, people are just instantly sharing an image guide that they found elsewhere & didn't create or check into before posting. I don't think that's the case here, just to be clear though.

The roll technique here is stated to prevent wrinkles, when in fact it's one of the worst options for creating wrinkles. Even if you do a single hard fold (thought of as a bad option), you only deal with a single line wrinkle that you can easily get out at any hotel with the complimentary iron & board/steamer. A hanging luggage bag is even better, which is why I recommended it. The posted option is literally the worst solution I'm aware of for wrinkles.

I don't have any pictures of it but I have enjoyed thoroughly it when out at a dark sky site.

Another part of the Milky Way to pay attention to is the wintertime Milky Way. It is also quite beautiful but requires a very dark sky site to see it clearly."

Fallout4Addict,fdmnpwe,t1_fdmnkkr,I was going to suggest this or use bricks/wood to add hight or use a shorter chair depends on your leg length.
dataddiction69,fdmoaer,t1_fdmnpwe,"Ill try this , but where do i buy bricks , in that case is there a white coloured brick ?"
Fallout4Addict,fdmod7j,t1_fdmoaer,You can get them online or check out your local hardware/diy store. It might be cheaper to buy normal bricks and a cheap can of paint rather than pay extra for painted bricks.
dragon34,fdn2otz,t1_fdmoaer,"bricks will scratch the shit out of your floor.  I would probably get a 1x6 and a 2x4 and cut the 2x4 into 2 sections that are the depth of the desk sides.  Cut 4 lengths of 1x6 that are the same as the 2x4.   Put 1x6 on either side of the 2x4 (with the narrower side on the ground so they are flush on one side and the 1x6 forms a channel.  paint the sides and top of that if you want.  Put felt on the bottom. 

Place 2x4s with 1x6s screwed to the sides upright so the channel is upright, have someone help you lift the desk and slide the feet underneath.  Should be pretty stable as long as your 2x4 is straight (make sure to get a good one at the hardware store, be prepared to check a bunch, lots of them are twisted)   If you have access to something like a planer make sure the assembled legs are flat on the bottom."
hippoCAT,fdmvi1k,t1_fdmoaer,If you look on Facebook or LetGo you could find someone trying to give them away for free
TootsNYC,fdn9k87,t1_fdmoaer,"I’d do a 2x4 because you can paint them and attach them to the bottom (on their edge for maximum height and for a less intrusive appearance)

Get it cut to length at the store. 

Use [blind nails, or double-ended nails](https://www.rokhardware.com/fastcap-blind-nail-kit-double-ended-3-8-x-3-16-100-nails.html) so the wood stays in place"

TheRoughneckWay,fdnf2rf,t1_fdn2otz,"I mean no offense to anyone, and I'm only answering this way because of the context I got from OP's question:
I don't think OP has the tools and technical ability for this. It would be a great and easy project to learn on, if OP is interested, and your how-to would be effective AF. But I think getting the lumber store to cut 4x4 to the length of the desk and just putting it under the legs with a nonslip mat would be easier."
suktupbutterkup,fdoktbm,t1_fdmvi1k,Or maybe even a taller desk or shorter chair for free?
dragon34,fdnfp6n,t1_fdnf2rf,that's possible too.  I guess I have a had a circular saw and a drill for so long that I forget people don't have them.  I'd just worry about bumping the table and having it fall off the 4x4 on one side and either having the items on it slide off and break or if she bumped it while she was sitting there and it fell that she could be injured or trapped.
TheRoughneckWay,fdnhcx7,t1_fdnfp6n,"That's possible. In that case, I'd get a small bottle of TiteBond #2 and glue the desk leg bottoms to the lumber, after spray painting them white with primer.  The TiteBond will be bonded to the paint instead of the wood, but a few days ago I had to beat two glued, primered boards apart. It took me 2 unsuccessful swings to realize that I needed to actually swing like I meant it."
TheRoughneckWay,fdoobfq,t1_fdnfp6n,Also you've just reminded me that I've got spare drills and circular saws lying around collecting dust that ought to be in my boys' hands.
TheRoughneckWay,fdnfaoh,t1_fdnf3cb,Thanks Dad.
dragon34,fdp29k4,t1_fdoobfq,"I had a cheap drill that broke about when my now husband and I started dating.  He had a dewalt plug in drill that he bought in 98ish.   It is still the only drill we have.  :) . I think we have two circ saws, one was his dad's old one for doing stupid shit with (like trimming concrete from sidewalk pieces we were reusing) and one's actually good."
TheRoughneckWay,fdp320k,t1_fdp29k4,"When my dad retired a few years ago my mom made him for me a hobby so that he wouldn't drive her crazy. He opted for ""Storage Wars""... 
So besides the tons and tons of junk he now owns, he's won several units with power tools. Old, cheap branded loud ones, but they've all worked perfectly. I don't know why or how, but my brother-in-law and I were talking and laughing about the storage units one day and I mentioned that I was tired of dad giving me circular saws on a weekly basis. My BIL looked shocked, jaw gaping and disappointed eyes. He said my dad had been giving him circular saw blades like crazy but never a saw. Needless to say we organized a trade, but I still ended up with 4 I think."

MoreCowbellMofo,fdop6dj,t1_fdmq36v,Came here to suggest this. I use planks to prop up the babies cot 10-15% at one end so that they can sleep peacefully whilst constantly full of cold (teething). You might want to screw/glue the planks together with some guide planks at the side to ensure they don't slip off. Perhaps even a slightly wider base than the planks too to ensure they don't topple.
LonelyHowl,fdmrnnu,t1_fdmr4mb,Let me know how it turned out (:
