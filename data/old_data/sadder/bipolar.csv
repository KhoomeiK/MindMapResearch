ladyfishbones,enyftw,top_level,
cluelessclod,fe6c655,t3_enyftw,I just finished my 4 year bachelor degree with honours. Bipolar flared up the whole way through but I persisted. Don’t let a diagnosis stop you from earning your degree!
Beemoeee,fe6fhrl,t1_fe6c655,Congrats! I finish mine pretty soon so I’m just trying to pull myself through.
ladyfishbones,fe6iy1w,t1_fe6c655,That's amazing! Congratulations!!!:)
rishajd81,fe7e8b3,t1_fe6c655,Hi. I messaged you something and would really appreciate it if you could respond.
aquariumbitch,fe99pvp,t1_fe6c655,Me too!!! Go us!!!!
Yffre_Earthbones,fe6hrcc,t1_fe6fhrl,You can make it. I finished this past semester and just got my notification of graduation today. You can do this!
ladyfishbones,fe6ipz8,t1_fe6fhrl,You've got this! :) you'll be done in no time I bet! Thats what I'm telling myself about getting started... I'll be done before I know it! Keep it up!
cluelessclod,fe7g5mj,t1_fe7e8b3,I replied honey.
ladyfishbones,fe6itbo,t1_fe6hrcc,Congratulations on finishing!!! Got any tips?
degustibus,fe6lo4a,t1_fe6itbo,"I did finish, but I made it so much harder on myself than needed in retrospect.

Tip1: Immediately set up an appointment with an academic advisor/guidance counselor.  Discuss your goals and plan your semesters/quarters accordingly. Use a planner or calendar to stay on top of important dates (add classes!).

Tip2: I only found out about this far too late, but I recommend you reach out immediately: the offices for disabled students (or however they phrase it).  Once they know you have a significant condition they can be your advocate if the need arises and sometimes they can make it less stressful for you in school.

Tip3:  Know what you want to study and why (sort of goes back to Tip 1).  Yes, I did graduate with honors and Phi Beta Kappa from a really well regarded university, but my strange resume (gaps due to hospitalizations and such) and background check issues makes me think I should probably have focused on the more practical parts of my education, i.e. more computer skills (have  some, but good jobs expect a lot usually).

Tip4:  Personally, I would not share my diagnosis with anybody until there was a clear reason why.  People can be so cruel and malicious.

Tip5:  I know a lot of the college experience is socializing with peers and networking.  I won't say be a loner and just focus on studies, but a friendly reminder that we should really not drink much ever and that it's crucial to keep our sleep schedules steady.

Tip6:  Try to plan your week.  I find that many of us are more easily distracted than the average person.  So block out time for studying and papers before you do things not related to your goals.

&#x200B;

You're in for a great experience!  Truth be told, even when I was a broke student, I generally enjoyed it way more than when I was making money but not intellectually challenged.  Are you going to live at home or school?  There's a lot to be said for home if feasible."
cluelessclod,fe6xwh5,t1_fe6itbo,"My top tip is register with disability support and use their services. 

My second top tip is make sure your spouse is super supportive! Get married to the love of your life halfway through your degree and use their love to get you through. Couldn’t have done it without him."
Yffre_Earthbones,fe8259x,t1_fe6itbo,"If you're doing the community college route make sure to speak with transfer advisors from both institutions you plan on attending so you ensure you take the correct coursework. I had a lot of hassle with that.

It's okay to change majors! Follow what you what to do, what you enjoy studying. 

Don't sweat grades too much. That was way to easy to panic about GPA, which is important but the more I worried about it the worse I did. It's okay to get a C in a course or two. It's okay to withdraw when you took too many courses in one semester. You can explain those things to employers and grad school administration when the time comes and so far I've found them to be very understanding.

Spend time connecting with your department and the professors in it. Networking can do a lot more for you than good grades. It's a great way to get into research or internships that build experience employers are looking for after you graduate. Plus fellow students in your major are a great resource for studying, advice, and support. I've made some life long connections along the way.

This is really hard, especially since we've got a mental illness, but try to not be stressed. Try to enjoy the learning experience. Granted there was plenty of times I was super stressed and did not enjoy it. But stressing got in the way of learning and it's just not worth the energy, better to keep pushing on and keep focused on the end goal, your degree. It's okay to take mental health days when you need to help with this, so do it!

Good luck, I rooting for you! College is a daunting task but you can make it through!"
Reckle_,fe80ev3,t1_fe6itbo,"I want to add to this too - make friends with the people in your classes. If you need to miss a day, knowing where you can get notes from is a lifesaver."
FluorescentClear,fe8tpor,t1_fe6itbo,"The others have a lot of good tips. 

My one best tip is to come up with a daily schedule that includes a set time for studying. Even if you don’t have any homework that is due, use that time to read your notes, re-read your textbooks, or practice skills that you’re learning. For me, I studied every night from 9:00-12:00 on the days I wasn’t working (I worked 2 nights a week tending bar). By having that set schedule, I developed a habit of studying and was able to keep on top of my classes. It’s way too easy to let things start to slide if I’m not scheduling myself, and then it gets overwhelming."
RalphTheWonderLlamma,fec1li8,t1_fe6lo4a,"I’d like to add to this wonderful list to only take as many classes as you feel comfortable taking- it’s not a race. If you feel overloaded withdraw from a class, medical withdrawals can occur even after the last drop date."
sayswut,fec494j,t1_fe6lo4a,Tip 2 is ESSENTIAL. It means you can let the university know when shit is going sideways.
JayBird9540,fe6nakx,t3_enyftw,"If I can give any advice, even on your worst day still go to class. No matter what, go to class. 

You don’t have to dress up, or talk to people, or smell nice. You can completely check out if you voice record the class and listen later, loved doing this. 

But too many times I absolutely shot myself in the foot because I felt like the world hated me and I didn’t want to leave my room that day. I wish I would have just gone. I started forcing myself to just go and I finally graduated in December. Still feel like shit though."
ladyfishbones,fe9b09j,t1_fe6nakx,"That's actually a really good tip to record the class, I'm going to remember that one. Thank you!"
JayBird9540,fe9guqg,t1_fe9b09j,"no problem! 

I wish I would have started doing it as a freshman. Only tip I can give you is to label your recording by class and day. It'll get confusing."
Dr_Beardsley,fe6qiqh,t3_enyftw,"It took me almost 6 years, but I was damn stubborn and got my diploma in 2018. It is possible! Some advice I learned the hard way:

1. Take advantage of the student disability services. All of it. Don't hesitate to ask for help.

2. Don't overwhelm yourself!! Plan your semesters realistically, reducing credit hours if need be.

3. Make friends with your professors. It helps so very dearly to have an ally when you aren't at 100%.

4. Remember every day why you are doing this, and know that you are a warrior with a vastly impressive record. You have survived the demon hordes that plague your mind every day. Organic Chemistry and Calculus will not be the end of you.


You are going to nail this!!!"
sortofzach,fe6y0o9,t1_fe6qiqh,"6 year gang! I’m going into my 6th year right now. Many many breakdowns that caused me to have to drop classes as well as a decision to transfer colleges in a mixed state, which added more time. 

OP, even if you don’t finish in 4 years, it’s fine! Not everyone can complete college in that time frame and there is nothing wrong with that, as long as you get there :)"
ladyfishbones,fe9ais9,t1_fe6qiqh,Thank you so much for this. You make an excellent point about the demon hoardes... I am definitely going to remember that in calculus. Math is not my strong suit and I am focused in science! Thank you for the tips.
Dr_Beardsley,fe9c6qm,t1_fe9ais9,"Absolutely, friend. Never forget it, not for one moment."
BloodyRedQueen9,fe6ewus,t3_enyftw,That’s so awesome!!!
meganross50,fe6g10h,t3_enyftw,Get it! Going to college has been a bit rocky but I refuse to give up! Bipolar can suck it.
degustibus,fe6lxm2,t1_fe6g10h,"I was going full manic before my last final exam of a long and winding academic career.  It was Christmas time and I fell the room was drab.  So I went to Costco and bought a lot of treats and Poinsettias.  Then I snuck some in, had classmates outside bring them in etc.., didn't want la maestra seeing me.  I hadn't slept much in a while and was unduly paranoid that I would fail out, but the night before in the library had calculated that even a low F on the Final and I'd pass the class!  This kicked me into a bizarre level of joy.  Which turned into spending and talking to strangers and distributing cash.  The test started and I could barely focus my eyes and stay still.  I wrote as many answers as I could really quickly.  Good, a passing test at least.  People were eating the food and as happy as you can be taking a final.  Story to be continued maybe.  Anyway TLDR, got A in class, was hospitalized forcibly within a week of that day."
FrontenacRacer,fe6h9b7,t3_enyftw,You got this! And we’re all with you on this!
EroticaFaktori,fe6qniy,t3_enyftw,"congrats!!! i went back to school to get a second bachelors a few years ago, then graduated magna cum laude and got hired for a full time job in my field before i graduated :) don't let anything stop you! take care of yourself and you will succeed!"
Walshy29,feaila6,t1_fe6qniy,What made you go back for another bachelor's? Just wondering. Thx. Do some jobs want you to have two?
EroticaFaktori,fecf139,t1_feaila6,"No, it just worked out that way for me. My first Bachelor's is in Biology and my second is in Imaging Science. The (two year) program I was in didn't require a bachelor's to be in, I just happened to have one already lol"
lagrangedanny,fe6vd52,t3_enyftw,"You got this, I graduated undiagnosed through some of the worst times of my life

Perservere and you'll succeed"
fufu2019,fe7387g,t3_enyftw,Well done! I am on my third attempt for a masters degree and I’m 30% done so just keep at it. I try and do as much as possible during manic episodes but also even 5 mins when you are dish don’t feel like it helps a lot
EtherealBipolar,fe79fh1,t3_enyftw,"I'm just waiting on my reference so I can apply funnily enough. 
Scared shitless."
ghotiphingers,fe8cj2f,t3_enyftw,You got this!
georgeyellow,fe8dpqa,t3_enyftw,so proud of you! you can do it. it’s so challenging but it’s possible. i go back for my 4th semester tomorrow. 4.0 so far. you totally got this.
Abbydactyl,fe8eesf,t3_enyftw,Congratulations!
myrainbowistoohigh,fe8f5lf,t3_enyftw,"YESSSS OP 🙌🏻 being undiagnosed bipolar really messed things up for me. I think a lot about how redeeming it would be to go back mentally healthy and do it all again. It's a huge accomplishment, you should feel proud!"
quentinchristmas,fe8k5o2,t3_enyftw,Good for YOU...i left college for years and went back finally got my degree...now I’m in grad school. If you can handle bipolar disorder you can handle college!
Ewalk,fe8n6js,t3_enyftw,Mine starts next week. I’m scared it’ll be like all the previous attempts and burn out halfway through the semester but I can’t keep treading water professionally.
CourtM092,fe8rqu1,t3_enyftw,"I can't wait until I'm in your shoes. I was in school a few years ago and fell into student loans default, working my way out now. I plan to go back to school to study Occupational Therapy Assistant.

What are you studying?"
ladyfishbones,fe99p1p,t1_fe8rqu1,"You can do it! I want to get my degree in earth science to start, still figuring where to go after that. I'm taking it one day at a time for now."
notsocooleden,fe8skr1,t3_enyftw,i failed 2 classes so far but you know what? I’m still trying and I won’t let bipolar get me down from following my dreams you shouldn’t either proud of you!!!
randomcacti,fe8sw52,t3_enyftw,You can do it. I spent 4 years working on my associates degree. I have one semester left and I WILL graduate. I dropped out twice and have a 4.0gpa. You can do this. Its doesnt matter how long it takes or if you have to take a break.
ladyfishbones,fe98w7a,t1_fe8sw52,This is what took me years to realize. I felt so much pressure in high school to finish that I felt like college was the same. Now that I'm older I feel like I can take my time and finish at my own pace. Congrats on your hard work!
MissVaultGal,fe8v4cu,t3_enyftw,"Still can't believe I made it through college during the onset of my bipolar. It sucked so bad. I wish I could have done better in school, but at least I made it. Good luck ❤"
justcallmemags,fe8wu8x,t3_enyftw,"Finished my
Bachelors off meds before I was diagnosed.  Hard but did it. Then 7 years later went to nursing school and had to stop
Because I got diagnosed.  Finished with meds. I am a pediatric nurse at a level one trauma center. Not bragging. Just saying. YOU CAN DO IT. if you stumble get back up and try again. YOU GOT THIS!"
TrashInspector69,fe8zlbc,t3_enyftw,Congratulations and good luck!!!! 🍀
aokureyon,fe92yia,t3_enyftw,"congrats to u!! i did the same! im back in college as well, first week done. its tough but we can do this!!!!! good luck!! wishing you the best"
darkmatterwhitenoise,fe95qoy,t3_enyftw,You can do it! I’m severely bipolar and ocd. All I heard all my life is that I couldn’t be a nurse. Went and got my associates degree in nursing and passed my boards straight out of high school and then went back while working full time and got my BSN. You can do it!!
CapnBat,fe9e1b3,t3_enyftw,"I finished too. One of my strategies I called the “head above water strategy,” where I figured out the minimum I could do while depressed (miss a few classes, complete required reading and homework to try to keep up). This worked well for me because I was motivated to work above and beyond when I was ok, so I could afford to dip when I needed too. Best of luck to you!!"
VitaGSure,fe9eh8e,t3_enyftw,Congratulations!!!
Budgiejen,fe6mdjm,t3_enyftw,Great!  What area of study?
HartofTX,fe6q5gr,t3_enyftw,"You can absolutely do it. Take care of yourself medically and get help when needed, and every one of us can live our best lives. I still have to pinch myself that I’ve had a good career and success. There are days where I don’t want to.... still. But it’s all a process and bipolar, if managed, can be a great gift, too. Here’s to your future!"
roxieane,fe6r9zr,t3_enyftw,congrats!!!
rusted-nail,fe6swk0,t3_enyftw,"Go you!!! I'm 27 and got diagnosed with type 2 last year, and finally doing something to better my life this year, going to be studying Law, what are you doing?"

_Aurilave,fe6v0gn,t3_enyftw,"Heck yes! That’s badass. 
I’m working up to that too!"

You'll find people better than you at things you like to do.
Don't let that get to you
Keep fighting!!"
timmiay,fe8cbl3,t3_enyftw,Make sure you know what you want to do in college. I wasted 7 years getting a bachelors. Its very expensive and i wish i knew what I wanted to do then and trying to figure it out during college is not a good idea
ladyfishbones,fe92fbw,t3_enyftw,"Thank you so much for all the support and advice posted here you guys, I really feel like I can do this now and you guys have brought it to a whole new level! I don't have a post to edit this onto but I figured I'd at least comment on here. Thank you so much, this community is great. So much love💕"
send_me_short_jokes,fe9s82t,t3_enyftw,"My grandmother who also suffers from mental illness told me this, and it completely changed my mindset. It’s helped me a lot, so if it’s okay I’d like to share it with you and everyone else. 

“You may have bipolar, but the bipolar does NOT have you.”  

Don’t let it control you and your life. Trust me, I know it’s a lot easier said than done. But if you can just push yourself to do something, even as simple as going to class, be proud of it. Doing a load of laundry. Reading your favorite book. Going outside for just a few minutes. Literally any small thing. You have defeated it a little just from that. Every small accomplishment is a win over our bipolar. And when you do, be PROUD! Hope this helps :)"

clauquick,feajcqr,t3_enyftw,Thank you for posting this. I’ve had such a difficult time applying for graduate school. This gave me a push.
ivorypanther,feajxst,t3_enyftw,That is such a brave thing to do! It’s going to be hard but it’ll be worth it! I believe in you 💓
yaboyblack,fealq1m,t3_enyftw,You got this! Baby steps are still steps forward!
strangergreens,feasgla,t3_enyftw,I was worried about going back whether I would be successful or not with being on medication.  Happy to report I made all A’s last semester!  My only advice is to take it slow.  I started with two classes then added a class with each semester.  If you work make sure to balance your schedule and give yourself enough time to do schoolwork and rest.
vwoodr1,fecevo1,t3_enyftw,Congrats!!! I was told I would never finish my undergraduate. I finished it and when on to get my masters. I was so determined to prove that I could do it that I never got below an A. You can do it. I came back stronger and more determined. I still wrestled with my mood but I wanted it.

Chaotic_Nerd,fdqekj3,t3_emp7i3,"I remember when I told one of my coworkers at the time I was diagnosed. I was looking for support because it was all new and scary for me at the time. I was met with ""...no your not"". Well excuse me for not dancing naked in the street, Linda. I thought nobody wanted to see that. People don't understand or appreciate how hard we try to contain it and fit in sometimes. They see us externally being fine and assume nothings wrong. They don't know is going on in our heads. Remember, when you assume you make an ass of u and me."
HanburryiTree,fdqyol5,t1_fdqekj3,This is why I don’t share my diagnosis with anyone who hasn’t seen it first hand. I never get a result in my benefit. And I got tired of being mad about it.

I used to hate hearing “no you’re not. I know people who are bipolar and you definitely are not”. 
I wish people would understand that we don’t all act the same or share the same symptoms. I am very good at hiding my symptoms unless I’m on my downward spiral from manic to depressive, then it’s obvious something is up with me."
MuffinMan12347,fdtu59k,t1_fdqekj3,"I told my ex best friend when I was 14 and suicidal that I was depressed. He just said “No you’re not, you have nothing to be sad about.” Thanks man, really needed to hear that, guess who I never confided in again?"

Chaotic_Nerd,fdqywm8,t1_fdqyol5,Yeah I had to learn that the hard way. ...I tend to learn a lot of things the hard way.
Chaotic_Nerd,fdryo7s,t1_fdrxs9l,"Yeah I had more than one person tell me that. It feels so invalidating. I'm the opposite though. My depressive episodes are easy to mask. I'm naturally reserved, so I have to be at my worst for it to be noticable. Stop making as many wisecracks, etc. I think its much more noticable when I'm heading manic, even just hypo. I talk more, become way less shy, and just generally want to engage with people more and thats not me. (...that sounds kind of terrible. but you know what I mean i hope)"
pixxiestix812,fds8iga,t1_fdrxs9l,Same. Got so many my ex’s brother was bipolar or someone’s sister so I know what that is and you definitely don’t have it.

TeaspoonOfSugar987,fduphde,t1_fdup5oi,"Exactly. The second time I did it I figured if they care about me enough they either have my phone number already or they know how to get it (all of my friends know my mum). Funnily I only had 3 people reach out to me while I was in hospital (that weren’t friends from church, I had LOTS of them come see me) and since then only 2 of them have actually stayed in contact.

Warm-Mayonnaise-,fdr5rie,t3_emp7i3,"I ended up having to tell my grandmother about my diagnosis a little bit ago, and over the holidays as our whole family is playing cards she says (loudly), “Are you sure about your bipolar? Maybe you need a second opinion”. Now she’s the only one I’ve told in this side of my family about my diagnosis. So she’s not only outed me in front of my whole family but questioned the validity of what I’ve gone through in the process. All because I just “seemed too normal”."

The_OtherE30,fe5erpb,t3_enqxzi,"I honestly applaud all of you who stick by their significant other while dealing with BP and MDD. 

My ex who is 18 suffers from MDD and BP and she left me in October as she couldn’t handle it anymore. I was the most loving and supportive boyfriend as well as her first. I was with her every single day while she was in the hospital after her attempted suicide in July of 2019.

It shattered my heart to have her leave me and act like she didn’t know me anymore, she flicked the switch on her feelings towards me so fast I couldn’t believe it. She was very emotionally unavailable as well witch caused issues. 

I wish things were different but it happened. I gave and I gave and I gave and in the end she turned on me and left me broken. But that’s okay. 


Anybody supporting their so that suffers from this devilish issue. I believe you’re extremely strong and have an amazing will power. 

Much love to all of you"
SillyCircusStinkers,fe5qdb5,t1_fe5erpb,"I feel for you and I understand what you had to go through. I cant imagine the pain my husband has had to experience and I'm suprised that he's willing to try and make things work out after what happened this past summer. My last manic episode lasted about six months. I literally threw away everything- leaving my husband to care for our daughter, run our business,  and also sell/buy our home. I went back to my home town and insisted that we get a divorce. I had no idea that I was unwell. I had no clue what bipolar really was. My husband read tons of thick books about bipolar, spoke with several therapists, and tried to get me to help. I refused for a very long time. When I got back it wasn't what I expected. He was incredibly hurt and has been questioning if he wants to be a care giver for the rest of his life. He's unsure if he wants to go though another episode. It's so hard because it's not my fault that I have this sickness but he also cares for me a whole lot. Being armed with knowledge, having a support system, and having an action plan in place is key. I also think making serious life style changes is crucial to managing symptoms.  I'm not sure what's going to happen, but for now we are together. And no matter what we will both be OK."

The_OtherE30,fe5r7i0,t1_fe5qdb5,My ex being 18 she’s in a very early stage in her life where things don’t make sense. She messed around with her medication and that caused issues after her time in the hospital. It just kills me to see someone love me and then leave me like nothing
The_OtherE30,fe5w5nv,t1_fe5si3h,"You’re very welcome, my ex taught me a lot about mental health as well as BP disorder as well as MDD, it came at an extremely heavy price but I’ve become a better person because of it.

We were sitting down talking about how I felt I might be bi-polar and all these emotions we both had and how we would figure our life and mental health out together.

justcallmemags,fe9eqz5,t1_fe9atx9,This first year of marriage I went through 8 med changes.  Finally found a combo that works. You can make it through anything. We went to couples therapy because we needed to work on communication. It helped a lot. I was depressed and tired all the time and she didn’t know when to push me. Our psychologist suggested saying “I’m at 20% today” which would let my wife know I can’t do a lot. It helps a lot. Communication is key.

iamianyouarenot,fdtggfd,t1_fdt3wwb,Thank you.  Seeing all the great work on here really inspired me to pick up a brush again.
Ricky_-_Spanish,fduit1z,t1_fdtggfd,Please don't put it back down.
bunnygirl_,fdt47gn,t3_en1nb9,This is absolutely stunning. Do you sell your work?
iamianyouarenot,fdtd40u,t1_fdt47gn,"I haven't in years.  I also haven't ""finished"" a piece in years either  After my last show I started feeling like I'd never make a living doing art, so I went super hard into my corporate gig.  I didn't realize until just recently how I was just cranking out the same crap and was completely ignoring why I do this in the first place.  So while I'm not opposed to selling, I don't really have much to sell just yet."
recklesscxnt,fdt6a30,t3_en1nb9,Mind blowing and extremely accurate 😩
AppleButterBerries,fdt9keq,t3_en1nb9,That's a lovely work of art

Yffre_Earthbones,fdtwxlj,t3_en1nb9,"Also have had a shit week. I see from other comments you haven't made art for some time, I hope you continue to find motivation to do so because this is some soul food for me right now. It's wonderful."

iamianyouarenot,fdw0j0d,t1_fdvq8kp,"Maybe someday.  For now, your comment is support enough."
nineteendoors,fdvr6de,t3_en1nb9,"This is a hauntingly beautiful portrayal of depression. I'm sorry you have been suffering but you were able to channel those feelings into an incredible piece of work. Wow. <3 <3 Hope you feel better soon, OP, but congrats on an awesome piece of art."
iamianyouarenot,fdwwcl6,t1_fdvr6de,"Thank you.  The response to this piece literally saved my life last night so I can't begin to thank you, and everyone else who commented, enough."

Subbeh,fdw2635,t3_en1nb9,DAE feel that there's a disproportionate amount of talent amongst Bi-polar sufferers?

PuzzleCorner,fdwqair,t3_en1nb9,"That's a really amazing picture. It really captures how I'm feeling today, so I'm sorry you've had this kind of week. To having a better next week, cheers."
PhD_noob_mutha,fdwwih3,t3_en1nb9,"holy crap, this is so good.  It reminds me a bit of Francis Bacon's work."
speedmaster3000,fdx36a4,t3_en1nb9,THIS IS DOPEEEE

gemmanii,fdxt55r,t3_en1nb9,This is incredible. My paintings during times like that often have a similar style in terms of the darkness and stroke style. But seriously. This is moving and encapsulating. Excellent job.

Izero_79,fdmlp6z,t1_fdmks0n,It’s perfectly fine. It’s already helped me:)
uppsalafunboy,fdmyxeg,t3_em44y3,"I know just how you feel, my little Moo dog has gotten me through the hardest times, when I was tapering off of Klonopin, his forever love and those dog walks kept me from killing myself. Now I'm tapering off of trileptal, thankfully he's still here for me. Tonight at the Largo theater in Los Angeles, I just saw the comedian Gary Gilman. Gulman has really struggled with depression and thought of suicide, his show the Great Depresh is on HBO. At the meet & greet after the show, I thanked him for not giving up and for giving me hope to go on and not give up, he gave me a really big hug which was such a heart warming surprise. while leaving I said I knew i Just needed to get my brain chemicals right & he said ""yes! It's not your fault! :) Before I left I Just wanted to thank you for being there for your pets. I started microdosing with marijuana again and looked at taking 400mg of SAM-e instead of 200 (I had been skipping my doses). Although my sleeping hours are bad (4am-130pm) I'm not super depressed like I was, the holidays get me down and it feels like a big weight has lifted. I'm sorry for sharing so much, just wanted to let you know that I care and I hope you feel better soon. Feeling better seems like a state of mind which will never return to us when we feel so low. thank you for being there for them so they can be there for you. Hope your new year improves soon. Wishing you all the best!! (Sorry for writing a lot)"

PennyLou24,fdmn70z,t3_em44y3,I believe in you! The depression is the worst! Pets are the best. Focus on taking care of them and it may help you start taking care of yourself.
kakaiviv123,fdmn841,t1_fdmn70z,"Will do that! Thanks for the advice, kind stranger!"
ekoozie,fdmne8t,t3_em44y3,My doctor asked me the other day when I was having suicidal thoughts if I could think of just 1 thing that would make me pause and think twice about actually killing myself. The answer: my dog. It would absolutely crush her if I just disappeared from her life. Sometimes that is the only thing keeping me going. Pets are the best! Hang in there!
kakaiviv123,fdmnfss,t1_fdmne8t,Oh my god. This made my eyes water! Let's both keep going!

missvalerina,fdpl8ur,t1_fdp9tz8,Might be a cross breed. My mau looked very similar but had the spots instead of the stripes.
purechiqi,fdndy7a,t3_em44y3,They were definitely plotting something there! You'll have to keep us posted on it.

gionnelles,fdky31h,t3_elw4r2,"That's a brilliant idea actually. I find drawing very soothing, but I'm a poor artist, and get stressed out by drawing objectively bad pictures. I could see this being very relaxing."
Yffre_Earthbones,fdky9pg,t1_fdky31h,"It's great. I love sitting at coffee shops but hate being absorbed into my own world so I sit and skim news papers and doodle these things. Give it a shot, it's really fun and you can get creative with it, I just stick in the lines lol"

Yffre_Earthbones,fdkmwyo,t1_fdkm4c1,Thank you :)
Superficial_Charm,fdkq2ww,t3_elw4r2,"It reminds me, in the best possible way, of cell-shaded cartoons such as 'Archer'.  I really dig this visual style."

PathToANewMe,fdko1fo,t3_elw4r2,I like it good work!
Yffre_Earthbones,fdkshpf,t1_fdko1fo,Thank you :)
lotsalaffz,fdlkhqi,t3_elw4r2,"Don't belittle your creativity. You definitely have talent. I'm curious about how it makes you feel while you're doing it. Is it calming and peaceful or inspire you in any other ways?

I'm also a little disappointed in myself because I have absolutely no newspaper in my house."
Yffre_Earthbones,fdm3jax,t1_fdlkhqi,"Thanks, you're right I shouldn't talk down on myself but it happens. A lot goes through my head when I'm doing this. It can be spurred by any emotion really. Most of the time I'm in this weird state of being bored and anxious, or sometimes very nervous. It helps me focus on simple things like lines, curves, and shading. It definitely bring some peace of mind because my brain stops running at a million miles an hour, and I feel good creating something unusual and interesting to look at. 

I'll share what this one was like.

Today I started off with football players in the sports section because I was really depressed and wanted to attack some thing I felt was better than me (unfair comparison but it's what I was feeling because I haven't been very physically active lately). Then I did some politicians because I was starting to have an emotional shift and was getting anxious, it felt good to mask those in seats of power.  Then I got caught up in thinking about asking this girl out, saw this rabbi and liked how big the image was and the composition of it, figured I could try to distract myself a bit to get less anxious.  I was in a very good mood while doing this one, and eventually got it in me to ask her to go to a David Bowie dance party tonight. She said she'd meet me there, which made me feel really good so then I posted this.  And now all of you are REALLY making me proud of my little sketches."
Shmaaakespeare,fdloguq,t3_elw4r2,"Don’t be fooled, a lot of professional artists do this, both for professional work and for practice. Some of the most beloved still life paintings were traced from photographs (or rather, traced from projections using an early version of the camera)

Either way this is lovely"
nimin2,fdm3t5h,t3_elw4r2,"This actually looks really thoughtfully made, I like the vibe."

Yffre_Earthbones,fdkxv2g,t1_fdkxhi5,UwU
BLOMBOMB,fdlrhfg,t3_elw4r2,"Wow, what an amazing way to practice! You do a great job with it too, btw. I think I'll try this one day."
Yffre_Earthbones,fdm2kjd,t1_fdlrhfg,Do it! It's really relaxing and gives you something simple to focus on when your manic little brain is going too fast for the rest of the world
BLOMBOMB,fdm2to9,t1_fdm2kjd,Can relate.. I'm running out of things to deep clean in my house and will need something like this to do lol
Yffre_Earthbones,fdm3p4y,t1_fdm2to9,It's great because you can nix the creativity and just focus on copying over it like a coloring book. Or you go wild and really change things. And it doesn't matter what you do because it's just an old newspaper with some scribble that you can recycle when all is said and done.
willowpickleweed,fdkp4cs,t3_elw4r2,I love it!!!

Yffre_Earthbones,fdm23q6,t1_fdm1k6o,"I had that thought, a friend suggested I make an instagram account for it and I just might do that. I've made hundreds of these and was just feeling good about it today so decided to share"

ControlAlice,fdm7ims,t3_elw4r2,This a really good idea. I get the urge to draw too but am too anxious to try drawing something on my own. Ill have to try this next time!!

BornAgainRedditGuy,fdzgxev,t3_eng9ha,I'm planning on posting everything I cook on here as a way to help encourage myself to cook more instead of eating frozen pizzas whenever I eat.
BigRpp,fdzpt51,t1_fdzgxev,That's a good idea. I got instantly inspired by this post. I'm always so jealous of all the wonderful drawings and paintings on here and I have zero talent in that area so I just get discouraged. But this is a wonderful idea. I also would like to try eating better. I cant wait to see what's up next!
IrkedCupcake,fdzqt6o,t1_fdzgxev,Please do because this looks delicious!
trollfucker69,fe061sn,t1_fdzgxev,I can send you a recipe for tortellini soup that my mom makes whenever I’m sick. It’s super good!
SweatyCouchlete,fdzhm2n,t3_eng9ha,That just made me really hungry. Looks good!
suicideDenver,fdztl0f,t3_eng9ha,Thanks for the inspiration and reminder to cook for myself. :)
nastrals,fe1lb02,t3_eng9ha,"This looks great. For those that struggle to eat Can I suggest investing in a slow cooker. My boyfriend has bipolar and just doesn’t often feel hungry and won’t eat all day if I’m not in. So being the sneaky girlfriend I am I put the slow cooker on in the morning. I just chuck meat, veg, beans and healthy things in with some herbs and gravy then he spends the day smelling it cook. Often when I get home from work he’s had a portion already as the smells trigger him to eat."
FaintingWhiteGirl,fe3eiqe,t1_fe1lb02,You sound like an awesome person. Good on you for recognizing an issue and finding a solution.

BornAgainRedditGuy,fdzwrza,t1_fdzpxhi,"I didn't really follow a recipe aside from some instructions, I just threw in what I thought would taste good haha.

Edit: But I did decide to put Worcestershire and malt vinegar in it and that added a ton of flavor."

Ashley777,fe0iuda,t3_eng9ha,"Oh man, during my last manic thing I made a stew that my family devoured. It's usually just my daughter and me, but her dad ate with us and they both ate so much that I only had enough for her lunch the next day and a bowl for my lunch. I usually have to throw away like 1/4 of big meals like this. Felt like a win."
Adri-M,fe0jhm4,t3_eng9ha,I love stew.
pipsnag,fe0lpa8,t3_eng9ha,"Looks like a nice stew. Can recommend you check out some of the Hungarian stews like Gulyás - there's a lot of different varieties. Think you'd enjoy something like a babgulyás (similar to your stew but with beans).

Other nice comfort foods are different fözelék. Check out a simple tökfőzelék."

BornAgainRedditGuy,fe2eaxs,t1_fe1hz0m,I seared the meat but didn't think to add the flour until the end. Still came out the same though.

projectxplode,fe1vzh6,t3_eng9ha,"That looks so good! Also, I don’t know if you like anime/Disney but they make themed cookbooks that has helped me stay motivated, I made rice balls the other day! I’m going to try making the gray stuff from beauty and the beast next"

Lycalopex_,feaq813,t1_feagdox,Thanks! That’s a good idea!
Hild2018,febziuh,t3_eo9xly,"Please don't plan on these as a permanent income.

They are perfectly lovely,  WONDERFUL, but as someone who does crochet fur over 30 years,  you cannot make a living at it. 

Sell them as a hobby, and make a name for yourself.  And sell high, your time is worth way more than materials."
hotstepperog,fec1pvv,t3_eo9xly,Don’t leave uni. Do both and just expand the business after uni. Make as many friends as you can at uni. Especially ones from different countries.
chuckit7642,feaui8k,t3_eo9xly,I would buy this if you set up a shop
scibaddiwad,febxwl2,t1_feaui8k,I three would buy!!
Lycalopex_,feb19p6,t1_feaui8k,I’m starting a shop on instagram. But uni take most of my time so is difficult make a huge number of those for sale:(
ShiekZe,feaxxlb,t1_feaui8k,Yeah me too you could do a little Etsy shop and only sell what you want to put out. That would be some nice money on the side. Plus well done👌🏻 like it’s so cute 😭

bleeding_stars,feav9ym,t3_eo9xly,Wow! You are really talented! She is so adorable!
mustbelasttobefirst,febdbmu,t3_eo9xly,Sounds like a manic business decision.
QueenKellers,febp49j,t1_febdbmu,"I started a dog boarding business once while manic. Business cards, PayPal account, card reader, you name it. It took off a lot better than expected and now I don’t want to do it anymore. OP, think carefully before starting a business. 

Super freaking adorable though and I want 12."
squirrellinawoolsock,fec3h7p,t1_febdbmu,"I have these almost every time I’m manic. Taking up (legit) professional photography, startup ad agency, marketing consulting services, painting, just to name a few. I invested thousands into businesses that I lost energy and motivation to pursue when I was no longer manic.

My career that I got from earning my degree has been constant and helps provide the stability I need when it’s rough.

Sometime hobbies are left as hobbies and small side businesses for some extra income instead of trying to pursue them as full time sources of income. Especially when there will be times where motivation and discipline are lacking."
scibaddiwad,feby613,t1_febdbmu,Almost every day I wonder if my decision to come to grad school was one of those mania induced and I guess I’ll never know 🥴
RalphTheWonderLlamma,feci3ov,t1_febp49j,Have you considered selling the business?

MicheleCha,feb9p6o,t3_eo9xly,That would be so cool too if you could do like video game characters. You should start an etsy!!
borrowingfork,feba13a,t3_eo9xly,"You're really good! If you seriously think about selling them, my friend has done that and she says that for the time put into them she doesn't get much money back. There are so many commercial amigarumi around now that people don't want to spend much money on them. So maybe think of something that people can't get already - like pet portraits like the other commenter mentioned.

If you decide to leave school to do this, at least do some maths to figure out how many you would need to make and sell each week to pay the bills."
Lycalopex_,febexlj,t1_feba13a,Yeah I think that maybe it’s not a good idea but I want to do this all day SO BADLY. Uni and exams period take most of my time so I can barely do one of this in one week. Also I’m from
snapplesauce123,fecbgz2,t1_febexlj,"The amigurumi you made there is very adorable! but I'm sure making them all day would get old, and it probably would not make you a stable income. It may seem like a good idea at the moment, but I would strongly suggest letting this idea sit for a while before you make any huge decisions."
broomecamel,febflfr,t3_eo9xly,Adorable 😊❤️
dogmomandauntie,febkeqb,t3_eo9xly,I would buy those for my nephews! So awesome. Maybe you could take some business classes if you decided to stay in uni... regardless you are super talented.
Semisupercentenarian,febove9,t3_eo9xly,"Wow that's amazing, well done!"
chickenpants80,fec1m4r,t3_eo9xly,I'm a crocheter and those amigurumis are hard!! You've definitely got a knack for them. Crochet has been a calming hobby for me too.

Glittering-Entrance,fecaozu,t3_eo9xly,That thing is fucking cute. And looks very well crafted. Nice job. Try to sell them!
6six6nine,fecbjwc,t3_eo9xly,It’s so precious 😭
jupiterrose_,feclos8,t3_eo9xly,"I've been crocheting for 10 years and the profit margin on selling these guys are horrifically low. Including cost of materials you're lucky to make more than $2/hour. You're competing with China, as well as almost everyone thinking they are way less valuable than they actually are. The market is also absolutely flooded. You could not make a living on this, you'd be lucky if it would pay for groceries. They are amazing to make for yourself, friends, birthdays, christmas, baby showers, you name it. And sometimes you'll get lucky and a friend will ask for a commission, and be willing to pay you kind of okay! But please for the love of god don't leave college for this. It would be the worst mistake of your life."
veeveedeebts,feclq6i,t3_eo9xly,Take my monies
adaptiveagile,feclw6z,t3_eo9xly,Totally adorable. Love it.
YourSkatingHobbit,fecpo52,t3_eo9xly,So cute! I also crochet; I find it so unbelievably cathartic. I’d love to do amigurumis but I’ve tried a couple times and just don’t seem to have the patience. I mostly make dice bags for DnD/TTRPGs.

Dont_sniff,fdkshe5,t1_fdkoy91,I naturally am creative and gain skill quickly when working with different medium.   It's more of a mental battle when coming to my art.  I'm never satisfied after.   I lose motivation to do anything when I'm depressed.   I throw out everything I make and the only ways I can look back is with pictures or if family keeps it.  I have an Instagram to kinda keep track of progress and phases because I can appreciate it from time to time.

loudflower,fdlxiql,t1_fdl0cmn,Thanks. Abilify made me wired (uncomfortably so). Interesting. Glad it's doing you good (except for fatigue).
justcallmemags,fdlxl8b,t1_fdlxiql,Weird. It is good for my mood but not my appetite. :/ and I zone out on it. I’ve been zoning out on every med I try except vraylar.
mish92,fdhhkda,t3_elf0sh,Yay! I didn't see your other post but glad you got those this morning! I love my Vraylar!
newprofilewhodis1352,fdhpicy,t3_elf0sh,Ahh I love vraylar. It’s kept me stable a whopping 4 years almost. Great med!
racheld119,fdhoe7d,t3_elf0sh,Man I started this last week and it made me way too tired like I couldn’t function. I hope it works for you!!
gentle_but_strong,fdidq2f,t1_fdhoe7d,The tiredness goes away after a few weeks!
racheld119,fdikal9,t1_fdidq2f,"I couldn’t hang 😭 I have 3 kids and all I wanted to do was sleep, i thought maybe it would get better but i just couldn’t wait."
justcallmemags,fdl0eg5,t1_fdikal9,"Same with me!! Did you take it in am
Or pm?"
racheld119,fdl0qo7,t1_fdl0eg5,I took it at night!
justcallmemags,fdl0uof,t1_fdl0qo7,Thanks. I’m re trying it and taking it in am. When I took it at night it made me so exhausted. Congrats on being bipolar with 3 kids!!! That’s my dream but I’m worried I’ll never find the right combo. Hoping vraylar in am with adderall will keep me awake.
racheld119,fdl264y,t1_fdl0uof,"Let me know how it goes taking in the am, if you ever think of it. I’m also prescribed adderall and even taking vraylar at night and adderall in the day it didn’t help at all- while normally adderall does! It curbs my appetite a ton too."
SUPREME_DONG,fdhvi7y,t3_elf0sh,Watch out for Akathisia.... just got taken off Vraylar for that reason.
acrowsong,fdhyfvx,t1_fdhvi7y,Same.
easypeasy7,fdiz82h,t1_fdhyfvx,Same. 😞
Bubblegum-N-Orgasms,fdhshbu,t3_elf0sh,Vraylar did nothing but give me terrible akathesia. I hope it works better for you. Awesome that you’re trying though xo
acrowsong,fdhyewi,t3_elf0sh,Congrats! I wish you all the luck I DIDN'T have with Vraylar. It sounds like a miracle to a lot of people!
imnellay,fdhx1we,t3_elf0sh,ahh! i just started taking mine! i do have take mine in the evening as it makes me so exhausted when i took it in the morning. hope everything goes well for you! ☺️
_wrennie,fdi9a43,t1_fdhx1we,I have to take mine in the morning because it keeps me awake all night. Isn’t it crazy how differently meds can affect different people?
lysealoo,fdibrvr,t1_fdi9a43,I also have to take it in the morning because I'll be up all night. That is crazy it does that differently to others.
pringlescanofemotion,fdi9ic6,t3_elf0sh,My insurance stopped covering it and I that shit is like $1200!!! Thankfully my psych hooks it up with the samples 😭 🙏
redsetded,fdicqqy,t1_fdi9ic6,Even with a coupon card your insurance won’t cover it?
gentle_but_strong,fdidnlh,t3_elf0sh,I fucking loved Vraylar. But it gave me blurry vision and I couldn’t drive anymore. Currently unmedicated...yippee
struggles3cuddles,fdhs8lt,t3_elf0sh,The best!
Beemoeee,fdhu83e,t3_elf0sh,I’m on 4.5 mg of Vraylar and absolutely love it! It’s been a total godsend for me. ☺️ Hope it works well for you!
dfinneman,fdi9jgh,t3_elf0sh,"Love you, keep hanging I. There friend."
redsetded,fdicp97,t3_elf0sh,I just started Vraylar today. I hope it is a good fit.
mash_potate,fdiqpdf,t3_elf0sh,"I’ve been on 1.5 mg of vraylar for about 6 months and it’s the only thing that’s helped with my BPII. I just came off lamictal and I’m doing well, hoping to come off lithium soon too and just be on the vraylar. I hope it makes a big difference for you too!

In case it’s helpful, here are the side effects I’ve experienced and how I’ve dealt with them:
- I had really bad nausea but it helped to take it at night and with food. This went away after about a month or so.
- Drowsiness, also helped by taking it at night and also went away after a month.
- I started to get akathisia about 3-4 months in. It was keeping me up at night so I started taking Benadryl which helped. Eventually I switched to taking it in the morning. I still get mild akathisia but it’s manageable.
- MAJORLY increases appetite, I constantly felt like I was STARVING for the first 2 months. My appetite kinda returned to normal but I occasionally have periods of an insatiable appetite. I’ve gained about 25 lbs since I started vraylar which is probably the worst side effect for me but the benefits are worth it to me, especially now that the weight gain has slowed down. I’ve been doing intermittent fasting (either 16:8 or 18:6) some days which is helping me get control of my appetite.

Your experience may differ of course, but hopefully this will help if you have some of these side effects. Best of luck!"
justcallmemags,fdl0kuc,t1_fdiqpdf,I was on this for 6 months and gained 2 pounds loved it but it made me too tired.
thisbe42,fdhzhcd,t3_elf0sh,"Good luck! I love my Vraylar, it's the first thing that's actually made me stable."
homieskilllet,fdi7eoo,t3_elf0sh,Been taking vraylar for 2 months now and I love it! Once you get through the tiredness/sleep deprivation it’s seriously a wonder drug.
_wrennie,fdi9gsf,t3_elf0sh,Vraylar has been a big help for me. I take 200mg of Lamictal daily and 1.5mg of Vraylar every 3 days. I’m finally getting functional again!
puente593,fdibnph,t3_elf0sh,Vraylar actually gave me very bad nausea! But I’m glad it’s working for you
mantis_tobagan_md,fdihcsp,t3_elf0sh,"Glad we could help yesterday, and I hope those meds help you feel better soon!"
Koloosey,fdijpc1,t3_elf0sh,Just started this last night. 10 min later projectile vomit...so far tonight ive had everything down for at least a half hour. Feeling ok. Good luck!
IrelandPearl,fdikjfw,t3_elf0sh,I love vraylar! It's the only medication I've been on that made me feel normal.
Switzerland87,fdimcc2,t3_elf0sh,Welcome to team Vraylar! I love that drug!
loudflower,fdims9g,t3_elf0sh,"Glad you got it, and hope it does right by you. 

&#x200B;

Eta, oh hey, it's you! You said I could have some melon. Hope you're feeling better soon!"
BraidedMoonseed,fdit3kz,t3_elf0sh,I LOVE vraylar
Engelshatz,fdiwolg,t3_elf0sh,i was excited for vraylar but then they with insurance it would have still been $80 a box.
notbillnye_,fdj0vrl,t3_elf0sh,been taking this for about two weeks now and i feel so much better and more stable :)
Twallot,fdj68w1,t3_elf0sh,"I love the Vraylar commercials (I'm Canadian but we still see them). It's always made me think they at least understand bipolar disorder. I don't think it's available here, though."
Elidove,fdja55j,t3_elf0sh,Woo!! I LOVE vraylar and I hope you have a lot of success with it! Keep up the amazing work ❤️
One_Gate,emcq9h,top_level,
TranZeitgeist,fdnrequ,t3_emcq9h,S-sunlight and exercise? I am doomed.
adydurn,fdodmzx,t1_fdnrequ,"Ahh, a fellow Brit. o/"
mantis_tobagan_md,fdoqgs7,t1_fdnrequ,"New Englander here, what is this sun you speak of? Lol

Lamictal seems to be popular, anyone here have experience with that vs Seroquel?"
bog-body,fdnzaax,t1_fdnrequ,Same lol
radiolovesgaga,fdonpuz,t1_fdnrequ,I live in Seattle. Bye y’all.
a_meninadanca,fdovqdr,t1_fdoqgs7,"I've never taken Seroquel but Lamictal was literally a magic pill that made the low lows much more infrequent. Also, I just moved out of Boston after living there for 7 years. I always tell people that it wasn't really the cold that got me (although I have certainly complained about it) but its the DARKNESS. It's so gloomy and grey all the time and then the sun sets at 3:45pm during the winter. I got the hell out of there as soon as my SO got a job elsewhere and my mood, functionality, outlook, everything has increased dramatically. Not that I'm suggesting you move away, I just wanted to share my experience with Lamictal + merciless New England winters :) Godspeed!"
Gaynicorn2,fdp1ofd,t1_fdoqgs7,"I take both. Seroquel at night to help with sleep and lamictal in the mornings. The combination is perfect for me. If I don’t sleep, I go absolutely batshit manic so the seroquel is extremely helpful for that. I’m on a relatively low dose of both. 

Also, as a former New Englander who now lives in the Pacific Northwest, I have no idea what this sun people speak of is.

Edit: seroquel really helps with the highs, lamictal helps with the lows."
EarlHot,fdp0m9e,t1_fdoqgs7,"I take lamictal as a mood stabilizer and Seroquel as a sleep aid. My psych prescribed me to take both pills at night and it's really helped me. I actually sleep now and I'm more stable. Seroquel makes me feel high and want to eat sugar and definitely too impaired to operate machinery lol. Lamictal on the other hand is  sort or dulling but not too much, I hear it's much more mild than Lithium and has less side effects. I think lamictal effects my memory a bit though but I smoke weed a lot anyway because I can't take an antidepressant."
peanutbutterfascist,fdoulo1,t1_fdoqgs7,"Never taken seroquel but lamictal with topamax works great for me (topamax really only needed to take care of the migraines lamictal gives me).  Add in some latuda to get my brain to shut up now and then and I'm golden.

But of course I had to switch doctors and my new one has backed my lamictal and topamax off to 50mg a day and refuses to prescribe me latuda so I'm having a great time."
rumoursaretrue,fdow2qj,t1_fdoqgs7,Also from New England! I am currently on both of them (paired with weekly therapy and regimented sleep) and I have never been happier and more stable in my life
latinswing,fdoow0a,t1_fdonpuz,Work overnights. Light therapy lamp for the win!
LagerthaLanarkshire,fdpbr2b,t1_fdonpuz,Same. What’s sun?
mantis_tobagan_md,fdox3iu,t1_fdovqdr,"Yes, the winters are tough here. The long summer days can be a problem for me as well. My sleep routine gets thrown off when it’s light out till 9pm and the suns up at 4 lol. Some day I’ll retire somewhere further south, I love a steady 12/12 light, like you get in the tropics. Odd, but it’s something I notice that has an impact on me."
mantis_tobagan_md,fdp2x4i,t1_fdp1ofd,"That’s good to hear, sleeps crucial for me as well. The lows are where I’m struggling, I think I’ll ask the doc what he thinks about starting lamictal- it’s overwhelmingly recommended. 

Hilarious username btw 😂"
hunkydory45,fdpfqtr,t1_fdp1ofd,I'm on both too! Only 50mg of lamictal so far.
flight0fgulls,fdzlj9d,t1_fdoulo1,"Oh man I was on Latuda when they were still doing trial runs and it was rough. Definitely had the opposite affect for me than it did for you, so bogus your doctor refuses to prescribe it though!"
mantis_tobagan_md,fdoxf1d,t1_fdow2qj,"Interesting. Do you mind if i ask the routine? I currently take lithium 3x daily and 100mg seroquel at night. I do get sleepy from the seroquel, which is great at night but I can’t take it and function during the day. I’ve been struggling a bit lately and  I’m thinking of asking my doc to make some changes."
radiolovesgaga,fdop06d,t1_fdoow0a,I take vitamin D supplements and that does its best. Haha!
a_meninadanca,fdp04s3,t1_fdox3iu,"You're totally right—either extreme makes it really hard to have any kind of regular schedule. I wonder if it's because Bipolar Disorder makes one have trouble with sustaining healthy sleep patterns. If the world itself keeps a relatively consistent schedule with half daylight and half darkness, maybe that will inspire our circadian rhythms to sync. Just a theory!"
Gaynicorn2,fdqnbc3,t1_fdp2x4i,"Yes, lamictal saved my life. Good luck in finding the right combo!

And thank you 😊"
rumoursaretrue,fdp0jc7,t1_fdoxf1d,"Sure! 100mg Seroquel at night and 200mg lamictal at night as well. I always get about 8-9 hours of sleep. I eventually got used to the grogginess in the morning from the seroquel. It should be noted that I have BP2. It also took me 4 years to finally get to meds that work for me, the trial and error of it all sucked and I ended up in the hospital twice from side effects of other meds that didn’t work. I hope you find something that works for you!!"
EarlHot,fdp0u6x,t1_fdoxf1d,I say try lamictal once daily. You might experience headaches as you titrate up to a therapeutic dose. Just my 2 cents
Sonya10a,fdnzh0h,t3_emcq9h,"This is really interesting, thanks for sharing. Can confirm, regular sleep schedule is like over 50% of the battle for me."
Mad-Engr,fdo2zkg,t1_fdnzh0h,I would agree to the same.   Sleep and stress are my battles/triggers. However being a parent of young children doesn't make those easy to manage.
FatGuyOnAMoped,fdo76ej,t1_fdnzh0h,THIS.  Once I got diagnosed and treated for sleep apnea it improved my moods immensely.  That along with maintaining a regular bedtime ritual has made things a lot easier.
BoobeusHagrid,fdnuz0b,t3_emcq9h,"Can confirm the small, frequent snacks. I live by the Hobbits’ eating schedule: breakfast, second breakfast, elevensies, luncheon, tea, etc. I notice a drastic shift in my overall well-being if I don’t eat small portions throughout the day."
mish92,fdobypn,t1_fdnuz0b,Same! Whenever I don’t I’m just not ok.
Logbia7k,fdoiln4,t1_fdnuz0b,I am going to try this and see if it helps me 😀
collwhere,fdogsc3,t1_fdnuz0b,"I know that too, but I am terrible at it. How do you guys do it? What is your go to?"
One_Gate,fdolewt,t1_fdnuz0b,I remembering having skipped breakfast and lunch and feeling like I was starting to feel manic. I ate something and the feeling went away within 20 min. It was very strange that I just seemed to snap out of it so quickly. I’ve noticed it happen a couple of other times. It’s interesting to see that other people find food has such a significant effect.
QUEEN_OF_THE_QUEEFS,fdosp6z,t1_fdnuz0b,Me too! I eat small amounts all day and it really helps.
Jesskah6,fdoij5i,t1_fdogsc3,I have a food tracking app. It keeps me cognizant of what I am eating and when. You can also set alarms on your phone for snack time! It is so helpful! I feel sooo much more in control of myself doing this!
Hlrzzru2000,fdonpxa,t1_fdolewt,Me too!
collwhere,fdoiuqa,t1_fdoij5i,But what do you usually eat? (that's the hard part for me... choosing what to eat)
Jesskah6,fdoj3jf,t1_fdoiuqa,"Hard boiled eggs
Popcorn
Yogurt
Cheese sticks
Clementines
Apples and peanut butter
Kind bars
Nuts

These are my go-to snack foods. They are easy."
BoobeusHagrid,fdoqihx,t1_fdoiuqa,"An example of my day: I usually have cereal or yogurt and a banana for breakfast, granola bar and string cheese for morning snack, sandwich, apple, celery sticks and small dessert at lunch, cottage cheese and fruit or granola bar for afternoon snack, then dinner! :) I don’t eat anything after 7:00 PM because I get indigestion. Hope that helps!"
collwhere,fdojkt5,t1_fdoj3jf,I like every single thing you listed except for the bars. I'll get some stuff and try for a week. What app do you use?
Jesskah6,fdojoym,t1_fdojkt5,I use “Lose it” it is free. And it gives you calorie goals if you care about that stuff.
DrummerJedi,fdo3tjg,t3_emcq9h,Each person will have different things that make them feel better. I think a good takeaway from this is that certain lifestyle changes such as exercise and regimented sleep can be more effective than you might think in tandem with prescribed medication and therapy.
One_Gate,fdnpanh,t3_emcq9h,"This came out in 2013 but I just found it and thought it was surprising/interesting. It’s just self-reported information from 301 participants. Interesting tidbits:

* Only drug reported as effective was Lamotrigine.
* Lifestyle changes were reported as being even more effective than drugs. (exercising, reducing alcohol intake, and defined sleep schedules)
* Least effective were popular treatments like Prozac, Wellbutrin, anti-depressants

ZamielVanWeber,fdode3k,t1_fdnpanh,"Funny, because lamictal was absolutely non effective for me. Then again I have schizoaffective so they could be the culprit."
princess_littlebear,fdp0lva,t1_fdode3k,"Same... It didn't do anything for me PLUS I'm very, very allergic"

RoslynMusic,fdnya4w,t3_emcq9h,Lamictal made me worse
hmwith,fdoa9k5,t1_fdnya4w,"How so? I'm on it, so I'd like to hear more about your experiences if you're willing to share."
R0botDad,fdoffft,t1_fdnya4w,"Lamictal was a double edged sword for me personally.  It took away all of my anxiety.  As in, literally it made me feel incredible.  However, it also made me dramatically more irritable, and aggressive.  My wife says the person I was on Lamictal almost drove us to a divorce."
FatGuyOnAMoped,fdo7cbu,t1_fdnya4w,Me too.  I was on it for a brief while but it screwed me over bad.
birdzillla,fdodcvj,t1_fdoa9k5,I’m curious as well
pennybeagle,fdov2hk,t1_fdoffft,I feel so lucky that Lamictal works so well for me (along with Cymbalta/Wellbutrin)... It’s nice to have some stability and better ability to control myself when I’m in an up or down swing. I wish it worked for everyone just the same 😢
wellbutrin_witch,fdovtsu,t3_emcq9h,disappointed but not surprised. yet another harmful piece of propaganda from Big Sunlight.
Elizial-Raine,fdo62vv,t3_emcq9h,"What a load of bull 90% of medications aren't effective, I wouldn't be alive without mine. Yes other things supplement medication and help your mental health but this is ridiculous.

I'd be interested to see how they ran this study was everyone on the study taking medication, was there a control group taking no medication, was there a group just doing excercise. Etc This sounds incredibly subjective to me. If everyone on the study was already on medication then obviously things like doing excercise are going to make more of a noticeable difference."
giroth,fdo7f39,t1_fdo62vv,"I believe it's just a survey, not a controlled study."
FatGuyOnAMoped,fdo7u2e,t1_fdo62vv,It looks like this whole study was done based on 23andMe participants who also self-reported they had bipolar disorder.  Not exactly hard science.  It wouldn't pass muster if it was submitted for publication in a medical journal.
GL00P,fdoe1zq,t1_fdo62vv,">This sounds incredibly subjective to me

It really is, they asked people if they thought the ''treatments'' were effective

&#x200B;

Edit  : that being said, I do like small frequent snacks :D"
chief-ares,fdob9ai,t1_fdo62vv,"I agree.

Just willing myself out of bed is still a big chore when depressed - and that small will wouldn’t have been possible without a few therapists. Exercise? That’s like going to the moon when depressed - it’s not happening.

Sleep schedules? Well too much sleep when depressed and too little sleep when hypomanic. There’s no setting a sleep schedule when my brain doesn’t care."
One_Gate,fdom89c,t1_fdo62vv,It’s just self reported.  But SSRIs have never been shown to have an effect on people with bipolar disorder. They do have a significant placebo effect. 40% if I remember correctly which is significant. So they’re still worth taking in many cases.
Ramiel01,fdpjx40,t1_fdo62vv,"Lithium

Not effective

amethysst,fdohc0z,t3_emcq9h,Treatment is multifaceted - it takes meds + exercise + diet. Even just stretching and not eating fast food is helpful.
mrak_,fdo7sev,t3_emcq9h,Can attest to effectiveness of this online group at least! Also tracking mood (Daylio for me) has been surprisingly helpful.
vh1classicvapor,fdo3iy8,t3_emcq9h,"Couldn’t disagree more. Abilify has been really effective with me, on top of Wellbutrin and Lamictal.

If these are supposedly the cures, why didn’t my half-marathons, vegan diet, and marijuana manage my unmedicated symptoms?

And fuck yoga. Anyone who tells me yoga would help me is full of woo. It’s painful to me, and no yoga class I’ve been to wants to take the time to teach me. One class was for “beginners” and they had us doing crow’s pose (a very difficult maneuver) at the end of it."
amethysst,fdogy9y,t1_fdo3iy8,Yoga classes can be kind of weird or unwelcoming. I like to just practice at home. It’s freeing and I feel connected to my self and body and can do what feels good.
stabwound666,fdogbhq,t1_fdo3iy8,"Yeah I take lamictal, abilify, and Wellbutrin as well and it’s been the best combo for me so far, after a lot of trial and error.  I had a doctor tell me to go vegan to combat a manic episode once. That was the last time I saw that doctor."

Get medicated, people."
CoreCorg,fdo6s1r,t1_fdo3iy8,"Completely agree with you. Used to eat way more healthy food and exercise a ton, I felt like shit. Since then life has become busier so I've helped my body out less in regards to exercise and eating well, and I drink more. But now I take wellbutrin and Abilify. I feel a million times better. I should probably try healthy lifestyle AND meds, but I know for sure that personally the meds are most of the battle"
vh1classicvapor,fdokek1,t1_fdogy9y,I can see that. I think a lot of people get peace from yoga. It’s just not a cure for bipolar disorder and I hate when people tell me it is
willowpickleweed,fdo8588,t1_fdo4wre,"I feel this. For some weird reason I feel a huge deal of dysphoria any time I’m manic, I’m not trans (?) but I can’t even look in the mirror for days at time... let alone yoga..."
ServingHumblePie,fdojgb3,t1_fdo4wre,"Could you describe how you meditate? If you’re still grasping to the idea of hating your body, your mindfulness isn’t on the right track.  Meditation is to help you loosen your grip of these ideas."
Trouve_a_LaFerraille,fdp7tks,t1_fdo7ro9,Mindfulness is actually dope (ymmv of course) if used complementary with meds. Reiki on the other hand is proper magic.

Sure sleep would improve my moods but I can’t sleep when i am depressed and I can’t sleep when I’m manic and i can’t will my brain to change that. The only thing that helps is medication to stabilize my moods. I get tired of people acting like I can just change my lifestyle choices and I would be all better.

hamilthrowaway,fdohxcq,t3_emcq9h,"Reduce caffeine  
It’s a no from me."
OCDexter23,fdo5nu5,t3_emcq9h,Latuda????
frozeninmind,fdo9jbd,t1_fdo5nu5,Latuda was honestly the best medication I ever took but it was so expensive that I couldn’t afford to stay on it.
peanutbutterfascist,fdowi4p,t1_fdo5nu5,"From other comments, the data for this is from before latuda was out"
peanutbutterfascist,fdoweko,t1_fdo9jbd,"Tell me about it... had to switch doctors and my new one refuses to prescribe it because she doesnt want to do a prior authorization... my old one is good until 2099.

It's how about geodon... umm, as already discussed I'm very allergic to it hence why I had no problem getting the prior authorization for latuda.

I wish there wasnt such a shortage of pdocs."
One_Gate,fdoet70,t1_fdo9jbd,"I loved how I felt, mentally, on Latuda. I had to switch to Lamotrigine because latuda gave me severe muscle restlessness. 

It was kind of frustrating but this chart makes me feel better. :P"
dappertransman,fdo783b,t3_emcq9h,Sleep thing ain't happening. Exercise... I have fibromyalgia so it's not that simple. I am on Lamictal though.
msilk,fdo8vg6,t3_emcq9h,"I’m surprised Seroquel isn’t higher and that Depakote is so low, along with Abilify and Risperdal. All great anti-manic agents for me in the past. And Seroquel is my lifeline, among a couple others. It definitely paints a picture that meds are ineffective when compared to other modalities of management."
swimmergurl227,fdorul6,t1_fdo8vg6,It's a survey with a pretty small sample size.
leetlepingouin,fdobelx,t3_emcq9h,I did not know gabapentin was prescribed for bipolar.  That doesn't make sense to me.
ToastBusters21,fdodvbc,t1_fdobelx,"It's often prescribed as a secondary prescription in mood stabilization, not usually the primary. It's good for supplementation, not strong enough to stand on its own. Gabapentin and topomax are the two I've encountered that are like that - when I was in treatment, a lot of the people who were on gabapentin for mood were using it in conjunction with treatment for alcoholism, due to its ability to stop cravings, or were also using it for pain relief."
R0botDad,fdofifi,t3_emcq9h,Thanks for sharing this
tattooedplant,fdofl3t,t3_emcq9h,I’m really surprised seroquel is so low on the chart...and how is weed more effective than seroquel? Weeds never helped my bipolar disorder lol
One_Gate,fdoikk0,t1_fdofl3t,"Wow, I didn’t even notice marijuana. That’s interesting. The hard data says that marijuana is probably a detriment so I would put too much wait on things that fell in the middle."
InfiniteLearner2000,fdomv6v,t3_emcq9h,What are they basing any of this on?
One_Gate,fdomx2t,t1_fdomv6v,A self-reporting survey from 301 people.
InfiniteLearner2000,fdoo9pz,t1_fdomx2t,Ok that makes a lot of sense. I thought it was based off of genetics or something and I’m like how the hell could they get “surprisingly effective”? Or the other categories.
peanutbutterfascist,fdovxyn,t1_fdoo9pz,"They did do a survey where they took DNA samples from people with bipolar disorder and depression, then once a month had them play either some cognitive games or answer med and lifestyle questions about how they were feeling.  For a year.

They did this around 2017/2018 though.  This seems to be older data"
Desirai,fdowtpp,t1_fdovxyn,how do we get involved in stuff like this? I want to be studied
InfiniteLearner2000,fdp9jpj,t1_fdovxyn,"Oh word. Do you happen to have a link to the results of the study? I would love to read about it. That is an area I am very interested in. How psychotropic meds affect cognition.

It does not tell you what meds will work for you just meds that will likely cause serious side effects based on your genetic profile and your metabolism really. They make it clear though that it is not intended for clinical use alone and to be used in conjunction with standard clinical practices."
unicornprincesscat,fdpp6c7,t1_fdovxyn,hey! I did that so i could get a free dna test and help the study.
peanutbutterfascist,fdpelg4,t1_fdowtpp,"No idea in general, this one I heard about from someone else I know... as a bonus they gave access to all the genetic data."
peanutbutterfascist,fdpf18n,t1_fdp9jpj,"I don't think anything has been released from that one yet.  23andme does have a blog they post their research papers to though.

My original pdoc did the genesight thing, I think it really helped with nailing the right meds.

She gave me a copy and said here, next time you go to a doctor about anything involving pain show them this and say see none of them work, I'm not lieing."

Started out weekly, then biweekly, now every three weeks.  I'm on lithium, cogentin, and risperdal too, but I was taking medicine before hospital stays in 2017 and 2018, so I have no faith in medication.  I track my mood with daylio and it's obvious the shock therapy has a real calming effect on my mood."

futuresquid,fdp2u5t,t3_emcq9h,"I think this study has a problem differentiating between effectiveness and tolerability. It’s not that Abilify doesn’t work, more that most people don’t like getting fat and losing grey matter. And yeah, marijuana is great fun... until it triggers a psychotic episode!

This is not a legit study on effectiveness. It’s a study on enjoyment. Take it for what it is."

ServingHumblePie,fdojikd,t3_emcq9h,Alcohol...I’ve finally given it up for the most part and can confirm it’s helped tremendously.

s0laris0,fdounvs,t3_emcq9h,"topamax is used for bpd? I was on it for headaches for a long time before I was diagnosed, had no idea it could be used for bipolar as well

edit: why is citalopram and celexa both on there? they're the same drug"
princess_littlebear,fdp1cff,t1_fdounvs,"It can be used as a mood stabilizer. My doctor said it was really mild though and wouldn't be effective for me... So i tried it, and it wasn't lol. All it did was make my hands spasm. Also, I saw that too. Its self reported data (survey) so I guess people wrote it differently."
s0laris0,fdplxvh,t1_fdp1cff,"I'm glad I wasn't crazy! I had intense spasms all the time while on topamax, I was afraid that eventually it would trigger a seizure. I couldn't share a bed with anyone because I'd keep us both up with my spasms all night!"

m0th3rofDragonz,fdowh3a,t3_emcq9h,Wow this makes me happy I just switched from Geodon to Lamictal
Desirai,fdowqug,t3_emcq9h,this makes me happy to see lamictal is up there. wellbutrin is doing good for me though personally. I don't really understand the small frequent snacks part though
FeartheChillGod,fdox6c5,t3_emcq9h,Clonazepam Is my saving grace
EtherealBipolar,fdoy471,t3_emcq9h,Can confirm Lamictal (Lamotrigine) and exercise.
meetMayra,fdozvnl,t3_emcq9h,"Hhhmmmmm yeh I dunno how I feel about this. My original magic bean was seroquel. Then for some dumb reason vraylar was thrown in their. That was a huge mistake. Then I was in the hospital. I got out of the hospital and my current magic beans is lamictal, prozac and seroquel. They're amazing. I'm intrigued by the excersize/sunlight. Like does it really make that much of a difference?"
CocoaCupcakeCat,fdp1xiw,t3_emcq9h,"I have a horrible experience with Geodon. I was on it last year and in 2018. I was constantly in fear of something bad going to happen to me, it was hell. I had intrusive thoughts all day long! It gave me no appetite and I cried everyday. I would randomly fall asleep during the day."
LokisBastard,fdp2akr,t3_emcq9h,I'm on abilify + exercise and feeling better lately.
TreemanDyson,fdp4wyv,t3_emcq9h,"Citalopram and Celexa are the same chemical, just with different names. Weird that they wouldn’t be equally as effective."
mr_everywhere_420,fdp7aym,t3_emcq9h,"Dude, whenever I find myself overthinking, I go into child’s pose and it fucking helps, it’s not gonna shut my mind up but it helps so fucking much believe me I’ve done it sober and I’ve done it on acid and on acid your mind is way more fucking louder so the fact that child’s pose helps is nothing short of a miracle

And fuck weed, as much as I love getting stoned, weed just fucks up my memory even more, and makes me more manic which is obviously better than having those long depressed episodes but a pain in the ass to deal with once I look at how much I’ve been spending during my manic states

Also... taking ecstasy in a therapeutic setting with the intention of using it for psychoanalytic purposes has personally helped me, also taking psychedelics (mild doses) with the intention of going inward and also doing meditation whilst in that state has helped tremendously.. just throwing it out there in case anyone is interested."
mercutios_girl,fdp9yfc,t3_emcq9h,Hahaha. I love that clonazepam is rated pretty highly but the medical profession has decided to vilify benzos. Apparently relying on a drug for relief from horrible anxiety is worse than being dead from suicide.
acesk8s,fdpa8qt,t3_emcq9h,Sleep and exercise and LAMICTAL for the win
ilovetpb,fdpd8ih,t3_emcq9h,I’d have murdered someone by now without my serequel.
lagrangedanny,fdpk4om,t3_emcq9h,"Less alcohol, more sleep, less caffeine

Also, marijuana in the green is an interesting find"
Clunkbot,fdpoigo,t3_emcq9h,I take Abilify. It’s a total game changer for me
gwynforred,fdpvp8u,t3_emcq9h,"Weird how Geodon is so low on the list. It works great for me, now that I've adjusted to it and the sedating effects have stopped. I know it doesn't work for everyone though. I have probably a misery milder case of bipolar -2 though and a bunch of other stuff on top of it so I'm kind of a weird mix so I wouldn't be surprised if what works for me is wildly different than for other people."
Comrade_Soomie,fdr8nsp,t3_emcq9h,Disagree about lithium’s position. Only thing that helped me.
dontlookforme88,fdr9k9p,t3_emcq9h,Where did you get these results? I was part of the bipolar study with 23andMe and I didn’t receive them :(
flight0fgulls,fdzkijj,t3_emcq9h,"Geodon Depakote and Effexor are surprisingly low on both counts to me, I’m on those three and it’s helped more than any meds I’ve ever been on.."
-teaqueen-,fdokpi3,t3_emcq9h,"Go fuck yourself, geodon."
beachybuffalo,fdop9uc,t3_emcq9h,"Sunlight and snacks above every medication? This graph is highly misleading. By splitting up all the medications in this way, each one can be called unhelpful even if the person responding is on another medication that did work for them. I’m having trouble expressing this thought but this graph may dissuade people who could be helped with medication (along with sleep diet exercise of course)"

kissmybunniebutt,fdx4b1o,t3_en8455,"This is why I hate credit based shit. Our economy is a debt economy, and if you don't play the game life is near impossible!

I didn't get a credit card until I was like...28. Because I knew I was a bipolar shitshow and knew I would make bad decisions eventually. Well, if you want to buy a car, or a house, or anything big you need credit history. And to get credit history you need a credit card. So...I sucked it up and opened one. Then two...

Yeah, I maxed both of them while hypomanic. I *knew* I would! I tried to refrain but.......we live in a society, amiright?"
bugnerd87,fdx4pqa,t1_fdx4b1o,"I went through that when I was 18-24 ish. Nobody ever taught me how to use it responsibly. And, unfortunately, shit happens. And when nobody makes enough to just live, you end up with a ton of debt no matter what."
windexdude,fdx576k,t1_fdx4b1o,that’s why i don’t want to get one one 18 and am afraid of getting a credit card because right now i can just spend shit in my bank account
SlayerOfTheVampyre,fdx51mo,t3_en8455,"I once spent 8000 dollars on a mobile game while manic. Thinking back to it, it was so stupid, I didn’t even like that game."

DanversOfManderley,fdxwb70,t1_fdx51mo,"To be fair, those games are designed to be psychologically manipulative, addictive, and to make you spend much more money than you’d like without even realizing it.

SainguinKrist,fdydjpe,t1_fdx51mo,"I can't even get to the point of spending of 8k on a mobile game cause I blow every spare penny on drugs.

Satioelf,fdylxre,t3_en8455,What exactly is it about bipolar that causes this spending during mania? I also suffer through it as well and feels so right and sure in the moment
kissmybunniebutt,fdz4cee,t1_fdylxre,"It's that last sentence. It just *feels* right. I never bought tons of things because I've always been pretty legit poor, but I've definitely overspent for my budget. It gives you a higher high, and you justify it easily when manic. You own the world, the sky is the limit! No one is in control...not society, and not yourself.

Man, some people do drugs to feel that way, others need drugs (namely the prescription kind) to stop feeling that way. Sure, it feels good but it ain't sustainable!"
CamiPatri,fdz736c,t1_fdylxre,I think it’s that when we’re manic we want to enjoy the huge rush of dopamine and so we engage in rewarding behaviors that we know will give us that rush such as spending
BornAgainRedditGuy,fdzhfee,t1_fdylxre,It just feels productive to me for some reason. Like I'm making things happen.

My late boyfriend would say that I would hit the 'September slump',  With this knowledge, I'm figuring that I hit one in the summer and by fall was coming out of it. He met me in the summer, probably during one, and I'm hypomanic most other times, so he was probably used to me being fast, not slow."

But I cannot stand when I tell someone I’m Bi polar, and they respond with “ OMG I think I am to! I’m so moody haha”

I feel like they are lessening the war I have in my head, and they don’t understand the seriousness.  I hear it every single time I tell someone I’m Bi Polar. 

Does anyone else experience this? And does it also bother you?"
intertropical,fdxu42t,t3_encbw8,"Yes, unfortunately :( and, yeah, it feels super invalidating because it's like they're making light of all the pain that this disorder has put me through. 

It sucks to keep seeing mental illness get trivialised... Things like 'I'm so OCD' (when talking about appreciating neatness) or 'that exam gave me PTSD' are annoying as well. 

I know it's hard, but I'd say just try to ignore them, especially if they refuse to see anything wrong about what they're saying. Arguing with them has just made me feel more frustrated and worse about myself."

Rubbe123,fe1lz33,t1_fdz3q6a,"100% agree with you. I felt like Joker was an incredibly powerful movie and actually depicts many situations people with severe mental illness' and the misery it is. It's not at all romanticized or ""fetishized""."
penguin0830,fdxy9ur,t3_encbw8,"Ugh I feel the SAME way. Since being diagnosed I’ve been super open about my mental health because I think openness makes us feel less isolated. 

But every time I’m open with someone they’re like “oh, I think I have that too! Sometimes I’m so sad and sometimes I’m so happy.” 
Like yeah that’s being a human.  

But I get in my head sometimes about the whole thing. Like yeah, I’ve been diagnosed by 4 different professionals, and I have people in my family who have bipolar, but what if I’m just like everybody else who THINKS they have it, but really I’m just pathetic and can’t handle life."

runr7,fdykre5,t3_encbw8,"This also gets me when people use the word Manic lightly.  Like, mania is not what they think it is ( for those who don’t have it)."
maniaxzen,fdyv2l7,t1_fdykre5,"Manic and mania as words have been around for centuries and while we (folks with bipolar) may primarily associate them with our condition, someone saying ""I feel manic"" or as I recently read in a novel someone doing something with a ""manic energy"" [isn't necessarily an incorrect usage of that word](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manic).

TriUnit,fe01rxj,t1_fdxua8z,I wish that simply because it doesn’t imply one or the other. “Bipolar” implies that both at the same time is just not a thing.
dollfacepastry,fe16y9b,t1_fdxua8z,"Yes I agree. The general popluce is confused by the term bipolar. The term ""unipolar depression"" is not in the common vernacular outside of the medical world, so people have little concept of what the term bipolar (depression) is referring to. 

 Anecdotal experience, but SO many times people have said things like ""oh Bipolar, that's not manic depression. Are you SURE they're the same thing?"" ""Bipolar is like, a type of schizophrenia, right?"" ""Bipolar is a personality disorder."" Etc etc. This confusion and misunderstanding further stigmatizes our condition . Bring back manic depression.

Edited to add: if I'm coming out to someone, I describe myself as a manic depressive, rather than I'm bipolar. I don't use bipolar colloquially, I really hate the term. 
Also- people with our condition are not described as having Bipolar, theyre described AS Bipolar. Like we're not human, we are Bipolar. Another reason I dislike the term."

themoonlitmind,fe49ao9,t1_fe02j7o,"Many of the symptoms are very different: i.e.: BPD is a personality disorder and pervades the sense of self at the base of it. There are lots of black and white thoughts and a sort of emptiness. There is something called splitting, which is used within relationships with those closest to them - it manifests as a sort of Jekyll and Hyde phenomenon.

I've been very close to quite a few individuals with it, as well, one of my best friends took her life who had it, unfortunately.

Meds do not tend to work on individuals with BPD. Something called DBT (dialectical behavior therapy), is often used as the primary treatment."
TBearG,fe0s96t,t1_fe02j7o,Bpd tend to flucuate moods more often. And each diagnosis comes with different effects and symptoms.

chicsonatina,fdyvqfs,t1_fdyogkm,"I feel the same and I’m still terrified every time I do come out. The less people who know the better. I also learned this past year that I should not disclose my diagnoses in any er; the dr was great until he learned my diagnosis, then suddenly everything was in my head and he sent me home. I almost died thanks to that (my gp agreed that I should “forget” to put that on my history if it ever happens again, that says a lot to me). 20 years battling this and I still learn new things every year. There is still too much stigma and if anyone in my field found out the truth I would likely be blacklisted. I also will go through Reddit and delete all my comments when I’m hypo manic or manic terrified someone will “figure me out”. Also I apologize  if I end up deleting this comment too."
msddsue_16,fdxwl02,t3_encbw8,I come across this constantly! My students will say they are so Bi Polar exaggerating their behaviors. I even have had students comment on peer relationships saying the relationship is Bi Polar.

Thetakishi,fdzh3zb,t1_fdxwl02,"The first example maybe, but the second one is a perfectly valid way to describe a relationship. Bipolar as a word came long before manic-depression became bipolar disorder."
degustibus,fdyzrfs,t1_fdxwl02,"The nature of language is that it lives, it mutates, it grows and distorts and twists and perverts and sometimes clarifies.   For a very long time Latin was the language of academic scholarhsip and doctors and natural philosophers (precursors to scientists).  Latin allowed a greater deal of precision, international usage, and it was mostly resistant to the fickle changes language endures when used by millions of people not concerned with accuracy.

Manic depression or circular insanity or folie a double or folie circulaire...  It may be worth it for patients to shift the name they use or even just use a diagnostic code number.  The stigma is immense and it's not simply the ignorant, but maybe more so the partially educated.

I get asked things that really aren't the questioner's business.  Depending on my aleertness and mood I may or may not be able to deflect with grace.   Lately I'll just say that I have some neuropsychiatric challenges that they are running tests on...  This usually stops the conversation cold.  If not, I'll ask them what they know about temporal lobe epilepsy or mitochondrial insufficiency.

English is a great language, the most words of any language by far, it can be both beautiful or matter of  fact.  It is not always good at conveying meaning because we have so many words we use multiple ways.   Elevated mood.  Low mood.  Mood variability.  Those phrases can describe a perfectly healthy adolescent with normal fluctuations, or it could be a bit of an understatement about someone who needs immediate hospitalization.   Mood, to most of us, just doesn't mean something that important, but when you go to high or too low, death is a serious possibility."

No, your normal emotions and moods are not the same as a literal disorder. Just don't.

It's even worse for OCD. I would love it if my OCD meant that my house was always clean and my icons had to be a certain way. Instead it means that I can't eat like a normal fucking person, and it takes me way longer to do anything - including getting the motivation to clean. I would rather leave those dishes for two days - because once I do the dishes, I have to do 40 next steps. So frustrating."
beachv0dka,fdzjc46,t3_encbw8,"sooo many people try to say they ‘think’ they are, when half the time (girls especially) it is just natural hormones affecting them.

Fritzy428,fdxzlcz,t3_encbw8,"It kinda makes me want to scream,  it happens to all the various mental ailments as previous comments have said as well. It constantly makes me doubt the severity and validity of my daily struggles.  It's an uphill battle to do most things and it just makes me feel worse about that. Yeah, sure EVERYONE who has mood swings is bipolar *eyeroll * but they function fine day to day with no medication or therapy and go party on the weekends then just get back to work monday.

The general public has minimal understanding of mental illness and I find it best just to keep it to myself.  It's gone from stigmatized to glamorized.

People say it to connect and for the people (with illnesses) they are talking to, not to feel 'sick' or different. It's a complete misunderstanding. It is well ment i guess."

But as anyone with bipolar knows, the internal struggles inside my mind can cripple me.
I going through a lot off turmoil at the minute waiting for a decision as to weather the man that raped me will be charged. I  honestly don't know how I manage to get through a day sometimes, with so many thoughts in my mind all bouncing off each other and trying to rationalise everything.

Travbuc1,fdz1dxe,t3_encbw8,"As someone who’s been diagnosed since he’s been 15.

Nietzscha,fdzo8pp,t3_encbw8,"Yes! Also, if someone is complaining about another person, they almost always think that other person is ""bipolar,"" because of their moodiness or anger issues.

This person does not seem to be bipolar at all, just an angry fuck."
oogieboogie333,fdzqkk8,t3_encbw8,"I completely agree. I get tired of people self diagnosing themselves and other people. It irritates me to no end that people claim to have OCD because they like a clean house or are a perfectionist at something. OCD is a serious mental condition that causes someone's entire life to revolve around it. Bi-Polar is an illness that we cannot control that controls our lives on a daily basis. 

I feel like it's the same as if people went around saying ""My stomach hurts regularly. I clearly have stomach cancer."" 

People would think you were an ass for self diagnosing cancer or Parkinson's disease because occasionally they get dizzy or don't feel well."

adetsmom,fe0dcod,t1_fdzxxwj,"So true. For years I would share articles etc with loved ones and was conffused that they were still so confused, i immediately realized, I Don't understand them at all either! So I gave up the need to be understood. It was absolutely liberating! Not worth all that energy! And just think, most of us have spent years studying pschiatry and brain chemistry, and the ""normies"" probably think DSM is a rappers name.   In this context, its the same as expecting a child to understand and be sensitive."
adetsmom,fe04oig,t3_encbw8,"Yes, but can't help but laugh, because eventually they are bound to discover it's so so much more than a fad, regardless of whether that is a true diagnosis or not... Like the social stigma just to start."
RegretfulMirage,fe0g8hp,t3_encbw8,"That's why I've started to tell people, ""I have BiPolar Disorder."", because it sounds more 'medically correct' to people and they see it more as something that needs to be diagnosed rather than the sadly popular expression now-a-days, ""I'm *like* totally BiPolar""."
kimmylafo,fe0ghhy,t3_encbw8,"Same thing with people who think they have anxiety or depression when they don’t.

BigFitMama,fe0qh1p,t3_encbw8,"I'll put it up there with the current fad to have a disability for profit, sympathy, or to feel special. And there is always Munchausen (not by proxy) Syndrome

Like:

1. Being ""allergic"" to foods that don't immediately kill you or cause you to need an epi-pin.  Food intolerances or foods that just don't agree with you are fine - like lactose intolerance vs a milk allergy that makes your throat close up are just that.  Gluten-free is also a good example - people with Celiac will die - people who think Gluten isn't healthy for them won't die.
2. Eating disorder and body dysmorphia delusions; I find normal-sized people love identifying as fat and are really into fat acceptance and all the fat support groups - but after reading a few comments about how they can't lose weight (that stubborn five pounds keeping them out of size 0 and true happiness) suddenly people figure out this is a normal-sized person.  However, the mental health issue is not ""i'm fat"" it is ""I have body dysmorphia and I don't see myself as normal thus I am forcing limitations on myself for no reason."" 
3. And mental illness - my personal opinion if a real, live doctor of psychology diagnoses you with a mental health issue, go to a second one and review it.  I started out with ADHD and Depression which took another year to say ""maybe it is BP?""  IF you do not have a medical diagnosis you should not go around saying you are anything. Not as a joke or for sympathy or to excuse bad behavior.  It shouldn't hold you back from living or be an excuse to shirk responsibility.  I WANT to go to work and any day I have clinical depression is hellish because I know I belong at work and belong helping people, but the biochemical imbalance makes it like I am walking in concrete.  Just calling in and saying 'I can't work today, I'm depressed"" than popping back on Tuesday because you partied too hard on Sunday it cheapens the true desperation and terror we live in. 

So language needs to change like ""I feel anxious"" vs ""omg I have anxiety"" or ""I'm so bipolar' vs ""my feelings are mixed"" or ""my behavior is unpredictable and I don't know why!""  And most definitely - don't use self-diagnosis except to inform yourself you need to head a doctor and investigate."
Patriciawhack,fe0tnit,t3_encbw8,"This super sucks because at the same time it’s those uneducated people who talk about “people with bipolar, schizophrenia, borderline” are so scary or always super unstable.

It’s become some sort of fad to have a fake mental disorder"
Moriah_R,fdyzkbh,t3_encbw8,"I feel like this was a trend when I was in high school. A few celebs came out as bipolar and suddenly it was the ""cool"" illness to have.

No one would have even cared or believed that I had it if I'd told them because I was the opposite of cool.

So...I guess it's annoying. Mostly because I feel like they don't know what that word means. But, big deal. They're ignorant. Ignorance is nothing new."
bruh609,fdz8axq,t3_encbw8,"Yeah I've seen this happen a bunch. People tend to think that mental illness is like some title, a feat, an achievement!  
It's really dumb. Now I make light of mental health stuff all the time. It's how I cope but I also think that being too serious about these things never helps. However these people make all this seem like just something that's no biggie.  
I don't like being overly dramatic about either.  


I tend to keep all my mental illness stuff under wraps in my private life. I don't talk about them, nobody really knows about them, people just know that sometimes I go off radar for weeks on end and some other times I'll call them at 4am and brag about how I ended up re-organizing my whole place and then get mad at them because they don't care about my super radical new setups.  


I feel ashamed of the bipolar label so I choose to viewed as ""a bit weird"" rather than ""bipolar"". I'd probably die from shame if everyone around me knew. Partially because its definitely nothing to be proud of and partially because everyone has managed to turn it into one of those ""imaginary"" mental illnesses so I'm sure people would not view me the same way again after that."

the_goodbitch,fe00f90,t1_fe002uy,👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 yes exactly
dontlookforme88,fe04yi3,t3_encbw8,ALL.THE.TIME! It drives me nuts and I’ve learned that arguing it is rarely successful
pluginbbg,fe0em02,t3_encbw8,"I was in an argument with a friend/boy/idiot telling him he’s so hot and cold. Called him bipolar, he said yeah I actually think I am.. told him no, you twit you are just an asshole."
Escaflowne8,fe0gkuk,t3_encbw8,"It bothers me. For people I care about, I'll eventually try to find a tactful way to explain the differences on things like clinical depression vs being depressed, being anxious vs crippling anxiety etc, and talk about where the line is drawn, and how impact symptoms like psychosis and mania can be. I try to get a gentle tone, and let it be a learning experience. In the end I can't blame most people, there's simply a lot of mental health issues you can grasp unless you been close to it or have it."
Cobratron,fe0ywbq,t3_encbw8,There needs to be just a giant upvote arrow for this whole thread.
Hwinnian,fe29aum,t3_encbw8,"Same. I used to joke about it, and a couple of my friends suggested I had it. In a concerned friendly way.

Then I went full blown manic and ended up involuntarily in a psych ward for 2 weeks, diagnosed with Bipolar i. Blew up my own life and hurt some people close to me very badly.

I wish someone had pushed me to see a doctor a bit. One friend did, and I promised her I would after exams were over. And before exams were over... See above.

So my response when someone says that is to go dead serious and tell them (part of)my story. And say that if they aren't willing to discuss it with a doctor, then misdiagnosis is extremely dangerous for themselves and those they love. And claiming to have it when you actually don't is hurtful to those who do.

Bipolar, manic/mania, and depression/depressed/depressing do all have valid uses in the English language besides describing mental health, though. I too prefer ""manic depression."" Most people have a decent idea of what depression is. Mania is much less well understood or even recognizable to the general population."
hunkydory45,fe30bnm,t3_encbw8,"Yep. My MIL said she ""was"". Ironically she triggered my manic episode that I'm still dealing with."
Gaddammitkyle,fe3o19q,t3_encbw8,Anyone ever get suspicious that people get wrongfully diagnosed as bipolar in order for doctors to push certain meds?
the_goodbitch,fe3rs3e,t1_fe3o19q,"Not to sure, I can understand for ADHD because people snort those meds 

But I’m not sure what meds a person would abuse for bi polar"
AdamnBecca4eva,fe40kr7,t3_encbw8,"Yeah it bugs me.
I’ve had manic episodes where I ruined relationships, and barely survived. 
I’ve had depressive episodes that put my in psych wards.
I’ve had hypomania for so long that my skin was crawling and had full on auditory hallucinations and cowered from shadow people.
Sleep is such a fickle beast and I try to make plans and get things down in life but I am constantly 1 step forward and 2 steps back.
If I take all my meds I turn into a fat unmotivated zombie.
Not taking my meds is a crap shoot as well.
Then some asshole blessed with good brain chemistry that makes it to work everyday and sleep every night complains about their “ocd” “insomnia” or oh I’m so manic! No you drank a bunch of coffee and got shit done. When I’m manic I blow crazy amounts of money and put myself in dangerous situations. It does belittle the war in our minds. It gives them a chance to look down on us.
It’s like we are crippled and people say “oh I sit down sometimes.”"
the_goodbitch,fe45bhz,t1_fe40kr7,We are so much alike it’s crazy
AdamnBecca4eva,fe49u0o,t3_encbw8,"Oh man and when people say they are ocd, and I recall for years I couldn’t leave the house until everything was clean. I remember my brother pushing me out the house “we need toilet paper!” He didn’t have a license."
asubio,febs8uy,t3_encbw8,"I was JUST thinking about this yesterday when a childhood friend of mine posted an insanely long ramble about how she’s always had “bipolar” and depression, anxiety, etc. Like someone mentioned—the “fashionable” disorders. There were nearly 100 comments thanking her for her honesty, sharing her struggle, and how they have bipolar as well...ugh. I also categorize this with people who say they used to cut like it was a trendy thing to do or “attention seeking.” I did whatever I could to hide my cutting. 17 years of doing it isn’t a “phase.” Everyone wants to be special and unique and hop on the “cool mental illness train.” What’s the phrase? “Everyone wants to be a gangster until it’s time to do gangster shit.” Yeah, everyone wants to have bipolar until it’s time to have bipolar symptoms. Brb gotta go take the 7 meds I need to stay alive."
ServingHumblePie,fdxxmm7,t3_encbw8,"It doesn’t bother me.  If I may retort, why do you need validation on your illness?"
Prudii_Tracyn,fdyo61a,t1_fdxxmm7,"They don’t, they are just Upset other people trivialize the severity of having bipolar"
the_goodbitch,fdz4b4e,t1_fdyo61a,"Thank you for saying this prudii_Tracyn this is exactly how I feel about it 


I’ve hardly survived being this way, so when someone jokes about it because they are a bit moody, absolutely drives me crazy"
Prudii_Tracyn,fdznlyc,t1_fdz4b4e,Glad I could help.
triunitur,fdyc7cv,t3_encbw8,"I have a friend like this, who's very public about the fact she feels like she's got everything under the sun, OCD, depression, anxiety,  the whole 'fashionable' lot. I don't like it, because I'm very careful to keep my fears for the future under wraps and it doesn't help when you're trying to figure yourself out to have this constantly in your ear reminding you that they're depressed and they have therapy and meds and nobody understands. It's all very odd to me."
November--Ghost,fe1rthq,t3_encbw8,I think it’s a term people use like we used to use the word retard for someone who made a mistake or something like that. Soon I bet the realization will come what that means when used in manner like the r word! Until then I prefer to not get worked up about it as I’m dealing with much more significant things in my life than what words people choose to use.
jaycakes30,fe2hyei,t3_encbw8,"It bothers me sooo much. The song ""sweet but a psycho"" I find completely and utterly offensive tbh!!

The younger generation are obsessed with mental health issues to the point it's now glamorous to have bipolar, anxiety etc. (we all know it's anything but!!) and I've found that I'm not taken as seriously as I feel I should be when it comes to my diagnosis' 

Whilst it's good that mental health issues are in the spotlight and people are talking about it, I think it's been massively counterproductive in a way, because people don't realise how terrible this illness actually is.. Mainly thanks to little divas that kick off at their boyfriends for doing ANYTHING at all, they scream mental health issues to justify their own vile behaviours and that's really unfair."

AndyPandy85,fdzxmxc,t1_fdzx3pa,I just joined a weekly group and it was really refreshing
speedmaster3000,fe5oo5f,t1_fdzx3pa,"In my experience, I’ve only been seen as crazy or misunderstood so much that they write it off as moody and then intertwine who I am with traits that I embody during an episode. But I’ve learned it’s about how you bring it up and making sure when i do, that I have the opportunity or ears to explain some of the things I find important about being bipolar. So I don’t just blurt it out  but am patient in knowing the right time to share that information with others and in an intelligent, well-articulated, non-defensive way. So that required me to be able to understand that ignorance may be a result of lack of education or experience with bipolar people and I also found that I needed to accept that some people will never understand and that’s on them but I can’t asssume they don’t want to."
runlots,fe004ux,t1_fdzxmxc,It's really good. I feel less alone and isolated already. And the group is mostly older people which says to me that it's possible to live well with this difficult disease

This coworker is a rare gem that should be more a part of your life than just seeing them at work. Fucking I want to be their bestie now lol I’m so jealous
not_catherine_zjones,fe4ynoo,t1_fe4atp9,"I kinda agree with you... it’s hard to know what to say when you are the other person. He/she really kept it very light, which is nice. 

Much better than “no you are not bipolar, that is not true... you don’t seem crazy”"

redditorinalabama,fe3eh4v,t3_ene9bv,"I don’t mean to be a downer it’s your life but as far as my life, if someone said that to me I would be offended. My psychiatrist said something similar to me, “I bet you’re fun” and it hurt my feelings because bipolar mania has not added anything positive to my life. I don’t make good decisions and maybe it is fun but at the end of the day I don’t want that fact about myself to be celebrated. Maybe I’m just too sensitive about it because it’s been a recent diagnosis for me (bipolar 1, 1year) but I just don’t take that kind of comment as a compliment"
resin_rat,fe3jkub,t1_fe3eh4v,"it wasn’t really a compliment, we’re friends at work but I just thought it was funny and lighthearted in the sense that we had just talked about his disorder. coming from psychiatrist is unprofessional as hell tho i would be pissed"

My doctor told ne it was all in my head though and to stop reading things on the internet. I did experience some confusion at first though.  Also at the beginning I felt confused sometimes."
smith__time,fdw29zz,t3_en5c5w,This is kind of funny! Honestly though I’ve been on it a few months and it’s been the best medication I’ve been on so far! No side effects for me. I have had days where I don’t think about suicide and I can get out of bed every morning.
TitiferGinBlossom,fdvvfqo,t3_en5c5w,Lamotrigine is a cunt. I’m currently weaning off it after three years. I fucking hate it.
swhit94,fdy1n4c,t1_fdxsjoj,"I think it's not the most potent in the way of stabilizing, it only helps to a certain degree of severity of the condition, as far as I can tell."
TitiferGinBlossom,fdy3meh,t1_fdxsjoj,"The stabilising effects have begun to wear off for me now. That’s not to say that it happens to everyone but the side effects have become too much to tolerate too and coupled with the inefficacy of its main job, I’m going to dump it and try something else again. 

Getting a drug combo right is a long and arduous process with millions of ups and downs and just because something works for a while, doesn’t mean it’ll work forever. I’m due for a change now and so I’m dialling down the dosage on my Lamotrigine and Venlafaxine, taking a couple of months off from all drugs, and then trying something new. I’ve been on a million different combos over the last 25 years and I’ve been medicated for periods of time and then I medicated for various periods of time. It’s just the way of it for me and my pathology/history and how Bipolar Disorder affects me."
Warholsmorehol,fdx77x8,t1_fdwqm32,"You really need to lower the dose in steps. Stopping it can cause all sorts of bad side effects, the worst of which is seizures."

SkinnyJoshPeck,fdwzbvp,t3_en5c5w,"Amazing! Nice find.

I know you’re not soliciting advice, but for what it’s worth Lamictal is my hella my tempo, for sure. I take it daily and I couldn’t be happier. I have bad days and some great days, but really it just gave me the ability to actually implement coping schemes and plan better while making everything much less severe. No side effects after the first 2-4 weeks.

Taking new meds sucks and is scary, and I’m sorry you have to do it, but Lamictal is a solid therapy :)"

smith__time,en9ybg,top_level,"I’m got diagnosed last year after a bad intense episode. I’ve pretty much been depressed ever sense. The posts I would see saying “I think I’m hypomanic/manic” used to confuse me because I though shouldn’t you know? Why do you need to tell people? Well now I realize I am in a hypomanic episode and some support would be so nice. I haven’t been able to fall asleep for almost 2 weeks, I have energy, I wake up in the mornings, I talk to fast, I can’t stop thinking, and I actually feel good. It’s scary honestly. I never thought I’d feel happy or good again! I also am frustrated because it doesn’t feel genuine because I’m in an episode. If you read this thank you! It’s lovely to come on here and read posts and post myself."
Plushine,fdwv2wt,t3_en9ybg,"I totally understand how you feel. I used to think being in an episode would somehow make my feelings and experiences superficial. But they're real. Your feelings are real, your happiness is genuine. 

It may be caused by imbalance, but that doesn't make it *less* real. If anything, I believe bipolar people feel emotions *more* deeply."
smith__time,fdwwkz4,t1_fdwv2wt,Thank you so much for your reply! It’s still so new to be to recognize and be aware of episodes. Yes I do feel all the things so deeply!(or nothing at all)
pixxiestix812,fdy836a,t1_fdwv2wt,"So true, it’s a gift and a curse."
bruh609,fdz8v91,t1_fdwv2wt,"That's an interesting view on. I on the other hand do not believe I at least feel anything more deeply. I personally feel like that I don't know what true joy or happiness is. I feel like I'm only familiar with a warped, dishonest version of joy and everything that is attached to it. Only depression feels real.   
I guess I should try to somehow try to turn that thinking around. Not that I really notice it instantly. When I feel good for the first few days, I don't have time to stop and think. But after some time I tend to catch up on the weird shit I'm doing that's ""Not me"", I start to feel this weird frustration towards feeling good. If that makes any sense."
dontsweatitdear,fdy9q42,t1_fdwwkz4,i definitely agree with the person above. Be happy and don’t feel guilt for the happiness that comes you’re way. Just because we’re diagnosed with bipolar doesnt make your happiness any less genuine. Try to keep notice if theres anything off and definitely catch yourself before falling down the rabbit hole. But if you’re happy then Just Be Happy.💚
smith__time,fdysj4f,t1_fdy9q42,Thank you so much!❤  yes noticing if something is off i think is key. I've only been been diagnosed and have been getting treatment sense May.
sandy154_4,fdx92ua,t3_en9ybg,Are you on meds?  Under the care of a psychiatrist?   I'd suggest going to see them.  You do not want to get so manic that you experience psychosis.
smith__time,fdxb1qn,t1_fdx92ua,Yes to all! Thank you for your reply! I saw my therapist yesterday and she assured me I’m aloud to feel good and I don’t have to fear mania. I’m aware now and know what manic psychosis is so I know if I’d need additional treatment and my family who I’m living with is aware too
TaxiFare,fdyakqz,t1_fdxb1qn,"Just be careful with that. When I talked to my psyche about my mania, they got really concerned and explained that mania is your brain firing on all cylinders. She said that having your brain firing off absurdly hard, especially for extended periods where you're not really sleeping, is absurdly hard on your brain to where it can cause some damage. Just be safe and get some meds if you're concerned."
sandy154_4,fdxbpnb,t1_fdxb1qn,I advise you to take note of your early symptoms of mania.  What happens first for you?   Not able to sleep?  This will help you know when its happening and to see your Dr.    Are you on a mood stabilizer?
smith__time,fdyt4xd,t1_fdyakqz,"Thank you so much for your reply! Yes I'm aware of that too. I don't feel any full blown manic, but if I start to I will definitely get additional support."
smith__time,fdxe28y,t1_fdxbpnb,Impulsively is the biggest one and wild racing thoughts. I’m on Lamotrigine and lithium right now. I’m going to start finding good outlets for this like exercise and art. I literally haven’t had energy like this sense my first and devastating episode last March/April.  It’s all new experience another cycle besides depression with this awareness
Hwinnian,fe2dqfk,t1_fdxe28y,"Do you have a drug that helps you sleep? I have trazadone for regular insomnia and saphris for manic insomnia. I find that if I am able to get a couple of good nights' sleep, the scary symptoms go away, but I still feel good and Feel All The Things. After feeling nothing for two years after my first awful manic episode, I will never take that for granted again.

I think of it as a positive feedback loop. Sleeping less makes me more manic, which makes me sleep less, which....

It sounds like you're handling it well and finding healthy outlets for the mania. And have a support system that will recognize danger when you can't. Good for you, and enjoy being happy again!"
penguin0830,fdxf3ee,t3_en9ybg,"Something that helps me is being productive during these episodes, so I feel like I’m using all that energy for good! 
In the past, I would sometimes sit for hours with my “big ideas” or talk friends ears off but never actually DO anything. 
Or worse I’d go out and get in bad situations. 

Once I was at a coffee shop intending to work on a short story but my manic “big ideas” kept popping into my head and I couldn’t stop chatting rapidly with my friend. She finally said “you need to put that energy into your story now” and once I actually put pen to paper I wrote pages and pages! 

It’s a scary feeling for sure, but I just try to exercise, keep my room clean, do my hobbies, stick to my daily routine, I find they pass much smoother. And sticking to my routines keeps me going once that depression comes back in. 

Wishing you the best through it all."
smith__time,fdyuzu8,t1_fdxf3ee,"Thank you for sharing your experience! I do talk a LOT when i'm hypo or feeling good. I am thinking about making plans for art or writing with my phone far far away! It is scary to think about doing art again because it reminds me of my life before, and what if I'm bad at it now?, but I won't get better without practice! Wishing you the best too!!"
penguin0830,fdz5ui3,t1_fdyuzu8,"We all start somewhere! And even if you are bad at first, it’s all part of the process!! With writing and art I find it’s best not to focus on the result and focus more on what you’re making in the moment. Being too results oriented only makes the process unbearable!"
degustibus,fdym9j4,t3_en9ybg,"Sleep.  Manage your sleep.  If you force yourself to get 7-8 hours a night you shouldn't launch into mania.  Benadryl is available as a generic at Costco for very little.  The active ingredient is diphenahydramine, which is also used in many sleep aides.  This is a good drug to try to help you sleep.  Also, schedule an appointment with your psychiatrist.  Tell the scheduler it's important and that you'll also take the first cancellation.  Your doctor may prescribe you something like generic Seroquel.  It's an atypical antipsychotic that can really help with sleep and knocking mania down."
smith__time,fdytw29,t1_fdym9j4,"I'm learning this so much!! So the problem was I was so depressed and sleeping a LOT for so long.. so now I can't fall asleep at the ""normal"" time but I sleeping a consistent 8-9 hours now. I'm still learning to live with bipolar and navigating everything.  Maybe my normal is sleeping from midnight to 9 and I can learn to be okay with that. I have a med appt next month so if I need to can get adjustments then. I'm getting some Benadryl tonight to try that out. 

&#x200B;

also Edit: thank you so much for your comment and advice!!"
juniorross10,fe00ee1,t1_fdym9j4,"I started on seroquel after a couple of manic months and for maybe 2 weeks felt ok but then slid rapidly into deep depression, I'd be interested to hear if people use seroquel daily or only when the mania gets too much ??"
degustibus,fdyxbz9,t1_fdytw29,"If you live by a Costco, that's your best price on it by far.  And you don't need a membership to buy at the pharmacy.  Good luck."
degustibus,fe5vitd,t1_fe00ee1,"My doctor only wants me using it on occasion. I can see that it would easily be habit forming and that it has profound effects on the mind.  I'm on lithium and Depakote daily, so the fact I still need anything extra concerns me, but isn't surprising.  I have unusual reactions to things meant to calm me.  Last hospital visit I terrified the staff because they gave me the big injection of Ativan and within minutes I was more amped up than when I arrive.   I regained consciousness during a surgery as a kid."
CamiPatri,fdzc0ap,t3_en9ybg,An interesting take on that sentiment is that we tend to think our happiness is ‘fake’ when manic but we never question if our suffering is real when depressed
smith__time,fdzut5n,t1_fdzc0ap,You have a very very good point.
CamiPatri,fdzx4va,t1_fdzut5n,Just something to think about :)
agent2coopers,fdyklbw,t3_en9ybg,"I honestly never know I had a hypomanic episode until after the fact. It’s so much like just being functional for me. Mania is extremely obvious, but, of course, when it’s happening I don’t exactly hate it. I wish I had some advice, other than getting sleep. I can throw myself into hypomania basically at Will, by not sleeping. If you are able to take a sleep aide or talk to your doctor about it, I would highly recommend. For me the entire situation seems to revolve around my sleep and activity level. My body will literally kick into hypo if it knows it has to power through something, like an extremely long week."
pixxiestix812,fdy4zi8,t3_en9ybg,What meds are you on? Do you see a therapist regularly?
CraisyDaisy,fe0bm6s,t3_en9ybg,"THAT. It's that 'this isn't genuine' feeling. But they are, just feel what you can. You are real, feeling are real, no matter what your brain tries to tell you. 

Our disorder tries to lie to us so much. Don't let it."
gardis848,fe083vj,t3_en9ybg,"I realised just in time how dangerous those kinds of episodes could be for me. See, I used to think that I was only depressive but then a hypomanic episode would trigger and all those dark thoughts would be gone along with it.

""I don't know what I what was all that fuss about, I'm all right"" is the kind of thing that went through my head during those moments. And one doesn't seek help when they feel okay. 

Going to the point, I never noticed I was hypomanic before I learned I could be bipolar (after I bumped into an article about it somewhere), so yeah, it can go pretty unnoticed and distort your view."

ThePiglett,elg6j3,top_level,
ThePiglett,fdhkz27,t3_elg6j3,"I was diagnosed in July.  This illness has taken so much from me.  But now I am pissed.  Pissed off, not weird angry or yelling but more like “ go fuck your self Bipolar”.  You won’t take my health.  You just won’t!!!

Finishing up a 3 month depression episode and still in it. But for the past four days I get on my horse and do 11k steps.  It helps immensely fir my anxiety and I feel like I am actually accomplishing something.  Good to be sweating again.  Highly recommend!"
cherryteapai,fdhrcgu,t1_fdhkz27,"Yes! It’s such an anger inducing drug the more you feel helpless about the illness. 
I’m starting a workout routine inviting my sister this week. I remember how much it helped made me feel good about myself when I did Insanity back in High School. I had abs! I was so proud! 

I’m sorry that you had a 3 month period of depression, it must’ve been awful but I admire your will to get right into working out! 
Don’t give up!"
Bolivar2020,fdiv4yw,t1_fdhkz27,"Yes! - celebrating your productive anger & righteous fight!  Inspired by you, ""F*ck you, Bipolar"" helped me finish my steps today, too. I may have found my mantra....."
ThePiglett,fdhvq5i,t1_fdhrcgu,I agree.  I am fed up with it having complete control of my every waking moment.  For the past four days it’s not in control.  I forced myself and my illness took a back seat to what I wanted.  Glad to hear your doing the same!
ThePiglett,fdjp999,t1_fdiv4yw,Thank you.   You description is exactly my thought pattern.   I’ve got to continue this fight for sure.
Drizzly-rainbow-12,fdhnpy9,t3_elg6j3,"Keep it up! Exercise is the ticket for me. It’s obviously not a cure, but it certainly helps."
ThePiglett,fdhv87q,t1_fdhnpy9,Amen to your post.   I actually feel better and it sure did help with my anxiety.
hvemdem,fdhlqok,t3_elg6j3,"I Feel you, just out of the funk myself. Good to be out and about. And get the meatsuit moving."
ThePiglett,fdhmmwb,t1_fdhlqok,I had lost 130lbs 12 yrs ago from diet and exercise.  Turned into a personal trainer ( not training anyone currently).   But it just hit me my depression is never gonna end unless I force myself to move    It’s only fourth day.  But I am gonna string some more days together and hopefully my Wellbutrin kicks in.  Depression is terrible.
ThePiglett,fdhmsvi,t1_fdhlqok,🏃‍♀️
RalphTheWonderLlamma,fdhy2dw,t3_elg6j3,"1.768 mph, I surmise you live in a cold environment and walking in nature is currently not possible. Way to overcome and keep up the good work!"
ThePiglett,fdi0al9,t1_fdhy2dw,"Thank you.  Yeah just about I guess?  Your right I need to get outside tomorrow.  
The depression makes it hard but I feel so much better.  I work up to 2.5mph after a bit.  I have not worked out since September.   I will get back to 3.6mph soon? A month?  .  
I built a gym when I was manic 11months ago./ took to build out.  I am glad I have it now cuz going into the gym is not possible for me due to anxiety.  
. I actually live in an unbearable climate in south Florida( May thru November it’s unbearable hot.  Feel like temp of 110 from 10-4 everyday).  I insulated my 25x25 garage and it’s a wonderful gym.  Have all the good machines.   But your right. It was 72degrees today. I need to get out!"
RalphTheWonderLlamma,fdi0kdm,t1_fdi0al9,I hear you. I've got a home gym and I'm on a 5 year workout hiatus. Just looking at the machines makes my hands weak and depression spike. I'm proud of you!
ThePiglett,fdi1xmz,t1_fdi0kdm,Thank you so much.  I did a lot of embarrassing things when manic over the past four years ( diagnosed /went to treatment in July 2019) I completed this gym when I was in treatment ( machines got installed)   This manic endeavor is gonna pay off for me.  THANK YOU again fir your kind words.
JoeBensDonut,fdj3o38,t3_elg6j3,"Yeah exercise! I just got done, I feel way better."
ThePiglett,fdjpzrh,t1_fdj3o38,Feeling good !   It’s helping with my depression and my confidence.
