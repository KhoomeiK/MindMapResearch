DearyDairy,fdjirig,t1_fdjg2f1,">I had someone (Who was morbidly obese at 15) try to tell me that they barely eat anything and they've tried full-on starvation and they still gain weight.


Oh yeah, this was my brand of fatlogic before I realised how moronic I was.

I'd skip breakfast, then when I got home I'd have 1000 calories worth of fruit juice and Nutella toast.  Then maybe an additional 500-700 calories of juice or chocolate or corn chips before dinner, then I'd have maybe 1/2 of the food my parents served me, and I'd tell them I'm not hungry enough to finish.

When they asked what I ate that day, I'd be honest, I'd had a few glasses of juice, two slices of toast with Nutella, and a handful (30-40g) of corn chips.

My parents would mutter to themselves that ""hm, that's not much food, you need to eat the rest of your dinner"" sometimes I would, sometimes I wouldn't.

On nights I didn't finish my dinner, the idea that I hadn't eaten much food really got in my head.

I didn't understand that calories are what matters, and while the volume of food I ate was less than what some people would consider average, the calories were more than what my 5ft disabled body needed.

Even to this day, I'll occasionally think to myself ""I haven't eaten all day! I'm going to have a big dinner *and* rich dessert"" then I'll remember the 3 coffee's I've had, equalling 400-500 calories, and have a modest dinner and small dessert so I can hit my 1600 calorie TDEE."

isunktheship,fdks2yq,t1_fdkeamd,"(I kinda got carried away, but here's my personal weight loss strategy..)

MyFitnessPal is my #1 recommendation.. it shows you how many calories are in everything you eat, and how many calories you'll burn if/when you exercise.  If you use this app.. you'll know exactly WHY you're not losing weight.

---

Take a week to get familiar with the app and read through each step before committing.

Within the app, plug in your age, weight, activity, and how much you want to lose, gain, or maintain.  In my case it's lose, I typically set it to 0.5lbs/week.  (1lb ~= 3,000 calories, so I'm looking to shave ~215 calories a day off of my recommended caloric intake).

---


#Step 1: Beginner
 - Stop eating out, these numbers are VERY difficult to track
 - Buy groceries with bar codes (e.g. scannable), this makes tracking calories EASY
 - Don't worry about exercise so much, but log it if you do
 - Log everything, and be honest about your numbers..

---

*If Step 1 is difficult, try your best to at least log data.  If you're over calories, you can immediately offset this by working out.. keep looking for foods that make you full without breaking the caloric bank.*

---

#Step 2: Intermediate
 - Still avoid eating out.
 - Buy groceries **without** bar codes, try looking things up, plug them into the app by weight, volume, serving size, etc.  These must be plugged in manually.  You'll get a great understanding of what a meal is ""worth"" as you learn what each component is worth (e.g. 0.5lb Chicken vs 0.5lb beef, or 1 cup of white rice vs 1 cup brown rice, how many calories are in pasta, etc.)
 - Work in exercise to balance your calories out if you're consistently **over**.  Low-impact cardio is my recommendation, cycling.
 - Log everything, and be honest about your numbers..

---

*If Step 2 is difficult, come up with a smaller set of meal ideas that you can simply repeat.  MyFitnessPal allows you to refer back to previous entries.. one easy step is to just have the same breakfast every day, and to make enough dinner that you can have it for lunch the following day.  This way you're only entering one meal a day (assuming you haven't also duplicated dinner), as breakfast and lunch are dupes.*

---

#Step 3: Advanced
  - Try eating out, but you MUST be diligent about your calories.  Many chain restaurants post their calories, MyFitnessPal supports this.  Otherwise you have to plug things in piecemeal.  ""0.75lb baked potato with cheese, bacon, chives, sour cream..."".  Fortunately you've been cooking a diverse array of meals, you should have a sense for how much something ""costs"".
  - At this point you should be cooking a variety of things and understanding just about what a meal is worth without looking it up. Keep mastering this skill, learn more recipes.
  - Exercise is recommended, even if you're just maintaining weight, this stimulates your muscles, blood flow, heart rate, improves your metabolism and overall health.
  - Log everything, and be honest about your numbers..

---

When I jump back into MyFitnessPal the changes aren't immediate.. it typically takes 2-4 weeks before I start to see changes, but once that happens, week over week I'm losing weight.  From here you simply dial in your weight loss.  Want to bump it to an aggressive 1lb/wk? Want to maintain? You're set.

The most important part about this is logging everything and being honest with yourself, you can't cheat math.  Calories in, calories out."

SpottedRocks,fdjj21t,t1_fdjam0y,"Thyroid problems usually don't lead to several hundred pounds of weight gain, I believe the average is more like 20 pounds.

I have an underactive thyroid and just take a pill every morning and get blood tests regularly - can't blame any weight gain on my thyroid.

The belief that weight gain is inevitable and loss impossible seems to be very common though, even one of my doctors was extremely suprised that it's possible to be underweight with that diagnosis."
lokismom27,fdk53v0,t1_fdjam0y,"I have Hasimoto's thyroiditis that is very difficult to regulate. I've had to watch my diet my whole life it feels like, but I have managed to lose 60 lbs.

TheOneTruBob,fdk7i92,t1_fdk53v0,"Whether I was explaining it well or not, this was exactly my point. Tiny slice of people with a real issue, lots of people claiming they have it. Thank you."
RubbelDieKatz94,fdjch2h,t1_fdjanfu,"I'm curious about how these problems work. They don't create fat out of thin air, but they might cause issues which lead to more of the lipids/sugar in food being converted into body fat. Which means that in order to gain the same energy from food that normal people eat, one would simply add some dextrose or glucose tablets to get a bit of energy, right?

// Ok, I checked the [first duckduckgo result](https://www.webmd.com/women/ss/slideshow-thyroid-symptoms-and-solutions) and combating thyroid issues is super easy, you just take the hormones the doc prescribes and you're done. In civilized countries these will be free."
NoTimeToKYS,fdjiqif,t1_fdjanfu,"Not sure if such reductionism is any helpful. Most people admit that they eat too many calories; But many don't know how to eat less of them. Not everyone who is overweight is lazy and gluttonous. And not everyone who is skinny counts calories or do meal prep. Having thyroid problems is definitely going to make it harder to be skinny, even if no laws of physics are being bended. Statistically speaking losing a good amount of weight and keeping it off is extremely rare, and I don't screaming ""you are just stupid, lazy and lack self-control!"" is going to do any good.

For example my case: while I've never obese, I never knew how to _actually_ lose excess weight. It was when I learned that you actually don't starve if you don't eat every 3 hours that I started losing weight. Fasting is definitely the best calorie restriction method _for me._"

It was really hard to lose the weight I gained, around 20 lbs and I thought it was from going from serving to a desk job. I just thought it was adulthood. Finding out and getting medication changed my life. I got my energy back and was finally able to lose weight. I am also one of the lucky ones. Some people have to chase their medication.

LAtPoly,fdkyilz,t1_fdkcbnn,"Not to be that ahole but until my neuro sorted out I had a gluten disease (gluten ataxia) I really struggled with weight loss. I would weigh and count calories and only see results for a short initial period (but I would never gain during those periods, I don’t believe it causes weight gain). 

Once I removed gluten from my diet, weight loss has been easy and consistent. My hormones and energy are more balanced. I’m not hungry all the time. Autoimmune issues can impact weight loss and metabolism both directions imo. 

I’m not saying any of those things make you fat. That’s not the entire story. But they can contribute to making it much harder to be successful with weight loss or maintaining a reasonable diet. 

That said, those things (if they apply) shouldn’t mean to give up and accept a state that’s unhealthy and dangerous. It means experiment and research and try to figure out what can help you get passed that allergy/intolerance/inflammation. 

And I wish the message the health community could share is: “Watch your weight and don’t let it slip.” The research does show its hard to lose it AND keep it off after some magical point. Your metabolism takes a hit. It’s not impossible and it’s still a worthwhile goal... and boy is fat logic real, but it’s harder than it should be on paper. 

Had I really understood that, I think I would have reined things in once I noticed the creep and others might too. The best way to not become overweight really is prevention."

The things are mostly oil-filled glands so 75% of its calories come from fat. Now it’s a popular food staple, especially among the working class. Anyway, flash forward and Samoa has a 75% obesity rate. Tuuuuuurns out it’s not just geNetIcS.

They might eat close to the same at some meals (although that’s a stretch) but then eat random crap all day. Nope. I just don’t shovel trail mix in my mouth while working a sedentary desk job. Or drink soda.

AChangeOfSeasoning,fdl42qi,t1_fdkbhww,"Let me also add something that people tend to forget. I was always one of those ""I eat like shit, why dont I struggle that much with my weight"" people.

A lot of that comes down to fidgeting. I do it constantly. Even when I sit still, I'll subtly flex random muscles in my body as a nervous habit, which is something that I recently learned isn't really normal. I also pace a lot - I'll talk on the phone for an hour or two and walk the entire time without realizing it. I'll also pace while talking to people in real life.

All of that has got to burn at least a hundred or so calories a day. Not much, but it certainly helps. I have found that I tend to lose weight faster than one would predict with my diet and intentional exercise, and I don't gain that much when I let myself go.

Edit: From a quick google, apparently fidgeters burn an extra 350 calories a day on average. Huh, cool."

Not as a weight control method but because they have a healthy relationship with food and their hunger signals."
MyBoyBernard,fdkxju5,t1_fdkhbjn,"Yea dude. The people who see me like 2 or three times a month think they can judge me. Imagine we go out for dinner on a weekend. I probably didn't have breakfast or an evening snack cause I know I'm about to eat a bunch of delicious food and drink a few beers and a couple mixed drinks. Also, if I go too crazy I'll likely sleep in and combine breakfast with lunch the next day. Whatever. That's all good and fine.

I did develop a bit of belly fat though when I hit around 40 years, still wasn't even close to the start of the overweight spectrum, but I have now got rid of that too (and keeping it that way) through calorie counting and cardio."
ceramicthumb,fdl9cg0,t1_fdl60qv,That may be your experience but that’s not accurate for everyone. You can eat 100 extra calories a day and eventually become overweight. That’s basically what I did.

MischiefofRats,fdl2ijr,t1_fdkon1y,"I dearly wish I could do that. Like, my life would be a thousand times easier. Intuitive eating requires reservoirs of mindfulness and willpower I *simply don't have* on a consistent basis. Like.... Okay, here's my best swing at explanation.

You may look at a box of donuts in the conference room and think, ""hmmmm... nah, I'll just eat lunch later,"" but I look, and then I think about how delicious it would be and which flavor is the best one left and how long I'm going to have to sit in this meeting and how much I don't want to be here and how bored I am already and how tired I am and everyone around me is eating and then I just go, ""fuck it,"" and have a donut. Even if I ultimately say no to the donut, it's a good minute or two of mental struggle and multiple instances of thinking about it *again and again* as long as I know the food is there, or it's in my sight. How many times a day do I have to fight this battle, you know? It's never-ending. And plus, so much socialization revolves around food. Say I'm not hungry but friends invite me out for drinks. I think, okay, two light beers is maybe 300 calories, that's not catastrophic, I'll limit myself... and then two hours later I'm twenty chips w/ hummus deep without even thinking about it, and I'm on my fourth beer, all to the tune of 700-900 calories.

I'm not defending this, but it's the reality of what I'm dealing with in my brain and body on an average day, which is most of my days as an average person. This happens multiple times a day with all kinds of food. Even if I exercised every day, which I don't because I hate it and I've always hated it, I could never out-exercise the crap I shovel in my mouth. The solution has to come from restricted eating.

My problem is that I don't have a normal off-switch, or a normal idle-system. Once in a while I can be on my game, a few months at a time maybe. I can keep an apple on my desk, look at a donut, ask myself if I'm really hungry or just bored, look at the apple, decide I'm bored, then just drink some water and move on with my day. Other days I've got six snack size chip bags in my office trash and I'm working through a sleeve of thin mints by 10am because I got a little stressed out. It doesn't work for me to just listen to my body because my instincts are *not healthy,* and the part of me that wants to be healthy is not in the driver's seat all the time.

At this point, I'm trying to find some sort of solution that works for me without calorie counting because even though it works, it's just not sustainable for me. It's too involved and requires too much consistency of routine. I lost 80 pounds counting calories a couple years ago, but as soon as something major happened in my life I spun out of control and lost all will to carry on. I gained a lot of that weight back. I personally am doomed to fall off the bandwagon and fail *eventually* when it comes to calorie counting. Intuitive eating definitely isn't the answer for me either, because I don't *have* intuition about food and my body, only constant cravings and weakness. 

My current approach is OMAD (one meal a day) fasting. I've done fasting in the past to a lesser degree. It works for me, but until now I've never tried it without calorie counting at the same time. And I mean, I'm not diabetic, I don't have any major health problems, it's fine, I'm not going to collapse or die. Ultimately it's mentally and physically easier for me just not to break the seal on eating at all. Being actively hungry for a finite period but not worrying about the *precise* content of my meals later (while still hitting a calorie deficit because I can only eat so much at one time) is less stressful for me than trying to make conscious, measured healthy choices all the time, every hour, every day, constantly. 

With OMAD, the rules are stupid-simple. 
1) It's either eat'o'clock or it's not. Dilemma solved.
2) Don't eat like a human trash fire. Done deal."
zzaannsebar,fdl5lau,t1_fdkon1y,"No it doesn't take *you* a lot of restraint to stay at a healthy weight. It is, in fact, a huge issue for a lot of people. Otherwise this sub wouldn't exist and obesity wouldn't be a problem. The big distinction is that your experience is not the same as everyone else's. It may be simple but it isn't always easy."
planetary_pelt,fdlilbn,t1_fdkon1y,"lots of things just come into play, though. even just a moderate nightly beer-/wine-with-dinner habit can be an extra 100-300 calories every day which adds up.

my girlfriend can buy a bag of M&Ms and inexplicably eat literally three M&Ms every few days. 

i can't stop eating M&Ms until all of them are gone despite shame and not even being hungry. i just don't buy M&Ms, ice cream, etc.

but it's a lot more complex and varying than you're suggesting. else everyone would be thin. it's like wondering why nobody else does 300 pushups a day while watching netflix like you, you actually consider it fun, it's not that hard! just doesn't seem like you've spent more than 10 seconds thinking about it."
superstitiouspigeons,fdl5ic2,t1_fdkon1y,"Your brain is wired better and you can eat ""normally"" without thinking. You are VERY lucky. Some people, like myself, will have to track forever. I cannot trust myself to just ""eat"" because I will always overeat a bit. I start to slide, gain a little. Over time, that becomes a LOT. Then you get used to eating more, and you add a little more to that. Tracking keeps me honest and aware of what I've had and how to adjust."

iamsnarky,fdlcy9c,t1_fdl14kr,My snack is popped at home popcorn that I control the toppings of. I eat popcorn like the cookie monster eats popcorn. I also only eat 2 meals a day if I'm lucky and that is my only snack. I also only snack 1-2 times a week. But people will see me inhale popcorn and wonder how in so skinny.
fakemoose,fdldh7w,t1_fdl14kr,"I commented on that too. The amount of mindless snacking I see all the time honestly grosses me out a lot. My SO and I might have gotten in a fight or two before over him snacking just before dinner, and then eat the same as if he didn’t, or eaten out of a bag of chocolate chips (yes, like for cookies) shortly after we had just ate a bunch and been drinking.

He’s not a small guy so it wasn’t an issue of budgeting calories or them evening out in the end. 

Plus it’s so rude to be snacking while someone is literally  finishing up cooking food for you to eat."
hedge-mustard,fdlb5lk,t1_fdl14kr,"That, or all they do is have little snacks throughout the day and don’t eat full meals"
Anariinna,fdmosbs,t1_fdl14kr,I snack all the freaking time. On plain cherry tomatoes tho
SamuraiSnark,fdnjet6,t1_fdl14kr,"Ever since I started dieting I've snacked way more often. The difference is though now I actually plan out my snacks. I measure out the serving size and put them in small plastic bags so they are ready for me later.  I will usually have two snacks a day between meals, sometime adding an extra one if I'm feeling more peckish. So I have more snacks but like I probably eat less in a day on three snacks than I did in one sitting when I used to mindlessly snack."
HungryZealot,fdmci4j,t1_fdm8t29,"Even eating a ""salad"" at a sit down restaurant can sometimes kill your day. There is a Quesadilla salad at Chili's.

synalgo_12,fdmeu3n,t1_fdldvrq,My mom and I still laugh about how we thought portions were supposed to look. Sometimes we sit down and go over everything we'd traditionally eat on Wednesdays (after market day) and it's hilarious but also nauseating.

I also lift 45-60min/day, 5 days/wk, and if I go back to my failure routine then I normally burn around 4,000-4,250Cal/day on those days. This is how I do my cuts. They're quick at about -2.5lb/wk and I'm getting ready to go back into one for a 20lb loss by the beginning of April."

ThreeLeggedTranny,fdmy825,t1_fdmqagy,Well yeah. Lol.
FrancisOfTheFilth,fdm7aox,t1_fdl9cg0,That’s how most people become overweight. Years of slowly gaining pounds and they don’t really notice because it’s not a huge difference at first. Then they look at pics from 3 years ago compared to now and they’ve gained 20 pounds
Cuglas,fdkx9md,t1_fdkqf32,"I’ll also add that I can fall asleep anywhere and wake up early every day without caffeine. When people ask how to wake up without an alarm clock and coffee I just shrug and say go to sleep earlier (which I know is impossible for most people). Some things bodies can do without outside help, other things they can’t."
MischiefofRats,fdl3jr7,t1_fdkqf32,"My experience matches yours. The only difference for me is that I've had to admit calorie counting can't be the permanent answer for me, because it's only a matter of time before I fall off the wagon. It requires a consistency of routine and extremely strong habits, which were not my best qualities. 

I'm currently trying OMAD fasting (or variations of it) to see if I can find a simple balance in just not eating so often. Finite periods of active hunger are less mentally stressful to me than habitually weighing chicken or measuring veggie slices for snack bags I won't want to eat anyway."
celebrationstation,fdl7zzt,t1_fdkqf32,"Preach. My therapist basically gave me permission to keep weighing all my food and counting calories. I was concerned about passing on disordered food behavior to possible future children, but I also need to live a life I’m happy with and model other healthy behaviors, like maintaining my healthy weight. My maternal family all have the thrifty gene and the type II diabetes/obesity/PCOS to prove it. We’re all bottomless pits for sweets. The buck stops here."
Throwawayuser626,fdlylua,t1_fdkqf32,That has always been my issue too. If I don’t count calories and really watch how much I eat I still put on the pounds even on things like vegan diets. Because I’m uncontrollably hungry all the time. I literally feel like I’m starving to death 24/7 when I’m not on my meds. No matter how much I eat I’m starving. I have to monitor everything I eat.
allieggs,fdlgftg,t1_fdl2ijr,"This really spoke to me. I just spent the holidays with the naturally thin side of my family. They had pantries full of junk food, and they seem to have to cook a multi course meal for every meal, every occasion. They just...don’t eat any of it. They eat maybe a handful of chips and then they’ll stop without wanting more. They’re very sedentary too, so it’s not like they were offsetting increased caloric intake.

I’d been successfully maintaining my happy weight leading up to that vacation. But I put on a few vanity pounds that I’m not happy with there because I had no idea how to handle that food environment. They’re very much the “showing affection through food” types on top of that. So I ended up saying yes to a lot of food I didn’t truly want. And snacking some more on other things that I would never buy myself. 

Like, yes, a lot of people are thin because they create healthy food environments for themselves. But there are just as many people who just don’t want a lot of food on their own."
ceramicthumb,fdmf2dn,t1_fdlilbn,"That’s partially why I love tracking calories. I don’t need to feel guilty for that entire bag of M&Ms as long as it fits in my calorie budget for the day and I eat healthier (not less calories, just more veggies and stuff) for the rest of the week to make up for it.

Also, it allows me to be like “I have enough calories for one square of chocolate” and then actually follow through and only eat one. Whereas with “intuitive eating” I’d eat the entire bar right away and just purposefully forget about it."
deedeebobana,fdm7g36,t1_fdkr2tl,"Downvotes are for this:  ""It's not that hard""

You are never hungry, so sure it's not that hard.  For you.

And yes, it is a simple concept regarding how to lose or maintain weight (CICO) but it is fricken HARD to do once you have already built habits that leave you with cravings and hunger. 

You are simply one of those types of people that have managed to consume exactly what your body needs.  No more, no less.  Most people have to work at that."
tryingtomath,fdlurms,t1_fdkr2tl,"The thing is that it sounds your appetite meets your needs well. I'm happy for you for that, but it doesn't happen for most people. When I don't actively track and diet, I end up eating more than I need, even while eating healthy. You're saying that everyone has an easy relationship with food, when anyone's who's struggled with their weight knows otherwise. 
You wouldn't tell an alcoholic that you don't restrict your drinking, just have a drink once in a while but not too often. Same thing. Yes it should work as you say it does, but for most people, it's not nearly that easy."

sweetberrywhine,fdlrxo6,t1_fdldh7w,I feel you 110%. And the CHOCOLATE CHIP GRAZING!! Whyyyy do they do this? I have to hide them now or I’d literally be buying a bag twice a week.

TinyDogInAHoodie,fdnb31r,t1_fdlt5zj,"Just want to raise my hand and tell you there are frustrating downsides to having a low appetite as well. I'll often feel very unenergized and cranky and I *know* I need to eat but I just don't feel hungry. Then when I do eat I get nauseous because eating when not hungry at all is just not pleasant.

But yes, it is easy to stay slim. I still often wish for a normal appetite because meals are an almost daily struggle."
zzaannsebar,fdl5dcf,t1_fdkx9md,"Ugh I feel this in my soul for both your responses. My natural self would eat cheese, bread, and ice cream until I died if I let it. I would also have a sleep schedule of something like 3am-12pm if I could (thanks Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder) so as a result I have to be careful with what I eat and also carefully balance my caffeine intake to let myself be both productive and fall asleep at night. My usual morning starts with no less than three alarms and me constantly running behind getting ready because I'm too groggy to have an efficient morning routine. But I can't get up earlier because then I am even more tired and just end up setting more alarms and then be in the same position anyway. 

So that spiraled a bit but still reinforces your point. People's bodies are different. Like mine seems to have trouble regulating much of anything without medication (thyroid meds, stimulants, sleep meds, allergy meds...)"
Cuglas,fdmc02r,t1_fdlylua,"Preach! I was vegan for 2.5 years, did strict keto for 3 months, IF 16:8 for half a year, doesn’t matter - my body wants more *more* MORE.

I hear you!"
VeitPogner,fdlxqry,t1_fdlgftg,"Out of curiosity, if your family isn't eating all this food they buy and prepare, what's happening to it?  Are they throwing most of it out?"
MischiefofRats,fdmel31,t1_fdlgftg,"Exactly. All of this, exactly. My family is a love-through-food family too, only literally all of us are overweight. My mom pushes food like it's her job. My aunt looks like I kicked a puppy if I refuse to take 30 cookies when I leave because I don't need that shit around me. My grandparents eat out like fifteen times a week. Most of them are allegedly baffled as to why they can never lose weight, but none of them are interested in the real reason, and it's *so easy* to get sucked in.

That environment is so important--when I lost all the weight last time, I was living by myself and walking/hiking all the time. I had complete control of my food environment and worked in an office without a lot of lunch options near enough--I had to bring my lunch every day. It was easier, but it still wasn't *easy,* because I can't just not want food, pretty much ever. I dearly wish I could, but I can't. I can overeat on healthy food like chicken and broccoli just as easily as overeating garbage like pizza. It's always been hard and it's going to be hard for the rest of my life. I'm not accusing naturally-thin folk of having magic metabolisms or trying to claim I defy thermodynamics; I eat too much, every day. It's just not as easy as *just not doing that*, because I always want it. It's an addiction and it's conditioning I've been experiencing since birth."

carbondioxide_trimer,fdmkeai,t1_fdmk0p2,"I do feel really good. Or rather, I notice the difference when I don't run and how lethargic I get when I don't get it in.

It took building up to that for sure cardio wise over the course of 6 months. I used to just lift 60-90min/day, 6 day/wk. I was 280 lb at 30% bf and didn't understand why I didn't look like the other guys in the gym.

Started restricting calories and **slowly** increased cardio. When I noticed how much literally **any** cardio had on my weightloss I kinda went crazy with it and really pushed myself.

In my experience, if you're trying to just lose weight, I think a good caloric deficit and a decent cardio routine to further extend that deficit works well. Muscle building and weightlifting can come after.

If I'm bulking then I only run 20mi/wk MAX which is basically 30min/day.

Also helps that I find running to be very meditative in general. Some good music and I fall into pace with muscle memory and I just zone out."
tryingtomath,fdnvaw9,t1_fdnb31r,Oh I didn't think of that. I'm a bit less jealous now 😂.
Throwawayuser626,fdmcd5r,t1_fdmc02r,I only lost weight because I got on amphetemines and cigarettes honestly. They kill my appetite. Lol I dunno why but I have the appetite of someone who smoked five bowls.

They also love to have guests over, and they push the food on them too. 

They’ve asked me before how they can help the 7 year old with his weight problem. I could never put my finger on it when they did. But I’m realizing now that it probably won’t happen unless the whole family changes their approach to food. And they themselves don’t actually need to."
allieggs,fdmg1fa,t1_fdmel31,"Oh man, this gives me war flashbacks to when we were about to leave their house, and my grandma literally shoved a whole bag of macaroons in my brother’s backpack. And this was after her insistence on cooking a large meal for us before we left almost caused us to miss our flight. My grandma and my one cousin are the only overweight people in that household. 

And even then, my grandma is overweight because she’s, like, 4’9” and eats like her more average sized family. She doesn’t understand why we’re so concerned about weight. Part of that is that she didn’t become obese until she was elderly already, so her body didn’t suffer the effects. She also grew up in the middle of a mass famine. 

I mentioned in a different reply that they’re all concerned about the cousin’s weight too. The cousin is such a great example of how people are wired differently in terms of appetite. The rest of the family got away with that fucked up food environment because they don’t want that much food. But this guy is insatiable, and he *does*. They’re already starting to fat shame him. But I have a hunch that the only way he’ll shed the weight is if they all completely overhauled their relationship with food. And they don’t want or feel the need to do it themselves."
Muckl3t,fdkgahr,t3_eluhvm,"It can sometimes work like that. If you’re a 5’1 couch potato and you eat the same amount of food as your 6’3 athletic husband then sure, you’re not fat  because you eat more than him, you’re fat because you eat too much for YOUR body. People don’t get that it doesn’t matter how much other people eat. Everyone has different caloric needs."
bookhermit,fdkkoip,t1_fdkgahr,"This was my thought exactly. Someone fat could even eat the same as someone thin even though the are the same age, sex, and height, but the thin person never sits still, runs daily or does a spin class every other day, is a dancer, walks to work etc, and the fat person lives their life chair to chair, waking up from sleep to drive to work to sit at a desk, drive home, sit on the couch and go to bed. 

Acknowledging these differences or the fact that they don't see 100% of the thin person's life to make a proper judgment would mean that they are, in fact, in control of their lifestyles and could change easily and that's just unacceptable."
NorthernSparrow,fdkq00i,t1_fdkgahr,"Yeah, it’s not that a fat person eats more than every thin person. It’s that they routinely eat more *than they need* (for their height, weight, age, sex, & activity level)"

Uhm, right. I’m not saying eat the same as me. I’m just saying eat a little less than you do now?"
SlytherinSister,fdlgmyi,t1_fdkgahr,"Exactly. There are differences between heights, sexes and activity levels.

wahooo92,fdmhuei,t1_fdkgahr,"I think a lot of people underestimate the amount that lean muscle mass and physical activity changes your TDEE. 

Having recovered from an eating disorder that destroyed any muscle mass I had to becoming a competitive powerlifter, I went from having a TDEE of 1200 to 2200. People NOW tell me I have a ""naturally fast metabolism""."
kadytheredpanda,fdn5aft,t1_fdkgahr,"I'm 5'2"" and at my peak weight I was 100 pounds heavier than my other family members (even the ones a couple inches taller than me). None of us are fit, but I'm sure that my shorter height and lower ideal caloric intake contributed since I was usually eating the same amounts of food as the rest of my family members. Maybe more, sometimes, maybe even less, but if we had popcorn with butter, for instance, it'd basically work out to the same amount for each of us after refills, etc."

sexysexandsex,fdkpsod,t3_eluhvm,"I’m so confused by these people’s idiotic, contradictory pseudoscience. They are always saying that losing weight requires restrictive (disordered according to them) eating. So, if people only lose weight through restriction, which is true, then how can you turn around and claim that weighing more has nothing to do with eating more? Those two things are mutually exclusive. If calorie intake has no effect on weight, then restriction should not result in weight loss. 

I’d like to ask them, what happens when anorexic people do not eat at all? They become emaciated and lose weight rapidly, right? Yes? Ok, then how can you claim that the opposite, eating lots and lots of calories, does not result in weight gain? 

STOP THE LIES. If you want to be taken seriously and gain traction as a social justice movement, stop lying to yourself about the FACTS. Accept the objective truth and build your movement around those facts. You can still fight for fat peoples rights, health and happiness without lying."

Then we had dinner and you could almost see the wheels spinning in her head. Her eyes darted from my plate to hers, then my husband's. She looked at our glasses of wine and measured sip for sip. She didn't have a second helping, and had much more salad than usual. She didn't ask for dessert. I think she wanted to suggest I was eating less on purpose, but my husband didn't know anything that happened before dinner, and she watched him even more than me.

She was subdued for the rest of the evening and left early, but in the morning I got a teary call. She was upset, and wanted me to know she stopped at a drive through on the way home, and thought about being mad at me for making a fool of her. She wanted me to know she slept on it, contemplated her breakfast choices, and for the first time in her life, turned the box around and read the ingredients and nutrition information. She was eating about 4 servings of cereal instead of one. She asked me for the name of that English show.

I think a major problem is the idea so many HAES people have is that all food is created equal so to them more food is just a surface area comparison. People really just don't know what is in there food and they are too fragile or scared to count calories and learn."

grocery order to bigger people. In addition to the larger order thing you mentioned, they do have things like full calorie soda, donuts, a lot of bread products, fruit juice, mac and cheese, chips...

Plus this morning I got what everyone else would get at Starbucks: a drink and a small pastry (a venti vanilla bean frap with extra whipped cream and an old fashioned donut, to be specific) 

At dinner, I cooked at home like all these thin people tell me to. I made a meal with loads of nutrients. I made a large homemade pizza with lots of pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms and peppers (see!! I eat veggies),  and cheese (gotta get that dairy intake!) and washed it down with a large sweet tea. 

Plus I get lots of exercise at my very physical office job everyday. I have to walk to my car and back everyday! 

After dinner, I had a light snack of potato chips plus a small desert: a slice of chocolate cake (literally everyone eats these things everyday)

On days I get 10,000 steps I have usually done an extra 20 minutes of running (or 40 minutes of walking).  That's barely 200 extra calories for the day.  It is misleading to think that the exercise you suggest will make a dent in maintaining or helping weightloss without a plan for maintaining dietary changes."

AuntieApocalypse,fdr2c1t,t1_fdqrota,"I can't remember which YT reaction channel made this point, but she commented (in response to a nearly 600 lb woman praising the fit on her Torrid dress) that when you're that big that you can't really afford to think about the quality of the cut or fit --- you have to consider yourself lucky when something reasonably fits your body at all. She was speaking from experience since she'd been morbidly obese and has since lost a substantial amount of weight.

Someone else who used to post here commented about why higher end plus-sized clothing (not oversize, but plus-sized) often had to be a shapeless drape: since fat distributes so differently among different people's bodies, there's no way to know where two different people who are 500 lbs will carry their fat so, to fit the widest number of customers, it's safest to just make every part of a garment blousy.

Fashion isn't the be all and end all of the obesity pandemic, but FAs calling out manufacturers for being fatphobic is misguided; they seem to me to be dealing with the best reasonable response to extraordinary problems.  It's not as though clothing manufacturers don't want to sell more clothes to their growing (individually and demographically) clientele: they're doing the best they can with a problem that functionally didn't exist for them a mere thirty or forty years ago."
Skyttlz,fdqsrsl,t1_fdqrota,Ugh at my thinnest I felt comfortable in skinny jeans (I was overweight but I do carry rather evenly). Didn’t wear revealing clothing or anything. But now it’s back to bootcut jeans and sweatpants 😂 I still have my favourite pair of jeans that I am desperately waiting to fit again. Some things just look better when you are smaller rather than bigger.
babyitsgayoutside,fdr8cxi,t1_fdqrota,There are some female fashion advice subs that are great for this!
LadyLavendel,fdqv1uv,t1_fdqt2pe,I'm 5'9 with a long torso and most high-waisted pants sit just below my bellybutton. Anything not high-waisted is just plain inappropriate on me.
butimapanda,fdqt74a,t1_fdqt2pe,I bought a couple of target leggings a while back. One was marketed as high waisted. One was not. Both ended up being high waisted -_-

darksilverhawk,fdrlbrz,t1_fdqt2pe,I bought “short” jeans yesterday and I still have to hem them.
Throwawayuser626,fdrsh73,t1_fdqt2pe,I’m the complete opposite. Jeans end up being high waters on me most of the time. I wear lots of “undersize” clothing.

Boacham,fdrpnmh,t1_fdram31,At least you can hem them. Tall people cant add more fabric so every jean is above ankle length.

tsukinon,fdtdhty,t1_fdr2c1t,"> they seem to me to be dealing with the best reasonable response to extraordinary problems. 

That pretty much describes everyone responding to issues caused by obesity.  I’m not saying to value profits over people, but if everything is supposed to not just accommodate but cater to every size then the cost would be devastating in a lot of cases.

And I don’t think anyone at any size hasn’t had things they liked, but just didn’t fit properly.  The problem with extremely fat people is that they’re dealing with body shapes that can vary vastly and a limited demand for clothes at that size meaning there are fewer choices because there just isn’t a market for them.  Even though people are getting fatter overall, there still aren’t very many 6X and above people."
MasticPluffin,fdraz31,t1_fdqv1uv,"Same, but my problem is dresses with a cinched waist. The waist of the dress ends up way above my actual waist and that looks really stupid. Like I'm wearing a child's clothes that just happen to fit width-wise. If I size up it's too big everywhere else. 

I'm sure it's hard to find clothes for people who need a very big size, but they're definitely not the only ones who struggle with that. A lot of us who wear straight sizes have more unusual proportions. Sometimes it's possible to make things work, other times not so much."

Thanks though!"
Fauxe_y,fdryo5h,t1_fdryedz,"That’s tough, sorry friend :( 

Also I totally forgot 4’10 and 4’11 were a thing ha - in my head 4’9 was right next to 5’0 so I thought you guys were a similar height.

LadyLavendel,fdquaey,t3_emszsq,"Oversized clothing is cut differently than regular clothing in larger sizes. An oversized medium still fits a person who is a size medium.

rumbusiness,fdrnyzj,t1_fdquaey,"Yes, quite. I'm a UK size 6/8 (US size 2/4) and my favourite jumper at the moment is a huge, soft, hot-pink V-neck from TopShop. I live in it. It's massive, but it would look awful on someone much bigger - it's designed for someone of my size, to look huge"

InspiredBlue,fds8vc4,t1_fds7o6q,Lol no no my bad. Apologizes I didn’t mean it to come off that way.

All that energy could be used for taking care of yourself.
browneboy,fdsabyb,t1_fds8vc4,"Exactly then they put all their effort into criticising oversized clothing , something so trivial .... what a joke 😂"
InspiredBlue,fdsbatg,t1_fdsabyb,Lol like they don’t understand that some clothes were meant to be oversized. I myself enjoy wearing an oversized shirt/hoodie and some leggings. But god forbid I complain about some really overweight girl wearing a bikini.
browneboy,fdscf5d,t1_fdsbatg,"This hits home, i have a couple oversized champion sweatshirts , they referenced in the tweet,  and even if they’re in medium it’s more like an xl. And the fact that larger people are complaining at it seems a bit ridiculous to say the least ..."
InspiredBlue,fdsf4dj,t1_fdscf5d,Yeah. Some shirts were just designed to be baggy. Also I’ll never make fun of someone for being overweight I just want to point that out but what do my clothes have to do with you? I’m 145 lbs which isn’t too bad for being 5 ft 7 and go to the gym regularly so I’m fairly slender and getting more fit. I’m gonna wear whatever the hell I want. This reminds me of the time some overweight chick got triggered by a granola bar that forger 21 sent in her package and it turned out that they send everyone those bars lol. If you’re triggered by a granola then you’re more insecure about your weight that you’re letting on.
bookhermit,fdqr8y1,t3_emszsq,"How about you just focus on your own fabulous self, hmm?

FAs: It’s not oversized for me!! 😭

Bitch, if I put my sweater on a baby, it would be oversized relative to the baby. It doesn’t mean my sweater suddenly becomes a comically large shirt made for an obese giant. Not everything revolves around you. 

Oversizedness is generally relative. Example, if I’m a bartender serving a single shot of whiskey in a large glass, than there’s not enough whiskey to fill it and the whiskey is in  an oversized cup. However, if I serve lemonade in that same cup, and fill it up, the cup is no longer oversized.

See what I’m talking about? The cup’s size doesn’t revolve around the whiskey or the lemonade, the cup is the cup and the drinks are the drinks.

As such, The sweaters size doesn’t revolve around the person who’s wearing it. It may be oversized on me, but not on another person, or vice versa.

I expect 8 year olds to understand this concept."

KuriousKhemicals,fdre1wl,t3_emszsq,"Oversized does NOT just mean larger. It means certain dimensions are given extra length or slouchy/baggy look while keeping other proportions normal for the size it is labeled. Larger sized items can be adapted to look oversize on a smaller person, but often you end up with some annoying aspect that isn't really helpful or attractive being too big. For example, I have a nice warm wool sweater and it's like an XL or something so I wear it as ""oversized"", but in fact it's just an XL and when I hang my arms normally the ends of the sleeves drop almost all the way to my fingertips. An oversize style in S or M would fall somewhere between the actual wrist and the base of the thumb because it's actually meant to fit someone my size."
yogiscientist317,fdregsg,t1_fdre1wl,Yes. This was basically what I was going to say. Wearing something several sizes too big gives a different look than wearing something that is deliberately cut to be oversized.
neverfeardaniishere,fdrgem4,t3_emszsq,"Oversized literally just means it's made larger than a typical size small or medium or large (whatever the tag says) so that its comfy and a bit big on a person who would usually get that size...

Fred-ditor,fe8frrw,t3_entcia,"Body positivity isn't something anyone should be upset about.  It's about being happy with your own body and loving yourself.  It doesn't (or at least shouldn't) mean that you don't try to eat healthy, exercise or lose weight.  It just means being happy with yourself. 

Unfortunately there are two separate things.  

1) People who shame overweight people suck. That's why the ""body positivity"" movement exists. 

2) People who use ""body positivity"" to be negative towards anyone suck.  The backlash against ""body positivity"" is because of them. 

Passing around memes and talking negatively about ""body positivity"" is number two. You might only intend it towards the actions of the outspoken few but when you broadcast this message you're not just sending it to them.  You're being really negative towards a lot of people who are just trying to love themselves at their current weight.  

I am a fat guy. I used to be fatter. I'm trying to get skinnier.  I am proud of what I've accomplished so far. I took my shirt off at the pool yesterday.  It felt amazing even though I'm still twenty pounds more than dad bod.  I expect to lose those twenty by spring. But for that one day i was body positive at my current weight and it felt amazing.

ToadLicking4Jeebus,fearbr9,t1_feaildp,"No.  A gram of muscle weighs the same as a gram of fat.  However, there will be more volume/space taken up for a gram of fat compared to a gram of muscle.  Finally, the muscle will use up more calories (not much, but some) than fat (possibly excluding brown fat, but that's a whole other thing), which will also result in a net gain from a metabolic standpoint.

But yes, having the same weight in muscle vs fat added to your body is going to look a lot different, even if the weight doesn't change.  And I've seen plenty of people who GAIN weight (through building muscle) from their starting point still look a LOT slimmer/better/healthy than their starting (lower) weight.  In other words, they lost 10 lbs of fat, but put on 11 lbs of muscle, and now look like they lost even more weight than 10 lbs, even though they technically weigh more than when they started."

In general, chicken and pork have about a 2/1 calorie ratio between calories spent and calories obtained. Egg and dairy are about the same. But cows and sheep are grass eaters, they hate the grain we use to fatten them up, so they give a 20/1 calorie ratio which is objectively terrible.

Omnivores who eschew beef (or at least spring for grass fed) have about the same carbon footprint as vegetarians. In terms of environmental impact, while we mostly eat too much meat in general, it's beef that's really fucking everything up."

SaltFinderGeneral,fdifnfv,t1_fdicy1t,"Possibly, but not necessarily. I think price is ultimately going to become a big limiting factor for the forms of meat that are currently most popular in the western world (or at the very least in North America), which is likely to result in fewer people consuming beef regardless of any other factors. Especially with the big demographic shift in agriculture that's coming up over the course of the next decade or so in the western world we absolutely have the chance to change how we handle livestock in a big way without being forced into never-ending factory farming. I might be overly optimistic about this kind of thing (I run a small regenerative market garden so I kinda have to be optimistic about people changing their eating and purchasing habits), but it's possible.

I should point out I don't disagree with the premise 'people should be eating less red meat', my issue is more with people who pat themselves on the back for eating less beef while still eating large amounts of things that are produced in a manner that is detrimental to the environment. That is to say, I agree people should not be eating so much factory farmed beef BUT I don't view simply swapping it out for factory farmed chicken (or whatever else) as being a good enough alternative, and I'd much rather see people find local, regenerative or sustainable farms and get ANY kind of meat from those sources (bonus if it's something like chicken or rabbit, but if it's pork or beef so be it) instead.

Personally, if I ever got a job commuting to Seattle (which for me, would be and hour commute via bus and maybe 45 min by car depending) a bus pass has to be part of the perks, or at least paid parking. I got a job on the east side and the bus commute and the car commute would've been about the same amount of time.

olivish,fdhpo1a,t1_fdhouin,"Right. The picture gets pretty complicated pretty fast if you consider that, when obese people lose weight, it's usually because in addition to eating less, they also eat different *kinds of foods.*

I'm not aware of any studies which investigate this in a way that would be helpful to this discussion, though. So it's hard to say if production of animal products would decrease proportionally to the decrease of total calorie consumption or not, in our imaginary scenario of everyone suddenly losing their excess weight and keeping it off.

One thing is clear, though. If the concern is environmental impact, decreasing consumption of animal products (esp beef) would give you the biggest bang for your buck. Even if everybody stayed fat, if we cut out animal products we'd see a very meaningful impact on C02 emissions, far greater than the 1.6% contributed by obesity, which I cited in my other comment.

http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/

So I guess my conclusion would have to be -- and I didn't know I was going to this place before I started this comment -- that all other things being equal, a lean omnivore is probably worse* for the environment than an obese vegan.

*as measured by their diet's carbon footprint"
olivish,fdhmvwe,t1_fdhidyf,"On that note, a recent study has suggested that ""the total impact of obesity may be extra emissions of ~700 megatons per year of CO2eq, which is about 1.6% of worldwide GHG emissions.""

That's taking into account the manufacture and transport of the extra food. 

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.22657

Not sure how else to quantify food waste; I can't find a source on the poundage or even volume of the waste, but I wonder if that's meaningful anyway. 

If you add this on top of what we throw away everyday (both at point of production/manufacture, as well as at home) - which recent studies placed at 30% of total food produced globally & about 8% global GHG emissions - the picture gets even more depressing.

This is a bit simplistic, as for one, it doesn't account for early deaths due to obesity (dead people eat nothing) nor to the elasticity of the global food supply. A fat American is doing very little to take out bread out of the mouths in a war-torn African nation or unstable Venezuela. People aren't hungry because fat people are eating their food.

But I could barely push my toddler in his buggy, hills were pretty much impossible, and my hands were permanently white/yellow down to the knuckles.

I knew this was not right, so I told myself I should take the stairs except when carrying groceries or a big package, when it would be OK to take the elevator.

Yet somehow I always found excuses to take the elevator.  ""I'm just tired!""

I resolved to lose weight last year, mainly by eating right but by sprinkling in a bit of exercise after I've lost enough flab that the slightest movement wouldn't wear me out. A few weeks into it, I bought a Fitbit, and it prompts me every hour to get 250 steps. Which means I've walked all the corridors of my building, and all the stairways. I've continued to lose weight (down 42lb now!) and get this moderate exercise every day - and now I can climb 7 flights with only a slight increase in breathing and heart rate at the top.

And now I really do follow my rule - always take the stairs unless carrying groceries or a big package."

GozerDestructor,fdqv842,t1_fdqschi,"I got the tiny one because I worried that something bulkier would be more intrusive when trying to sleep with it. In practice, I haven't really used the sleep tracking function much - even the smallest fitbit is kind of noticeable. I don't easily get back to sleep if I'm woken up in the middle of the night, so this was a major concern.

I haven't researched the others, but I'd prefer something with more buttons, as the swipe-swipe-swipe-swipe user interface of this one is annoying, especially because I can't reorder the screens and skip past the ones I don't use to get to the few I do."

The_Swoley_Ghost,fdo8apy,t1_fdnyxmy,"MOSTLY true.  I know a few skinny-fat people who have type 2.  They are stick thin everywhere except for their belly, which is like a miniature beer-gut.  Imagine a tall thin man but who appears to be pregnant.  Definitely not ""obese"" and according to BMI measurements not even ""overweight.""  That being said, they drank a lot and basically lived on hyper-palatable carbs.  Diet of vodka, snickers bars, and popcorn.    


They were shocked to find out that they were diabetics since they were ""so skinny!""   


Being fat really helps makes the process easier but diabetes is just a fancy way of saying ""you eat more food than your body can produce enough insulin to absorb"""
A_Glass_DarklyXX,fdobmvn,t1_fdnyxmy,"Diabetes 2 has more to do with diet and nutrition. You can be skinny and if your diet is horrible you can put your organs at increased risk. There’s a correlation between obesity and poor eating habits and therefore diabetes. You can’t be overweight without eating poorly (is not just too much but also the wrong things) hence why obesity is a marker for increased risk of diabetes. 

In my line of work I meet a lot of people who aren’t as overweight as Lizzo but are dying/suffering from type 2 diabetes related illness. They look more like Zack Galifinakis or Tony Soprano and his sister Janice(Im struggling with thinking of overweight celebrities for reference. There’s not that many!). They look like the average person with a tire around their stomach, sometimes skinny. Usually they have really poor diets- lots of refined processed foods (chips, candy, white bread, sugar by the bucketloads), lots of soda, alcohol. The kicker is they tend to get a lot of exercise. They walk a lot because they are homeless and low income  and don’t have cars but are still active around the city. However exercise doesn’t matter if you’re drowning your organs in poison constantly for a period of years. The sad thing is so many low income people don’t have much of a choice"
teemose,fdpyicl,t1_fdnyxmy,"Skinny People can have high levels of visceral fat (internal fat you might not necessarily see) coating their liver, which I think is what they're saying is the cause of type 2 diabetes.  This also means it can be reversed (lose the fat on your organs)."

Do you mean thiamine?"
tsukinon,fdpwths,t1_fdoamm6,"The good news is that dementia caused by a thiamine deficiency is reversible.  It frequently happens due to pernicious anemia and, if the pernicious anemia is managed, the thiamine goes back to normal and the dementia goes away.  

This is why I always push people to get older relatives with cognitive issues to get screened.  If you’re really lucky, it can be caused by something reversible and, even if it isn’t, a lot of meds that treat the caused of dementia are more effective when started early on.

I don't know if this is true but I did see a teledocumentary with a doctor who was discussing how people who survive to become that super-morbidly obese develop T2DM at a lower rate than those who are a ""mere"" three or four hundred lbs.  He said that it wasn't clear why the rate of T2DM drops off but they suspect that, broadly speaking, people who actually survive long enough to become 600 lbs (or more) probably have tremendous constitutions and, counter-intuitively, might be genetically blessed in the sense that most people would be killed by the health issues caused by that level of obesity long before they reach that state.  If that is true, then they're sort of the opposite of people like us who are clean eaters, active and fit and at a healthy weight in terms of T2DM: they won the genetic lottery.

KuriousKhemicals,fdqipoj,t1_fdpwx5o,"Exercise isn't going to help with dementia caused by vitamin deficiencies.

The thiamine-deficiency dementia is most commonly found in alcoholics because of the triple whammy of nutritional replacement of food by alcohol, gastric irritation reducing absorption, and exacerbation by the intrinsic toxicity of alcohol. But it is also occasionally seen without alcohol consumption in other circumstances where vitamin availability becomes extremely limited, generally when body stores were already marginal due to poor diet and then an acute episdoe of dietary restriction, prolonged vomiting, or poisoning occurs."

There is a very similar discussion in the world of competitive bodybuilding.  For a while the use of steroids was well-known but the details were hush hush.   We would see people get horrible side-effects and have to quit after only a few years or a few harsh cycles of powerful androgens.   The idea that the biggest leanest pros weren't just on a ton of drugs, but were on low-medium doses of optimal combinations with healthy lifestyles was pushed by a lot of people.  ""He's actually just genetically gifted and needs way less than the average person to get the same effects, so less side effects from high doses.""  

This is true for a SELECT FEW.  Now that things are more open and many old pros or their friends have come out into the open with their drug stacks we see something else... that many of the biggest pros were on even more gear than we ever imagined, but had comparatively little side effects.  Two people could take the exact same steroid stack.  Person A might get disfiguring acne, significant left ventricular hypertrophy,  horrible sleep quality, sexual dysfunction, male pattern baldness etc... Person B might have none of those, might even feel better than before.  Person B might be able to take two or three times as much and still not have the same level of side effects as Person A did with the lower dose.  

I've seen that many times in my short career training individuals. I've talked to pros whose drug stacks would ruin most people, yet are [relatively] unscathed."
tsukinon,fdtaba7,t1_fdqipoj,"Yes, but it seems to help lower the risk of a lot of other dementias.  Unless someone is regularly consuming large amounts of alcohol, then thiamine induced dementia isn’t the type of dementia that they should really be worried about.  And if they are consuming that much alcohol, then thiamine induced dementia isn’t the biggest health issue they’re facing."
tsukinon,fdtbu4f,t1_fdqmrpu,"I don’t think it has any B12.  If you’re vegetarian, dairy products are your best bet.  If you’re vegan, tempeh, nori, fortified cereals, and fortified nut milks are you’re best bet.  If you’re not eating foods high in thiamine, getting a blood test and supplements are your best bet.  A dietician told me that B12, calcium, and vitamin D were the only supplements he really recommended (absent a known deficiency in other vitamins or minerals) because they were harder to get in a plant based diet."

No...no...it's obviously some bogus hate and fat people are totally just closet Olympians. 

It's pathetic to think most people get winded on two flights of stairs. Maybe it is closer to reality that the average person will in the US though. As our average is overweight.

But still absolutely shows how little they understand health. One shouldn't be proud of getting winded so easily.

My A1C hasn't moved in the years since then, though, so it seems to be holding even.

I always repeat what my doctors and dietitian said to me: continuing to eat well, exercise daily and maintain my weight is likely to help significantly with managing this issue.  They told me I might put off the progression to diabetes by a decade or even more and in the likely event it does become necessary to medicate it it will be much easier to manage with meds if I'm not adding strain to my body with bad habits and extra weight.

For many diseases, there's never *not* a benefit to taking care of yourself even if you don't completely avoid the problem or can't reverse it.  My doctors didn't say this so I'm guessing, but for all I know if I were obese and living on snack cakes I might have developed diabetes in my twenties and be on tons of medications (and suffering all the side-effects of those medications) for twenty years now."

I love them as burrito wraps. Beet greens are superb wilted (over roasted beet, Golden are amazing if you don’t like red ones).

The broccoli cooking trick of leaving the lid off? Saw it on one of Gordon Ramsey’s shows. Looked up the reason. Figured out it was the same reaction as decomposing that was releasing the H2S (which is actually toxic, my theory as to why we find the scent of it in such small quantities gross).

The Maillard reaction was a cooking show maybe? A TIL? I don’t remember, I just know that when I learned there was a scientific name for the ‘brown bits’ I’d been taught to deglaze a pan for was super cool. Read up on it and remembered (the speed wiggles you get when skateboarding right before falling off? Also has a name, the Hunter Affect, and high speed trains have to deal with it too. Super nifty).

She died in 2008 and I bought the house. Unfortunately I got divorced soon after and my decision to keep the house has stained me financially and I haven't been able to get it done, as much as I want to.

Also, idk about every pool obviously, but the one that I worked at in high school and college had a larger handicap stall and shower in each bathroom, but the family bathroom also doubled as our ADA-compliant shower and bathroom facility. We had the handicap-accessible shower and bathroom in the regular locker rooms, but they had been retrofitted into a building originally built in the 1940s--it was still a tight fit. I feel like it's a pretty standard thing to combine the two.

When she was told no, she talked down to me and said I should know better than to be in the locker rooms when they are so full (Umm, you're contributing to the crowd too lady. Maybe you should have left early).

Anyway, when I left the locker room I was shaken up enough that a friend asked me what was wrong.

Accessible bathrooms and family bathrooms are one and the same pretty much everywhere (which is bullshit on it's own, kids generally do not have actual accessibility issues, it's simply a convenience thing and I would hate to take that space from someone who actually required it), this was not remotely a dig, it was some employee trying to make it easier to wrangle multiple children."

Also also when I was at my heavier crying that I couldn’t just naturally be thin anymore he’d calmly say “ok then you know what you need to do: either accept yourself as you are or change it. It’s that simple.” He was never mean or pushy just calm and to the point.

The question implies that the OP is happy with him (""I think he's not far off normal"") and wants to be supportive to help him lose a bit of weight. It's the guy himself who considers himself ""morbidly obese"" and is pushing to lose it. And yet the reply goes off a cliff completely attacking the person asking and accusing them of being a massive fatphobe who is pressuring the poor innocent ""abuse victim"" fiance?

I bet that the person didn't actually read it, just skimmed and got keywords that was permission enough for them to rant about their own hot topic issues with ""a fatphobic environment"" and ""well-meaning fatphobic relatives"""

AuntieApocalypse,fduu8sw,t1_fdu7cpz,"The casual invocation of trauma was so frustrating. It flashed me back to a therapist I encountered while therapist shopping in the US who just. would. not. accept that I didn't have trauma in my background. She wouldn't let it go. It wasn't because of anything I wrote in the (twelve page long OMG 🤦) background form she made me fill out, but just because, according to her, *all* people have trauma in their lives. I asked if she didn't think that trivialized real, acute trauma by flattening distinctions between discomfort or mild displeasure and trauma.  I don't remember her response.  Finally she cast about and pointed to the simple facts that I'm gay and my mother is a Christian as evidence of ""trauma"" (this has never been an issue for us).🤦 I just turned into that SpongeBob meme, paid her and left knowing that anyone so committed to finding trauma that she's willing to manufacture it and create rifts between families where they don't already exist and sussing out perpetrators of trauma is more about herself than her client (and I'm not paying someone for the privilege of being their therapist). 

But think about the sort of person who would respond to that sort of approach and who would be eager to find trauma and oppressors and perpetrators of trauma --- and who would be eager to follow that person and all her wild accusations. That person is ripe for the picking for this sort of HAES advocate. Going along with this stuff is an easy way to deflect your current discomfort and discontent, project it onto others and make it anyone's issue but your own --- and it's also a great way to stay stuck in that discontent."

TheNamelessOnesWife,fdxlsmm,t1_fduu8sw,"Unfortunately that probably is a lucrative system for her to obtain clients. Like the FA group always looking for an external thing outside of their direct control as the reason why their body is overly fat. Even therapists aren't above being awful human beings. Personally I don't understand people who look someone right in the eye and lie to them, knowing that this lie is creating harm. Like the therapist using information you gave her to try and create and conflict between you and your mom. It is horrifying people do this. However, people need to know this sort of evil (for lack of a better word) exists and to be wary of those offering solutions and support, just like how a fair amount of people someone selling you something isn't looking out for you, they are only looking out for themselves. Some people don't get that essential oils can feel nice but a scented candle would be of the same benefit, just spend money if it makes you happy and you know it is a frivelous thing. It's very sad"
TwoRiversGirl,fe3h8wx,t1_fduu8sw,"This is really interesting.  The same phenomenon is going on with PTSD, where people are having it pushed on them as a diagnosis whether it fits or not.  Western volunteers did this in Sri Lanka after the tsunami and these people didn't even have a concept of PTSD in their culture!  

In the US, those in the military are some of the primary victims, and often find themselves struggling after their diagnosis because they can't relate to PTSD support groups or literature or counseling.  We have also conveniently omitted one of the MAJOR criteria for a PTSD diagnosis: ""the feeling that the government has lied to and betrayed you"".    This gave Vietnam vets with PTSD something to bond over and something to fight for when they came home.  It helped give them a purpose.  This criteria alone shows why you cannot ascribe a few choice symptoms to a disease like PTSD out of convenience."

He doesn't understand proper portions and cannot judge what a reasonable serving is. Therefore he takes more than he can possibly eat and leaves other members of the family without a meal. My limiting this behavior is not me abusing him. It is me imposing limits on a child who is not yet capable of limiting himself.

AuntieApocalypse,fdyv55y,t1_fdx0k4w,"That we're taking it for granted that ""thin"" bodies are the norm and fat bodies are deviant (i.e., ""deviant"" because they deviate from that norm). Her argument is that our use of language both reflects and reinforces that assumption (e.g. we don't have words to describe thin bodies because we take them for granted as being normal but we have a whole lexicon to describe fat bodies because we recognize them as deviant. The recognition of deviance makes us particularly aware of fatness and impels us to ascribe qualities to that deviance through speech).  

It's a convention of this sort of analysis that privileged people have the luxury of not needing to name or categorize themselves because privileged people aren't seen as noteworthy enough to bother creating an extensive language around. But oppressed people or groups who are somehow deviant are striking to us because of their departure from the norm and are endlessly named and described so they can be identified, categorized, scrutinized, regulated and, ultimately, oppressed. (Another current example that they might give would be how we never really called people ""cisgendered"" before recently because we took it for granted that that was the norm and didn't bother naming it, but we've had lots of words and descriptors for trans people and usually for the purposes of identifying its deviance and categorizing, scrutinizing, regulating and oppressing the deviants). Words are powerful for reflecting and reinforcing the order of things in this sort of analysis.

In hindsight I don't know if that explanation made her article more or less legible. But I pecked it out on my phone so now I feel invested so I'm going to post anyway. 😂

(Oh, and FWIW I'm describing her foundational theory not commenting on it one way or the other. Just sayin', since I get people crying ""SJW!!!"" or ""Fascist!!!"" every time I try to objectively describe another person's logic and argument on Reddit. Apparently on Reddit you can never understand and lay out another person's argument without actively adopting it. 🤦)"
santaliqueur,fdxz9tw,t1_fdx0k4w,"And with this, she is successful.

The point is to misdirect and confuse, thereby allowing them to control your language on the matter. If you are on your heels from something she says, that's exactly where these HAES bullies want regular people to be. Scared to offend them."
Putnum,fdzsztk,t1_fdx0k4w,Fat people are getting fatter. It's not her point or her excuse but it's the scientific reasoning behind her definition of 'average'.

muppet_knuckles,fdyhfv3,t1_fdxz9tw,"Right?? They go beyond science, logic, reason, other's results, everything, and make it into a moral problem. ""I'm not going to do a single thing to change *MY* body but damn it, I expect you to deal with it and me and all the fog of garbage I'm spouting about how to look at every possible place for a cause except inward""

sheffieldasslingdoux,fdyrtoj,t1_fdxz9tw,The thing I find strange is the co-opting of intersectional language around race and gender. They so desperately want to be a recognized as an oppressed minority or protected class.

It's not broad enough to be a catch-all general interest site but it's not quite narrow enough to have a clear and unwavering party line.

It just, I have never ever seen so many enhanced people in my life (there were like 4 women with breast implants one day, and was like whoah), so many super fit people or the opposite people on stereoids (boyfriend likes to point it out). Also it was first time seeing people wearing full makeup to gym, waist trainers (I thought at first it was something to help with lifting) and even shaping spandex under the gym clothes. In the gym back home there are just usually people running. 

Also what was amazing to see in the USA gym was old but but fit folks. That's my inspiration too.

But hey as compared to that, the beach people at San Diego, that was nice, they seemed to be kinda fit nice smiley folks. Maybe that's why it had become my favourite city in USA. I loved the chill vibe."

No kidding? You mean like *everyone else's body*?

>Often, when I talk to people whose bodies are smaller than mine, they struggle to name their own size.

Yeah, no.  As many of us on this sub have observed FAs have two concepts to describe bodies: ""thin"" and ""fat"" (even the iterations of fat are just extenders of fatness: superfat, infinifat, etc.).  We have loads of words to describe bodies that are within a healthy weight range --- athletic, skinny, willowy, stocky (not a synonym for fat, though it's often used as a euphemism for it), etc. --- and different descriptions for body shapes that mostly transcend size: pear-shaped, apple-shaped, barrel-chested, etc. I'm at a healthy weight, but no one would ever call me ""thin"" or ""skinny"" which are the only two words FAs have for us.

And we have plenty of words to describe bodies of all sorts because we're a visual species and can observe others' bodies. One American grad student's reticence on this issue doesn't change that and doesn't signal the ""thin privilege"" of being categorized as the norm from which your body deviates. Mind you, there are meaningful body norms to be observed --- I'm not pretending to dispute that fact and I'm unwoke enough to be unapologetic about accepting that conventional norms of bodily health, for example, have some significant validity to them --- but this isn't the issue of privilege you're painting it to be.

I'm not even getting into the bullshitty psychodynamic overtones of this.  You don't want to ""center"" cis het white men as the norm to the degree that you'll actively reject their theories of the body, but you're *totally fine* with drawing on the theories of the psyche that...also derive from almost exclusively from cis het white men? How convenient, hypocritical and self-serving. (And given the nature of psychodynamic theory, unsurprisingly anti-scientific)."

at my highest weight of 180lbs i wore size 14- and fuck it as the average. i was 'thick' and so fucking ashamed of myself in my own skin. and going to the doctors and getting weighed and seeing that i was that high weight just barely below obesity? that woke me the fuck up.

call out BMI all you want- bc yes, it was invented in a similar fashion to the G Factor, as a way to convert numbers to data and try to find a healthy medium. neither BMI nor IQ (g-factors follow up) are perfect at all. but they are one of many TOOLS used to help sus out if there could be something wrong. but, you dont just use one. you take that data with a grain of salt and use different tools. and then take the collective data and average it out.

BMI = not great data (not terrible but error prone at times)
BMI + food logs + exercise logs + calipers = pretty fucking accurate"
thisisathroawayk,fdyj4y6,t3_en9y8m,"Er...not to discredit what you’re saying, because I agree that sucks, but you know how averages work, right?

All of the sizes are added together, then that number is divided by how many data points there are, then that number is rounded to the nearest size.

It’s math, not fat logic.

Edit: I read the article after commenting. The article definitely is fat logic.

Frankly, I think the issue here is that mathematical terms like average were adopted in the first place, because the two definitions ‘not thin but not fat’ and ‘literally the mathematical average’ can be conflated which cause major confusion if the new average is fat.

So, instead the issue may be redefining average as overweight and reconciling what it means to be the new average. We must strive to be healthier than average."
Melia2005,fdypte1,t1_fdyj4y6,"With regards to statistics, ""average"" means more than 50%. So if you say that the average American survey respondent has 3 alcoholic drinks a week, that means at least 50.1% of Americans who answered the survey have 3 drinks a night. It's nit the same as the mean, which is why research based math will use both terms (mean and average). I blame grade school math teachers for using the term ""average"" but describing the mathematical method of arriving at the ""mean"". It should be taught that the mean and average are two different terms, the former applying to mathematics and the latter applying to statistics. It would go a long way to making research easier to understand."
tyrannosaura,fe2iw2i,t1_fdypte1,"This is not what average means.  I believe you're thinking of the term ""median,"" which refers to the central point of the data.  If you were to list each survey respondent by how many drinks they have per week (e.g. 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2) the median is the value in the middle of the list - it would be ""1"" in that example.  You could also describe the data above by its ""mode,"" or most frequently occurring value - also 1 in this example - or by its average/mean.  

&nbsp;

While there are slight differences in meaning between the words ""mean"" and ""average,"" in the vast, vast majority of use cases they refer to the same thing: the arithmetic mean of the data as calculated by adding each individual value and dividing by the total number of individual values. The mean/average in this case would be about 0.89. Speaking as someone who works with (and teaches) research methods and statistics, we generally prefer to use the term ""mean"" instead of average but no one will be confused if you substitute one for the other."
thisisathroawayk,fdzj50h,t1_fdypte1,Now I’m really confused. So over 50% of Americans are a size 18? How?
Melia2005,fe6bla3,t1_fe2iw2i,"This was highly confusing for me, your reply that is. So I spent some time looking it up and thinking about it. I think it's more likely that I was thinking of the mode - the most frequently occurring number. Or percentiles. It's still not something that I'm completely certain of. While I was looking up percentiles that seemed more accurate to what I was thinking of. But that's not really how it's talked about, or how I had heard it described. I am specifically talking about whenever something occurs more than 50% of the time. If more than half of the respondents to a survey answer one way, or if more than half of the results of an experiment come out one way - I've always heard that described as the ""statistical average"". So I guess I don't know what it actually is, mathematically. Maybe it's just more of a layman's definition of the term average"
Melia2005,fe0ywar,t1_fdzj50h,"I don't know that they are. In the article one citation simply says that the average is size 16-18, but another citation says that 68% of American women are size 14 or above. However I can't find the actual study for the second one, so who knows how accurate it really is. As for the first one, the full article about the study is behind a pay wall, so I don't know what method they used to get to that conclusion.

But, it's been known for a while that more than half of all [Americans are overweight](http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/vast-majority-american-adults-are-overweight-or-obese-and-weight-growing-problem-among). So it's not surprising that more than half of American women wear size 14 or larger. From the article it's difficult to know what percentage of American women are size 18 or above. But if size 14 really is the smallest plus size, then it's probably safe to say that more than half of American women wear plus sized clothing.

A simple way of saying what I was trying to say earlier (something that just occurred to me now): statistical average just means more than 50%, mathematical average is what you were talking about - adding the figures together and dividing that by the number of figures.

I hope this clears up some of the confusion. I'm happy to try to answer any further questions"

Now, as a Canadian, I know that Aritzia is small. I'm a 8-10 in most places, but at Aritzia (if I could afford their clothes, which I can't anyway) I would be a size 12.

This vlogger was *outraged* that the size 12 didn't fit her, because 12 was her usual size. That made me realize how much the US has shifted their sizes faster than the rest of the world. From my perspective, she would be at least a 16, maybe an 18. But she wears a US size 12. She had her friend, a US size 8, try it on, it fit her, and they both went on a rant about how that made no sense and was so bad for girls' self esteem.

Most of the people who serve, or have served, in the military are not really what you would call policy wonks. Because, and I was very typical of this, when you join the military as an enlisted person (which is the overwhelming majority of people who have served), you are usually very young, very idealistic, and pretty fucking naive. You have neither the education nor experience to really do deep dives into what's wrong with specific policies. Also, the brainwashing/indoctrination your receive in your first several months in the military do not encouraging questioning of policy.  The military exists for a very specific purpose, and that purpose is not the forming of policy.  You don't find the kind of people who can inform policy until you get into the ranks of senior career officers, and their viewpoints and goals are going to be colored by their military backgrounds.

Stramenopile,fecr4qp,t1_fe8qdtq,"There are certainly many fat people with advanced degrees. People may have discipline in one area and not another. Or prioritize academics over physical health. However, I wouldn't be surprised if people who study medicine, or specifically research nutrition and obesity, are more likely to be thin. Just based on what they are forced to confront in their studies."

Just remember: correlation doesnt equal causation, you cant just cherry pick data to prove your point, and if your only study to back the claim that ""diets don't work"" is the one where people with binge eating disorders were given diet plans and sent on their way: good luck getting published in any reputable journals. That study was done in the 1950's so have fun getting laughed out of the room because you came to a false conclusion about a 70 year old study."
msbeaver83,fe9s6sh,t1_fe93zws,"I saw a more recent one on an eating disorder website, It was talking about how 95% of dieters fail and gain the weight back.

diaperedwoman,fdu10sm,t3_emyyf6,I have no idea who she is so I looked here up and she is some song writer singer. I assume she is a fat activist?
tsukinon,fdu4occ,t1_fdu10sm,She’s a singer who is fat and sings about self-love and wears revealing clothes that some find inappropriate for her size.  The only real connection she has to fatlogic (based on anything she’s said publicly) is that a lot of people want to present the fact that she’s fat and does “high energy” shows as evidence that weight is completely unrelated to health or fitness.
Earshrapnel,fdv7611,t1_fdu10sm,"She's fat, she loves herself, and she gets a lot of shit for doing stuff that is considered mandatory when being a conventionally attractive female artist and that annoys her and other people with her. She's not a fat activist. She's just fat.   


She also blessed me with a situation where I got to see actually FAs break down and implode over her doing Good as hell (which is one of my favorite songs to bike uphill to) with Ariana Grande and feeling zero remorse for doing so, actively ruining their fat anthem."
pineapplequeenzzzzz,fdxb43m,t1_fdu4occ,She did a IG interview with Jameela Jamil that really went into a lot of FA stuff. It was pretty sad. She definitely has taken on a lot of ideas from the movement
agawl81,fe9jqqt,t1_fdu4occ,"I've never seen where she was giving out health and diet advice, so I really don't think she'd be FA material except that Jillian Micheals (who just happened to not be invited to the Biggest Loser reboot) keeps bringing her up in interviews. 

If Lizzo were promoting fatness as healthy it'd be different, but she isn't. She's just someone who happens to be fat and do things, which I think we on this Sub should be all for because doing things is hella better than fat and sitting at home. 

&#x200B;

iamNaN_AMA,fdxj6dd,t1_fdxb43m,Noooo whyy. I love both Lizzo and Jameela and this hurts my heart
tsukinon,fe0nuex,t1_fdxb43m,"Ugh, the hypocrisy of that blow my mind because she’s always calling out people who *she* thinks are setting an example for young girls and basically blaming them for girls who develop EDs (when they causes are a lot more multifaceted and complicated).  I suppose it doesn’t matter if Lizzo could be a negative influence on young girls because those girls won’t have Jameela’s type of ED.  

(Side note: I hate those diet teas and I’m not a particularly big Cardy B fan, but her [response](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/a25319149/cardi-b-claps-back-jameela-jamil/) to Jameela was hysterical.)"
pineapplequeenzzzzz,fdygypo,t1_fdxj6dd,Yeah they're both pretty far down the rabbit hole. I was seriously disappointed. Especially with Jameela. Whyyyyyyy
agawl81,fe9jvwv,t1_fdxj6dd,"I admire Jameela, but at the end of the day she is a lay person sharing her opinions, so she isn't going to always be correct in her assumptions."

veganmacaron,fdyuqeu,t1_fdygypo,"BC she's a recovered ED survivor and ""diet culture"" in the modeling industry is actually real, so her messaging and ideas are really important to ED survivors, and she hasn't thought through how to extrapolate to people with overeating disorders.

I do like her ""body neutrality"" idea that your self worth and body size are distinct, but I would like to push that a step further: because your body size has no bearing on your worth as a human, admitting it is unhealthy and that you need to make changes for your own quality of life should not be tied to your self worth. Admitting you are obese and endangering your health is a separate question from ""do I look beautiful enough to be worthy of love?"""
tsukinon,fe0wf7o,t1_fe0o7p4,"Same.  I pretty much know where the restroom is wherever I go, just in case.  It’s a horrible thing to wish on someone."
pineapplequeenzzzzz,fdzc69j,t1_fdyuqeu,I fell in love with her because I have bulemia too. I think the hard thing with generalising EDs is they're all different. I was treated for anorexia when I actually had bulemia and it has had a terrible impact on my life. My bulemia is so much worse because of it. So while there are bits of her message I love I think she has attached herself to a movement that is absolutely terrible for people with bulemia so I guess it makes me double angry
tsukinon,fe0o6hg,t1_fdyuqeu,"> t I would like to push that a step further: because your body size has no bearing on your worth as a human, admitting it is unhealthy and that you need to make changes for your own quality of life should not be tied to your self worth.

Why is this so hard for so many people to grasp?  Anyone who says that someone’s value is tied to their size is horrible, but refusing to acknowledge that body size is connected to health is just as awful and dangerous in its own way."
pineapplequeenzzzzz,fe0ybxn,t1_fe0wf7o,One of my fellow digestive issue ladies said it's a really humiliating issue for a woman to have. If guys are gasy they can laugh it off and kinda get away with it. If you're a girl you're disgusting and feral. I thankfully have my farting under control but when I had bad days I wouldn't leave the house because I was too ashamed
Geodude07,fe6h95b,t1_fe0o6hg,"It's because people are not after their health. The FA movement is pure hubris with a very thin veil of ""social justice"" painted on. 

They don't want to be average or just anyone else. They want to be celebrated. They want people fawning after them. They do not want to change, they want the whole rest of the world to change. To them it's a victory when someone thin is accused of having an ED. It's okay to critique how someone else looks or to call them names like skeletal or talk about their eating habits."

cheskababy,fdumejx,t1_fdtvegd,"Or, HEAR ME OUT, her music is ... good?"
agawl81,fe9k3sn,t1_fdzf1tx,"Agreed. She isn't giving health advice, she's singing songs and being a typical celebrity, which means dressing outrageously and being photographed doing things. (Look at Gaga, as soon as she was solid A list she started dressing much less provocatively)"
m1stadobal1na,fduss3j,t1_fdumejx,"Dude she's so good. I mostly listen to underground hiphop and bluegrass, never pop, but I fucking love Lizzo."
menina2017,fea50ll,t1_fe9k3sn,"Exactly. What if she decides to lose weight? Everyone will have a tantrum like they did with Adele? 
People need to stop projecting their ideals on to celebrities who are strangers to them! 

And Lady Gaga actually also went through some pretty noticeable weight gain and loss. People need to stop micromanaging celebrities weight. It’s just weird!"
cheskababy,fduw4r5,t1_fduss3j,Yeah she’s my guilty pleasure. Truth Hurts bops. Which hip hop artists do you listen to?
ketogize,fe06nlg,t1_fdx172r,"I don’t think it’s okay to shit on her for existing. She’s an artist and she does her thing and she seems to be more of “unapologetically fat” than “fat activist” which is totally fine. It’s not her fault she got turned into this HAES icon or whatever. 

Though the point of my comment is that I really don’t like her music haha. I thought it was funny that the first time I heard a song of hers I had the same thought you did in reverse (I genuinely can’t imagine liking her music). But I really don’t like hip hop or “talking instead of singing” type music in English except for very specific songs from the 90s and early 00s, and pretty much exclusively listen to jazz or indie folk. It truly is amazing how different music tastes can be."

carson63000,fdznv1v,t1_fdzbpp6,"I didn’t “go out of my way”, I replied to someone who took it upon themselves to tell me that I should check out Lizzo’s music, saying thanks but no thanks and giving them my reason why.

If anyone has a problem with that, then I *do* think they’re treating the music they like as a sacred cow, and getting huffy that not everyone shares their taste.

skinnymeanie,fdxsa8r,t1_fduz4yp,Congratulations on your weight loss.
reunitedthrowaway,fdv5m9c,t1_fdtcjnr,I gained a lil weight. Like. Five lbs. But up uni then I was lighter than my middle school weight. And a little taller than I was then as well.

It was a combination of things. I was always, always fat. Bad relationship with food, lack of knowledge, lack of activity. I'm always gonna have a bad relationship with food, I just have to try and keep it at bay

I lost it all naturally"

cardie82,fdtbwba,t3_en29tf,I went into the military right out of high school. Three kids and almost 20 years later and I can still fit into the uniforms that were issued to me at basic training.
Tar_alcaran,fdwwgbl,t1_fdtbwba,"I was fat, then got skinny, then got muscular. I fit in my old ""fatgirl clothes"", but not in my skinny phase outfits."
TankVet,fdwrjzw,t1_fdtbwba,"Seriously? That’s amazing. Almost everybody I know who joined the military put on A LOT of muscle. Not that the weight they gained was bad, but they definitely got much bigger."
cardie82,fdyw0nl,t1_fdwrjzw,I don’t bulk. I’ve got a slender build and even when muscular am fairly slender.
metsaema,fdw114p,t3_en29tf,"I don't think this is fat logic, it runs true for many woman and it isn't being apologetic for obesity... there is a long way between obesity and a size 0. I think this is the exactly kind of body positivity we need... not everyone is going to be a size 0, and even less people will be a size 0 for all their life. It is ok... there is a range of body types that are actually healthy (and no, an obese body isn't one of them) and we should be realistic about it. 

Also, I find funny people putting themselves as example of this being untrue because they were obese in high school and aren't anymore and you just aren't the target of this message? It's explicitly talking about girls who wore a size 0 at high school. 

If you hadn't wrecked your body during your young years, it's common/natural that you will be slightly bigger into adulthood because... you grow up. The 16 and bearing kids are just a simplistic language choice to express this process but I really don't see a problem here."
BonnieBeru,fdwbcqq,t1_fdw114p,"this, im literally the same weight as i was in high school, but different proportions, more hips/boobs and smaller waist, and while i can still fit into my uniform it just doesnt fit the same"
Rustys_Shackleford,fdwnt8u,t1_fdw114p,"Honestly I’m glad I read this today. I’m currently pregnant and a healthy weight, albeit on the upper end of healthy, and I’ve been very upset and stressed about my weight gain and body image. I was a size 2 and 99lbs at 5”4’ in high school and before pregnancy at 30 years old a size 4/6 and 135 lbs - and I beat myself up all the time about it and feel super chubby. 

But having some body fat doesn’t mean you’re unhealthy or “fat”. I’m still way normal in terms of health and while I don’t exercise as much as I should, I’m still physically fit because I have a physical job that I can more than keep up with because I eat healthy foods and stay moderately active. 

I know a lot of people can’t do this and stay on target but, I don’t count calories on Thanksgiving, sometimes I have chocolate after dinner, sometimes I order a medium fry instead of small and all of that *is okay* when you’ve learned to moderate your eating because that’s a sustainable life. That’s also why I’m not 10 lbs lighter, but I’ve realized I’d rather indulge occasionally than restrict continuously and that’s still okay - because I can have a healthy body that has some fat on it and a bikini model body, while attainable, shouldn’t be the end-all-be-all of attractive and healthy. Not everyone’s goal has to look the same."
enoenoeno,fdwvoga,t1_fdw114p,I agree
KuriousKhemicals,fdwbqmw,t1_fdw114p,"Even apart from the extra weight (I wasn't obese but like 15 lbs over a 25 BMI or 30-40 lbs over my ideal weight), my height and hip width was done around 13-14. I think it's hard for some people to imagine body changes after high school when they've been physically adult since middle school, even if we theoretically know that's a developmental path some people go through. And it does mean that the way this is stated in absolute doesn't apply to a lot of people, yeah they use size 0 as an example, but it's an extreme one - even among thin late blooming teenagers, how many are a size ZERO? The fundamental message is ""you'll never be as thin as you were in high school"" and that's incorrect for many people, for varying reasons. Only if you were a healthy weight AND late developing, which I expect is a pretty small minority, does the basic message apply."
PretendLock,fe04l6e,t1_fdwbcqq,same! It feels like I went through a second puberty in college. The ~20 lb I gained gave me actual boobs that I got to keep after I picked up weightlifting and lost the extra weight lol
-poogle-,fdtdrup,t3_en29tf,"If you are literally talking about a size 0 I think that's fair, especially considering many women report that their hips are wider post giving birth even if they return to their starting weight. It's common to be still developing in highschool and put on a few healthy lbs in their hips and/or chest area. I know I am more curvy now hip wise than when I was 16, even though I'm right about at the same weight. If you were low end of healthy (which is often the case for healthy teenage girls) there's nothing wrong with putting on a few lbs into adulthood, not everyone was overweight in highschool, definitely not if they were a size 0"
treemanswife,fdtz57y,t1_fdtdrup,"I was a size 5 in high school.  Still have the jeans but can't *quite* squeeze into them.  Meanwhile, my newest pants (same brand) are a size 2 and need a belt.  Oh, and that's after 3 kids."
mushroomsandyoga,fdtgedk,t1_fdtdrup,Yeah I was a thin but healthy teen and my body changed sooo much after age 16-17. I was a size zero again a year ago and my BMI was 16 - so very unhealthy.
kabea26,fdww5w6,t1_fdtdrup,"That’s fair. Honestly, I’m actually excited for what im going to look like after I have kids. I have narrow hips compared to my chest, so I’m very top-heavy and I hope my hips get a bit wider to even that out."
Mollyscribbles,fdyapm2,t1_fdtdrup,Might depend on what that brand defined as 0 when you were in high school.
rokzann,fdu5bol,t1_fdtz57y,There's so weird! Do you think they shrunk or do you thing the brand started vanity sizing?
secretlyaraccoon,fdvx8h0,t1_fdu5bol,"Could also be the size 5 was a junior’s size, so they were made for a less curvy body"
treemanswife,fdwwwer,t1_fdu5bol,"100% vanity sizing.  I don't blame the brands, though.  Americans are getting bigger, and nobody wants to wear a size 30.  Not many people are going to complain about fitting into a size 0, though.  There are several major brands where my size has gotten labeled smaller and smaller over the years.  Or just cut entirely - I can't buy adult women's jeans in brands like Levis anymore.  The smallest size is usually a 2, and it's too big.  I buy juniors styles or specialty brands now :("
KuriousKhemicals,fdw9mo9,t1_fdvx8h0,"Odd number sizes are usually juniors, but theoretically a 4 adult correlates to a 5 juniors so being a loose 2 suggests vanity sizing creep also."
rokzann,fdy1rm5,t1_fdwwwer,"That's so frustrating! I'd rather wear size 30 than not have clothes at all! I'm a rugby player so I'm built a little larger, and when I fit into size 4 stuff I'm so mad, bc I just know that means that people built smaller than me won't be able to fit into clothes, just so I can wear something that says I'm smaller than I probably am! 😡"
treemanswife,fdy5flb,t1_fdy1rm5,"There just aren't enough Americans my size to be worth selling clothes for them :(

Luckily, in the age of international shipping I can get clothes from pretty much any other country, all of which fit me.  Except Swedish brands!"
gradchica27,fe4rgz7,t1_fdy1rm5,"YES! I am not a small woman—5’4”, 127-130, lifter trying to more build muscle (I played rugby briefly in college but bc I was “small” they expected me to be fast. Well....I was a disappointment there!) and when a flippin’ size 0 dress is too big, it’s annoying! I am definitely average in my friend group—plenty are thinner than I and some larger, so I figure if I’m sizing out of a brand meant for late20s-40s, where do my friends get clothes that don’t look ridiculous on a 40 yo? And what’s going to fit after I recomp and lose more fat? And when I get older? Bah."
rokzann,fdy72s1,t1_fdy5flb,"Why not Swedish brands?? I wanna knowww 

I mostly shop at thrift stores nowadays to minimize plastic waste and it's so weird how I can fit XS all the way through to L in different brands.  thank god for my sewing machine."
treemanswife,fdy97ij,t1_fdy72s1,"Because I'm only 5'2"", which is about the size of a Swedish 12 year old!  Scandanaviens are generally tall and pretty fit, with clothing sizes to match."
rokzann,fdya156,t1_fdy97ij,I think you mean 10 year old 😂 but at the same time Scandinavian clothes are so pretty
treemanswife,fdypqsr,t1_fdya156,"I know!  I've actually bought some stuff in kids sizes - now that my boobs are gone, I can fit kids outerwear in 160cm.  Long johns, too, since kids styles aren't any different from adults."

Moderatelyhollydazed,fdtbr00,t3_en29tf,I weigh less now than highschool and also less than elementary school.
gradchica27,fdtoe6w,t1_fdtbr00,"I probably weigh the same or slightly less than I did in 6th grade...just found a pick in the attic of me in a skirt (somewhere 4th-6th garde ish, I think) that bizarrely I still have and can STILL fit in today, in my late 30s."
silent-avox,fdtmi40,t1_fdtbr00,Would it be to rude for me to ask what your stats are between now and elementary school?
Moderatelyhollydazed,fdtojed,t1_fdtmi40,Lol idk if it's rude? I weighed 200lbs in grade 7 (12 years old) and I am a muscular 195 now. Working to lose another 30lbs to get to a healthy BMI
chimmyloo,fdvtt5v,t3_en29tf,"Honestly, speaking as someone with an eating disorder, this image helps me a lot! I was 85-90 pounds in high school and went up to 116 in the following years. I’m 100-103 these days, but I do see the value in this text post. Sometimes it helps bring me back to reality."
clostri,fdu455u,t3_en29tf,Why is bear capitalized for emphasis?  That's the wrong word to stress in this sentence and reading it sounds so bad.
aliceiw82,fduutkq,t1_fdu455u,"Because getting pregnant is one thing, actually carrying to term and the pushing the baby out is harder and more dangerous as a teenager because while you can ovulate you are not yet “ready” to have a baby. Of course it is possible but it’s riskier"
BonnieBeru,fdwarr2,t1_fduutkq,"yep, got my period at 9, very much not ready to have a baby"
clostri,fdx4oa2,t1_fduutkq,"I'm not really talking about it meaning-wise, just the fact that the rhythm is wrong in the sentence.  If you stress children rather than bear it's fine, but when you emphasize bear it starts to sound like the graaar kind of bear rather than the birth kind."
MasticPluffin,fduvfct,t3_en29tf,"I mean, sure, my body still looks different than it did when I was 16 (more muscle and boobs mostly lol) but my waist measurement is only 2 cm (a little less than an inch I think) bigger than it was back then. I'm 30, BTW.

I was slightly underweight at 16, though, whereas my current BMI is somewhere between 20 and 21.

I mean, she kind of has a point, but she also oversimplifying. Your body will probably change a lot between your teens and, say, your thirties, but you are not doomed to be fat."
scagatha,fdxbde5,t3_en29tf,"Eh, they're not wrong - there's a reason why juniors sizes are a thing and they have a less curvy fit than women's clothing. You could have the exact same weight as you did in HS but not be able to fit into the same clothes because the hips do widen into adulthood, even after the age of 18."
buttholeterminator,fdtoqtv,t3_en29tf,"This post is partially right, I won't be as skinny as I was in highschool cause I was 120 lbs at 5""8 and that's way underweight and I wanna be healthy so I won't go that skinny again"
ceramicthumb,fdweawk,t1_fdtoqtv,"It’s actually a healthy weight for a teenager, just not for adults. Children and teens use a different BMI system because their bodies are built differently."

Administratived,fdxnfsr,t1_fdweawk,"Yeah, tell my doctor who diagnosed me with anorexia for being a BMI of like 17.9 as a teen. Fucked me up and made me gain weight for years"
buttholeterminator,fdwjaqe,t1_fdweawk,That's true
lexxi_carnage,fdx6lbi,t3_en29tf,"Well, your hips can get wider after kids. I lost all the babyweight from my first son at 17 (birth control failed lol), but my hips were wider by a few inches, even after all my measurements were back to normal. I was extremely upset about it at first. This isn't bad advice honestly. I struggled with anorexia when I was a teen and it's been very hard to accept that i will never be THAT skinny again, cuz my body did change some. I can be a perfectly healthy weight but my hips ARE wider, I DO have some loose skin on my stomach that only surgery can get rid of, and these stretch msrks aren't leaving any time soon. I've been using every cream on the market for the past 9 years and they are still pretty noticeable"
Simplicityobsessed,fdwgup1,t3_en29tf,"I agree with it actually - but I think that c**ontext is important here**. This is also a great example of what I loathe about this community - they take legit pieces of research, or theories/approaches/data etc. (ED recovery ones ironically being one.... even though these people don't want to admit they have a disordered relationship with food lol), and twist it in the most irrational extreme way, to support their perspective or purpose. 

If this were posted on a mental health sub, or such.... I can totally see this being a good thing. Our metabolisms change as we age, so it isn't unheard of to put on a few pounds over the years. So a reminder to not beat yourself up over that? Totally awesome, IMO. However, I feel like the post isn't just talking about accepting a few pounds of weight gain, or the weight gain common with puberty.... and instead are speaking about people who used to be in good shape, or had disordered eating as a teen, and now have a very different type of disordered eating, or don't have any regard for their health at all."
timecube_traveler,fduuajt,t3_en29tf,"Tbf they have a point. Like, I grew out of pants at age 17-19 still even without gaining weight because that was the time my sad excuse for hips *finally* decided to show up."

PartyPorpoise,fdx5yp1,t3_en29tf,"Actually, teen pregnancies do have a higher risk of complications because their bodies aren't done developing. So, not a great comparison.

That said, I don't think the post is entirely wrong. A lot of people do grow enough after their teen years in ways that they're just not gonna be able to fit into their old clothes. And like, a lot of girls are pretty lanky in their teens and they get used to being ""the skinny girl"", then when they grow into their bodies more it's just not the same and that can kind of be a hit to how you see yourself."

MeAgain97,fdvehgu,t3_en29tf,"Okay so it actually is accurate for me. I was 90 pounds in high school when I was hospitalized for an ED. I lost my period for a while. Now I've had a kid and even if I could get back down to 90, which would be a terrible idea because that's a BMI under 16, I don't know if my clothes would fit the same. My body has changed shape and things are shifted. I'd obvs be skinny af but that doesnt mean my favorite pair of children's size 10 jeans would fit well again.

khaleesi_onthatbeat,fdwab48,t3_en29tf,"I was skinny fat because i played sports and hate like a horse. 

Then i was fat because i stopped playing sports and still ate like a horse. 

Then I started running and did a lot of HIIT bodyweight exercises and super low calorie and i was skinny fat again.

Then i started working out and playing sports again recreationally and eating like a horse but with more nutritional foods and high volume low calorie stuff like vegetables and less fried things and weight training and now i’m fattish but kinda slim thicc with awesome shoulder-waist ratio and less boob-bra strap fat and better posture and i look smaller than i was skinny fat but weigh almost 10kg more than i look like i do hm. Am i size 0? Hell no. Will i ever be? Definitely not, my hip bones alone are too wide for a size 0. Have i had kids yet? Nope. 

I think this kind of development does happen as we age too though. I definitely had a faster metabolism back in those days...it just depends on our eating and activity habits and genetics. A lot of people i know, especially guys, couldn’t put on weight or significant muscle until well after they were 20. For most women the weight gain comes from less stable eating habits, going to college, reduced activity levels and stress. 16 year olds are technically able to bear children but still physically developing and growing."
river_running,fdwdtoy,t3_en29tf,I mean this is true for me but also I did not have boobs when I was 16. My BMI was always borderline underweight in HS because I grew 4 inches right before I started high school and it took everything else a few years to even out.

Lucidiously,fdwdfcf,t1_fdvyxuv,">Your metabolism slows down and everything as you get older.

The rate at which your metabolism actually slows down with age is minimal, it's more that changes in lifestyle play a part in why we gain weight.

I was a skinny lean kid in high school, I played football 3 times a week, worked on my feet all day as a waiter and spent much of my free time skating, not to mention my body was also still growing. Now in my thirties I'm heavier, I don't work out that much, I've got a sedentary office job and like to spent my free time playing board or video games. I still like to eat like I did when I was 18 though.

The couple dozen calories I don't burn because my metabolism has slowed are nothing compared to the hundreds I don't burn because I'm simply less active than I used to be."

Regardless, it does make sense to gain weight over time, unless you are active/workout often.

I was <125 lbs at 5'6"". I will never be a size zero in jeans. That doesn't mean I can't be a size 4 in the right brand, but accepting that my hips are just wider was a good thing for me emotionally at that age."

Health can be defined a number of ways. The basics of heart rate, blood pressure, lung clarity, temperature - the initial screening - can reveal 'health'. This friend never did blood panels, fasting tests, cholesterol checks. I'd stake my tofu on all these numbers not being 'healthly'. They hear what they want to hear and stop listening.

Who’s healthier ? I would say my mom because my dads diet is like a 5 year old too much candy lmao but he never eats past fullness. My mom emotionally eats in front of the tv and eats when she’s not hungry. However the content of her diet is miles healthier than my dads. We have to force my dad to touch a vegetable. 

To be fair - hypertension runs in my dads family. They’re mostly thin. I’m also thin and my blood pressure is super low inherited from my mom. For now. I’m addicted to salt so... I’m trying to watch that.

I also had a shit diet for 10+ years before that, which my doc said contributed to it. My symptoms got better when I cut out the junk food (still on insulin though). Many junk-eaters are overweight, so I think it is absolutely safe to assume that an overweight person that fills their stomach with junk and high-sugar foods also has diabetes or insulin resistance. The chances are higher that they are sick rather than healthy."

Damianawenchbeast,fdqb27a,t1_fdpqd9e,"Interesting. I often suspected this was the case for a lot of the ""unhealthy thin people"" that FA's like to point to.

They use the excuse that BMI isn’t a good health indicator because there are athletes and bodybuilders (like The Rock) with 30+ BMIs who are healthy. But they fail to realize that these are ATHLETES and BODYBUILDERS. They bulk up with strict diets and tons of exercise. They have low body fat and high muscle content. Linebackers have a six pack underneath the chub. And the people Using the BMI in athletes excuse forget that they are couch potatoes with horrible diets and know comparing themselves to people like The Rock is a bad faith argument
newName543456,fdpxfxb,t1_fdobjij,"And even then, certain negative aspects of being high weight, like load on joints, or heart having to work harder to supply blood to all extra tissue, are independent of whether extra weight is muscle or fat.  


Completely ignoring the fact that many 30+ BMI bodybuilders are far from healthy due to PED abuse in the first place."

Some have had cancer, others in and out of the hospital for various things. Many stay alive through prescription drugs. It seems like this feed gets a lot of declarations of wanting others to let them be ""healthy"" even if science doesn't match up. It's fascinating how people are stumbling over the basic science around being physically fit. Of course some fat people are beautiful and sexy, but that doesn't change the science. We can appreciate our bodies & others for where they are right now, but that doesn't change the facts about health."

Like bro it's a doctor, so any regular patients they have are going to be at least somewhat unhealthy. Also, doctors can't differentiate healthiness. Like you don't walk in with no issues and they say ""well, you are healthy, but Patient X is healthier"". If you are healthy they aren't going to need to run tests that would signify that you are measurably more healthy than anyone else.... Finally, the doctor is not/definitely should not be divulging anything about his other patients. In the states that's a HIPAA violation if he says anything more than ""I treat athletes"".

Main issues besides morbid obesity that I have are that I have high cholesterol and I had a vitamin D deficiency (currently on supplements for that). However, while my A1C and fasting insulin levels are fine, they're perilously close into entering prediabetic territory. That's just one thing that I can see that could make my 30s a living hell. That's what ultimately pushed me into getting gastric bypass. I didn't have the co morbidities a lot of patients have like sleep apnea, diabetes, high blood pressure, etc, but I wanted to prevent them from happening if I could help it. Losing a lot of weight would help immensely and WLS seemed like a great tool in my arsenal. One month down and I'm already down about six or so BMI points.

Once or twice a week doing this won’t cause issues. A heavier night out usually comes with more calories (Especially if you start to crave junk food and lose inhibitions like me) but even with eating normally during the day I’m around 2000-2500 calories on those days; sure it shows on the scale for a few days, but if I’m at a deficit for the rest of the week I’m still losing weight. At maintenance I guess I would take a few lower cal days to balance out the night outs but my point is, you dont have to give up fun things during/after weight loss. Sure, if you feel like it’s causing issues then do it, or if you want to challenge yourself, but it’s not a must. The key as you say is moderation and accountability.

It’s probably going to take some time to undo the damage but for me, the important thing is that i can hop back to my routine after a few days. 

Also I dont have preplanned cheat days but if there is an event or I really want a burger I won’t mind going over, and I haven’t cut out anything from my diet. I’m just trying to limit those days for only a few occasions per month, and not use it as an excuse to binge on everything and anything. Otherwise, I just fit the things I want into my daily target. Maybe i would have already reached my goal weight if i was stricter- but it helps me keep my sanity, and I dont feel deprived at all.

When I lost weight intentionally I continually adjusted my caloric budget for my new TDEE as I lost weight to maintain a constant rate of loss.

That's my experience. This happened to me about 10 years ago. It's much easier to see the extra weight as a problem you need to take care of as agressively as possible, instead of considering it a symptom that will only disappear if you cut the root cause of it, by having a lifestyle change.

In the morning, I add up the calories from the meals I know I'm going to eat throughout the day and see what's left over so I know what I'm working with. It takes almost no effort and actually cuts back on how much mental energy I have to spend thinking about it at all."

I'm also the same with the mental energy -- I love planning out my day ahead of time. I know what I'm making, when I'm making it, what I need to get from the store. I'm not sitting there staring at my fridge in an indecisive panic. As I'm just maintaining my weight, I'm fine with switching things up if need be; if my ass really wants to go to a coffee shop to work and a biscotti with my coffee sounds delightful, I just plug it in and move on with life.

I understand the obsessive component because I've been there -- I've been the one taking off a piece of lettuce so the scale reads 85g of lettuce and not 86g; this was pre my anorexia diagnosis. So, for some, tracking or counting calories isn't a smart move mentally and I had to break away for a moment; but as long as you have a solid relationship with food and body image, tracking can be incredibly useful.

""diet"" should be thought of as a change in nutrition habits, not as a temporary period of self torture.

The trick is to find foods you like, that give you the right amount of the right nutrients. Thats how you get a sustainable change. Not by cutting out bread for 3 months. You can eat healthy, and still enjoy your food. I've been eating a healthy, varied diet for years now, and still am able to have pizzas, donuts and burgers. Because i got out my calculator and spreadsheet, and designed myself a nutritional plan that i like to eat, and also fits my requirements. I gave myself a daily calorie budget, with a rough 50/25/25 nutrient split. Then designed 50 meals over a couple evenings that i like (breakfasts, lunches, dinners, sacks), and just mix&match them based on my mood."

Whether you do a strict diet like keto or not, if you go back to your old habits that made you fat, you’ll get fat again. Simple.

Kodiak01,fdh910g,t1_fdgy3ei,"When I finally lost a ton of weight by learning how to eat properly, it was courtesy of a plan that I bought from, of all places, an informercial.

You can't buy it anymore, so I'm fine with saying it was Provida Six Week Body Makeover.

What possessed me to try it?   While there was a bit of the usual diet woo-woo being pushed, it did have a few solid points with sold me:

- Making my own meals.  An important part of the plan was cooking your own foods (often in bulk when necessary) so you knew exactly what was going into it.  There were no special supplements to add, just portion sizes dictated by the charts and recipe cards.

- Balanced intake.  They pushed the point hard that restricting any one of the three macros is a recipe for long term failure.

- Portion control.  You were learning not only what to eat, but how to size and eat proper portions.

- The most important point:  It's not a diet, it is a **lifestyle change**.  Although you make some adjustments when you hit maintenance, the plan is centered on learning how to eat for the rest of your life.

Depending on the woo-woo related to your body type, the fat-loss stage COULD be very restrictive.  A lot of people bought the plan and couldn't deal with that; these were a lot of the same people that weren't willing to cook the majority of their meals or learn to maximize the ingredients they could have.  Even though I was on the most restrictive variety, their now-defunct (sadly) support website had tens of thousands of recipes created by others on the plan.  For those unprepared for the **hard work and dedication** that losing fat entails, they were likely doomed to fail from the start.

Other people had the opposite problem.  Their biggest gripe was actually, ""How can I eat so much food?  This is way TOO MUCH!""  The plan was based around 5 meals a day, and a lot of people, once their bodies got used to the intake, found they couldn't even finish their portions.  Personally I was one of many who's life didn't allow for 5 meals a day, so we adjusted to 3.

As part of the plan they also gave a booklet that covered dozens of major restaurant chains from fast food to steakhouses, giving examples of what you could order on-plan from each place.  It was a surprisingly large list.

If I could find a complete copy of the plan again, I'd buy it in a heartbeat just to have.  Unfortunately, all that is to be found now online are individual books and support items hacked off of full kits."

Obsessing over the growing balance by recording the numbers in my bank account daily.  Not being able to work while on this budget.  Not being able to buy expensive drugs on this budget.

900 calories a day is not enough for an adult human, ever. 

You do not need much of a calorie deficit to achieve weight loss, especially on Keto, and especially if your body is used to consuming hundreds of excess calories of sugar every day. Sometimes just getting someone under 2,000 calories a day is enough because it’s a deficit from the 3-4k their body is used to eating. 

I didn’t count calories at all when I did Keto, just carbs. I naturally ate much smaller portions because the fat content was so satiating. I don’t do keto anymore, but i do still keep a reasonable carb/fat ratio, and I’ve been able to train my body/brain to be disgusted by sugar and to like smaller portions. Diets don’t work unless they change your long term relationship with food for the better.

WheelyCrazyCatLady,fdi4sp8,t3_elb410,"It totally depends on how quick you lost the weight.  When dieting and losing weight at a safe speed I've never gained the weight back. Partly because I don't ""diet"", i make a permanent change to my diet and don't go back to eating the old foods after the ""diet"" phase is over. 


When I starved before I got my feeding tube (not intentional,  stomach stopped working) I lost weight extremely quickly because I was literally starving and had a zero caloric intake for 70 days (I lost about 40kg in those 70 days, and I wasn't particularly overweight before it so looked really skinny in the photos they took before tube feeds were started). After that I did gain weight rapidly because I lost weight fast enough for my ""set point"" to not have dropped with my weight loss. But that is a survival thing done by the body- I was skeletal looking and needed the weight back on me in a hurry, just like most do when they've really been starving 🤷‍♀️.


People need to stop using the term ""starving"" to mean they're a tiny bit hungry.  Starving and hungry are not the same thing and the body responds slightly differently to them.  Starvation of course makes the body try and hold on to its weight to keep us alive,  shown by me only losing a few kg a week at first before all my stores were depleted and the rest dropped off practically overnight.

Specifically when doing keto I stopped recording everything I ate 6 weeks through but still monitored my weight. I wanted to make sure I was making good choices but didn't need to record everything in my life. Then I went off keto. And keep exercising. I continued to lose weight. I got down to 170. 

Then in October I got offered a new job. I took a vacation. And celebrate. And lost my company gym membership. Started drinking during the week (something I use to do a long time ago) and by December 15 I weighed 196. I was aware I was doing the wrong things and eating like crap. But it wasn't just that I stopped dieting it's I went completley off the rails. I was drinking way to much. I was eating way to much.

qweerty93,fe0e4sw,t1_fe01j5o,"Yeah I agree.

But on the other hand, if what she is writing is true (BIG IF there), then it does seem kinda crazy that as a doctor doing elective, plastic surgeries (where I assume they have a little bit more time with patients), they chose to have a really sensitive and potentially difficult conversation with a patient when she was naked and in a hospital gown. Most people would feel extra vulnerable."
undressedlunch,fe0yjk7,t1_fe0e4sw,The post says that the doctor spoke to her while she was dressed.
maybebeccadough,fe2kwr7,t1_fe0e4sw,"Honestly I wouldn't trust a plastic surgeon that treated me like that with doing the procedure. I recently had plastic surgery to address loose skin on my breasts and abdomen, and the first doctor I went to for a consultation treated me in a similar fashion to the story. Rather than explaining anything before asking me to get undressed, he had me immediately change into a gown, and then the first thing he said when I opened the gown was ""odd shaped chest"". I don't know what the hell he wanted me to say in response, but I was not happy. 

The second doctor I went to had a separate room to talk first, he explained everything to me, then I went to another room for the exam. He expressed a similar concern about my chest, which was more like he was afraid I wouldn't be happy with how they looked without augmentation, but he also didn't pressure me about it when I insisted I just wanted a lift. I went with this doctor, because I overall felt much more respected in his office. He also doesn't post pictures of before and afters online, though he does take them (on day of surgery, unlike the first doctor that took some at my consultation), which feels like another layer of respect. And they respected me for as long as I was awake on the day of the procedure, as well, keeping me informed as to what they were doing. 

So, basically, if a plastic surgeon doesn't treat you as you'd like in the consultation, definitely do not go back to them for your procedure, because that is likely how they will treat you the whole time."

They waited for everything to even out, rolled him very carefully back over, and both doctors refused to touch him. They insisted on having him sent to a bariatric facility an hour away.

They recommend losing 10-20 pounds because (a) a lot of people will go down a cup size (or more) with weight loss - resulting in them having less tissue to remove; (b) they will make you proportional to your body, so the smaller you are, the smaller they can make you.  It wasn’t fAtPhObIa.  Now, add to that a genuine concern for the smaller patient’s recovery time plus risk of complications.

SomethingIWontRegret,fe3ar52,t1_fe2myqb,"If her cup size is the same, that doesn't mean her boobs are the same size.  A 50G cup is a lot smaller volume than a 36G.  It just means she stayed proportional chest-wise."

However when I was 210lbs my boobs were undeniably HUGE. 

So, even I would agree, anyone losing significant weight would see a difference in their chest size. Even if the cup size were to remain the same your body shape is so different you could be appropriately proportional with the smaller band size."
Alystial,fe07kj1,t1_fe05ty9,"Right? Of course everyone is different,  but fat loss in breasts during weightloss is so freaking common that ""RIP boobs"" is a frequent meme on any weightloss forum. I myself have always been large chested and I dropped from a D to C after losing 60 lbs."

I did not have to buy new bras, I just close the clasps tighter now/don’t use a band extender. I realize I’m an exception.

If you know about sister sizing, 42DD is the same cup size as 40E, 38F, 36FF. Whereas 30DD is the same cup size as 32D, 34C, 36B. Obviously 36B is vastly smaller than 36FF."
Skyttlz,fe09z7l,t1_fe07kj1,going from 215 to 175 and back to 230 mine have basically stayed the same (between a D and DD depending on the make hahahaha)it's mostly my width that has changed.
distressedwithcoffee,fe0d39j,t1_fe07ks4,"Breast size is proportional to your body. It's based on the difference in inches (or centimeters) of chest compared to underbust. The actual *volume* of 34C cups is way different than, say, 38C. They are definitely different in size; it's just that they remained the same inch difference vs. your underbust. If you were to weigh them, 38C breasts would absolutely weigh more and be larger than 34Cs.

fwiw unless you're pretty flat, you're not a C cup. C means your bust is 3"" bigger than your underbust. It's pretty darn small. r/abrathatfits is definitely worth a visit.

fluffstermcmuffin,fe0czie,t1_fe0cied,"I do know all of that. My point was only that people have this idea that DD regardless of band size is excessively enormous, when at a smaller band size it is in fact totally average. This is something I would not have known 100lbs ago, and I would imagine most people who have been overweight their whole adult lives probably don't know either. It was one of many things I learned while losing the weight.

remizidae,fe66e2a,t1_fe3uwtp,You can fairly well predict whether someone has sleep apnea just by measuring their neck.
RanchBoo,fe6m3x9,t1_fe3uwtp,"Not kidding though. I’ve never been overweight my whole life. Rarely smoke or drink. But snore like crazy and apparently sometimes get sleep apnea. Wouldn’t be surprised though as my entire family snore loudly, most of whom are not overweight. My brother’s a tall skinny 12 y/o that still snores quite a bit lol.
Went to doctor for this and they straight up told me my tongue’s too big.. guess I solved the genetic curse in my family.
Not to defend OP or anything but I can’t do anything about my sleep apnea except for maybe getting a smaller tongue through surgery 💩"

My doctor said the only thing left to try was shaving uvula down, but that the recovery is so painful he doesn’t recommend it since it’s not medically necessary. He said that instead I should send my husband in to have custom-fitted earplugs made. 

Of course, my husband didn’t do it but he hasn’t mentioned my snoring since."
tomuchsugar,fe5g0v2,t1_fe54qfe,From my understanding any snoring is from an obstruction.
StillKpaidy,fe4fyxw,t1_fe48fyu,"Just like diabetes, not everyone improves with weight loss, but the overwhelming majority do. If you haven't spoken to your doctor about sleep apnea and ways to treat it, please do. If left untreated it has a much bigger health impact than most people realize."
KuriousKhemicals,fe4wqdi,t1_fe48fyu,"I worked with a doctor for a while who works on both lung disease and sleep problems so like 60% of his consults were suspected sleep apnea. He told me for obstructive sleep apnea, about 1/3 of people will see complete remission by getting down to a healthy weight, 1/3 will see some improvement but still need treatment, and 1/3 it will not make any difference or they don't have weight to lose in the first place. Then there's central sleep apnea which isn't thought to be weight related at all, but is much less common than obstructions."
babyitsgayoutside,fe5e979,t1_fe48fyu,"A celebrity I follow had surgery for a deviated septum in order to fix his sleep apnea! He had a cpap too but the guys never been overweight in his life, some are just unlucky"
WartyWartyBottom,fe5hmqg,t1_fe48fyu,"All kinds of upper airway obstruction can cause OSA. Obesity is often a major factor,  but a receding jawline, nasal blockage, enlarged tonsils, poor muscle tone etc can all be causes. 


The reason that PAP machines are so commonly prescribed as treatment is because they are essentially a therapeutic magic bullet. Rather than trying to target potential causes and treat them individually, they aim to keep the airway inflated with an appropriate amount of positive air pressure to eliminate, or minimise all of the symptoms instead."
npsimons,feabx0b,t1_fe48fyu,"> It's weird, I've been on the low end of obese but got down to a healthy BMI but my sleep apnea is still a thing. My tongue must be fat AF lol

I had a deviated septum, to the point my ENT asked if I'd ever broken my nose (I hadn't; congenital). My sleep apnea was borderline, as was my overweight status, but I got the septoplasty anyway due to a history of sinus infections and the sleep apnea.

It's hard to tell if it was the weight or the deviated septum that lead to the sleep apnea, probably 50/50, but I'll never regret losing the weight as it caused other health issues and hampered performance in my sports of choice. I also felt unattractive in my own body, which was a mood killer for sex."

Shuddering at the thought!

I sent my husband to a sleep study, because he snores and gets those catches in his breath and coughs and jerks etc during the night. Home study: no sign of sleep apnea. Spent the night in the hospital: ""You just slept peacefully and didn't even snore!"" No one's suggested shaving anything, thankfully! I just knee him in the back now until he turns around."
BowLeggedPenguin,feaaf6n,t1_fe5d9r8,"My mom had that done, she too snored like a bear with a headcold but also had sleep apnea.  She said it was incredibly painful, and if she had to do it over she wouldn't have done it.  She still snores, too.  Not as loud as she did before she had it, but it didn't fix the problem completely either."
moosenix,fe5h504,t1_fe5d9r8,"I quite enjoy your doctor. 

I have pretty significant allergies but I don't snore nightly. If my nose isn't clogged, I sleep mouth closed (fat tongue down I suppose 😂)."
moosenix,fe5gvpi,t1_fe5g0v2,"I went through a sleep study, I didn't have any incidents of not breathing. If it's just making me snore a bit, truly it wasn't even severe snoring only a half hour out of entire night... I think cutting out my tongue to shorten it & shave the sides down seems a bit extreme."
chisana_nyu,fe4g4x6,t1_fe4fyxw,"It's pretty well controlled according to the doctor.  With my CPAP I have 1 to 5 apneas per hour, which he says isn't bad.  The CPAP has definitely made my sleep better as well."

Rant on the internet about how fatphobic my docs are.  Boggles my mind we’re now at a point in society where doctors presenting medical facts triggers such extreme emotions in some folks.

-missManners-,fe4g0z3,t1_fe4et5m,"As a post up there says yes, there are cases. Obstructive Sleep Apnea is improved by CPAP and weight loss. Central Sleep Apnea is neurological, so weight loss won’t correct it."

I remember we evaluated this person with absolutely zero risk factors - female, premenopausal, healthy weight - who ended up having obstructive sleep apnea. Most patients were indeed obese but it can happen. Her case was especially unusual but it's not too surprising to see in postmenopausal women at healthy weights, as well, because estrogen helps maintain the structural strength of the throat tissues."
Imfrank123,fe7ich9,t1_fe4et5m,"So this is all anecdotal but I’m not over weight at all, 170 @6’ tall, and I have been told by pretty much all my girlfriends over the years that one, I snore and two I will just stop breathing for a long time like 30seconds to a min.

Surgery aside keeping some morbidly obese people alive under anesthesia can be a really difficult task.

Not to mention that because of the slow effect of anesthesia in fat, you need more anesthesia than normally to make up for it. Which again pushes you closer to a lethal overdose.

She said it was a shock seeing the pictures we took in Japan and realising how big she really was in comparison to all our friends there.

As my friend noticed too, it's more like the average person is healthy weight but just without the extra flabby rolls we're used to seeing on people back home (stuff like back fat poking over bras, muffin tops, bingo wings etc - all of which I have despite being healthy bmi). When we eventually got back home, it was a big shock to see how much bigger the average sized British person is, and my friend (who lost a fair amount of weight in Japan) is now starting to resent the subtle, though well-meant, encouragement she's been getting to stay as big as she is.

A lot of things became surprisingly easier for me, especially compared to how I was at my highest weight (like I don't get thigh chafing anymore and honestly the first time I climbed up the tube escalator stairs after weightloss, I felt like I was flying) but it did bring unexpected problems too.

Like, I wasn't used to my new body and would throw myself around like I was still big. Badly bruised my coccyx once from hurling myself onto a chair as I didn't realise I had lost adipose padding that was my giant arse. It also became really obvious how being overweight had ruined my posture - nerd neck, tilted back, awkward gait. As I didn't initially try to sort it out, I ended up with some ongoing issues. Losing that last bit of excess weight did make exercise soooo much easier, especially when it came to exercising the muscles needed to fix my posture.

From a purely mechanical point of view, I'm sure losing the extra weight will lessen the load bear and thus the friction too but I do also recommend checking if there are other things that can help with that as well.

For example, my friend was very big when she went to have her knee pain examined and they found that her kneecaps were not in the right place, causing her to walk on the ball of her foot and so bringing on a whole host of other joint issues as well. They said that the misalignment shouldn't have been an issue if she was healthy weight (unless she fell hard on her knees or something).

I don't only know fat people. I know lots of people. Some fat, some not.

 I actively participate and compete in BJJ. I play weekly 2 hours floor hockey games, often with limited subs and only a few 5 minute water breaks. I'm not the fastest player, but I'm middle of the pack despite being by far the largest. I play tennis most weeks against moderately skilled opponents (3.5-4.5 ntrp rating) and rely on movement and endurance to win as my skill level is low. At least three times a week I work the heavybag for 6 or more 3 minute rounds with sprints or jumprope between rounds. At least once a week I do 12 rounds.

It's just that it is possible to be fat at a fairly high level of athleticism. And in the modern world many skinny people are extraordinarily unathletic. Being fat and being active isn't an oxymoron. 

It's being big in general. When I was big from powerlifting, I was still incredibly quick. Could run a 5:17 mile despite my size. I could sprint a 4.7 40.  But no one believed me until they saw. Even then people didn't believe me. They'd deny what they just saw. 

I did a 5k mud run/obstacle race with a taller ""leaner"" buddy who was utterly unathletic. Everyone assumed he was going to blow me away just because I was so thick. Even people who had seen me run believed this. I ended up finishing 4th in my wave running a 30 something. He finished in like 70 minutes..... People didn't believe me.

I've had many caliper measurements done as a guideline, but also have done water displacement when I need a very accurate test. So for me BMI isn't what I'm looking at. For most people BMI is useful. For those involved in strength based sports it is virtually useless in comparison to bodyfat %. I don't need BMI to tell me I'm currently obese, nor was it accurate when I was leaner. 

And yeah a 5'5 300 lb person without significant extra muscle is asking for trouble, no doubt. But not everyone who is 300+ fits in that category. And yeah, I do know it's never ideal to weigh that much, even if there's a lot of muscle mass."
huckster235,fdhq5r7,t1_fdhopv4,"Didn't say it was healthy. 

That's the problem with most fat/fit advocates and with skinny people that don't exercise. 

Exercise related health is different from weight related health. Pro football lineman are infinitely more athletic than the average person. They generally cut from like 350 down to 225 once their careers are over. They cut because they are unhealthy at that weight, but they are still athletic.

In order to be healthy you have to commit to doing exercise AND proper diet/weight. The two are interconnected, but not one in the same."

huckster235,fdhu69b,t1_fdhty30,I really don't know what point you are making.

I have an eating disorder so I swing from binge eating to not eating and back again. It’s brought on by childhood stuff which has made me hate myself.

However, dieting plunges me into the restrictive part of my eating disorder, which is bad for me because, again, I’m diabetic and if I don’t eat my blood sugar drops. Plus when I’m in this restrictive mindset I stop taking my medication in fear that tablets have calories.

So I find that I support body positivity, as in loving yourself, as a way in which to want to take better care of myself. And part of that is losing weight. 

For me it’s not just as simple as cutting calories because my mental health adds complex issues. I know I’m not the only one too.

I’ve even spoken to doctors about this but because I’m not underweight or making myself throw up I don’t fit the criteria to get help.

If there are no calories listed on something, look up the food on MyFitnessPal and make an educated guess. And don’t forget to track even the small bits of calories here and there.

Definitely. It's great if it works for you, and it sounds like you're doing it properly. I think it's easier to do a poor job and fool yourself without a food scale, though. I've used one for so long (not even just when I've been losing weight) that it's second nature, and I get a bit itchy inside from the vagueness of guesswork I need to sometimes do estimating. The scales just sit on the kitchen counter. I but a plate or bowl on it, zero it, pop in the food, and get the weight - so it's not exactly hard work."

This sounds just like the people when they are in the intro before filming starts.

Mikkito,fdj6epq,t1_fdiaj0e,"Came to comment on just this. Interesting show.

I have a friend that was a dancer. Gained about 30 pounds, but she was super thin before so she definitely showed it.

Spent a year posting about her weight gain and how the doctors couldn't find anything wrong with her but she knew something was wrong and it was doing this horrible weight gain to her because she was barely eating anything. I kept saying, ""it doesn't matter if you've got a medical condition, just eat less than you burn and it will come off. Log your intake accurately."" (more tactfully, of course)

Shocking to none, she lost the weight through WW and became an advocate for actually logging what you eat. 😅"

Everyone --- even dietitians --- tends to [under-report their caloric intake](https://weightology.net/do-dietitians-accurately-report-their-food-intake/).  When I had to carefully log my food for a few months for an issue that wasn't weight-related, even I found that my eyeball estimates of volume would often be a bit on the low side --- and I wasn't even overweight or looking to pad my plate (I was just neutrally recording what I normally ate).  The vast majority of us do this, it's just that it doesn't become a crucial cognitive error until a weight problem comes into the picture."

ingenandre,fdidzt9,t3_elj0ps,> This week on Secret Eaters...
bobtheorangecat,fdi9b3b,t3_elj0ps,I have my doubts about whether most of the people who seem to report this problem even own a food scale.
space_pdf,fditjw2,t3_elj0ps,"when i track calories i actually try to do my best to round up or choose the slightly higher calorie option (i use myfitnesspal and they have a lot of preloaded nutrition information). its easy to trick myself into thinking ive only had 1300 calories if i ignore the extra splash of creamer i used in my coffee or the half order of french fries i finished for my friend during lunch. ive been doing my best to eat under 1700 calories for the last month and i've been eating 1450\~. i'm down a pound at around 146lbs :)   


my best guess is they're drinking their calories and dont realize it. those iced coffees and canned sodas are a son of a bitch"
Queso_and_Molasses,fdj8dq1,t1_fditjw2,Sweet coffees can add up quick. I love Starbucks and their lattes and mochas (especially the fall/winter ones) so I have to be extra careful and plan so that I can get my white chocolate or peppermint mocha fix. It used to be much easier because there was a skinny peppermint mocha option but they got rid of it. :(
LooseDetective,fdjuj5x,t1_fditjw2,"Also double check on MFP and LoseIt because most entries are just wrong and nutritional values vary from country to country (ex. Kraft cream cheese is verified on the app for ~340kcal, where I live it's more like 260 cal per 100g). I started double checking everything on Loseit and found out that I've been tracking a ton of stuff wrong. Of course most were little differences so it's not a huge deal, but maybe in the long run they can be annoying"
ceramicthumb,fdi7swn,t3_elj0ps,"Could also be impatience. “I’ve been tracking for a whole day and I haven’t lost any weight!” No, honey, it takes time. You can’t expect to see any meaningful progress until about a month of consistent tracking with no cheat days (or up to one planned and controlled “cheat” day a week)."
synalgo_12,fdj9jmk,t1_fdi7swn,"In all fairness, if she's 250lbs and really eating 1200 kcal, you'd notice the water weight drop and then fat loss pretty quickly. If you're working with a 200kcal deficit, it def takes time."
lilythebreadwinner,fdj88iu,t1_fdi7swn,"She’s allegedly been doing this for months. 

I think she’s just bad at tracking. Which, I get that it takes used to doing religiously. But she’s gotta be diligent about it."
Greeknerd35,fdjc86t,t1_fdj9jmk,"I’m a good 75 lbs smaller than her and when I go to a 1,200 cal/day plan I lose 2-3 lbs a week. She’s either lying or not tracking correctly."
ceramicthumb,fdjagkj,t1_fdj9jmk,That’s a good point.
ceramicthumb,fdj8wdl,t1_fdj88iu,Mmm yeah that’s just inaccurate tracking.
lexxitron3000,fdiw6q6,t3_elj0ps,"One of the best pieces of advice I saw in r/loseit was to not attempt to ""fudge the numbers"" to fit what you ate into your calorie counter app. Be honest. Because no matter what you do, your body cannot lie and will digest whatever it is you ate. So it's better to just be honest with yourself, even if that means you're in the red that day.

After I read that I started measuring out everything I eat. I know myself, and I know that even if I ""think"" I *only* had a half cup of this food, I most certainly am undershooting it. But measuring cups don't lie, and so that's just what I have to do!

Edit: I don't own a food scale, so if I do have to eyeball something then I just add some olive oil to my calorie counter to keep myself in check. Started doing this recently, and it seems to be working so far."
SituationTypeDeal,fdie8i2,t3_elj0ps,Have you tried being honest with yourself?
darkchocolatebreath,fdjk7zd,t3_elj0ps,Do people know how difficult it is to eat 600kcal a day without going insane?
bitsapart,fdj7cq6,t3_elj0ps,“exercise doesn’t seem to help” were you exercising consistently and actually training hard or did you work out once and then go get food afterwards cause you “earned it” ?

&#x200B;

A second guy I knows who has indeed lost weight and claimed he ate a certain amount a day but yet he had no idea how many calories were in the Popeyes chicken sandwich we were eating. He guessed 500. He was wrong. it is more like 699!!"
tpfang56,fdi9tdi,t3_elj0ps,You probably have to be 4 1/2 feet for 1200 to even be *maintenance*.

Ava_Strange,fdjscya,t1_fdjmfyd,Then I misunderstood you. You wrote it as if it was general statement about 1200 being too much for maintenance.
Queso_and_Molasses,fdj7njr,t3_elj0ps,She drinks the rest of the calories.
WheelyCrazyCatLady,fdjhqpx,t3_elj0ps,"It's highly likely they're not tracking how many calories they drink,  and drinking very high calorie drinks.

Robot_Penguins,fdm5iwu,t3_elj0ps,"I know where this is from and lying to oneself is common in this instance so that's probably the case. They're underestimating the servings and/or not counting oil, butter, handfuls of chips etc..

bowlineonabight,fdqve2y,t1_fdqu0a5,My three kids never had difficulty in telling the difference between love and cookies. Because I never made cookies a replacement for interacting with them.
KuriousKhemicals,fdrgo4d,t1_fdqu0a5,"Exactly - normally children should be hearing ""no"" much of the time and ""yes"" occasionally when it comes to cookies. After the weight conversation, there should not suddenly be a rule that plump kiddo isn't allowed to have cookies, either. They should just hear more no's and fewer yeses. If the number of no's was previously zero, you can perfectly accurately explain that you weren't looking out for the family's health well enough before and now you are going to. Then walk the damn talk for your kid, hopefully that doesn't need to be said."

unnhhhhh,fdr5jmd,t3_emta6s,"I remember when I was in like grade 3 there was a kid in my class who's mom brought him fast food literally everyday.   I complained to my mom how unfair it was that he gets all this amazing food while I got PB&J, carrots and water. she said it was because she must care about me more than his mom does.

Obviously when I was 8 I didn't get it but now I'm so grateful she actually restricted my junk food intake than take the easy road and throw me fried chicken everyday"
UltraFab,fdqykpe,t3_emta6s,"Well duh, if If you a child they can't have a cookie and offer no explanation then of course they will be confused. If you tell them *why* then it becomes a non issue. There could be a multitude of reasons - dinner is being served soon, they've already had some cookies that day, too much can rot your teeth, they have allergies/intolerances to milk or gluten... Sweet stuff can be a treat, but so is you know, spending time with the kid or doing a cool activity together."
Jjkkllzz,fdqypow,t3_emta6s,"I always wondered where obese children are getting all this food. Well, I mean obviously from their parents, but once the parents realize the children shouldn’t be eating those things why are they in the house. I get my kids treats from time to time, but they don’t have tantrums over cookies because the cookies aren’t there. I don’t keep them in the house, so they don’t ask for them. If the parents eat healthy, so will the children. If all you have for snacks in the house is apples, they’ll eat apples. If you give one kid a cookie of course the other kid is going to be mad about having to eat grapes. Kids don’t have the best self control, so it’s all about what they have access to. I’ve seen so many examples on TV where the parents are yelling at the kids for being fat but keep junk in the house that they are allowed to eat but not the kid which ends up with the kid sneaking food. It shouldn’t be about the kid being fat and needing to be on a diet. It should be about the whole family knowing the importance of having healthy meals b"

SuperDiogenes64,fdqy00b,t3_emta6s,"Yep. Unhealthy food was how my dad used to show us love. He also used to suggest that I drink less water and more soda, claiming that the dietary research about both was overblown. C'est la vie."

TrufflesTheMushroom,fdqygsy,t3_emta6s,"I could see this happening in a situation where the fat kid in the family gets only one cookie, while the skinny kid and the parents each get two or three. Nobody likes being singled out for different treatment, but especially not kids. 

And I can understand how a kid who believes they're being treated unfairly compared to the other kids in the household will take the first chance they get to eat what they believe is their ""fair share"" of cookies as an opportunity to assert their autonomy and make sure justice is served.

Source: I was that kid. My food was constantly being monitored and restricted because I was obese. Rather than making healthy changes as a family, I got singled out for diets, made to feel bad about my weight, and yes, would stuff my face whenever I could because it was a way to give my parents the middle finger."
bristly_hedgehog,fds4nnb,t1_fdqygsy,"Yeah, the amount of people shutting this down is kind of surprising—it’s not even about being fat or letting your kid have all the junk they want, it’s about how disordered views of eating and the way parents react to them hurts kids and sets them up for failure. 

I was also that kid. First, we were poor before my mom married my stepdad, so when little toddler me got her hands on treats, they were devoured immediately. My grandparents used food as a reward, so yeah, I came to associate it with good feelings and love and affirmation. Then, later in my childhood, I noticed I was being treated differently than my siblings. My mom signed me up for a women’s gym and raged at me when I sat in the bathroom when I had my period and felt sick. She bought desserts and hid them, so I sought them out. Only I was made to go on walks around the neighborhood after dinner, only I had to go to the gym and got screamed at when I didn’t feel like it, only I got treated differently. And then to add insult to injury my mom would get pissed at me if I ever hinted that I didn’t like my body or thought I was chubby. What the hell was I supposed to think? If they had helped me learn moderation (instead of eating everything you find before it goes away), and made activity fun instead of something I resented and made me feel miserable, I would’ve been set up better. I’ve lost 50+ lbs on my own now, but I can tell I’m going to battle disordered overeating for the rest of my life if I’m not careful."
yeetmymeat91,fdt74j0,t1_fdqygsy,"Thank you. This is the comment I was looking for. I did shit like this as a kid too. That’s why kids learn to sneak food and feel ashamed about eating, that’s what I did. And it ruined my relationship with food. I think the whole “cookie is love and stability” whatever is bullshit, but being singled out about your food/weight as a child really can fuck you up."
TrufflesTheMushroom,fdsfn1e,t1_fds4nnb,"""Eat everything you find before it goes away"" pretty aptly describes my mindset as a kid. I think a scarcity mindset, whether real (due to poverty) or imposed on you, contributes hugely to disordered views around food."
TrufflesTheMushroom,fdvvxxy,t1_fdt74j0,"If cookies are a ""prized resource"" food for a family (and by that I mean a food that is singled out as special in some way), then I can also see how that food could come to represent love and stability.

Humans are inherently social primates. We are interdependent creatures, to the point that an adult in a traditional society who gets ostracized from their community will probably not survive for long on their own. A human being who is truly on their own is exquisitely vulnerable. ""Modern"" adults may have forgotten this, because Western society allows us never to leave the house if we don't want to. 

But kids? Kids are inherently vulnerable humans, and *they know it*. They know, deep down, that if they cease to be under the protection of the adults in their lives, they will be at the mercy of any human predators out there. This is one of the reasons why kids are so sensitive to any form of unfairness or the sense of being negatively singled out - it indicates that the adults on whom they depend are willing to treat them poorly compared to others in their family.

If a cookie is a prized resource in one's family, and a child perceives that they're being denied their ""fair share"" of that resource, then yes, that cookie *does* represent love and stability. From an evolutionary perspective, being treated as unworthy of that cookie when the others in the family are not must be a deeply unsettling experience, because it indicates that in some way, they don't quite belong."

I think a better approach as a parent would not be a full on cookie embargo, as this person suggests would happen, but just to moderate intake at appropriate times.  For example, they don't get any cookies if they left a full plate of more nutritious food behind.   My mom had kids in her daycare try to pull that all the time."

Allronix1,fdqnqcm,t1_fdqm9go,"First off, it's sister instead of brother. It's pretty funny how often people think I'm a dude. 

Well, I have always been smaller. About a half inch shorter and anywhere from 30 to 100 pounds lighter. So there may be a small epigenetic effect somewhere. She has a few allergies and sensitivities I don't and vice versa. She can't eat eggs or soy, which are almost food groups for me. And I have issues with loud noises and bright lights that she can handle with no trouble. 

But nah. I work as a repair person for a county health clinic and am racing about all day from one end of the building to the other and walking on my lunch break so that I don't get stopped for ""oh this little thing..."" (which would happen if I stayed in the building) Plus public transit for a commute. And my doctor's orders to exercise daily (at least an hour at the gym). 

Not sure how active my sister is or what her diet consists of. But she does have a car commute. She works as a special ed teacher, and I don't think she hits the gym anymore. 

I'm sure we would make some researchers very amused, though."
Allronix1,fdqns8u,t1_fdqnpoe,🏅 Okay. That's pretty funny.
Leptep,fdqro9n,t1_fdqnqcm,You're a dude. Girls don't exist on the internet.
Count_Your_Macros,fdrbpte,t1_fdqnqcm,"Whoops my bad, apologies. Has your sister ever tried to blame her weight on genetics would be pretty funny if she did for you to just say ""Uh.. hello"" as you gesture to yourself.

I know there's a big genetic component to allergies, I didn't realise identical twins could have different allergies that's interesting. You definitely sound like you got lucky in that regard anyway!"

We also have [lipedema](https://www.webmd.com/women/qa/what-is-lipedema), a common but not well understood disorder where fat in our legs doesn't burn normally. She's under the impression that I am over exercising and under eating, in denial about having disordered fat and that my doctor is behind the curve. I should accept my extra weight and not exercise as much or as strenuously...you know, the whole ""gentle, joyful movement."" 

It pisses me off because I am hard at work complying with my doctor's orders.  Yes, I have it. I also have a much milder case. I also see her having trouble walking long distances and know she's having some of the side effects I don't. I am angry that she is in denial about her weight and how it's hurting her while she has the nerve to try and lecture me about how I am trying to control mine.

But can't do anything about it. Can only control myself.  So off to the gym I go to work out the frustration."

I don't like that my dad dropped dead at age 61 and spent the last five years of his life bedridden. (And that he never got to meet my husband or see his eldest child marry...yeah, I married last)

redlamps67,fdqs84d,t3_emqf8o,"My brother is a “big eater who is naturally slim”. I never understood how he could eat so much more than me and stay thin. Then I learned about TDEE and took into account his size. He’s 6’6” tall. He has always been very tall, he passed me in height when he was 12. 

His TDEE at sedentary is 2,378 calories. 

My TDEE at sedentary is 1,597 calories. 

Even selecting “heavy exercise” on the TDEE calculator (which is working out 6-7 times a week) my TDEE only gets to 2,295. If I change his activity level to “lightly active” his TDEE changes to 2,725 while mine *maxes out* at 2,595 if I choose “athlete” activity levels. 

Now I know why he can eat so much more than I can. His body needs way more. For as much as FAs go on and on about “natural body diversity” they really turn a blind eye to how body diversity is the reason we can’t all eat the same amount and why we have to keep to our individual calorie limits to stay a healthy weight."

Turns out that it was because they did train multiple hours of football everyday. That shit. She's a real difference."
grautry,fdqa3qn,t3_emqf8o,"If by ""big eaters who are naturally slim"" we mean ""people who walk a couple hours every day or do an equivalent in other forms of movement or exercise"", then sure.

stevieisbored,fdqno2k,t3_emqf8o,"Losing weight and being slim isn't a virtue-signal, although I know some people have that mindset (and I'm not talking about FA people, I'm talking about people who legitimately fat-shame). I feel like when people get like this, they're on the defensive. Someone treated them badly because of their size and the only defense mechanism they have is this. The message of HAES is comforting to them. I can kinda see how easy it is to get sucked into this mindset. I personally used to bring up my perfect blood work to defend my weight because I felt ashamed of myself. 

Accepting that I made myself this big and that only I can undo the damage to my body has actually been more empowering to me than any HAES-type logic. Because I DO have a choice. I CAN change my body by changing my habits, because I've already lost a pretty decent chunk through CICO."

KittenTheStripper,fdrnoqj,t3_emqf8o,"So, according to this FA, 

being lucky = being thin

*Hmmmmm*
Sounds like someone is letting their true feelings slip out. What happened to being fat being the best thing ever?

Also, they always go on and on abput how people shouldn't assume that fat people are lazy, or they eat too much or exercise too little.. but when they look at thin people they can assume the thin person was just 'born that way,' and 'lucky' instead of acknowledging that they work hard to be thin. 
A bit hypocritical if you ask me."

Aye, George III's revenge on those irascible and ungrateful colonies was laid out centuries earlier when he personally visited the Hag of Chestershire to ensure that King Nixon --- who a doomsaying dream had revealed to His Royal Majesty --- would adopt the policies that would cozen farmers to multiply the fat of the land by coaxing ever more corn from the ground. George III could not foresee how this would be a curse rather than a blessing, but he trusted in his powers of prognostication and paid the Hag of Chestershire handsomely to instruct her descendants to lay this curse on the impudent British colonies two centuries later --- a charge which she executed faithfully.

If some of them had any grasp of real starvation or exclusion from society id hope they would be more concerned with providing food for the homeless and elderly who can’t provide for themselves and have no one else to care for them instead of trying to demonize self improvement and discipline.

Demanding I change my art is incredibly entitled and *rude* af, unless you're re actually *paying* for a commission. And even then, there's a limit on what demands you can make.

If you want more fat positive art, draw it yourself. Maybe these people would understand how much work is put into art if they did.

BTW, it's not like fat, chubby or curvy bodies are unusual in art. I mean, when I was in art school the vast majority of the nude models we drew were overweight or obese! (I definitely appreciated getting to draw a variety of body shapes and sizes, but I wish we would have gotten a more muscular and fit model at least once. That would have been great for studying the anatomy of the muscles!) And those models were the most popular ones because of that. They would probably still fall into the smallfat category according to most FA's, though."

GozerDestructor,fdknuxs,t3_elvq0i,"I think there may be a bit of CYA (cover-your-ass) in place here.  

Gastric bypass/sleeve surgery is usually done by bariatric specialists (like Dr. Now on the TV). An ordinary surgeon, seeing a morbidly obese patient, would prefer that person not die on his table (because his insurance rates go up), so by saying ""lose the weight first"" he or she is making it somebody else's problem - the bariatric specialist, who probably has insurance rates that already reflect his high-risk clientele."
treesandhappyshit,fdl2i1h,t1_fdknuxs,Exactly. Doctors are trained to operate within best practice where the benefits outweigh risks.

aliceiw82,fdlex0k,t1_fdl4xg1,"Yup, both my father and sister went through it and both had to go onto a restrictive diet for a few months then soup, then liquids only for about a week. Then back the other way. Part of the reason is so that after the surgery you don’t do yourself a damage attempting to eat too much. Even so they both went through a period of throwing up regularly because their stomachs were so small."
R3cognizer,fdl2khh,t3_elvq0i,"As a trans man myself, I understand exactly how it feels to desperately need top surgery, but I don't understand why it's so hard for some people to understand that even doctors who support trans people are not going to just blindly sign off on every medication and surgery that a trans person feels they need to be themself. The newer medical paradigm that is becoming more accepted amongst medical professionals is called ""informed consent"", but some people just don't seem to understand what it actually means to be ""informed"" about your health.

In order for you and your doctor to remain properly and adequately informed about all various different aspects of your health and health risks, a lot of testing needs to be done, and your doctor needs to feel they have full control over your health and all the different medications you're taking. That means no illegal drugs, any medical conditions you currently suffer are expected to be well-controlled, you must be willing to take your medication as prescribed, and you must be willing to give up any DIY medication.

And whether they like to admit it or not, extreme morbid obesity is a very serious medical condition with the potential for some very serious health consequences. As much as I sympathize with the dysphoria, because I know exactly what it feels like, the risks to such a patient are so serious that no surgeon in their right mind is going to feel it's acceptable to put a super morbidly obese patient under general anesthetic unless it is for an even more serious medical condition that they will die from in short order. That's why weight loss surgery is sometimes considered a justified risk -- because someone that morbidly obese may not live long if they don't lose weight."
caelio,fdlkchr,t1_fdl2khh,"True. And that’s to say nothing of the wildly unpredictable outcome for preforming top surgery on someone who is morbidly obese. A flat chest at that size is not something that happens for either gender, and the fat and skin issues would (I imagine) be hella complicated for a surgeon to manage - it’s already pretty specialized and there is a pretty big range of success for everyone below morbidly obese."

R3cognizer,fdlmf6c,t1_fdlkchr,"I definitely agree. As you said, morbidly obese men actually tend to have a significant amount of breast tissue development due to gynechomastia as a result of the massive amounts of excess estrogen produced by extreme levels of excess body fat. So even if he managed to get what most trans men would usually consider a close to ideal result (that being a relatively flat chest), suddenly not having that tissue anymore would actually be a less than ideal result exactly because it would be so unusual for an extremely overweight man."

IndividualJ,fdlam4p,t3_elvq0i,"Honestly if you're at the point where you need gall bladder surgery, I dont see how you wouldn't be losing weight anyway. I lost about 40 pounds in the year leading up to getting my gallbladder removed. This was because eating too much fat in a day would result in a very painful gallbladder attack. When I was scheduled for surgery I had a BMI of about 32 or so, and there were no issues with getting the surgery. They aren't going to deny you the surgery unless you're extremly obese."
StillKpaidy,fdly1t8,t1_fdlam4p,"They also won't deny you the surgery if your gallbladder is completely obstructed (versus intermittently like with your gallbladder attacks) or if it's infected. Similarly, if you have a hernia and are very morbidly obese they won't let you have an elective surgery to repair it, but if you have a loop of strangulated bowel in it they're going to to fix it. Elective versus emergent surgeries are treated differently. They also won't let you have elective surgery with a fever."
IFeelMoiGerbil,fdn1sxf,t1_fdlam4p,"I had my gallbladder scheduled for removal at a BMI of 17. I was anorexic and also struggling to keep food in due to the gallbladder issues.

I was asked to try to gain weight before the surgery because there was a increased risk due to my low body fat and BMI that the surgeon felt uncomfortable with.

In the end I had my gallbladder rupture and had emergency surgery so my BMI was less a risk than dying of sepsis. 

I did however take notably longer to recover from the surgery than average and was in hospital for 10 days with keyhole which all the HCP I saw felt was exacerbated by my low BMI. They would all have preferred to increase my weight and have a better nourished patient before operating as it would have given me more ability to cope.

This is why the BMI scale has gradiations and the risk varies depending where you fall on them. It’s not an evil plot. It’s risk awareness."
fluffstermcmuffin,fdmczrz,t1_fdly1t8,"They'll deny you laparoscopic surgery and require you to get the old school variety where they need to open up your whole midsection to do the gallbladder removal. If that's not a consequence of being morbidly obese I don't know what is! 

You do have to be significantly overweight for that to occur though. I had my gallbladder removed with a BMI of like 39 and no one said a word about my weight being an issue. I know someone who was quite a bit heavier than I was and they were told old school was the only option due to their size."

They won't do other surgeries because (despite the poster saying so) they aren't life threatening like the obesity is. The only way you will die from not getting top surgery is if you commit suicide. Threatening suicide if you don't get surgery will get you a one way trip to a psych ward."
stairphobe,fdlqlzo,t3_elvq0i,"It’s interesting that they specified top surgery. In my experience you have to be seriously overweight to not be able to find a surgeon who will operate on you. Basically all top surgeons will operate on people up to a BMI of 30 and most will operate on people who are several BMI points past that. Top surgery is lifesaving in the sense that people can and will commit suicide without it, but not having it isn’t technically deadly. And since they’re so worried about having more than one surgery, obese people who have top surgery are way more likely to need revisions than normal and overweight BMI people are. When you’re seeking a technically optional surgery (as a post op trans man I know it’s very important and not optional, but being pre op isn’t a life threatening disease so top surgery is technically considered optional) from a plastic surgeon, they can have rules about that."

grendus,fdtuh9t,t3_elvq0i,"Ignorance of the subject matter here.

Top surgery is pretty traumatic. Lots of material being added or removed to the body, lots of healing. Which is doubly bad when you're obese due to the reduced bloodflow through fatty tissue, there's a massively increased risk of necrosis and/or infection. Not to mention, should you lose or gain weight after the surgery you have no idea how it's going to develop since so much tissue has been added or removed. Genetics follows patterns, but if surgery has changed the pattern the body's pattern may become... really weird.

Gastric bypass is done as a laproscopic surgery these days, which means they cut a very small hole, stick a tube inside, and do all the work through there. They literally have patients up and moving within hours of the surgery as part of physical therapy. It's traumatic to be sure, but orders of magnitude less so than trying to surgically reconfigure a body into the opposite physical sex (apologies if I got the terms mixed up, sex is physical gender is mental yeah?)."

“Why are we celebrating [Lizzo’s] body? Why does it matter? That’s what I’m saying, like why aren’t we celebrating her music?” 

Lizzo’s diet & lifestyle are personal choices although obviously unhealthy and she’s a singer, so it’s her singing ability that should be the focus. I think it’s great that Michaels pointed that out and if it weren’t for the whole body positively element I think people would be backing her on that point."
Elizapornberry,fdqa7fv,t1_fdq0it2,"Exactly! Michaels is trumpeting the same message “value people beyond their physical appearance” isn’t that what HAES says? To value ALL BODIES.

Jumping a couple times every few minutes and just kind of stepping around and spinning is not that physically demanding.  She barely moves!

Unless Lizzo is calling for everyone to gain weight and be obese too, or promoting the message that being fat isn't unhealthy, I don't get why people keep commenting on her body. Whether a celebrity is underweight or overweight, that's the business of their doctors and loved ones, not random strangers on the internet."

It's reflexively distracting to me because my brain keeps registering it as someone about to hurt herself and keeps drawing my attention back to it for the exact opposite reason Ragen intends. Yet she uses it for every profile picture.

Someone did a blog to sort out the real things from the fake things, it's called dances with facts."

There's a thathappened element to many of her medical maltreatment stories in the sense that she always has the sassy comebacks and the doctor subordinates his expert knowledge and experience to her sassy demands.  Because, sassy.  While I do believe that there are garbage health professionals in the United States, her stories are typical self-aggrandizing Ragen stories.

Some people drive vans with ramps and they remove the driver’s seat and drive from their chairs.

Then he presses a button, and the mini crane in his pickup slowly comes to his side, and he grabs the rope attached to it and clips the wheelchair to the crane. Then the mini crane lifts it up high enough to get over vehicle, and places it in the back with the clip still attached. Then he just goes to the driver seat and puts the other seat away, and he’s off.

Because it looks like a work van, people don't hesitate to park close to the door. I've had to occasionally just wait until they come back and move, or crawl in through the back which is painful and exhausting.

If I park in two spaces to give myself room on the drivers side, some asshole will intentionally park 6"" from my driver door just to make a point about me taking up two spaces.

I park far out in the parking lot? Well thats where all the people with the motorhomes, u-hauls, horse trailers etc want to park too, right alongside the van. Fuck me.

Your desire to binge on globally mass produced food products is directly impacting the quality of life of people living in third world countries- that is classism at work, not this American mindset that ""I only have two food choices- McDonald's if I'm poor, salmon and salad if I'm rich"". It's so fucking easy to cook beans and rice or a meal in 30 minutes and yet Americans insist that they don't have time or 'money' to eat well. It literally costs you nothing to eat a little bit less than the day before. In fact it is MUCH CHEAPER to lose weight than it is to maintain a high weight- literally the only thing you have to do is buy less food.

The sheer arrogance of fat Americans claiming that they are oppressed for overeating the products that are made by oppressive corporations that dominate the third world and keep those countries in debt and underdeveloped is so fucking ridiculous (the $60B chocolate industry is infamous for relying on child slave labor in areas of West Africa). To the point where people working for the companies that make the products you binge on are so underpaid that they can't afford food, they can't afford to buy enough food to gain weight, they can't feed their kids, and yet, HAES followers will think these people are more privileged than them because they are 'thin' (oftentimes malnourished without any choice!!!). You made the choice to overeat, these people did not have any choice.
Your insistence that you can't lose weight is racist. Your lifestyle of binging and overeating is classist. The HAES movement is far more classist, sexist, and racist than the truth is."

FussyZeus,fdnqrnq,t1_fdnamc8,"I mean, by and large especially concerning weight loss, it kind of is. The body is a vast complex collection of systems, not terribly unlike a car. Your brain, as the driver, decides a lot about what the car **does:** where it goes, at what speed, etc. but just as much if not more happens without your knowledge. The fuel air mixture is tweaked regularly to give you optimum fuel economy. Some cars adjust their suspensions to provide a better ride. Some monitor the environment inside and auto-adjust it. Some change where the power output the engine goes for optimum traction, or speed, etc.

In my mind this is not unlike a body when you're trying to lose weight: a body \*can\* burn fat at any time, but it only \*chooses to\* under certain conditions, i.e. lower caloric intake, regular exercise. Certain things like intermittent fasting or high intensity training also can trigger it. However, you can't \*think\* your way to burning fat no matter how hard you try; it's just not something your brain has control over.

It's just important to remember that your body has changed very little over the millennia of human history; it still wants to eat as though you're a hunter gatherer preparing for food to not be available for a few days.

As an example, this is why salt is so delicious and makes you hungrier; salty foods are very rare in nature, but your body needs sodium. Therefore on the rare occasion you taste something salty, your body says to you ""Oh hell yeah, eat like ALL OF THIS you can find"" and it's your job as the brain to say ""no dude, calm down, we can have this anytime and too much will cause heart disease."""

""I need to lose/maintain my weight, because I can't afford to replace my wardrobe"" makes no judgements on worth, since that seems to be a Big Thing to FAs; it makes no judgement about other people's bodies, or their health; it doesn't suggest that other people need to follow your example — it doesn't say anything about all the specious reasons FAs come up with to make weight loss a cultural betrayal of other fat people."

That was actually one of the factors that decided me on losing the weight that had snuck up on me when I quit payimg attention to it.  Too cheap to buy new pants when my jeans wore out when I had non-worn-out jeans that would fit if I lost some weight. I don't mind buying clothes when they wear out, but it's almost painful to spend money to replace what I just got too fat to wear.  I lost the weight and got ""new"" clothes right out of my closet.

I mean, ideally you'd go for frozen veggies, beans and rice, and some of the other things we're always recommending in this sub - cook in bulk and eat at home more, for example. Get black coffee or regular coffee with half & half instead of a big fancy caramel macchiato or whatever hot milkshake you get every day.

Anyway, every time someone says this I have to assume they'd never moseyed through the produce section."

Like, the biggest avocados I've ever seen. You could cut it into fourths and eat it with your meals.

My mom recently gave me a cooking lesson for her legendary chicken noodle soup. It takes like two hours to make, but most of the time is just waiting for it to cook. But it literally gives you about 20 servings of soup and the cost of it is a raw chicken, some cheap veggies, extra broth, rice noodles, and a few seasonings.

For strength, depends how 'baby' you mean. Squats and split squats don't involve stepping so won't disturb the neighbours. Bodyweight to start, then holding things (or with a backpack on) to add resistance. 

Pressups (on your knees, hands on a step/arm rest, or even standind with your palms against the wall depending on your current strength). 

Bicep curls with a tin of beans/bottle of wine/whatever in your hand

Sit ups or crunches

Shoulder presses (again holding a tin, bottle, whatever for a bit of resistance)

There's quite a bit along these lines you can do without risking 'stomping', and without needing to spend any money at least to start out. Later on it might be worth buying a couple of resistance bands  (cheap, light,  easy to store) to up the level."

Getting fresh veggies took me forever so I started spacing out my trips by buying more frozen food.

There was a Dollar General near my house and I'd stop in there because they sold some basic frozen veggies. You know what? They were more often than not on clearance (50 cents rather than a dollar) because no one else was buying them...

I was told lentils are elitist. I was told that the portion size was not suitable because it encouraged obesity (it made 2 quarts and I wasn’t suggesting that as a single serve. Eye roll.)
I was told it was ‘woke’. I was told it was too vegan.

But then my recipe for a dessert involving two cans of coconut milk, a can of condensed milk and dried coconut was applauded as a light economical approachable recipe. It also made 2 quarts and was a calorie bomb compared to the soup but designed to be filling and sweet for kids in small portions compared to junk food.

One of the managers critiquing earns 70k a year is probably a 40 BMI. The other earns more and recently paid for lipo rather than lose weight the old school way. Both argue constantly that cooking is too hard, they don’t understand my job but that poor people are lazy and need to try harder.

IFeelMoiGerbil,fdq6mms,t3_emg6ba,"I was on social security for 15 years due to my disabilities. I learned so much about shopping and cooking on a budget it actually helped me back into work.

So I can say that two things are true at once: portion control will save money and high calorie food is often cheaper than ‘healthy’ food.

I couldn’t afford a lot of what other people treat themselves with when I was poor. Even Netflix was out of my budget. No socialising, eating out, cinema, buying a book or music. But I could afford £1 every so often on something to eat. 

Here that could buy 5 custard filled donuts from the local supermarket. So £5 a week ‘treat money’ couldn’t buy me any of the stuff above but it could buy me 25 donuts. 

I’m going to guess they are about 250 calories each so an extra 1250 calories a day or 6250 calories a week. About a 2lb weight gain a week or 104 a year if you eat to TDEE the rest of the time on frugal food.

And before someone says but Netflix costs £5 a month, a lot of the things people reward themselves involve access to transport, a decent credit rating, a bank account that allows full financial inclusion and safe access to them.

But you just need to round £1 every day in leftover coins from paying the electric top up and you’ve got something immediately available to you that gives you a reason to leave the house, chat to someone and engage and forget all the other things you had say no to like doing laundry because you needed the electric to wash your hair today or not cooking because you need a bus fare to the hospital on Friday.

No major country sets social security at a level even close to above the poverty line. Most reassess this once a decade at most. This level of income such as unemployment benefit or sickness benefits across the global north is deliberately set to be less than what i needed to reach the poverty line. It is fucking hard and getting off it is even harder with the way tax and wages taper offs happen plus the underlying reasons remain unaddressed.

Now I never ate donuts or spent my money on cheap high calorie food because I’m a recovering anorexic. But I struggled with willpower during that time on other short term choices that made bad long term decisions.

Then I went back to work and my food insecurity was solved overnight. I was warm, I wasn’t hungry and I had stability and almost instantly my willpower reappeared. People in the high stress of poverty make survival level decisions and while CICO applies I can completely understand why often cheap comforting food or portion control is the one thing people don’t deny themselves in a world of having to deny yourself.

Yes, they’d save £5 a week and all those calories but the human mind is more wired to small regular pleasantries than one big nice thing so asking poor people to override biology consistently is huge.

But there are things they can do to mitigate this. Don’t eat all the donuts every day. Portion control elsewhere. Be honest with yourself. Look for other outlets. Sit with some discomfort. Train yourself off instant gratification. Don’t let 5 donuts become 10 as the weight creeps on. Exercise.

There are reasons the bag of donuts really calls to you in poverty but you don’t have to excuse every call. This is why I say both the statements people make on this subject are true. But the polarising ignores that you can take a little from column A and column B and make more than defending a point ideologically."

The fat people are rare and those who are there are more stocky or pudgy, as you say, and wouldn't even be called ""smallfats"" by contemporary FAs.  

Obviously, no one denies that obese people have always existed but if we looked at a modern photo from your average family in 2020, there would be an obvious and striking difference between them and an average family in 1920."

LovelyLittleJay,fdkqazb,t3_elw2xp,Let’s flip their logic. If you have to manipulate your diet by eating any amount of extra calories per day and make sure you’re mostly sedentary so you’re guaranteed to gain weight then you’re not actually meant to be overweight/obese and it’s not genetics.

And I legitimately believe they don’t understand what they’re doing wrong. They really believe that what they’re eating is normal. We need so much education on nutrition. I never learned about calories in/out outside of a 20 min lesson in high school. It really needs to be taught more. I really feel bad about how ignorant some people are when it comes to what they eat.
WalkerInDarkness,fdm3a6r,t1_fdkm007,And some people try really hard while not knowing what the fuck they’re doing which leads them to failing.

But obviously one candy bar is not a whole picture of what I ate on a regular basis. People just used that as an excuse. Oh, she eats candy bars and is thin and I eat them and I’m fat. People often told me that I was too thin and needed to eat a sandwich. It was kind of hurtful. Some people even accused me of throwing up my meals, but I was never actually too thin. I was in a healthy weight range most of my life. But people’s view of a healthy weight is warped these days. Now that I’ve gained some weight, my obese family is just telling me it’s genetic and I’m meant to be fat because they are. That I’m going to continue gaining weight because it’s “meant to be.” I’m glad that I understand that it’s my own eating habits that did this because I know I can do something about it, although I can’t convince my family of that.

The ones who end up fine seem to kind of take a break or otherwise leave the spotlight, at least for a while, and then transition into non-Disney stuff. Obviously not 100% true in all cases, but that seems to be the pattern.

At least the first three you listed all seem to have intense mental health issues which would be very much exacerbated by being in the spotlight. Heck, I wouldn't even argue the idea that they might have been somewhat influenced by being in the spotlight. Some former stars have said that Disney is an extremely controlling company, and they micromanage your life when you are involved with them. I can't imagine that's helpful either.

Bella Thorne is interesting... She did just direct a porn video not to long ago. So uh, yeah. Also apparently wrote a book of poems. She frustrates me because she's not a bad actress but it seems like she'd rather cause controversy and be famous for that than actually rely on her talent.

Calorie counting is disordered and doesn't result in weight loss, I eat 500 calories per day and can't lose weight. 

Weight isn't a measure of health, and doctors are wrong to focus on the number. Because my blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar numbers are the most perfect my doctor has ever seen and they framed the lab results on their office wall. Those numbers are acceptable ways to measure health, but not BMI.

sdlfksafkjlk,fdr9lvv,t3_emr6ja,"Serious question about BMI: we know that it isn't fully applicable to athletes due to increased muscle mass. I was wondering, are we taking for granted its applicability to the general public? I ask because the fitness industry is also booming these days, and was thinking that a significant number of people do engage in fitness and are more muscled than we think. This question was inspired by the fact that I, as someone who is around 20-30 year olds mostly, rarely see fat people around me; this is just anecdotal but still got me thinking whether people are actually more fit than we assume. Is there data to show that I am wrong and people really are getting obese, as in their BMI increase is mostly fat and not muscle?"
KuriousKhemicals,fdrn29q,t1_fdr9lvv,"80% of Americans don't even meet the CDC guidelines for physical activity, and those are meant to be an achievable target, not ideal recommendations. Most men can gain around 40 pounds of muscle in their lifetime above baseline if they work like a bodybuilder to do it but avoid steroids, women half of that. Even bodybuilders rarely crack the threshold of BMI 30, and that's an amount of muscle that makes you look like a freak. The amount of muscle needed to make you attractively fit doesn't actually weigh that much. And people are, if anything, less fit than BMI gives credit for since around 25% of people who are a normal weight by BMI have a body fat percentage that's considered obese.

I don't see a lot of fat people either, but that's because I'm 29 years old living in an urban area in one of the thinnest states and like to hang out with people who enjoy active hobbies. Your anecdotal experience is almost certainly heavily pre-selected by demographics and personal preferences."
slapmyalpaca,fdsb3g5,t1_fdr9lvv,"If a doctor sees you and you’re obviously very physically fit, I doubt that they will be concerned about a high BMI. However, even with a lot of muscle mass it would be really strange to be in the obese category as you’d have to put on a LOT of muscle."
sdlfksafkjlk,fdrsdew,t1_fdrn29q,"Thanks, I think your answers make sense.

For the apparent paradox that the rise of the fitness industry doesnt appear to be slowing down the rise of obesity, could it be that gyms are mostly making money on clients not showing up (except the super high end gyms maybe)? Could it also be that, as big as the fitness industry is, it is still dwarfed by the food industry?"
Erik0xff0000,fdrsu5d,t1_fdrsdew,"most people do not significantly  lose weight/gain muscle in the gym. It takes an awful lot of time to do either, one hour a week isn't going to do much for either"
KuriousKhemicals,fdruvxa,t1_fdrsdew,"Gyms absolutely make money on people not showing up. That's why they offer specials around now when people are making well intentioned plans that most likely won't be followed through. And yeah, the fitness industry is probably growing because an increasing number of people know they need to do something about their condition and try to motivate themselves with the threat of wasted money, but behavior change is hard and it often still doesn't happen.

It's an interesting connection to the whole ""diet industry"" canard. People do the same thing with diet programs, but unlike with fitness centers/equipment, those are almost exclusively used by people who want to lose weight, so people can clearly understand that failure and non-persistence is common. It's easy to see that a lot of money paying for the product doesn't necessarily mean a lot of people achieving the desired outcome. The ""fitness industry"" grows with that population too, but it's mixed with a smaller population that are effectively paying for infrastructure to perform a hobby. People who pay for hobbies they enjoy tend to be committed and continue doing it regularly; people trying to make a behavior change more often don't."
carson63000,fdso0wj,t1_fdrsdew,"I suspect it’s not so much a paradox as the hollowing out of the center.

I don't buy pizza and reese's cups anymore. I make my own. I make my own bread and my own nut butters. I'm spending more time, but I'm spending time doing something I love, and receiving a better quality product for the amount of energy I've expended. It makes me think about what is actually in my food, and I've become a lot of aware of what and how much I'm consuming.

New year resolutions give rise to a month of frantic efforts to be perfect with some major habit you've resolved to change; then, as with any major change in fundamental habits, missteps and failures inevitably happen which deflates people's zeal for the changes they've vowed to undertake leading them to eventually taper off and quit whatever it was they resolved to do by the time February rolls around.  People go into it like ""December 31st will be my last hoorah so I'm going to binge myself stupid and then never do that again starting January 1st."" Habits don't change that neatly. If you've been habitually binging you will do it again after January 1st; if you're not prepared for that reality and you're banking on some ephemeral clean break from past established habits (which is the mindset resolutioners get into), you're setting yourself up for failure. Setting yourself up to think this way isn't going to help you when you hit pitfalls and almost inevitably find yourself being inconsistent come February.

"" RESULTS: The proportion of life spent in good perceived health between ages 50 and 75 progressively decreased with increasing BMI from 81% in normal weight men and women to 53% in men and women with class II obesity which corresponds to an average 7-year difference in absolute terms. The proportion of life between ages 50 and 75 years without chronic diseases decreased from 62 and 65% in normal weight men and women and to 29 and 36% in men and women with class II obesity, respectively. This corresponds to an average 9 more years without chronic diseases in normal weight men and 7 more years in normal weight women between ages 50 and 75 years compared to class II obese men and women. No consistent differences were observed between cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Excess BMI is associated with substantially shorter healthy and chronic disease-free life expectancy, suggesting that tackling obesity would increase years lived in good health in populations""
