zenyattatron,fdgw6l7,t1_fdgrzgq,"Copied from some other person smarter than me.

""This will get buried, I used to be in the Wool Industry, sheep VERY rarely die from heat exhaustion. Wool has a very high specific thermal resistance which means sheep can survive in quite high temperatures. Its true you should shear them once per year, in spring, however they could probably survive 3 - 4 years without shearing. 

Also saying they are now bred for producing an unnatural amount of wool is quite far from the mark. For it to be saleable it needs to be strong and as white as possible, if there is too much wool on the sheep it becomes brittle and weak. In poorer countries the Sheep arent actually bred for the wool, more the milk. Romania  for example.

The amount of research PETA has done into this is laughable. Also on other points from them, the better the Sheep is treat, the more money the farmer will get. So they are actually very well looked after on the whole.

Of course there are cases of cruelty, but these are certainly not the norm, as with anything you get some people who dont have a moral compass, but this will never change, they should be focusing their efforts specifically on these people and not the whole industry. 

Wool itself if natural and biodegradable, we have to shear the sheep, so why not use it? It certainly has a much lower environmental impact than cotton and man made fibres. Cotton uses so much water its mad 8-10,000l per kg."""

elf-y,fdgzlf8,t1_fdgy5v8,"Yes. Because like our own hair, a sheep’s wool starts to decline in quality as it ages. Once the wool is no longer high enough quality to be profitable, the sheep is slaughtered and more are continually bred.

It’s not the shearing of the sheep that is the problem. It’s the exploitation of a sentient creature for money, and discarding that creature once it’s no longer useful to us."

Do you think this ""development"" suddenly spontaneously occurred, or do we agree that selective breeding has created these changes in woolly undercoat? This person you quoted is only talking about modern-day term selective breeding, while most of the mutations from the wild sheep to the domesticated sheep occurred in past selective breeding; which results in purposely missing the point PETA tries to make here."

PetankAchvalRaffLorN,fdi1gvu,t1_fdh34ia,"ok.

How's this.

We've bred sheep, thousands of years ago, to have no real fight or flight response.

When coyotes get through the gates, sheep just let themselves get eaten alive.

You want to say keeping them alive is animal cruelty. uhm, ok. So, if they go extinct, and don't live, are they happier?

If we don't have chicken lay eggs, why have chickens.

So Peta doesn't want animals to be alive in captivity, and if they are released, they are sure to die.

Legioneer,fdgzghd,t1_fdgxbon,"I feel like it’s you missing the point. 

Even if the production of wool is a highly unnatural, selectively bred trait, PETA is alleging that this amount of wool causes discomfort to and kills the sheep.

synfulyxinsane,fdhoxyr,t1_fdhmx67,"Mulesing is a hit button topic in fiber arts communities especially seeing as some of us raise our own animals. I used to show livestock and had no idea this took place until recently.  After researching it, it's pretty fucked up, but seems to be a solution stemming from the way we bred certain breeds of sheep. The folds of loose skin really are a health hazard and if they get fly strike or any other sort of skin related issues it can lead to an agonizing death, but idk if I would have just jumped to the solution of trim the excess skin off."
phaelox,fdhnhz4,t1_fdhmx67,"So I had to look this up, as I'm not familiar with the term [mulesing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulesing). Holy shit:

> Mulesing is the removal of strips of wool-bearing skin from around the breech (buttocks) of a sheep to prevent the parasitic infection flystrike (myiasis).[1] The wool around the buttocks can retain feces and urine, which attracts flies. The scar tissue that grows over the wound does not grow wool, so is less likely to attract the flies that cause flystrike. Mulesing is a common practice in Australia for this purpose, particularly on highly wrinkled Merino sheep.[1] Mulesing is considered by some to be a skilled surgical task.[2] Mulesing can only affect flystrike on the area cut out and has no effect on flystrike on any other part of the animal's body."

Does it mean it is a bad thing? No, it just means we’ve created an opportunity both for great good and great harm to come to these animals. They either get the most luxurious life an animal could want, or they die a slow death in the streets and backwoods. 


What matters is the sheep farmers keep good care of their sheep, not that over the past thousand years or so we’ve changed sheep to be non-self reliant, and I’d hope that usually this is the case. The wool of stressed sheep, or of sheep in poor conditions, is worth far less than healthy, clean white wool. 


The sheep get protected from all their natural predators, and we shave them a few times a year for cash. It’s a good deal honestly.


I don’t see this matter as a particularly heinous one, especially in the shadow of the chicken and cow industry. If there were to be any legislation passed, I could see there being a limit on how little wool you can leave in the winter, just so the sheep isn’t freezing his ass off."

Just because you dislike it doesn't make it any less valid.  If we didn't use milk, meat and leather etc cows would not exist they would literally die off. Virtually every animal currently used for any kind of human production would also cease to exist because they have no other purpose and their existence would literally become detrimental to their replacement (land use and foodstuffs). That's not an ""argument"" it's a fact.

Just say what you really think... ""I don't care"".

My argument is that they are tasty and in the case of sheep, keep me warm... it's not about extinction for me, or virtually anyone, that's just a fact that gets pointed out, not an ""argument"".

Even if we just let them all go, tomorrow, you know what happens?  One day while they are minding their own business grazing on some sweet grass a ***!surprise motherfucker!*** bite on the neck, flesh being ripped from their breathing body as they die.  Sounds wonderful.

>It's such a lazy and dumb argument

I would imagine every ""argument"" is dumb and lazy if you don't agree with it.  That said, the dumb and lazy (and misleading) part of it is wanting to eliminate them altogether rather than work on improving laws and regulations that would improve the lives of animals.

REAL animal welfare people care about that.

But improving lives and conditions is not really the point is it?  The point is to stop the use of.   That's why peta routinely kills the animals they ""care"" about, death is preferable to them. THEY (the individuals at Peta and like-minded) ""feel"" better that an animal is no longer ""suffering"" their existence.  To me, that is horrifically immoral and entirely selfish. 

If all the animals currently used in production were absolutely pampered, and had fabulous lives right up until the point their were slaughtered (humanely) Peta would still exist and you'd just change *your* argument, because it's not about the ""suffering"".  It never is and never will be.

You look at a sheep in a pen and think ""how cruel"". It doesn't look up at the stars at night and woe is me.

I don't see Peta or anyone for that matter mourning over the loss of a gazelle when a lion takes it down. Because it's the ""order of things"" and ""nature"". This is absolutely no different, no different at all. Now you might say ""but millions!"".  I say ""more"" is a relative term to morality.  If one suffers it makes no literally difference if they all suffer.

If there were one million lions and 100 million gazelles would you then care about all the gazelles getting ripped to piece while still breathing? If not, you're a hypocrite.

That brings us to humans.  There are billions of people living lives of suffering in one form or another, from poverty to genocide, perhaps we should just eliminate them to alleviate their occasional suffering?  ""Oops, I see your parents are poor, this means you'll be poor, someone hand me a scalpel stat!""

All morality plays are stupid. ""Net Improvement"" is in your mind.  Not only that but you have assigned all sheep to lives of suffering and you probably know absolutely NOTHING about sheep, just making assumptions that they are all treated horribly.

>If you know that a human fetus will be born with a severe disability and will not have a happy life, then you abort it, right?

Inquisitor1,fdgut5w,t1_fdgnz5k,"People are against eugenics not because the ideal/goal is fundamentally flawed, but because the ethcis when put in practice is questionable, beacuse we know in advance there will be arguments against what traits are harmful and because it's not quite possible in practice on a global scale (which many famous proponents of it wanted). If you knew that a baby when born would kill it's mother and immediately get cancer, nobody would argue that those traits are good. If you know that a baby is gonna have dark skin, well that trait is beneficial in parts of the world and at worst neutral in some parts thanks to technological advances."

But I agree with /u/Intelligent-donkey it's really dumb to shit on them for the statement in the OP. They're not saying we should just kill all the sheep, they're saying we shouldn't breed things that can't live healthy lives without us exploiting them. You can argue with that but it's a very different statement than ""we need to let all the sheep sweat to death"" which is what the Twitter reply is framing it as."

But [these sheep](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b8/d0/bb/b8d0bb53f529133f434ff991f0982b35.jpg) for example probably aren't particularly happy, I don't think you can really pretend like you're doing sheep a favor by breeding them just to lock them up in conditions like that."

If they're pastured their day-in day-out life may seem idyllic but it doesn't mean they haven't suffered.

I would love it if we could put a stop to the livestock industry without killing lots of animals, by just stopping the breeding programs and letting them live out their lives.  
I just don't really see it happening though, it would cost a ton of money, with no return on investment other than the fact that those animals get to live out their lives.  
I *would* support it though if the government paid to take care of those animals until they died a natural death, but I doubt that enough people would agree with me so I don't think it will ever happen."

Honesty sheep don’t mind being crowded together for short periods of time. They are a herd species and feel most comfortable when they are together with other sheep. Even if they are in a vast field, you probably aren’t going to see too many sheep off doing their own thing for too long, they naturally herd together. 

That said, yes sheep need space and pasture land to be happy. But that really does look like a shearing barn, given the length of their wool and lack of food and water troughs. As soon as they are sheared they will go back to the field with their other sheared buddies to munch on some grass."

 Humans have been genetically engineering creatures which benefit them ever since the first wolf came close to share the spoils of a hunt, the Incas were the first to genetically engineer crops to be better for our consumption as well, with the progress of the mighty potato.


If PETA wanted to make their point more viable they should argue that we've made domestic sheep so shit at surviving in the wild that getting caught in brambles can kill them as they're immobile and die of thirst. **A herbivore dies by a plant.** That's some next level lack of survivalism bruh"

How ironic that they are responsible for killing millions of animals for food a day, but Peta offers euthanasia services for shelters that are run on donations and can't afford their own euthanasia service (to you know, *ethically* put down an animal) and they lose their minds. 

Peta has never made any claims to save all of the animals lives, they are literally called: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Not People for Never Killing Animals Ever. They aren't Buddhists either. Ethical just happens to also mean not paying for businesses to exploit animals as a general rule, but Peta is also supportive of adopting animals from shelters, saving whales, saving sharks, etc. Ethical is the overall goal. 

Their marketing tactics leave something to be desired, it doesn't make me want to align with them tbh. In fairness to a lot of their ads though, a lot of them are intentionally supposed to be gross and triggering, because slaughterhouses are horrible gross places, the treatment of animals through history has been terrible. 

Peta doesn't deserve most of the hate they receive, I feel like a lot of times, people are waiting to jump at anything they do (like OP) and not really take in the messages as a whole.

Maybe I'm missing some context, but I don't see anyone saying that. Personally, I have no issue with wool, but I can at least understand their argument. Buying wool increases the demand for wool, which means more sheep will be bred for the purpose of creating wool.

Golzy,fdgpl3g,t3_el9n2r,"This will get buried, I used to be in the Wool Industry, sheep VERY rarely die from heat exhaustion. Wool has a very high specific thermal resistance which means sheep can survive in quite high temperatures. Its true you should shear them once per year, in spring, however they could probably survive 3 - 4 years without shearing. 

Also saying they are now bred for producing an unnatural amount of wool is quite far from the mark. For it to be saleable it needs to be strong and as white as possible, if there is too much wool on the sheep it becomes brittle and weak. In poorer countries the Sheep arent actually bred for the wool, more the milk. Romania  for example.

The amount of research PETA has done into this is laughable. Also on other points from them, the better the Sheep is treat, the more money the farmer will get. So they are actually very well looked after on the whole.

Of course there are cases of cruelty, but these are certainly not the norm, as with anything you get some people who dont have a moral compass, but this will never change, they should be focusing their efforts specifically on these people and not the whole industry. 

Wool itself if natural and biodegradable, we have to shear the sheep, so why not use it? It certainly has a much lower environmental impact than cotton and man made fibres. Cotton uses so much water its mad 8-10,000l per kg."

Thankfully, new documentaries have gathered footage which show what [is the current norm in the wool industry.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4268&v=LQRAfJyEsko&t=1h11m06s) Now anyone can judge for themselves whether they consider it to be cruel.

> It [wool] certainly has a much lower environmental impact than cotton and man made fibres.

[That's debatable:](https://slate.com/technology/2008/01/if-i-want-to-help-the-environment-should-i-buy-wool-or-cotton.html)

> Cotton seems like a sensible alternative, but I’m sure it’s not without its environmental drawbacks. So which fabric is greener, wool or cotton?

> There’s an apples-to-oranges aspect to your question, since wool and cotton have very different environmental downsides. 

> **The bottom line is that cotton probably wins this face-off by a nose, given the sheer volume of methane issuing forth from the planet’s sheep.**

> With the former, as you note, the chief concern is methane; for the latter, it’s nitrous oxide released by inorganic fertilizers. On top of that, not all wool or cotton is created equal; much depends on the technology employed in the fields or pastures.

> Producing wool also requires a vast amount of water—not only to raise and care for the sheep, but also to rid the raw wool of numerous impurities. It takes approximately 500,000 liters of water to manufacture a metric ton of wool; this figure is even higher when the sheep in question are fed in confined quarters, where extra water is required to manage the manure.

> Cotton is pretty thirsty, too, though the crop can get some of its liquid sustenance directly from the heavens rather than via manmade systems. According to the United Nations, producing one cotton T-shirt requires the input of 2,500 liters of water.

> The Lantern could go on and on about some secondary issues, such as pesticide use in cotton fields and the nitrogen in sheep dung, but he’ll spare you the deepest part of the rabbit hole.

edit: The [article you linked to in one of your comments comes to a similar conclusion:](http://envormation.org/environmental-footprint-of-clothes-and-comparison-of-cotton-and-linen-flax-fabric/)

> It is difficult to draw a simple conclusion from this information, as to which fabric has the lowest environmental impact overall, as textiles made from natural fibres often require more water (e.g. for irrigation) and more land than synthetic textiles. However, it would appear that natural bast fibres such as flax, hemp and nettle have an edge overall."

I don't have time to watch the full documentary, and while the acts being committed in it are atrocious I am of the opinion that these videos are an example of outliers and not the norm, given that the source is a anti-farm organization, I doubt they'd be interested in pushing out information that puts farms in a good light. The trouble here would be finding a non biased source willing to show farm life in an objective way to let people judge for themselves.

Some people legitimately think that their meat comes from a wild cow or from the farm down the road with 4 animals and somehow that can feed the entire continent.

Sheep are more popular in australia/new zealand and we don't see the exploitation in North America because it's not really part of our diet.

Are we happy with the dispassionately violent and exploitative relationship that we have with the other animals that share this planet with us? 

We are the bad guys in the movie of earth, there is just no question. We’ve annihilated countless species and to this day we keep conscious, gentle sentient mammals housed in horrendous conditions where they wait to have their throat slit while still babies. Like cows are sacrificed at 2/3 years old, they can live till over 20. 

This is the very tip of the iceberg, I could write 10,000 words on the barbaric horrors of animal agriculture and still not get to sea level. 

I also feel that I could make a compelling argument that this is the most important moral emergency facing our generation.

EDIT 

I should clarify why I feel this is arguably the biggest moral emergency facing our times. 

Let’s take another moral emergency, one that only effects human animals, seeing as we are humans, it makes sense why we prioritise them. We have a history of only extending our compassion to members of our group. The circle of compassion, or moral concern, has expanded over the  years, but it’s not yet reached outside of our own species. Non-human animals currently have no general moral considerations. 

Okay, so let’s take a moral crisis - Human Trafficking: are you a human trafficker? What about your friends and family? The people that walk past you in the street? Do you support human trafficking? Do you know anyone that does? Do you directly and knowingly finance it with your hard earned wages? 

Everyone hates human trafficking, we all agree that it’s horrendous. 

But with animal exploitation and suffering, it’s us who are the perpetrators. Not only do we not acknowledge this as a moral emergency, we don’t even recognise it as a moral problem. 

Meat eating is celebrated and loved, it’s championed and promoted. We love animal flesh and organs, we love their eggs and bodily secretions. It’s a huge part of our culture. 

Add this to the ridiculously devastating impact on the climate and the planet, the deforestation for feeding lots and soy plantations, soy that’s grown and tuned into feed pellets that we feed to cows so we can eat the cow.. the anti biotic resistance caused by reckless overuse in animal agriculture, the absurd amount of plastic fishing lines in the ocean, over fishing, obesity and heat disease and hypertension and diabetes.. plus the psychological demands of creating jobs for humans that consist of day in, day out violence and cruelty in abattoirs and factory farms.

IndigoBlue14,fdgls9e,t1_fdgje83,"Sheep never had this much wool until we bred them this way. Just like we bred pugs so much they can't breathe right, and King Charles spaniels so their skulls are too small for their brains and they have seizures.

Think what you like about wool, but over breeding any animal is unhealthy and cruel, whether it's so they make more wool for us or grow meat at an unhealthy rate, or so they grow more wool than is safe and healthy for them. It's all about money in that case, and about 'cuteness' in inbred cats and dogs."

I don’t think there’s any point in making a list of which animal being exploited has got it worst.  I’m just like you know what?  If we eat it or something from it, or in some way wear it or use a product it creates, the exploitation is awful.  Period.


Pets are a grey point for me.  I’m against breeding more because there are already too many, but I’m not all “nobody should own a pet it’s exploitation.”  My one cat is a literal rescue-as in I picked her up out the gutter all bloody after something had attacked her, took her to the vet, paid several hundred dollars, then when I spoke to the neighbor who owned her at the time the neighbor said put the cat outside and it would be fine.  For context, it was 22 degrees F, the cat had fur shaved off in the wound cleaning process, and still couldn’t walk.  Long story short cat recovered at my house for 3 months (since old owner wouldn’t let her in their house) and I eventually told the old owner we would like to keep her, and now she’s ours.


Something like that it’s like...I get nothing out of that arrangement other than helping an animal.  Maybe occasionally the cat gives me love, but she also does stuff like lick my homemade pumpkin pie on Christmas morning.  Point is, pretty sure I’m the one being exploited in this arrangement, but I’m okay with it.


Sorry for rant.


TLDR: farming animals I don’t try to make it a competition which has it worst.  And while yes I know pets can be exploited (breeding, abuse, etc) its very possible to own a pet thats not being exploited imo.

They adopt animals that are too sick/injured to be adopted and euthanize them so animal shelters can remain no-kill shelters and help their adoption numbers (people don't adopt from kill shelters and will avoid them). Peta adopts them and if they can't find a home will euthanize them.

2. This still supports that main message in this tweet insofar as they're against mass breeding and selective breeding. We breed animals far too often than we can handle for our own good. We selectively breed animals for traits that are detrimental to their health.

3. Euthanizing an animal that is terminally ill and in pain to end their suffering is a humane way to end it's life and that's why we're having the conversation about assisted suicide for humans. If your pet is pain free but on it's way it then a natural death is preferred, but lots of people can't devote the time required and care needed to see a sick animal into it's final days. 

4. Peta killing 1000 animals (didn't bother to verify that stat) is a small percentage of the animals that they have saved over the course of their existence. Remember, cows and pigs are animals too. Specieism makes us believe that cats and dogs are somehow more valuable, intelligent and sentient compared to common livestock.

MisterJedi117,fdgouuc,t3_el9n2r,"If I understand correctly their intentions, they're trying to say that humans breed sheep to grow more wool than is necessary, and that we should stop, because they're not ours to wear. Which still is fucking stupid, because even if we have done that, it hurts nothing to shear a sheep if done properly. It's literally just a haircut.

PETA being morons again"
Bakuhoe_Thotsuki,fdgq5g0,t1_fdgouuc,"I admittedly know very little about the wool industry, but I imagine that, like every other animal industry, the primary focus is on volume of product and cost of production over the wellbeing of the animals being used. I don't imagine that the living conditions for such animals is terribly pleasant. So maybe the haircut isn't a big problem, but perhaps cramped and overcrowded living conditions, treatment by owners, and physical/health problems caused by selective breeding may contribute to pretty miserable lives for a lot of livestock."
moreofmoreofmore,fdgre2w,t3_el9n2r,Yeah but the point is we literally bred them to be that way. They wouldn't need to be shaved if we didn't make them that way.

Fake_William_Shatner,fdgxskg,t3_el9n2r,"Well, they aren't wrong, either. They said they are ""bred"" to have too much wool to survive -- and that's true. But the real question is; are sheep OK with getting shorn? Probably.

I'm not 100% against Peta because having more compassion and not harming animals when we don't need to -- it's good for us as human beings. It would be great to have a cruelty free world (though, we'd have to monitor nature because it tends to have members that kill and eat other members of nature).

Does anyone know if these are actual conversations, or people setting them up?"

The majority would conform to the new norm (at least overtly) BUT you get the minority who can't let go of the old ways. They getting locked up and marginalised as poachers, farmers, etc. At the moment there is no way to know who would be one of them. I can't even say no to a spliff never mind a pair of nice warm wooly socks and a stake.  I'd probs get locked up, eventualy.

Al Capone, Pablo Escobar, ""El Chapo"" all have something in common. They supplied a market where people with ethics didn't. If all sheep, cows, those big liver ducks, various cattle that are clearly man playing god where to get mass slaughtered as to reduce future suffering. In that market there would a rise an unregulated ""black market"" in forbidden lifestock and derivitive goods. As this market is unregulated the animals that suvived the original sanctioned massacres would likely live in awful conditions. Firstly to avoid detection by the authorities, secondly because now there is no oversight as to what farmers can do to their livestock.

Genociding animals is pointless because some will always survive somewhere. I propose that we build a eugenics program to breed out the suffering over generations. Fix them the same way we fucked them."

AEnesidem,fdgnunr,t3_el9n2r,"I hate to be the guy but: I think this is a fail on your part, and on everyone who misreads this :p

not that i agree with them but what they say is:  
To wear sheep's wool, we bred them to naturally grow too much wool, which causes health issues. Just like we overbred some species of dogs with many health concerns as consequence. So their problem is that we force physical changes on animals through breeding for our own comfort, which they are against. That makes perfect sense.  


So, laugh with Peta, as i dislike them as well, but then at least make sure you understand what they say before you ridicule them :p"
nicoleschock,fdgpua2,t3_el9n2r,This is so stupid. We BRED them to have that amount of hair so we HAVE to shave them. Can you not read? Can we not use our contex clues!

Shadax,fdp61gm,t1_fdp3ih5,"That largest 32 bit number in seconds since the epoch (Jan 1st 1970) is on some date that year (2038) at a certain time.   One second later is a number too large for a 32 bit processor.

The largest 64 bit number in seconds is not doubled, it's exponential and would outlast the heat death of the universe or some incomprehensible amount of time like that.

Edit: Computerphile (brilliant channel from the computer science professors at University of Nottingham) have a fuller explanation

https://youtu.be/QJQ691PTKsA"
jtrot91,fdpbdli,t1_fdp3ih5,"Some extra explanation is that 32 bit signed numbers can go to 2^31 before doing something called overflow. It is 31 because one of the bits is to signify if it is positive or negative. 2^31 is about 2.14 billion (if you ever played runescape this number may sound familiar because of the same reason). That many seconds from 1970 is in 2038 (1 billion seconds is 30 something years). After it gets to the last possible number it will overflow and basically go to the first number, which is negative 2.14 billion, when would basically make the date think it is ~1902 or something.

Year 2038 problem on Wikipedia has some more information. It really shouldn't be an issue by then since we are already mostly using 64 bit (can go to 2^61, which is massively larger), but some lazy programmers will definitely still cause some issues, just hopefully not on anything too important."

RustDragon,fdqd9c5,t1_fdpqegh,Y2K made people complacent. It's not like we weren't aware that Y2K would eventually be a problem decades before Y2K. The number of cheap electronic devices and poorly maintained pieces of software has exploded.
WouldBeAllen,fdpk6ff,t1_fdp4etw,"Not a programmer so my knowledge is limited. But 32 bit means 32 individual 1s and 0s that encode data in binary. A 2 bit system can handle numbers up to 4 (00, 01,10,11) that's 2^2. 3 bits can encode up to 8 (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111) that's 2^3. And so on until 32 bits can hold 2,147,483,648 or 2^32. In 2038, 32 bits will no longer be able to hold all the seconds from 1970, so any old processors that can only work in 32 bits will break down.

The problem with your system sounds more like a memory leak or something (data being stored indefinitely in RAM until it's full), a problem well beyond my depth."
BipNopZip,fdpbint,t1_fdp4etw,Why was 10 million the max?
jtrot91,fdpopm4,t1_fdpc737,"Because I meant 63. For signed numbers it is one less. If it is unsigned it is 64 (the max amount of RAM you can have in a 32 bit computer is 2^32 (4.28 billion, or 4GB) and 2^64 in a 64 bit (basically unlimited for right now)."

A number larger than this will either crash the system because it runs out of space, or loop back around to 0, which in the context of dates would be UTC - 0. 00:00 1/1/1970. This breaks many, many things. This limit will be reached in the early hours of the 19th of January 2032.

A 64 bit system can store a string twice as long, which Google tells me hs a maximum value of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 in binary. In UTC, that's December of the year 292,277,026,596 A.D. 

That's almost 300 billion years from now. And considering in 7 billion years the earth will probably fall into the sun, and in 22 billion the universe might end(big rip), that's a very long time."

Neat"
PixelWave,fdozh29,t1_fdothz9,"Fun fact: While most centuries are not leap years, every century that's divisible by 400 is an exception to that exception and is a leap year.

So the year 2000 had was leap year since it is divisible by 400 (e.g: 2000/400 = 5 with no remainder)

the years 2100, 2200, 2300 won't be leap years but 2400 will.

I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."

MrMoodle,fdv094n,t1_fduekdv,It's also definitely a joke lol
fidelitysyndrom,fduwbog,t1_fduekdv,Maybe he didn’t need an exact address; just the street on which his friend lives. This would justify asking for a street name. Perhaps he lives on the same street of a store and the friend just wants to know the street’s name to explain to another person where the store is.
Water-Ninja,fdvrtcd,t1_fduekdv,I’ve asked this question many times. Phrased exactly like this lol. Didn’t realize it was incorrect
Ankoku_Teion,fdv1v5g,t1_fduekdv,pretty much everyone in my country refers to the name of a street as the street name. what else would you call it?

normal_whiteman,fdv67kn,t1_fdv1v5g,You would just ask what street they live on or the name of the street
BobbitWormJoe,fdvh1z6,t1_fdv1v5g,"Just street. ""Name"" is redundant, because a street is identified by its name. Same reason why you the questions ""Who are you?"" and ""What is your name?"" mean the same thing. Likewise, it's quicker to ask ""What street do you live on?"" rather than ""What is the name of the street you live on?"".

""What is your street name?"" is just awkward and no one says this in real life."
treyqa,fdv5lpz,t1_fduzxv7,"Or just ""what's your street's name"""
MentosCubing,fdvoa9s,t1_fdvh1z6,"My first thought was that this was part of a longer conversation and the person was just trying to get Mark's full address once piece at a time. In that case you usually do say ""Street name"" because it matches the format of the other questions."
Water-Ninja,fdvs4z1,t1_fdvh1z6,"I say this. And I’m 90% sure I’ve heard others say this too.

This_User_Said,fdsp140,t1_fdsksnh,"Coconut oil? Smells like god damn Caramel Delights Girl Scout cookies. I always get the organic coconut oil from the grocery store. Great for massages, sex, hair, etc.

Edit Hail to hair. My bad.

FYI- I'm female.

Never had feminine issues using it. This does not mean another female won't. Try small areas first.

Massages: my skin is fairly dry naturally. (Hot showers makes this worse) so I tend to actually benefit. Some may experience acne. Be careful.

Sex: Not sure of the chemistry of latex/oil etc. Please research before hand. I use birth control that has been successful so the condom vs oil is not my forte.

Hair: LESS IS MORE. Just like hair gel, barely get any and rub your hands together so it seems like there is none. Then scrunch uour hair around. Use more/less from there. 

Other than that; I'm not very girly? So I really have no say so in this matter. This is just from my experience and to be taken with a grain of salt...

... Or a drop of oil

incompetentbeing,fdss16d,t1_fdsrm8s,Coconut is actually a fruit/seed! The FDA wrongly classified it as a tree nut in 2006 and food companies have followed suit ever since as a precaution. But there is no known correlation between a tree nut allergy and a coconut allergy.

Jakeybaby125,fdry4uu,t3_emwn68,I'm very tempted to do this now.
dbx99,fds0z1t,t1_fdry4uu,You’ll clog your drain pipe
Gorilla1969,fdsg53g,t1_fdry4uu,"I inadvertently did this to my father. When I was a teen, I had severely dry skin. So just before stepping out of the shower every morning, I would douse myself in baby oil. I mean, I would really slather it on. Then I would lightly rinse to get the excess off and step out.

My father liked a relaxing bath once in a while. I didn't sufficiently rinse out the bottom of the tub that day. I never thought to, since he had a shower stall in the master bathroom and he rarely used the tub in the shared bathroom. This fateful day however, he filled the tub with hot water, had a nice soak, then suddenly discovered that he couldn't gain traction to stand up.

He drained the water thinking it would help. It was worse. All the oil that was previously floating on his bath water was now back on the surface of the metal tub. 

After panicking for five minutes or so, he soaped up his wash cloth and used it to clean the tub. While he was sitting in it, completely naked, wet, and freezing.

He was raging mad. I burst out laughing while he shouted the details of his ordeal at me. I couldn't help it. I got grounded and baby oil was banned from the bathroom."
silsool,fds95q7,t1_fdry4uu,I think if you have enough core strength you can pretty easily sit up or turn so that you're on your stomach. You'd need to be pretty fat or incredibly weak to pull this off.
McS3Xhaver,fdskl5z,t1_fdry4uu,yeah I'll fucking skater half-pipe my way out lady doesn't know shit about getting out of oil baths
DaughterEarth,fdtnwlh,t1_fdry4uu,When I was a kid my favorite part of the bath was when it was getting drained. I'd stay in the bath and kinda slide back and forth. It got easier and easier as there was less water (and still the soapiness). Like a poverty water slide

Gryndyl,fdsf1n5,t1_fdscabw,I'm betting she tried that.
JustARandomBloke,fdsia2o,t1_fdscabw,"Problem is that bathtubs are slightly slanted down towards the drain, so it is hard to push directly perpendicular to the tub, and any variation in your push will cause you to slide if you have no traction, which you don't because both the tub and your skin are covered in coconut oil.

I remember reading the story. She got out by filling the tub and draining it several times, until enough of the oil had washed away."

yamiyaiba,fdsh3hj,t1_fdsggsr,"Physics. If you have a flat surface, you can push directly against it, and as long as your pressure is 100% perfectly perpendicular to the ground, you don't need traction. 

On a curved surface, this isn't possible. You require some degree of traction, since you cannot apply flat pressure."

Post their 100lb overweight milestones and such... I’m sure you’d be able to convince plenty of them you cover themselves in coconut oil. None of them have any self esteem. Plenty of them just want to die of obesity, that’s their kink. Dying. Dying from
being fat sets them off. Death. Might as well call them premature necrophilifats.

Well, in the end I still had a lot of wax down there and my skin was to sensitive to rip it off any more. So I go into the bath tub hoping warm water would get it off. As soon as I sat down I knew I made a mistake. Water wasn’t doing anything so I had to end up using all the little vial of oil that came with the wax kit. When that was empty I was still stuck so I  resorted to vegetable oil. Whew. It took a while but I got unstuck and got the wax off. It was very painful."

>*How could this be? One possible explanation is that the oil's absorption actually causes more problems than it solves for some people. Your skin produces its own sebum to moisturize the skin. Applying oil to the skin affects natural oil balance. By applying more oil, your skin feels moisturized and may begin to produce less natural oil because it already feels oil-rich.*"

I was the same as well. I didnt care if my door hit their side of the vehicle or not.

It's a small garage that doesn't have a lot of spots to begin with, and there are certain very small spots, which are very clearly marked ""compact cars only"". And who parks in them most often? SUVs. And the building management does what about it? absolutely fucking nothing.

UnexpectedSharkTank,fdo7bct,t1_fdnndzv,"Three years ago my dog had a seizure. After he stopped shaking he acted like a Vietnam war vet, refusing to eat and drooling like a madman while staring blankly at nothing. I had just moved into an apartment but previously had driven from outside the city and parked near a place I knew had an emergency room for pets, so I deadlifted my 70+ pound dog into the car and sped through the ridiculous SF traffic. All the while, I'm holding my dog in the passengers seat because he's too weak to brace himself for braking. It was terrifying and shakes me up even thinking about it now.

I get to the hospital and there's no parking. This is the only free parking place I know of in the city, and every spot is taken. I'm rolling through all the secret spots I know and finally I give up. I don't give a fuck, I'm scared, on the phone with my Mom and trying to keep it all together. I park in the only place I can think of - unfortunately this means my trunk is slightly blocking one of those ramps for pedestrians that lead up to the sidewalk. Fortunately there's no businesses here, its mostly a homeless encampment and the backside of a warehouse. Fuck it, at least its close so I don't need to walk a mile with my best friend dying in my arms.

I bring my dog inside and they immediately call me into the back, honestly without saying a word. I lay Paddy down on the table and they get to work. I'm just standing answering questions and trying to rack my brain on what could have caused the damn seizure, but there's nothing really coming to mind. They give him fluids and X-ray him and he's essentially back to normal. They think he may have liver failure but they don't know and I don't have the money to find out. Turns out he's FINE! He was just dehydrated. Never gone through so many emotions in my life, and I left feeling like just about the shittiest dog owner in the world. I'd been lying in bed late that day because I felt sick and hadn't let Paddy out of my room, and therefore he didn't have access to his water dish. That was apparently enough to cause dehydration enough to have a seizure.

Anyway, Paddy is still weak so I carry him into the car. I notice there's a note on my windshield, which I'm trying to read while hauling this huge dog into the passengers seat. It reads: ""This is not a parking spot ASSHOLE"" with the asshole underlined three times. Never been so thankful to be noticed and understood. Your passive aggressive cards are definitely a good idea and will leave you so fulfilled. Definitely do it."

nhluhr,fdns7bb,t1_fdnp8rs,"You have to think about compounding the misery to the target.   If you clip the stem or slash the tire, the tire goes flat quickly.  Either way, the target sees the problem, fixes it, and it's over.  You don't need it to be flat immediately.  In fact, it might be better if it wasn't so the target doesn't associate the flat with you or your car.  Likewise, using the tool to removing the valve core from the stem is the wrong move.  Better I think to just loosen it significantly so it's not really apparent but still leaks a reasonable amount.  Target sees flat tire, inflates, maybe injects some tire sealant, and goes on.  Tire flats again.  Target starts to go mad."
Datdabdoe12,fdnpq6c,t1_fdnp8rs,I assure you removing the shrader valve is not a slow leak. It leaks about as fast as if you punched a whole in the tire and your not going to cut yourself. I work in a tire shop and thats how we drain tires to take them off the rim.

She was blocking in 3 other vehicles in park, for who knows how long, just to get that spot. Partially blocking traffic in the meantime.

Wezlington,fdnn9wx,t1_fdngunv,"Being at fault is relevant but not the end-all be-all.

Your insurance policy has a deductible. It doesn't matter who's fault the damage is, that's out of your pocket. Making a single claim on an incident that wasn't your fault probably won't impact your rates but multiple incidents certainly will. 

>I'm sure you already know that though."
PotatoPotential,fdo2hu1,t1_fdngunv,You are correct in a fair world but insurance likes to lower the odds by basically blaming both parties involved. Victim could've acted safer and prevented the accident. It's BS but it's a numbers game and I get it.

It looks very much like she turned in and ran out of forward room to complete the rotation because she misjudged the turn and, instead of reversing and correcting, she just said eff it.

Is it possible that her wheel would be turned like this after parking perfectly next to someone else who is parked badly?  Yes, but it is very unlikely.

It was during the Christmas season a couple years ago and it was, quite literally, the last spot left in the parking lot. This idiot has decided to park similarly to this car, at an angle on the drivers side. I parked right down the middle of my parking spot. Then I came outside from grocery shopping. 

This guy is standing there yelling at me saying I need to be aware of other cars. I calmly tell him I parked in the middle of my parking spot so there’s no issue. His obese wife can’t get into her car now and someone it’s my fault? 

I tell him to park better next time if they have issues, as I’ve parked in the middle of the fucking spot like I’m supposed to. He yells and yells and yells and I keep replying “middle!” And nothing else.

He finally crawls through the other side and flipped me off. I’m stuck on the road behind them now... and the obese woman can’t even properly turn her car and blocked the whole road. I hysterically laughed the whole time while the guy side-eyed me from the mirrors."

I wasn’t on the white line at all, but close. I get back at the end of my day and some jackass BMW has left a nasty note commenting on my parking along with “I have your license plate number!!!”. Ok dude. Nobody forced you to park there, and I’m not breaking any rules."
pr0ghead,fdo89k3,t1_fdnjoyz,">I've definitely parked like the car on the left before.

And that's the right thing to do, if you ask me. You try to make the best use of the area between the lines. Naturally that means you leave the most space on the driver's side where you have to open the door. Other passengers can get out before you park the car and get in after you've pulled it out again.

If your car is too big for a single parking space, that's your problem. Honestly, I wouldn't even mind, if they parked across 2 spaces then. Better than damaging other cars IMHO."

I see that she's close in my mirrors though and backed up slowly, but still could not get out without grazing their vehicle.....leaving a scratch on my right rear fender. Ghetto trash woman comes running out of the store screaming and telling customers walking in to call 911. She proceeds to call the police, leaving my manager no choice but to pull me from work duty making me loose my pay and tips for the night. Cops show up and look darn confused. Can't figure out why she would call over such a thing. They write up a report stating the woman had parked incorrectly and no damage was done to her vehicle although paint was removed from mine. They even drew a sketch up in the report showing her diagonal parking job. I get police report, send it to the insurance company, they contact hers, her company pays for my repair.

deehayzee,fdnq4io,t3_em95u3,"My first car was a POS jeep wrangler that I drove sans doors all summer.  If someone parked like this, I'd purposely center myself in the space so that they could not open their doors, and if they did, the first point of contact would be a massive steel step up bar that could only cause damage to their car and not mine.  I'd crawl out and feel like I'd done my part to make the world a better place.

It occurred to me later in life that perhaps their poor parking job was a trickle down effect of a person who was poorly parked on their other side, who had left prior to my arrival.  If that was the case, I do feel bad that they got caught in the crossfire.  Nevertheless, I broke the cycle."

Past the line into my parking space. I was so livid since there was so much space on the other cars driver side. I wanted to wait and see who came out but god knows how long that would have taken.

WardenDresden83,fdoam9x,t3_em95u3,"The issue with people like ""right side person"" is that they aren't teachable. They are aware of what they are doing, but they don't see anything wrong with their behavior. In such a self centered world view, they won't be shaken out of it by the happenstance of one meet cute in a parking lot. Sure,it makes us other drivers feel that we did our part and ""taught them a lesson."" Unfortunately the only lesson we taught them is that other people are dicks. Ironically the right lesson with the wrong subject.

Selfishness and ignorance are two of the most destructive forces in the world, and sadly you cannot change someone's mind until they are convicted of the fact that change is needed. A kind word and a friendly reminder will do more to plant a seed that my grow than passive aggressive retribution will. It doesn't always feel as liberating, and it is often met with distaste. But one shouldn't do the right thing merely for the rewars. Trust me, I've been there. We all have. But if the end we desire is people being right to one another, how are we to reach it through wrongness, hate,and anger?"

Charles Voyde Harrelson (July 23, 1938 – March 15, 2007)[1] was an American organized crime figure who was convicted of assassinating federal judge John H. Wood Jr., the first federal judge to have been killed in the 20th century. He was the father of actor Woody Harrelson.[2]

He was also a cocaine fiend:

In September 1980, Harrelson surrendered to police after a six-hour standoff in which he was reportedly high on cocaine.[21][22] During the standoff, he threatened suicide, stating that he had killed both Judge Wood and President John F. Kennedy

I can still see how his little lips would form those words and it shuts down my mom brain from the adorableness. They fixed him up in second grade and it was sad to lose Weed and Spencoh even tho it was time. 

Oh! And when he was about 7 he said he wanted to go bowling for his birthday. We’d never taken him and thought it was a weird request but whatever. About a month later we were driving and he says “look mom! bowling!”  It was a restaurant called Bully’s. Ooooohhhhhhhh. Poor kid went bowling for his bday and all he wanted was chicken strips. 

To be clear. We never mocked him or teased him for his speech. We saved it until he grew up. Ha! J/k. He was just the sweetest little boy and the way he spoke was part of it."

PubofMadmen,fdwp78u,t3_en6ikf,"I recently played an assistant teacher in France for an ESL (English as a Second Language) course, particularly American English.  It's amusing to discover that the teacher attained and used this text as an exercise from here in Reddit.

None of the students, first semester, could interpret 90% of the text exercise.

""he goes"" (did he say something or was he going somewhere?), ""I guess we're in Austin"" (are we or aren't we?), ""Anyway"", ""I was like..."", ""turns out"" ""a kid/this child"" ""he had"" (past tense, so he presently no longer has a speech impediment).

I love American English - it's become a language only for only Americans to understand.  It is no wonder that American films and television are inundated by English actors and chat show and news hosts that can speak ""correct"" international English.

American English has truly evolved into a dialect."

NatMe,fdxlvz5,t3_en6ikf,"I live in Canada and one year my 11 year old niece came to visit us for a month during the summer. She doesn't really speak English, but we sent her to a day-camp so she can stay busy and pick up some of the language. 

On the first or second day she tells us that she made a friend with this other girl, but couldn't tell us what her name was. The following day she says her new friend's name is Broken Leg. I was like, are you sure? That's a very weird nickname. She was adamant that this is what everybody called her, even the camp councilors. 

So as the week progresses my niece tells us that Broken Leg is no longer very nice and doesn't want to play with her anymore. I kept on going back to the name thing. 

""Are you SURE that this is what everyone calls her?"" 

""Yeah. Maybe they call her this because she's not very nice or broke her legs last year.""

Okay...

It was probably closer to the end of her stay at the day camp, maybe even after, I got my niece to repeat then name of how she hears other people say it. Turns out, the girl's name was Brooklyn. 

My poor niece! Poor Broken Leg! They first became friends but then Broken Leg couldn't understand why this foreign girl was calling her Broken Leg instead of Brooklyn. Unfortunately I wasn't the one picking her up from this camp daily so couldn't speak to the camp counselors and clarify the situation, and my parents and sister did not want to ask because they're not comfortable speaking in English either. 

I laughed so hard I cried when the mystery was resolved. This is now our favourite story to tell during family gatherings., even though my niece understandably hates it. And now Canada."

His name was Rob. Imagine being an immature 20 year old part timer and hearing Rob answering the store phone and just try to keep a straight face. “Hello Wandy Wiveh, Wob speaking.” And the hard thing about it was he refused to acknowledg he had an impediment, the boss tried to be upfront about it once and he totally shot her down, like “wtf are you talking about, I don’t have a speech impediment!!”"

So I went ahead and remembered this name -- the wrong name. After a few months, I begin questioning if I got her name right. It's Bayes' theorem: while I thought I heard Leanda, Leanne is a much more common name. The latter, therefore, could be much more probable. 

One day I asked her about it. She responded ""Leanne,"" and she insists that she never corrected me because she never realized I was mispronouncing it. Oops"
DrSenpai_PHD,fdzny0p,t3_en6ikf,"This is more of an honest mistake than a facepalm. I hope the original poster asked the kid more than once to double check, but really there was no avoiding it. The kid would've repeated ""Weed,"" and sometimes their name is what they say it is. By the third time, it becomes disrespectful to the person. If your name truly was Weed, imagine how annoying and sad it would to have to repeat your name three or more times to a person. It serves as a reminder of how weird your name is.

There are many people with weird or unfortunate names out there, everything from ""Dikshit"" to ""Wang Liqin."" Sometimes the most respectful thing to do is to not make a big deal out of it and move on."

rockaether,fdmfa7s,t1_fdlzvd7,"A vaccine is a small piece of **dead** or weakened virus. That's an important difference. 

China used to use live small pox virus to allow our body to""build immunity around it"" since 600 years ago. It did save lives by reducing the mortality rate from 80% to 15%, but it still kills. It's only when modern reseachers discover harmless cow pox virus can do the same job, we manage to eradicate small pox without killing 15% of us

Edit: Not all dead, some are just weakened."
drquiqui,fdmggdu,t1_fdlzvd7,"Well there are also adjuvants, in some (most?) vaccines, that potentiate the immune response by alerting different parts of the immune system to come check this shit out."

But it was daytime TV only.

It was a major scandal, and could have led to impeachment. Weapons were sold to enemies and drugs smuggled into the US. And all with government knowledge. It did lead to Reagan testifying before congress where ""I don't remember"" was a key statement, many times, perhaps 50 or more (obviously long ago so my recall is not perfect). Later events (Alzheimer's)show that perhaps he did not remember, but at the time he always seemed sharp so I have always found that doubtful.

Also keep in mind when I say pre-cable days that means 4 channels was nearly everything in many areas, and certainly mine. NBC, CBS, ABC and PBS. I don't recall if FOX stations were yet a thing then."

When North was going to take the Fifth and refuse to testify based on the fact the testimony could be used later on to convict him in court, Congress decided to grant him **limited immunity from prosecution** in that his testimony could not be used against him during a criminal trial, negating his fifth amendment claim.

Since basically the entire country saw Oliver North's testimony or heard about it in some way, it would be impossible for the testimony to NOT have affected his trial in some way. Hence the conviction was vacated as it was almost certainly based in part on testimony used in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

Iraq was being supplied arms by the Soviets and Iran was desperate for new stuff. The Reagan administration deemed the embargo useless because Iran could circumvent it by buying American parts and equipment from Americas allies. Meanwhile Reagan had a hard on for getting rid of the Sandinista government in Nicaragua and was backing various counter revolutionary groups(contras). But by 85 Congress cut off the funding for the contras. Now the Reagan administration said they traded missiles for the release of the hostages but continued to sell arms through Israel then just directly to Iran at a markup then giving the profits to the contras. The markup and funneling the profits to the Contras was Oliver Norths plan. While they were doing this the Reagan administration was publicly taking a hardline on selling arms to Iran. So in reality the missiles weren't pointed at Americas greatest enemy but were used against Iraqi tanks and aircraft. That's the Cole's notes version of events."

BobCrosswise,feazycc,t3_eo6zvh,"Yes.  That's not an accident.

The explicit point of US policy in the Middle East, and particularly in Iran, is destabilization. 

A stable Middle East would compete better on the international stage and thus threaten western hegemony, would better control its oil and thus undermine western oil companies, and most importantly, wouldn't provide a convenient excuse for the US government's ongoing expansion of foreign war and domestic surveillance.

One of the basic strategies for maintaining instability in the Middle East has been to interfere at one point to introduce some element (such as missiles to Iran), then at some later point, to use the existence of those things as an excuse for military action somewhere down the road.

Similarly, they're not far off from actually having nuclear capabilities, even though your average politician may try to deny it... there have been clear indications they've been marching forward towards the technology since about 2010 (not the least of which was Iran announcing, July 2018, that they had exceeded their enrichment quotas... you know, the same ones the U.N. said ""Do Not Exceed"" to, only a few short years, prior)."

All the students rushed to the door and pushed it, and began laughing. The teacher just set us up and no doubt he would have opened the door at the end just to laugh at us (he was like that).
All in all it was funny and I didn't even have to climb the gate.

Experience with Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication?  Experience of driving trucks for Swift Transportation?  The Christian band Swift, or Swift the rapper?  Swift lizards, Swift butterflies, Swift moths?  

Even in computing the word ""Swift"" is ambiguous?  Swift as OpenStack Boject Storage?  Or Swift as in the parallel scripting language developed Argone NL in 2007?  Or SWIFT,  a thermofluid software package by AVL?  Or Swift,  the ARM architecture CPU core in the Apple A6 and Apple A6X?"

Known_Performance,fdgm0dm,t1_fdghxzr,"That sounds pretty ducking dumb. NPS is supposed to be a metric of referral, yet this Ote metric sounds Like it is trying to measure experience or satisfaction. 

Either way NPS sucks because companies don’t use it for its proper purpose and try and say that NPS reflects how well the experience of their product is or how users perceive their product. Plus the scale gets so fucking stupid when you calculate total NPS by subtracting detractors percentage from promoters percentage because then you get a scale of -100 to 100 and no one usually understands what a “good” score is or what a -100 reflects in a real world scenario. There are way better metrics for that."

MandMs05,fe4yp1y,t3_enraoq,"Well, it looks like there are other billboards around it, and if it's something where you buy the billboard to put your advertisement on it, the fact that there used to be a tree there shouldn't stop you.

And if it's in a big city or something that was built in a rainforest or such, it could be easy to run out of places where there aren't trees, and one tree being cut down to help raise money to plant hundreds of other trees makes sense.

Or this could be a facepalm."

Edit: I was waaaaayyyy off:

The cost of billboard advertising in New York ranges from $3,000 to $20,000/month, and in Los Angeles billboard costs range from $2,000 to $15,000/month. In Chicago, billboards’ cost ranges from $2,000 to $12,000; San Francisco billboards’ cost ranges from $2,000 to $12,000; and in Philadelphia billboards cost from $1,500 to $12,000/month."
ForHigher159,fe4uohe,t3_enraoq,One tree's sacrifice for the good of many.
IslandMist,fe5caj2,t3_enraoq,"To be fair, the people who own the billboards cut down the tree. It’s not like the companies who want to advertise tell them to cut down wooded areas in order to place their ad. The owners just say, send the file and we’ll put it up in this area. Also, cutting down trees to cultivate an urban area is a far cry different to something like mass deforestation. It’s disingenuous to compare it as such. It is important to have trees and wooded parks in cities though. This is just one of those coincidental moments that resulted in a bit of irony, that’s all."

Also they thought he was one of their idols because of his hair, he looks like one of the Korean pop stars with the mask, but as soon as he takes it off it's super obvious that he is not"
TomBourgaize,fdrcyul,t1_fdqda84,"It’s an Asian culture thing, in the early 20th century there was a massive influenza epidemic that killed more than 20million people.  Japan has an earthquake in 1923 which made the air quality terrible for months, another flu epidemic in 1934, post ww2 air pollution from industry the. In 2002 there was the SARS outbreak then the bird flu in 2006 basically they have had a pretty long history of being forced to wear masks so now it’s common place."
Xzackly-1,fdr3n53,t1_fdqda84,Masks are common in Asia especially in South Korea.
gene100001,fdqfulf,t1_fdqep70,Cultural differences like this are fascinating. It's really lovely that some people care enough about not transmitting diseases that'll they walk around with a mask on all day. They're the polar opposite of antivaxxers
Pulse_Amp_Mod,fds6wju,t1_fdqep70,I’m pretty much the only white person in my office who wears a mask when I am sick. People come in and cough all over the place. I work with a lot of Vietnamese and they are the only other ones who wear a mask.
Endarial,fdqviyk,t1_fdqfte0,"I live in Taiwan and seeing someone wear a mask like that is just as common as someone not wearing one. Sadly, the air pollution can get rather bad. 

 I work with children and most of my students wear masks all day long. 

Heck, there have been times when I thought I had a new student simply because I didn't recognize him without his mask on."

Enralis,fdr3ypr,t1_fdqfulf,"I wore one when I had a common cold on a US flight. Lady beside me freaked out and demanded to change seats, she probably thought I had swine flu or who knows what. Anyways, she ended up sitting beside a guy who was openly sick. I even told her it was just a cold...I'm just trying to be polite and keep my coughs to myself...so yeah, I don't wear masks here anymore."
gene100001,fdqpuy5,t1_fdqpjmh,That's true. Also in areas where its not common the social stigma of standing out and looking weird is a enough to put most people off. I definitely wouldn't want to walk around in town with a facemask when no one else had one.
tru7hhimself,fdr1fja,t1_fdqpjmh,over here the conservaties fully embraced the anti-islam sentiment of extreme right wing parties and made wearing a burka or niqab illegal. as a result wearing face-masks is now also illegal (the law would be unconstitutional if it only affected religios headwear).
gene100001,fdrgfmn,t1_fdr3ypr,That lady sounds like an idiot. Good for you for being conscientious
gene100001,fdqpk15,t1_fdqjqye,"People wear masks in different countries for a whole multitude of reasons. The main reasons vary between different countries. 

When you say selflessness doesn't exist over there are you referring to all of Asia? An area with 4.463 billion people? 

You should go travelling a bit, and try and experience some different cultures. Then you'll realise that humans are the same everywhere. Selflessness is a human trait as much as selfishness. Foreign countries with different cultures and different languages aren't the boogeyman. It's generally best to avoid generalising people's traits. Every individual human is complex and unique"

Here in the US it’s not as acceptable because of all the racist fucks who see other races with a mask and get suspicious and wonder what they’re hiding. THEY’RE HIDING GERMS!!!

Several people at Mass thanked me for being considerate, when I explained the reason for the mask. 
Why would people automatically assume that the young man was a K-pop star just because he had a mask on? Here in the US, especially the larger cities, most medical facilities require employees, who do not get a flu shot, to wear face masks in the building during the entire flu season. This is to keep the unvaccinated from spreading the flu to unvaccinated patients and since it's embarrassing, many decide to get the flu shot rather than walk around with the mask for approximately 6 months."

In the Philippines, there’s a vehicle called a “jeepney” made out (or inspired from) military vehicles used during World War 2.

And now we’re finding it hard to replace that with modern and efficient transport vehicles because people defend that “it’s part of our culture now”.

So part of the pollution is actually these under-maintained vehicles running about the cities.

Well, that and some people’s utter disregard for proper waste disposal."

MattyGroch,fdlt0br,t1_fdlhvmd,"They literally have no means of dealing with sub-freezing weather. No sand, no salt. If there's 5 snowflakes on hilly roads, nobody goes anywhere.

insultin_crayon,fdm6hk3,t1_fdlhvmd,My junior year of high school we got out of a full week of school just based off of the prediction of snow. It didn't snow once.
hellokitty1939,fdlwoyh,t1_fdlhvmd,It wasn't just the five snowflakes -- it was also cold! Really really cold.  Can the lunch ladies make tater tots when it's that cold outside? Or cheese grits? No one knows.  Better not take a chance.
jbl066,fdlqu82,t1_fdlhvmd,Yes we are!
LittleWhiteBoots,fdmaxhn,t1_fdlhvmd,I lived in Houston and they canceled school for ice. Was legit too- roads were frozen like a mofo. Busses couldn’t get to school.
DayMan4224,fdn5txr,t1_fdlhvmd,"I grew up outside Seattle and it's the same thing, got half an inch of snow or more and it was canceled.

POTUS,fdm53qg,t1_fdlt0br,"[This](https://i.imgur.com/GiHLyDK.jpg) really happened in North Carolina just a couple years ago.  It's like 3 or 4 inches of snow.  I've heard several unrelated first hand accounts of people that were backed up on the highways for 4 hours in other parts of town.

This is what happens when nobody has snow tires, the roads aren't effectively treated, and it snows in the middle of a work day."
taranathesmurf,fdlont0,t1_fdloie1,This was an urban area so no dirt roads. We were born and raised in the Pacific Northwest so believe me we know rain. LOL

taranathesmurf,fdn6nw5,t1_fdn5txr,I also live in the greater Seattle area and I agree an inch or so of snow can cause havoc. However I still say 5 snowflakes is no reason to cancel school. :)
cold_sphagetti,fdm86s9,t1_fdm53qg,I know what you mean. I’ve lived in nc my whole life when I was young back in the 90’s it took at least 5 or 6 inches before we had school get canceled. I remember having snowball fights at the boss stop. But once I got into high school in the early 00’s a lot of kids were getting into wrecks when it was a little icy in the morning so they started getting more cautious about it. But since my kids started school about 4 years ago if there is a chance of snow they’ll cancel school for at least a day and have a 2 hour delay the next morning. And they get a shit ton of half days. Only way I gotta half day was of I skipped school at lunch and walked home
insultin_crayon,fdm6pz8,t1_fdm695j,"Great idea! Let's raise taxes In all cities, towns, and counties in low-risk snowfall areas so that they can keep an arsenal of plows and salt around, and maintain those plows, and pay the workers who do so, just in case it snows this year. You're a genius for thinking of this."
BigHipDoofus,fdm6wmt,t1_fdm695j,Or just stay put except for emergency equipment. A whole city's worth of snow plows and sanding trucks that get used every third year is a pretty bad investment.
Bumbly_B,fdm5hnt,t1_fdm4eel,"Yeah but that also means that people there know how to drive in the snow and have appropriate means of doing so, like snow tires, snow chains, roads that are actually drivable in cold weather conditions, etc. I'm from the American south, and the reason we cancel school for this stuff is that literally nobody is prepared for it because we have almost no reason to be."
twopinkgiraffes,fdm6ybk,t1_fdm6pz8,It snows multiple times every year where I live.  And every year they say it’s unusual.  It isn’t. Every year multiple cars go off the road because “we don’t know how to drive in snow” when all that’s required is have decent tires and not drive like a moron.  Not snow tires.  Not chains.  Just don’t be stupid.

Anywhoo... one morning, I woke up, and heard that the elementary school was going to have chicken nuggets, and fruit cups. I thought as I woke “wow!, I kinda love me some huggy nuggies...”

lilclairecaseofbeer,fdwfcw9,t1_fduq01i,"I guess the first part is but she's just factually incorrect about super bugs. For context I'm not an epidemiologist, I'm a biology student, but vaccines can essentially eliminate a disease if done well enough. We have essentially eliminated rabies on some islands, and I say essentially because we cannot literally test every single wild animal, however when there has been zero cases year after year the location is considered rabies free. Super bugs or antibiotic/treatment resistant bacteria is much more complicated and has been caused by multiple errors on our part in how we have handled antibiotics. You can find antibiotic resistant bacteria in hospitals because that's the prime environment for them to evolve a resistance, it's where patients are receiving long heavy doses of IV antibiotics. Bacteria form a resistance through exposure, and they are also being exposed in places where we manufacture antibiotics and aren't disposing of the factory waste responsibly. The surrounding water of these factories is filled with multiple antibiotics and becomes a soup for the bacteria to evolve a resistance."
DiscardedWetNap,fdxxmfd,t1_fduq01i,Also we dont know if they have kids👀😂
DaPrincePlays,fdwxon4,t1_fdutkwa,I mean she's right to worry about super bugs but that's more on our liberal use of antibiotics for EVERYTHING and not vaccines.
Harlequinn38,fdutwzu,t1_fdutkwa,Logically they somewhat are in a way
didyoudissmycheese,fdy6hx3,t1_fdutkwa,Right. Vaccines are actually one of our most effective tools for fighting the creation of superbugs. Its gonna be the unvaccinated people who overuse antibiotics and create superbugs because they're gonna be the ones who get sick.
DaPrincePlays,fdwxv7c,t1_fdwfcw9,Isn't superbugs also a result of improper use of antibiotics? Not using it fully when prescribed?
lilclairecaseofbeer,fdxo831,t1_fdwxv7c,"Yes, you should always take the entire regime prescribed because through experience we know what antibiotics at what concentrations and for how long are effective at killing what bacteria. The kicker is you would likely get better in the same amount of time with or without them, that is if you are otherwise a healthy individual. However I'm not a doctor, please consult yours. Another issue is prescribing antibiotics for viral infections, which happens when someone presents with symptoms that fit multiple illnesses but no test is done to confirm a bacterial infection and antibiotics are prescribed just in case. These ""just in case"" antibiotics have their place, like when undergoing surgery, however when dealing with low risk diseases, like a sore throat, it becomes overkill."
Krowerl,fdwzpno,t1_fdwxv7c,"that's literally what he/she said smh

For those of you who don't understand /u/lilclairecaseofbeer 's text or how resistance works in bacteria (high school level explanation):

\-> Bacteria infects person, person shows symptoms and takes antibiotics

\-> Little by little, the bacteria gets killed by drug A as the patient takes their medication

\-> By some stroke of luck (if you're rooting for the bacterium) or unluckiness (if you're rooting for humanity) one of the bacteria causing the infection however has a mutation (this happens at random and can't be predicted or stopped - it's literally just evolution) and isn't affected by drug A

\-> All bacteria's friends are being killed = no competition for the resistant bacteria for food

\-> Resistant bacteria thrives even as patient takes drug A (because drug A has no effect and the patient may as well be drinking water or using essential oils)

\-> Resistant bacteria now spreads to other people (though coughing, not washing hands etc. causing this resistant bacteria to spread)

\-> Doctors try a stronger antibiotic/ drug - drug B

\-> Rinse and repeat cycle until you have bacterium resistant to the strongest drugs known to man

This is worrying because it means humanity will go back to an age predating antibiotics - a time when a simple cut could become infected and kill you. It'd mean things like vaccinations could kill you (piercing of your skin is a big danger).

Already the first antibiotic Penicillin (discovered less than a century ago) is proven to become less effective against bacteria. (1 example of a source:  [http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/10/01/antibiotic.penicillin.resistance/](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/10/01/antibiotic.penicillin.resistance/) )

mustapelto,fduw52q,t1_fduowgt,"You got the basic idea right but there's some things I'd like to correct.

First, antibiotics don't kill viruses (those are not really alive to begin with), they kill bacteria. Which causes a selection effect as you said.

There are antiviral drugs, but those work only against specific viruses and are completely useless against the vast majority.

Second, vaccines don't kill anything. They teach the body how to fight off a disease on its own. So without vaccines, more people would get sick and spread the disease around. I don't know if preventing *that* really leads to a selection effect, and I'm too tired to open up PubMed right now, but it would be interesting to find out."

ManikShamanik,fduwzy2,t1_fduowgt,"This really is a VERY stupid  and ignorant comment. Care to explain how antibiotics  - which are ONLY effective against BACTERIA  - cause viral mutation...? A drug which kills viruses is known as an antiviral.

Secondly, if vaccines cause superbugs, then please explain why smallpox hasn't mutated (it was declared extinct in 1980 - that's 40 years ago)...?

Thirdly, viruses DO NOT replicate via mitosis, mitosis is a biological process and viruses aren't alive. Mitosis is the division of a cell's nucleus and a virus can only reproduce once its infected a cell, viruses cannot replicate without a host. Please don't use words if you don't know what they mean.

Idk the whole concept of a monarchy is lost on me to begin with, but I don’t understand why anyone would blame them for wanting to lead somewhat normal, un-royal lives.

Also—more related to the headline—I’ve had three kids. Your hands naturally gravitate to your stomach in the last 3-4 months bc there is a DAMN BASKETBALL on your stomach. It’s uncomfortable and it MOVES. your hands just gravitate there. Why would that ever be a problem for anyone."

Why?  Because the royals know what an unnatural con they have going on.  They know that they are anachronistic parasites and they only exist because enough of the public supports the nostalgia/tradition aspect of the scam.

If one of the flock flies off to make their own way, people may start to wonder why *all* of them don't just get a job and take care of themselves?

The only job the queen and co. have is to maintain the status quo so that people don't start wondering why they put up with them."

allusernamestaken57,fdyhy0i,t3_encovo,This always pissed me off. I would stroke my bump without even realising it. I even did it once i found out i was pregnant and didn't even have a bump yet. I personally don't know a pregnant woman that hasn't held their bump at some point. It's natural and a comfort. Yet they try and make out she's doing it for attention. It's ridiculous.

somethingfunnyiguess,fdzc3tk,t1_fdz7deu,"It's barely veiled racism in an already disgusting tabloid culture. They will say absolutely ridiculous stuff about white people too, obviously, but the fact she is a half black American makes it way easier. She was previously divorced so they basically call her a skank, because divorce is some rare thing now. Her white dad is a deadbeat who has sold out to the press, but because she doesn't support him she has 'abandoned her family.' Even though she was already wealthy and successful when they met they accused her of basically being a gold digger out for his money and title. People on twitter refer to her as ""Harry's first wife"" and are now somehow offended that they want to step back a bit and do their own thing."

swiftzy3,fe1glkl,t1_fdzu7dd,"We're too busy to care tbh.

Tho saying they want to step back whilst still keep their taxpayer benefits is a bit rich (private villa, security, flights etc) and I'd rather they abdicate properly.

They have plenty of money from private sources, Harry is worth about £30mil from their estate.

It seems they want to keep the lifestyle but currently can't afford it."

As for the Kardashians, they've built a diversified portfolio of multi million dollar businesses from what started as a sex tape. If you really think a sex tape is enough to make you known and wealthy, try releasing one and see if you can spin that into the level of wealth they've attained.

I had them all believing it was an secret that adults kept from kids.  If you could find the anchor line, you could cut it and you could move the island around.  We lived near a large lake with several small islands, and they all got excited because they wanted to go find these lines.   

One of them told their teacher this amazing ""fact"" and that they were in on the big secret, when recess was over.  I got called to the principal's office, and told not to do stuff like that anymore.  The principal admitted it was pretty funny though.  

This was a really small elementary school out in the sticks.  The principal also taught one of the 6th grade classes.  Assignments were done alphabetically and I should have been in the other 6th grade class the next year.  I ended up in his, which I was really unhappy out about, because he had a reputation for being really hard.

I asked him why I was in his class instead of the other one, where I was supposed to be.  He told me that he didnt know if I was going to be a criminal mastermind, or go on to do great things, and he wanted to make sure he nudged me in the right direction.  He turned out to be an amazing teacher, and was easily one of  the best I ever had."

Jackbot92,fe9kzkq,t3_eo3wun,"We can predict how gravity behaves, and that's why it's a law; however, we don't know _why_ it behaves like that, and that comes down to theories. So, flat earthers just jump to the conclusion that everything that concerns gravity is a theory."
ManikShamanik,fea96wx,t1_fe9kzkq,"Nope. A scientific law is a succinct way of saying that if this set of conditions is constant then this will always be true. A scientific law is always expressed as a formula (e.g. Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation is usually written thus: F(orce) = G(ravitational constant) x m¹ x m² (masses of objects)/r² (where r is the objects' rotational centres). 

In words: every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what Isaac Newton called inductive reasoning. (From Wikipedia). 

The formula will remain true unless one of the constants changes. That's a scientific law. 

A scientific theory is an attempt to describe a factual phenomenon based on what we currently know, and theories change constantly as we learn more about the world, laws change too, but far less frequently (Newton's law described above was largely replaced by Einstein's law of general relativity - but it took almost 300 years!)"
knightstick2,fea29fu,t1_fe9kzkq,"Yeah, we do know why it behaves the way it does. It’s a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by the uneven distribution of mass."

knightstick2,fea5qxh,t1_fea44ti,"Yes, it is “the general theory of relativity,” more accurately how it describes gravity, but this is a scientific theory we are talking about.

Neomancer5000,fdj9ceg,t3_elieom,In India uber already does that like if they feel your too drunk or might puke the drivers will straight up refuse you which in a sense I have to agree cuz I had a few bad drunk scenes that I ain't proud of so can't blame them

hydroflsksdontsvetrt,fdiicle,t3_elieom,I think this is in response to this thing that was revealed about Uber. Apparently a couple of Uber drives preyed on drunk people. Like they would pick people up from clubs and if they found out they were drunk then they would take advantage of them.

Unicorntacoz,fdj2cde,t3_elieom,"It makes sense in cases where people who are half drunk drop off their one friend to be driven who is so plastered they can't even walk or function to get into an Uber by themselves. The driver can't take them, they can't be expected to have to also deliver the person from the car to their establishment if they pass out, or are just being difficult removing themselves from the car. Instances where people are far too drunk to communicate or behave have ended up where they're assaulted by the driver, or vice versa. I mean, yeah, it completely defeats the purpose because the entire purpose of Uber is to safely take people who shouldn't or can't drive to their destination safely. But it's also caused a lot of issues both on the drivers and on the passengers side."

Dakzoo,feakp1b,t1_feak0sl,Not quite the same. Not getting tipped or being disrespected is one thing. People being amazed that you don’t work for free or offering “exposure” is different.
66GT350Shelby,fe9jmqe,t1_fe9h58m,"Several times.  And I tell them it will look like pine.  There's a reason why good quality hardwood is expensive, it looks great and holds up better.

The thing is, I have nothing against pine, fir or poplar.  They can look really good for certain styles, and are more than adequate for a lot of stuff.  I'm currently making a coffee table from pine, because my client wants it to look rustic and aged.  

I'm not going to waste maple on something that is going to get painted, scuffed up, weathered and antiqued."
noshoptime,fe9l6nb,t1_fe9jmqe,"One of the biggest issues for us with pine is it's such a pain in the ass to get a good finish. Also it dings up so easily, and like to crumble instead of cut. Even with expensive wood our cost was mostly labor, so the funny part was that going pine is hustling backwards, lol.  And of course there's the factor of ""no, I won't make a highboy out of pine"".  We did make some pine pieces, but always appropriate for pine, and usually ""distressed"""
66GT350Shelby,fe9xo47,t1_fe9l6nb,"Yeah, pine is a pain to finish, and especially a PITA to stain properly.  I usually use shellac if it isnt getting the county/rustic look.  I got some nice 6/4 pine boards for next to nothing while grabbing some other lumber several months back.  My issue is, it's still got sap pockets I found when I milled it, and it had been sitting around drying for a few years

This table is getting a few coats of sanding sealer and that's it.  My customer wants to do the rest of it herself to match the other pieces she has.  I've been to her house several times, she's actually pretty good at it."
noshoptime,fea1i2o,t1_fe9xo47,"With pine I always shellac it.  I just don't trust finish to adhere to it properly long term, I've seen too many times where it lifted and bubbled up later. I never want a piece coming back because of a finishing failure. My neighbor has a pine floor where almost all of the finish is gone now because it lifted and then just peeled off"

BlackPhoenix123,fdpw2il,t1_fdkmef5,"Thanks its just that when the sperm cell fertilizes the egg the tail (which has mitochondria DNA) falls off. This is so because mitochondria DNA only makes up 1 percent if the human's DNA. If the father's mitochondria DNA were to be passed down it would result in mitochondria disease resulting in the failure of aerobic respiration. Also, the sperm cells DNA in the tail will be heavily used and damaged by the time it reaches the ovaries. This is because of the acidic nature of the vagina and the white blood cells designed to attack foreign cells. If you had both of your parents respiration DNA then you would simply have 2 percent mitochondria DNA resulting in an overdose which is extremely bad as it messes with a very important life process one that you cannot simply live without."

No sane human is going to join that cluster fuck of hate when there are actual groups fighting for equality, fighting against the damage feminism is doing daily. 

The only reason anyone has to join that gangbang of hate is if they feel that women need revenge rather than equality, and they want to hide that behind the idea that only women are victims and need special treatment.

Feminism has had what, 4 years of agressive popularity and their members have already fucked it beyond repair.

IanMc90,fe1y8go,t1_fdywyxw,"Just because a few lunatics have decided to use a label doesn't change the definition of what that movement started as. It's an equal rights movement that started with women's suffrage. Go read a book, I'd recommend something in the history section."
IanMc90,fe1zotv,t1_fdyxpvq,"Christ almighty, do you think women have some sort of organized ""feminist"" government that's secretly plotting to steal your rights?! You seem to think there is some sort of sign-up and organized membership or something.

This makes you sound like a deluded paranoid. I don't want to be mean or make you feel bad, but you should really take a look at where this is coming from. People are people. Most people have their own shit to go through. Most people are middle of the road and just want everyone to have a good life and be happy. To be blinded by this misguided hatred for no reason is sad and completely counter productive to any sort of happiness you could ever hope to find. 

I understand that some crazy people call themselves ""feminists"", but not all feminists are misandrists, the same way as not all straight white men are ""incels"". People need to take a fucking breath and calm the fuck down about these labels and start reading some history about how the wealthy like to sow discord amongst the poor huddled masses. Its shit like this that let's billionaires keep stealing our economy, while we're distracted arguing about what the word ""feminist"" means? You're all deluded. Our problems are caused by wealth disparity, not women."
YooGeOh,fdyzeun,t1_fdl23gx,"Egalitarianism is not specific to gender. Correct. This is why people prefer it. 

If feminism *IS* specific to gender then it cannot at the same time claim to be about equal rights. At best it's a movement for women's rights whilst not really being about men's rights. If it was about equal rights then it would encompass mens rights too."
Phrygue,fdlhic7,t1_fdl23gx,You can still judge beliefs.  Thinking egalitarianism means all viewpoints are equally valid is stupid.
AssholeMcMiniFridge,fe3a7qr,t1_fe1zotv,"If women could functionally organize anything I doubt their movement would he the cesspit it is.

Personally, idgaf what you or anyone think. From what I've seen its us vs them, and i choose the us part of that. 

I have no intention of risking my rights to a group of people who couldn't give two shits about me or mine. Idc if I'm right or wrong, fuck them. We'll do that shit right on our end."
Seattleguy1979,fdz32d4,t1_fdyzeun,"So you agree that egalitarianism would fight for communism?

As far as feminism goes, which men's rights would you like them to fight for that men don't have? Most civil rights movements especially in the US are fighting for their demographic to have the rights that have always been deemed unalienable for wealthy white men.

This is why people talk about ""black lives matter"" because no one has suggested that white lives don't matter.  Similarly,  no one needs to fight for ""men's rights"" because no one has ever suggested men shouldn't have those rights."
Seattleguy1979,fdlvzlz,t1_fdlhic7,No.  I think egalitarianism means all people should be treated as equals.  That is in fact the definition of communism. Communists believe that all people should be treated equally financially and economically. Capitalism views differing types of labor and people as deserving more or less resources in return for their effort.
Alexmitter,fe1l738,t1_fdz32d4,"I don't know why you believe this bullshit, but it was never even a question that men should have the same right of being save from genitalia mutilation as females, I don't see feminist fighting for equality here, but I see them playing it down or denying it."
YooGeOh,fe2ruk2,t1_fdz32d4,"Why do redditors always assume that all other redditors are white males? Always the far left types making this assumption as well. Seems like some kind of benevolent racism to me...

Anyway, to your point. 

>""So you agree egalitarianism would fight for communism"".

Please show me where I implied or inferred this in my comment about people preferring an idea that fights for the rights of both genders over the rights of one...

As for ""rights"", I think the use of this word is a misnomer in both MRA movements and white western feminist movements. There are no ""rights"" that either gender legally has over the other (unless you include the right to not be required to conscript for national service, or the right to not have their genitals mutilated at birth). Anyone with a brain knows it's more nuanced than ""rights"". Its about the equal treatment of the genders in employment, society, legally etc. This fight is relevant for both genders as both genders suffer from unequal treatment in society in separate ways, despite neither gender having any more nor any less ""rights"" than the other. If you really think that in society there are NO male specific issues worth discussing (all the while white western third wave feminism claims to be the answer to all the issues men face, whilst doing so through a female lens and ignoring male perspective; even feminism acknowledges the issues even if going about dealing with them in not the best way), then you're either being intellectually dishonest, or are just blind to how society works.

No there are no rights that women have that men have. Similarly, in the western world at least, there are no rights that men have that women don't."

As long as the father can show proof of the visitation order (as in has his divorce papers/custody agreement in hand) there’s nothing the mother can do. The officer will make her release the child into the father’s custody.

Taking phones away make no difference you can have an I pod, a tablet,  hell even a watch. Computers exists laptops you can research on all of these things you can communicate in many different ways. Home phones exists, letters, notes all of these are forms of communication. He’s restricting things accessible to the internet but he’s pinning it all on cell phones. This isn’t about addiction it’s about access to the internet being restricted via cell phone. 

It’s not just young people either it’s people of all ages. You go to a college campus and look around just about every class room has something to do with cell phones, tablets, etc. Going forward the point of making cell phones age restricted items is senseless and saying it’s for addiction when the article is listing the reasons as to why he wants them to be restricted makes no sense.

He is a Democrat, the party should have kicked him out. He is wasting time and money.

Moreover, from his Wikipedia : ""Rogers is personally opposed to abortion"". 

Sometimes politicians join a party simply because they consider it to be the party most likely to give them access to power, regardless of their ideology.  
It is time to do some cleaning up within the Democratic Party in order to preserve a semblance of integrity and block these hypocrites who have nothing to do in politics. 

The good news is that he doesn't have much time left to harm the society. He is 79 years old.

We have the same kind of politicians everywhere.

ClarkWGrizzball,fdi210z,t1_fdhp5c1,">One of the primary differences is in the chemical compound used to create each drug. Adderall is a mix of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine salts. Methamphetamine is double methylated phenylethylamine. The double methylation of the chemical process when creating methamphetamines allows the drug to be lipid soluble. This term means that the chemicals used in methamphetamines are able to cross what is called the blood brain barrier. This cross of the barrier allows the chemicals to negatively affect the brain cells and tissue of the individual who is using the substance.  
>  
>Adderall studies have shown improved social and cognitive abilities in those who are prescribed the drug. Students with ADHD who take Adderall as prescribed by their physician have be seen to have more self-control, focus, exhibit a slight increase in IQ, and improved relationships with family and friends. Methamphetamines, on the other hand, showed a decrease in these areas after prolonged use.

pillbinge,fdkx5hj,t1_fdkgwkb,"That's a commonly cited number but there's more nuance to it. But that is correct.

For one, Norman-French is Norman-French, or Middle French a lot of the times. A lot of those words sometimes aren't even used in French, so some words are uniquely English. It would be like comparing Norse to Norwegian sometimes, though that's a bigger stretch. **Then** the words get traded at different times to other languages.

Also, European languages share roots by way of the Proto-Indo European stems - the language (or languages) that came with settlers to Europe. There are some words in English and Latin that are basically the same even though they came about organically and by chance. But not even really ""chance"" because there are almost unrecognizable roots they stem from. I think the words ""eye"" and ""oculus"" come from that same root.

Then there's the fact that every language often adopts Greek, Latin, and therefore French words. The word ""irony"" is used in every European language I've studied. It might be written like ""ironia"" or something but it's the same idea. The word ""ticket"" comes from Middle French, but the modern French word ""billet"" is what Norwegians use, but with an extra T. So ""ticket"" and ""billett"" are worlds apart, but Norwegians use the modern French word and we use the old one. And there's even more to that word, as apparently it comes from the word ""etiquette"" (that bit I just learned).

[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ticket#English](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ticket#English)

So English isn't totally unique. A lot of scientific words are also based on Greek or Latin. I was taught about 10% of scientific language is English but the rest is Latin. Not sure about other languages. ""Input"" is an English combination of ""in"" and ""put"", obviously, but you input data (Latin) into a computer (Latin).

Finally, distribution counts. In science, you'll use a lot of Latin words. This can be helpful for transferring knowledge a long time ago but is sort of moot now. But academics have always been well traveled and worldly. Even the Greeks talked highly of many African scholars and learned from them. But in nearly every language, the most frequent words are local. The top 100 used English words are English, traceable back to Old English. Same with many other languages, though the form varies. You only need about 2,000 to 5,000 to communicate basically and the more words you learn, the higher the chance the word won't be ""local"" entirely. Not 0% though."

As for the use of French words in Europe, there was the mega power thing, but also it seemed French sounded sophisticated to people who started using words from the language, maybe to appear more than they were since it was already heavily used in the artistocracy."
pillbinge,fdkb8qx,t1_fdkapt2,"It was tied to power. There were Russian aristocrats who spoke no Russian, like how the language of the courts in England after 1066 shifted to Norman-French as well. Therefore it became a class thing. Since educated people wanted to emulate the Greeks/Latin later, it basically led to doubling down. Not uniformly, interestingly. If you look at German, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, and Frisian for example, we use a lot of similar words. And if the words aren’t similar, sometimes the same concepts. Sometimes all but one language uses the same sort of root too. Like the word persuade in English but überzeugen in German, overtale in Norwegian, and overtuigen in Dutch. English is usually the odd man out but not always. They’re all prepositions smushed together with some form of “talk”. The word persuade is the same way with the same concepts, but Latin in root.

As for the term “high concept”, you have to think back to previous times. Passports weren’t universal back then. A lot of words like “vote” weren’t in everyone’s vocabulary when people couldn’t actually vote. They aren’t high frequency words, basically. You could live in a country as a foreigner without needing to use some of those words."
KeeRinO,fdkc84k,t1_fdkb8qx,"Interesting, you've got knowledge in languages. What do you do?

Would you say that amongst Germanic languages English has been more influenced by French and Latin than Dutch, Swedish, German etc. ?

The ""persuade"" exemple is interesting, clearly come from ""persuader"" in French, but the concept of it is completely different from Germanic language with their ""over"" part. German classes are far behind so I don't remember much of the language, but the Norwegian version is interesting ""overtale"", maybe I'm talking out of my ass but sounds like ""over tale"" in English, which I would interpret as having a better ""tale""."
pillbinge,fdkzo58,t1_fdkc84k,"Buckle up, because you're hitting on a topic I love.

I'm a teacher but that's not relevant. This is just a fascination of mine, and it mainly concerns English, Scandinavian, and Germanic languages. I like linguistics but this is just a sort of side interest of mine. I'm not authority but I do look into these things.

It's hard to say what English has been influenced most by because you can't put a number to it. The Old English plural for ""books"" was ""beek"", just like ""foot"" and ""feet"". Norse gave us an ending to make things plural instead. Cow is English for the animal, but we call the meat ""beef"" because aristocrats spoke French and only called the meat that. Norwegian calls meat ""kjøtt"" and ham ""svinekjøtt"". We call it ""pork"" after the French word, but Norwegian is literally ""pigmeat"".

The thing about English's French influence is that it comes largely from Middle French, not always modern French. Our word ""ticket"" comes from Middle French, but modern French people say ""billet"". Norwegian calls tickets ""billett"", so Norwegian takes the French word but from hundreds of years apart. Funny how that words.

English is often called a sort of mutt, and it is, but not really. It's influenced by its neighbors, like literally every language on Earth. England just happens to be an island in the middle of so many countries in Europe, so that if you drew straight lines you could hit almost every country over the water. Consequently, it's been invaded a ton as well. Most people don't know that the Danes ruled over Great Britain for around 200 years. Weird right? Or that it's called **Great** Britain because it's bigger than Little Britain, which is the region of France known as Brittany.

And most interestingly, a lot of languages use English now. I think that's debasing to their languages, but honestly, it's a natural thing. ""Oh my god"" and ""fuck"" get said a lot but kind of like how we might say ""merci"" or ""gracias"".

As for ""persuade"", it really isn't that different. All European languages come from the Proto-Indo European language. Or PIE. ""Persuade"" is one word to you, but it comes from the words ""through"" and ""advise"". To advise through someone, basically. But we see it as one concept. So it's not that different from using a preposition like ""over"" before a word like ""talk"".

(Note: not all etymologies online are the same. You sometimes do have to do research and it's tough figuring out old, dead languages and dialects).

The word ""tale"" is shared amongst German languages to mean ""talk"" in some way. English is one of those languages. Basic concepts tend to stick around. ""Tala"" in Norse means ""to talk"". That's what ""tale"" or ""tale"" in Scandinavian languages has to do with talking. The word in English means a story, right, but these were people who spoke stories. We just used the word a bit differently, which is really common to. Otherwise we'd all speak the same language. But then ""avtale"" in Norwegian means ""agreement"".

You have to remember that languages don't really evolve in vacuum. About 1,500 years ago, a lot of people in Northern Germany and Scandinavia spoke a very similar language. Basically dialects. The Angles and the Saxons gave us English. That's why English is Anglo-Saxon. The closest language to English is actually Frisian, a language spoken in the Netherlands as a minor language.

Small precision for what you said about ticket and billet : we use both (sorry don't know if you realised I was French) which is kind of funny, the word ticket had to go from estiquet (I just researched the etymology) to the english ticket, to be used again in France.
Difference is ticket would be used for public transportation for instance, ""un ticket de métro"", ""un ticket de bus"" or entries to museum and public places. Billet is used for money, or bigger size tickets, like ""billet pou un concert"", ""un billet de 50€"". 
There's also the expression ""j'ai un ticket avec elle"" or any variant of this ahah, meaning something like ""She's interested in me"".

For the Noardwestgermaanske talen, I would guess it means something like ""germanic languages of the north west""? (see your teacher condition is relevant, I felt back at school with that question).

Thanks for taking the time to dispense a bit of knowledge. I'm a very curious person, and every opportunity to learn something is welcome."
pillbinge,fdod1l5,t1_fdmnyou,"That's really interesting - thanks for the clarification. My delve into etymologies isn't the same as really learning any language (I suppose unless I know it already) so I had no idea you had two words for ticket. But you get the gist of it, and really that's what so interesting. These aren't foreign concepts, just dots you wouldn't think of connecting. The average person doesn't even really think about this stuff and yet we're always coming up with nuance and new words.

And yes, Noardwestgermaanske talen literally means ""North West German Languages"". Wikipedia has it as North Sea Germanic but they're just using other words for the same concept. But it's clear Frisian is close enough.

I didn't think you were French though. Reddit serves as a sort of filter because it's mainly an English site, so I just presumed you didn't know the area. That's my bad. So you might very well know about Frisian. At least for Americans and even other people in Europe, they have no idea about other native languages of Europe. Maybe Catalan, but not usually not langues d'oïl or Occitan, or similar ones."
KeeRinO,fdq0xjy,t1_fdod1l5,"No problem, the fact you didn't think I was French means my English isn't bad, so I'll take it as a compliment \^\^

I had never heard of Frisian before, so you taught me something. Even if I'm curious, I don't know much about languages origins except the basic stuff although once in a while i'll look up the etymology of a word, its use in other countries etc. 

Interesting thing, talking about Occitan, I'm from the south, so we still have some words in our everyday language that come directly from Occitan and aren't really used in the northern part of the country. That's something I love, realising that people from the nord might not understand some things I say and the other way around. That's true of some expressions mostly, like ""ça daille"" that's typically said in Bordeaux and means ""it sucks"", or a ""drôle"" that can be used to say ""child"" but only means ""funny"" for the rest of the country. 

Don't know if that falls in the same category, but there's also the great war of ""chocolatine"" vs ""pain au chocolat"", two different names for a pastry, the right one being of course ""chocolainte"" :p"

chloroxyde,feb30x9,t1_fe9zwje,Haha this reminds me of the first time I tried shrimp tempura - I thought the entire thing was edible - including the tail and I was really embarrassed when my mom asked what the hell I was doing lol
avaughan11,feayjt5,t1_fe9zwje,"In a shrimp boil, I can understand leaving the shells on while cooking, but when I go to a restaurant there’s nothing I hate more than getting a dish with shrimp in it that hasn’t been peeled or deveined. I don’t want to dig through my pasta and peel off shells for ten minutes before I can eat it. I feel like it’s laziness on the kitchen staff’s part."
chi_lennon,feabksm,t1_fea6lsk,I’m an idiot too. But the shrimps still tasted good tho.

Marknificence,feagkbn,t1_feadj6h,"Nothing wrong with that. As someone who's been consuming shrimp for the last 30yrs, I've eaten it with and without the shell on. It all depends on how lazy I am at the time"
0o_hm,feb8l1j,t1_feayjt5,"I think it's a misguided attempt at presentation. The dish does look better with the whole shrimp. But you're right, it's fucking ridiculous to expect your customers to start off their meal by digging their hands into their fucking dish and peel shells off. Also the flavour from the shells should be in the dish, but you can peel them and cook that into a both to incorporate it."
curious--owl,febrhht,t1_feabksm,#You’re supposed to remove the shell?!?!
avaughan11,febd61c,t1_feb85z0,"I don’t eat mussels or oysters because I don’t care for them, and crab and lobster would depend on the dish. I don’t mind peeling shrimp when it’s cooked like in a shrimp boil and is plated by itself. But when it’s mixed into a dish, like with pasta, I expect it to be peeled first. I would expect a pasta dish with crab or lobster to be shelled first, too.

Also, I’m not sure why you put staff in quotation marks, like I said something derogatory. That’s exactly what employees working in the kitchen area of a restaurant would be. Kitchen staff. Just like there would be a wait staff, a bar staff, and usually a hostess."
Marknificence,febhmds,t1_febd61c,Tails are usually kept on to keep the shrimp from curling into itself as they cook.
YellowBreakfast,febjhwe,t1_febd61c,"I just found it funny, though you were correct. Normally people call the ones who prepare their food ""cooks"" or ""chefs"".

And I should clarify, they should be de-veined either way. 

You're not wrong, it's work to peel those as the diner and sometimes a pain. 

The peel just gives a better quality to the shrimp. I also feel the shell helps to keep the shrimp from drying out and getting rubbery.

In spite of the negatives, I prefer them cooked shell on."

crlcan81,fdiqv6r,t3_eljt9g,"From the same story, that I saw on NPR as well:  ""Some tests ... use a single tube of a chemical called cobalt  thiocyanate, which turns blue when it is exposed to cocaine. But cobalt  thiocyanate also turns blue when it is exposed to more than 80 other  compounds, including methadone, certain acne medications and several  common household cleaners. Other tests use three tubes, which the  officer can break in a specific order to rule out everything but the  drug in question — but if the officer breaks the tubes in the wrong  order, that, too, can invalidate the results. The environment can also  present problems. Cold weather slows the color development; heat speeds  it up, or sometimes prevents a color reaction from taking place at all."" Also here's the entire article I read: [https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/16/558147669/florida-man-awarded-37-500-after-cops-mistake-glazed-doughnut-crumbs-for-meth](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/16/558147669/florida-man-awarded-37-500-after-cops-mistake-glazed-doughnut-crumbs-for-meth)  


From what I can tell on the story these cops aren't using the tests as the company intended anyways, as the story outright says, and I quote:  

The Safariland Group, which makes the NIK tests, told ProPublica that  it provides all law enforcement agencies with comprehensive field test  training manuals, in addition to its instructions, and says its products  are not intended for use other than directed.

""These training  materials, which outline protocols for use, clearly state that the tests  are presumptive aids that serve only as confirmation of probable cause  and are not a substitute for laboratory testing,"" the company wrote in a statement: [https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2939743-Safarilandgroup-Fullstatement.html](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2939743-Safarilandgroup-Fullstatement.html)"
AngelOfLight,fdixq0x,t3_eljt9g,Probably because the roadside drug detection kits are so horribly inaccurate that the cop could literally toss a coin and have fewer false positives.
MuffetLover9001,fdimsj9,t3_eljt9g,What...
Deadthrowaway164,fdiq6h4,t3_eljt9g,they just wanted their doughnuts.
crlcan81,fdir74s,t3_eljt9g,I still can't believe the story I saw said the tests are known to show false positives one in every five times.

As a regular reader of your comments section I hope my letter finds you well. 

It was upon my daily constitutional that i came across a sign that saddened me. 

The sign warned of ""Smartphone Zombies"", people so caught up in reading on tiny screens while moving around that they cannot properly comprehend the environment around themselves.

Sadly I did not have my sketch pad to render a drawing of the signage.

If you travel on the tube in the evening you will see this sort of thing, minus the pizza, really regularly. You go waking every one of them up you are going to run into to trouble really fucking quickly.

If you are wanting to go to university but you fucked off at high school, you can do two years at a community college and give the university a better record to look at. Community colleges also have the benefit of being local, cheaper, and taught by people who actually work in the fields they are teaching. Additional perk: if you are not sure what you want to do, you can take a single class each semester without risking a whole year's financial aid on choosing a field that you just aren't into doing the work for."

Welp, that same year, I needed to apply for a passport. Only to send in my fucking signature on everything, that didn't match the signature on my license so they rejected my app. Not only that, by the time I got back the rejection, I was going to have to pay the ""rush"" fee to get another one before my trip. So, I drove my ass back down there. And since state employees could tell someone to fuck off and not be fired, the same bitch was there and I told her why I had to do this. She said, ""whatchu want me to do bout it?"" with the neck roll. I wanted to rip out a corn row so badly.

My current drivers license is probably about 4 years old. My signature had gotten less legible by that point, but you could still make out first initial, and the first half of my last name followed by a line. My passport I got two years ago. My signature at this point is first initial, last initial and a few loops. It’s no longer easily legible, but I could definitely identify it as my signature. I didn’t have any issues when submitting my paperwork for my passport, so I wonder if whoever rejected your passport application was just super nit-picky or if the person that approved mine was just super lazy."

Like unless people get a full scholarship, most people with Masters Degrees owe at least 100-150k, why/how would anybody be able to pay that off at $15 and change per hour?

Ffs the same people who approve these jobs should have to accept the same pay.... if it's such an acceptable living wage for someone who has been at school for a total of 18 years and six figures in debt before they even consider the cost of living, then it should be fine to pay the same to someone with 10 years experience who doesnt seem to think it is shitty pay apparently....."

But in my state fast food workers make 13-15/hr, **there is absolutely no excuse** to start someone off at that same range who is expected to have such a high level of education.

And actually, yes, I do buy locally sourced. I do go to Walmart, typically once every 2 or 3 months just because they carry stuff that is not easy to find at times. Other than that I shop at Hannaford which is basically all local. Or at least American made. 

I mean it does depend, for instance I enjoy cultural dishes, so whenever possible I will buy authentic goods imported from the country whose style of food I am preparing. But theres a lot of discussion when it comes to food sourcing, so I will spare further details at this time to keep the comment short.

Also, I do not have my masters yet, just my bachelors, but I am a Linguistics major and pursuing my Masters in speech pathology. I researched the pay first. Typically (in my state) starting pay is about 40-45/ hr. If I was offered 15 and change I would be insulted and tell them to fuck themselves."

DasBeefcat,fdza6en,t1_fdxu91u,"I have a friend that graduated with that same masters. She was working for this super wealthy family that had 2 autistic kids. They bought a house for the 2 kids to go to everyday and have all these professionals come in for different things. It was crazy.

Anyway, do you really think that is legit? A master's is required for a $15/hr job? You know it isn't. If it is though, that is 100% on the person who went into that profession. I have a cousin who was that way. Some sort of Child Psychiatrist through Artwork or something. Some sort of ridiculous sounding masters degree that she knew she wouldn't make shit doing, much less be able to find a job in many cities. She just loved it though.

I know all these people love to complain about pay and all that but I think there is a massive shift from unskilled people walking into a plant out of HS and working there for the rest of their life and dying with a pension to companies needing skilled workers. How that skill was taught, or even what that skill was, has taken some time but companies are figuring it out. Doesn't take a 4 yr, it's learned as a trade almost. The company will pay for your 2 year if you agree to work for them for 5 years or something like that. There are some campuses dedicated to it, running alongside some community colleges around the country. The US is lagging in these training centers but I think they are getting there. India has the biggest one right now but companies are going American where possible. If that was around when I was that age, I would have done that it in a heartbeat. 

All in all though, most of the people I speak to about this are people just getting started in their careers, are working minimum wage jobs and just want to complain about something, or are just full of shit trying to get karma. 

Most are the latter 2, you seem to just be starting out. Good luck in your career and always look for a way to get your own business going. Always be looking for a niche to take advantage of and take at least 1 chance in life like that. You won't ever regret trying, I swear. Hell, I would recommend taking at least 6 months for travelling before you start too tho. Go see Chile or Argentina for a while before you get caught up"

I took a couple years off to get some life and career experience, as well as save some money. But there just was something to be said about going back to school for a short time to make double what I make now. 

But I just feel terrible for the people who had little to no financial aid, no scholarships, no help at all, and now many basically have a mini-mansion mortgage to pay back. All while making less than I make with a bachelors, and after all that they are supposed to make ends meet just to live somehow..... it makes me sick!

I mean I agree they shouldn't just graduate and suddenly become rich, but imo the day you get paid from your first ""real"" job should pretty much be the end of the whole ""ramen-noodles-are-a-main-food-staple"" phase of your life lol"

Pantsy-,fdx308s,t1_fdw8yn4,"Yes. This is not an unusual rate and demand for a degree for people in LA at least. Many don’t realize that people “making it” in the arts are mostly already multimillionaires when they enter the business. That means the vast majority of our television, movies, fine arts, music etc are made by people who come from multiple generations of extreme wealth. 

Demands for a highly educated and connected workforce have  increased while salaries and hired jobs go down. A huge amount of jobs are part time temp. This is illegal and the state of CA is finally cracking down. Company owners are freaking out, mine included. My boss says he might need to sell his third home and stop living in Europe for half the year. 

We’re also seeing freakishly low wages in tech. I spent some time with friends in SV and they were working 60+ hours a week for 75-90k. A one bedroom apartment is 36k per year there. That doesn’t leave much after taxes to have more than a break-even life. This is working for Apple, Facebook and Google. They have multiple PhD s and grad degrees. But hey, profits are good!

Edit: autocorrect"
Pantsy-,fdx4ozf,t1_fdx308s,"In other words, the people designing your new smartphones and working for the “best” companies in the world are effectively making $24 an hour.

I switched to pursuing a masters in Speech Pathology from my initial goal of a PhD in Transcription and Documentation of Indiginous Languages because although I would much rather travel the world and see places nobody gets to see, documenting languages nobody has ever heard of... well, that job typically pays about 35k a year. That is less than I make now. And Speech Pathologists make $40 an hour to start, with just a masters.

If education was free, I would never have changed my field of study. But very few colleges have that line of study, I was looking at graduating with over 300k in loans to get my damn PhD and make 35k a year. Fuck that."

It is so divisive that it [tore early Christians apart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1ZZeCDGHJE)  and resulted in many of the different sects that exist to this day. Even Paul's writings in the New Testament scriptures reference this conflict and assert which side he stood on."

karlnite,fdl2nrv,t1_fdl1ocd,I know but it’s kind of funny seeing people saying the Holy Trinity is this or is that when clearly there is no consensus because multiple sects exist. The nature if religion means that people in one sect are positive they’re right and people and in another are positive they’re right about conflicting ideas. So ultimately I asked what the majority of Christians believe about the holy trinity and to me that will be the most correct answer.

>but how can you get officials to pass bills against themselves?

that's exactly the problem, no politician would ever agree to changes that negatively affect them.

the only way I have ever come up with is for the president to propose a referendum legislation to allow for the rapid change in the federal bureaucracy that is done by a separate panel of people. so in essence, congress votes to allow a referendum to happen (under the coercion of lobbying and making it seems like you are a corrupt undemocratic official if you don't vote for it) that would allow an election for a committee to work closely with the president to come up with changes such as congressional term limits and a requirement to volunteer (just examples) and then those go to a process of the public voting yay or nay in the same way as voting for president with a massive marketing campaign to get people to vote.

also maybe a few other laws that prevent 3rd parties from interfering/spreading misinformation to sway voters.
