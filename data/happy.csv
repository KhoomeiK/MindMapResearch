ScoutMasterWes,embl0d,top_level,
see-the-good,fdnjlv3,t3_embl0d,"Wow, 9 years is a long time! Congratulations!"
hrafnkat,fdod7c5,t1_fdnjlv3,"Yeah, I'm wondering how painful the process was as well.  

One of my brothers had to have many years of braces, and he also had to have 4 teeth pulled because of overcrowding.  

Now he has a perfect movie-star smile, but by god he went through misery for it."
ScoutMasterWes,fdoh7db,t1_fdod7c5,"Kudos to your brother, sounds very similar! I am a small person so I also had to have 4 teeth pulled thanks to overcrowding!"
piggybits,fdow4ud,t1_fdod7c5,I had the same issue and had to have 4 removed as well its a really weird feeling to have teeth yanked out of your head. Then i got lucky and had to have all 4 my wisdom removed because they were all impacted.
hrafnkat,fdoiyx4,t1_fdoh7db,"Did the braces hurt the entire time?  I remember that my brother was in so much pain every time that the orthodontist adjusted and tightened  the wires, that he couldn't sleep for several days.  

I can't even imagine going through 9 years of that, congratulations on toughing it out.  You look great!"
Gil_V,fdorg75,t1_fdoh7db,"That used to be SOP for braces. Pull the teeth behind the incisors, wear braces for 3+ years, pull wisdom teeth.

Worked well, and I’m sixty years old. It was a serious self-esteem issue for me when I was a child.

I even had the pleasure of wearing headgear!"
Loveandfear,fdoshfo,t1_fdoh7db,Incredible! Great to see you smiling in both pics too :)
hrafnkat,fdox50r,t1_fdow4ud,"I had to have all my wisdom teeth removed for the same reason, when I was 18 or 19.  

The dentist gave me a prescription for Valium ahead of time, and I took some before I left home.  I remember leaving the house, and then waking up in my own bed after the surgery.  Nothing in between.  

Apparently I curled up on some chairs in the dentist's waiting room, like a small, sleepy child, and had to be physically lifted into the dental chair.

I must admit that, in retrospect, the Valium-slumber sounds much better than the agony some people have told me about from their own extractions!"
ScoutMasterWes,fdoj42l,t1_fdoiyx4,They didnt hurt the entire time! They were definitely sore whenever the ortho would tighten them but it wasnt so bad for me that I'd lose sleep thankfully
bardia_afk,fdolpq4,t1_fdoiyx4,"I’ve had braces (surgery prep+straightening) for over a year now, it only hurts for a day or two right after the doc tightens them. 

The pain never bothered me I just wouldn’t eat really tough food for a day. 

but right before my surgery I got these REALLY thick wires put in, like almost 2-3 times the thickness of the normal ones, they were literal bars that the doc bent with pliers to the exact shape of my teeth, instead of the usual u shaped wires. Those hurt like a motherfucker, couldn’t even close my mouth. 

For the first time during the whole year of ortho I couldn’t eat solids for two days..."
piggybits,fdoyz7r,t1_fdox50r,"I got lucky then i had 2 appoints, local anesthetics 2 teeth per appointment. I had 0 pain during and after ( can't remember if i was prescribed anything this was about 15 years ago) it's just a weird sensation having the teeth removed cuz i could feel movement in the area and could pretty much hear the movement of the teeth inside my hwad"
Kodono,fdp0403,t1_fdolpq4,What was the surgery for? Because if you had jaw surgery you wouldn't eat solids for a month. So solids after 2 days caught my attention.
bardia_afk,fdpfik4,t1_fdp0403,It WAS jaw surgery... I couldn’t eat solids for two days right after the thick ass braces... I got them about two weeks before my surgery...
umangg,fdnnmnv,t3_embl0d,"Wow, it feels amazing and satisfying when someone posts their before-after condition. Keep smiling, your smile is contagious."
ScoutMasterWes,fdntkw5,t1_fdnnmnv,You're too sweet!
Shaojack,fdozfxf,t1_fdnnmnv,after-before*
deadfermata,fdntpu0,t1_fdntkw5,Let me know if you want me to dilute him with water.
umangg,fdpdl9i,t1_fdntkw5,This reply is also cute :)
umangg,fdpdj1f,t1_fdozfxf,"Just enjoy means, don’t get everything literally :)"
ScoutMasterWes,fdntw4y,t1_fdntpu0,Can you add a little salt to this thread? That would balance it out
BearNoseHook,fdoi10p,t1_fdntw4y,"Nice transition from British to American.  
  
Salty enough?  
  
EDIT:  Thank for the silver kind internet stranger."
LilleHelene,fdnh4x7,t3_embl0d,You look so pretty :3 so don't hide that smile girl :)
deadfermata,fdnto4v,t1_fdnh4x7,How about me. Do I look pretty too? Look at my smile 😬
boonshizzle,fdouim8,t1_fdnh4x7,"Yeah, and no soda for OP!"
VIParadigm,fdntzfi,t1_fdnto4v,You look great and I'm very proud of you
ScoutMasterWes,fdnvd6v,t1_fdnto4v,You look absolutely stunning! Thank you for your smile
NOTbelligerENT,fdnwuyz,t1_fdnto4v,You're beautiful.
tan_walk,fdnws91,t3_embl0d,Wear your retainer! I had braces in high school. Got them off senior year. Didn't wear my retainer and my teeth went about 1/4 of the way back to where they were when I started.
ScoutMasterWes,fdnxmpk,t1_fdnws91,"Yeah I'm definitely wearing them all day everyday, theres no way I'm letting them shift back"
WVmtnmama,fdo0tjb,t1_fdnws91,I recently started Invisalign for that very reason. Definitely wear your retainer people!!!
Reostat,fdoizr1,t1_fdo0tjb,"At some point in your life you lose it anyways or just can't be assed, and then ya, they shift again. I haven't had braces for 13 years now, I wore my retainer for probably 2 years after I got them off. 

Top teeth are shifting a bit now because my idiot orthodontist only put a tiny permanent one up there. Bottom ones are fine. Might go to Spain or similar to get some cheap Invisalign to fix the top again in the future."
EdgiPing,fdolwo4,t1_fdoizr1,How long were you suppose to use the retainer?
Reostat,fdom92d,t1_fdolwo4,"Can't remember. Something like 2-3 years 24/7 and then as long as possible at nights forever? But it's possible I don't remember, it was a long time ago."
JWNAMEDME,fdqljy6,t1_fdolwo4,My bro in law is almost 50 and he still wears his retainer at night. Braces were removed in high school. You wear them indefinitely.
-Hei_Bai-,fdnmw9g,t3_embl0d,"It's an amazing feeling. When I got my implants in over the past semester, for the rest of the day I was glowing and couldn't stop smiling. Cried tears of joy when I looked into a mirror.

It's an amazing feeling and you look amazing yourself!"
smokeydaBandito,fdodqpj,t1_fdnmw9g,"I desperately need 3-4 implants, one has actually become somewhat of a major health risk (literally so painful that my vision blurs, and nothing shy of 100proof mouthwash will stop it) but dental implant work is so frigging expensive. Too bad i can't claim that it is legitimate outside of dental insurrance"
Casehead,fdoef2k,t1_fdodqpj,"Can’t you get it pulled now and get the implant later? You could have an abcess or something, and those kill."
smokeydaBandito,fdoghvs,t1_fdoef2k,"I do have an abcess, and my understanding is that if removed but not replaced, my teeth will shift around significantly, which at best could create a a need for more work to prep for implants.

It also just feels.... like something I deserve to live with because of past mistakes in my youth."
Casehead,fdohrvt,t1_fdoghvs,"Oh, ok, I see. You certainly don’t deserve that, friend."
ramsay_baggins,fdosmyb,t1_fdoghvs,Dental infections are super dangerous. Like can kill you dangerous. You need to get it sorted asap. You don't deserve to live in pain.
Fai1eBashere,fdoh7w7,t1_fdoghvs,What could you have done that means you deserve pain that blurs your vision?
smokeydaBandito,fdor5ye,t1_fdoh7w7,Drugs and nicotine
Fai1eBashere,fdosxtr,t1_fdor5ye,Nah neither of those mean you deserve pain now
vanvarmar,fdnqpnz,t3_embl0d,Transformation! Did you need additional work to pull your incisors down into place? Mine were embedded into my palate and had to be dug out and slowly pulled into place with tiny chains :/
ScoutMasterWes,fdnr62h,t1_fdnqpnz,"That sounds painful! I had to get some teeth removed to make room, then just gradually moving them down"
WhoMe243,fdnz3sw,t1_fdnqpnz,Did your insurance cover your procedure or sis you have to go out of pocket?
huffliest_puff,fdnx1lr,t1_fdnqpnz,"Hey, me too! Were they attached to a strange device implanted in your mouth?"
vanvarmar,fdnsfnp,t1_fdnr62h,"It was uncomfortable, but I don't remember it being particularly painful. It was also more than twenty years ago, so maybe the process has improved at the same rate my memory of it has deteriorated?"
vanvarmar,fdo1f67,t1_fdnz3sw,"No idea, I was 13 at the time but my father has always received good plans through work so I think it was pretty much covered. It was pricey regardless, since it included oral surgery.. they had to slice and dig those bad boys out."
vanvarmar,fdnxs9x,t1_fdnx1lr,"I already had braces, so they attached the little chains to those and slowly shortened the chain every now and then.

What strange device?? I'm super curious now!"
demalo,fdo8ivw,t1_fdnxs9x,Maybe they're wondering if you had an expander of some kind.
vanvarmar,fdo9gb9,t1_fdo8ivw,"Oh! No, just braces that slowly pulled the adjacent teeth away in order to make room for the ones coming down out of my palate."
relaxyobody,fdnm162,t3_embl0d,I wouldn't be able to stop smiling if I had that smile either! You look great!
Plantdas,fdo258g,t3_embl0d,"WEAR. YOUR. RETAINER.

I didn't use the one for my bottom teeth and they got crooked, so I used a straightening retainer which worked great at moving my teeth back but then I lost it.

My teeth look fine, a little crooked, but I had braces for 7 years only to have crooked teeth anyway :("
WhoMe243,fdnyxyz,t3_embl0d,"Omg I have the tooth way above the others too! I went in for a consultation but due to jae issues I'd have to have my jaw broken first which is a very costly procedure and concidered ""cosmetic"" even with TMJ and all my teeth cracking due to the pressure.

I'm super happy you were able to get that awesome smile, rock it!"
Rollulus,fdnqrpv,t3_embl0d,"Nice chompers, could’ve been straight from a toothpaste commercial."
ScoutMasterWes,fdntka6,t1_fdnqrpv,"I'm so flattered, thank you!"
glensueand,fdns77h,t3_embl0d,You look amazing!
crazydanishgirl,fdns8el,t3_embl0d,Congrats know the feeling now you can finally eat caramel
ScoutMasterWes,fdntieo,t1_fdns8el,"Hide yo kids, hide yo caramel!"
crazydanishgirl,fdnwlw3,t1_fdntieo,"Yes just wait, hallow will be mutch more scary this year"
MarcoPolocompi,fdnu3vv,t3_embl0d,"You seem like a nice, compassionate, sincere and lovely person based on your comments. Hopefully you have tons of things to smile about going forwards so you can share that great smile with us 🙂"
oh-shit-oh-no,fdpmvac,t1_fdnu3vv,As her brother I can assure you she isn't... Jk she's all of the above!
BelovedMrsK,fdnzf5u,t3_embl0d,I am so genuinely happy for you. As a mother getting the money to fix all 5 of my kid’s Teeth was hard. My last one had to wait until she was 16 to get braces. I’m genuinely crying for joy for you bc I remember the pain of my daughter having messed up teeth!
ScoutMasterWes,fdnzoi1,t1_fdnzf5u,That is wonderful of you! I cannot thank my parents enough for paying for my ortho work
Plantdas,fdo2bgy,t1_fdnzf5u,Thank you Mom for taking care of your kids teeth! One of the best gifts you could give is a happy smile!

byronicreader,fdnzheb,t3_embl0d,Trust me! It is worth everything. Now others can’t take their eyes off when you smile! The “before” you is also cute in its own innocence sense! Happy smiles ahead!
-Mamba-,fdo0smy,t3_embl0d,You've probably heard this a thousand times but wear your retainer!
dramboxf,fdo1pz2,t3_embl0d,"Just got two front teeth implants on Jan 3. For two years, when I smiled I looked like a Russian gangster. SO happy to have my smile back!

CONGRATS!"
ScoutMasterWes,fdo49og,t1_fdo1pz2,Congratulations to you too! I'm happy for you!

world_citizen7,fdo410l,t3_embl0d,"Not only did they fix your teeth, they made it damn perfect!!  👍"
kirbrcd1,fdo41c1,t3_embl0d,Beautiful!!
NefariousSerendipity,fdo4mkm,t3_embl0d,Aww Sparkling eyes. O.O You're glowing hun. :)
Modern-Relic,fdo4vq9,t3_embl0d,"Wow, I thought I was a champ for having them on for 5 year. Looking good!"
Steph1066,fdo7jtm,t3_embl0d,"I had braces for 2 years and had them off 2-3 months ago. It is an amazing feeling and eating without having to clean between each tooth every God damn time is wonderful! However, 9 years!? You resilient bugger! You look fantastic, congratulations!"
ScoutMasterWes,fdo7xk4,t1_fdo7jtm,Haha thank you! The 'resilient bugger' made me laugh
ThatOneGuyVolden,fdoauce,t3_embl0d,"Your old teeth look like mine, but i can't afford braces sadly."
reesercollins,fdod88z,t3_embl0d,Are your teeth all weirdly slick and smooth after having the braces removed?
ScoutMasterWes,fdoehl0,t1_fdod88z,Haha yeah they are so smooth!
Casehead,fdoe969,t3_embl0d,Wow!!
The-Mr_mell,fdoehpk,t3_embl0d,:)
puppypoet,fdoeul3,t3_embl0d,You had my exact teeth. You've given me hope for a happy smile someday.
Kingofawesome13,fdof68i,t3_embl0d,"This is so nice for me to see. I'm currently getting aligners and my teeth look nearly exactly like your old ones. I had extractions today, and my entire jaw is numb and swollen as I write this. Thank you for this!"
ScoutMasterWes,fdoflzn,t1_fdof68i,"This makes me so happy! I'm very glad to hear that, your teeth are going to look BEAUTIFUL! Keep looking forward!"
Moni6674,fdofqh2,t3_embl0d,Congratulations love? I had to wear my braces for 9 years as well . Painful process but well worth the results.
qmnty,fdog4kk,t3_embl0d,"im confused.... why does it say final ceph 2020?????
It says 2020."
ScoutMasterWes,fdog80c,t1_fdog4kk,"The page they printed had both pictures of me before and after on it, so the final 2020 one was the one they took that day"
qmnty,fdogcee,t1_fdog80c,"im still confused, but I'm dumb so I'm just going to go with what you said"
ScoutMasterWes,fdogn24,t1_fdogcee,"No it's ok! Basically they took before and after photos of me. The picture that I posted only has the before image on it, but the after one is there too. The final ceph (although I dont know what ceph means) was just the time stamp on the picture they took when they removed my braces. It's ok to ask questions!"
qmnty,fdogpbr,t1_fdogn24,ok
PandaLLC,fdogewt,t3_embl0d,"Can I ask why whole 9 years? I had teeth similar to yours and it took 1,5 years before I got it taken off, my 4 wisdom teeth pulled out and started wearing the retainer."
ScoutMasterWes,fdogys6,t1_fdogewt,"Sure you can ask! 3 years were when I was super duper young and they tried moving my teeth around before I had all my adult teeth, and that did not work at all. I got braces again when I was a bit older (pictured), and it still took a while then since I moved off to college and could only visit the orthodontist a few times a year for adjustments. We didnt switch to an orthodontist near my school because it was too expensive to switch."
steev506,fdogugc,t3_embl0d,Did you know in Japan crooked teeth is not seen as a bad thing but in fact a personality traits? The way your teeth used to look is actually something some girls go to the dentist to achieve by braces because that canine sticking out is awesome. What matters though is that your smile is something you feel shining through.
ScoutMasterWes,fdoh234,t1_fdogugc,That's really cool! I want super self consciousness about my teeth back then but I am quite happy I have a smile that I personally like a bit more!
MyGirlNelly,fdogynm,t3_embl0d,"You can tell people that you used to have summer teeth.  Summer pointing to the right and summer are pointing to the left!

You're beautiful !  You haven't aged, maybe but a year!

Best of luck going forward!"
ChaplnGrillSgt,fdoh2oe,t3_embl0d,Don't your teeth feel soooo smooth??
spacekittenpaw,fdomcwp,t3_embl0d,Thats a stunning smile this world deserves to see.  :D

Gil_V,fdor6aa,t3_embl0d,"Holy shit, what a difference! Such hard work. Floss every day so you keep those beautiful teeth. And wear your retainer!"
Hippie1972,fdore7c,t3_embl0d,From what I see.......it was definitely worth the wait.  You have a beautiful smile.
The_Roz,fdori98,t3_embl0d,"Fuck, mine are similar to yours and I'm 47.  Dentist keeps telling me to get them fixed, but nine years?!"
ay-nahl-reip,fdorsqf,t3_embl0d,Your younger photo looks a lot like someone I went to elementary/middle school with? Are you from Texas?
ScoutMasterWes,fdos6a2,t1_fdorsqf,"I am not, but I wouldnt be surprised if I had a doppelganger out there!"
ay-nahl-reip,fdot1r4,t1_fdos6a2,"Nice haha. Well your teeth look great, congrats!"
Teri102563,fdotkkg,t3_embl0d,Looks great too!

hambop,fdou95l,t3_embl0d,Your smile is beautiful!!!! So happy for you :)
bazamalam25,fdov0uq,t3_embl0d,I'm 26 and have had braces since October 2013. I literally can't think of life without them as I've had them for so long. It'll be interesting to actually feel my teeth again.  😁
GFB1011,fdp86ck,t1_fdov0uq,I've had braces in 2016 and got them removed in 2019 and it feels great to not have them anymore
ozzmanmojo,fdov420,t3_embl0d,Looks like it paid off! Beautiful smile!
Inukchook,fdowqnu,t3_embl0d,"My wife had similar teeth. She ended up having her jaw broken and then braces. Quite amazing what three can do. Her teeth look amazing just as yours do !

Rucifer,fdp0exl,t3_embl0d,You look like an entirely new person. I'm happy for you. I can feel the radiance coming out of your smile.

I have a little tooth amongst the normal ones. I got a cheap jacket for it but the jacket cement didn't stay for long.

Now if I don't get another jacket. Chances are, the space will be occupied by nearby teeth."

I've never met or even seen another Orion in person but people will tell your son if they know of anyone that has the same name. It's fun. :) bless you and the child. If you're ever in mid Missouri look me up."

AdolfTheGay,fe0gwfo,t1_fdzvjy0,"Maybe this is very wrong, and even horribly insensitive, but going through her post history:
She was pregnant with three fetuses. Two shared a sac and placenta, making them nonviable. One survived and was today born, shown in this post. My theory is that the name Orion was chosen in relation to the three stars of Orion’s belt in the constellation. If so that is a beautiful choice."

Greek mythology, Orion was a gigantic, supernaturally strong hunter,[11] born to Euryale, a Gorgon, and Poseidon (Neptune), god of the sea. One myth recounts Gaia's rage at Orion, who dared to say that he would kill every animal on Earth. The angry goddess tried to dispatch Orion with a scorpion. This is given as the reason that the constellations of Scorpius and Orion are never in the sky at the same time. However, Ophiuchus, the Serpent Bearer, revived Orion with an antidote. This is said to be the reason that the constellation of Ophiuchus stands midway between the Scorpion and the Hunter in the sky."

Poor, poor bastard. His school life is going to be absolute fucking hell. I mean, I love the classical allusion, but blimey.

>the gods Zeus, Hermes, and Poseidon come to visit Hyrieus of Tanagra, who roasts a whole bull for them. When they offer him a favor, he asks for the birth of sons. The gods take the bull's hide and urinate into it and bury it in the earth, then tell him to dig it up ten months later. When he does, he finds Orion

Kodono,fdij1o5,t1_fdhteye,"Just don't get too excited. The reality is that sometimes people get cold feet, are depressed, too introverted ect. So there is always a chance they backout or ghost you. So just calm down and see how it goes. Don't tell anybody but 1-2 people about the date because it's really awkward saying you got stood up.

I've been on both ends. Dating sucks. But honestly congratulations, I really hope it goes well."
Derm,fdje5ie,t1_fdhteye,"Please don't stop smiling, until the date is over, you have a really nice smile and girls are so much more magnetic when they smile and smiling is contagious and if you smile it will make him think you are enjoying spending time with him and he will smile too and get the fuzzies and never stop smiling, love you bye."

vegemouse,fdhtamm,t3_elfomd,"Remember just to think of it as meeting a new person, not meeting the person of your dreams. It will make you so much less nervous and it will be easier to find out more about them. You'll do great!"

l3eer,fdkq0w5,t3_elfomd,"I didn’t start dating until I was 22. I decided that summer I’d get on dating websites and see what was out there. Went on multiple dates a week that summer always with different people. I didn’t want to date new guys over the holidays (thanksgiving/Christmas) so just as I was about to shut everything down, I met my love. Three and a half years later and we are still very much in love. 

My suggestion to you is make sure you feel safe and comfortable. Listen to yourself if something doesn’t feel right. It’s good to have high standards for yourself! You deserve the best! But when it’s a first date—give people whom you might not have otherwise given a chance. I don’t mean compromise your safety or anything, but if you say no to someone before meeting them, you might be missing out on a great person. 
Also, you’re a catch. So don’t let some person have the privilege of a committed relationship before they are willing to do the same for you. This guy I once went out with for a bit told me he was not casually dating other girls and expected me to do the same. I told me that’s fine for him to do that, but I was going to still see other people until we had defined labels. I’m so glad I did that because I was not limited to just him.

So excited for you! You got this!"

Look up the annual student fashion competition  that Supima has. 10 student designers are selected and brought to NYC where they get a full blown runway show, winner takes home a chunk of change.

The great thing about learning a new skill or craft... is exactly that.. stick with it. You will likely fail 7 times to start with. Next time.. maybe 2 times.

funktopus,fe7ci1z,t3_enxfl4,"As a bald dude in winter, one more knit hat helps. So thank you. 

Years ago my fiance left me for a married man with a girl's name. Worst pain I've ever felt, and I get kidney stones. It will get better. Seriously one day, you won't realize it till later, you didn't think of them. Then you will be told they are engaged and you will feel a twinge but it won't bother you. Then you end up married, really happy and that person will fade from your memory. Please remember the pain you feel is temporary and will go away. 

If you decide to make hats for a living let reddit know. I'll buy one, winter sucks for us bald folks."
arimeYO,fe7qg2m,t3_enxfl4,Made my eyes wet. I'm so happy for you. Good luck big sister! You gave me hope. Thanks
lgalla02026,fe7ziyp,t3_enxfl4,GOOD FOR YOU for not letting someone else’s actions derail you. Knitting has saved me during periods of intense stress. Someone told me it is a form of meditation.

oreneec,fdwb164,t3_en8s9e,This is amazing! Congrats on being 1 month clean! You’re very beautiful btw!
faradayyy,fdwe9xo,t1_fdwb164,thank you so much :)
420JulianR,fdz7j4m,t1_fdwb164,Yes she’s beautiful at start and more beautiful now
faradayyy,fdwb2is,t3_en8s9e,"i still struggle with staying clean, but i'm prepared for a lifetime of that; right now, it feels good to be able to conquer every day with the love and support of my family, boyfriend, & friends who i've managed to rekindle my relationships with after almost 2 years of neglect from my part. hindsight is a beautiful thing, & i'm so grateful i get to wake up every morning and focus on how to love myself in better ways rather than having to focus on getting my next fix. next stop: finishing my last semester of undergrad & getting that degree!"
PostResidencyGoals,fdwmi09,t1_fdwb2is,What's your degree (going to be) in?
Bokononitgoes,fe021zz,t1_fdwb2is,Keep going! The first year in sobriety is tough. But it gets better and easier. One day you wake up and your head is clear. And you have hope. That’s been my experience.
faradayyy,fdwva5m,t1_fdwmi09,BA in psychology :)
PostResidencyGoals,fdwxp19,t1_fdwva5m,Awesome! You got this! Congrats!!

plutoniaex,fdwnne5,t3_en8s9e,I can tell the difference in your mood from your smile. It looks genuinely happy now.
faradayyy,fdwwcod,t1_fdwnne5,"i've never had a healthier bond with my family & with my boyfriend, plus i have so many things to be hopeful about after being lost for over a year... i'm definitely the happiest i've been in idk how long :)"
plutoniaex,fdx7l4f,t1_fdwwcod,Yeah that'll do it :). Also non of them are easy tasks. I hope you can sustain and grow it.
book_smart_devil,fdwyhke,t3_en8s9e,"Hey nice job! Tbh you looked good in both pictures but you definitely look way better in the second!

Can I ask what made you want to end your addiction? And also if it was tied to your depression or if you started taking drugs because you were depressed? I'm struggling with both at the moment and I'm finding it very hard to even want to get out of bed some days."
faradayyy,fdxlkvd,t1_fdwyhke,"thank you so much!!! 

honestly.. i think i had always had a problem with depression so i started taking drugs because i liked how it made me feel, and i liked how it made *me* in terms of social habits. i became way more comfortable with expressing myself, and i didn't feel so inhibited. but as i'm sure you can imagine, that didn't last long. i started to become a different version of myself, but it took so long for me to see that. i kept using though, partly because i thought i had it under control and partly because i believed i'd be more depressed without it. 

by the end of it, i was sick of how much i isolated myself, disgusted by how i treated other people & how they treated me. i was just fed up tbh and i became very suicidal, that was my breaking point that made me kinda snap out of it and realize how much time i let go by without moving forward. i realized that the only way for me to make progress & move toward success would *have* to be without the presence of drugs in my life. so i quit cold turkey & believe me, it took me 8 days to even be able to leave my room. but by the 8th day i just kind of snapped out of it and told myself, ""if not now, then when?"" so i showered, did my old skincare routine, put on makeup and a dress, all that stuff haha and i went out with my sisters and friends to a party. i literally just dived right back into the real world but — amazingly enough — i was warmly welcomed. since then, every day has gotten easier. i mean sometimes i'll wake up craving more than usual so i'll stay in bed with my cat & bingewatch Cheers instead of cleaning my room or doing laundry, sure. but at the end of the day, i'm another day sober and i get to check it off, which is a success to me. 

sorry if that was way too long and i really hope i could have helped, i kind of just ended up rambling a bit lol but that's my two cents! just as abruptly as i stopped using is just as abruptly i threw myself back out there. i do believe the universe has some sort of boomerang effect where if you take care & love yourself & everyone around you, it'll all come back to save your ass in the end :)

edit: of course, can't forget to mention the almighty Born Ruffians & their song ""Hummingbird"" lol. listening to that song gave me an epiphany & really helped snap me out of my suicidal stage (along with my boyfriend of course)"
Malamutelvr91,fe1rc5r,t1_fdxlkvd,"If all you can do is stay in bed, then by all means do it. Like you said - another day sober! Congratulations and keep going strong!!"

Laying down a foundation I feel is the best thing you can do first if you're going to succeed. That's vague I know but I think everybody's got to have some sort of 'foundation' to work from so you have some sort of sense of achievement as you move forward. 

So can I ask if you, if you don't mind. When did you feel it was time to stop, what happened at that moment, and what was it like for you over the following short while after let's say 2-3 days.

Wishing for nothing but the best for you."

helpfuldan,fdn1vdx,t3_em36be,"Looking good! 

Slightly off topic, but you'll probably notice that the positive action you took (makeup, errands) will have a bigger and longer lasting effect then simply giving yourself a pep talk. You can remind yourself to stay positive, don't be so hard on yourself, everything will be okay, but that tends to evaporate quickly when you're down. But positive action, is something you can hang your hat on. When you're down you remember that well I did put on makeup and run errands, which is a lot more powerful then anything you can tell yourself in your head. If you can commit to one positive action (going for walk, working out, making a healthy meal, writing a letter you've been putting off, running errands) each time you're feeling down, you'll start seeing more good days then bad. :)"

Try to keep it up, but if you can't, don't beat yourself up. Be as patient with yourself as you would be for others, you're human too. If you push yourself, things will get easier with time. Remember that if it's too hard to push yourself and you're just too tired physically and mentally, ask for help. Sometimes that's the only productive thing you can do and that's okay"

I just hope it rains and rains and rains until all the fires are extinguished!"
ErisGrey,fdxh0z0,t3_en6zlg,"My area of California went 5(?) years without measurable rain during the peak of the ""exceptional drought"". When it finally came, it hit us like a monsoon. Flash floods, mudslides, the whole 9 yards.

It seemed like every neighborhood kid was out playing in the rain in the streets. I sat on my front porch watching them. Talking with my neighbor, she told me it was the first time her two kids ever saw rain. Looking out I realized that the majority of the kids probably had no memory of the last rain event. It was one of the longest droughts I remember experiencing in the area. I will admit I cried.

The rain cleared the dirt from air so much we were able to see the beautiful mountains that almost completely surround us. [The desert hills turned emerald green and came to life](https://i.imgur.com/N4AAPKI.jpg). A couple weeks later, the largest wildflower bloom ever recorded happened. Some species of flowers that haven't been seen since before the last ice age sprouted. So many flowers sprouted, [the fields were observable from the ISS](https://i.imgur.com/u4kOPN8.gifv). It made me realize that my home can be a beautiful place too.

I do a bit of volunteer work for habitat restoration. At the height of the bloom, everything was so packed with people we didn't really get to enjoy them much. It's unfortunately why I only have pictures leading up to the bloom. But my allergies get so bad, it was probably for the better."

JoWubb,fdquhe0,t3_emqyg7,What have you done to lose weight? I’m trying to burn some LBs myself. Congrats.
chocopear,fdqv9iz,t1_fdquhe0,The biggest thing for me is that I’ve been trying to incorporate  healthier habits a little bit at a time so it becomes second nature to make healthier choices. I think if I was more hardcore about it I could’ve lost a lot more weight by now but I realized it’s more about feeling good physically. I hope that helps.
ChaplnGrillSgt,fdrt29g,t1_fdquhe0,"Only thing that has worked for me has been calorie counting. I use MyFitnessPal and have had good success. You start to learn what foods are low calorie and healthy eating is rewarded with lower calorie counts. It also encouraged me to exercise because that earned me more calories for the day to stay at goal. After about a year, I was able to stop using the app because I kind of just knew the caloric value of most of my regular foods. I knew I should fill up on fruits and veggies rather than breads and chips."

>HFCS and added sugar are also linked to many other serious health issues, including diabetes and heart disease

Jlonewolf-,fdne2dv,t1_fdlxfsn,I fell in love and realized not everything was so bad. Then that person left me and it put me back deep into my depression. I then realized I couldn’t let everything that was going bad in my life consume me and I had to look on the brighter side of things and be more optimistic. And the most important thing is SELF LOVE.
skinc0ffin,fdnk8zj,t1_fdne2dv,"Definitely. If you're in peace with yourself you don't need anyone else to make you you. I'm still struggling that path a bit still but I know I'm also my biggest obstacle. I'll manage.

Revolutionary-Growth,fdrd4ty,t3_emv2ha,So it means I can find my soul mate without even partying? Maybe my soul mate is hanging out on reddit somewhere :)
MisfitHeather138,fds1az4,t3_emv2ha,"I met my husband on Instagram, moved from Ga to Ohio where his business is and couldn't be happier. Although the weather here sucks. We've been together 7 years now haha and it started because he made a random comment on one of my posts. Good luck to y'all!!"
RecursiveRhetoric,fdrc6lp,t3_emv2ha,"I met my wife in a Facebook group, completely unplanned. Within 2 years, we got engaged while living in two separate states, then 6 months later we moved into an apartment together and planned the wedding. We've been married for 3+ years.

Don't let anyone tell you your relationship isn't real, just because it's long-distance. It may be better than most people's. ❤️👍🏻"
c-squared58,fdrs5yl,t3_emv2ha,Yay! Love this!!
