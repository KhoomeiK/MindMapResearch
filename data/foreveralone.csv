Another-Lone-Wolf,fe4f83m,t3_ens1ts,Those are also the guys that train next to me in the gym...
Benawesome_BW,fe5tel8,t1_fe4f83m,I always feel kind of insecure seeing that one giant friendly dude who can lift 500 pounds over his head...
jokingexplorer,fe67s6m,t1_fe5tel8,Tbh it gives me positive feelings when these kind of dudes are friendly and respectful.
DigitalSpecX,fe6af8z,t1_fe67s6m,Why wouldn't they be friendly and respectful? They live happy lives 😄
ghostidiot,fe9ra47,t1_fe67s6m,"It's easy to be friendly when everyone constantly validates you, and you fit or exceed every expectation of being a man. The human brain craves security first and foremost. Only once security is met can you begin to truly project out lofty ideals like showing respect and good will to others."
jokingexplorer,fe6b468,t1_fe6af8z,"Can't see inside them so I wouldnt generalize. Also, in my experience, the people who had suffered a little (not so much that it destroyed them) turn out to be the most respectable humans."
jokingexplorer,fe9umhp,t1_fe9ra47,"That's right. But there are so many people that live very good, secure lifes and are completely spoiled because their expectations are way too high. I imagine if you get too much validation, you could turn arrogant and superficial. That's why I love when attractive people are also sweet human beings. Makes them double beautiful. No bad feelings from my side then. But if someone is very attractive, I will also constantly check if they act like they're better than me. If they don't that's great. 

And I also understand that ugly people (no offense to them, I am one of them) are more likely to become bitter due to past experiences. But it's not justified. I tell myself that if I ever become a hateful incel, then I have lost all value. As long as I'm trying to be a decent incel (if that can exist, by definition?), I have some respect for myself."

ShiftyEyes350,en4xl6,top_level,"It's been about a year and a half now. I was too nervous to stay hard and fuck her, but we kissed a lot (high end escort) and cuddled naked. I have to say, it was probably the most incredible thing I've ever experienced. The people who say it's no big deal are so full of shit. I didn't even get the real thing and it still felt sublime. Just something about holding a girl and kissing her all over, I understood immediately why this is at the core of the human experience. Shit, I actually felt like a human for once.

I can't believe there are people who get to feel this not only for free, but on a regular basis with a partner who desires them as well. The average man is so incredibly blessed and privileged in this way, yet he takes it all for granted. Even taking the bad with the good, a normal relationship to me sounds like a fantasy, a wild fever dream. And it's *normal*.

Fuck, life is cruel."
bigmememaestro69,fducke8,t3_en4xl6,Would you ever try it again given the opportunity? I know how you feel and it sucks for us to not be intimate like the rest of the normies out there
ShiftyEyes350,fducvoa,t1_fducke8,"Absolutely. I can't stand the thought that I might never get to feel that way again just because of how I look. I'm going to keep trying for a decent bit longer though, until the rejections and ghosting thoroughly break down my self esteem."
bigmememaestro69,fdudtbk,t1_fducvoa,Let us know if it does happen! How many rejections and ghostings have you taken lately? I'm pretty sure you posted a pic of yourself and I said you were a stylish dude that's not ugly at all.

_z3r0__,fdvxdre,t3_en4xl6,"i still cant believe that normal people experience that couple of times a week

i remember having the most realistic dream ever back in 2016 or 2017, i was sitting on a swinging chair in a big green backyard of a big house with my crush, i was holding her in my arms and she was squirming around in my lap, repositioning, smiling at me

im not proud to say that the happiest moment in my life happened in a dream,

the reality came close, i had a short relationship in freshman year in HS, i still remember how good cuddling felt, that was fucking 10 years ago, nothing since then

the only thing that sometimes gives me comfort is daydreaming, until hopefully one day i get to live it"
wph95,fdxyu2r,t1_fdvxdre,">i still cant believe that normal people experience that couple of times a week

lol bro it's more like a couple times a day"
Ray_Poward,fdw8np0,t3_en4xl6,"i feel you man. Theres nothing wrong if you loved it.  
we are all human"
hiroyuki_fx,fdxa1eo,t3_en4xl6,"I agree with you with most of the things you said, but let's just take into account something. You paid (what i assume was a lot of cash) for a custom experience that, believe it or not, not even ""normal"" people have. 

You have to understand also that while for normal people sex is something that is readily available with life partners, there are other baggages coming with it, being for example a partner with bad traits, their parents, a lot of shit that of course isn't reflected when you PAY for an experience. 

I don't know if i'm making myself clear here, but i realize that we on our situation sometimes paint as perfect the relationships that other people have just because we have none. That's why i'm not sure about seeing a prostitute, it can give you PART of the experience but there's no love, there's not all the other things that come with a loving partner and in the end i think i would end up feeling even more empty, all of this due to a controlled experience."
ShiftyEyes350,fdxc2j4,t1_fdxa1eo,"I acknowledged that a bit. I'm not saying that a relationship is like seeing a prostitute every day lmao, but that even if you take into account the bad parts like you listed it's still fucking incredible. I mean, you think normal people keep dealing with all the bullshit and diving back into relationships for shits and giggles? Fuck no, they do it because it's amazing."
wph95,fdy8nf2,t1_fdxa1eo,"You're right but not for the reason you think you are. Having sex with an actual loving partner is very different to having sex with a prostitute, it's 100x better even when factoring in the downsides you listed."
MDR4,fdywxyq,t1_fdxa1eo,This is what’s always held me back.  That and I’m afraid it will just become one more thing that I spend money on impulsively.
another30yovirgin,fdypune,t1_fdxa1eo,"So really, we should all give up on this dumbass love idea and save our money for hookers."
hiroyuki_fx,fdxqr4e,t1_fdxc2j4,"Yeah i just wanted to convey this because some people may think that the experience you get with a hooker (even a very high profile one) is something you've been missing all this time.

Sure a homeless man can end up having enough money to buy a night in the most luxurious hotel ever and then think that most people are privilegied enough to sleep like that. But some people while they sleep in a bed they can have very hard beds, or infested with bedbugs, or very noisy neighbors... but people still seeks to sleep because that's how we're wired.

People seek relationships (AND SEX) most of the time not because they're ""awesome"", but it's because we're wired like that, we're wired to seek them because we learned long ago that there's benefits to have someone besides us. That's why all of us are here in this very subreddit, because our social context is depriving us from something that we're wired for.

Anyways i'm not writing this to invalidate in any way your experience or the choice of anyone here to seek similar experiences, i'm glad you could have that chance, just want to inject some context and and reasoning behind something we all here crave.

Cheers."
ShiftyEyes350,fdxr02p,t1_fdxqr4e,It's precisely because we're wired to want it that it's so awesome. Our brains allow us moments of bliss for achieving it.
SuperSayanVegeta,fdwawgy,t3_en4xl6,I lost my virginity to an escort. Loved it. Still haven't had sex without paying because I'm crap at socialising.

uniquan,fduoe3y,t3_en4xl6,"""The average man is so incredibly blessed and privileged in this way, yet he takes it all for granted.""

I think the brain lazily takes for granted the files that were already processed and focus the brain power on what's the task at hand. When you're in relationship problems will arise, you'll have new reasons to be sad and happy about. 

No matter what state you are in life, there are lows and highs."
Dusan99,fdvxrso,t1_fduoe3y,Still beats cycling between low and lower
daemon86,fdzkjlk,t1_fduoe3y,And also it is not the same. I am sure having sex for the first time with that woman is exciting but if it's the 50th time with the same partner it is not exciting anymore. That's the reason why people cheat. They want to be excited again.
uniquan,fdw8h4j,t1_fdvxrso,"True. But that's out of context. I wasn't comparing the brain of FA against a normal brain. I am somehow offering an explanation why brains take for granted things they already have by default.

walrider2015,fdxje9n,t3_en4xl6,"I may be wrong, but I feel like it's only a euphoric feeling the first time or the first few times. After that you just get used to it and it doesn't hit the same anymore. In any case I imagine it probably makes one feel even worse after having that first time, since you can now fully grasp what the experience is like and desire it even more than before."
nawal86,fduq1pf,t3_en4xl6,"I've had some experience over the years (I'm 33, not bad looking and gay, but brown, autistic and was emotionally abandoned and abused as a child, so most men my age won't look at me, and the few who do can tell very quickly that I'm fundamentally broken). I sometimes wonder if it's only that amazing because it's a rare experience that we've built up so much in our heads. Like yeah, I'd totally like to have that everyday - but would it just turn bland?
 I was in a relationship for 7.5 years, but the last 3 years of that he was somebody else's boyfriend, and before that I had several year-long bouts of depression, so never really felt like I made the most of it.

(Before some asshole tells me I don't belong on here, you're damn right, but only because I'm not fully human, I'm unable to even want to be close to people anymore, I just feel lonely and miserable. And if you think just because I found love once it should be easy - no, he hadn't been in a relationship yet, and didn't have friends, was mostly isolated with video games until he was 18 - I was 23, and had a limerent object at the time, so was able to fake normal human feelings for a short while - nobody who's not that young and impressionable would fall for me at 33, because it's clear how broken I am).

Anyway, back to the point - like, if you don't usually eat stuff high in sugar, and you suddenly find yourself with a slice of birthday cake (let's gloss over the fact I buy myself a birthday cake and eat it every two months or so although I've missed my birthday month last year) - high in sugar, oh my, that stuff is amazing, I'll eat it everyday, for every meal. But after a while, it just makes me feel really sick. It's not that sugar doesn't give me a rush, it's just that only a certain amount of it gives the benefit, after that it just starts to cause problems.

Similarly, maybe even if I were to be magically cured of 18 years of direct abuse, another 10 years of remote daily manipulation and emotional guilt tripping, and 33 years of mistreatment/ignoring/rejection/abandonment in terms of friendship and love, and somehow could dupe another person into loving me, would it really solve my problems? Or would the magical cure of the emotional damage itself be the dramatic change, and the love would just be like a sugar rush - great in small doses, otherwise it just makes you feel shit?

Heck, does it matter? I'm just a corpse waiting for some technicalities to be sorted out so I can sleep."

And I honestly thought it might translate into something changing, just because I felt like for a second I could hold it all in my mind.

This isn't exactly how I did it, but my advice would be to go over to /r/sexworkers and ask some questions. If you're in a major city you should be able to find some in/near your area on slixa.com. Follow some with a burner Twitter account and then you'll find others in your area that don't advertise on slixa- they all support and promote each other.

Yup, this is what really hurts, never experiencing how it feels to like someone or being with someone that likes you back and actually wants to hug, kiss or look at you.

You're right the vast majority of men have this and it's something normal and mundane and they don't realize how lucky they're."

I know there's a general ""I'll never get to experience this ever"" kind of mentality in this sub (unless something's changed from the time I was frequent here) but it might get hard trying to hide your past sexual experiences from a partner you might have. Not that I have any experience with this (I'm FA as fuck), just going off the fact that most women are not gonna respect and wanna be with a man who seen prostitutes. I half regret seeing them (only half cause it was still pretty awesome. I got to practice some stuff and make a few working girls actually happy without faking it).

You follow the advice of bettering yourself, working out, becoming a well-rounded person etc. and you have so much energy and hope, but trying these things and realising they do not work makes you feel hopeless. You try again and again in the hope that it will be different this time, but eventually you lose sight of the point and feel like the game is rigged.

I did not come into the world hating everything and feeling like everything is hopeless. Reality came first, and the attitude followed, not the other way around. I really wish people would understand this. I am ashamed that I have fallen this far but at the same time it all feels inevitable and that there wasn't a single thing I could've done that would've made things turn out differently. And I know I will get people coming in here telling me that I need to keep trying and dusting myself off until I am successful, but I don't want to do that anymore. I have been bruised and beaten down by the world so many times that there's no longer any incentive to keep trying anymore, so all I do now is drudge through my day hoping that some magical moment will happen, but it never will, so I have to make peace with this mediocre reality in the best way that I possibly can until I end up killing myself (which I won't, because I couldn't even achieve that).

My entire life is a dead end. I have no romantic prospects, and nearly 25 years of being ignored by women in real life and online is testament to this. Every hobby I partake in I suck at, my body responds poorly to exercise, nothing in my life ever gains traction, and there's no hope for the future. I am stuck in retail job after retail job despite growing up getting good grades, getting my head down and staying out of trouble, behaving well in class, getting a degree from a good university, and being told by everyone that I am smart, will have an excellent future ahead of me and will be successful. Turns out that all of that work at school and university was useless, because with my jobs I haven't used a single qualification of mine. Retail jobs don't give a shit what grades you got, in fact the application for my last job didn't even ask for my grade performance. Then I see people who fucked around in school with successful lives. It makes me think that I should've just fucked around in school, maybe I wouldn't be here and I'd have a wonderful girlfriend with a promising career.

Putting your hand on a hot stove teaches you to not get burned, however everything in life for me feels like a hot stove. No matter what I do, I get burned. Eventually you just give up on cooking and life itself and do nothing to improve your situation because nothing else has helped. Then you end up miserable, complaining to people you've never met before because the people you grew up with can't relate because they ended up successful and moved on with their lives, feeling perpetually 16 but 25 at the same time, feeling like you're waiting on a train that isn't coming, feeling like a gypsy placed a cursed on you, but most of all feeling like this is entirely your own fault."

What is it that you studied?"
throaway2s1fsfsf4,fdqzeax,t1_fdqdidt,"Not OP, but during my first job (summer retail job) I had a colleague with a master of modern litterature that had been working there full time for three years. The guy was pretty smart and hard working, but he just couldn't find a job after graduating so at some point he had no choice but to accept a minimum wage job. At least where I live, if you have a liberal arts degree it can be extremely hard to find a job and unfortunately this is something that most people only find out after they start college or even only after finishing their studies as crazy as it sounds."
SURPRISEMFKR,fdrgsl5,t1_fdqzeax,"Hell, I will get sorta computer science degree from decent university this year and it doesn't look that great when you just aren't talented. Guys who are great at coding got scooped up fast, I work in min-wage job while studying at the same time. I did get lots of great grades and should graduate just fine, but I just can't force myself to learn actually useful stuff on my own, rendering my studies not super useful."
AngreyDoomer,fdt3uyk,t1_fdrgsl5,I have an engineering degree in automation and informatics and I only did bullshit part time jobs until now. I am 2 years out of school and now I am unemployed. I haven't even tried to go to a real job interview because I have zero  confidence in myself. I barely learned anything practical at school and I feel like any zoomer kid is better with computers than me.
bitter_and_alone,fduv54f,t1_fdt3uyk,What helped me in getting over that phase between education and job was by treating résumés as advertisements and interviews as acting.  May be that is something worth trying?

&#x200B;

but isnt it hilarious when people who dont know what depression and anxiety is, say to you ""just go out and find yourself a girl"" OH FUCK I LOVE IT HOW COME I DIDNT THINK OF THAT; THANKS!

my life has been a downward spiral ever since i graduated, i started isolating and whoopity whoop, here we are, years later im this 24 year old with a mentality of a 19, i missed the most crutial years of adulthood, i saw my old friends and peers try and do shit with their life, the nerds, the losers, bums, EVERYONE ended up somewhere, my bully from elementary is having the time of his life, my bully from the last year of high school is a professional footballer and makes more money in 3 months than i make in a year in construction

&#x200B;

ever since i came out of years long isolation i've tried being positive and just trying life again, working out has been good but the positivity of it really faded with time, having a good body doesnt mean shit if youre still socially retarded around girls, all i have is porn addiction, existential crisis from all those years i spent alone

&#x200B;

the older i get the more i realize its really fucking hard to jump on that train everyone else is on, im very behind them in everything, i havent even gotten my drivers license when most of my old buddies have a car, i've had numerous failed attempts with girls over the last 2 years because i have zero game and being weird is only cute in movies, this is ugly reality, nothing else, i fucking hate everything about my life but im too much of a pussy to dig myself out of it, tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away"
DualX1,fdr5sp3,t1_fdqqbiq,"To be honest, stop trying to jump on the train everyone else is on.
You are not them and your life will not follow the same path.
Every day: think about what makes you happy. Think about what you enjoy. And if there is nothing, search for it. Think about where your talent lies.
When you know: go do that thing. Make yourself happy by doing. Achievement feels great but the effect is fleeting. Push yourself to become happy be doing something instead of achieving something."

A century ago OP's behavior would have resulted in a wildly successful and happy life.  I bet OPs grandpa would be very happy with OPs behavior and mystified why that virtuous behavior resulted in a lifetime of suffering.

In the long run, either society will be forced to change direction such that ""following the rules"" will start to work again, or, what passes for a society in the future will have a replacement set of rules that look very uncivilized compared to today's supposed rules for success."

DualX1,fdr6x52,t1_fdqikv5,"Despite what a lot of people tell you, success does not lie in achievement nor relationship. It is okay to long for that and it is great to strive for that. But success is setting one step in the direction of leading a happier life. Even eating a chocolate to do so can help in that regard.

Learning and importance is what gives happiness for most people. They become happy when they have a positive impact on the world around them or when they feel they have learned. Try to trigger yourself to do both of those things as often as possible.
Become the one who holds the door open and creates a positive impact. Not because of what they other will think of you, but because you enjoy impacting others.
Become the one who reflects on your failures. Not because you want to tell yourself how bad you did, but because you want to do better next time."
BrokenBearz,fdqf61b,t3_empyhy,"It'll be like that huh? Of course we had hopes when were born but eventually everything keeps falling apart and some of us developed an auto defense mechanism that's straight up telling us the things we want to do is not going to work.

After countless attempts and head to the wall said mechanism become so potent that it just shove people away. I'm in that spot now and I sometime can't even put together a coherent sentence to express myself. I wonder if I'll lose the ability to speak to a cashier if this goes on."
MDR4,fdqhlbn,t1_fdqf61b,"Same here man, at about 19 I got to a point where i started pushing people away without really meaning too.  After so many negative experiences socially and romantically it just became a defense mechanism, almost reflexive.  For me FA at 25 feels like a prison more than anything.  I’d like to escape it but I’m so far behind my peers and lacking in experience that I wouldn’t know where to begin.  Feels like all I can do is find other things I enjoy to distract me and make the prison more comfortable."

Everyone treats me condescendingly, like an infant, or doesn't pay attention. Women look at me as a lost friend or a ""man-child"" and that's the truth.

Welcome to my life, very similar. That's powerful, I tried a lot but whether it's a health issue, hard mental barrier, or the world telling me no to everything I want to do. One of my favorite quotes I apply to my life all the time is ""Always the hard way."" because nothing ever goes smoothly to a comical degree. Me and my family are cursed, I feel there's just no other explanation sometimes. Reality slapped me in the face when I was far younger being FA was just one of the resulting cherries on top of the shit sundae. Ironically cooking is one of the only things I'm good at but I'm too slow and it's too much for me to handle in a professional environment mentally at once. I can't even drive so my options are even more limited in life. I like working in restaurants the best though doing random back end stuff but I'm stuck in retail cause no one really needs me in those places and kicked me out. I'm not falling for the schooling trap cause I know just what will happen. It'll rob me of the money I built up over the past couple years that may give me a couple years at most on my own so it's almost useless unless by some miracle I can live here for a 6-7 years more and save but by that point I'll probably be so old I would barely see the point anyways at the most positive with another issue being my family or what's left is only getting older and unhealthier. Even at work I feel I'm kept around just because I'm the guy who does every other tedious thing with the stock or back room stuff that no one else wants to deal with and always stay extra hours when asked. Plus it's retail, I can be replaced at any time when they get tired enough of me."
shavenbaboon,fdrexxc,t3_empyhy,One of the truths that i have come to time and time again is that life is pain. I've tried to find things that would make me happy but i just keep coming back to that.

I've been deep into manosphere. First I was reading and watching every MGTOW content out there.

I still follow several channels on YT...but once that content raised a fire of dissatisfaction in me, dissatisfaction of  how modern women are...now I'm just jaded and accepting of it.

That’s just a byproduct. Why did I aswell as being deformed have to have a speech impediment. Why did I also have to have panic disorder as well as hyperhydrosis which made the physical symptoms of anxiety visible via excessive facial sweating in  classrooms which led to me failing to graduate due to never turning up. Why did I also have to have a life of constant bad luck. Constant bad news. I don’t get it. No therapist in the world can help, I need a scientific answer at this point. I cannot rationalise this.

The more I live, the more I hate. When ""the world"" hurts me I feel sad, but depending on what hurts, I feel hate towards me for being weak and dumb, towards those who hurt me. All I can do is curse them all and implode. I have exercise a great deal of control not to explode on every human around, for I don't want to hurt the undeserving.
I have found in fantasy the escape I need to endure the pain, games, books you name it, they are my painkillers. But, it is still there, the thing inside me still stirs in the prison.

My friend, I can't possibly know your pain, I am but another broken being, I can only relate. But a word of advice, find yourself something to hold on, something that will make you smile or laugh, it helps to ease things. And above all else, keep your demons on a leash, least they control you."

I have to go back and finish off my 6 month course that i did last year because i didn't finish everything but i don't mind doing that. 

I feel like i am still 16 though also feeling like i'm a lost and confused 16 year old. That is something a girl wouldn't want but it doesn't matter anyway since little to no girls have ever shown interest in me as i'm short and ugly. Being on and off for Tinder for the past 5 years has given me so little as well. Most girls also just seem to be cold and disinterested when i talk to them.

BrazilianLambda,elt1w8,top_level,"Your personality is a direct product of your life experience. If you were bullied, rejected, ostracized, called 'ugly', etc, it's very likely you will be sad, angry, and depressed. You can't just create a new personality out of thin air. That's not how it works. But, go ahead, normies, say something like ""I hAvE a fRienD wHo goT buLLied and he OK"". Your friend, if he/she exists, is probably masking his contempt for the world because society tells him to do so. I have to pretend that I am fine too when I am out in society, because otherwise the consequences are going to be detrimental to me."
RedClaw234,fdk5aom,t3_elt1w8,"Honestly I agree with you, you can't create a new personality and to use it, your personality contain your life and this can't be changed ever if you try to lie yourself, and be sure if you create one you can't delete the original one so not matter what you do or how much personalitys you create your depression and all won't leave you sadly, also you can get problems if you create a new personality and if you fake yourself for all the people to think that your fine it not good"
florencesusi,fdk5yj3,t3_elt1w8,"We are the sum total of our life experiences. We dont have as much control as we like to.think we have. To force a 'new' personality would be very tiring and we could never keep it up anyway. Normies dont do that. I know Normies with horrible personalities anyway. And how weird to be happy and confident if we dont feel it.

Now I am happy and confident. But FA KV and 63. My happiness and confidence comes from doing things to help others.  That's all. And my Piano Lessons too. I used to overeat to distract myself but I found music lessons and orphans filled the gap for me. 

I am joyful now. NOTE  still fa kv
I have.nice new.clothes
I have nice new hair

Dont expect any of the above to.change the FAKV status."

another30yovirgin,fdltq7o,t3_elt1w8,"Yeah, people seem to forget that we're all different and we all react to things differently. One person can be bullied and teased as a child and take that experience and become a Fortune 500 CEO. Another person might have that experience and end up as a drug addict. Both people can be right that their experience affected them and led to them becoming the people they are now. So the fact that someone else experienced something and it didn't have the same effect on you doesn't mean that the effects you felt aren't real or that you should just be like that other person. That's like putting bread in the refrigerator and saying ""well, the other machine made it into toast--why can't you?"""

torqonudho,fdl8mnm,t3_elt1w8,"There is a misconception here. No one can get a new personality,but we have this weak, unshaped personality. Look at us, all we can say about ourselves is bad stuff. Some of us have been unsocializing and isolated so hard for so long, they just became  ""real life spectators"", which means having no personality at all. 

We cannot get a new personality, we can only improve it. And since its a social thing, we would need a good and accepting social environment. Thats where the real problem begins.  And the worst part is that its  perceived like its our fault, to not having guts to socialize etc. but not actually."
Erramayhem89,fdlgkwy,t3_elt1w8,It's also dependent on your environment and how you feel around those people. If you are around weirdos and people you don't like you aren't going to have a good personality.
jbain101,fdlii37,t3_elt1w8,"I ended up getting a new personality. Although I doubt you'd want to take the same approach to getting one. I always feel like I've lived two lives. I'm the person I am now and I was the person I was before the car wreck. I took an awful lot brain damage and it changed me. It's hard to describe but I was a totally different person back then. It's not like I gained a new perspective. It's more like I got a reboot. And that other guy is just a memory. Although in the end I gained mood swings, seizures, and random memory loss.

GermanWok,fdmntos,t3_elt1w8,"I agree that you cannot ""get"" (which means: fake) a new personality. But you can ""grow"" one, you can to a certain degree change which experiences you make, and how you respond to them. You can learn not to give a damn about toxic people. You can learn to get out of your comfort zone. Of course this is easier said than done, and it is as harder as shittier your start position is."
SnootyPretzel,fdkr88q,t3_elt1w8,You can't get a new personality but you can cultivate self-awareness and target your shortcomings with the purpose of improving yourself. It won't happen overnight but it's not impossible either. The mind is a muscle that will do the things you tell it to do after continued enforced practise. It's a matter of whether or not you are willing to take action despite your lizard brain telling you that it's a meaningless effort every step of the way.
mad-flower-power,em35r9,top_level,"Like something really bad happening to me and actually having friends who'd support and help me through it. Usually it's about being cheated on, or a breakup - even being in a relationship is such an alien thought, that if I ever got into one it would be feasible to imagine I'd also have a supportive circle of friends.


I wish I had that, because have so much shit happening in my life right now, and no one to talk about it to, it's becoming a bit overwhelming. I can't even share my problems with my family, because they'd think I'm a loser and it's all my fault - which isn't incorrect tbh. I'm mostly fine during the days, but at nighttime it really hits. The loneliness, the stress, the fear of the future, everything. I cry myself to sleep most nights... Yet I wake up in the morning like everything is fine, only to repeat the cycle the following night."
Bekiala,fdm9pw0,t3_em35r9,"Yep, going through a tough time by yourself makes it 10x harder.  And I personally find it worse when it is my own fault.  I  would much rather have someone to blame it on (I know not admirable but this is how we humans are.)

kikii07,fdmsu38,t3_em35r9,I could have written this post to be honest.

Alph_A__,fdo0kg9,t1_fdmhk93,"I tried a therapist about two months ago. It's obviously the only real ""solution"" people mention when you ask for help for social and mental issues.

Gave up on that track real quick."
nawal86,fdo10g7,t1_fdo0kg9,"I'd recommend looking up attachment theory and mirroring. What your monkey brain needs is to see somebody else listen to your story, and be shocked by it, agree that you've been through a lot, and help you find peace in your everyday life. That person is usually going to be a therapist, and it could take a few tries to get to the one with enough experience and skill to know what you need.

I wish I had found the one I went to like ten years earlier. At the time I had some useless ones that put me off the whole thing, and I wasted ten years and lost my one chance at love, who gave me a reason to want to get better - but it was too late for me."

Some people have even thought that my 17 year old sister was older than me.

I might have one in my post history somewhere, but don't look at the one from about a year ago. I've lost like 35-40 pounds since then. But if I was to post my picture I'd want some opinions from the women of this sub and not guys, so I can find out what the fuck is wrong with me."

ella101,fe2gaj8,t1_fe1dch6,I saw you pic. You do not look that young. I happen to notice all you do is post and cry that nobody likes you.  You have to like yourself first. You are too obsessed with finding a gf. Perhaps that is what turns them off.  Be more into yourself. Your hobbies. Stop constantly searching her out.  Don’t be desperate. It smells bad from a mile away.
lulala112,fe2bbj4,t1_fe1dch6,"I looked at the pic and I wanna say you’re not unattractive, and this is coming from a woman"
jokingexplorer,fe4h7j6,t1_fe2b9fa,This is only true for maybe 30+ or 35+. Looking like a teenager when you are in your mid twenties sucks.
SpiritualHealing8,fe23b4v,t1_fe1zz7j,True Ima turn gay after seeing that pic uwu.
Hellblade999,fe2ix0e,t1_fe2gaj8,"I see where your advice comes from but let me tell you this. 

Firstly I have focused on my hobbies. I exercise, I write a lot, I read a fair bit, I’ve joined clubs, I go out to bars by myself, I play video games and watch films, amongst others. The moment where a woman is supposed to notice this like everyone says it does never happens. I don’t know why this is the case because I don’t act like this in real life. Believe it or not people in person have called me “the happiest guy in the world”. 

If I am not unattractive then fine, but I don’t know how I’m supposed to conclude that I’m not if reality is indicating otherwise. A person who cannot get a job after hundreds of applications will have their confidence knocked, and they will start to feel like they have no value. 

Yes desperation does smell bad, but I don’t know how I will stop wanting a date or sex. I have always been a romantically driven individual, and it’s a curse as much as it is a beautiful thing. Yes I could focus on my hobbies more, but that does not solve the underlying issue at hand."
mcm0313,fe5xckj,t1_fe4h7j6,"Didn’t bother me. I just took it as a compliment - I have extremely good skin, thick hair and a baby face, and none of those are bad things to have. Only time it ever annoyed me was in high school."
Hectorspride,fe2losj,t1_fe2ix0e,"Do not take any advice from females, ever..

You don't have an ""on/off"" switch on your body and people like these would assume you have to like yourself as if it as easy as turning on a radio in an instant.. they don't have any fucking clue about the things you suffer and they think that everybody sees life from their own perspective..

Anyways, I have somewhat a similar history to yours.. I mean about girls not finding you attractive even though some people around you tells you otherwise.. I have learned that I had mental differences than normal people but it was too late and I was already 30+ by that time..

If you have neuro-diversity or any other issues with social skills, not even the girls who like your appearance will approach you or show any interest to you.. that might be the case and you may have to identify your mental problems (if any) primarily and only after that; you may try other things like self improvement and stuff..

Oh BTW, I have dysmorphic body disorder (dysmorphobia if I remember right) and it has caused me to hate my body and hair no matter what positive things people said about my appearance.. you may also want to check if you have it or not.."
JackTheChip,fe6wq34,t1_fe2ix0e,"""The moment where a woman is supposed to notice this like everyone says it does never happens.""

ShortEngineer,fe9ajxm,t1_fe8752c,Yup. 3 hours talking in a bar and didn't even move in for a kiss? You're basically signaling that you don't want to make out / have sex with her.

JackTheChip,fecx8sg,t1_fe9dw3c,"She went home someone so she was clearly in the mood for some action. And it seems like she was single? Given that she was getting along with OP for over 3 hours, why would you assume that's not a sign of interest?"
YeetroyJenkins,fe92fya,t3_eo1vkz,"Look on the bright side. She was probably attracted to you, otherwise she wouldn’t have talked to you for 3 hours. 

What likely happened was that you were too afraid to take the next step and take her back to your place, while trap boy didn’t really care and just went for it and it just so happened to be 3 am

Which leads me to my next point, it’s better to start trying to pull girls back to your place near the end of the night rather than the beginning.  A girl probably won’t wanna leave the club with you at 11 pm, but she might at 2.

Also, the fact that she was there by herself and her friends left her means she was probably trying to get laid."
Illusion911,fe9oe9k,t3_eo1vkz,"You know what I think you did wrong? Nothing. You prepared, and you managed to stay with her for 3 whole hours. Some of us here would be too nervous to even approach the girl, or even if they did get the balls to approach, they'd fall flat in no time. You did nothing wrong

This is about what you didn't do. You were way too slow. 1 hour without doing some moves, moreso during the night, will make her get bored of you quickly. I understand you don't have much experience, neither do I. You failed because you didn't go deep enough.

This is a rich gets richer game, so naturally someone like you and me is going to have a hard time against someone like that guy. Especially in the beginning, this is going to hurt, a lot.

But I know you wouldn't be here if you didn't want to get someone. 
Personally I wouldn't want to die without getting anyone, and I think the same applies to you and I'm happy to see that you went out and took action. 

My advice to you is to:
- Regain your motivation to going out, remember why you're doing this, 
- Accept that this is going to happen more. You're not hopeless, but you're competing against guys severely above you, so remember that this will take a lot of action, time and effort.
- After 20 minutes, ask for the kiss. If she won't kiss you after 20 minutes, she won't kiss you after 200. And remember that asking is better than not doing anything. If you go to a dancing club and you're dancing with a girl, this changes to 2 minutes
- Prepare yourself, at home, come up with a list of what you'd like to try when you go out

Come talk to me if you have any more questions, I'll be glad to help."
Pacman124,fe8mfcx,t3_eo1vkz,"you had nothing to lose anyway, she doesn't look like she's potential gf material to begin with. If you see her next time at the bar, don't engage in anything, just do your stuff with your pals, so you avoid being used once again."
Ramy_91,fe88h8f,t3_eo1vkz,"I don't think this is the kind of girl you want to go for, and the fact that you actually did that proves to me that you will find someone eventually, I'm sure of it. Keep going man we're rooting for you"
stairwaytoheaven333,fe98vmq,t1_fe88h8f,"I agree, thank you!"
dimmu1313,fe93noa,t3_eo1vkz,"The fact that you talked to her at all is a huge win.  The fact that you talked to her for that long (assuming she wasn't just being nice) is monumental.  You have to remember that no one can really help who they're attracted to. It's not anyone's fault that she decided to go home with someone else. Were you talking to her just to get laid or to actually get to know her and hoped to end up dating her/be in a relationship? If it's the latter, than there's nothing to be upset about. Yes it's disappointing to be rejected. But keep in mind if there was something wrong with you as a person, she wouldn't have kept talking to you. So this one was a swing and a miss. Who's to say the very next woman you talk to won't give you her number at the end of the night? Also, I'm confused about you saying you were thinking about kissing her. Wasn't this the first time you met her? This wasn't a date, this was -- at least in her mind, most likely -- a chance encounter. She didn't go there with the intention of meeting you; you had the intention of meeting and talking but before you talked to her I'm guessing she didn't know you even existed. So everything that proceeded was purely on chance, and you really can't have expectations. I actually think if you tried to kiss her that would be super inappropriate. It wasn't a date, it was a person you approached for the first time. Temper your expectations and set smaller goals.  Don't get your hopes up, and accept that simple conversation is a big win and an important first step. And don't take the outcome personally.  You were attracted to her, but didn't even know her."

I wasn’t there, so i can only guess, but my suspicion is what you were lacking was ‘simply’ the skill to deftly direct the conversation (and the tenor of the interaction itself) in a flirtatious direction with gentle teasing / redirecting to or interjecting with ‘light and airy’ comments and observations / subtly or jokingly steering the topics in a more sexual or romantic direction / and paying attention to and using body language to ‘move the interaction along’ in a more polarized male-female direction (ie creating pleasant sexual tension)

A couple of guys I liked ended up in a relationship with female acquaintances. One even knew about it, told him and then he proceeded to reject me in a very ""fake nice guy"" way.

I also did stupid things like pretending I was ""fine"" being rejected and then listen to the guy's sorrow when his affection was unrequited. fun fun fun.

And at least it wasn't a friend, but once at a pub a guy talked to me for like 45 min before asking me for my friend's phone number. I kind of saw it coming and I never met him before so I wasn't crushed or anything but I told him the time he wasted on me could have gotten him said phone number if he had directly talked to her... That taught me a good lesson, in other people's relationships, you never have to play a role you don't want to play."
SlappyBurger,feawbf0,t1_featcyq,That part about pretending to be okay and listening to others issues is true for me as well. I have this happen a lot with another girl I like but was smart enough to tell her about my feelings for her (She said no). Always got some sort of “don’t understand why guys never like me” sort of thing from her and I would always give some normie “there’s somebody out there for you. You just gotta look” response
lnys,feb1bzm,t1_feawbf0,"> pretending to be okay and listening to others

I find it's very common with FA types of people cause many basically don't feel like they should be asking for more than be tolerated around. 

When my ""friends"" were abusing my kindness or being passive-agressive with me, I never really thought about putting an end to it cause somehow I thought I was lucky to have friends - even if in the end they didn't like me for me, but for what I did for them. I was a good listener, I was always there to help, and since I had no self-respect they could cancel at the last minute or ditch me for cooler people and I was like ""oh sure no worry, I understand"". 

Nevertheless it's good to tell what you feel/what you expect. People can say yes or no, but at least you're rid of that gnawing ""what if"". Don't be afraid of putting your interest above others' and of disengaging when you're asked something that would be detrimental to you."

But in the future always remember that if a girl likes you, you're gonna know.

And if there's no obvious touching, flirting, playfulness, or even just something as seemingly harmless as telling you to do anything that requires touching her (they'll do something like ask you to feel her newly shaved legs or smell her washed hair), then she's not into you like that.

My parents knew eachother since childhood. Their parents did too. All my siblings are married and have known their partners since they were at most 12. I literally speak to no one. How am I supposed to be convinced that the perfect someone is some stranger who lives miles away from me?

nawal86,fdutyhw,t3_en2h35,"The idea... Is false. There's no two way about it. Nobody goes from no social life to married without going through having a social life. Attractive people and normies, I've come to realise, have so many options that they can afford to hang out with people they are somewhat attracted to without becoming clingy or bitter/jealous, so they keep in touch with people that they might have been interested in but were rebuffed by, or that they've rejected a closer relationship with. So they always have people their own age that they might have dated in other circumstances, but for now can afford to just spend time with and bond over other things like sports, hobbies, etc.
For me, back when I still tried to make friends or find dates, it was really crushing to be rejected by 100% of the people you meet in a given group, and yet watch them pair up in every possible combination over the years, while I'm clearly undesirable. So of course the moment somebody is nice to me I got overly attached and when somebody rejects me, I found it really hard to be sensitive and supportive when they bragged about their exploits or whinged about their dates not being perfect.

I've done it so much in my life... I'm in Massachusetts and people here are rude as fucking hell. I wouldn't be in a relationship with these people here.

I mentioned to this last therapist I might want to take a Martial art but felt like I was met with a blank stare and pity. I have coordination issues with my left side due to my disability. I always wanted to be doing martial arts when I was a kid but couldn't because of health issues.
vcardthrow1,fdynq51,t3_en2h35,"You're not wrong.

That's actually why it's hopeless. 

Online dating is for people who are very good at in-person dating since you are judged by the same criteria - looks, your job, you hobbies, your life experiences and hobbies. It's incredibly alienating for fa's and introverted types because you are meeting someone you have no history with, have never known in a neutral context, and who can ghost you even when you have feelings for them. 

I have accepted I am going to die alone as someone who is ugly in person, beaten-in-face-with-frying-pan ugly in photos, and a complete loser on every count. More than that - I want to get to know someone as a friend first. 

...But FAs do not make friends. 

Even worse as an adult, by a certain age, all your opposite sex ""friends"" are paired off (and would never date you anyway!)

I won't even touch how terrifying and horrible the thoughts of sex/being naked are"
lfbaldo,fdw1n67,t3_en2h35,It's all a numbers game. Let me tell you: It's harder to find a SO as an adult than as a teenager.
cryptic_egg,fduwcgy,t3_en2h35,"Our social circles shape a large amount of our presence in the world. In spite of what the optimists may say, sadly you can't build an amazing personality alone. Your personality is something that exists between you and other people, so unless you already have good social circles, developing it is hard. You can't just decide to be a fun person.

The only easy time in your life to start with social circles is when you're young, when the dynamic between people really is random strangers talking to each other other. Unfortunately, by the time you're an adult, socialising is more structured between groups, so if you have no friends, making more is hard."

florencesusi,fdvojyq,t1_fduwcgy,Love this. So true. Yes.
cryptic_egg,fdz2va8,t1_fdyohnk,"As much as I'd like to say ""it gets better"" I can't, because it doesn't always get better. As people get older, the social dynamic changes. The fun days of meeting random new people fade as more people your age are settled into relationships and families, and the more stable people become, the less room they have for new, exciting and risky interactions with strangers; people meet, but the interactions are passing exchanges rather than strong investments.

It's a sad life, but we can still try to be optimistic in our own ways. We just can't lie to ourselves and claim that social skills are a switch waiting to be flipped, because they're not."

back when i was in high school and constantly surrounded by people im friends with, ppl i hate, ppl that dont even know me, it doesnt matter, i was a part of something and in the back of my mind i always knew there was a relationship that could happen because it seemed possible... because, well... it was,

 now after being alone for so long, after having experienced so much pain, loneliness, poverty, family issues and what not i just find it hard to just go out there and meet someone out of the blue, i mean it happens but im way too awkward and always say the wrong things and 1st impressions are important

That empty feeling in your stomach, and the regular reminders of just how alone you are courtesy of an empty apartment and dry phone fade into the background. Ever present but not intrusive. Like when a smoker sits in your car. You can always smell it right when you get into your car for days afterword but it fades just as quick. It's not fun but it's bearable. And then it happens. You meet someone or someone sees you a little differently and the lights go up and you start to feel hope and you forget all about the smoker smell as it's replaced in your head with the scent of her/his/their perfume, and all seems to fall into place. Until it doesn't. Interactions are fewer, messages fewer still. They lift out as quick as they came in. And now you're back where you started, but it's different this time. That empty feeling is no longer the dull ache you tolerated, but jarring agony as your hopes and desires meet your reality once again. That empty bed that seemed too small when you last slept together now threatens to swallow you whole, every vibration or chime sending your pulse racing as you hope and pray to all your god/s ""please let it be someone"" just to sigh in resignation that once again the only updates you get come from reddit and unnecessary work emails, and it fucking sucks.

but most of ppl just stumble upon.. well.. this

i am sorry this happened i know how shitty that feels, i felt that very early on

&#x200B;

i was still in high school, i remember my 1st meet with a shrink/doctor/therapist/psychologist whatever you wanna call it, it was good for 2 sessions, we just had a talk about stuff, i remember feeling like i was in a prologue of a game, like ""okay this is gonna set the mood and im gonna be better in real life"" idk if that makes sense but i was passed on to a different psychiatrist because the 1st one was for like for pre teens or teens and shit, and i was 17, like yeah thats much older

the 2nd one was in a whole fucking different part of town and was a mean bitch, she was this fat 30 something lady that literally laughed out loud in front of my mom when i told her certain stuff, like how the fuck you react with laughter when a kid says that he fees like never going back to school again or that he feels really guilty for no reason or that he has no motivation or ambition to do school work and pass grades, she was just totally weirdly uninterested and unprofessional, constantly saying shit like ""don't worry it happens to everyone, its nothing special"", ""you have to work it out, you just have to put some thought into it"" , long story short the next year i simply had to leave school because it was t*hen* a peak of my depression, 

no worries i came back and graduated on time eventually, missed out on 3-4 months only but i needed that to refresh, after many days of boredom and riding around with friends and smoking weed and many fights with my parents i came to conclusion that i just gotta finish that school shit because well it would be extremely fucking stupid to quit couple of months before graduation

&#x200B;

i havent visited a shrink until like years later even tho i had severe depressive episodes, anxiety and it basically just got worse since i was isolating myself, that visit was in 2017 and it was only for 2 sessions and it made me feel a bit better, i dont really remember all of the things we talked but it helped me get back on track, that summer i dodged out on 4 jobs and really embarrassed my mom for one because it was some big deal y'know, she had a friend in a high place in some company...  i remember the most important thing that therapist said to me, ""you can always quit a job, but you'll never get the same opportunity to try it, it is very important to try, who knows maybe you wont like it but maybe you end up liking it, maybe there is a person with the same sense of humor as you, you dont know until you try it"" not the exact same words but the point remains and i tell it sometimes to myself"

When I used this shitty app I had only one match and it was from a bot I guess because she never replied back. I know Tinder is shallow af but man life is so cruel to us FAs. The difference between him and me is that he was a white, tall, social and outgoing guy while Im a shy, introverted and small Asian dude. Its not like hes a chad but hes not ugly either. Before he left he said that he could not decide whether he want to meet one of his Tinder matches or sit at home watching a Vikings. I said I preferred the first choice but he just couldnt decide. During break a female colleague mentioned that she had a ex boyfriend my first thought was like 'Yeah, fuck my life!!!'. Can somebody just put a bullet in my brain already so that I dont have to endure this shitshow called life anymore. Hell, I would even pay for it."

I have no business dating a 10 out of 10 so what this means for me in a large city is basically hours of left swipes until I get down to the level of women who might be willing to talk to me (and I gave up before I got that far),

We discussed a lot about that problem together many times. But after week or two, they forget about it. 

Today I decided to tell them that I'm leaving and they started attacking me with words like ""It's all your fault we forget"" or ""We want to solve this but you don't"". Yeah right guys - I said. Then I left.

I'm not that type that needs attention, but when you have friends that supported you a lot and then they act like nothing happened it hurts a lot.

Maybe that's my life. Being 21 years old kissles virgin without friend living the same day everyday just waiting for someone that don't exist.

Sorry for my grammar btw. Peace."

blazedchu420,fe5cz8e,t1_fe2idxd,I've even tried rekindling those relationships but they were still toxic. Some people just have no self-awareness and aren't worth the investment.
moodistry,fe2kued,t3_enn6l7,"That happens when I'm depressed.  I become super-sensitive so even the most minor comment or failure to stay in touch will trigger me, and I'll ghost my friend for a while.  I'll decide that I'm not going to reach out (I imagine they'll be hurt by this) and instead let them reach out when they realize they hurt me and want to prove their friendship again.  I get bitter and vindictive.  It feels horrible.

And the really horrible thing is that because I'm depressed it is when I most need connections to people to keep from committing suicide.  It is very common for depressed people like me to socially isolate, and far more likely for socially isolated people to kill themselves.  Last time I went through this I got really close to offing myself.

I'd be easy to say ""just let them know you need help"" but my friends know perfectly well I'm going through shit, and they still don't give me the attention and support that I need and want.  They give me some, but it doesn't feel like enough - it isn't enough.  But I have to realize that all my friends (middle aged adults) are going through their own emotional/psychological shit, and they're dealing with kids and parents, jobs, spouses, etc.  Everybody has their shit going on.  I tell myself that over and over when I'm having a freak-out over how I feel mistreated.

I think it's great your friends fought for you when you said you're leaving.  Even if they were all defensive and shit, they were showing some real love.  They don't want it to end.  I personally know it hurts a lot when a friend ""breaks up"" with you.

I'm 53 and I have a couple of friendship that are 25 years long - I met them when I was about your age.  Those friendships are so precious to me in a way that new friends are not.  If you can, make the kind of friends today that you can keep for a life time, and nurture those friendships carefully."
TypeVirus,fe2k4hc,t3_enn6l7,"Having no friends is bad, but it's healthier than having toxic ""friends"". Sorry to hear your problems, mate.

I have three people I can call friends in my life, all carryovers from secondary school, and we don't see each other nearly as much as we'd like because our lives get in the way. Haven't made a new friend in over a decade. Modernity seems to be anathema to making friends."

I woke up one day and said to myself, ""How long will it take one of them to message me?"" Not one of them tried to contact me. That was 10 fucking years ago.

It just goes to show that true friends will ride it out with you no matter what. It also goes to show that if you are socially inept — you could even be a slightly unsociable person — then you will likely end up alone and miserable."

Vanaroth,fe5zh29,t3_enn6l7,"I had a lot of toxic friends who would ""forget"" me. I was always the type to forgive and forget, but as it got worse, that changed. Eventually, one by one, something truly bad would happen, and they would become dead to me. 

What I mean by that is, I don't hate them, I won't go out of my way to hurt them or be rude. But it's like they're dead, I won't talk to them, acknowledge them, or think of them. A couple apologised, which is great and appreciated, but I've decided those kind of people aren't worth it. 

It sucks being alone, but honestly I'm doing better than when I had toxic friends who made me feel like I wasn't worth the time or effort. It's better to be alone, but know who are and what you stand for, than to be around people who make you question if you should change to suit them."

_prowler,fe44lrh,t3_enn6l7,"Two years ago i had to close friends. Suddenly their behaviours changed towards me. They started to behave coldy. Unfortunately i was having tough times with my best friend and my so-called boyfriend. I needed support. Once i offered them to go out. They usually would accept but they found really stupid excuses. It was the time that i thought i was really alone. After few days they ignored me at school. I decided to end my friendship with them because it was exactly the right thing to do. I ended everything with a text. Guess what? She didn’t say anything. I thought she loved me but i was wrong. After months I learned some stuff about my best friend i mean her lies. I had trust issues. Her lies were the main problem of our friendship. She consistently made promises about this issue but her lies never came to an end. This friendship was becoming more painful for me. There was only one choice. Ending my friendship so i lost my best friend too. In the end i was all alone.                                                 

The point is the sooner you cut off toxic people from your life the better you will feel. You did the right and don’t worry you won’t be alone always. Of course you will find better friends for you. Just be patient, don’t feel hopeless. We are here to support you. You can pm me if you want and you can pour out your heart to me."
pedalgep,fe4ift2,t3_enn6l7,"I used to have two close friends. They've been around since I was 15 or something like that and we were *actually* good friends. When I was 25 I noticed that they don't really seek my company anymore, unless they needed something from me, so I decided not to initiate anything. If they'd call to meet up or hang out, etc. that's cool, but I won't take the first step.. I had to see how it goes.

Haven't heard from them in 6 years. I often think about reconnecting with them, but.. there is no fucking point anymore. Sorry OP, I know what's it like but it's going to be even worse as the years pass.

Not always, but it's a common enough reaction to be considered likely and normal.

People really shouldn't seek to understand human attitudes from self selecting reddits groups. Most mature women are mature enough to realise that being experienced is not as important as being present, or considerate, etc, when it comes to being ""good"" in bed - sex is not a skill to be mastered and (beyond the basics) everyone who takes sex seriously with a new partner should approach it as a novice anyway.

This is where you're dead wrong, and this is where so many male virgins get it wrong and end up destroying a potential relationship. Women are massively turned off by men being a virgin. Especially if you're well in to adulthood. Even if she really likes you she will be massively turned off. She might still choose to be with you, but it's likely that she won't, even if she gives a different reason for it.

It's not about conscious thoughts about how good or bad someone will be in bed, it's about subconscious female instinct."
CoveredinCoconutOil,fdodgxk,t1_fdo9l8g,"See my post above.

Even if what you say was true (which it isn't) I don't give a fuck. I'm not a virgin. I'm hugely inexperienced (effectively a virgin, technically not). And I'm too old to give a fuck about what women think or don't think about it. If a woman had an issue with it, she can fuck off out of my life. If I had any suspicion it was an issue for her, fine, she can leave without a word and I'll go see an escort instead. At that level of moronism it's all the same to me. I'm not interested in changing myself for anyone, or being something I'm not, or hiding my awkwardness and fear to placate small, feeble minds. 

I know that I would be the best lover she'd ever had - if she gave me a chance to mount a few hurdles and overcome my anxieties. And if she doesn't, because of what others might think about it all? Fine. Don't care. I've no time for it. She can go back to tedious 2 minute sex with her semi literate hook ups and she is the one who has missed out. Not me. I would have spared myself wasting my limited time here on earth in the bed of a retard. I don't need a gf. I don't need sex. I don't need anyone. And anyone who wants to belittle me can jump under a bus for all they matter to me. I'm not pandering to stupid people with their stupid social scripts. 

Thankfully, none of that would apply to the type of women I am interested in, as some women genuinely do not mind if a dude is inexperienced, as men do not mind if women are.

If a woman chooses to not be with me *because of who I am*? Fine. Go. Leave. Stop wasting my time."
wph95,fdp2mwv,t1_fdodgxk,"I mean that's fine, I fully understand and respect your stance on this, but for a guy looking to actually get a girlfriend it would a highly self-destructive mentality.

Also - what I said *is* categorically true. Women are hugely turned off by male virgins, more so than almost any other trait. This largely is not because they think they will be bad in bed, but is instead due to the simple fact that they are a virgin. There are both sociological and instinctive reasons for this.

There are *countless* stories of male virgins who've hit it off very well with a woman and built a legitimately great connection with her, who then get rejected after revealing their inexperience, who probably would have gone on to have a great long-term relationship with her had they chosen to keep it a secret for a little while longer. I know anecdotes aren't the most reliable source, but this situation consistently comes up whenever male virgins talk about their experiences in dating, this kind of reaction is very common and not some kind of rare exception like yourself and others bizarrely seem to think."

A  lot average, otherwise nice enough seeming gals  still see  limited experience in an older man as an indicator of something  off:  At the very least an inability to connect or function within adult relationships, something they're less likely to have much patience for as years pass.

I also remind myself that he has no use in my life - except as material to use to strengthen my self-control for the ultimate purpose of checking out. My animal substrate has semi-autonomous circuits that think he would make me happy, but I know that he's just meat. So every time I refuse to give assent to these base thoughts, my will gets stronger.

Ultimately, he's just meat under all that pretty exterior. His bowels carry just under a kilogram of shit. His bladder is carrying about half as much piss. His skin is crawling with billions of gross things from bacteria to mites.

Even if he were to find something useful enough from me to love me, as soon as he finds somebody more appealing, he'd move on. Why wouldn't he. He knows his worth, he's been taught that all his life, as have I. And even that only really applies in the \~1/30 chance that he's in fact not straight."

IAmNotZo,fdkwkgl,t1_fdkvq48,"The problem comes when people say omg seeing those beautiful people l can never have hurts so much, but it's because they're shallow and would never accept me. You are acting equally as shallow.  I'm not saying that is wrong, but please don't act like a hypocrite later and say she's with that guy because he's hot."
probablybetternow,fdlivz3,t1_fdkwkgl,"Exactly the annoying part is where they say ""attractiveness is important to dating"" well shit yeah but tbh u dont just decide to date someone just bc of it. Then if the girl/guy is crazy they'd turn to this anti-human and say ""all men/women are crazy!"" Well shit u just dumb and shallow af."
IAmNotZo,fdlj48f,t1_fdlivz3,"I think for some people it is the reason they date. It'll never work out, but that is what some people go for and it's why people cold approach."
Colin_Bowell,fdl7w5o,t3_eluufj,Meh. I'd rather look at less attractive women I know I have a better chance with than lust over 10s I know I could never have unless I was the last guy around. Actually getting a 5 or 6 is way better than wasting time over 9s and 10s who won't even look at me.

guynoirpi713,fdkefws,t3_eluufj,Bro stop trying to get them and just have conversations for the fun of conversation. Like really practice talking to any and everybody guy and girl. Start with guys make observations about things going on around you and then just do that exact same thing with girls without giving a shit what they look like. For real take an improv class.

Bobby_Fingers,fdgduya,t3_el91k7,"Nope, I'm right there with you, but I know they mean well in saying so despite me wanting to tell them they can shove those sentiments right up their ass.

I *wish* I was selling myself short. Hell, I wouldn't even be able to post myself on the free section of Craigslist because I'd still think I'd be asking for too much for myself."

nawal86,fdhl8u7,t1_fdgduya,"I saw a piece of advice on here a while ago that really hit home - don't make your unique product something that you give to people or do for them - make it something that they need you to be there to enjoy it.

I can't personally think of many things - I know people enjoyed my sense of humour back when  I still cared about social contact. But it was never enough for them to make an effort to contact me. I was always the one who had to make plans, rearrange around theirs, etc.

I suppose it basically means ""just jestermaxx bro!"" - but maybe others on here can think of other things..."

Xijit,fdhv7o9,t1_fdhlez1,"Nah, she hated my Ex's cat passionately & I don't want her to go off like that on a kitten: I will wait till it is her time & then get a puppy and a kitten at the same time and raise them together so that I don't have future compatibility issues due to antisocial issue.

For a bit of background: my cat was a rescue & abused by her previous owners (she had a couple and was abandoned at least once) ... She isn't a bad cat, she has just had a lot of trama & flips out into an instant fight or flight mode when she feels threatened (with a heavy inclination towards ""I'm gonna die!!!!"" fight response) ... We didn't know how bad she had it before we got her & there were a lot of rough years getting her stable (my shit relationship with my unstable Ex didn't help). But now she has been doing really good for the last few years & working on not setting her off with my emotions has helped me to be a better/calmer/more aware person.

She isn't a complete free loader either, as she pays attention to my moods and will actively do shit to intervene when my mood starts to spiral / I've had a bad day. I'm not just being a crazy cat-man and assigning human mentality to her typical behavior: she will notice l an getting depressed even before I do and start doing shit she normally doesn't do like getting in my face for attention to distract me & then screaming at me / staring me down if I try to ignore it.

Pets > People."

I started writing with one girl and we quickly got comfortable with each other. We're both in the same league, are of the same nationality, both disabled, both somewhat shy and awkward, and both in college. On Tuesday she asked me if I want to meet up and of course I agreed.

I don't have a car so she picked me up today and we went to the park. We walked and talked about everything and nothing. It was awkward at times but in general it was great. We then went for dinner and it went really well. This time I asked if she wants a second date and she said yes right away. She loves going bowling so on Saturday we'll do that. And that was that.

Imagine feeling lonely and hopeless, trying Tinder just because you've never tried it before, and getting a date out of it almost immediately. Then there's guys like me who have tried seven dating sites, paid for Tinder Gold for over half a year, switched up my profile several times, swiped thousands upon thousands of women, and still cannot get a phone number, let alone a date. Being totally ignored in real life and online has never made me feel more ugly.

Universe, I command you to take pity on me and give me a date. I'm fucking sick of working hard only to get NOWHERE. Just fucking give me one now, you've reduced me to begging. This is a joke at this point.

FriendlyTennis,fdwn8fv,t1_fdu0t5k,"Don't think of it that way. Think of yourself. Once you get one girl, no matter who she is (fat, ugly, single mom, tranny, etc.) It'll be easier to get another. You need to get experience."
LifeSimulacra,en882m,top_level,"Just think about it for a second. We are starved from something common folk get regularly: a sense of belonging, of empathy, of being cared for and respected.

What's better for my confidence and self-worth than someone who loves me for who I am, want to spend their days with me and wants to be with me in the most intimate manners? Isn't this the biggest kind of validation that could exist? Isn't this why people don't usually struggle with self-image and confidence issues? (on the contrary, most are over the top) They don't need to repeat the ""I love myself"" mantra 100 times, because they *know* they can be loved, that they have value and that they're not broken. And they act accordingly, motivated, with a ton of projects.

What's left for us? This feeling of being a broken machine that needs fixing, a constant sense of pessimism after dozens of rejections and going through life without experiencing love or even intimacy. It destroys us. How couldn't it? Tell someone who is in a relationship that they'll have to break up and never find love again, what would they even answer? ""Oh, I'd just lift, get a new hobby, go to therapy""? It would destroy them too, even harder because they know the difference between cuddling and lying alone in bed. Just stop with the lies. People who get partners like it's nothing can't even comprehend the problem and are so accustomed to being appreciated that ""self-esteem"" isn't a word in their vocabulary, they have it incorporated.

Lonely people die earlier, people on the spectrum are mostly alone and die because of suicide in far greater numbers. Self-image is a social construct and your self-perception is socially validated. Why is it so hard to understand? ""Just go out"", where? how? I'm on the edge of the autism spectrum, I can't socialize normally, I overthink and I can't stand most people. I'm a rejection waiting to unfold. And people expect this not to make me bitter, resentful, pessimistic? People keep telling me I should be more motivated, ""live life"". Of course, for them it's like a walk in the park, where they start talking with another person and ""things just happen"", their motivation is not an issue and they are so over the top they can't stop trying to show off. For me it is an insourmountable slope. A life without love is not a live worth living, I'm missing out on so much it's crippling."
rusty_bucket_bay,fdw938r,t3_en882m,"The points that you touched on are the same reason platitudes and phrases dealing with love and relationships are not very useful to people in our situation. In order to fully internalise and understand the point of a phrases such as ""just be confident"" or ""live life"" involves having a handle and experience on all the underlying things that go into such a statement. A person would need to understand the pretence and context in order for those types of phrases and that type of advice to be useful. 

It's like using technical speak to someone who works in your field of expertise. You both have the background knowledge to interpret and contextualise the advice however trite and short it may be. It's the same for people talking about relationships, the advice ""just be confident"" is useful advice but only if both parties understand and have internalised the context and all the underlying assumptions. For people like us we need a phrase like ""just be confident"" to be a title of chapter with clear goals and bullet points explaining all the nuance and assumptions being made. We don't have the background expertise to digest stuff like that in a useful way. 

Furthermore even understanding the logic and meaning behind that kind of advice is itself not a panacea. Advice on relationships cannot merely just be understood on a surface level to be useful they must be internalised and acted out/upon in the real world and adopted as part of ones character. It's yet another barrier to entry to loveless people and an often misunderstood subject for tension between well-meaning people offering help and the frustrated minority of us on the other side."
florencesusi,fdwf12i,t3_en882m,True and I no longer waste my time trying to get my Normies to.understand. They simply cannot. So let it drop.
FailedPrimate,fdy6tpz,t3_en882m,i have no value in general
another30yovirgin,fdyuxe4,t3_en882m,A diamond can exist forever in the ground. It's only valuable when someone finds it. I think a lot of us have value that remains undiscovered.
xKurumiTokisakix,fe59izm,t1_fdyuxe4,Yeah the problem is that it will be undiscovered for the rest of our lives. So why bother?
LifeSimulacra,fdyw468,t1_fdyuxe4,"Then, to the market, the diamond doesn't exist and you can't go there looking to buy things with imaginary or undiscovered treasures, right? Relationships are like this, we can't go looking for one if our value to others is null. Even if we had the idea this value exists, it's meaningless socially speaking. Therefore, what good is your value is it doesn't get you that which you think you desire?"
LifeSimulacra,fdyz3vq,t1_fdywfb0,"Well, dozens of people think differently. They might be too polite to say it but I've been ghosted, rejected, laughted at, etc. Believe me, I really have little to no clue when dating and being attractive. I may improve a little but my personality is such a mess I really don't know where to begin without any kind of reassurance."
another30yovirgin,fdz57sw,t1_fdyz3vq,That's ok. Just because they didn't see it doesn't mean they're right.
TheTatteredOne,fdzk3er,t3_en882m,"Not saying there aren’t perks...but man, I’d much rather have it on my terms"
TheTatteredOne,fdzgz9a,t3_en882m,"The meat of what you’re saying isn’t wrong...

I just strongly feel that, as cruel as the universe can be, there MUST be more features to this game than the romance DLC everyone raves about."
LifeSimulacra,fdzht5x,t1_fdzgz9a,I feel romance is more of a main quest that everyone completes after the tutorial while I can't.
TheTatteredOne,fdzk0ea,t1_fdzht5x,"I know. That is the illusion. 

Tbh, I wouldn’t want it to be my MAIN QUEST anyway. 

Think about it, more money I have to spend on personal upkeep, more money I have to spend on her, less time for me, God forbid she gets pregnant. 

I think a lot of people who’ve made it their main quest end up regretting it. 

Then there are the ones who think they’re living that life, only to realize they were in love alone."
TKKocab,enl77m,top_level,"I had literally told him I liked her, expressed interest in her in front of him, and was talking to him about how I thought she was attractive. This has been the first time in such a long time that I’ve found interest in someone who also seemed to show interest in me, and one of my best friends decided he wanted some pussy so he talked to her behind my back and fucked her. What is the point in talking to girls. What’s the point in having friends for that matter. Why does it seem like the world just likes to tease and torture us. Fuck this shit, I’m out."
asdf1234asfg1234,fe2u6xe,t3_enl77m,Fuck your best friend instead
slycyboi,fe2v2ji,t3_enl77m,"Similar situation but he did it in front of me

Like somehow dudes like that take one night to get a girls pants off but I can’t even get a kiss"
Iamoneperson,fe2zzlh,t1_fe2v2ji,"Shits heartbreaking. People can say it's not a competition all they want. But how can I have anyone if normal every day women give it up to some men so easily, but only want to ""talk"" with me. Tells you everything you need to know really."
slycyboi,fe4uw84,t1_fe2zzlh,"Honestly I don't want to get into some... dangerous philosophy but it honestly feels like women especially are completely dishonest about what they want, like and choose when it comes to sex and relationships. This idea that you need to be a decent person, interesting and worth spending time with outside of sex is proven false if you ask any woman what her exes were like - or any man that actually gets laid on a regular basis. Physically attractive, stupidly confident, manipulative subtle social skills and a douchey attitude are what get you girls not anything that makes for a good partner.

Perfect example is the whole situation around (spoilers if you haven't seen it yet) Star Wars. Rey at the end kisses the MASS MURDERER of all people because he starts pretending to be nice. Not the witty, funny friend who had a crush on her all trilogy, not even the charismatic maverick. The mass murderer who killed people she cared about in front of her and tortured her. Now yeah it's just a movie, but the fact of the matter is that this was pandering to a bunch of fans that wanted this to happen in the first place. Fans who thought the mass murderer was hot. This is mostly young women who find dangerous and threatening men attractive. If we don't acknowledge that most young women have this really dark aspect to their sexuality I honestly don't think we're ever going to solve the problems we're currently facing.

I keep hearing girls like that ""aren't worth my time"" but then who the fuck is? Are all women I ever encounter beneath me? Do I listen to friends saying I'm better than them and go full misogynist or not believe it and conclude there's something wrong with me and I'm just missing some actually worthwhile quality that nobody can figure out?"
TypeVirus,fe2kco2,t3_enl77m,"That person is NOT YOUR FRIEND. Cut him off IMMEDIATELY.

KittyCone,fe1091p,t1_fe0vwh3,This. That guy is not your friend.
BitsAndBobs304,fe3w53j,t1_fe0vwh3,Odds are he was being friendzoned. His friend spared him months of delusion and heartbreak and money sownt being strung along

Dargo117,fe0v7br,t3_enl77m,"I have a cousin like that. Anytime I mentioned someone I was interested in he would make a move first then act like it was nothing. Part of me wants to blame him but I should have learned faster. It's different when related because it's harder to cut them out of your life. At least with this ""friend"" you can do that if you choose to. He broke code. The moment your friend says he has a interest in a girl she becomes unbelievable unless you get his permission. That almost like bro code 101."
BitsAndBobs304,fe3wbte,t1_fe0v7br,"I see you still havent learned, he didn't steal anything from you and he didn't break any code"
bitter_and_alone,fe2o53w,t1_fe0v7br,Can you not turn it on him by mentioning someone who has STDs?
nawal86,fe2mxwd,t1_fe0v7br,"Hah, maybe find somebody you know he really wouldn't like and get him to think you like her?"
Dargo117,fe3z6e5,t1_fe3wbte,"I never said he ""stole"" anything as I did not own them. Bro code is real.. it is like unwritten rules between guy friends. That is a real thing. Sure the code changes with culture and places but some rules are universal."
Dargo117,fe38s7e,t1_fe2o53w,"No, he actually used that once to "" cock block"" me from a girl. She asked me about it and I was generally confused about how I could have a std when I was a virgin. That was a long time ago..."
Dargo117,fe39o6n,t1_fe2mxwd,"He would not care. He has had like 7 or more kids now that started when he was a teenager. We are both around 30 now and his taste in women is different than mine. He is big on drugs and tattoos.. and I am not. Still might be FA but at least a small little part is choice because... I don't do drugs, I find women here will be more attracted with drugs around either selling or using. I'm looking for a potential mother for possible children not an addict. I recently quit smoking cold turkey.. hard thing to do and I gained some weight..but I think it was worth it. :)"
MMMarmite,fe6rjoc,t1_fe38s7e,"Umm, why are you friends with this person?"
Dargo117,fe4g05b,t1_fe42mm1,"Actively lying about another person to fool a girl into liking you is harm. Now days some might even call it rapey. Women are not ""Deals"" that you close on.. they are people... stop placing their value to objects. You make it sound like he took a milkshake I wanted to drink. I liked someone and he went out of his normal way to spread lies about me and build himself up... this was not ""game"" it was simply being an asshole. 

Nowadays I think it was because he was jealous that I was smarter than him... but I was also jealous that he was better being social. Still going against a friend and a bro would be one thing ... it's even worse when it is family."
Dargo117,fe71bid,t1_fe6rjoc,Not friends related. Cousins. It can be either really easy to cut off some family members or really hard.

Iamoneperson,fe4fx4v,t1_fe3eked,"Black belt and state champ from way back in taekwondo... But my autistic self has never actually been able to hit someone. It's some sort of mental block.

missedout505,fe49lx4,t3_enl77m,"That's pretty crappy of your friend to do that. Obviously, there's no calling dibs on a woman, but your friend should've at least had the courtesy to tell you he was interested in her, too.

I've never had these feelings before i felt so valided,i felt happy,i felt hopeful,i almost couldn't believe it was happening 

We were texting all morning arranging to meet up talking about all the stuff we wanted to do together some romantic some raunchy i went to the spot we were supposed to meet to pick her up 

I waited there a bit and continued texting her she kept telling me she wanted to kiss me 

And the second she come up to my car and got a good look at what my face looks like IRL.she gave me an excuse that her work called her in and when i got home i saw she had blocked me it had to be my looks not 3 minutes before she saw my face she was excited to see me and the second she saw my face she wanted nothing to do with me 

Why was i cursed like this did i do something to deserve it did i offend god why does he hate me so death is the only thing i have to look forward too death will be my only release"
IAmNotZo,fdz0qsx,t3_enevdq,"Why are you telling a completely different story to incels on your other account? You know how to take pics that don't represent how you look at all and angle frauding and lighting is something everyone does, even her."

Im using a different account because that one doesn't have enough karma to post here"
lostwanderer28,fe9888h,t1_fdz0qsx,But aren't people supposed to take as good pictures as possible? 🤔
IAmNotZo,fdz1igk,t1_fdz15ai,You told me the only way you got to meet her is because you posted pics that you know don't look like you. Over here it's a completely different story. No you didn't do that.
IAmNotZo,fe990xl,t1_fe9888h,"Not in the sense that it doesn't look like you. You can't take pictures from the side, be missing half of your face, and then say well you had pictures of me before meeting. That's why it's called frauding. A nice picture is well groomed, good lighting, nice smile. It doesn't look like someone else. You can take those pictures for yourself. You can't send only them to someone knowing that's not what you look like and expect them to not notice."
IAmNotZo,fdz3e4w,t1_fdz1zrv,Yes.

The_Lone_Duster,fe6ewzf,t1_fdzzsrv,"Believe me , you don’t need to be ugly to be unattractive to the opposite sex. Just like the OP , I would consider myself attractive but sometimes it’s more than looks. Remember there’s levels to this shit we call a “life”."

killerofpain,fe6gmap,t1_fe6ewzf,"I do admit I find it hard to sympathize with you attractive people. I suffer from ugliness AND mental issues and poor social skills, I cannot even fathom the idea of having a beautiful face (heck, a normal face).

Being invisible, being completely ignored like an npc in a game, like an extra in a movie all because of your appearance, the pain of not even getting to interact with a girl before they find out how shitty your personality is, prevents me from sympathizing with you.

Hopefully I will come around."
Smoke_Me_When_i_Die,fe0rzfa,t1_fe08lih,Like if you have a double ching but you take a picture from an angle that hides it.

thestargazed,fe137rw,t1_fdzdya6,"I agree, I don’t think you are ‘ugly’ based on the picture I saw, but the image does have bad lighting. 

Remember that  attraction is also subjective. Even if one person might think a person is attractive, another person might not. For me it is also about personality. A person can also become more  attractive based on how they are. We all have different things we are attractive to. I wouldn’t take it personally. 

Also a picture doesn’t really give a true representation of how you are or look in real life."

another30yovirgin,fe3b6qh,t3_enpie2,I know two Asian guys who are married to hot blonde girls.
b1g_disappointment,fe3ctv9,t1_fe3b6qh,That's relatively rare. I've lived in two countries and in both I've only seen one pair of AMWF couples while I've probably seen over a hundred pairs of AFWM couples.

b1g_disappointment,fe3h36b,t1_fe3gby2,Yeah. Problem is I don’t see the appeal in asians despite being one of them either so I’m basically fucked.
b1g_disappointment,fe3hce4,t1_fe3gz7a,It’s just reaaaally rare. Especially most asian guys in AMWF relationships have to be at least somewhat good looking.

BuriBuriZaemon3108,fe4ewlw,t3_enpie2,"Tbh, I am really confused regarding Asian Guys, because on one side I see all girls around the globe going crazy for the Korean Guys(not the tall ones, but the normal height ones too, in general), and on the other hand, I see girls hating on them. Why is it so??"
b1g_disappointment,fe4h7zi,t1_fe4ewlw,"I'm not a girl so I can't give you the answer to that.

But from what I can gather there are three main groups. The weebs, the open-minded, and the ""normies"".

Weebs obviously like k-pop and all that weird shit (for some reason I can't relate) and therefore obsess themselves with asian culture.

The open-minded are the ones who don't care about what race you are, the only kind who might date me for what I am instead of what skin color I have. But they are rare.

And finally the normies are the ones who associate asians with the old asian-american media, where they are very emasculate (which physically, kinda true, we are generally shorter and have smaller penises), therefore not attractive."
BuriBuriZaemon3108,fe4i8k2,t1_fe4h7zi,"I am an Indian guy, and in India, we face rascism for our skin colour. I have a darker skin complexion.

Peanut_Butter_Toast,fe8pmjo,t3_enpie2,"I do have to admit a lot of white guys are going after asian girls. Personally, I'd love to get into a relationship with an asian girl. It doesn't feel like a fetish to me, but it's weird being part of such a huge trend. Why do white guys like asian girls so much? I mean, they're hot, but so are other girls. But there's something different about how white guys perceive asian girls that I can't put into words."
b1g_disappointment,fe8qr5v,t1_fe8pmjo,"Well I disagree that they are hot. I think white people are generally more attractive than asians, and I think it's a pretty objective thing as well. Big eyes, tall, clean skin, variations in hair and eye colors, etc.

But I think a major reason why white men go for asian women is because of their smaller body, hence smaller body parts. Basically find them cute because they are smaller, and that sex would be more pleasurable. It may be on a subconscious level though."
Peanut_Butter_Toast,fe8s346,t1_fe8qr5v,"Hmm..I don't see how that's objective. The shape of asian eyes is one of their most attractive features, imo. I prefer shorter women, I don't really have a preference for any specific hair style or eye colors, and I don't really know what you mean by ""clean skin"".

I think the ""small and cute"" factor is definitely a thing though, yeah."
b1g_disappointment,fe96a1n,t1_fe8s346,"Asian's small eyes limit their expressions a lot. I would know, I have a pair. They are not attractive. And many times they tilt down, creating an enraged look. They are literally just a line for some as well, hence the comic exaggeration of a thin line representing asian eyes. Generally, people prefer eyes that don't seem hostile and people who can express their emotions well, and a lot of times asians lack that more than caucasians.

Asians don't (naturally) have more than one eye/hair color. Making them a lot less unique from each other. I literally can't tell between the difference between the faces of korean pop stars or most any asians really.

And black/really dark brown eyes are really unattractive as well, because it blends with the pupils and loses definition. Kind of a ""souless"" look if you will. And straight, stiff black hair not only absorbs all colors and look like dead space, but also there's no definition in it.

With clear skin I guess I meant bright pale skin. Looks ""clean""."

randomNotBot21,fdprnjc,t1_fdph7yk,"I've borderline stopped worrying about such an unlikely hypothetical lol but FA status aside, for me it's more about self worth and perception than worrying about ""performance"" but so often you see people belittle, mock or attack others about it. 

There's clearly more accepting people but nevertheless in society being small is often thrown around as an insult for other completely unrelated things, from shitty or obnoxious people, criminals and even sex offenders, or to certain controversial politicians on Reddit, etc as if it somehow spoke of you as a person or worse it was some kind of deserved punishment that you got. To the fact that it's basically socially acceptable to gossip and mock a man's size and knowing that it's objectively less attractive and desired. 

I don't disagree with what you said though, but I think the point of view of someone without a partner or experience (and plethora of other issues) is pretty different. Certainly it's not end all be all issue but from a societal perspective being small means you are certainly ""less of man"", there's a huge amount of negative associations with it and it's hurtful. If it's not an issue with your partner that's most or what matters, being FA it's rubbing more salt in the would, another one of your plethora of shortcomings.

Edit: And to be honest no matter how woke you are it's hard to ignore the inherent sexual importance that's always been given to penis and it's size, it's the main male sexual characteristic after all, and the immediate suggestion to a small penis is to learn ways to make up for it. Comments like what you first wrote while well intended I think don't come off entirely well because as true as it is that you can please a woman without a penis at all it's still incredibly emasculating for your genitals which are inevitably a very significant part of your sexuality and identity to be deemed worthless.

For example I know that was not the idea but telling someone you hope they find a partner that doesn't like penetrative sex so that they will tolerate their small penis is kind of belittling."
moodistry,fdsw728,t1_fdstd5r,"I bet that is pretty unusual.  I can understand how it would make the whole situation worse.  

I hope a partner comes along who you are able to feel safe enough to reveal this vulnerably and that they still love your body, and you."
moodistry,fdqwcam,t1_fdquh22,Thanks friend.
moodistry,fdqhy95,t1_fdprnjc,"Thanks for the thoughtful response.  Thanks for challenging some of my comments.

You suggest a small penis is ""objectively less attractive and desired"".  Attractiveness is by definition a subjective thing.  For example, if you look at the history of painting, the idealized view of women is to have way more weight on their body compared to the ideal today.  It's not aesthetics - it was actual sexual attractiveness.  Another example is Michelangelo's sculpture ""David"" - call up a picture of him and he has a really small penis.  This is true in both renaissance and Ancient Greek art - you can find examples with even smaller penises than David's.  Aesthetic and sexual perceptions of penis size are culturally-based.

You also say it's emasculating to have your genitals deemed worthless by society.  I struggle with that myself.  My size is okay when I'm aroused but when I'm flaccid I'm pretty dinky - and if I'm at all chilled, it's totally like a turtle with his head pulled in.  I've been in situations where friends went skinny dipping or went into a hot tub naked and for me it was like, no fucking way.  I'm still pretty much that way, unless I'm with someone I really trust, but more and more I'm getting to (or trying to get to) a ""who the fuck cares"" point.  Part of it is that I've grown more comfortable not always having to seem super-virile and masculine - to me that's a really toxic expectation.  Real poison.  

In terms of mocking men's penis size, while I think that might happen in some segments of the mass media, I'm wondering what sub-culture you're living in where people are actually acting and speaking that way  I may be living in a very different situation geographically/culturally and generation-wise, but it's just about inconceivable that anyone I know would mock someone that way, or make any comment suggesting that men with larger penis are more manly.  

I'd like to better understand why you think it's belittling to suggest to the OP that finding partners who are not that interested in penetrative sex is a path to coping with a small penis.  There's so many ways to be sexual, and I don't think one should close the door on possibilities that might be satisfying.  I don't see anything shameful, if your penis size makes penetration less satisfying for your partner, to find partners for whom it's not important."
randomNotBot21,fdqsfyc,t1_fdqhy95,"True and I know there even is women who have a preference for small at least to certain extent but I mean by far and large most women prefer and fetishize bigger and media really reinforces this. It's not an universal truth but in the society and culture that we will experience in  our lifetimes it's just the case, a small penis is something often mocked and to be big is good and masculine. It's exactly why your size makes you feel reluctant to undress among your friends, whereas a guy who knows he's big has no such concerns (what will they think about my size). 

I don't really see it as much or as bad IRL thankfully but being among a group of girls I have definitely heard about their partners size more than once lol, but I think it's definitely a constant in media, comedies, etc and I think it's especially bad on the internet tbh, that's where people aren't afraid to go all out in their opinions. 

If you would ask me I think what bothers me more is the cultural/societal notion as a whole, the frequent association of being small with bad things and big with good things just sends the message that you are less for your size, not everyone has to make their preference know but if the few that do tend to always reinforce that, that's how I feel. 

I think it's belittling because coming to terms that what you are told is a central part of you as a man and of your sexuality is actually not good enough is not a simple thing. Even if your view is progressive and rational and don't get me wrong, I agree. It's the reality and culture we grew up in, your penis is central to your pleasure, it's central to the act of sex and pleasing your partner, you want your partner to like and enjoy it, you want to have the same sexual ""prowess"" that most people have and enjoy the things they get to enjoy, and I get it yeah it doesn't have to be, but penetrative sex is what's given the most focus and importance by far. I do find it shameful because while it's logical, when you think about it, it means your size is shaping your ideas of dating because your below average penis means you can't please the majority of people so you better look for someone who will tolerate it or not care about it (because they don't like penetration). Yes it's reasonable but the message is still: you are less than other men. 

Edit: If you find yourself in a fullfilling relationship that's probably where the importance of the issue ends, but being in this sub I am pretty sure that dick size is something pretty painful for plenty of people. There's even a small dick problems sub with people with some serious issues about it. Tbh with you I am just below average, grower not shower too, to me it's not such a big deal and I don't even feel like it's my size what would get in the way of me sexually, even if I do feel ashamed of it, I just take a lot of issue with the lack of positivity or acceptance that there's about it. We are in an age where openess and positivity for all kinds of different people is becoming popular which is great... Except for masculinity because it's considered privileged. People don't stop to consider that masculinity isn't just a overly macho sexually aggressive asshole but that boys can also have the same insecurities and feelings that anyone else, the amount of times I hear women saying IRL: ""All men are X"" ""Ofc you are this because you are a guy"" etc and because of sharing the same tag of being male even if you have these struggles society doesn't care as a whole. You have to find a way to be accepted, not the other way around. Because people, most men included, have the apparent idea that being a man is like a single direction road that we are all striving towards and I get it, it's a self reinforcing thing, this is the idea we grew up with, we pressure others to fall in line and are pressured ourselves and it takes a lot of time for people to start breaking that mold."

If she finds out during the act chances are way better she wont mind because you already convinced her to make out with you etc. also finger and tounge can do a lot of stuff befor even pulling down your pants.

Once had a guy with a micro penis, dude was tall as hell so not what I expected but that guy had so much passion I really couldn't care less. I get your insecuritys, but it really is NOT a deal breaker for everyone!"
EHnter,fdpyxtt,t1_fdpsck7,"I agree. Why would the first thing you let someone know is how small your dick is. How do you even know if it’s actually small? It could just be average, and you’re comparing yourself to porn stars, so it’s small. OP needs better people to talk to."

I feel bad for you bro, just dont date party girls or women who have been through a lot of guys. Buy sex toys or whatever. There are people with big dicks out there getting nothing. At least you scored quite a few woman, that's pretty good man.

It's supposed to add CMs to an inch in length and girth. Google about it and research it. Don't overdo it of course or you could damage your penis, but if you follow the instructions clearly and dont rush to try to get a bigger penis and inflict pain on yourself, you should be good."

Throwmeawayoffcliff,fdpwzcn,t3_emkffs,"Size isn't the biggest deal, especially if you are willing to use other methods like oral and fingers that could be just as effective or even moreso. Sure, some will see size as a dealbreaker but some won't care much or at all. One thing that could be an issue, though, is confidence-if you are small, and feel bad about it, you could perhaps come off as unconfident about it which might end up hurting you much more than the size itself. Which can be a tricky thing, because there can be the issue of whether to bring it up beforehand or not, and either way it can come off as awkward, weird, lacking in confidence, and stuff like that, so I'm frankly not sure what the best way to approach that is, like I'd say just bringing it up beforehand is best, but maybe someone would consider it creepy to talk about your dick before you are actually in the situation? Idk. But at any rate, if you could make it clear that you are willing to do other stuff to make a woman happy, and don't come off as overly unconfident about your size, things could end up working out alright"

Something the French are not known for lol.

It’s a good thing I guess. But when you have crippling social anxiety it can be difficult. You don’t know what to say or how to reply... or your attempt at humour is lost in them and it just creates another awkward interaction. But I don’t need to tell anyone here about that lol.

I have been trying though. I asked a woman out a while back, she said no (married) but I gave myself permission to feel proud for just asking... the humiliation was intense. But acknowledging to myself that trying is the only way to succeed made me feel 100x better.

One day I just grabbed all the courage I could muster, got a friend to walk over to her with me, and asked her what her name was. We dated for over a year, I lost my virginity, and had a great time with her. She ended up dumping me for the guy she is now married to with 3 kids. But it was still worth it for the experience"

TheNanomancer117,fe6jb2w,t3_elyy94,And the bike only has a back wheel and you have to wheelie that shit.
DigitalSpecX,en4mdk,top_level,"...in movies?   

But in the real world, it's always the most best looking and outgoing people all getting along and forming their own cliques while the unpopular stay unpopular forever."
SnortAndScoff,fduldzr,t3_en4mdk,"I guess the unpopular ones are the ones watching the movies, so they're the target audience."
uniquan,fdumgw3,t1_fduldzr,"Reminds me of anime, where the typical hero is a skinny, awkward small guy, I assume most who consume anime in Japan have roughly the same characteristics."
Depressed_SkinsFan,fdwrm2l,t1_fduldzr,Also maybe the unpopular ones are the ones writing the movies
DigitalSpecX,fdxrai2,t1_fduldzr,That many people are unpopular or ForeverAloner's funding these films? Why isn't this sub blowing up then?
SnortAndScoff,fe0cws8,t1_fdxrai2,"FAs are a more severe case and within that I imagine only a certain amount of them use reddit and a small amount of that certain amount use this sub.

I suppose I should've said they are *a* target audience and not *the* target audience."
throwawaymuchlmao,fdudko9,t3_en4mdk,"its just a massive cope so the kids who are underdogs can feel better than themselves. truth is if you were unpopular in highschool you will probably remain unpopular the rest of your life unless u go through some MAJOR life changes. things that will almost guarantee you prevail in life is being majorly confident, outgoing, attractive, and likeable - which most unpopular kids lack"
AgreeableService,fdufbs8,t3_en4mdk,"I'll do you one better

all while everyone calls the unpopular people shooters, terrorists, rapists, and whatever else"
DigitalSpecX,fdwexrr,t1_fdufbs8,"Yeah it’s like these are the only types of stories told through cinema that have no effect on culture. You come out with one single film about female empowerment and the entire world pulls a 180 and bends over backward to respect m’lady. Or one about a racial minority. And at least people who don’t like them  are at least outspoken and honest through their criticism.    
But movie after movie, show after show, about the loner guy turn hero or the virgin turned Chad, it’s like there is no affect on society that makes them more aware of and inviting to the loners. They just continue going ignored.    
Interestingly after the recent Joker, we sort of did see some sympathy. And no I’m not one of those cringey joker FA’s. But I did notice reactions from people and it’s too dark for them. People walked out because of his loneliness. They look at it more of a mental issue so sadly that movie does no favors for your average loner."
AgreeableService,fdwno3t,t1_fdwexrr,"I thought the ending of The Accountant did it well, but it still played into the tropes (loner is a hero, autism is a super power)

the part where you said minorities was too true. I knew a guy (first gen US citizen) in high school who's dad was born in Africa. When my social studies class found out, it was the best 180 ever. ""why don't you talk about your heritage?"" ""you should wear an ethnic bracelet. you'll stand out."" 

his response? ""we left bc of civil war. why would I respect a nation that didn't respect us?"" and we just covered push factors of emigration too"
tired_doomer,fdun5m1,t3_en4mdk,"That's because they are movies, they are fantasy and wishful thinking and not based in reality."
nawal86,fdurlsl,t1_fdun5m1,"I don't know, the family ones I always thought were unrealistic, like nobody hugs their kids and say they still love them after the kid screws up, right? Or no kid is going to raid the fridge without asking for permission and really trying to make sure the ""yes you can have a slice of that cake"" wasn't really a trap that they were really gonna regret for the next few weeks.

Except that I've had some glimpses of some healthy families over the last 15 years since I escaped the madhouse (physically anyway, mentally they kept a short leash for another 10 years) - and I'm pretty sure that while normal families have their tough spots, they do actually pull together and generally support and love one another. It was really weird for me when I stayed overnight at somebody's place, they said if you wake up before us, feel free to grab some cereal and there's some fresh milk in the fridge. It was a really weird feeling actually taking it in the morning without seeking permission on the spot."
tired_doomer,fdxip5o,t1_fdxcubl,What I mean by wishful thinking is stuff like work hard and you'll become a successful millionaire or poor talented people being discovered and becoming big celebrities. Sure there might be some cases like that but they are fucking rare compared to the majority of people.
DigitalSpecX,fdxkvgk,t1_fdxip5o,"Well I'm thinking more about socially awkward people or people with no friends making them or becoming popular or noticed or acceptable. Harry Poter, Spider Man, etc... Here are some others: https://www.gamesradar.com/50-coolest-movie-loners/    
I feel like the type of movies you're thinking of would be one like ""Limitless"" or ""The Pursuit of Happyness"". Where they already have a good life or are non Forever Aloner's, and have/had moderate success, but just either have some hard times and end up making it big or making a huge come-back or something crazy happens to them."
Hellblade999,fduorvq,t3_en4mdk,"It’s fantasy, and it’s wishful thinking. If the opposite was true then we’d have films about bullies becoming more successful than the unpopular kids in their 20s."
nawal86,fduqnxe,t3_en4mdk,"I was unpopular in school, but at age 13, I led a team of three to win a national science quiz thing - I was massively popular at school from that point onwards - but only superficially. I didn't develop close friends, I was just the useful guy to ask for help with homework from. Dumbass 13 year old me thought I had it good at the time. At uni it became clear that I was only useful for academic help, but I somehow convinced myself that was enough - of course, every holidays I was massively lonely, with multiple suicide attempts almost each holiday period, including one where I stopped eating and my body started having issues (couldn't stand for more than 30 seconds, couldn't walk in a straight line or without hunching over, peripheral vision became distorted and seemed to wobble, and at one point I couldn't sleep anymore - although maybe the starvation caused the sleep deprivation which caused the other issues)."
RoleplayPete,fdvl0tx,t1_fduqnxe,So im taking this math class right now....
DisastrousLoss,fdw1ht3,t1_fduqnxe,Damn bro. I am here for you if you need to talk to someone
adrianmalacoda,fdxu0kt,t3_en4mdk,In movies the ugly people are just attractive people wearing glasses or an unflattering hairdo. So even at surface level it is unrealistic.
DigitalSpecX,fdxxv4f,t1_fdxu0kt,"Yeah I can understand that. But that's more of a cosmetic thing and doesn't negate the character being portrayed.   
""Yennefer"" in The Witcher for example is supposed to be ""ugly"" before her painful transformation, but is still good looking and somewhat attractive in a certain way. Still though, the Yennefer's in the real world are bullied and made fun of and never look upon as someone who could transform or become something great. Yet these same bullies would probably *like* this character in the movie.       
   
Also, movies based on true stories will always have better looking actors than someone who looks identical to the person the story is about. But it's still a true story about a real person."
Throwaway030818,fdymv0k,t3_en4mdk,"Also the weird, loner guy in movies does something in his free time and gets super good at it. That is how people start to notice him.

&#x200B;

I just spin around in my chair at home staring at the wall."
DigitalSpecX,fdys6wm,t1_fdymv0k,Yeah well in the movies a forever-alone’r who stands up to a bully ends up with the girl. In the real world the girl ends up hating the forever-alone’r even more for upsetting her apple cart.
Silane85,fdw1a6d,t3_en4mdk,"Here's an exception, the ending to The Last American Virgin:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYSOjuGdmvI"
DisastrousLoss,fdw1chd,t3_en4mdk,That's why movies are the only place I can feel happy. How tf did Jonah Hill's character in Superbad get a girl like Jules? I can't believe I am jealous of a fictional character haha
Cesare_MA,fdwqk7e,t3_en4mdk,Can you give examples?

21suns,eog95h,top_level,"It's not fair. It is important, and you know better than anyone it's not an easy fix.

You don't deserve it. Whatever slight or even horrendous thing you may have done, very, very, very few things deserve the pain you're going through. And I would bet no one here is on the Hitler level.

I'm so sorry life hasn't been kind to you. How hollow everything must feel. Life is cruel for many for no reason. 

I truly wish you the best. I hope you find a peaceful niche where you can be happy. I hope you allow yourself to hope.

I hope you don't kill yourself.

I hope your unique pain becomes a normal ache that leads to better times. Stay strong where you can."

Thank you."

waddup16,feczhxb,t3_eog95h,"You know this has probably been said but Im not giving up so nobody should. You would be surprised what some work can get you, if you work on yourself and yes I know gym is a cliche buu after seeing what my buddy did I believe anything is possible. So don’t give up don’t listen to people telling you learn to deal with it. You can achieve it you just have to believe and work for it. Im not gonna give up so neither should you I don’t care what anyone says i have hope for everyone. If you see this I hope it helps you, gives you strength to not give up just improve and work on yourself! Stay strong friends im here next you!"
