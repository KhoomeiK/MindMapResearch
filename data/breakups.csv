Jim: Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
  
Dwight: [incoherent mumbling] No you didn't.
  
Jim: Yeah, I didn't think I had. Well, it was all about Pam.
  
Dwight: Mmm-uh-mm [incoherent mumbling]
  
Jim: Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it. I mean, I lost it Dwight. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything. Even weird stuff, like food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful. It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you."
WeirdWhirlpool,fdxuute,t3_enb3kc,I felt that man. I felt that shit so hard
Eagleassassin3,fdylo9e,t3_enb3kc,"It‚Äôs even worse for me because my ex introduced me to the Office and we watched it multiple times together and always quoted it. So even though I‚Äôd like to watch it again, it‚Äôs too painful sometimes"
sayyid786,fdysbtp,t1_fdylo9e,"Same, my ex introduced me to the office too."
slypigcunningham,fdzl67g,t1_fdylo9e,I‚Äôm literally never going to watch it again bc of this

jayde_e99,fe01j9o,t1_fdylo9e,Sameee
beautifullymodest,fe2okym,t1_fdylo9e,"I had this same issue and there were so many things I could never watch, go, eat, etc. because of the reminders. (This was after a 4 yr relationship) about 6 months after the break up I began delving back into some. 

Some because the pain wasnt that bad anymore or I wouldn't let him take something I loved from me. A year later, I enjoy everything again and the only connection I have with them is myself or fleeting memories."
Letty_22,fe0662f,t1_fdylo9e,I feel that. I‚Äôm sorry.
WeirdWhirlpool,fe08t7p,t1_fdylo9e,"Same , but not my ex. A good friend of mine introduced me to the office and now I can never  watch it because it reminds me of her."
epicbryce,fe0agfy,t1_fdylo9e,I haven‚Äôt been able to watch it for over a month for the same exact reason :(

buttercupgymlover,fdy2ph0,t3_enb3kc,I literally just broke down in tears reading this cuz this is the exact situation I'm in with how jim was feeling üíîüò¢üò≠üò≠üò¢
xJaycobx,fdyv023,t3_enb3kc,"It‚Äôs weird, since my ex left me the only show I can watch is the office. I‚Äôm not sure why but it really helps me. It had been about a month since she broke up with me when I watched this scene again and it really hit me hard. But there is a scene where Pam tells Erin that sometimes the heart doesn‚Äôt know what it wants until it finds it. I believe she said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not about who you were with but who you end up with‚Äù. That really helps lift me up. It makes me think that even though I spent 6 years of my life with my ex and I truly believed she was the one, maybe she isn‚Äôt and that I will end up with someone who makes me happier than she did."
VonStronheim,fdzrgnn,t1_fdyv023,I think a lot of people (including me) have this problem. They think they have found ‚Äúthe one‚Äù when in reality they just found ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù.
wolfkween,fdzrrxl,t1_fdzrgnn,"Someone once told me you can make it work with anyone, really took the magic out of it, but I think it's true. There is no ""the one."""
VonStronheim,fdzs6ju,t1_fdzrrxl,"Pretty much, but you shouldn‚Äôt have to MAKE it work. Excluding petty arguments and the regular stresses of life, you and your partner should just be compatible if you want it to work. You can‚Äôt really force that, it‚Äôs just a matter of personal preferences and natural compatibility. Of course don‚Äôt just end a relationship when it gets tough, but never try to change someone."
LoveHurtsYouKnow,fe52moh,t1_fdzrrxl,"Be glad there is no ""the one"". Then it would be almost impossible to find them. But there are people you just click with, and ""the one"" for me is someone you click with that you have shared a lot of time with. The time together and those memories are what it's all about."
NicJ20,fdyl7m7,t3_enb3kc,"Even like during their wedding,his plan. 
Plan C was to marry in church, boat was plan B and plan A was to marry her long time ago,pretty much the day I met her..."

NicJ20,fe947el,t1_fe1m893,"Me too. I watch it Everytime I feel sad, to make myself sadder"
EveningRepair_,fdyn38i,t3_enb3kc,"On the other hand though, Jim and Pam eventually did get together because they were perfect for eachother. For me that gives me hope that I'll find that person for me some day."

flowing_sun,fdzcezp,t1_fdys8hx,"Same thing for me buddy. On one of the first weekends we spent together, we watched ‚Äúdinner party‚Äù. Now I can‚Äôt watch one of the best episodes because it will always remind me of this weekend"
sayyid786,fdzmk43,t1_fdzcezp,Yeah man it's very difficult. I still can't believe she's left me for someone else after 3.5 years. Hopefully we all get through this üò™
I_Do_The_Numbers,fdz298x,t3_enb3kc,"My ex and I watched the Office nearly every time we were together for 7 yrs.  It's his favourite show.  He always called me ""his Pam"" and he was ""my Jim"".  I miss him with every cell in my body."

jgamez6,fdyleqz,t3_enb3kc,If my job hadn‚Äôt made me leave my hometown I would‚Äôve lost my mind back there. I was already kind of depressed as she was still in town too but staying would‚Äôve fucked with me even more. I‚Äôm thankful for my new city and my new life. Distractions from the loneliness.
HonoraryKrogan,fdz03oh,t3_enb3kc,"I'm actively avoiding family and my hometown because it's too small to not accidentally run into her or someone close to her.

I let myself down and snooped on social media the other day, and she's happy. I know she's happier than she ever was with me. And finally, that thought doesn't tear me up inside anymore, but I'm not ready to go back home yet. It would undo so much of the progress I've tenuously made over the last several months."
brittaniese,fe02qzb,t3_enb3kc,"Being that I‚Äôm from Scranton, this just got me in the feels considering that I‚Äôm moving in 5 months for this very same reason."

ah-i-shall-cry,fdz6zuo,t3_enb3kc,"I put so much comfort into the Office despite the fact that it is somewhat a show about finding love. My ex introduced me to it, but I love it too much to not watch it. It will always be my ""comfort food.""

Regardless, it's true. Being without them is so hard."
sportsfordays77,fdzy58p,t3_enb3kc,I just watched that episode last night and I also noticed how much that relates. Sucks man because that‚Äôs the damn truth
Rick2_0,fdzzsc2,t3_enb3kc,Man this hits home
ZidanSlashKafka,fe03u31,t3_enb3kc,"Started watching the office right after the breakup,  the show is a life saver.

I remember me and my ex finished F.R.I.E.N.D.s together ,  so any friends reference is so painful sometimes."

Woweeeeeeeew,fe0w2a0,t3_enb3kc,My ex‚Äôs animations are all over Netflix. That new door knock animation is massively triggering becausehe worked on that during the last few months of us. I‚Äôve thrown up from hearing that sound. It sucks I can‚Äôt eveb watch tv without being reminded of him.

mayora14,fe3qzx5,t3_enb3kc,The worst was when I was watching to cheer myself up with some laughs and I watched the episode about where Dwight found Nellie‚Äôs anxiety meds. All I could think about was my ex who suffered from anxiety and how I didn‚Äôt properly care for her.
thai_knee_dancer,emub3f,top_level,‚Äî from Attached: The New Science of Adult Attachment
duckduckdoo,fdskkf7,t3_emub3f,"Hey, thanks for posting this. I was just thinking today that we don't have a lot of discussion on here about how our attachment histories affect our response to the breakup. I was thinking of writing something about it but thought maybe the sub is more about personal stories than sort of educative stuff!"
thai_knee_dancer,fdswlv2,t1_fdskkf7,"Understanding my attachment style and past trauma has been the most helpful way that I‚Äôve been able to process my breakup. I recommend this book to everyone, honestly"
violettine,fdup8fp,t1_fdskkf7,I‚Äôd like to read something about this!
HelpingOneAnother,fdru51i,t3_emub3f,"I agree but I also disagree with the last statement. Love can be different for different people/couples. Not everyone‚Äôs love is (or should be) just peaceful. 

Then again i‚Äôve had a drink so I might just be chatting shite."
Artostradivarius,fds62z3,t1_fdru51i,It takes time to find the peace of mind. Not just immediately.
thai_knee_dancer,fdsv5ki,t1_fdru51i,"I agree that love is different for different people, but I like that the quote distinguishes that true love means peace of mind in the evolutionary sense. Because evolutionarily we are all looking for that comfort and security that comes with companionship."
redbabydragon,fdu9uvc,t1_fdru51i,I second this. And cheers HelpingOneAnother.
Canyouhearme2019,fdrt1e1,t3_emub3f,Was just telling someone this!

mayiky,fds6xx7,t3_emub3f,This hit home!
lucy851,fdsjqck,t3_emub3f,Just listened to this audiobook. So insightful!
SapioAnamCara,fdsytva,t3_emub3f,"This tells us the difference between secure and insecure attachment based on attachment theory. Infants have secure attachments with their caregiver when they feel loved, cared for and accepted and those who are otherwise neglected form insecure attachment. Like in Harlow's experiment, the monkey feels loved, cared for and accepted with its surrogate mother (which is just a wire covered in fur) by its side. True love is basically secure attachment."
Dimuthu1,fdshpue,t3_emub3f,"It sucks that I'm certain my ex felt this way, but I was unable to"

hitthewallrunning,fdstyhx,t3_emub3f,Most new relationships start out this way then grow into that comforting peace of mind.
thai_knee_dancer,fdsuuf3,t1_fdstyhx,"I was actually thinking about this earlier today. My last relationship lasted 1.5 years, but it never left that beginning stage of anxiety and insecurity. I just kept thinking that we needed to give it more time to get to that comfortable place. But it never happened and the relationship was really damaging for both of us."
hitthewallrunning,fdsx3ga,t1_fdsuuf3,I guess I should have said healthy relationships...  after 1.5 years you should be past that.  Sorry.
johnnycharity,fdupble,t3_emub3f,"That's true, you know, it's been 2 months since I never heard anything about my ex. 


I've been thinking the day we met, I remember my brain sending me those signs all the time, telling me to get the hell out of there, that something was wrong there, I fought those feelings and decided to go forward, I was completely blind for that girl despite some of her flaws. 


I loved her with all my heart but finally lost the battle after 4 years. 
She was my first love, but I don't want to romanticize that shit...


Now I know perfectly what my brain was trying to telling me. 
In respect to love, always trust your guts. Be with someone who makes you feel comfortable and safe since day one, specially those who already know exactly what they want from life."
AllThePositiveThings,fdv5cp7,t3_emub3f,"TLDR: ‚ÄúLove‚Äù is a verb, doing word. It is our choices, our actions and our behaviours. 



Basically I have a slightly different view on this ,

Love is a verb, a doing word, it describes action. 

‚ÄúPeace of mind‚Äù ...... yes I absolutely agree with you, this is a fine ultimate goal for your combined love. 

But we have to act and work towards creating that peace of mind making it a reality for one another. 
There is unfortunately no magical free lunch which steps in to manifest this for us, somehow being generated by strong human emotions alone. 

When we are feeling powerfully motivated to act in a loving way and experiencing deep powerful affection along with strong feelings of attraction toward our loved one. Then it follows that you will want not only peace of mind but, all of the positive things, for your person. Health, wealth, contentment, comfort and safety. 

So then, I would argue that you will now begin to feel an equal degree of some concern, along with some level of anxiety as those nagging but frankly quite sensible doubts build. Whispering to you that this loving vision that you target for one another, may not actually come to pass. Despite all of your best efforts.

Balance, really is what we see everywhere around us in the naturally evolved world. If we care deeply about someone, and we are pouring heart felt effort into loving them through our actions and behaviours. Then we hope to move ever closer towards our blissful peace of mind target state. The other side of our metaphorical scales inevitably balances out, and we begin to feel some weight of worry, some concern for our loved one. Concern in our own ability to love them as well as they deserve, anxiety that we might not actually be able to provide them with all of the positive things that you soo very much wish to be able to grant them.

Love is a verb, a doing word. And there can be no concept of light without also accepting the concept of darkness."

Mirasei,elqjk5,top_level,"You loved me on the weekends.

 When things were easy. When my hair was perfect, my outfit cute and my makeup flawless. When you weren't stressed, there were no chores to be done and our kittens were nothing but fun. You loved me when it was my birthday, our anniversary or there was fun to be had with friends. You loved me on the couch, where we could watch anything for hours and play games until dawn. You loved me in the bedroom, when I made you feel the way no one else has. 

You didn't love me on the weekdays. 

When we were busy and the dishes had piled up while the cats screamed to be fed. When work was busy and you were restless and my hair was showing early signs of grey. When getting out of bed was hard and everything felt like too much for me and my breath was far from pleasant. When I was younger but trying desperately to catch up. When all I wanted was to be your safe haven like you were mine.

But I loved you always. 

Even when you didn't love me."

It never ceases to amaze me how shallow and fair weather our society has gotten. Even to the point where men think women aren‚Äôt worth loving and being there for the moment we are not 100% at our best. And the most annoying thing about this is all the women out there that encourage this behavior, get frustrated and stressed by the mentally and emotionally destructive process of trying to up keep that fa√ßade then lash out and cheat on said boyfriend or leave them for someone else, leaving that bf and the future one still not understanding how their fa√ßade is not realistic nor something that‚Äôs reasonable to expect from any human being. Perfection 24/7 is not healthy nor realistic, and it‚Äôs time our society stops feeding this dishonest perspective. We need to all accept and support our partners, especially when things blow up, disasters strike, hardships happen, they look their worst, etc etc. these are the times we should be encouraging and motivating one another to get through it and help  better one another and ourselves. You can‚Äôt expect someone to love you at your worst and be there for you if you can‚Äôt and don‚Äôt do the same. This rant is directed at the person who left this person when things weren‚Äôt perfect, seemingly every time things weren‚Äôt perfect. You never deserved them. And to everyone else that has that same abandon ship mentality when things get tough, you deserve to be alone until you learn that that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs wrong with society right now and also that same mentality is what‚Äôs devastating our planet and creating the majority of everyone‚Äôs problems. Start caring. Start working harder when things get tough. Stop just dropping what ever isn‚Äôt perfect in a moment. Learn how to commit to something other than yourself and your own selfish needs. 
End rant. 
Mirasei, you deserve better than this. We all do. They don‚Äôt deserve your sorrow, your thoughts, your heart, or your time spent mourning such a human being who who reduces you by their crappy actions. 
I know this is hard to remind yourself of that right now, but keep repeating that mantra to yourself in the mirror ten times a day till you understand it and believe it. You‚Äôre beautiful just as you are, flaws and all. You‚Äôre an amazing human being who can breathe, enjoy delicious foods, read fantastic books, watch incredible movies and shows, listen to beautiful music, and work on bettering yourself on a whim! Enjoy yourself. Keep yourself so busy pampering yourself and bettering yourself and bettering the world that you don‚Äôt even have time to pity that turd you left in the toilet bowl that was your past relationship. That person deserves literally zero of your thoughts and or time spent on those thoughts. 
Time to upgrade, Mirasei. <3 
You‚Äôre beautiful. You‚Äôll get through this. It‚Äôs hard and it suck‚Äôs so much sometimes until you get through it. But just keep reminding yourself all of the above. Every day. Every night. Every morning. Biggest hugs."

Seething with resentment and can not even see myself being attracted to her anymore. I'm really hoping that is a sign that I'm at least moving away from the feeling of loss. But who knows... I would really just love to forget she exists right now. I really don't want to feel anything for her at all. Neither resentment nor love.
basicblissbelle,fe6kzsy,t1_fe6ffm2,"This is probably going to keep happening for a while. I'm in the same boat as you although it's only been a month in my case. It sounds like you're trying to force yourself to move on. Maybe just give it time, accept your thoughts drifting away to her sometimes, and sooner or later they'll fade. Try new hobbies and do everything you couldn't while you were dating! There has to be some pros to being single, so look at the bright side :) 
Good luck I hope we get through this soon!"
basicblissbelle,fe6l8x9,t1_fe6kzsy,"Also there's plenty of fish in the sea. We tend to put our partners on a pedestal when we're in love with them. With all due respect to them, after you think you're ready, I'd suggest going on some casual dates. Try and appreciate the good in other people"
Testkaninen,fe86b1z,t1_fe6l8x9,"The stronger the bond, the longer it takes.

If it has been close to true love(on the love-o-meter), the ones that really make you believe in magic, fate, and unicorns - then it might take a while to move on completely. Pro\`s estimate 0,5-1yr per.year spent together. Having loved someone with all my heart(and being extremely thankful for it!), I can definitely relate to this. 

This being said, the break-up doesn\`t really matter, only how you spend time in the now. We should learn from history, grow, not dwell on it."
paulblartmaaaaaalcop,fe69o6s,t3_ensw0h,Stuck between wanting her back or accepting we weren‚Äôt good for each other. Missing my best friend rn more than a girlfriend.
luvmypup2017,fe9ckgi,t1_fe69o6s,This is exactly where I‚Äôm at right now !! I want him back but I know I deserved better and we deserve better and weren‚Äôt exactly the best match for each other and it‚Äôs for the better. But I just miss my best friend more then I miss the actual relationship. Being his best friend a year year and a half before we got into the relationship then being best friends for 3 years during the relationship makes it really hard. Because I miss my best friend more than anything. So I think have accepted the fact we aren‚Äôt good for each other and stepped off the fact that we aren‚Äôt getting back together any time soon or maybe never. But missing your best friend is the hardest part
pornbot1991,fe62o0w,t3_ensw0h,"I have been doing the same thing this weekend. Just pushing myself to understand that this is final and there is truly no going back.

bythesquare,feabwqu,t1_fe6ewth,"I'm learning to journal and get things down onto paper. There is something about not wanting to admit it in your mind, but being able to wrote it down that kind of helps convince you that it's the right thing. It felt sort of soothing to be able to read it a few times after I wrote it down. I don't feel as unable to accept it as I did before. How did it feel when you put yours to paper? What encouraged you to do that?"
Gerolino,fe6muyz,t3_ensw0h,"if she is gone there is space for something new - a new person, a new Hobby or a new you. If you both were a perfect match she wouldnt have left you.

Did have jealousy issues though but I have worked on it and I did nothing but love and care for her. She said nobody cared about her ever the way I did. Was hoping in time she would see what we had but she hasn't said a single word to me in 6 months. That's what hurts. That I could mean so little.

Still think of her all the time but am I stupid for thinking she may reach out some day? I don't know if 6 months is a long time in grand scheme of things."
DiviiNiTy,fe7mhz5,t1_fe7fofj,"You shouldn't think about her probably reaching out to you. Because it is not in your control.

UnluckyWriting,fdnjq4a,t3_em9ige,"Same.

I have come to see that it‚Äôs entirely because I feel like unless he loves me or wants me, I‚Äôm not okay - not worthy - not enough. It‚Äôs as if he is the only person who can validate me.

My therapist had me kind of play it through - if he did show up and say all the things I‚Äôd want, what then?  The exercise helped me to see that it would feel great for a couple of days, but soon enough I‚Äôd need validation again. When it‚Äôs coming from someone outside of yourself, you need constant reassurance. Constant reminders. It becomes like an addiction. Feels good momentarily but you constantly need to top it up. 

The fix for this is to find validation for yourself within yourself. That‚Äôs really hard because it‚Äôs not a conscious thought, it‚Äôs a deeply held belief. You may know consciously that you‚Äôre not a bad person and deserve more but can‚Äôt get away from that deeply ingrained sense of ‚Äúnot okay.‚Äù My therapist has me practicing a lot of affirmations (there is science behind this it‚Äôs not just a bunch of woo woo nonsense) to change this belief. I‚Äôve also been doing some self worth hypnosis tracks. It‚Äôs helped. 

Good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è"
eenergabeener,fdntk9w,t1_fdnjq4a,Sounds like you have a great therapist! I'm happy you found them.
IVYWATTS,fdo9zzr,t1_fdnjq4a,Any chance you can expand more on the affirmations and hypnosis aspect of your therapy?
bettertoda,fdo45cj,t1_fdnjq4a,Thank you for sharing this way of thinking
ohlaulau,fdonpym,t1_fdnjq4a,"man i feel you. i've never been the most confident person so dating him and knowing someone loved me the way i am really made me feel better about myself so the moment he left i couldn't help blaming myself, my personality and my appearance...when in reality i am not the problem, i'm learning from this experience to become an improved version of myself and not make the same mistakes ever again, especially basing my self-worth on someone else. never again"
aquamarinne,fdp32zw,t1_fdnjq4a,"My therapist pointed out the same thing to me as well! I used to be a very codependent person, usually with best friends. I have worked for years on it though and I now consider myself very independent, but after we broke up my therapist pointed out that it sounded like I resorted back to my old codependent tendencies. I needed the constant validation that he provided me without me having to ask. And when we broke up I felt like I was going through withdrawals without it. I put so much of my self worth into him and I‚Äôm trying now to find that worth within myself. It is hard and I understand the struggle. It sounds like you are doing really well though and I wish you the best!"
UnluckyWriting,fdoco72,t1_fdo9zzr,"Susan Elliot‚Äôs book ‚Äúgetting past your breakup‚Äù is an excellent resource on writing affirmations and I highly recommend it.

The basics are - 

1. Affirmations need to be positive. For example choose ‚ÄúI am a non smoker‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt smoke‚Äù - more ‚ÄúI am‚Äù or ‚ÄúI do‚Äù statements. The subconscious mine doesn‚Äôt really understand negatives. 

2. Affirmations work even if you think they‚Äôre stupid or not true.

3. Consistency and repetition are critical. I have mine set as six reminders on my phone to go off every 2.5 hours. So I see them over and over every day. And I don‚Äôt have to remember to say them. 

4. They can be more effective if you are more specific or offer evidence - it‚Äôs sort of a combo of cognitive behavioral therapy and affirmation. For example: 
‚ÄúI am loved‚Äù versus ‚Äúi am loved by my mom, my dad, and my brother‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm considerate‚Äù versus ‚ÄúI show people I care about them by asking about their lives‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm good at my job‚Äù versus ‚ÄúI value hard work and am successful at work‚Äù 


My affirmations for me are:
1. I am worthy and I am enough
2. I trust the evolution of my life 
3. I rely on me 
4. I am strong and resilient 
5. I am equal to everyone else 
6. Thereis nothing wrong with me

Edit - re: hypnosis - I honestly have no idea if this really works but I just search on YouTube for self worth Hypnosis and listen to them when I fall asleep"

TediTheGodfather,fdnkpvn,t3_em9ige,"I‚Äôll leave you all with this: karma is a bitch, and *she* doesn‚Äôt play fair. Those of us who feel as though we‚Äôve been casually discarded will get those regret texts/calls. I‚Äôve seen it happen first hand. People who are careless or reckless with other‚Äôs hearts will eventually know what it‚Äôs like to feel what they‚Äôve made us feel. 

I can‚Äôt say when it‚Äôll get better. There is no exact timetable for this. Allow yourselves to feel what you feel."
elkay15,fdnyc4a,t1_fdnkpvn,"I would say don't wait for those texts or calls. Fill the void with your self growth. Read, meet up with friends, go for coffee.

TediTheGodfather,fdnz299,t1_fdnyc4a,"While I agree that we shouldn‚Äôt wait for those texts or calls, and to grow from our respective situations, I wouldn‚Äôt say ignore the attempted contact when it happens. While I‚Äôm typically not a vindictive or vengeful person, that ‚Äúeat-shit‚Äù grin is satisfying when you finally hear/read *I‚Äôm sorry for how I treated you.* Don‚Äôt be a smug, mean, condescending asshole when they do, but it‚Äôs at that point that you can say all you tried to in the beginning; this time, without tears or a shaky voice."
elkay15,fdnz7k9,t1_fdnz299,"I agree. I will have the ""eat shit"" grin. But I won't have anything to say. That's fuel for them."
TediTheGodfather,fdo1jwj,t1_fdnz7k9,"I‚Äôve got plenty to say. Lol. But due to gaslighting and deflection, it was never heard. That eventual conversation will begin with *STFU and listen to what you refused to let me say then, or get the fuck off my phone.* ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
elkay15,fdo1sfm,t1_fdo1jwj,"LOL, can I lol here? I'm with you for sure. I was gaslit for years. Didn't even know what gaslighting was. Hindsight is 20-20. The less I have to tell her the better I feel. I'm about keeping my peace these days. The problem with narcissists is that even when you tell her that long laundry list of shit you have piled up, they won't actually care."
TediTheGodfather,fdo36qx,t1_fdo1sfm,"You most certainly can ‚Äúlol‚Äù here. Lol. And I didn‚Äôt quite understand what gaslighting was until about a month before that final message was sent, but I knew what was happening wasn‚Äôt right. Always having my feelings marginalized to reduce accountability for being the one to cause the hurt. But I won‚Äôt be waiting up for her calls or texts. They‚Äôll come when her shit hits the fan. 

The best revenge is to live a life they‚Äôll regret not sticking around for to be a part of. I‚Äôm a singer/songwriter (R&B/NeoSoul), and the shit I went thru was that kick in my ass I needed to finally decide to go balls to the wall with being a performer instead of just a writer. I‚Äôve been encouraged by so many throughout high school and undergrad to go for it. Remember the hashtags | #DontMindMe #ImSleepDeprived."

It was humiliating, jarring, etc.  She blamed me for a bunch of stuff, which had nothing to do with her sexuality, it was a textbook teardown and discard.  Now she's lovebombing someone else who I think is also a narcissist...

He just left and had a dating ad up in 3 days because he always feels the grass is greener. I'm taking care of me, have lost 30 lbs, have gotten a lot more fit, had my hair done, made new friends, and have started dating. The woman he found on a dating site just got married two weeks ago to someone else. LOL...that is karma at work. Now, interestingly, he invites me to an event in a couple of weeks. I told him yes because I didn't think he would really buy the tickets (he's kind of cheap), but he did buy them. I'm not considering this a romantic date at all and am not treating it that way. Part of me wants to cancel at the last minute, but deep down I don't want to be that mean. It helps knowing that he wants to go to this event with me, though. I can't deny that. Two months ago I would have taken him back in a heartbeat, but not anymore."
swmitabyss,fdnbxk2,t3_em9ige,"It really does make a huge difference in how quickly you move on. If someone is begging for you back, head over heels, it‚Äôs much easier. But that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs the best way. Knowing that subconsciously gives you a peace of mind that you have a person to fall back on if your newfound single-life fails or endures too many obstacles you decide you don‚Äôt want to face. Whereas not having your SO on the back burner, leads to much more significant self-growth. You don‚Äôt have that safety net or reassurance. All you‚Äôve got is yourself and have to make it work even when times are rough."

A_Knighty-Knight,fdncnno,t3_em9ige,"I want her back, however, not immediately. I know it's dead, it's been, love doesn't leave you feeling disoriented when you wake, it doesn't make you dysphoric when you walk around the apartment you shared, the city you moved to. Love isn't supposed to leave you feeling colorless and feeling like you and all you do are insignificant."
ihateeelifeee123,fdn4x1s,t3_em9ige,Omg I relate! I'm still waiting for him to message me lol

ihateeelifeee123,fdnqfzn,t1_fdnlheg,About a yearish but he was my first and only love
redditlegacy689,fdnqkuq,t1_fdnqfzn,I can understand your feeling. I lost my first and only love of a 6 year relationship 6 months ago.
redditlegacy689,fdnqnkh,t1_fdnqkuq,And I feel exactly the same way. But my ex has someone else in her life now...
ihateeelifeee123,fdnqrtc,t1_fdnqnkh,I wouldnt know if my ex does a new girlfriend but im sorry im here if you want to talk ‚ù§Ô∏è
redditlegacy689,fdnr48c,t1_fdnqrtc,"Thank you I just dont know what to think right now. Basically she was my best friend even after the break up. But this new guy doesnt want us to talk and she told me that last weekend and that was also when she told me that she has someone else. I basically had a mental breakdown for 5 days since then and I am finally getting back up a bit again. 

She is still sending me random text and replying to my instagram stories eventhough she is not allowed to text me. So I am not sure what to do."
ihateeelifeee123,fdnrjms,t1_fdnr48c,Do not do anything. I was that girl that kept texting my ex when I had ended it. Only to hurt him every single time because I was too afraid to commit (I have issues...). Don‚Äôt fall for it and try to move on or at least work on moving on.

jaz0513,fdnjs3q,t3_em9ige,"I have so much anger bottled up for my ex, just when I was done back in July he dragged me back in and crapped all over my life again, his excuse this time was I can‚Äôt forgive you for adding your old friend back and while you‚Äôre thinking about a forever and even I‚Äôm thinking about you paying back for adding that friend"

ohlaulau,fdon7dp,t3_em9ige,"i think almost everyone goes through that phase, wanting them to actually understand and feel the pain they caused you...but i don't think that would make you feel better.
forgive yourself for making you go through that and don't bother thinking about someone who clearly doesn't appreciate you (still trying to convince myself of this lol)"
IsaacTH,fdpaxtt,t3_em9ige,"What you're feeling is a mix of hurt and loss. I'm guessing you believe he's doing perfectly fine while you're left hurting. It is very common to feel that way, partner hurts you and you're left to fix yourself. And all the while you have something of a vengeful feeling that you wish he was hurting to.

My advice is rather cliche but meaningful. Forgive and forget. Forgive but don't relive. What he is feeling has zero impact on your future opportunities. Don't let your past hold you back from a much greater future. 

Listen, it is easy to let your mind wander to some very dark thoughts. But here is the thing, we are not our thoughts. Just because you have these feelings does not mean that is who you are. Love yourself, and focus on what you do have."
semisweetly,fdq0oi0,t1_fdpaxtt,"Frick. This is how I feel. I'm here grieving over the loss of our relationship & I find out he has a dating profile, a month after our breakup. Now my mind keeps on thinking that he's out there hooking up and other dark thoughts.

And at the same time, I'm thinking, why do I even care? He's the one that ended our 3 year relationship.

It's so easy to get lost in our thoughts, it's a spiral to insanity. 

I started a journal to write down my thoughts & get it out of my head, so far it's helping."
IsaacTH,fdqvl9u,t1_fdq0oi0,"Getting your thoughts on paper is a great solution. Remember, the pain goes away, the more effort you put into moving forward, the quicker the pain leaves. 
He was your past, and now it's onto the future. Lessons learned my friend. I believe every relationship we lose leaves a lesson or two behind.

About 6 years ago I dated someone while I was in the military. I was always emotional because the military was simply not a good part of my life. I always reflect on how I was not a good boyfriend to her and she had every right to break up with me. My biggest regret is that she got caught in the crossfire of it all, but I believe she is the reason I'm a better person today. I grieved for almost a year until I was able to stand up and actually take the lessons to heart. I'm very grateful to her for slapping sense into me. Lessons learned."
semisweetly,fdrd1hb,t1_fdqvl9u,"My ex is in the Navy. He's a Communications Officer. He admits he has PTSD & I always think that's part of why he acts the way he acts. He doesn't want to get help because he says he doesn't need help.

You're right though, it's all lessons learned. And it's also his choices. Nothing I say or do will have him come back. Just have to swallow the pill & move forward."
IsaacTH,fdrdmse,t1_fdrd1hb,"I'm happy I can help you see that üòä

holoitsme,fdool1g,t3_em9ige,"He did call, text, invite me to dinner/get drinks etc. every damn day following the breakup, showing (actually faking) regret to some extent. Gave me hope several times, but each time I was left with nothing but disappointment. I went no contact (sort of, because we were attending the same dance class. I told him not to talk to me there but, yeah I know...). He reached out again telling me he wanted to get back together, promised he would regain my trust... Surprise surprise, he changed his mind two days later lol. Each time I fell for one of his his ego traps he blurted out the same excuses to slither back to his hole. I'm not saying it'll be the same for every relationship, but do not trust your dumpers blindly, immediately, especially the ones who have/show narcissistic tendencies.

Now he has a dating profile page after a month from breaking us up. It's just making me realize that our relationship meant nothing to him. So easy for him to throw it all away.
-zombie-squirrel,fdr5k44,t1_fdq0scn,It‚Äôs the worst feeling.
auramere,fdsbz4s,t1_fdr5k44,"Took the words out of my mouth. I found out around New Year's that my LDR ex might be seeing someone new, and it completely wrecked me. We broke up mid-2019. For months I had hoped for him to say he wanted me too. 

Guess not. Guess that he's not hurting as much as I am if he can just up and date someone else that quickly. 

I try to repeat a mantra of ""he doesn't give a shit"" to keep from sinking into the sadness lol. Cause he doesn't. He didn't give a shit in the months after we broke up. He doesn't give a shit now that he has someone new and actually with him in-person that I couldn't be.

I can relate to that, and I can provide the help and support without needing to be a judge of who did what .. all I can tell is his experience could be better or worse than mine, it's not a competition of who got hurt more or who is the good guy or bad guy in any side.. 

we just NEED comfort and closure from those who share the same dilemma to accept reality and let it sink in while trying to lookout for a new tomorrow."

I also went on a really nice date today, something I thought I wouldn't be ready for. It felt so GOOD. Even if it turns out to be nothing, I feel empowered.

My opinion, but I of course don't know what happened between you two and what kind of person she is: don't take her back if she hurt you, even if your heart want to. Use your brain in this situation. Don't have hope she will truly message you this and that you two will get together again. You're not weak for wanting her back, but she's still that same person with all the problems.

I don‚Äôt have to cry because of how worthless he makes me feel. 

I don‚Äôt have to drive myself crazy wondering why his mouth would whisper ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù but his actions would scream ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a fuck about you‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt have to feel like shit about myself because he couldn‚Äôt be bothered to give me the same love that I gave to him. 

I don‚Äôt have to settle for less than I deserve anymore.

HopkirkDeceased,fdjn8yv,t1_fdiue31,"Not OP but the abuse a toxic partner puts you through is very hard to see while you're going through it, so you weirdly accept it as normal without realising how skewed things have become. Toxic people thrive on getting others to accept shitty things as normal. And most people don't question normality."
waxedsoul,fdjp2zz,t1_fdjn8yv,"Yep and I'd also add- its because if you're a decent person, then you take their criticisms on board and start to believe that it's you with all the problems, not them. 

The constant undermining and targeted criticisms are designed to hone in on your weak spots and insecurities (we all have them). So because there's often a kernel of truth to the basis of their complaints, you blame yourself and vow to do better, try harder etc.

It takes a while before you come to the final realisation that nothing you could do would ever be enough to keep a high-conflict person happy."
HopkirkDeceased,fdjrj3i,t1_fdjp2zz,"So true!

In my case it got even more complex, I'd listen to their criticisms constructively and try to figure out a route for *us* to work through *their* problems.

What I didn't understand was they had no interest in the kind of accountability I was proposing, they just wanted conflict. This resulted in them digging in even deeper to undermine my self worth because they never wanted responsibility for their own emotions and actions, they wanted a punching bag who was always wrong. 

If their first emotionally manipulated blow didn't land they'd find a new weak spot and insecurity to hit. Anything became fair game for them when they weren't controlling me by getting the responses they wanted from me. But nothing could ever satisfy their contradictory needs until they themselves addressed it (which is what they don't want to do) so the abuse would always escalate.

Now I like to think I'm better at seeing the signs earlier on, if someone is willing to try with me to make a healthy relationship then I'll be all for it but I won't be sad about walking away from someone who guilts me or tries to undermine my self worth because they're insecure. They don't have the capacity to love themselves so they don't currently have the capacity to offer it to someone else."

Finally, as the clich√© goes, there could also be some unresolved issues from your childhood at play. Fear of abandonment, or sometimes growing up on a rough household will make it harder to leave. Those can be dealt with, but it takes the help of a therapist often, or a lot of salf-work, maybe with books."
BitesizegamerG,fdiyjyr,t3_elj2kr,"I was broken up with by my ex about two and half months ago. He has already practically slept with someone new (one month after leaving), and has been spreading stuff about me too. I've been saying both sides of our story. I miss him so much but I can now see how I could be better without him, despite still pining after him because I still love him. It hurts to know how little I and the relationship meant to him, but like some mutual friends and my other friends and my family have said, it appears that I have dodged a bullet. I wasn't perfect in the relationship but I definitely didn't deserve to be treated the way I have in the break up. During the relationship I forgave him so many times for lying to me, so I really resonate with what you're saying because I felt on edge all the time and sometimes didn't even know what to believe because I wanted to trust him but I knew he'd lied so much before and I was finding it hard. But now I don't need to feel as anxious all the time (which was making me lose myself and was driving me insane), because I don't need to worry about that anymore. He even lied to me about getting with someone so soon after leaving me, so clearly dodged a bullet. I think in the end, I'll be okay and I'll find someone who doesn't disrespect me so much to lie to my face so often and I hope all of you do too. But for now, focus on yourselves. Self love is so important in times like these, but I also think properly processing emotions, letting yourself feel to aid reflection and self growth/improvement is even more important. :)"

HollyDeAnna,fdk8ibs,t3_elj2kr,"This post just speaks in volumes to me. The absolute truth.

The worst breakup I had was with my ex of 2 years. We met online and there were signs already there that I shouldn‚Äôt have approached this dude at all due to his toxic giveaway online but I was very naive and liked a challenge so I started talking to him and crazy enough he actually stopped some of his toxic behavior he exhibited when we first met so I thought that was a good sign and good progress.

We had a small break after he started his new job because trying to balance that and a relationship was tough for him and I fully understood that. We were only separated for a month until we got back into the relationship again and honesty it was really good for awhile until I spent a week with him for vacation.

He started ghosting me after that but would constantly have time to be online posting stuff and he would leave me on read for days. So when I had enough I returned the favor. He sort of got the hint and tried to keep up his game by keeping me but I reached my breaking point and had to let him go because I was so broken by his actions I couldn‚Äôt pick up the pieces anymore. 

It didn‚Äôt take him long at all to jump on his tinder profile and find a girl in his area that he admitted to by sharing the story online (on here actually) and they were hooking up not long after ending things with me. A month had passed where I had stopped responding to his messages because I wanted to heal and I felt like cutting contact with him was the best because he knew how to lure me back in with that. 

He messaged me out of nowhere on my birthday asking me how everything was, etc. (trying to be nosey) and he told me he was only casually dating this girl and it wasn‚Äôt serious but he was constantly texting me everyday, viewing everything I would post online, and had intimate conversations with me about how he missed me and wanted to get back with me until I discovered his new girl and her friends had been keeping me under the radar because he had pictures and videos of him and I in his phone that she told him to delete and he refused to. 

So I caught him in a complete lie. He basically cheated on this girl for months who he claimed was not his gf but really was and they all tried to gang up on me and attack once I aired out the truth to them all about what he was doing behind the scenes.

 Needless to say he was not happy and he blocked me on everything. I stayed about of contact with him since then and it was the best thing that ever happened. So much in my life increased and success was my new best friend. I didn‚Äôt just dodge a bullet, I dodge a nuclear missile. This guy was a total narcissist that had me under his control. Constantly making me feel like I wasn‚Äôt good enough, never taking accountability for his wrongdoings and blaming them on me instead. He was awful. It was even more disgusting seeing the lies and false narrative stories he made up about me just to cope with his anger to make himself feel better. 

I‚Äôm sorry if someone reading this isn‚Äôt religious but a quote I saw that really spoke the truth about what had happened was: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about people God has removed from your life. He heard conversations you didn‚Äôt, saw things you couldn‚Äôt, and made moves that you wouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù And that‚Äôs facts."

Good_mineral,eo2714,top_level,"That probably sounds like the most ridiculous thing you've ever read in your entire life currently. The pain you feel is immesurable, worse than getting your bones smashed in by a steel crowbar and shot 5 times in your legs all at the same time. You feel hopeless and alone and unlovable. Your chest physically stings like it's being pierced by the sharpest knife. You look at everyone around you and tell yourself you'd trade your problems with them in a heartbeat no matter what it was. Yeah, it fucking sucks, but it's also the best thing that will ever happen to you. You will find yourself at seemingly rock bottom, but guess what? Nowhere to go but up, and there's nobody in your way to stop you. You lost your partner in exchange for yourself. You're a clean slate, a newborn in the world, except this time you're stronger, you're wiser, you're a rock. But, what you have to realize is that this is no walk in the park, this is a fucking war, and you're going to fight that war because you're the strongest motherfucker who ever lived, you're going to stop living for your ex and begin living for yourself, improving your life in every aspect and realizing that you were never really happy with them in the first place, you were instead feeding the addiction they caused you. Why would you hope for your vices back when you could instead find true and prolonged happiness at the end of fight. It WILL be the hardest fight you have ever fought, but it's the biggest victory you will ever win. I am still in the fight, but I see my progress and I already know that I am so much better off without the one who I thought brought me up, but in reality dragged me lower and lower. Forget them, but forgive them, because they only did you a favor by letting you free. We are Kings and Queens, and we can rule ourselves. Let them go so you can grab onto yourself once more.

Edit: spelling"
Testkaninen,fe84545,t3_eo2714,"Love the motivational speech and the wise word in regards to the battle to recover from heartbreak, focusing on yourself etc.

However, this text doesn\`t really do justice to those who actually have fulfilling relationships where they are happy, respected, feel loved, taken care of, growing and still get \*dumped\*(hate that word). These can often be the hardest ones to recover from.

In other words, this part:

\*..and realizing that you were never really happy with them in the first place\* - doesn\`t really jive with me, and sounds too specific to be good general advice for people.

Not all relationships are abusive, unloving, hateful, disrespectful and the likes, sometimes it is just two people that have grown apart, and one party tries to make the best possible choice for both of them. Even if it means breaking your best friend's heart.

I have had to let go of someone in the past that I knew was feeling happy and fulfilled in our relationship, and not some rose-colored glasses bs, she was in a good place with eyes towards the future, our future. She doesn\`t regret our time spent together and has confirmed that she was growing in a positive direction throughout our adventure.

So yeah, great motivational text - I just had to point this out based on my experience."

Good_mineral,fe8tysy,t1_fe84545,I understand this. Love is complicated and there's so many different ways things play out for people and different situations people deal with. This was just for me how my personal battle went and I thought it'd at least help inspire a couple others in similar emotional circumstances.
sabucoush,fe81wty,t3_eo2714,"Exactly. After my ex, I was depressed that I used to wake up crying in the middle of the night. I used to be so miserable that I was sick and tired of myself. I always thought that over means I lost everything and I didnt even had a string of hope to the future. It hurt so bad that sometimes I couldnt function well. I still have episodes of anxiety and depression. But, I am better than before 10x! I knew I had to pick myself up this hole. I knew I had no other choice but to help myself or else no one will. I knew I only had myself for the long run. As much as it hurts. I thought if my ex is ever coming back, I would rather let her see me healthy and happy than miserable and depressed. I stopped feeding to my addiction and my fears. Specially when my brain was my enemy, showing me all the negative possibilities. I used to see nightmares, even in my sleep I couldnt run away from this pain. It hurts so bad. Finally, after 10 months, I moved to a new country, quitting my job, and leaving everything behind, I started to heal. I started to enjoy life. I am laughing genuinely, I am even developing feelings for other people. I am in a much healthier state. I am no longer scared of losing her. The worst had already been done. There is nothing more my ex could do to hurt me. She blocked me, she found someone else, she got what she wanted. So be it. Now its my turn to enjoy my life. In fact, I am thankful to the break up. If it wasnt for that, I wouldnt have picked a new hobby, played sports, traveled alot, had a new hair cut, challenged myself to my core. I am literally a different person than I was few months ago. I started meditating for a while, I started to be more positive about life, I learned to forgive and excuse people, whenever possible, I have become a better version of my self. I lost so much weight. I learned alot about Neurology!!!! And how the brain functions, just to understand my pain and heal it. After I tried literally everything now I peacefully let go. I am no longer clinging to the idea of her coming back at some point. It alright. I understand that it wont work anyway. My ex wouldnt appreciate me and due to distance and different perspectives of our lives, I dont want that pain again. It was a tough journey, specially that we were in: same sex, different cultural backgrounds, different languages, and religions kind of relationship. It would have never worked out. And to be honest? My family deserves to have a better in-law. I need to make them proud too. My grandma deserves to be happy with me. You know, I would have fought everything to please my ex. I would have stood up against everyone and my culture just to be with her. But she sold me. She rejected me, even with everything I gave her. She rejected it. Why should I sacrifice more? For who? She is selfish and she only cares about her image and her happiness. She was right when she chose her family over me. I should do that too. Keep up the good fight. Stay strong. A weak person is never attractive."

3) You can't meet everybody even with social media because the billion chinese,indians and africans probably don't have tinder.

4) Personal preference for personality,body type,race,no smokers etc

5) Time and Money issue with traveling with everyone outside my city.

By the time your ex has realized that the grass is not greener on the other side you will have become a strong, confident person and will meet the love of your life.

Almost 5 months on, I‚Äôm still nowhere near ready to date again. Sometimes I wish I could lose feelings and love as quickly as she did as she‚Äôs living her best life and I‚Äôm living my worst"
holyredbeard,fe24shq,t1_fe1rmsz,"Believe me, 3 months is nothing and they are still in their honeymoon phase. That phase will end and it's then when your ex will face the problems with the fact that she entered a rebound. When she see her flaws and remember how you were in the same situations. Being in love dulls your vision and makes you only see the good stuff, but that ends for everyone sooner or later.

It's even more likely if she met that guy that quickly because the chance she met ""the one"" directly after you is really really low. Instead she missed intimacy, being in love and her heart was bleeding for that feeling. She found a guy and hooked up with him and because he was her type and they clicked they got together. But again, that guy definitely has a lot of things she don't like and she will see as soon as the honeymoon phase is over.

It is so much better to heal completely and being fine with being alone. Then you don't become desperate and you won't take the first best that fits your type of person. When it comes to being able to stay in long term relationships that will stay happy you really have to find a person with a personality, values and all that you could really live with. Sooner or later the relationship will start to fall apart otherwize and in worst case you stay together because both are afraid of being alone (or because of kids).

I have several friends in long term relationships, one with kids, who seems so happy with their girlfriends. But when we get drunk together they start to complain how sucky their lifes really are."

Eagleassassin3,fe2g6ik,t1_fe1rmsz,"While you are right that some rebound relationships become the real deal, 3 months is nothing. They could be super into each other right now and in 5 months it could be completely different. They could break up in a year, in 3 years, in 5 years. You can‚Äôt know that. They could get married and divorced in a year.

One thing you should do is block your ex out of your life. You shouldn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing and they shouldn‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing. The fact that you know so many details about their relationship shows that you‚Äôve been invested in it. You should go fully no contact and not hear from her at all until you‚Äôve moved on.

Also, keep in mind that people only post their best memories and pictures on social media. Just because you see them being super happy doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs like that all the time irl"

I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I lashed out, re-opened old wounds, even almost called the new guy my ex‚Äôs name during fights. These last two years were a colossal train wreck for my mental health, physical, financial and career. 

It has been a month since we broke up. I have awesome housing (tho temporary) whole new routine, I lost a good chunk of weight and I have a good shot at getting a job very soon back in my field.

JEDA38,fe2j4ro,t1_fe24shq,"I think ""rebound"" and ""honeymoon"" phase are really vague terms that mean something different for every person and every relationship situation. I don't think a ""rebound"" is necessarily defined by time waited after the end of a relationship...I think it has more to do with a person's mental state when entering a new relationship. If a person isn't ready and is carrying around their emotional baggage to bring into a new relationship...then it's a rebound. 

But I think it's important how the relationship ended, who ended it, and if they are emotionally ready to move on. Sometimes longer relationships may have been dying for a long time and people end up being emotionally checked out before they even break up. In that case, after you deal with your own emotional shit, why continue to grieve over a relationship that was already dead...you dont really owe the other person anything, you just owe yourself time to cope and get yourself emotionally right. That may take one person 3 weeks, another 3 months, or another 3 years. Who are we to judge?"
Starmoon85,fe28j5r,t1_fe24shq,"That was really insightful, thank you! 

She always I said I was the ‚Äúone‚Äù, but I think she now realises her new guy is better for her. How long do you reckon the honeymoon phase will last for? 

Her and I did fit so well emotionally, sexually, we were both goofy at times and could then we serious and ‚Äúdeep‚Äù when talking about things. Sadly we were polar opposites politically and that caused arguments. She would also drop plans with me occasionally to go hang out with her sister and her partner and that caused resentment. We were both far from perfect but nobody is. Overall though we honestly thought we‚Äôd grow old together. It really breaks my heart she could move on so quickly and discard me from her life."
Starmoon85,fe28n4n,t1_fe284ga,They‚Äôll be in it for the long haul. Sadly
Starmoon85,fe2k8nc,t1_fe2g6ik,"She blocked me in November, and her new guy did as well even though we‚Äôve never spoke. I‚Äôd feel childish blocking her in return. My friend can look at her profile though so that‚Äôs why I know what‚Äôs happening (he doesn‚Äôt have her as a friend but he can still see some things that are public). The new guy is friends with all her friends and family on Fb and they‚Äôve met in real life as well. It kinda bums me out as I‚Äôd met them numerous times but they were never Fb friends. Just shows that her friends and family like the new guy better than they liked me. Their opinion is important to my ex so she‚Äôll be justified in her mind that the new guy is a better partner for her than I was"
Starmoon85,fe5d3h6,t1_fe4160r,"Wow 2 years you were with a ‚Äúrebound‚Äù. That‚Äôs a long time! 

I‚Äôm glad to hear you‚Äôre in a much better place and worked on any issues that you needed to work on. Kudos for that. 

I hope it catches up with my ex, but I doubt it. Even if it does I‚Äôm sure it will be years down the line"
SpinningBandicoot,fe4gzhc,t1_fe2j4ro,"Incorrect.

 literally rebound means jumping into a new relationship right after a breakup . That means the other person who did the breaking up had someone ON THE REBOUND. not that hard to understand lmao

Honeymoon just means theyre clicking and getting along and not looking at their flaws and red flags and are constantly wanting to spend time together.

Bringing problems into a new relationship is literally just baggage"
holyredbeard,fe2a36i,t1_fe28j5r,"Believe me, she will miss you sooner or later. How long the honeymoon phase will last is impossible to say, but it doesn't matter. The odds are she will end up feeling in a worse state that you are in right now.

Just like the many decade long relationships on this subreddit people never thought would die, that did, I truly doubt this will be her last relationship."
Eagleassassin3,fe2qj9h,t1_fe2k8nc,"Yeah but it doesn‚Äôt matter what your ex thinks. She‚Äôs just one person. It doesn‚Äôt matter what her family thinks either. They‚Äôre more likely to agree with your ex. If they all think this new guy is a better partner for her, this doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre right. But even if they were, that doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs better than you. You also don‚Äôt know what happened. Maybe he just asked them what their facebook was and then they became friends there, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they have this amazing friendly relationship. It‚Äôs not like they were going to refuse the friendship request. So there‚Äôs no need to make useless assumptions. 

Relationships have to between 2 compatible people. If they‚Äôre more compatible than you guys were, that doesn‚Äôt mean anything on if he‚Äôs better than you or not. They could both love to eat people which would make them compatible, but on a moral scale they‚Äôd both be worse than you, unless you‚Äôre a cannibal yourself but you get the idea. So you can find someone for you who is more compatible to you than your ex was.

You should just ignore them all together. Your friend shouldn‚Äôt look at what they‚Äôre doing either. You don‚Äôt need to know because it doesn‚Äôt matter. Just focus on yourself."

JEDA38,fe5junc,t1_fe4gzhc,"Thanks for trying to mansplain ""rebound"" to me lol. I'm aware of the common definition of what a rebound is. I also understand that most people think jumping into a new relationship right away before dealing with their emotional baggage is not healthy...and it isn't healthy. 

My point in writing my post was that even if someone starts dating after 3 weeks, it shouldn't be labeled as this horrible ""rebound"" by their dumpee if the dumper has already dealt with their emotional baggage. I don't like how a lot of people on the subreddit criticize and blame others for trying to move on with their lives. You never know what someone has been through in a relationship. It's easy to blame and criticize the dumper (especially if they are starting to move on while you are still hurting)...but in reality, breakups suck for the dumper in most cases too."

The best thing you can do is to wish her a happily ever after and try to remember all the good times you two had together. These are yours, and yours only. And after a while - those are the ones that will make you smile.

Does it matter if she misses you? No - stop stroking your ego. You don\`t need her affirmation.

Does it matter if her new SO last for 1yr, 5, 10, life? a loud no. 

If you focus on you and building your life, you will get to a place where you wish her all the best. I see from your writing that you are not there yet. But work on improving yourself, help out other people, and you will be - that\`s a promise.

All the best, and remember to smile:)"

But I stay strong, do my shit, improving my guitar skills and have booked a solo trip to India for a month. There is no other way..."
Chunksies,fe321b7,t1_fe23u6a,"Gonna pipe up here.

I‚Äôm one of those people that can dead feelings easily. Once they‚Äôre gone, they‚Äôre gone. Can‚Äôt not hate someone etc. I‚Äôm happy as fuck being alone once a relationship is over. Which is where I‚Äôm at now. 

That being said. I get lonely sometimes too. And I‚Äôm surrounded by people I love. You have to be honest about your personal process. I read a book a week currently, keep my weekends quiet and calm. I have no stress and no desire for any. It‚Äôs quiet and sometimes quiet is hard. But I still feel lonely a lil bit. Overall though everything is good: made some major home improvements. Have a new car. Holidays booked and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve lost anything. That being said my breakup was last year, mid ish. I was over it before I left. I was the dumper. 

If it takes you 6 months or 6 years to get to that stage, do so slowly. Don‚Äôt rush a single second of it. Once you‚Äôre happy being alone there is no going back. But make sure you truly are. No set backs then long term. 

I also wanted to add that I am a prime example of a rebound turning out wrong. I left one relationship, within 2 months got with someone else. Although I‚Äôd never express this to either guy, I was not even close to over my first relationship when I embarked on the second. In fact, feelings never went and I still love the first guy.  So although to everyone on the outside I was over it; moved on for a year and all of that, truth be told because of some trauma I was going through I never fully processed it all. Which doesn‚Äôt actually affect my life now because it‚Äôs been so long. But it was a shocking realisation. One that I have to navigate through. It will set me back a little - not hugely but some of you can avoid this stage if you still solo. 

I‚Äôd never go back. But things aren‚Äôt always as they seem. Don‚Äôt assume from a highlight reel you know What is truly going on."

It hurts to think about and I get physically ill imagining them. All my friends say that rebounds don't last, they're just his way of dealing with the break up while my way is getting healthy and healing. The hurt we all feel now watching our exes behave like they're moving on is what healing feels like. Healing is not a comfortable soothing process, its agonizing and frustrating and demeaning.

kittykatmorris2390,fe2i1ly,t3_enmfmx,"I'm not sure agree with this.  My experience has been that, although my ex husband was the one to have left for greener pastures 4 years ago and seems to be happily entrenched there, I'm the one that has ended up bouncing around in failed relationships. I will admit that the first one after he left was just as you said, a rebound, and I partnered up with a totally polar opposite to my ex, but I also realized that there were fundamental differences that did not make it worth staying just for the feeling of being in a couple. I decided then to take some time to look for what I really want in a relationship, and after nearly two years and one more short lived and disastrous connection,  I've opted to focus on the here and now with just myself. I don't want to think I'm permanently soured on relationships, but I do prefer to be in one with somebody who shares a lot of the same ideals, but also doesn't smother or cage me, nor I, him.  I like having my independence and do not take well to somebody thinking he needs to be in or take charge, and I've met many men in the last couple of years who have shown those aggressive tendencies far too much along with a sense of entitlement and possessiveness. I'm not saying I want a door mat,  but I do want an equal partnership, and at this point, there's not a lot of men out there who seem to agree with that."
Testkaninen,fe34y6a,t1_fe2i1ly,"Most men will not be attracted to strong women, this is true. It\`s a biological fact that most men are encoded to be providers and to be ""in charge"" of the pack. This is not because of any new-age psycho nonsense like bad upbringing, narcissism or egocentric behavior. This is nature\`s own blend of instincts, hormones, and genes.

You have men that like to be dominated and women who like to be ""in charge"" - but those are, and will for a long time, be the minorities(throughout our lifespan anyways..) Most of us humanoids prefer nature's own design shaped over thousands and thousands of years. 

Equal partnerships are basically non-existent, all couples have a floating power-dynamic, and even if it can get close to equal, it never quite reaches the finish line.

I wish you all the best, and I hope you find a man who can be happy with a modern, strong and independent woman, these are in short supply. A piece of quick advice would be to not waste time seeking out or dating any alfa\`s or dominating types. You need the chill guy that avoids eye contact in the bar."
kittykatmorris2390,fe3a4wt,t1_fe34y6a,"Yes, an alpha/dom man has zero appeal to me, again for the fact that they want subservience,  and I'm definitely not that.  I don't mind a man who knows what he wants and can go after it, and can take care of himself and others as well, but he also needs to know that I don't NEED him to take care of me. I certainly am not high maintenance, nor materialistic, and the one who I tried to make things work with after my marriage broke down pretty much was everything I am not.  He tried to move into my territory and take it over, while constantly buying, buying, buying without paying attention when I said no or stop.  Two years later and I'm still finding and disposing of things he left behind here that I never asked for nor wanted/needed. Communication was definitely not his forte,  and I nearly lost who I was to that.  I reclaimed my power and, although I am not actively searching at the moment, I would love to find a man with the right blend (or close to it) of strength, charm, daring, humility, empathy and humour, amongst other attributes, and I don't mean looks... they matter little. Maybe it's a pipe dream, but I'm hoping not. I'm quickly approaching 50, and I'd rather not spend the rest of my life alone, but I also will not settle for less than I feel I deserve and want."

Often enough, this is the official version. My ex made out (""and more"") before the breakup, didn't tell me, slept with him shortly after. I found out but kept my composure in the sense that only one shared friend from the friend group knows of the overlapping. Everybody else is scratching their head wondering how she could move on so fast (~1.5 months post breakup it's official with the new guy), but only the two shitheads, the shared friend and me know the full story.

streamingdreams,fdihq4e,t3_eliz5b,I was looking back at our old text messages right before coming across this. I just wonder what he is thinking about me right now or if he misses me at all.
kelsodisco,fdijc2k,t1_fdihq4e,"I think we all think about those things, I know I do.  It may be a good idea to eventually delete those messages. Might be a good step to moving on."
c0ccuh,fdkgiv3,t1_fdijc2k,"I backed them all up. I see no reason to delete them. Same goes for pictures. There are confined to where I wouldn't stumble over them, no need to erase them."
kelsodisco,fdkgwop,t1_fdkgiv3,But why would you keep them?
c0ccuh,fdki9wr,t1_fdkgwop,"Because most pictures of me of the last nearly 6 years were made with her. They are beautiful memories, and I want to be able to look back in a few years and be grateful for them. Or were you asking about msgs? Idk, that's a better question. Maybe because I haven't given up 100%, maybe we can back together in few years? But they certainly are not as important as the pictures. The first few weeks we wrote each other were truly electric."
swmitabyss,fdivyzx,t3_eliz5b,Bruh...it‚Äôs been a week since he‚Äôs talked to me. I‚Äôve been half assing ‚Äúmoving on‚Äù but low key waiting for a text. He texted me early today and I greeted him back. Since then I‚Äôve been waiting for a buzz from my phone like a desperate hooker and saw this instead. There are no coincidences.
swmitabyss,fdiw7h5,t1_fdivyzx,"I‚Äôm honestly glad it‚Äôs over, but salty as the Don Juan Pond that he ended it first. But life must go on."
L_Sparks,fdlftww,t1_fdivyzx,"Sis I feel you. Its been a week since he's talked to me. Even though I was the one that ended it...im still low key waiting for a text. It feels so shitty and i do think im half assing ""moving on""."
ttwlittlebear,fdivl1h,t3_eliz5b,"I haven‚Äôt called or texted him. Pretty sure I‚Äôm blocked though but it feels good.  He did this so he can grow and that‚Äôs what I want to see those I love to what‚Äôs best for them, even though knowing I was toxic I didn‚Äôt mean to be. Thanks for sharing, I‚Äôm proud of myself."
Xelfi88,fdjeju0,t3_eliz5b,"I wish I can be strong, but I'm not. Everyone else is doing so good"
kelsodisco,fdjwpoo,t1_fdjeju0,"You know something? I think about this a lot too. I reached out more than I should have.. it probably only pushed her further away from me. I want to tell you, you get to the point where it just doesn‚Äôt matter. You start to forget what you even wanted to say or put across to them. You are strong and you just have to keep moving forward. Wishing you the best."

I spent months hating myself and feeling insecure and worthless and I didn‚Äôt want to feel like that anymore. Today is his nameday and I know how much that means to him and I wish I could text him. But I know deep down that this is the best thing I can do for myself. It hurts I miss him and I wish I could talk to him again, but I know that feeling like I‚Äôll never matter hurts even more."

kelsodisco,fdjwviw,t1_fdj9p5z,"You know I wonder if that‚Äôs how she felt when I blew her up. (Looking back I wish I wouldn‚Äôt have.) I hope you can keep strong, I know that does probably hurt. He‚Äôs just feeling lost. Just as long as it was for the best, then you did the right thing."

We have a marriage to discuss, stuff to sort out, and a flat.  It doesn‚Äôt help we are in different countries, 

I can‚Äôt believe the way she has treated me since she wanted to break up (by text btw)... ignored any attempt to reply to my calls etc... and when she has replied it has just been abusive.. 

It‚Äôs a huge shame, I love this chick and can forgive her faults, but she is slowly moving down from the pedestal that I put her on, eventually she will fall off and become just another person I used to know.

It‚Äôs been 4 weeks in case anyone is wondering x

Big love to all those that have been dumped, it‚Äôs hard, and I know We‚Äôll get through this, be strong, not weak like I seem to be. X"

So remember that, even if you want to txt them they may just go back to doing that and you realize how un-interested you are in them.

Now I‚Äôm moving on, doing so well but there are random nights where I feel SO WEAK. I left him, it was excruciating but necessary, and every now and then I want to text him and let him know I am thinking about him or that he still means something to me.
But I feel it‚Äôs not fair to him, maybe it will make me
Feel better but only bring him pain. I know he is struggling deeply with the break up but we only talk about business and have never really discussed the emotions surrounding the divorce since our divorce conversation. All emotional communication shut down....so I find these moments of weakness in which I want to communicate but, I can‚Äôt find the words to say and it doesn‚Äôt feel appropriate..."

I feel so strong and then I cry so deeply, this sucks and it hurts so bad. I  tried so long to be his lady and then he only came back once I was trying to move on from him, after he told me to let him go. He played with my heart and it hurts sooooo sooo baddddd...."

Also heartbroken and I feel like there's no tommorrow and there will be no SO, but there is hope and life is not only about ""love"". It is also about all the other aspects in life, like passion, hobbies, sports, music, etc. I feel like I've realized this too late and that I've cried over my ex for too long. I'm still sad and I'm still crying, but it's OK. It's normal to feel down for a couple of days if you never give up. Sometimes I want to give up and I don't even want to exist, but after a good sleep, it doesn't even matter and I start to ask myself ""Why did I say that yesterday? Why was I crying myself to sleep? What are these suicidal thoughts?"" Well... I guess this is just the ""emotional rollercoaster"" and I finally accepted that my life will be like that for a while. It's all normal to cry and be sad since you deeply loved someone and that you cared a lot about the relationship. We never chose the breakup and we never chose to be dumpees. It was their choice and we had to deal with it no matter what. It's difficult to adapt and it takes a lot of time to change emotional habits and behaviors. Stay strong heartbroken fellow redditor! :) Better days are also ahead :)"
lucy851,fec3mul,t1_feb8r9h,I can relate to you. My relationship of 14 years ended a little over a month ago. We were together since I was 19. I have never dated anyone else so rebuilding a life without him is hard. Feel free to message me of you want to talk.

Mine told me there was a breakdown of communication. After all those intimate moments. She used to look me right in the eyes saying I'm the man she's been looking for and that she loves me.

It's all same shit mate. I won't change for anyone. Deep down it hurts knowing that she's with  another man but I am fed up of coming with shit that she says I told her in which I never did. She wanted to breakup that's all. Sometimes I  wonder if she's happy. Same thing will happen with the new guy. When the dopamine levels reduce its on repeat. 

There's one saying that you will manage to find someone the same , worse or even better.

It depends from you to not let yourself down. Hit the gym, walk your dog, and do old stuff that made you the woman or the man you are today.


And if you're reading this, you're just amazing!  Life is short to ruin it for the egoism of another human being."

Better to just let go. Housing anger and resentment is just another form of their control over you, which if they left, they forfeited.

Clothes and ""fashion"" weren't that important when I was still in a relationship with them. Now, I'm taking care of myself  instead of my ex and it's feels so relieving. It feels like I'm finally redirecting all the positive ""energy"" to myself instead of doing it for them."
helliswaytooclose,febm3pm,t3_eoa97y,im trying
Crystal_God,febmwot,t1_febm3pm,"I‚Äôm trying too man, we‚Äôre gonna make it I promise. You always have those things in the back of your head that you know deep down you should be doing to get better but you don‚Äôt do them because it hurts too much. But ignore that pain and do those things anyways, keep yourself busy, once you learn self love you‚Äôll realize you don‚Äôt need to rely on another person to be happy. But take it slow, one step at a time."
RedRiki24,febnnym,t3_eoa97y,I still love her..... and Idk I just feel like I‚Äôm never going to find love like that again it was so perfect
psych_goat,febsyx0,t3_eoa97y,Yes to this 100%. This gave a confidence boost!
Prince_Autumn,febue6j,t3_eoa97y,"Thank you. I guess I needed this. I was often sad before I was with my ex-girlfriend and I'm sad even now after our breakup, but I was my own person before and I'm still standing now.

OP, Whatever you may be going through at the moment, I wish you the best of luck. You are an own perfect and independent person at the moment and I'm proud of that. I wish I was as far as you right now, your strength is admirable."
redditmeister_67,fec56hu,t3_eoa97y,"after all the times she said she couldn't wait for our marriage or to take care of our kid, She just lost interest in me"
maze91,fec6z2w,t3_eoa97y,This is the way.
chuullls,fecm2s9,t3_eoa97y,"But also, one more fuck from them would be üëåüèº"
deadxsilencexx,elcqil,top_level,"We all feel this way to an extent. 
Heartbreak is an emotional injury. Like all injuries it heals. If you can remember a time when you were very hurt, you healed didn't you? If you get a scratch on your arm it heals. It may reopen a few times but it goes away. So why wouldn't you get over heartbreak? It may not be today that it gets better but it sure will. Be patient with yourself and never back down. This is only a bad mental season. The sun will shine again and we will all get there. The toughest challenges always have the greatest rewards."
nmlester7,fdgwmxj,t3_elcqil,"I really needed this today, thanks."
deadxsilencexx,fdgwq5o,t1_fdgwmxj,You're welcome. Have a great day
xandrewsxano,fdh9fhn,t3_elcqil,Upvoted because I need this since I'm so alone right now.
deadxsilencexx,fdha85s,t1_fdh9fhn,Yeah and its ok to feel alone. We all feel that way to an extent. But just remember you aren't alone and you have to go through the bad stuff to get to the good again.
thesexyburrit0,fdhnhzb,t1_fdh9fhn,"Feeling alone is perfectly normal. However, it‚Äôs important to realize you‚Äôre never truly alone. Spend time with family, friends, and people who will love and support you :) believe me, I know it hurts but sooner than later you‚Äôll realize everything will be okay because in the end, it always is."
Cowboy_Bombpop,fdhbkww,t3_elcqil,Tragedy plus time equals comedy. Someday we'll look back on our pain and laugh about it.
deadxsilencexx,fdhdgve,t1_fdhbkww,Yeah we will.
syzygynoid,fdhlln1,t3_elcqil,"It's been around 18 months and I'm no better, so I just don't know. Long time for a bad mental season"
deadxsilencexx,fdhltiq,t1_fdhlln1,It is. But that doesn't mean it won't get better it just means you needed more time than some other people
syzygynoid,fdhnz4h,t1_fdhncjf,"I appreciate that you're trying to help and I know this will come across as rude and I apologize for that. But the things you are saying, I've heard them all before. I go to therapy once a week and struggle with these concepts each time, been going the entire time since the breakup, and the idea of ""love your self"" is totally alien to me, I can't even imagine what that would be like. I do not know what it will take for me to ever see that I have any worth"
ratzerman,fdi4ljp,t1_fdhnz4h,"As sick as this sounds, what you said actually made me feel a fraction of a percent better. There's actually someone out there as shattered as I am. Thank you for being brave enough to speak up. All of this advice, all of this ""love yourself"" stuff sounds totally alien. You might as well say that teaching yourself how to breathe underwater helps. My mind rejects it instantly as impossible, absurd, and even a little insulting. I got over my wife leaving me in a few months, and we were married for 10 years. This one feels different. Much, much worse. It's been almost a year. When she left me for another man, she took everything I liked about myself with her, and I'm never getting it back. Just like you said... I do not know what it will take for me to ever see that I have any worth again."
Undead_Og,fdho5ha,t1_fdhnz4h,"It's not rude.  I've been there before.  Eat healthy avoid indulgence's, make plans, gym gym gym, read books, find a hobby that you've neglected. it seems cliche, but it works.  I promise you, it works."
A_Knighty-Knight,fdiacgu,t1_fdi4ljp,"I struggle with the concept myself, instinctively I already care about myself enough to still be kicking, eating, working, seeking therapy and making myself healthier. Consistently being told to ""love yourself"" and find my ""self-worth"" becones repititious rhetoric, I basically have to tell myself that she's a worse person than what I'm aware of. I dunno anymore, essentially I'm having to bury more shit and continue on to what? Hope some poor random woman sees me, hopefully and ACTUALLY gives a shit about me to a degree to hold onto the honeyed promises said in some ""honeymoon"" phase? There's this indifference in me now, guess it's my fault, shouldn't have believed that horseshit in the first place. I almost feel horrible for not caring that she's outta my lofe for good now..."
syzygynoid,fdhp8jm,t1_fdho5ha,"does it? I go to physical therapy (I have an injury) and do cardio, I have hobbies, I eat OK enough, I quit drinking. I get really confused when people say these things build self worth, as if horrible people out there don't also work out, have hobbies and friends, etc. the only thing that matters in life is the state of your soul and mine is broken and unattractive. For the life of me I just don't know how to see otherwise"
Undead_Og,fdhqu5d,t1_fdhp8jm,"Thus isn't about being a horrible person.  It's about self improvement.  But, with any journey, one must want to arrive at a destination.  You'll get there."
cestlavie2728,fdi38h6,t1_fdhp8jm,"Does it help at all to try to see things ""as they are""? Instead of loving yourself automatically, does it help to kind of assess the good, the bad, and the ugly? And then to celebrate the good and be grateful for it, work on the bad with realistic goals without getting too impatient, and forgive yourself for the ugly while also working to improve, and perhaps trying to do extra good to make up for it?"
Bongsworth,fdiioji,t1_fdhp8jm,"I relate to this so much so do mot feel alone. I am going on 13 months myself and feel no better. Did all the things but my mind is still broken. It is like the mystery that we havent solved yet.

Wish you the best, us love time grievers have it rough."
lindseyisbusy,fdhwdtr,t3_elcqil,"If it‚Äôs any comfort to anyone, I thought I‚Äôd never recover from my breakup. I thought I‚Äôd be sad and regretful for the rest of my life. I thought I had lost my soulmate. I thought that there couldn‚Äôt be anyone out there who was feeling as much pain as I could. I couldn‚Äôt do anything without hurting. 

But today, 4 months later, it‚Äôs safe to say that I feel nothing for him anymore. I even hooked up with him a couple days ago to see if there was anything left, and felt nothing. I actually was annoyed by his presence. I was very relieved after he went home.

I promise you‚Äôll heal and you‚Äôll realize that you‚Äôre so much better off without them."
deadxsilencexx,fdhyiba,t1_fdhwdtr,This is exactly right.
Eagleassassin3,fdi26xx,t1_fdhwdtr,"That is very nice to hear. Thank you. I feel like I lost the love of my life. I wanted to spend my life with her and share experiences with her. Now I have to say goodbye to all those dreams. If you were able to recover from this, then I should be able to as well."
five43am,fdhidsl,t3_elcqil,needed to hear this cos i cried after saying i wouldnt cry over him this year lol :(
deadxsilencexx,fdhj1vf,t1_fdhidsl,Its ok to cry about it. Its better to cry then let it build up.
DanelRahmani,fdhiebe,t1_fdhidsl,I saw a :( so heres an :) hope your day is good
ttwlittlebear,fdhpz5j,t3_elcqil,"I just keep crying, it feels worse at night. I was holding everything in and drinking to mask all my feelings but it‚Äôs been hitting me hard that he‚Äôs gone and has to intention on coming back. I‚Äôm trying to do positive things for myself and learn it‚Äôs okay to have emotions and to not act on my pain and allow everything to come to surface and see how I can learn from this."
deadxsilencexx,fdhqqdh,t1_fdhpz5j,Thats ok but cry out your emotions then you gotta just stay busy
lin0098,fdhrf03,t3_elcqil,i really needed this rn
deadxsilencexx,fdhsvzq,t1_fdhrf03,Yeah
The_Frag_Man,fdhtiij,t3_elcqil,"The other thing about deep injuries is that they leave scars, permanently"
deadxsilencexx,fdhu7ki,t1_fdhtiij,They do. But that doesn't mean they don't heal
troubleclef21,fdi17ys,t3_elcqil,It's been almost a year and I feel a little better not gonna lie. But I hate myself for dwelling on it so much. And I hate that I'm not motivated to do anything because of this. I have not been productive all this time and it's just a constant loop that I desperately want to get out of.
deadxsilencexx,fdi39xs,t1_fdi17ys,That will fade away. Don't hate yourself for it you did nothing wrong
blureglades,fdi3kwg,t3_elcqil,"Thank you. This post somehow has helped me to feel better in this healing process. I'm currently struggling with the depression, and that ""void in the chest"" feeling after my recent breakup. Some days I feel very well, I look back and the memories doesn't hurt anymore, and I think ""woah, I finally got over it."", but the next day the minimal thing makes me remember her, and I start missing everything and a lot of memories start bouncing in my head, I start wondering what she's doing or if she misses me too, I start making myself a lot of questions and I start feeling some sort of mixed feelings: sadness, melancholy, rage. It's hard. It truly hurts. Much love to everyone in the struggle."
deadxsilencexx,fdi6677,t1_fdi3kwg,And its gonna hurt. Its not impossible to get over though. And once you are happy and in a good place in life it will be worth this
brknhrt4me,fdiqdxk,t3_elcqil,Im glad to make you happy !
mariaviolette,fdhgtzo,t3_elcqil,Thank you. It means a lot.
kuynhxchi,fdhit3k,t3_elcqil,Thank you so much
deadxsilencexx,fdhj2at,t1_fdhit3k,Of course
JDNWACO,fdhyaaf,t3_elcqil,Since my bad break up about 5 years ago. I still can‚Äôt date or get attached. It kinda sucks cause I had found a good girl. But just can‚Äôt care for her like I should so I had to break it off with her.  I wish I could fall for her.  Just can‚Äôt.
deadxsilencexx,fdhyfbm,t1_fdhyaaf,You just haven't found the right girl yet. May I suggest looking into therapy possibly?
JDNWACO,fdhyoja,t1_fdhyfbm,Could be right. Dr did think I‚Äôm in depression but honestly don‚Äôt feel like it. Tried meds for a whole week. Didn‚Äôt like feeling like a zombie.  Idk. I honestly feel that I can‚Äôt never ever connect with another girl like the one I was crazy about. Makes me just want to stay single for ever
deadxsilencexx,fdhyzzr,t1_fdhyoja,You probably are just closed off. You won't want to be single forever most likely. There's probably just unresolved issues
JDNWACO,fdhz4es,t1_fdhyzzr,Yeah. Wish i could fig it out.  Might just have to try therapy.  I‚Äôve just always been a pretty closed person. Had a rough childhood so talking or showing any emotion was never big for me
deadxsilencexx,fdhzb2t,t1_fdhz4es,I'm a closed off person too so I get it. But if you could love her like that she won't be the only one
JDNWACO,fdhzeu3,t1_fdhzb2t,Hopefully your right. The most current ex. Literally nothing wrong with her. Doesn‚Äôt do anything I dislike. Pisses me off
deadxsilencexx,fdhzj6g,t1_fdhzeu3,She just wasn't right for you. I'm scared I won't find anyone I can love again either but you gotta remember how many people are actually in the world
brknhrt4me,fdi45u4,t3_elcqil,Best thing I have read so far since I joined over a year ago. Every day.
deadxsilencexx,fdi69jx,t1_fdi45u4,Thank you! I'm glad to know it possibly helped you
brknhrt4me,fdipbi9,t1_fdi69jx,It did. A lot. Have no friend to ask or guide me how to keep positive when it all seems WHY. you did help me thank ypu
deadxsilencexx,fdipewm,t1_fdipbi9,I get how you feel. If you would like to talk my pms are always open
stefblack,fdi82xp,t3_elcqil,He says he still loves me and wants to be with me again someday... but not now. He said he wants time to grow alone. I don‚Äôt know how to get over it. I can‚Äôt wait for him. It‚Äôs been 2 months and the pain makes me feel physically sick. I keep thinking about him being with other girls and I feel sick.
deadxsilencexx,fdi8kf2,t1_fdi82xp,Don't depend on him coming back. He might but it's not guaranteed
stefblack,fdi8yb5,t1_fdi8kf2,That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm finding it so hard to get over him... I know he probably won‚Äôt but there‚Äôs a chance he will
deadxsilencexx,fdiac4a,t1_fdi8yb5,Just tell yourself he won't
atroooo,fdi853o,t3_elcqil,I'm realizing this much is true  indeed.
deadxsilencexx,fdi8i20,t1_fdi853o,Thank you
brknhrt4me,fdipoge,t3_elcqil,I am clueless here. Pms? Sorry Im older generation.
deadxsilencexx,fdipqa7,t1_fdipoge,Pms just means you can message me.
deadxsilencexx,fdipr8r,t1_fdipoge,Its short for private messages
brknhrt4me,fdiqaxy,t1_fdipqa7,How do I message you?
brknhrt4me,fdipxk7,t3_elcqil,Your a kind hearted person for the offer. Unlike most. More people should be like you and this world would be a place where we can be happy inside.
deadxsilencexx,fdiq07y,t1_fdipxk7,Awe thank you. That made my day.
cridhebriste,fdjict0,t3_elcqil,Years now- not much better. New normal sucks.
deadxsilencexx,em2odj,top_level,"We all do it. We all get those days where we just can't do it. Its very hard. Its painful. But we have to realise that while we may miss our ex and want them, theres better out there for us. Whether that's a better mental state, better job, better grades, or even a better person. We might be slipping now but there are billions of possibilities for tomorrow. Make it count. Today may suck but that doesn't mean this is your forever."
pondweed222,fdlx81t,t3_em2odj,Needed this
deadxsilencexx,fdlxbkc,t1_fdlx81t,Glad I helped
footstepstothemoon,fdmbyfd,t3_em2odj,Reading this made me stop crying. Thank you!

Not_even_alittle,fdmfa2c,t3_em2odj,"Literally the last 48 hours I can‚Äôt get her out of my head. I miss her like fucking crazy, even though I know there‚Äôs no point feeling that way.

Breakups are exhausting."
deadxsilencexx,fdn21jp,t1_fdmfa2c,They are but they aren't impossible
haomeii,fdm78id,t3_em2odj,"Thanks. I needed these words so much. I still waver from time to time, I miss someone so much that I want to reach out again but I know the other person doesn‚Äôt feel the same way now so I‚Äôm gonna make a fool out of myself if I did. It sucks."
deadxsilencexx,fdm7g9x,t1_fdm78id,Yeah but it will be ok. You will find that better in your life. And one day you will have a good friend or a new so that stop that urge completely.
cestlavie2728,fdm4ikl,t3_em2odj,I'm looking forward to seeing what 2020 has in store.
deadxsilencexx,fdm4oio,t1_fdm4ikl,Same. Hopefully its a good year for everybody
Butler_Drummer,fdmglzu,t3_em2odj,"Thank you so much, I don‚Äôt think you could understand how much it means to read this at this moment. I feel like I‚Äôve been backsliding for 2 weeks after doing so well‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôve been telling myself I need to go to sleep tonight but I keep scrolling through Reddit and then I hit your post. There are a million different things that could‚Äôve happened that would‚Äôve led me to never seeing this, but here I am reading this when I feel like I need it the most. You‚Äôve helped calm what feels like drowning in endless anxiety. Thank you again for this."
deadxsilencexx,fdn23pm,t1_fdmglzu,Its great that I helped! Get some sleep btw. Sleep and dreams may suck but your body needs it.
Eagleassassin3,fdmqj2x,t3_em2odj,"It‚Äôs just so hard to realize that there‚Äôs a better person out there. My ex was amazing. I really wanted to have a family with her. I wanted to have a daughter that looked like her. Forgetting about all that and moving on, thinking that there will be someone else to love is so hard. But I still need to focus on being the best version of me no matter what she does. I know that it will get easier with time."
deadxsilencexx,fdn26iz,t1_fdmqj2x,Exactly. And remember. Theres 7 billion people in the world. You will find your girl.
MotoAdventureJunkie,fdm81qz,t3_em2odj,Man I‚Äôm trying but its hard. Not being able to find a job hasn‚Äôt helped me at all :(
deadxsilencexx,fdm84jw,t1_fdm81qz,You will one day. Don't worry. Jobs may be difficult to find but just keep trying.
MotoAdventureJunkie,fdm8ceu,t1_fdm84jw,Ugh the desires to give up is so strong. It‚Äôs been two months for me. We were married 4 years and I fucked it all up. I just want to not hurt anymore.
deadxsilencexx,fdmajjb,t1_fdm8ceu,Yeah but you also have to remember its been 2 months. The first 4 months usually are terrible. I'm 6 months along in my first breakup. Today I got sad because I miss him but I remembered how far I've come. I'm still bummed right  now mainly because I hate being single but you will have gradual improvements until you reach the other side.
Bathsalttime,fdmhr9l,t3_em2odj,Thank you for this.

flowing_sun,fdn0kad,t3_em2odj,"Sunday was one of the worst days for me. We used to spend every single weekend in my flat together and had so much fun. This was the first day that I actually truly spent alone, away from friends or family in the city we both live. Anxious to start my new job the next day, I just subconsciously hoped that she‚Äôd just arrive at my home so we could talk. I typed and deleted messages to her, it took a lot of willpower not to send anything."
deadxsilencexx,fdn1pdm,t1_fdn0kad,Hey but you didn't. Thats very good. It will be like that for a while but it will get better.
CockAToo87,fdmmsd4,t3_em2odj,"Almost slipped up and texted her tonight until I read this, thank you!"

jubiflu,fdn1ise,t3_em2odj,"It is hard. 1 month since the breakup and I was doing fine, going out with my friends, playing videogames, going on a date with a new nice person. But yesterday it just hurted so bad that I went and talked to him. at first it didnt feel like an humiliation because he was asking to get back, but after I spoke to him I felt weak and stupid. I felt like I was moving backwards. But anyways, life is like this. Hold on you all!"
deadxsilencexx,fdn1nek,t1_fdn1ise,Exactly. There are gonna be those times but it's perfectly normal

idontknowtesy,emu3eb,top_level,"Believe it or not but you‚Äôre in much better position than the dumpers! Use this opportunity to work on yourself, become a much better version of you! 

Meanwhile they‚Äôre drinking, partying and pretending to be okay (Yes, they‚Äôre hurting as well but not as much in the beginning), you‚Äôre going to the gym, learn new skills etc.

The way dumpers feel is the opposite to our (dumpees) feelings, we get sad straight after the break up and they feel relief but they will get sad later on when we‚Äôve already moved on, it will hit them. 

Stay in no contact, stay out of their social media, they don‚Äôt post bad moments. 
Use this time to learn how to love and better yourself.

TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY! 
Be strong!

NOTE: This only applies if you weren‚Äôt abusive (physically and emotionally) in the relationship!"
holyredbeard,fdrazr7,t3_emu3eb,"Totally true. I fell in love with a girl 15 years ago and we were like soulmates. Together for 3 years and even got engaged.

Time went by and then out of sudden she pulled away. I got clingy, needy, controlling and desperate. She broke up and I got even more pathetic. She was acting really bad and still I reached out and begged til I gave up.

I moved on and eventually didn't even think about her anymore. It was really a mindset, I just decided to give up, fuck it all.

After 2-3 months I met a girl on a party and realized that damn. There are so many hot chicks out there and I can get them. My self esteem got better and better and after a month the following happened.

I was at a party with lots of people and out of nowhere I got this SMS: ""Hi! We are at the same party. Do you want to meet up tomorrow for a romantic dinner?"" It was my ex, and I had deleted her number from my phone and memory. I didn't reply but the day after I saw the message again and looked up the number, and it was her.

By that time I had completely got over her. I saw my value and how hot chicks I could get.. My ex was nothing but a dulled memory. Not attractive at all to me anymore. I replied: ""Hi [name]! Sorry but I am not interested, but thanks for the invitation.""

She replied: ""What has happened to you? You were so romantic!"".

Well, I moved on and with No Contact I could see things how they really were. The obsession was making me blind and really this girl was not even a girl I would consider as a one night stand anymore. Especially because how she treated me before.

True story."
Bruin_NJ,fdrd6oq,t1_fdrazr7,"Damn dude .. this is marvellous!! I can't wait for the day this happens to me. I am dying to reach that stage and I wanna do exactly the same you did - when she reaches out to me, just ignore her. I am sure that'd the best feeling, right? I am so happy for you bro! Keep moving fwd and keep growing!"
throwaway314159099,fdrn5hj,t1_fdrazr7,"Wow. Good for you, that‚Äôs awesome and I‚Äôm happy you‚Äôre in a better spot. I‚Äôve started to realize how shitty my ex was to me (I‚Äôm the dumpee) and how he treated me, especially after no contact since the break up. I realized how blinded and manipulated I was, and although still hurting as it‚Äôs a fresh wound, I‚Äôm excited and ready to be in your position / mindset. Congrats again!"
bestsnowflake,fdrpty6,t1_fdrazr7,"Damn, thanks for sharing your story, it gives me hope. 3 weeks NC here and I'm in the rollercoaster phase, but I'm getting used to these feelins day by day."
Zergs1,fdvbaos,t1_fdrazr7,Dude my girlfriend and I litterally just brokeup 2 hours ago and you have no idea how good this makes me feel. I'm already excited to get past this and go back out there
holyredbeard,fdru82o,t1_fdrpty6,"Anytime. And you know what? I am the dumpee as we speak. She dumped me two days before Christmas and I have been a total mess. I had all these plans on how to get her back, looking at all these sites and even buying a damn book. I totally forgot about this experience.

One month prior to the breakup I had booked an appointment with a couple counselor. It was today and yesterday I remembered it and asked my now ex girlfriend if we should go anyway. It may be good for us, and honestly I though this was a possible way to make her understand that she's made a mistake.

The therapy was horrible. My ex clearly manipulated the therapist and made it sound like everything was my fault and the therapist took her part. I was suffering from depression when we moved together and I wasn't really a fun guy by that time. Even so my ex blamed me for the relationship falling apart and even made it sound like it was okey for her to try to hook up with her boss whom she had a crush on, while I was depressed.

After the session my ex told me that this was really good, it made her realize even more I made a good decision breaking up with you. This was so horrible. I have been such a great guy despite me being depressed and never did anything to hurt her. I only wasn't a fun an socializing guy, and that was basically the reason for all this. I called myself sick from work and lay in bed crying all day. I was a mess, broken down into molecules. And then all of sudden I remembered this experience and it all became clear. If this could happen then it can (will!) happen again. I am fooled, blinded. It's an illusion.

My ex came home and was expecting me to be a total mess. But I was almost happy, because of this. Because I know this will be the same case. I can't know of course if she will come back to me, but frankly I don't care anymore. She has shown her true self and she isn't worthy me. She is the looser. She has lost the oppurtunity to be with a great and unique guy like me. She fell for the ""grass is greener"" syndrome and well, sorry for her.

So you know what? I booked a trip to India for a month. Fuck that I lose cash from my sparings, I will have so much fun. I will have a blast and when I come back she will be a dull memory. A ghost, like the one I just mentioned. This my friends is how it works.

Remember, there is not THE ONE out there. There are literally MILLIONS of THE ONE just waiting for you. Take your time but try not to dwell to long because you will regret loosing your precious time.

Keep your head up guys and girls! <3"
holyredbeard,fds5z0r,t1_fds1owt,"Yes, but we will never do it again. Lesson learned, leveled up."
bestsnowflake,fdsan3f,t1_fdru82o,"I'm sorry to hear that your ex was blaming you for the relationship falling apart. Mine did the same and she still thinks (I believe) that everything happened because of me. My ex was smart enough to make me think I was indeed the culprit for the relationship to fail like it did. She even said I had mental illness and that I should see a therapist and I believed her. She didn't even wait until the appointment to break up with me and she left me when things were not good for me (lost my job and was really anxious). I had to see the therapist (psychiatrist) two months after the break up and I really wanted to improve my life (I was devastated and sad) and he told me I don't have mental health issues (BPD like she thought and believed I had). When I told her that I don't have BPD she just ignored me and it just hurt me a lot. Then, I wrote few messages and she was just cold when she answered and ignored me until my last message before NC. My ex can't even reflect on herself and I hope she will realize how great I was and how much I cared and loved her one day, but I think it will be too late for us to reconcile even if she changed her mind, because I'll be too damaged and hurt to get back with her. I'm forgiving her all she did to me, but the pain and the wounds are real.

I think my ex had also the ""grass is greener"" syndrome since she just followed her sister's advices and broke up with me. Her sister just broke with her ex bf of 5 years and found a new bf really fast. Two weeks later, my ex dumped me like shit on a post-it note and I think she wants to find a rebound and hope that everything will be ""perfect"" with the ""new SO"". I'm starting to wonder if people really love people and what's really love.  I can't even explain mysef why she rejected me if she was loving me the way I did. The problem is that she wasn't loving me like I loved her. She wanted to change me and was trying hard to find excuses to dump me like the ""you have BPD and I can't deal with it anymore"". The psychiatrist just told me I don't have it and this really make me think that she was just fooling herself and ignoring the reality."
LonelyGuy35,fdr2v4d,t3_emu3eb,Nearly 6 months NC. Got dumped in July. Not heard a single word. Been working on myself but do you think too much time has passed or could they yet feel regret? I'm thinking that it's not looking good
idontknowtesy,fdr3ogw,t1_fdr2v4d,"No, it‚Äôs not too much time. I‚Äôve had ex message me 2 years post break up for a meeting. 
But this really does not matter, just keep working on yourself and stay in no contact. 

The point of this is not to get contacted by them but for you to move on. Always put yourself in first priority. Once you‚Äôve learned how to love yourself, you wouldn‚Äôt even care how they feel."
reereejugs,fds1jfo,t1_fdr2v4d,"Why did you wait 6 months? For all you know, your ex gave up after waiting a couple months for you to contact them."
LonelyGuy35,fdr4iuv,t1_fdr3ogw,"Come close to breaking it so many times. Thinking what if she is afraid to reach out after how she ended it. But have to remind myself that it needs to be her as she walked away. 

I'm not going to pretend so honestly I do want her back. She's the only person I have ever truly loved. She is my everything so I do want to hear from her. Not to get a single word from her is devastating. How could I mean so little. Hate to think I am forgotten"
LonelyGuy35,fds6cjc,t1_fds1jfo,"Gave up waiting?? What are you talking about. I begged and pleaded after she ended it. She was cold and just walked away. Why should I reach out to someone who did that. She knows where I am. Reaching out will do no good. If she wanted to talk, she would reach out. I didn't end it."
idontknowtesy,fdr7gut,t1_fdr4iuv,"I can so relate to this, trust me. I myself got dumped early December and I‚Äôm ready to do anything just to talk to her for a little while but from what I‚Äôve learned through out the years is if you contact them, it will just push them further away and you‚Äôll take great amount og step backs. You‚Äôll hurt even more.

We will never know if they regret the break up or not but one thing that we‚Äôre sure about is that they do think of us every single day (Except if you were super bad to her during the relationship).

You‚Äôre only choice right now is to stick to no contact, I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs the most rational move right now for you."
LonelyGuy35,fdr8cg0,t1_fdr7gut,"Push them further away even after 6 months?? 


How can you be so sure about that? That is one thing that I am really doubting. Every single day??? Why would they think of someone they dumped 6 months ago every day especially if they have someone else."
Bruin_NJ,fdrcry6,t1_fdr8cg0,"NC basically is for you to work on yourself and have the dumpers grieve. I think 6 months is a lot and until and unless you guys ended on a terrible note and your relationship was sour, I would say you should reach out if you really want her back. I mean, generally, relationship coaches advice reaching out after 2-3 months but you are already hitting 6 months. So, just reach out casually and keep it short and simple. Don't bring up the topic of coming back. In fact, keep it very light hearted. And don't talk or try to talk for hours. Best way is to tell them of something new that happened to you which they would be interested in learning about. For ex: hey, how's it going? Remember that job I really wanted to get? Well, I got it and it feels great. Just wanted to share with you. Hope you are well.

Something like that. Good luck!"
reereejugs,fds1mzx,t1_fdr8cg0,"Follow your heart, not some bullshit you hear online."
LonelyGuy35,fdrgkwa,t1_fdrcry6,"Most coaches say to do no contact indefinitely. Of course I want her back but she has to be the one to initiate it and that doesn't look likely. At the end of the day, if she wanted to talk to me then she would have said something to me by now. Me reaching out will do no good. I can't stop thinking about her for a second even after all this time. But she has obviously moved on to someone else. Just hate to think I meant so little and I am forgotten. But she walked away so I don't see how me reaching out will do any good. Surely, it has to be dumper to initiate but obviously she is doing perfectly good."
Bruin_NJ,fdrh2q0,t1_fdrgkwa,"Damn bro .. that's brutal. And I ain't any coach, so I would say listen to your coaches. It's been 4 months for me and I was in LDR. I came to her country to visit her and make things better but she didn't meet me at all and told me that she has moved on and is happy. She moved on in a month. The very thought of someone else inside her and touching her body while I am in her city and staying just 1 mile away from her place kills me .. I just crumble! It's brutal man .. I just don't know what to do."
reereejugs,fds1xkl,t1_fdrgkwa,"Most ""coaches"" have no formal training in counseling or psychology and talk out of their asses."
LonelyGuy35,fdri3n8,t1_fdrh2q0,That is very tough indeed. Last year of our relationship was LD too. She was due to move back here in September. But during the last year we still met every few weeks and have been to about 12 places in last year alone. I don't know how she can move on so quickly after 3 years together like I meant nothing. That is hardest part and the possibility that I am totally forgotten. We had discussed marriage and kids and when we were about to move in together. She said I was her everything and she wanted to spend her life with me. How can that change so quickly. I am literally in pieces because I honestly never love anybody like this and I know I won't feel like this again. The thought of never speaking or seeing her again literally kills me. I don't want to give up on person I love but I dont know what I can do. I can't do anything.
mnmlsm10,fdrzpao,t1_fdrh2q0,"Boii let me tell you that my gf broke up with me after 6 years and after a month found a new guy and says she is ""in love with him"" or ""she likes him"" and she lives in a building next to me and every time I go into my car I have to see her window because it is right there so 1 mile is nothing, we live 30-40 meters apart aerial distance üôàüôà"
LonelyGuy35,fds4kcc,t1_fds1xkl,Disagree
Bruin_NJ,fdrio56,t1_fdri3n8,"Sorry to hear that bro. I feel your pain. Exactly same happened to me and I guess it's the distance. Mine actually fell for someone else as I couldn't visit her for a few months. But when she was with me, she said the same things - you are the love of my life, I want us to be together forever, bla bla bla. These are all true in that moment. Things change, people change, situations change and everything changes. I have started accepting it cuz there is nothing else I can do.

Btw, why did you guys break up?"
LonelyGuy35,fds108u,t1_fdrzpao,Would love to just hear from her. 5.5 months and nothing. Heartbreaking.
Eagleassassin3,fdsb8o8,t3_emu3eb,"Is that guaranteed though?

What if my ex is just super happy to have broken up and never regrets it? What if she‚Äôll be happy for me once I move on from her? Couldn‚Äôt that happen as well? I hope not at least, I hope she wants me back eventually.

I don‚Äôt know if dumpees are in a much better position than dumpers. The dumpers have already processed this and kinda moved on in their heads when the breakup happens, whereas the dumpees have to go through letting her/him go. They have to watch their dumper be emotionally distant and even available for someone else while they‚Äôre in pain for the loss they just had.

Not saying dumpers feel absolutely amazing, but they must feel much better."
idontknowtesy,fdsbrih,t1_fdsb8o8,"Nothing is guaranteed. They do feel better at first, much better, especially if the dumpee begged and pleaded. 

If the dumpee did not do anything stupid and just worked on themselves, most of the time the dumper will later think ‚ÄúWhat, why are they not contacting me? Have they moved on already? So fast?‚Äù. That is when they will start missing the dumpees. They will become curious about how the dumpee is doing and curiousity equals attraction.

Again, nothing is guaranteed."
Eagleassassin3,fdsd2kb,t1_fdsbrih,I hope that‚Äôs what happens
OreosAndDreams,fdsciby,t3_emu3eb,"That last point makes so much sense!  It literally hadn't occurred to me before.  I check her social media looking for what exactly?  ""Feeling super miserable without my ex.  I fucked up so bad.  If you're reading this, pleaseeeeee call me.  I've been crying over you for the past month.""  Like seriously, what do I expect her to post?  Whether or not she misses me, she won't post about it: she'd  just call me."
idontknowtesy,fdsd1gv,t1_fdsciby,"Exactly! And if you see some random guy in her story, you will go full stalker mode to find out who that is and the anxiety hits you hard and often it‚Äôs just a friend of hers or... No one!

I myself used to check on my ex‚Äôs social media everyday and if she gets a new follower/friend and if it‚Äôs a guy, I went detective mode which ruined me.

Nothing good comes from checking your ex social media / stalking them. It will just hurt you.

Learn from my mistakes! Do not check their social media."
throwawayroxanne,fdteonh,t1_fdsd1gv,"Bruh this was me the other day. She posted a guy on her story 5 days after the break up and I figured she moved on already and was dating him. Then she posted the same guy 3 weeks later and I was like ""yep! She's definitely moved"" til this day I still don't know if that's just a friend or her new boyfriend but I know for sure that social media stalking does nothing good for you."
donnysaur95,fdtr6h0,t1_fdteonh,"When I was younger I was toxic af and used to have text notifications from Twitter whenever they shared something for like 6 months post-breakup. Given I had some other friends set to the same thing, I remember one day thinking that it made no sense for me to get a text every time they shared something random."
Shorse_rider,fdrm1nq,t3_emu3eb,"I did something that I regret. I wanted to end the relationship for a month. I was stupidly attached and delayed it. Came to the time to end it and instead of ending it myself, I created a conversation and set the conditions for him to pretty much dump me. I gave him the cues and the clues so he would feel like it was him dumping me... 

Unfortunately, despite what I did, and knowing that I wanted to end it.. I have that fucking dumpee mentality. 

When a relationship ends I would add to your (lovely) post, that it's rare that one party was happy/content and the other person was unhappy. There is usually an element of doubt from both sides, you usually know it isn't right and you are not life partners. Remember that. One person might have ended it, but both of you probably  knew it had to end."
Psilociraptor3,fdsijsq,t1_fdrm1nq,"Damn lol... I basically did the same thing. I set it up to fail for months. In fact, the day before she opened the discussion on leaving I was thinking to myself ""I need to have her review this research paper for me today before she dumps me"". And yet I still felt betrayed lol. 

I guess in my case I didn't really want it to end though. I think I felt more betrayed by the fact that someone I had so much love with couldn't work with me on some really basic stuff"
ba1018,fdu5vs2,t1_fdrm1nq,I'm one of the rare ones :(
xXDGPepperXx,fdukh6n,t1_fdrm1nq,"I really appreciate your honesty and insight.  I knew it was over a looooong time before doing anything about it.  I couldn‚Äôt for several reasons, one,  the attention and support, the friendship (which is the only thing I really miss, but like, so many shitty things he did made me realize it was a fake friendship), and I didn‚Äôt want to hurt him.  Now I wish I could hurt him (haha) so it‚Äôs best I play the dumpee too.   After all of this, too, I realize I need someone who is driven, is healthy, and somewhat successful.  All of the things the X was not, or ever will be. C‚Äôest la vie!"

buttercupgymlover,fdr15nt,t3_emu3eb,Thank you so much for this advice ‚ù§üòä
badaboobadabing,fdr5t0n,t3_emu3eb,"In my case she is 22 year old  cute, beautiful , hot with a great ass girl  who gets approached a lot by guys and she also started dating a new guy after a month post BU. So yeah she wont feel bad or sad  but in some cases dumpers do hurt. Not in many though."
Anynon1,fdrmav9,t1_fdr5t0n,"Similar situation to you. Ex is a drop dead 22 year old that makes every single man swoon by just walking by. Getting over that beauty is hard on me but after seeing who she really is, it gets easier. 

Thing is, those types get so much attention from guys and date so often that they never really learn to be alone. When they‚Äôre 40 and less beautiful, unless they fix the attitude they‚Äôll suddenly find themselves in a crisis as opposed to those who learned to be independent early."
tmac2772,fds2joe,t1_fdrmav9,True story. That was me at 22 and now I'm 47 and in a total crisis. Just learning to be alone now!
Anynon1,fds5s2d,t1_fds2joe,"I am so sorry. Surround yourself with friends and hobbies! I‚Äôm 27 and was forced to learn to be alone through breakups. 

I miss the absolute shit out of the good times my ex and I shared but I realize she‚Äôs not the person to share that with. It gets easier. For me personally, it‚Äôs hard to beat spending time with someone you‚Äôre in love with and excited about, but you find ways to make the best of your time. 

For example I‚Äôm completely and utterly single, but I‚Äôm exercising a lot and I‚Äôm having 10+ friends over for some games and drinks after work today. Best thing you can do is pack your schedule even if you don‚Äôt want to. Either with solo or group activities. I find people want to be around me a lot more when my life is crafted for myself alone and nobody else. Eventually someone will want to share it with you."
tmac2772,fdskfmv,t1_fds5s2d,Thanks! I know it's good to have to do this. And I will be a better person for it.
Aromatic_Vegetable,fdrqkb3,t3_emu3eb,"Are we sure this is true? 

I emotionally abused my ex gf, and she said she was happy to not be with me anymore"
Eagleassassin3,fdsdf9a,t1_fdrqkb3,"I think cases like that would probably lead her to not regret moving on from you, sorry. She might eventually wonder how you‚Äôre doing, but she‚Äôll probably think she‚Äôs doing much better without you if you emotionally abused her.

Of course I just think this is what‚Äôs more likely. It doesn‚Äôt mean she won‚Äôt ever come back. But she would have to see change for that to happen"
Aromatic_Vegetable,fdsdsdy,t1_fdsdf9a,"Yes, there are nothing i should say right? Shes even on tinder now 1 month post breakup with a very detailed profile and the phrase ""need a couch date for tonight"".

We have a 4 year old son, a son who loves me and adores me. And it hurts i will only see him every other weekend. I thought that if i just become the best dad possible, and never be negative in my interactions with her, even though i wont have any interactions besides pick up and drop offs, that she might 6 months down or 1 year from now would think About getting a proper family with me ? 

Cause no matter how hard she tries, getting a new man and a new kid will never be the same as what she had with me."
Eagleassassin3,fdsep7r,t1_fdsdsdy,"I had no idea you had a kid together. Well I‚Äôd say that probably changes everything. It‚Äôs not a situation where she can just forget about you completely and move on with her life.

I think it‚Äôs definitely possible that she might want to get back together. But don‚Äôt count on it. You have to be good yourself no matter what happens, even if she gets with someone else. Work on yourself and improve where you lack certain qualities. There‚Äôs always a chance that she dates someone, breaks up and gets back to you. But I don‚Äôt think that can ever happen unless you change for the better. She wouldn‚Äôt want to be back to someone who emotionally would abuse her again.

Some people get married, divorced, get new partners, break up and then get back together again. Anything is possible. But no matter what, you have to be good yourself."
Aromatic_Vegetable,fdsexh8,t1_fdsep7r,"Exactly. Do you think i should just lay back and improve my own mental state and then if she notices it, its fine. 

I would actually like to come to a place emotionally where i dont care about getting her back. But of course deep down i want that family times we used to share. And even though shes cold and angry now, she cant forget the good things. And when my son always talks about how he misses me, that gotta do something"
Eagleassassin3,fdsg1ea,t1_fdsexh8,"Yes. Improve your own mental state no matter what she ends up doing.

I‚Äôm in the same situation as you are in that way. I want my ex back, but I also want to stop wanting her back so I can be happy by myself.

Just try to become fully independent and have your own life. A good relationship is between 2 people who have their own independent lives, who are good separately but better together. So focus on being great by yourself. With time, it will all get better."
Aromatic_Vegetable,fdsg6am,t1_fdsg1ea,"Thanks. Hope youre doing okay yourself. If you dont have a kid involved, youre lucky"
Eagleassassin3,fdsggdt,t1_fdsg6am,"Thanks. I thankfully don‚Äôt, we weren‚Äôt married either. But we were pretty serious and I really wanted to eventually marry her. I really wanted to have a daughter with her that looked like she did as a toddler. Knowing that none of that will happen is very painful to me. Letting go of those dreams is the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever tried doing"
Aromatic_Vegetable,fdsgnx1,t1_fdsggdt,"Its so hard. Theres nothing you wouldnt do to get them back, and they seem so fine after dumping us. At least my ex seems like shes finally having a good life and thats heartbreaking. Even though i know i was the reason for her not being happy. Just wish i had realized it earlier instead of taking her for granted.

How long ago did you break up ?"
Eagleassassin3,fdsirif,t1_fdsgnx1,"We broke up a few months ago. Then she came back and said she still had some feelings for me which gave me up, but after a while she said she‚Äôd rather want us to move on once more. That happened last week and it felt like a second breakup.

We‚Äôre in our early 20s, and we‚Äôre long distance. She just wants to focus on herself and have a life there. She also said she‚Äôd rather end up dating someone where she lives instead of doing long distance which is too complicated for her right now. Maybe that will change eventually, I don‚Äôt know. I hope it does. I‚Äôd still date her if she came back.

But the only thing I can do is stop contacting her and focusing on giving myself a fulfilling life."
TMLlove41,fds5wpn,t3_emu3eb,"Hey guys, just wanted to vent I guess haven't really posted a whole lot on Reddit. I'm coming off of a fresh breakup and I feel awful. We've only been dating 8 months but I still feel like garbage and made a lot of mistakes. I lied to her about really stupid stuff like how much money I had in my savings, and jealousy over a lifelong friend she wanted to reconnect with. I'm not looking for sympathy I just need somewhere to put my thoughts I guess. It was my first relationship and I definitely learned a lot about myself and before I get into another relationship, I need to fix my self esteem and insecurity issues or else I'm going to end up hurting someone else. I'm so happy we ended it off on a good note and we still want to be friends, it's just no contact is going to absolutely suck because I want to keep talking to her so bad, but if I do I know I won't be able to be a good friend later on."
SneakySmeagolses,fdtige2,t1_fds5wpn,"I'm in a similar boat. 5 month relationship, made a plethora of fuckups that ended up resulting in them breaking up with me. They were my first real relationship, and therefore my longest. I also have self-esteem and insecurity issues.

I differ in the respect that we didn't end it on a good note. I ended up losing my temper and sending a hate-filled message, and also kept on trying to talk to them after they broke up with me. I was, and still am, an emotional mess. I also share your concern about whether or not I would be able to be a good friend. I don't want to be another ex added to the pile, because I felt like I really connected with this person. At the same time, I don't think I could handle seeing them with another person.

You aren't alone in this struggle."
TMLlove41,fdtkdmf,t1_fdtige2,"Yeah I get you. Complete no contact seems like the way to go man, just so we can work on ourselves and grow. It's going to suck real bad, but it's impossible to be in a healthy relationship if we don't love ourselves first and figuring out how to is going to take time.

Another thing I learned is that just because you made some mistakes it doesn't mean you're a bad person, just as long as you remain accountable for them and try to improve. Allow yourself to feel and grieve and reach into your support system. Also potato chips, looooots of potato chips lol"
reereejugs,fdrgqt6,t3_emu3eb,"Lol my ex and I are BOTH working on ourselves and not out partying, etc. How do I know? Because we've chosen to remain friends rather than play NC mind games with each other. He's finally admitted he's at least bisexual (I've always known) and is currently trying to (finally) explore his sexuality. I'm cool with that. We may try again later on or we may not. Either way, I still have my best friend :) Didn't handle unexpectedly seeing him in person but shit happens and we're working through my horrible reaction.

Edit: whoever downvoted me for being an adult about this whole situation seriously needs to grow up."
Lovely-Lickspittle,fdrl2pj,t1_fdrgqt6,"Congrats for you two. I can barely stand the thought of that, as it just feels like a demotion. My ex ‚Äî prior to and during when I broke up with them ‚Äî offered repeatedly to continue to be friends and even continue to live together platonically. I couldn‚Äôt do it because I still loved them in the romantic way and needed space. I miss them, but I get creeped out thinking about being their friend. This ex is ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with all of their ex partners, and I don‚Äôt want to feel like another trophy on their shelf. Sometimes I think some couples force the transition into friendship to avoid distress or save face. We will never know each other so intimately again, and that is a loss. Anything less feels cheaper. I hope that makes sense."
petakinethi,fdsnhsr,t1_fdrgqt6,Im in the exact same place right now! My partner is trans (i also always knew) but they need to just be alone without the distractions dating someone entails. I'm pretty sure we wont get back tigether and i'm still a little sad abt it tbh... but its nice to at least have MOST of what we had :)
SneakySmeagolses,fdthjvi,t3_emu3eb,"They don't feel like you've described. Maybe they do, but I'm led to believe that because of what I did to them, that they're happier without me. All the time I spend looking back at how happy we were, how we liked each other so much, how they'd write poems beautifully describing their feelings for me, it all doesn't help.

I'm sorry but it's hard to look at this as an opportunity when I see myself at fault for being broken up with. I failed them."
Veggie_chips,fdthnxy,t3_emu3eb,"I seriously dislike the dumper/dumpee mentality. I‚Äôve been on both ends and sometimes things just don‚Äôt work out like you want them to. Still friends with people I dumped and people who have dumped me. 

I‚Äôd argue that you‚Äôre not a better person than the person who dumped you. As much as it hurts to accept that."
forfearofbadkarma,fdsaij4,t3_emu3eb,"No one will read this but fuck it, typing it anyway.

Things were going badly for a while. I was horribly depressed, and not only did she not know how to help, she blamed me and took the unhappiness in the relationship out on me. She moved out, and despite wanting nothing more than to get away from someone who treated me like shit, I missed her. I gave it two months and was still obsessing over how I could have been better and wanted her back. 

We texted a few times and eventually agreed to meet up as friends. It was fun and light, and I felt like we erased all the bad and were getting back to the way it was. I was thrilled bc it felt like I *fixed* it despite all the odds. I felt like the time apart made her want to care about me again. She had plans to visit her brother out of state for two weeks, so we left it open and would talk about how we felt when she got back.

Two weeks later, her vibe was completely different. She wasn‚Äôt into me nearly as much, didn‚Äôt want me to touch her, and told me she didn‚Äôt want to pursue a relationship and wanted to ‚Äòwork on herself‚Äô. I was devastated. Lost all hope.

I kept myself up, didn‚Äôt eat, drank, behaved recklessly, wondered how I was so dumb for thinking it could work. Beat myself up for a while. A month later I found out she was already seeing someone else. Things got worse.

Eventually, I thought fuck it. Why would I waste my effort on someone who doesn‚Äôt want me back? I‚Äôve started going to the gym again, reaching out to old friends, forcing myself to be better by doing things like public speaking classes and meetup groups, which scared the fuck out of me going alone. I‚Äôm not there completely, but I‚Äôm *actually* working on myself and only going up. 

I‚Äôm a catch, bitch, and fuck you for not seeing that and leaving when I was having a rough time. I don‚Äôt believe it yet, but I think if I type ‚Äúgreat things are coming‚Äù I will start to believe it more.

Thank you for reading if anyone actually made it this far. Typing that all out combined with the exercise bike at the gym was really cathartic for me."
idontknowtesy,fdsb2b6,t1_fdsaij4,"That‚Äôs the spirit! You‚Äôre doing great, keep going to the gym and put yourself in first priority. She has no idea what‚Äôs she‚Äôs missing and you deserve better."
run2throw2away2,elzqce,top_level,"Lol in my healing journey, one of the areas I‚Äôve been trying to improve is my skin, and have been browsing /r/skincareaddiction a lot as distraction (btw it‚Äôs a great sub too if you wanna check them out). Idk why, but comparing my ex to acne is oddly relieving, like I set my mindset to see him as not as something to miss but to be rid of, not as a nostalgic memory but an unpleasant one. 

Some other things I learned 4 months post BU, 2 months NC, and 1 month complete social media NC:

* **Get help, and accept help when offered**: this is my 4th week on antidepressants, and I can say, finally, that I am feeling better. This is in combination with a few talk therapy sessions. And honestly, after the last session with my therapist, I felt like I was only told what I already knew -- resentment is like drinking poison and hoping the other person dies etc etc etc. But I guess I just needed someone else to remind me of it. One big thing I needed to hear was that I should stop, like full stop, expecting the ex to ever regret his decision, or feel sorry for what he did even though I was the one that ‚Äúdid everything right‚Äù and put in a lot of effort to make things work. 
* **Disappointment** has been a key word for me to come closer to acceptance. Maybe because I‚Äôve dealt with disappointment before and know I can get myself through it. Or maybe it puts me in the mindset to recognize that, this ex, just like previous projects that didn‚Äôt work out, is just another fleeting experience/life lesson -- not something that has the power to haunt me forever. 
* **Acceptance** doesn‚Äôt mean I have to forgive him or ""accept and love him for who he is."" For me, acceptance means I accept the fact that he‚Äôs a shitty person, and I cut my losses. But I also tell myself that I don‚Äôt owe it to him to ever talk to him again, and much less a friendship. And it‚Äôs oddly empowering. 

PS: Thanks for all the supportive messages and comments and offers to talk from my last post and I'm sorry I didn‚Äôt reply to you all. I want to say that I can finally see light at the end of the tunnel, albeit dim light, but it‚Äôs light anyway. You can and will get through this <3"

polarchair,fdm87y7,t3_elzqce,"How did you get over hating your ex and wanting him to feel bad? It's been 5 months, but all I feel is hatred that he moved on to someone else and away from me, especially since his new girlfriend used to be a very close friend of mine who was mad at him for breaking up with me."
run2throw2away2,fdmaxfn,t1_fdm87y7,"I'm so sorry this happened to you, sounds super shitty as you lost both a partner and a close friend. 

As to hating him and wanting him to feel bad - I do still hate him. If I didn't I wouldn't be comparing him to acne lol. I do want him to feel bad, I'm just trying to train myself to not *expect* it, hence the key word 'disappointment.' I know it's way easier said than done, as I also tend to ruminate and obsess over the past. My therapist said something about neural pathways getting strengthened as we ruminate, so to break the cycle you have to be strict about saying STOP whenever unhealthy thought patterns emerge. Again, not rocket science, somewhat obvious, and definitely way easier said than done. Which is probably why I needed to hear it again from friends, therapists, this sub etc.

My ultimate goal is indifference, and I know I'm not there yet. But I can see it in the near future now. 

Good luck with your healing journey <3"

So idk. It might be the same situation and it might not. All I'm going to advise u is to ne very careful and cautious. Listen clearly what she says when u meet up,try to read her body language and her choice of words also. And try to be as objective as possible."
brokenheartpieces,fdi566f,t1_fdi3kc7,"Thanks. It‚Äôs an insanely complex situation. Like, I would not be surprised if the mods messaged me and said ‚Äúcongrats! You have the most complicated, tragic and painful breakup in the history of relationships!‚Äù

Bruin_NJ,fdgself,t3_el8bkg,"My ex left cuz of some huge misunderstanding and she put everything on me. Everything became my fault and she said that I broke the relationship when she was the one who broke it and left. And while leaving, she said I have always been a person who only thinks of himself, when I always, always thought of her. I just cannot fathom how her ""I love you a lot"" and ""I am yours forever"" changed to all this hatred in a matter of 20 days!"
Anynon1,fdha7tb,t1_fdgself,"Mine did virtually the exact same. Suddenly everything she was doing was on me. I was blamed for it all. She would absolutely not listen and then began to hate me. It‚Äôs a long story on my end but basically everything you typed is how she did me. Look up borderline personality disorder. Your ex might not have it, but blame shifting, lack of empathy and being unable to take responsibility are very big indicators.

EDIT: grammar"
tomp8588,fdj1pwh,t1_fdgself,Sounds like my ex and I. She actually told me yesterday at 7 am that she wanted to work on things and move back home and then at 2 pm she can‚Äôt because she could never trust me again. This is because I started dating after she left me for another guy that she was sleeping with for months and lying.
Bruin_NJ,fdhaqfg,t1_fdha7tb,"Yeah man, you are right. I think she has BPD. I talked to a psychotherapist about my situation and she even said that my ex might have narcissistic tendencies. And when I look back now, I kind of think she has. She's would lose it the moment you said anything about her or tried to correct her actions because she believed that whatever she did was correct.
Furthermore, when she broke up, she said I need time and space. And we were already in LDR. So, I asked her what that means and she declined to specify the terms of time and space. Just said, I want to be alone and single and find myself and not provide explanations to anyone for what I do. I was like, wtf but still asked her, how much time you need. She said it could be a month or a year but she doesn't know. Damn dude, she was sooo cruel. And then she blocked me everywhere and before blocking told me that she's blocking me because I did everything wrong. Seriously, WTF"
Bruin_NJ,fdjshpr,t1_fdj1pwh,Haha ..she's a lunatic bro! Good riddance. Don't take her back now. Keep moving ahead. Good luck!
Anynon1,fdhdi3h,t1_fdhaqfg,"Shit dude we may as well be the same person lmao. Mine would absolutely explode on me any time I brought up a topic that was uncomfortable, no matter how neutral and sensitive I was about it. She would paint me to be the biggest asshole in her life so disproportionately that I grew scared to talk about anything. 

My therapist says she most definitely had BPD based on her inability to empathize and talk things through. Funny enough after I told her I wished her the best and that I hoped she realized how her actions affect others she blocked me everywhere. I made it a point to tell her I was saying it out of care and love, and kindly reminded her I never once called her names throughout all this. She still called me a selfish asshole, that I was fucked up and proceeded to block me. No winning with these people. 

My therapist said that moving on in this case is hard because we saw how good things were. With BPDs, their affection feels so potent that it becomes addicting, generally because it comes on so strong.  When they devalue and blame you, you panic and try to fight to get that level of affection back. It took me a while to realize that I was fighting to feel that reckless level of love again, not necessarily fighting to get her back.

You‚Äôll get through man. The way she mistreated you will become more and more obvious each day."
Bruin_NJ,fdheimo,t1_fdhdi3h,"Damn dude, exactly, exactly same happened to me. Your story feels like my story. She would just explode at anything I said. Once she told me she might catch cold and then went onto grab some beers, so I told her not to drink beer as it's cold. Rather, she should drink some tea. Dude, she exploded like who are you to tell me what I should drink and what not .. and then she said, even my dad doesn't say these things, so whats up with this parental control. And I said, hey I was just trying to help you so that you don't catch cold and she said, you know what, get lost and didn't talk to me. She made me feel as if it was my fault to take care of her.

Seriously, what's wrong with these people exploding unnecessarily. My friend tried to talk to her a few days back and she told him that I was super selfish and didn't give her space and time (which she never defined what was). She also called me asshole, liar, and other things when I was completely devoted to her. I guess these people cannot digest pure love. They just need someone to treat them horribly. Or not. Don't know man.

But you are correct, it was an addiction because her love was also intense. Intense bouts of love and intense sex (damn, I miss that). So, yeah it was an addiction. But I guess it's a good riddance. She moved on in like 2-3 weeks. Now I keep telling myself that maybe I dodged a bullet."
Anynon1,fdhglh4,t1_fdheimo,"These parallels are becoming scary. Mine would constantly tell me how she deserved better and that I was ‚Äúmistreating‚Äù her. In reality, my mistreatment was me calmly bringing up how she was treating me. She‚Äôd blameshift things on me, dodge the topic and called me an asshole for making her feel bad when I‚Äôm the one who was hurt and yelled at. 

Sad thing is I did my best to be sensitive to her, brought things up in a chill way, and went out of my way to always be there for her. She never reciprocated and would just get angry. I‚Äôm too scared to talk to her friends because I know she painted me to be the asshole. Oh and I forgot to mention the sex is something I miss the most lol, some of the best I‚Äôve had is with her and I‚Äôd be lying if I said that wasn‚Äôt hard to get past. 

She moved on to some other dude in a few weeks and I haven‚Äôt talked to her in about a month or so. It‚Äôs not maybe though, you definitely dodged a bullet. These people operate in literal different ways, there‚Äôs no predicting how they‚Äôll react and you‚Äôll inevitably end up apologizing or being that bad guy for having a concern or being uncomfortable with something they‚Äôre doing. I could go on but seems like our exes operate in similar ways. 

It‚Äôll take time, but eventually we‚Äôll meet healthy individuals. On dates now, I‚Äôm finding myself acting in ways to avoid causing conflict. I find myself in shock when the other person doesn‚Äôt even care about something my previous ex would yell at me for. Good people are out there man. Just focus on you and heal. 

I‚Äôm still in shock at how similar our situations are, but it‚Äôs comforting knowing that this isn‚Äôt unique."
Bruin_NJ,fdhi5p4,t1_fdhglh4,"Yeah man I am also in shock how similar our situations are. And yeah, I have also met a few girls who would just tell me that the things she yelled at me for don't even qualify worth thinking about. And yes, all her friends now think that I am the asshole. Plus, our common male friends have tried their best to portray me in the shittiest manner possible probably because they wanted to bang her or whatever. So, I have broken my ties with these guys who are an absolute disgust. This relationship has taken a toll on me. I am still hurting but recovering while she is happy banging another dude or dudes."
Anynon1,fdho1q3,t1_fdhi5p4,"Break ties with anything related to her. She might be happy now doing whatever she‚Äôs doing but with her attitude, she‚Äôll be lonely in the long run. These types of people sadly can‚Äôt sustain healthy or happy relationships. 

It‚Äôs sad that they are the way they are, but I simply can‚Äôt see things turning out good for them in the long run unless they take the steps in seeing what they do to people.

My relationship also took a toll so I feel you. I‚Äôm in therapy because of it. We might be hurt now but we‚Äôll turn out for the better. We actually have the ability to reflect rather than detach ourselves from what happened. That‚Äôs huge."

This breakup really hurt because I thought I knew him and he was someone I could trust.  We dated for several years and were on the verge of living together/getting married when he abruptly broke up with me for a really stupid reason, one that could have been overcome if he had been committed to me and the relationship.  Obviously he wasn't as committed as he said he was.  I feel like an idiot for ever trusting him.

I don't know how I'll ever trust anyone again."

Going through something similar and it‚Äôs been helpful for me to realize that actions and patterns sometimes matter more than words. Don‚Äôt feel like an idiot for trusting (although I still do too). But we have to learn to trust patterns, not just what they say. I keep replaying in my head every romantic, reassuring thing he said to me, wishing I could go back to that, live in that moment of loving someone so much. But in the end he left again too. I know it‚Äôs going to be hard for me to trust again too. But we have to believe that we‚Äôre better off and more knowledgeable because of this. Stay strong <3"

mayora14,fdjotvm,t3_el8bkg,"I know I probably sound so naive but I want to believe her so badly when she told me I was the ‚Äúlove of her life‚Äù. But now, I really doubt she loves me anymore, at least romantically. I do think even after how everything crashed and burned, I will always love her even if she doesn‚Äôt reciprocate. But we all (everyone in this sub) shouldn‚Äôt hold on but it‚Äôs hard to let go. 

I know cheating is unforgivable and even before I dated, I always thought, ‚Äúnever forgive cheaters‚Äù. I wouldn‚Äôt say I forgive her but I do understand things were not going well between us and she questioned our relationship. It still doesn‚Äôt condone cheating but like I said. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just over-romanticizing our relationship and since she‚Äôs my first but when I dated her, I always thought if things didn‚Äôt work out now, we‚Äôd eventually try again when we‚Äôve both matured. I always thought I met her too early in my life and I wish we took our relationship slower. Ultimately, I need to focus on my career and other life goals. She is finishing up school while working to improve her mental health and find herself. She honestly could be someone completely different from the girl I used to love the next time we meet. 

The silver lining to my breakup is, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have taken my issues seriously if I didn‚Äôt lose her. I need to stop blaming myself but I also need to remember what I did wrong.

screaminjj,fdvrzqw,t3_en15os,"I was just talking to someone about the pathetic realities of being dumped and dealing with heartbreak and depression.

I said something like ""and you're just sitting there, alone, thinking masturbation will help. Give you a little shot of dopamine to get you through the next hour, so you do that. But what happens next is you can't masturbate without thinking of your ex, or, rather, you can but you can't finish. So that's what you do; you think of her and you finish. But right after you start violently sobbing with a puddle of semen on your stomach and in your belly button. As you convulse the semen starts to drip off onto the bare mattress you've been sleeping on because you've been too depressed to even bother washing the sheets you drunkenly shat on the week before let alone change them with the fresh set in the closet."""

deadxsilencexx,emzy1h,top_level,"It happened to me. It sucks. It hurts. Its sad. But remember:

It won't last. They will most likely end up going through a crap ton of terrible relationships. And you? It may take longer for you, but while your ex is constantly in and out if relationships, you will end up with the perfect person. It will be worth all the pain and suffering. Don't give up on love!

And remember, you are a big ass catch. Now go out there like the king or queen you are and have some fun"
throwaway71871,fdsmykn,t3_emzy1h,"My ex got with a girl *immediately* after he left me. That relationship imploded 9 months later, really badly. He then got with someone else (a friend of mine) a few months after that, by all accounts *that* relationship is going the same way. 

In that whole time I have stayed single, worked on myself and grieved my loss. I am now, almost 2 years after the break up, at the beginning of growing closer to a wonderful man. We talk every day and have become great friends over the past 3 months. Something magic is happening with him and I don‚Äôt want to rush it. I don‚Äôt need to, I have nothing to prove and no need to *win* because this isn‚Äôt a contest. I want freedom and honesty in my relationships and I only want to be with someone because I love them. My ex held me emotionally hostage with his withdrawal, zero physical intimacy and closed off behaviour during our relationship, I never want to be in a relationship like that again. My ex has chosen a path I never would have, but it‚Äôs his to choose. He will learn what he needs to learn. I chose mine and I‚Äôm so glad I did."
deadxsilencexx,fdt0xby,t1_fdsmykn,Good! Honestly this is a good story. It's almost a success story. It actually made me feel a bit better too.

deadxsilencexx,fdshr82,t1_fdshjuc,Good things come to those that wait. We all know it can suck and be lonely. Its only been 6 months for me and I'm soo ready to be with someone again. But it will come to all of us. You WILL find the perfect person.
FaithLR19,fdsixgs,t1_fdshr82,I do hope so. I'm not really looking for anyone at the moment so I guess that's good. College has me too busy for a relationship.

deadxsilencexx,fdtavm0,t1_fdtajh1,Good. And he only did that because he hates being alone. I honestly hate being alone too but he was desperate enough to get into a new relationship. It will probably go down in flames. Your life will become amazing and full of joy.
askmeifilikeanal,fdufbx0,t1_fdtajh1,I don‚Äôt get people like him AT ALL!! why did he break up with you just to tell you he loves you? Does he want you back? Grass is always greener where you water it

CreamyEagleShit,fdwx0lz,t1_fdum6f2,"This is how I feel. But I‚Äôve been forcing myself to be around friends who understand the situation and what I‚Äôm going through and that is enough for now. For true growth, you need to take the time for yourself to heal. But make sure it‚Äôs not taking over your life for too long. After a while, if the feeling persists, I would recommend therapy if you can afford it. It sucks to be in the situation where you‚Äôve been dropped like hot garbage, and anything remotely similar to them can make your anxiety go crazy. But it‚Äôs important to let those things happen so those triggers can go back to being normal everyday things instead of reminders of a person who chose to stop trying."

deadxsilencexx,fdshlav,t1_fdshg07,Good. And remember that you aren't worse then their new so. Someone will be lucky to have you one day.
seadiddy0305,fdtl6vb,t3_emzy1h,I got dumped about 3 months ago. 28/m and my gf 28/f with a 5y/old child who I absolutely adored just up and left for her job owner (~44yr/old)  who just happened to recently divorce his wife. I needed to read this. I keep thinking I'm okay but I'd never been with someone who had a child and that child became mine and it kills me not being apart of her life. Reading these make me feel just a little bit better.
deadxsilencexx,fdtltj3,t1_fdtl6vb,"Shes probably after his money. But you will find a new girl one day, and have your own kid. But until then focus on making life as good as possible until the pain goes."
seadiddy0305,fdtmh7j,t1_fdtltj3,That's my thoughts exactly or he decided she's younger then his ex wife and looking to fullfil a spot . Hurts most because of her child I can deal with heartbreak any day but the kids the hardest. I've kept up with going to a gym everyday for the past few months but some days I just break down. I know it will get better but hard to control some days . Thank you for the response
deadxsilencexx,fdtmux3,t1_fdtmh7j,Maybe find another child to see? That sounds wrong but if you have any children in your family maybe you could babysit to help fill that void a bit?
seadiddy0305,fdtn5ru,t1_fdtmux3,I've got younger sisters I spend every weekend with but we've had an agreement where I actually spend Sundays with her child. And I can't figure out if that's helping or hurting the situation. I think mentally in the long run it may hurt her child but it's hard for me to break the bond
deadxsilencexx,fdtnhqb,t1_fdtn5ru,"It probably won't hurt the child. If they are bonded with you, you leaving could hurt them pretty bad. Any kind of parent figure leaving can lead to pretty bad separation anxiety. Unless theres a different reason why you think it would hurt them?"
seadiddy0305,fdtnwvu,t1_fdtnhqb,I've never thought of it in that way. Slight background I'm the 4th man in this child's life (she's 6yr/o) so I worry more about him being 5  and her still visiting me. We have a great connection and attachment. I love spending time with her as does she. Constantly asking her mom to see me and spend time with me which is where the Sunday play date came about. Just figured multiple male figures in her life constantly would mess her up long term which I didn't want for such a great kid
deadxsilencexx,fdto8vd,t1_fdtnwvu,Oh. I'm mainly speaking from experience. That didn't happen to me but my dad was always gone for work and I developed severe abandonment issues. The other men in her life may end up leaving. It could be better for you to stay in that case as she will have a male figure that doesn't leave or hurt her. But idk.
seadiddy0305,fdtoppv,t1_fdto8vd,Okay no I agree. I'm in the same boat my father was never around so I just didn't want her having her moms ex in her life while Mom keeps bringing around another guy time after time. But that was my first thought. I'd much rather be that safety net and guy she can rely on whose always there regardless of moms new boyfriend's. You've given me some good insight. So thank you
deadxsilencexx,fdtp9me,t1_fdtoppv,You're welcome. Happy to help.
Quietbutburning,fdujo2d,t3_emzy1h,"My ex started tweeting about having a crush on someone two weeks after the break up. That hurt like hell too. I was that important to you, huh?"
MistelOctober,fdxyfp5,t1_fdujo2d,"Oof. My ex started tweeting at his high school crush on twitter almost immediately after and not even 3 weeks after the breakup he drove 14 hours to see her for New Year's. Like, I guess I see now where I always stood with you"
sxnflxwerr,fdvng14,t1_fdujo2d,yikes similar thing happened to me where my ex made a really sappy playlist for someone else two weeks post break up.. really made me question what he thought our relationship was
deadxsilencexx,fdwavxn,t1_fdujo2d,Block her twitter. You deserve better than that
CreamyEagleShit,fdwyexx,t1_fdujo2d,Same thing that happened to me as well. Hurts like a bitch but definitely puts in to perspective what place you had in their heart. Or lack of one.

Quietbutburning,fdx9k41,t1_fdvng14,"Oh yes. My ex really liked making sappy playlists, too so I wouldn't even be surprised if she made one for that ""crush"" by now. But I wouldn't know because I blocked her üòãü•≥.

Take care! You deserve better."
Quietbutburning,fdwwr3w,t1_fdwavxn,"Did that a few months ago üòä She got angry at me for it and we don't talk to each other anymore, but I feel a lot better now üëçüèª"

Starmoon85,fdv5ify,t3_emzy1h,"My ex who I‚Äôd been with for 3 years was on pof two week she after we broke up. She was talking to the guy she‚Äôs is now happily in a relationship with. They‚Äôve been together for 3 month since now and are moving fast. They‚Äôve met each other‚Äôs family and friends etc and have been on weekend breaks. At first I thought it was a rebound but now I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs  the real deal. It sucks as I‚Äôm the ex she got over quickest (by far), and I‚Äôm the only one she‚Äôs has blocked. She always said I was her soulmate and love of her life, now I‚Äôm dead to her and have been for 3 months üòû

Also can anyone shed any light on why her new guy has blocked me too if we‚Äôve never spoke or met before?"
deadxsilencexx,fdw9qjy,t1_fdv5ify,They probably blocked you to ensure she doesn't attempt to get back with you. But don't worry about if she talks to you or not or if she doesn't care about you. Many others love and care about you. It will get better.
Starmoon85,fdxzh8t,t1_fdw9qjy,I just wish she‚Äôd could be in my life as a friend. It annoys me that someone I‚Äôve never even spoke to has blocked me as I feel I‚Äôm some sort of horrible person. Thank you for the support
deadxsilencexx,fdy36lq,t1_fdxzh8t,I wouldn't feel that way. You aren't bad. He probably did because she told him to
Starmoon85,fdzibuy,t1_fdy36lq,Why would she tell him too though? I just find it all a bit bizarre
deadxsilencexx,fdzijvl,t1_fdzibuy,Maybe she doesn't want you saying something bad about her. He might've even told her to.
Starmoon85,fdzliwh,t1_fdzijvl,I wouldn‚Äôt have messaged her new guy. I‚Äôm not that pathetic. I just worry she‚Äôs told him lies about me and made me out to be a terrible person that needs eradicated from their life
deadxsilencexx,fdzm6r3,t1_fdzliwh,Who cares? He shouldn't matter in your life. You need to start taking steps for yourself. They don't push you for the better. You need to cut out the toxicity.
Starmoon85,fdzns8r,t1_fdzm6r3,I do care though. I was good to my ex in so many ways and I would just hate to think she was bad mouthing me to her new guy or friends
deadxsilencexx,fdzoqe3,t1_fdzns8r,Well you can't control that
Eagleassassin3,fdvat8u,t3_emzy1h,"Yeah but I thought (and still kinda think) that my ex was that perfect person for me.

I don‚Äôt buy it when people say ¬´¬†you‚Äôll find someone who truly loves you and appreciates you for who you are¬†¬ª but my ex did feel that way once too. So it doesn‚Äôt guarantee anything.

We also can‚Äôt know how the ex will feel. They might have a few rebound relationships but eventually be happy with themselves and then find someone even better for them."
deadxsilencexx,fdw98it,t1_fdvat8u,"A lot of the time when our exs get into a lot if rebounds the time it takes for them to heal is way longer. And they might be the right person for you. My main target with saying people will find someone better as that's what helps me the most as I absolutely frickin hate being single and I dream of finding new love everyday. But if they are right for you, sometime in the future you guys will meet again. If not, you will find someone else."
Eagleassassin3,fdwidac,t1_fdw98it,"Thank you. I just want her back right now. I hope we do end up together again eventually, even if we have other relationships in the meantime. But if not, like you said, I hope I can be even happier with someone else. It‚Äôs just hard to imagine that being possible right now. And I hope things get better for you as well"
deadxsilencexx,fdwizyo,t1_fdwidac,Of course its basically impossible to imagine. As time goes on it will be easier to see the actual relationship and how it was and who knows. You may feel the same in a while from now or you may completely change your mind.
SpinningBandicoot,fdsjvcy,t3_emzy1h,"I definitely needed this! 

I was there from the beginning trying to help my ex deal with her problems and trying to get someone to help her with her depression. 
 I stood by her side when she finally told me about being trans and i didn't let that interfere with the feelings I had for her . 

Then she ends it with saying ""would you break up with me if i said i needed to work on myself?"" I said yes if thats what you need. 

Then 3-4 days she jumps into a rebound.

Her giving up on us so easily on top of the breakup felt like a sword to my chest..

Then her lying about working on herself and jumping into a rebound was another sword right after the first. 

Then her removing me off all socials we shared together felt like a shotgun blast to my heart...

At first I wished for her the worst fate and karma known to mankind... But I soon realized i don't need to do that because she's already living it everyday.

She's (20) I'm (25) ignores and neglects her depression , hasn't had her first job yet, has no goals or skills in life to help her move forward, no car, no license, and just plays vg's to ignore all of these while i was there for her - i tried to motivate her to face these issues head on together as a couple, but I got hurt from it. 

I loved her at one point, but like I said I don't have to wish ill will on her because she'll be dealing with her problems and bad choices for at least 5 years. 

Arrivederci Abigail!"
deadxsilencexx,fdt18vl,t1_fdsjvcy,And you will most likely end up with an amazing person.
SpinningBandicoot,fdt3832,t1_fdt18vl,"I hope so, some days I think it'll happen but most days as of right now im trying to forgive myself for getting hurt... And stop hanging on to her. 
Im literally at the last thread of letting go. 

Last night i had a dream where i walked inside this house it didn't look like mine but my ex was in this room upstairs and i told her how she broke my heart, how she lied to me, and how disappointed i was in her giving up so quickly as well as jumping into a relationship 4 days after we broke up. 

She looked stunned and puzzeled, then i grabbed all of her shit and threw it out the window and told her to get out. 

I woke up today like woah!"
deadxsilencexx,fdt3k0h,t1_fdt3832,Ive been hurt too. But just know it won't change the fact that there are probably at least a few thousand singles within a 10 mile radius of you that would be very good for you. It might take its time but it will come. It hurts being alone. I'm struggling right now. But its just the road to a good thing in life.
SpinningBandicoot,fdt5wik,t1_fdt3k0h,"Thank you for that thought but i honestly don't even care or want to date anyone. 

That's how damaged I feel , my hearts walls shot up like 10 fold and I just wanna work on props from video games and land this new job. 
I've worked out for over a year now and I lvevtried to keep busy after the breakup. 

Im happy with living alone to be honest"
deadxsilencexx,fdt70ht,t1_fdt5wik,Thats good. I'm super happy you are alone. A lot of the times I say things that kinda apply to people who hate being single because I do but as long as you are happy with your life you've still ended up with better than what they have.
dota2botmaster,fdtfhvb,t3_emzy1h,"With these post and the comments, this all hit close to home. We broke up last October because she already have somebody else weeks before the breakup. First weeks I'm begging for her to choose me abd stay. Then fast forward to now, tables have turned. I go NC with her once in a while only to break it with her messages like she still loves me and misses me. Also said she will stay by me ""forever"" I dunno why tho because she's still together with her new one although I can tell it's not good. Lastly she always says that she won't be back and possibly won't reconcile with me anymore which I couldn't care less. Just mind-boggling that she'll cheat on me only to be told months later she won't leave me and ""love me 'til death"". I just hope she'll get better because she clearly has signs of depression for what she did to me and with all the substamce abuse and self-harm that's been going on with her."
deadxsilencexx,fdtjr9g,t1_fdtfhvb,She probably has some issues with needing constant attention. It could be part of her depression if she has it. I feel the need for constant attention and love and affection too because I'm depressed but if she doesn't figure out that it won't actually help she will be this way for a long time. And remember you are worth a girl who wants you and only you.
dota2botmaster,fdtldc9,t1_fdtjr9g,"Thank you for this. It gave sense. I'm currently trying to help her and this helps with my moving on. I'm throwing my love and affection outside the window as I'm trying to help her. However, if I feel like my feelings and memories of us is going to take over I immediately go radio silence as I don't want the constant communication to be counter-productive in trying to fight her depression.

Compared to the ex I've recently split with, I've never felt even 1% of the strength of this connection. Never had a relationship that was anywhere near this healthy and easy. Never met anyone I actually wanted to have children with. Never even had a friend that I wanted to spend 12-straight hours with, let alone 12-straight days.

Fr4t,fdjfao1,t1_fdj6lfb,"I'm 30 and while quantity obviously means shit, I may hit the two digits if I count every kiss I had, ha."
brokenheartpieces,fdkiclw,t1_fdjfao1,"Have you tried tinder/hinge? I‚Äôm extremely selective, only swipe right on maybe 1/10, and I never have an evening alone unless I want to. I‚Äôm not even particularly attractive, but charm goes a long fucking way when you‚Äôre competing in a sea of toxic dude bros.  I‚Äôm still healing from heartbreak, so I‚Äôm deliberately avoiding commitment/love because I know I‚Äôm an addict in withdrawal/recovery, but it‚Äôs awfully nice to have 7 or 8 people to regularly share affection and intimacy with.

For making sure that a first date ends in sex, assuming that a) there‚Äôs chemistry b) you‚Äôre both comfortable/interested and c) you don‚Äôt deliberately want to draw out the anticipation, there‚Äôs really just two key rules to follow: 1) Understand what they want, and what‚Äôs stopping them from letting themself have what they want. 2) You‚Äôre not seducing them. They‚Äôre seducing you. The night *may* end in physical intimacy, but only if they‚Äôre very skilled at seducing both my mind and my body, and also happen to be lucky. 

I have a couple of things that have really helped in making most first dates unforgettably successful:

My crazy-cheap apartment kinda has an amazing layout: it‚Äôs the front, ground level suite of a beautiful old character home, which is already a great start, but then after the sunroom it opens into the bedroom.

‚ÄúOh yeah, sorry, I know this is a weird layout ‚Äî we have to walk through the bedroom to get to the salon‚Äù.

It‚Äôs legitimately ridiculous how effective it is, for making a woman immediately comfortable. Instantly, the fear and apprehension around sleeping together on the first date is abated. ‚ÄúWow, his bedroom is, like, normal. No whips or chains. It‚Äôs very clean. Nice artwork. I could be very comfortable on the ride to pound town in a bedroom like this‚Äù. Priority number one of any date you‚Äôre ever on should be: make sure they‚Äôre 100% comfortable, 100% of the time. Absolutely nothing you might want, is worth them losing even 1% of comfort. That attitude takes you far.

Other things that really help, in my experience, are having a great book collection, a nicely stocked bar, and being able to craft a perfect cocktail for any liquor. This has come to extend for cannabis, too. Making your home an extension of your personality is really the key there.

This got super long, ha ha. Here‚Äôs the rub, though. And the wisdom. One key thing I‚Äôve learned, about love and intimacy: it never rains but it pours. When I have 0-1 lover, it‚Äôs a struggle to attract others. Rejection after rejection after rejection. When I have 3+, I find myself beating women away with a stick (politely reciprocating, then gently declining their flirtations). It‚Äôs an absurdly powerful difference. Like, again, I‚Äôm not a particularly attractive dude. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 with a dad bod. But nowadays when I go out, I attract whoever I want to, and get approached all the time. Having many partners makes it easy, because there‚Äôs no failure. If I want some intimacy and strike out at the bar, I just text one of my regular lovers. Nothing is more attractive than abundance. But you don‚Äôt need to have abundance, to think and act like you do. Fake it til you make it.

Fun fact. If any of this sounds enviable? I‚Äôd trade all of it for a 5 minute conversation with my ex. I may have a lot of fun distraction in my life, but the vast majority of it is pain and sadness."
Fr4t,fdkrv88,t1_fdkiclw,"Thanks for the long response. You know, it's kinda weird with me I must say. I try not to make it look like self-pity. But I'm a pretty tall dude (1,90m) and am on the more attractive side of genes (not stunning but good looking - many girls confirmed that). 

I was together with my gf for 6+ years when she left me in September. I've been an emotional wreck ever since. Tried to move on, keeping things going. Hitting the gym, even dating, etc.

Had two tinder dates since then. First one went well and we went to her place to do the deed, but she got so nervous that we had to abort (she then told me that she's one month out of an abusive relationship and didn't know it would affect her like this). So of course I told her not to worry about it. We joked a bit afterwards and I made my way home, writing her a message that she doesn't need to worry about a thing because shit happens and that it was a nice evening. But also that she needs to sort her feelings and that it's not something I want to be a part of, since I don't actively seek a relationship after my last one fell apart.

So, without self-pity and self-praise, I'm a well-spoken and empathic guy who's not overweight or anything with some mild social anxiety. But somehow there's no line at my door, haha. I use Tinder and Bumble, both not doing much. Texting with a woman on bumble rn but she doesn't initiate much and I don't like to run after women too much since I'm as much a prize than anyone else.

I'm pretty desperate for physical closeness because it's been more than 6 months (ex-gf had a low libido...) and the pressure of not radiating a needy aura is also damn high...

Well, a bit self-pity in the end: Whatever I do it seems to be a tad-bit wrong. Thanks for reading."
brokenheartpieces,fdln5wn,t1_fdkrv88,"Mine flew the coop in September too. If you wanna feel less self-pity... try reading my post history. Hope is what really fucking kills you.

Sounds like you‚Äôve already diagnosed your own problem! And the solution is very achievable. Gotta get rid of that needy aura altogether.

Sadly, neediness destroys everything else a person might have going for them. You‚Äôll eventually come to know this from the other side ‚Äî when a someone approaches me, doesn‚Äôt matter how awesome or attractive they comes off. If they seem to ‚Äúneed‚Äù me? My attraction just evaporates. 

So you‚Äôve got to do something about that.

Are you straight? I‚Äôd advise you to keep it up with tinder, maybe lower your standards a little bit just for the short term, and start practicing meditation to help you let go of your need. Pamper yourself in the masturbation department. Buy a fancy male masturbator and some nice lube. Look into prostate toys. Be more thoughtful about porn, and take the time to find the perfect videos. Or, use your imagination like a creative canvas, and paint an incredible tapestry of exotic thrills to enjoy. Spend a full hour at a time teasing and treating yourself how you deserve to be treated, and develop a fulfilling habit of self-intimacy. Your whole goal should be to let go of need. Do that, and you‚Äôre money, baby.

When it comes to tinder messaging yourself, spend a lot of time reviewing your messages before you send them. Ask yourself: ‚Äúdoes this risk turning her off, and getting unmatched?‚Äù If the answer is now, rewrite it. You should be taking that risk with every message. And set up dates within 5 or 6 messages. Playing it safe gets a lot of responses, and few dates. You have to start their engines revving from the first interaction, if you want to establish a fulfilling, intimate connection.

And drop bumble, that shit is the worst. Hinge is pretty good though."
Fr4t,fdmoxup,t1_fdln5wn,"Thanks for the additional advice. Luckily I'm already doing most of those things. I guess I'm just a little impatient. The thing is, in Germany almost nobody uses Hinge so there ain't much happening. So Tinder and Bumble (maybe OKC but I haven't tried it) are the only viable only dating sources. But hey, in the end I like going out and meeting random people in person the most."
brokenheartpieces,fdojx0v,t1_fdmoxup,"One other question: do you masturbate before dates?
Or on the days you have them?"
ratzerman,fdhly2s,t3_eld3w2,"Right there with you. Years after having my wife leave me for another man, I really reeeeally thought I had found the one. Nobody ever made me feel the way she did. She was the missing piece of myself that made me whole. We connected on a level neither of us ever did with anyone else. Three years later, in an instant, I was out and another man was in. It's been eight months, and I'm still just as shattered as that first day. This feels different than my wife asking for a divorce because she met someone else. I feel broken. Not just heartbroken. Broken broken."
peteolivetree,fdgzime,t3_eld3w2,I feel that exactly. And I'm afraid for the future. Because I don't hmgice myself easily so... And I have dreams that the years tend not to be a friend to.
kanishkveer,fdh5yw1,t3_eld3w2,I gave all of my affection and care to someone I trusted and loved so much and to start over w someone else is just sad because I have no more love to provide anyone now.
Starmoon85,fdhl8fy,t3_eld3w2,Totally this. I was 31 when we met and I‚Äôd never experienced that kind of connection before. She completely ‚Äúgot‚Äù me. She was also the best friend I‚Äôve ever had. 3 years we had together and it wasn‚Äôt perfect but we truly did love one another on such a deep connection. We were so wild and enjoyed sex in public places. I know I‚Äôll never experience that kind of connection again and it kills me. It kills me even more to know she replaced me within a few weeks. I‚Äôm the quickest ex she‚Äôs ever got over despite her saying she‚Äôd be single for life if we split and that I was the love of her life. I‚Äôm also the only ex she‚Äôs got blocked. I totally understand how you feel
Psilociraptor3,fdh8poo,t3_eld3w2,I feel that exactly. Despite our obvious problems my wife and I had so much connection I'm worried I'll never find again. Always thought she was the one. Hence why I stayed in it even after the relationship itself was unhealthy and unhappy. Kept waiting for it to heal so we could be the couple I knew we were capable of. Hurts fucking bad that she just tossed it out when there were tangible solutions to our issues.
flowing_sun,fdhr0mv,t3_eld3w2,"I completely feel the same. After 2 failed long term relationships, I finally understood what true love felt like when dating my ex. It seemed like we connected on all levels. Her dumping me was the worst heart break I have ever felt. I‚Äôm really worried that I‚Äôll never be able to get this same connection again"
cestlavie2728,fdi0pdf,t3_eld3w2,"Same. We are all in the same boat, it seems. At least we're not alone."
Flybirdieee,fdi5mvb,t3_eld3w2,"I feel this. I was 25 when we met, he was 29. He said he couldn‚Äôt believe he‚Äôd lived 29 years without me, without knowing he could feel that way. 2 years, hundreds of promises, sharing everything, sharing a home, and building a life together, and he left. Out of the blue on a Monday morning. I don‚Äôt know how I could ever love anyone like I loved him. It‚Äôs been 5 months and I‚Äôm still so broken. Even if I did fall in love, how could I ever trust again? I feel so damaged."
SpiderrG,fdhntl3,t3_eld3w2,Same same same same same same same same same.
streamingdreams,fdhq8og,t3_eld3w2,I feel this.
gypsysunflowers,fdhrm2d,t3_eld3w2,This is exactly how I'm feeling. He left me yesterday. I'm in anguish over it. I hope we can find relief.
lindseyisbusy,fdhwof0,t3_eld3w2,"I thought this too. I literally thought he was my soulmate and I was convinced I would never connect with anyone again. But I‚Äôve recently started casually seeing someone else and it started out as friends but we connected on a level I could never connect with my ex on, and I didn‚Äôt even know that level existed but now I know that I was seeing my connection with my ex through rose colored glasses."
lookinlikethis,fdhxee7,t3_eld3w2,I'm feeling the exact same about my breakup. Getting to know people and trying to form a connection all over again is slightly terrifying for me!
JDNWACO,fdhyh5s,t3_eld3w2,Exactly... my break up was 5 years ago.  And I liked a girl for the past cpl years. And I wish I could get attached but just can‚Äôt. There‚Äôs literally nothing wrong with her. But I just can‚Äôt connect.
WanderingLostSoul22,fdi40u5,t3_eld3w2,"I‚Äôm terrified of this... It‚Äôs been six months now and even the thought of getting close to another, physically and emotionally, sickens me. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so damn hard for me to move on when it only took him three weeks to get himself into a new relationship. I feel empty, like I‚Äôve lost a part of myself I‚Äôll never regain."
stano1213,fdi6jz4,t3_eld3w2,"I feel this exactly. Even though I know now there were issues we ultimately couldn‚Äôt overcome, that connection is what I miss and think about every day."
Pwnkillayo,fdiaag5,t3_eld3w2,"I have the exact same feeling, took me 20 years to meet someone i really loved, i dont wanna wait 20 more years to find someone new! If only I could turn back time, and show her more support."
LisLis85,fdj3qw2,t3_eld3w2,"I dunno what‚Äôs worse; I didn‚Äôt feel that electric connection initially but I persevered with him because he was a decent guy who deserved a chance (so I thought). This only allowed me to skip silly stage and start developing something deeper and more emotional right away. 5 years later he leaves me for someone else. Last time I ever give someone a chance if the connection isn‚Äôt there right away cos fuck you, I don‚Äôt have to and why should I?"
any0must,fdkc4uk,t3_eld3w2,I‚Äôm currently in the same boat. I‚Äôve been on tinder and I really can‚Äôt stop comparing them to him. I cared a lot for him and the message he sent me broke my heart. But I know he has issues to get through and I know he wasn‚Äôt the right person. It still hurt all the same.
ApricotDynamic,en2s7p,top_level,"I got nothing from it! N O T H I N G.

I know it.

DONT BREAK NO CONTACT YOU WILL REGRET IT."
My_Banana_is_Juicy,fdupg7q,t3_en2s7p,"Actually my experience of breaking no contact was different. I didnt do it, but she did. I talked to her as normal snd didnt question it. Few days later she ranted at me for stupid shit and i realized she still doesent respect me as a human being even 4 months after she broke up. Ive been sad and crying my ass off over her for 4 months
 And when I finally start to feel a bit better she comes back to shit on me once again. I had enough. I gave her a piece of my mind and then blocked her. It's relieving. Its nice to know there's nothing to cry over, but im sad to realize that I was so wrong about the girl I thought i loved. And even more so for being so late at realizing that."
JamesPequod,fduu0yt,t1_fdupg7q,"Same. Sadly I have to stay in contact until we finally settled everything, but she'll use every opportunity to keep shitting on me, it's just childish."

littlepawroars,fduo0r9,t3_en2s7p,"I saw my ex briefly while I went to pick up my belongings from our old place (I left bc eff this POS abuser and cheating a-hole) and said nothing to him. I didn‚Äôt even bother to look at his face. I am genuinely disgusted with him. 

He tried to engage in conversation today while I packed and I completely rejected him and his request for info about me. Ignoring him with zero response felt AMAZING! 

He doesn‚Äôt get to use me anymore to feel better about himself! Best of all, I took one last look at our old place and felt genuinely happy to be gone! Yay!"
throwthrowthrow1119,fdu73de,t3_en2s7p,"I saw her earlier today, usually today is a day where we spend time together to relax after working. I was so distressed today and I want to call her so bad, so I went on this thread and lo‚Äô and behold this is the first thing I see. I hope it gets better as I continue to keep no contact."
RedRiki24,fdzss72,t1_fdu73de,"Dude me too! I was really here on trying to stop it, and yes, just what I need for someone to tell me not to do it"
flowing_sun,fduuy6w,t3_en2s7p,"It‚Äôs almost like an addiction! You want to message the person so badly that you loved or maybe still love. You have the slight hope in you that you could go back to normal again. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúno‚Äù you‚Äôve got to make once but a decision you have to take almost every waking hour, especially in times when you‚Äôre alone or used to spend time with them."
ThrowRA09636282,fdu0u8h,t3_en2s7p,Was up thinking about it. Thanks for underscoring this. For the rest of us.
Olives_And_Cheese,fdvuaml,t3_en2s7p,I want to wish my ex a Merry Christmas and a happy new year. Obviously you can tell how long I've been resisting the urge given the date. My brain keeps whispering to me that it's just a season's greeting! it wouldn't even matter if he didn't reply! ...It would. I'm sure it would. Eventually I'm hoping I won't want to send anything anymore.
EveryAnything88,fdwa52n,t3_en2s7p,"I heard on a podcast this perspective that really helped me - it's not worth it to have the same conversation over and over and over. And when you reach out and break NC and try to encourage anything friendly or nice or try to get closure, or whatever- it always reduces into the same conversation. Don't break NC, it never results in what you want it to. Just more of the same."
ert015,fdu605k,t3_en2s7p,I just saved this - thanks for your sharing your truth
reereejugs,fdwr2xr,t3_en2s7p,I don't do NC and have absolutely no regrets about it. Got my closure and kept my best friend that way.
bestsnowflake,fduy42d,t3_en2s7p,Thank you for the reminder. I already broke NC twice before restarting at square one three weeks ago.
yogawithvivian,fdvor1y,t3_en2s7p,"I had to break NC for necessary logistics, tying up a loose end...and it was so unnerving. We can start fresh OP"
heart_brain_journey,fdvy20p,t3_en2s7p,"Agree. 

 I broke it by either responding or initiating.

And the result? Well, you know the paintings of Jeroen Bosch where souls are tortured in Hell? Feels like that."
wood_elf3,fdym4kn,t3_en2s7p,I broke no contact after a month. Well technically I unblocked him from ig and guess what. It only took a second for him to see and he instantly  messaged me. Like he was just staring at the screen waiting for me. I replied and said that was fast and he said he checks all day every day. That made me feel good. He told me he thinks of me every second of the day. That made me feel good to. Fast forward to a couple hours later and all my questions about why or how he could hurt me so bad came flooding out. We didn‚Äôt have any closure the way it ended. It turned into me balling my eyes out on and off all night. To me calling him askin why. The next morning he‚Äôs even more mean and ended up blocking me out of nowhere. I felt back at square one with no questions answered. I came home from work and had a nervous breakdown today. Like lost my shit. I‚Äôm relaxing with my cat now but it‚Äôs safe to say I blocked him again and am sitting here in complete fucking regret. Don‚Äôt unblock them. It only made me emotionally worse off.
ApricotDynamic,fe33vik,t1_fdym4kn,"First off, sorry that happened to you. It‚Äôs insane how much you want to reach out but logically you know you shouldn‚Äôt. Everyone makes blunders and everyone stumbles sometimes. Pick yourself up and learn from this experience, acknowledge that this is a pattern and nothing will change no matter what he says because he‚Äôs saying it for that temporary happiness that you guys can get and will eventually fall back into a vicious cycle that gets worse at every turn. 


Sometimes there is no closure, and the closure is what you make it and you are even in control of it. There is no ‚Äòwhy‚Äô anymore, just focus on the ‚Äòwhat‚Äô you‚Äôre going to do from now on. Keep taking steps even if you stumble. 

Stay strong and 2020 IS OUR  YEAR, okay?"
wood_elf3,fe4d7xe,t1_fe33vik,You‚Äôre right. Thanks kind stranger I needed this reminder.
JamesPequod,fdutjyi,t3_en2s7p,"Same. I broke NC yesterday after a month and I regret it, but I had to, because of our apartment. I stayed only on topic about the apartment, but she just had to get straight back into repeating her same old shit.."

adriftonly,fdus376,t3_en4p7g,"I can't say ""ex"" either, it feels so reducer of the person he was and he is to me and in my life... I really don't like it. I prefer using his name instead because he is a lot more than an ""ex boyfriend"", he's still the person I love..."

I feel like ex has connotations that something really explosive happened. It's painful for me to think of the guy as an ex because it makes him sound so disposable. I care for him, miss him and 'ex' is so finite (despite me not wanting us to be in a relationship)"

aliana1988,fdw3aue,t3_en4p7g,Sometimes I just say ‚Äúboyfriend at the time‚Äù because ex just sounds so harsh and painful

You‚Äôre just sad, you miss them, you want to go back for just 5 minutes to look into their eyes one last time. I feel like I‚Äôm contradicting myself but this is a different feeling. This sadness isn‚Äôt heartbreak anymore. My shattered heart has been picked up in a dust pan off the ground. But it‚Äôs just sitting there, not doing anything, just in pieces but still kinda collected all together . I‚Äôm not exactly sure what to label it, if it even needs a label at all. One thing I know for sure is that if feels really weird."
yonghuilum,fe28wag,t3_enla1g,"I got broken up exactly a year ago right before my birthday. And the past year had been one of the most challenging years of my life, without sounding dramatic. In the beginning I could hardly push through work, I was not motivated to learn and improve myself in life - it felt like I was regressing and I didn't care about it. I used to love my ex so much, and I genuinely thought that everything we had was a blessing. I loved her so much that I would go the extra mile just because I wanted to build a life for us together. All those waking up at 1-2am to drive her to work, to cooking dinner for her after her work, to simply silly things like wanting to hold her hand as I drive. The heartbreak was almost too much when she told me that she wanted to start anew. 

But the whole of last year, as tough as it had been, was one of the biggest years of my life as well, as it turned out. I got hand picked in my company to lead a project, and I worked my ass off. Work has been the only thing that pushed me on, as pathetic as it sounds. And it is still the same for me today: I give my all to establish myself. Perhaps it's my way of trying to cope with the sadness and heartbreak.  

Whilst all that sounded quite a turnaround and good on its own accord, I have certainly felt what you just described - I didn't necessarily feel the heartbreak anymore. But deep down I feel so numb and honestly I don't think I'll ever love someone the same way again. And that's okay, that person will always have a special place in my heart, just maybe not romantically anymore. 

I know it's hard for you, and I am a hypocrite myself for saying this, but you gotta push on. Stay busy, take up new hobbies. If you feel like you're still not ready to date anyone, then don't date anyone - friends are perfectly fine! I haven't healed fully yet, but I know that I will as long as I take my time and not rush it. 

All the best to you :)"
Tlazolteotll,fe6f6o3,t1_fe28wag,"I feel you man, it was so hard for me too and there are days that I remember all the things we did together I always drove her in the mornings to college and I remember just watching her all sleepy and feeling warm inside like she was all I needed to be happy. 

When the break up happened I was not in a good place to start but 9 months later I don't feel so heartbroken anymore. I still feel sad from time to time but I can do things now and I'm trying to make a good life for me

I wish you the best man."
Lacuna_q,fe1vqt2,t3_enla1g,"I totally get what you're talking about. I've been feeling like this for quite some time.

lawms98,fe4ogan,t3_enla1g,"April of 2018, i was dumped by my girlfriend after 2.5 years. We started dating in our home country 6 months before high school graduation. 10 months into our relationship, i moved to the states for college and we did another 10 months of long distance until she finally moved to the states for college and me. After another 10 months of being in the states together, we broke up. 10 sounds like my unlucky number i guess... anyways, i was not motivated to do anything. I didnt go to class and i put my college education and student visa in jeopardy. In a blink of an eye, its almost been 2 years since we ended. Im no longer heartbroken and im now over that selfish phase where i hated to see her move on quicker than i did. Im just happy that shes happy. From time to time, my heart still sinks and aches a little only because i miss her and her love is everything i have ever wanted but i just took it for granted when i still had her. My mom once told me that time is the best medicine. I thought it was bullshit because i felt like i wasnt gonna make it through the pain. I felt suicidal during the early stages. Over time, as i get used to that empty void that was once her, it got better and better and found happiness myself. So yes, time is the best medicine."
Savoiz,fe5u9fg,t3_enla1g,"Three months after break up and things have changed. Not so sure I'm not heartbroken anymore but I'm not in excruciating pain.

Bruin_NJ,fdpjl8v,t1_fdpezv8,"Yeah it happens. But our emotions run high when the one we love starts pulling away. Same happened to me. She started pulling away and needed space and time and I started begging and pleading. Little did I realize that the more I begged, the further I pushed her away. And ultimately, I pushed her away so much that she went to someone else and ain't coming back. Well, a lesson learnt!"

JaineLaine,ent1iv,top_level,"I miss everything about you but I've been scared to admit how much I miss the physical parts of our relationship - I dont know why.

I miss the way you would say something funny and then kiss me, causing me to laugh in the middle of it.

I miss straddling your lap and feeling your arms around me.

I miss how your touch was strong and gentle at the same time.

I miss the way you would get on your knees and hold my waist and hips while you kissed my stomach.

I miss the feel of your body on top of mine.

I remember the day I cut my finger and without hesitation, you took it in your hand and sucked the blood off of my skin. God, that was hot.

Similarly, the last time we had sex, you licked the sweat off of my stomach, between my ribcage and my bellybutton. What I wouldnt give to experience that from you again.

I miss the way you held both of my hands during sex and while you went down on me.

I miss the way I would lie against your chest after sex only to have you roll me on my back and start another session within minutes of the last.

I miss our phone sex.

I miss the dirty photos and text messages.

I miss the way your stubble felt on my skin after you skipped a day of shaving.

I miss the way you smell and how much it intensified when you were aroused.

I could go on forever. I miss absolutely everything about our sex, the way we touched, the way we kissed, the way we held each other. I miss that it was you doing all of those things because it wasnt about the sex itself, it was the bond between us.

I just fucking miss you."
HeyMotherfucker,fe4s1qs,t3_ent1iv,This. 100% this. I've had sex since the break-up and it wasn't the same.
Anynon1,fe5f28m,t3_ent1iv,"Right there with you. That was honestly (and sadly) one of the biggest things I have to get past. Our sex was the best I‚Äôve had in my life. Everything we did to each other was without hesitation and full of passion. We must knew each other‚Äôs bodies inside and out day one. 

I‚Äôve had sex with several people since her and I ended each night miserable and unsatisfied. One day when you‚Äôre in love again I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll feel that physical aspect again. Part of it for me is realizing that sex with a deep connection is unmatched. The next person that lights your fire will probably feel amazing to be with. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping for."

migustatacosmucho,eo51oe,top_level,"After my bad experience I protect myself from the damaging effects of breakups by following a few rules:

1. Don't plan a fantasy future (marriage, kids, lifestyle) with any partner.  Life invokes too many unknowns to count on them.

2. Never consider your partner a sure thing, and vice-versa.  People will often comparison shop your offer.

3. Alter your level of investment according to your partner's behavior.

4. Never try to control your partner.  You can't control anyone.

5. Be nice to yourself after getting dumped.  Don't change just because your partner chose to abandon you.

6. Don't do long term engagements."
broke_reflection,fe9nzo4,t3_eo51oe,"It's so hard to not do number 1. I mean what's the point of being with someone if you don't see yourself moving forward with them. 

Good people don't comparison shop. If you think someone is looking for someone better, don't bother staying with the relationship. 

That's true. You shouldn't make someone your everything when you are just a sometimes to them. But if you are, move on. 

Definitely can't control the other person, agree!! And be kind to yourself, always. 

Long term engagement is better than quick to marry. Divorce is way harder than breaking an engagement."
lotusray,feaa6ta,t1_fe9nzo4,True for me it's kinda like I need to know the person I will involve myself with will want children down the road if not I'm setting my self up for a break up since i don't want a childless marriage but at the same time I'm not picturing what our kids would look like

So lets say in the relationship you only focused on your partner but you slacked on working out, hobbies, work, etc.(Or even listening, being able to control your emotions, patient , etc)

Showing change for yourself will make them regret breaking up if you continue to level yourself up/ double your efforts to improve your life"

Being in a relationship is a risk. And that's why it has its upside rewards. 

Give it time. I'm 6 months after my breakup. It was a bad one. No cheating but severe emotional betrayal. 

I don't regret the relationship, and I cant wait to meet the next person that keeps me interested and admires me. And I'll be more intentional about checking if they have the same values as me. Reading between the lines. 

But there is no way in hell I won't take the risk again, make long term plans or invest in a partner. I'll take the risk, and get burnt, heal and find someone else. 

Life is too short to let our pain define how we live. For every bad breakup and relationship, there is a rock solid awesome one."
migustatacosmucho,febc6p0,t1_feb5xo2,"Not painful for me at all.  Had several good relationships since I devised my rules.  Eventually found my wife of 20 years.

Does anybody understand this? Is anybody here like this to give me some enlightenment on the matter?"
AdiosShosanna,fdo6oo8,t3_emeedr,Happened to me as well. I like to believe it is a defense mechanism of sorts.
Starmoon85,fdot5t8,t3_emeedr,Same with mine. One week she was telling me she loved and missed me and our sex life and that I shouldn‚Äôt be a stranger.

OreosAndDreams,fdpk2f5,t3_emeedr,"It may seem like your boyfriend changed over night, but that likely isn't the case.  People take a long time to change, so if you saw a sudden change in his words and actions, it likely means that he felt he had to leave for whatever reason but that it was really hard for him to go through with.  He didn't want to show weakness in his decision because he was worried you would stick around and try to get him back, and he feared he wouldn't be able to resist that.  So he was really cold to you in hopes that he would push you away.  At least, that's as much sense as I can make of this sort of thing."

I know it kind of gave me same details into my ex"
Bruin_NJ,fdpfi0i,t3_emeedr,"Exactly this happened to me. My ex broke up with me, then came back with all her love and within 20 days of coming back, became extremely cold. She denied coming back and sending all those lovey dovey messages. I confronted her on that and she said she was talking to me just as a friend cuz we had broken up. She didn't accept that we came back and told me that if I question her more or demand more explanations, she's gonna block me. Eventually, she blocked me from everywhere and moved on within a week. Clearly, she was with someone else.

Her coldness was so intense that I was just surprised if I was talking to the same person I had known. I felt as if I never knew that person. She went on to call me an asshole, liar, untrustworthy when the day before she told me that she sees herself getting married to me. Interestingly, that night when she said the marriage stuff, she disappeared her entire night. As in, I had no trace of her. Her phone was not reachable and she was not reading her texts. She was definitely with someone else and when I asked her what happened, she just shouted at me, ""you are not my dad, so I don't have to provide you any explanations what I did last night""

Fuck these people. They are heartless and don't realize thar their actions are fucking up the life of someone. They can't accept blame and pass on the guilt to someone else so that they can feel relieved. Yes, they would never come out clean. Dump these kind of people and move on. You are dodging a missile. Good luck!"
Testkaninen,fdpuq57,t3_emeedr,"I can relate to this, and yes, it\`s a defense/coping mechanism for insecure men. 

There is too little information in your post regarding your relationship to give a good answer to your question(length, dynamic, age..), but as previously stated in this thread - people put on masks all the time, work, school events, meetings etc. Some people live their life as an open canvas, sharing everything with everyone, others are like a closed book. Both types come with their own challenges and benefits, and both have a need to be understood and respected."
time__traveller__,fdpeyjf,t3_emeedr,"1.  Maybe they found someone new.  (My personal experience)
2.  They were not into commitments in the first place
3.   Something happened in their life and he/she doesnt want you to know. So they distance you out. 
4.  They are confused if they should have or not.

In-love we forget, people are nomadic, self-interested, instinctive creatures. You can give/take any excuse, it wont negate the fact that someone threw in the towel. No amount of attention, change, or adaption will bring back what you once felt.
