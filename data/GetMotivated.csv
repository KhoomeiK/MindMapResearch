Ajk320,fdsdwmc,t1_fdsbg0n,It's a song from a malayalam movie (mollywood) called Aadu. I don't know exactly what genre is this but you should check out the rest of the songs in the movie if you interested in this. Many of the characters in the movie have their own intro song which is pretty unique. The movie is very fun too.
vanillamasala,fdsu1c7,t1_fdsbg0n,"Yeah there’s not really a genre but you can check Indian film music on YouTube. This is Malayalam, so if you want more stuff like this just look for Malayalam film music, and if you like it also check out Tamil film music. I happen to also love Telugu and Hindi film music (this one is actually bollywood) as well! Someone else mentioned Bhangra which is Punjabi music, and it’s pretty poppy these days. Basically Indian music is LIT but they can be fairly different from language to language."

It was a team thing and while I was walking my team shouted at me that I should run. Like they were mad at me for being stupid not to run. Since this day I always was embarred by that but now I realise that I was the smart one and the rest were cheaters. If it was a real race, I would have won.

EDIT: so I answered off of what I was told when I was losing weight. I was off my mark and did my own research. Visceral fat can bring about, 
“elevated triglycerides, reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and/or elevated fasting plasma glucose”

You won't notice if you remove one or a few paper towels but if you stand it next to a full role it's noticeable.

Edit: change heavier to denser to please nitpickers. In a common sense talk, when people say heavier/lighter, it’s often about specific weight. I.e : wood is lighter than water so it float, helium is lighter than air so it rise. Hot air is lighter so it rise. Even in flying technical talks, people also use “lighter than air” to point to balloons, blimps, and heavier than air to point to.... (you get the point).

That means 1 lb of fat can propel your car about the same as 1/8 of a gallon of gasoline. 6 lbs would then be 6/8 of a gallon, so a car with an efficiency of about 27 mpg would be able to drive 20 miles with much energy.

If you say a feather weighs less than a car you don't go ""actually one pound of feather weighs the same as one pound of car"". Obviously the units matter, as anybody with even the worst middle school education can tell you. In context they are obviously stating that by volume, muscle weighs more than fat.

What that means is that if you have 1 cm^3 of fat and 1 cm^3 of muscle the muscle will weigh more. So of two almost identical people, one with an equal volume of muscle, to another with an equal volume of fat, the muscle guy weighs more."

monneyy,fea2ca1,t1_fe9obzn,"Did you account for the car only making use of less than 30% of that energy if it's a combustion engine?

Also, you have to burn 3500 kilo calories to burn a pound of fat. We just say calories, but it's actually kcal. kilo calories. 

Calories are defined as the energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 °C. 3500 calories would only be able to raise the temperature of a gallon of water by 1 °C or 2°F. The amount of fat we would need to keep a body warm with that would mean that we wouldn't even last a day without eating. 

Fats and oils roughly have the same overall energy. And while a car uses about 30% of it, we use about 50% for mechanical work, if it's not just shooting a bow, but more movement, like running.

Going with your 1/8220 number, multiplying it with 1000 (kcal) and then with 6 gives us roughly 6/8th of a galon worth of energy. Which is what could drive you about 20 miles."

The newer weight guidelines I've seen go by [waist-height ratio](https://www.healthyweightforum.org/eng/calculators/waist-height-ratio/), which is just as simple but more useful. A fat person and a muscular person might be the same height and the same weight, and thus have the same BMI, but they'd definitely have different waist measurements. Waist-height ratio takes that into account. Now the muscular person isn't erroneously labeled as obese.

I'm thrilled about this as a person who is obese according to the BMI but low-risk according to waist-height ratio. I don't need to be hounded about my weight when I'm already fine."

Kepabar,fea9f6b,t1_fe92ufb,"I lost 50 pounds in 2019 and it was actually pretty easy. I've had other friends and family follow my same method and seen a lot of weight loss over the last year. My mother lost nearly 150 pounds!

The important bit is to not think of a diet as a temporary measure. It's a permanent life change.

So whatever diet you go on you need to accept the idea of doing it for the rest of your life.

I think weight loss isn't difficult but it's hard, just like any major life change. My method was:  
1) Get a food scale.  
2) Grab a calorie tracking app. I used MyFitnessPal at first but now use Samsung Health.  
3) Let the app set you a calorie goal for each day.  
4) Record EVERYTHING you eat in the app. Weigh things in the scale to make sure you are ACCURATELY recording portions.  
5) NEVER go over your calorie count. This is the 'hard' part because at first you are going to either have to make massive changes to your eating habits or go hungry. I make exceptions for major holidays, but no more than once a month at most.  
6) What this really means is 'no cheat days'. If you want to eat something specific you need to re-arrange your food intake for that day so you have the spare calories for it. Or exercise extra to burn off the calories.  

For example, I used to eat cereal a lot for breakfast. But most cereal is terrible for you and I've found that fruit and yogurt is a great alternative and half the calories per bowl.

Or I eat Chipotle maybe once a few months instead of once a week. My kind of burrito is 1100 calories, so when I do want one I know I need to eat something really light for lunch to save the calories.

For people first starting out I recommend just recording what you eat regularly for the first week or two and not trying to cut back. Then you can plainly see where all your calories are going and what you are OK cutting out to get under the calorie limit.

If your calorie count is super high (say, your limit is supposed to be 1800 but you are eating 4000), then slowly lower that daily cap down. Don't go from 4000 calories a day to 1800. You will be miserable. Go from 4000 to 3500 one week, then down more the next and so on.

Eventually you'll find that there are probably a lot of foods that you think are OK but aren't worth the calories and that you may be doing a ton of mid day snacking that you don't realize. You'll find those foods that are important to you and find a way to keep them in your diet and you'll drop those unhealthy foods that just aren't worth it to you.

At the end of the day there is no magical diet for you to follow. You need to find what food combinations work for your tastes while keeping you under your calorie limit. Fad diets are things to avoid because they don't produce lasting changes in your eating habits. If you just keep under your calorie count and stay there for the rest of your life then you will naturally be the right weight and will never have to worry about it coming back."

theRealDerekWalker,fe9y4no,t1_fe9aynn,"As soon as you hit your goal, set more. Sign up for a 10k or half marathon 3 months out. Maybe build up to a marathon.

Also, find sports that you love and want to get better at. I found Muay Thai and Jiu Jitsu (although very fun, bjj is hard on the body). 

Don’t stop planning our your recipes. They don’t always have to be healthy but have them be at least home made and anticipated."
LvS,fe9z7zg,t1_fe9aynn,"My tip would be to find a thing you do that benefits from you weighing less.

The obvious example is working out in some form (it's amazing how much faster you run if you don't carry two crates of beer with you - that's about 60lbs I guess), but it can also be makeup or painting yourself, where you like to work with a better looking you. Or taking the bike to work/school."

It took me 5 months to put on about 18 pounds by going to the gym 4 days a week and more importantly, dirty bulking. It can be done naturally for sure. I just ate like shit and went out of my way to avoid cardio (only lifted at the gym). You can gain a lot of weight quickly if you try because your metabolism literally won’t see it coming. Where I personally ran into trouble is after a while, my already-high metabolism caught up and I got stuck at that +18lb mark. I plateaud, if you will."
clexecute,feaz15y,t1_feapdl1,"So as the guy you responded said, it isn't all muscle some of its fat from eating unhealthy.

No one should be criticized for overeating if it's part of their bulking plan, but I also believe only a few % of people have the will power and mindset to successfully bulk and cut.

I lost 40 pounds a few years back and have kept it all off, each time I try to ""bulk up"" I end up gaining 2-5 pounds and plataeuing.

SanityPills,feahcio,t1_fe9lix9,"It largely depends on how much you weigh to begin with. At my heaviest I was 225, and I dropped down to 150. I couldn't visibly notice any difference until I dropped about 20 pounds, and most other people didn't start noticing until I hit somewhere between 30-40. As I lost more and more weight, the amount I needed to lose to be visibly noticeable shrank more and more.

And you'll lose it again once your hydration is better. It's not like those first weeks are nothing, they are something plus water weight."

They ambush him and, before killing him, one of the Wildlings asks ""How have you been surviving up here all alone, old man?"" To which the old man responds ""Suppose it doesn't really matter now, does it?."" The wildling shakes his head. ""No. It doesn't matter now.""

hhdumpling,fe05xrg,t1_fdxfuzt,"I recently found stoicism. I kinda just accidentally started to become a stoic in least year or so before I watched a video on YouTube about it. I was trying to get a promotion for a couple of years. I wasn't getting a lot of useful feedback from my supervisor so I decided to just try the best I could no matter what. I already knew what I needed to do. Why was I waiting on my boss to tell me?

I had already been falling into a stoic habit before that, though. Shit happens. Your life isn't going to be super amazing. The only thing you can do is be the best person you can be. If you fail today, try again tomorrow, but don't give yourself an excuse about it. You're human and humans make mistakes and are flawed. Accept that and try to be better next time. 

Be a better human. Nobody else is going to make you. It's up to you."

punaisetpimpulat,fe0bf7o,t1_fdzrql4,"The main idea here is to figure out if something is within your control. You can't change the past, so don't burden yourself with it.

Here's an example. Getting a job is something you can influence, so focus your energy on that. Once you've sent your best application, you can still influence the process by giving them a call, but after that you should probably just move on. Unless you have magical abilities to manipulate the minds of others, you can't realistically change the outcome of that process, so don't worry about it."

FondleBuddies,fdzj0mh,t1_fdxq5c4,"Try again. And again. And again. Never drop it.

I (Scotland) left school with no good grades. Started at the bottom in college. Got to the top an got to start my passion project. Went to University. Built my passion project.

I failed. I had to resit a module to finally graduate. My project didn't work, it fell apart and the components I had were useless.

I applied back to university. I got back in to the Masters programme. I am now working on my project one final time. This time with far better resources.

Never give up if it is your true passion. It's harder without support of your school but you would be suprised how much of your life starts to provide for it.

Last year I bought a 3D printer. A dream I had since I started college and will help make my project work. I went to college 7 years ago.

My advice is try to find either someone who understands you or someone who has no idea what you are talking about. My supervisor chose me I'm certain because my project seemed bizzare. Unfortunately he couldn't help but I had access to the Uni's resources.

I hope something here helps you. I don't know if it's art, engineering, music or pole dancing that your passion lies in but my point is don't give up. That is just the first hurdle. Many more are to come and you need to just let them come."

you_have_my_username,fduc2sd,t1_fdtou4q,"I teach swim lessons to people of all ages. One of the most heartbreaking things is seeing how many adults feel awkward, shy, and embarrassed to have to learn. I guarantee that no experienced swimmer is looking down on you and judging you while you’re in a lesson, it just doesn’t happen. And all the other adults who take their kids to lessons and see adults swimming in there as well look on hoping they can get the confidence to learn someday.

Just go do it! Nobody judges you, least of all the instructor. Swimming is a skill you can keep for the rest of your life and is very rewarding."

I remember walking into the pool the first day, it's a big place with a few pools and they have kids lessons on at the same time, I was embarrassed walking past all those parents to my part of the pool with the other couple of adult learners. I have to say though the teacher I had was amazing.

 Before I started I was terrified of water but after the first lesson I could feel the difference. The next week I went back I didn't even notice the other people there because I was focused on improving and building my water confidence. No one is judging you, I even got comments from some of the parents on how much I'd improved. 

Just go for it dude. If someone like me that couldnt even walk out to my waist without freaking out can learn to swim anyone can!"

That said, as a kid I had an instructor who thought the best way to teach me to get used to being underwater was to hold my head down until I stopped squirming.  It took 35 years before I could get near water again.  Now, I'm self conscious about being an old man screaming like a little girl because I got water up my nose...  But I'm gonna fucking do it."

It's also fun and relaxing and damn good exercise, I'd you're into those sorts of things."

No one cared as I flailed in the pool or attempted to ride a bike worse than most five-year-olds. Now I can do both and swimming has become my favorite method of exercise. I still suck at biking, though I'm functional at least, and my son likes riding around the neighborhood with me."
PlusSizedGymnast,fduvdqy,t1_fduc2sd,">  I guarantee that no experienced swimmer is looking down on you and judging you while you’re in a lesson, it just doesn’t happen.

I imagine it's like watching an adult learn to ride a bike. It's commendable, but still kinda funny. It's not like your friend is pointing and laughing at them.

Bjj is absolutely fantastic for smaller people. I've started seeing a large influx of teenage girls in the gym for this exact reason. My older brother has always been a big guy that loves to fight. He bench presses 300+ pounds. The guy is a monster. We wrestled in my back yard recently, and I pretty much dominated him. His strength got the better of me a couple times, but for the first time in my life, I finally felt physically on-par with him, and it was one of the best feelings I've ever felt.

This doesn't surprise me one bit. I always tell people this. Literally 2 weeks of BJJ will already put you like MILES ahead of people who have zero grappling experience. Because even knowing the basics like the guillotine and rear naked choke and the fundamentals like controlling your breathing and controlling your opponents leverage points is enough to beat anyone who doesn't know what they're doing. I used to wrestle my friends after school all the time and my friend Brandon always beat everyone.

...I feel so so SO awkward doing them. I've now tried them on 2 different leg days, and gave up both times 1/2 way through the first set because I felt like I looked so awkward.

I need to just power through feeling like that and just do it... And probably ask the trainer on duty for some help to make sure my form is right. 

Ok... I'll try it again this week.

love_that_fishing,fdwcrue,t3_en2btf,Important to remember you never have to be a master to enjoy something. I’ve played guitar for 50 years. Still not that good and pick it up for months and maybe not play for months but still enjoy it when I do. Right now playing some daily and really enjoying it again. I just don’t want the pressure of thinking I have to work towards a goal really. Just want to enjoy the time I spend with it. To each his own.
thelittlemisses,fdwgz16,t3_en2btf,"I recently picked up disc golf as a hobby.

I am so intimated to tee off (your first throw that you try and make go as far as possible) with others watching, which happens on busy days. I went to play solo and 3 guys asked if I wanted to join them.

It was really cool to play at an elevated level, and it made me even more excited to keep playing.

These guys are good players, but never once made me feel like they cared that I sucked. I am so happy I fought the fear of playing solo so I ended up at the park that day!"

I'm gonna give it my best shot, and hopefully, this'll be a jumpstart for a new career."
highspeed_dirt,fdxo60r,t1_fdwo77u,"I’m a graphic designer, and for 20 years only did print work. I knew verrrry little about HTML, CSS, etc, and said many times I couldn’t learn it, because “my brain just didn’t work that way.” 5 years ago, after getting laid off from a job, I found a new one that required HTML knowledge. I knew just enough to get through the interview, got the job, and immediately started watching all the tutorial videos I could find. 

5 years later I’m no expert, but I know infinitely more about writing markup, and I build emails and websites all day every day.

It’s learning a new language. Patience and repetition (and not being afraid to ask lots of questions of people who know more than you) will pay off! Stick with it!"
Shlano613,fdxpi2q,t1_fdxo60r,"Thank you for the encouragement <3. The first 3 weeks of the course are going to be focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then the remaining 9 weeks or so are going to be focusing on mainly Python and the basics of full stack development. I've done alittle HTML and CSS as a prereq for the course and I understood and applied them pretty well I think! 

I have to just keep telling myself that all beginnings are hard and everyone has to start somewhere. I'm nervous to start, but I'm excited to find out where this will take me!"

Incidentally, a friend turned me on to a game called Rocksmith (available for most game consoles; I’m playing on Xbox 360). Similar to Rock Band/Guitar Hero, but you’re actually playing on your own guitar/bass. Very good tool with tutorials, lessons, and options to practice certain riffs and parts of songs. May not be as good as a real teacher, but it has me improving little by little, just getting my fingers to do what my brain is telling them to!

WasRadio,fe6qcby,t1_fe6o1rm,That's what sucks about it. No matter how well you treat others there will always be people who treats you bad. The best way to be good to yourself is to be a bit shitty too - for your own protection. Believing in the good of other people is what makes them take advantage of you.

Elbobosan,fe814cj,t1_fe6q71i,"Don’t let others’ reactions dictate your own.  Be satisfied with the good action you are taking for yourself instead of seeking validation in the response from others.  I’m not doubting your suffering or that you were unfairly used, but neither makes your approach right or good. 

Don’t keep dipping your bucket in a dry well and blaming the well for your thirst.  You have apparently done this so thoroughly a few times that you have come to believe that all wells are lies and you are doomed to be thirsty forever despite seeing people walking around with full buckets all the time.  If this keeps happening to you, it’s likely the common element is you. Try to figure out what’s wrong with your well selection process.

When you interact with another person on a personal level, do things for them with the UNCOMMUNICATED expectation of being rewarded for that behavior, and then blame them for not meeting your expectations, that’s r/niceguys material. You aren’t there yet, but you sound closer than you may think and you need to do some self reflection about the black & white “logic” behind your actions and expectations. Then go try again, knowing it likely won’t be perfect, might be worse, and isn’t your last chance to try again."

Snoop771,fe7a1br,t3_enz7gg,True. Small acts of cruelty (including apathy) also have a tremendous impact.
Xenophic99,fe7wx2z,t1_fe7a1br,"When you go over the effects of my and other people's apathy, it has caused more harm than direct malice.

And it eats you up, knowing you could have just cared a little more, and maybe changed things."
Snoop771,fe7z2nq,t1_fe7wx2z,"You're right, the suffering in this world is only sustained by apathy. Truely malicious people are far outnumbered by the apathetic and the malicious would be powerless if there was no apathy. We're all guilty of it to an extent, some far more than others. If it eats you up it's no longer apathy. Regret means you're changing for the better, that's great. Some people go their whole lives not giving a sh!t about the suffering they caused. If there is justice at the end of this life I'll gladly pay my price knowing that I truely deserve it and that it is fair."

mattiay,fe75dqo,t1_fe73855,"Make food and bring it for your co workers. 
Buy something helpful or useful that will genuinely help someone you know.
When someone is struggling take them aside and initiate a conversation and give them the floor, listen and offer your support to make things easier. 
If it is someone you know do a household chore for them.
Compliment a person on something they value.

To be honest its about intuition and empathy. 
I suggest you read up on the languages of love to give an idea of how people tend to communicate on a interpersonal level. 
Just try to give more.  You will be surprised how real honest words and acts of service will help those in need.

One of the most heartwarming people I ever met was my previous line manager.
He was humble, believed in the best of people and approached everyone differently seeking for their strengths and being aware of limitations. Laughter and knowing when to listen made him popular with anyone he met and not once did his ego get in the way. 
He was not an exceptional person by any means, just wanted people to enjoy themselves. I learned so much from him,  I miss him so much."

ulengrau,fe21qx6,t1_fe1sx3u,"Most modern quotes are not really from the people who are claimed to have spoken them. A lot of Buddha and Einstein quotes, for example, are fake.

Call it a consequence of the “new age boom” of the 70s-80s. Unknown writers who wanted to sell their books needed a way to get people to pay attention to their methods and systems, so they used things like Asian proverbs, unverified anecdotes, and, yes, world famous names under made up statements in order to make them sound more valid/powerful."
psychedDown,fe2cn6q,t1_fe21qx6,"yeah, i just read it. you're right.

he did say something similar but way more vague  that sounds more like what a philosopher from that time frame would say xD.

“Whatever rules you have adopted, abide by them as laws, and as if you would be impious to transgress them; and do not regard what anyone says of you, for this, after all, is no concern of yours. How long, then, will you delay to demand of yourself the noblest improvements, and in no instance to transgress the judgments of reason? You have received the philosophic principles with which you ought to be conversant; and you have been conversant with them. For what other master, then, do you wait as an excuse for this delay in self-reformation? You are no longer a boy but a grown man. If, therefore, you will be negligent and slothful, and always add procrastination to procrastination, purpose to purpose, and fix day after day in which you will attend to yourself, you will insensibly continue to accomplish nothing and, living and dying, remain of vulgar mind. This instant, then, think yourself worthy of living as a man grown up and a proficient. Let whatever appears to be the best be to you an inviolable law. And if any instance of pain or pleasure, glory or disgrace, be set before you, remember that now is the combat, now the Olympiad comes on, nor can it be put off; and that by one failure and defeat honor may be lost or—won.”

Krickett22,fe6uvyl,t1_fe6spum,"Honestly I kinda had to make new friends and stop hanging out with my drinking friends. Like we still talk and if they go somewhere with food I'll meet them there just to eat and usually leave shortly after. That's kind of rare though since I just try to avoid drinking situations, just for now you know. My favorite thing to do is fishing so I quit drinking in spring when fishing was on here! I would go every weekend by myself and I made a friend at the docks my age who also didnt drink so then we would both go like every weekend. I also really love to disc golf. Theres quite a few golfers who drink but I have met a whole crew of guys at the course now that dont drink and we meet up to go play like every few days. 

My advice is go do hobbies you already like but go alone at first and meet new people there who have the same goals as you. Then just keep growing from there :)"
Krickett22,fe706og,t1_fe6w9mj,Thank you!! And I lost 30 pounds. Like a win win! Do good things and good things will happen. I am sorry to hear about your family.

EDIT: hey seriously though, what you're doing for yourself is amazing and don't stop for anyone or anything. Keep pushing yourself to new heights and you'll never know how high you'll go."
Mitt_Romney_USA,fe9lgmk,t1_fe6og1u,"Good news for you then! If you've made it for 30 days without alcohol (or too much Tylenol or other drugs that are processed in the liver), then your liver is back to 100%.

It's an incredible organ. Even in cases where 60+% of the liver is damaged, it can bounce back to full health in one month.

I take January off of drinking every year for that reason. I love booze, but chronic liver damage isn't part of my life plan.

The other reason I take a month off is because I want to know that I can. It's hard to tell how dependent I am on beer for stress relief and fun times. 

As long as my January's are still fun and I'm not craving the drink, I'll go back to the bottle, but if I struggle to stay sober some January in the future, that's when I'll either get help or speedrun to rock bottom."

What's stopping this single mother from taking online or night classes to get an education, get a better job, so she's more able to provide for her three kids? All she has to do is find an hour or two a night to study. I'll agree that since she doesn't have a ton of time she can't take a full course load so at half time it'll take her a little longer to complete a degree (even less if she chooses a certification program), but a little longer is not never.

Then within a few years she'll have that completed. She can get the better job. She get's paid better and has more time for her kids. A small sacrifice in the short term for a better long term outcome vs. just continuing to scrape by."

I distanced away from some “friends” it turned out that we only had alcohol in common. 

It hates awkward sometimes when at the party I’m having tea or soft drink. Some people get annoyed that I’m not drinking.

It’s important to understand that alcohol could be a way to self medicate. If there are certain issues in ones life it should be fixed and alcohol abuse will become less. 

Anyway good luck to all who is about to quit. Staying sober is super cool."
tobin611,fe6s2yd,t3_entdu1,"Your attitude about this says a lot about your worldview. I hate how the single mom gets brought up so much. Yes it is a sad situation. However she didn't get that way overnight.  She chose to have the children.  And before you say anything about abortion, I mean specifically she chose to have sex, knowing that could very likely lead to children. Partner was bad? She chose him. Don't have children if you aren't 100% ready to take fully responsibility for them. Point is you have to make a ton of choices before you end up the single mom with 2 crappy jobs. If the net sum of those choices is negative, your life probably sucks. If the net sum is positive, your life probably doesn't suck that much. I made lots of bad choices.  Now I have to work very hard to dig myself out. I was a strung out homeless junkie. Relying on government benefits. Now I am gainfully employed, housed, and off all government assistance. Consistent hard work is key. Yeah you may have to work harder than others if you've gotten in a hole, but it pays off once you have climbed out and are on the path to your own happiness and success."

Also had another relative. Worked hard, didn’t earn big bucks but was frugal and lived within his means. Never smoked, drank but never to excess, just one or two here and there. Spent a lot of time driving to work and back each day. Died of terminal cancer a couple of years before retirement.

The reality is that you are going to die and if you spend your life working your ass off for some pot of gold at the end of the rainbow then you are a fool. Even if you are a success, at what cost? Essentially thousands upon thousands of hours you will never get back.

Drugs are fine but you can't stay high forever and during the times I wasn't high I didn't feel so good. But when I'm regularly going to the gym I feel good all the time, even the days I don't go to the gym. It's a high to walk around feeling and knowing that I am stronger, healthier, faster and sharper than 99% of the people who don't work out. I'm no spring chicken either, I'm 47 now. But I'm healthier than most people half my age. I work my muscles, heart and mind. Healthy beats drugs hands down in every way.

I still get cravings to do drugs, they never really stop, and I have done drugs on the rare occasion (twice a year or so) but the high, the comedown and the days that follow are just reminders to me why I've chosen a different way of life now.

pjx1,fe8uf68,t3_eo1uwr,"There are multiple federal and state laws that disagree with this statement. Such as convicted felons cannot own guns. Convicted felons are also prohibited from certain employment such as law enforcement, the school system, and hospitals.  If a felon is convicted of a drug charge it will become a significant barrier if the offender decides to pursue education and to pursue a professional discipline such as nursing, medicine, teaching, real estate, insurance, transportation, financial services, or the practice of law. Not only can a felony become a barrier to receiving financial aid, the felony will become a barrier to entering a professional discipline. Also a drug felon cannot own liquor licenses, become pharamaicst, doctor, own radio or television stations, or own a garbage company, and many many more. 

Our society makes felony a life sentence."
SpookyNinjas,fe9fq4a,t1_fe8uf68,"Not just that, this logic is clearly flawed. We as a society actively try to make failure a life sentence.

It has been consistently shown, that whenever a barrier was thought to be reached, being proven that it could be overcome by a pioneer, almost immediately led to many others achieving the same thing. The 100m dash is notorious for whenever a new record was set, the entire field would move up with it, and every time everyone thought: ""OK, this is as a fast as a human being can sprint"", and they were proven wrong again and again.

Don't give yourself up because when you are down and feel like you can't get up, thats the moment when you have to decide if you want to keep fighting or give up. Trust me, if you come closer to death as i did, you just won't be able to get up everytime. So don't let yourself down ANYTIME. No matter how hard it is. I made this mistake. Almost died. I had no friends to talk with, my mum was stressed af, my grades said i was such a dumbass. No one cared about me. I felt like i was just a obstacle to society, a ""black sheep"", but being different is great. Everyone reading this, you are strong. You are beautiful, you are capable of doing anything. Don't throw your life away as i did just because life fucked you one time. There will be so mamy occasions when you will be able to fuck life harder than ever. Be positive. See the positive in everything. Do what you like. Do what you want. Life is yours, so are its rules. Fuck about what other say. Keep going. Never give up.

Your emotions and mood are your success. If you feel like shit all the time, you’re earning money for nothing. For failure.

What matters most for your success is learning to cope with the hand you’ve been dealt, finding happiness where you can, and showing the world that you can and will do your best. 

In part, that’s making good habits, and feeling like you have strong work ethic, yes, but it’s also being strong enough to also care for yourself.

Invest in you. Go to the gym to become who you want to be. Or paint to become who you want to be. Or make a video game.

Just find your humanity in you."
thegreatsorcerer,fe18hzt,t1_fdmkapv,"I think that this is more about creating discipline and schedule for the work that is important for you and not about slave labor kind of work.

How many times we skip the gym because we don't feel like it or don't spend painting because we are not in the mood.

All I wanted to say was that whatever you want to do, just create a schedule and stick to it.  All successful people that I have read about talk of discipline and a schedule and the importance of sticking to it. For example Stephen Kings writes daily irrespective of what is happening in his world. That discipline to stick to that schedule makes him one of the most prolific writers of our time.

I have realized that mood, motivation, zone etc are temporary. Once you start doing something, the small problems that you solve in that task, the incremental achievements boost your morale and turn your mood around.

Of course if the work is soul sucking, then you must ask yourself why you still want to do it.

Hope you have a good day. Smile :)"
sylsau,fdk4bds,t3_elp2w6,"So true.

You should always focus on what you have or have already achieved rather than on things you do not yet have.

If you fail to do this, you will simply never be happy."

LizardWater,fec2axf,t3_eoc7j6,It's measured by the amount of different values and goals a person reaches which most people try to achieve and want to achieve. The ones who fail to achieve these goals and values in life often think that they mean nothing and the people who achieved them were in a better position and it was easier for them to achieve. The truth is that nothing comes without hard work and people who reach their goals and values in life worked the hardest.
