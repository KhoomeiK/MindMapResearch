brenthuras,eld88t,top_level,"Hopefully for obvious reasons.

A lot of us here are asking questions like:

\- How do I *get myself* to get out of bed on time?  
\- How do I *fool myself* into thinking that I like broccoli?  
\- How do I *push myself* into hitting the gym every day?

... and what's worse is that you'll actually receive answers to these questions! People will teach you the latest techniques on pushing yourself, prodding yourself, punishing yourself, and tricking yourself.

But how would you feel if someone were asking internet people for ways to push, punish or trick you? Would you like it? Would you be willing to go along with what's being asked of you? Probably not! Whatever they try might work once or twice but ultimately you'd find a way to get out of it.

*However you treat yourself is how you yourself are treated.*

If you're harsh or cruel toward yourself, then your very existence will feel harsh, cruel, threatening.

But if you're kind with yourself, then the opposite happens.

*Disabuse yourself of this idea that being nice to yourself means nothing will get done*. You can only make true progress, true growth, true evolution, by being increasingly kind and loving with yourself. You can only get yourself to cooperate with you if you're kind and understanding.

Example: You're having trouble with procrastination.

DON'T ask ""what's wrong with me?"" because nothing's wrong with you. DO ask ""Why am I procrastinating about this? What do I need? What's scary or overwhelming about this? What is my procrastination attempting to tell me?""

When you ask THOSE questions, you use the answer to figure out how to make the task more inviting, more enjoyable. THIS means that you no longer need to overcome yourself in order to do it - you can just simply do it.

I hope this helps! Please leave a comment if this requires more elaboration.

ivyivory,fdh1yo7,t3_eld88t,"What an unpopular idea! I tried torturing myself and hating myself into growing for years, and stunted my development. Now I know that growth can only come from a place of love. Tough love, sometimes, but love. Alright I'm done being a sap, just be gentle with yourself and the progress will come a lot faster."
brenthuras,fdh42ex,t1_fdh1yo7,"Absolutely! I like to think of it as self-leadership. Or like the kind of leadership from a parent to a child. The child wants to eat a whole box of Oreos, say, there's no need to go like ""What's wrong with you! You piece of shit!"" LOL... you can do something like ""I totally get it love, but why don't we eat something else...?"""
NickoBicko,fdsni2l,t1_fdh1yo7,"I personally have a problem with the concept that we “torture” or “punish” ourselves. 

Not that we don’t. 
But it seems overused. 

It seems more often that we are nagging or pushing ourselves, even in a shitty way. 

Like a fat person starving themselves. 
They aren’t doing it as “punishment” but in their deperation to not be fat. 

An actual punishment/torture would be like punishing themselves after a misstep by eating something that tastes bad. Or taking away something positive. 

This also highlights the difference between punishment and torture. 

So I’m curious how you used to “torture” yourself. 

We’re you inflicting pain on yourself for a positive purpose? 

Or pain for the sake of retribution or teaching yourself a lesson or using pain to modify your behavior?"

TPalms_,fdhl69f,t1_fdh42ex,"This is great, I try and think like this when I exercise self-compassion and treat my self that is having the struggle like they are just a little kid. You don't blow up on a toddler for doing toddler things, and in many respects the different aspects of our ""self"" are still in toddler form and we have to nourish them to maturity to join the collective ""self"". I like how you frame it as self-leadership, that's a good tool."
akromyk,fdj449n,t1_fdh42ex,"Your parenting analogy hits home. How can I be a good parent as my child grows up when I'm a toxic parent towards my monkey-mind self inside? I need to work on myself before they get older.

onlyhelpfulthings,fdj26mv,t1_fdi8y8q,"Saying ""What's wrong with you? You piece of shit!"" is not asking a question. It's straight-up emotional abuse and can very damaging. Just to clarify. People who say things like this to you should never be allowed to stay in your life."

visionbreaksbricks,fdh5pap,t3_eld88t,Yeah I’ve always felt like guys like David Goggins are just masochists that get pleasure out of beating themselves up and dress it up with the word “discipline”.
getmypornon,fdht261,t1_fdh5pap,"In one sense I think you're right about David Goggins. But I also think dismissing him as a just a masochist is missing an opportunity to learn what he can teach you about motivation. 

I believe he does enjoy beating himself up but not for the sake of being beat up in and of itself. He does such hard things because he enjoys a high amount of reward from the idea of getting through those hard things. 

In other words, it's not the pain that gets him off, it's the idea that he was capable of pushing through the pain that gets him off. Every time he shares all the hard and painful things he's done, he's rewarding himself. It's a simple equation. He tells himself I'm awesome for trying to do this hard thing. And then if he succeeds he can tell himself I'm awesome for trying AND I'm awesome for succeeding. I'm double awesome. 

It's so much easier to do hard things when you start with the mindset of I'm awesome for even trying which makes it easier to succeed which makes it more likely to end up with double awesome. Plus because the things he does are crazy it's easy to get other people to agree wow you're awesome for even trying that. So then he has access to a constant fix of feeling awesome. which makes it even easier to do another crazy difficult thing. 

Anyway the point of all this, the thing to learn from David Goggins is to develop the skill of telling yourself ""I'm awesome for even trying."" If you can develop that skill, doing hard things becomes so much easier."
biggiantporky,fdhk96o,t1_fdh5pap,"David Goggins has the mindset of a Navy Seal. When you go through Navy Seal training, they physically/mentally break you to the point you don't feel any emotion when doing a task... Which is understandable as Navy Seals need to be heavily disciplined. The problem is when you try to enforce that mindset on an random average Joe from the street. There is a big reason why the dropout rate is high when it comes to Navy Seal training. Most people could not endure that intensity."
Koovin,fdipspi,t1_fdh5pap,I think you’re right that he’s able to go deeper into the pain cave than the average person. But he talks a lot about how he was socially awkward and had severe learning disabilities as a child. So he wasn’t able to solve problems the same way as others. All he had was sheer willpower to get through life. It sounds like he learned very early on that pain and suffering equals progress.

broletmehitthejuul,fdmqlc1,t1_fdh5pap,"Not really. He told himself he was the hardest motherfucker alive until it became reality. His whole philosphy is that you have to push yourself to endure suffering to build mental toughness to be comfortable in uncomfortable situations. What he talks about is really the basics of discipline yourself, it's just that he takes it to a very extreme level. A level that it takes to be the very best in the military. But not everyone wants to be a top navy SEAL."
glitteristheanswer,fdhm6w7,t1_fdhk96o,"Shit so my ballet upbringing wasnt far from navy seal training? Shit. 

Though ditto I noticed for me the brute force method works well but for most it won't. The only thing I'd say your average Joe could learn that's brute force is to wake up and just put in the ""training hours"" even if you dont want to that day just put in the hours for a little bit and then if after a few hours you arent in the groove, stop. Mainly helpful though if you're depressed or have ADHD."
visionbreaksbricks,fdn6wos,t1_fdmqlc1,"I’m not a Goggins expert, but it seems like from what I’ve seen, most if his self-talk is negative. “Get after it, pussy”
I just don’t think this is a guy who particularly likes himself, and I think he’s just acting out some sort of trauma that’s managed to catch on.

I can understand giving yourself some tough love if you’re headed for a heart attack because you can’t stop eating doughnuts and drinking milkshakes, but if you’re making yourself run to the point where you’re shitting yourself, I don’t think it’s healthy."

ruttino,fdh9j27,t3_eld88t,"Great one, Brent.

I was able to make changes in my life only after I understood this. 

Too often blogs, gurus and authors don't mention this because they're only focused on selling you the ""latest hypertransformational motivescion"" bullshit, and they just say to people to ""wake up at 0500, go to gym, go for a run, meditate, work on your startup, then go to your 9-5"" like it should be the most natural thing in the world, but it isn't. 

Natural is something that maintains the status quo, and you need to ***consistently break*** ***it*** in order to achieve your goals.

You must sacrifice your comfort and win your demons. And that's not a ""natural"" task. 

But you keep beating up and treating yourself as a ""piece of malfunctioning equipment"" because you ""did not lose 10kgs in 2 weeks"" and you did not ""invent the new iPhone"". Instead of doing things from a positive POV (e.g. I want to go for a run because this will help me have a nice body, good health and confidence), you're doing them from a negative one (e.g. I must go for a run because otherwise I'm a fat lazy pig).

This puts an enormous pressure and anxiety, because you don't see the small victories, but instead criticize yourself to the point that you stop doing what you do just to avoid this stress.

Hey, even if you lost 1kg, that's still progress. And even if you did not invent the new iPhone, but only made a draft in paint, that's still progress.

You must accept yourself, and by that I mean that you have to love yourself, have a positive self-dialogue and incourage yourself no matter your situation.

***Don't be your tyrant, be your mentor.***

Don't rush, don't understimate the effort and time required, and give yourself the permission to fail.

Start with small steps, and you will see things will start come together as you wish."

stringdom,fdi8v3r,t1_fdi4ugc,"> And eventually, your subconscious will take notice of the positive effects too. That's the entire basis of behavioural therapy.

I'm going to stop you right there because that is not how behavioral therapy works. There is no ‘subsconcious’ on behavioral therapy.

If you want to enjoy sports, then enjoy sports. If you hate your job, strive for a job change. The amount of people who think they have to suffer to be happy then question why they feel miserable is too damn high. If you treat yourself miserably and direct yourself to suffering, you are going to suffer, is not rocket science. Is just that so many people buy into the notion that effort and hard work have to be unpleasant that they confuse making themselves suffer with progress.

Circumventing mental blockages is akin to overcoming physical limitations. It is not possible, you can't run faster than what your body can run. You can't do more than what your mind can do. Stop thinking about your mind as not yours or as external to yourself. You *are* your mind, you can't circumvent yourself, that's suicide.

Being honest and caring with oneself is a better strategy. Understand your real motives and goals, be honest about what and why you don't want to do. Forgive yourself when you fail at a goal. Work hard because you enjoy the work, not because you *have to*. And if you have to, then be honest about hating it and why, and why you will do it anyway. Stop trying to hack your brain as if you were a machine, because you aren't. You are your mind, your brain, a human, treat yourself like you would treat a good friend. Tell yourself when you are being an asshole and be thankful when you accomplish something, however little it might be.

riricide,fdjdf8i,t1_fdi4ugc,"That is not how behavior therapy works. Yes, it asks you to take action because actions precede feelings. But when someone is either habitually procrastinating or just not able to get a move on in some aspect of life, there needs to be a deep reckoning of what is bothering them behind the scenes. Once the emotional block is fleshed out they can begin to engage with it proactively instead of reactively. When the doubts and fears are acknowledged and/or resolved then they can begin to move forward. Circumventing is very short term and rarely works with people who are chronic procrastinators or highly anxious."
Muscalp,fdidryw,t1_fdi8v3r,">There is no ‘subsconcious’ on behavioral therapy.

Granted, yes, but since people generally have an idea of the concept I used the term here.

>If you hate your job, strive for a job change.
>Work hard because you enjoy the work, not because you have to.

Easy to say and a brilliant plan until you realize all jobs have parts that suck and not everyone has a calling they feel drawn to. 

>Circumventing mental blockages is akin to overcoming physical limitations.

One can push themselves mentally just as much as they can physically. But apart from that, yes, obviously you can overcome mental blockages. If a certain way of approaching difficult tasks doesn't work for you, you look for another way to do it. You act like overcoming trauma and phobia is not a thing? 


>And if you have to, then be honest about hating it and why, and why you will do it anyway. 

And that would be my first reply.

Like I said in my first comment, I'm not talking about bullying yourself into achieving your goals. I'm saying that first off OP is just rephrasing the problem, i.e ""How do I trick myself into liking broccoli"" becomes ""How do I make this task more inviting"", which would result in the exact same end. Second, OP's Idea of being kind with yourself will not absolve you of the problem of having to push yourself, which, like OP wrote himself, would have to be addressed by finding a way around your inhibitions."
stringdom,fdincps,t1_fdidryw,"I'm not saying that one can't push oneself to be better, or to overcome a mental block, like a writers block. What I'm saying is that one cannot *circumvent* ourselves from the equation. Pushing just for the sake of pushing .

Just pushing oneself will result in burnout, chronic stress and emotional depletion. Yes, it is truth that no job is perfect and all work requires effort and some level of discomfort. But to suffer for 40 years in a row with nothing to enjoy in a job is unrealistic. It will result in depression and anxiety. That is not a life anyone should want. Your point of view seems to be, just suck it up and push yourself. Which is unhealthy because pushing beyond reason leads to breaking. Even bodybuilders will tell you that muscle grows, not on the workout, but while resting. There's no growing without kindness and no discipline without enjoyment. Why do you do what you do?

Rephrasing the problem might seem trivial for you, but it is the difference between a fulfilling life and mindless suffering for many people. It is the difference between “I should eat broccoli” and “should I eat broccoli and why?” One invites emotional and rational engagement (that just might be what makes you do it), the first one leads to certain failure, judgement and loathing. Because, good news, maybe the answer is “I don't want to and don't have to eat broccoli, I'm happy living with the consequences”. And that is part of becoming a well rounded, mature individual. Maybe you don't have to be the next tech guru. Maybe you don't really want to have the body of an Adonis. Maybe being the next best-seller author is not that important. But first you have to understand yourself to comprehend how far and where to push.

I think that you are too focused on “finding a way around your inhibitions”, which makes no sense to me. It is not always inhibitions, sometimes they are compulsions, sometimes they are self-esteem issues. Sometimes they are external imposed expectations. Sometimes they are self-imposed impossible expectations. There is no technical answer. There's no magic potion, neurolingüistic incantation or guru coach that will solve any discipline problem if the goal is not genuine to the person and built with love rather than self-hatred.

Mindless pushing is self-abuse and will lead to failure, every time."
Muscalp,fdjqhpi,t1_fdincps,"I got the feeling we're talking past each other.


>There's no magic potion, neurolingüistic incantation or guru coach that will solve any discipline problem if the goal is not genuine to the person and built with love rather than self-hatred.

This is what I said in the very beginning, in my first comment. Self-hatred is a lacking motivation for change. All I'm saying is it is a fallacy to believe that just because you have an appropriate motivation, you don't have to push yourself to achieve things. That's exactly why this sub is r/getdisciplined and not r/getmotivated. 

>“I should eat broccoli” and “should I eat broccoli and why?”

That's no longer a rephrasing of the problem, but a deeper question about the relevance of the problem. And that's good, absolutely. But that's neither what I talked about (because I wouldn't; I agree completely with that), nor is it what I critiqued in OP's post.

>But to suffer for 40 years in a row with nothing to enjoy in a job is unrealistic.

No, it is unrealistic to suffer 40 years in a row without nothing to enjoy *in life*. I'd say most people with low paying jobs like retail don't enjoy them; but it's entirely possible to push through that if you have other things in life you enjoy. Of course, if there's a job you think you'd enjoy go for it, that's just not an option for everyone."

Zarradox,fdi5wgu,t3_eld88t,"One thing that has helped me immensely is building for failure, which makes it easier to achieve success. It's not totally related, but I got to this structure when I finally came to the realisation that it is okay to *not* be pushing or punishing myself all the time. 

For example, for me it is time that is constrained and not so much of an issue with procrastination (stressful/involved job, young family, etc). It is not unusual to be fully occupied from the moment of waking up to falling asleep at night. And the snatches of time you *do* have are short (the odd 5 minute breather), or in a location where you can't take advantage of them, or come totally unexpected so you don't have what you need to take advantage.

Last year I wanted to raise my fitness level in three areas - general activity, cardio, strength. Instead of saying, okay Mon, Wed, Sat I run, Tues and Thurs I work on strength, I decided to try and hit one of the three areas daily:

1 - try to run at least $distance

2 - if there's no chunk of time for that, do the short calisthenics routine (15-25 mins which can be carved out by going to bed later.

3 - if I see I the day is a killer and I'll be wiped out, try to hit 12k steps. I'll know by mid-day if this is the case, and can start walking around while on calls at work or whatever to grind out those steps and get moving.

Obviously doing 1 or 2 is a lot better than doing 3, but on 98% of the days I get *one of them* done and it leads to doing 1 and 2 more often than before (almost 6o% more km than 2018!).

This is a narrow example, but it has helped work with the constraints life throws at me, be okay with failure when it happens because I know if I can't even crank out the steps the day has been *really* bad, and get out of the rut of despair."

I want a lot of things. And when I see that I don’t have the things I want, I get sad. Then I listen to some music for instant gratification. It makes me happy temporarily but afterwards I’m back to my previous state. Then I think about my situation again, and go for instant gratification over and over. This cycle never ends. And I’m right now listening to music in order to have fun. That’s what makes me truly happy(though temporarily)in life for now. And I can’t get out of this cycle."

YouveBeanReported,fdhoncn,t3_eld88t,"That's nice. But a lot of us don't know _how_ to treat ourselves nicely. 

We've spent our entire lives as worthless, stupid, lazy, underachieving, struggling to even reach the level of an acceptable human being.

We self motivate by insulting ourselves because that is the only way we understand how. And there is a severe lack of resources to teach that. Which is a damn shame. 

Even CBT therapy just points out your fucking stupid and you should stop being fucking stupid. Not exactly encouraging when you know your already worthless and if you could only be normal people might tolerate your existance.

BeafyBoi,fdj8u19,t3_eld88t,"Good advice, although it's not that easy for me and maybe others as well.

We present our thoughts as questions and statements because it is easier to interpret them that way. But most of the time, I'm not even thinking in questions or statements. Im thinking in mood and outcomes.

Example: I am partially deaf with meniere's so i won't know if i can hear a person talking right next to me in a few hours let alone tomorrow. So when i plan stuff, i usually hope that i can hear well that day. I play our scenarios in my head on what i will do if i can't hear well. These scenarios usually allow for me to do some slight planning. But as life usually goes, it never goes to exact plan. When it doesn't, i feel bad about myself, i don't mentally ask myself any questions or tell myself anything. I know there is nothing I can do about it. But i feel terrible regardless. As im a ""broken human"" in the eyes of normal people. 

That's not a question but rather an embedded idea of myself that triggers during events such as the example i mentioned. Simply telling myself to think of it differently isnt going to change it at least to a useful standpoint as its an embedded idea, or i should say conditioned as i conditioned myself into it during my primary school."

I have worked hard for years to manage crippling depression along with some anxiety that flares up from time to time.

Speaking for myself, I do consider a lot of my coping methods to be a “brain hack” of sorts; different things to coax better or more “normal” function from an otherwise malfunctioning brain. 

Could be that most of us who struggle greatly with things like motivation, food addiction, low energy (inability or extreme difficulty getting up in the morning) etc are struggling with depression or other symptoms of mental illness and are cognizant of the fact that our brains don’t work in the same way as those without these issues. Hence the need to “trick”, “push”, or “fool” ourselves. 

I agree that “punishment” is a concept we should probably do away with, but this might be a semantic thing. I’m guessing most who use that term are really just thinking of accountability. We want to strive for better things and are looking for ways to take responsibility and hold ourselves accountable when we miss the mark. something we’ll remember and that will motivate us to do better next time.

Overall, I’m in complete agreement with your general message. Just wanted to throw in a perspective that might shed some light."
Archeo-Nova,fdjxmxo,t3_eld88t,"This is a very interesting topic to discuss regarding self discipline. I played Rugby for a few years, before I stopped 4 years ago and had the luck to be trained by very different types of coaches. Some tried to get the best out of us players by lifting us up and some, especially one, by being punishing, especially one. He was a high ranking officer in the Army and believed mental pressure gives the best results. But because of him, nearly a whole genereation of players stopped playing, I'm in doubt, how effective his methods were in the end. 

Seeing that you are a coach and certainly more experienced in motivating people than I will ever be, I think you are right. The way we were raised, the way our society works, even a large part of our western culture is defined by overcoming through self punishment, think of christian values etc. So, I agree on what you say,  a change of perspective is needed, in changing ones life in the long run. Despite, I guess, that there are life situations, were one has to be hard to oneself and there is no way around it. I'm speaking of short term crisis situations, like overcoming drug addiction or survival situations like the one showed in the movie ""Touching the Void"", were there is no way to be kind to yourself. Maybe it is also good to be prepared for such situations. What do you think about that?"
brenthuras,fdk06wt,t1_fdjxmxo,"Thanks for the the thoughtful comment!

I'm not sure if I'm convinced that there's any situation where one must be hard on oneself. But it might be a semantic thing.

So for example if a person is in a place where they really need to take action, it would be important to really be firm with ourselves like ""I need to do this thing now"" even if we don't want to. But it can still be done in a loving and respectful way. Again, just like how a parent can direct a child to do something that the child must do.

ALL of that can go without the ""why are you such a piece of shit"" element. Are we on the same page there?"

Can Three Words Turn Anxiety Into Success? 

It’s called “anxiety reappraisal,” and it boils down to telling yourself that you feel excited whenever you feel nervous. It sounds stupidly simple, but it's proven effective in a variety of studies and settings.

It’s also counterintuitive: When most people feel anxious, they likely tell themselves to just relax.

Anxiety and excitement are both aroused emotions. In both, the heart beats faster, cortisol surges, and the body prepares for action. In other words, they’re “arousal congruent.” The only difference is that excitement is a positive emotion‚ focused on all the ways something could go well.

Instead of “Keep Calm and Carry On” instead use the slogan “Get Amped and Don’t Screw Up.”

\- Alison Wood Brooks,  professor at Harvard Business School

AgreeableList,fdwj6gm,t1_fdt0tpt,"The three words from the study were ""I am excited"". They changed it up between the 4 experiments, so sometimes it was phrased as ""get excited"".

Those in the ""excited"" group performed better on tasks than groups that said ""I am anxious"" or ""I am calm"" or were told something neutral. The experiment tasks included singing ""Don't Stop Believin"", giving a speech, or taking a math test.

Subjective anxiety and heart rate were similar across all groups, so the author concludes that it's not the physical feelings that make the difference in performance but how you cope with those feelings. Framing them as excitement appears to help.

Being scared and not reacting with your body by running or fighting is not natural. You're telling your brain ""we have no way to get out of this situation"" and the anxiety gets even worse. Your brain just intensifies all the symptoms in an attempt to make you move. 

Exercise is the greatest anti anxiety medication. Exercise and think about something that makes you anxious and you will notice an increase in performance, run faster, lift heavier, have more stamina, etc. And your brain will get the signal that ""okay we got out of there, maybe the threat isn't really that bad now.  Next time it comes up we're not going to freak out as bad."" 

But if you never confront that negative energy it just lingers and intensifies and your brain will try to revisit it again and again to force you to prepare so you will survive."

SoonhyunBan,eltc38,top_level,"Hi guys. It’s been a while.

Last year, I started a journey to break various bad habits (sleeping late, smoking, no soda) utilizing neuroscience protocols. The data from that social experiment proved the importance of finding a “Trigger”. We know that all habits have specific triggers and replacing/removing them with something positive is the key.

My issue was sleeping late. The trigger was my phone and YouTube. To replace/remove the trigger, I moved the power outlet, charger, and phone to the living room and turned it off. This method was “super effective”.

A friend of mine went through a similar project. Her problem was that she'd take a blunt on her way home after work, at a specific location. Her trigger was a physical location that initiated smoking, so I advised her to use a different path and purchase some vitamin water as a reward. Recently, I haven’t seen her take a puff once.

This trigger protocol worked great, but it was extremely difficult to help hundreds of strangers through advice and YouTube videos. That’s why, as some of you already know, I teamed up with a group of scientists and developers to make a useful tool. Our plan was to create a neuroscience-based habit platform where you can find relatable problems and solutions and apply scientific protocols to break bad habits.

We released an early version and got your feedback. The app had many holes. Many features were lacking. But the data was in. With your help, the devs are now passionately at work, while I’m focusing on brain hacks that you can use in real life.

&#x200B;

Current features:

* Image based card feed interface
* Quickly create Pattern(habit) cards that include: images / journals / *observer* / goals (days, weeks)
* Invite others to observe each Pattern for accountability and sharing
* Gain reward (Neurons) every time you follow through with a report
* Level up by gathering neurons
* Each time you level up, we donate to “Cure Alzheimer's Fund”
* Track your Pattern goals(obviously)
* Neuroscience protocols applied for all of the above features

&#x200B;

Future:

* Discover relatable triggers and solutions of other people to transform your bad habit into healthy ones
* Group habits and solutions for others to participate
* 1 on 1 with behavioral scientists, neuroscientists
* Monetary compensation for helping others
* More types of data (voice memos, gifs, videos)
* Blockchain
* And more... but let’s not turn this into an essay

&#x200B;

No, you don’t need to download the app :)

We really don’t want you to(yet), because we’re still working hard on previous feedbacks.

Would love new ideas though. If you have a cool idea or any questions in mind, please leave a comment or message me. If you want free brain hacks to use in real life and stay in touch with the development, you can subscribe at our [website](https://www.braintingle.io/).

Thanks everyone. Talk to you soon.

ShadowfoxDrow,fdkc8yl,t3_eltc38,"Here's my number one concern with all habit-help-apps.

In order for it to work, you have to use the app consistently. Essentially you have to make a habit of using the app.

For someone who struggles with habit building / breaking, having to make a habit to learn to make habits is a cart before the horse scenario. 

How are you addressing this with your project?"
DieEeneGast,fdkdvxp,t1_fdkc8yl,"Perfectly worded. This is exactly the problem. Nail on the head it’s called right? Well that, nail on the head!

Duolingo tried to tackle this with notifications and emails on set times. But that clearly doesn’t work for the majority. 

But I think building habits isn’t easy, period. And an app can do so much to make it easier, but it can’t force the habit on you."
king_kulcha,fdkes7g,t1_fdkc8yl,Ive thought about this same problem with me for so much time. Thank you for wording it perfectly.
Golgafrinchan_B,fdkffb2,t1_fdkc8yl,"This strikes me as an odd concern

Habits are not a problem by themselves. They are a tool our brains have to automate common behaviors. We say that certain habits are bad when they don't serve to further our long term goals, but often ""breaking them"" just means overwriting that pattern with other habits that are more conductive to getting you to where you want (e.g., I've stopped drinking coffee when I wake up early and replaced that with drinking a cup of water and doing pull ups)

I can see this being a problem if your goal is specifically to avoid use of digital tools in general. But at the end of the day they are tools and there are still digital tools that I have a place for in my life to build awareness (google calendar, todoist) and I can see a well executed app like this becoming one of them :)"
Creepeo,fdlcasn,t1_fdkc8yl,"Make it a paid app. Maybe with fund return on the end where you've done breaking the habit. 
The problem is making people use it. Investing in it. People are also lazy. If it's free - they might use it for a day or two and stop using it. People need to feel invested to start using it. Then you can try and make a habit of it's usage. It needs a system to proof check whether a person has truly changed something. Then you give him back the 10 bucks he paid for. People would need reassurance to start investing themselves in this. Because this should not be an app for people who are strong enough to start change on their own. It should be an app for weak ones. Who need help. And people are complex, the backbone of a system like this should be also complex. I don't think there's an easy solution to this. I've just broken my addiction, of 10 years, to marijuana. and some habits are broken very slowly and hard. There is no easy way to make it. 
Notifications can be ignored, emails also. You need an incentive. An investment from them, that you can reassure to give back."
cheesesmysavior,fdkjn3g,t1_fdkc8yl,I once heard of a person sticking to habit building through a personal threat she set.

Allow me to extrapolate. Our hypothesis is that most people don't ""really want"" to create a new habit. Healthy habits sound good on paper, but do people ""really really"" want them?  And if so, is the habit right for them? We don't think so. So we focused on two things.

1. Help people quickly define ""Bad habits"" / ""Triggers"" / ""Solutions"". We'd help you understand *what and why* of your bad habit, and provide potential solutions to try out. Also, we'd recommend other successful users who had the same ""bad habit"" and similar ""triggers"" and ""solutions"" as you.
2. Make the process social and fun(rewarding). Instead of a loner type apps, we want this to become a social platform where you can come to solve your problem for a month, get reward, and come back later again when you need it.

lucidible,enk8il,top_level,"Perfectionism is a distraction from achieving your goals. It is not merely that it is good in theory but just unrealistic in real life given our limited time and resources. Even with unlimited resources and all the time in the world, perfectionism is irresponsibility cloaked in the guise of accountability.

# Work hard and you will succeed

We are always told we should be doing our best. After all, if we do less than our best and don’t succeed then seemingly we have only ourselves to blame, right? Maybe that last little bit we held back would have made the difference between success and failure?

But what if the issue isn’t that we didn’t do well enough but that we were doing the wrong thing?

By definition doing our best means that we should have a high standard for our work. But the only standard that makes sense to judge an action by is how well it makes progress towards a desired end goal.

Doing something useless perfectly well is not as good as doing something highly useful in a mediocre way. True progress is measured not by seeing how far you’ve gone, but by seeing how far you’ve gone relative to where you need to get to.

Going 10 miles when driving from Miami to Fort Lauderdale is great progress. Going 10 miles when you are driving from Miami to Seattle is nothing. In both cases, those 10 miles may have been perfectly driven but we can only judge their success relative to the end goal.

We fall into the trap of perfectionism when we stop holding ourselves to the high standard of staying on the path towards a greater goal and instead focus on the immediate outcomes of individual actions and decisions.

# Shades of Gray are Scary

The reason we fall into this trap is that the world is uncertain, there are rarely black and white solutions, only shades of grey. The way to achieve our goals is not clear so it’s difficult to be sure that we are measuring progress accurately.

We have no guarantee that the decisions we make are bringing us closer to or farther away from our goal. We have to trust our judgement even knowing that we could be wrong. There is always going to be some uncertainty as to whether a decision we make is the correct one.

When we are children and learning something for the first time, we look to an external standard to decide how well we are doing since we don’t yet have the experience or knowledge to judge that ourselves. But because it is an external fixed standard, it is somewhat artificial.

It’s purpose is to serve as a crutch more than as a reference.

When a child is playing a sport, they follow set plays and fixed techniques. But when a professional plays the same sport, they constantly adjust their actions based on the changing situation. They use their judgement by calling upon both unconscious physical reactions from years of training and intuition based on years of experience.

When we don’t trust our judgement we revert back to this childish desire for clarity. We begin looking to someone else to tell us when we’ve done enough.

# Black and White is an Opiate

The seduction of perfectionism is the comfort of clarity at the expense of a true measure of an action’s worth.

We assume that all quality is the same so the higher quality we achieve, the better it must be. In fact we begin to substitute a focus on the quality of our performance of an individual action for the need of having any goals in the first place.

The action becomes an end in and of itself.

This makes perfectionism a double temptation because it allows you to avoid two stressors. The first from the responsibility of having to use your judgement and the second from having to think about where you are heading, about what you are trying to achieve as the end goal. All this while being able to fool yourself that you are being productive.

But this sense of comfort is fleeting and comes at an increasingly higher price the more we do it. Making a mistake in our judgement becomes more emotionally dangerous because we are attaching our ego to our results since, having lost sight of a higher goal, our immediate results are all we have.

Making a mistake means that we are somehow lesser as a person which makes us even more fearful of mistakes and dependent on that artificial external standard. We enter a downward spiral of self-doubt and reactive decisions, all the while reassuring ourselves that we are on track because we are perfectly executing those short-sighted actions.

Perfectionism is not about the nobility of high standards, it is the cowardice of seeking safety, the safety of saying to yourself that you followed all the rules, so its not your fault.

It’s the ultimate check the box exercise. It is like operating your car with your eyes fixed on the speedometer, perfectly keeping to the speed limit as you drive off a cliff.

# Accept Uncertainty

Instead of focusing on the immediate results we need to be comfortable with uncertainty. Which is another way of saying we must be brave.

We need to engage with reality by continually using our judgement to decide what the right course of action is at any one time and adjust that course as the situation changes instead of being overly concerned about the outcome of any one decision or action.

To go back to the car analogy, when we drive down the highway we continually adapt our position and speed to the situation on the road. We don’t collapse into self-loathing when we exceed the speed limit, we just calmly slow down a bit. We don’t panic when we encounter construction, we just move over.

The idea is not to put too much emphasis on perfecting any individual action or decision but instead strive for progress towards your end goal by focusing on the overall process.

A process that has high standards but not fixed standards. A process that acknowledges that the world is fluid and probabilistic not rigid and deterministic. A process consisting of reasonable decisions leading to actions with good enough results.

By doing this we detach our egos from our results. We are more able to accept the discomfort that comes with making mistakes. Treating them as information about the course we are actually on relative to the path we need to be on and not information about the value we have as people.

We owe it to ourselves to accept the messiness of reality and be courageous in the face of our self-doubt. Enlightened perseverance not blind perfectionism is the way to succeed."

neurofortune,fe0s1fb,t3_enk8il,"This is so true tbh, clinging to the so-called innate 'quality' of an action without reference to whether its trajectory matches up to the desired destination. 

You're right. For me (in the past), it wasn't about wanting to reach a certain destination (through my actions), it was moreso about the feeling of *relief* after ticking off as many boxes on a tasklist as possible. 

Thus, after every action/task, I'd feel relieved/proud not because it got me any closer to a defined destination, but because I felt I wasn't 'wasting my time' or dilly-dallying. That I was 'on the grind', so to speak. That if I made any sort of effort, then this would absolve me of the possibility of 'failure' (whatever that means). 

But the thing is that once you have your destination in mind, you can use both 1) the feeling of progression (towards it) and 2) the satisfaction of exertion, to both feel good about making an effort + to know that your efforts are actually effective and meaningful. 

I guess it follows that the next step would be to *define* your destination(s). Which, actually, I might go and do right now (for all the arenas of my life).

He is very risk averse and almost never leaves his comfort zone. Hell, he even dislikes using new words, opting instead to always repeat the same phrases and idioms.

Yet, he seems to be doing well and advancing in his career. He never takes any risks and does not put himself out there but seems to be advancing well enough, especially in relation to me.

To some extent, I'm in the same boat as your colleague. It's a gradual progress but it's less likely to be an exponential progress.  


Thinks of it this way.

\- would you rather do 3 things and try to make them really well? Lower chances of picking the right thing to do but higher chances of doing it right.

\- OR would you rather do 10 things and try to make each one good enough? Higher chances of picking the right thing to do but lower chances of doing it right.

Just a little clarification. I'm not from the US and our culture is a bit different from the ""go-getter"" culture of the US. Our culture loves to theorize and criticize and we're scared of making decisions because the fear of failure is very strong. All in all, this creates a culture where not much gets done, and where maintaining the status quo is paramount due to the fear of ridicule and criticism.

I do have to admit that my co-worker is a smart, competent guy. I cannot take that away from him. We're actually in the same department and collaborate on the majority of projects. It's just that I have this ""doer"" mentality that's a lot closer to the US mentality than our native ""thinker"" mentality. This might explain some of his tendencies. However, he is definitely a perfectionist because he'll spend 15 minutes adjusting line spacing in a simple, quick update e-mail to the rest of the team. This drives me crazy.

But you're right, he his very predictable and consistent. His perfectionism has been noticed by the higher-ups but so far has not caused any major problems (projects and deliverables being late) and that's why I believe it has not been directly addressed. I also tend to speed him up if we're working together on something. There were a few instances where he tried to discourage me from taking action because he thought it was impossible. I went and did it anyway and was successful. This, however, tends to be forgotten, and he is very smart not mention those instances where he was wrong and passive.

All in all, it's a very nuanced topic. I will most definitely take to heart your questions and try to work through them. For now, I'm trying to work on myself and not be paralyzed by fear as I believe only through experience and doing can we get better. I do not like our culture of just sitting around and maintaining the status quo, I like going out and doing things even if it makes me fail. It's just that his way of doing things so far has also been successful and he has advanced at an almost equal rate and that got me thinking.

Bottom line is that, he has a very fixed mindset while I always try to improve and advance my career, yet I have not gone any further than him. I might just be impatient though :D"

TheExecuted,fe39lhg,t3_enk8il,"In my opinion, people don’t necessarily strive for perfectionism because they’re trying to be perfect; rather, they know it is the best way to push themselves and to be as successful as possible in the way they want"
lucidible,fe685hp,t1_fe39lhg,"This is the difference between using perfection as a guide vs using it as a goal.  The former is about finding an aiming point but still using your judgement as to when you are close enough for what you need to achieve your ultimate goal.  You don't actually have to match the perfect standard perfectly.  The latter is winning the battle but potentially losing the war

MGoDuPage,fe5aqny,t3_enk8il,"Excellent post. 

I’ve found that for me, perfectionism is a method of avoidance. 

Specifically, it’s a way for me to fool myself into thinking that I’m being productive when in reality, it’s usually being used as an excuse to NOT do some other critical steps that I know will inevitably follow for which I am terrified to do. 

Example:  I am a MASTER at drafting detailed & comprehensive business plans, marketing plans, etc for my small business. But the reason I linger on those tasks isn’t because I am truly perfect at everything. The reason I burn so much time on those projects & produce something FAR beyond what’s reasonably necessary is because I’m terrified of what comes next. Namely, my own professional ego is on the line & the risk of rejection/failure once it comes time to go out and EXECUTE the aforesaid business plan, business development strategy, etc. 

I won’t ever get rejected if I’m never out in the real world risking a “no”. And as long as I am safely behind my desk perfecting the most unbelievable business development plan ever created, then I can convince myself & others that I am industrious & virtuous, WITHOUT ever doing the stuff I’m actually terrified to do."

Sota612,fe31cv1,t3_enk8il,Thanks for the post. It is a great reminder to step back and see the bigger picture. I have been thinking on this as I’ve recently taken on some home remodeling projects and they can become overwhelming. Keep making progress and don’t get lost in the details. Good luck to you!
lucidible,fe6b5t0,t1_fe31cv1,"Wow, home remodeling.  I renovated a former house and it too three years.

  Did all the framing and electrical myself but my advice to you is hire people for the finish work.  I had these drywallers come in and do more in 3 days than I know I could have accomplished in a year.  That's actually a great example of ""good enough"" being good enough.  A lot of mistakes are really not that big of a deal and unnoticeable once you drywall if you do that right.   Good luck!

impossiblefudgeratio,fe4yqgh,t3_enk8il,"Sometimes perfectionism also includes the inability to prioritize and discard ideas/tasks. Personally, with some projects for school, I know that I will get a B or C if hand in mediocre work, as long as it is finished. But sometimes I get so attached to my vision of the result that I want to put in a whole bunch of additional stuff that isn’t really necessary. 


For example, in art I’ll have an assignment where I’m required to include one figure, I’ll come up with a composition that has 4 figures and wont even question whether to include all 4. I will just do it, because I’ve fallen in love with my idea. But due to the extra time this requires I will struggle or even fail to meet the deadline. 


It’s often necessary to take a step back and re-evaluate which steps of a plan are actually necessary to reach a goal, and which can be skipped. 


Since I haven’t had a lot of practice with discarding things and saying no to things, I think it could be a good exercise to try doing the Marie Kondo method. When you throw a lot of things away, you practice saying “no I don’t need this”. Hopefully this can also be transferred to projects and removing pullet points from my to do list. 

(sorry if the future form is weird, English isn’t my first language)"
lucidible,fe6ahom,t1_fe4yqgh,"So while what you say is certainly practical for getting the grade, to a certain extent your grades don't matter as much as you think.  That excitement you feel could lead you to success beyond the actual course if you think outside the box.  For example, it is not unlikely that your professor is teaching that subject because they really enjoy it themselves.  So while you are correct that you should probably try and tame your excitement enough so you can actually turn in the assignment, it may also be a good idea to talk to your professor and tell/show him the other thoughts you have which may not fit in the space of the assignment.   I'm sure at the very least he will feel very gratified that you are getting so much out of the course but it could also be that he could give you some advice or even a special project that will allow you free reign for your ideas.   Good luck!"

Anyway, thanks you so much for posting this. It got to be one the most insightful post I have ever read on reddit. I'm printing it, so that I can read it daily. Perfectionism is most of the time a behavior taught by parents who do not understand that by having unrealistic expectations, they are teaching their kids to not try anything unless they have total control of the situation at hand, which is impossible. The end results are adults who are prisoners of an utmost toxic way of thinking that leave them miserable, full of doubt, anxious, unhappy, and underachiever."

polygamous_poliwag,fe6qfne,t3_enk8il,"This is really great and something I dearly need to understand, thank you! If you can help me further - what do you make of the idea that slowing down and taking time to try to be more perfect actually speeds one up long-term (presumably because you diminish: taking shortcuts, creating messy loose-ends, risking harm or regress, introducing obstacles that make your path harder, the possibility of failing to seize the full benefit of a unique opportunity, etc.)?

That thought is something I think I often use to comfort myself when I'm being a perfectionist... sort of the idea that while *that guy* is building his tower quickly and it may be taller than mine right now, I'm building mine to be *stable* and he might have made a mistake that causes his to collapse or that causes growth to slow down later because maybe his foundations weren't sound, or that when an earthquake comes his won't be strong enough, etc."
lucidible,fe9cv5x,t1_fe6qfne,"It's good to have high standards but the point is not to make the high standards arbitrary.  A perfectionist gets nervous when even something minor is not done well but not being a perfectionist doesn't mean that you do everything poorly.   It means you do things as good as they need to be so that some things are done nearly perfectly and other things are done imperfectly but good enough.

In your building example, not taking shortcuts and having high standards is in service of the goal of building that tower more stable.  If each floor is built at a slight slope then as you add levels the tower will lean.   But if a certain floor is built slightly out of square you can correct that in the next floor and cover the imperfection when you put the outer shell on.   So you need to get each floor perfectly level but you don't have to get each floor perfectly square."
iLearn4ever,fecsbul,t3_enk8il,"Thank you for this writeup. It made me realise a lot of my mistakes. I often tend to do things in 2-3x the amount of time. Call it the perils of being self-employed (and thus not having any deadlines whatsoever).

And this perfectionism has creeped into every aspect of my life. Recently a friend casually said that I have OCD. That got me thinking and I realised maybe that's true. I tend to keep things in fixed places and get bothered a lot if they are not in those places. (On the plus side, I hardly ever have to look for anything, and can do a lot of tasks on auto-pilot)."
aznology,em4up8,top_level,"Lately, like for the past year or so, after I come home from work and the weekends I find myself watching Youtube, like alot of YouTube like I just clocked in 3 hours today, and usually clock in 6 hours on weekends. I keep it pretty educational, mostly about investments and RealEstate stuff. But I find it that it's becoming hindering to my happiness and well productivity.

I'm on Android and can't uninstall it, I put a digital timer on it too but I end up disabling it. Anyone have some suggestions?"
Thoughtfuhl,fdmcvcd,t3_em4up8,"I have this problem too. what worked for me was turning notifications off, moving the YouTube app to a place on my phone where it isn’t visible and easily accessible, and “cleansing” my feed by unsubscribing and mass-clicking on videos that were helpful/ didn’t interest me so YT mainly recommended those videos.

Funnily enough, I’m doing the same to Reddit. I’m only sticking to custom feeds with a select few of non-demanding non-time consuming helpful subreddits such as this one"

gerleden,fdmvrvq,t1_fdmuofz,"Every sub can somehow be helpful base on what's going on in your life. What you need to do is unsubscribe from the one with too much activity / distraction that prevent you to take action while keeping the ones that helps and/or inspire you.

One thing you can do for that is switch your subscriptions from general to more specialized subs : they'll have less activity and a more specific one to your needs. You can use custom feeds too, one for work, one work-related (inspiration, this sub, more general topics) and one for chill.

But even with this seeds, I believe some are not healthy if you want to be productive. I personnaly love AskReddit/Men/Women/OffMyChest and subs like that but they are really to much time consuming. So I didn't subscribed to any of them and I just go there once in a while when I really have nothing better to do (bored at work, waiting for something while not having the nergy for a book, etc.)."

I had this problem with podcasts, overwhelmed by the number that were being downloaded on my phone. My brother gave me a great idea, turn off auto download.

neurofortune,fdmh5dh,t3_em4up8,"hi- I was in a similar quandary before- but I find that digital timers/app restrictions are supposed to work hand in hand with having a strong sense of what you'd ideally like to do in that time instead. for example- if you imagined that your next weekend was the last one ever, how would you choose to spend it? even if it's not sustainable eg. fancy dinners/chilling at the beach- maybe you can cultivate a strong intention to do a 'lite' version of one of these activities, in this case, being cooking a fancy meal/going to a nature reserve. 

As you do find that it still has value to you- how about halving the time you spend on YouTube- but instead of spending it passively like before, how about actually setting out to consume it *intentionally*? what I mean by this is that currently, your usage seems 'passive' in the sense that you sort of let loose after work, find yourself opening YouTube, and then end up in a state of vague guilt/unease about 3 hours later. Intentional consumption goes along the lines of saying to yourself 'right! I've worked hard today- so I'm going to make myself a drink, get dressed in something comfortable, set a timer, dim the lights, and watch some YouTube for the full span of these next 1.5 hours.' You might be sick of it by the time the timer goes off, or you still might want to watch more, but that's okay, since no matter what, you're cultivating a habit of intention + allowing yourself to *enjoy* something that you value (in terms of relaxation, entertainment, education, or all 3 !).

hope this helps x"
Pixel-1606,fdmq06h,t1_fdmh5dh,"This is good advice, it's very hard to quit one habit without planning an alternative that you want to follow the cue that triggers your bad habit (in this case coming home from work or waking up on a day off)  


Seeing as you (OP) said you mainly watch educational stuff anyway, maybe set out to learn something specific and actually take some notes or make a small summary of the videos you watch. That way the activity becomes more usefull/intentional and you're less likely to want to do it for hours."
LimeLoop,fdmqptb,t3_em4up8,Find a offline hobby that excites you. Literally the best way to cut 90% of YouTube time and live life instead. 10% have to stay for YT videos about your new hobby though 😉
ha1468,fdmz92e,t3_em4up8,"I had this exact problem. I turned to youtube at almost any point that I had some free time. It was getting to the point where I was worried that there might not be a huge amount of content left for me on youtube that I was interested in! I can't tell you the number of times I deleted youtube from my phone only to reinstall it.

This year I've spent some time clarifying my goals for the years, in very specific terms. Things like I want read a book a week, go to the gym or do exercise 4 times a week. Before I did this, is pent a HUGE amount of time trying to clarify exactly who I wanted to be, and what I wanted to accomplish more generally.

Almost overnight my youtube habit has gone away, as now I have a specific structure for what I do with my time off. For example, today I start work at 2pm. Last year I almost certainly would have spent the morning laying around, watching Netflix or youtube, and accomplishing not much. But now, I have a really clear structure of what I need to get done in the week - and it gave me the motivation to get out of bed, hit the gym, read some of this weeks book, and generally a lot better about myself.

TheWolfAndRaven,fdmpre0,t3_em4up8,"Consider tying it to a productive activity. 

Say you can watch youtube but only while you're cleaning or working out. 

Another option could be to pomodoro it. Give yourself that time to watch, but then when the buzzer rings you have to shut it off and go do something for the break. You can come back to it if you want to, but I feel like if you get up and start something else you won't come right back to it."
EscapingThePeguyLife,fdmpnq6,t3_em4up8,"Its probably not youtube, if you delete it you will find something similar to escape with. This is not normal laziness, it’s probably dissociating from difficult feelings. Be honest with yourself, do you have any childhood trauma or something that makes you unhappy? Dig deep because the root is not in the app but totally somewhere else. Maybe even seek a therapist. I used to do this all the time, I felt so much shame because I though I lacked self control and was lazy, now I realized that I have CTPSD and used youtube to numb my emotional flashbacks."
Pixel-1606,fdmqi06,t1_fdmpnq6,"It doesn't have to be trauma, but ""lazyness"" is very rarely just that, often it has to do with some underlying issues and it can never hurt to reflect on what that may be (with or without therapy). Difficulty with executive functioning (being able to DO what you intend) is a symptom showing up in a lot of mental disorders, many of which are on a spectrum (like autism and ADHD) meaning that, even if you don't qualify for a full diagnosis you could still have similar issues in some areas.

kittycard,fdmr02w,t3_em4up8,"My advice is to do a bit of both: don’t deprive yourself from it completely, but also don’t waste as much time. Solution? Try setting an alarm and allot yourself a certain amount of time to go on YouTube, then when it’s up, go to do whatever it is you meant to. Personally, resisting temptation can sometimes make it worse, but only give yourself a set amount of time to let yourself do it can help give you a sense of control. Hope this helps!"
samsam0000,fdmrpqt,t3_em4up8,What's the trigger bro? For me I find after meditating I was playing on my phone which could easily loose me up to an hour of time.

MonoInquisidoro,fdmv8it,t3_em4up8,It's a small thing but have you turned autoplay off? By forcing you to choose to continue after every video you have more opportunities to stop.
krazyking,fdn7is9,t3_em4up8,"What you need to start doing is ""Use social media with intention"". What I mean by that is using Youtube, Twitter and IG is great but you need to make sure that before you get on, you say ""Im going to use Youtube for 15 minutes of entertainment to relax and then get back to my goals"". Its easy to use social media endlessly when you dont have a good primary goal in life like ""pass my next exam, get in better shape, learn a new skill"" because otherwise you dont have a target to aim at .  


Set a goal!"
race-hearse,fdn4w4z,t3_em4up8,I think abstinence sucks. I think a better approach is to plan what you'd rather actually be doing and do that. Youtube will be there for you afterwards so you don't have to feel like something is missing from your life.

I need to pinch in the home screen to make certain apps appear, and I can put a password on them as well.

It may not keep you from using it, but I find I really do forget about my secret apps sometimes because they're not on my home screen. And having those extra steps to get there might keep you from wandering without realizing it! With apps I was a little more addicted to sometimes, I did realize that sometimes I'd close them and immediately open them again out of habit.

So now my counter says reddit 4 and youtube 3 meaning 35 push ups in total. I try to do as many as I can at once.

The point is to make it a bit hard to keep up with the push ups by lowering the time limit.

Start off with a more comfortable time limit and lower it gradually until you find it challenging to keep up with. For me personally it has successfully brought down my usage of these two apps by about 30%."
finnishblood,fdn8yr4,t3_em4up8,"I'm in the same boat. I literally just checked my watch time for the past 7 days (on the app, click on your account in the upper right corner, and then time watched) and I'm at 33hrs.... although, I normally have youtube on in the background as I fall asleep (eventually the vids stop autoplaying and my phone turns off). I'd say I watch 50% educational content, 20% cooking (even though I dont cook much), 20% gaming, 10% miscellaneous.

I took one of the suggestions in this thread and turned off autoplay. After I go through my subscription feed, I find myself going to my home page and finding a video that seems interesting and then just let things autoplay. I probably only 'actively' watch YouTube for 1.5-3hrs a day max, and if I log more than that it's because I have it on in the background whenever I'm not at work or doing something else.

Here are some things I know keep me off YouTube:

Being out of my home, or just being with other people! 

Personally, I love music, and love going to concerts. I probably go to 2-3 concerts a month (I'm going to one tonight and one tomorrow). Tuesday nights there is a bar & grill that has Trivia that I go to with a group of friends. Since it sounds like your youtube content sounds similar to mine, I bet you'd enjoy doing trivia. Search around for restaurants that host free trivia nights, I know I could probably go to trivia every night if I wanted to.

I also dont watch youtube when I'm driving or shopping. Again, just not being at home.

More generally, just hanging out with other people. I have a workout buddy that I try to go running with a few times a week. I have group chats for different activities (disc golfing, trivia, concerts, work). I actively ask friends to hang out, even if we would just be staying in and watching a movie or playing video games. If I'm free, I try my best to join things my coworkers invite me too.

I find that after I do these things, I definitely like decompressing by watching youtube or Netflix, but I do it actively and dont feel guilty about it.

However, a lot of these activities can't be done every day, so I still have 3-4 days a week where I'm just at home and end up watching YouTube. I've just been trying to find more hobbies or activities that I enjoy and make me feel more productive and fulfilled."

If you want to get notified, use the option of showing them silently.
Identify the time period in which you are mostly vulnerable to pick up the phone and start watching YouTube. Switch off the phone during that time and start to do an interesting job - like reading - and once you are hooked into that, switch on the phone and keep it in silent mode, so that you won't miss any emergency calls.

Anyway, he has a real common sense point about a situation like yours. Schedule something to do, like a productive habit. Then your bad habit gets replaces with a good one -- or something like that. 

For example, you might want to develop an exercise habit. Then you can schedule in some exercise after work. Say, after work on M, W, and F I will work out using x program at y gym. Then fill in the other days with some other habit. For example, every Tuesday after work, I will do my grocery shopping and laundry. Then maybe Thursday you can reward yourself with a nice 2-3 hour YT session. Then Friday you can schedule in social time, going out or whatever. Same with the weekends. Have something to do.

jones-macallan,en6rtg,top_level,"As an engineer, I felt stuck countless times during project development. Whatever your profession is, you might have experienced this feeling yourself, I bet.

Regardless if it is work-related or in a personal endeavour, you usually start projects very enthusiastically.

However, when a specific task feels too overwhelming, you tend to lose focus, procrastinate, and sometimes even question your very decision of pursuing a career in your current field.

I want to share with you a simple way that will greatly help you overcome technically-challenging tasks.

Whether you are writing the lyrics of your next song, drafting a business plan, or developing software, applying this method will help you finish your most complicated tasks.

I call this method: *Elementary Task In Progress* (ETIP).

What do I mean by elementary? By definition, an elementary task is a very simple and basic task that is hardly broken down into smaller, easier steps.

***The task in progress should always be elementary so that its execution is straightforward.***

Let me clarify this further by asking you a question: “What is the most basic step you can do to get closer to finishing your complicated task?”

Identify that step. Turn it into a task on its own. Work on it. That’s your ETIP.

If you are stuck in your project because the task in progress is too complicated, chances are, your task is *not* an ETIP. Turn it into an ETIP by applying the following steps:

* Break the task in progress into simpler, more basic steps.
* For each individual step, break it up even further until it is in its most elementary form. This is your ETIP.
* Pick the first ETIP and start working on it.
* Once done with your first ETIP, move to the next one.

***Never*** ***work on a task that is not an ETIP!***

Remember, the task in progress should always be so elementary that its execution is straightforward.

Do you feel that your next task is too complicated? Time to break it down into ETIPs.

Use the ETIP method every time a task feels too overwhelming. Break your task into basic and simple steps that you can execute easily.

While it is almost unavoidable that you will encounter challenging and complex projects that are made up of complicated tasks, you should not work on a task unless you make sure its completion is simple.

The ETIP method will help you to always progress in completing your projects no matter how big the challenges you are faced with.

I hope this advice will be helpful to you. Let me know your thoughts in the comment section."

Instead of thinking “I should write this paper and do that project” just aim to work for 30 mins or so.

Just saying; “oh well, let’s just start working and after 30 min I’ll take a break (Pomodoro technique) is a great way to get things done."

raphci0,fdz4v4u,t3_en6rtg,"For those who may be interested in further exploring OP's methods, I advise searching for Kaizen philosophy. It's exactly what OP is kind of trying to say, but this is well known philosophy and is used by a lot of people, from the top businesses and heads around the world to your neighbor or colleague next door.

It uses the basic question: what is the simplest step to take towards achieving my goal?

Let's say you want to be healthy. That could mean a lot of things, from dropping your bad habits, changing your diet, or going to gym. You break everything down and take steps from there. So let's take the gym - you might start thinking:
""Ok, I need a membership, a gym that is close by, maybe next to my work or next to my house, do I need a 3 day pass or pay monthly, I need to buy a bag for my gym clothing, oh I don't have any, I need to buy a shirt, many shirts, and shoes, need a nice bottle that has a nice handle, and headphones too, bluetooth of course because my current ones are crappy, plus that thing on my hand so I can keep my phone in"" and so and so on.

You see what the problem is? You're overthinking everything. No, you don't need any of that what's listed above. You need to take the smallest step to start to become healthy. Something that won't cost you a penny and will not be a headache to organize - everything because of a little light in your head that alarms your brain ""danger danger I'm coming out of my comfort zone"". In order to not to alert your brain you must start small. 

So what would be a good start here? Well, literally just leaving the house for a walk. Not for 1h. Not for 30mins. Not for 10mins. Do 5 or less. But the next day add one minute extra to your walk. And repeat. Start with and add more as you wish, but the basic principle is to not alert the brain that your habits change. By doing that you create new habit without removing the old ones.

""Well that's dumb, I'm not becoming healthy"". You are. Rome wasn't built in a day, and so won't your habit of becoming better at something. By repeating and slowly increasing the steps you take you allow yourself to grow and achieve things. And you can apply this to everything - dropping sugar, smoking less, learning a new language (three words a day is 21 words in a week, and over 500 a year!), and much more.

Kaizen. Your new key to life."

The process and patience. Without moving gets executed effectively. You just end up in the vicious cycle of starting and starting again and never completing.

liquid_sd,ent3xx,top_level,"I am what i consider a passive person, i like information thrown at me and me sitting and enjoying it, doesn't require a lot of effort and with internet this thing is unstoppable. Take for example watching tv, YouTube, listening to music, listening to someone talking etc.
But i don't want that, not anymore, i feel like i am losing so much out of life but at the same time i feel overwhelmed to make any difference in my routine. By active life i mean the exact opposite, making music, talking to someone, doing something etc. Things that require energy to do them"
BlakeWritesBlog,fe5nd2n,t3_ent3xx,"How easy do you make it for yourself to receive stimuli from the devices that encourage you to be passive? 

For example, do you sleep with your phone by the bed and check it first thing in the morning? One thing I've found is that if I use my phone for my alarm clock, when I wake up in the morning and turn off my alarm, it's second nature to then stay in bed, click over to Reddit, then Twitter, then YouTube. Suddenly, I have YouTube videos on in the background ALL DAY, even while I'm working. It's incredibly distracting and kills my productivity. 

When I noticed this trend, I asked myself what would happen if I didn't start my day by checking my phone. I went to Goodwill and bought a second-hand alarm clock and put it in my room on the opposite side of the room from my bed. I then took my cell phone and put it on the charger at the farthest point in my house from my room. Now, when my alarm goes off, I have to get out of bed to turn it off and I can't just stay in bed in check my phone. By removing that starting point, it's so much easier to just not go to YouTube and listen to videos all day while I'm working. 

Once I got in a habit of not checking my phone first thing in the morning, I decided to build another good habit into my morning. If starting by watching YouTube set me on a non-productive path, I figured that starting by journaling could do the opposite. So that's what I incorporated. I now get up, brush my teeth, hydrate, and journal all before taking a shower and getting dressed for work. Doing so puts me in a productive mind space and prepares me to be active and focused for the rest of the day."
Theendisnearornot,fe5oc3q,t1_fe5nd2n,Too funny - I did the same thing! I set my goal to charge my phone on the kitchen and purchase an actual alarm clock (I got one of those light up ones because I’ve wanted one for forever).  It’s totally changed my mornings.

You've probably heard this a million times before, but you need to find out the root cause of these bad habits. Mine was(and still is) depression. But since I started working on solving my root cause, all these problems you mentioned are starting to disappear.

In my late twenties I feel like I've made much more self improvement progress than all those years before.

Trying to delete your social media, or getting more disciplined before you solve the root cause is just like trying to hide the problem under a rug and you'll sooner or later relapse (at least in my experience).

Don't get me wrong those are effective measures and I was able to start using them successfully only after I started working on the root cause.

All in all, I wish you success in getting more disciplined."
BrainPicker3,fe7e32w,t1_fe6c49h,"What was a game changer for me was setting tiny tiny family goals that are almost impossible to fail with a bit if effort. Originally i had ""play 30 minutes of guitar a day"" but it would feel like too much time/effort and I'd procrastinate it off and simply not do it. When I switched my goal to ""play 5 minutes a day"" I began playing every day and have improved quite a bit. 

Also it helped to say it's ok to have only 1 small manageable goal go focus on at a time. After I get that down for a few weeks I can incorporate something new and small again. And keep building.

If something happens and your routine gets messed up, it's ok to drop and go back down and pick up the small individual habits to start the process over. The process is what promotes growth

The things you do everyday will define your life. Plan to make music for say 90 minutes on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, it should be a goal that you know you have the willpower to achieve. Slowly add in more activities in the same manner until reality matches the life you want to live.

The last one however, is harder. I unfortunately do not have an answer other than just doing something in the moment. Using motivation to your advantage and boring yourself out. Like if you dont allow yourself youtube and such, then the only thing left to do is working out, making music, reading up on things.

I'm naturally very lazy but I invariably will feel very off and bleh about my life when I do nothing for too long. I'm more proactive when I keep these questions in mind. I hate exercising, but my vanity is strong enough for me to want to look good enough to push myself to exercise (and the physical/emotional benefits are the best reward honestly). I like looking at beautiful things so I clean my room and find things to add to it that will encourage me to be organized and tidy. I want to be good at creative endeavors, so, in the case of writing, I try to write a little bit, or brainstorm about story concepts or characters, or read some books/articles/personal essays and take notes about techniques I want to replicate. It sounds like a lot, but the effort begins with you thinking about it. The more your mind is thinking about ways to improve and be active, the more you will find yourself naturally doing them.

2. Meditation: my post creative and proactive thoughts have occured post meditation. This is because it has taught me how to be less reactive and thus given space for my original ideas and intentions to surface. Highly recommend this.
3. Write down your priorities and each day go to that note, and think ""what can I do to further this priority?"" And then write down what comes to mind even if you cant do it right away, and focus on doing it."

They are not cerebral about it, if you look at the big picture or how much effort it’s going to take you can get stymied. I feel you are selling yourself short. “Active” is not inherently better than “passive”. They are part of the same process. In a way you are asking “how to be creative” and the answer can be this: use your consumed media as fuel, if you like something you watch, or you think you can do better, then try it!

The imperative to Do The Thing at the end of the countdown is so ingrained that you have difficulty disobeying it.  Used it just this morning after smacking snooze on the alarm, and got up on time despite it being dark and rainy.  

A day's success is a series of small moments succeeding.  Those moments can build on one another.  Me getting up on time meant I got to work 15 minutes early.

This has helped me to focus on what is important and to gradually add in my hobbies which I find fulfilling, but can be a bit taxing at times so I need to pace myself. Been learning a lot of pacing.

I don't know how I will use it once I have a much longer list of tasks but I think I might do one of a few things:

* Use the chalkboard as a chore list
* Use it for an inspirational quote
* Use it for a habit tracker
* Use it to track block hours (such as, 1 hour of chores, 30 minutes of reading, etc).

In psychology there is something called the cycle of change. Many people who consume motivational material online are in the Precontemplation, Contemplation or Preparation stages - and thus not yet ready to take action, but know in some sense that's where they want to move towards. In the Precontemplation stage change feels unnecessary, but there is a nagging doubt. That doubt should be investigated and examined, and if significant, amplified. Contemplation is the place where it's maybe worth doing, but not a strong inclination. In this stage, explore the positive and negative outcomes/futures. In Preparation, there is a desire to act, but uncertainty as to how - explore strategies.

Thus, people out here looking for that spark are actually doing what they need, but don't know exactly where to start."

Religions tend to get one thing right, and that's the consensus of inherent suffering in life. There's no way around it. We die, everyone we love dies, it hurts, and it's over quicker than we can consider why. It doesn't make sense, but that's totally okay. Nothing in the universe matters, but humans have the ability to give life meaning, and thus, live a life according to their own means. In fact, the [absurdity of this can and should inspire you to live a truly free life.](https://youtu.be/w7EBDF_Ixjg)

Part two. Suffering makes you grow like a motherfucker. Please relish in this. It's evolution. Things that are difficult, like working out, push you to grow in a variety of aspects. Give your suffering meaning by understanding this challenge you are facing is going to be the thing that pushes you forward to grow as a person. When you find the strength to push through this challenge, you'll find a feeling of warmth, comfort, and satisfaction in your belly like no other.

Don't be scared of suffering - embrace it.

Life is at times painful but there is no need for suffering."
Hynjia,fdq7kw6,t1_fdq730u,Uhh suffering doesn't mean just pain and anguish. Feelings of inadequacy constitute suffering too. Or the desire to have something you don't. And other things that constrain people in some way and prevent them from living fully.
1nfinitezer0,fdqp5tt,t1_fdq730u,"People have a negative reaction to the term suffering because it sounds so dramatic. Words have not always meant the same thing, and translations of different versions have varied over time.

A much more approachable translation of the Buddhist ""suffering"" (=dukkha) is Unsatisfactoriness. I use this as an example because it's the tradition that I'm most familiar with, and places a lot of focus on suffering. 

Unsatisfactoriness basically means: There's always something better. No matter the happening, good or bad, it is easy and possible to conceive of a way it can be improved. We idealize things in symbols, and reality is complex and layered, so it can never touch these perfected representations. When we measure the difference between what is and what could be, we see it as lacking, and it creates suffering. If you look for it, everything can be unsatisfactory in this way. Anything. And we are primed instinctually to look for inadequacies in order to survive. But, you can also measure yourself from a different perspective, one of gratitude and appreciation. It is our perspective that reinforces the suffering. Sometimes that is useful, sometimes it is painful, other times it is annoying. With meditative experience you can look at the suffering as those moments of inadequacy appear and choose what to do about them without following the instinctual emotional spiral."

At first, nihilism seemed like an easy answer to write off attaining happiness. How can someone be happy in a meaningless universe? It actually made me very sad for a bit. Starting to question nihilism more in-depth led me to [optimistic nihilism](http://www.openculture.com/2017/10/the-philosophy-of-optimistic-nihilism-or-how-to-find-purpose-in-a-meaningless-universe.html), and that gave me the power and confidence to have an honest conversation with myself about what I truly want to try and get done in my short time here."

I don't really subscribe to anyone philosophical system I like to piece together bits and pieces from different systems but I will say that the general existentialist claim that we are free to create our own value and meaning, is the most important thing to come out of existentialism. 

The whole notion that ""nothing matters"" is really an absurd claim. According to who? I'm sure your life matters to you, I know my life matters to me. I know the suffering of children matters. I know the planet Earth matters, at least it matters to me. I am FREE to create my own meaning - it doesn't have to be given to me by a supreme being.

I can see how talking about these scary issues in a healthy way, like we are right now, can help treat the root of some deep-seated anxiety and depression conditions.

I do think that maybe ""nothing matters"" is an absurd claim, but it can hold truth depending what lens you look with.

I'm all for humans creating their own meaning in any conceivable way (as long as it doesn't hurt others unreasonably). Our consciousness gives us the ability to think freely to some degree, so in a way, crafting our own meaning and purpose, like easing the pain of others and educating children, is the ultimate fuck you to existing in a meaningless universe.

I'm going to make a lot of assumptions here so my apologies if I'm terribly off the mark. For example, let's say you start thinking negative thoughts about your grades. It probably won't help much to tell yourself ""my grades will get better"". This is positive but kind of leaning to blind optimism, since there is no guarantee it will happen. Instead, try a statement that has more truth to it like ""I am putting in a lot of hard work to improve my grades"".

Do more of the things that make you feel mentally healthy (consistent sleep, better diet, time outdoors, socialization, dedicated downtimes, etc) and work on cutting out those that make you feel mentally drained (negative people, bad habits, negative thought patterns, drugs and alcohol). If you’re drinking alcohol or doing anything else draining/maladaptive in your down time to cope with the stress, cut out those distractions and laser focus on getting back on track. None of this may even apply to you at all, but I wish I would have taken better care of myself when I was in your same shoes at school. Would have made the challenging times much easier. 

You’ll get through it! Just be sure to take care of yourself."

_theMAUCHO_,fdpnp9d,t3_emlghg,"Something that helps me is doing my freaking best in everything I can control and don't fret about the outcome. Be as compassionate with yourself as you would with your best friend but DONT use it as an excuse to slack off.

When I'm feeling down and out I love working out, cause it makes me know that, even if the times are rough, I'm still improving. Best of luck!!!"
idontknoez,fdq315a,t3_emlghg,"I think all this ""stay positive!"" talk is really unhelpful. Allow me to elaborate.

I've gone through hellish periods in my life. Those periods had their ups and downs. I was happy some days, unhappy during others.

During one particular bout recently, my mental state was exceptionally bad. My mind was constantly beating me down, I told myself lies and created conspiracy theories against myself.

What did I do? Did I pretend that everything was flowers and rainbows and count all my blessings?

Nope. First I accepted my position then I distracted myself from the thoughts. I did mindfulness meditation with Headspace occasionally. I kept myself busy. I hung out with friends, took on extra hours at work. I blasted music into my ears loud enough to drown out the negative thoughts. I stayed vigilant and was careful to make sure I caught myself whenever my negative mindset started to take over.

Eventually this habit of negative thinking became less and less invasive. I realized that negativity was begetting negativity.

Now that these negative thoughts were 90% gone, I was able to think about other things. Now I could count my blessings and fantasize about the flowers and rainbows that I could work towards. I had given myself room to breathe despite my circumstances having not changed significantly.

For me, it's not about thinking positive, it's about not thinking negative. That's what saved me.

Just my take."
JaFaRr9,fdpqxbq,t3_emlghg,"In a book I read called “See You At The Top” by Zigg Ziggler (lol I know strange name) he uses an analogy of a bank account and two bank tellers for our thoughts.

In it, he discusses how anything and anybody can make either a negative or a positive deposit.   

When we make withdrawals from our account, (recalling thoughts or memories) we choose to either go to the positive or negative teller.

So a quick recap:

The deposits = Total life experiences 

Withdrawals = Determine the state of our minds and ultimately our success and happiness in life

Now, upon reading this I was like “I sure as hell don’t choose, my withdrawals are mostly negative”.  

As if reading my mind, he continues and discusses how most people instinctively go to the negative teller.

He points out how we are constantly surrounded by doom and gloom, people complaining about what they don’t have instead of counting their blessings. People who put you down because of their insecurities. 

Ok that makes sense, but we can’t remove the negative deposits, they’re embedded deep within our psyche. 

What we can do is dilute out the negative deposits with an EXCESS of POSITIVE deposits.

How? Daily readings, audios, positive affirmations, and surrounding ourselves with positive people. 

Only overwhelming deposits of this nature will turn the tide and allow us to instinctively withdraw from the positive teller.

After all, you are the sum total of what goes into your mind."
neurosurgeon12,fdprdmv,t1_fdpqxbq,Ahh that's interesting. I'll have to read that book. Thank you!

Rezmir,fdpoodx,t3_emlghg,"I do think that is possible. That isn’t really how life is supposed to be. Everything has ups and downs, and just because you are on one of those downs, it simply doesn’t mean you still need to feel “up”.

Tying to make yourself happy or positive when the time is simply not for that, goes against your own feelings. Feeling that down will only make you have a better grasp of life. You will start to feel those normal days as good days, and those good days will feel amazing. 

Sometimes you gotta understand that times are tough and you don’t need to be positive, but you do need perseverance to keep on going. The secrete is just to change until the times are not rough anymore, it may take time but if you do change little by little it gets better. It takes time but it does get better, just keep on pushing to what you think will make your life less tough."
idontthinkthisisgary,fdpnkjv,t3_emlghg,"Your mind is a powerful weapon. If your mind can spiral you down negative tracks, your brain can most definitely spiral you up the other way. You seem you like already are trying to stay positive which is good. Practising gratitude helps ground you and makes you feel so much more positive. For example, ""Damn, I did bad these past 4 months. I guess I tried my best. I will do better next time! I'm glad that I'm able to pursue higher education where I live!""

Haha, something like that."

Keep going forward, keeping a positive mindset is really important, because your outlook defines your reality. Just keep pushing. I know it's hard because I've also struggled with my grades and I worked stupid hard and couldn't improve them, but if I'm being honest there were hours in the day lost to anxiety or withdrawing because I felt like I was drowning, where I maybe could've made extra progress. If you have a negative thought, just tell it to fuck off, put up any quotes or anything that inspires you to keep doing, around the place to look at. You can do it!!"

Decided to watch a funny show which kept my spirits up and exercised while doing so for an hour. That was time well spent. Cleaned my room a little too. Time spent even better. Looked up things I want to learn. I got so much done than I would have waking up earlier and stressing.

I noticed when I play music during showers my mind wouldn't wander to negative things as much, so it helps! I do get in a rut and you know how that is, it is a period where my mind probably goes 'fuck it I don't want to care anymore' and that's when things get better. Cheer up :)"

neurosurgeon12,fds2qdn,t1_fdrc675,Makes sense. Thank you!
oisui,fdsdsbz,t1_fds2qdn,"Anytime, no problem! Feel free to ask for any clarification or more tips 🧡"
DeliciousBlast,fdt07n8,t3_emlghg,"I will try to outline a way of thinking that works for me. Maybe you can find something helpful about it:

1. Continual positive thinking is a subconscious habit.  You program your subconscious with consistent practice using your consciousness.  You put in the effort, until it becomes effortless.  You make a daily practice of appreciating what is right in your life, from when you wake up, to when you go to bed.
2. Realize the quickest way to learn is by trial and error. Learning by making mistakes.  You learn to do things right from first doing it wrong.  So don't be so hard on yourself. Perfectionism and being self-critical can be a form of self-torture and self-punishment if it leads you into a mindset of depression where you only focus on past faults and mistakes.  Problem solve, and correct mistakes, resolve to improve, and move on. This doesn't just apply to school and education.  This is true of making friends, dating, planning a vacation, etc.  Think about how to improve for the next time, practice it, and move on.  The more experience you get, the better your skills will be.  When you have the skills, you can solve problems. When problems are solved, you are successful.  And the more successful you are, the more opportunities you attract.  Like a piece of carbon that has withstood constant heat, constant stress, constant pressure, after a certain point, you will emerge as a diamond among the rough.
3. In regards to grades, unless your have a scholarship or grant, or some kind of stepping stone riding on how well you perform, honestly, you just need to pass.  Remember, many self-made multimillionaires were average or failing students.  It tends to be education drop-outs that think outside the box and become entrepreneurial, and are the ones that hire the straight A's and B's students.  In the grand scale of life, it's not high grades that are the most valuable. The most valuable thing is to be adaptable, and be able to learn and evolve.  You need a base amount of booksmarts (literacy, financial literacy, about pre-algebra level math), and be heavily street smart (social skills, marketing skills, self-confidence/self-esteem/swag, creative/adaptable) to be successful in life.
4. Quantity of work and time is not the same and quality of work and time.  It's difficult to give out specific tips for studying and work, but try to be aware of what your teacher is going to test you on or, what they want you to know.  It is very helpful to learn and practice speed reading, as well as mnemonic devices to improve your memory and understanding.
5. No one can change you. But you can be inspired.  You decide whether you want to change yourself.  If you understand that your are already blessed with a functioning brain, full use of your hands, arms, limbs.  Good health.  Access to internet.  Access to a hot shower.  Clean water. A change of clothes. A warm place to sleep. You are already more wealthy than half the people on the planet.  And even moreso if you are in a city where you have freedom to express yourself and create, whether it be art, a story, a video, an idea, or an app.  If you understand that, and appreciate, then you know everyday is already a blessing.

Because it could always be worst. You could lose a hand or your sight. You could be locked up in jail. You could be falsely accused, or be at the wrong place at the wrong time in a hit-and-run. You could be locked up in someone's basement, later to be gutted for your organs or sex-trafficked.  You could be in a country where it is very difficult to get a visa or visit other countries.

Your brain can only focus on so many things at once.  You can fill it with positivity or negativity.  And you can choose to surround yourself with people, or things, or music, that will remind you of either positivity or negativity.  It's your choice how you scape your room, your space, and the type of space you choose to put yourself in.  Be positive. Solve problems. Solve your problems.  It is not necessarily easy, but things worth doing rarely are.  It is a mental discipline, a daily practice.  But once it becomes a part of you, once you take ownership of your life, you will realize life is what you choose to pursue and create for yourself, regardless of the constant obstacles.  At a certain point, you become so powerful, obstacles stop becoming obstacles.

I hope some of that, helps you. Good luck.

6.  Also, eat well.  Avoid junk food.  Eat real, eat fresh, eat healthy.  If you want to experiment, you can try eating traditional Korean food (hansik), Okinwana cuisine, or the local cuisine of Sardinia for  2 months.  Your body, mind, and spirit will function much better.  Your will feel and think like shit living off instant food, fast food, or any food that will suck your body of actual nutrition."

I'm at that stage where I can. My life was a mess before. I was deep into alcoholism. The anxiety was terrible. I let people treat me like shit.

My life isn't perfect now, but I'm in a far better place mentally. I'm also sober for 1.5 years and love myself more. While standard loving kindness meditation helped, so does gratitude meditation.

Basically I sit cross legged and meditate as normal. Then I CONSCIOUSLY bring up past traumas to my mind. I allow myself to feel these memories and sit with the sensations. If i cry, i cry. Then after a few minutes or so, I'll say ""I'm grateful that my life is no longer like that"", ""I'm grateful that I had the strength to give up alcohol"", ""I'm grateful that I now value myself independent of others validation"", etc.

I personalised the messages to my own circumstances.

The effect is profound. It puts things into perspective and allows me to truly internalise how far I've come. To me, it's more effective than just writing out a gratitude journal and going through the motions. I actually FEEL the gratitude with this meditation.

theherculean,en85st,top_level," I have been wanting to make changes to my life since early in my teenages. Now I am 33, and I have alternated between being overzealous in my goals at one time, to feeling overwhelmed as a consequence after as a result, and needing weeks and months to let go of my self-pity and start getting some faith in myself again to start working on things, which led me to set goals again, make progress, and then lose it again due to taking on way too much!

Time to end this cycle now, today! I will focus on making only one change. I only allow myself to move forward to the next one when I have successfully made it and I know that it will stick, because it has become a solid habit.

Focus one is learning to keep my home organized. Does not have to be perfect, but I don't want to let my house degenerate for months anymore to the point where I am ashamed to take guests (or I need to do emergency cleaning) and where I don't feel at peace being here.

My home should be a relaxed place, where I can come back after a day's work and feel proud. It should be a place of order, where I can find everything without much effort, and where I can host guests at any time.

I could make a list of dozens of changes I wish to make, but right now, this is the one. After this, I will move on to the next one. I am sure there's always something to improve about my life, and that's good, that means that I still feel like I have a lot of potential that I could make use of, and this year (and the years to follow) I expect to see that potential manifest more and more.

2020 will be a good year because of this. I am grateful for where I am now, there's so many good things in my life, I am happy with myself in that I see that I have a strong desire to build a good life, for myself, for the people I love and for society. I have faith in my abilities, while being realistic about who I am now and how much I can handle. I expect to become more disciplined as time passes, and I know that I have to, otherwise I will waste my life and cause much suffering to myself and to everyone, and I miss the opportunity to give good things back.

That will not happen. I regret wasting to much potential, but I will not get lost in self-pity anymore, nor will I get lost in overzealousness. I will start from where I am now.

Every day I will take steps to organize my home, and I expect it to be in order before the end of the week. Even if it takes me one or a few weeks more, that's OK, I will keep working until it is done. While doing this, I will also keep my home organized, building a cleaning routine that's realistic. The goal is not to reach total perfection, but to keep my home organized enough in an efficient way. At some point it will feel like second nature, and that's the time to move on.

The sooner I am able to do this, the sooner I can move on to my next change, but I'd rather do this successfully while feeling I can handle it, than force myself to rush too much, this is my first change and I need to allow myself to get used to working on something while staying balanced, especially because I know that I am prone to overzealousness and that this is the pathway to getting overwhelmed and giving up, which is not something that I want to do again.

So, I take the wisdom of the turtle, and take things slow, in order to win the race! :)

Anyone else recognize this pattern? Any advice on how to avoid my pitfalls and how to make this a successful and perhaps even exciting journey?

Thanks in advance, all the best on your own road to a disciplined life!"

One of my (near) future focus goals is to read a bunch of books (and taking as long as it takes). This book will be included on that list, I have heard a lot of good things about it.

But first need to get my home organized. Just spent half an hour organizing, will spend 4 more pomodoro's (4 \* 25 minutes with 5 minute breaks in between) on it this evening and then take a relaxing bath! :)

Feels good to make progress on the most important goal in my life right now. I know that having a tidy home will help me feel more at ease (both at home and elsewhere), proud and that it is a good exercise to get other areas of my life under control.

For every big goal that I finish I will give myself 100 euro's (all of these will take a considerable amount of effort). For every pomodoro-minute that I will spend I give myself 1 cent (meaning I will earn 1 euro tonight. I also add in other pomodoro's spent on other things that are not my primary goal but are important, such as work). I track all of this in a Google Sheets document. If I have an extremely good day, I can spend 20 pomodoro's on work (which is very rare), and this earns me 5 euro's. Still affordable. I expect to earn about 3 euro's on average on a given day, meaning that I earn an extra 100 euro per month to spend on things that I desire.

The flipside of all of this is that I no longer allow myself to spend money on luxuries that I don't really need, such as nice sports gear, gadgets, cool decorations for my home, expensive clothing, etc. However, I can earn the right to buy whatever I want buy working for it, and I don't have to feel guilty for buying these things.

I wanted to write that out, but to anyone reading this (including you hijoDePutibus) I am curious what you think about my attempt at boosting my motivation even more in this way. Do external motivators like these really work?"
hijoDePutibus,feate99,t1_fea2zwk,"On my case, external motivators don't work very well. This doesn't mean that They won't work for you or someone, and you won't know It If you don't try It.

I think that the important is that you are planning on how to achieve your goals. 

Surely, on the future, you will have to change things like try other methods, to find the best that suits you, but with time and effort You will improve."
kalamityj4ne,fdxlwtn,t3_en85st,"Thank you for sharing!  I'm also 33 and have fallen into the trap of being overzealous, then burning out,rinse, repeat.  I have decided to make changes in the way of habits.  As I implement them well, I move on to the next.  I am currently reading Atomic Habits by James Clear, and he really sends home the idea that small habits lead to monumental change.  I highly recommend it if you want a good motivator/reminder of how your changes will make this year great :)"
Alicia187,fdyv1ib,t3_en85st,"Instead of doing new year's resolutions that I do for the whole year, I've decided to do 12 month long challenges. For January, I'm meal planning. For February, I'm going to wake up at the same time every day. Etc. I'm hoping that this will mean that I can implement changes gradually and they'll stick rather than overfacing myself."

rowswimbiketri,fe0b4tg,t3_en85st,"I have been embracing /r/90daysgoal and tackling life improvements in small chunks. This current round is only my second, yet I stand amazed by changes (all good!) happening in my life as a result of small steps every day. I hope you find the thing that works for you for the long term!"
pyzez,fdzbmrm,t3_en85st,"Wow, go you! You’ve clearly set things off to a great start this year, long may it continue. As they say, start with how you wish to proceed."
Uniqniqu,fe1fsks,t3_en85st,I’m 33 as well and I’ve been having very similar challenges. My bedroom is very untidy and it stops me from doing anything else because every time I’m home I have to focus on tidying that I cannot do anything else and I also cannot do tidying as I keep getting distracted or not enjoying doing it. I hope I’ll break this cycle soon.
_beginagain,ema2hu,top_level,"I am currently trying to get disciplined, and spend my waking hours trying to be productive instead of lazying around. However, I am finding it to be so hard and heavy; mentally straining to get through. Before, when my lifestyle was more disciplined in comparison (albeit not super disciplined, but better), I didn’t have this issue and could get through indifferently. My understanding is that I need to break out of my bad habits and create new good habits. My question is, is it normal to feel these withdrawal-like symptoms (only mentally, and nothing intense like it would be with drugs) in the beginning stages of getting disciplined? I don’t have the strength to keep at it if this will continue on."
toataziua,fdn9tae,t3_ema2hu,"Yes it is normal. Your body and mind got used to  a lazy lifestyle and now that you're trying to be productive it's like they are going through a small ""shock"", but the good thing is that as you persevere with the thing you want to do the ""withdrawal"" will become less and less visible and in the end disappear."
danokooc,fdp7ngi,t1_fdn9tae,How long do you think it usually takes to fade?
_beginagain,fdpj3tx,t1_fdn9tae,Thanks for the response. I just hope it will get easier and easier the longer I keep at it.
toataziua,fdpzeyi,t1_fdp7ngi,"For every productive habit you're trying to implement you have somewhere around 2.5 - 3 months of time. With every habit that you add, the time becomes shorter and shorter as your body and mind get used to being productive."
LimeLoop,fe6vpl6,t1_fdpj3tx,Just be careful when you get there. It takes a lot less effort to break a good habit.
Osiris360,fdnl9nq,t3_ema2hu,"Yeah, for me it's basically an addiction. I'm learning that if I do what I'm supposed to for a few days I start losing my mind (withdrawals). I realized that the reason I never succeed at what I'm trying to do is because I'm not giving myself a lazy day when trying to change my lifestyle. And because I don't I basically go on a laziness bender. The trick is to understand that your body is essentially addicted to that lifestyle and like any other addiction, you have to feed it just a little every so often, because if you don't it will take back over. That is of course until you can permanently wean yourself of that addiction. I'm still learning to take control of my life but that's my two cents."
_beginagain,fdpjd86,t1_fdnl9nq,"Thanks. Yes, I also feel like it is an addiction. I hope I can eventually reach that point where I can break out of it and not have to give myself constant breaks, but until then that may be necessary to keep my sanity."
ehtui,fdnarwq,t3_ema2hu,"Totally normal. I suffered a lot to get disciplined. Keep in mind that it is worth it, try to stay healthy while disciplined. Don't strain yourself too much, take some breaks. It'll help."
_beginagain,fdpjg9i,t1_fdnarwq,Thank you. I’ll take some breaks and not suddenly try to go from 0 to 100.
MillenniumGreed,fdplyej,t1_fdnarwq,How long did it take you to feel jolted to a productivity mindset/behavior?
ehtui,fdpm5go,t1_fdplyej,Id say it took me a few months to really get used to it. But there are still days where it's a bit hard to keep the rythm
MillenniumGreed,fdpmgfy,t1_fdpm5go,"What's the key? Did you start out small and make gradual changes? Or make abrupt, immediate changes? Both? And do you think what works better just depends on the person?"
ehtui,fdpmsl7,t1_fdpmgfy,"My change felt quite abrupt, but it was still a process with multiple stages. I think you need to bring yourself to a certain point of productivity/discipline to get any results from the beginning, otherwise the ""gradual change"" just gets another medium of procrastination."
decalotus,fdo9f0q,t3_ema2hu,"Discipline is a muscle. Working it out will be difficult and tiring, but it'll get easier over time."
HeroIsAGirlsName,fdosh5e,t3_ema2hu,"What really helped me is learning *why* my brain  wants to keep me at home on the couch. 

Simply put, your lizard brain is the oldest, most survival focussed part of your brain. It's trying to protect you by keeping you safe at home because for all it knows there might be saber tooth tigers outside. 

The trick is noticing when it's trying to stop you trying new things. Knowing why it happens makes it easier to distinguish it from more valid concerns."
1nfinitezer0,fdotkt9,t3_ema2hu,"It's good to push yourself sometimes, you can notice the limits of your capacity. As long as there's support from many things in your life, you can sustain this type of exhaustion for quite some tired. How can you distinguish true desire to tap out and do nothing from the lingering habitual want? What does your body and mind need to keep running, as well as to find balance, and push your edge...

What would give you the strength to keep at it? You can find it if you need to."
schwaschwaschwaschwa,fdoi195,t3_ema2hu,"Yes, totally normal.

Keep at it, gently! You can start craving productivity as well within enough time. Giving yourself lazy periods is a good tip others have offered."
Sure-Neat,fdo1vx6,t3_ema2hu,"The work on yourself is one of the hardest. While getting rid of my limited expectations I felt this resistance of the body. And got ill. But it's necessary to do,really."
NYCThrowawayNSFW,fdoy1iw,t3_ema2hu,"Once you get through the discipline barrier, the tasks won’t be as draining. In fact, you will find yourself with more time to do more stuff. Add a habit, or choose to relax with that time."
ManicPickleDreamGirl,fdp5ytb,t3_ema2hu,"Yeah, I've felt the same way! It's hard to break habits. If it's really overwhelming, try making smaller goals - for me, exercising for 10 minutes with an app has been an easier habit to build than going to the gym. Then you can build on a small habit once it's established. Just an example, but I hope that helps :)"
_beginagain,fdpjld5,t1_fdp5ytb,"Thank you. That sounds like good advice. I’m a very all-or-nothing kind of person, but I’m starting to learn that habits don’t work that way. I can’t suddenly get rid of all my bad habits and make new good habits. The process has to be gradual."
SylvanField,fdqw13j,t3_ema2hu,"You might want to do some research into extinction bursts, where the brain rebels against new habits and the desired behaviour gets worse before it gets better. 

Think of it as your brain having a toddler tantrum.  If you stick it out, there will be fewer tantrums. But if you give in, your brain will know that if you will give it what it wants if it whines enough. 

But uh... look at dog training websites instead of human ones. Dog training info focuses on strategies to eliminate the behaviour. Human focused ones are more about telling you that feelings are ok and aren’t as helpful."
Booferoni420,fdpmebz,t3_ema2hu,Be disciplined but dont forget to have fun balance is key.
postmate,fdprjc0,t3_ema2hu,Just make sure you plan breaks where you can relax. If you try to be overly disciplined you will probably get burned out and then binge on laziness. Or you will just feel like a robot.
Ironstark78,fdq7e18,t3_ema2hu,"One thing to try is set small goals.  ""Do the laundry"", ""put away the dishes"", ""go outside for a walk"".  You will find that after you complete these tasks you will feel a surge of positive feelings.  These positive feelings will eventually become ""addictive"" and you will look forward to doing larger projects.  Also remember that any task that seems insurmountable can usually be broken down into smaller achievable pieces."
Tubibubitas,elf6s3,top_level,"Set a timer for ten minutes, close all your tabs, put down your phone and do that thing you've been postponing for ages now. Just ten minutes. Put in some real, honest effort for ten minutes.

If, after those ten minutes, you still feel like you need to turn your life around: go for it. But maybe, just maybe, you do not need to wake up at 07:00  every day, lay off the alcohol completely and start a new exercise routine from now on just because you've been procrastinating on a paper for a while.

Good luck!"

l33tninj,fdmedzg,t1_fdkg8js,"I'm better at working through this than I used to be. Things that helped: 

* Brain dump on paper at the first hint of 'future planning vs. present doing'. Anything about how I'm going to change process or habits goes on a list to review on Sunday. Anything I can just execute now goes on the to do list in order. 
* Doing one thing at a time until it's done. The book 'One Thing' by G. Keller helped with this.
* Picking the right things and sticking to them regardless of emotional thrashing and anxiety. The book 'Turning Pro' by S. Pressfield helped with this. (War of Art, also great.)"

GratitudeProblem,em1f9k,top_level," 

Ever since we were born, we've been told what to do, when to do it, and how to do it; ranging from parents to teachers to government, etc. This way of living ingrains deeply into our psyche. We don't set the schedule, we don't set the task, we don't make the rules; we follow them.

Why is it that someone is capable of commuting 2 hours to a job that they  hate, work hard for someone they hate, and collect their paycheck for an  amount that they hate? That's a massive amount of time and energy expelled, yet there's not a hint of procrastination there at all.

When you were/are in school and the teacher gives you an assignment to  finish by the end of class, you don't question whether or not you want  to do it, you just do it.

But when  it comes to homework that's a whole different ball game. Sure the  teacher told you it needs to be done, but you get to decide when it's done; definitely not now. You take it home and suddenly it takes a world of willpower to reach for your backpack behind the couch and it ends up being done at the last waking minute.

Or how about that entrepreneurial venture you've set out on? You probably  went to hang out at a friends house instead of writing that song that you've been telling yourself you want to get done. But imagine there was  someone telling you that it needs to be done. What if instead of working solo, you had a very skilled partner who told you that it needs to be done by a certain date or you'd be out of the group? I bet you'd get it done then."
NickoBicko,fdlqc6o,t3_em1f9k,"I was told to do homework in school and never did it. 

In fact, with all authority I’ve basically done the minimum or tried to avoid the thing. Or just straight up not do it and take the punishment. 

It wasn’t until that I became truly independent and started my own business that I was able to start to defeat the procrastination habit. 

You’re touching on 2 concepts to help with procrastination. 

1) Real stakes. Having explicit deadlines and punishment for failure. 

2) Accountability. Having others work with you or supervise you or hold you accountable. 

They are both good."
swangt,fdme3xm,t3_em1f9k,"A large part of why I do anything - reward - is to be in control of my life. Yes, I 100% agree. I will do the hard even unsuccessful way sometimes if it means I chose to do it lol I want to live my life, nobody else's."
Iwouldlikeabagel,fdlqg9t,t3_em1f9k,"I think that's a huge part of it!

Also if we think about doing something in a way that makes it seem to be a total drag, we aren't gonna want to do it. Even something as AWFUL and DREADFUL as doing your taxes is scribbling numbers in boxes, or pressing buttons on a keyboard.  But there's such a big song and dance around it that it tortures us for months."

lazlokovax,fdn0xtr,t3_em1f9k,"I like the characterisation of procrastination as a kind of ""short term mood repair.""

> Procrastinators will tell you that the task they're facing (avoiding) is difficult, and it creates bad feelings like anxiety or general emotional distress. Putting off the task at hand is an effective way of regulating this mood. Avoid the task, avoid the bad mood.

cornelmanu,fdokv2i,t3_em1f9k,"I think you're making this way too complicated than it is. Procastination is simply your brain conserving energy. 

You just need a strong reason to defeat it. The problem comes when you expect external reasons (getting fired because you didn't show up to work) instead of creating internal reasons.

When you want something as bad as you want to breathe, then you have no problem doing it. The problem is that many people only kinda want it. So they only kinda do it."
