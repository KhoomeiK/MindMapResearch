pillbinge,fdp7ats,t1_fdn4ao7,"That's such a cherry-picked statistic that it's just going to make people feel bad for you. That's like saying people who spend more money have less money, when in reality they a) had more money to begin with and b) haven't identified their income vs. expenditures. You can also make more money and end up with less than someone with less money who doesn't spend it. Clinton basically balanced the budget fairly well, as did Obama. Clinton's act was even more impressive given that he had to contend with Reagan and HW Bush, who increased taxes and made things worse overall.

[This thread is a greatly sourced and accurate indication of Reagan's effect on the economy](https://twitter.com/wardqnormal/status/1206280031552454656) and the lead up to what Clinton had to deal with. *That* is conservatism.

Since Reagan, the national debt has ballooned under Republicans AT THE SAME TIME social programs have been cut AND taxes on working people have increased (Reagan, for example, increased payroll taxes while reducing the top marginal tax rates). Under Reagan, the homeless population surged, partly because many mentally ill people who had no money were kicked out of care facilities.  

Where was all that money going?   

Some argue that his military spending caused the Russians to freak out and go bankrupt with their own military spending, and thus causing the collapse of the USSR. Maybe! I have no idea."

hamberderberdlar,fdlusie,t1_fdkqb6r,"*Some argue that his military spending caused the Russians to freak out and go bankrupt with their own military spending, and thus causing the collapse of the USSR. Maybe! I have no idea.*

No, no

Their command economy just didnt work. The whole purpose and basis for the USSR had failed. It promised utopia, but by the time it collapsed it was far behind other countries, a miserable place, unable to maintain its current crappy system, and everyone knew this. 

What was the real miracle is that there wasnt a strong sense of russian nationalism when it collapsed, or they would have likely tried to hold onto all of their colonies. So they let other countries leave the USSR and get independence and gave up control of former vassal countries. 

This didnt develop until a decade later, and that is why Putin is so butthurt. There is now a big sense of russian exceptionalism and nationalism, and they feel like they should be able to dominate and control their former colonies and vassals but they cant."

Now if you mean where does the money go?  Then the answer is local and regional priorities. Little Rock needs a storm water treatment expansion. Denver needs money to maintain that huge airport. California has to cover the losses of natural catastrophes.  Farmers gotta be compensated for not planting wheat one year, cotton the next. Some of these projects are pork - way too much  money is going into Little Rock because the designer is the congressman's niece; or the concrete company in Denver is owned by the congressman's golf partner's brother-in-law.

LeChuckly,fdlm48y,t1_fdkyrwb,"Per your source - 2/3 of all spending is mandatory (SS, Medicare/caid)

The last 1/3 is discretionary - of which 1/2 is military spending.

So the “pork” you’re referring to is 1/6 of all government spending. And that’s only if you consider all government spending on things like housing, welfare and subsidies pork. Which is a bit of a broad brush.

""Socialized medicine"" is not the source of health care inflation. It's cost disease combined our weird hybrid system which offers the worst of both worlds. 

The parties are not the same. The GOP is a far right populist vehicle for corporate factions to get their pet policies, and for older white Americans to express their alarm and disapproval at the world changing around them. The Democrats are a big-tent centrist coalition of interest groups. At most, they could be said to represent a positive vision of government, generalized civil rights, and some sort of welfare system. Past that, nothing binds them."

That propaganda would work the same under ranked choice as it would be under first-past-the-post.

My mother was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. We do not have insurance in America nor have ability to pay the medical bills here, so we decided that it’s better for her to go back to South Korea for the time being, where they arguably have one of the best medical systems in the world (and it’s affordable!). The current US immigration policies state that if she does not come back in 45 days, our entire green card application will be abandoned and I will be forced to go back as well (we received emergency parole). I don’t think cancer is something that can be treated that quick. I’m a junior in a private university and would very much like to finish my degree in America.

As for your statement about France, that’s not really true. In my experience (I lived in Paris for a bit in 2012-13) the French are extremely welcoming of other cultures, and proud to be a diverse nation. Sure, there are some people who feel their French culture is being lost, just like there are rednecks in the US feeling their culture is being lost, just like there are people all over the world thinking their culture is being lost. But it’s not—it’s being shared, and spread. Which it should be. Borders are arbitrary, and we have the means and technology to live in a world where ideas and cultures are shared freely.

**TLDR: Healthcare in the USA is broken. At the center of the problem appears to be ignorance by most doctors of how costs and prices are actually related, and how the amount charged to patients is formulated. Almost all of the financial transactions in healthcare are hidden from the providers as well as the patients. Billing charges for a medical service typically have little relation to the actual cost of the service or even to the expected reimbursement rate eventually payed to the doctor. This website examines and analyzes years of financial records from hundreds of hospitals, major pharmacies, insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies to uncover the bizarre nature of the ""U.S. healthcare system"". It dispels the misconception that we have, in the U.S. a “free market system"", and in fact, what is uncovered does not look very much like a market at all; either free or regulated. And no one knows what anything costs.**"

tisforthedog,fdogr9e,t3_emc55o,"this is very misleading. every physician in the united states has some amount of training in psychiatry and psych meds. primary care doctors don't have formal post-graduate education in psychiatry specifically, but they do continue to receive training in the presentation, diagnosis, and management of the most common chronic conditions -- which obviously includes psychiatric conditions. Of course they won't have the same level of expertise as a board certified psychiatrist who spent 4+ years in training with that emphasis, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to do anything to manage these conditions. that would be like saying a family med doc can't prescribe blood pressure medications because they aren't a cardiologist. The whole point of primary care is to diagnose/triage conditions, coordinate care, and manage straightforward presentations of illness. good primary care docs know when things are outside of their scope of comfort and will refer out. Another thing to note is that many of the people who are treated for mental health conditions would not be able to see a psychiatrist. They can be incredibly difficulty to find, so the alternative for most patient's isn't having a more experienced doctor start them on medication, it's not being started on anything at all."
Suolucidir,fdo9pht,t3_emc55o,"/u/signandsight is correct.

ALL medical doctors in the US have SOME training in psychiatric treatment. That's because PCPs are trained to look at the entire medical history for their patients, including as it relates to treatment by other specialists and drugs they are prescribed by another provider.

There may be exceptions, but I am not aware of any, they would be extremely rare, and PCPs who do not get basic training in psychiatry have no business treating a general patient population.

Certain psychiatric drugs carry very low risks and are OK to experiment with, by taking them for a short period under the supervision of a PCP and then continuing if the positive results outweigh the side effects. 

Certain states are already experimenting with programs for NURSES to prescribe and monitor psychiatric treatments, something which is even MORE risky than a PCP. If this 2014 study makes you nervous, get ready to be positively paranoid as demand for psychiatry is vastly outstripping the supply of psychiatrists and the healthcare industry is answering that challenge by allowing more and more unqualified providers to take over."

davidquick,fdorzr0,t3_emc55o,"Because many doctors are assholes.  

I have ADHD.  I've been in the same meds for the past 10 years with only small changes in dosage here or there as I've lost and gained weight.  

Everytime I move I get the wonderful opportunity to engage with the raging dumpster fire that is our mental healthcare system.  So first you have to find a list of places that accept your flavor of insurance, then you have to double check them to see if they actually take your insurance.  The first step might yield 100 providers if you're willing to drive a ways.  The second step will reduce that list to 10-20 providers.

Then you have to go to their website and see if those providers are part of a practice that doesn't believe in prescribing stimulants (that's me specifically but there's any number of supposedly legitimate mental healthcare providers that tie some weird ideology to their treatment that you have to accept to get care).  This will usually drop you down to 5-10 providers.  

That's the easy work done.  Now you have to see if any of them are accepting new patients.  If they are does the provider specialize in a demographic that you're not a part of?  Good luck with that.

Then you get to actually go to an appointment.  You get to explain your medical history 2-3 times in addition to filling out a form on the website and a paper form in the office.  Then you have to graciously accept that the doctor would like you to try some form of CBT and life coach training before they'll prescribe the medication that you've been taking without issue for a decade.  

Then when that doesn't work, which you knew it wouldn't because you've been forced to try whatever non medical intervention of the day several times over the years, you get to try any number of other medications because they're ""not as addictive"".  You know why they're not as addictive? Because they don't work as well.  

Then finally they'll give you the prescription and now you get the wonderful opportunity to interact with a pharmacist.  You'll get to convince the pharmacist that the script is real.  They'll want to call your doctor to verify and if your doctor isn't available sorry you'll have to wait until they hear back from the doc.  

Etc etc etc.  

And this is for a thing that I know I have.  That I know the effective treatment for. And that's been well handled for a decade.

d-h-a,fdpo5ve,t3_emc55o,"I think it’s fair to say that this is alarming but at the same time there are lots of factors to consider. I saw a therapist for almost three years, most of which I was taking an SSRI, lexapro. My counselor couldn’t prescribe this to me and I was only having to pay a small copay to see her compared to the copay of a specialist ie a psychiatrist. My PCP prescribed me the lexapro and it saved me life. My therapist was basically powerless to make any medical decisions for me, she’s not trained for it, but the cost of seeing both the PCP and the counselor was STILL less than ONE visit to the psychiatrist. I’m able to go to my doctor twice a year to check in with her for my lexapro, which is not enough I know. But I would much rather do that than pay $70 a week to see a psychiatrist when I could pay $20 a week for counseling and $20 twice a year for my PCP. Insurance is to blame for the majority of this. Period. Yes PCPs should have a LOT more training in mental healthcare but insurances need to lower their specialist costs or ya know, eliminate them to make proper mental health diagnoses and treatments affordable. It also takes a long freaking time to get to a counselor, let alone a psychiatrist. Your PCP is someone you already know and is a more immediate solution, especially if you are underage. My insurance won’t let me see a new doctor without my parents there for the first visit and I live alone, 2000 miles away from them. Going to the PCP let’s teenagers hide or at least access medication their parents wouldn’t agree with, SSRIs being one of those."

crazykiwi,fdr53zk,t1_fdr0cen,"A friend was telling me how, funny enough, Early Childhood Education philosophy figured that out in the late 90's to early 2000's in some countries. All the systems were pushing ""quality"" through more and more complex systems of tick boxes and rubrics that were all linked to a raft of research. It was going to solve ""quality"" issues in the field.

But apparently. It actually caused qualified, intelligent Early Childhood Educators to not be able to think in the context of their own settings, to not be able to address their specific children and families as individuals and stifled creativity, a sense of flow, curiosity and creativity in the job. Apparently the rigidity of the systems also caused havoc to children with disabilities and further alienated children of different cultures with token, standard approaches (i.e. Must play something like 20 min of cultural music a week from the child's culture to get full 'quality' marks from ECERS assessment). You know rather than having a relationship with the family and actually listening and connecting and them feel part of the community in meaningful ways. 

Shockingly, making professionals obedient didn't improve quality. Other fields apparently had similar issues and seemed to be finding each other. Systems pushed back and a new approach was designed where professionals were thought of as competent, capable, thinking human beings called 'reflective practitioners.' Professionals and stakeholders challenged each other to develop tools and ways of thinking that were more healthy, and were encouraged to challenge each other, and be open to being challenged to think deeper, to develop higher level guiding principles that require intelligence and an understanding of context to implement. My friend loves it and refers to it as relational reflective practice. 

From what I hear the system seems to work better because it has been picked up by innovative education ministries all over the world. I'm not sure it would translate to every field, but it's case in point that not being treated like a robot can result in good things.

The Quality vs. Reflection movement is something I think everyone should be aware of."

I don't care if adults drink.  I have an occasional drink.  What I'm concerned about is normalization of drinking culture that can cause a lot of problems.  Wino culture makes it ""normal"" AKA culturally acceptable for a woman to have 3-4 glasses of wine every day.  That's actually quite a bit of wine, and if you're doing that every day you're close to the borderline of being alcoholic.  I think the same is true of binge drinking for guys especially young guys.  

The problem isn't occasionally drinking.  But when you normalize it, when it's a ""cute"" thing that you put on your wine glass or hang on your walls, you stop paying attention to it in yourself or other people.  That behavior no longer raises a red flag, you don't think ""gee I'm having multiple glasses of wine every day"". It's a joke ""it's wine o clock.""  And then you can have your addiction and never think about it."
plumshark,fe5wjjd,t1_fe5s5gq,Does wine o'clock have anything to do with how many glasses you drink? Like should we never joke about alcohol? If the answer is no then the line you draw is arbitrary and based on your own projections

ravia,fdwejrv,t3_en5axn,"I'm not sure how well this relates, but once, when I'd driven a taxi for about 8 years, I called MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving), and succeeded in talking to the director. I called for specifically this reason. I told her that as a taxi driver something had become clear to me: a lot of people, especially women (it seemed to me) were drinking in a specific way. they were trying to ""do the right thing"" by eating first. Then they would go out and drink with friends. Because the food they had eaten was being digested and the blood cells were busy carrying that food into their body, when they drank, they didn't get a buzz or drunk. So what did they do? Shots, of course. And then they got *more* drunk, and I'd ended up cleaning the contents of countless stomachs from my cab or directing them to throw up well outside of the vehicle when pulled over onto the side of the road.

It told the director that MADD really might want to give advice on how to get drunk more safely (which I fully understand is not something they are prone to do!) But I went on to say that the best advice for drinking is to *not* eat before drinking and then go for a 2 to 3 drink buzz. I know MADD is not going to offer such advice (pending, perhaps, some extensive studies that would show this is good advice)."
slugposse,fdxxph0,t1_fdwejrv,"That is a pragmatic take I've never heard before, and I think you are right. In fact I can't believe I never realized that that eating before obviously does not prevent you from eventually absorbing all the alcohol you drink. It just delays feeling it long enough for you to drink way more than you really want. You are just right.

Similarly, I've suspected that raising the drinking age has prevented young adults from learning how to drink responsibly.

Instead of older teenagers being included in having wine with special family meals or being allowed to have a drink or two while out socializing publicly where responsible alcohol use is being modeled, they are introduced to consuming alcohol at hidden underage parties where abusing alcohol is the main event. Two American generations now have been conditioned to drink as if it were the goal of the evening rather than as an enhancement.

In our culture, people drink. Why not provide practical information?"
retrojoe,fe0jh6s,t1_fdwejrv,"Uhhh...I'm guessing that your puking passengers (unless they were the sort of people who *never drink*) were consuming more than 3 or 4 units of alcohol. Former bartender here. Unless they were doing three shots in quick succession, that could do it.

Even when full, you begin to absorb the alcohol right away, it's just moderated by the food sitting in/blocking your intestines. If there's nothing there, the booze rushes past the stomach and hits the intestines right away, where everything is more efficiently absorbed. Another thing to consider is *what* is eaten. Dense, heavy meals of starches and carbohydrates tend to work as a better buffer for alcohol compared to meat, but especially compared to the green and leafy fare that many health/diet conscious women go for."
ravia,fe0v1ew,t1_fe0jh6s,"yeah, it seems like you didn't get my point which was that these really drunk people drink way more than they needed to precisely because they ate first. As I read up again on the topic most of the reason is because of the actual presence of food in the stomach and preventing alcohol from moving past the stomach to the intestines. However I do clearly remember reading one article that explained that the alcohol is also not metabolized as well because of the actual activity that the blood is involved in in carrying the food around the body. Now I can't find that bit but everyone agrees to eating slows alcohol absorption. it's interesting to note that there are even some articles that provide recommendations on exactly how to get drunk. it does appear that if people eat a lot before they drink they will have trouble getting drunk and in any case that does seem to be what happens with some people. They eat a lot, they don't get drunk, so they start doing shots and whatnot, and they get drunker and they also get sicker and puke it all up which is what my customers were doing."

I believe many I know are trying to fill a void with drinking, and I’m not saying that I don’t feel one either. I’m fortunate I’m not predisposed to drink to fill that void.

As ice cream consumption goes up, deaths by drowning do as well. That's because people spend more time at the pool in the summer and they also eat more ice cream. They correlate, but they don't cause each other. In this case, alcohol deaths going up tells us one thing, but it doesn't tell us much else. We still need to research why.

Neoliberalism is a set of social, cultural, and political-economic forces that puts competition at the center of social life.

Under neoliberalism, the government's charge is not the care of it's citizens but rather the promotion of a market-based society that will engage individual competitive pursuits.

Neoliberalism diminishes our capacities for coming together, caring for ourselves and others, and organizing collectively by forcing us to live in competition

It's led to an era of rampant anxiety, insecurity, and inequality."

Especially if the game gives advantages to those ahead and has no comeback mechanics whatsoever.  Being poor makes you highly uncompetitive. You need a miracle just to make it.  

Add onto that rampant propaganda that puts the blame squarely on the victims of this charade and assures them that if they don't make it, well it's entirely their fault.  

It's much more sinister than you make it out to be.  This is no sport and if it were the game would have been called a long time ago.  We would have reset the scoreboard and started again.

>	The diseases of despair are three classes of behavior-related medical conditions that increase in groups of people who experience despair due to a sense that their long-term social and economic outlook is bleak. The three disease types are drug overdose (including alcohol overdose), suicide, and alcoholic liver disease.

>	Diseases of despair, and the resulting deaths of despair, are high in the Appalachia region of the United States. The prevalence increased markedly during the first decades of the 21st century, especially among middle-aged and older working class white Americans starting in 2010, followed by an increase in mortality for Hispanic Americans in 2011 and African Americans in 2014.[1] It gained media attention because of its connection to the opioid epidemic.[2]

Harvard’s health law conference on Diseases of Despair has an interesting introduction article, as well as various other resources related to the topic, which can be found [at this link](https://blog.petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/2018/07/22/diseases-of-despair-the-role-of-policy-and-law/).

The rise of suicides amongst non-Hispanic males seems to be more dramatic in the US, with some countries declining since 1990 and others increasing to a lesser degree. From the subset of countries [presented in this article, it appears the rate amongst English speaking countries is increasing more than in non-English speaking countries](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/23/521083335/the-forces-driving-middle-aged-white-peoples-deaths-of-despair). This would [coincide with the dramatic rise in wealth/income inequality in English speaking countries vs Continental Europe](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/07/Top-Incomes.png).

Quote from the article above:

>	We're thinking of this in terms of something that's been going on for a long time, something that's emerged as the iceberg has risen out of the water. We think of this as part of the decline of the white working class. If you go back to the early '70s when you had the so-called blue-collar aristocrats, those jobs have slowly crumbled away and many more men are finding themselves in a much more hostile labor market with lower wages, lower quality and less permanent jobs. That's made it harder for them to get married. They don't get to know their own kids. There's a lot of social dysfunction building up over time. There's a sense that these people have lost this sense of status and belonging. And these are classic preconditions for suicide.

Neoliberalism is generally considered to have taken off governmentally in English speaking countries around 1980 [(Reagan + Thatcher)](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot ), which you can see is the point at which inequality began to skyrocket amongst English speaking countries. The result of these neoliberal policies - deregulation, privatization, free trade, tax cuts, union busting, etc - is the current structure of a [rigged economy that primarily benefits the wealthy](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-american-economy-is-rigged/). 

Neoliberalism, though being primarily connected to Republicans, has become entrenched in the Democratic Party as well. This is seen most clearly in the [policies of Bill Clinton](https://prospect.org/health/fabulous-failure-clinton-s-1990s-origins-times/ ), such as NAFTA and the his further deregulation of Wall Street, and [Chuck Schumer, who is a notorious power player for Wall Street friendly policy](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/business/14schumer.html).

Since the 1970s, there have been deliberate collective efforts on the part of business to shift political power away from labor, which coincides [with the wealth and income inequality that took really took off in the late 70s and 80s](https://kids.kiddle.co/images/thumb/e/e7/U.S._Income_Shares_of_Top_1%25_and_0.1%25_1913-2013.png/600px-U.S._Income_Shares_of_Top_1%25_and_0.1%25_1913-2013.png). Using their newfound political mobilization, business would lobby for laws related to tax cuts, deregulation, union busting, free trade, CEO pay, etc. 
[Financialization](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/pitfalls-financialization-american-business/) 
and [Globalization](https://deanbaker.net/images/stories/documents/Rigged.pdf), often operating under these new laws lobbied for by corporations and the rich, then further eroded US labor power.

>	On August 23, 1971, prior to accepting Nixon’s nomination to the Supreme Court, Powell was commissioned by his neighbor, Eugene B. Sydnor Jr., a close friend and education director of the US Chamber of Commerce, to write a confidential memorandum for the chamber entitled “Attack on the American Free Enterprise System,” an anti-Communist and anti-New Deal blueprint for conservative business interests to retake America.[14][15] It was based in part on Powell’s reaction to the work of activist Ralph Nader, whose 1965 exposé on General Motors, Unsafe at Any Speed, put a focus on the auto industry putting profit ahead of safety, which triggered the American consumer movement. Powell saw it as an undermining of the power of private business and an ostensible step towards socialism.[14] His experiences as a corporate lawyer and a director on the board of Phillip Morris from 1964 until his appointment to the Supreme Court made him a champion of the tobacco industry who railed against the growing scientific evidence linking smoking to cancer deaths.[14] He argued, unsuccessfully, that tobacco companies’ First Amendment rights were being infringed when news organizations were not giving credence to the cancer denials of the industry. [14]

>	The memo called for corporate America to become more aggressive in molding society’s thinking about business, government, politics and law in the US. It sparked wealthy heirs of earlier American Industrialists like Richard Mellon Scaife; the Earhart Foundation, whose money came from an oil fortune; and the Smith Richardson Foundation, from the cough medicine dynasty;[14] to use their private charitable foundations, which did not have to report their political activities, to join the Carthage Foundation, founded by Scaife in 1964[14] to fund Powell’s vision of a pro-business, anti-socialist, putatively minimalist government-regulated America as he thought it had been in the heyday of early American industrialism, before the Great Depression and the rise of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal.

>	The Powell Memorandum thus became the blueprint for the rise of the American conservative movement and the formation of a network of influential right-wing think tanks and lobbying organizations, such as The Heritage Foundation and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) as well as inspiring the US Chamber of Commerce to become far more politically active.[16][17]

Expanding on this idea to a slightly earlier history: many people view the rise of the right to be tied strongly to the rise of moral religious issues, which does play a key part. However, people often will say this began in the 70s “independent” of corporate interest, but there were large scale corporate movements to create Christian America in the 1930s-1940s, mainly in opposition to the new deal. This provided the framework for the religious right.

What I'm thinking about is just people getting better at normal compiler optimisation, JIT or otherwise, maybe putting a compiler in the installation executable that customises for their machine, and maybe extending it compiling to a few other languages that are currently normally interpreted.

Many people have outdated insulation in their houses.  Why don't they replace them?  Because the cost and trouble of tearing out the old insulation and putting in the new insulation isn't worth it.   It is the same thing with software.

The cost of software = (cost of programmers \* the amount of time it takes to build it) + (cost of programmers \* amount of effort it takes to maintain it) + (cost of hardware)

A decent software developer can cost upwards of $200k a year to employ (salary + benefits + dev software + office space, etc).  That means that a team of 5 developers working for a year on a project costs about $1 million dollars.  A massive 64 core server on AWS costs about $100,000 a year (with redundancy and network, etc).  You can see why companies would rather focus on more efficient developers than more efficient software.

Most applications are not CPU bound anyway.  They spend most of their time waiting on remote calls to RAM/Disk/Network etc.   Most of the apps on your phone are just a thin front end for remote calls to a back end server.  Most business applications are just a wrapper for a database.

You are correct that with our current architecture we cannot throw more hardware at the issue. We built ourselves around a single monolithic DB, which actually has a lot of advantages, but if we had made this application today rather than 10 years ago I'm sure we would have used some DB that *does* allow you to just scale out horizontally and then we *could* just pay more for more performance."

CPUs aren't going to slow down.  So if performance isnt a major concern today why will it be in the future?  In fact server side single thread performance had largely stagnated (compared to historical trends) over the last 5-10 years). So it's not even a new problem.

In fact we tend to have the opposite problem.  In most clusters the CPU is so fast that it spends most it's time idle.  A bunch of development effort has been spent addressing this: virtualization, Docker, Kubernetes, serverless, autoscaling, etc.

And even that isn't good enough to run the space shuttle.

When computers stop getting faster, that doesn't even mean that we're suddenly going to have a lack of people who know how to optimize stuff.

pillbinge,fe46crl,t3_enq3so,"I don't want to jerk myself off publicly but thank you for posting this, because I wondered about this over the past few years. I'm not a programmer and at best, I only understand what I do due to *Silicon Valley* and an HTML class I took in Middle School.

The experience of using a new iPhone in 2020 is pretty much the same as in 2010. The quickness of the programs, the sleek speed, and so on. Plenty of apps have been creative with what they do, and [some apps like for YouTube](https://www.google.com/search?q=old+iphone+youtube+logo&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS799US799&oq=old+iphone+you+tu&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l7.3159j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) have *really* come a long way. But ultimately, the experience hasn't changed. As better processing becomes available, the developers almost feel the need to take advantage for no purpose (design wise) or they get sloppy.

[This article on Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/the-exceptional-beauty-of-doom-3s-source-code-5975610) about *Doom 3*'s source code suddenly made sense. You could program a very nice-looking game that ran well and had few bugs while also having less coding than contemporary titles. That's when I realize coding was just brute strength. Even better, if you look at video games on a console at the beginning of its life, like Halo 1 on XBOX, and then at the end, it's clear that developers learn how to work around certain features more and more and more.

I work in education and I'm convinced to this day that having a 10-year-old physics textbook is far better than any new Khan Academy program there is, because a teacher who's kept around for 10 years as well can get to know the book just as well. They can compensate in some areas and really guide students through it. If an online program is constantly changed, the teacher is just out of the loop. While it's impressive and temping to use the brightest, newest technology, often the idea of making such a leap is a lie. You aren't making anything better. You're just forcing kids to use shitty Chromebooks.

I also read how 4k TVs (which have always just been 1080p x2 because they changed what they were representing) might be the end anyway. Right now we can't fathom going smaller because you'd be closer to the size of atoms, and we can't physically make anything at that level really. Maybe we'll have to radically change how we approach it, but the main question is ""do we need more than 4k""? What are we really moving toward? In the end, it's just marketing. It was just as fun watching TV in 96 with a tube TV as it was watching HD on a 1080p. No one was actually upset about older TVs for these particular reasons because it wasn't an issue in context.

To the author's conclusion - I don't think it's really a choice though. We need people to code better just because, and they might learn to code better just by having the time and space to do so anyway. But what are we really coding for? It's interesting what computers can do but they don't immediately improve our lives like before, and if they do, it's down to consumerism."

It's okay for additional practice but Khan is only useful when kids are already driven or independent, like in college or something. But by then you've already filtered for those who might be academically resourceful.

Khan is just more of the same. A source giving examples and explanations. We had those in textbooks already. We don't bank on teachers' knowledge even though teachers are more educated than ever before. Then we get mad when resources dry up or get too expensive, and somehow we blame teachers when more responsibility is taken away each year, until they need to hold someone responsible. I think the biggest issue with anything like Khan is that it's always changing. We used Achieve3000 for one course and it was the absolute worst. It took everything away from teachers yet teachers were on the hook somehow. They just became proctors of sorts."

pillbinge,fe63rbf,t1_fe4wnr3,"I never said progress was bad. What I would urge you to consider is the nature of progress and how it's conceptualized in modern society. The idea of progress tends to be synonymous with an unrelenting march toward very specific goals, and the insinuation that anything to stop it is backward. This becomes more tangible when you hear people talking about globalization and how certain things are inevitable. They aren't. And if you work in specific fields, you end up realizing how flimsily it's all held together. Not only that but many things we take for granted today are very clearly the result of business decisions, not technological advancement. Sites like Facebook and Twitter would collapse into a Tumblr-like mess overnight if they were properly regulated, broken up, and monitored - then fined for their infractions, like with Cambridge Analytica. Has nothing to do with their code.

>But technology has absolutely not reached some kind of limit of it being ""good enough"".  
>  
>You can be a luddite or live like an Amish.

Luddites were named after Ned Ludd. Ned Ludd and others like him protested manufacturing not due to some evil nature, but because their work and future prospects were routinely destroyed based on the power of industrialists who wanted to replace them. Industrialists who didn't give a fuck if their previous employees died or couldn't find work, in the name of social Darwinism (or whatever you want to identify it as around that time; usually apathy covers it).

The same thing is happening today. Advancements are being claimed and yet people are increasingly unhappy, or automation is taking people's jobs and they're left to find worse-paying work and be told that some Libertarian circle-jerk is celebrating.

Even better - according to records, at least 80% of children return after Rumspringa in the Amish community. People who leave a good life with strong social connections end up fucking *hating* the world we live in. This has been true since Europeans touched down in the Americas, where many Europeans left settlements to live like and with the Natives but virtually no Natives ever lived like Europeans. Even the ones taken and given the chance to live for a few years with Europeans eventually all went back.

Your presumptions about human health are staggeringly misinformed, mainly by advertising. That's some cyberpunk level thinking.

>As long as there are diseases, hunger, poverty, as long as there are new frontiers open to humanity, we are not done here. 

Hunger, due to lack of food, is caused by a lack of resource distribution. It's human-made. Poverty is the result of governance, not individual choice. Diseases and viruses can vary but they'll always be a part of our experience. The very ideas of hunger and poverty barely exist in societies that work together, and consumerism/capitalism ensures they don't."

2. We reached the end of Moore’s law years ago and yet the article presents it as something new and on the way compares it with a law of physics when it was just an observation of how frequently manufacturers were willing to update (and therefore reduce demand for) their older processors.

3. It accuses developers for not optimising their software. In reality the process of software development is usually optimised along lines of cost, time to market and some measure of quality (will my target audience buy and use this software, will it be good enough that it is chosen instead of a competitor). Optimising the software for speed of execution or low memory footprint or low network traffic or low battery usage is a part of that quality but how big a part and which of those things should be optimised for depends on the use case.

Software runs on all kinds of devices from watches to laptops to servers and with wildly varying constraints. The article is way too simplistic and shows a lack of understanding of the subject matter."

2) It's not that bad. Yes there are new tools and new frustrating problems. We are learning how to use them and soon things will get much better (see 1) but in the meanwhile, what really have we lost?

If you are angry there are medications and therapists and apps and games and chatrooms. Use your tools!

SublimedCastrato,fdjytxz,t1_fdjvuka,"I agree with you. 

The only way I see things getting better, especially in the USA, is if we have overhaul of the economy and the healthcare system. People with good jobs and good health (mental and physical) aren't likely to become angry alienated people. There is so much real world suffering out there that is systematically ignored by the leadership and political classes, and that pain has to go somewhere. The internet is simply the best outlet for that pain. 20 years ago that suffering was far less, even if the internet was far less ubiquitous."
TwilightVulpine,fdjxual,t1_fdjwniv,"Since the World War 2, hate groups in America have been known to collapse when they got too extremist, as they caught attention of law enforcement. That has also changed in the internet era. As these groups can congregate semi-anonymously and without formal leadership, they can produce extremist elements and still remain after they act. Hence why the US now has prejudice-motivated shootings on a regular basis now.

KKK and Nazis were bad enough before, now they can spread their message and coordinate better than ever. The problems *have* magnified, by the wide interconnection of the internet and social media. The solutions have not. Science is not being spread at the same rate as misinformation is. The mass connections overwhelm people, and rather than generate empathy, they are making people isolate themselves in their own tiny bubbles.

Palentir,fdlof4m,t1_fdjwniv,"I think the Internet is good at removing barriers to group creation.  It's just a tool.  

What kept the groups small in between ww2 and the 1990s was precisely the barriers put up by physical limitations.  You had to meet in person, and recruit in public places.  This puts a damper on growth because there's a lot of physical barriers keeping a hate group small.  You have to live within a drive able radius of the meeting (you thus cannot be a member of the Midwest KKK and live in Australia), you have to feel either strongly enough or safe enough to be seen in such a meeting (because you're probably going to be identified eventually).  It dampens radicalism because of the danger of identification, and because new members will leave and never come back if they think the group is a bunch of radical crazy people.  It also dampens the controls that a group can have on your mental life.  On the Internet, you can reradicalize yourself hourly if you want to.  There's always a fresh new outrage, more memes, more stuff about how your ethnicity is better and how you're being held back by the grand conspiracy.  In the pre internet period, you might have had a tiny newsletter printed out at kinkos once a week.  It's a lot harder to get your rage on if you have a week to cool down in the meantime.  The physicality of the group was an accidental prevention measure for radicalization.  The thing the Internet changed has nothing to do with the group, it's just removing the natural barriers that prevent it from growing to fast or strong.

It's the same thing the Internet did for shopping, in a sense.  In 1989, if you wanted something, you had to plan a trip to the store, go find that item, stand in line to pay for it, and drive home.  With Amazon, you just click on the app, type in the thing you want, and it will come to your house in a day.  It's easier, and probably for a lot of people means that they're shopping and spending a lot more than they would have in 1989 when wanting a collection of the 1980s version of Funcos meant physically driving to a comic book store and searching through their collections to see if they had that brand new rare Kylo aren everyone is talking about."

dCLCp,fdk003d,t1_fdjxual,"I think you are missing a key element which is things \*are\* being exposed now where before nobody was paying attention, no one was capturing the evil things these groups were doing and distributing the info. There is no reason at all not to suspect that everything evil that is happening now was happening before - it just was going beneath the nonexistent radar. If a cop killed a person of color a hundred years ago if it wasn't explicitly legal it was implicitly legal and may not have ever even reached more than a few pairs of eyes and ears. Now, whether or not every life matters, every life is accounted for. There are cameras every where. There are phones every where. What once may have been a quiet murder, or a series of quiet murders by a modestly clever but evil person, has become a single bright streak of violence because the evil person knows they only have one shot and after that everyone will know who they are and they don't get to do evil things any more. This element you are missing - that evil is being exposed - is the element that is filling you with alarm. The evil always existed. It hasn't multiplied, it has merely been exposed and can now be nullified. There is no reason nor real capacity to measure whether things are getting worse because we still do not, nor will we ever know, just how bad things really are. Humans are fallible creatures after all. But in the fullness of time as things become clearer, we are finding out the roots of evil, they are being exposed suppressed and extinguished. 

In the end, as I indicated before, there are more good people than bad. And the only difference is the tools available to the good and evil people. But for the most part those tools are distributed fairly evenly. Donald Trump for example has the same Twitter account that everyone else has. Some random Swedish girl had the same amplification to her voice as the President of the United States. Now how many random Swedish girls, and random Polish boys and random Zimbabweans and Americans who simply want to see a safer, happier, more just world? Innumerable. Likely billions. And how many sociopaths? Many many many fewer. We have the same tools and greater numbers and things can absolutely get better."

""Build The Wall"" convinced white americans to blame latinos for their employment issues. Powerful evil people barely hold a façade of proper behavior anymore, they just enact their whims and are validated. I think it's pretty clear that things are worsening, compared to relatively recent times.

There are more *passive* people than there are good or evil. There are plenty who would sit idly by while horrible things happen. The powerful, especially those who have no qualms about exploiting people, have tools that are much stronger than just the combined good people. It's good that this random Swedish girl got such a strong voice... yet not only her followers are not enough to change the policy that needs to be changed, now this teenager is villified in mass media and social media, because powerful interests can fund smear campaigns to paint an ecologically-conscious teenage girl as a horrible person and a puppet of supposedly shady interests.

I don’t think society has actually regressed much, but the popular narratives about how we live in the best of all possible societies have fallen apart. Going by the polls in the article, the process started around 1966. I believe before then mainstream media were able to shape public opinion to trust and identify with the powers that be. As public speech became more free and equal this became impossible. 

The big surprise for me isn’t what’s happening today, it’s that government and media have suffered 50 years of decaying trust and haven’t been able to do a thing about it.

KNessJM,fe0oknv,t3_enj4h8,"That's one of the interesting things about Neo-Paganism. It's something very modern that draws from disparate older beliefs and cultural practices, and often presents itself as something ancient. Wicca in particular was created in the 1920s and really only gained widespread popularity and attention amongst the New Age folks in the '60s, yet it presents itself as somehow directly connected to ancient religions.

Much of this stuff seems to spring out of a common longing for connection to something pre-modern and thus somehow more authentic, but like a lot of modern recreations of supposedly ancient things, it's sort of a pastiche of decontextualized ideas and practices, packaged in a way that will appeal to modern sensibilities."

It rather seemed to make the case that ancient beliefs were a lot more diverse and complex than the Christian perspective tends to give them credit for, and that to lump them all together into one big pile and call it ""Pagan"" is to do them a disservice.

If it's only art and ideas from the Vatican, then most stuff is pagan. But Christianity and Catholicism have stuck around long enough **because** they've not been so intrusive.

All our holidays are still mostly pagan, and we haven't even eliminated the name. Easter is the name of an old goddess. Fertility was a theme of nature for Spring. And so on. Christmas trees didn't exist in the Middle East but it's a European tradition."

Just a friendly reminder that correlation does not equal causation, and that it is also possible that people exhibit the quoted behaviors without having suffered abuse from caregivers."
BrokenGlassFactory,fdtuz8i,t1_fdtm2px,This mistake would be [affirming the consequent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent).
JustMeRC,fdvxp3y,t1_fdtm2px,"Aside from what the other commenter replied, I find the discussion of what constitutes “abuse” to be relevant. Most of us would associate it with certain types of extreme behavior, but it can also be the daily drip, drip, drip of general stress and frustration, unresolved and without deeper insight, creating a home environment of tension and unease. When it comes in this form, it can be insidious because a child has no physical wounds to point to, no examples of extreme malice to recount: just an overall feeling of daily toxicity. Like a plant being watered with a light brine, it just cannot thrive."
hateboresme,fdtpcom,t1_fdtm2px,"Correlation definitely leads to causation in this case.

Correlation not leading to causation is used when you have unrelated things that haven't been shown to be related. Abuse, abandonment and neglect are definitely correlated with attachment disorders. They have been shown to be related so much that it's just completely accepted science.

That doesn't mean that everyone who was abused has them and it doesn't mean that everyone who has one was abused.

But causation never means that. There are always outliers."
eliminating_coasts,fdzpx2m,t1_fdvxp3y,"I think there's a lot of associations of abuse that are not incredibly helpful; people can treat things they feel they were withheld as intentional malice, when, just like therapies work for one person and not another, it could be that parenting strategies that work for one person utterly fail for another, like carefully planting a plant in acidic soil when it needs base.

I was thinking about this in the context of tribal living vs the modern nuclear family; if you are expected to attach to your parents, or even a single mother, a dyadic model that reflects but also obscures the relationship between patient and therapist, then you could fail to consider those situations where a child would have a variety of caregivers, and go to different ones in different situations.

Anyone who has looked after children for a bit knows that sometimes they really love a specific person for a specific kind of play, or to explore something with them, and go to another person when angry or upset.

It's like a reverse, child-initiated version of good-cop bad-cop, where they are choosing different people to help them deal with different kinds of emotions, showing different sides.

Paradoxically, the very reason that therapy helps, without you having to mentally place the therapist in the position of your parents, may be that we are not really disposed to be parented by a single person, but a mother, father, their brothers, sisters, and *their* parents. To find emotional support and security for exploration from a number of different people in different ways.

Research considering attachment from the perspective of differentiated attachment to both fathers and mothers is still (surprisingly) in the early days of study, with years of assumptions that what should be studied is the relationship to the primary caregiver, who should be assessed on their capacity to provide warmth and emotional comfort to their child. Studies of the differences between how fathers and mothers see themselves and what affect it has are only [just beginning](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14616734.2019.1582598), let alone considering same-sex couples, children for whom grandparents have a significant caregiver role etc. despite the latter representing a large percentage of children.

The idea of a child's attachment network is still ambiguous and without clear results but mainly because there is so much detail to how it works, with parents who both have strong attachments sometimes specialising, but also being influenced by how similar their parenting perspectives were etc.

In the context of this, the focus on subtly abusive parents (not from you specifically, just, you know, in the zeitgeist) strikes me as a little harsh, especially given that one of the other classic causes of a disorganised attachment is a mother who is overwhelmed by the scope of their child's needs, withdrawing and being unable to cope when their child needs them. Couple that with the obvious relationships between household stress and attachment, and it seems more helpful to me to start with the mental model of parents expected to be too much, to be loving and kind and patient, and everything their child needs emotionally to feel safe, and yet also dealing proactively with all the physical and social problems that could cause them to be put in such a dangerous situation, working to support them, getting enough sleep and so on. It's a miracle people come out sane at all really."
JustMeRC,fdzxvh1,t1_fdzpx2m,"> people can treat things they feel they were withheld as intentional malice, when, just like therapies work for one person and not another, it could be that parenting strategies that work for one person utterly fail for another,

My comment wasn’t meant as an indictment of parents who are struggling with or incapable of providing an emotional environment that is more conducive to their children’s well-being. I agree with your overall assessment of the larger sociological conditions, and think there is much work to be done to make parenting more manageable across the board. 

Still, I think it’s important to recognize that abuse doesn’t always look like scars and dramatic scenes. Constant scapegoating, blaming one’s children for the general stressfulness of life, perfectionism, unreasonable or age inappropriate expectations, being emotionally unavailable, etc. are not “parenting styles.” They are adaptive coping mechanisms passed on through families, but over time they can have as deleterious and impact as some forms of abuse that seem more extreme. If you’re not familar with it, though I suspect you may be, you may want to read about [C-PTSD (Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.)](https://www.outofthestorm.website/cptsd-description)

I think the reason to call a spade a spade, is because it really is a societal crisis brought on by the whole of the state of conditions that currently exist, as a result of the lineage that brought us here. It requires a great awakening to make urgent the kinds of changes that will be more supportive to the overall ecosystem.

My experience has been that, while some online communities for adult children who feel they were “raised by narcissists” (as is the most commonly known group for such things on reddit,) can sometimes be unproductive places for venting about parents who range from abusive to annoying, the community members who have had some therapy have helped in many constructive ways. Over time, the “zeitgeist” has improved and many focus more on getting help for themselves than on blaming their parents. That doesn’t absolve parents of their role, but it also doesn’t make the adult child’s progress reliant on their parents’ ability to recognize it or decide to get help for themselves. The idea is to try to improve things moving forward into the next generations."
