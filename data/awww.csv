Scruffy_Pinecone,fe49r7s,t3_enq8z0,My new subreddit r/ShelterDoggos has more pictures of shelter dogs near me that are up for adoption if anyone wants to look. I uploaded them whenever i can
MnemonicMonkeys,fe5o0fq,t1_fe49r7s,I'd recommend having it branch out more than your local area. All you would need is to add a rule that the location of the dog needs to be in the title or body of the post
MnemonicMonkeys,fe5o9qx,t1_fe5o0fq,"My recommendation aside, I love the idea and hope it takes off"

I'm so confused by the title.

Cute pic though."
IntrospectiveSelf,fdz5imi,t1_fdyf6j9,"Yes he actually did....my bf and I have been transitioning our lives together slowly (I came with a 6 year old human boy and a 5 year old canine boy out of a broken marriage)...bf never wanted either pets or children  as part of his life plan. 
My dog lived with my mom and my ex husband for a while. After my ex moved out (I know this will bring up a lot of further questions probably), my mom was no longer able to take care of my dog so my bf said he could stay with us. I was nervous about it because he is a clean freak and was SO paranoid about dog fur. At first my dog wasn't allowed on the couch or any furniture in the house. After some time I would come home and my bf had set up dog beds everywhere around the house for him, even one in his office. It wasn't too long before I began receiving pictures of them cuddling in bed together. They truly bring out the best in each other. And it's beautiful."
fluffykerfuffle1,fdyffx6,t1_fdyf6j9,"no, dog was away at doggy school and just got back."

IntrospectiveSelf,fdzo1gg,t1_fdz9qek,Human child is now with me 50% of the time and dad 50% of the time (we were doing a nesting separation agreement with my mom's home as the nesting home......except he never moved out..)
Qlein,fdykzhe,t1_fdyh890,Thanks for asking about this bc I was - and still am - equally confused. Where I'm from doggy school means going to a training compound once or twice a week for an hour or two and then going back home.

Ihearcrazy,fe99l5l,t3_eo2g37,"They are really cute.
