NataliHolt,fe3gap8,t1_fe3d4g3,100% noone deserves to be shamed for their body
waverlygiant,fe67801,t1_fe3gap8,"Yes. No one knows where someone‚Äôs journey is with their body. I‚Äôm currently a bit fat, less fat than I used to be, more fat than I will be in the future.  I got Graves Disease which made me lose quickly, had my thyroid removed, gained all of it back and then some, then my dad died and I totally ate my feelings. But if a stranger looked at me judgmentally they‚Äôd probably like, hey that person is fat. It erases the humanity of a person. Yes, I know, yeah, I‚Äôm working on it."
eskamobob1,fe5w1hn,t1_fe3gap8,"right up until the point you try and say its healthy IMO. I couldnt give a single shit what a singer looks like at all, but if you start esposing psudoscience (be it healthy at any size or whatever bullshit platro is on now) its all fair game.

EDIT: Not saying she has done that btw. Its just where I draw the line"
SlytherineSnake,fe6dzsi,t1_fe67801,"Hey, sorry for your loss and my condolences to you and your family. Stay strong like you are. Kudos to the hard work despite anyone who shamed you."
Bo0_Radley-,fe6sz6f,t1_fe67801,Do not give excuses!  You‚Äôre going through more at this exact moment than I have accumulatively my entire life.   The fact that you are still here and hopeful is enough to give me strength.
TimeWaitsForNoMan,fe6vnvp,t1_fe5w1hn,"Shaming them ain't gonna make them change their mind tho

You can feel justified all you like, but once you starting insulting and belittling, people dig in."
sum_muthafuckn_where,fe6t708,t1_fe5w1hn,"Health problems from obesity are the #1 cause of preventable death in the USA, and account for 20 times more deaths than gun murders each year. How anyone could possibly think ""body acceptance"" is more important than ending this epidemic is beyond me."
allonsy456,fe8ok5v,t1_fe5w1hn,"Have you seen this woman perform? Dance and sing? That‚Äôs called being healthy and active. She can run around, shake her ass and sing without being out of breath. I‚Äôm much much much smaller than her and cannot walk up a flight or two of stairs without being out of breath and achey all over. I think that‚Äôs pretty clear that she‚Äôs pretty fit. I was far healthier when I was ‚ÄúOverweight‚Äù almost obese than I am now at ‚Äúperfect weight‚Äù. 
Your size is arbitrary to your body‚Äôs health and I really think it‚Äôs kinda bs that people want to keep believing that. 

(And please if you want to start talking about extremes like people who are so heavy they can‚Äôt move. I‚Äôm definitely not talking about that.)"

fartymosscoane,fe4cvje,t1_fe3hpve,"You‚Äôre not her physician, therefore your opinion on her body doesn‚Äôt actually matter.

I‚Äôm not even saying being obese is healthy. But do you really think fat people don‚Äôt hear this message every single day of their lives? Why add to the fat hate? Waste of time. 

How often do you go to the gym? How much alcohol do you drink? Do you smoke/vape? Recreational drugs? Do you lift weights? Do you read books? Do you eat fruits and vegetables? What are your daily macros? How much water do you drink? Do you frequently eat red meat?

Ya see, none of those things are actually my business. And I‚Äôm sure your health is not perfect by any means."
impulsekash,fe3k8xl,t1_fe3hpve,">but they can't go so far as to say that fat is healthy or being obese is natural while being skinny isn't.

That claim is literally manufactured outrage by people who want to win shower arguments.  All the fat acceptance movement is to help overweight people with their self esteem so hopefully they start making healthy decisions down the road."

AbysmalKaiju,fe5kchc,t1_fe3hpve,"People like you bringing up that its unhealthy every time someone says anything positive about it are part of the problem. Im sure you mean well, but no one thinks being overweight is more healthy, its just life for a lot of people. Do you do this every time someone smokes? Drinks alcohol? Has soda?  Let people live their lives.

Someones health is between them and their doctor, so unless they are asking you its not your business."

curiousscribbler,fe5umx9,t1_fe5q9b4,"Oh, in God's name, shut the fuck up. Shaming fat people does not cause weight loss, and you know it. You don't shame people because you give a fuck about their weight. You shame people to make you feel better about your nasty, bullying self."

IamAbc,fe7aozl,t1_fe6vnvp,"It did for me. Not saying it works for everyone. But I was 245 at one point. Getting bullied, friends used to call me fat, kept seeing my pants size going up every few months and I even my dad called me out and was asking how much I weighed. 

9 months later I dropped down to 180. Started to IF, cardio, and eat right. 

Some people just need a kick in the butt"
jay1891,fe7niyi,t1_fe6vnvp,"Shaming can make people change just ask Ed Sheeran he states he lost his weight due to the all comments made about him in the press. Also, a guy once lost a significant amount of weight after his friend texted him you fat bastard every morning for a year."
suicidaltedbear,fe70zu2,t1_fe6t708,"Body shaming only prevents people from actually doing something about the problem, as it stops people from seeking help. ""Body acceptance"" isn't about claiming all sizes are healthy, but rather claiming that it is socially accepted to be of a larger size. Of course obese people should try to live healthier, but if it is a culture of shame and hate, most will hide rather than go to the gym (which is very stressful for most people struggling with self doubt and poor body image) or ask for dietary advice, as this will only bring attention to their major flaws.

To me the body acceptance movement is about it being okay to recognise the issue of obesity.

Of course you have the radical groups who attempt to hide the fact that obesity is an issue, but that is a vocal minority, not a majority."
n1c0_ds,fe3xrtu,t1_fe3i0kp,"It's also weird that we only shame fat people, and not say all the people who sit all day."
ImRedditorRick,fe580wv,t1_fe3i0kp,"I'm sure there are plenty of people who have stories where being made fun of for being fat was the catalyst to their healthier lifestyles. 

There are also plenty of people, at least on the internet, that have posted things about how their obesity is fine, their health problems aren't related to their weight, etc. 

But basically, why? Why tell anyone to their face or post online that they're fat unless they specifically ask you to be honest about their look?"
CelebrityTakeDown,fe65iey,t1_fe3i0kp,And being underweight is actually worse for the body but we praise that
wenchslapper,fe3nq3z,t1_fe3i0kp,"Uhhhh, tell that to the HAES advocates.

That‚Äôs where my hatred lies, however. If you‚Äôre fat and willing to admit it‚Äôs an unhealthy, but still PERSONAL, choice then do you. Eat another pizza. I couldn‚Äôt care less.

But the obese shitheads that try to promote their lifestyle as healthy an acceptable are dangerous to impressionable children. Exercise should be an inherent part of everyone‚Äôs life."

Your appearance does not reflect your personal value or worth."
507snuff,fe8l777,t1_fe7aozl,"The issue is that fatphobia extends into the medical field to the point that people who are fat actually get subpar medical care. No matter what they come in with doctors often just say 'well you have to loose weight first' and straight up don't actually look into their medical issues. This leads to fat people avoiding going to the doctor, which has in turn actually increased the death rate of fat people because their treatable issues go untreated."
thebigbadgreyhound,fe7huc0,t1_fe7aozl,"Yeah, sometimes, I feel like I need a reality check, I need someone to give to me straight, no sugarcoating so I can work towards a better me. That‚Äôs exactly why we have so many self-improvement subs on here."
ran0427,fe8jybt,t1_fe7aozl,"It's just a fine line, I agree that if you are being unhealthy than you probably need encouragement to become so but it should be a case by case basis on whether that's a gentle push or an aggressive shove towards better life habits"
trueGator89,fe8t9h3,t1_fe7aozl,And now they're nice to you? Sounds like some two faced people if you ask me.
TheLocoMofo,fe87m01,t1_fe7niyi,"Just because it helps a few doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a good method. For most people, fat shaming is correlated with weight gain. Eating is often a coping mechanism for dealing with the stress and lack of self worth that results from shaming/discrimination, and people are way less likely to exercise and seek help for weight loss if they feel embarrassed and shameful about their weight."
cravinghummus,fe8ezl6,t1_fe70zu2,Very well spoken.
LuxNocte,fe4uu54,t1_fe3xrtu,"Saw a tweet:

People don't care about fat people's health, they care about putting them down. I have friends fatter than me that are way healthier than me but can't keep weight off for medical reasons or just because that's how their body is."
NataliHolt,fe3ompd,t1_fe3nq3z,How often do you actually see HAES advocates. If there was a significant proportion of people supporting it I'd be more inclined to mention it. In it's an extreme minority whereas the number of people shaming fat people is still very significant.

DudeWheresThePorn,fe3rgf7,t1_fe3n99y,"Getting shamed was what made me stress eat and put on more weight, this continuing the cycle of abuse.

Don't mistake your journey as a benchmark of someone else's. Weight loss is a deeply personal journey."
NataliHolt,fe3nfe9,t1_fe3n99y,While it might have worked for you it's definitely not the best course of action. Negative reinforcement is a pretty poor approach all round.
NataliHolt,fe3px7b,t1_fe3no56,"I'm not fully sure about that, a few guys at my school got stick for being chubby, it definitely seems a lot more vitriolic for women though."
vainbuthonest,fe6wta4,t1_fe3no56,Right? Where are the think pieces about someone like DJ Khalid (not him specifically but he‚Äôs the first person that popped into my mind) or the irrelevant tv trainers going on rants about their weight?

_Not_Bruce_Wayne_,fe8iby8,t1_fe8hgfy,"I think statistically shaming is just going to make someone hate themselves. You wind up raising the chance of suicide instead of raising the chance of them going to the gym. Just be **nice**. The fact that you're calling it *shaming* is telling.

IamAbc,fe92a96,t1_fe8t9h3,"I wasn‚Äôt always fat. I gained a lot of weight quickly, and my friends kept teasing me calling me fat and stuff. Happened a lot and eventually I decided to change myself for the better. Now they compliment me and encourage me."

50M3K00K,fe5liv0,t1_fe42ghn,lol you have no idea how active someone is just from looking at them.
50M3K00K,fe5m093,t1_fe3ompd,‚ÄúHAES‚Äù is just the idea that you can take steps to be healthier without focusing on weight loss. People get mad about it because they hate fat bodies more than they actually care about people‚Äôs health.

n1c0_ds,fe5s11c,t1_fe5n0oq,"I don't think he's hating on his roommate, but rather on how his unhealthy behaviour isn't subject to scrutiny.

JackalTV,fe5sh5w,t1_fe5n0oq,Idk bro I eat what I want when I want and am near underweight and never exercise. I snack almost all day and still eat fairly regular sized meals
Morningxafter,fe5smjq,t1_fe5n0oq,"Oh for sure, and I didn‚Äôt mean for it to sound like I‚Äôm bagging on him. He‚Äôs a good dude and while I wish I could eat like he does and not gain weight like him, I was more complaining that people look at him and look at me and assume I‚Äôm just some lazy slob who sits in front of the tv all day doing nothing but eating junk food, and assume that he works out and eats right. It‚Äôs the outside perception that bothers me. I‚Äôm the one in the gym four times a week, I‚Äôm the one eating salads. He‚Äôs the one playing video games all day with a pizza and a four pack of Monster. Again, not hating on him, I just wish I could have his metabolism is all.

Loud-Mans-Lover,fe64pe3,t1_fe46hxy,"Yeah, and a lot of those fat people have an eating disorder.

We're tolerant of *thin* people with eating disorders!

Try calling an anorexic lazy or stupid, that shit doesn't fly. Therefore, it shouldn't for those under or overweight."
thefreshscent,fe4jtbs,t1_fe46hxy,"Huh? Smokers have been shamed for the last 25 years. That's why way less people smoke cigarettes now.

Remember the Truth cigarette PSAs that were on TV all the time? Unless there is a obesity version of these, you can't really compare it to shaming smokers.

Shit, we even shame them by raising taxes on cigarettes to extraordinary amounts. Australia even has laws where the packaging has to be skull and bones and coffins and shit to shame them when they purchase."
NataliHolt,fe3rhi8,t1_fe3r7oa,You're right on the internet it's very one sided.
_Not_Bruce_Wayne_,fe8ls8m,t1_fe8l85j,"> run across some people in my lifetime where even being positive/encouraging did absolutely nothing

yeah and in my opinion this is why you need to just keep everything to yourself. We're all going to die and nothing matters so let people eat mcdonalds ffs lol"
suicidaltedbear,fe72b78,t1_fe5smjq,"I read a study once that saw a connection between fiddling and high metabolism rate. It is possible that he has small habits that cause him to burn calories quicker that you might not.

n1c0_ds,fe4zlg6,t1_fe4jtbs,Yeah but no one will go in the comments of a completely unrelated photo to cigarette-shame the person in it.
9ghost9host9,fe5hsc1,t1_fe4q51t,"Someone being fat near me does not effect me. Someone smoking near me gives me an asthma attack. I get what you're saying, and glad you move away from people to be respectful, but still not quite the same."

*rimshot*"
IceNein,fe62uwa,t1_fe5hsc1,"Don't listen to the other guy.  I'm sure that fat people feel just as uncomfortable whenever they are forced into cramped situations.  Normal people understand this.

What irritates me about the smoking thing is that the government taxes me on the order of $8 a pack, none of which goes to helping me quit, other than a bullshit hotline I can call for emotional support.  Gee.  Thanks.  My community gets better roads and schools, and I get cancer.  I pay roughly $2000 a year in smokers taxes.  They can't spend *any* of that money to help me out?"
Calzord1,fe3k1bl,t3_enp5ch,Found out who she was from her NPR tiny desk. She is an amazing musician and seems like an awesome person
gHHqdm5a4UySnUFM,fe4e41y,t1_fe3k1bl,I discovered her the same way! Her Tiny Desk set is so wonderful https://youtu.be/DFiLdByWIDY
shadygravey,fe3z62k,t1_fe3k1bl,"So you're saying she is actually out there, showing up to events, performing, instead of streaming on YouTube, lazing around on the couch eating potatoes all day?! Lol

I first heard her on Someone Great on Netflix and loved it. She's gettin' it."
Chrisb5011,fe4q93z,t1_fe3k1bl,"I‚Äôd say she can be an awesome person minus the Postmates scandal where she leaked the delivery drivers name and photo and accused her of stealing her food. 

But yeah she‚Äôs awesome for volunteering to do this for Australia."
caradenopal,fe5fzpk,t1_fe3k1bl,I found her via Terri Gross or some other NPR show.
Turbojugend902,fe62ehe,t1_fe3k1bl,Except that time she put a delivery person on blast on Instagram which cost them their job.  Turned out it wasn‚Äôt the delivers fault.   So she‚Äôs still a piece of shit.
ravekidplur,fe5fv79,t1_fe4e41y,"This just elevated her as a musician to me. She can really sing,  that was incredible."
jmw403,fe5hqr1,t1_fe4e41y,Whoa! I've never heard her music and that was awesome
ONIONFLIP,fe5ic6w,t1_fe4e41y,Wow! So wonderful! Thank you for posting that.

rs_alli,fe5lsux,t1_fe3z62k,"First heard her there as well and I swear that‚Äôs what made that song so popular but I have no evidence, just a personal conspiracy theory"
chr0mius,fe4rkt4,t1_fe4q93z,"I wish she'd given a real apology for that. She was wrong through and through. Even if the Postmates driver had stolen her food, what is someone of her status doing attacking a postmates driver? Everything else about her seems so great but I cannot get over the Postmates thing."
Calzord1,fe6lp0n,t1_fe62ehe,This is the first ive heard of this. I dont know the context but it sounds like an incredibly shitty thing to do. Sometimes when people suddenly gain a huge following they dont realise how dangerous their words can be
vainbuthonest,fe6xc12,t1_fe5lsux,I can get behind this theory. I‚Äôve been a Lizzo fan since Bus Passes and Happy Meals. People were so quiet about her before. I swear once she was on Netflix she was EVERYWHERE and now her older songs are getting so much attention. I‚Äôm happy for her. She worked hard.
beerenjoyer,fe5ef86,t1_fe4rkt4,Yeah it‚Äôs not like the worst celebrity scandal but tbh I think it‚Äôs pretty revealing of some shockingly mean tendencies.
TIFU_LeavingMyPhone,fe54wnq,t1_fe4rkt4,"I hadn't heard about this scandal until now, and I agree it was really shitty to do. But it looks like she owned up to her mistake and apologized on Twitter, promising to be more careful in the future."
Avis_PricklyPear,fe4ylcp,t1_fe4rkt4,"Live and let live, everybody makes mistakes."
Turbojugend902,fe6xziw,t1_fe6lp0n,"Reddit loves to cherry pick shit and post it, regardless of what the person has done before."
chr0mius,fe57n7n,t1_fe54wnq,"I don't want to beat a dead horse, but I felt her apology still disputes the facts which is that she missed the delivery, not the Postmates driver. She posted the drivers name and picture to millions of people and allegedly lied. She should have said more to protect the girls reputation that she put on blast. The Postmates driver claims she was afraid to go outside, the comments on social media were vile. ETA: to add to my point, if you look at her apology tweet, the majority of replies are her fans saying she shouldn't be sorry because that girl stole her food."
jyrkesh,fe55wkj,t1_fe4ylcp,"Yes but it's also good to apologize for your mistakes

That being said, she seems to be on the more positive side of the celebrity spectrum."
TIFU_LeavingMyPhone,fe5brnl,t1_fe57n7n,"Yeah that's fair, she definitely could have done a lot more to fix the situation."
Cherry-Blue,fe5cu3a,t1_fe55wkj,So was bill Cosby until recently
jyrkesh,fe5kim1,t1_fe5cu3a,"Definitely the most extreme example, but celebrities being secretly terrible people is common enough that I don't make heroes out of them

Her song is catchy af tho"
FertileProgram,fe79urz,t1_fe5cu3a,"I'm not saying some singer I've only just heard of is a good or bad person, but automatically comparing people to a rapist as your first possible scenario seems fucked up to me."

Anyone applying the ""fat people lifestyle"" generalizations to Lizzo are completely ignoring the lifestyle she *actually* has, which is traveling around the world for concerts and events & performing at all her shows. How many times have musical performers taken health breaks from the exhaustion that the touring lifestyle causes? She has to have a certain level of fitness and health to be able to do what she does and she obviously isn't the stereotypical fat person."

My doctor noted during my last check up that my ACI is the lowest its been in 8 years and my blood pressure is the best it's been since I was in my early twenties. 

That however does not justify people being ridiculed for being fat.

wildescrawl,fe636q4,t1_fe3wbm2,"She may not be the stereotype, but I give you the example of my mom. She was overweight for 90% of her life starting as a teenager. Up until she was 50 she was very active, worked a job 40 hours a week that required her to be on her feet moving around and lifting stuff all day.

When she hit 50 she hit the wall. Her knees and hips started breaking down from all the strain of the extra weight. She had no cartilage in her knees and is now in a wheelchair. She has also gotten diabetes, high blood pressure, had a mild heart attack and has lyphodemea from all of this. 

Here is ultimately the point. Recently my niece started high school and my mom cried when she confessed to me how angry she was at herself. She had always envisioned herself being an active grandma in her grandkids' lives. Instead, she has spent most of their lives in and out of the doctor, now living in an assisted living center. She cried as she told me how sorry she was that she had missed their entire childhood because of her illnesses.

Everything is fine for Lizzo now. That doesn't mean it will be in 30 years and I would hate to see other people end up feeling the way my mom does."

ETA I never knew Lizzo had so many doctors on her case that were willing to break HIPPA to speak to me about her health.

One last edit to add. Higher risk doesn‚Äôt mean unhealthy necessarily. Meaning fatness is not an illness. It‚Äôs a descriptor. Me being at higher risk for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, breast cancer, and Alzheimer‚Äôs because it runs in my family does not make me unhealthy. Just as being higher risk to heart disease, diabetes, etc etc. does not make someone unhealthy. I know plenty of fat people who are healthy with no underlying health issues. The issue I have with fat phobic rhetoric is that fat people are automatically assumed to 100% have health issues. Which isn‚Äôt true.

TheAudeze,fe4fwe1,t1_fe49tho,"How is this getting upvotes?

Anyone her weight and with her diet is extraordinarily unhealthy and is absolutely destroying their body. I can't overemphasize how incredibly dangerous that kind of weight and diet is. Even if she were to lose all the weight, she's done massive permanent damage to her body. The fact that she does cardio obviously doesn't negate that.

To give you an example how dangerous this is- the WHO daily limit for refined cards is 25g per day and even 2-3 times that (a can of soda for example) will have a significant impact on your physical and mental health. Lizzo is easily consuming 50x that limit daily along with plenty of other harmful junk foods and just the weight itself is destroying your body. She's also likely eating hardly anything healthy and such diet/weight requires a lot more as it both hinders nutrient absorption and depletes them.

Look, if you want to say it's wrong to attack Lizzo for her weight, that's fine - but claiming she's actually healthy is irresponsible and delusional. Please get help if you think this is fine, you have no idea how much your diet and weight is affecting your mental and physical health."

Obesity can both stress a person‚Äôs joints and degrade a person‚Äôs cartilage.  A form of low-grade systemic inflammation called metaflammation is associated with obesity.

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you have good lung capacity, you perform live or do cardio, if you‚Äôre still obese then the healthiness of cardio does not outweigh the unhealthiness of obesity.

You can‚Äôt call someone who‚Äôs obese healthy, that‚Äôs just straight up untrue."

Just by being overweight, you constantly screw up your joints, ligaments, tendons, bones and organs because they're either slowly ground to dust due to constant pressure or because your heart can't keep up and slowly errodes.

What is normalized is the idea fat equals unhealthy and skinny doesn't. I want you to worry about a thin person's health just as much as a fat person's. 

I know you're thick because the mental deterioration of fat people comes from the social stigma of being fat not literally having an increased amount of fat on their body. I couldn't take you serious after that statement."
purpleblinkingcat,fe4kivc,t1_fe4i973,"I don't see you commenting on any posts about underweight celebrities with the same logic, and being underweight also correlates to a shorter lifespan. Perhaps you're... a concern-trolling idiot?

Absolutely mindblowing how someone can seriously say you can be obese and healthy. It doesn‚Äôt work like that. There‚Äôs enough scientific data on this subject ffs

And instead of actually educating people and do things to help people get over obesity, people like OP tell obese people being obese is fine and it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre unhealthy. Now THAT‚Äôs sad. I want to see obese people conquer their obesity, not give them affirmation about how being obese is ok."

DerpyPyroknight,fe4s6d8,t1_fe4kivc,Isn‚Äôt this just whataboutism?? This whole thread is on Lizzo I don‚Äôt really see how underweight celebrities come into this. No one has said being underweight is healthy either.

superalggu,fe7q4zs,t3_enp5ch,Why do people hate her so much? I didn't even know who she was before I saw all the hate she was getting.
jedibratzilla,fe6lg09,t3_enp5ch,"I'm gonna start off by admitting this is a semi-rant. I've seen a lot in my life, and these comments just bring back some very vile memories. But, I'm doing my best to be reasonable and mature. So, take this as coming from a place of experience and honesty, at least as best as I can muster it.

It seems a lot of the negative comments posted here are conflating external ""fat"" appearance with internal health. I've experienced enough life to know those are not synonymous. I still remember a coworker (one of the sweetest women you could know) who often regaled me with stories of her beloved husband who was ""the same weight and size he was in high school"" (slim, seemingly fit). One day, she did not show up to work. Found out her ""fit"" husband had keeled over and died with no warning. Cause? Seems the fat he did have on his body all stored around his heart. Do not confuse size with BMI, cholesterol, and a ton of other screenings that real health professionals perform in order to truly ascertain a person's health (there are a TON of these, and they are quite specific). So nope, you cannot tell on sight. Can you ascertain relative size? Of course. Do you know an individual's health? If you're not a trained professional, nope.

Also, for the love of God (or insert whatever you feel comfy with), PLEASE stop pretending that all this vitriol regarding Lizzo's size is somehow for her own good or because you care so much. While I do accept there are some souls who actually mean well, a lot of ya'll are the same ones who tormented the chubby kids when you were in school.  I am firmly convinced these are the same people who would use the N-word if they could get away with it. Simply put, just another bunch of keyboard cowards serving up their unimaginative putrid mental seepage safely ensconced in their hovels (double-wides, caves, basements, etc.).

AGAIN... I believe SOME of you actually care, but I suspect most of you are coming at Lizzo cuz she's a PRETTY girl who's big: ""She has such a pretty face and great personality..."" (don't you DARE pretend you haven't heard this or something similar before). If she were ""in shape"" (whatever fits your definition of sexual attractiveness) most of her worst critics would be first in line to try to get at her.

*NOTE: Only a hit dog hollers, so if this doesn't apply to you, you needn't out yourself.* I'm just being honest, or at least real. Sorry if it hurts."
Ace0spades808,fe8nmes,t1_fe6lg09,"I agree that people are too quick to judge health based on appearance. You can have health problems, that you caused, at any weight or size. However with that being said, you cannot argue against the health issues/risks generated by being overweight or obese (and for that matter the same with being severely underweight). You may have all 'normal' levels at the time being if you are overweight/obese but that will almost assuredly end eventually. In the same note that people are too quick to judge based on appearance, people are too quick to judge health based on 'normal' levels from the doctor. This is part of the problem with the ""fat acceptance"" movement. These levels are only part of the equation and the other half is your habits and being overweight/obese, not exercising, etc. is not healthy."

I got my husband taken in at the psychiatric hospital years back for the same reason. It was hard, but everything before it was harder. And the care and treatment he received saved his life, and saved our relationship besides.

I'd like to reiterate that you're a great parent, and that you did the right thing admitting your daughter. I hope she also receives the care and treatment she needs. During and after, things won't always be easy, but this is a huge step!

Do take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to seek support for yourself as well, whether professional or otherwise. Don't think, 'Well she's the one who needs care, I've gotta be strong.' It's hard for the loved ones too. You're strong, but you don't gotta be invincible. Let others help support you. <3"

Aaaandiiii,fdlt7ee,t1_fdk83x9,"I don't feel like I have a lot of friends but I have people who I haven't even considered to be friends who suddenly had my back when stuff gets crazy. And then I have people who try to bff me and I'm like ""You do know I'm mad flaky, right?"" and they still think I'm a cool person. But I'm shy and generally enjoy being quiet in the company of one person. So if I ever got my act together, I could have a squad. But I'm good. I like my family a lot."
tech98,fdkaolm,t1_fdk8fl0,"Most people don't have friends on the first day of class. Especially freshman year. Don't worry... that's just going to happen, and it'll stop. By junior year you'll be in more major classes (if it's anything like mine was) and have a cohort of people you study and take classes with.

It helps to either be super smart or dumb. If you're good at the class people will come to you for help, and if you're clueless you'll have to ask SOMEBODY for help. Ask them their name, and get their contact info if they're ok, even just to ask questions about the class or offer to study together. If they don't immediately hate you try to sit near them every time.

You can act dumb if you want... ask your neighbor for help on something if they seem like someone you could be friends with even if you already get it. It's kinda weird at first... and hard if you are kinda introverted like me.  I'm a bumbling fuckhead, but I managed somehow. It's easier than always being on your own... especially if it's a difficult class. You'll get closer to your study friends after the midterm.

Good luck out there!"
tibetan-sand-fox,fdkhz7e,t1_fdk8fl0,"Totally normal. Everyone is in the same boat as you, it's just not always obvious. 

Depending on what you study and what kind of values the university has, you'll no doubt end up in group projects which is prime friend making territory. Agree on a time and date to meet up in the study hall and bring snacks or something. After a few times you can ask them to come by your place to study there and you'll naturally drift to more casual, personal conversation simply because you're not at uni and thus get distracted which is good for friendmaking, but less good for getting things done. It's all a balance. Asking people over is easier if you are a group larger than two people because then you can play host a bit but also not have to worry too much about keeping the other person entertained since the third person will be there. I'd argue group projects and study groups in the beginning of uni is best if you are 3-4. After a while you'll find out who you groove with. 

Additionally, this depends on the culture of your uni and your country, but attend the ""official"" Friday parties (I don't mean private parties, though they can work as well though you'll need an invite). Not all campuses have these though. Even if you're not a drinker, this is the time people relax and have fun so it's a good time to meet them. If you find yourself looking around for people to talk to and you see everyone kind of in groups, don't worry about it. It's not a closed club, you can lean over and start a conversation even if you're alone and they're in a group. You're not strangers, you're class mates. Even if you don't attend the same classes, you do attend the same uni. Point is, you're not total strangers, you do have a connection with everyone who attends the same uni as you. Chances are that if you initiate a conversation then the other person will be curious what you're studying, if you like it so far, how your living situation is going, maybe you moved away from your hometown and so did they. Or maybe you simply share a class and the teacher is kind of an old fart and you can bond over that. 

Especially foreign exchange students are great ways to make friends in my experience. Foreign exchange students are probably in your country to study but they're here to make friends too and they are extra alone since they're far away from their home. Some of the fastest and easiest friends I've made in my life have been foreign exchange students. You have tons of conversation topics easily available too. You're from two different countries after all. Foreign exchange students function well as an entry point to new friends too. Usually they easily make friends because a) it's what they're here for and b) they're different and stand out so people want to talk to them. If you make friends with a foreign exchange student they'll no doubt introduce you to new people.

If your uni has it, then think about different clubs or activities or what you want to call it. In my uni I joined the ""party committee"" (kind of bad literal translation) where I would work for free as a bartender for a few hours every Friday that I wanted to (and I'd get free alcohol at the bars). This way I got to know the other people who worked in the bar alongside me and people would recognize me in class as ""Oh, you're the bartender, right?"" etc which is a good conversation starter. I think we had football teams and DnD groups and what have you too. Your uni doubtlessly has something similar if you look around. This might seem as a lot of ""work"" and time put in, but you won't have to do it forever. But if you do feel like you're a little alone then this could be ways to get out of that feeling.

Don't worry about awkward conversations. Uni is the time to meet hundreds of wildly different people with different backgrounds and personalities. If you're not hitting it off with someone, don't worry about it. Just smile and move on, it's their loss. 

Spend your your time having fun, especially in the beginning of uni. There's plenty of time to worry about the workload and the future and not falling behind etc. I'm not telling you to not study but having a social life is just as important and this is the time where everyone is excited but also nervous like you and you have that in common. 

Last point (I got carried away) is, don't be afraid to change your ways. What I mean is you've probably been in the same high school during your teen years and maybe you're the younger sibling or what have you. I mean that throughout your life you end up in ""roles"" so to speak. Or ""personalities"" that maybe, if you think introspectively, you're not awfully fond of. For example, take me, I was always the quiet, shy, bookish kid in class and I was the youngest child. So because I didn't change schools and because my family is my family, and because I was too young to think about things this way, I thought that was all I could ever be. I saw all these naturally social butterflies and thought that that could never be me, because I'm naturally shy. That's what my mom always told me. I would never be able to easily make friends because historically I hadn't been able to. 

Well, when I started uni I decided to turn a leaf and change my behaviour. I wasn't ""pretending"" to be a different person, although it felt like that in the beginning. I simply began to challenge my perception of myself by doing things I had been somewhat indoctrinated through my adolescence that just wasn't ""me"". Nobody decides what you are like but you. People aren't born one way and then will be that way until they die, or at least they don't have to be. 

I don't know if this ranty advice makes any sense. I only did one semester of uni before I dropped out so my experience really is 95% trying to build connections, so that's what worked for me. I only really attended uni to make some friends and just to have the experience. I knew it wasn't going to be my path so I have no qualms about that. But I don't regret that semester."
kate_wimbledon,fdklodf,t1_fdk8fl0,"I didn't have any friends my entire first year of college, as an out of state student too. It's really isolating and lonely. Joining enough clubs until I found groups of people I enjoyed being with helped a lot :)"
Crashbrennan,fdkr9l1,t1_fdk8fl0,"Clubs are the way to go for meeting people. Join at least one club related to your major, and one that's just for fun. That's the best way I've found to meet people reliably. Otherwise there's just a lot of luck involved."
another-reddit-noob,fdkvfo9,t1_fdk8fl0,Don‚Äôt worry about it. I‚Äôve learned that a lot of college is getting used to doing things on your own. Sometimes you don‚Äôt have buddies in a class and you have to just go yourself. Sometimes your schedule won‚Äôt accommodate a group dinner at the restaurant you really want to try so you treat your own self to a meal. I‚Äôve learned to appreciate being on my own and enjoying my own company.
JeshkaTheLoon,fdlr4na,t1_fdk8fl0,"What I can say is, I made friends by messing up. Like, I went to a lecture in the first week, and there was hardly anyone there. Got to talking with the other people. We eventually found out for sure that the lecture only started in the second week. But I was hanging around with several of these people until the end of my time there. Some I still have contact with.

It's basically that shared situation force you to communicate - which is something I was always shy to do. Might not work for everyone, but if you are in some situation where you all have to figure something out, it is probably the best to make connections. The situation is already something that connects you as a start."

Pariahbot,fdkf6re,t3_elr4ou,"And the older you get, the harder it is.

You‚Äôve been warned young people....."
dinahlou,fdkq4l5,t1_fdkf6re,Your mileage may vary-- I have found it easier as I get older! I care less about superficial stuff and am less afraid to be myself. I am less insecure so I find other people I'm inspired by to be more approachable than before.
briangraper,fdkqmni,t1_fdkf6re,"I don't think it gets any more *difficult*.  It seems that most people just tend to get out less, and meet less folks on a weekly basis.  So the number of opportunities goes down.

I used to have a hard time making friends too.  Then I decided to actively practice it for a few years.  The gym was my choice of venue, since I was comfortable there.  It definitely gets a lot smoother with repetition.  Now I'm like the Mayor there, and can't get in and out without talking to probably 20 people.  Every time we go out in the evening, I'm guaranteed to exchange names and info with 2-3 new people.

So, (like most things in life) all of this gets vastly easier with practice, effort, and not giving a fuck about the outcome.  I'm a 40 year old introvert, who works in tech and spent his whole childhood reading fantasy books.  If I can do it, anyone can."

Dragon_Cat_,fdktcq3,t1_fdkf6re,"I‚Äôm scared. It‚Äôs my last semester in college and I‚Äôve only just now made friends. I‚Äôll probably graduate, lose them all, fall back into my depression and die early."
QNoble,fdlv5os,t1_fdkq4l5,"I‚Äôd agree with this. It may take more time to build history and strong bonds, but people are generally more interested in getting know you as an actual person and more understanding of differences."
ChrundlesRatStick,fdmh7c7,t1_fdktcq3,"Once you get out of school its all about hobbies. Find a hobby you like, find a group of people who get together for that hobby, you got friends. All I need to do is show up at an open mic night with my bass gear and I'll make some friends. If you are into geeky stuff, game stores are a great way to make friends, especially if you are into MtG or DnD. Hell even Pokemon go is an ok way to meet people. The bar is good practice but don't expect to see those people again after the alcohol is worn off and they have forgotten all about you, but that also means the stakes are low there. Really you just need to force yourself to get out there and not worry if it works out or not and you will keep getting better at it. Just like most things in life really."
Dragon_Cat_,fdmhc0d,t1_fdmh7c7,Oh ok. I got league of legends right now so I guess I got that going for me.
ChrundlesRatStick,fdmhi4z,t1_fdmhc0d,Online games are probably the worst thing you can be doing with your time if you want to make friends. Just experiment and see if you can find a more social hobby that is at least somewhat enjoyable to you. Do you like fighting games at all? There are pretty big communities around those games that meet up often.
Dragon_Cat_,fdmhtv5,t1_fdmhi4z,"I‚Äôve always wanted to play DnD. I‚Äôve done my best to search through places like meetup.com but there just don‚Äôt seem to be any in my area. And other than league, not really. I guess I play smash but I suck at it."
ChrundlesRatStick,fdmi2me,t1_fdmhtv5,Is there no store near you that sells stuff like that? Magic cards and whatnot? Most of them have regular events or at least could connect you with someone running a DnD campaign. In a rural area it's going to be the same few people every time which makes it even easier to make friends. Meetup.com is pretty worthless outside of cities.
Dragon_Cat_,fdmj1ze,t1_fdmi2me,I‚Äôll try that then. Thanks!

I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

Instrvmentality,fdlyuvx,t1_fdlakcg,"social media's reallyyy good at making it feel like everyone else is out partying + having fun except for you. it's nicknamed FOMO, or ""fear of missing out."" it's mostly perpetuated by the pressure to constantly post about whatever cool thing we're doing / place we're visiting every chance we get, while never broadcasting the moments we feel depressed or lonely. (no one can really explain where the expectation comes from, but we do it obsessively anyway.)

reaching out to friends/strangers thru text or online forums might help them feel better. endlessly scrolling through curated feeds of other people's lives would not"
24luej,fdmaopq,t1_fdlyuvx,"I'd argue they follow the wrong people if their feed drags them down emotionally, but to each their own. I just know that I'm not quite feeling what you described, be it because I'm a huge introvert and doesn't like going out with other people or being surrounded by strangers or because of the few people I follow.

She's articulating something that is distinctly frustrating about American culture, that we always make things so needlessly complicated, and the energy we spend contorting ourselves for societal expectations is ultimately wasted because it doesn't work and we feel worn out or worse, inauthentic. You'd think a post on a sub like wholesomeBPT would have fewer depressing, nihilistic comments but yeesh. I suppose that's why you and others are on this sub... to feel somewhat better about yourselves and the world around you. However, even the simplest of suggestions or general social commentary is met with undue pessimism. OP is right, and their underlying message of simply being yourself around others and accepting the results of that is essential to being happier.

bleucarebear,fdrjq8y,t1_fdri8sq,"i hear you. you have a point. this is definitely not addressed to depressed nihilist. but as a social worker i believe that phrasing advice in the way that OP did is not efficient and if anything, it makes people affected by mental illnesses feel extremely incompetent because what OP is suggesting is incredibly simple. maybe you can‚Äôt call the person you miss because they‚Äôre dead, or because they were your abuser. maybe you can‚Äôt invite people out because you have debilitating anxiety. maybe you cannot explain yourself to others because they have completely opposing views and can threaten your safety (i.e. if you‚Äôre queer and have homophobic parents). maybe you can‚Äôt speak up when you don‚Äôt like something because you have CPTSD from years of childhood abuse. i hear what you‚Äôre saying, and OP‚Äôs intentions are definitely not malicious, but theres nothing wrong with pointing out the limitations of their suggestions. it‚Äôs not ‚ÄúAmerican culture‚Äù to complicate things. it‚Äôs human nature. we‚Äôre complicated. self-help approaches often forget that years of conditioning and trauma can make a person resistant."
G_Ramsays_crappy_egg,fdrvezp,t1_fdrjq8y,"Yeah, not only is this advice actually incredibly difficult to apply to personal relationships, but you will actually get yourself in trouble if you try to apply it in business, work, or professional environments or relationships with people whose job it is to interact with you.  People with mental illness in particular are not well-served by being open and honest in professional environments, and are usually victimized for being so in personal ones.  In fact, the older I get and the worse the world gets, the more I see that human beings are not to be trusted at all.  The only advice I can really offer to anyone is: love yourself first, get rich, and never make a mistake."
OhKaleNo2,fdrum7t,t1_fdrjq8y,"You‚Äôre applying OP‚Äôs advice to people who have experienced mental illness and trauma... obviously that one tweet isn‚Äôt gonna fix that.

We‚Äôre constantly having to adjust our personas and be inauthentic to fit in to backwards cultural expectations. I think it‚Äôs generally rather toxic for most.

TrulyGobsmacked,fdruqzj,t3_emp28r,"Not to be that guy but I usually am so whatever.

This is a guideline to a simpler life because this only works for the most simple of simple problems.  All of my problems at least have layers of grey areas.  Miss someone? - call them, well what if that person is dead or if that person in a committed relationship leaving you no way to get them back or you both just grew out of each other.  Calling them will do nothing except make it even more complicated and potentially create even worse problems.

Have a problem? - speak up.  Well what if your problems are with global politics? Or with yourself? Or with someone who determines your financial stability? 

Idk that all I remember without saving this post and looking back to add.   I sound like a dick and I probably am, definitely cynical.  I just get so annoyed with these wholesome posts trying to minimize your actual problems but hey, don't worry be happy everything will be ok, just do what they say and everything will be fine."

Its not that easy and you can't do shit like cry or ""you're not a man"" and you can't tell some one you love them because of fear"
phainepy,fdsv6n3,t1_fdsh61g,"You can keep trying. That's what makes us human. Our ability to keep trying. 

It's worse to not tell someone you love them. That regret does sit deeper than if you just told them. Doesn't matter If they say it back. Your feelings don't need validation through reciprocity. If you feel it, Express it."
