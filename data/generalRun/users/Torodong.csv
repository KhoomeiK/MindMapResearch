facepalm,feikg3x,t1_feijoba,1579140609.0,"Yes. But that's not the same as dying from CO2 poisoning.  
It is all to do with volumes of air. If you're breathing into and out of a small plastic bag, you'll use all the oxygen really quickly - maybe 5 breaths. Then, you're out of oxygen and you have a short period of consciousness, then a pretty rapid death.   
If you're in a large volume of air - say a submarine or spaceship - then slowly the volume of CO2 will creep up (as you also use the oxygen). Once the CO2 hits about 8% you begin to experience poisoning. This is a fairly slow process, though. So, although there's still a lot of oxygen, you can die from being poisoned by your own waste products.
  
Edit: I was just pointing out that, in this case, lack of oxygen would kill you before CO2 toxicity because of the small volume of air."

The null hypothesis is the default state.  
At some point humans discovered farming, then they figured out metallurgy, then high energy physics. Prior to discovery they couldn't do those things. The default state is not knowing how to build an H-bomb or a sword, or a seed-drill.     
You cannot claim that a proto-human can do nuclear physics or cast bronze or do agriculture until there is **evidence** that they did.   
The problem is you are assuming that farming is natural. As far as I know, only humans, and a few ant subspecies do farming. 99.999999% of all the  species that have ever existed never figured out how to manipulate other organisms to provide food, so it doesn't appear obvious.   
Noticing something ""natural"" would be, as I mentioned, following your prey animals as they move from their summer to winter pastures. Staying put to try out new-fangled domestication could have been death. Farming is hard and risky. Ask a farmer. Ask a first generation farmer today. They usually lose money for years. Nowadays, a bad year just means a mortgage extension. The credit account of the stone age was death. Agriculture only seems obvious with 2020 hindsight.   
It turns out that agriculture actually leaves extremely strong physical evidence. Not only does that evidence come from the tools necessary for tilling, weeding etc, but also very long term structural, magnetic and conductivity changes in soils.   
A flyover of the UK in a dry summer . for example, can reveal stone age settlements in remarkable detail. You can see prehistoric field boundaries in images taken from space.      
From much earlier periods, coprolites from early humans reveal dietary information. That simply doesn't support the notion of an agricultural diet."

140,000 people died from measles in 2018. That's 140,000 completely preventable deaths in one year.  
As for Americans, probably very few if any died. Most people in the US, Canada, Western Europe are still vaccinated and that prevents and contains mass outbreaks. Intensive care in lovely expensive hospitals can prevent death for kids that are unlucky enough to get infected - so long as they have unlimited access to modern medicine.   
But as you rightly point out, all the dead babies were brown or black or Eastern European, so fuck them and fuck their bereft parents. Am I right!?  
What do you care about all those little graves when you got your nice shiny local hospital. Don't matter to you if you incubate diseases to spread to the poor and the hungry - you got you employer-provided health insurance plan.   
I do hope you at least feel a tiniest bit of shame for thinking the way you do."
science,fdowomv,t1_fdonrg1,1578614590.0,"But settled agriculture clearly does leave very strong evidence. So, while absence of evidence isn't ever evidence of absence, it can be strongly indicative.   
It is possible that small groups could certainly engage in rudimentary settled agriculture and leave no discoverable trace. However, if humans had been widely engaged in agriculture - and all its consequential social changes - then then we would expect to have found traces earlier in the archeaological record.  
You seem to have your evidentiary reasoning backwards. The null hypothesis would be that early humans hadn't *yet* figured out settled agriculture, since it relies on extended co-operation, sophisticated planning and complex food management and storage. It would be incumbent upon you to present solid evidence that they did.   
We have solid evidence of settled agriculture for several thousand years, and nothing before that. If you're suggesting that humans could have been farming for the entire previous inter-glacial period and not left so much and a furrow or seed store for us to find, I think that - while not impossible - is stretching plausibility somewhat. It isn't *impossible*, but extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. They *could* have all been driving electric cars and all the roads have crumbled and all the cars have rusted away but you'd think I was crazy to claim that they did. You must find evidence for technology in order to assume that it was understood at some point in the past.  
You are correct of course that nomads don't just wander. They follow their food supply. Unlike settled agriculture nomadic behaviour is *obvious*.  
While agriculture seems like a no-brainer to us, staying put while your food walks over the horizon would have seemed utterly insane to our early ancestors."

I believe that they fail to develop normally because of poor parenting and never develop a full theory or mind and real human empathy. Therefore, they see anything they don't agree with as a *personal* attack because they are incapable of imagining another person's point of view. For them, everything is personal, because they never got beyond the ego-centric toddler stage of emotional development. ( This is the stage when they hide, as they play hide and seek, by covering their own eyes because if they can't see you, you can't). Imagine that world-view in a grown man.  
Anything that opposes them makes them feel weak, pathetic and vulnerable and they snap like a wounded dog. They're far too cowardly to take any action to make their own lives better and remain forever trapped in a miserable, bitter existence. Their only outlet is this constant, tedious whining and sniping.  
The **real** right-wing.

Having the serendipitous combination of a gentle climate for several years, the right kind of seed-stock close at hand, a good supply of other nutrition in one location (from domesticated animals) with minimal competition from other humans and animals is needed for settled agriculture to emerge.  
I don't personally doubt that early modern humans were capable, but given that huge span of time, it obviously took a while for them to get lucky enough to find themselves in the circumstances to begin to depend on agriculture."

science,fcxdejt,t1_fcw3uen,1578059927.0,"Certainly, you're right. I was referring more to the fact that we're evolved to be generalists.  
I think it is fair to say that our (ancient) diet was closer to the omnivores of the continent and region where our forebears ended up. So, the indigenous people of North America and Northern Europe had access to a diet that was more like a bear's than a chimp's. Unlike other omnivores, they would have had the intelligence and inherited knowledge to prepare and store those foods in more more sophisticated ways. It is great to see solid evidence of sophisticated food handling so long before the movement of modern humans into the temperate regions. It actually raises interesting questions about *why* they were roasting vegetables (maybe the climate at the time was putting pressure on the human diet) and which came first, the growth of intelligence or the availability of dense carbohydrate to fuel new brains. This is evidence of cooking halfway back to the emergence of modern humans!"

The real paleo diet is anything non-toxic that is too slow or too dumb to run away.
