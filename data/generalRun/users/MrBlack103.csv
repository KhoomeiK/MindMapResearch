We were allowed to pat them, but not cuddle them like you see here. Their handlers wanted as few variables in each visitor encounter as possible.

The handler with us had a pouch of cream cheese on their belt. To reward the cheetahs for good behaviour, he would dip his fingers in and let them lick it off. They went nuts for the stuff.

Later on we got to see them chase a lure around the enclosure for their daily exercise. They were pretty damn fast, and they weren't even trying really.
