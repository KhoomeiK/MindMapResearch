sex,ffyqki0,t1_ffxizaj,1580352715.0,"Idk it may have to do with how i was raised, not hungry? Why eat? Not sleepy? Why sleep? And so on, so i guess i apply it to masturbation as well"
sex,ffx18fa,t3_evp4yz,1580315570.0,"Not really, when im bored i think of doing everything except that. My logic is: if you're not horny then why should you, the only time i masturbate for another reasons is because im on my period and even if im not horny i masturbate at least once during the first days to releave cramps.
I know this probably makes me sound dull and boring lol"
AskReddit,ffvurmx,t1_ffvukx0,1580273853.0,"That isn't the part that hurts, vaginas are designed to be elastic and retractable to their original state. What hurts is the contractions and your cervix opening up slowly all while trying to push out a head."

AskReddit,ffvkmfj,t3_evgkjy,1580266338.0,"Bf unexpectedly decided to take me to an amusement park when he had said we'd be going for a run, i was wearing yoga pants and running shoes and i felt so awkward as if people looked at me and thought ""wow who wears gym clothes to an amusement park"" so in the bathroom i asked a random lady if i looked wierd to which she replies ""no you look comfortable and honestly its the best thing to wear when youre going to be walking around all day"" i felt relieved after that."

AskReddit,ffu0idf,t1_fftzr96,1580231843.0,Nooo my inspiration for this joke was thinking of that one episode from the fairly odd parents in which timmy wishes for a society in which men and women were seperate and all the guys were happy and the girls too. (obviously at the end it shows that men aren't just about sports and women are more than just make up and shit and they should live together for emotional reasons) so i thought if women had testicles then THAT would happen lol!

AskReddit,fftzc9n,t1_ffrqxoo,1580231024.0,"Assuming? It was a joke calm down
Because thats what angler fish do! Angler fish females are dominant because the males just turn into testicles which the females use to make babies whenever they want. So if that was the same for humans i just thought “hey then we would become like angler fish!“"
rant,fftz4zg,t1_ffrto9n,1580230887.0,"Well thats because el paso is close to the desert, but it does snow in places with high altitude like toluca which is what its famous for. Mexico has all kinds of climates because the flora is so diverse."
AskReddit,ffrqk6c,t3_euvifz,1580163608.0,"If women were born with testicles men wouldn't exist, we could get ourselves pregnant and be lesbians. Win win, men can live peacefull womanless lives and use sex dolls for sex and women can also have peacefull lives with sex that ends in orgasms each time.
Edit : people it was a joke, i made this joke because thats how angler fish live, they don't need the males to have babies because the males spend their whole lives looking for a mate to just end up as a pair of testicles on the female. The whole post wasn't trying to say that humans are all about getting layed, we have feelings duh"

tumblr,ffpv90x,t3_euk40f,1580107016.0,"This is why i started hating anime, almost svery single female character is either tall with giant boobs or short and boobless, same skin tone, same legs, same thin hands. If it wasn't for their hair and eyes you couldn't tell them apart, the Japanese need to step up their game when it comes to not only character designs but also character personality! Every damn character is the same damn cliche! The tsundere, the emotionless girl, the hyper girl, the shy girl, the lustfull girl and the girl who thinks shes a god. That's just unrealistic, nobody just has one trait and nothing else and i hate that they write their characters like that.
Edit: yes the same goes for male characters and yeah i realize school animes tend to have more tropes than other animes but you can't escape from tropes no matter what anime, there's always going to be at least one damn cliched character.
And to all of those arguing that ""we'll theyre the same age and they are japanese and all japanese girls that age look like that"" that's just not true, real japanese have different height, weight, skin tone, thigh thickness, arm lengths etc. The girls in the picture look like someone copied and pasted the same body and just drew it in a different pose."
