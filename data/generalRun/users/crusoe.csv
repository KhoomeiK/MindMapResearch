Every day do this. Your ADD forebrain needs 'arousal' to wake up. Exercise provides that and also fights stress.

Next, do you drink tea? I drink black tea. You can drink tea all day and it doesn't give you caffeine nerves as much. Oolong is also a choice containing more Theanine which also is a stimulant that won't give you jitters.

Make a list. Make multiple copies. Put them where you see them. Follow them till it becomes a habit. Habits work even with add.

And finally diet. Eat better. Add fatty fish like mackeral or sardines. 

Find other people like you. Find a add support group where people might talk loud or interrupt a bit and no one cares. 

This won't cure you. Your brain is made for a lifestyle that no longer exists. And it's possible to find happiness here and now."

ADHD is massively underdiagnosed in Japan. These creators/protagonists/etc are likely all ADHD.
