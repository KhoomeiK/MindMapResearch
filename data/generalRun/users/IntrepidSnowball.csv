Bodybuilders may look great, but they‚Äôre not the picture of health."
tarantulas,fe9iyvm,t1_fe8d0jx,1578937915.0,"I cannot agree with this enough.

If it had been chill and sitting on his hand the whole time, I would have admittedly felt less nervous, but he had a HECK of a time getting it to sit still, and when he almost dropped it, I thought, ""Uh oh, somebody is about to have a notoriously venomous T crawling up their pant leg.""

It was pretty stunning to see somebody do that at an expo. I suspect this individual has a bit of a lion tamer complex, as he went on to brag about the time he had **8 adult female pokies on him.**

To be honest, I've noticed a pretty marked difference among T enthusiasts online and the ones I meet in person. Last time I visited a local shop to check out their stock, the salesperson told me they started out with an OBT and raved about what a great beginner species it is, and anytime I mention not being ready for OWs, someone is always quick to encourage me to ""just get one anyway.""

Makes me realize how many irresponsible hobbyists there really are."
tarantulas,fe3i4ga,t1_fe3flk0,1578849442.0,"I assumed he wanted to show us he wasn‚Äôt afraid of pokies, or that we shouldn‚Äôt be afraid of them. I chatted with him a bit, and he said they‚Äôre docile as puppies despite their reputation üëÄ

My guess is a novice would just think ‚Äúooh pretty spider!‚Äù and the experienced keepers would think ‚Äúwow what a brave man!‚Äù"
tarantulas,fe3eonl,t1_fe1ulcr,1578848612.0,"I really hate to pass judgment on anyone, but since he nearly dropped it on the floor, I have to agree with you."
tarantulas,fe3dn9q,t1_fe2gjm3,1578848362.0,It was!
tarantulas,fe0aa3z,t1_fe0a484,1578807569.0,"I think he was showing off.

I did not hold it. I did not ask him to either. He just whipped it out when a big enough crowd had gathered, and I happened to be the person standing directly in front of him."
tarantulas,fe057sx,t1_fe03waz,1578803358.0,"It was bolting ALL over the place before he calmed it down, and I was sweating bullets, lol."
childfree,fdpcoht,t3_emkdst,1578625299.0,"I‚Äôm astonished by how calm you are about all this. I would be l-i-v-i-d. Next time she asks to ‚Äúhang out,‚Äù let her know that she‚Äôll need to pay you for your babysitting services, since caretaking is a fucking JOB."
fatlogic,fdkhi8b,t3_elu79r,1578503988.0,"Truly, I wish her all the best in her chosen life of misery and delusion."
IncelTears,fdee5mg,t1_fdebtt0,1578337056.0,"Agreed. Incel ideology has now expanded to encompass the entirety of male suffering (much of which is not even unique to men, but try telling them that), and I think that‚Äôs why there are so many different factions: redpill, blackpill, MRA, MGTOW, etc. 

I‚Äôm still not totally clear on what all of them are or exactly how they‚Äôre different, but I‚Äôve definitely noticed more discourse focused on economic injustice. The optimist in me wants to believe that‚Äôs a step forward. The realist in me knows they‚Äôre already beyond reason."
fatlogic,fd8k5bp,t3_eka5fv,1578219320.0,FITTER is better. Objectively. How could anyone honestly argue otherwise?
fatlogic,fcy291r,t3_ejil8p,1578073805.0,It‚Äôs not the losing phase of ‚Äúweight cycling‚Äù that increases mortality risk; it‚Äôs the gaining phase. Why is that so hard to comprehend?

JUSTNOMIL,fbymbp3,t3_ef6qve,1577220557.0,"Too many JNMILs have an unhealthy interest in their son‚Äôs boners. I hate to say it, but she probably fantasizes about him. Go back to NC."
fatlogic,fbr99up,t1_fbqdubn,1577040685.0,"They also believe they‚Äôre owed sex, and that if they‚Äôre not getting it from the people they find attractive, those people are fatphobic assholes who need to get more woke."
