If i notice its walmart or a grocery store i impress upon them that 5 minutes.  You will get backlash.  I had some B!... tell me that I was unprofessional as someone in the customer service industry to tell her she only had 5 minutes even though she knew she only had 5 minutes.  Lets just say she wasnt back in 5 minutes.

that doesnt really say anything.  If this was a bigger airport, there are designated areas to wait.  Besides that, the driver can start the timer when he is within a \~150 of the pick up pin.

If you got charged the cancel fee, the timer expired.  Also, the app does sometimes lag on both sides (rider and driver).  Its one thing to say ""Oh i see the Blue SUV license plate 129499"" than actually talking to the driver.  I do expect passengers to be actively looking for me and to make an attempt to get to me.  If i saw that you were standing there for 4:55 seconds, before heading to me (and not making it) i would cancel.
