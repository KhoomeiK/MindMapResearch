personalfinance,ff4qrl8,t1_ff4hfwi,1579570190.0,"My initial thoughts as a non-professional, though on my second “owned” residence... 1. discuss with wife and agree on a plan. Suggest sell the home and rent for awhile. Set back  of the money from sale in a CD to serve as a down payment for a new home down the line. 3. Pay off as much debt as you can. Try to re-finance the money. Side jobs if possible. Bunk the kids in same room. If no kids, live in a closet or rent a room in a home. Pay off that debt and save emergency fund. Save 6 months wages. Wife gets job and you save for half of that home. But nicer home than you expected. Over that time, keep your bills paid, don’t use more than necessary (minimalism)? Your credit will build fast. Good luck!"

If I’m right, and I choose to reject the gift of eternal life through belief in the son of God, then I have torment. Supreme deities don’t have to answer to us. We don’t have to understand their ways.
