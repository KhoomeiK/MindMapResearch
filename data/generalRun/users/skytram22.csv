Well, as an emotions scholar myself, guilt is an overarching emotion. You can feel guilt retrospectively, prospectively, or as you are acting. Regret is simply feeling guilty about actions you committed in the past.

Also, guilt and shame are quite different. One can easily feel guilty (I did something that I acknowledge is ""wrong"") without feeling shame (I am not ashamed of my actions).

If they recognize the impact of meat consumption on climate change, that's even better.

You know what has never worked? Attacking allies who are making similar arguments, but using tangible events to highlight the consequences of social problems. How about being part of the solution - convincing people that climate change, as caused in part by meat consumption, is the cause of significant cruelty - rather than pointlessly deriding others?"

In general, we're killing the planet. The rate at which we consume meat contributes greatly to carbon emissions, which further exacerbates these fires which are resulting in so much death and destruction. My point was simply to give a visual of how much destruction and death results from these fires. These fires are largely a result of climate change, and if this imagery helps push more climate-conscious lifestyles, voting, activism aimed at corporations, I'll use it!"
todayilearned,fdhlfc9,t1_fdg4qei,1578425140.0,"From Wikipedia: ""The Mughal Empire was created and sustained by military warfare, but did not suppress the cultures and peoples it came to rule, but rather equalized and placated them through new administrative practices, and diverse ruling elites, leading to more efficient, centralised, and standardized rule."" A better source would be Asher and Talbot's (2006) *India Before Europe,* but I haven't read it in quite some time.

While the emporers of the Mughal Empire were Sunni Muslim, the people of the empire - including the majority of bureaucrats - were not. Their military forces were religiously similar to modern armed forces: they were diverse, consisting of people from a wide breadth of cultures, beliefs, etc. Those deciding on wars, fighting them, etc., were not simply Muslims. 

Contrast this to some notable Christian wars. The multitude of Crusades are obvious, though the atrocities committed by the Knights Templar and other such orders are truly horrific. An assumed 1-3 million died during the Crusades, which just so happened to be started and led by European Christians.

There were other Christian crusades that were committed against groups in Europe that are not included in the Holy Crusades more generally. These include the Albigensian Crusade (up to 1 million killed),

The Thirty Years' War was literally a war between Catholics and Protestants that resulted in over 8,000,000 deaths. It is one of the most explicitly religious wars known.

Christians also led the Taiping Rebellion, which resulted in between 10 million and 30 million dead. The belligerent group, as they are known, was the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, a ""Christian theocratic absolute monarchy."" To this day, it is considered the second most deadly conflict in human history.

One of the most significant wars started by Muslims is the Arab-Byzantine War, in which the brand-new Muslim Ummahs attempted to conquer parts of the Middle East. This resulted in an estimated 130,000 deaths. This is significant, but literally 1/10th of the Crusades, 1/100th of the Taiping Rebellion.

Mehmed II is also listed as an Islamic sultan whose reign resulted in over 800,000 deaths. What wars spurred his violence? Leading a defense against a Holy Crusade when he was 12 years old. The Catholic Crusaders intentionally attacked his domain when he was made the Ottoman Sultan *because they thought it would be easier to conquer and murder a child.* After leading a defense of his people against the this Crusade, he went in to conquer Constantinople, which was a city formed by former Roman Catholic Crusaders that threatened to attempt more Crusades against the Ottoman Empire. 

Who is spreading baseless lies again? Many of the most deadly conflicts in history were caused intentionally by Christians. One of the deadliest caused by an Islamic empire was self-defense. This does not condone Islamic warfare in any way. My point is to explain that Islam has a far less bloody history than Christianity.

Lastly, where did the ""utopia to backwater"" come from? Islamic civilizations were some of the most advanced in history, leading to greater standards of living than almost any of their contemporaries. See Persia, the Mughal Empire, etc."

todayilearned,fdg3fom,t1_fdfz79d,1578378560.0,"Historical context: Islamic caliphates did often tax Jewish and Christian people in their Ummah(casket the jizya if I remember correctly). Christians drove Jewish people out of multiple of their kingdoms, including Israel. Muslims did not. Akbar the Great of India is still revered as one of the most tolerant and successful leaders in known history. When Catholic Spain was in the midst of ethnic cleansing via driving out or murdering Jewish people, the Moors invaded and gave Jewish people full rights as citizens - no taxes, no restrictions.

Post-Judaoc Abrahamic religions are historically violent. Catholics have a history of  the infamous Holy Inquisitions, which continued for 300 years. Islam has an inquisition-like Mihna for 15 years under a 9th century caliphate. The Mihna only involved a few Muslim scholars being arrested - none murdered or tortured. Quite a difference, no?

This does not make Islam ""better"" than Christianity. They both have histories of violence and control. But the history of Islam is less bloody than Christianity."

I can't find the name of the leader who famously did so in India, but I can find his name if you would like.

Islam is a historically tolerant religion. Remember who instigated every single one of the Crusades, despite the fact that Islamic leaders in Jerusalem openly welcomed Christian and Jewish pilgrims. After the Siege of Jerusalem in the 7th century, Muslims created the Covenant of Umar, which, according to Wikipedia, ""which guaranteed non-Muslims freedom of religion, and under Islamic rule, for the first time since the Roman period, Jews were once again allowed to live and worship freely in Jerusalem."" The rights given to non-Muslims were some of the most extensive rights for any religious empire in the world.

On the other hand, when Christians ruled Jerusalem under Constantine, Jewish people were forbidden from Jerusalem.
