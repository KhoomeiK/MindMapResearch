Seablock,fdns44z,t1_fccv3dx,1578591717.0,Updating individual mods like that can break things. That is why it is a mod**pack**. Updates are taken and changes (if any) are made depending on what changed in the individual mod. Youre risking not playing a fair SeaBlock game by blindly updating mods individually (if thats what you meant).

But after it made automating a lot better. The bots definitely carries more by default back then too, but I like this better.

**TO that group:** You are on the wrong side of progress. You are the same people that defended the horse and cart as the automobile was coming out. You have 100 misguided stupid reasons that you're not even personally sure are true and you're going off fear. None of this will have any impact on our astronomy work.

The fact that energy and water isnt 100% covered to all humans is EXCLUSIVELY DUE TO CORPORATIONS AND MEDIA. This isnt hard to do if it wasnt for them. Shitfucks like Nestle stealing water, and fuckwits like Murdoch selling fear so the poorly educated are always fearful of nuclear. 

If it wasnt for these corruptions, we would see near-free energy, near-free internet and near-free water. All of which easily distributed to ven the most remove villages. Dont even think about believing otherwise and start getting angry at them. FUCK private power, FUCK private ISP, FUCK private water. FUCK private agriculture.

They dont see it as ""cheek turning"", like you do. They see it as helping heal a family that clearly needs it that was intimately related with something that just happened to them. These people are uncompresuncompromised humans and most people could learn a lot from them.

basically what youre saying in ""turn the other cheek"", is that you believe that the family is partially to blame. That is what i find sick in todays society. You hold resentment and hate, and it feeds back into itself untill rare people stop their local cycle. Happens too little."

... and some people still do today. But they knew that then. It was risk assessment. Thats where the billions in the media come into play. Look at teh world now. Look at the media. At least a third of the population with access to the internet is compromised. Indoctrinated from their earliest memory. 

The more I live on this earth as this specials, the more sickens I am by use overall. Sure, we have good people too. But I dont think it will be enough.
