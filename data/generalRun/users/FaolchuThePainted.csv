Equestrian,ffcxv7m,t1_ffcxjl9,1579809529.0,Lol yup I miss my boy so much He died and I can’t afford a horse anymore but like I need them to be sane I’m also scared that I won’t love the next one as much and it won’t be the same because he was my heart horse
Equestrian,ffcwq21,t1_ffctoqj,1579808860.0,My horse used to act like this a little when I rode in a bit I switched to riding bitless and he stopped tossing his head at all and listened better honestly he seemed less annoyed when I would ask him to do things and more comfortable over all I never used a bit again actually I have a basically brand new bridle I actually switched because I was a kid and when I’d try to put his bridle on he would lift his head so high I couldn’t reach it then if I got a stool he’d just step to the side and turn his head so I gave up after I had to keep asking people for help and just rode in a web halter I wish I had gotten an actual bitless bridle now but it did the trick
Equestrian,ffcwi7w,t3_esutff,1579808730.0,Lol I got lucky my boy was very snuggly so my issue was that his face would always block out my whole head either that or he would be behinds me with his face pressed into my back but that makes for good pics from the side lol

AskReddit,ff9ywc2,t3_esc8vq,1579724472.0,I would tell them things to remember to keep us from losing people I loved or to keep them from getting hurt  I would move my horse to a new stable so he would’ve never been there to get shot I would tell myself to not listen to my mom and get a therapist so I wouldn’t be so depressed  I would make sure to never leave my old dogs side not even for a second once she started losing her senses that way I can make sure that she dies peacefully with me not alone and lost I’d also give past me my current bfs number just to make sure we still meet with the changes I’ve made to the past  and I would make sure I invited my best friend to go to the barn with me because somehow I got it in my head she was allergic to horses and she’s not...... this has all made me depressed now ugh I miss my pets

Whatcouldgowrong,feq7y6i,t1_feq23lx,1579338625.0,Can confirm this I tried to teach myself and my horse how to jump if I ran him at something at a canter he may jump it but most of the time he’d just step over and knock it down in the process then I try to position him in front of a gate to open it and he tries to jump the fence instead I’m really lucky I had a good horse or I swear one of my dumb ideas would’ve gotten me killed lol

JUSTNOMIL,fed2c26,t1_fecpd57,1578995223.0,Agreed also i have a different perspective than most of the people here because my grandma actually screwed up once and I ended up breaking my arm when I was like two or three my grandma took me to an amusement park type thing right after we had left my mom god a really bad feeling and called to tell us not to go but i wanna say this was before everyone had cellphones but I also don’t think I’m that old lol I’m 21 anyways we didn’t get the call and I ended up jumping off a carousel and breaking my arm the stupid guy at the medical help kiosk broke it more said it wasn’t broken and I was over reacting once we got back to my grandmas house she put bandaids on it and called my mom and my mom heard me crying over the phone and told my grandma to take me to the hospital the difference here is my grandma did something dumb by accident something bad happened she immediately did everything my mom said and to this day i can’t talk about my arm in front of her or she will start crying cause she feels so awful about doing it especially since I am starting to have joint issues in it hopefully your kid is young enough it will be like it never happened tho I will say I dont remember anything about it besides seeing the ground get closer and be kinda blurry like i rolled and like the shirt I was wearing while I was walking next to my grandma and being really really bored while it was healing  and trying to move it after being explicitly told not to lol

Hounds,fdma1h2,t1_fdl3lz1,1578543579.0,Omg I don’t think mine stopped growing until he was like 2 and he went from being the tiniest little thing with little stubs for legs to being build like an antelope he’s part pyre so maybe that’s part of it but like he’s got legs for days it’s so funny cause when he was a puppy I fluffy rug made his legs disappear and now he looks like a deer also your pup is adorable such a cute little belly look at her little belly button it’s so cute
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdle3qk,t3_elolaq,1578522059.0,My dog did this not long ago except  he’s a coonhound and we were home he was just in a different room we are also baffled
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdldigt,t1_fdkot9x,1578521702.0,I wouldn’t have minded doing this with my old dog that being said wherever I went she went cause she decided her job was to give me 24/7 supervision which honestly I probably needed she was the brains of our duo lol but now i have a dog that if I leave him in the backyard he will be done in less than 5 minutes so he’s not allowed outside without supervision and I’ve litterally tried everything short of an invisible fence and even if I could afford one I don’t want to
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdlbu3r,t1_fdkde4m,1578520687.0,I knew a dog that had been abandoned the poor thing refused to leave the house to go on a walk even with the owners he would plant his feet and whine and pull out of the collar and run right back to the door it’s really made me happy that despite how much of a handful he is and my crappy job training him and how depressed I was I never let my mom get rid of my dog when I still lived with them they tried may times to talk me into giving him away but he’s never really gotten very attached to anyone but me and he already has lots of anxiety issues I think giving him away would’ve really messed him up plus he’s my baby and I will find a way to make it work and get us both to where we are ok somehow
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdlb6a5,t1_fdk8ihu,1578520293.0,I wish it were the same in the us I leave my boys in the bathroom while I’m at work because they aren’t perfectly house trained yet and one has stomach problems that cause him occasional bouts of diarrhea and it’s easier to clean it off of the bathroom floor I still hate having to leave them in there alone for that long tho

dogs,fdhd9ae,t1_fdh9f83,1578420297.0,While I disagree with the post above at the same time yes they were bred as fighting dogs but at the same time there are exceptions to every rule I think that either pit bulls should be completely stopped being bred or that the breeding should be heavily managed and they should be bred to breed out the aggression towards other animals this being said I own a pitt he is the sweetest dog in the world would I leave him alone with a cat or another animal he’s unfamiliar with no but I have absolutely zero worries of him just snapping and going on a killing spree one day because that just doesn’t happen the common theme with pit bull attacks is idiot owners not training their dogs and getting dogs they can’t handle yes their are pits that are more prone to aggression but that’s the same for any breed of dog and for their size they are powerful so when they do attack they do a lot of damage the same as if it was a dog significantly larger like a mastiff or a Great Dane I have yet to meet a pit that despite having the perfect owner and life was aggressive and dangerous in general to me at least they seem to be very happy sweet dogs that are very very driven to please and if their owners get a pit to be a guard dog which I think is commonly the case they may encourage aggressive behavior i feel bad for all the dogs in his scenario and op because of the other owners negligence all of the dogs suffered and it’s awful

shittyaquariums,fcsvaxq,t1_fag5dz3,1577926016.0,That’s actually how I got into aquarium keeping I won a goldfish at the fair saw how they were treated after the fact hated it but I had already given them money brought them home in the tiny provided container I paid extra for with the intention of getting them an actual aquarium stayed up the whole night researching goldfish Care and then realizing what I had gotten myself into my mom seeing my distress then ended up spending over 100 dollars on aquarium stuff to try and keep these poor fish alive I named them morph and Levi morph survived 2 days Levi made it two weeks knowing what I know now I think morph died from ammonia poisoning and Levi from every disease known to fish cause like I’m pretty sure he had fungus parasites and internal bleeding I just am happy that he at least had a few weeks of relative peace in his little tiny life they were both only about 2 inches if that big and they were feeder goldfish I also noticed he was very obviously terrified of people he would hide if I was anywhere near the aquarium but he loved my dog I miss them both now I have a planted 40 gal with currently 4 black skirts cause that’s all the store had at the time I plan on getting more but for now they are ok

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fcokkve,t1_f9h4t3l,1577834575.0,I used to do this with my dog that had arthritis she was a stubborn old thing and still wanted to go on hikes with me so I’d let her walk until I could tell she was getting tired and sore then I’d carry her the rest of the way luckily she was only about 15 or 20 pounds at that point despite my attempts to keep weight on her

barkour,fcojiwe,t1_f9id2c6,1577833802.0,Omg thank you so much I litterally have an agility set in my yard once it warms up a little I’mma mow and start doing this with him he’s build like an antelope so he’s probably gonnna be amazing at it just I’m not sure he will fit through the tunnel lol I’ve been trying to do little things to help him more outside play time puzzle toys which are his favorite trying not to get as frustrated with him at times and trying to have little moments of just me and him time and it’s helped. Little bit but because of other stuff my anxiety is through the roof and I think we kinda make each other worse lol maybe I need to take him to therapy with me

velvethippos,fcmqzzy,t1_fckio0d,1577787918.0,I may need to look into this for mine one is a pit and the other a hound pyr mix but the hound is built like a greyhound almost really huge chest with an itty bitty waist so stuff fits him really weird also if it covered his bits he will not hesitate to pee in it
velvethippos,fcmqwet,t1_fclecmn,1577787776.0,I third it

dogs,fcmqix0,t1_fcmq0vt,1577787242.0,I think it’s more the owners to blame than the dog chase is wonderful but we know he definitely wasn’t raised with cats or various small animals so he just thinks a squirrel got in the house and I know what you mean but at the same time if they don’t know how to handle the dog they shouldn’t be adopting it in the first place it’s more of a bad owner issue than a bad dog one like the dog that attacked your dog probably only ever stayed in his yard and was never socialized and just didn’t know any better because his idiot owner never thought hey maybe I should actually take care of and train my dog and after the damage is done it’s harder to fix your right but it’s not impossible some obedience classes precautionary measures and persistence and just some actual effort put in and even the dog that did that could be a good one as far as we know the only issues chase has are he’s a slightly food aggressive which isn’t a big deal because my dog is too so we just feed them seperately and have to be careful about leaving food lying around neither is very bad about it they can litterally sit back to back and chew bones and be fine but he isn’t used to other animals being in the house particularly cats and while we’ve yet to have him loose around a cat he at least doesn’t growl at them anymore so progress I guess sortof also he’s like surprisingly ok around my rabbit I never leave them together but like they accidentally got into the same room and he just kinda sniffed her and looked at me like Mom wtf is this doing here
dogs,fcmp80k,t1_fcmosd1,1577785391.0,.... mines actually a rescue and I think just like with any dog it depends a lot on the specific dog chase actually really likes smaller dogs particularly really fluffy ones dunno why specifically the fluffy ones but I’d also never leave him alone around one while he was really excited cause yeah the way he plays is he body slams the fuck out of the other dog until they play with him I do think pits and similar dogs do kinda need to not really be allowed to play with smaller dogs unless they know how to play cause they get rough same way boxers punch things and shelties go for the ankles it’s just their playstyle I’m really sorry that you ran into one that wasn’t friendly and I really hope you and your dog were ok and that the owner of the other dog took it as a wake up call and got their dog the proper training I know how scary it is when dogs fight and that’s when the two of them are the same size and I know both of them I imagine that was really awful I’ve gotten bit by my two before ones a pit mix the other a hound/ pyr mix luckily neither was actually trying to do any lasting damage and they finally had one really bad fight and they haven’t fought since I’d also like to add that the hound always started the fights (resource guarding issues and general bitchyness lol we are working on it) the first few times the pit just kinda fell over and tried to get away
dogs,fcmoqzd,t1_fcmoowd,1577784714.0,Actually I’ve seen it change a lot of people’s minds my neighbor for one he had heard a lot of bad things about pits and then I forgot exactly how but he ended up with one and you can’t get him to shut up about how wonderful and shiny his dog bob is

PlantedTank,fcmo4cf,t1_fbwfg8h,1577783828.0,Wait that’s aquatic I think my mom has that in her yard..... maybe I should steal some
dogs,fcmhx8h,t1_fcmel78,1577775945.0,Omfg the jealousy is spot on my bfs pit will sit and bark at me and my dog if I give him attention he will also cry while your petting him sometimes because he wants to be held meanwhile he’s 60 pounds of solid muscle he also enjoys laying on me like he’s a tiny little lap dog but he’s not he greatly enjoys the dog park lol I think it’s my dogs own personal hell tho he hates the other dogs he hates the excitement he wants nothing to do with it unless it’s just me and him there in which case it’s boring after the first 10 minutes and he still doesn’t like it he’s a hound pyr mix and he’s bitchy and spoiled but I love him despite the fact that he wouldn’t let me play at the dog park lol
Veterinary,fcmh43u,t1_fcaj3jc,1577775040.0,Lol that’s me only instead I’m horribly broke so I freak out and call my mother over my dogs knee scrape and ask her if she thinks it needs stitches I’m aware that for most stuff I should probably actually see a vet but he’s maimed himself so many times at this point that he is the reason I have a first aid kit and Know how to take care of most relatively minor injuries I’m still kinda mad that the first time he really got hurt she wouldn’t take him to a vet I couldn’t drive and had no money at the time but he had been hit by a car and thank god it just shredded his feet and the rest of him was fine He healed with only a few scars and I’m proud that his feet didn’t get infected at all i changed his bandages every other day and I’d make him wear socks to go outside and if it was wet I put plastic bags under the socks lol I had to carry him everywhere for like a week he’s a leggy as hell coonhound pyr mix so that was interesting now I’m just worried he’s gonna end up with joint problems sooner than he should
Veterinary,fcmg8x9,t1_fc7eavi,1577774110.0,Not saying they weren’t crappy for doing that but maybe they were kinda in shock and didn’t really know what else to say I would’ve been a wreck if this was my boy he got a decent sized cut in his armpit I managed to take care of it myself but it freaked me the hell out
Veterinary,fcmfuym,t1_fc699pe,1577773708.0,While I kinda get that at the same time I think part of being a vet is working with the animals which requires touching them and making it a pleasant experience for them which may require some snuggles and a little bit of playing to distract them and keep them from getting all antsy

Breyers,fcm2k92,t1_fclqlx3,1577762574.0,Got any tips on how to color the mane I’m having issues cause I’m trying to make it not flat black but it has like no detail in the actual model

Breyers,fclq44u,t1_fclpais,1577753741.0,Any ideas what breed I could make her since the coat color isn’t exactly one an arabian could be I think one person suggested a Morab
Breyers,fclpe0y,t3_ehupm6,1577753238.0,Thanks I’ve noticed a few things I did wrong but like for it being my first one I think I did pretty damn good I’m starting on the black points mane tail and hooves now
bipolar,fckyc4p,t1_fckx8zr,1577735816.0,Oh yeah I completely forgot about that cause I have trouble telling with my aunt but my mom catches it sometimes and can snap her out of it I’m really happy your baby is ok mine and me both have anxiety issues and it sucks when they aren’t ok
bipolar,fcku8n1,t1_f8t613w,1577733305.0,I’m a little late to the party but I have an aunt with epilepsy on occasion maybe look into cbd oil cause I wanna say my mom tried something with that at one point and I think it helped a bit most of the time her seizures don’t hurt unless she falls on something or hits something when she has one that’s probably less of a problem with a chihuahua tho sometimes they can give her really bad headaches but the biggest thing is she’s really out of it after so some extra babying her after might be helpful maybe guiding her to somewhere she can lay down and maybe offering her water after a minute or two good luck I’m happy that she’s ok and it wasn’t something worse  also about them being scary I’ve never been very close with my aunt because she’s always been the way she is but after awhile you just kinda get used to them I can imagine it will be more stressful for you because it’s sudden and not something you grew up with tho best of luck to you both tho
