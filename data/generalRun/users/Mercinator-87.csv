I stared at it thought I was dreaming and pulled the cover up over my head, monsters were very real then and went back to sleep. This happened a few times and finally I looked while day light to see where the hole was but never found it. It happened again one night and I got the courage to investigate. I walked over to the light which to me then was one of the brightest lights I’ve even seen yet it didn’t illuminate the room. I walked over to it and put my finger on it but my finger passed behind the hole and the light proceeded to come through. I jumped back in bed and pulled my protective blanket up and eventually went back to sleep. After that night I don’t remember seeing it again but I also avoided looking over there. I can still clearly imagine that piercing light coming from that little hole.

I told them they could stay with me and save money. They never saved a dime even though they only paid a 1/4 of the bills and I even gave them four months free as their Christmas present. They wrecked my place continuously, I’d come home from my 12 hour shift and have to clean because the house was disgusting. Eventually I had enough and told them they needed to find a place to go. It took them three months “to find somewhere” and then another month to get that place in good enough shape to live in, back to that piss poor planning. Then they couldn’t figure out how they were going to move since they both worked and was never enough time. I borrowed a friends truck loaded up the three rooms they occupied and the basement that was by my self (had help with the big stuff) and dumped it in the living room of the new place. My parents told me I should have just found an apartment and let them live in my home since they had a family and I didn’t.
