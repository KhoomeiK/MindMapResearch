KidsAreFuckingStupid,fff5n5r,t1_fff4a17,1579876324.0,"Because she going to fail repeatedly when her dad isnt there to boots her ego.   And she'll become angry and bitter, convinced that everyone is out to get her,  shell never taste real success, then one days shes wakes up. A 35 year old man, with two kids in a dead end job married to a woman you cant stand to be in the same room with.  So you fake your own death and start a new life!  Sure you're working for minimum wage at Burger King. And have to spend an hour a day putting on your disguise. Because you didnt get any of the insurance money from faking your death, and Burger King doesnt pay enough for a bus ticket to the next town, you miss your kids though and occasionally take the longer bus route home hoping to catch a glimpse of them in yard playing. But now theres a new guy around and it angers you.  Sleeping in YOUR bed!  So you burn off your fingerprints, because you cant risk getting caught and running your prints because your in the police system  and you're suppose to be dead,  you go trash his car, why?  Because fuck him that's why!  But the stupid cab driver that lives across the street and keeps odd hours sees you! So you have to run through a bunch of back yards to get away and get bit on the back of your leg by that stupid boxer/pitbull mix on the next block.  You limp back to your 1 room basement apartment, sore, tired and bleeding  not able to go to the emergency room, because you know the cops will be there looking for dog bite victims.   You dress your wounds as best you can praying they dont get infected, curl up on the stained smelly futon you found in the garbage and try and get a couple hours sleep before you have to take 3 busses and walking 30 minutes to your job, and tomorrow is the day they clean out the grease traps.

That's why I dont let my kids win!"

intermittentfasting,ffbp5zo,t1_ffbjve4,1579776739.0,"Not really. I dont eat as many carbs, but I haven't cut them out.  I'm more looking at this as lifestyle change then ""a diet""  if I start cutting carbs and eating like a rabbit I know ill hate it and fall off the wagon,  I'm doing 16:8  didnt change what I ate to start just limited my times  night snacking was always my biggest downfall. About 4 or 5 days in I noticed some weight loss, so I started making healthier choices during my eating window.  Like fruit instead of cookies.  I eat breakfast, usually a small snack mid day.  And my regual dinner.  I've found I'm getting full eating less then I usually did.  Last night I had pizza for example  but only had 3 pieces instead of my usual 3/4 of a pie.  As I progress I'm sure I'll adjust my diet more. But I know myself if I start hating fasting  then I'll stop completely."
