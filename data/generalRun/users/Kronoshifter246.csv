I'm curious what you're source is for this, because I'm not finding anything in any 5e book that makes any statements on this, aside from Slarkrethel. I don't know what your basis is, but it doesn't seem to be rooted in D&D lore.

A kraken is going to demolish just about any tier 2 party, and it's going to give tier 3 and 4 parties a run for their money. I've run the numbers. I'm actually curious about your party composition and level, because I'd really like to run the simulations. I can only get the dpr high enough to survive with 6 fully optimized hands crossbow battle masters, and that's assuming they all have magical weapons and they all go before the kraken does."
dndnext,ff6ptql,t1_ff6n0fr,1579632363.0,"Krakens are only banished permanently if they are native to the Plane of Water. I think it's safe to assume that there are just as many krakens that are native to the Prime Material plane as there are  native to the Plane of Water. It takes literally zero suspension of disbelief to believe that. In fact, the most well known kraken in the Forgotten Realms is native to the Prime Material. This had already been addressed so I didn't bother with it. Thanks for making me. Banishment is a nuisance, nothing more.

The kiting tactic would certainly work. It's not one I would use, certainly, but it would certainly work, as even a party of 6 PCs, all with ways around its damage immunities, would have a hard time dealing more than 120 damage per round to it. And the kraken can more than likely knock two of them unconscious in the first round. Then kill one or more in the next round. If the party starts readying actions to instantly raise downed party members, those are actions that are not going to hurting the kraken.

And that's all ignoring the fact that the first thing the kraken would do is disable the ship. Once the ship can't move, banishment or almost anything else is a total nonfactor. The PCs won't be getting away in 1 minute on a sinking ship, unless they have teleportation circle, which gets them away, but the ship is still done for. Even polymorph won't get them much.

So for your specific scenario, you might want legendary resistance so the very low odds of polymorph going off don't let them escape unhindered, sure, whatever. But to answer your question as to why krakens in general don't have legendary resistance, it's because fighting a kraken anywhere that the kraken will pick a fight gives it such a huge advantage that it really, really, doesn't need those legendary resistances."

dndnext,ff5pd8v,t1_ff5js0z,1579604574.0,"You're running a kraken against a high tier 2 party and you're worried they might outgun it? What?

A martial character at that level that is optimized to the gills for ranged combat won't be dealing more than 40 damage to the kraken per round, and that's if all of their attacks hit. They have a 45% chance of hitting per attack, which means they have a 20% chance to hit both. This is assuming they have a magic weapon at all, considering the kraken is immune to nonmagical weapons. Just using lightning storm the kraken can outstrip the party in terms of damage. If all the PCs are doing to it is damage, the kraken wins.

So we leave it to the spellcasters among the party. Tier 2 goes to 10th level at the highest, so the PCs will have at most 5th level spells to work with. There are only a handful of spells that might delay the kraken to any degree. Those are banishment, compulsion, confusion, polymorph, charm monster, and hold monster. Banishment has a 60 foot range and, assuming an optimized spell save DC, a 45% chance of succeeding on that saving throw. This will buy the PCs 1 minute, during which they will get at most 600 feet away in the most favorable conditions with the fastest ship by the time banishment ends. This distance will take approximately 1 minute for the kraken to close. Good work. Btw, that dimension door tactic doesn't seem too valid to me, as, if it fails, both casters are dead, full stop. Your only real option for banishment to work is a Sorcerer with distant spell. Given that your party is fairly optimized, I doubt this is an option. Compulsion has a 30 foot range and the kraken has a 75% chance to make the save, and it delays the kraken by at most 2 rounds, netting you 240 feet which takes the kraken under 30 seconds to close. Not an option. Confusion is worse than compulsion by every metric, and hold monster will get you even less than confusion could. This leaves polymorph and charm monster. Charm monster only has a 30 foot range, and the kraken has a whopping 94% chance to succeed on its save. This leaves the PCs with one good option: polymorph. It has a 60 foot range and the kraken has a 75% chance to succeed on that saving throw. Not good odds. Especially if the only option to get in range is dimension door, because that's a 75% chance of those two PCs straight dying. And that's if it decides to take the suboptimal route and spam lightning storm at the party. The tactic is sound though, given that the only option for the PCs to even think about escaping is to polymorph it and potentially sacrifice two PCs doing so.

The PCs list of tricks to fiddle with saving throws is literally two items long at that point in the game: bane and heighten spell. I've considered all the options the PCs might have. They aren't many in this scenario. It's literally just polymorph. Especially given that a kraken can quite literally disable the ship in one turn. Then even polymorph won't save them. Since even the lowliest of creatures with a swim speed (you don't want it drowning and then returning to kraken form early) has at least 20 feet, it'll keep up with your disabled ship quite easily. So unless the distance the ship needs to travel is under 2 miles, your PCs are dead. Unless they can cut a deal with that kraken. Without some major homebrew shenanigans, the party is gone. Why completely remove the party's only chance at succeeding? Do you hate your players that much?"
dndnext,ff5hrxw,t1_ff3i73f,1579593461.0,"You say this assuming the kraken wouldn't understand what is happening and play around that. The moment the kraken takes A PC down to 0, the next PCs turn must be to heal the downed PC. Failing to do so will result in the downed PC's death because the kraken can just use its lightning storm to kill said downed creature immediately after that turn. The kraken, being as intelligent as it is, would certainly focus its attacks on the PC that takes its turn immediately after the kraken. By knocking that PC unconscious, the kraken is free to immediately kill that PC, because the only option to survive then is to roll a 20 on its death saving throw. The kraken would then proceed to kill the PC that goes next in initiative, and so on. Only the tougher classes like fighter or barbarian are going to survive a kraken going full blast on lightning storm for more than one round, unless these PCs are 18th level or higher. And I doubt every PC has a method to heal another PC as a bonus action. So there's gonna be some serious action denial working on the PCs.

And that's if it doesn't do the truly smart thing and destroy the ship the PCs are on. As a siege monster it can deal 240 damage to objects per round. Then the PCs are well and truly fucked. This also solves your banishment problem quite nicely, as banishment has a verbal component, which doesn't work underwater, [unless the caster wants to start downing.](https://twitter.com/jeremyecrawford/status/816440444162715648)"

leagueoflegends,feobrke,t1_feo6glq,1579297821.0,"Nah, think of it like differing kinds of modern primates. For instance, we have gorillas and chimpanzees (modern vastaya) which are both pretty advanced compared to lemurs (vastaya tribes like the Oovi-kat), which are very primitive in comparison. Coincidentally (or probably not) this is because lemurs, which are thought to be one of the earliest primates to develop, were isolated on Madagascar when the island was cut off from mainland Africa. Being isolated on a relatively small and stable environment means there aren't many changes, as there aren't many new advantageous adaptations that can develop. This is much like the Oovi-kat, who were isolated on a distant island when vastaya were relatively new as a species.

If I had to guess, when the earliest vastaya tribes started to form from the unions between local humans and vastayashai'rei, the Oovi-kat became isolated, either through choice or circumstance, from the rest of the early vastaya. The rest of these proto-vastaya would continue to advance and develop and interbreed with humans (and probably other Vastaya) until you have modern vastaya like Rakan, Xayah, and Ahri. The Oovi-kat and tribes like theirs don't do that because they're on an island of just Oovi-kat. They only develop a little bit more than their ancestors because they don't need to. Vastaya like Neeko and Nami fit into this category. Then there are others that run the gamut between these two extremes. This is where you get vastaya like Rengar and Wukong. Additionally, since vastaya are descended from both vastayashai'rei and humans, it's safe to say that there wasn't any one single originator vastaya tribe. More than likely there were several different originators that also intermixed to create the modern vastaya. The Oovi-kat weren't like this, being isolated so early. So they're still very special, all things considered.

tl;dr Oovi-kat and modern vastaya developed separately from each other, making the Oovi-kat people's direct descent from the vastayashai'rei, as well as being able to trace that lineage, more special."

leagueoflegends,feo73xd,t1_fekaeg2,1579295980.0,"Literally the only bruiser on that list is Mordekaiser. Swain, Vlad, and Rumble are all battlemages."
leagueoflegends,feo6fed,t1_fem4nra,1579295789.0,"Kinda. Swain is a battlemage, not a bruiser. There's a bit of overlap in those classes, being that they like to build health and have more sustained damage than burst, but I believe most bruisers' autoattacks deal a good chunk of their damage. Swain and other battlemages only really use spells to deal damage. And there definitely are good battlemage items (Zhonya's, Rylai's, Liandry's, RoA, etc). Swain definitely isn't hurting for good items."
leagueoflegends,feo36hy,t1_fenwmd1,1579294552.0,"Again, neither of those were serious suggestions. Guarantee it went something like this: ""Let's give him 25 guns! That would be hilarious!"" Even CertainlyT isn't that far removed from reality."

It should be pretty clear that both of these weren't serious ideas, just spitballing. But people like to parrot that around because ""CertainlyT bad! Updoot ples."""

Edit: u/Deathblow92 edited the original post. It originally claimed that Jax used the lamppost because he got bored of real weapons."
leagueoflegends,fenagrv,t1_fen6hxb,1579280485.0,"Nope. Riot has confirmed that Neeko is vastayan, though she hails from a tribe that secluded themselves early on in their existence, so she's more closely related to the Vastayashai’rei than other vastaya tribes.

Edit: and to pre-empt the request for a source, this comes straight from her [bio](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/champion/neeko/).

> Neeko was born on a remote and largely unknown island, far to the east, where the last members of **an ancient vastayan tribe** remained isolated from the rest of the world. They were called the Oovi-Kat, and **could trace their lineage generation by generation back to the legendary Vastayashai’rei**—the ancestors of all vastaya."

funny,fel4556,t1_fekufii,1579213658.0,I'm pretty sure the FBI keeps tabs on things like this. Turns out psychopaths that kills animals pretty regularly turn to killing people eventually.
