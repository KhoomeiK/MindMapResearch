todayilearned,fg6yhtc,t3_ex6j92,1580579818.0,"I have so many questions. How deep are they? Is it just one wood pile or did they somehow attach 2 together for larger structures? How did they pound an, I don’t know, 20 foot pole into the ground so relativity straight? I can’t imagine how hard it is to wack a wood pole as hard as I could on a ladder. Especially if your driving through rock. Unbelievable."

All of us in the house woke up to it. Parents barged into her room wondering what the fuck was going on. They went in and she faced them and said calmly “Give me.. The.. White dress.” then climbed down and went back to bed.

science,fffeg53,t3_et5eym,1579882171.0,Who “okayed” this project? Is there a reason why someone may want to hear a mimicked voice? Did they have to much funding for a more simplistic project?
