GlobalOffensive,fcou0jr,t1_fcoojye,1577841528.0,"Ha, I can't even remember what that flair means, I have been MG1 forever, I just can't improve consistently."
GlobalOffensive,fcoo5sz,t1_fcok719,1577837151.0,"Ha ha, actually I was playing around the time Jesus was born, but you'd think I would be a BIT better than MG1 after all this time, but consistency is a huge problem, I can sometimes pull off some sick plays, and then I'll have matches where I will get like 7 kills all match, depending on how tired I am etc. You'll be better than me in a few dozen hours, guaranteed :)"
GlobalOffensive,fconir6,t1_fcomp9k,1577836678.0,"True, and there really aren't that many rules to learn, and the game would still work even if they were ASCII graphics or something."
GlobalOffensive,fcond30,t1_fcomtfs,1577836566.0,"Hey man, too right, we just never seem to actually manage to play together though!"
GlobalOffensive,fcokec4,t1_fcoiyya,1577834444.0,"Right? I go back to the first home computers (ZX81, then C64), I've probably played thousands of games since the early 1980s, but never any for as long as CS."
GlobalOffensive,fcoedw0,t1_fcodwvl,1577830204.0,"Yeah, not much, I mostly play Executes, Competitive maybe only two matches per week and I usually do pretty badly as it takes me a few games to even get back into MM, so I almost never get out of MG1, but it's better than nothing."
GlobalOffensive,fco4vnv,t3_ei754g,1577824126.0,"Agree old-timer, 46 years old, been playing almost since day one, best money I never spent, even though I am utter trash at the game I just keep coming back. Only game I play.

Also agree with the beautiful game analogy - very simple ruleset, incredibly complex emergent gameplay. No two rounds are the same, and the possible tricks are endless."
