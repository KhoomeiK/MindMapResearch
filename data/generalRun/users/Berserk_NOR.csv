norge,fg3q132,t1_fg2xtoa,1580487199.0,"Ja og nei. Men la meg ta jernbane. Problemet med jernbane er at infrastrukturen kan egentlig ikke deles. Og når du hakker opp gamle NSB så får du ikke stordriftsfordelene store bedrifter/selskaper har. Ikea f.eks. er billige fordi de er så store. Det forklarer også hvorfor Ford hadde sin egen jernbane når produksjonen var på sitt meste. Den fordelen går ut av vinduet om du hakker NSB opp i 30 forskjellige selskaper.  
 
 Men. Nå har jeg jobbet med NSB og de er ganske udugelige, fulle av byråkrati og annet grums så de har ikke stordriftsfordelene i så stor grad som de kunne hatt.  
Men 2. 
Pengene tjent av ett Norskeid (ett ord?) selskap går uansett tilbake til folket så er liksom ikke like nøye med fortjenesten så lenge det ikke blir dyrere for norge totalt sammenlignet med privatselskap. Og jeg tror ikke NSB er fullt så udugelige. De som evt. mister jobben kan fort bli NAVere og tviler på at de kommer opp i en sammenligning. De jobbet ikke mye. Men de hadde noe å gå til."
