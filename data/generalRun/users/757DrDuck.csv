TheSilphRoad,ffazvlg,t1_ffapy4p,1579748356.0,Why do you care about placeholder names that the public isn’t supposed to see?
TheSilphRoad,ffazf30,t1_ff9pro3,1579748044.0,"Niantic should have made all pokémon eligible to be shiny from the very beginning and kept the shiny chance rare. Instead, they release them little by little, so people naturally feel like they are owed the next one instead of acquiring them naturally and randomly."

I guess there was the one time we hunted Taurus into extinction before Niantic brought them back (and heatmor is probably equally rare as Durant)
