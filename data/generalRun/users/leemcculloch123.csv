Superbowl,fezilet,t1_fewhf33,1579457736.0,"Oh and this is pretty standard practice for any large bird of prey so I forgot to even mention it but obviously a large enough aviary she can fly about freely with plenty of perches to jump between, a small play gym made of logs on the floor and several dog toys carefully selected for safety."
Superbowl,fey3z76,t1_fexuz1j,1579440524.0,"I do pet her and she is soft. You need to be very careful petting them to not damage feathers and they typically dont like their heads or wings being touched. She actually whines if I leave too quickly from petting though (because I need to feed the other birds), it's very sweet."

Superbowl,fexd4jo,t1_fewjt5f,1579428970.0,"You shouldn't necessarily, this was for her own safety and you can see the rope is always long enough to have some slack to it for natural movement. Obviously if theres no reason for it you shouldn't keep them tied up for no reason, which is why she is what we call freelofted or kept without ties in her aviary. We have a river in our garden and are right across from the sea, would be very bad if she got in there at this age. And if she escaped she couldn't find food for herself at this stage either. But also it is debated whether these birds are native to my area or not and until we know she could potentially be an invasive species if released."
Superbowl,fexccao,t1_fewhf33,1579428546.0,"She does not hunt, but she does fly. She's basically trained to 'hunt' my glove. Other than that, lots of snuggles. Shes surprisingly affectionate!"

Superbowl,fevcw2u,t1_feuzuae,1579395862.0,Definitely wouldn't recommend it unless you've got training! Cute but can crush a foxes head with those paws and they have the temperament of wild animals.

Superbowl,feud96p,t1_feu6484,1579385447.0,"We believe mainly size visually, like we do with them, but more importantly to them through the calls they make. Eurasian eagle owls hoot all the time and there's variation in the hoots and hooting patterns between genders. Not sure I know the subtleties well enough to tell them apart that way myself, though.


For a falconer specifically you can sometimes tell by behaviour alone if sight and calls don't work. Females are a lot more difficult to flight train and man down usually, because they're the more dominant gender in most birds of prey. It's where the phrase ""females rule the roost"" comes from, roost meaning nest. If they're older than 2 or 3, you can sometimes tell just because an unfertilised egg can be found. Even if you don't know the subtleties of their call it's not hard to guess then lol"
Superbowl,fetvadl,t1_fettaln,1579380404.0,No worries! Without either years of experience or a DNA test it's super hard to tell genders. Especially with no reference of size (girls are usually bigger)

Hairspray (really good but expensive and messy)

3Dprinting,fet30t3,t1_feofsbt,1579371326.0,"Cold temps could definitely be the problem. Try wiping a heated bed with a paper towel soaked with water saturated with sugar if levelling doesnt solve your issue. Best adhesion method I've found and pretty much free, too."

ender3,fesaacz,t3_eq289r,1579363175.0,What an awesome model and fantastic print. Gonna be a pain to remove those supports though. Might I suggest a coating of a low viscosity epoxy like xtc-3d or art resin or something like that? This will mean you won't need to sand down the layer lines in all those details. The main benefit I thought of though is that it will also help massively with the strength of those spines which I assume will be pretty fragile atm. Had to do this for some barrel pieces for the mandalorians rifle and it helped rigidity massively.
3Dprinting,ferfvha,t3_eq0shc,1579353377.0,"I'm just going to commend them on being a free site with, until recently, zero ads, and even now, no invasive ads from any company but themselves. And as far as I'm aware no paid files they can take a cut of the profit of to keep the site going either. Running such a large, free file hosting site isn't cheap and I can understand why with no monetary gain there wouldn't be much incentive to putting more money into the hardware or paying people to fix the software to run it. So massive commendations to them for the fixes they've done that they really had no actual obligation to do imo. Some of the criticism is obviously warranted, but I feel like some of the criticism of thingiverse I've seen has been going towards choosingbeggars territory."
Superbowl,fequg49,t3_eq06bi,1579346108.0,"Absolutely hate that these kind of videos keep circulating, you should never, ever do this to an owl especially and the bird is visibly terrified."
Superbowl,fequ124,t1_feomx9p,1579346005.0,"This is correct. You shouldn't really ever get an owl wet without good reason and there's especially no reason to have them floating like this. Owls don't have as much (or sometimes any) waterproofing on their feathers as other birds do. This is to reduce the noise they make when flying, but because of this they soak up water like sponges and can become as much as 3 times heavier as a result. Not only is there a risk of hypothermia but if an attempt at flying is made before they're dry they can break a variety of their bones because of the increased weight, in their wings from trying to flap and in their legs from trying to land."
SteamVR,fekfaic,t1_fekdbdu,1579198833.0,No worries! It really is a gem of a game. Can be super frustrating with vive wands sometimes but with the joysticks on the index controllers it's a treat.

As long as theres enough material there that it can build the top layers on top of the failed bottom layers, it'll print fine. It'll be on the inside of the helmet and therefore unseen so who cares if it's a bit crunchy. Just monitor it carefully for the last couple hours."

It's just powdered pencil lead, so you can buy an artists graphite stick and sand it to get the powder as you dont need much. Any graphite powder will work, I think they sell it in small tubes as a dry lubricant for locks and things too. Rub it in, buff it out, makes for a great and durable finish. But you need a glossy surface to get a glossy finish, lots of sanding then a coat of gloss black paint and it looks like blackened chrome (what I imagine OP did), or a gloss silver undercoat for more of a titanium look."

Especially the 5 minute versions. But yeah it doesnt need to be xtc-3d specifically, any lower viscosity resin would work. Art resin I would imagine does a great job, though I wasnt able to find any in small enough bottles for it to be economical over the 15 quid 6.4oz bottle of xtc-3d I found, because this rifle is all I was going to be using it for."

The barrel can be very wobbly even with rod all the way through it (instead of 5cm long pins as maker intended), 3M threaded rod really isnt that strong. I gave it a couple of coats of xtc-3d epoxy and it stiffened it right up. You don't need a lot as it covers more than you think. Put it in a pot of warm water for a bit before use and you'll only need about a third to half of the cheaper 6.4oz bottle for plenty of coats. Really helps me stop worrying the thing is going to break in half on me, and is going to massively help with post processing.

boneworks,fdglg7k,t1_fdfy4ab,1578401295.0,"I came away from the game with the idea it was because Ford is stuck in a sort of time loop, but cant remember any specific evidence in game for this (or even if any exists). But what I've internalised so far is that when you jump into the void, your consciousness is transported out of the real world into the virtual world and you do technically gain immortality like it was hypothesized, but you're permanently stuck in a time loop of the events that lead you there, starting with the gammon usb, so it's a tricksy kind of immortality. Would make sense with intended multiple playthroughs too. The ""look up"", ""this way"", ""sorry"" etc graffiti was all put there by you in a previous loop, the zombies are dead versions of previous yous that weren't successful and the fords are versions of you that were successful in getting to the void, with reigning ""king ford"" being the most successful up until that point. That's what makes most sense to me and was the thinking I had coming out of the game initially, but I remember seeing someones post about the clones simply being due to the quantum nature of void energy. Doesnt really explain the graffiti or why alive fords dont appear until after the void or how you can watch yourself die etc. Not that a time loop is the only explanation for all that, but it's what I came away with."
Superbowl,fdfmau0,t1_fdfgv72,1578364997.0,"Appreciate the extra info, I am from Scotland so not clued up on laws elsewhere. Unfortunate to hear there isn't more strict legislation. 

Obviously as a falconer I'm not outright against people owning birds of prey for the right reasons, but I heavily agree a lot of education and training is absolutely necessary before owning a bird of prey. Especially the largest, arguably most dangerous owl species. Figure if they can crush a foxes head in they'll probably do a number on ours. But people see videos and think owls are just bird versions of cats or something, so I feel a sort of duty to point this ""owls make cute and different pets"" mentality out as a bad idea whenever I see it (not claiming this of the commenter I replied to originally, they were just asking a question)"

He went in the birds aviary before anyone could stop him and started harassing it basically, the bird lunged at him, sank both feet into his stomach and literally pulled his intestines out. He survived but like jesus, definitely not smart. We retrieved the bird safely so medics could go in, he went to hospital, bird was rehabilitated and released.

We have fought for years to introduce some legislation but because falconry is considered a 'historic sport' (yuck) usually done by the rich there are many roadblocks.

Nobody untrained should ever consider getting a bird of prey, legal or not, though. They are wild animals and require really specialised care. We have rescued many because of the attitude they'll make good/cute/'different' pets, and then end up neglected or mistreated by untrained people. Even as a trained falconer I dont own any 'pet' owls, they are all either going through rehabilitation to be released later or cannot be released and must be kept permanently."

No license for keeping birds of prey is required in the UK and as such we rescue a lot of birds from people who think they'll make good/cute/'different' pets, so apologies if this comes off harsh but I see a lot of neglect and mistreatment because of this, so it's necessary to say."

Just in case anyone else stumbles across these its important to mention here you should never let a kid do this to an owl or try to do so yourself. Majority of owls hate this kind of snuggling, it is very rare to have an owl actually enjoy this. Most of the time they very much dislike being touched on the back or wings. Though sometimes you'll get an individual owl that wont leave you alone until they get snuggled. My father (and myself, now) is a professional falconer supervising behind the lens and this specific birdie used to pine for snuggles from me and go in a huff if she didnt get them. 3 birds out of the ~20 we have currently are like this, our barn, western screech and European eagle owl. The rest are either simply neutral with pets on the stomach, or do not like being touched. Even if an owl is snuggly you should refrain from doing so too often as it can damage and de-oil the birds feathers. Even as a kid I'd only pet the birds for a maximum of about a minute at a time, never more than 2 or 3 times a day, usually after feeding. (Not by my own choice ofc but I'm glad my father was strict on this)

Tldr; Basically just dont touch owls especially not like this unless you or a person in extremely close proximity who is in control knows what they're doing."

Source. Interesting that the goldie is only second in dive speed to the peregrine given their much larger size (almost double).

The record for horizontal flight in birds belongs to the common swift (also above).

Bonus interesting tidbit; Another really fast (but not record breaking) bird is the sparrowhawk, which is where the word musket comes from. Musket is an old English word meaning a male sparrowhawk. This style of firearm was named after the sparrowhawk because of the combination of the firearms small size and it's high power and projectile speed."
Awwducational,fczyphm,t3_ejgjeh,1578110916.0,"The primary reason birds of prey cannot turn their eyes in their sockets is not their size or the presence of supportive bone underneath, but that their eyes are roughly cylindrical in shape. Basically like looking through a small telescope, which is also why their vision is so awful up close despite being amazing far away. Coke can vs football is the analogy we give to the kids to describe the shape of birds of prey eyes, although they have a certain.. concavity? Kinda? So a coke can is pretty far from the actual thing cos they look more like earplugs or weird mushrooms but makes it easy for younger ones to visualise why they can't rotate their eyes in their sockets like we can. Super interesting shape though.
 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/NIE_1905_Owl_-_eye.jpg

If anyone is struggling putting just how far they can turn their heads around into a real world context, we often tell kids to look over their left shoulder as far as they can, and then imagine looking in the same direction but by turning their head from the right instead. Roughly approximates 270°.
