1.  You have the skill to be the greatest.
2.  You have the character to be the greatest.

We can mourn the loss of his skill all we want, but he was far from the greatest and shouldn’t be a role model because of that."

socialskills,ffinle6,t3_etn6xt,1579978181.0,"The key is to find the people worth investing a relationship with and then it’s simple after that.  When you find people that seem to have good character: loving, joyful, peacemakers, patience-givers, kindness-havers etc, then you want to invest in them by having repeated positive interactions. 

1.  Relations are time spent together having positive experiences.  Some examples couple be time chatting together over dinner, practicing a hobby, or experiencing something new together.  

2.  Remember, be (mostly) positive.  Leave conversations with a compliment “you really cheer me up” or “your very good at x and should be proud at all the effort you put into it.” 

That’s it.  That’s how to build healthy community!"

Fatherhood,ff2swxl,t3_er9p2e,1579522776.0,"There is a part of you that you don’t know about yet.  It’s locked away in your heart and you can feel some of even now.  It will be unleashed when you hold your child in your arms.  It’s the strength to protect and provide for your family and it burns like the fire of 1,000 suns when anyone or anything threatens your family.  It’s also the same strength that powers your ability to work for them until you  almost faint, serve them until your hands bleed, and fight for them until you die.  

There is nothing in you that you cannot overpower with that strength.  You are already a man, your only challenge is just being who you are. 

Good luck, you can do this.
