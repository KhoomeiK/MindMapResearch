facepalm,fgfikjb,t3_ey4w90,1580739726.0,"Old, stolen from instagram and also very misleading, this is not all true, the woman who donated the kidney did so mainly to preassure her boss for better working conditions, to a point where she didnt bother working because the boss she saved the life of wouldnt fire her, well after something like a year she was fired but not by the boss with a new kidney but by the higher leadership. This is an old and misleading story"
Eyebleach,fgfi6th,t1_fgfgsh3,1580739427.0,"Feeding stray cats causes them to increase in number at a faster rate, which means there are more cats killing city bird populations to extinction (killing not hunting, the cats dont eat the birds and small rodents, just kill them for fun). So feeding stray cats indirectly couses the decline and extinction of local bird population. It may be sad seeing them hungry but this way you are only causing more birds and other small animals to die for no reason. There are some studies if you are interested, shouldnt be too hard to find them"
