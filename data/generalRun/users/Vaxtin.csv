This is what they mean:

They drive around the country cause they’re old and well off. They drive to Iowa Florida whatever and see all these cows living a life on pastures and think it’s like that everywhere. They don’t see the factory farms cause, duh, they’re indoors and nobody wants to see animals being murdered industrially.

So they think most farms are good ones that aren’t factory killing, not realizing it’s a biased cause they aren’t looking inside the farms, and just seeing what is allowed to be."

BlackPeopleTwitter,ffc8r36,t1_ffbzs79,1579794123.0,"Money is a representation of how much work someone’s done. You can’t just print off a bunch of money without increasing the amount of work people are doing, otherwise inflation occurs.

Printing more money puts more money in circulation and lets people have higher monetary values for goods and services than before. However, if productivity or work effectiveness doesn’t increase with it, then the price for everyone has gone up. This is because people “think” they have more money than they did before, so they’re willing to spend more money on things because they think they have more money. It’s not really the seller increasing price because people can afford it, more so sellers selling goods at the highest price that consumers are willing (which is the same thing but it depends who initiates it).

The economy isn’t this entity that knows what’s happening to it. We are all a part of the economy. It’s just human interactions that make it up. It knows money is being printed because people are getting more money without having to work for it. This sounds damn good for just one individual, but if everyone collectively gained say 100$, it’d be really like everyone collectively gained maybe 60 because of inflation. But the exact numbers are nearly impossible to predict, that’s a complete and total guess/example."

EngineeringStudents,fdx1hzo,t1_fdw570l,1578764328.0,"If you have high enough voltage you will get a high current. V= I • R, so with just the 4500 volts we don’t know if it’s enough to kill you, but it probably is. It depends on where you’re putting the electricity in your body (every part of your body has different resistance levels). For example, a tongue has extremely low resistance so you will get high current with high voltage and probably end up dead.

Its both that kills you, you cant have one without the other. A high voltage with low amps will not kill you. A high amperage with low voltage will not kill you. In fact you probably won’t even feel it depending how low the voltage is. But turn up either of them by a magnitude and you’ll die, not because the one you turned up killed you, but because of simple ohms law, if you crank up voltage you crank up amperage and vice versa."

AskReddit,fdp5kpl,t1_fdp4a5t,1578620517.0,"You just said it: rich people get the best healthcare.

Whether or not people can afford it is entirely on the government. You say it’s insurance companies that cause it to be so expensive. As if the government can’t step in and institute policies that make it more affordable. The more people that are involved in an insurance program, the less it costs to be involved in it. That’s why a competitive health insurance market is debatable, it increases costs drastically (as there are more options to choose from, less pooling in one company so it’s more expensive to be in any one policy). But competition encourages technology growth and whatnot... however the medical industry would still be publicly competitive but just the insurance is no competitive. I’m digressing.

To your second point, yeah, if I get shot I can go to the hospital and they’re going to help me out whether or not I can afford it. You still get billed, you still have that looming debt of x thousand dollars that’ll probably last for the rest of your life.

What if you’re terminally ill with a disease and not a fatal wound? You really think they let you stay in the hospital or any other care center while you’re terminal? Only if you can pay or have insurance, otherwise you’re out on the street. Just cause they’re bound to help if you walk in with blood pouring down your face doesn’t make it great dude. It’s awful if you’re poor. It isn’t like that in other countries. The countries that do have universal healthcare actually pay less per capita than the US does for healthcare."

It revolutionized the industry, creating a whole new market over the decades. You can argue that they did not do this, as Ray Kroc developed the company for the majority of its growth. However, if they had not developed this style (they designed a certain flow that made the chefs work like they're in an orchestra--every move was designed to make it the most efficient as possible..it really was nothing like it back then), then Ray would have had nothing to latch onto and to take control over. McDonalds was a sensation in the local areas it was in before they began franchising. The original owners did not want to franchise as they worried about quality control. Ray argued with them, and eventually got them to open up a few. Over time, as they opened more franchises, he started buying the land and eventually gained control over the company.

He talked to someone (a lawyer?) and gave him the idea to buy the property and lease it to the franchise owners. That way, he actually owned not just the store but the land it sat on. He used this to leverage the original founders out of the equation when they started arguing a lot more frequently (mostly because he basically stole the rug underneath them and they had no clue). He might’ve enthralled bought them out just to shut them up, but I think they originally wanted to sue but knew they couldn’t because he had more money and better lawyers.
