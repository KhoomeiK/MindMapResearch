You sound a LOT like me. I like taking nudes, talking about sex, reading about sex, having sex lol. And I'm turned on *thinking* about having sex with people I'm attracted to, but in practical terms I know that isn't going to just ""happen"". I need a foundation of trust and shared emotional connection before I feel good about it. 

In short, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you, nothing you need to fix, and nothing you should feel bad about. If someone asks you (which, like, rude) why you don't want to just do a FWB thing, perhaps you could just explain you lean demisexual."

I don't know, I used to get behind this 100%... now I'm not sure. I'd still consider myself a HL woman and the structure of our marriage as one with a HL woman and a LL man, but I'm to the point where I have to psych myself up for his once-in-three-weeks testosterone surge and the resulting sex. It's not really unsatisfying, I'm actually paying more attention to my own needs so I'm consistently getting off, but the relationship is sandbagged with so much resentment that I have to deliberately FORCE that stuff out in order to have sex. 

I guess what I'm saying is, I want sex and I'm still sometimes saying ""no"". There's the nuanced difference between wanting sex in general and wanting sex with the person you're allowed to pursue it with that the quoted statement doesn't capture."

I'm not really qualified to make a diagnosis, but I'm pretty sure his mom is a narc. She was physically and mentally abusive in ways I didn't fully understand until we'd been married awhile. 

So yeah, I'm not sure if his avoidant behaviors are due to him being a covert narc in his own right or are a battery of toxic coping mechanisms he developed."
