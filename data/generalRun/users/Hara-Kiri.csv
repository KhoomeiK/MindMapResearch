funny,fgxjd9z,t1_fgw5lcf,1581173413.0,"The point is not another cat in their territory. Say the area in question is 40 square miles, which would normally have one wildcat, now it has hundreds of domestic cats with smaller territories. Despite a cat not letting another cat in its territory it's the size of the territory that actually matters here...

In another comment you say I don't know how to treat a cat when you are the incorrect one. A cat may like to be outside, but your cat isn't my responsibility. My dog my like to eat your cat, that doesn't mean it's okay to let it roam the streets."
funny,fgw1vn4,t1_fgvq3lk,1581155767.0,"Maybe you should do as you preach? We are talking about domesticated cats, which are thought to have spread from the fertile crescent region. 

Now wildcats have hunting areas which can be several tens of square miles. Are you telling me you believe there is only one cat owner every 40 square miles? Of course not. So cats are way overpopulated in urban areas *even where they are native to* (which is the point you misunderstood).

I mean this isn't even an argument you know? They are literally classed as an invasive species."
funny,fgvnjdx,t1_fgvn1ln,1581150994.0,"So like the fertile crescent then? Except not even there since cats have large hunting areas naturally. 

I don't have a cat. But if *you* choose to have one the it is *your* responsibility."

But to you the logical course of action is to get one, drastically lower it's life expectancy, endanger driver's lives, let it shit all over people's property and think it's cute as your pet invasive species kills the local wildlife."

Held by most pro-choice people? Source on that then please, I've never heard anyone advocate third trimester abortions in my life. 

My response is a line drawing fallacy? Like *literally the law*..? So the law isn't a  good enough argument for you, but fake news is? And you're complaining about this literal fact at the same time as sticking up for his strawman argument...

I really shouldn't be surprised at people like you being disingenuous but this one is especially impressive."

niceguys,fgiekrw,t1_fgh6ps2,1580819038.0,"Because you can't just switch feelings off. If you love someone and they don't see you in the same way it's very normal not to be able to simply be friends with them. If you're unable to be friends you just stop talking to them rather than whining about it, though. It's a hard but incredibly common situation to be in."
