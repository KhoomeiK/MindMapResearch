Seriously, you let some kids watch porn and suddenly they just make up new meanings for words that don’t even make any sense. 

You can’t be cucked unless you were married to the person who is sleeping with another individual. It is literally being cheating on. Has nothing to do with someone “stealing” your maybe could’ve been wife/girlfriend. 

If there was no marriage between you and the person, you aren’t being cucked.

I’m at work on lunch atm so I can’t really elaborate further to my thoughts on doctors, except that when you look at the criteria for being admitted into DBT therapy for instance. It’s often seen as a last measure for severely depressed individuals (it’s actually for BPD but works well for more than that) only after they have escalated the situation when we should think more about **preventative** mental health measures.

Edit: We have a very backwards approach to mental health, when such issues are a great threat to peoples lives and they are being denied basic medications because they weren’t deemed bad enough until they attempted to kill themselves  1-2 times. It shouldn’t have to get to that point, and yet I know far too many people in this wheelhouse."

Mental health care and insurance companies however? God... utter nightmare. My girlfriend who has had fairly good insurance back when she was covered by her dad's plan has had such problems finding decent care within a reasonable time frame due to what her insurance would and wouldn't cover. 

Not to mention the fact that quite frankly, doctors will not take you seriously unless you escalate to a point at which your insurance will cover therapy to handle problems that you did not have before you were told you weren't bad enough to get covered.

Not that things were better in the UK for her either. She is an EU citizen and the NHS being absolute shit for mental health is why she moved back to the US. 

We do have serious problems and our insurance companies are one of them. There is no literally no reason for all the weird quirks regarding medication, therapy, and coverage that we have—not to mention the difficulties that occur when you don't have insurance and go to Walgreens to fill a prescription only for them to tell you that actually it is $300 for a 30 day supply of something that Riteaid will give you for $20, except Riteaid just closed and Walgreens is the only pharmacy around and you have out of state insurance and can't enroll for 3 more months. 

It should not be complicated and yet, we have so many people who say that it is. It should be easy for the average intelligence American to figure this out. I'm glad there are people who have good insurance where everything works and they don't end up at shitty hospitals with 2-3 month waitlists."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fegngal,t1_fefvpuz,1579097985.0,"Kristen Stewart is so famous **because** gay women think she’s cute.

Why do you think Shane from the L Word looks the way she does? Hint: It’s because that look is popular with gay women. 

She was in my top ten when I was younger. Am 25."
NoStupidQuestions,fegd44i,t1_fegcuhv,1579088366.0,"So have I. I just think there’s more to underlying addiction than simply writing people off as stoners who don’t care. 

There’s a sense of disdain here that I usually always see on Reddit when it comes to weed, alcohol and other drug use that is very not surprising.... 

One would think with all the “I want to die because the world is ending” memes the increasing weed use in American society would make sense."
NoStupidQuestions,fegcspr,t1_feevn0k,1579087982.0,Your comment is kind of rude....

However, you’d be surprised at how many people have medical conditions they simply don’t feel like telling you about. The 3 people I know who use the most weed? All have stomach conditions I didn’t know about until we were good friends.

I had one friend stop smoking and she lost 40lb in about 2 months because eating was painful and I thought she was just a stoner. Turns out she didn’t like taking her opiate medication and she was trying to not smoke weed because of judgement from people like you.

My other friend who wakes and bakes? He has IBS and we didn’t know for 3 years because it wasn’t any of my business.

My other friend who sometimes just takes too many edibles? Chronic stomach condition probably from not having a gallbladder and general anxiety/insomnia.

I have insomnia (and yes I’ve tried melatonin, doesn’t do much, and sleep medications are not better than weed in terms of side effects),  and acid reflux. Weed is great and helps me not drink to feel tired or relaxed. 

A few other wake and bale people I know just have boring retail jobs and terrible anxiety. The weed helps them go through the motions. People might brag simply because admitting they have anxiety can be embarrassing."

science,feezfq7,t1_feenh6a,1579044613.0,"I just think the best point to this is that alcohol is very harmful if abused and if people drink less it is a good thing, particularly with the college crowd.

If I could take back every black out I’ve had and replace it with a “green out” I would. I would take back every single time I’ve had more than 8 drinks in one sitting a relive the stupid times I’ve take 50mg + thc candy. 

Much less harmful overall on my body and mind. 

I can only speak from personal experience though."
ATBGE,fed74q7,t1_fed6yst,1579002033.0,"In hindsight it’s a funny story to have, in person at 18 it’s gross.... when a 45 year old man is making comments about your vagina.

He thinks it’s fine because he’s gay. But well, I’m gay and don’t get my kicks making sex jokes about teenagers to their faces. 

Context is everything."
ATBGE,fed5yuv,t1_fed5kpq,1579000527.0,It’s all fun and games until the 45 year old in your architecture studio is playing porn with woman popping ping pong balls out of their vaginas and questioning all the 18-22 year olds about their sex lives while gay porn and animals fucking plays quietly on his computer in the background in between classes......
therewasanattempt,fea9no1,t1_fe9pc3f,1578946007.0,"True true. I didn't hang out with the people sent there by their employer tbh. I was squarely in the hustling and praying group lmao. Did work out for me pretty quickly, but I have quite a few classmates who've not been as lucky.

I just find it sooo distasteful to devalue how hardworking my classmates were. You get lazy people in every school and every degree, but finance and management are not easy and anyone who says so probably got handed their daddy's company to ""manage"" while they review their fancy instagram shots from last nights party.

EDIT: I should also say that I do not know whether or not MBA's get letter grades or graded on F, LP, P, HP. It is absolute bullshit that your transcript is sealed bc I know for a fact that MBA's and the finance kids in my program all had excellent GPAs that they were required to display on their resumes. I had to bring in my transcript for an interview. The graduate school of architecture planning and preservation is graded on a F, LP, P, HP scale. 

I was in the real estate development program which is basically just the MBA concentration for Real Estate finance. I just say I went to b-school to simply it for people who have no idea that real estate development is not ""becoming a realtor/broker."" 

We take a lot of classes together and basically do the same shit—they just learn a broader array of finance and spend an extra semester (and way more money) on their degrees. I think they also spend a lot more time interviewing than we do because their program is 2 years and 4 semesters. Mine was 1 full calendar year with 3 semesters."
therewasanattempt,fe8ehop,t1_fe8501j,1578925272.0,I am really amused at the amount of misinformation I hear about getting an MBA or doing finance in general. Especially at an Ivy.
