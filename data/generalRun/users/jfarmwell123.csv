Coronavirus,ffhnuwg,t1_ffhnmhl,1579944449.0,Yeah
conspiracy,ffh7ppc,t1_ffh6e52,1579925475.0,Agreed. Just don't buy into the hysteria until we know more. The only other thing that gives this some type of merit is other reports claiming that hospitals are overloaded and people are being turned away due to hospitals being full. I don't feel like this would be the case if there were only a few thousand infected in a city of millions.
conspiracy,ffh5inc,t1_ffh3g8v,1579923682.0,"Or how do u know she's not a Chinese person elsewhere in the world, maybe not even in China and just speaks fluent mandarin and did this shit as a prank or for clout or to see how far it would get?? People do all types of crazy shit for attention/shits and giggles"

90DayFiance,ffh3xek,t3_etdqjj,1579922438.0,I really wish she could learn how to dress properly. All of her outfits are so poorly put together and just as sloppy as her behavior
90DayFiance,ffh3tdg,t3_etf7pu,1579922354.0,He is not that hot
collapse,ffgzvyn,t1_ffg2xlb,1579919370.0,They had a confirmed case in Washington state
NetflixBestOf,ffgtflv,t1_feib0ti,1579914608.0,The reason being is that he had extensive CTE in his frontal lobes. People completely underestimate what affect brain damage would have on ones personality and behavior
NetflixBestOf,ffgtbja,t1_feltv82,1579914525.0,CTE was the major component in why he acted the way he did. 1000% I'm convinced of this. They just glossed right on over that and focused on the fact he was a closeted homosexual. So fucked up as that had nothing to do with why he murdered people and was paranoid about everything
TrueCrime,ffgljvx,t1_fekikkr,1579909035.0,"I really wish they would've focused on this more instead of his homosexuality. I think that just goes to show the ignorance of society in general and the stigma behind homosexuality that still exists. Who cares if he was gay? That's not what caused him to do crazy shit. He had an extensive degenerative brain disease, one of the most advanced cases of CTE that they've ever seen in a person his age in medical history, that likely was a major contribution to what he did and they just glossed over that."
AaronHernandez,ffg9rq4,t3_eqt0j6,1579901523.0,"I don't think anyone's making excuses for him. I think that a lot of people are just trying to understand why someone who seemingly had everything would do such senseless things. And now we know the reasons. He had an advanced degenerative brain disease from traumatic brain injuries (we are our brains, whether people want to accept that or not) coupled with growing up in a violent, abusive household and struggling with his own identity. Tbh, CTE is probably one of the main reasons he was able to do what he did. His frontal lobes were damaged - those with brain injuries in those areas exhibit irrational, impulsive behavior and emotional outbursts because those areas are responsible for executive functioning. It doesn't make sense to us because we have executive functioning, we don't have damaged frontal lobes. But this was someone who was literally not capable of having that forethought, weighing consequences, etc to the same degree as a normal person without brain damage. Without those areas in our brain functioning properly, we would all just be running around acting like children. This is why he scored such a low score on the social maturity scale, why his maturity level was that of a 13 year old - brain damage. He had been playing football since that age anyhow and this is probably when the disease started. I'm not saying he shouldn't have been convicted - brain damage or not he was still a danger to society. However, this sheds light on why he did what he did and also that contact athletes need to have regular brain scans and CTE needs to be better understood so treatment, prevention and help can be offered."

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fff83u3,t1_ffe1esj,1579878076.0,It's probably both. This is fitting esp if u believe that Chris has a new girl
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fff7z9w,t1_ffexq72,1579877989.0,"Exactly. She's always been thin, I highly doubt she works out"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fff7ldk,t1_fff7bw2,1579877725.0,That's right.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffds99b,t3_esns9n,1579827649.0,"I have an IUD and I love it. I got Liletta inserted at planned parenthood for free with my insurance. Insertion is mildly uncomfortable, probably a 4/10. Nothing unbearable. It was worth any amount of discomfort because I legit will never have to worry to take a pill or change a ring/patch, and I don't have hormones surfing through my body. I was really sensitive to other forms of bc triggering severe episodes of depression. I've had no issues or mood changes on Liletta. 10/10 recommend!!"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffdrwzw,t1_ffdj7ww,1579827422.0,But did they have sex at the club or just hooked up after meeting there?
KUWTK,ffdrn5w,t1_ffcyiyf,1579827238.0,"She just doesn't do it for me. I don't think she's ugly at all but no super model. She just looks like a normal girl, average attractiveness. I don't think she's exceptionally stunning"
KUWTK,ffcxjwg,t1_ffcca4o,1579809350.0,She's also extremely plain looking. Like very average. Wouldn't stand out in a crowd. A lot of high fashion models are striking in appearance and usually have a somewhat unique look. She would've never risen to those heights if not for her name and connections
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff9iyht,t1_ff8k8pr,1579714008.0,Exactly
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff9ix64,t3_es4h39,1579713986.0,Just take her off the show then. If she doesn't want to discuss her life then there's no reason for her to be on the show any longer. She's violating her contract.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff6nu6m,t1_ff6njh6,1579631169.0,It is! U really need to be immersed in it to become completely fluent
23andme,ff6hldx,t1_ff68umc,1579627369.0,Oh my bad I misread that in another comment. Gosh darn dyslexia lol
23andme,ff6hix6,t1_ff6hf3a,1579627327.0,Well I hope ur doing okay with the news! I'm sure this is blowing up in a lot of donors and adoptive parents faces due to the new technology
90DayFiance,ff655l7,t3_erp5ie,1579619379.0,He's definitely not hot enough to be a bachelor.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff624qw,t1_ff61mwr,1579617207.0,Really at her age she'd need to live in a country that speaks the language she's trying to learn
23andme,ff61hn5,t3_erhv2y,1579616727.0,How much?
23andme,ff61czc,t1_ff5l49q,1579616629.0,Wow. That's amazing. Richard hatch from survivor is ur bio dad...all found out through 23andme. So your parents never would've told you otherwise?
23andme,ff616u8,t1_ff539m9,1579616499.0,Looking at ur picture I honestly thought u might be mixed with black (I'm mixed myself). I think it's your hair color and the slight tint of olive in your skin. But honestly that probably comes from the Jewish
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff565ms,t1_ff55sk3,1579581334.0,Idk what is up with these girls and all these makeup lines. You are not the Kardashians. Get real and get a real job
