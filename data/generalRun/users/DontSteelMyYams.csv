AskReddit,ffveffa,t3_ev5zdg,1580262186.0,"I want to start my comment by saying I’m not trying to look for pity or sympathy of any kind (plus this post is on popular so I’m assuming my comment will be lost in the ocean), but I cried because of how lonely I’ve been feeling lately. It’s therapeutic to just say it out in the void like that. I hope you all are having a wonderful day :)"
