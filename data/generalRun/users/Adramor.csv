gaming,ffeiee2,t1_ffehoj1,1579849256.0,"I see your point but I don't think that applies for several reasons:

1. You're assuming OP is comfortably wealthy

2.  A Famous band has fans that would know about the concert ahead of time, this Xbox deal would only be known by the handful of people that go into GameStop.  (If there were a lot of people shopping at this GameStop I don't think they would going out of business)

3. Opportunist or asshole in your example relies completely on the markup percentage.  The person who buys the tickets for resale is spending time and money, which is worth x amount of dollars.  Let's say the band is tool and you know the tickets go on sale at 10:00 on Tuesday.  But you're at work at 10:00 on Tuesday because you're a real person who has a real job.  You're unable to buy those tickets when they are on sale.  By the time you are off work and can buy them, damn they sold out.  But hey opp or ah is reselling them, awesome, now you have a chance to go to this concert.  

Another big difference is, in ticket resale you can set whatever price you want.  You can sell $30 tickets for $100 (asshole), or you can sell $30 tickets for $45 (opposrtunist).  OP is only able to ""return/sell"" the xbox's at the return value that is set by GameStop, who also happens to be the seller of the goods."
gaming,ffehjgc,t1_ffeh7b3,1579848258.0,"Well I don't feel like looking through your post history so have a good night friend.  I was just curious why you think OP is a bad person for taking an opportunity that was in front of them. 

So if I'm at Target tomorrow and I find the last shirt on sale I like, am I a bad person if I buy it?  I would be cheating the next person who wants that shirt out of the opportunity to buy it."
gaming,ffeh3bl,t1_ffegyu5,1579847749.0,I've never said anything can't exist.  But I don't agree that this is amoral in any way.  You believe what OP did is amoral?  Do you think he is a bad person because of his actions?
gaming,ffegusl,t1_ffegs44,1579847489.0,How many people do you really think got cheated by op!  He only did this to 8 xbox's! You're not disputing anything I said!  What exactly are you upset about?
gaming,ffegqvw,t1_ffegj8l,1579847372.0,"I'm saying that the poor person who has $200, but not quite $300, who went to that one GameStop between the time of OP doing everything, and that one specific GameStop closing, is probably hypothetical yes."
gaming,ffegg94,t1_ffeg6n2,1579847043.0,"If you're poor you shouldn't go to GameStop to buy old games, you can get them much cheaper elsewhere.  I know because I am poor and do this.  

But regarding your response, you're upset for the maybe 1 or 2 people behind OP in line?  I just don't understand the strawman hypothetical poor person running around shopping in overpriced stores that you are upset for."
gaming,ffeedvx,t1_ffeb8vl,1579844892.0,Who did he screw exactly?  The crowds of people hanging around in GameStop? Quit hating.
gaming,ffee68j,t1_ffedqbq,1579844681.0,"Also, if you don't have the spare money to buy one, why the fuck would you ever go into a a GameStop and look at xbox's?  All the people getting upset are kind of ridiculous, those people that they are saying are missing out would never see this deal anyway.  If you haven't been able to save up and buy an Xbox at this point, you really need to learn how to handle your money."
gaming,ffede7i,t1_ffe6xgy,1579843923.0,"I think what they mean is, if you can't spare a couple hundred dollars (for something's that's been around for what, 5 years now? That's a lot of time to save that money up) Than you have bigger priorities than gaming."
gaming,ffed77d,t1_ffe1mjd,1579843742.0,"If at this point you haven't been able to save up the money to get an Xbox, you're better off waiting and saving those pennies to get the new Xbox that I think comes out at the end of this year?  Or learn to manage your money better."

TwoXChromosomes,fcmfzvu,t3_ehlo0t,1577773848.0,"Cvs has overpriced goods.  Pretty much everything there is kind of ridiculous.  You can get the cvs brand knock off of this product for $8.99.....or you can get the real product at a different store in a bigger size for $6.


Plus if you buy one item you can literally get 1.5' of receipt, not to mention every cvs I've ever been to has one register open with 7 people in line so it takes 20 goddamn minutes to get my damn cough syrup.

Now that I think about fuck that place, the name is a huge middle finger (I believe it stands for consumer value services)."
