2meirl4meirl,fejijvl,t1_fegkpvz,1579175797.0,"Having a stronger family core does not mean you will live an ""easier life"", because most other aspects of life are tougher to go through than in western countries where there are whole systems developed to help the underpriviledged. Bigger percentage of people are poorer which means they don't have the same access to tech as in the west, ergo the generational shift is completely different."

2meirl4meirl,fegg8r4,t1_fegb9vd,1579091739.0,"Want your mind blown? The generational shift also depends if you grow up rich or poor. Since growing up poorer usually entails you getting older and more mature faster. If you go to the eastern block countries and talk to 23+ somethings there, none of them are fucking zoomers."

learndota2,fe3kah2,t3_encili,1578850060.0,"MMR is just a number, brother! Just pick a handful of heroes to focus on (one or two for every role) and just play them until you realize that you've personally progressed with them and then you'll notice yourself stomping. That's the biggest reward, imo. Single draft is wonderful for this!"

interestingasfuck,fe1gf5v,t3_eni9sw,1578826261.0,"""I lack nothing"" and ""I shall not want"" have completely different meanings. I wonder if the industrial revolution was the reason for the change due to the mass production."

Having lived with it for the past decade i mildly suggest you looking into your thoughts more closely?"
CasualConversation,fcz5hye,t3_ejmcmc,1578094076.0,"For me it's like swimming in a pool of words and frases that i actually hear in my head, that i can pluck as i form sentences either verbally or mentally. All this while i have parts of one or multiple songs playing in the background. As well as a multitoned tinnitus that i can hear if i focus on it, but i know that it's always there.
