I SWEAR I got a sirloin. It tasted, looked, and felt, like a sirloin. I’m a server myself so I didn’t want to make a scene and just let it go. Maybe she made a mistake and wrote sirloin it’s fine. I just mentioned to my bf sitting across from me “babe does this look like sirloin?” As my waitress happened to pass by and oh my GOD she FLIPPED THE FUCK OUT. 

She immediately stopped dead in her tracks, turned to face me and said with the snarkiest attitude “No, it’s not. You asked for a filet mignon and that’s what you got. Is there a problem?” And I said “No... it’s ok” and she does that Karen smirk and leaves then comes back with a manager and goes “this table doesn’t believe they have a filet mignon” manager doesn’t his lil script and I go “no really it’s ok” and the rest of the service she ignores us entirely until we had to ask another server for the check."

You deserve the same pay and the only “rude” thing is underpaying for the same or more work. 

You should learn your rights and sit down with management and explain to them that not only are you allowed to discuss wage but Harry brought this up naturally.

When I was serving for him he told me this was so he wouldn’t seem cheap and yelled at me a number of times for not recognizing his thousands of friends and giving discounts automatically bc it was rude to make them ask. Icing on the cake is they thought he spoiled me and I had them regularly telling me how lucky I am to have a father like him w money and one lady even said I should call him “daddy” (I call him by his first name) sit on his lap and bat my eyes and he’d buy me whatever I want. 

Little does she know that 1. He kicked my mom and I out of my childhood home to destroy the house that he allowed us to live in (it was basically in disrepair with broken wood floors, leaky roof, no hot water etc), built a mansion for him and his new wife but couldn’t afford to just fix the roof and floors for us. 2. He’s basically poor from spending all his money on vacations, luxury cars, and friends. 3. He hasn’t paid a dime of child support or helped me through college.

Funny story, when I had my first “relationship” as a kid when he said he wanted me to have 7 of his kids I told him for every hour I’m in labor I’d kick him in the balls... yeah. Lol. 

Now that I’m more mature and in a long term and loving relationship, we’ve been talking about having maybe one or two and I’m still terrified. Why should I suffer and he doesn’t? What I do when I realize this is that it’s natural. It’s natural for my body to contain life and for him it’s natural that he doesn’t. To wish him the pain of pregnancy without the miracle of giving life is just unfair. 

Tell her when she’s upset to just think of her baby who’s benefiting from her sacrifices. I agree he shouldn’t tempt her with caffeine or alcohol in front of her, but when he’s alone he should be allowed it. Especially since he’s gonna need caffeine to keep up with her midnight snack requests. If she’s with a good man, he’ll make all of the pregnancy worth it when the baby is born and take the reigns until she heals."

I’d say try and have a heart to heart with her where you tell her you were just trying to emphasize to your daughter the severity of not eating properly and forming better eating habits.

Personally sex has always been great for my HVM and I. Lasts hours with multiple orgasms each and can range from very rough to sweet. We’ve been together over 3 years and are still going strong in that department. When we do finally finish neither one of us feels “low” we feel super lovey and cuddle or caress each other and talk. I know if we took out orgasms or I suggested it, he’d TRY it but I know he wouldn’t like it. Nor would I, I imagine. After orgasms we both feel incredibly close and connected. That doesn’t make him a LVM. Just means we have different ways of showing love."

Minecraft,fd4phus,t1_fd4mzca,1578169776.0,It is. I’m really disappointed. I was so excited to be able to play Minecraft when I’m away from home but seems like a dead end. My bf who’s good with tech couldn’t even figure out a fix or even what the issue is causing it.
Minecraft,fd4mjlv,t3_ek1roe,1578168917.0,Same for my bf and I. No clue how to fix it or what to do you just gotta keep restarting the app and we get it like 1/15 tries.

AnimalsBeingJerks,fctfcvv,t1_fct322c,1577941475.0,These dogs are known to chew and swallow ANYTHING. you have to teach them from young because it can kill them. My bfs dog ate all his chew toys and swallowed them while even the “tough rubber” and bone ones.
rant,fckvi78,t1_fckrti9,1577734088.0,Yeah those circumstances shouldn’t have lead to road rage. A slight beep I always read as “hey pal it’s green.” Any more and it sounds like “GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE MOOOOOOOOVE”
rant,fckpe6l,t3_ehmx0q,1577730322.0,Damn how tall are you? I know a few brands have tall specific women’s clothing going up to like 6.5 feet or so. Not even those fit? I’m 5’4 and accidentally tried on a tall instead of a short at American Eagle  and I looked ridiculous lol.
rant,fckolhb,t3_ehfinw,1577729832.0,"Sometimes at lights I turn around to make sure my little brothers are ok/still strapped in. (They’re 4 and 2 and now know how to take off their car seat belts). Once the older one took it off as I was coming to a just turned red light and so I turned around and re did it quick. The light turned green and I just turned back in my seat ready to go when the truck behind me beeped as aggressively as possible as long as possible even after I started moving. It’s not even a short light, I take it all the time. 

If someone does one “beep” then ok I get it. But to go “HONKHONKHONKHONKHONK HOOOOOOOOOOONK” right from the jump? Like a second after it turned green? You’re an asshole and people are going to retaliate. It depends HOW you beep."

rant,fc26po5,t1_fc2321x,1577342909.0,Lol it’s Christmas dude let people live their lives. If it was a regular working Wednesday I’d be with you. I’m normally a super anti-annoyance type person. But some people only get one night off a year and they’re having fun everyone has different ideas of dope.
