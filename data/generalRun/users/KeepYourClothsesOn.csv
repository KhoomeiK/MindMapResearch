IdiotsInCars,ffjy352,t1_ffjxhjr,1580010127.0,"In most states you must signal for at least 100 feet before merging, in others it can be 200 feet. At highway speeds this is roughly 1-2 seconds. However, many transportation safety organizations recommend 2-3 additional seconds beyond what is required to ensure that people around you have had adequate notice of your lane change. Second, you must ensure that the lane you're merging into can safely accomodate your vehicle vis a vis the vehicles traveling in that lane prior to your merge. The manner in which you do this should take into account the relative speeds of both vehicles and the distance that would be between your own vehicle and the vehicles in that lane. Thirdly, if you are dealing with someone driving erratically, it's better to move as cautiously as possible. So yes, my idea of safety, which I believe is reasonable, is going to prevent me from merging immediately. Sorry you're going to die in a car accident some day because you didn't heed my warning, but there it is."

Attempting to change lanes might be met with further irrational actions such as the car behind accelerating rapidly without you even being clear of the lane, risking a glancing pushing blow that destabilizes you and sends you careening off into a spin. Besides, the dashcammer hadn't established enough cushion between himself and the car he was overtaking (3 seconds worth) before Mitsubishi prick decided to undertake.

When you're dealing with someone like that, any action you take can result in a  catch-22.
