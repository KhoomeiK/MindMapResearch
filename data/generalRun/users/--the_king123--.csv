I spoke for hours with Samsung members and apparently they will bring an update to the s10 5g that will enable 3d facial scanning so the ToF sensor can finally be used for something useful"

galaxys10,femch87,t1_femblui,1579248530.0,"Are you sure it has changed from before?? Cause for me it literally took 1 second to scan my face and save it. I doubt it even uses the tof, it just uses Ur photo. Plus it doesn't even say anything about tof sensor or 3d face unlocking when updating it. It just says the same thing it said before, that ""it is not the most reliable method"". If it did use the tof sensor by default, Samsung would've at least mentioned that face unlocking is faster."
galaxys10,femac49,t1_fem9pjv,1579245798.0,"It’s not on by default I had to manually turn on face unlock and it wasn’t even 3d

If u search online ever article says s10 5g has 3D face unlock"
galaxys10,fem9kaa,t1_fem8x85,1579244838.0,"Can’t find it anywhere

I even chatted with Samsung members and they couldn’t find anything

Honestly f Samsung.. they have the tof technology but fight use it"
