Assuming I misunderstood what you want, the way you can find out a direction between two points is to subtract the starting point from the end point.

So, if on frame 1 I'm at point A, and on frame 2 I'm at point B, then from frame 1 to frame 1 I've moved B-A.

So a simple way to do this in unity is store your current position and the next frame subtract your new current position from your stored position.

Then you need to get that direction as a rotation.

Quaternions are such a pain to understand and rotations can really make you (me) feel stupid so if I get this part wrong it's pretty close and I can help you debug.

skeptic,fdetgh1,t3_ekx1m2,1578346248.0,"I think ""Epstein Didn't Kill Himself"" doesn't even have that much to do with Epstein.

It's about the feeling that our system is divided among the powerful at the top and those of us lowly saps who have to pay parking tickets.

Epstein died and the case against him is closed which is ridiculous.

It's like if the police caught the getaway driver from a bank robbery, then the getaway driver kills himself in prison, so law enforcement stops investigating.

""Epstein Didn't Kill Himself"" means ""those with extreme power in our country are abusing those powers""

I think most people don't care about Epstein's death, but the fact of the matter is that many powerful people benefited from his death which means it's not just financial crimes, bribery, and the sort of things you would expect that the upper crust gets away with. 

These people can rape children without consequences, and these people own our politicians.

samharris,fdd0tri,t1_fdcvfu0,1578290346.0,"You read OP's question as:

> ... the prima facie confusion of determinism with other concepts like fatalism or predestinarianism that no one who has actually bothered 'thinking deeply' about determinism as a philosophical concept before would ever make.

I read your interpretation as:

""the [first glance] confusion of determinism, with other concepts like fatalism or predestinarianism [mixed in], [which] no one who [had] actually bothered [to] '[think] deeply' about determinism, as a philosophical concept, ~~before~~ would *ever* make.""

That's pretty highfalutin' if you ask me Mr. Professor, sir.

It's also pretty darn glib in my opinion. 

Also *very* rude.

You categorized his question and answered that category of question. Kinda like a straw-man fallacy if there were teaching fallacies.

I think those mix-ins which you ignored the ""fatalism or predestinarianism"" warrant conversation, even if it is the sort of thing you might scorn your students for discussing, because it's not just the ultra-abstract philosophy you're used to, it's a much more concrete question about the experience of operating a brain.

But your original answer was basically ""yes, things are worth doing for reasons other than hedonistic gratification"" which is just such a ridiculously glib answer that I felt I should inform you that there was a deeper question he was trying to ask.

It is my opinion that you are the one in the wrong here, despite your obvious intelligence."
VRGaming,fdcu8jp,t1_fdcqd2c,1578284463.0,"I've mostly only used unity for VR development, but each tracked node has a name and you basically just sort them as a simple list and do things based on each position/rotation.

If you didn't have the names for some reason, you will always know which one in the head, and controllers, which means you can just sort by height and make pretty accurate guesses about which nodes are which.

This would break down when you have very strange poses, like if your feet are above your knees for some reason, but the rotations of each node would also give you hints.

The work of tracking and identifying which nodes are which is handled by the API, and I think if you really dig into it, each device keeps track of it's own position and tells your computer, so as a developer the only overhead would be something like :
    LeftKnee.Position = VRAPI.LeftKnee.Position
    etc"

VXJunkies,fdbxt2e,t3_eki1jm,1578263558.0,"Do you have a single machine which says ""VX"" on it and has a single tape bay?

You might be using a AloramCo product sold during the first VX boom, they aren't totally useless but if you're using anything other than AloramCo tapes you will need to bypass ~~they're~~ their old fashioned DRM ""integrity guard"" which is a Bethany justified strip of orthogonally juxtaposed magnetic poles (that is to say 1's for n/e, 0 for s/w).

You can just run a strip of ocyletine (or white out with some iron dust maybe?) Along the top edge of the tape.

If you do it right and the tape didn't get destroyed in the process, the random polarity of your top edge will be random enough that you are nearly guaranteed to get at least one ""1"" and at least one ""0"" per step which should always return valid in the integrity guard."

For sanitary reasons, and also to make sure you aren't seen as that person who walks around with their hands down their pants.

Your current state of mind has a lot to do with your near future state of mind and if you can control your mind I believe you are likely to have a better life in general (even if only your perception of it)

It's easy for many of us to dwell on thoughts which make our problems seem unsolvable, or which make us feel less valuable, if your mind is in one of these states when you need to do something, you are likely not going to act in a manner as positive as you may like.

Exercising you ability to control your mental state is valuable, I believe, and meditation is an exercise in observing what your brain is currently doing, and then changing what it is currently doing.

If you did find yourself in a situation where you need to control what your brain is currently doing (perhaps not allowing thoughts of how much you hate you job interfere with your ability to do that job) you'll be better equipped to handle that situation if you've had a bit of practice operating your brain on general.
