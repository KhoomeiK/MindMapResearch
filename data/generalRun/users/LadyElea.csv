FriendshipAdvice,fdysivy,t3_en9ge4,1578783133.0,"Dude, please get help. I did a quick check on your history and you are obsessed with this girl. You keep talking about being betrayed as a friend and that isn't what this is. You were not a friend. You were constantly waiting to be in a romantic relationship with her and she wasn't interested. She was honest with you. You clearly needed to walk away a long time ago.

I've had friends of every gender. We do NOT have these issues. This kind of break down only happens when one person is obsessed or ""in love"" with the other. There is a post where you talk about not wanting her to use your gym membership if it means her bf is enjoying how her body looks....whaaaaat? That has NEVER been an issue between FRIENDS. Hell, most friends would be encouraging each other to keep up those healthy habits.

Also, ya'll been friends for 10 years and she is 26? How old are you? Cause this started when at least she was in high school. 

I'm not trying to be mean. You need to see this clearly. Your reactions up to being ghosted were not the reactions of a friend. You're the lovesick ex she never dated. That doesn't make her the bad guy. If you don't get help though, it might make you one. The path you're on is leading straight to incel/nice guy territory."
konmari,fdxi8ay,t3_emi4la,1578768930.0,I really want to stress going be category and not by room. That and taking time to thank everything you are removing and keeping what sparks joy. Those really are cornerstones of the whole process and too often dismissed.
TwoXChromosomes,fdt1suy,t1_fdhbqp8,1578710811.0,"I'm very worried about you. This comment makes it so much worse. He is a functioning adult. You used your words and he is ignoring them. 

I hope you're doing ok."
TwoXChromosomes,fdszfvk,t3_em7pdq,1578709944.0,"I hear you on the ace and nb  (I know the user name is blarg). That can make body stuff so much worse somehow. And antidepressants fuck things up too even while helping in other ways. 

I know for a fact that I've seen a really cool labia+clit chart that showed all of these real life images. Trust me, yours isn't as unusual as you'd think. I wish I still had it saved now, but it is definitely out there. 

As for the masterbation, the Hitachi ""magic wand"" is pretty much the gold standard. I got mine for 40-60$ around 6 years ago. It is great for cliterally possessed ace-folks imo.

I hope this helps."
TwoXChromosomes,fdsw33t,t3_elusw9,1578708693.0,I find it distressing how much information doctors fail to provide as well. Things like decreased efficacy of birth control once you start going past a certain body weight.
