AskReddit,ffgkqua,t1_ffgfssf,1579908487.0,"> They don't understand that this doesn't work for the majority of men. You just lose touch, you stop reaching out, and you stop seeing the point in maintaining those friendships at all.

Men who are active in their friendships have more friends. Men who are apathetic about maintaining friendships have less friends. There's no biological component that prevents men from shooting off a text every once in a while, it's just as you said, they stop seeing the point. 

But more than that, a lot of guys have a really bad habit of neglecting or even straight up dropping friendships when a woman comes into their life. It sets a bad precedent in the relationship that his time is always hers which is a hard thing to break when the new-relationship sheen wears off and he wants to start reconnecting with friends. 

It also sets a bad tone in the friendship relationship. Nobody wants to hang out with a guy who views your friendship as disposable the second something better come along. Many many guys have shot themselves in the foot that way, dropping friendships like they mean nothing and once he's single or lonely suddenly he's down to hang. 

The fact is women make friends a priority while a lot of guys seem to treat friends as 'when it's convenient for me'."

You can really be assured of the baseline functionality of the clothing when seeing how it holds up to a back alley scuffle.

The hardest part of staying fashionable is, of course, how much effort you have to put into remaining strong so that you can bring down the fashionable. You're not going after weak cereal fed pores but women who have been eating grass fed vegan beef and hemp seeds so endurance is key, you have to be able to wear down even the most athletic of fashionistas.

My brother was actually in the process of putting his daughter up for adoption before she was born and they had a few families lined up wanting her.

My bro called me up the next day and told me I had a niece and ended up consulting with me about what to do.

Long story short, he ended up completely turning his life around and getting his shit together to be a better dad for her.

You have no idea what is going on in the lives of the parents who choose to give their babies up for adoption.

""Just adopt""

Adoption can be a fraught process, not just the process of finding a child (which can be a heartbreaking and expensive journey) but navigating connections with an entirely different family that you likely don't even know, managing the instinct to hold tight to a child that you might feel is slipping away and choosing their bio family over you, and trying to raise a child that can come from backgrounds you're not familiar with but that they will likely want to know about and explore.

Adoption is like parenting+.

StarWars,fcpbln6,t1_fcoedeg,1577857294.0,"Buddy, I like Reylo specifically because it's fucked up and toxic, not because I'm somehow imagining that a dude stalking a woman halfway across the galaxy through their force connection is a totally normal and socially acceptable thing to do. 

I don't want to see fictional relationships where everyone is happy and the couple is normal and loving, that shit boring. I like drama and stakes and shit that I would never be cool with irl. It's fiction. Go wild."

Personally I hate watching hockey on TV but if I'm at a game I get crazy hyped because of the atmosphere and intensity. Not everyone needs to be following the team to appreciate a good game."

TooAfraidToAsk,fcluu8u,t1_fclmgnk,1577757012.0,"This post comes off as real 'so different and edgy, I saw a kid fall and laughed while other women would have checked on the kid, guess I'm hashtag not like other girls.'

I love kids and have absolutely laughed at kids falling. Just because you're not a stereotype doesn't mean you're different."
TooAfraidToAsk,fcltj3f,t1_fclghj8,1577756103.0,"All the good parts about kids come from having a relationship with them, if you don't have a relationship with a kid you're not encountering any of the fun and unique aspects of their personality and development, only the shitty annoying parts.

For example, my niece in public is a menace and strangers probably don't appreciate her. Since I know her I know that she's not just that baby who will make a scene in the mall but she's also that baby who somehow knows which nearly identical black phone belongs to which adult in our household and considers it her duty to bring your phone to you if you've walked off without it (she's never once brought me the wrong phone), she's also the baby who thinks putting on makeup is something we do together and will pat her face with my beauty blender and then will look at me as if to say 'see what I did, aren't you proud', she's the weirdo who will drink out of the cats water bowl and will put phones up to her ear and pretend to talk because we do it and she wants to be like us and a million other moments that nobody but us will ever see.

I don't know why so many people find strange kids annoying and assume that they just don't like kids. Of course you don't. Strange kids suck balls. Kids are amazing when they know you and love you, not when they're that crying, screaming wretch that you can't tell to shut up."
ffacj,fclqfe0,t1_fclkpd9,1577753955.0,"Srs I would never buy one size fits all tights from Asia as they're almost certain to be small sizing and too short. 

For everything else you can get by using a measuring tape as they usually list all their measurements on a chart so you aren't just throwing your money into the void and hoping whatever arrives isn't five sizes too small."
TwoXChromosomes,fc9ozn4,t1_fc9mwvu,1577555984.0,"It doesn't sound ridiculous at all because it happens. 

Who you are in your 20s is often not who you are in your 30s and later, priorities and desires can change and if you've closed the door on kids permanently a lot of people will likely look for someone to blame if they suddenly meet the right person and want kids but are now unable to.

Posts like this frustrate me because they act like doctors are just being irrational and sexist. Doctors are being rightfully cautious about handing out no-take-back procedures to young adults who could, and often do, change their minds later in life."
