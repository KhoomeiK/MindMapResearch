AskReddit,fdztza4,t1_fdy95un,1578795740.0,"That last video segment is dead wrong. Coming from a chemistry perspective, most likely the salt pulls water out of the omelette, in turn making it slightly denser, which is what causes the syneresis (which you also see on the top of yogurt as little separated liquid, for example), it's NOT caused by the filling.

If you add salt early on, it probably does help to dissolve the proteins initially so you can have a larger total volume of material (imagine a cotton ball you've poofed up rather than squished down) making eggs fluffier. So salt should have an early-stage beneficial and late-stage detrimental effect.

Probably the temperature you use and how you mix the eggs has just as much impact, which could emphasize the good or the bad of the salt."
AskReddit,fdzsyq6,t1_fdy4094,1578795070.0,"Former chemistry student here -- 

The salt can probably alter the protein solidification, in a process loosely similar to curdling, which is what can cause it to be watery and harder, rather than fluffier and more uniform. (Likely the salt ions screen the charges on the egg proteins, causing them to precipitate into harder littler drier lumps of egg than they would normally.) Other spices probably don't have the same effect since they don't screen charges. If you add the salt after it's solidified on its own, it won't affect that process, but you \*should\* be ok if you add the other spices in earlier, and that will help the flavor of those mix with the egg itself."
