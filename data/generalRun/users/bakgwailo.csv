Also, outside of the NEC, Amtrak generally doesn't own the track they operate on, which really screws them, too, as slow moving freight gets priority, and the freight owners don't care about track upgrades for higher speed. Everything outside of the NEC is also diesel which is significantly more expensive to maintain and run vs electric locomotives.

Finally - even looking at Japan's system, profitability comes from real estate deals and development of land around stations, where JR is very good at land leasing to value capture the increase in development and land value around stations and investment. Amtrak doesn't really have this authority, and, even on the NEC doesn't particularly own the land at this point around stations to start doing it."
