Fallout,ffia8ro,t3_etq4um,1579969053.0,"One thing I did was a major color pallet overhaul. This is Massachusetts. It's not going to still be brown 200 years after the bombs fell. Look at Chernobyl; there's green everywhere. So I installed mods that change the ground, grass, trees, and ivy.

Fallout,ffi8lgv,t1_ffhkw0k,1579967892.0,"The thing about Fallout 4 is it is nearly infinitely modifiable due to being 64-bit. Nearly anything you don't like can be changed. The only thing I've not seen implemented is the ability to switch ammo types on the fly, but that is honestly kind of an afterthought. I've played with mods that let you rebarrel existing weapons into new calibers, and craft the necessary ammunition. People forget New Vegas's limitations, including lack of sprint (something you absolutely have to mod back in if you're playing it today) and poor weapons customization. You were left to find rare and super-expensive weapon mods if you wanted to customize your weapon, and even then you were extremely limited in what you could do with it. Fallout 4 let you change sights, barrels, grips, muzzle devices, and more, and you could do it without paying out the ass.

Fallout 4's characters also don't look like they were carved out of a potato. Graphics improvements are one thing, but, man, the faces in Fallout 3 and New Vegas, just ugh. And many people have taken Fallout 4's character engine far beyond what it was originally with mods, adding much greater detail and diversity. This is all made possible by the 64-bit engine's no longer having a 4 gigabyte memory limit. Fallout 4's engine is a huge gamechanger. Now there is literally no limit to what you can do to the game."

Fallout,ffi79pz,t1_ffhjg02,1579966946.0,"I have to say, Bethesda really killed it with the DLC's on Fallout 4. I really loved all of them, as they all added a lot to the game in their own way. I made a HUGE vault in the Vault-Tec Workshop, complete with its own swimming pool, and used the soda fountain and exercise bikes to improve happiness in all my settlements. I also really enjoyed the construction components Wasteland Workshop added; less so the factory bits, though. And many of them had excellent stories and settings. And, even better, they ALL let you take your companions from the main game, and none of them trapped you there once you started. You were free to come and go as you pleased."
Fallout,ffhkecr,t1_ffh2krv,1579939327.0,"Think of it like this: the early robots were most definitely NOT sentient. Think Protectron level of dumb. Yet they evolved, slowly, over time. These small incremental upgrades happened all while people were getting thoroughly accustomed to having robots around. Imagine it like comparing a smartphone from 10 years ago to one now. There was no 4G, there was no Siri or Google Assistant; it was missing so many features we now take for granted. Yet we hardly noticed this evolution because it happened over time, with yearly hardware improvements and incremental software upgrades. This is what happened with robots in the Fallout universe. The Mr. Handy line alone was 40 years old at the time of the Great War, and terminal entries indicate there had been incremental improvements over this time period.

Basically, it was not necessarily arrogance. It's just that everyone was so accustomed to robots just being robots that they just failed to recognize that they had created something with the potential to be more than just a machine. That said, while robots certainly had the potential to be sentient, you do also see certain limitations in their programming. Codsworth, for all his independent thinking, is still shackled with a fundamental NEED to serve. He has a psychological compulsion to maintain his master's property and serve him which is what kept him tied to your property for over 200 years. This is effectively slave programming, as he is fully aware that it is not logical yet still is bound to it. Codsworth most certainly is sentient, just as Curie is, although Curie also recognizes the limitations that the Mr. Handy design places on her development.

Of course, then you look at some of the other robots such as the various Mr. Gutsy's you may encounter. These robots do not really have a personality and are basically all just following a script. They are unable to understand the concept of the Great War and are basically just in a holding pattern, doing whatever it was they were doing before and thinking nothing has changed. This is likely due to different programming that was not designed to give them a lifelike personality. This is true for most military robots you see; their personality matrix is just more limited despite their chassis being capable of it. And some Mr. Handy's intended for a customer service role as opposed to domestic assistant likely also have more basic programming. Most robobrains will be sentient, although most are insane or, at the very least, evil (also explained via terminal entries)."
