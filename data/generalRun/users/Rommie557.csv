The fact is that when adjusted for inflation, the cost of literally everything has raised exponentially while wages have been stagnant since the 70's. We're literally having to spend way more for basics like housing, food, education, and Healthcare while getting paid essentially the same, or even less, then our parents or grandparents,l.

But please, continue telling us this is our fault because we don't hustle enough. Never mind those who are working three jobs and a side hustle just to eat this month."

AskReddit,fez5ty0,t1_feybvub,1579454073.0,"This reminds me of the story my grandma tells about her family car when she was a kid growing up on a farm in Iowa.

They didn't have much money, so they were still driving a Model T in the late 40's to early 50's, and my grandmother was absolutely horrified to be seen in public in it when she was a teen, and would duck under the windows so no one would recognize her."

I then want you to realize that you are likely entirely average (just as I am, this isn't an insult, just statistics), and the things that are on your wishlist of what you would spend that money on is probably fairly similar to approx. 75% of the country's wishlist, and extrapolate from there."
