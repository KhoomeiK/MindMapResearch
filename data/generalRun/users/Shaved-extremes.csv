Dentistry,fgve24g,t3_f0kzb8,1581146338.0,You probably just needed a regular cleaning. Especially since Denti-Cal denied the Deep Cleaning in the first place. Sorry to say-but you got Scammed! Always get a 2nd opinion if your gut tells you something is off. Usually Denti-Cal is really good at approving Scaling and Root Planing if it is necessary. No way full mouth SRP can be done in 40 minutes-lollz. Pretty sure it was just a prophy and supragingival scaling they did and billed you for root planing.

Also I think your hair has decent volume on the left-maybe need some fibers to make it look fuller? I understand wanting to shave it though since its less hassle for sure and it does look ok on you. Cheers"

studentloandefaulters,fghmhhz,t1_fghm0ur,1580788206.0,You have to pay 9 months of payments then your account is back to good standing and resets. One month payment does nothing. Other option which is what I did was they offered to refinance my loan which would bring my delinquent loans back to good standing. All I asked is for them to send me info about the refinancing plan. They said I didn’t have to sign up if  I didn’t want to but the fact that I would like time to think about it brought my 90 day past due loans back to good standing. I did this because I was out of forbearance time and the Navient rep told me that this was an option.

nfl,fg7y04i,t1_fg7subh,1580604371.0,"Bruce played at the same time as Rice, Moss and Owens who are widely regarded as the best receivers to ever play. That took away a lot of Pro Bowl and All-Pro Votes. That and he played in St. Louis which didn’t have the national following beside the Greatest Show on Turf years 1999-2001. Bruce retired with the 2nd most receiving yards in NFL history and was a main part of arguably the best offense ever assembled at the time. That offense was transcendent and changed the way offense was played until today. In 1995 Bruce had 1781 yards (2nd all-time at the time) on 119 catches and 11 TDs with Chris Miller at QB -He didn’t even make the Pro Bowl. He was always under-appreciated. He was an unselfish player and not very vocal along with not being physically imposing-this made him go largely unnoticed by casual fans. But you ask any scout or coach who the best route runner of all-time was and Bruce would be mentioned as the best along with Jerry Rice and Marvin Harrison. On the field and off the field he was humble and had great character. He’s arguably a Top 10-12 WR in the history of the NFL by stats alone. And he made a game winning TD catch in the Super Bowl-and that matters. And Im sure his buddy Torry Holt will get in soon to cement that great offense in the history books."

nfl,fg5wmwp,t1_fg5jhwr,1580542008.0,Kobe performed live 100 times a year for 3 hours at a time for 20 years for the same people every night after they got home from school and work and had a shitty day. He brought joy to many families. He was like a son in many ways. You watched him grow from a goofy 17 year old kid into a mature and devoted 40 year old father of 4. LA is a Lakers town. Always will be. And Kobe was the centerpiece of LA. The land of stars and celebs and Kobe was the biggest no doubt

nfl,fg5vs9a,t1_fg3q338,1580540928.0,"Its because he had Jerry Rice , Randy Moss, Terrell Owens, Chris Carter and Michael Irvin playing in the NFC all at the same time lol. Bruce had statistically the 2nd best season all-time by a WR in 1995 and was snubbed for even a Pro Bowl spot.  It didn’t help that every year he played except for that 4 or 5 year Greatest Show on Turf stretch that the Rams were a bottom dweller with a horrible supporting cast and lack of national exposure. BUT that GSOT run was arguably the best and most explosive offense the NFL had ever seen up until then and completely redefined how the passing game would become in the NFL for years to come. He has already had 3 teammates selected into the HOF from that offense (Warner, Faulk, Pace). Its just a matter of time before he and Holt get in. It would be fitting if they both were selected  at the same time. Both were unselfish team players that helped the Rams score 500+ points 3 seasons in a row (which at the time was unheard of). Its not only stats-its redefining and transcending the way the game was played. Without either Bruce or Holt the GSOT would never have happened. And Bruce was the better receiver of the 2 until about 2003 when Holt became the Alpha"

nfl,fg5ux78,t1_fg53rah,1580539892.0,Putting the Seahawks in front of us is a damn travesty lol. The Rams were one of the beat teams in the 70’s and 80’s as far as overall winning percentage. Just could not win the Super Bowl because of great teams like Dallas and Pittsburgh in the 70’s and Chicago and SF in the 80’s. History wise theres no contest. Yea we sucked throughout the 90’s and 15 of the past 20 seasons. So I guess we are a mediocre to good Franchise??

Mikan/Pettit to Wilt/Russell to Kareem/Oscar/West/Baylor to DrJ/Moses Malone to Bird/Magic to Jordan/Hakeem/Karl Malone to Shaq/Kobe/Duncan to Lebron and maybe Steph now. I don’t think you can separate Bird and Magic. I also think Tim Duncan and Shaq were the Wilt and Kareem of our generation-you need to include both of those guys in GOAT big man conversations.  There are other names too but these guys were the GOATS of their generations"
nfl,fg0rqc4,t1_ffzxe6v,1580413721.0,Dude the Boston Herald (The fucking hometown newspaper in Boston) wrote this story!! Why would they want to throw their own team under the bus like that unless it were true. Several witnesses inside the organization stated that the Pats taped red zone plays and plays the Rams never ran before. Staffers setup video cameras in the Super dome and one staffer was in the stands taping nonchalantly.  Theres no way Goodell wanted the public to know the Super Bowl was a tainted game thats why he destroyed the tapes.

That money will get paid to the Private Lenders and Dept. of Ed by taxing all future stock transactions a fraction of 1%. 1.7 trillion dollars-will be paid back in 10-15 years by most estimates. Also all Colleges and Universities will be free. Even Professional schools like Dentistry will be free.
