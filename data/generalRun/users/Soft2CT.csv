That questionnaire asked women if they had sex intoxicated under the influence of alcohol. They determined consent was unable to be given, therefore it was rape. 

Sorry if you never had drunken sex before.

Edit: Rather than continue this exchange, which I don't believe is productive, I just want to leave a citation to explain why the ""1 in 5"" stat is bogus. You're welcome to reply and get the final word.

""Rather than asking students if they were sexually assaulted, these surveys ask students if they were subjected to certain behaviors. If a student responds that they were, that student is reported as a victim of sexual violence. But these surveys are asking about breathtakingly broad swaths of behavior. They ask if students ever had sex after their partner ‚Äòexpressed displeasure‚Äô or criticized their attractiveness. They ask if students had sex with someone after they ‚Äúshow[ed] they were unhappy.‚Äù Students who answer affirmatively are counted in the one-in-five statistic.

The way the surveys define ‚Äúalcohol-facilitated‚Äù rape or sexual assault is also very broad. For example, the much-cited National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey does not ask women if they were ‚Äúincapacitated‚Äù. Instead, it asks them if they were unable to consent because they were ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù or ‚Äúpassed out‚Äù, which obviously invites students to answer ‚Äúyes‚Äù if they ever engaged in sex while drunk, even if they were neither incapacitated nor passed out. The New York Times ran an interesting piece about a mandatory session on sexual consent at Trinity College where the students asked questions like: ‚Äúwhat if a student has just one beer ‚Äî or even just a sip?‚Äù So, it is very unclear what students mean when they answer these questions in the affirmative. It is healthy to have a discussion about how drunk is too drunk for sex, but these surveys are skipping that discussion. Of course, the reported numbers are high.""

We have a generation of schmucks taking on severe college debt they didn't ""understand"" who now need a scapegoat to blame for their poor decisions. Hence blame the rich, blame corporations, and finally blame capitalism. 

My parents grew up in a socialist country. Portugal. My mother was poor but my father was essentially destitute, going to bed hungry, with a mother who often couldn't feed him and would sing him to sleep as his only form of solace as his stomach churned in hunger. 

Flash forward to age 20 where both came to America for a better life. My father worked in a factory for a while and eventually started his own cleaning business. My mother got a job for Aetna (an evil corporation) and both rose to the upper middle class. 50 years later almost all our relatives in Portugal remain poor with simple jobs, forced to have 3 generations share a small apartment out of necessity.

There's reason ""socialism"" works in Scandinavia. It's actually capitalism with a strong free market, but high taxes and a welfare state. Very few industries are government owned.

""Venezuela isn't real socialism."" Tell that to it's citizens. ""Cuba had helped some of its poorest people."" Remind me again why doctors and dentists are becoming bakers/shop owners for a better life as the Cuban government opens up restrictions on small business.

America is the global economic anchor and China is investing billions if not trillions in Africa. When did this start happening? After china evolved to a more free market system, closer approaching capitalism.

""Between 1958 and 1962, 45 million people starved to death in China as the result of the largest socialist experiment in history. Mao called this experiment the ‚ÄúGreat Leap Forward,‚Äù but for China it was a disaster.""

""Today, China is the world‚Äôs leading export nation, ahead of the United States and Germany. Above all, never before in history have so many people escaped poverty in such a short time as in the past decades in China. According to official World Bank figures, the percentage of extremely poor people in China in 1981 stood at 88.3%. By 2015 only 0.7% of the Chinese population was living in extreme poverty. In this period, the number of poor people in China fell from 878 million to less than ten million.""

Open your eyes and wake up. The fact that our generation doesn't have it ""as easy"" as boomers, isn't the failing of capitalism. It's the evolution of a global economy and a result of automation. 

That's where most factory jobs went. Not overseas, but to robots. Stop blaming boomers, stop blaming evil corporations, stop blaming capitalism.
