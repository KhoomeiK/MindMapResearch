postrock,ffvcipl,t1_ffuttvu,1580260899.0,"I strongly agree, and I'll also point out that the western (and particularly American) obsession with artistic originality is not a universal human aesthetic. Even in the west, that mindset doesn't extend back very far. If you go back into even the middle ages, the emphasis is not on producing wholly original works. Particularly in literature, original works were considered to be less clever than derivative works.

To modern minds, that sounds backwards. It might help to think of it this way: anyone can just make something up, but it takes a truly keen mind to take a well-worn story and tell it in a manner that is fresh, pertinent to the audience and entertaining. Worded another way, it's the mark of a good storyteller to be able to tell a familiar story better than the way you first heard it.

And of course, the vast, vast majority of popular entertainment in the US is just as repetitive as (or far more than) anything in post rock. Music, pop fiction, movies, TV shows... you name it, 95% of entertainment is just a repackaging of what came before it. We might not feel that way, but that's because we're familiar enough with our entertainment medium to recognize and value that 5%."
