MLPLounge,ffnyl7d,t1_fflu3w9,1580072310.0,You know what would have been more fun if she was double crossing them all along and she joins forces with Maud I love how she casually mentioned that she could get her a stone that could give her the power she needed to take over. Then she could manipulate sunburst and any other ponies she could bring to her cause she's already quite good at doing that.

MLPLounge,ffk5w8t,t3_eu07o8,1580016897.0,"I hated that they reformed almost all the villans and those that they didn't were reduced to simpering incompetent weaklingings I know that the message her is that friendship is magic. But we shouldn't be teaching little girls that it will solve all your problems. Not everyone is redeemable or going to like you. 

Edit: In fact many people will flat out use you. I particularly hate the whole discord and Fluttershy dynamic. Yes please let's encourage people to believe that  if you are in a bad relationship you can change a bad person if I just love them enough. Really hated the changling king the design was awful his personality was in my opinion wimpy. I loved Sombra and Chrysalis  such formidable villians reduced to weaklingings. Okay that was long winded I have other gripes so maybe I will start a new post."

AskReddit,ffj2yfv,t3_etr4no,1579989066.0,"To me a good person is not someone who is exempt from making bad choices or doing shitty things because no one is. It's the person who turns around and confronts there mistakes and takes responsiblity, and not blame others for there actions. A good person knows they are flawed and aims to improve."

AskReddit,ffgvhjc,t1_ffgf5dt,1579916101.0,We all have the same problems because we are all human we do fucked up things or have fucked up things done to us. We need to stop having a fucking pissing contest and learn from our mistakes and experiences and treat each other as human beings.

AskReddit,ff22dz8,t1_ff1zdz1,1579491942.0,For me it was the way you weren't allowed to be human nothing was aloud not even human emotions or urges just constant suppression of everything. Just always be happy and kind to everyone. No matter how shitty or stupid they were because everyone is redeemable. Which if we are supposed to be accepting of everyone then why did we have to abide by so many rules and act like a fucking robot?
AmItheAsshole,fez8gjw,t1_fex3xc4,1579454794.0,I agree. Just maybe he should have pulled her aside and discussed it.
AmItheAsshole,fex5t7m,t3_eqnf9p,1579424936.0,I think the husband might be worried that she is getting out of touch. It's one thing to call your pet you're baby out of endearment. However she is treating it like a human child by saying how they have their hands full with their baby. I understand she is grieving. But she can't use the dog as a substitute. However perhaps he should have pulled her aside and discussed it with her I feel that would have been better.
