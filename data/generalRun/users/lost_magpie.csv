todayilearned,ffgmsav,t1_ffgme5q,1579909870.0,"Anglo Arabs are actually pretty successful in the Tevis cup, so I don't necessarily agree that a TB or cross thereof would never win an endurance race. Arabs are particularly good at endurance, yes, but Anglos are also competitive. I've never seen a donkey win Tevis. I think a mustang won once, but it's very unusual."
todayilearned,ffgkilq,t1_fff8842,1579908335.0,Well I don't think anything besides an Arab has won the Tevis cup in decades sooo...
todayilearned,ffgk9i9,t1_fffbc6v,1579908167.0,That was my thought too. They must mean Anglo-Arab?
todayilearned,ffgk6wb,t1_fff5rv5,1579908119.0,Thoroughbreds are their own breed just FYI. Not a cross.
lgbt,ffgjjet,t1_ffg9dus,1579907692.0,"Honestly that sounds about like my realizing I was gay story lol. I was flipping through a Victoria's Secret catalogue because I, uh, wanted to buy a new bra. One of my guy friends peeked over my shoulder at the one I was staring at (for BRA RESEARCH OKAY), went ""damn she's hot!"" And I instinctively responded, ""yeah she is!"" Then suddenly it hit me lol"
gaming,ffgj5zq,t1_ffgj39x,1579907448.0,This one is extremely feral and has a lot of baggage haha. Some are gravy... this one will send you to the hospital if you make the wrong move
gaming,ffgiuy2,t1_ffgi7sx,1579907244.0,If only! I've got a mare I'll volunteer for anyone who thinks they can do it like that lol
gaming,ffg0tob,t1_fffkm1m,1579896008.0,"Agree. Even Red Dead that arguably has the most realistic movement is still like hey, you just caught this wild horse, buck it out for 30 seconds and now it's a finished bridle horse!"
actuallesbians,fff86oe,t1_fff0y9c,1579878131.0,Definitely this! I have poor self esteem and this method has made me able to behave socially acceptably about compliments lol
painting,ffeajzc,t1_ffeaist,1579841322.0,Thanks :)
painting,ffdn83c,t1_ffdn4t0,1579824475.0,Thank you! I appreciate that. It was challenging and I almost ragequit halfway through lol
Albuquerque,ffauxwo,t1_ffae9vp,1579745079.0,I think it's a troll account judging by the post history? He keeps asking if he's shadowbanned yet and wondering why it's taking so long? Weird
cosplay,ff92fj4,t1_ff8pf3s,1579703184.0,Everyone is short compared to Harrison Ford
Art,ff7sl3f,t1_ff7shn6,1579657346.0,Wow thank you!
cosplay,ff7rf8o,t1_ff7r1p4,1579656541.0,That escalated quickly lol
Art,ff7qh5d,t1_ff7nym2,1579655879.0,"You do make a really good point. I think I was worried the piece wouldn't speak for itself and that was a large part of why I added it. I have done some pieces in the past where I included text and it worked really well, BUT, it was less explanatory of the piece than this and I think it was worked into the composition a little better."
cosplay,ff7nr3e,t1_ff7nlpw,1579653960.0,"Lol, my cousin once shrink wrapped some actual cinnamon buns and hot glued them to a headband to wear for Halloween. 

But for real she doesn't have the cinnamon bun hair in this film ;)"
Art,ff7n3jk,t1_ff7mmtf,1579653499.0,Thank you! I'm not allowed to self-promote with links on here but all my profiles are under Nycta Fine Art :)
Art,ff7n1bu,t1_ff7mgjm,1579653457.0,"Thank you. I totally hear you about the text. I waffled for a long time on whether to put it on or not. I ultimately decided to include it because I wanted to be abundantly clear that it was not a ""heaven"" thing but a secular idea of our matter dispersing back into the universe to become something new. I think it could be improved a lot by perhaps a better font and placement?"
