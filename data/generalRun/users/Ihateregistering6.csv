And how are you going to make this work?

When you get a traffic citation, or a parking ticket, the Cop writes you the ticket, gives it to you, and you have to pay it within a certain amount of time.  Most of the time (nowadays), you don't even have to appear in court: you just pay online or send the money in.

The only way they would be able to ensure the punishment is 'equal' to all parties involved would be to do an entire financial audit on every person who gets a minor citation.

I'd argue this doesn't really work either.

For example, Powerlifting does differentiate by weight, but it still also differentiates by gender.  Why?  Because even when they weigh the exact same, the top male lifters are well beyond the top females.

https://www.powerliftingwatch.com/records/raw/world

https://www.powerliftingwatch.com/records/raw/women-world

Some examples: 

-The world record squat for a 148 lb man is 579 lbs.  World record for a 148 lb woman is 462 lbs.

-World record bench press for a 165 lb man is 486 lbs.  World record for a 165 lb woman is 330.

changemyview,fegxt22,t3_ep3fr0,1579104919.0,"*Judging by the road behavior I see from drivers of luxury and exotic cars I’d guess that this mindset is widespread among wealthier people.*

This is completely anecdotal.  But, for fun, I'll compare it with my anecdotal experience: I've lived all over the US, and everywhere I've lived the people who are the absolute worst and most reckless drivers are people driving beaters.  You're also assuming that someone driving a nice car is automatically wealthy.  Even if you're poor, it's very easy to get a nice car if you're willing to accept an extremely high interest loan (I saw it all the time when I was in the Army).

But let's take this a step further: if we're going to say that poor people should pay less of a fine than rich people because it impacts them more, why not change the cost of *everything*?  If a TV is $800, why not charge wealthy people $1,500 for it, and charge poor people $200 for it?  After all, since that cost disproportionately affects the poor more, shouldn't it be offset for it?

You could apply this logic to 1000 things.  Let's say you have two people who get arrested for committing the same crime, but one of them is single, and the other is married with 2 kids.  Should the married person only do 2 years in prison, while the single person does 6 years, since the married person being in prison will have a 'disproportionate effect' on others?

You're essentially saying we need to layer additional punishment on people because they committed the crime of being successful.

BTW, it's also worth noting that this does happen to a certain degree.  For example, the Government can forcibly garnish your wages for failing to pay child support (which is a crime), but since you can't get blood from a turnip, a wealthy person can have a much larger amount of their paycheck garnished than a poor person.  This also applies to cases settled in small claims court."

What does this have to do with anything?  The direct cause of most people being obese is not having a mental disorder.
