cats,fdpd1q7,t3_emjhby,1578625552.0,Looks very similar to my Kola. Just different eyes.

food,fcnhp44,t3_ei4qyw,1577811934.0,Ronald can't match what you've got there.
bmx,fcaesrp,t1_fcac47g,1577567999.0,I also wear shadow pads. I ride BMX but I've found that the shadow invisalights are the way to go IMO. They're lightweight and don't obstruct movement. Also they fit under most pants without being noticed so you can go about your day without having to drop trow in a public place to take them off.
FoodPorn,fcadjbe,t1_fc9hkpo,1577567386.0,Got ya! Still looks pretty killer!
FoodPorn,fc8xz5w,t3_egl5vq,1577543888.0,Looks awesome! Next time replace the bacon with some Spanish chorizo (the cured kind) or andouille. Both will spice it up a bit but different types of spice. It will rock some socks.
