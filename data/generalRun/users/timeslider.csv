I know this because my sister, who I've never met, called one day and left a voice message while he was out. This was back in the days before internet and when voice messages played out loud (do they still do that? Seems like a privacy issue). She said she thinks my dad is her father and if he ever wants to meet her, she would be down for it. When my dad came home, he immediately deleted it and said she was probably just after his money. That didn't make any sense because he doesn't have any money. His behavior was odd that day.

Fast forward about 20 years. I suddenly recalled this exchange and decide to do some digging. I found my dads brothers and sisters on Facebook, asked them about it, and they got me in contact with her. She *was* the one who left the message all those years ago and she told me about my other siblings. I've messaged one other one and he is very upset about the situation. He doesn't understand why my dad gave him up and didn't give up me and my brother. It basically boils down to my dad being a piece of shit. My dad even named the guy I messaged and my brother the exact same name—first, middle, and last. My dad never told me loved me. He likes to get people pissed off just for fun.
