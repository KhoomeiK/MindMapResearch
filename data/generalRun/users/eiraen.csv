WTF,ffpmprt,t3_eud3qw,1580098914.0,Hella gross. I once had an ant in my ear but this....
AskReddit,ffpm7mb,t1_ffp462f,1580098525.0,"Once i saw a comment of a guy with a (ex?) gf doing this. Your story but reversed genders. He was like WTF as well and she thought it was normal. She was trying to flush it down as he entered. ""almost ready honey."" Something like that lol."
aspergers,ffnxe4y,t1_ffnwz7z,1580071980.0,"It helped me understand myself and my Tinder Match better without meeting her. Yeah, it's for entertainment mainly. Like astrology but a little more reasonable to me. It helped me accept myself with other personality tests and i don't let it be taken away even though it may not be scientifically 100% accurate. People still quote Freud, so?"
aspergers,ffnwea0,t1_ffnvcvq,1580071602.0,No?
Thoughts,ffngihe,t3_eu7ynm,1580065645.0,Well the female equivalent is a girl getting oral from a lesbian girl and claims she's far better at it than any guys she's been with. Because lesbians certainly know how to please a girl orally
Thoughts,ffngd33,t1_ffmx2iq,1580065577.0,They're really enthusiastic about sucking cocks. Not every girl is into that.
aspergers,ffne9nf,t3_eu6k8v,1580064810.0,I see it everywhere as a INTP-A
introvert,ffmy8sw,t3_eu614e,1580060160.0,I struggled with this but i came to terms with it. Let your laughs and smiles be genuine. If you fake it people will tell and it comes across really (more) weird.
AskRedditAfterDark,ffmwgsl,t1_ffmsq6j,1580059671.0,What zones can i explore for that reason? Try out everywhere and look when she likes it? F.ex. Around the clit most likely. I heard you must be careful with fingers though.
dating_advice,fflaew1,t1_ffkm2sr,1580037065.0,Maybe you allowed her to be playful and fun. You know forgetting about adult stuff and just having fun talking and being playful with each other.

AskRedditAfterDark,ffl39ra,t1_ffkyzts,1580034014.0,"Well maybe it is, but i don't think it was superb technique by my side."
dating_advice,ffl321d,t1_ffkz9be,1580033892.0,"Yeah right now OP holds (or held) her higher than their relationship was. If she thinks differently of him in the future, she can approach him. I've done it couple times in my life where i thought i was reaching out, didn't meet reciprocation and concluded that they would need to reach out and moved on. Right now two kinda do, but until they know and communicate what they want, I'm shrugging my shoulders because ive met a girl on Tinder and we match quite well. OP just needs to talk to other people and move on."
AskRedditAfterDark,ffkujvd,t3_eu1uyp,1580029149.0,"I would, but i don't know how (unexperienced). I did it to a girl in 69 loosing my v card, but that's not excactly oral."

dating_advice,ffi4guf,t1_ffi3pbs,1579964813.0,What i meant was it takes time to build connections with people
dating_advice,ffi29r9,t3_etp3mk,1579962961.0,"I can speak from own experience, you mustn't think of people like a vending machine. You put effort and hints (that you like someone) and immediately get the same level of feelings back. That doesn't work that way except they have a crush on you as well. That often needs to build and that present showed her you pay attention and are willing to do selfless gifts. Gift them your good traits and don't expect too much right away. Like a good plant it needs time and water. This probably doesn't make sense. Good bye.

Edit: thx for the award"
Tinder,ffi1pdv,t3_eto0cq,1579962454.0,At least you guys can express yourselves and discuss expectations in proper language and manner. You got that going for you.
AskReddit,ffi076t,t3_etcyd6,1579961035.0,"Accept by communicating that you're okay with men not 100% being emotionless rocks all the time. If you're only attracted to emotionless rocks who suck in all your drama, don't expect them to ever talk about their inner world."
Cigarettes,ffhzbw8,t3_etk2jw,1579960170.0, Beautiful. I remember the feeling when i smoke in beautiful places. I think you feel nature much more intense that way. I prefer calm places though.
AskMenAdvice,ffhz2qd,t1_ffhyze9,1579959905.0,Dear lord. Askwomen would go crazy. He's absolutely harmful! He's using violence on you. Leave him and seek friends help. They will help you for sure. Maybe go to the police together.
AskMenAdvice,ffhyze9,t3_etomwu,1579959810.0,Please go to the police and leave him! Stay at friends house if you feel unsafe!

de,ff94ma4,t3_es929b,1579704721.0,"Bin positiv überrascht, dass die Mehrheit hier erkannt hat, dass es einfach krasse Hysterie war und den Verantwortlichen (im Zweifel Handwerkskammer, Steuerberaterkammern etc) seit 3 Jahren bekannt war. Es ist halt die deutsche Mentalität, bei Veränderung erstmal fett zu flennen und dann nach kurzer Zeit zu verstummen weil man merkt, dass es gar nicht so Armageddon mäßig ist und das Leben weiter geht. Genau wegen sowas können wir nicht über Veränderungen jeglicher Art sprechen, weil die Politiker wissen, dass die Leute in Panik geraten und so tun, als wäre die Zukunft komplett blank und nicht mehr planbar wenn man an Stellschrauben dreht. Genau das appealt der Union, die ironischerweise für die Bonausgabepflicht war und jüngst auch mit der Widerspruchslösung tatsächlich etwas wagen wollte. Aber die Biedermeier sind ihnen dazwischen gefunkt.
Werden wir vielleicht bald mal über Cannabis Legalisierung reden können oder haben wir in 10 Jahren immer noch den Kopf im Sand und den Stock im Arsch? (rhetorische Frage)"

askwomenadvice,feyoijy,t1_feynt7w,1579448311.0,"Sigh. This is so shitty. Im so sorry for her. :/ Its like women need to make the emotional work (""that's nice from you, but..."") for the men, so they don't feel bad about themselves that they're completely off and to blame for the entire situation."
askwomenadvice,feynmem,t1_feyjfxw,1579448031.0,"Yeah, i guess the ""im taken"" implies for those fuckers that the only reason for the girl not hook up is their relationship status. They understand ""oh hell yeah, but i have a bf/married sorry honey. I guess no??"". When in reality you simply mean ""im not interested in you. Fuck off."" I think women should say that more direct."

You're attracted to each other and want to make each other feel good. Maybe you'll find less interest in doing your content on reddit (that be no problem for him probably but for your hobby). But you gotta watch out if he feels like you show less interest in him at one point and increase your activities, your search for erotic confirmation on the Internet. Not that he feels like left out and stonewalled. Or that it makes him insecure that he needs to always confirm his attraction to you or else you're looking for it elsewhere. I think you gotta make sure to always talk out your emotions and thoughts with each other. :) And not swallow wrong conclusions and let it build into jealousy or things that could damage your relationship. Maybe you know what I mean. :) 

Just my thought."

Weirder girls were easier to deal with than weirder boys growing up. Also i love to make girls/womens smile and laugh. Boys would be weird about it, especially if girls are around they would feel the competition sense pulsating. Seen it so often."
Tinder,fesuezs,t1_fesq27z,1579369098.0,"Doesn't need to mean something. Maybe she's bored, needs affirmation, distraction from her ex.

If the person you're seeing releases all his/her emotional baggage right away, you wouldn't like it. How can you see the beautiful in someone's mind if the main thing you're getting is their issues? I guess women think that but stronger. They don't want to be your therapist and that you depend on them for your self worth during causal dating. They think it will become more if they keep dating you, so they back away. 

If you blame it all on the women being superstitious and hypocrits and everything's right with you, then that's an Incel mindset right there."

Ffs, what do you see in her? She's in school, you think she knows what she wants, who she is or who she wants to become?

In an other example, there was a German guy wrongly sitting in prisons for years and when he finally could leave, he took his plant with him. There's a famous pic of him confirming this.

relationship_advice,fdlitae,t1_fdlifol,1578524957.0,"No date yet. Would be kinda logical to ask her out, yeah. But I would need to phrase the ""What made you reply"" a little different. Idk, doesn't translate well."
relationship_advice,fdlihv1,t1_fdli49n,1578524753.0,True. So asking out for a coffee would be a good idea you think?
relationship_advice,fdliew8,t1_fdli4ho,1578524701.0,The fuck mate
relationship_advice,fdlibei,t1_fdli5d8,1578524638.0,Huh. That's an idea. Thx
aspergers,fdlh96v,t3_elx09w,1578523979.0,"Omg, my life right now. Im making decisions which benefit me and apparently im the annoying (?) one. I just want to be decisive. I was driver for a party and told someone to look for a lift elsewhere because he's notorious for drinking too much and vomiting. I don't want anyone to vomit in my car. Apparently he told someone he doesn't want that i sit in his car again (to go to uni). Like dude, taking it personally now?

Second, i want to leave the party at 23:20 because its boring already and I'm tired. I'll get weird looks for leaving that early tomorrow, I'll promise."
Tinder,fdlc3dp,t1_fdl3q18,1578520842.0,I do couple times. Lol
