For some reason, it was pointed out that they were not endangered at all?"

I was walking back from the kitchen and bit into a sausage and the door slammed on my finger. I obviously sucked in real hard with the pain and the sausage was just lodged, if my husband hadn’t have been there to do the Heimlich and smack me on the back, I’d have been a gonna."
DoesAnybodyElse,feoeyhw,t3_eq2txr,1579299156.0,"I feel like this, where I work people chat with me etc but because I have a stressful job and can lose my temper, I feel they include me to try and appease me because my reputation obviously precedes me. They seem genuinely surprised that when I’m not stressed at all, I’m a nice person. I get on really well with my daughters boyfriend but secretly, I think he dislikes me. Its just a vibe that I get."
AskReddit,feo3t9m,t3_eq1wzh,1579294714.0,"My house to blow up with none of us in it. Too many things need doing to it, I hate the fact it doesn’t feel like a home and never has, I’m embarrassed when people come to visit and we don’t have enough time or money to do it up (or the inclination now to be honest). Worth more levelled than it is now insurance wise and the neighbours are shits. Always said if I won the lottery, I’d do it all up and let the homeless live there free of charge."

When it came down to it, I couldn’t remember whether it was 1 ounce of pudding rice or 1 pound. Instead of having a nice bowl of creamy rice pudding, he had a slice."

If I was able to have children now, I seriously would not want to expose a child to this fucked up world, never thought I’d ever say this but there is too much prejudice, hate and lack of moral fibre beginning with World leaders to moronic followers. Lack of concern for climate change and don’t even get me started on anti vaxxers. I believe its pretty much going to get worse."

My husband has raced pigeons for years and was taught everything by his grandfather, while he knows of the pouter breed, he said he had never heard of a thief pouter before reading this and wondered what the hell he would get out of enticing feral birds into his lofts to infect them all for no gain?"

books,fc85qmy,t3_egerl3,1577527467.0,"I don’t understand why he was allowed to flaunt and describe his relationships with teenagers in interviews without being challenged but then in the article it describes ‘shockwaves’ sent around the literary world when he had already more or less confessed and it was accepted previously? Morality needs to come before intellect, artistry or just being famous as it concludes in the article."
rant,fc3086y,t1_fc1be9b,1577378486.0,"I genuinely think people really do change. It could be job pressure and everyday life etc and unfortunately we take it out on the one person that we feel we can afford to argue with as we accepted for better or worse together and they use to be there for you. I find now after 30 odd years marriage that I can pick up the vibe of an argument beginning, by sarky remarks that often are followed by ‘oh I’m only joking’ if I get upset and then there is the excuse of a cold shoulder for a day or two as though I am the one too sensitive and miserable and not able to take a joke. I deflect these often by just going somewhere else in the house and saying ‘ I’m just going to do this’ so he won’t follow. If it carries on, I just agree him laughing and by this I’m not giving in, I’m just not giving him the ammunition to start and it tends to knock the wind out of his sails. I don’t know what he gets out of it, I hate arguments over petty things and can never understand anyone that feels the need to instigate one. . He never use to be like this, he was easy going and caring and still is to some extent but as usual, he has a lot to deal with in everyday life and frustrations will come home with him. There is a difference if someone is mean though and not joking and that could be the start of an unhealthy relationship."

It was a formidable display of power and the actual length and height of them is unbelievable."
