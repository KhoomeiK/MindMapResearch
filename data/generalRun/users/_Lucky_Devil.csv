If you spend 45-60 minutes working on this every day, but the owner does nothing to work on it the rest of the time - there will never be progress... or if there is any progress it will be at a glacial pace, and only for you (ie the dog will still pull like a freight train with the owner).

Have you tried working - just - on focus and engagement outside? If the dog is soooooo distracted outside that it can't pay attention, you'll never be able to teach it anything. Work on eye contact and offered attention in distracting environments.

Also, you are a dog walker, not a dog trainer, it's not your job to train this dog. If you're not enjoying walking the dog because it's a complete shit-show, fire the client."

dogs,felapjb,t3_epq6ut,1579217772.0,"Fear of novelty is a ""default setting"" for animals and is absolutely normal for any animal (it's a survival mechanism). There doesn't need to be any traumatic experience with an object for a dog to be fearful of it if they've never had experience with that object before. Were talking about insufficient exposure and genetics here, plain and simple.

Unless balloons start to equal good things for the dog (ie when balloons show up hot dogs start raining from the sky), then their feeling about them will not change."
dogs,fel9z99,t3_epr12r,1579217304.0,"If a behavior is being exhibited in a desire for attention, the only thing you can do is ignore it - the animal needs to learn that barking does not work to illicit attention from you.

If the dog starts exhibiting a behavior in a desire for attention that cannot be ignored (ie nipping), then I would suggest putting the dog into a ""time out"" so they cannot continue to rehearse the unwanted behavior. A time out would be either putting the puppy in an exercise pen or tethering them to something so they cannot physically reach you and nip.

That being said, the biggest mistake people make with the use of time outs is that they put the puppy/dog in a time-out for much too long. So long that the dog has looooooong forgotten what they did to get put into a time-out in the first place, thus losing a learning opportunity. It's MUCH more effective to put the dog in very short time-outs so the dog can put together what behavior is causing the time-out.

So, lets say the puppy starts nipping you (I would already have the dog wearing a harness and dragging the leash so this doesn't inadvertently turn into a game of ""catch me if you can."" Nothing about this should be fun or feel like attention), don't react, try to not even look at the dog, just grab the leash and walk the dog to a piece of furniture, tether them to it, and walk away matter of fact. No emotion, no attention, just nipping = you get freedom taken away.

Go back to what you were doing and wait 10 seconds.

Let the dog go and resume what you were doing. If the dog starts nipping again, grab the leash and tether them again. This time wait 15 seconds. Repeat a third time if necessary, and on the third strike wait 20 seconds.

If after three times, they're right back at it, then they're too excited/aroused to learn effectively, and I would time them out until they calm down/settle. Then start this exercise all over again. The point is that you need repetitions close together for the animal to be able to put together what behavior = loss of freedom, and waiting too long in between hinders that learning.

Now.... lets chat about ""extinction bursts.""

Sometimes ignoring can feel like it's not working, and can even make the behavior get worse, but the getting worse is what is called an ""extinction burst."" An extinction burst is when the unwanted behavior gets worse before it gets better during the beginning stages of being ""ignored."" The dog is saying this to itself: ""Hey, this has always worked before.... I must not be barking loud enough, or long enough. Somehow they're just not noticing me. I just need to try harder.""  If you can stick to your guns and get through that curve, the attention seeking behavior will eventually become ""extinct"" because they learn it no longer works.

The problem can be that when a behavior starts getting worse, most folks cave - so you've essentially trained the dog to bark louder for longer. Your dog has just been trained that if he is persistent enough that he will win and the behavior will work. This is bad news all the way around. Especially with demand barking."

Also try to take video of the behavior to share with a vet who otherwise will not be able to observe the behavior since it requires speed/trot to present itself.

Then go to a vet."
