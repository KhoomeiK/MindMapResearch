Depending on how closely you have followed politics in the last 15 or so years, it has come up quite a few times.  It's one of those phrases that has been around for several hundred years, but you won't find it in the Constitution.  It basically means that while a an ambassador (or other appointment) is nominated by the president and approved by the Senate, the position has no term.  The position ends when the president says it ends.  

Usually, presidents will ""fire"" political appointments but will allow career diplomats to serve a 3 year ""term"", even though the term doesnt actually exist.  They can still be fired at any time, it's just not as common.  They serve at the pleasure of the president.

If you google the phrase and add Obama or bush you'll find plenty examples of how common it is"
