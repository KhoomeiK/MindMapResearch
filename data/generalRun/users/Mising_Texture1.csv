The other kinds of implants and modifications (the ones that are visible) tend to be a replacement of a certain part or a way to increase performance in very specific ways, like Kellogg’s Arm or Lou’s eye.

The second type of implant is more rare, though, and it’s prominently featured on Cyberdogs, an (obviously) non human subject, something that could led us to believe that non-subdermal implants were rare for humans to have, as opposed to other more discreet upgrades to the human body.

It is of note that cybernetic organs exist, but it is unknown if the public ever knew of these types of technology, since it can only be seen in Old World Blues’s Lobotomites.

falloutlore,ffbb78y,t3_eozkr4,1579758235.0,"I always wanted to tackle this one, since most people like to talk about this without paying too much attention to what Myron says.

Let’s establish the basis.

The mordinos wanted a better drug to expand their drug empire.

In fact, Big Jesus Mordino wanted a more addictive drug that made their workers work harder.

So, a performance enhancer with a high rate of addiction.

Myron was the one employed to make this a reality.

Most of his early work was futile since the climate and working conditions didn’t let him produce the materials to manufacture the intended drugs, settling for mushrooms. 

The thing is, the slaves employed by the Mordinos were getting high from the fumes of the brahmin feces. So Myron noticed traces of an Anphetamine-like substance in the feces.

Myron traced this back to a Pre-war experiment backed by the meat industry to try to create a cheap protein for growing food, which was corrupted by a type of skin bacteria, so they gave it to the cattle in order to avoid a total loss.

The protein in question and it’s effects was integrated into the cattle’s own metabolism, making them a walking Anphetamine dispenser.

So, with that out of the way, let’s take a deeper look at what we know.

What do we need to make Jet?

Brahmin Shit and a container to inhale it?

Well, yes, but technically, no.

We need the feces of an animal infected with the corrupt protein.

The cow, as we know, has 4 sections of stomachs. So, in this case the protein which works like an Anphetamine passes through the animal’s body and is then eliminated through the anus.

The cow is a sort of refinery for the protein, similar to how people feed elephants coffee seeds to make stronger coffee from the seeds then encountered in their feces.

The cows in particular kind of adopted this property into their systems, so now they would no longer need to be fed said protein for their feces to contain the anphetamine-like substance. 

With that established, Pre-war Jet is totally possible, if we take into consideration all of the materials needed to make it are available in the pre-war world.

But let’s go further.

A brahmin is essentially two cows conjoined, right?

They have 2 brains, 2 hearts, 4 lungs, and, you guessed right, 8 stomachs.

So, a Brahmin would be able to make a better Jet, more concentrated than their pre-war variant, but to a certain degree still not that different to be important.

When we talk with Myron he is very defensive of his supposed creation,  but he lets some things slip up that give us a very interesting picture.

He knows a lot about chemistry and drugs, I’ll give it that. A bit too much. 

He mentions by name LSD, Cocaine and opium poppies. All of them are drugs that were on the pre-war world (and we know that most of them can’t grow on the post-war world). That’s not necessarily common knowledge or knowledge that’s easily accessible, you don’t just open a book and casually stumble with the elements needed to create LSD or make cocaine, he clearly had  to have access to something more specific. We would be giving him too much credit if we said that he just figured out what those drugs were or how to make them out of mostly thin air. How he obtained this knowledge is unknown, but that leads us to something else.

Remember the cheap protein, the reason jet exists?

Myron himself tells us of this, so, to a degree, he has knowledge as to how brahmin shit gets you high. That’s a very specific kind of information to have. Again, it’s not common knowledge or easily accesible knowledge that certain meat industry did an oopsie and fed contaminated supplements to their cattle, nor is it information that logically would be easily available even during pre-war, being most likely a secret between the people who would profit from that.

My headcanon in relation to this is that Myron not really invented jet, but instead rediscovered the way to produce it using some of his mysterious sources of information to pinpoint the reason as to why Brahmin shit had those properties in the first place, likely taking inspiration to make then a “new drug”.

Jet took refining for Myron to get the results he wished for, so his creation could be considered a new drug, but taking all of this into consideration, Myron’s Jet is like the Turbo of the Pre-war Jet, so, instead of being a new drug. his creation is like a new line in the same brand of products."

Homosexuality is probably rampant, since their camps are essentially a sausage party and outside the occasional raped slave, I don’t think the legion soldiers have that much thrusting action during their lives, so homies sucking each other may very well be pretty common among lower ranks and to some degree in higher ranks.

If my memory is not failing me, higher ranks in the legion have “spouses”  as their property, something that you could say to Melissa  from the Khans to dissuade her from supporting the legion, since she was convinced that she could join their ranks, oblivious to the fact that the Legion have women as slaves and cumdumpsters."
