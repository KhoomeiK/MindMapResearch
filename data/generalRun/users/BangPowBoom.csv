You claimed to know that Hillary wouldn't have been impeached or that the state of affairs wouldn't be the same or similar to what they are now. Neither of us could know that. Trump wasn't impeached for anything that went on during the 2016 election. He was impeached for something that happened last year. Hillary, in my opinion, is just as likely to get busted for something shady.
