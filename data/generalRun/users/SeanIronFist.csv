We have something called Kinalas and Log-Log are mami or noodle soup dishes, Bicol style(from where I live). They are made up of flavorful broth, fresh noodles, and, akin to Log-Log's counterpart in other places, a thick savory sauce. The sauce, however, is not red-orange but deep brown.

The most common(that I know of) is called Siling Labuyo. 

As for the fish sauce, one such example is Datu Puti Patis Flavor and the soy sauce is from Silver Swan Soy Sauce"
