*This* guy comes out of the situation (IMO) looking like a selfish  person who has no respect for the people around him or common decency (don't smoke in a room full of strangers). If you want to see some real activism look at someone like Marc Emery who was snatched away from his home country and thrown in a US prison for 5 years over selling some seeds online. It's not hard to feel sympathetic for Mr. Emery's situation because the government's reaction was harsh and extreme for something so benign.

personalfinance,ffog36t,t1_ffobl39,1580077295.0,Great advice. You should definitely know exactly what you want to buy and have financing secured before you begin this process.
personalfinance,ffof3oi,t1_ffm969p,1580077026.0,"Definitely return it if you have to but either way go online and shop around for better rates. You should quality for the prime used car rate at any bank/CU so you can compare advertised rates between banks before running your credit. When I bought my wife's car I found a local credit union offering 2.15% and got preapproved. When I went to the dealer I never mentioned I had my own financing just to see what they would offer me and the guy came back with something ridiculous like 5.5%. Once I told him I was already approved at the lower rate through this CU he was magically able to match it and give me the same 2.15% rate through the same CU but handled ""in house"" at the dealership (just for convenience purposes). 

They get a kick back for giving you the higher rate loans and if you don't know any better (because you might not have gotten quotes before hand) then they'll try to give you the highest rate they can reasonably offer."
