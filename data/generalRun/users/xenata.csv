That said, actual conspiracy theorists will then use what has come to light about Epstein to further other narratives that are entirely unrelated and unsupported by the facts that we now have. 

Also, if a person believed epstein was a pedophile and whatever else based on ideology like the pizza gaters, then they were conspiracy theorists then, and still likely are now. I'm not sure if you know much about pizza gaters but they more or less believe everyone in government is a pedophile(and some believe they eat babies), regardless of any evidence to support it."

I personally would never find myself in a situation like that to be making that decision to begin with because I find aggressive wars reprehensible, which would have led me to leaving Germany long before being drafted into their ranks.
