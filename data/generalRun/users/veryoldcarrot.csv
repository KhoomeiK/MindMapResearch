TalesFromThePharmacy,felyk1k,t1_fe0cl8f,1579234237.0,No. Some were looking tired or just resigned to a long wait. I think the attitude of the staff helped with that. They were calm and efficient and I could sense that and hear them moving things along while giving each person at the counter their undivided attention...and I was back about 12th or so in line. Of course I don't know what happened before I got there or after I left.
CasualConversation,fdk5ps3,t3_el9s14,1578496667.0,That's for damn sure!
CasualConversation,fdj897p,t3_eljh5g,1578461272.0,I got a second piercing in one ear just so I could use my odd earrings
CasualConversation,fdj52gu,t1_fdgfd8q,1578458661.0,Beautiful
CasualConversation,fdj505h,t3_el9s14,1578458610.0,They have supposedly found that trauma can alter your DNA and in that way the traumatic events  of your ancestor gets passed down through to future generations. (think trauma such as experienced by a holocaust survivor) Why not such moments of profound love? Wouldn't that be a wondrous thing to pass down to your progeny?
TalesFromThePharmacy,fdgwvsf,t1_fdgh6sr,1578410319.0,Thanks for the work you do and thanks for caring about the people you serve
quityourbullshit,fdfnsbz,t3_eksn2d,1578365971.0,Well done and well said good sir!
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdfm9ib,t1_fdfl1qc,1578364972.0,Thanks. Theres too much negativity in the world and it takes so little to be kind.
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdflyma,t1_fdcym2k,1578364776.0,I'll go share it there too!
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdflv6a,t1_fddfxdc,1578364712.0,I'm doing ok with it. It takes a little more work and adjusting to get the numbers I need but its sure an improvement over none. I lost my insurance and had been without from April to Oct.
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdflnv4,t1_fddncp3,1578364581.0,I sent them almost the same email. I think I'm going to call too.
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdflk5s,t1_fddo6qf,1578364514.0,Exactly! It only takes a minute and makes a difference!
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdflh3l,t1_fddzzbo,1578364459.0,I appreciate that you can still smile and be helpful on top of being precise and accurate! I always rely on my pharmacist for any questions about my meds and respect a doctor that is willing to ask the pharmacist for info!
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdfl6ep,t1_fde1zn4,1578364262.0,"I filled out their survey and emailed the same thing to them about their great service. You're right, a call too is a good idea."
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdfl12v,t1_fdejgvw,1578364165.0,People can be so rude when all a customer rep is doing is their job and trying to help. That makes it tough to keep smiling & being nice to the next people in line.
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdfkt71,t1_fdepu9p,1578364022.0,"I did, almost word for word. I'm that weirdo who calls the grocery store after I leave to let them know how helpful and kind the checkout person/bagger were and I often as for the manager at restaurants to tell them how wonderful the food & service were. Everyone is so quick to complain but people seldom compliment good service when it happens."
YouShouldKnow,fchh20f,t1_fbxyctf,1577650379.0,I do. I still have it but I take lactaid and only eat it on my way home lol
YouShouldKnow,fchgbxy,t1_fby100s,1577650245.0,"I love the lactaid milk, Walmart has a cheaper version that's just as good. I hate that non dairy things cost so much more. Puts them out of my budget."
YouShouldKnow,fcfuunx,t1_fbygqm1,1577633951.0,I use the pills all the time and they work for me for most things.  For some reason they don't help with cream cheese or sour cream for me.
YouShouldKnow,fcftdaj,t1_fbxi1b0,1577633547.0,I think it's called xylitol. Its deadly for dogs too
YouShouldKnow,fbxn5wd,t1_fbxj9kj,1577194600.0,My doc explained that it can come on suddenly after years with no problem.  Sometimes your body just stops making the enzyme after an illness or if you've gone through some big stress
