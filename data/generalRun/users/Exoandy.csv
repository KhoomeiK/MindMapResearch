nba,ffz58jg,t1_ffyvsg8,1580364421.0,Wow. This is amazing (in the worst way possible).
nba,ffz1l1c,t1_ffz00lr,1580361008.0,Could you have imagined if there was a game on Tuesday?
nba,ffytngi,t1_ffynes1,1580354849.0,You know how we can commemorate Kobe on this sub? Creating a new award for clutch plays; The Mamba Mentality award!
nintendo,ffynf2f,t3_evsqi7,1580350567.0,Shoot me a free code and I’ll leave you a glowing Reddit comment.
lakers,ffy6y1o,t1_ffy0a5u,1580339749.0,Agreed. Some people don’t see the difference at all I guess. I hope he doesn’t get picked up by another agency or gigs.
lakers,ffxqvvi,t1_ffxe6tt,1580330635.0,"I mean, I follow the logic that hes trolling but be it as it may, you’re going to reap what you sow."
nba,ffxn1uh,t1_ffxg71s,1580328462.0,RDA for Troll HOF
lakers,ffws6ey,t1_ffvejl7,1580309729.0,LeBron is cool and him winning one in LA would certainly elevate him but hes never coming close to Kobe as a Laker. We watched Kobe grow up in our city for 20 years - which is why he is such an LA icon.
lakers,ffukh2z,t1_ffugb84,1580243855.0,Cross streets are Lebanon and Cameron. Just Google Map “Kobe Bryant Mural” once you’re at the Convention Center.
nba,ffsg42e,t3_euyfxi,1580180867.0,"One of my favorite Kobe highlights of all time. You can also see a dude in the background adjusting his junk at the 40 second mark,"
nba,ffruazg,t1_ffrrzjo,1580165987.0,"Thats kind of a funny thing to say out loud - that a game is too emotional. But its completely true. Its just such a bleak mood here in LA. I feel like Im being strangled just talking about him because he was such a public, constant figure here and now hes just gone...just like that."
nba,ffo9doo,t1_ffo6ifv,1580075358.0,Just checked - lowest tix are nearly 2 grand.
nba,ffmw6u0,t1_ffkjb2p,1580059582.0,You know it!!!

nba,ffe7dcf,t1_ffdzywx,1579838675.0,This is exactly how I feel. It looks kinda bland and boring but also so monotone compared to all the other NBA courts that its jarring to see.
nba,ffdmyp6,t1_ffcb1nz,1579824317.0,They’re okay. Helps that they get awesome guests.
nba,ffdms90,t1_ffdlwba,1579824207.0,"Dudley is a wild man. I’m convinced that if need be, he would fling his poo on the court in order to win the game. Veteran move."
nba,ffdm5e9,t1_ffdm3bz,1579823817.0,BUT HE GET PAID!!!!
nba,ffdl9nz,t1_ffdkon7,1579823276.0,But not laid man.

SmashBrosUltimate,fenoocv,t1_fen451i,1579288677.0,People are weird
smashbros,fekegrv,t1_fekannk,1579198344.0,"Yeah. And I get people are disappointed (can’t please everyone) and thats fine, but the Smash community is pretty toxic about it, even ironically."
smashbros,fek9x6a,t1_fek899q,1579195655.0,Meltdown is pretty bad. Youtube dislikes and comments just to start with. Yikes. Its embarrassing.
smashbros,fek9qjr,t1_fek2u2y,1579195546.0,Fuck me? Fuck you!
smashbros,fek5sg7,t3_epkmbp,1579193203.0,Exactly. You need a character whos going to be able to sell the pack as the first and then some sort of follow through with the following characters to keep interest going. Byleth just makes sense right now with it being the last in this pack plus cross promotion since its still fresh.
nintendo,fejuiyv,t1_fejtdk5,1579186161.0,Agreed. Smash community are party poopers in general.
nba,fej3ob6,t3_epen6c,1579155700.0,"See, I like Kyrie. Hes entertaining on and off the court. But saying shit like this - I get why it might be difficult to work with him. Regardless, Kyrie keeps it entertaining."
smashbros,fehp7q0,t1_feg3d67,1579121113.0,"I don’t think Nintendo would blow their wad here and show two new characters. I think at best we’ll  get info on the new DLC; amount of new fighters, time frame, costs - just the logistics. But who knows, Nintendo does stuff out of left field from time to time."
nihilism,feee5hy,t1_fee17wc,1579031894.0,"That sounds like a fantastic, balanced meal. Good stuff!!"
nihilism,fedrn8e,t3_eomliw,1579018416.0,I am making enchiladas tonight for dinner. Today is good day.
lakers,feabuxd,t1_fea1obb,1578946770.0,Laker fanbase is the Uchiha of sports fandom.
lakers,feab343,t1_fe9sio8,1578946494.0,Passionate to a fault I would say but passionate nonetheless.
nba,fdreggd,t1_fdqucca,1578683377.0,Exactly. Even when the Knicks were mediocre they were treated like Finals contender. The Nets can be good next season but its not going to be the same as if the Knicks were decent. Same thing with the Lakers and Clippers; Same city but the fanhood and media attention just isn’t there.
nba,fdm9zxp,t1_fdm77hb,1578543547.0,This man just can’t help himself can he??
nba,fdlp6ne,t1_fdlokmg,1578529187.0,Thank u bby
nba,fdfe7rh,t1_fdezlnj,1578359620.0,I honestly wouldn’t make much of it given the team overall has experience together and its two well experience superstars. Its a marathon after all.
nba,fdfdkmr,t1_fdfbhjt,1578359187.0,Fuckit thats hilarious.
lakers,fdf8rri,t1_fdd22n0,1578355951.0,I made a similar comment earlier. This dude is just living the dream - playing on the Lakers and dunking with Dwight and LeBron fucking James right behind you. How cool is that?
nba,fdf6cv6,t1_fdenqq8,1578354331.0,I think its the contract more than anything. Teams will take on players with bad attitudes as long as they play well on court. What play-off contending team can realistically can trade for him? Portland? Sac? NOLA? Miami? Indy? Those teams have huge asterisks as to why they can’t make the trade for Love. Im sure it must be a pain in the ass to construct the trade all around and trying to make the money work while not giving too many assets away. If there is one man that loves complex trades its Morey. I would love to hear that dude’s take on the trade scenarios.
nba,fdeo05j,t1_fdd3rwy,1578343037.0,Caruso is living the dream; on Lakers and dunking with LeBron AND Dwight jumping right behind you?!?! Thats pretty fucking dope. I’m genuinely happy for the guy.
nba,fden3gf,t1_fdely2p,1578342501.0,I don’t know about y’all but these 60 degree weather these days ain’t the business.

nba,fde7vmo,t1_fde7447,1578333107.0,I want to see Blake dunk with crutches.
nba,fdbr4ez,t1_fdbql6p,1578260613.0,I did not know that. That sucks. A lot.
nba,fdbpun3,t1_fdarkoa,1578260037.0,Most expensive player trainer.
nba,fdaqy80,t1_fdapnie,1578249100.0,If they could package him with Rondo that would be the bees knees.
nba,fda82f4,t1_fd6vfq4,1578242796.0,Kuz would do some weird shit like that
nba,fda2ahq,t1_fd7e4mq,1578240841.0,Never getting off the Lonzo hype train.
nba,fd65y1t,t1_fd5lytz,1578185982.0,"I like it. All the greats have simple, short names they go by. This bolds well for Ja."
nba,fczv9xu,t1_fczqz1l,1578109208.0,No. It was a response to your comment that sometimes interactions indeed do happen between refs and players and they can be misconstrued. Im not saying IT was innocent - Im simply saying thats a lot to assume for people to definitively say IT was obviously shoving the ref right away. That happened so quick I dont even know how people say it was blatantly obvious.
nba,fczpk7y,t1_fczlj2l,1578106326.0,Carlos Boozer once punched a ref in the dick. Shit happens.
nba,fczcjio,t1_fczbei7,1578098186.0,Its honestly hard to tell even with a replay.
LosAngeles,fcxptft,t1_fcvxlry,1578068616.0,Nah.
nba,fcw6sds,t1_fcvvqfq,1578018459.0,SAY IT LOUDER!! This is an All Star game and the PEOPLE want to see Caruso vs Tacko.
LosAngeles,fcw3mpk,t1_fcv4bk2,1578016382.0,AhhhhAhhhhhohahhhhhhh
nba,fcv8mh2,t1_fcv8a57,1577996922.0,Hell yeah boiii
nba,fcs90r6,t3_einpvm,1577913161.0,The league wouldn’t be where it is today without David Stern. RIP.
