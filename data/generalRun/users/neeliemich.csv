StardewValley,ffhi9s6,t3_etdzjh,1579936466.0,"I began playing Stardew last year right before my papaw's funeral. My cousins thought it might not have been a good idea, but I found that the 200+ hrs I put into that first save file was the best therapy ever. 

A year later, I have lost my uncle and I'm now playing through my first modded version of Stardew. I'm in love with all the carefully chosen mods I put in."
