""A very few times each year a bull will be indultado, or ""pardoned,"" meaning his life is spared due to outstanding behavior in the bullring, leading the audience to petition the president of the ring with white handkerchiefs. The bullfighter joins the petition, as it is a great honor to have a bull one has fought pardoned. The president pardons the bull showing an orange handkerchief. The bull, if he survives his injuries, which are usually severe, is then returned to the ranch he was bred at, where he will live out his days in the fields. In most cases, he will become a ""seed bull"", mated once with some 30 cows. Four years later, his offspring will be tested in the ring. If they fight well, he may be bred again.
An ""indultado"" bull's lifespan can be 20 to 25 years"""
