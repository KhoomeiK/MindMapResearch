AskReddit,fdeknfk,t3_ekutu8,1578341047.0,"Not in the final edit but the deleted scene in Terminator 2 where they take the chip out to 'flick a switch so that he can learn' makes zero sense. 

1  Firstly why would this option be on a fucking switch?? 

2: Why would a Terminator agree to leave them all defenceless for such a pointless reason?

3: Then Sarah Conner has a moment of crisis and nearly destroys the chip with a hammer despite the fact she saw they would be dead within 5 seconds of the T-1000 finding them without Arnie around.

The tone and dialog is like another film. I think subconsciously they acted that scene so badly to get it canned. Thank god."

Trying to ski hundreds of meters up and downhill while pissed up and so close to other competitors on skis. AND then having to stop now and again to shoot a rifle that gives you an extra 150m to ski for any missed shots. There would be so much blood and puke."
todayilearned,fckpjcc,t1_fckjnt7,1577730410.0,Ah I did exactly the same. That was the first few episodes of the first series. I totally agree they overdid the drooling and belching every 5 seconds and it was just gross and annoying but trust me someone told them and after about the 4th episode it stops. Stick with it it's worth it trust me.

AMA,fcb02b3,t3_egolhy,1577580000.0,"So, I need to know the thought process here. When you look at this as a decision in your mind you don't just jump to that without a reason, right? 

So what is it exactly about your life that always leads you to this conclusion? 

*Studies not what you want?* - Then Quit

*But lots of money will be wasted! I'll be broke!* - Go bankrupt. Money is a construct anyway, it's not real (you don't evaporate if you lose it all tomorrow) Theres a whole system to carry on. Lots of successful and famous people actually went bankrupt a few times)

*People will think I'm a failure* - Nope. School isn't everything. You can work your way up being an expert and get on the job training in lots of businesses. Or work hard and start your own.

What I'm trying to get at is that situations seem shit at the time but it's only shit because convention says 'do it this way'. Fuck convention. Do your own thing and what makes you happy.

 The only asshole move is to fuck with other people's happiness and I'm afraid that's what suicide does."

NoStupidQuestions,fc6a3fe,t3_ege9do,1577475762.0,"What is the meter reading history like on the account? If the meter hasn't been manually read for a long time and was estimated up until now then the account may simply be playing catch-up.   

If there's a good history of manual reads, are you sure these Nov and Dec ones aren't now just based on estimates? 

Thirdly, was there a tariff change? Often people don't realise their special rate deals have ended and get whacked for a much higher price at the next bill"
