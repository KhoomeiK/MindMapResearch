Texans,fe4ugxb,t1_fe4u19e,1578862885.0,I think so. Up by three TDâ€™s- that means the risk is more points vs an entire possession.
Texans,fe4uajw,t3_enrp8o,1578862821.0,I think that was a good call- up three touchdowns? A possession is just as valuable as points right now. Just want to keep moving the game beyond their reach.

oddlysatisfying,fdgzil1,t1_fdgvnf4,1578412076.0,"No, most people are aware of the friend zone. 

And it is a very real thing. 

The friendzone is a relationship status one is relegated to when feelings stronger than simple friendship have been rejected by the person they have developed those feelings for. 

This status is also known as â€œfriendâ€. 

Which is an amazing and wonderful thing to be! 

But sometimes it hurts too much to be a friend without  the feelings being returned. And that may cause the rejected party to have to leave in order to save themselves from pain. 

And that is unfortunate- but ok. 

What is not ok, is the harassment of the rejecter. Constant reminders of the unrequited love. Pressure to feel the same. Derision for feelings that arenâ€™t there. Or any kind of manipulation of the rejecter. 

If you do any of the above, you are no longer a â€œfriendâ€.

You are an â€œassholeâ€."
