I split it in three most of the time for a pleasant 60mg buzz each piece. But if I want to trip hard, balls to the walls, I'll eat the whole thing and get completely floored. Literally stuck to the couch for a couple hours feeling like I keep on sinking further and further into the couch and can't move, close my eyes and see colors and shapes flying everywhere, while endlessly floating.  

Home made edibles are hit or miss, it's hard to tell how strong they are. But when you can order them online and know the exact amount you take its way better and more convienient. Plus you get the most incredible munchies you'll ever experience, you will just want to keep eating if you can lol."
evilbuildings,ffedum4,t1_ffe9pcj,1579844365.0,"Can't say the same about edibles.  THC interacts with you're body differently when digested, and if you have a fairly large dose it's definitely a trip. Can feel like mushrooms. See patterns/colors. Think weird shit. Just keep telling yourself that you can't die from marijuana. :/"

This. And also to add to your comment I wanted to point out that even though Wikipedia is one of the webs most powerful reference sites, it isn't a credible resource because anyone is allowed to be a contributer to the website. And can make edits or ""vandalize"" any of the Wiki's. [Wikipedia Academic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Academic_use) has posted an article explaining why
it is a bad idea to use Wikipedia as such."
AskReddit,fdpwrfi,t3_emkkri,1578643741.0,"I usually stand up and use my hands to orchestrate everybody with a big smile on my face. I'll walk around and up to people and encourage them. I'll clear my throat abnoxiously loud at people not singing, and they will get centered out. And sometimes, the best thing ever is, I stop everyone and say-

 ""We have to do it again, this time I want to hear everybody, ok? Little bit louder this time. We'll start with dad. Alright, from the top."" Do that a couple times.

Like alright, here we go, I'll show you I'm crazy af and maybe you will think twice next year. And trust me they remember.

Edit: I forgot to add, it worked so well with my friends that it makes them so uncomfortable they don't sing anymore. They've actually stopped new people from singing who never experienced it before, even if I say ""alright, let's do it normal, I promise."" They still refuse.

And my extended family was like wtf is he on crack at first and I could tell it was awkward for them and still is, but they will still kinda sing/humm every year because, well my mom always initiates it. But now that I'm older and theyre older I don't really do it that much anymore, unless there's lots of people and I'm centered out or in public, friends will get it regardless if they sing."
