dandruff,fg6vwxs,t3_e6284w,1580578112.0,"I'm Indian so take my word for it. My mom mixes a little coconut oil with a couple pieces of camphor (I hope you can get both of those in your country easily) and applies it on my head at night, and the next morning, I just wash my hair with shampoo. I literally have zero dandruff problems for the next 3-4 days at least. If you keep nourishing your hair like this, the problems will drastically reduce."

halo,fecozwg,t3_eo6j4j,1578979559.0,Beautiful play! Halo 5 will always be my favourite Halo multiplayer game. Infinite is definitely removing some of the movement mechanics but I'll always come back to Halo 5 for that multiplayer action!
PublicFreakout,fdwvdo1,t1_fdupzr6,1578762702.0,"I cannot fathom the hurt that dude has gone through, being abused at the age of 7, and I'm strongly against even the thought of hurting a child, let alone doing it. But, the f word is just as demeaning as the n word, and that dude, in pursuit of exposing that disgusting pedo, used language which was unnecessary and derogatory. Using that kind of word to attack a pedo shouldn't be considered right. Would it be considered okay for a white man to refer a black man as the n word if that black man had wronged the white man in some way? I'd say not."
