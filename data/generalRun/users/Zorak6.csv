It's also not very long at all, like 10 short broadcasts.  Highlights include Ricky calling his mother, who is very charming in my opinion and some insane guy that has hit songs about other bands/singers, but all he basically does is sing their name..  ""Hootie and the Blowfish!  Hootie and the Blowfish!"".  It's worth a listen."

DeadlyPremonition,fdjft02,t3_e2thm7,1578468952.0,"I feel a good descriptive word for Deadly Premonition is deceptive.  It truly starts out as a bad game.  Nothing makes sense at all.  It's just a bunch of hilarious fragmented nonsense, what was the creator even thinking?

But then as the story starts to unfold the entire thing just starts coming together and you see how all that ridiculous stuff from the beginning actually did make sense in the larger narrative and suddenly you realize it was a great game all along.  But it really takes a while (even a second play through) to realize this.

So in a sense it really does seem to start out as ""so bad it's good"" and then before you know it, it's so good it's actually brilliant."

Also specifically Rome.  The Roman Empire pretty much invented/refined the current calendar that is used today, including the months, days and years.  And Rome is where Christianity began and took hold.
