intj,ffg5pvc,t3_etdew8,1579899022.0,"Don't ever join sales, Especially jobs that involve heavy & repetive cold-calling. My whole job consists of basically stealing fish out of the giant buckets of other companies doing the exact same; legal bullshit that literally *no one* on the goddamn planet would care to do. Every single 'win' in my office revolves around one of the other salespeople celebrating stealing fish from the other fisherman's giant buckets, and I feel absolutely no satisfaction in cold-calling for 8 hours a day trying to convince wealthy business owners that they can save a couple hundred bucks a year by switching to us. Every morning, I have to convince my brain that it's not worth it to perform ritual seppuku just to get out of work.

Is it bad that at this point, considering suicide would be coming from a place of logical reasoning rather than emotional? I don't want to kill myself, I just really, really, REALLY don't feel like wasting my life sitting in a cubicle when I have a billion and one ideas i'd KILL to execute, if I just had a little more money... The circumstances that pushed me to this point in my life made me realize i've *always* been scraping from the bottom of buckets my whole life to get by, and I can't realistically see that changing any time soon...

If there's a plus side, at least I've got an hour lunch, and half the time i'm numbing my brain with some good ol' reddits. Probably gonna get let go soon. I don't care. I welcome unemployment like the sweet release of death. However, since I actually won't die, I still have to pay rent, and I have no savings, it definitely is gonna sting."

transhumanism,feb6w11,t3_eob9im,1578955962.0,"I wrote a brief sample for a scifi story a while back regarding something like this. I wanted to expand on it down the line, but it goes something like:

Technological Tree People that can mentally manipulate greenery, such as vines, trees, and anything with chlorophyll. Our main hero, an orphan boy, eventually encounters some sort of dilapidated military base hidden inside a cavernous mountain in the countryside. Inside, he ends up discovering the remains of a vine-covered rusty mecha that communicates telepathically with our hero. Afterwards, he spends day after day cleaning, scavenging for parts, and fixing up to be operational again, all the while learning about the robot he just rescued. 

Main story: He is actually part of a race of secret group of genetically modified humans that were implanted with AIs in their bodies as children, and were able to telepathically connect with any and all compatible tech. Of course, these were considered illegal experiments, so as a result, the top nations in the world were gifted one of these children to raise however they deemed fit. However, one child managed to escape from his containment somewhere in the European countryside, and has been living on his own since he was 12 years old when he first encounters this mech."

Tell me, would you work for wages so cheap you could barely live off ramen noodles while your corporate bosses spend their company's money on lavish goods for themselves while they fuck chicks in bikinis on their private yachts?
