AskReddit,ffhe4w3,t3_etkqrx,1579931551.0,World peace and understanding.
Awwducational,ff6u2m0,t1_ff6jeum,1579634892.0,This probably only makes only vague sense in my head. Haha. Have a good day.
Awwducational,ff6fhvw,t1_ff60t28,1579626067.0,"Nope. Poop. I was just kidding, pretending like what you said was justifying the love of laying on a sun warmed beach of fish dookie."
Awwducational,ff5yquh,t1_ff5vkkt,1579614551.0,Just keep telling yourself that.
AskReddit,fentbmy,t3_eq1wzh,1579290504.0,Enough to retire in a modest house with decent internet and keep up with the latest video games.
AskReddit,fecuwgb,t3_eodtd1,1578985577.0,An anaesthetist got hooked and got caught. Everything. Gone.
gaming,fdrr3it,t3_emonwz,1578688387.0,No. I want to almost see her jibblies.
politics,fdj3pwd,t1_fdj0ccd,1578457628.0,Possibly but I’m hoping cooler heads (are there any left?) in the WH prevail.
politics,fdizlxk,t1_fdizccf,1578454718.0,Everything is going to be fine. Chances are we won’t retaliate further. We’re not as nearly dependent on them for oil as we once were. Recession? Maybe but I don’t think this will spark it. It sucks but it’s not as bad as you’re thinking.
politics,fdinzeo,t1_fdinp55,1578447157.0,"Easier said than done, but relax, we’re gonna get through this. Hopefully like someone said earlier, maybe they’re not really trying and this is more or less a show so both sides can say they won and let things simmer down. So far, no casualties reported."
politics,fdimca3,t1_fdilxqy,1578446106.0,I was trying to be good diet-wise but maybe one of those ice cream cookies will take the edge off...
politics,fdilzoc,t1_fdilpze,1578445880.0,I think we’re a ways from reinstating the draft. Yeah this sucks and is scary but full fledged war hasn’t been declared yet.
politics,fdilkmu,t1_fdilbf1,1578445615.0,Shit service...I think.
Klipsch,fd4vk7i,t3_ef6gq5,1578171504.0,"I believe that’s for controlling/distributing the levels on the surround speakers.

sonos,fcitj8u,t3_eh862e,1577669457.0,It does indeed work. Thank you!
xboxone,fc6guo2,t3_eg7a1i,1577480263.0,Am I too late? It’s 3:57 on Dec 27.
Zwift,fc5wzfz,t3_eg13jj,1577467655.0,"If you have a more recent Apple TV, that could be an option."
AskReddit,fc2ikuj,t3_efqzp6,1577362147.0,My asshole FIL getting up and leaving and not saying bye or Merry Christmas to anyone because he didn’t like the game we were playing. It was at his sister’s house and the rest of the family are wonderful people. It’s always something with that man-child.
