I think the speed of light is very important to a lot of equations but to me it seems as if its simply the limit at which its possible to continue observing something.

Example: If I'm moving at .6C and you are moving at .6C the opposite direction, making us effectively traveling at 1.2C, we would basically see eachother frozen or blink out of existence because the light being reflect off of us would never reach the other person.

If I was floating in space and something past by me at light speed, I don't believe that I would see it over the course of 100 years or whatever. Same way my light doesn't stay on for 100 years after I turn it off. It would be gone from my vision in basically 1 ""frame"" and yes that frame would be essentially static from my point of view but that doesn't mean time itself is effected.

To my untrained mind, what makes most sense to me is that such a phenomenon exists solely in equations and people have made up these hypothetical experiments to explain a concept that works more on a level with photons and less so with real matter. I get the concept of how gravity can bend space and thus effects how long it takes light to reach an observer, but I can't get on board that time itself is effected. I'm not sure exactly how an atomic clock measures time exactly but I do know 1 second is defined as how long it takes for around 9 billion cycles of cesium radiation. If speed were to effect the rate of these cycles and thus effect the results of the measuring device, I would also not count that as ""changing time"". Its just an error in the measuring device."

Say you got caught up in some drugs or drinking at a party and you need to get home. Are you going to call your mom to come pick you up who beats you for stepping out of line, or are you going to hide it from her and risk DUI or killing someone to make it home in time to avoid a beating."
instant_regret,fedkfs8,t1_fedjqiz,1579013752.0,"Thats the point, your area was like that because everyone thought beating your kid was the right thing to do. So now you have a whole neighborhood of little shits fighting eachother. In civilized places none of thats an issue."
instant_regret,fedj1gl,t1_fediw9j,1579012777.0,I never got in a fight in the first place because I wasn't taught that violence solves my problems.
instant_regret,fedfnef,t1_fed9v5m,1579010229.0,Maybe if you weren't beat you'd never have been a problem child in the first place. You were acting out due to abuse at home.

The UI is actually pretty nice but I would change requiring to walk up and interacting with the chest. I think itd work if it faded in as you walked up to the desk, because the point is you're making a purchase from the shopkeep, not stealing shit from their chest."

That said I was very uncomfortable the whole time, not in a bad way but not in a good way either. It was very nerve wracking having 6 people yelling over eachother at any one moment for 2 hours straight. That said I heavily enjoyed it, I'm rarely the type that really ""feels"" anything during a film and this one definitely incited something. Some people may not have enjoyed the particular emotion that it invoked, but I think it accomplished what it set out to do."
business,fe6bk22,t1_fe6asy9,1578886249.0,"Low latency is one of several key elements to making satellite internet viable for modern requirements. Online gaming, video and data streaming, and high speed trading for a few examples.

The target market, initially anyway, is rural communities where ISPs refuse to expand decent service to because its not viable for them to do so. This service will be able to take the billions of people with limited or zero connection to essentially the same playing field as the rest of the modern world. If they succeed its a serious game changer. The date it happens by is irrelevant IMO, as long as they're working towards the right goals, it happening eventually is amazing."
business,fe62xxk,t1_fe62ebl,1578880593.0,"Thats an interesting point because based on the planes alignment at the time, even with the full satellite to satellite laser connections, you may jump between 1 or several satellites depending on what the fastest path is in that moment. For the most part though I think individual hops that occur in space will add minimal latency, the majority will come from entering the atmosphere again.

EDIT: i didn't watch the guys video in the article but he did claim even doing the hops to ground stations and back is better still than a theoretical straight fiber connection across whatever distance he was theorizing on."
business,fe61xht,t1_fe61a3s,1578879950.0,"For sure, I'm guessing SpaceX wont go that route because one person turning off their unit at the wrong time would lose someone else's request. Though they could fix that by sending the message to multiple ground units to relay to the next satellite and just have it ignore duplicates responses at the next hop."
rickandmorty,fe60mvv,t1_fe5d83p,1578879133.0,You're missing out if you're into gaming at all. First game is only $10. Keep in mind its older so graphics aren't on the same level as games today but it holds up. Portal 2 is just as good as well.

Instead of:

Until their satellites have those laser connections, and they could do it without significant down side in speed. Its just an article about one guys opinion youtube video based on some math he did."

I'm not saying the guy wasn't also successful in his own right or that he isn't capable based on his qualifications. I'm saying that given the opportunity to do so, you could plop down any well functioning human into the same role and they'd likely manage just fine without fucking it up to bad."
business,fe5xmt4,t1_fe5xcj6,1578877221.0,Yes. My point is he's not simply 1 of 50 gods among men capable of such a feat like people treat them. He's just the only one they even considered to attempt it. You can't claim that others couldn't do it because theres no data of them ever getting a chance.

This is the relevant point from the article but i agree its useless:

> But Mark Handley, a computer science professor at University College London, posted a YouTube video on December 20 that models the Starlink network and makes some educated guesses. Handley said he used recent documents from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and statements from both Musk and Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX's president and COO, to arrive at his conclusions.

> If Handley's latest guesswork is correct, each of Musk's ""UFO on a stick"" terminals that users pay to handle their own data could be a secret weapon that helps Starlink get data for countless other subscribers to and from its destination — and do so at speeds that handily beat fiber-optic cables. (SpaceX did not respond to Business Insider's queries on the matter.)

They're basically suggesting (based on this one dudes video) that SpaceX may use user's ground terminals as kinda a mesh network of hops for not just the receiving user's data but for other peoples requests. Interesting thought but I don't see why it would be necessary."
