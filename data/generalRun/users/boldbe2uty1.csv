suboxone,ffj3uxd,t1_ffizv5t,1579989710.0,"Oh okay, that makes sense. If I look back, my insurance was being charged 88 a week for name brand tablets for 21 tablets 2mg each."
suboxone,ffj2j7u,t1_ffixx6b,1579988767.0,Are strips generally more expensive than tablets?
suboxone,ffj2ecy,t1_ffiymgz,1579988671.0,"So $150 a month for 84 pills (2mg each) seems okay. I don’t know why I’m worried, it’s not like I’m paying for it. But I think if I was paying cash, the pharmacy would take the loss because they get money from the government for having a special dispensary."
