Your parents are people you should always listen to but not always obey. In the end, it is your life not theirs. Hear their concerns but make your own decisions. Your decisions are not theirs to make when it comes to your job title. Your happiness is your own making.

LSD,ff6i77s,t3_ervoa7,1579627741.0,I had 2 100 tabs and I smoked about 1 gram max of cannabis once in beginning and my trip lasted 14 hrs
LSD,ff6hya2,t3_errx6e,1579627587.0,Yes!!!! When I was drawing sometimes it felt like I was possessed and anything I drew was directly influenced from the sounds/music I was hearing. I couldnt draw unless it flowed with the music.

gifs,feum3k3,t1_feugu02,1579387846.0,I went into the trip seeking creativity. I think it helped. I havnt drawn something decent in ages. Also setting up your trip space to encourage you to interact with items you place out helps. :)

LSD,feqxrfi,t1_feq8cj7,1579347309.0,"So I ended up doing 200 bc I had 2 100 tabs on me I was gunna get a 3rd tab from a friend who was bringing more and was gunna trip with me but he ended up not feeling well that day and wasnt about to trip with bad vibes. So I went on my first lone trip on 200 and it lasted 13:58:00.44 hours ( technically more but I stopped the timer when I went to bed the next night and was very mildly tripping then anyway). The trip ended up being too mild for me or my mind wasnt letting itself release so I smoked a big bowl and that was enough to send me through into another dimension (I want to try to do more tabs next time to see if it helps not having to toke to kick start it). I had..... An amazing crazy trip. Hit what I perceived as ego death, I was no longer me and I had no control and I gave into it. It didn't last the whole trip but like I said in the previous comment, I was prepared for it. A lot of things happened that would sound terrifying to a sober person but I LOVED every fucking second. Not once did I want it to stop. I also was very happy with how long it lasted. I also drew things! Which is huuuge for me. I have been trying to get back into drawing and get that creativity back for a loong time now. At one point I was standing in my art room and all my old paintings literally spoke to me but it was like they were all shouting for attention bc they had important things to say but I had to give each one its own attention to hear them more clearly. One painting was absolutely sinister...but at the same time was the one that helped me the most. The trip taught me so many things.... And I swear there were entities helping with that too and sometimes it wasnt even me drawing but like I was possessed. It was terrifyingly beautiful. And... The drawing holds up to sober eyes pretty well I think. Im proud of it even if it isnt the most amazing thing in the world bc I actually drew something at all! I was thinking of posting all my drawings I made during the trip. Some were started when I wasnt peaking but the one I actually put most of my hours into looks almost finished and I like it. I feel like its almost a self portrait of me but of things I love. Another thing to mention is how cool it is to look at human skin under long exposure black light.... Shits like Avatar I had glowing white/blue patches (theres a name for these I cant find just by searching atm they exist in reality not just on a trip) that were laced with fractalized henna tattoos due to the LSD and at one point it looked and felt like I was a machine. So many other crazy stuff... Objects became alive etc. I have had a lot of this all happen on mushrooms too but its like mushrooms were a more primal feeling LSD was an intelligent aware version of these events... Is what I can describe it as.

Also LSD+Cannabis(Chocalope if you wanna know strain)+Shpongle music fucking helps you trip into madness. Love that shit. I didnt always listen to the music but it really makes the trip take control XD especially bc I was using wire less earbuds freshly charged. This was the recipe my friend told me to do when the trip wasnt hitting as hard as I wanted (he was playing trip guide from home over txt). Thanks to him, I had an experience of a lifetime."
offmychest,femkmfh,t1_femk6b3,1579260294.0,"Exactly. Accusations aren't always true, but once they are made, a lot of the time they can ruin a persons life and how people look at them even if the court doesn't find them guilty. I would try my best to be neutral until a verdict has been made."

LSD,fel10iu,t1_fek12lm,1579211739.0,"Im trying 300 for my first time on LSD tomorrow but only bc I've taken 7g of mushies before and literally saw a dudes chest open into lava and his heart was pumping lava on the floor and my moms legs turned into a mermaids tail, the ceiling was nothing but faces stretching in and out towards me in insane 3D as well as a big scary snake under the rug etc etc and other heavy heavy visuals and I loved it. I also have done mushies too many times too count and I also have LOVED looking at scary shit like demons and gore etc. I have never had a bad trip before inside or outside day or night (Not saying it isnt possible but maybe harder for me...) I am looking for an insane trip. Is the 300 a good dose of LSD?

Edit: I have also experienced moderate ego death and I am willing to fully commit if it happens"
LSD,fel04nm,t1_fekycne,1579211214.0,Usually with mushrooms you have to double the dose to the previous one if doing it close together maybe its same for lsd?
