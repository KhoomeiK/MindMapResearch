CruciblePlaybook,ffsu6b4,t3_euxtoi,1580192616.0,"I like to start off with my most comfortable/armor-modded loadout and get used to the feel of the enemy. Take note of LoW rushers, revoker laning, etc and try to play around it, sometimes adjusting my loadout if needed.

This means that for the first round I might be very shit. Slide into a side lane that just happens to have the entire enemy team, or can't quite outgun a random pulse rifle I didnt know about before.

I'm also a girl and sometimes callouts over voice are just needed when the pacing is very aggressive and text is too slow.

I pretty regularly get messages telling me to kill myself, uninstall, etc. Besides reporting my main satisfaction comes from the fact that I usually end up outperforming them by the end of the game.

That said it still hurts. I try to be supportive when I see it happen but other times it just makes me wish I could end the game quicker."
CruciblePlaybook,ffstukt,t1_ffsodt5,1580192261.0,"It is actually good though. If you're accurate with it the burst can be very devastating, and actually a good way to keep up a few levels down in IB due to the overkill it normally packs."
destiny2,ffs0pv9,t3_eux63m,1580170313.0,"That is already amazingly fast. Keep in mind that this is a 100-rank season pass for a 90-day season, and XP bonuses accelerate it towards the end.

32 ranks in a week is more than enough to be happy with."
destiny2,ffrze5m,t1_ffqeig1,1580169403.0,"For this reason I find CC/debuff effects very effective in IB. Hunter top tree tether/smoke is f antastic for example, messes with vision, mobility, and damage vulnerability without really having an important damage component. Even if they're 20 levels above you that just means you need to give an extra love tap to the head or two to the extremely slow and partially blinded target."
destiny2,ffrxrcm,t1_ffrfz7n,1580168300.0,"I use the rolling dodge as a hunter. I have literally never been hit by precision damage from any gun, but I seem to take literally every knife to the head when it's thrown at me in dodge."

Just poking a dude with a hand cannon at 5 minutes, get solo blade barraged.

Like, perfectly fine. Thanks for wasting your super on:

* not a real objective
* not a multikill
* not a shutdown

Even in comp where kills are the objective I'll consider that as a perfectly reasonable trade. More supers for us, less for them."
CruciblePlaybook,ffqah2m,t1_ffq1ioy,1580128203.0,Snapshot/Swashbuckler isn't that good. Better than Snapshot/HFG but really not that much.
CruciblePlaybook,ffqa075,t3_eubr7k,1580127678.0,"If you like the EP flinch, I can wholeheartedly recommend Trust. 180 RPM means it has to hit a lot for a kill, but extremely usable and a flinch monster. 150 and 140 RPM flinch might be enough to duel down other HCs but I find that the Trust can accomplish not only that but can flinch out even auto rifles and fusion/LFRs very reliably. Because of EP the normal 180 weakness--damage projection--isn't an issue.

The main weakness is the longer TTK allows for disengagement, but most players are not used to playing against EP yet--they dont retreat far enough behind cover so if you continue shooting at the corner you can usually continuously damage them and break their regen to push them.

On the flip side I actually think 110s like Crimil's Dagger are strong. EP might not be needed because they have strong built-in flinch. However they can extremely reliably and forgivingly three-tap, and the damage they do is so chunky that the opponent will never see their health in the red. This is a huge advantage psychologically because a lot of players try to disengage at critical health, but if they never see it they stand around like sitting ducks. Also the damage is extremely high so if you have any damage perk or they have some chip damage then you can twotap to the head. Fighting Lion + 110 HC is also a disgusting combo that I think is extremely underutilized--144 damage from FL means quick swap 110 onetap. 110s also win at range and many players havent really gotten the HC nerf in their head, and will try to challenge in falloff."

fittings,ffdcpof,t1_ffd3q37,1579818100.0,"Jackdaw works too. Or Caracal even, if you want to go the cheaper route.

C1s are easy enough they're not too much a problem."
computerscience,ffcyf0c,t1_ffbr1bg,1579809845.0,"They are standards specified by certain organizations.

As for the code editing question, it depends on what you change. As long as the new code can handle the specification then you will be okay. If it doesnt--for example, you add 1 to port numbers--then you'll have problems yes.

It's much easier to understand if you consider the physical layer. For example, look at a cat5e/ethernet cable--it has sub-wires that go to specific places in each end. If you mess with it but all signals go to the same places, you'll probably be okay. If you start jumbling up the wires you're gonna have a problem."
fittings,ffcx0wo,t3_esp5bh,1579809038.0,"A confessor is a better option here. Can do C1 content easily and if fit correctly can kill tackle.

fittings,ffcv4w5,t1_ffcuxop,1579807897.0,"Please do not put mid-grade nirvanas in a ratting drake.

The cost is really not worth it. You are also anemic on DPS, so the payback is very slow and you may end up in a stalemate if your skills are not good enough. There is also a high likelihood of getting caught.

It is a much better option to take a T3C or a rattlesnake even. You get through sites quicker. I think a good Gila can handle it too, and that is going to be much cheaper than a Nirvana pod.

The whole point of the Drake is nominally effective, disposable ships. Expensive implant sets work directly against that concept.

You're not wrong that it *can* be done but it really shouldn't."
fittings,ffct6gd,t1_ffc1465,1579806751.0,"A drake can in fact do full passive regen in C2 and easier C3 sites. Caplessness of the tank helps you do C3 where neut pressure is real. The plan there is to facetank.

For a newer player C3 is not really doable due to skills, but C2 is definitely within reach.

At all V skills this gets you 736 ehp/s neut-immune tank with 213 dps projected out to 78.6 km. You can raise this DPS with a mobile depot and ballistic controls; as the wave lessens then swap in BCS. However that's a lot of extra work and you can be caught off-guard.

Also if you get caught, you're probably going to die. An MJD can be added as a refit to try to escape, but the whole fit costs so little especially post-insurance it's usually better just to get podded and reship.

destiny2,ff9j15c,t1_ff9hmom,1579714052.0,"I've tried a lot of hand cannons and can tell you, they seem similar but actually vary wildly in dynamic. I would try at least one of each of the RPMs to see what firing works for you, and note what you don't like about them.

140s and 150s are popular but don't sleep on explosive 180s like the Trust. I personally like 110s though they are the ""weakest"" archetype. And try different perks outside the meta too--the importance of range is vastly overestimated since the last nerf.

Right now there is an extremely healthy pool of HCs, and once you find one that fits your cadence and playstyle it makes a world of difference.

What HCs are you currently using and what difficulties are you having?"
destiny2,ff9fag7,t1_ff997dq,1579711776.0,"PvP shakes, common in lots of games. You'll get used to it! If it helps, think of it as just one big PvE experience or experimenting with being more or less aggressive. Also you can try to use a more PvP-centric loadout in PvE so you can get more comfortable with it.

Personally I switch out weapons as needed in PvE but I almost always stick with the same armor set (so I have cadence for cooldowns) and if possible keep using my main weapon.

For me that means my Crimil's Dagger. I've gone from whiffing nearly every shot to landing over 90% of my shots with 60% of those being headshots.

If you dont have a main weapon or dont have a lot of light, hop into control and try experimenting. The dynamic is very similar to Iron Banner."

The LSE gives lots of opening tank to support 100mn, and this opens up midslots for MGCs to compensate for short HAM range.

If you dont have cap then drop the core def extender rig for a capacitor control circuit. You should have plenty though because you won't be running the small remote ancillary armor rep except to repair an aggrod drone every now and then while you pull it in/reset between sites."
fittings,ff5ygz1,t1_ff5wbrk,1579614324.0,"Speed does not make up for it. Even speed tanked ships need some initial raw tank for their acceleration up to speed, especially overprop ABs which can take in the neighborhood of 30 seconds to do so even if you land at initial orbit distance. You may also continually take damage; for example in wormholes sleepers will be hitting you with missiles.

It's true that RLML isnt ideal, though the reasoning here is a bit off. If you dont hit with HAMs then your DPS will obviously be much lower, so a DPS comparison isnt going to be valid. The main concern with RLML is not being able to power through a tanky and high repping target before a reload, and the damage being negated by reps. However that shouldnt be a concern at the level of PvE this Loki can handle no matter how well fit.

The bellicose is viable for some activities. So are the cyclone and phoon. It depends much more on how they are fit for what they can do.

Exploration is an entirely different thing from this. To me it sounds like you're trying to make a one size fits all Loki for krabbing. This is not exploring."
