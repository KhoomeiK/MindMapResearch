podcast,fdppg4f,t1_fdpgfc0,1578635604.0,"Hadnt considered WHY it would make sense to advertise to the audience we had already started to build on FB. Thanks for the advice, for sure going to look into podbean advertising since I use them to host my podcast anyway. Do you think it is \*more\* worth it to pay to promote the page itself for page likes on facebook and then advertise to the audience that I built?"
podcast,fdoo30l,t1_fdo2pbr,1578609109.0,"Have you ever bought ads on Spotify? Ive done a few on Facebook and havent noticed any \*real\* listener growth from it, honestly kind of thought their ""link click"" ratio seemed off. Like on the episodes we promoted we have 200 something views but none even liked, subscribed, or ever returned. Probably have thrown about $180 at facebook promotion alone and have gotten nooooo traction. Do you have any advice on converting clicks into real listeners?"
podcast,fdm4y2a,t1_fdkn4xm,1578539900.0,"I really enjoy the usage of the ""digital assets"" like the Zim voice (really interesting how you got it to say your name, Super dope) as well as the way you guys play off each other. You can tell there is a lot of chemistry in the way your voices flow together. If i were to give any advice it would to be to lean more heavily into your banter making sure to play off the relationships you obviously already have. Just give those comedic muscles a nice flex.  Oh Goku's k/d though? Hes not even a top tier fictional character if your looking at his K/D hes died how many times?"
podcast,fdm3nbo,t1_fdlx9di,1578539023.0,Appreciate the advice! When we re-run the cosign game as the host ill try a little harder to pull out their arguments and give them more room to flesh them out as well!

The podbean link is the only link directly to the episode. The rest are to the overall channel sorry for that issue. The real question I have here is are my games interesting? Ive put a bit of work into attempting to be different and create my own verbal games but do they come off as corny or not engaging? If you did enjoy the format of playing verbal games would you like to see more in the style of this one where it is based in pop culture? Or maybe something leaning more toward the supernatural or occult?"
