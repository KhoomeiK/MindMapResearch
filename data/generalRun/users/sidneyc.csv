DoesAnybodyElse,ffmwazq,t3_eu4uj9,1580059618.0,Yes. It's much better.
askscience,ffmupfb,t1_ffmsjpw,1580059150.0,I would worry more about your own butt.
todayilearned,fff0ukz,t1_fff0jkj,1579872568.0,"Thanks to them too, yes. But they didn't liberate the Netherlands. We were fortunate enough to be freed by the Americans and Canadians, mostly.

But I get it, anything to not have to acknowledge the USA did anything commendable in the past, right?"
todayilearned,ffeyt4u,t1_ffevfkp,1579870725.0,"> Nothing about what the US has done abroad is honorable

I know that self-hate is all the rage among progressives, but this is too much.

I am sitting in The Netherlands right now, which is only a free country and not a province of the Third Reich thanks to the sacrifice, first and foremost, of the USA and its soldiers back in WW2.

I stood on the beaches in Normandy where so many young men lost their lives. Surely their sacrifice is a lot more honorable than some snotty wanker doing his little masturbatory ""we're such a bad country"" routine on reddit, no?"

askscience,fer2gq1,t3_eq5fnd,1579348867.0,"Apart from the thinning at high altitudes that could be extrapolated, once Newton's laws and his law of gravity were known it must have become immediately clear that the planets and smaller objects in the solar system could not be moving in a medium that induced any significant amount of drag; the orbits are just too stable for that."
askscience,fer0pb9,t1_feqri7w,1579348263.0,Ok so you don't understand what activation energy is. Got it.
askscience,fepdwgl,t1_fep94ec,1579318107.0,"> burns a pit in the substrate for a zero or leaves it alone (so it reflects when reading) for a one.

That is oversimplified to the point that it's incorrect. The information is stored in lands and pits, yes, but it is way too simplistic to say that they correspond directly to zeroes and ones.

In actual fact, at the lowest level, the information is stored in the lengths of the consecutive lands and pits, or, to be more precise, in the *distance between the land/pit and pit/land transitions*. A fun fact that follows from this is that if you would make an 'inverted' copy of a CD, i.e. a copy where you exchange all lands and pits, it would contain precisely the same information.

On top of this there is a framing structure, and two layers of error correction to detect and correct readout errors. For CD-ROMs there is a third layer of error correction on top of that.

DVD and blue-ray disk use an encoding scheme that is more dense, both physically (smaller lands/pits) and logically (more efficient encoding). But they too store the information in the land/pit and pit/land transition distances."

todayilearned,fclgxqq,t1_fcl1nvd,1577747536.0,"Yes. There's quite a few words that take on a different (dare I say more precise) meaning in a scientific context. Some other examples:

- significant
- theory
- energy
- force
- power"
todayilearned,fclgmtd,t1_fckyve2,1577747331.0,"> In science precision is pretty much synonymous with uncertainty.

They are not synonyms. A high precision corresponds to a low uncertainty, and vice versa."
