actuallesbians,ffjuqat,t1_ffjspdy,1580007484.0,My dear don't sell yourself short. You are valid and those in line with your gender and sexuality are simply not represented in the mainstream so it's difficult to understand that they really do exist. Your One is out there and if you put yourself out there too you will find them. Ying and yang bitches.

FixMyPrint,ffg5jrz,t1_ffg14s9,1579898918.0,"On further inspection it looks like a geometric shapes, like it's only hanging on at specific points. Is that right? I would think that might be that the extrusion is somehow too thin (underextrusion) or the Z went too high for a bit."
FixMyPrint,fffzlrk,t1_fffrniu,1579895260.0,"That absolute layer or later on the boat? This is a geometry change where the roof has just been finished now the printer is concentrating solely on the cylinder. So I'd guess its some kid of hiccup, maybe a Z speed issue or an issue with belt tension. What boggles me is why it's just the one layer. If it was a retraction or underextrusion issue I would think it would be evident on all the other layers.

Might also be a calculation error in the slicer. Perhaps that layer after the roof doesn't compute. Try changing the size of the print or slow down the print speed to see if it makes a difference."
