CalgaryFlames,fev7rum,t1_fev30zw,1579394199.0,"Yes I do, but that doesn't excuse that goal. It was a bad goal. Rittich does that sometimes, it ok to admit that.

Everyone is criticizing the players for not having any scoring chances even though they had a stupid amount of shots. If a couple shots went top corner instead of into the body, there would've been more scoring chances. Do you know how hard it is to get the puck, snap the puck off before a defender challenges you, shoot it high glove without giving away wherrr you're going to shoot it?

When you let in 4 goals on 20 shots, you need to be better. When you score 2 goals on 42 shots, and none until the late 3rd, you need to be better.

hockey,fel3jok,t1_fel126v,1579213291.0,"Again, resorting to insults because we disagree. We see the hit differently, no need to degenerate to putting the other person down. I don't understand the points you're trying to make, you don't understand the points I'm trying to make. I guess that makes us both stupid. 

CTE is a major issue, largely in enforcers. These guys traditionally haven't played lots, and aren't on the wrong end of bad hits. They do fight however, which is the major contributing factor.

Apparebtly all of professional hockey equals a few ex players? Ok, good to know. I'll side with DoPS, whose literal job it is is looking at dangerous plays).

The matter should be over. Tkachuk but Kassian, Kassian smashed Tkachuk. Revenge completed, eye for eye or whatever. Thats how most adults think. Kassian has always had trouble keeping his cool, he should probably get help for that.

DoPS thought the hit was clean because it wasn't a hit to the head. He caught him in a bad position, but it was hip to shoulder. If you think that's more dangerous than blows to the back of the head, then you're obviously wearing homer glasses. If that hot was a hit to the head because Kassian head whipped forward into Tkachuks body, then every open ice body check should be banned as well.

The Torres his was far worse as he targeted the head. So find another clip."

hockey,fektsec,t1_fejws83,1579207445.0,"What we are having is a discussion. I think differently than you, I have a different opinion than you. That isn't a reason to invalidate my argument. And if you deal with workplace safety, or really forecasting any event, you ALWAYS have to think about what could happen.

First, his problem is that he feels disrespected, his pride was hurt. He has to fix that himself, revenge in Tkachuk won't help. 

Second, Kassian lost control. Even in the UFC you're not allowed to punch the back of someone's head. I didn't mean that Kassian would grab his head and bash it on the ice, but Tkachuk was almost flying in the air, its not that far fetched that his head could've hit the ice in that motion, or that Kassian could've lost his grip. Sure player careers have ended with hits like that. Same in fights. How many enforcers have committed suicide in the past 15 years because of CTE, which was primarily from fighting. There are people that didn't think anything was wrong with thr hit, including DOPS. What similar hit has resulted in a suspension? I hi estly can't remember (since the head was not the primary point of contact).

Thirdly, I was clearly talking about future games and Kassian comments that he is still looking for revenge, and that we're discussing the NHL not wanting further action.

Fourth, Tkachuk embarrassed Kassian, hurting his pride, pride is a feeling. Remember when Matheson slammed Elias Petersson last year after Petersson deked his pants off? Same type of thing. All I hear is Kassian say how he loves that kind of hockey, but clearly not when it happens to him.

Fifth, Raffi Torres' hits were much worse, not just driving up into the hit, but actually leaping (not the 'leap' that Tkachuk did), getting his elbow or shoulder into the head. Way different hits. There were plenty of people wishing severe harm to Tkachuk on reddit (not just Oilers fans). And the way Kassian was swinging, if he had solid connection, this easily could've been another Bertuzzi incident.

The fact the the league is still suspending players for dirty hits means they're still around. And why you are confused that hit was allowed, well DoPS said it was clean. As much shit as DoPS gets, I'll still go with their opinion over some jacked up Oilers fan on reddit."
hockey,fejoobk,t1_fej3kn4,1579181807.0,"That would be Kassian problem. The only reason he lost it was because his pride was hurt. If he's still upset after getting open shots to to back of Tkachuk head while throwing him around like a child, then it's because of his own actions (put his team down, lost the game, got suspended). One thing I'm sure the NHL wants if for players to keep their emotions in check. Kassian could've done that and targeted Tkachuk later in the game like Tkachuk did.

DoPS concluded the hits were legal, which many borderline hits have been called. Kassian was suspended for a far more dangerous play (which if Tkachuk actually fought probably would have been far less dangerous) where he could very easily have started slamming Tkachuks head on the ice) and he's still upset. Why can't he let it go? Admit he lost control and get over it like the rest of the world. Can you get away with something like that in your workplace? With your mom when you were a child? No! You would be fired, face legal action, get grounded by mom! Get over it, I'm tired of hearing about how Kassians feeling are still hurt so he's got to get more redemption.

I'm sure the NHL will talk to the teams and say not to do anything, and the players will listen. The NHL doesn't want another Bertuzzi incident, and neither do the players. It almost ruined bertuzzis career, and he was actually good. Kassian will be out of the NHL. Is that worth it to get his revenge?"

britishcolumbia,feij7dx,t1_fehcwt2,1579139775.0,"I wouldn't blame it all on the mills. The people they send out to layout roads are usually young people who have never been in a truck, and never see a road they layed out after its been built. It can also be difficult to see if there's any more favourable terrain because of trees. When the road is built, the logging contractor can redesign the road to some extent to make it safer if they feel it isn't. The truckers themselves can refuse to drive on said roads. There are numerous factors that go into logging truck accidents, and safety is shared by everyone throughout the process."
hockey,feii0sf,t1_feif6og,1579138993.0,"Well, not really. Kassian got to beat down Tkachuk, so that should've been his revenge, the issue in theory should be over. Eye for an eye if you will. He then made comments after his suspension saying he wants more."

Is this a dirty hit? Subban traveled distance to hit Marchand and his feet left the ice. I guarantee you, that even though the principle point of contact is the head, Marchand head hit Subban back (forward momentum, exactly like the hit on Kassian).

Tkachuk hit Kassian in the shoulder (how his hip could hit his neck is beyond me. My hand won't even fit between my shoulder and head), and forward momentum brought his head around and hit Tkachuk in the hip. If that is a hit to the head then every body check is a hit to the head."

I found it unnecessary to include the opinion in dissenting hereditary chiefs get handouts. I live in Northern BC, and have friends on reserves, one of whom quit drinking and doing drugs. Because he was different, he was called a sellout, and cast out fro his friends. He later turned back to alcohol, and eventually killed himself. Another friend has never touched alcohol, has always been employed, often in the resource sector (forestry and oil and gas), and provides for his family. He has also been called a sellout. That kind of attitude is extremely toxic and harmful, and only serves to drive apart the community, especially when the Unist'ot'en camp is very likely receiving handouts from environmental organizations.

I do work in the resource industries (I don't have an issue with the pipeline, aside from the route going through the Morice/Clore valleys-was there no better route?), and I know how much preliminary work goes into finding archaeology sites, including working with local First Nations and elders to find sites. It would be a shame if any sites were missed. 

94% of BC is ""crown"" land, and in Northern BC, that number is even higher. Most of the land up there has not been deforested, but has been heavily logged, including around the Unist'ot'en camp.

But it's hard to find unbiased sources abkut this now, as you have anti and pro pipeline people who argue for their side, and CGL is pretty reserved in releasing information it seems.

The climax species for both ecosystems are cedar and hemlock (among others, but I'll limit it to those two species). There is more than 600 acres if those 2 species. Even by PG, there is a park called the Ancient Forest. The park is a almost 12000 hectares (almost 30 000 acres), and while some of has been logged, we'll over 600 acres remains.

Some other large ecosystems are the BWBS boreal white and black spruce), ESSF (engelmann spruce sub alpine fir) and SBS (sub boreal spruce). The climax species of the ecosystems are mainly spruce and fir. There is plenty of spruce and fir around, even in the SBS, which has been heavily logged and rarely reaches climax due to natural disturbances.

I'm not trying to be a dick, and I hope you don't take it that way, but you're spreading some serious misinformation. 600 acres is tiny (1.2x1.2km), and there are some really remote, old forests in BC that are able to reach climax.

britishcolumbia,fdc37ed,t1_fdbnv9n,1578266193.0,"My complaint about the climate change argument is that people use it as an excuse to not do anything. I never said anything about climate change not being real, or insignificant. But there is a root cause to the pine beetle epidemic that climate change exacerbated. To blame pine beetle or declining salmon stocks on climate change is lazy. There are other actions to take to mediate the problem, but they cost money, and then the bc government has to actually do something. But blaming it solely on climate change saves money.

You have not seen anything about fire suppression being the culprit, but in the next sentence mention that the ministry's failure to burn or harvest was partially responsible. Those are closely related. How do you think vast areas of the interior had such old large trees, in an area which burns every 50-80 years on average? Fire suppression. And why don't they do controlled burns? They can escape.

Hot summers can spawn a blight, but the bugs still need food. Do you rhibk this is the first time in human history that pine beetle has ravaged bc? If it has happened before, which I think is extremely luck, then we can't blame it on climate change then, only that certain environmental conditions allowed it to happen."
britishcolumbia,fdb9er7,t1_fdavogq,1578255105.0,"It's not necessarily cold winters that kill pine beetle (they create an antifreeze in the bodies to survive winter). A temperature of -37 in-bark temperature can kill up to 50% of beetle in winter, but that can be affected by bark thickness and the insulating affects of snow. So if the temperature drops to -45 for 3 weeks, but 90% of the larvae are under the snowpack where the temperature is much warmer, then nothing significant will happen. Cold snaps in the fall/early winter and spring can be much more successful, but those events have never been consistent.

You have to ask yourself ""how did the pine beetle achieve such large numbers to affect almost the entire province?"" pine beetle prefer large, old pine that can't fight off attack as easily as younger pine, with decently thick cambium (food). The pine beetle epidemic really took hold in tweedsmuir provincial park, where there was no logging, and because of years of fire suppression there was an abundance of large, old pine. That's all it was, a sea of food for the beetle. Coupled with early springs/late falls, multiple generation of beetle were able to survive in one year, increasing the population significantly. The beetle spread over BC, attacking young pine and even spruce. Due to the size of BC, you could have one area with climate conditions to kill the beetle, but other areas didn't, allowing the beetle to survive and spread.

I hate the argument that climate change is responsible for problems like beetle and Salmon, it implies that there is nothing we could've done. Climate change can increase the damage done, but so far is not the sole culprit for these problems (in my opinion). There is usually a human caused action (fire suppression creating a huge swath of large, weak trees in a remote part of the province or over harvesting/fish farms etc) that creates the problems, which is then exacerbated by climate change."
