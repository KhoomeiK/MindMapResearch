Metal,ffggind,t1_fffwway,1579905716.0,"I get the majority of your point. I still think saying that bands like BI are ""absurdly popular"" is way over the top, in any kind of context or reality.

Not even within the death metal scene it's comparable their popularity with bands like  Morbid Angel, Nile, Hate Eternal, Entombed, Suffocation, Vader, Death, and so on. 

That tag should only belong to bands that are here since the 80/90's and sold millions of records (not thousands), like Motorhead, Slayer, Machine Head, Maiden, etc. It may not be a likeable fact, but the bands who sell most records and concert tickets, are the ones who should be considered ""most popular"".

As far as this sub goes, 99,9% of the world doesn't know that it exists, so I don't get the part where you keep bringing this up since it adds nothing to their popularity."
