bipolar,feagjll,t1_fe6k4t3,1578948493.0,Btw this exchange was refreshingly wholesome and contrary to most of my experience on this site when having a discussion with someone of a different point of view.  Thank you for being decent and tolerant of me.  Sometimes the loudest people in the child free movement can be pretty toxic.  (A lot of the advocates of having a kid can also be toxic.). So again… Thanks for not being one of those assholes.
drawing,feacky9,t1_fea8jnq,1578947023.0,"My kid said all my drawings look scary so I was trying to make a more positive image.  I gave the skelly a smile but somehow it still turned out creepy.  
I always paint it black."
bipolar,fea2f1i,t1_fe2zn2m,1578943691.0,"Thank you it makes me so happy to find people who connect with what I’m doing here.  And “Post punk Paleolithic”. Holy shit I love that.  I was trying to sort of make something that look somewhere between the Phoenix, an archaeopteryx  and a mosquito.

I looked up that Eclipse thing too and  you nailed it.  My imagery here definitely echoes it.  I’ll have to watch that show it looks interesting."
bipolar,fe6jfdz,t1_fe6hln8,1578892845.0,"Thank you, I hope the same for you."
bipolar,fe5o9vx,t1_fe3vzhr,1578872058.0,My wife’s been with me for 20 years.  I don’t know how she’s survived it all.
bipolar,fe3ro01,t1_fe3g0fn,1578852182.0,Thank you And I don’t mind at all
bipolar,fe0cywe,t1_fe0cudq,1578810272.0,Well thank you then.
bipolar,fe0crsd,t1_fe0bqs6,1578810061.0,"Hah!  That’s a lot of assumptions.  Are you gatekeeping suffering?  I’m sure I’ll be considering ending it all again in a month or two and end up involuntary hospitalized again for the 7th time but please mate, just let me ride this high it’s all I got right now."
bipolar,fe090pq,t1_fe06n6c,1578806421.0,Thank you man that’s encouraging.
bipolar,fe08xlv,t1_fdvcudw,1578806344.0,Don’t lean in to it if you’re ever tempted.  It always ends in tears.
drawing,fdwy3ld,t3_en8imb,1578763400.0,Don’t compare your daily drawings and work against the best pieces in your portfolio.  We can’t be our best all the time.
bipolar,fdt0auy,t3_en0nfm,1578710265.0,I’m bp1 and that out of control feeling is my favorite thing in the world.  It becomes destructive after a while but in the moment I don’t care about the future because I’m so in the moment.
drawing,fdod3b1,t1_fdmx4dz,1578602953.0,I like artists that can find flow and get lost in the moment when creating.  It shows a confidence and comfort in your rendering ability and personal aesthetic.  I like someone who’s able to draw but willing let go of all the ego involved in creating.  You let things happen organically.   It shows that you simply enjoy the feeling of putting pen to paper and just seeing what happens.  The work you created flows with organic energy.
drawing,fdlpovu,t3_elz2gv,1578529528.0,I like the way you think when you’re not thinking.
bipolar,fdkjmqe,t3_elvdy9,1578505065.0,Well you can’t make him feel better.  That’s not really in your power.
bipolar,fdcm8oq,t1_fbnynxm,1578278404.0,I’ve got a bunch growing in my yard and it’s the best smelling plant I’ve ever known but no I’ve never tasted it.
bipolar,fbld4lu,t1_fbklcuu,1576961327.0,It’s non-metaphorically the most bitter pill I’ve ever had to take.
