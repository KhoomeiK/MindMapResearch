bipolar,fffg9g9,t1_fffdk78,1579883304.0,"Hey it's all good. I came pretty close to offing myself about 6 months ago and the feeling persisted for a long a time. I can relate to where you are at. It sucks not being able to enjoy things, seriously. Wish I could help you in some way. The only thing that really stabilized me was not drinking caffeine anymore. I found myself carrying around so much resentment and resistance to everything around me it constantly wore me out. All my muscles were tense at all ours of the day even in my sleep. I have no idea what changed in my life aside from not drinking caffeine but I sleep now. I cold give a fuck less if I have a successful career, or feel like doing anything again. I am in this weird purgatory but it's a lot better than where I was. I moving to a new city and hopefully finding a new job.  Just having that to look forward to has changed a lot for me.
Also, I meditate every day. If you are up for it you should download an app called insight timer. It is guided meditations. I find it much more beneficial than sitting in a room by yourself contemplating how much you feel like shit. If you can get in a daily guided meditation routine I guarantee it will change thing for you."
bipolar,ffff4wy,t1_fffejxd,1579882608.0,"Ya no worries, I can really relate to the situation you are in. Not drinking caffeine has allowed me to get off my meds. That's how significantly it was affecting me. All you can do is notice the things you are doing and it can help you in the future just by being aware of them. No ones perfect so don't ever expect to be. Love yourself even if you are alone on your b day. You deserve it."
bipolar,fffe7lr,t3_etb69f,1579882019.0,"Hey i'm sorry you feel like poop, stop drinking caffeine. Might help your relationship anxiety, it did for me. I always had issues getting into relationships without goin into a manic state. You have to realize your expectations for your birthday is what's making you feel bad. You say you are tired of being alone yet you cancelled an occasion to spend time with someone. Please be aware of how the decisions you are making are perpetuating your situation. 

Seriously stop drinking caffeine."
bipolar,fffberq,t3_et2l4w,1579880248.0,"In Tibetan buddhism it is practice to contemplate death every day. They even meditate in graveyards with bodies exposed for vultures to eat them. This is supposed to remind you that every day could be your last, death is always around the corner. With this paradigm, it doesn't matter if you live or die because death isn't far away at any time. 

Personally for me I feel responsible to continue living. If I don't deal with the underlying shit that is causing my suicidal ideation and I give in I will just have to deal with it again at some point in the future, in another life or something. I find it powerful to take full responsibility for your situation do your utmost to come to terms with it. Stop resisting life around you. Peace comes when you trust the world around you and you are confident that things will work themselves out and that whatever is being presented to you right now that may be causing you pain or suffering can be learned from."

bipolar,fel8uyp,t3_epqf09,1579216585.0,"Hey you could go to school and do whatever you want. Treat your day at school like a mental health day off. Draw in class, hell skip class and go for a hike.  Maybe this can help you give less fucks in general at school so you don't need a day off.

Also, I thinki t is incredibly responsible of you to seek professional help at such a young age. Please continue to seek and do what helps you.

Good luck"

bipolar,fe93egd,t3_enqqjm,1578933769.0,"Hey you aren’t alone. I used to be highly creative... and manic a lot. I make electronic music and draw and make video games. I completely lost all desire to make anything. Here is the interesting stuff, apparently according to many eastern religions creative energy is sexual energy. I correlated that no longer do want to create but I had no sex drive either. I kinda had to give up on wanting anything to move forward. I don’t criticize myself for not creating or not wanting to. I met a beautiful girl the other day and found myself making music after spending some time with her, idk if I was inspired or what. 
What has helped me significantly is chakra meditations. The theory goes you may have a creative block, something blocking your flow of energy to your inner creativity. You can consciously unblock the energy and let it flow again in your body. I recommend going on the app insight timer and maybe doing some chakra meditations. 
I got the point where I was having issues reading and focusing throughout the day. I do software and was having serious issues working on projects. I made the decision that I would rather be less stable and be able to focus and experience emotions. I stopped my meds about 2 weeks ago. I know tough times are probably coming but I am prepared for whatever they are will accept them. Honestly, I am still not concerned with creativity as it is something that I do when I feel like it. I feel I am kinda in a creative incubator, chilling out for a year before going back to working from a deeper place.

Good luck."

bipolar,fdr5vkx,t3_emt0rd,1578679885.0,"lamictal made me a sex fiend when i started it. After a while i started getting lower and lower libido. I stopped lamictal and haven't seen much improvement. I wouldn't rely on supplements. Talk to your doc anout this, it is counter intuitive if taking an anti depressant is making you more depressed cuz you cant have sex. buproprion is an anti-depressant that can increase libido.... but also potentially make you manic."

bipolar,fdr4i9q,t3_emqak9,1578679342.0,"I am a software engineer and have a coherent understanding of AI. Don't download them again! you have de-conditioned your mind from social media. As soon as you start using it again it will psychologically condition you to want it and use it more. The only purpose of social media is to turn you into a more valuable product. To make you give more attention to it so they make more money showing you adds. Part of the way the AI does this is FOMO and preying upon your insecurities. 

All said, I am super happy for you. I am at about 5 months no social media and did not correlate me feeling so well to it until you posted this. I have become so much more secure and don't care about documenting my life for others to see or creating art so I can validate my self worth. Social media is addiction and it is crazy when you are no longer addicted to it. 

Keep it up."
bipolar,fdpk2pn,t1_fdp9js3,1578630781.0,"That's awesome, ya sleep is priority for me nowadays i make sure I give myself at least 8.5 hours every night. I still haven't gone completely caffeine free, I think i subconsciously think I am a better person when caffeinated so I always try to be when i am doing important things. I am starting a new job and want to get into it not drinking coffee so I can prove to myself I live my life without being dependent on it. But ya that routine is crucial as well, for me it was no more extreme dieting or workout routines. I have been making myself crazy for years doing strict diets without consistency as well as working out when I am tired and exhausted from working out. It's like i constantly perpetuate myself into burnout. I have been feeling a lot better lately not trying to better myself and just accept m yself for who I am. I don't need to do anything to be worthy of self love and acceptance."
bipolar,fdoz6qu,t3_em7npp,1578616227.0,"Recently stopped my meds, I had almost no withdrawal which surprised me compared to previous times. Right now, I prefer to have my extreme highs and lows and be able to think clearly, i need to for work. I was getting really depressed from anti-depressents and started getting tremors from mood stabilizers. I now sleep much better. Trying to keep my anxiety in check by avoiding caffeine a few days a week. Otherwise, meditation and therapy have been my main help. Mostly therapy, it is pretty amazing stuff."
bipolar,fdoxkqw,t1_fdn4kj1,1578615179.0,"this is well said, there is a huge psychological component when starting meds. It kinda goes along with thinking there is something inherently wrong with you and then living with that as a core belief.

I just stopped all meds and I have to say I am better off in general."
bipolar,fdenuhx,t1_fde4c7s,1578342943.0,Of course thanks for sharing
bipolar,fde41hp,t3_ekuvcm,1578330701.0,"You are aware you're treating your husband like shit which is good, try to bring more of that awareness into your life so you can stop yourself before you say or do hurtful things. Sounds like your husband is triggering you in some way which is not his fault. Also sounds like co-dependency issues. Why should your husband tolerate someone who treats him  badly? Love means you wouldn't want anyone to be unkind to him in any way, even yourself. 

You are only 31 don't believe you are not capable of change or being your true self. 

Please meditate every day, it will help you practice not reacting when you may be triggered.

Also, you are most definitely not a shitty person ..... you are amazing and wonderful. You are taking the time to ask for and get help to improve yourself right now which is super noble.

From the brief section I read it sounds like you might not have been accepted for being yourself at a young age. Know that regardless of what you do or how you act or the things you have done you are completely valid. There is nothing that can change that. 

Please humor the notion that you are not in fact this person you believe yourself to be right now. You are much much more and are not seeing it and perhaps haven't seen it for a long time. I believe you are capable of being your self without fear of judgment.

I would like to recommend an app called ""insight timer"". it is a great way to learn to meditate through guided practice and it is free.

Take care"

I was a total space cadet all day yesterday and today.
Thankfully my dad is super cool and he is already over it, more concerned about me than the car. 

I am moving forward and honestly am using this concussion as a reset button for my brain. Hitting my head is always a good opportunity to start things fresh and build from the ground up from a strong foundation with healthy habits and self love.

I take it first thing when I wake up, idk if it the combo of it with trileptal that is making it so hard to sleep. I honestly welcome the depressed sleep all day feeling right now. I already don't want to do anything I might as well rest.

bipolar,fcnk8ml,t3_ehyax8,1577813214.0,"/u/FrontenacRacer ,  /u/SortingMYDemons Everyone is all right, I already have a slipped disk in my neck so that isn't feeling too hot this morning and i got a concussion. It takes very little for me to get them since I have had so many. A decent knock on the head or whiplash and I am pretty concussed ( part of the reason for mental illness).  I was just driving an hour to pick up a table and my dad offered to use his car since it is slightly bigger. Holiday traffic was stop and go and I didn't realize everyone was coming to hard stop in front of me on the highway and I slammed into the back of this jeep. My dads car is low to the ground so it crumpled the top front and completely missed the bumper. 

What really sucks about this whole thing is this car was my dads baby. He puts all of his free time into working on it. It's an older 90's Saab, cheap but really special to him..... and i destroyed it. And the accident is on his insurance not mine, so i kinda double fucked him.

I was on day two of a caffeine tolerance break and recently started a new med. I have yet to experience this med without consuming caffeine and I think it attributed to my lack of awareness. Never wanted to straight up stop taking my meds so badly but I have learned that lesson many a time so I will continue taking them.

Shit sucks, I have been super depressed, just graduated college, currently looking for a career job. Motivation is at an all time low, now I have concussion for job interviews. 

Fuck I am just trying to see this as life checking me and putting me in my place. I need to get my shit together. I can hardly think, ending 2019 on a shit note.

bipolar,fcmag3t,t1_fci004e,1577768676.0,"I have been meditating just about every day for about 6 months for 10-40 mins. Prior to that I really only went to the occasional week long retreat and I never kept my practice outside the retreat. It’s great to do a retreat but so much more important to have a daily practice in my opinion. I would learn so much and lose it after a week or two of not practicing . Eventually you can bring your meditative state everywhere with you throughout daily life. That is the goal, to be more kind and patient and understanding to those around at every opportunity by being completely present. A hard lesson I learned is that I could not be spiritual 3 days out of the week and drink and get high, watch tv or play video games the other 4. It is so important to practice your deepest values every day. Also when you experience benefits, don’t think the game is over and you have achieved anything. There is a reason all Buddhist masters and practitioners meditate every day it is because it is something that must always be fostered and cared for. Once you meditate and learn to enjoy its benefits you should intend to keep a daily practice forever!
It should be something to do when you feel happy and or sad, frustrated or relaxed, always observing and not identifying with."
bipolar,fch22tw,t1_fcaygrc,1577646539.0,"Awesome, good for you going straight for 5 weeks. I honestly think this is a great way to make a lasting practice. Just be aware it will challenge you at a very deep level. It is usually after the first week that you settle in. That's when I found I stopped thinking about the outside world and only became concerned with what was immediately in front of me. It's pretty amazing. Please start a steady practice as soon as you can. Think of it like brushing your teeth it is something that should be done daily. Look into finding group meditations in your area and join in once or twice a week."
bipolar,fc62wo3,t3_efzwdg,1577471051.0,"Hi I have done several multi week meditation retreats and would recommend you give it a try for yourself. 
I humor the idea, my ego keeps me from fully dedicating life to meditation practice but I fantasize about living up in Buddhist community where I attend retreats.

In regards to bi polar the amazing thing about extended mediation is you watch yourself become depressed and manic and don’t make any effort to change it. You just accept and observe. There is nothing really wrong with you from this perspective and the benefits are paradigm shifting."
bipolar,fc62ewc,t3_eftjpp,1577470731.0,"Hey, first I am really sorry to hear you are going through this.
I was there for about 6 months.
I stopped taking meds.
I went completely sober thinking it would solve my problems, did yoga, ran, and did Tai chi almost every day. I meditate every day too. Nothing changed. 

I had to fully accept that I was in the place during meditation every day. After a while it became easier even though I felt the same way. 
Honestly all the self care and practice helped but what truly changed thing for me was accepting that I need to be on meds. So went down the path again of trying new meds and settled on a new regime. I find when I start feeling better I stop taking as good of care of myself. It is paradoxical really. When I am ultra depressed I go 1000% self care and it often does nothing. I take meds and feel better and suddenly I can drink coffee and beer and sleep in again. I am trying to stay on the path of sobriety and meditation and exercise while taking the new meds so I can maximize the benefit and hopefully make lasting change in my life. 

Best of luck. If there is one thing I can suggest that would almost absolutely help you it would be to download the app insight timer and start listening to some guided meditations. It is basically free and meditation is mental healths best friend."

But ya I agree I am all about full body exercises nowadays, yoga, Tai-chi, running, swimming. It is hard for me not to over emphasizes personal growth in my life sometimes to the point where it can be almost obsessive, it baffles me how it can be completely omitted from a lot of people’s lives without any concern. Or so it seems I have no idea what others are experiencing let alone myself. Thanks for inspiring thought and the interesting conversation. Take care."
