JoeRogan,ffnyhsr,t1_ffn8mcn,1580072267.0,Well if you respect someone's opinion then it is reasonable to. If I'm not sure about who to vote for and learn that most of the people I respect are voting for Bernie that would help me decide.
buildapcsales,ffjsxar,t1_ffjrwu3,1580006072.0,i ran with a 580 and a 1600 I think and ended up upgrading to a 2600x. Some VR games are kinda heavy on the cpu.

politics,fewt4m4,t1_fewkhq6,1579419098.0,If Biden gets the nomination then they must want 4 more years of Trump. CNN/MSNBC get better ratings when he is in office so they probably push Biden so they can keep it going.

JoeRogan,fel4kcr,t1_fel0k9o,1579213915.0,"i mean selling out arenas with a comedy act kinda confirms a lot of people think he is really funny. They don't all just go there because of the podcast and just sit and not laugh for an hour. From my research I have decided that many people think Joe Rogan is a great comedian, but none of those people post on the /r/JoeRogan subreddit."

JoeRogan,febtgbd,t1_febq4cw,1578962514.0,"His UFC stuff probably helped him too. He wasn't the greatest fighter, but not the worst by any means either. It got him a lot of exposure before JRE at least. TFATK isn't my cup of tea but they seem to have a reasonably sized following too. 

Either way I predict him and Joe will have some sort of ugly falling out within the next few years. No way he can drag that ball and chain around forever."
JoeRogan,febsdyl,t1_febripz,1578962167.0,"Only one of his I've seen is his ""This is not happening"" story and it was pretty awful. I love him as a guest on JRE though."
