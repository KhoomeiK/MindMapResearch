MadeMeSmile,fffuoty,t1_ffewusu,1579892190.0,"To a point I agree with this. I think it’s important not to make the game too easy or just falsely lose all the time.

My eldest son (5) and I play a game called dobble, it’s a pretty simple matching game the way we play it. Initially I gave myself a handicap that I had to find the match on his cards before I was allowed to find the match on mine and claim the card. It has given me immense pleasure that I can no longer do that and not get smashed by him. He doesn’t know he’s improved hugely, but I do and I can see him getting better each time. 

Our games are often close, but now he’s taking more and more cards without me having to give a little wait period before I claim the card. If I just played as well as I could I’d obliterate him and he’d lose interest in the game. This way he gets genuine wins (albeit with me having handicaps) and we get a chance to bond. One day I’ll no longer be able to win with a handicap and he’ll beat me fair and square. 

I look forward to that day, and a hundred days like it with other games as he and his brother grow up. It shows I’m doing my job properly and I love it."

MensLib,ffbfuua,t3_esmznn,1579763453.0,"Firstly, you’re never going to stop this idiots on 4chan speaking so you’re going to have to learn to tune them out. They don’t know you, so why would you give them the power to make you sad. Choose to not give them power over your feelings. Believe me it is a conscious choice (but you might have to make it a few times).

Secondly, although there are behaviours seen as ‘typical’ male behaviours the reality is that there is a huge spectrum of behaviour out there. Take some time in a cafe to people-watch the men in there you’ll soon see a wide range of masculine behaviour. If you like you can pick the behaviours that match the kind of person you feel like and use those. However it’s probably best if you just act like YOU. You’ve spent enough of your life trying to be something you’re not before transitioning. 

Having the world not see you as the person you are must be very demoralising. But my main advice is to choose carefully who you give the power to hurt you. I’ve been a lot happier since I was more careful with that."
