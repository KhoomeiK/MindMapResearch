Absolutely but isn’t it more about political visibility?  Income tax is very clear and looks like a large monthly/annual cost.   

Purchase taxes appear far more incremental and provide the illusion of choice in their sufferance.  
In other words, they’re stealth taxes that politician don’t talk about and hope nobody notices."

You can put $50m+ into developing an American Football game because the target market is so large.   
Football is the same.     

Rugby just doesn’t have that, which means the investment can’t be found to create a really good game."
unitedkingdom,ffhxlbx,t1_fffq9ep,1579958311.0,"Ok, so you keep endeavouring to insult me by inferring my expected behaviour in incomparable situations. You’ve also libelled me all in your attempt to defend yourself so this is my last comment.    

First up, you know nothing about me, my background. personality or politics (beyond a minimal snapshot that might be gleaned if you’re bothered enough to view my previous posts) - simple enough.   

Direct bigotry versus (ignorant) generalisations - they do not compare and it is utterly beyond me how you don’t understand this (I suspect you’re so blinded by trying to prove yourself justified that you’ve just lost sight but I could be giving you too much credit).  
What I said was I wouldn’t have commented on your original post had you not insulted the original poster. The rationale being that you covered the point and so any rebuttal was done. Yet you keep trying to turn that around into how I would stay silent in the face of racism.  
I can tell you how I would behave in such situations because (regrettably) I have dealt with it a number of times.  
I challenge it, I explain why they’re mistaken and provide specific examples to justify my view.   
What I don’t do is insult the individual - that’s not the way to change anyone’s opinion on anything (maybe that doesn’t matter to you but personally, I believe that the point of such situations is to try and make the world a little better rather than get into fights).     

Which bring me to the closing point - sure, you might call people gormless morons to their face but I sincerely doubt it.   
Your original post and your subsequent responses very strongly suggest that you use the anonymity of the internet to act tough.   
And if you do behave like that, I’m just glad I’m not unfortunate enough to be anywhere near you."

SNPedia,ffhqddg,t3_etojrj,1579948320.0,"A pre-natal paternity test is the single biggest waste of money I can think of.   
In short, they are unproven and almost certainly don’t work.

Non-invasive prenatal tests (NIPT), while established are still at a very early stage in terms of their scope.  

I could go on and on about this but the summary is; what approved tests that exist are focused on testing for a relatively small number of conditions that could affect the health of the child.   

There’s a lot of work ongoing to improve the scope of the tests but I’m sure you wouldn’t be surprised to hear that the credible research is focused around improving prospects of a foetuses life rather than establishing who fucked who.     

You want to know for sure who the father is then you’ll need to wait until after the birth."
unitedkingdom,ffflew2,t1_ffeikli,1579886490.0,"It's interesting that you continue to assume you know my position on the particular point in question. I have never at any point declared an opinion either way - that is not the point no matter how hard you want it to be.   

It's also interesting that you believe that it is reasonable to draw a parallel between what is a generalisation that you refute and what is a libellous statement that in the eyes of the law cannot be legally made without evidence - to accuse someone of conducting illegal acts puts the burden of proof is 100% on the accuser unless they want to end up in court (at least in countries where people are assumed innocent until proven guilty).  
They are not the same thing, they're not even close.  

To return to the original point - had you stated your case essentially in the form you did without the insults, I'd have passed over it without comment.  
The point was and remains that someone made a statement that you disagreed with, in disagreeing with it you provided no more evidence than the original poster yet believed that despite that, your opinion was so much more valid that you believed it acceptable to throw abuse into your response.   
In short, I do not believe it is a reasonable way to act and I am damn sure you wouldn't have acted that way if you were talking to them in a face-to-face situation."
unitedkingdom,ffeidrc,t1_ffefxhe,1579849236.0,"Don’t you see that you’ve entirely contradicted your own point - you are the one who responded to what you consider a baseless claim, yet provided no evidence at all.  
I.e. Precisely what you’re saying others should have done when responding to you.    

Your argument might well be valid but without evidence, you’re no different and if you’re gonna continue to argue the point then I’d at least expect you to understand that. 

But then I also expect people to behave on the internet as they would in real life so perhaps I’m out of touch."
unitedkingdom,ffdanqm,t1_ffd6cm2,1579816759.0,"I’m not defending anything, I’m pointing out the irony of your willingness to abuse others based on your opinion, which supposedly is more valid (enough to call someone else a moron) yet just as lacking in evidence of any sort.

The £500 for an exome was just an example. In terms of providing genomic medicine for those less fortunate there are a number of approaches.   
Organisations like GA4GH are looking at how to fund programs in NGS for the disadvantaged.  
But probably more realistically there are many organisations such as Lineagen who are looking to provide arrays on a much wider basis globally, which are incredibly cheap.

Cost: straight cost of sequencing is reducing at twice the rate of Moore’s law and when you compare the ROI against transitional medicine, you’re talking a benefit factor of many 100s of percent.
