In bronze/silver you may have a few people say hi in the beginning, but the comms go silent for the majority of the match. That means when you do call it out, everyone in chat WILL here you.

 Most lower ranked players will follow direction if you speak confidently and politely. They want to work as a team and win, but do they don't have the knowledge or confidence to propose their own plan. The few matches where a player speaks up and takes on the responsibility of directing a team are obvious, as any simple coordination like grouping up or comboing abilites usually dominates.

Just make sure your callouts are clearly understable and have all the vital information. In the case of an annoying flanker like Tracer, the most important details are obviously the character and their position. Other important things you should add when you can are if she has used her recall or if she is damaged.

Now I'm thinking the macguffin may not just pull Illithids from every point in space, but also time. Instead of the Illithids sending themselves back, maybe the Githyanki are dragging them back in the hopes of killing them, only to set the cycle of enslavement rolling once again. The Illithids come back, defeat and destroy the Gith, and then start guiding another races evolution towards Gith, which eventually break free and flee back in time using a stolen macguffin which they lose, they spend some time strengthening up raiding across the planes and looking for the lost macguffin (and coincedentally, for unrelated reasons the party is also tasked with retrieving the macguffin putting them on a collision path with the Githyanki), before the Gith force the Illithids to this point in time, where the cycle repeats.

Ultimately you just need to be aware, even if you are playing a hero with healing. Know the map around, especially where the health packs are. Pay attention to your team.

community,fen63nr,t1_fen3ttp,1579277796.0,"Well said, but now that the journey is over it is oddly cathartic to look back at all of the ups and downs knowing it turned out fine.

The existential dread season 4 and the events around it gave me stands out in particuliar; I was sure that that was it for the show and that everything would be downhill, like many other shows. I know there are mixed feelings about season 5 and 6, but I feel they were a true return to the Community I loved, but viewed through a more matured lense. It was like the show was no longer struggling to stay afloat, but had instead come to peace with the spectre of cancellation and decided to do their own thing regardless."

Your last sentence about how the Widow wasn't adding value can apply to any hero, especially if your team coordinates around denying them value. Widow just happens 'easier' because of how she tends to stay in her favoured spots, making it easy to tell what area is safe and what area she may be watching, but you can outplay Rein's range or outmaneuver a Bastion."

gaming,fe7if81,t1_fe76p3q,1578914950.0,"Skyrim is like an arcade racer, while the Witcher is like a racing simulator. They're very similiar, but they do have some key differences that may throw some players.

A lot of people will probably like both, although I could see why someone would like one and not the other.

Edit: let me expand. 

Skyrim is a game you can jump into and just start having fun. It's never hard to find something to do, and while those tasks are enjoyable they're usually not overly challenging. The crafting system is wide enough to give you options, but it isn't  very deep. This is similiar to arcade racers like Need for Speed or Burnout. You have easy to access races, and a small handful of upgrade options with each tier usually being objectively better than the last. A lot of easy to access fun with minimal downtime, you can just mindlessly go from activity to activity without paying much attention.

The Witcher is a game with highs and lows. You can go out and fight that monster, but before you do you should really do some of the 'boring' stuff like study it's weaknesses and craft the right items. It's not exactly fun but that kind of technical detail appeals to the player that really wants to immerse themselves, and ultimately adds to the experience. Racing simulators like Forza or Gran Turismo also insert these real world details that force you to learn the games system in much more detail than you would a more casual game. You can usually customize and tune your cars to a higher degree, requiring knowledge of how each component effects the car. These games are all about feeling like you are the Witcher, or you are the driver.

And the end of the day their both fantasy RPG's, and there is certainly a large crossover in players, but it's possible what you enjoy about one game is lacking in the other."

Probably going to want to try and contain all Flood/Zombies/Infected/etc ASAP as well, as that's a problem that grows exponentially. 

We'll have multiple Death Stars as well as Reapers, Orks, and various other threats from space. Superman or Goku would do well there, really gives them the room to go full force without worrying about friendly casualties.
