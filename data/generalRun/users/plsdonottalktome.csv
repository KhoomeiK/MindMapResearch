That pretty much except her friends disliked her a little. So two types of psychos, she went out of her way and tried very hard to hide her psycho, Joe just did the necessary."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fewnwzv,t1_fewi3sa,1579416281.0,"Why are all your claims just half valid? There are many posts showing that owls, contrary to popular belief, can be good pets. Tigers are wild, ""not meant to be taken care of"", yet they're on the verge of extinction and people are taking care of them. So again, shut up, do full research, read all sides of it rather than the things that just cater to your argument."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fewnrw2,t1_fewhzih,1579416099.0,"It is difficult so owls are terrible pets? What logic? Stupid for you, don't get a pet owl and shut up about it. If it is legal in someone's country and they are able to provide for it, let them. They are not asking for your valuable permission or even opinion."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fewhqx7,t1_fewhe9w,1579410798.0,"So do dogs, cats, squirrels, bats, raccoons, bunnies, and every other pet which is not kept properly. They don't turn out to be bad pets, their owners are bad and careless, which again, in no way can be proven in this particular video that you're commenting on."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fewhkb3,t1_fewh95y,1579410698.0,"Again, research. NATIVE owls are not legal in US, like Snowy owls and such, the small part of all owls which are too exotic and need to migrate to other countries and then come back. Legal in Australia, research please. Your claim is again half valid. It is illegal in canada and NZ."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fewh3x4,t1_fewgixa,1579410481.0,"Just because it is not in your favour, does not make it stupid.
And in the same way, i can say that you can still have pet owls in many other places. Even in US, which is apparently the #1 country in terms of being developed. First you said that it is illegal in almost all developed countries, when it isn't. Now you're saying it's illegal in anglo-sphere, i would research that as well rn but i already doubt the validity of your claims."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fewfgpr,t1_feudf7i,1579409714.0,Exactly!
AnimalsBeingJerks,fewfdrf,t1_few55am,1579409674.0,"Research please.
Owning NATIVE owls is illegal in US, no pet owls in India, Canada, Singapore. There is more to the world than US, you know :)
It is legal in UK, Japan, Russia.
3.5 on both sides. That is definitely not ""almost all of the developed world""."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fer4crp,t1_fer3rdv,1579349586.0,"I am saying the same thing as you dude. That irresponsible pet owners obviously cause a lot of harm.
If you want to see reality then maybe see what is actually happening in this specific video, rather than linking it to every single pet or bad pet owner.
Do you anywhere, in reality, see in this video that the owl or cat or the owner is being harmed?"
AnimalsBeingJerks,fer3ndd,t1_fer2z5a,1579349416.0,"That point is quite valid. I agree with you on that.
I just disagree with people who are saying that the cat is unsafe or the owners are irresponsible for letting something like this continue and rather than stoping it are filming it, or that the owl is living in bad conditions.
Promoting people to have owls as pets without knowing all the work around is obviously bad, and i agree with you on it."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fer2a2t,t1_fer1ziq,1579348800.0,Dude. Cats have their survival instinct. The cat is chill. Can you chill as well?
AnimalsBeingJerks,fer23ge,t1_fer19j6,1579348726.0,"How does any of it show in the video? That the person is resorting to violence, or the owl is being aggressive to the cat, or they are getting weak or blind, or that the owner is not able to provide for the owl.
All I'm saying is DO NOT ASSUME THAT THE OWNER OF THIS PARTICULAR OWL IS NOT TAKING CARE OF EITHER OF IT'S PET."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fer0o11,t1_feqwtxn,1579348245.0,"You're right. My bad, i meant tamed or docile, i guess. Which are well-settled in house-life."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fer0h76,t1_feqx5ue,1579348178.0,"Read my other comments.
But again, the same is the case with cats, dogs, snakes, bunnies or every other conventional pets. If they are not trained well or taken care of properly, they might often become aggressive.
That doesn't stop people from having them as pets.
As a pet owner, common sense wise, you should be able to provide for your pet."
AnimalsBeingJerks,feqzy5o,t1_feqytla,1579347947.0,"The process of lottery happens with every single animal in every species, be it elephants, dogs, cats, any of it.
Again, because something bad happens doesn't mean that it has to happen to the entire species. Lions are aggressive towards human, but their caretakers interact with them very easily in the wild.
Same way, elephants are many times stolen and made circus animals, but does that happen to every single elephant?"
AnimalsBeingJerks,feqz1cs,t1_feqtic1,1579347720.0,"Where exactly do you see that the cat is living ""under the furniture""? It seems quite fine with the owl, even in the video. The owl pokes it many times, cat legit just rolls back and relaxes. Such interactions happen when cats and dogs live together as well."
AnimalsBeingJerks,feqkr34,t1_feqjmel,1579342977.0,"You are talking solely about the ones which are returned. Owls CAN be aggressive, so can dogs, cats, rats, bunnies, snakes. Secondly, the ones returned were obviously not taken care of by their owners, which makes sense. Does that mean that owls cannot be kept as pets? No. It requires care, which you will have to do with any other pet as well, some more than others.
All I'm saying is just don't assume that the owner having a pet as an owl is compulsorily a bad thing. Maybe the owl is being treated like a king. Maybe the cat is living it's best life with an owl as an companion, it clearly wasn't scared shitless of it, considering the owl was poking it and all."
