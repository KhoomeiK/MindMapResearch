migraine,fepfoqu,t3_eq23kg,1579319334.0,I just went to my neurologist today with the sam problem! She told me to immediately discontinue ibuprofen since it is likely causing rebounds. She is also starting me a more natural route with 200 mg riboflavin and 400 mg magnesium before trying any injections. Best of luck!

college,fe6g7i3,t1_fe69hky,1578889938.0,"For sure, I’ve been in therapy for years and I thought I was getting better but I can definitely admit that I’ve regressed and I need to do what I can to get back in track. I definitely do worry about work in the future so it’ll be good to be proactive and get some new coping strategies for that too. Thank you so much for your advice, I hope you have a great semester :)"

college,fe5qsvv,t3_envnpk,1578873187.0,"Big time. Went to the airport, watched my plane fly away, and told my parents to come pick me up right where they dropped me off. I’ve reached my breaking point. Going to try and contact the deans tomorrow and see if I can take all online classes and get support for my family and still graduate in May. Wishing you a great semester!"
childfree,fdinpm1,t1_fdikjgm,1578446986.0,"Thank you for the laugh @coconut_queen this killed me. For anyone else reading this, this is your warning that it is better to live in ignorance. Basically a cake smash is when parents take their one year old, dress it up in a fancy outfit, and sit it down in front of a backdrop with a cake and let it go wild and there’s a photographer their to capture the “special moment”. If you google the monstrosity there’s no shortage of examples out there and people are paying hundreds of dollars for these elaborate photo shoots of their kids smashing cakes. These particular people were very wealthy and their kids smashed what look like a $200-$300 cake in designer outfits. Truly soul crushing to watch"
childfree,fdhowlz,t3_elfbpl,1578427222.0,"I feel this so hard. I work at a Michelin guide restaurant on New York’s Upper East Side and we occasionally have events earlier in the day before the restaurant opens. One couple had a party for their twins there one time, and they had features like an open bar, two cakes that are better than some wedding cakes I’ve seen (one for the cake smash and one for the guests), and “entertainment” which included a woman doing shit like playing instruments with kids and doing baby yoga.  It was truly some mind blowing shit let me tell you lol"
