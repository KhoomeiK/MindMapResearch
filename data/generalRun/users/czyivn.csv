politics,ffcdcei,t1_ffc5tc3,1579797011.0,It's not as easy as that. The dems ran a senate candidate in I want to say missouri who was a combat veteran and field stripped an AR-15 in a commercial. He still lost because he wasn't on the team.
DIY,ffcb26j,t1_ffc2lwz,1579795582.0,"This is a nice idea in theory, but have you ever actually tried removing a 4x4"" ceramic tile intact? They are mortared/glued to the substrate across their entire backside, and they are also incredibly brittle. I'm not sure how OP is supposed to remove the inconspicuous tile without destroying it."
politics,feo6077,t1_feo526p,1579295551.0,"You're right, we should abolish the electoral college. It's just a simple process of amending the constitution.  We'll just have congress pass a bill... oh that won't work I guess.  Well, let's assume we get that to happen, then we just have to get 38 of the states to ratify... oh.  I guess that won't work either, for the exact same reason that congress won't pass it.  The constitution gives rural states an electoral advantage, which can only be changed if they voluntarily choose to give it up.

politics,fehwe81,t1_fehttc7,1579125195.0,"I dunno man, maybe you can fuck over an average citizen or even another senator, but a sitting senator should be VERY careful of deliberately lying to nancy pelosi.  The house decides what is in spending bills, and senators live and die by how well they ""take care of"" their home state.  A senator who pisses off nancy is never gonna get any of the pork their home state so desperately craves, because if she opposes it, it won't happen."
politics,fehvddn,t1_fehuyko,1579124616.0,June was the timeline i heard to finally resolve the mcgahn issue. And there's no guarantee that any of the five republican appointed justices will side with congress then.
politics,fdo73gv,t1_fdnq3we,1578600033.0,"Not only disrupting business, Trump wants to continue living after he's president and maybe go golfing in peace. If he knew he was touching off a shit-storm he couldn't control, even he would balk.  Now his ability to assess where that line of ""controllable"" is, I'm not 100% confident where he would draw it.  I'm pretty sure, though, that he understands pissing off ALL muslims is bad. I mean, he wouldn't even go against Prince Bonesaw when he chopped up a critic in the territory of a US ally.  He did that partly because he didn't give a shit, but also partly because he knows that MBS possesses the capacity to do him harm (by spiking oil prices or expelling US troops or backing the invasion and destruction of Israel)."
todayilearned,fdk87oy,t1_fdifal8,1578498301.0,"Yes, but you need to very carefully read their definition of domestic partner.  If you claim a domestic partner that doesn't meet their complete criteria, they might claim it's fraud and use that as an excuse to deny coverage you thought you had.   They don't have incentive to check while they are just collecting premiums, but they'll definitely check if you get sick. Marriage is already legally defined and government recognized so they can't weasel out.  Domestic partner is defined by the insurance company."

This is in sparsely populated areas so that might be enough to give you the arsonist right off the bat, or a short list of maybe just a couple people."
todayilearned,fdgwsmw,t1_fdgwhy7,1578410259.0,"If you're divorcing and the collection is a joint asset, you can get in trouble for hiding it or selling it for less than it's worth.  You can't stash $60k in cash with your friend to hide it from your wife either...

If the wife knows what it's worth, and you got rid of it for less than that or hid it from her, she can get the money back (sometimes with penalties) some other way."
politics,fdgvwc5,t1_fdefh2s,1578409636.0,"If you were my friend and I found out you really wanted to have sex with a girl, but then I fired you as my best friend, would you take it as a compliment if I started fucking that girl you always wanted to fuck?  If Bolton isn't getting to pick the bombing sites himself, it's like he's not even part of the war with iran at all."
politics,fcyqkup,t1_fcyhovf,1578085048.0,"I think the key here is that they spotted a serious flaw in the system. All valuation of real estate depends upon appraisers, who aren't fantastically well-compensated people.  Tying their malfeasance back to them is an incredibly slow process.  If you have a situation where there are millions of dollars to be made, and the appraiser thinks he can claim ""whoops i made an honest mistake"" later, you're going to have a hard time policing it.  Better yet, with a big enough kickback he can just flee to the cayman islands with his gains.  A crooked appraiser can cause a LOT of damage before his shenanigans are stopped.

I think the real solution is that appraisers shouldn't be private contractors paid by the person getting the appraiser. That's an inherently corrupt setup that led to all the bond rating agencies systemically under-assessing risk.  They should probably be government employees or something similar, and there need to be more robust checks on their ability to just pull a number out of their ass."
personalfinance,fcy3g74,t1_fcxwa3w,1578074257.0,"The dealership wasn't paid in full.  They never cashed his down payment, so they are $4k short of the contracted payment for the vehicle.  They can demand it from OP, although I can't speak to how likely    
 that is or if they would prevail if they press the issue."

AskReddit,fcuwd3o,t1_fcumx0z,1577989872.0,"Yeah, I never realized what health insurance really cost until my employer started showing us the numbers (as part of explaining why they are reducing our health benefits).  My family coverage for my wife and two kids and I, paid for by my employer mostly, comes to $26k/year.  Shit's broken, yo."
funny,fcuvn46,t1_fcuqifx,1577989471.0,"Yeah, maybe I should have said ""slow you way the hell down"".  On something with a powerful engine the engine might be able to win, but NOT at highway speeds/gearing.  Most passenger cars have brakes that can at least match the max torque output of the engine, although that depends on gear ratio.  So you might be able to break it loose of the brakes in first gear, but you definitely won't be able to overcome braking friction at highway speeds."
AskReddit,fcuuwfz,t1_fcum7ct,1577989022.0,"Only temporarily.  Cotton is extremely hard on the soil, so fertility and crop yields quickly declined. That's supposedly a big reason why the confederacy was so aggressive about expanding westward into texas/kansas/missouri and maybe central america eventually.  The center of cotton production had steadily moved west as they wore out the soil and didn't know how to replenish it without chemical fertilizers. By the time of the civil war, the most productive cotton fields were on the red river in Louisiana."

Maybe stuff that's even more relevant to this hypothetical future role.  Who is going to provide better mentorship, some un-involved founders or active and engaged participants in the business? OP said they want to stay, but the rest of their words said they should be looking for something better where they will learn more and maybe even have a future path they want."

teslamotors,fbdzjv2,t1_fbdylfy,1576774855.0,"Tesla exists as a viable company because they found people willing to shell out the cash for the performance model 3.  You weren't willing to shell out the cash for that model, so they sold you the same car for less by removing some features, thereby keeping you as a customer (albeit making less profit from you).  You shouldn't feel ripped off, the P3D customers should feel ripped off. People who bought the cheaper car got almost the exact same car for much cheaper, and also have the option to change their mind later and get more functionality unlocked.  That's a pure win for people who bought the dual motor.  They got a better car at a cheaper price."
