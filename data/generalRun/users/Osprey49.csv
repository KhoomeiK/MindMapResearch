depression,ffozskn,t3_eu9rtb,1580083739.0,"The only time I'm happy & not depressed is when I'm around things that can kill me. 
Everyone asks why I'm not scared & am I crazy lol. It would just be like a natural death then, passive suicidal I guess.  Depression can turn you into the ultimate daredevil lol."
SuicideWatch,fe0piuq,t3_en71w4,1578817187.0,The drinking is just making you feel worse. I think you have courage already to still be here despite the drinking. Maybe there's a good reason for that?
SuicideWatch,fe0nfyu,t3_enjg1y,1578816407.0,"You had the strength to get off meth, that's hard to do. I wish I had that kind of willpower. Use that willpower to start over and I think you will do great."
SuicideWatch,fe0mkqe,t3_enfp2z,1578816120.0,Please don't do it. If you are feeling like you might do it then what can it hurt to call the number & talk to someone?  I bet there's plenty of people that care about you. I cared enough to reply & don't even know you so there's gotta be more that care.
SuicideWatch,fe0lo4g,t3_enit3p,1578815670.0,I was voluntarily hospitalized about 20 years ago for 3 or 5 days I believe. The first night sucked but the group therapy helped me a lot. I did pretty good for several years after that.
SuicideWatch,fe0kdcr,t3_enkbt4,1578814922.0,I'm 50 and haven't accomplished anything great but I'm somehow still here. You still have a lot of good years left to do whatever you want.
SuicideWatch,fe0jn41,t3_enj2xh,1578814499.0,The same thing happens to me with family/friends. I usually don't get any texts unless it's a reply from one i sent. I get them fast if someone needs me to do something though. It sucks but I'm used to it.
depression,fdql7pf,t1_fdqhrco,1578669341.0,"I'm with you. I see Alzheimer's and Dementia all day every day. There's no way I would want any of that. Would go from being depressed to having somebody wash you, wipe your butt and do everything else for you along with the depression.  It's also a long slow cruel disease."
depression,fdkb59o,t1_fdkaki4,1578500147.0,"I usually take a few melatonin gummies and sleep fine. I was reading about Wellbutrin yesterday, the other drugs do make me tired all the time. So I was looking for one that didn't do that. Have a great day!"
depression,fdk9z59,t3_elujb1,1578499413.0,"I see my Doctor today and have been thinking about trying Wellbutrin. I think it's the only one I haven't tried over the years. It sounds like the side effects aren't as bad as with the other drugs. I'm glad you got on meds, you didn't cave in."
depression,fdk7qfy,t1_fdih1n5,1578497995.0,This is great advice. I'm also 50 and have had depression all these years. Getting pissed off does help. I go for a long hike and start off depressed but after the first mile I'm in attack mode and feel ready to take on anything. Same thing happens when I mow the yard. Sitting around the house doing nothing is the worse thing for depressed people.
depression,fdjjbh4,t3_elpwxv,1578473457.0,I would like to know the answer to this myself.  All the SSRI'S make me want to lay around the house. I've taken a few that made me not care about anything and Paxil made me crave alcohol everytime I was on it.  None of them have ever made me happy or positive and the side effects just made things worse.  I guess they work for some people.
depression,fdjipp3,t3_elpzet,1578472638.0,"I'm the same way. It's just overanalyzing and over thinking every comment, look or whatever I get from people. I've been this way since the 80s and 99.9% of the time i was reading people wrong & it had nothing to do with me. It definitely wears you out overanalyzing everything. 

 Depression/anxiety causes paranoia, worry and all kinds of crap. I have Gad/ocpd & if I could stop the overanalyzing & constant worry I would be ok. Klonopin has been the only thing that slows it down for me. It's just not good to take long term."
depression,fdji0r4,t3_elpmel,1578471711.0,A whole lot of us feel that way sometimes or all the time. We just have to keep on going until things improve. It's a good thing that you have your family and girlfriend. Have you tried counseling or seen a Doctor about your feelings?
depression,fdjhgvk,t3_elotyu,1578470998.0,"Good job! There's always someone you can help out and it also ends up helping you. Helping out others helps me more than any medication I've taken. Even picking up trash, pushing shopping carts in the store etc.. makes me feel better."
depression,fdh58jv,t1_fdgldj2,1578415654.0,"Yeah, 50 here but I'm still here!"
depression,fdgxokk,t3_el5pb0,1578410874.0,"The longer you lay there the worse it will get. You just have to somehow find the will to get up and do something. Sew them squares, take a shower, clean house or whatever & that will help."
depression,fdgwohs,t3_elas7w,1578410181.0,"Maybe just work on improving yourself while you're alone. If you are not comfortable with going to a gym you could walk hills, exercise at home. Maybe take up hiking or photography with your phone. Doesnt cost much to do that and it will help."
depression,fdgv4qi,t3_el7fo7,1578409091.0,"I intended on offing myself many years ago and left a note. Family found it and I ended up in a psych hospital for a little while. It sucked then but after a few months I was so glad they found it.

 All those people that called and texted care about you and with you being so young there is a lot to live for even though you can't see it now. You might be embarrassed that everyone knows but that will go away and be forgotten. I still have depression but became the person that family members called when they were depressed over the years because they knew I had been through it. I'm glad you are still here. 

 If I would have succeeded back then I would have missed out on so many good times & I was 32. If I could go back to 17 I would put everything into my schooling and doing my best to be in excellent shape. Skip any partying & be good to everyone. You leaving that note was a new beginning for you. I think you will be shocked how much better things are for you 6 months from now."
SuicideWatch,fc2jc6n,t3_efqvyj,1577363241.0,You are no coward. You are very strong to make it through the day and keep going. You should reward yourself for making it through each day.
