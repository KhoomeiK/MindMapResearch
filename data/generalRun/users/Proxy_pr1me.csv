Its physically impossible to put out 12 million acres of burning forest out. All they did was contain it while it burned itself out. NOT counting of course the structural firefighting that had to be done in between. I'm not hating on firefighters, quite the opposite. I have nothing but respect for those brave men and women. You cant compare wild fire which are seasonal more or less to every day metropolitan fire duty."

educationalgifs,fc9881i,t1_fc8hgck,1577548593.0,There is tech and equipment available for what your suggesting but it's expensive and while smaller department may be able to purchase it and equip all their rigs mucipical departments like  FDNY or LA FD wont spend the money simply because it will cost too much equipping and training everyone on said equipment. Big department have good gear but it's no where close to top of the line stuff
educationalgifs,fc97rc0,t1_fc8zyv7,1577548378.0,"Name checks out lol. No department worth their salt will introduce interior attack on a vacant building, they go to an outside operation right away. You still have to go in if someone says there is a person trapped inside whether it's true or not. Also what your saying is only possible in certain areas, sure those ""progressive"" departments can afford to go with an exterior attack in rural or suburban areas but in major cities it's simply not possible. For example if there is a fire in a row frame type building if you dont conduct an aggressive interior attack you will lose the entire block. Check your facts."

educationalgifs,fc74uan,t3_egem46,1577497567.0,"Doesnt look like a technique to me from this video. More like they lost control of the line and fell over. Also bad idea  opening a fog nozzle like that, you're thinning out the stream. All that water will quickly turn in to steam and burn the nozzle team. Nozzle man should have at least an arms length of line in front of him and more importantly the back up man should be directly behind the nozzle  man... you know, backing him up. Not next to him like in the video. Judging by the helmets looks like that's somewhere in Europe maybe.
