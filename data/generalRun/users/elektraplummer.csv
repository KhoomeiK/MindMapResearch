JUSTNOMIL,ffdab72,t3_er96jo,1579816541.0,I'm just tired of my kid being used as basically a photo prop. She literally got upset at his preschool Christmas program because he was too hyper and excited and distracted to sit still for a picture so she left in a weepy martyred huff. She didn't even consider just talking to him about what he was excited about so that maybe he would then calm down.

longhair,fesk01v,t1_feqdskd,1579366018.0,When my hair was longer I always carried a small brush in my purse and brushed it out at least once a day if I was wearing it loose.
fatlogic,fejvbg4,t1_feiweaa,1579186684.0,Ask her to stop.
LoseitChallenges,fedrxdl,t3_eo479q,1579018591.0,I did the thing and I'm hungry for upvotes!
