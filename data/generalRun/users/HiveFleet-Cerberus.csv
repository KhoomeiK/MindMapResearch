Triumph,ffz3p3f,t1_ffyybfp,1580362919.0,Noted. There an aftermarket solution?
Triumph,ffyqx5x,t1_ffyqnvp,1580352958.0,"Aye, definitely not looking to spend my first weekend with it on my ass. Mostly I intend to circle the bay (bay area California) a couple times then head in. After that it'll be mostly commuting save for weekend romps."

The triple on the other hand was just butter smooth all the way through save the very top where it fell off a bit. Personally I definitely liked the 3 cylinder better."

There's a reason they're built to deliver gobs of torque at low rpm but aren't set up for the airflow or rpm requirements to make high horsepower. You might also notice that across the entire world work/industrial vehicle engines are built in to the same design philosophy.

You talked about scouring maps to hunt for secrets or otherwise exploring a game where doing such is relevant in some meaningful way. If this game was an rpg you'd have a point. But it's not. Prestige is just about playing the same thing over and over again and watching a bar move and things you've already unlocked get unlocked again. You're not gaining any hidden secrets or ""gems"". And no I don't consider the prestige cosmetics at all worth the effort as they're extremely poor ""rewards"" in exchange for having to go through the grind of re-unlocking everything. What's more this game isn't about watching an xp bar fill up over and over again even if that mechanic has been tacked on. In fact I'd say it's to the detriment of the core game because the people chasing the carrot on that stick are actively incentivized to chase the maximum amount of points per match at the expense of playing the actual objective just so they can fill that xp bar more. The prestige system is actively at odds with the core game play."
modernwarfare,ffazf7t,t1_ffayl88,1579748046.0,I stopped doing prestige after WaW (and skipped the last 3 CoDs) so I don't know for sure. But I doubt it was anything that would have been worth the time to me personally.

I am indeed the guy who humps every corner of the map for goodies in a game where doing so has a tangible or worthwhile reward.

modernwarfare,ffamzph,t1_ffaksab,1579739756.0,Not really. High scores in games like that are a point of skill. Prestige is a point of time investment.
