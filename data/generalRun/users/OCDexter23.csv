bipolar2,fe98cjg,t3_eo6h15,1578935297.0,I have BP2 and severe OCD. It differs for most people you treat but tell your psychiatrist. I was on ocd meds and switch because I hated my depression phases. Currently I’m on latuda and it’s helped immensely.  I was also in therapy for months for my ocd so that has helped as well.

Yeah I mean you don’t care about the prices. I’ve been driving to Colorado personally for the last 2-3 years and the prices are significantly cheaper. Even from visiting California, Washington, and Oregon is incredibly cheaper than Illinois. Hopefully prices decrease but I’m with you on the fact to pay for something that’s good."
