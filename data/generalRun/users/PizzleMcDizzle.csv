I was one of the higher achieving students in the course, finished first in a couple subjects, and now am probably one of the least skilled PT's that graduated out of that cohort. Settled for a higher paying, non-stimulating job and plateaued as a clinician. Meanwhile others with poor grades are trending in the opposite direction. Most of what you learn will come from your job, where you discover what it's really like to be a physio and flesh out what's important and what's not. Having a good mentor will help.

>The soot is black and usually pretty big as far as aerosols go. It's actually going to absorb a lot of solar radiation and emit infrared causing temperatures to increase even more. Because it's so big though, most of it will eventually leave the atmosphere by gravitational settling. But it's actually hydrophobic, so the smaller particles won't rain out on their own.

However, my over-arching intention through this discussion it that Morrison has refused to acknowledge climate change in the sense that he is not doing anything to combat it. He is in a position where there is no credible reason to be ignorant. The devastation should spurn him to act for the future, to try and prevent fires on this scale happening again. He has publicly stated he will not budge on climate change policies. He has also said that he's taking steps to tackle climate change, which he isn't doing. I see no difference between choosing to ignore climate change, and pretending *not* ignore it, the two in my mind are not mutually exclusive. Either way, he is not doing anything to improve Australia's climate change policies. You're highlighting the nuances of the phrasing, rather than the sum of the parts here.  For what purpose?"
australia,fd04wsp,t1_fcykjqd,1578113678.0,This may be the source for anyone interested - [https://climateanalytics.org/latest/australia-on-track-to-become-one-of-the-worlds-major-climate-polluters/](https://climateanalytics.org/latest/australia-on-track-to-become-one-of-the-worlds-major-climate-polluters/)
australia,fd04qts,t1_fczeght,1578113606.0,Yes you are right - sorry I didn't see this post before i commented haha
australia,fd02f6b,t1_fcy1sy9,1578112640.0,"1) Hence why I re-iterated what I actually meant. You're trying to pick an argument based off a hastily written comment I made - which I then clarified is in terms of the *lack of action* taken by the LNP - and I'm not really sure why. More power to you. It doesn't change my belief about the inaction of the LNP regarding climate change.   


2) Just because Morrison says ""he's acting on it"", you actually believe he's acting on it? And we're all just supposed to believe him are we? What's he done? You're taking the word of a lying, immoral politician, who's done nothing if not worsen the current climate. The article you reference by the way is [news.com](https://news.com). Highly credible.   
Why don't you have a read of the [2020 Climate Change Performance Index](https://newclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CCPI-2020-Results_Web_Version.pdf) and get back to me.    
For your interest, your own source here indicates the Morrison is fudging the data on the 'action' they've taken. ""Climate change experts have criticised the government’s use of a so-called “loophole” that allows it to use carry-over credits from the Kyoto agreement to meet Paris targets"". Hmm.   


3)  If we oppose the position, let's oppose the position at play.... alright professor. Our global emissions are not 1.08% based off your very old 2017 source on ***Wikipedia***. I actually meant [1.4%](https://climateanalytics.org/latest/australia-on-track-to-become-one-of-the-worlds-major-climate-polluters/).  Whatever the number, more should be done to reduce it, and that's not happening. Of course in absolute terms that number is substantial - it's roughly 538 million tonnes of CO2 being leaked into the atmosphere. That's obscene and the whole reason for this fucking argument mate, I know it's a 'fair share'. 

Australia is at [odds with the Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/australia-s-greenhouse-gas-emissions-up-for-four-years-in-a-row-20190529-p51s6u.html) 4 years in a row - that doesn't include 2019 data, but the current weather conditions indicate the damage is already being done. The use of coal and gas mining contributes to CO2 emissions  - in the current context any number is substantial and per capita Australia is one of the highest producers of emissions in the world. That's why action needs to be taken."

australia,fcxb677,t3_ejdl46,1578058009.0,"There really isn't anything to argue with here, because the outcome is blatantly obvious. I personally cannot believe the refusal to tackle climate change policies after a national catastrophe of this scale.. Warmer and drier conditions will continue this apocalyptic trend into the future unless changes are made to cut our emissions. 1.3% isn't much on a global scale, but it's got to start somewhere, and we should be putting pressure on the US, China and India to follow suit. Even then it might even be too late because of previous inaction.

It's miraculous to see some acknowledgement of climate change from a few of our leaders, but acknowledgement is meaningless if the there is no action taken to start to solve the problem. How can the federal government be so unwilling to address this, and then publicly back fossil fuel projects amidst the crisis?  It's a clear indication of where our nation's intent lies, and how ruthlessly Murdoch controls the current political landscape. I don't know how it changes from here.

Hot take - I don't think at all what you did was petty, or that you should have reservations about it. Death doesn't just erase all the bad things from a persons past. It's unfortunate that he had to suffer like he did, but he was still horrible to you, and it must have been cathartic to find some closure like you mentioned. There is *no* reason why someone's death should mean they aren't allowed be held accountable for their actions."
australia,fcwql88,t1_fcqwun4,1578033748.0,"Maybe he has acknowledged it's real, I can't argue that statement and I probably over-simplified in the original comment - purely semantics though. There's a big difference between acknowledging it, and then choosing to ignore it. Acknowledgement is meaningless if the government keep backing fossil fuel projects.   


Let's be real. The man's a coward, and he's too concerned with $$ in his voter's pockets to really put a dent in our emissions. Australia's total of 1.3% of global emissions isn't much, but changes need to be made. If he acknowledges climate change, then the Adani Coal Mine should simply not proceed - it's expected to be 1.3x our current total, contributing an additional 705 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere each year. Two more gas plants were given support in QLD and Victoria in the midst of the crisis over Christmas. 

Take action, make a stand, put the community and the countries' interests forward. Acknowledging it is one thing, advocating for change and *acting* is another. But we know he won't, and that's the problem."
