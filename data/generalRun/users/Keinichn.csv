It took about 5-10 minutes of searching to find that not only did the manufacturing industry in this state hit a recession early last year, but 6500 jobs in the sector were lost in the first half and the sector was also down nearly 7000 jobs for all of 2019.

Notice how your source conveniently left out job losses. Your source says that 6000 jobs were added in the first half of 2019. My research, and official BLS sources, say that about 6500 manufacturing jobs were *lost* in that same time frame.
