Fran and colleen always use s3 when allies are low on health (40% iirc). Actually this works for all smart healers.

Lyn doesn’t use s3 when available. Maybe with a given threshold (30%?)

Lushen always uses s3 IF enemies are low enough on HP (25-30% seem to be low enough). Shaina too.

Qb uses s3 on ally with lowest HP ratio. If it’s a tie he casts it on the ally with lowest eHP. The same happens to khmun shield.

As for pvp, set 1 monster as defense in arena so you lose defenses and have an easier time in offense. You need those points for the devilmon and towers.

Join a weak guild and start doing guild wars and siege. As long as you are in a weak guild you will face enemies as low level as you and have a little fun against non-meta comps.

A rune with lots of crit rate or cd is great too, even if the stat is not grindable. 

A cd rune with cr is also always desirable because you never have enough 30% cr runes to compensate for it.

On a nuker, like lushen, you often prefer 50 flat atk or 5% cd over 10% defense too.
