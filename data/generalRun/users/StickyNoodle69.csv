I'm somewhat familiar with the closing costs. Isn't it like 5% of the loan you get from the lender? That is quite a large sum if true. Taxes I am not too educated on. If I plan on getting a small home for 100k what can I expect to pay on taxes?"

About the TED, did you not get eye symptoms when increasing meds? Or just other hyper symptoms? For me its hyper -like symptoms (like less sleep) and eye pain/ movement restrictions/ light sensativity. I will look into TRAB. But I have to add when I was on higher T3 levels (about 80-90% of range) I had 0 eye pains, just red eyes. You said your T3 levels are midway? If the range is 2-4 would that mean FT3 levels are around 2?"

I tried T4 only for about a year was on 75 mcg only TSH was around 1 so the endo said that was enough, but I kept complaining of symptoms and T3 was below range. I left, second doctor put me on T3 and things helped my eyes and hypo symptoms. No more eye pain or eye restriction when T3 are in high/ optimal ranges, but I would always get red eyes. My T3 to T4 medicine ratio was not  normal. I moved for work to a new state had to get a new doc of course. They wanted me to decrease T3 because I was basically mostly taking T3 only adn a little T4. While all hypo symptoms were gone eventually I had new strange symptoms.  But as I added more T4 and decreased T3 those symptoms subsided. So here I am again on T4 only but with more T4 and with that higher T3 than I was on 75 mcg of T4. About 50% of T3 of range, definitly dont feel too well. injuries from the gym are not healing either.

philosophy,ffmdotc,t3_erhl5o,1580053037.0," 

Hi, Im new here and I'm not really one to be into philosophy. I didn't go to school taking any classes on it nor do I read books on it. Just kinda wanted to voice something that I though of a long time ago. I always ignored it but maybe this philosophy I have isn't new and someone thought of it before. Maybe you guys can show me more about it.

But yea, basically I have this idea about life. Basically, we are all just following a program ina way. Not really a program as much as an equation. I see this world as a soup/ stew of chemicals/ atoms and stuff just interacting as an equation playing itself out.

Let me give you a simple example. I have a six sided die. I roll it on the desk, it lands on 4. At that given point, it woulda landed on 4 no matter what. There is no alternate universe where it coulda landed on x. It landed on 4 for a reason. (if there is an alternate universe where it lands on 5 then it's whatever its not where I am going on this post) As everything happens for a reason, yes? It landed on 4 because many many variables and reasons. From the force applied to the die, the height it fell from, maybe the hardness of the table and die played a roll on why it lands on 4 or even the temperature of the room. All of these factors played a roll on why that die lands on 4 at that given point. There is a reason and an explaination for that die landing on 4 as there is a reason for why anything happens. Why? Because we are governed by laws.

Do you understand the point I am trying to paint for you, math is everything, it is the law. There are these laws that govern us and things. Nothing is random. There is a reason for everything, maybe we might not understand certain things and how they work, but there is a reason. (electrons being in two places at once?) Maybe one day we discover why, or maybe my theory is just flat out wrong? Who really knows. But if you can see my point, let me ask you a question. With this idea, how about our brains? The decisions we make? Are they like dies rolling on 4? Similarily chemical reactions are like the die example explained above, yea? Thnk about it on a very micro physical level. Soo, whats the difference when again, it's governed by math and reason? Our emotions are just mathamatical formulas playing out as well? Well, yea, that's my theory/ philosophy sadly.

Is randomness governed by laws and reason? By definition, no? What is truely random irl that we know of? The only thing I can think of are electrons right? Im no scientist or whatever and I dont read/ study it but correct me if I am wrong: electrons can be in multiple places at once, and they move ""randomly."" But to be fair, just because we don't know how something works today doesn't mean we will uncover how it works tomorrow. What irl is truely random that we can prove is random and doesn't follow any law? A computer program? Nope, thats psuedo-randomness. It is based off a written formula and can be solved if you know the formula. So what is? Idk either, you guys tell me.

Otherwise everything including you and your decisions are constricted by laws and reason. Do you feel like the way you're typing x is really your decision? Are you truely free? Those decisions really yours or are you just resolving the chemical equations in your head, plus some past experiences of what you read or learned etc all resolving into a response you will soon type up to defy my theory.

It's like we are just here to watch and learn. Hell, who says it's just one soul per body, these souls/ conciousness can't really do anything if the physical part (chemicals in the brain etc) are in full control. What does it or they do? Just watch and learn? Why were you put here to suffer, learn, or be rewarded?

Let me know what you guys think. I'm not super educated so I may bring some stuff up and sound really stupid but I hope I painted an image to where you can understand my idea/ theory. go easy on me! :) What do you think!?"
