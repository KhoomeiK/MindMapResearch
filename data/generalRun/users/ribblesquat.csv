Fantasy,fdrnuhq,t3_emull3,1578687188.0,"So, not a book but Starchaser: The Legend of Orin is a 1986 animated attempt at cashing in on the popularity of Star Wars. Like, [they are not hiding it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8UZ2WfLG70) I have no idea if it's any good but I can say that there is imagery that stuck with me for decades from the one time I saw it as a child in the late 80s. The only reason I know its name is I had one of those, ""This is the moment to figure out what the hell was that,"" sort of days.

EDIT: See comment from u/Wiron2. Sounds like Starchaser has got some shitty 80s themes going on. My apologies.

I also have a fondness for the animated film Titan A.E. which is a lot less Star Warsy but has the same whiz bang adventure tone. Some lousy late 90s music though."
Fantasy,fdrl8z6,t1_fdr95wy,1578686158.0,"I thought of this too but FYI, this is the rare Margaret Weiss solo joint. Likewise I enjoyed it as a kid but can't say how it would stand up to adult eyes. For those who haven't read it the series typifies the recent thread about the prevalence positive monarchies in fantasy by reversing the Star Wars roles... the toppled monarchy is good and the revolutionary republic is bad. (If I recall correctly there are basically lightsabers genetically coded to only work for those of royal blood.)"

television,fdk96dx,t3_eltspt,1578498913.0,"I have been meaning to read Locke and Key forever but my impression was always it's super dark and this trailer looks rather YA. Maybe I should hold off on reading the comics just a little longer because I'm wondering if I watch the show right after reading the comics maybe it'll make me angry and disappointed. Perhaps it's best to enjoy the show for what it is and read the comics afterwards for the ""real"" story. Of course, Catch-22, then I'll probably have major plot points spoiled for me.

EDIT: Looks like the entire series is available on Hoopla. If I bang through it in a week I'll have about three weeks to cool down and get some distance before the show airs."
