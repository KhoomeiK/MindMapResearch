depression,fdl0a6b,t3_elxmzn,1578514776.0,"I really don't hope so!

I can only tell you what helps me in such moments. 

Hot shower, sweet stuff to eat, relaxing music or and audiobook (youtube or so) and depending on my energy level sport/walking or lying in my bed and watching anime/reading novel. In special occasions I listen to my sad music-list and can maybe cry. When i feel really lost I chat here or elsewhere to distract myself from... yeah myself.

My thoughts:

""I should die / I'm awful"" sounds like it comes from an external source or like you are comparing yourself to some standards society/religion sets and you can't achieve. 

I don't know you. You really could be awful and immature. So what? 

You dont really say why you think of yourself this way, but I can only say that I always think of myself as a beeing that just wants to have fun and gettin loved. When I dislike myself I only do it because I really want something I cant achieve or because others make me feel this way. 

But there is no stress to achieve something. Only you have the control over the things you want to do and how important they truly are. Try to be on your side, and let yourself time to grow. 

When others are at fault for this emotion I try to rethink if I may misunderstand, they maybe have good intentions? When not just ""f\*\*k them and their opinion"". When they are important parts of my life, I try to talk about it.

&#x200B;

Everyone will tell you something different of what exactly it means to be ""grown up"". But why would you aim to behave in a way,that other people think of as, ""grown up""?

Why not behave in a way you like, or you think you should behave = aka. do what you want and you can live with the consequences, cause it was truly your decision."
depression,fdkusrs,t1_fdksww6,1578511594.0,"Hum, you said "" Be narcissistic. Other people will already think that way about you""

1. Beeing narcisstic isn't tha same as  acknowledging your issus
2. People dont already think about you this way. They see and like you for how you behave and make them feel. When you change that it changes your relationship. 
3. For me personally, I cant change fluently between beeing honest and open and wearing my mask. And since I first started showing my emotions I wasnt able to go back wearing this ""mask"". That was 8 years ago."
depression,fdkt7xd,t3_elr1rq,1578510657.0,"fact = you think about hiding the cause of your ""theoretical death"" 

means ->  that you have people in your life you genuinely care about, or?

For me it's my core family (Mother,Father,Sister). And when i lose myself and only want to die, their existence holds me back. Value it more."

depression,f1p2pxc,t3_dabe8s,1569670469.0,"26 years, depression since 11.After mobbing until 16 it got a bit better.Lots of Sports, new school and trying to reach the stuff a normal human beeing wants.

After having some relationships, friends, sex,party & weed with 18-21 and realising that the satisfaction wasn't really there, no one cares, everything still felt so empty and only was exhausting it only got worse and worse with my bad habits.

ca.4 years later with 25 (after 1500 movies, hundreds of series/anime, hundreds of books/novel), the boredome and the pain from my body reached an apex.So I started to better my self again.

I quit:

\-selfharm

\-smoking

\-drinking

\-bad eating habits (disorder)

\-weed

\-gaming

I quit because after years of doing this I cant feel alive or at least feel anything through them. The bad habits just don't work anymore.

I started:

\-good eating habits

\-fixed sleep cycle

\-sport

\-meditation

Fazit:

\-I still feel like shit. Nothing changed.

\-No therapie or meds the last 10 years ever helped.

\-good habits make life a bit less painful but without the bad it feels even emptier than before

\-no new experience was really exiting and/or worthy of remembrance , everything gets repetitive really fast

(fantasy worlds in books are nice -> but even they get repetitive very fast)

\-I seem to dislike reality on a fundamental level, and lost the ability to really care about something / to give something a value

Why I dont kill myself:

\-I'm living in germany = top living conditions on this planet = i dont rly have problems

\-only under cruel circumstances I think I would have the courage (when people say suicide is cowardly and/or easy you already know they never truely tried)

\-I'm afraid of non-existence/death

\-I'm afraid of suizide failure / lifelong disability

\-I still sometimes have hope to change, I mean everything constantly changes - something I often dislike in life -  = nothing is for eternity = so it can change for better = the possibility exists

\- I believe I only have one life = it will end anyway, may try a bit longer

(my dream is to one day try something out and than it clicks and I feel it is truely worth living my life)

\-I have manic phases that are better than any sex or weak drug (never tried hard drugs/ afraid to become addicted when i try) = good days/moments exist

\-I like my parents and my sister
