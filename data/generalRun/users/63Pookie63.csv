I don’t know what to do any more. I’ve suspected/ known the guy im dating has emotional and temper problems. He is below average in the intelligence department, and I’m not just saying that he was predicted to have physical and mental delay in the womb but when he came out physically ok his parents never looked any further into special testing or tutoring. 

I only bring this Up because I think it contributes greatly to his emotional and temper problems. 

We live about ten minutes apart. He is 24 and just got his own place for the first time. In reality he lives in a small apt above his grandmother, but still it’s “his own”  he does not come to see me any more. All he wants to do is sit in his apartment and expects me to come to him constantly. He literally will not come to my house any more. 
He says all I do is insult him because he expects me to do all of the cleaning, laundry, etc at his place when I have my own place, job and child.  Sometimes I do. For weeks at a time I will. I’ll have a overnight bag, and not stay at my place for long stretches just because I can’t keep up with cleaning both, taking care of both, having some stuff here some there. 
It wears on me mentally. 
He is also a slob. I am not overly rigid with my standard of living, but yes I like it clean and comfortable. By that I mean I’m not anal by any stretch of the imagination... my place could be described as messy at times but never dirty or gross. He has no standards. He will pile garbage on the counters, the table wherever. Eat takeout leave the garbage on the table. Drink 3-8 sodas (no lie) in a day and leave them sitting around. His friend does the same thing so that’s two grown adults I have to pick up after. It’s not just simple tidying up. It’s full on cleaning top to bottom. There has been dishes in his sink for about 3 weeks now, that of course were Put in the sink without being rinsed... so I even rinsed them off and organized them hoping they would get done. No they haven’t. 

It’s too much. And then he has the audacity to say I don’t do enough, or that I complain too much because I tell him he is gross for living that way. I woke up the other day at 6am to wash all his bedding, before going to work for twelve hours and then I get told “why haven’t you brought them back” when he has a vehicle and could easily come get them. 

It’s never enough, it doesn’t matter how much I try and bend over backwards it’s never enough."
