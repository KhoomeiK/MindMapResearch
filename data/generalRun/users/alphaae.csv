Futurology,ffhnb4z,t1_ffgje6a,1579943619.0,Let me point this out. I have Apple Car play in my vehicle.  Recently I’ve noticed that when I start driving the maps system will put a location in the system even without being prompted. It will direct me to work or other places even when I haven’t requested it. So it already is tied to my phone and tracking which places I go in an attempt to be helpful. And is tracking my movements.

I imagine that would be more feasible than creating a whole new system run that is reliant on new roadway systems."
Futurology,ffhmnke,t1_ffgmjqo,1579942620.0,I saw a video on this once where they showed how the system would automatically reroute all traffic to other streets on the event that there was an accident or some type of obstruction in the way.

Which I think is an interesting prospect considering most people are against the death penalty due to it being cruel and unusual. But isn’t life in prison just as cruel? 

You should check out Norway’s philosophy. They only allow a max sentencing of 18 years. But they have a very low return rate for those who get out.

There’s a really good documentary on Netflix’s called Worlds Toughest prison that explores this idea.
