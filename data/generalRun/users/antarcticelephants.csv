medicalschool,ff0zwgc,t1_ff0u5ki,1579473887.0,"All of that is exactly how it work in the UK too, except we don't have such a thing as a 'yearly check up'. Despite this people don't seem to slip through the net like everybody here is suggesting they would, probably because its a lot easier to see your doctor here as you don't have to worry about the cost.

I'm aware I'm being cynical. But given that other countries don't do it without any apparent disadvantage, a for profit healthcare service mandating healthy people to go see their doctor seems highly suspect to me.

I'm also not remotely saying general practice/family medicine isn't important or looking down on it. No idea where you've got that from. I'm a 4th year at a medical school that gives us a tonne of GP placements (in fact it's what I'm on now)."
medicalschool,feypeoz,t1_feylpd1,1579448670.0,"This patient presents to the GP regardless of annual checkups.

Then again the threshold for people presenting with a problem is much lower in the rest of the world given its free/cheap so maybe that's why we don't have that problem.

Edit: turns out it's somehow a bad idea to criticise the American healthcare system on reddit..."
medicalschool,fexd6f0,t3_eqpas1,1579429000.0,"Slightly off topic but what is it with Americans and having annual check ups with their doctors? Feels like a money making thing.

In the UK you go to your doctor if you are sick and pretty much only then. If you have a chronic disease like you'll see a specialist nurse once a year in the GP for a review, if its particularly difficult to manage then you'll see a endocrinologist at lesst once a year as well but that's a tiny subset of Diabetic patients."
todayilearned,fef46s5,t1_feez3gm,1579047770.0,"I mean she does an awful lot more than that. The Queen is an extremely powerful diplomatic tool.

Also our monarchy is a huge tourism bonus. Not nearly as many people want to see the house where the Royal family lived when we had one, but a real life queen is literally right there in that building? People eat that up and spend loads of money here whilst they do it."

Also there were street parties and the like for the diamond jubilee too."
JuniorDoctorsUK,fe2frhv,t1_fe2ah2p,1578837878.0,"True, the RAF GP I know also loves it, and marines are good at getting STIs so I'm probably being pessimistic (and biased since I don't want to do GP).

Think it would also depend where you are sent and what regiments are based there."
JuniorDoctorsUK,fe1z6ec,t3_enllij,1578832615.0,"I didn't actually get through the application cycle (they did another review of my medical record between briefing and main board and suddenly realised I was blind af and med failed me a week before mainboard).

It sounds like you've got most of the positives that drew me to it but the things that I was worried about were:

* it's a 12 year commission starting when you leave Sandhurst (I.e. After F2), that is a very long time to commit to when you are still 5 years out of actually starting. There is an exit point at 4 years in but I don't know how this works with the bursary, I'd assume you would have to give at least some of it back.

* 3 years general duties put me off slightly, I'm a mature student so didn't really want to delay starting specialty training.

* you don't have the same specialty choice. No paediatrics, no Oncology, no Psychiatry (AFAIK).

* if your chosen specialty is full you can't take a year out to reapply, you do something else.

* you will be pressured hard into shortage specialties like GP. 

* on the subject of GP, it's mind numbingly dull to be an army GP. Nearly all of your patients are serving which means they do not have any interesting problems to manage (otherwise they didn't get in/got med discharged). You will also get a lot of soldiers with soft tissue injuries, and a lot of soldiers faking soft tissue injuries to get out of phys/light duties.

* you will deskill/forget all your paediatrics and geriatrics training. This will make civvie life hard when you leave.

* you will be in one of 6 defence hospitals for foundation training, probably Birmingham, hopefully not anywhere near Pirbright (basic training for soldiers).

* the average squaddie is an idiot. These are your patients. Also expect to deal with quite a lot of alcohol and drug dependencies (although this view may have been skewed by the stories I hear from an RMP mate). 

Despite all this I still want to join if they'd let me. But at least now your know. Go join your universities OTC/URNU/Air Squadron for a better idea of Officer life and who your fellow officers will be. 

Positives you didn't mention:

* better pension 

* consultant posts in things like anaesthetics, emergency medicine and T&O love ex military doctors. 

* everyone loves the doctor, even the soldiers who normally hate the officer class (particularly above Captain). 

Also, join the Navy because its the same job (seemingly doctors float between services, I know an RAF GP attached to RM) and Lieutenant Surgeon sounds far cooler than Captain."

The royal family are not funded by tax. They are funded from the proceeds of the crown estate, which is technically owned by them.

They also contribute a fuck ton more to the country than they cost. The attraction of having a functional royal family in the UK adds hugely to tourism."
unitedkingdom,fdn3vh1,t1_fdn0dy2,1578576518.0,"This is correct, the civil list (where each royal got money for services to the state) was abolished in 2011.

Now the Queen gets a proportion of the income from the Crown Estate (the monarchs public estate) estate to live off of and provide to the rest of the Royal family. This is supplemented by the Duchies or Lancaster and Cornwall but they're privately held estates unlike the Crown Estate (which George III gave to the government in exchange for a proportion of its income as hereditary income, to settle his debts and transfer responsibility for his security from himself to the government)."

The reason they can't do it themselves is because hospitals have been closing/downsizing in reaction to funding cuts and staff shortages (which are another symptom of funding cuts).

This will go on and on until the Health Secretary says something like 'private companies are doing nearly all of the NHS work anyway, why not just convert the NHS into a single payer insurance company and do away with all these public hospitals that are clearly unable to provide services' and then suddenly healthcare is a profitable industry and costs go up for everyone and the private companies make millions
