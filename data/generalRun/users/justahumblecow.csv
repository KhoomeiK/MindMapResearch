Side note: I would be very thankful for that gap. I had two chihuahuas growing up and we lived next to an empty field that at one point had prairie dogs, and a couple times a prairie dog got in yard and never got out. Trust me, you do not want to see your dog joyfully eviscerating a tiny woodland creature. It is not a pleasant sight."
IBEW,ffdhvzs,t1_ffdblvk,1579821209.0,"Here's my plug for 5.11



I got bit by a dog on the job once. Usually when a dog bites, it's a warning nip ""hey get away from me"" or ""I'm scared, back off"" kinda thing. Not this dog. This dog was out for blood and left a nasty bruise, it actually gave me a cut *through* my 5.11 pants and socks. Didn't tear the pants tho.


I feel that if I was wearing different pants, that dog would have taken a chunk out of my leg. It was a tiny poodle looking thing btw"

I recently read an article about a man who had to have his arm amputated and wanted the bones to be skeletonized, and it took him a WHILE to find a taxidermist willing to work with his arm."

When he got old he got white fur around his muzzle and eyes"
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fezsfkc,t3_eqwdby,1579461057.0,"Adora's whole story gives me trans vibes tbh.


She lives in this box of others' expectations in the horde and then she finds herself. the way that Shadow Weaver and Catra refer to her ""whole princess thing"" as a ""phase"". The way that her new friends only want the New Adora and her old friends only want the Old Adora. The way that she describes the familiarity of the princess stuff.
