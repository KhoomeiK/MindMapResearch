Edit: ok, getting to 100 was quite a bit of fun and is an appropriate level of difficulty. It seems very clear NK nerfed the original submission \*way\* too hard. It's not super tight---they might have added lives and cash in addition to drastically lowering the final level. In any case, props to the submitter, the underlying idea is very clever.

For what it's worth, at R100 I had 502 (top middle), 205, 5x 204's buffing the 502 and 205, a 052, and Benjamin. Everybody with vengeance had it up. Got 052 (camos), then 502 (DDT's), then 205 (melting everything else).

Further edit: ok, this is just another clustertruck of an AC. They added camo regrow modifiers that weren't there before. Sounds pretty tedious with a rather obvious solution. The original to round 100 required using all druid paths in complementary ways. It's a shame that wasn't just the AC to begin with."

There were three independent adults in my group and the host only had one key. I asked for more keys at check-in and suggested they should make some copies. The host agreed and asked if I could do it and they'll reimburse me at checkout. I stupidly say yes since I wanted to explore the city anyway and had some free time.

At checkout, we have international flights, but the host is late. After 15 minutes we get anxious and call our Uber. I let the host know we left the key and copies in the place and locked up and that we can handle reimbursement electronically. A while later I get an angry message saying they can't get in--this is when I found out they had literally given me their only key to their place and didn't have a copy for themselves. A while after that they message me saying their boyfriend was able to climb in a window and open up, as if I should be grateful instead of concerned since I just slept there for a week. I ask about reimbursement and get ghosted.

They gave me 5-stars. I gave them 1-star. In my review I said it would have been 3-4 stars if they hadn't stiffed me on the keys. Honestly they just seemed stupid and lazy. I figured a genuine bad review was enough ""punishment"" and let it drop."

What you seem to want is just not reasonable. You got me curious, so I went through and counted roughly 14 MK which were directly useful for this challenge. Some are only slightly useful, like increased hero XP, while others seem essential, like 200 starting cash. Which collection of these 14 any given player with a middling amount of MK has will inevitably be highly variable. Which of these combinations is enough is similarly going to vary enormously, and figuring out the limits would require a ridiculous amount of individual testing--2^14 ~= 16000 configurations at the start.

For any given player struggling, they'd need to say what useful MK they have and people would have to suggest what MK might be enough to make it passable, but it would just be a guess. For that matter, good micro (like using Pat's roar) can make up for some missing MK, but it's often extremely difficult to communicate such micro in text. I did go through this process with another person in this thread and they said they beat it.

Maybe you wanted a ranked list of all the useful MK's for this challenge? I did only vaguely mention some highlights of what's useful. Even listing what I did is more detail than is common practice around here. If you had directly asked for such a list someone probably would have taken the time to write it out."

Not everyone puts everything on the arXiv, especially in unusual cases like conference volumes, or books/chapters, so I certainly get things from the publisher too.

Even if everything was on the arXiv, journals would still play a super important role since peer review is vital in maintaining quality. The arXiv has no peer review.

Minor rant incoming. As a professor I get really tired of this type of complaint. You can absolutely spoon feed some people information, but if they don't have a super easy time of it the first thing they blame is the instruction. God forbid it's ever the user's fault. Annoyingly, there's usually no mechanism to push back against such low quality opinions. For that matter, what one person finds vague another person finds to-the-point and memorable; what one person finds clear another finds pointlessly verbose.

That said, you got me to look it up, and it seems the BSA has potentially made a little movement on this in the last few years. They have an agreement with the Unitarian Universalist church (which does not at all require belief in God) to sponsor troops. However, the BSA nonetheless requires repeated declarations of belief in God for acceptance and advancement, and they have officials publicly reinforcing this stance. I'm not sure if I'm actual practice they just let UU troops ignore such requirements. It seems muddy at best."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fdsw7p0,t3_emu8x4,1578708741.0,"I'm a professor. A couple of years ago I went through a surge of generalized anxiety with panic attacks. I got help for it and am much better now, but it took a long while to work through. Some of the literal worst minutes of my life were the two times when I had a panic attack while lecturing.

Two of my more prominent anxiety triggers were feeling trapped in an activity I didn't want to be in and being aware of my physical body. Also, my behavior is often repetitive, so if I establish a pattern of doing something in a situation, I'll likely continue. An anxiety attack while lecturing was something of a perfect storm for me. I felt very strong pressure not to establish a pattern of stopping class and leaving, but that fed my feeling of being trapped, which ramped up the usual pounding heart and adrenaline rush, which reinforced itself. And to top it all off, the material wasn't even interesting to me, so I couldn't effectively use it as a distraction.

Both times I continued lecturing at a measured pace in as even a tone as I could manage while most of my mind was completely freaking out. I'm good at multitasking, I have solid control of my physical expressions of emotion (thanks in part to being in the closet for years, separate story), and I have a lot of willpower, so I managed, but barely. At many points I was just on the edge of telling the class I needed to step out to the bathroom, but I didn't. I still remember looking at the clock with 10 minutes left and wondering if I could make it. As far as I could tell the classes didn't know what was up, e.g. nobody ever mentioned it to me, either at the time or later (e.g. in office hours or course evaluations).

If it had become a recurring problem I simply couldn't have continued teaching. Panic attacks are in general some of the worst experiences of my life, and they were turned up to 11 during lecture. I dearly hope it never happens again, but I'm in a much healthier place mentally and I have a lot of treatment options if it does ever come back. The experience gave me a lot more empathy with students going through mental health issues."

btd6,fdpya9d,t3_emnuxu,1578645732.0,"Sad, the AC is a recent duplicate. I really want NK to figure out how to monetize AC's to support the release of higher quality ones.

I've spent $0 on microtransactions for this game in over a year. If double cash were $5, say, I'd get it simply to support development even though I'd never use it, like I never use my huge cache of instas. I just only care about high quality gameplay and find most of the game to be very easy, so there's nothing for me to spend money on. Interesting AC's are the only thing that keeps me playing, but they're frequently disappointing.
