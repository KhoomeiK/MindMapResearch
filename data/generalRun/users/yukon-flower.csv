>But placebos are not all about releasing brainpower. You also need the ritual of treatment. ""When you look at these studies that compare drugs with placebos, there is the entire environmental and ritual factor at work,"" says Kaptchuk. ""You have to go to a clinic at certain times and be examined by medical professionals in white coats. You receive all kinds of exotic pills and undergo strange procedures.

todayilearned,ffcz6q2,t1_ffclcwr,1579810280.0,"The placebo effect is a part of medicine.  It's the part where the patient feels like someone is listening to their concerns and validating their experiences.  See this Harvard article:  [https://www.health.harvard.edu/mental-health/the-power-of-the-placebo-effect](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mental-health/the-power-of-the-placebo-effect) 

It's all those things that are missing from the US's medical system where you meet with a doctor you don't (or barely) know, who sees you late and for a rushed 7 minutes, doesn't really care about anything else except the most acute symptoms you mention and some basic biometric stats, etc.

So the fact that the placebo is so effective means that the rest of the process of medicine is failing.

And, yes, women tend to find solace in placebo-y things more than men. But women's pain and other symptoms are famously ignored compared to those of men, and in general women's concerns are scoffed at and made to seem unimportant to society.  So to me it's no wonder that women are able to get benefit from placebo-y things.

**important:** I am not suggesting placebo stuff (i.e., snake oil stuff like homeopathy) be a *replacement* to science-based medicine, and anything serious should *always* be treated by a licensed medical professional. Rather, I am saying that the manner of care given by most medical professionals is lacking."

Here is an  article that goes into some more of the ""fun"" of scurvy:  [https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2015/08/scurvy\_is\_much\_worse\_than\_you\_think.html](https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2015/08/scurvy_is_much_worse_than_you_think.html) 

BUT!  An excess of vitamin C doesn't really do you any good.  You just piss it out (which also means yet one more thing for your kidneys to process).  And more importantly, the vitamins that are fat soluble are seriously dangerous if you consume too much.  If you are eating normal foods and living in an industrialized country, you probably do not have to worry about your vitamin levels at all, with the possible exception of vitamin D.

Another really exciting thing is just how extremely recently we learned about many of the vitamins.  Like just a few decades ago, for some of them!

The book also describes some food components other than vitamins, like certain essential minerals.  I don't remember enough to talk about it, but I'm sure you can find some excerpts of the book online to learn the entertaining science."
explainlikeimfive,ff69tnz,t3_ertxg6,1579622482.0,"A few years ago, a surprisingly entertaining book came out called [Vitamania](http://www.catherine-price.com/home1) that talks through what all the different vitamins do, including when you don't have enough of them and when you have too much of them.  Each one operates a bit differently.  A lack of vitamin C, for example, will cause scurvy, which is kind of common knowledge.  What isn't common knowledge is that  scurvy is horrific, causing (among other things) every wound that you have ever had to re-open in your skin.  When you have wounds that heal, the skin does not repair itself to create the same former skin structure but is instead essentially stitched together with stuff that needs vitamin C to remain operational.  Deprive yourself of vitamin C, and all the stitchings come undone."

There are some US parallels to these payments, like how you can pay a small fee to renew your passport within several weeks, and a larger fee to renew it within several days.  Is the larger payment a bribe?  Probably not, because it is a published, regular payment that goes to the fisc and not to the pocket of whomever happens to agree to speed up your application.

Even if he might seem clueless or every once in a blue moon may seem actually 3% charming or whatever.  He's a jerk for ignoring your wishes to be left alone, he's a dick for disrespecting you, he's a perv for making you uncomfortable.  If he actually cared about you as a person, he would be aware that you don't want his attention.

He is probably emotionally stunted.  Treat him as such.  The most success I've gotten is by treating these people the way I would treat a 10-year-old boy.  Someone old enough to be able to express desires perhaps even in a somewhat clever way, but completely lacking the maturity to know whether their desires are appropriate.  A 10-year-old boy asking you for money to buy ice cream gets a ""no"" and then you can just ignore him, right?

You do not owe it to be polite to this person. He's not being polite to you. You do not need to be nice, to worry about his feelings, to care about his patronage of your store or whatever the situation is. That's putting a price on your personal comfort, sanity, and safety.

Here is the first BMR calculator that came up in my search.  I can't vouch for it per se but it should give you a general idea:  [https://www.active.com/fitness/calculators/bmr](https://www.active.com/fitness/calculators/bmr)  Here is one that lets you note whether you do any regular exercise:  [https://www.calculators.org/health/bmr.php](https://www.calculators.org/health/bmr.php)"
