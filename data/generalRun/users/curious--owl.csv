Fetuses. Can’t. Make. Choices. 92% of abortions happen before 13 weeks gestation, meaning the aborted fetus has no brain, heart, or nervous system. It’s basically a jellyfish. Sure, it can respond to stimuli, but you know what else responds to stimuli? Sunflowers. They sure as hell can’t “decide” if they want to be born or not, whereas a living, (hopefully) adult woman *can*.

92% of abortions happen before 13 weeks though, so not really relevant here. 

And yeah, you are trying to punish women. You can’t have it both ways. Either you recognize the rights of born, living women and their right to reproduce when they choose to, or you arbitrarily give a fetus rights and strip away the humanity and autonomy of the woman. 

And to reduce it down to a matter of “convenience” is insanely insulting. Having a baby is *life-changing*. Being pregnant *changes everything*. Buying maternity clothes *alone* is more than what a lot of women can afford. Maternity clothes, baby clothes, doctor’s appointments, co-pays, moving into a bigger house, strollers, cribs, having to take time off work for doctor’s appointments and maternity leave, and then birth? Do you know how much it costs to give birth in a hospital? It’s *absurd* how expensive it is even with insurance. 

It’s not “having a baby is inconvenient so I’m just going to kill it,” it’s “I’m not even remotely equipped or financially ready to have a baby, in fact having a baby could potentially bankrupt me, so I need to end this pregnancy and maybe I’ll have a baby when I’m ready.” 

How about we look at it for what it really is. You want to *literally enslave women* because you think a fetus is more valuable or more human than an actual human woman."
