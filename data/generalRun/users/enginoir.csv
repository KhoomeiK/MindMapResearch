MechanicalKeyboards,fffjxmu,t3_et8dpt,1579885570.0,"Looking for a HHKB Pro 2 for parts?

Really I just need a bottom case, in black preferably. Any ideas on where I can get one? Nothing on ebay and I know PFU doesn't supply parts for their boards and it seems like a waste to buy a brand new HHKB just for the bottom half.

I also know there might have been some projects for aftermarket ones but I wasn't able to find any available for purchase."

Once it's been cured, epoxy is generally considered food safe, but if the crack is in an area where you're heating it, the fumes are toxic so if that's the case, it's best to retire the pipe as a decoration or paperweight and buy a new one."

GrandCherokee,fdcqo0n,t1_fdck358,1578281634.0,"Install is pretty straightforward.  The mounting kit is a perfect install and only takes a few minutes if that.  

Switches can be mounted anywhere you want.  I'm not sure what switch WildCountry includes in their kit, but I'd recommend getting [something like this](https://www.amazon.com/CH4X4-Rocker-Switch-Cherokee-Bumper/dp/B01I5UUVUK) which should fit into your instrument cluster and look close to factory."
GrandCherokee,fdbgn2a,t3_ekehza,1578257157.0,"Lightbars and boxes can look kind of cool and tactical on more rugged SUVs, but not really a fan of it on this model personally.  It's too clean and sleek.  I would prolly even remove the roof rails all together on this one.  

If you need exterior storage, I'd maybe go with a [hitch-mount cargo carrier](https://www.amazon.com/CURT-18153-Basket-Style-Cargo-Carrier/dp/B00JF5LRN0), and if you need more light, I think a [bumper LED bar](https://www.roughcountry.com/jeep-20in-led-bumper-kit-70772c.html) might be pretty stealth and nice.  That's just me--I love the stock look, but it's still a very beautiful car and I'm very jealous!"
woodworking,fczfywp,t3_ejdgpp,1578100402.0,"While this definitely looks fantastic, I hate to say it but wine should not be stored like this.  

The three properties that affect wine the most while storing are **temperature**, **light** and **humidity**.  This space doesn't seem to address any of them, so while it looks great, you may want to recommend some slight modifications if they are concerned with long term quality, which they likely are if they are spending that much on wine and paying for this kind of set up.  

I would consider suggesting the following modifications:  (1) add breather holes between the cells so that the air and temperature helps remain constant (2) add a humidifier inside one of the cells set to ideally around 70-80% (3) add a custom door with UV glass/acrylic to help seal in the moisture and block out light.  You could easily make this hinge out along the stairs and look pretty cool.

Temperature is going to be more tricky, since it depends on conditions, but it's one of the most important properties of the 3.  If they have a basement that remains cooler, you could add a port with a fan and a temperature controller to pull in cool air when needed.  If you don't have access to this, you would need to add some type of heat pump.  Depending on what they like to drink usually you want a temperature of upper 50's to low 60's.  They might not need this if they like a cold place, but generally this is cooler than comfortable for most people 

Anyway just some thoughts, but great work."
