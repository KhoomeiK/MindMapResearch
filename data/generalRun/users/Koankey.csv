creepy,ffb4slh,t1_ffavm47,1579751795.0,"People will look back on humans actually having to carry a baby inside them in horror. Why do that when you can have little Johnny 5.0 grown in a fetal nursery near you! And yes, future people will have numbers in their name. I already have a silent 7 in mine, but my parents were ahead of the curve. And by ahead of the curve, I mean on lots of psychedelic drugs."

AskReddit,fe6ppll,t3_enzs4x,1578899651.0,"Imagine a dream where you ""wake up"" in your bedroom and then someone starts pounding on your door, your heart starts beating a mile a minute, you see the door knob twist open and it's your mother. She's drunk as all hell but you know your mother doesn't drink like that. Her eyes make contact with yours and she starts grinning. As the grin widens to an unnatural state you realize it isn't your mother but some sort of demon. You try to move or scream for help but you can't do either. Eventually your heart beats so fast that you actually wake up. Now hope when you fall back asleep it doesn't happen again. 



Most of my night terrors start from a sleep paralysis state so I'm aware that I'm dreaming and can dismiss whatever terrible thing I'm presented with but not always. I stay away from scotch whiskey, strong cheese before bed, too much sugar before bed, cayenne and definitely no Ambien ;)"

AskReddit,fe6omkw,t1_fe6kxwr,1578898346.0,"We're a remarkable species. Our ability to create languages, writing systems. We're the only species aware of our existence and our inevitable be death. We preserve species and rebuild forests. We've created medicines from plants and molds to help others suffer less. We found a way to write out music and play fantastically complex sounds using instruments we thought up.

There's a lot more life left to be had, find a bigger purpose than watching YouTube videos. Things change.
