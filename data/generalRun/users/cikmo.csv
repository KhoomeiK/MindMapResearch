I hope other VPNs follow suit. Though if you want privacy I’d go with tor instead (which isn’t really safe either if you access non onion websites. VPNs are really only useful for accessing blocked websites and watching netflix content not available in your country etc."

memes,fe16o5k,t1_fe0s0qk,1578823077.0,"Because people find it better looking than being completely white. 

Diving in on the sociology of it though; 
In Medieval times it was considered fashionable and attractive to be extremely pale, as most poorer people worked outside on farms in the sun and got very tanned, whereas rich people stayed inside not working and got pale. In modern times this has flipped around, and now having a tan shows that you have plenty of spare time for leisure.

It’s also considered to be a more healthy look. If someone is pale and colorless it indicates sickness."

They use existing bomb plans so they can make many bombs relatively fast. Having to develop and design an entirely new bomb every time would be very time consuming and hard.

Trying to remove explosives would make the bomb explode, at least if the producer is somewhat good at their job. Also to make movies more exciting."

It’s also for self driving car technology, and probably a bunch of other stuff.

Basically, the images they show are often of objects the AI isn’t completely sure of. Like ""there’s a 60% chance this is a bike, but I don’t know"". You the user then verifies whether it is a bike or not. 

I pretty often get a “check all the boxes of the traffic light, but there aren’t any traffic lights there. In that case you just click the skip button, and the AI is a little bit smarter.  (Traffic lights are often used because it’s very important for autonomous driving)."
