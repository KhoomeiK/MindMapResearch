lyftdrivers,ffc98wy,t1_ffbipr6,1579794441.0,"True it's just one guys opinion. Though it still doesn't leave the realm of anecdote, I used to hear this opinion all the time (ride share not being a tipped job). Supposedly lyft and/or uber tried to advertise their rideshare as tips not being necessary. I don't know if this is true or urban legend. I'm pretty sure it is a widespread belief (though I could be wrong), and honestly I didn't realize how wrong this was until I started driving myself."

todayilearned,fep3vas,t1_fep126b,1579311545.0,"Yeah I read that elsewhere in this thread after writing that comment. I had no idea! I still have my doubts though, I don't know how you could come away from extensive repeated psychological abuse under the influence of LSD unscathed. My one personal experience with LSD ""for fun"" affected me for months, and I would not be surprised if there were some minor permanent effects either."
todayilearned,fenw7w7,t1_fen2utu,1579291745.0,"I wish your comment wasn't buried so deeply. When you read about what Henry Murray did to him in college--essentially give him LSD and verbally/psychologically abuse him in a ""study""--it kind of makes sense why he became the unabomber."

AskReddit,fegk0qp,t3_eou6il,1579095102.0,"To live forever. Ever since I read Anne Rice as a kid, I've loved the idea of living forever. But I don't want to have to drink blood or, like, have a damned soul. If someone chops my head off and there just happens to be an afterlife, I'd like to still be ""admitted"" or whatever."

lyftdrivers,fdrbz7t,t1_fdram1l,1578682340.0,"Nice, congrats! I'm only doing it now so I have a car to help with my other jobs. I just have to keep remembering that: lyft is a part time job that gives me access to a car, not extra income. Not super awesome, but it does make my life easier in some ways. I met a guy recently trying to make a living off the express drive, he has to drive 70+ hours a week, and that was when usage was up! I can't imagine how miserable he is now. :("

printSF,fd6ee5z,t3_ejzcvl,1578189702.0,"Someone already mentioned, but the tetralogy The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe takes place toward the end of our sun, not the universe. You definitely get that whole ""end of things"" vibe, with a weakening sun, and the hint of an ancient possibly billions years old civilization that rose to the heights of interstellar travel and then fell."

lyftdrivers,fcskv53,t1_fcqtmlt,1577918643.0,">Drivers have ALL the power in this industry and yet we dont wield it because were individuals.

That's funny, I was just thinking this morning how drivers have so little power/control over any of this shit. I agree with the second half of your sentence, it's because we're acting as individuals that we lack power. If we acted collectively and unionized, maybe then we could have some power. Even just organizing one market seems daunting, but if you could successfully get a large number of drivers to go on strike, it might hurt lyft's profits just enough to listen."
