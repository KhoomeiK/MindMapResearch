I only see stop work orders posted to tear down/rebuilds.

No one cares because no one pulls permits for this type of stuff, just do it to code, which is what all contractors will do.

I mean neglect all building/construction permits. I don't know what you mean by those other things. In general all work is done to code, we just don't get a permit to do the work from the city unless you want a delay or the cost to go up by 10k."

bourbon,ffwk52d,t1_ffvm0qq,1580303593.0,The issue is so much contact with the wood. You'd want to speed up the actual aging to match the wood contact time.
bourbon,ffwk1zw,t3_evfooz,1580303522.0,That will be over oaked in about 4 months but the tails won't be properly aged. Transfer to a sealed container and age like 3 years more after that.

roasting,fftkoya,t3_ev5s0c,1580223046.0,It's a decent stepping stone between something basic like an air popper or skillet and the higher-end things like a Huky. I was happy with mine for like 3 years.
