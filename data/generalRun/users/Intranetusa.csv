No, Arabs are the most similar in terms of size and scope, but even then, it's not quite the same process. The Arabs were supplanted by the Persians by the time of the Abbasids and later became decentralized and scattered rather than becoming heavily centralized. It's not quite the same centralized state-backed assimilation process where people were assimilated a point where people speaking different languages consider themselves a single ethnicity.

The rest are really not the same at all and not really close in scope. The Bengalis for much of history and in modern times occupy a small chunk of territory in the eastern part of India. They briefly expanded to a larger empire and conquered northern India, but this was short lived and they returned to a smaller territory with fewer people. The Han equivalent of this would be if the Bengalis hypothetically conquered most/all of India and assimilated many other ethnic groups in India into becoming Bengalis for thousands of years.

Punjabis - similar situation as the Bengalis.

The Russians as an ethnic group is limited to primarily people of Eastern European Slavic descent. Don't confuse this with the Russian nationality as a whole, which includes numerous ethnic groups through the large territory of Russia. The natives of places like Siberia or the Russian Far East and the many other ethnic groups of Russia are not lumped under the Russian ethnic group. Other differences include the Russians are unified by one language, and their expansion happened relatively late in history so there isn't quite enough time to assimilate completely disparate groups to the same extent.

>Sounds like they need to aim higher, then. Here are the Arabs' distributions, for example. Kinda blows that whole ""Spain to Greece"" example right out of the water, doesn't it? https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Arabic_Dialects.svg/1280px-Arabic_Dialects.svg.png

First, you're confusing language with ethnicity. Just because they speak some variant of Arabic does not mean they consider themselves ethnically Arab. Countries like Ethiopia and Sudan have many Arab speakers, but most of their population and many/most of those Arab speakers don't actually consider themselves ethnically Arab. Just like a lot of countries speak English, but most people in most English speaking countries don't consider themselves ethnically British.

Look at the countries with Arab populations - people who actually identify as Arab. Most people in many countries with Arab as a major language in your language map don't actually identify as ethnically Arab: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs

Second, I'm not talking about ""Chinese people"" or ""Chinese languages"" here. I'm talking about a narrower restriction: a single ethnic group - the Han.
I'm exclusively talking about boundaries of the Han ethnicity, which actually leaves out the majority of modern China's territory in much of Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Manchuria, and Xinjiang. 

If I were to talk about China in general, distributions of the various Chinese languages, distributions of languages spoken by the Han, or the pan-Chinese identity, then the geographic size would be significantly larger than what I was talking about earlier. That would be roughly similar to the entire continent of Europe and much of the entire Arab world. Comparably speaking, the Han ethnicity is more artificial as the centralized states managed to convince people speaking many totally different languages that they're all Han."

It's not strictly racism because nobody has any real definition of what race actually is nowadays and race as most people know it is considered by scientists to be a social construct. But this type of claim today falls under similar types of prejudicial stereotyping and overgeneralizing that classic racism did when people were classified into a few over-simplistic categories during the 1800s. 

>When you make it about race, you're actually derailing the conversation from meaningful criticisms.

Meaningful criticism doesn't equate to making up facts and generalizing about large groups of people from small sample sizes. We can talk about rude behavior of a bunch of Chinese tourists and arrogant rich overseas mainland Chinese who flaunt their ill gotten wealth. But using personal anecdotal evidences about a few hundred or a few thousand Chinese tourists to generalize about hundred(s) of millions of other Chinese tourists without providing actual meaningful data or statistics is not meaningful criticism. 

>There is behavior exhibited by the Chinese government 

Their government actually has laws punishing these rude tourists for their behavior and banning them from future travel. So clearly their own government and the majority of their people doesn't even find this behavior acceptable. 

We can talk about how terrible the Chinese government is, and their government is indeed terrible, but they're not condoning rude tourist behavior either.

>People pick up patterns, you can call it stereotyping, sure, but when you see patterns of behavior in extremely high numbers coming from a single country, you extrapolate that more of thier culture is like that.

And how do we actually know there is extremely high numbers coming from a single country? How many of these tourists are rude? 5 million? 10 million? There is something like well over a hundred million or more tourists coming from that country. If 10 million of them are rude, that's like less than 10%. Is that an extremely high number of rude people in terms of actual percentage? 

There was the stereotype of the ignorant loud American tourist for the longest time, but it was basically nonsense in terms of actual statistics/data because Americans just happened to be the largest source of tourists in the world for decades so both the good and bad tourists were all overwhelmingly Americans and bad experiences are more memorable. How do we know that isn't the case here?

If you want to claim most of these people have bad behavior then you need some data/statistics to suggest it rather than some anecdotal evidence about a few hundred or few thousand tourists around the world.

>Nobody gives a shit what color thier skin is, nobody cares what thier physical appearance is, or their genetic makeup. That would be racism.

Arabs, Iranians, etc aren't races either. Yet many stereotypes and discrimination against them falls under the supposedly non-racial justification of them being disproportionately Muslim. Black is skin color and African is a geographic designation, not a race. Yet discrimination against them falls under the supposedly non-racial justification about crime rates. Hispanics and Spanish speakers aren't a race either. Yet discrimination against them falls under the supposedly non-racial issue of integration and immigration. Discrimination against East Asians as a whole falls under the supposed non-racial reason of assimilation and cultural issues.

We can list these as non-racial issues, and to an extent they are indeed not racial. However, it gets suspicious when this pattern of justifications is so often repeated for all of these minority groups that look physically different from the dominant group of people in these countries. Do we consider Protestant or Mormon fundamentalism or high rape/pedophilia among religious Amish communities a big concern? Does high crime rates among Appalachia and among the rust belt with people of European descent get the same type of coverage? Does a person who look a certain way speaking French get the same reaction as a different person speaking Spanish? I don't think we can ignore the role physical appearance does actually play in these issues even though there are components not exclusively about physical appearance. If you look a certain way physically, you are far more likely to get stereotyped.

None of those groups are actually races, yet prejudice and discrimination, and stereotyping against them are all classified under racism nowadays because the term racism has thus expanded its definition to include more broader forms of stereotyping and discrimination. The definition of race as we know it has traditionally been a made up concept that nobody can properly define anyways."

The fact is half or the majority of mainland Chinese are very poor and still live in poverty as small farmers in some random rural farm somewhere in China. The rude tourists you met are people who have money to travel, and the people who flaunt laws and buy up shit are probably rich and spoiled mainland Chinese who probably got their wealth from their parents' corrupt ties in the government.

The government becomes a revolving door to the private sector in a lot of cases. Lucrative contracts are awarded to a certain private company and/or the government shows unfair leniency or favoritism towards a private company. Then the government folks responsible for such behaviors have an opportunity to join that private company at a high level position in the future. We see it all the time in every administration.

HistoriansAnswered,fgj7d7b,t3_eydbjj,1580838392.0,"This is a tricky question. First, you have to realize that the Romans pretty much adopted many of their equipment from other cultures and peoples.  During the early Republic, Roman hoplite equipment (helmet, spear, shield, etc) was adopted from the Greeks. For the manipular reformed armies, the Romans adopted their helmet from the Celts and their swords from the Celt-Iberian tribes (gladius Hispania). They adopted their common riveted chainmail armor (lorica hamata) from the Celts as well. Scale armor (lorica squamata) was probably adopted from the Middle East or Greco-Persians or North Africans. Lamellar armor was adopted during the mid-late empire from Western Asia/Middle East.

Furthermore, while armor such as lorica segmentata (banded plates) may have been a native invention we have no idea whether this was much better than other armors or not. This is because 1) the Romans only used it for 2-3 centuries before abandoning it and 2) there are some books (eg. The Dacian Threat) that say there were a bunch of problems with it, and Trajan had to reequip his troops wearing lorica segmentata with chainmail and scalemail and 3) there are modern comparisons that state some advantages but also a lot of disadvantages with segmentata compared to chainmail and scalemail.

So we can't really answer your question because the Romans adopted most of their stuff from other people, and we don't really know if the armor they used was actually better than their rivals and neighbors."

The Han armies during the Western Han era and for much of the early Eastern Han were very well trained - the militia troops were trained for a year and served a year on duty. This would supplement professional and semi-professionals. By comparison, the Romans were given a ~4 month training/bootcamp according to Vegetius in De Re Militari.

>It’s not as good as a Eurasian laminated compound bow used by mounted horse archers. 

It's actually about the same or better because the Han used Eurasian laminated compound bows for the bow part of the crossbow. Because they didn't have to worry about draw weight, they could make the composite bow portion exceptionally thick and/or with different materials to make it strong and be able to generate a large amount of draw weight.

>The bolt was lighter than an arrow and started losing velocity quickly. 

No, that really depends on the arrow and the bolt. The Han bolts were almost as large as regular arrows due to the long powerstrokes of the crossbows. There were heavier armor penetrating bolts and arrows for both crossbows and bows."

Land ownership was a requirement to joining the military, and this requirement was gradually reduced more and more that it basically became a token requirement by the time of the mid-late Republic. The majority of people were poorer peasantry with their family owning a small plot of land. When the Republic had army organization based on wealth, the poorer soldiers who couldn't afford much equipment were relegated to reserve and skirmisher roles (eg. velites, rorarii, etc). Slightly better off soldiers who couldn't really afford much armor but could afford a shield and sword could be relegated to the first line as hastati. Richer, older troops who could afford better equipment were relegated to the second line - principes. The richest (and usually the oldest) infantry were the triarii, whereas the absolute richest served as cavalry. 

Later on, army organization became based on experience on only indirectly based on wealth. The youngest/least experienced served as velites, rorarii, hastati, etc (and because they were young, they were usually poorer). Experience soldiers served as principes (and because they were older, they could usually afford better equipment). The grizzled veterans (and usually richest) were the triarii.

In reality, the primary pictoral depictions of segmentata comes from the famous propaganda piece Trajan's Column. This is acknowledged by historians to be stereotyped and very inaccurate (Trajan's column also depicts tiny undersized scutums). More accurate battle reliefs of Trajan's conquests in Dacia actually portrays the Roman legions wearing hamata chainmail and squamata scales rather than segmentata.
