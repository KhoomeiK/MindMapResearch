I have asked him to spend time with me doing mundane shit. I’ve asked that he dry the dishes while I wash them so we can work together to accomplish goals. He just plays WOW instead, then says “I don’t expect you to help me change  oil or drop a transmission.” In his mind, he does outside work and I do inside work, so to ask him to hang out while folding the laundry goes too far if it takes him away from his computer. 

We used to go bike riding together, we used to go kayaking together, we used to be very fit and active together.

It just goes to waste bc he won’t eat leftovers and I’m not allowed to do a leftovers for dinner night. My 8 year old son eats more than him most days. My husband’s diet consists of: drinking coffee from when he wakes up until dinner. He never makes himself breakfast or lunch. If I make lunch or dinner, he’ll eat about half the plate or bowl and says it’s because he doesn’t like something about what I make (he doesn’t like too much carbs, beans make him gassy, etc) he’s pretty much unintentionally keto/OMAD, then says it’s my fault he doesn’t put on weight. Then he goes to the gas station at night and binges in candy. 

God I hate his eating habits. And he’s 6’3, 170 with a six pack he acts like he works so hard for. It’s easy for your muscles to show if you don’t have body fat.
