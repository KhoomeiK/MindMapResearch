You sound a bit like me when I was in HS. What I did was join clubs I was interested in (which was theatre and improv) and those brought me out of my shell a bit, and met some cool people."
Advice,fezo8fr,t3_er021r,1579459595.0,"What I do is try to never rely on others for things... Especially paying. If I can’t afford to pay for myself, I’m not leaving my home. And I tell the other person that. Ehhh I don’t like when others pay for me in general (because of the possibility of situations like this occurring). What you should do is tell him everything you’ve told us (besides the he said part) and try to be more cautious about traveling and food and let him know about that? I hope you guys are able to figure things out? :) And try to do free stuff together! Get creative! You guys may have to pay to see each other, b he choose free activities to do together. Like cooking together? If either of you guys have access to a kitchen. That could be fun?
