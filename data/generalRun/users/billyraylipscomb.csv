That's not entirely accurate.  About 20-25% of people in the US with HIV are women, and 86% of those got it from heterosexual intercourse ( [https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/women/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/women/index.html) ).  The 1 in 1000 encounters is likely the probability that any random person would get it during any random encounter.  However, I would guess the probability would be much lower for heterosexual men and higher for heterosexual women because, all things being equal, the ""receiver"" is at higher risk than the ""inserter"" (even more so in anal sex).  


Yes, Africa's high infection rates are attributable to poor healthcare which is the root problem of the other STIs you mentioned as well.  However, according to the CDC, it is likely that 1/9 women who have HIV and don't even know it based on behavioral studies.  In general, women are much better about getting health check ups than men are, so I would think the odds of a man having HIV and not knowing it is far higher.  Since the data is saying that those who are untreated spread it to 6 people, I think that is entirely possible (if not entirely likely) because you have to assume that the vast majority of people who are not treated don't know they have it."

If you require a signature they could just hide from delivery or just not sign for it at all and say they didn't receive it.  According to US law and/or precedent, an item in your mailbox is in your possession, and you therefore received it.  That's why collections notices and bills are sent by regular mail unless you affirmatively consent to receive notices electronically.  


Edited: mail getting put in the wrong box or getting lost or marked as delivered doesn't really matter.  What matters is evidence something was delivered, and an extension of the state saying it was delivered."

As someone else suggested, you should follow Dave Ramsey on social media and read some of his books.  My wife and I attended a Dave Ramsey class at our church for free, and though I am a finance professional, it was good for my wife and I to attend that together.  I also recommend reading Rich Dad, Poor Dad.    


Now is the part you won't like to hear but it needs to be said.  I won't be as harsh as some others, but owning a home is a big responsibility that has very large expenses you might not be ready for until you radically alter the way your household manages money.  Unless you buy a brand new house with everything under warranty, it's $500 for a new dishwasher.  $3-5000 for a new AC unit.  $10-20k for a new roof, etc.  Until you can save $20k more than you need for a 3.5% down payment, I don't think home ownership is a great idea.  You could not afford a major expense, and you do not have the credit to get a loan for it.  You do not want to live in a house with a broken AC in the summer with a newborn."

personalfinance,fcxn9jc,t3_ej99nh,1578066988.0,"Pay yourself first, but don't do anything too crazy.  Then, pay your relatives/friends.  Then your creditors.  To begin, pay off all of your bills/utilities that are in collections.  Then, pay off card lender C&D.  Accept settlement offer(s) from Lender B.  Then, pay off Lender A.  Do so as quickly as possible because the bad events must drop off your credit report after 7 years from the date they were last REPORTED.  The sooner you get those to zero the sooner you will have them drop off your credit report as they will no longer report.   


Unfortunately, it is unlikely that you will be able to buy a house in the next year with the state of your credit/income situation.  However, you might be able to in the next two years.  After you have paid all of your debts, get a secured credit card cosigned with your husband.  Most credit unions offer these.  You essentially put an amount on deposit to secure the card (which also acts as your limit), and use it as you would a normal credit card (be good with it this time by paying down the balance to zero every month).  Do this with multiple credit unions/banks in your area so that you can start showing GOOD trade lines on your credit report.  Do the minimum deposit they will allow if you have multiple options.  After a year, check your credit score to see if you might qualify for an unsecured card.  If not, that's ok, close the ones you have and open new ones.  Again, you are trying to build the number of GOOD trade lines on your credit report, so the more the merrier.

Once you and your husbands credit scores are over 580, you can qualify for an FHA loan (assuming all of your bad debts have been resolved, and for over a year I think).  With an FHA loan, you will only need 3.5% down payment and you can buy a house.  I would take the generosity of your in-laws and stay rent free for as long as you can until you can build up a new cash savings (see: pay your relatives second).  


I worked for several years at banks/credit unions in credit/loans.  I have seen thousands of credit reports and understand how to game the credit scoring model.  The only way to repair your credit score at this point is with multiple good credit lines on your credit report, and time.  Unfortunately, it does take 7 years for the negative credit lines to drop off your report, and it will greatly negatively affect your score until that time.  I have seen someone with great credit get dropped from a 780 to a 650 over a $25 medical bill they were unaware of.  You can't do anything about those now, but you can start to build good trade lines to get your score high enough for an FHA loan."

As someone who has been on a firing range regularly since I was about 6 years old, you'll find spread at an indoor range is typically more left/right or up/down on a target rather than a random spread that looks like a shotgun blast."
