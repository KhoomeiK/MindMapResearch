rarepuppers,ffl3mq0,t1_ffl373d,1580034202.0,In my opinion he most definitely is! You can judge for yourself by the latest post I made before this in my profile
corgi,ffhw8aw,t3_etgiv6,1579956713.0,Gidget looks so similar to our doggo when he was a pupper! I can't handle the cuteness
AquaticAsFuck,ffcw52e,t1_ffcvbga,1579808509.0,"Genuine research is waaay better than keeping them for amusement (or more like money), although I can't give my full support to that either. I don't think I could go see another dolphin show ever again feeling like shit for supporting the industry that makes the animals work (and likely suffer) for money."
AquaticAsFuck,ffcumau,t1_ffctrod,1579807589.0,"Now that you said it, I think it might be a vaquita with a very light color around the eye. And I've never seen such a good photo of a vaquita!

I didn't know they keep porpoises in Denmark though, that's kinda neat. I thought that one park in the Netherlands was the only one. Are they researching the porpoises of the Baltic sea there in Denmark?"
AquaticAsFuck,ffbld90,t3_esgvrv,1579770978.0,The porpoise in the image is not a vaquita but a harbour porpoise
corgi,fewuhre,t1_fevj7kz,1579419683.0,Yeah... But I don't actually know which one did that - the granny dog about 15 years ago or the little boy more recently. She did try to chew through a wall once but he was overall more destructive lol
corgi,fetn48q,t1_fetkiia,1579377066.0,My pleasure! <3
corgi,fet5tsf,t1_fet07a6,1579372104.0,Corgi butt is cute with and without a tail :D but when the older dog would expect us to throw ball for her the tail wag was the best part
corgi,feszbdf,t1_fesxebl,1579370413.0,Same! And the tail especially is just magnificent in the wind
corgi,fesyan8,t1_fesxoer,1579370116.0,They are! A wagging corgi tail is such a delightful sight!
corgi,fesd8pt,t1_fescqua,1579364059.0,"Nah, I think I'm thinking in my own country's way. I do know my stuff about different dog breeds, I'd like to think ;)"
corgi,fesauox,t1_fes7gk1,1579363373.0,"Exactly. Most people reply to that with ""A fault?! How can that be a fault? He's only more adorable if anything!"" :p I think shows maybe should have a category of their own for fluffy corgis, like they do with german shepherds."
corgi,fesa0e3,t1_fes91fp,1579363082.0,"I'm going to see the fluffy boy in two weeks and yes, I do believe it's very healthy!"
corgi,fes5iee,t1_fes3ieq,1579361620.0,He might be incompetent when it comes to dog shows but damn he's good at melting hearts and getting pets!
corgi,fes45vm,t1_fes3tof,1579361216.0,Good luck! I'd imagine there's plenty to choose from in such a populated area :)
corgi,fersj5e,t1_ferqds1,1579357882.0,"Yes, he's a ""fluffy"" variant! Both of his parents have normal hair and I know his father has many awards but all the puppies in this litter had long hair. It's too bad as fluffy corgis aren't allowed to compete in official shows (at least in my country) and the father is such a gorgeous ""normal"" individual. Also, here practically all corgis (both pembroke and cardigan) have tails!"
seals,fendbe8,t1_fen5txc,1579282241.0,I used to donate 15€ per month for the seals through WWF Finland but it seems their website has very poor support for English :/ I think Finnish Association for Nature Conservation (Suomen luonnonsuojeluliitto) is also quite trustworthy. This is the most useful-looking site I found so far being on mobile: https://www.sll.fi/mita-me-teemme/saimaannorppa/saimaa-ringed-seal/
seals,fel21t5,t1_fekxvhd,1579212361.0,One of the most amazing encounters I've had with a wild animal!
seals,feknnru,t1_fekmlmx,1579203823.0,We're trying our best! This year Finland has had the warmest January in 100 years and the seals need a thick cover of snow to make nests so volunteers move snow into piles to help the poor seal mamas
seals,fek4q6n,t1_fek2kni,1579192567.0,"I can't remember perfectly as I was barely 16 back then, but I know it was in Linnansaari national park. It's in the middle of Haukivesi, which is a popular breeding area with these creatures."
