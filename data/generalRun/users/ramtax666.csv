Of course the possibility to become less dangerous is also present, high mortality rate is not good for the virus itself. Most cross species viruses are so deathly because they are in a new environment were old methods don't apply anymore, a virus don't want to kill his hoste, it kill itself also, this is the reason the original animal (reservoir) don't get sick but can spread the virus. One reason the flu is by now our virus, even with his high mutations rate is not dangerous for a healthy individual, but it spread between us very fast. For example If i get the flu I will have be out for a day or two, but if I get back to work in one week most of my colleges will be very sick. I believe I for one have a great resistance to it and act like a reservoir, I try to vaccinate every year so I don't spread a more dangerous virus, of course I have no proof for this except for the fact that this happen every year but is a highly possible that a lot of people can't get sick from flu virus and act like reservoirs, this also can explain why we can't get rid of it like we done with others.
