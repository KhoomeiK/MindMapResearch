I've explained the issue multiple times in multiple different ways, and all you've offered in response is indignation that anyone would suggest it's irresponsible to put yourself at risk of killing someone rather than change the way you choose to get off."

In such a situation, having vaginal sex is the equivalent of pointing a gun into a crowd, pulling the trigger, and just hoping you don't hit anyone.

And if you do it anyway, and you end up killing someone, you're still responsible for that person's death even though you ""took precautions""."
