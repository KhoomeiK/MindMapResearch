I’m just bummed that it’s being removed from Game pass soon /: at least that’s what I’ve heard, so I’m trying to finish it beforehand but I plan on buying it anyways because it’s just that damn good"
breakingbad,feyjcyi,t3_eqtarf,1579446250.0,"Wow, new viewer?? I envy you haha, enjoy it!! You can only watch this show for the first time once. Me personally, if I were you, I’d take my time with it and not binge it in like 2 weeks lol only because I feel like taking this show in little by little is a better experience overall, especially if it’s your first time, but hey that’s just me, you do you! Have fun, it’ll be a wild ride you’ll never forget 😆"

Not to mention, why are you even talking to guys who clearly just wanna get in your pants? They flirt with them and they just enjoy getting their attention. Nah man, I’m glad my girl doesn’t bother with that nonsense lmao"

socialanxiety,fervc15,t1_ferlmnn,1579358691.0,"Damn she sounds annoying! I had a similar experience with a teacher I had in middle school. Always purposely calling on me to answer questions I didn’t know how to answer due to my learning disabilities and ADHD, it was difficult for me to follow the teachings, yet he would embarrass me whenever I didn’t know the answer, saying stuff like “oh look, he finally got an answer right everyone, everyone clap for him” or “what you thinking about? Huh?” Whenever I had a thinking expression on my face trying to figure out a math problem, while everyone in the class just stared at me. Bruh it was horrible, I still got mental scars from those days lmao"
