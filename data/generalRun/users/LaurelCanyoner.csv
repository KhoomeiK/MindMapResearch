He has been in therapy alone with our child for about ten years NO change, but it has monumentally helped my son recognize this and helped him deal with his behavior. (The therapist is VERY clear she is my kids therapist and will always be there for them, NOT for my husband which he finds infuriating)  I went to couples therapy and it was an exercise in abuse. (Did not help that the therapist was not good at recognizing this) Each person was supposed to get a chance to talk but every single session he demanded to begin and spent the whole time complaining and criticizing me.

Do you want kids and do you think that will change?

My husbands father is 95 and refuses to wear his, so he misses out on most of the conversations, and we just leave him to it as he gets so defensive about them if we ever bring them up. You can't change people. Even -and maybe especially- when they are 95 years old. If they are cognizant they are still responsible for their choices."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fct3yns,t1_fcs6cjt,1577932263.0,"Same. I just recently had a major breakthrough in therapy about why I LOVE giving presents and HATE getting them. Therapist just looked at me and said, ""All the presents you were given had expectations and judgement attached. None of them were given freely and with love"".  This sub is honestly better than therapy for me sometimes because I realize I am not alone, and I have come to so much understanding about my own habits, personality traits triggers etc, seeing them in other people. I start this new year saying THANK YOU to all of you. you teach me so much with your openness and humility. Thank you all."
