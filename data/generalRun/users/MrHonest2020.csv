unpopularopinion,ffhracj,t1_ffhi199,1579949754.0,"Yah for their abandoned house and resources - for now. Overpopulation is about sustainability. We have enough shit but it wont sustain our survival. Plus, do you know how many fucking habitats are being destroywd to make more space for humans? The more space we take the more fucked the environment is. I'm talking science as someone who actually has a phd in it"

unpopularopinion,ffhfute,t3_etmmy1,1579933480.0,Just because it was a main goal doesnt mean they wanted to have them. Probably forced into it by their parents/society for the *amazing heir*.
unpopularopinion,fefmawx,t1_fef2t6s,1579059397.0,"Hold on, I'm not saying people who live are not brave or have guts. I was just counter arguing OP's point that most people don't have it in them to go against their natural instinct to live. If they had this extra bravery that  most people don't have then surely they'd have the bravery to go keep living as well. That's what I was trynna say.

I thinks its braver to live a full life which is unpredictable than to end it (most brave probs being people with suicidal thoughts who are able to suppress it) but thats just my opinion"

unpopularopinion,fed30k8,t1_fed2pq8,1578996244.0,"Come on now, don't tell me you're that naive. A person who strives for equality tries to create a balance. That's not what feminists do. All they want is for women to be empowered and show the power of women, which is fine, but they're more interested in changing the social 'hierarchy' of men being on top and put women up there"
unpopularopinion,fed2mwb,t1_fed1kcw,1578995678.0,Oh fuck off. Feminism is definitely not about equality but more about just empowering women and disempowering men. No equality there.

Like most people said, you can post whatever you want on your social media and more so if you trying to build slef confidence.

HOWEVER, he is right. Provocative images are not the right way to do it. It is a way, but not the right one. Though he has no right to tell you what not to post, you must understand how he feels. Nevermind the fact that social media is forever (@future employers who might find it distasteful).

Relationships are built on compromise and you don't always get your way so while I agree with what most of the commenters said, I also disagree with them saying you must ignore him and do you. You're in a relationship. You act differently when you're in a relationship and when you're single.

So though you can do whatever you want, you must also accept the risk of losing or negatively impacting your relationship with him"
offmychest,feaho54,t3_eo95g6,1578948921.0,Arrogance is more how you carry yourself and doesn't necessarily have a link to being smart. Unless you're just being a smart ass then that's you
unpopularopinion,fe9vxid,t1_fe9swwc,1578941896.0,"I don't think you have the right definition of drastic bro. I agree with everything here. But drastic doesn't necessarily have to do with time. Which is why I said earlier that it was supposed to be this drastic but should be happening at this rate.

What happened in the Cambrian explosion was drastic, but didn't happen overnight"

unpopularopinion,fe9q264,t1_fe9n6ct,1578940420.0,"But it's still the father's child nonetheless and it should be a mutual agreement instead of just going with the women's say. Ya sure, it risks the mother but that's a risk they should take jointly or she must take it alone if the father doesn't want a child"
unpopularopinion,fe9kzay,t1_fe9bz92,1578938859.0,"And what if the guy wants to keep the baby but the women doesn't?

Your mentality is unfair. They have a say in them having sex, not about the pregnancy itself. It's not the same"

unpopularopinion,fe7n5l3,t3_eo2vde,1578916855.0,You don't have to change your lifestyle to acknowledge that something is wrong. They might not due something to change their ways but they can still complain about it. (they shouldn't but they can)

Second, they do have contraceptives often provided by the state but it's just the lack of education that the problem.

And just a note, I find it interesting you refer to this as 'allowing their populations to grow' as if they're subordinates to you so called first world countries. A bit of arrogance to me"
