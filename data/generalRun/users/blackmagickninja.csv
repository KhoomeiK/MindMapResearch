WhitePeopleTwitter,felu0uz,t3_epo09z,1579230913.0,"I agree with op's title. To say a guy saved someone is nice, but boring. Saying a past criminal, who you might expect to be selfish and sadistic, saved someone is way more interesting."

SelfAwarewolves,fcbg9zp,t1_fcbf5bp,1577586500.0,"There are poor people with food stamps that still buy awful things. Look about 5 months ago I was built like a kong toy and was sick of it so I went for the diet and tried low carb, so far lost about 30 pounds. And I'm on food stamps, so I have to ration in healthy foods and it's really not difficult if you research nutritional intake vs carbs. Seriously if you're not into eating salads try keto, it's very helpful. My problem is there is too much validation these days for being overweight. I'm not talking about a little chub, I'm talking in the scooters and unwilling to buy two plane tickets. It's dangerous. If you live where all you can actually eat is hamburgers everyday like a trucker, fine, but that is on average not the case."
SelfAwarewolves,fcbece4,t1_fcbdijl,1577585823.0,If you dont have access you arent what I'm referring to. There are plenty of morbidly obese in urban high population areas too. They have access they just dont care.
SelfAwarewolves,fcbcebj,t1_fcb8vgl,1577585151.0,"You can still put down the fork before eating shitty food too. Its not hard to eat healthy, all you need is low carb, high nutrition foods. That's it. Im not talking about salads, I'm talking about real food. And you dont need to buy expensive organic shit either, just research and try working harder at food prep. Take responsibility."

horror,fc668k7,t3_egc1wa,1577473213.0,"People acting like animal cruelty for internet notoriety is rare or something. This one one incident and it's .001% of what's out there. Shovel dog? Minced baby mice? That one guy who beat his cat up that 4chan busted? Pig vs chainsaw? Crush videos? Come on now. Humans need to kick off this planet asap, we're a disease.
