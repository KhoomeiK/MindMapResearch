aww,fdkohzw,t3_elt8hd,1578507847.0,As impressed as I am with the dog (what a good boi!) I'm even more impressed with human beings. We learned to train one type of animal to find another type of animal so that we can help them. How wonderful!

aww,fcurrge,t1_fcs4aef,1577987170.0,Some people are allergic to most dogs and need a particular breed in order to be able to own a dog. I think that alone justifies (responsible) breeders.
aww,fcr2eif,t1_fcqsqfv,1577895794.0,">i do not agree with the conditions of puppy farms and certain breeders who are inhumane. That did not stop me from adopting my pet from a puppy store.
