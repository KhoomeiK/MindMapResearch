offmychest,fflk9mn,t3_eu5b1l,1580040659.0,"It sounds like maybe you want to change and start socializing more. Humans are social creatures and I think you would benefit from having a person or group of people to interact with.

Start small, with one person. Next time someone asks you to hang out, actually make plans to do it. Don't put too much pressure on the relationship. Just enjoy the activity and see where things go. Like with anything, it will take practice. You might feel awkward at first, but the more you do it, the better it will be.

If I were you, I would also definitely look into talking to a therapist so they can help guide you through your feelings and your next steps for interactions.

Lots of people have had very difficult childhoods, abused and bullied. You can overcome this."

mildlyinfuriating,ffhwiu6,t1_ffhujs6,1579957064.0,Very good advice. Welcome to the world. There are some richer than you and some poorer than you. You have to find gratitude for what you have to achieve happiness.
offmychest,ffhwdkj,t3_etpu44,1579956892.0,"You absolutely, 100%, need to rip that bandaid off and end the relationship. When you are with someone, there needs to be trust and communication. 2 years and he hasn't met your mom and no special occasions together? Just stop. It will be sad and heartbreaking. You are comfortable with him and you are fond of him. But the pain will get better over time and you will feel free, like you can breathe again. You WILL eventually find someone else. You must break this off and learn to love and respect yourself. 

When I was 16-18 I was madly in love. He said he was going to marry me. Actually he was crazy and didnt care about me at all and I found all this proof that he had other girls on the side and he made fun of me to his friends. Then it of nowhere he ghosted me after 2 years. When I finally realized it was done, I cried and cried for months. When I was ready I started going to parties and hanging out with other guys... then I randomly met the man I am with now, my husband. He is so loving and so respectful still to this day, 15 years later."

The Guest House


This being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.
A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.
Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they are a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture,
still, treat each guest honorably.
He may be clearing you out
for some new delight.
The dark thought, the shame, the malice.
meet them at the door laughing and invite them in.
Be grateful for whatever comes.
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond.
