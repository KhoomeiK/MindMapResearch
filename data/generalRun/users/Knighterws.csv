Bap can kill you quicker than most dps and mercy gets an extremely forgiving projectile with underrated damage that can melt in less time if you hit your headshots.

I like the orisa sigma nerfs, but they are too strong. They should have come alongside nerfs to wrecking ball, reinhardt and zarya. (As a rein ball winston player) 


Hanzos storm arrows should have gotten heashots fucking disabled. Clowns. 


Reaper didnt need a nerf. He was easily countered after the great barrier nerf. And if he needed one, was another one because he is a problem the lower you go in the ranks. Definetely not this that kills him above diamond. AGAIN. 


Mei should have gotten a nerf. Her ult is still a what, 1 second instakill in a radius because her freeze still stacks with blizzard for immediate death. 


Mccree felt good with his shooting speed. I might agree he needed 250hp after dva buffs but making him feel slower and less engagable was not the fucking solution.

I dont follow owl - but i recall a clip of a genji player in anubis; motherfucker dashed to the widow on top of choke and instakilled her with only a melee in a fraction of a second. Truth is, it wasnt a melee alone. He fanned her head and instantly meleed, so damn quickly that the animation didnt even happen. Genji in a vacuum would simply instakill every squishie in a team in less than 5 seconds. Of course it doesnt play that way, but he is designed for that to be *plausible*

Competitiveoverwatch,fegw703,t3_eoxx0h,1579103901.0,"Genji. I mean tracer is hard but i think genji players are severely underrated.

Any microscopic ammount of healing already breaks his combo (three heashots and a dash, pretty much harder to get in comparison to tracer imo). He is much easier to hit, and has a much less forgiving mobility.

That plus how difficult it is to engage anything with him nowadays (brig, zarya, mei, moira, mei, Mccree, etc) and how a support deals literally the same damage as him, just quicker and with hitscan made him kind of fall off the earth.

Not to say, even if your team breaks both pillars needed fast, the fact that a hero is with a wall behind his back makes it almost an instakill on a good team. A lucio, a bap, a dva or whatever other character that can go up and above the wall is most likely still going to die from mei alone (since she has free freeze, no range disadvantage).
