unpopularopinion,ff2kbhz,t1_ff20ugd,1579510070.0,">Until people see the pain we cause public opinion will remain where it is.

Unfortunately the public opinion is often worth crap. I'd say we have a pretty good public opinion on some things such as hurting each other, yet here we are still waging wars and exploiting people. Ignorance is only part of the problem."
offmychest,fev973k,t1_fet3jud,1579394622.0,Oh yeah I absolutely agree with that. Many job listings have such poor information you are left with more questions than answers.
offmychest,ferz2if,t1_fer89a3,1579359839.0,"Well there is value in knowledge that you should have with a degree, so I can see why if they want both or prefer a degree. It really depends on the position."
offmychest,fenyy5l,t1_femzhhq,1579292861.0,"It really depends on the field. But for certain fields where you'd think college knowledge should matter the most, it's often practical experience. Internships are usually the best way to show your worth before going regular full time job when you graduate. Without internships you'd probably only be interesting if you had top grades."

unpopularopinion,fen0dmy,t1_femmp02,1579274139.0,"Especially true if your family has a house. I know some people who moved out of their parents' homes and now have to rent. I understand that some of them want to do it to have their independence and all that, but with the price of renting... I don't really want to spend almost 25% of my salary just to rent (25% is also quite nice as I am able to work in a good field to earn more than average, otherwise it would be even higher). I'd much rather just save the extra money or buy my parents things they need/want rather than waste it on rent (plus it's nice not to be all on your own, although I could use a bit of experience of being totally independent)."
unpopularopinion,fel0ly5,t1_fejns0g,1579211500.0,This is exactly why this whole opinion is very strange. I doubt people don't want America to be the leader and would put China or Russia instead. They would likely rather have someone closer to American democracy with less capitalism that kills its own people through crippling debt over basic needs among many things.

Not only is reading a hobby, but it is a hobby that can improve other aspects of your life, both professional and non-professional."

It is a shame that some (probably most) people that make a positive impact on society as a whole don't get the respect or the recognition they deserve. 

But you have to consider what that would involve. For most discoveries or inventions it is rarely a single person. Especially in today's world, it is often a team that built their work off of someone else's work. And there are countless things that move the society forward: any new medicine/disease/symptom discovery, any manufacturing improvement, any large scale computer related improvement, even something as old as agriculture still gets improved by everything around it improving. There are just too many people to be thankful to at the same time, and you can't easily keep up with any of that. You still do get to hear about the biggest breakthroughs, so there's at least that. 

When it comes to entertainment, for the product you are interested in, there are those few people who are basically the face of the product. Whether that's a write for your favorite book, singer for your favorite song, or actor for your favorite movie. There are likely dozens of people behind them who made the whole product a reality, but you don't get to hear about them much either. You also don't get to know about a big portion of entertainers either.

So while there is a lot of room to at least somewhat equalize the amount of media exposure entertainers and the rest get, the entertainers will still have the spotlight because their work is both easier to understand to the masses (things that improve our lives are not always easily comprehensible to an average Joe), and because we appreciate the things that make us happy more than the ones that make us not sad (so to say). Life without entertainment is too boring to not give attention to those that do make the life enjoyable, while we could still live an enjoyable life being primitive, I guess.

Also this whole argument was presented without any consideration of media-bias that makes people with money just focus their media on something that can get them more money easier and faster, which just makes the entertainers valued even more."
