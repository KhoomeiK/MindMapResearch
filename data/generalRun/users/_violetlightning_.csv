BabylonBerlin,ffr2ywp,t3_eur9hx,1580149322.0,"They will not be releasing Season 4 that soon. Seasons 1 and 2 were all filmed together (there are even scenes from Season 2 that are shown in flashes in Season 1 episodes). Season 3 was filmed on its own, not sure what the schedule is for filming Season 4, but I haven’t heard anything about them starting it yet. Best guess is that it would be *late* 2020 at the earliest."
90DayFiance,ffqyhwi,t1_ffqxia1,1580146494.0,I assume that’s what they meant. Unless there’s some weird bird fetish I don’t (want to) know about.
Hypothyroidism,ffq8xco,t3_eukbhd,1580126400.0,"My grandfather had a pill dispenser for people with memory problems. It would beep an alarm and the inner chamber would advance and a little window would pop open so that only 1 (set of) pill(s) were available to him at a time. This prevented him from taking more than one dose because he “forgot” he had taken them or doing whatever other weird things he would come up with. IIRC, the chamber would shut after a while so he couldn’t take doses too close together. My Mom could open the unit with a key to refill and/or check that he was actually taking his meds. 

You could use something like that and get her used to the process (beep means it’s meds time, etc) on the days that you’re up with her, and then eventually move onto letting her take more control. A small incentive system might help her feel motivated on the weekends when she’s supposed to be doing it herself."

My brother’s favorite joke for a while was “I knew I needed to lose weight because I had bigger boobs than my sister.” *Hilarious.*"
