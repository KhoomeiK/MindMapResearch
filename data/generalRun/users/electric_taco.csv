todayilearned,fe6jp3n,t1_fe6i3xu,1578893106.0,"No, a sufficiently large chunk of Lithium or Potassium or other metal that reacts violently with water would be the opposite of helpful. I choose to live in a world where it's ok to call out idiots who do something dumb so others can learn from their mistakes. If I die doing something dumb, I sure as hell hope someone learns something from it"
todayilearned,fe6i0vx,t1_fe6hpr0,1578891527.0,"I really hope that you would hope for something more helpful, like a boat"
todayilearned,fe6fkr2,t1_fe6d5tp,1578889402.0,Controversial internet comment achieved
todayilearned,fe6esyc,t1_fe6e6h3,1578888767.0,"Absolutely, this officer made a bad one."
todayilearned,fe6dvj7,t1_fe6cekj,1578888023.0,"I believe police officers are trained to know to not go into situations they cannot handle, or ones where the risk outweighs the potential benefit. Ignoring this training is, in my opinion, an objectively unwise move. Also, genderding the police officer was not warranted."
todayilearned,fe6df63,t1_fe69j8n,1578887660.0,"I do, I have been very depressed. I never, ever once wanted to cause harm to others though, it takes extreme selfishness on top of depression to disregard those around you"
subaru,fe6d4kv,t1_fe5nkc0,1578887427.0,Subaru ran an ad campaign that supported this stereotype. Some time in the 90s I think. They knew their market lol. But Imprezas were never really part of that they're very much cars for young cis white males
todayilearned,fe6bbac,t1_fe60q6p,1578886073.0,"Yep, better options would have prevented this person from killing and injuring others. Suicidal people are a danger to those around them, for this reason, and that risk should be better mitigated."
todayilearned,fe6ahc1,t1_fe6028s,1578885465.0,"The police officer couldn't have done anything useful then by going in the water no matter what, they made a bad decision on their own. Officer was idiot for making bad situation worse"
todayilearned,fe6873s,t1_fe64mle,1578883922.0,A harsh punishment for this person is still necessary to dissuade other suicidal people from attempting this method when it poses a huge risk to others. You have to make it an unappealing option
Cyberpunk,fdjb1de,t3_elavj1,1578463804.0,Here's a good walk through of this plant: [https://youtu.be/mAgvjNiKhEM](https://youtu.be/mAgvjNiKhEM)
embedded,fdg2g6d,t1_fdc5waf,1578377540.0,"Often times the errata are documenting ways that the hardware doesn't operate in the way that it was designed or specified. Chip bugs, not documentation errors. Changing the document in-situ so that it matches what the hardware does, instead of what it \*should\* do (and putting the unexpected behavior in an errata sheet), could lead to further confusion (why did they intentionally make it work in a weird way?), or cause issues when the bug is fixed in a later silicon revision. The documentation should always match the design spec of the microcontroller/SOC, any deviation of the actual hardware from that goes in the errata."
IdiotsInCars,fd7j28c,t1_fd77rws,1578205317.0,"Just move out of the way. Any of your other options are going to create a more dangerous situation. It's better to arrive at your destination safely than to discourage an asshole from tailgating (and, as shown here, it's just going to piss them off and put yourself at risk, not discourage them)"
SpaceXMasterrace,f920lcm,t1_f8vkhca,1575007694.0,"That may take a while. Not sure if hardening at a 7nm process is even possible. The CPUs being hardened are about a decade behind. We're getting RH ARM Cortex chips now, and that's becoming the hot stuff for cubesats and small equipment"
