In the interview he did mention a few very fast XD pairs, none of which are particularly tall. 

I think thats just generally the difference in badminton  tactics when you look at the Europeans vs the Asians.

The asian style, at least in doubles, has traditionally been based on speed and maneuverability to overwhelm opponents, a very good current example would be the minions. 
Admittedly i don't watch enough european badminton to know its style. I find the idea that european badminton focuses on 'tactics' and '*reading*' the opponent and playing to their weakness to be rubbish, thats implying that europeans have a higher intellect than asians and as an asian I disagree."
badminton,fee9q61,t1_fedwcae,1579029303.0,"I think you're reading too much into it. It's a fact that europeans are physically bigger than Asians. Just look at the global average height charts. Im not going to go into the reasons why that is so, that's a story for another day. 

When one is physically bigger, you carry more momentum and you generally are not as nimble, thats why he mentioned that asians are superior in speed. He never said that asians were bad at reading the game, he only mentioned that europeans *used* to be able to read the game better."
