diyaudio,fdr3byb,t1_fdqjz39,1578678892.0,"Veneering with adhesive backed veneer is so easy even I could do it.  I veneered two 4ft towers with rounded corners with no more than an exacto knife and a clothes iron.  Came out gorgeous.  In general it's called woodworking, but in my hands it's called ""making sawdust"".  But seriously you can do this - don't let it intimidate you."

TrueAtheism,fdm6zyz,t3_em0rla,1578541344.0,"We all have friends and relatives like your brother (even if we think we don't).  I try to stay positive and put my energy into defending science and education.  I take comfort in knowing that in South Africa there is an entire museum (large and well funded) devoted to teaching evolution and displaying the very old fossils that paint the picture or our species' development.  And sometimes there are the pleasant surprises like the little desert museum in Arizona that has a whole section on evolution.  I immediately went to the guest book there and gushed on how important that place was.  I'm reminded of the line from Leonard Cohen's song ""Anthem"",  ""There's a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.""

BudgetAudiophile,fdk3erj,t3_elqmvw,1578495097.0," Just out of curiosity how heavy are these speakers?  The Klipsch Forte IIIs tip the scales at about 75 pounds and [John Darko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D45tgeSjX0&t=23s) put his on wheeled pallets.  One thought: whether it's rubber feat (my choice), spikes, or wheels, unless you have everything precise, level and square, three feet will always ensure a solid connection to the floor."
diyaudio,fdhqljj,t3_ejnqp6,1578428230.0,Look at it another way.   A chance to disassemble something is a chance to better understand design and assembly methods from various eras.  Take your time.  Photograph every step.  You should be fine.  And you will be a more experienced vintage audio owner.  This may be your first rodeo but it won't be your last.

diyaudio,fd9kytb,t1_fd640ve,1578234829.0,This is the best advice.  Keep in mind the that the OEM version could have been superceded by a slightly different model.  If this is the case you might consider replacing both tweeters.  I say this because I've been in the same situation.

vintageaudio,fc44crm,t3_efzyeg,1577406308.0,Love the TEAC tape deck. If it’s still functional it’s capable of very high quality recordings.
vintageaudio,fbvon0v,t3_eeownv,1577133833.0,8 Track was actually a high quality source.  Sadly the compact cassette beat it on size and convenience.
