Do you want to share these physical activities with her or is it just that you're fantasizing about this hypothetical optimal shape of hers? 

If it's just a superficial desire of her looking better, when you already find her attractive, I think it's just a matter of ignoring this little voice in your head until the though disappear like so many weird obsessions our brains make up for us, 

If it is actually about the life style, well, it's really up to your gf to be honest with herself and see if  being a sporty girl is what she aspires to be, no harm in trying out a few activities I think to get her answer, but it can take sometime to start enjoying a physical activity and the thing is, it's really not up to you whether she wants to make these changes, it doesn't even have anything to do with her love for you, getting into shape is something she needs to wants for herself when it comes down to it

Bottom line, stop nagging, kindly invite her to join you whenever you're ready to work out, now that you made your desires clear, and since these are the only things you can do, you can let the issue drop and stop worrying, it doesn't feel nice and it just spoils a good thing.

I *know* it's easier said than done but I'm honestly commenting because that's what actually works for me, whenever there are problems troubling me that I can't change, I rationalize to myself how minor they actually are and give it time untill it passes"

Next time explicitly request something like he did for his birthday, otherwise it seems you're dissatisfied with the relationship in general, where do his money problems come from and is there an end in sight? 

And what about the day to day? Does he do nice things for you, is he affectionate, listen when you need him to, do you feel like he supports you as much as you supports him? 

And if you managed to pinpoint a few problems from the questions above, has it always been like that or did they appear more recently? Do you feel like he's in a good head space, not stressed or depressed? 

To go back to your birthday, it's fine to bring up the topic you know, it doesn't have to be a confrontation, just tell him that you like celebrating your birthday, and a nice gesture that he put some thought in would've been nice, again don't be accusatory, but it's alright to let him know you were a bit disappointed."

Do you want to share these physical activities with her or is it just that you're fantasizing about this hypothetical optimal shape of hers? 

If it's just a superficial desire of her looking better, when you already find her attractive, I think it's just a matter of ignoring this little voice in your head until the though disappear like so many weird obsessions our brains make up for us, 

If it is actually about the life style, well, it's really up to your gf to be honest with herself and see if  being a sporty girl is what she aspires to be, no harm in trying out a few activities I think to get her answer, but it can take sometime to start enjoying a physical activity and the thing is, it's really not up to you whether she wants to make these changes, it doesn't even have anything to do with her love for you, getting into shape is something she needs to wants for herself when it comes down to it

Bottom line, stop nagging, kindly invite her to join you whenever you're ready to work out, now that you made your desires clear, and since these are the only things you can do, you can let the issue drop and stop worrying, it doesn't feel nice and it just spoils a good thing.

I *know* it's easier said than done but I'm honestly commenting because that's what actually works for me, whenever there are problems troubling me that I can't change, I rationalize to myself how minor they actually are and give it time untill it passes"

And if you managed to pinpoint a few problems from the questions above, has it always been like that or did they appear more recently? Do you feel like he's in a good head space, not stressed or depressed? 

To go back to your birthday, it's fine to bring up the topic you know, it doesn't have to be a confrontation, just tell him that you like celebrating your birthday, and a nice gesture that he put some thought in would've been nice, again don't be accusatory, but it's alright to let him know you were a bit disappointed."
