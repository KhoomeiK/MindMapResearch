NYGiants,ffm66yx,t3_eu1men,1580049228.0,"Watching that press conference I was just overcome by his love for the Giants.  I have loved the Giants since I was a little boy 60 years ago.   You all know the feeling.  The contentment and exhilaration from a win.  The depression and ache deep in the pit of your stomach from a loss.  The two Super Bowls were fantastic, but when they beat the cowboys in that first super bowl run, I was manically happy.  I live in the DFW area.  I called my buddy back in NJ and we went wild on the phone for 15 minutes.    When he said   “once a Giant,  ONLY a Giant”  I burst into tears.  The Giants  mean the world to us.  It’s nice to know Eli felt the same way."

Anyway, I never want to put myself in a position to root against the Giants for any reason.  So, I picked all Giants.  I was scorned.  But, my logic was if we had a good game, I’d rack up all the points rather than having just one good player.   We did a weekly payout.  You kicked in a couple of bucks and whoever had the most points won the pool that week.  I won two of the sixteen games.  Not bad.  There were like 30 people playing, so most never won at all."

Then we mix garden planting soil and peat moss.  We throw in a shovel full in first, then the tree (about 3-4 feet long from bottom of root to tip) then two more shovels of mix.   Then we hoe back in the rest of the dirt from the hole.   We have all the holes pre dug before we start planting.  We planted 24 today, took us a couple of hours.  That’s all for one day.  Like I said, we are old.  I’m retired.  Yes, some things won’t grow near them.  We grow peaches and pumpkins as well.  They are ok, but they are a distance from the walnut trees anyway."

However, be prepared for them to say they can’t or won’t take the case as far as you want.  I would recommend getting a private attorney who is representing you and your daughter.   I am an attorney and I can promise that the right attorney will put your interests first ahead of just a “ cause”.   You should sue the child (and her parents) who attacked and harassed your daughter.  The local DA should get involved.  If you haven’t done so, demand that the police file charges.  Next you should sue the school district for negligence for allowing your daughter to be attacked on their school bus.  This is outrageous and should not be tolerated in any way, shape or form!  Get a lawyer who will come at them hard.  A good lawyer should take this on a contingency basis.   Good luck with this.  This really sucks that your daughter is subjected to this.  I hope it all works out ok for you and her.  Just know that there are a lot of people who support you and wish the best for you."
