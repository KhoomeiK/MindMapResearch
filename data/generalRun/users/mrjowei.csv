In a thorough review of court documents, CBS News pieced together the  likely basis of the defense case. In October, under aggressive  questioning by attorney Pamela Mackey, lead detective Doug Winters  admitted that: 

* another man's semen was found on swabs taken from the woman's body.    

* pubic combings uncovered another man's body hair.    

* And that the young woman arrived at her rape exam wearing underwear containing semen that was not Bryant's. 

In  a later defense filing, Bryant attorney Hal Haddon argued that the  soiled underwear ""compellingly suggests"" another sexual encounter after  Bryant and before the rape exam 18 hours later.
