I'm not sure if I'm convinced that there's any situation where one must be hard on oneself. But it might be a semantic thing.

So for example if a person is in a place where they really need to take action, it would be important to really be firm with ourselves like ""I need to do this thing now"" even if we don't want to. But it can still be done in a loving and respectful way. Again, just like how a parent can direct a child to do something that the child must do.

ALL of that can go without the ""why are you such a piece of shit"" element. Are we on the same page there?"

getdisciplined,fffle4e,t1_fffkxrh,1579886476.0,I've heard good things about that one...
getdisciplined,ffflbys,t1_fffk5v7,1579886439.0,"I see! Did you get the sense that I was calling you a failure just now? I'd like to set the record straight then - that's not what I think you are. I have only respect for you and can only assume that you are living your life as intelligently as you possibly can.

I can relate to depression, I've spent years incapacitated by it. It's brutal! In my own personal case, my depression was largely due to this sense of wanting to accomplish so much, and yet not being able to even get myself out of bed.

What was helpful for me (although there's certainly more to it), was discovering what capacity I DID have to change. What little improvements could I promise to myself and keep? Like, is there any way *at all* in which I can improve my life? And what would that look like?

... From there I was able to scale up to larger things.

I don't even mean to claim that this will be helpful for everyone or even anyone, but what choice do I have except to be as helpful as I know how to be?"
getdisciplined,fffe9ph,t1_fffd5o1,1579882058.0,Are you not? What cure do you require?
getdisciplined,fffcrc8,t1_fffbmpa,1579881098.0,Amen. That is an excellent point.
