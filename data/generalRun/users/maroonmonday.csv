I've had mine as long as I can remember, but didn't realize I was different until my 20s.  I assume mine is genetic,  but then again if I got dropped on my head as a baby that might explain a few other things as well.  What would be really rough is you hear some stories like a military member had TBI and developed it.  To know what it is like to walk in a room and easily identify faces then to suddenly not be able to."

What I'm saying and your response shows is that no one gives a crap about my problem, so if I have the desire to have some other need help to fund a technology that would benefit me then I'm not going to just condemn it and say it is all bad.

worldnews,fffomt6,t1_fffbwfr,1579888446.0,"You see a face, but it just doesn't register in your brain.  A good example would be to look at a picture of someone's face then take that picture away and try to visualize that face.  I can't do that.  Following along with movies and TV shows can be real challenging as well.  Identifying people is usually based on their whole body and people with unique facial features,  as they just click in your brain.  Someone like Steve Buscemi really stands out as I just remember those crazy eyes from Con Air."
