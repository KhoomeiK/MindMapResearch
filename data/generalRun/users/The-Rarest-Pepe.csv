politics,ffg15ir,t1_ffg0kf1,1579896208.0,"The problem with that is that it's assuming every single person, especially those with a lot of power and influence, have purely altruistic goals in mind. We've seen several times that assuming the rich will do what's best for everyone can have disastrous consequences. Hell, a lack of rigid oversight is what allowed rich American fruit barons to essentially control countries in South America (banana republics)."
politics,fffyjdh,t1_fffxxzn,1579894601.0,"The problem with deciding where your tax dollars go is that a lot of very important things aren't particularly interesting. Nobody wants to be paying for maintenance inspections on highway overpasses. Another huge issue is that things like public education, which primarily benefits people of lower incomes, would lose a large portion of the meager funding it has. After all, if your kids go to a prestigious private school, why would you choose to help pay for public schools? Letting people pick and choose where their taxes go is just begging for trouble, and the poor will be the ones who get hurt."

politics,fffghov,t1_fffg17t,1579883446.0,"Bill Gates's philanthropy is a good thing, I'm not going to argue with that. What I'm saying is that the means by which he gained the wealth he uses, and the system that enabled it, are inherently immoral. There's a reason philanthropy is a fairly uncommon thing among the super rich. Most people didn't get the money by caring about people, and they're not going to start caring once they have it."

Edit: I realize this comparison kind of comes out of left field. I didn't realize this was much higher up in the thread than I thought. Further down I and a few others get into the ethics and morality of these companies, which is what I was basing the comparison on."
politics,ffffosc,t1_ffffa43,1579882950.0,"Maybe if people actually cared enough to be vocal about increasing funding for NASA, they could achieve that kind of progress. We continually slash their budget and wonder why they fall behind private companies."
politics,ffffi0s,t1_ffffc0e,1579882832.0,Both people you mentioned ran companies that did exactly what I said would happen: they realized that you can make a lot more money when you don't give a shit about people. Why do you think iPhone factories have suicide nets?
politics,fffdv3a,t1_fffdfhc,1579881793.0,"They've innovated, yes, *to their own benefit*. As great as technological advancement is, they're not doing it for the public good. It's a private company, and a private company's goal is always to maximize profits. When a company gets that big, in an industry like they're in, it's only a matter of time before those maximization efforts come at the cost of human suffering. One could argue we're already well past that point."
