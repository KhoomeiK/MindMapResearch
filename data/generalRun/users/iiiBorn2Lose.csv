nihilism,ff5wge8,t3_erovjf,1579612548.0,"There's nothing wrong with the way you are feeling as many people go through a stage similar to this in life, but it is different for everyone.

I'm not a therapist, but my advice is for you to do something that you enjoy, not give a shit about what other people think, and live your life in a way that is satisfying for YOU.

If it's a feeling of hopelessness you are feeling because you believe life is meaningless, then maybe you should look at it a little differently. Yes, life is meaningless. Yes other people are not aware of this, but doesn't that mean that you are more free then them?

You are not guided by a false religion, nor are your choice guided by you wanting to be rewarded once you are gone. Your choices are guided by what YOU want to do for YOURSELF, and as long as you aren't making life miserable for others, nobody can hold anything against you.

Of course, you decide what you want to believe in, but you might find yourself feeling better if you take a moment to consider what I've said. Don't give up man, because this is the only life you've got and you don't want to waste it."
nihilism,ff5gqyx,t3_ero5wc,1579592151.0,"Having gone through a period of suicidal thoughts myself all I wanted to do was stop existing, but after a few attitude changes and a certain amount of time shifting my outlook on life, I decided to live, because I didn't want to waste my one life or give up on myself. It certainly wasn't easy, and I feel for those going through it, as you feel like nobody could help you and nothing could improve your situation. At that point, you need help, either from others or from within"
AskReddit,femjmnb,t1_femik95,1579258941.0,Okay. Are we going to keep going back and forth with this?
AskReddit,femi808,t1_femhj52,1579256898.0,"I never said they weren't conditioned to either, but that doesn't make it right."
AskReddit,femh57j,t1_femgxlz,1579255268.0,"Yes, and I told you that I know that some women are aware of the things men are told, I even mentioned this in my answer to the OPs question"
AskReddit,femgixw,t1_femgehx,1579254345.0,I honestly have no clue what you're talking about now. Clarification for what?
AskReddit,femfifp,t1_femeqo4,1579252807.0,I never said they didn't.
AskReddit,femebpl,t3_epr0g5,1579251067.0,"No, I don't really care about what others think of me."
AskReddit,feme5r2,t1_femacwq,1579250834.0,"You're saying women are told to ""man up"" or ""grow a pair""? You're saying women are told ""Only pussies cry""?"
AskReddit,fem9wk4,t1_fem99ag,1579245256.0,Never said they didn't but we expect that from fellow men who have been conditioned to be the same way. It'd just be nice if women could be different.
AskReddit,fel9hu7,t1_fel86q8,1579216993.0,"Those are valid opinions. I actually played Spec Ops: The Line before watching Apocalypse Now (which is one of my favourite movies now) and I haven't yet read Heart of Darkness so maybe that's why I was taken by it more than you. I also knew about the Willy Pete scene already but it didn't put me off playing as I was simply curious as to where the story would go. It would've definitely done better if there had been more choice though, there's no arguing that. I think the developers just wanted to tell a certain story and that's the best they could do with their budget and time constraints. I still think more people ought to experience the game if they know nothing about it, though."
AskReddit,fel2m5f,t1_fekllku,1579212714.0,"Actually, in a lot of games your choices don't matter. It was trying to tell an interesting story and while your points have some merit, it also doesn't stop the story from being gripping from start to finish, with many subtle hints and interesting nods to what is coming. It sounds like the story really got to you and that's why you don't like it..."
AskReddit,fekjxum,t1_fekgpyi,1579201613.0,You seriously think Spec Ops The Line is overrated?
nihilism,fekgch3,t1_fekfkr6,1579199464.0,Of course.
AskReddit,fekgacx,t1_fekew3j,1579199428.0,"That isn't relevant though, the question is just asking for underrated games that you believe more people should play. I stated my opinion, does that annoy you or something?"
AskReddit,feke6ia,t1_fekdpvv,1579198177.0,"Extremely popular? Rising Storm 2 is slowly dying, until VTM:B 2 was announced it wasn't too well known and Spec Ops The Line is glossed over by most as ""just another third person shooter""."
AskReddit,fek7ysh,t3_epj6tg,1579194497.0,"This doesn't go for all women but some women expect men to not show any emotion or they are not ""a real man"", but they are encouraged to show their emotions.

Again, this doesn't go for all women, and women that actually understand that a man is a human too are great, but some women just don't understand that concept, which is quite sad."
AskReddit,fek7hdi,t1_fek3i1k,1579194208.0,"I'm going to leave it like that now, hopefully more people will start playing Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines Spec Ops: The Line Rising Storm 2: Vietnam :)"
AskReddit,fek796m,t1_fek6wbi,1579194070.0,"It wasn't too well known until the sequel was announced, then a lot more people heard of it. Until then it has a relatively small but loyal following, at least as far as I remember."

nihilism,fegj15j,t1_feg09hc,1579094273.0,Do you believe it to be reprehensible?
nihilism,fegiuo4,t1_fefs9xx,1579094118.0,This. Not only that but certain idiots will just spout out useless edgy paragraphs that don't amount to anything and only serve to attract attention to themselves and make themselves seem intelligent.

VietnamWar,fecusu2,t1_fec8asn,1578985463.0,"I wouldn't be surprised, as it's the Air Cav we see with the death cards on that movie anyway. But surely if a load of them were ordered to be made and shipped over to Vietnam, it is possible a couple other units had them too?"
VietnamWar,fecupxe,t1_fecctev,1578985371.0,"Yeah I believe that is the specific card they would make packs of. Not sure if they made death cards of any of the other suits or whatever, pretty sure it was just the Ace of Spades because of the symbols history in the American military."
VietnamWar,fe9vpkb,t1_fe8ylvi,1578941826.0,"Yeah it doesn't seem like it was ever a widespread thing, but it would be cool if there were any of the cards left around somewhere, if only for history's sake."
VietnamWar,fe9ul35,t1_fe85c0b,1578941593.0,"I'm talking more about the ones that had messages written in Vietnamese that were left on the corpses of dead Viet Cong to try and scare their comrades who would later find them, but of course some supposedly wore them on their helmets, even know for obvious reasons THAT would have been rare."
movies,fe7iwnu,t3_enw1du,1578915166.0,Funny considering it was the critics that gave Joker bad reviews and tried saying it would inspire real-world violence. Changed their tune haven't they?

nihilism,fctr1ei,t1_fctd9jw,1577955059.0,"You can have your opinion, that's fine. You can be just as content as religious people with your life despite being a nihilist. I look at it as seeing as there is nothing after death and we are not even a spec in this universe, you don't have to worry about anything unimportant. You can find something you enjoy doing in life and that makes you happy, and so long as you aren't making other people's lives miserable then you can one day leave this world satisfied and be able to say it was a good ride. It also means you are more likely to make this life count if you know this is all you've got. But I'm rambling."

nihilism,fctm7hk,t1_fct36qz,1577948587.0,"If you think making a thread titled 'nobody is forcing you to live' and saying things like 'you can kill yourself' isn't encouraging suicide then you are already behold help. Telling me I'm holding a sermon to try and act like an internet tough guy doesn't help, either, but it was funny nonetheless."
nihilism,fct098k,t1_fckmole,1577929533.0,Yes and the fact that this subreddit is flooded with edgelord idiots that think being a nihilist makes them a cool and special snowflake are missing the whole damn point.
nihilism,fct01nj,t3_ei63l3,1577929386.0,"Don't encourage people to kill themselves. What kind of sick puppy are you? Believing in nihilism doesn't mean you should go around telling people they can ""just kill themselves"". I'm not saying always try and play hero because people die and that's just the way it is, but encouraging someone to take their own life is just disgusting."
nihilism,fcszd5u,t3_eiha5f,1577928907.0,"Why do other people's celebrations bother you so much? If you celebrate, then good for you. If you think it's pointless good for you too. No point getting worked up over it, just comes off as you trying too hard to be nihilistic over something that really doesn't matter and doesn't affect your life."
AskReddit,fcrhz4m,t3_eigp35,1577902060.0,"If someone happens to be quiet or shy this is the worst thing you can possibly say to them. 

They are constantly worried that they are looked down upon for their shyness and not engaging in conversation so when they finally push themselves to speak up and you say this to then, you are basically telling them that regardless of whether they talk or not, they are not accepted, which is an awful message to send to someone.

You will then discourage them from talking again and they'll be back to square one."
