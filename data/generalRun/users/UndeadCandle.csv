I understand everyone makes mistakes and stuff. I just read it and became ""Emotionally Triggered""

Just happy it's not happening over and over again. So thanks for letting me know it got shut down.  I've made a few mistakes too while learning."

This should be a thing.

Isn't this just a gateway to a more severe gambling problem?

Hard to explain but I'll try.

many people when learning a new language. they try to translate it into their own familar language and by doing so create a 3rd mashed up non-language that needs to be learned in order to advance.

Learning to think in a language is as important as learning the words themselves.


Another way to explain.

Does the phrases come to mind in English then gets processed into Spanish and you speak the Spanish phrase..

... or does the thought express itself in Spanish. Skipping the English conversion almost entirely

Anecdotal but this was the problem with many other students in my russian language class. They were  trying  to learn and practice 2 languages in order to learn 1 language."
aww,fct20b5,t1_fct0gsx,1577930811.0,"I honestly think feral/domesticated cats succumb to peer pressure and mob mentality when it comes to people.

Have a cat do a trick for a treat in front of another cat that wants that reward and it will learn that trick by watching the other cat fairly quickly. 

If those other ferals saw and wanted something that first friendly received... domino effect and motivation."
