Sure, you’ll see shit bourbons for $10-20 a fifth, but that’s more forgivable than buying a $55-60 bottle and it just being bad.

One of my favorite theories on that part is that Gan/Ka forcibly broke the Ka-Tet at that moment, because their job was done. They had saved the beam, which meant the Tower would survive. Left alone long enough, the beam would repair itself, plus would revive and repair other beams, too. By stopping the breakers, they had accomplished why the Tet was formed. 

Gan knew that Roland would never cease in his quest to reach and summit the Tower, so he tries to stop him from continuing, by killing off the other members, to get him to give up his goal. Possibly, to break him of the continuation of the resetting. It’s not the most ironclad theory, but I’ve always loved it."

(TL;DR - Excellent BP offering that is pretty widely available. Definitely worth the try and I’ll seek to replace with a new batch once I polish this one off.)

Review #3 - Elijah Craig Barrel Proof Batch A119

ABV: 67.6%

Color: Mahogany 

Price:  $64.99 for a 750ml bottle 

Served: Neat, in a Glencairn, from a 3/4 empty bottle that’s been open for roughly 8 months. Rested for 25 minutes. 

Nose: Heavy caramel with peanuts. Good amount of oak and some cinnamon and a bit of vanilla. Not a ton of ethanol, which seems surprising for the proof, though the long rest time probably contributes to that. 

Palate: Brown sugar coated peanuts, more vanilla and definitely more cinnamon, almost like a red hot. Has a noticeable burn, but not as overpowering as I would have thought for 67% (or maybe I’m just used to it by now?) 

Finish: Oily and lingering feel. Ethanol burn is there but dissipates quickly. Coats the tongue nicely, while drying it out a bit, with the oak. It’s a nice contrast between the sweeter nose and palate. Cinnamon is consistent throughout. Less peanut on the finish, which leads to some chocolate that was a bit surprising, as I didn’t get that anywhere else.

ECBP was the first Barrel Proof bourbon that I ever bought (2nd whiskey total, first was a Glenlivet Nadurra) and it was definitely something I had to work up to. That being said, once I got to that point, I really did enjoy it. It takes what normal EC does and cranks it up to 11. It’s not something I reach for every day, but when I’m in the mood for a proof bomb, it’s usually what I will grab. 

I know that the A119 is probably harder to find at this point, but if you can snag one that’s still around, I’d say it’s worth the investment. I’ve heard good things about the C919, so when I finish this off, I’ll be on the lookout for that particular batch. 

#Final Score 81/100

0-20: Horrific. Best used to remove rust or cleanse bullet wounds. Tastes like regret. Drain pour the bottle. 

21-30: Used to shoot and get hammered only. 

31-40: Acceptable as a mixer. 

41-50: Would only purchase at a bar if it was the only thing available.

51-60: Would gladly accept as a gift, but wouldn’t buy. Not bad, but not worth my own money. 

61-70: Worth the buy to try, but probably not a second time, unless convinced otherwise. 

71-80: Good to great. Will be a part of the regular rotation. 

81-90: Shelf staple that I’ll strive to always have on hand. Something a cut above the norm. 

91-99: Something truly special. I will always look for this and buy it, unless is 
requires something like a second mortgage. 

100: Perfection. Not even sure if this even exists, but if it does, I’m sure it’s out of my price range."

Review # 7 - Bunnahabhain 12

ABV: 46.3%. NCF & NCA

Color: Light Copper

Price: $54.99 for a 750ml bottle

Served: Neat, in a Glencairn, from a 1/2 empty bottle that’s been open for 2 1/2 months. Rested 15 minutes. 

Nose:  Sweet, definite sherry influence, though not heavy. Raisins and chocolate come to the fore. A little vanilla from the bourbon cask, which helps heighten the chocolate. No ethanol nose tickle at all. 

Palate: More dried fruit/raisin, somewhat grassy (like a cut hay type thing, it’s hard for me to describe) and not nearly as sweet as the nose. A touch smoky, but more from oak char than any peat influence. 

Finish: Fairly thin mouthfeel, but lingers a bit. Oak and dry sherry, little bitterness with sea salt on the end. Think a 90% cacao sea salt chocolate bar and you’d be pretty close. 

This is pretty good all around, although the change from nose to finish is more than I would have expected. This is a whisky that really benefits from not being chill-filtered. I like the change of relatively sweet on the nose, to somewhat dry and lightly bitter on the finish. It’s billed as a lightly peated malt, but if I get smoke from anything, it’s the charred oak. 

This is a solid dram. The only nitpick that I could make is that the finish is a bit thin. It’s good at what it does, for a 12 year “entry malt.” It’s one that I like to suggest to people that have had some of your standard Glens and who want to branch out a bit. It’s not the most complex malt, but it excels at what it’s meant to be.

First off, Michter’s straight rye is a lower rye mash (I think it’s 51% but I’m not 100% on that) and is a great gleans of the two flavors.
