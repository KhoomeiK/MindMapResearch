AmItheAsshole,fd38v6z,t3_ejxs47,1578155801.0,"YTA if Brené Brown got ahold of this one.  

She mentioned a similar scenario in her book *Daring Greatly.* Some parents were chatting about where to hold a meeting and agreeing how one parent had a messy home - so they definitely shouldn't choose theirs. Later, a kid came up and asked a parent - ""Do you feel bad about yourself""?  

The parent was confused. ""Gosh, no, what's wrong?"" Kid says, ""well, you said when people talk badly about others it means they feel bad about themselves.""

Case in point, no? 

It's a judgmental thing but a human thing. I wouldn't want to eat the cake either. But for the *love of god* you couldn't be more tactful about expressing that? "" No thanks, I already had a large amt of sweets recently,"" ""sugar upsets my stomach,"" or just ""no thanks, I'm not in the mood?"" Yikes.

YTA because your actions were unnecessarily harmful and reflective of judgment. Who knows what's going on in her life, btw? Maybe things were really bad that day. Maybe their housecleaner couldn't show up. We tend to see other people's actions as being indicative of their character, but for our own, we judge ourselves by context."

5 minutes into the drive, she drops that she went to jail at the age of 14 because her 23 yr old boyfriend killed her mother and her brother in front of her via hatchet. Story was, while he was chopping wood outside, she told him ""I wish my parents were dead,"" so, he did it. She also went into detail about being involved with a sex cult at a very young age. Morbidly so. She did her time until she was about 30.

I looked up her name once she dropped me off, lo and behold, she was 100% telling the fucking truth. I'll never forget it."
