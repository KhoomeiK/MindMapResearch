Being attractive to the opposite (or same I guess) sex comes from being confident in yourself and who you are. Sure things like whether you look like you can look after yourself helps, but being sure of yourself is the main thing. There is no fate or future you have to accept, and you can change anything you want about yourself. You should read all of Mark Mansons books for some perspective, and see a psychologist or counsellor to help you get some focus on what’s troubling you and how to combat it"

If I were you I would definitely have a think about what you enjoy, what you think you might like to do as a career. You do have plenty of time despite what you think - maybe it’s best to finish what you’re doing as best you can, get through the semester, then think about what you want to do.

I didn’t start uni until I was 26 - there’s no rush! 

As for the social stuff, there’s a cheesy saying that goes “your vibe attracts your tribe.” I wouldn’t focus so much on “I want a girlfriend” but more on “I want to be self confident” - if you are sure of who you are and have confidence in yourself you will absolutely attract people to you. If you seek out people when you are in a bad place mentally, you will only attract people that aren’t good for you.

I can promise you that once you get to uni it will be full of adults and none of that petty school shit. I can also tell you that confidence to talk to others comes from having confidence in yourself. It’s not always easy to achieve, but if you know who you are, what you want and what you stand for, that comes out in your interactions with people.

It’s hard to speak to new people, but if you make an effort and are friendly with people at Uni I promise you that you’ll have a better time. 
I know it’s hard not to dwell on your past - but it is your past - you can’t undo it, all you can do is learn from it and move forward."

selfimprovement,fdgyd2u,t3_elcvoo,1578411335.0,"I can hopefully give you some advice on the uni side of things? My uni had a student support unit where if you had a “disability” you could get extra help. Not sure what exists at your uni but maybe if you talk to the staff or teachers, you can let them know you’ve got some anxiety and it is sometimes hard to make it to class - maybe they can allow you to do things more “digitally” if you’re having a bad day.
I know this doesn’t help you actually leave the house but it might take some of the pressure off if you’re going through a rough patch.

I’m afraid I can’t help much on the other stuff as I go through it myself and I just stay home unless I’m going somewhere familiar. I don’t work or really go anywhere except to get groceries and see my mum/sister. I know how debilitating it is. I wish you lots of luck with it"
