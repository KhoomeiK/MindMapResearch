AskReddit,fdsol83,t1_fdripkv,1578705936.0,Did not know Sabra was owned by them but honestly it was one of the worst hummuses I've ever had when I tried em once. I always get Private Selection (Kroger brand)  Roasted Garlic one which is really good.

foodhacks,fdru6l7,t3_emt273,1578689751.0,As a single person as well I use Almond milk way after the 5-10 days. Think the longest I let it go was about a month and it was still fine. Didn't notice much of a difference taste wise and never got sick from it. Never tried coconut milk but the almond milk seems to last forever which is another reason why I buy it over reg milk.

NintendoSwitch,fdcpcz3,t1_fdcly9u,1578280668.0,I think it's a cool game too from what i've seen. I just think giving anything exercise wise to a person not asking for it would be like getting them a gym membership
NintendoSwitch,fdckzsn,t1_fdckfod,1578277512.0,"It would be if the person is asking for it. It probably wouldn't be if it was just given. Much like anything exercise gift related it may appear to the person to be a ""hint"" that they may be out of shape or overweight which is not a good gift."

gifs,fd64akw,t1_fd5vpjq,1578185331.0,True I suppose but putting the children part aside building this in front of a fridge isn't exactly smart either. People can be just as clumsy as children and it's placement is just asking for trouble.

gifs,fd4st45,t1_fd4seiz,1578170804.0,This may be the worst spot to put something like this especially with kids. The amount of milk and other liquids spilt on the floor would be going through all those cracks and crevices. This just looks like a tiny oh cool moment followed by a constant pain in the ass to keep clean and maintain imo
hotones,fcwtmpt,t1_fcvwxp3,1578037122.0,I mean if it were me I'd have asked for a new box set to be sent out. The prices of these hot sauces are premium so the experience should reflect that. The set comes with stickers and what not that are no doubt ruined along with the rest of the inserts. But again you pay for the premium hot ones experience you should get a clean new set imo
hotones,fcuysb0,t1_fcudl0g,1577991214.0,Did they only replace the 1 bottle or all 3? Just curious cuz having to soak those are 2 bottles to get the caked on classic off them must really ruin the experience.
hotones,fcuyih2,t1_fcu7xul,1577991067.0,Literally 2 tiny pieces of cardboard between the 3 bottles would have prolly saved this thing. Sux that op will have to wait so damn long for a replacement. Hopefully they replace all 3 since he has to wait so long.
GooglePixel,fcjgtui,t1_fcjd1ho,1577687081.0,Sweet! Glad to hear you've resolved the issue even if it is a band aid. Maybe try reinstalling Spotify to see if maybe it's cache needed to be cleared and deleting it did the trick or if the issue begins again  you know for sure it's Spotify then report it to YouTube/Google. That's what I would do but again gratz!
GooglePixel,fciorzy,t1_fcilurb,1577666301.0,Reading online about the issue it's not a pixel specific issue it happens with other phones as well with ytmusic and the yt app apparently.  I've only had it occasionally happen to me while watching YouTube. Some are saying it may be a battery save mode problem. Try turning off any battery saving mode things if you have them on. Others have had the issue with Bluetooth maybe try forgetting  your Bluetooth devices and re-pair them. Also make sure a video or audio isn't activating on the screen in a web page or Reddit because it auto stops when that happens as well. Happening that often though have you tried uninstalling/reinstalling the app?

trees,fcietvb,t1_fch2jpn,1577661475.0,That's wedding cake? How? I've never seen purple in wedding cake esp since it's a cherry pie and Girl Scout Cookie cross. Mines always looked like GSC. I'm a huge fan of pretty much anything purple and that stuff looks amazing.
GooglePixel,fci9ncx,t3_eh63o7,1577659446.0,How does a random pause that very rarely happens (dunno if I've had it happen more than once in a month) make an app pointless to use? Bugs happen nothing is perfect I'm not making an excuse for Google but come on you're being overdramatic about a small bug.

Money is always tight so other than my few needs I don't have the extra to blow on gifts rn
