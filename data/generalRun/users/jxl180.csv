todayilearned,fgimncm,t1_fgijuzo,1580825914.0,"For what crime exactly?


They bought a shit tier consumer/small business plan blindly from a Verizon store and received a shit tier plan.

I have no clue why the fire department went to Verizon in the first place. City Hall most likely has an entire department dedicated to negotiating contracts for private services on behalf of the whole city. None of this adds up."
todayilearned,fgimejd,t1_fgig0fv,1580825735.0,"I don't think anyone said, ""give it for free."" 

They should still pay, but they shouldn't cut corners on mission-critical/life-or-death services.  It doesn't matter how noble your mission is, some business expenses are necessary."

AskReddit,fgh95kq,t1_fggpnvd,1580779590.0,"The Room is a bit different. RHPS has gone on for so long, there's a joke for nearly every line and it becomes a wall of yelling.

For The Room, it's a bit more sporadic. Also, if you're a fan of the screenings, you'd know the movie by heart anyway."
AskReddit,fgh8y1q,t1_fggr0b7,1580779451.0,"My theater has monthly midnight screenings, and it's amazing. 

The audience responses are not nearly as witty as RHPS, but RHPS fans have had 45 years to perfect the jokes."
hockey,fggoret,t1_fggbo9t,1580766287.0,"Correct, but that doesn't change what I said. Being found not-guilty of something due to lack of evidence doesn't mean the accuser is a liar."
hockey,fgfyq7c,t1_fgfm44k,1580750511.0,"They never found evidence that the father was lying, they just didn't find any evidence that the allegation happened.

That doesn't definitively make the father a liar. He's probably a liar, but not proven to be a liar."
AskReddit,fgfweyu,t1_fgfp1ca,1580749082.0,"Nah, I know too many people who have never left the country and never will. Their town is all they need and have no desire to explore beyond it.

madlads,fgbhoyj,t1_fgall5u,1580662196.0,"I know it's going to be in the Olympics. That doesn't mean it's more popular than in the 90s/early 2000s. Maybe globally, but certainly not in the US.

In the 90s, there were movies featuring skateboards, commercials featuring skateboards, every mall had demos and exhibitions, and of course the video games. 

Even my grandmother knew who the famous skaters of the 90s were. 

I can bet serious money that random people will remember the names Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek, Bob Burnquist, etc. but not name a single modern skater. It's just not in the public consciousness anymore. Skaters were mainstream celebrities back in the day - there face would be everywhere including cereal boxes. It's just not there anymore."

At one point, I'm pretty sure X-Games gold would have been more prestigious than Olympic gold. I miss those days."
FunnyandSad,fg6nayr,t1_fg67w9n,1580572382.0,"Everything you listed is why I love hotels over airbnb. 

Also, if you don't want them to clean your room for the duration of the stay, just leave the ""Do Not Disturb"" on for the duration of your stay. Many people do that.

Unless I'm getting an Airbnb that is an investment property, and I get the whole place to myself, I feel like I'm intruding in another person's space and I feel like they are intruding in my space. Hotels are as impersonal as it gets. 

I usually go for hostels, but not because I love meeting new people, but because it's cheap lodging."
SquaredCircle,fg3r5nq,t1_fg3f6gb,1580487887.0,"Not only that, but that sounds like MSRP. I'm sure just like cars, no one pays sticker price of a private jet."
AskReddit,ffxldi3,t1_ffxj2co,1580327486.0,"I disagree. If I post a picture of me at Disney, I'm not doing it for validation - - I do it because I use Facebook for its original intention - a diary of my life, including vacation photos, for friends and family. I guess that could be inherently narcissistic, but I'm not forcing anyone to follow/friend me on Facebook. In turn, I enjoy seeing what's going on in my friends' lives as well."
AskReddit,ffxg1ll,t1_ffxdqzt,1580324414.0,I do the same. I only share it with a friend or two privately. I share it on Facebook if it's part of a vacation album or truly unique to me (like trying alligator gumbo).
AskReddit,ffxdn6r,t1_ffxclbd,1580323005.0,"I'm saying the reader is the insecure one, not always the poster.

Not saying the poster is never insecure, but if you see a picture of a smiling couple on a beach and immediately think, ""I can't believe they are bragging"" instead of being happy for them - - that would be insecurity on the commentor's side."
AskReddit,ffxafyp,t1_ffx9pkk,1580321116.0,"If you see a vacation photo or a restaurant photo and think, ""don't you wish you were me?!"" then that says far more about your own insecurities.

If I post a photo while I'm at Disney World or skiing, that's not me posting to make people jealous. I'm legitimately happy in the moment and wanted to share what's going on in my life with friends and family. 

I (nor you) can force someone to interpret a photo a specific way - - that's completely up to the psyche of the person looking at it.


When I see photos of friends or family on vacation, getting a promotion, having a nice dinner, etc, I'm legitimately happy for them and glad that they included me in their life. That doesn't mean someone else isn't interpreting it as a brag."
AskReddit,ffx8yft,t1_ffx4gj9,1580320231.0,"Fuck me for thinking a nice, well plated meal is artistic.

No one has a problem with people photographing cars, bridges, or any other element of daily life - - why is food the line?

I'm not talking about a picture of a fajita at Chili's, but chefs typically take great pride in their product, and I don't know why I'm shamed for appreciating it before chowing down.

Sometimes it can tell a story. Taking a picture of a dish abroad can really capture the context and exoticism of the vacation."
AskReddit,ffvh4bu,t1_ffveq4s,1580263980.0,"For the same reason opening a restaurant in Times Square will be more expensive than opening a restaurant in Omaha. In a stadium you are *GUARANTEED* 70k+ people surrounding your store. 

Contracts can be written to include anything. Shares of the revenue or even cost caps. Every stadium will do it differently, but typically they are going to charge and arm and a leg for a lease."
AskReddit,ffvdsxg,t1_ffv93bc,1580261766.0,You do know it's the food vendors charging that and not the owners right? They lease the restaurant spaces out. Aramark does the vending for my stadium.
savedyouaclick,ffrxtki,t1_ffrp4ic,1580168342.0,"I've literally only used it to pay at the end. Extremely easy to ignore without having an outburst.

They are so unobtrusive that a server had to show me it was even on the table my first time using it.

Don't want to be advertised to? It's a Red Robin, there are TVs and ads everywhere. You don't go to a Chili's or a Red Robin to escape screens and ads. 

The concept of relying on a server for every mundane task when I'm just trying to eat lunch and go is garbage in my opinion.

A device that let's me check out and leave without having to wait around is anything but garbage in my book."

savedyouaclick,ffr1409,t1_ffqzify,1580148151.0,"Why would you complain about Ziosk?

You can:
A. Flag down the server for the check, wait for them to bring the check, give them your credit card, wait for them to come back with your credit card.

Or B. Swipe your credit card at the Ziosk already at your table and leave."

I appreciate quil18 a lot because he's an expert in 4x grand strategy games (like CKII and EU4) that are so complicated that I can barely get 5 minutes into without being completely lost, so he adds tons of insight and has made tons of tutorial series for them.

People who can't get over the closing of BTJ must be very new to Broadway. Good shows close all the time to make room for new shows. The fleeting nature of Broadway is what makes Broadway so special. 5+ years of a show should not be the norm."
