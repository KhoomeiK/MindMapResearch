- **Kakukaku Shikajika**. Absolutely fabulous manga that has entranced anyone I've shown it to. The only series I could get my ex bf to read and love, along with my sister, friend who otherwise has different tastes etc. It's still a shoujo/josei, but it's really just for everyone. It's very human.
- **Kanata no Astra** for a comedy/mystery series.
- **Spirit Circle** for an intense Mizukami-storyline. It's a bit hard for me to categorize, but it's a seinen/shounen story moreso than shoujo.
- **Jitsu wa Watashi Wa** is a romcom.
- **Pluto** is a sci-fi mystery/crime manga. 
- **Holyland** is super epic, but art style starts out weak but does turn better later on.

All of these mangaka also have other great stories you can read if you like their style. Akiko Higashimura-sensei of Kakukaku mostly has josei/shoujo stories that I did not find as interesting, though."

Only downside is the pickpocketing sometimes (rarely, but happens) fails and they will attack you and break your stealth.

Here's how you can make the macros:

1. Press the Esc key
2. Click ""Macros""
3. Click ""New"" in the menu
4. Choose and icon and a name, then press ""Okay"" -- the icons are somewhat grouped for each class, so most of them should be close to each other, but it can be a bit of a pain to find the corresponding icons. You can choose any icon, it just makes sense to use the same icons as for the real abilities imo.
5. Write the commands -- The side menu with icons should go away and you can now write in the text box.
6. First line should be: *#showtooltip Ambush*
7. Second line: */cast Pick Pocket*
8. Third and last line should be: */cast Ambush* for your ambush macro, */cast Cheap Shot* for your cheap shot macro etc.
9. That's it! You can now pull the icon from the menu above the text box down to your hotbar and use it like any other ability. 

I always have both abilities with and without pick pocket on my stealth bar so I can choose. Sometimes, especially for higher lvl mobs or I just want to be sure I'm not discovered, I'll just use the regular one, but it's really good in Deadmines where you won't be the first to engage anyway.

Also see a response to my comment for how the full macro will look if it helps.

I occasionally ARAM on my smurf to do missions, and I hate getting stuck on a f2p champ I know I can't play, don't like playing and that isn't good either.
