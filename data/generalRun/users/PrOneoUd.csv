lonely,ff9hjfj,t3_eseca8,1579713149.0,"We matter as much as statistics matter. Nothing but numbers. We have no support, nobody to talk to, nobody would care if we suddenly passed out and died. We go day in and day out working a shitty job or lying in the dark trying to end this miserable life sooner. Help for those who have mental illnesses is nearly nonexistent and includes only maintenance. While everybody is out there having fun, we are toiling away just to reach the basic level of existence.

And saying you are not alone is worst of all. It's like getting left behind in shark infested waters and the operator just says: 'don't be scared, you're not the only one in this situation'. While you try to squeeze out the meagre comfort out of that fact, you get dismemmbered and eaten alive. Helpful, isn't it?"

depression,ff2lsbz,t3_er4unf,1579512211.0,"It's called perfectionism. We, as a society, are attempting to reach the most perfect way of living possible - aka 'nobody dies, loses their progress, gets ostracized, etc.' It is the desire for everybody to have equal chances in life, but that also means that nobody wins and life is bland and boring. Those who do win (because complete equality is impossible) win big and never allow others to reach their level, no matter what it would cost them, because the more the people the harder it is to get to the top again and life is unsatisfying when you are not important. 

In nature, half the pop would die out from random diseases, being an outcast, pregnancy, lack of nutrition, etc. Very few would remain and they would be highly treasured no matter their ability, hence the closer social bonds and such. Nowadays, you don't die, you just disappear.

depression,ff2l4c7,t3_er3zts,1579511218.0,"Life is meaningless and pointless, that's why people practice meditation. They can get rid of unwanted emotions and feel like they are living forever, because they are only alive at that exact moment. There is nothing else. This is practically the simulation of an animal's mindset. Some even manage to off themselves through meditation, but that takes years of mastery to accomplish.

It is a fact that only we, humans, are cursed (or blessed) with the perception of time. We had to adapt this way, because we sucked as hunters and the only way we could survive is by planning and saving food for later. Just like squirells evolved to hide away the nuts for later (even though their ability is still primitive compared to us and they forget most of the hiding spots). This ability eventually grew into a realization that nobody survives, nobody stays young forever, future is inevitable. You have to worry about the future your entire life.

This creates lots of unnecessary suffering. You feel the pain as if it already happened before it actually does. 

A gazelle never worries about its death. It thinks that it was that poor shmuck that'll die, the slowest, the omega, but it will live on forever. It feels free and strong and great. Never does it occur to it that it will too grow old and become the omega."

SuicideWatch,femnpty,t1_femn0iv,1579263948.0,"Life is boring. Everybody's life is more or less the same. Chemicals drive our brains to do things we don't want, like a puppet on a string, and the end is always the exact same garbage. Nothing happens randomly, if you don't deserve something you're not getting it. So you just slave away and then never enjoy the things you've earned because it took so long and so much energy to get there. Then you slave away for something else. And the cycle never ends.

All I've been doing my entire life is watching movies, playing video games, reading stories, news, websites. All of them follow the same storyline and are predictable and boring. Go through all of that effort in increasing your social value until you get a suitable mate, the mate eventually grows cold, you divorce/slave away through life, raise your children in hopes of making them truly special, but any strategy you apply produces the exact same results. And even if by some off chance they do become geniuses, they'll eventually off themselves cuz they couldn't fit in with their peers.

depression,fem7b5p,t3_epwjgk,1579242332.0,"In my experience, meditation is the closest to death you can get without actually dying. At some point of simply watching your feelings and thoughts go by, you start to feel like you don't exist at all. Like you've died. You gain a skill of manually shutting down your brain but still being able to observe.

Or if you want something more sensual, try cold showers. They are healthy to an extent and can be highly unpleasant."
depression,fem6v0s,t3_epw75o,1579241857.0,Sushi. There's hundreds of variations to try.
depression,fem6pli,t3_epw70l,1579241698.0,"Yea cuz it's not heckin normal and people immediately feel the overwhelming sense of responsibility. Imagine if somebody ran up to you in a street, handed you a baby and told you to take care if it, even though you have no experience with taking care of anything, it isn't *yours* and you have no idea how long this is going to last.

They start watching their words very carefully and that is exhausting af. If somebody does spare their time to go out and communicate with people these days, they never do that as a job, only as a way to relax.

Also, remember that one person you feel tremendous amount of pity for (for example, a war veteran amputee with no family who lives in the streets), picture them talking about that part of their lives that makes you feel bad for them (what it's like to be homeless, to not have legs). What would you do? What would you say? Even if they are used to it and simply want to chat, to you it will seem like they are burning in hell and there's nothing you can do about it, neither do you want the same happening to you, so you simply run away from those feelings.

SuicideWatch,fegfum2,t1_fegev59,1579091353.0,"Thanks, I've been thinking about this for a while. 

After battling addictions for nearly my entire life (I'm 21),having no social life and all the time in the world to think, I came to a conclusion that wherever we go, whatever we do, nothing really matters because all of that social approval, all of that success and wealth are just a bunch of chemicals driving our monkey brain around to do things that in the end will have zero use to us. We're all going to die and no matter how famous or wealthy - *nobody cares*. Nobody loves you more just because you achieved more. No, all they do is want what you have and try to buddy in with you to steal your secrets. Sure, you might get a fancy funeral, but soon you'll be nothing but yesterday's news.

Minimum wage, streets, asceticism, on the other hand - train your mind and body, make you more resilient, imaginitive, spiritual and healthy (depending on your attitude and calorie restriction was proven to prolong lives of mice in some studies). People that actually talk to you are not the shallow backstabbing kind who get bored easily, but those who can look past the material nonsense everybody follows around in a mad rat race. Things become real. No more hiding around, no more nonsense. People show their true faces. Experiences become real and not just mindless rituals to reach that one promotion, score a date or buy that piece of furniture.

Even if life does become boring this way, I'll know that I'm living an authentic life and am not wasting my energy to buy things I'll throw out into garbage next month. I'll actually be doing something that feels like it's making a difference, not doing the endless, hopeless battle of the minds to reach higher ground."

SuicideWatch,fegcrmt,t3_ep0hfc,1579087945.0,And then it comes to the question of whether you do actually want to fix your life? Or are you being chased by the never ending fear of being worse than the rest? It is very hard indeed to achieve anything when you feel no passion or playfulness towards it.
SuicideWatch,fegcngm,t3_ep0hfc,1579087806.0,"I agree with you completely, but I'm gonna say that a year of doing one habit won't change your life that much. I've started cycling every morning for 2 hours, and only after a year and a half did I finally saw any results, managed to cycle up that hill and stopped being so exhausted every day. This can be simply explained by the fact that my lifetime of bad diet and my life that was completely devoid of exercise prevented any results from appearing straight away. 

You know - your entire body has to be reshaped for exercise after all it was being used for is sitting around. If you desire real results, you'll have to meditate or practice therapy for *years*. 10 000 hour rule. The same thing applies to playing an instrument. Unless you do it 10hrs a day you will always screw up during the competition. Only no distractions, no switching out to try something else works.

Of course, children have an easier time mastering things, but it's too late for that now. Also, a question: how many hours a day do you spend in a bad mood? You can't expect a smaller amount of time to fix that."

All that is left is the patterns of neurons within your brain that hurt you anytime you get close to doing what you want. These neurons can be reprogrammed if you create a new narrative for yourself (same story, different perspective) and practice various techniques, such as CBT or neuro-linguistic programming.

Now, someobody in your place would likely just give up and let those neurons take over, then make them disappear from the world and existence via escapism and other means. What are *you* gonna do? You can choose whatever, because the world will only care if you become visible."

Should a person, a sentient human being, somebody who has the same needs as you and I, suffer through years and years of silence, of being unnoticed, unappreciated, unloved, a nobody with no future just because some people will mourn them for a few months but will never even scratch the surface of real suffering, especially since they'll be mourning together? Remember the saying - shared pain is halved? There *is* no sharing the pain when it is inside you only. You take the full brunt.

And say, they do not kill themselves. What happens? They disappear out of memory, they fade away into nothingness while still alive. Nobody needs them, nobody cares for them. They get older and more desolated. What little suffering you feel while grieving for someone you barely know does not even begin to compare to the amount of suffering somebody who was not made for life feels throughout the entirety of, what, 50 years they have to live with it."
