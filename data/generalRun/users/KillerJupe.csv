When I’m driving home late and she decided her turn to “make dinner” is calling in pizza for me to pick up.
Often times I’ll get home and she will just be showering and I can hear her yell.... “ma’ meatloaf!” But I know what she means.
I should just bring her meatloaf sometime :)"

Spearfishing,fem9l8l,t3_ehyl6a,1579244869.0,"I live in the bay area and spear on scuba.

I often see free divers come out w/ more smaller and more random fish (blue rock fish/ perch) vs on scuba.

I'll go for one type of fish and if I don't see it or don't see one of a good size, I don't take it.  FOr me, on scuba it feel like less pressure to pull the trigger and really think about if i want to take the shot.

I see both sides of the argument, but for me it comes down to I love diving and being able to cruise around and look at all the little things.  Freediving, doesn't give me as much opportunity to look around and relax."

WTF,fekztak,t1_fekbie4,1579211027.0,"Having been lit on fire once in a similar work spill accident... let me explain the though process.

At first you think people are yelling about the fire on the floor not realizing its on you too, as your clothes protect you from the heat.  

Then you realize its on you but its only small... NBD it can be patted out easily as you don't wanna look like an idiot rolling around making it a bigger deal.... t

Now you realize it's getting hot and spreading, everyone is yelling something different at you as the flames spread.  Panic is in full force at this point.

Since you were already in patting and jumping around mode, you kinda lock onto that option of swatting/jumping around more and everyone else is doing that to you too.  it becomes this vicious cycle of you doing it, others doing it and everyone reinforcing the wrong action. 

Then someone who was farther away and had a few seconds to think before reacting comes over and blasts you w/ a CO2 extinguisher salvaging what little dignity you had left.

Basically they had target fixation."
