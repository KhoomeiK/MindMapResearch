The ears look more comic related,and the silver is in all the right places.The mask is ok,but it doesn't top civil wars mask. If they had made the eyes on the new one more angry looking, then it might be a bit better,but still. I do understand where everyone else is coming from though. The old one was more down to earth, and equip for hand to hand combat. But, the thing is,the enemy's that are showing up are FAR beyond down to earth. I can't see him fighting thanos,Galactus, or any space level threat in the old suit at all,no matter how hard I try. It might not be too apparent people,but this new suit is highly necessary."

I know you got to look on the inside and trust me I've TRIED. You can not tell me you wouldn't book it, if you saw this dog running toward you. The eyes fuck me up too much.
