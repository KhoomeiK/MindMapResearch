Calculus AB and BC is integration and derivatives. The problem gives you a velocity function, and they want to to derive a position function from it via integration (or, if you know your physics, you already know the formula to use)

Of course calculus has a lot more uses than this. This is just a straightforward real-world example at the start of the lesson.

To solve it you integrate v(t) to get 30t - 4.9t\^2 + C, and the C is just the 100 m. Then you enter 4 into that integrated formula, and find out how much it's displaced from the initial start at 100m."

That gave me a little snicker.

Anyways, their study found a correlation between these videos and [arousal](https://dictionary.apa.org/arousal) in general. Pupil size is not just related with sexual arousal specifically. APA actually keeps the definitions of arousal and sexual arousal completely separate. Arousal in psychology and neuroscience is very often not referring to the sexual kind. From what I can tell, they're kind of bending the indicator to mean what they want it to mean.

The locus coeruleus in the reticular activating system regulates arousal in many parts of the brain via norepinephrine, and it's typically what you'll hear as the cause for [non-luminance-mediated pupil dilation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4707070/) (i.e. not caused by changes in lighting but, rather, changes in arousal).

They merely proved that watching these videos increased arousal in general, which doesn't have to be sexual per se. In fact, you might observe the same kind of change if you just sat the person in front of an action-packed sci-fi film or something.

Nonetheless, if sexuality is essentially a spectrum, it makes perfect sense that just about no one is perfectly straight. It's a statistical anomaly to be *perfectly* average in a spectrum, in fact. Sure, that's more common than all the other options (assuming mean = mode, as in a normal distribution) but it's still unlikely. 49.999% are more than average, 49.999% are less than average, and only .002% *are* average, for example. 

This makes sense. There's a lot of nature and nurture that can influence a person's sexuality in minuscule ways, which lead to slight or extreme deviations from the mean. This isn't a bad thing, it's what makes us all unique."

explainlikeimfive,ff54cob,t1_ff52scu,1579579878.0,"Yup, absolutely. The human brain is like the black box of machine learning. We can understand key nuclei, neurotransmitters, and other formations, but we don't truly understand how the things inside the black box work.

We do know where the consciousness is contained, though, since we can study individuals with impairments in different parts of the brain and observe how conscious they are. We just don't know exactly how that black box works, aside from saying, of course, that it's just the collective effect of billions of neurons.

But that is certainly not a satisfying answer and, frankly, I don't think we will ever understand just what goes on inside that box. The brain, when studied on that level, becomes too complicated to understand, and (on the level of individual synapses and neurons) it can vary quite a lot from person to person."
explainlikeimfive,ff50ck9,t3_ero7oy,1579576839.0,"Consciousnesses is the collective effect of billions of neurons in the cortex, especially the frontal lobe.

How conscious you are is decided by how many neurotransmitters squirt out of the reticular formation. This regulates something called mental arousal (not in a sexual way). For example, you are aroused when someone jump-scares you, and you are fairly unaroused when you're sitting around doing nothing, not even thinking.

We know that arousal -- and consciousness -- goes away when the reticular formation decreases in effect.

In neuroscience, consciousness is just an ""illusion"" resulting from all of these neurons firing. In general, the deeper and lower into the brain  you go, the less conscious it is, and the less ""you"" (i.e. the cortex) is actively aware of it.

For example, when you balance on one leg, are you consciously saying to yourself ""okay, move a little more this way -- wait, wait, less"" etc.? You aren't, but your brain is still doing that. Balance is handled really low in the head, in the cerebellum.

In short, your awareness exists in the cortex. The very scientific (and depressing) idea is that your presence is nothing more than the collective effect of billions of neurons in the cortex. It is believed that the development of this cortex occurs in a way similar to machine learning, which you can look into. Basically, strong synapses are equivalent to having a higher weighting, and they are more likely to fire and have a significant effect. The variability in synapse strength, in theory, is what allows for the development of a functioning brain. 

Of course, if you are a little more spiritual about it, then you can read up on the *soul*, which is basically the spiritual version of the neuroscience concept of consciousness."

I believe you feel this way because you understand that there's a lot that you don't know. 

The [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) occurs when a person is just ignorant enough on a subject to think that they know everything. You are the opposite of this.

 This thought has echoed throughout history countless times for a reason:

> *One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing.* 

One of the interesting things about humans is that we aim to attain what we do not have, rather than enjoying what we do have, and that is what occupies our minds nearly every day. We do this for both material and intellectual things. Artists do not constantly sit back and stare at the incredible artworks they've made: they are always moving from one work to the next. A shopping addict, much like a drug addict, constantly seeks the stimulation associated with the next purchase, or the next ""hit."" They hardly take the time to enjoy the things that they have.

In your case, you don't stop, take a seat, and take in just how far you've come. Instead, you focus on what you are not. You focus on the people who are better than you in certain respects, instead of focusing on how far you've come and the things that you are better at.

Listen, you or I will never be the greatest of all time. That goal is unobtainable, and would require us to be 1 of 7.5 billion to be the overall greatest person here on earth. However, we need to express genuine gratitude of just how much we do have, and just how far along we are. Did you graduate from highschool? Are you literate? Can you count? Do you know how to use a phone or a computer? Do you still have control over your hands or feet?

Everyone has so much to be grateful for, but like an addict on a shopping spree, they don't focus on the clothes already in their closet but, rather, the clothes in the store. 

This attitude is somewhat necessary but also pernicious at the same time. This is what drives us to constantly learn more, but it is also what leads us to this mental dissatisfaction that you talk about. 

To find satisfaction in life, you need to divert some of your attention away from the pursuit of knowledge and instead towards truly enjoyable things (although don't divert all of it, of course). Instead of memorizing that Wikipedia article, learn how to play guitar. The guitar will be a source of fulfillment time and time again.

You and I both have to accept that we will never be the smartest people on earth. However, that must not bar us from happiness and the recognition of what we do have."
explainlikeimfive,ff4nvvu,t3_ermdh0,1579568179.0,"How long you can fast depends on your health, your body fat percentage, and your weight. 

[Angus Barbieri fasted for 382 days straight](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Angus_Barbieri%27s_fast). He had lost 276 pounds during that. Some of that weight was likely muscle, but let's say that 250 of it was fat. There's about 3600 calories in a pound of fat. So, he burned off roughly 900,000 calories. That is 2356 calories used a day, on average. The big thing that you have to realize is that, for a person like this, weight loss starts off fast but quickly diminishes as a person enters starvation mode, as their muscles break down somewhat, and as their basal metabolic rate generally decreases as a result of the decreased weight. 

Whatever the case, you can calculate a person's amount of fat, find out how many calories are stored in that fat, and find around how many days a person can survive. Body fat percentage is total fat divided by body mass. So just multiply the person's body fat percentage by their weight and voila, you have the number of lbs of fat a person has. 

An average (American) man might have 24% body fat. So, do .24 \* 170. He has 40lb of pure fat. That's 146,880 calories. 

As he loses weight, his basal metabolic rate falls. This means that he'll be quickly approaching starvation at first, but slowly approaching starvation after a while. [Using just some random online calculator](https://www.active.com/fitness/calculators/bmr), I calculated BMR at various points for a 5ft 10"" 25 yr old man:

* 170lb: 1845
* 160lb: 1782
* 150lb: 1720
* 140lb: 1658
* 130lb: 1595

He must not go any lower than 130lb, since, remember, he originally had 40lb of fat (130 + 40 = 170). 

I will interpolate these data points in Desmos with a linear regression line. f(x) = 6.24x + 784. This means that, for every pound he gains, his BMR increases by 6.24 calories. Conversely, for every pound loss, his BMR decreases by 6.24.

So, the rate of calorie loss, or dy/dx, is 1845 - 6.24x, where x is the number of pounds lost thus far.

So, the number of calories he has remaining is 146,880 - integral of (1845 - 6.24x)

The integral is just something used in math to find the collective, compounding effect of something over time. If we know a function modeling how fast usain bolt runs, for example, we can take integral of that to find how far he's run. Same idea here.

Doing that, the result is:

146,880 - 1845x + 3.12x\^2

He will be out of calories when that equals 0. That will happen in:

94 days

If he is the average person I describes (24% bf, 5' 10"", no exercise, 25yr) He can probably survive that 40 day fast.

With all that said, I wouldn't reccomend it, for nutritional reasons. Malnutrition can very possibly kill him before that. However, with the right nutrition and supplementation, it is possible (exemplified by Angus Barbieri)."

Sounds like dissociation, though. Not dissociation from identity, mind you -- that's different (in a very rare disorder called dissociative identity disorder, formerly known as multiple personality disorder).

Dissociation from reality -- as opposed to having a skewed view of what reality is in the case of psychosis -- is, in your case, called derealization. A person suffering from derealization disorder feels this way that you described, and it is ""persistent or reoccurring,"" ""patients know that their unreal experiences are not real (intact sense of reality)"" and ""symptoms cause significant distress or significantly impair social or occupational functioning."" That's according to DSM-5.

White noise is a form of [dithering](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dither) (that's not a psychology term, that's a sound/image processing term) that masks any sudden disturbances. In fact, that's the point of dithering in signal processing. To cover up sudden, unnatural, and jarring variations in digital signal, dithering is often used. The vacuum cleaner masks all other noise that were keeping you mentally aroused, like the cars honking outside, ambulance driving by, birds chirping, etc.

The other thing is that white noise continually stimulates your brain, replacing wandering thoughts (which, without noise, would be your mind's way of dealing with low stimulation -- this is the basis of the [low arousal theory](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Low_arousal_theory)) with simply meaningless noise. This noise thus masks all auditory information coming into the brain, replacing it with meaningless information.

The auditory cortex is having a heyday, but it's sending nothing up to the cortex. This is why white noise is quiet background noise that you are barely consciously aware of. The cortex is thus underaroused and you get that unconscious state (unless you make up for it by mulling over a particularly interesting thought, are skydiving, or watching a movie with lots of action).

Anyways, this is an oversimplification of human consciousness.

Considering that you took the time to post about it, it sounds like this problem is having a significant impact on your life. For that reason, you really should see a psychologist about this."

World-wide, verbal assault is effectively unenforced because it cannot easily be enforced. Unless, of course, we plant microphones and cameras everywhere. Not to mention that the blurred line between what is harassment and a not-so-politically correct joke (for example) becomes a concern.

explainlikeimfive,fekztvl,t3_eppux5,1579211037.0,"The point of an aperture (or small opening), aside from limiting the amount of light thus darkening the image, is to also focus light. If light rays are not being focused well, an aperture in front of the eye can limit the physical size (and shape) of the light rays before they even reach your eyeballs.

Pinhole cameras work entirely on this principle. To focus these relatively enormous light rays that have extrapolated out into sizable [circles of confusion](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Circle_of_confusion), a small pin-hole is used. The other option is to try to focus these large rays of light back down to a point using a lens-- your eyes aren't able to do this when you have bad vision.

In that way, the physical size of the light ray circles of confusion are bottlenecked even before they enter your eyeballs.

This is why cheap photography lenses can be made sharp just by decreasing the size of the aperture.

The alternative view on this is that squinting deforms the shape of your cornea slightly, just enough to get it to focus again.

The reason why I don't go with the latter perspective  (and banhofzoo's) as much is because you can actually mimic the effect of squinting just by making a tiny hole with your hand, and placing that tiny hole in front of your eye. Voila! You now have a sharp (but darker) image -- and you didn't even touch your face. So most or all of this effect can be attributed to the pinhole effect, and not much else.

Put simply, game engines use tricks to mimic reality. I won't go into it, but you can read about [OpenGl](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/OpenGL) and other APIs for rendering 3D graphics. They don't project a crap ton of particles to test how the materials react, that's for sure. 

Of course, Ray Tracing is kind of making its way into games with Nvidia RTX. Although it's still really taxing on system resources. 

I will also add that renders do things the right way, and games use tricks. Games will use parallax displacement and normal maps to create the illusions of bumps on a surface; for example, bricks ""protruding"" out of a wall. They're not actually protruding, they just look like it. In the 3D render world, you'll actually extrude out each individual brick without using trickery. It looks better, but uses way more polygons.

The windchill factor happens because, without any breeze, energy transfer is pretty slow between you and the outside world. This is because newton's law of cooling: the rate of cooling is proportional to the difference in temperature between the two bodies. Normally, when you're sitting still and there's no wind, air particles remain relatively in place around you, accepting heat quickly at first, but then starting to slow after a moment or two. To cool something down, the goal is to keep the air particles from entering that slow energy transfer rate.

So how do we prevent this? We keep blowing the old air particles away as they heat up, refreshing warm air with new, cold air. According to Newton's law of cooling, these cold air particles are going to suck heat energy up really fast.

Therefore, movement and/or wind makes you colder. Your thermoreceptors in your body are able to easily and suddenly pick up on this. 

On top of this, when your arm suddenly starts colliding with air at an increased rate, your mechanoreceptors are able to pick up on this.

We can't say for sure, but it seems to be real.

explainlikeimfive,fe0iwfd,t3_enkabk,1578814107.0,"Cameras take discrete frames, whereas [our eyes continuously capture light using a biological process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvovtbLGaUw). Let me elaborate.

A camera always has a shutter over top the sensor when you're not using it. When you take a photo, the camera drags a small sliver of opening over top the sensor,[like this](https://youtu.be/CmjeCchGRQo?t=165). That exposes the sensor to just enough light.

To do video, that process is repeated 30 times per second.

The problem is when you get motion.

Cameras can shoot at really fast shutter speeds -- i.e., how long the sensor is exposed to light. For example, 1/4000th of a second. When you do this 30 times a second, the individual pieces of snow are frozen in place. Stutters result, because your eye can tell that the pieces of snow are jumping from spot to spot. Keeping the shutter open longer allows the pieces of snow to drag across the sensor, introducing blur. This blur smooths it out and makes it less jarring. So, if you set up your camera just right, snowfall can look normal.

The other reason why it is hard to capture snow is because a DSLR can have an exceptionally shallow depth of field. This means that only one small teeny tiny plane can be in focus at once. Everything else is super blurry. This is a problem when capturing snow, since the likelhood of snow falling EXACTLY in your plane of focus is unlikely. Therefore, 95% of snow is all blurry, and only like 5% is sharp and visible on camera.

This is different from what *you* see, because your pupil constricts when you go outside (because it's so dang bright). This smaller opening means that your eye -- when outdoors -- has incredible depth of field. It's able to get EVERYTHING in focus. So like 80% of the snow will look nice and sharp and visible to your eye."
NoStupidQuestions,fe0f0yt,t3_enjtui,1578812267.0,"It is a rational thought to say that a tattoo is pretty permanent and costly to remove, and it is rational to say that it [hurts job opportunities.](https://www.salary.com/articles/tattoos-hurt-chances-getting-job/)

Older people know long term regret better than young people for obvious reasons.

With that said, they can also be ignorant to the potential value of self expression, which their generation didn't really recognize. So your perspective is also valid.

Moreover, [there are some researchers](https://hbr.org/2018/11/a-tattoo-wont-hurt-your-job-prospects) who have found that tattooed people earn an almost identical amount of money. The only problem with their research is that they used MechanicalTurk, which you would only use if you were a low or mid income person looking to work a small job on the side. A person making six figures wouldn't be busy answering surveys to make a couple extra bucks. So it's possible that having a tattoo on your face, for example, might not hurt your prospect at blue-collar jobs, but it could hurt your prospect at white-collar ones.

[On this survey](https://careers.workopolis.com/advice/research-reveals-how-your-tattoos-affect-your-chances-of-getting-the-job/),  35% of employers surveyed said that whether or not they care about tattoos depends on ""the role I was trying to fill."" E.g. maybe they wouldn't want you working with customers. 28% said that it would depend on how many tattoos and where they were. 13.85% said that yes, they would outright be less likely to hire them. Only 22% said it wouldn't matter. All and all, about 76% of employers said that it may or will be taken into consideration.

**Tattoos should not be seen as a bad thing. They're simply a way of expressing yourself. Unfortunately, many employers and people think that they are a bad thing, and they look down on it. I'm not saying that's how it should be, but that is how it is. But don't let others decide your life. Just take into consideration their viewpoint, while also considering yours.**"

I hope the original poster asked the kid more than once to double check, but really there was no avoiding it. The kid would've repeated ""Weed,"" and sometimes their name is what they say it is. By the third time, it becomes disrespectful to the person. If your name truly was Weed, imagine how annoying and sad it would to have to repeat your name three or more times to a person. It serves as a reminder of how weird your name is.

There are many people with weird or unfortunate names out there, everything from ""Dikshit"" to ""Wang Liqin."" Sometimes the most respectful thing to do is to not make a big deal out of it and move on."
facepalm,fdzl2a5,t3_en6ikf,1578791189.0,"I once did this to a person, but for months. I thought she said her name was ""Lean*d*a.""  I could've sworn I heard a ""d"" in her name when she first told me it. So I went ahead and remembered this name -- the wrong name. After a few months, I begin questioning if I got her name right. It's Bayes' theorem: while I thought I heard Leanda, Leanne is a much more common name. The latter, therefore, could be much more probable. 

One day I asked her about it. She responded ""Leanne,"" and she insists that she never corrected me because she never realized I was mispronouncing it. Oops"

With that said, I wonder what kind of person blue is, and what their emotional state is. The last thing you want at a wedding is someone crying hysterically, ruining everyone's experience. It's going to be painful for blue to explain to everyone why she's no longer pregnant, and everyone else will be focused in comforting her the entire time. In that way, it becomes less of a wedding and more of a funeral. That's thousands of dollars down the drain.

Plain and simple, what white should have said is:

>I just want to make sure that you're doing better now after your loss. People will be asking why you aren't pregnant, so it might be hard. Let me know if you are going to be able to go"
