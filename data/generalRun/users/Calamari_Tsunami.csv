darksouls,fehwj4j,t1_fehvj5n,1579125272.0,I totally forgot O&S! Honestly I think they're perhaps my favourite fight in all the games. I love their aesthetic and their moves. And their moves when fighting both aren't usually too overwhelming. It doesn't feel like a shitty gank as long as you know what you're doing.
