For every one thing like bitcoin that actually gets big, there's a hundred things like beanie babies that are totally worthless later on. Spending on things that might get big later instead of food and bills is absolutely stupid. The people who do that are the same type that go broke buying piles of lottery tickets that end up all worth nothing. 

If you went around spending on things that might get popular, it wouldn't have paid off. If you managed to get anything out of any of those investments, you'd probably just put them into something else, and that thing would end up crashing on you. Then your biggest regret wouldn't be not spending on bitcoin, it would be spending on bitcoin and then losing it all because you invested in juicero or some other failure."

The most boring person I've ever talked to was one where he thought you needed a personal connection with everyone in the story to understand it. 

""So anyway, me and Allen were going down to the bar and- you know Allen, right? You know, works down at the mattress store on 5th? You know, George's son? Don't know George? George, he married Stacy. You know Stacy, moved in from Canada 4 or 5 years back? Works at the nail salon? Stacy, she's Jessica's mom. And Allen's too of course. You know Allen's cousin Bernard, maybe? Lives up in the city?""

He could go on for *hours* like this, trying to find some way in which you knew the guy that knew the guy that knew the guy in the story, for each and every person in it. Oh, but don't think you can escape just by pretending to know the people, no. If you do that you have to listen to a story about how the guy's wife is, and his kids, and his co-workers, and lord help you if you don't also know each and every one of those people.

In the end, when you'd finally get down to the story he was telling, it would just be something like ""Allen and I went down to the bar with Patty and we got so drunk. Patty didn't drink, so we had her drive us home. Isn't that funny! The end."""
AskReddit,ff90lm5,t1_ff8rml9,1579701798.0,"Am autistic. Conversations are hard. I have trouble myself not going on long tangents.

That's a tough one. You have to be direct with autistic people for them to understand you, but if he doesn't respond well to criticism then even that can end up going poorly. I wonder if the having trouble with criticism could be related to the autism as well. Autistic people often get treated very harshly for breaking social rules they didn't know existed or are incapable of following. Being treated like you're always wrong and bad and stupid all the time for everything you do can make you really defensive. Even when someone is trying to be gentle with you, it's easy for your mind to bring back up years of being treated poorly for not following a bunch of vague nonsensical rules no one will even tell you about. 

And there's a chance that even if you say something, he honestly might not be able to stop completely. Sometimes I realize I'm rambling about something, apologize, and go right back into the ramble. I can't help myself. I don't know how to communicate in any other way.

I have an autistic friend who's the same way. We end up basically just taking turns exchanging long rambling text walls about the things we want to talk about. 

So, yeah. That's a really difficult situation to navigate. You could also try bringing up the topic kindly but directly. Maybe focus more on ""when you do that, I feel this way"" instead of ""hey you're bad at conversation."" See if you can find some sort of happy medium between neurotypical conversation and aspie conversation. Or you could try to restructure the conversation as it goes along.

Went through a tough time about a half a year ago. Was constantly stressed about if I'd have anything to eat that night. One week I had nothing but two potatoes a day as my only food for the day, all week. 

I was also having issues with clean drinking water at the time. I had a few mouthfuls of water a day for several days at one point. I was so dehydrated that when I stood, it felt like my brain was a balloon and someone was yanking on the string.

If you have good food and water now, please take a second to appreciate it. Every day since then I've been so thankful for things like the near infinite clean water I have to drink on demand, and not having to worry anymore how long I'm going to have to make a bag of potatoes last. It's amazing to feel secure in the knowledge that all my basics are covered for the foreseeable future."

I mean... yes. Some day if we make space travel cheaper, then people can go launch their own stuff. But at the current cost? It should absolutely be something that requires a country to fund.

I do think we should invest more in space travel and bring many of the amazing ideas individuals have to the technology of space exploration. But no one should be able to fund space ships all on their own."

IncelTears,ff3syj5,t3_ergb9d,1579548177.0,"I am suddenly incredibly glad limb lengthening isn't a thing he can get. It involves badly breaking both your legs, moving the bone an inch or two apart, and then encouraging the bone to grow across the gap. You need to do a lot of work as you recover to ensure you have semi-normal leg function after, and even then you'll probably never be at 100% again.

Quite a few people have had the issue of thinking being a few inches taller will change their lives, surprise it doesn't, and then they neglect the needed recovery work due to their disappointment. Hooray life-long leg problems."
