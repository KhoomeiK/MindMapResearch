CatTaps,ffbyofr,t1_ffbxjon,1579786948.0,Ever have a dream where someone you know did something horrible and you wake up mad? My theory is that this happens and cats have no need to be civilized so they just beat the crap out of each other.

sadcringe,ff38jee,t1_ff38827,1579536217.0,I live in a *really* rural area that up until the 90’s was fairly closed off from the rest of the world. People just didn’t move here because there was no work so lots of backward thinking persisted. Her parents had like eight or nine kids and were dirt poor. I think marrying her off was twofold. Less of a burden on them and *maybe* gettinG out of a shithole town.
