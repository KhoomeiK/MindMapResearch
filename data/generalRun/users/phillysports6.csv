Catholic,ffd5xrl,t1_ffd598n,1579814056.0,"I mean, Catholicism has changed over the centuries.  This is pretty standard knowledge. Apparently you’ve just latched onto what you were taught at a specific age in your life and anything that they try to change past that *must be outrageous and blasphemous*.  Please, grow up.  You do realize that Catholics/Christians believed that women who had sex outside of marriage (even if they were raped) should be stoned to death, right? If religion isn’t meant to be changed, then why was that ever changed? There are plenty of other examples similar to this throughout the history of the Church.  Don’t act like the rules of 1950 (or whatever year you’re attached to) are the rules that have always been and that “omg, why would they only try to change it in *my* lifetime”. C’mon now, the world’s not out to get you like you seem to think."
Catholic,ffczeji,t1_ffcyaq1,1579810400.0,"Again, you can keep telling yourself that. But think about how people look at a crazy old guy that says “things were better back when segregation was legal and women couldn’t vote”, and realize that you’re argument is effectively the same, just about religion rather than culture. Progress is what keeps society going. You can’t keep living with your mind stuck in the past. Well, I guess you can, but just because you want that doesn’t mean everyone else will (or even wants to) think the same."

There’s just something deep down inside me that wants to believe he would have had a *sliver* of hope if he’d left it in.  But alas, it was not meant to be"
Catholic,ffc9dmw,t1_ffc8ut5,1579794523.0,"Listen, I went to Catholic School from kindergarten through high school and it pushed me out.  I don’t care for it, so I don’t really give a shit, in the end.  I was simply pointing out the hypocrisy in picking and choosing what you’re using to back your argument.  It’d be like someone saying that the Articles of Confederation are the real constitution of the US just because it has 1 or 2 points that back their own argument.  Sure, you can try and justify its use, but the government itself doesn’t use it, so it’s really just you jumping through hoops to justify your own thoughts.  You either gotta buck up and accept the newest official doctrines, or realize that no one else will listen to you because you’re stuck in the past."

Don’t get me wrong, I think most career politicians are pretty scummy, and honestly probably shouldn’t exist in the 1st place.  But is that really the best thing he’s done?  Piss some people off?

You said “this happened to me”, which, if we’re referring to the image, would imply you parked over the line and then complained about someone parking too close."
facepalm,fdnq09o,t1_fdnnxh3,1578590674.0,The point of this post is that the person complaining is actually the idiot that parked over the line and got mad for someone parking in their own lines
