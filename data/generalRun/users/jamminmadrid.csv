food,fel9v0q,t3_epnw2i,1579217228.0,I’m not totally read up on wellingtons.  (Forgive my layman terms) What is that between the meat and the pastry?  Is that ground beef?  Or it just the crust of meat?  Either way looks delicious.
ProRevenge,fefb69i,t3_eoliy4,1579052460.0,I don’t really read the stories on here much anymore.  But will always read the IT ones.

coolguides,fdm1xgl,t1_fdleoqb,1578537864.0,Should find one about car companies.  I was blown away when I found out VW owns Audi.
TooAfraidToAsk,fdj5wbf,t3_elg1a9,1578459324.0,"I’m a 31m.  Had to work 12 hour night shifts for 5 months and I don’t sleep well during the day.  Had the novel idea to drag an inflatable mattress in to the walk in closet and shut the door.  To give me some comfort and something to hold on to, I borrowed one of my daughters stuffed stegosaurs.  And it worked!  When I finally went back to days, Spike came with me.

Wife asked me why I still snuggled a toy stego.  Told her we bonded during our time in the closet.  And he helped me from rolling over on to my stomach.  But mostly the bond thing.

Point is, don’t worry about what other people think.  Everyone has something that relaxes them.  You be you.  You came out of your own mold.  Don’t try and force yourself in to someone else’s mold.

And I’d still be snuggling Spike and not this nasty pillow of my daughter had not stolen him back.

Hope this helps."

todayilearned,fd9iwcm,t3_ek9iav,1578234049.0,"I know it will get buried but I don’t know where else to try and ask.  I took my daughter to Home Depot’s workshop the other day and I know in addition to teaching kids, they are hoping that the parents will go, “oh yeah, we need this.”

So my question is, since the workshop is free for the participants, roughly how much would a parent have to spend, assuming 1 child for that family, for the kids workshop to be profitable for Home Depot off of that family."
