pics,fgx4fjp,t3_f0l0br,1581168940.0,Is it a spray tan? Why doesn’t he hire someone to give him an actual spray tan? Does he just go to Ulta and pick a foundation shade that’s too dark and put it all over his face? How did this happen to us?
malegrooming,fgx1vte,t3_f0k0cq,1581168198.0,"Oof these comments are not nice. You have to start as a stylist somewhere, and they hire people right out of school. I worked there right out of school 8 years ago and learned A LOT, and then I moved on to a higher end men’s salon. Everyone starts somewhere."
TrueCrime,fgs67vt,t1_fgrz8uo,1581073572.0,"So I’ve thought about this. Let’s say he smacked her over the head with a flashlight and knocked her out because she came for his pineapple. Her actual cause of death was strangulation, two hours after the blow to her head. So why not just call an ambulance when you find out your son hit her on the head? Say it was an accident. Get her some medical help. Burke was a kid and he probably would have been reprimanded but his sister wouldn’t be dead. I just don’t get it."
TrueCrime,fgs60qg,t1_fgrt1xs,1581073308.0,"When he was on doctor Phil he was smiling awkwardly the whole time, saying that he stayed in bed while the cops were searching the house and his mother was screaming in agony. Just laying in bed, chillin. Go watch the interview, it’s actually creepy the way he smiles. But doctor Phil had a good point in saying, any other 9 year old would hop out of bed hearing all of that and try to see what happened, but the way he stayed in bed made it seem like he already knew."
news,fgrj7na,t1_fgrh6ya,1581048182.0,"The doctor literally prescribed it to the boy before he was sick. They brought a different kid to the doctor and he prescribed the whole family to take it to avoid them getting sick. He then started having seizures and she got on Facebook instead of taking him to the ER. So.. yes, taking Tamiflu before he got sick, like mom was told, could have saved him."
