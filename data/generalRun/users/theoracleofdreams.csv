Currently using [Player.Fm](https://Player.Fm), and I mostly just google for podcasts or use the r/podcasts or r/audiodrama for suggestions.

I only used Spotify once, and realized how limiting it is. I will only us a podcatcher that has the ability to add rss feeds manually. If it doesn't have one, then I won't use it."

He was found wandering a garage, was caught, took in for chip and posted on pawboost. After a month, my coworker gifted him to us (my SO had wanted a ferret for years).

Best and worst decision we ever made. He lived with us 8 years until cancer took him."
