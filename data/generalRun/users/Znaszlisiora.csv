FirearmsHallOfShame,fflhlw9,t3_coj3jk,1580039772.0,Clearly airshit. The kind of people who can afford a real G36 don't have tube TVs in 2008.
GlobalOffensive,ffleo35,t3_eu3pg6,1580038723.0,"And nothing significant came of the unban. All of the iBP squad save for Ska (who got away scot free on a technicality) faded away into irrelevance shortly after their ESL unban. But they sure got to collect on their ""victim"" status!"
TheDickShow,ffhq3le,t1_feyyw2e,1579947898.0,You said you'd pay him. Pay for the bits he did until you said you wouldn't pay for them anymore. You can't just retroactively say you're not going to pay for them if that was the agreement.
TheDickShow,ffhq2ha,t1_fexlr3d,1579947849.0,"Doesn't matter if they were bad or good. If they agreed for the bits to be paid, they should be fucking paid because that's what a man does - follow up on his word."
TheDickShow,ffhpz9t,t1_fersyug,1579947714.0,You're a cuck if you're faithful but your partner ain't. If you're both fucking around you might as well call yourself swingers.

pcmasterrace,fffr1ie,t1_ffcu0q9,1579889936.0,"I don't care if it makes sense, it's a bad name from a marketing standpoint."
Warframe,fffquav,t3_etan9r,1579889813.0,Warframes don't have pubic hair. They're not wearing clothes that you can take off and check. Why did you think this post was a good idea? I want to send this post to your parents so they have a good reason to finally disown you.

GlobalOffensive,feaw4jz,t3_eo79xt,1578952785.0,"Pros have no reason to use the A1s if you think about it. Yes, the silencer has its perk in niche situations like firing among several smokes when the enemy is exposed to multiple angles and can't immediately guess where you are.  The lower ROF and magazine size aren't that beneficial when the T2K is that much longer."
