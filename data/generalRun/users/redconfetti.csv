JordanPeterson,fdniced,t1_fdn28ts,1578586419.0,"He doesn't just not like Peterson. All college professors can not like Peterson for all i care. He threatened to abuse his authority as a professor by negatively affecting an academic outcome for a student, because they like Peterson.

If a judge tweeted that they would rule against a defendant with bias based on some political matter, he would be dismissed... Not because of ""cancel culture"", but because they have exposed a person motivation to violate the integrity of the institution of law."
JordanPeterson,fdnhdvp,t1_fdmlon9,1578585846.0,"He made a statement that he would hurt students academically because they see something said by Peterson as relevant enough to reference.

There isn't any hard line way for a student to defend themselves against that. The professor could just claim that the student overall didn't do a good job. Am I wrong in this perception? Is it possible for students to defend themselves in such cases by requesting a review?

This isn't about taking a position to sanction someone to support the cause of a collective ideology. It's about a collective ideology being supported by someone in asserting boldly that they would abuse their power as an authority figure to control the behavior and thinking of students. 

Honestly, i wouldn't attend that college after this. That's not cancel culture. That's the actual outcome of the lack of trust this tweet has fostered. Maybe if it's clear that a person would have recourse to appeal a bad grade might I see this as not a big deal, by that's not the case. His statement implies not only how sure he is off his position, but also how he would be able to do that because his institutions would support him also."
