Whilst doing recreational doses of most stimulants is relatively safe, binging anything that messes with your 5HTP receptors enough can cause hallucinations. MDMA is a stimulant that can absolutely cause hallucinations even at moderately ""normal"" doses."

At the beginning it was all Canada++ and Norway this and that, single market access with none of the downsides. So the remain camp, rightly, said ""wtf is the point in that? it's remaining without some of the benefits like a veto"". After the result came in the goalposts started shifting so far to the right and ""no deal"", which hadn't even been mentioned previously was, now what brexit really meant and everything else was betraying the will of the people.

Had remainers known this is the path we would be sent down the majority (I hope) would have said fine, Norway model. Lets get it done. But obviously no one could have realistically foreseen just how mental the right wing media and brexit fanatics would take it."
