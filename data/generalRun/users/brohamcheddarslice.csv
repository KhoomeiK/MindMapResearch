BetterEveryLoop,ff27a5r,t3_eqz9o3,1579495844.0,Yeah I tried out a shock collar once so I would know what it felt like for a dog. I will never forget the sensation of simultaneously being strangled and tazed. It was like being choked out by Darth Vader.

hermitcrabs,feva36n,t1_fet9k3b,1579394972.0,"Wow, thanks for all of the suggestions! You've given me a lot of ideas to start with. I especially like the idea of having a beach area and a shell shop! I usually just try to spread some shells around to see if any tickle their fancy, but alas they are picky! Do you know of any good shell suppliers? PS:  I had no idea hermit crabs could use exercise wheels. TIL!"

I just completely  disagree with your statement, when given the situation I would and *have* done something, (I used to live in a bad neighborhood).  I don't consider it vigilantism. I just can't  stand people doing shit like this. I am not saying  I would go over there and try to fight all of them. I would definitely  tell them in some way to fucking knock it off."
