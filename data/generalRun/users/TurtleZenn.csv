AskReddit,ffgp76g,t1_ffgnniu,1579911558.0,"So much of it is that society pushes that a romantic relationship is the most important one in your life and should be favored above everything else. And because we're supposed to develop our ""nuclear"" family, we're not supposed to rely on anyone outside of that family."
AskReddit,ffaiawb,t1_ff9indm,1579736395.0,"Minimum wage is around $9.50 where I'm at. Most positions getting that are entry level, retail and food service, which are not full time. You're looking at 25 hours a week if you're lucky. One place I worked, the associates in those positions were expected to have open availability, but work between 10-15 hours. So you need at least 2 of those jobs, but again, then you don't have open availability. Say you're getting a lucky 35 hours a week between your 2 jobs.

$665 per 2 week pay period. Taxes will take at least $80, so $585. Average of 2 paychecks a month.

$1170. Even my super crappy apt in a dangerous area is $600 for a 1 bedroom.

$570. Gas/electricity for that apt is about $100.

$470. Water/trash is another $50.

$420. Cheap phone around $40.

$380. Health insurance? Car payment/insurance/gas? Those alone could be the remainder of that money. Health insurance can be $300 a month for 1 person, if you don't qualify for other assistance. My car is owned outright and 10 years old, insurance for it $150 a month. And what if you're paying off debt of some kind? Student loans, credit cards, medical bills. That also has to come out of that.

What about food? Good luck, even if you have some money left over. Many areas around are food deserts. Can't get anything nutritious at the local convenience store. And even at regular stores, ramen and mac & cheese is way cheaper than anything better for you. Bad food is easier and cheaper to find in the worse areas.

God forbid any emergency cost comes up. You are paying out more than you make, there's no way to have a savings. A one time cost of $500 will break you, as a person. You do not and cannot have that amount at one time without forgoing paying your rent or utilities. Oh, and it's an ""at will"" state, which means that workplaces are perfectly within their rights to fire you at any time. So that's hanging over your head too. And if you're struggling this bad, it is so fucking hard to try to get out of it. You can't afford school. You can't afford to try to find a new job, because if you don't get paid 1 time due to the job changeover and time between paychecks, you'll lose your home. Moving up in the jobs you have takes time and still, maybe you'll make a dollar more an hour."

AskReddit,ff8q3sp,t1_ff8km4g,1579691300.0,"This sounds just like the old view of ""I don't mind gay people as long as they stay quiet about it."" Also, as if you are sexualizing gay people, just because they're gay. There's a lot of that attitude. That if someone mentions they're gay, they are automatically talking about sex, because that's what your mind veers into, even when they're just talking about their SO or dating or something. A straight person can talk about dating or getting married, but if a gay person talks about it, it's suddenly related to sex and something they should be private about. Or it's fine for straight people to show some PDA, but gay people holding hands or kissing is explicit and should stay in their houses. Also, someone saying or explaining they're gay isn't having it representing them, it's just that straight people don't have to say it because it's assumed they're straight. Thus when gay people say it, it seems like they're focusing on it, while really, they're just trying to correct assumptions."

Even if you think you're shielding them, they know and see more than you think. And they can understand more than you'd probably want them to. But talking to them is one of the best ways to teach them how to properly express emotion, especially if any end up with depression themselves.

Also, they lost their daughter, who also had quite and struggle as a teenager and they had just worked through that. That probably changed them significantly. And it would be hard to get close to another ""daughter"" after that and while keeping the secret. I'm not saying that the distance they raised her to feel was ok, but at least that might be a reason. Working through OP's emotions with a counselor and remembering that (hopefully) everything came from a place of love, will allow her to talk things through with her grandparents.

relationships,ff5h0yy,t3_erisrs,1579592496.0,"So, you'll let your daughter know she won't get kicked out and you'll be there for you, just not in front of your wife? Why are you married to someone you're obviously scared of? You're just showing your daughter that your wife's reactions are more important than her. You literally just watched when your wife got physical and blocked her out of the house? Why didn't you step in and stop it, as it was happening? Talking a good game after abuse isn't protecting your daughter. She is only going to see that your wife can do anything and you won't save her from it, you'll just try to smooth things over afterward. If your wife hit her, would you stop it or just tell your daughter she's safe after it happened? Well, emotional abuse is still abuse, and maybe your wife hasn't struck her physically, but she's been slapping her with cruel words and making her fear for her security. And you just sit and watch. Your poor kids. Your daughter is threatened with homelessness, your son is clearly scared to come out, and you just let it continue. 

Sounds like a great household to grow up in. /s

Just fyi, this will drive your daughter to stay with this boy. If she's kicked out, she'll probably even live with him. And even if she gives in and doesn't see him again (or claims it and keeps her love life a secret from her cruel mother), your daughter will be gone from both your lives as soon as she can. Your son will be too. Neither of them feel safe, respected, or loved. And even if you think they love you and know you're ""there for them,"" the resentment of how you let their mom hurt them will fester and they'll be just as done with you as with her.

Hope you're happy with just your harpy of a wife for the rest of your life. Cuz she'll be the only one around."

A child (even an adult one) should NEVER have to take on a partner role of that kind with a parent. A kid can help a parent, support them, etc. Hell, I was even the legal guardian for mine near the end of my mom's life. But never for one second was it as a significant other would do. If the parent needs things, such as emotional support, from an SO, they should not rely on getting that from their kid. They need to find another partner or seek out what they need from another peer. Their kid needs to be able to develop as their own person.

And saying it's just because he's a man is bull. He can become a man and is already on the way to doing so, regardless of his family. Just the same as the sisters, they're all becoming adults. It's disingenuous to say that their dynamics will change any differently from how they were already developing just because their dad died.
