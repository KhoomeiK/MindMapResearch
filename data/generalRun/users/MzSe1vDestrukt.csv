BlackPeopleTwitter,ffhnh20,t1_ffgdodd,1579943869.0,"Yes but unisex bathrooms are usually one private bathroom that one person enters at a time, not multiple stalls and urinals for multiple people at once. 
Same with family bathrooms. You don’t have multiple families in one bathroom at a time. 
Not that I have any opinion, I could care less, in fact I’ve peed in men’s bathrooms many times lol"
Methadone,ffhmxbb,t3_etnkaw,1579943031.0,"Yes they will help in an emergency. My lockbox was stolen from a hotel and I went into withdrawal because I was afraid I’d lose my carries I told them I fucked up. I thought I could make it until my next pickup (I go every two weeks).By day 3 I was in the worst withdrawal I’d ever experienced and went right in. They just had me dose in clinic for the next couple days until my official pickup date and asked me to bring a police report copy later. 

I have gone through methadone withdrawal twice in the past four months (not completely through, I’ve gone 72-96 hours) and it is a hell that no previous withdrawal could prepare me for.  I couldn’t even drive myself to the clinic last time, my mom had to call me an Uber (I couldn’t use my phone because my vision was so blurry) Your girlfriend does not have relief coming anytime soon, I can tell you that much. 
As long as she’s not missing any of her carries I’m sure they will have her come in right away for a dose increase. They know the severity of the symptoms and they don’t want that desperation causing a relapse."
ehlersdanlos,ffhlmj2,t3_etm4gi,1579941099.0,"This makes me so happy and hopeful in general. It’s nice to hear that this attitude exists out there in the medical field! I’ll never forget the doctor that listened to me. Sadly he did refer me on at the end of the appointment because he couldn’t help, BUT, he listened to me for real (I started crying five minutes in when I realized he was actually listening) for two hours.
I wonder if they know just how much we hold them in our hearts lol"

Methadone,fffl58t,t3_et976v,1579886323.0,"Hey me too! 
I have a gigantic mat in the back of my hair from so much depression sleep and just tying up my greasy hair instead of washing and brushing it. I initially had a mix of dreadlocks beneath my hair, and dreads are the last thing you should ever neglect. They like to grow into each other. I am not looking forward to trying to to salvage that. 
Sometimes I honestly donâ€™t know if I smell because I havenâ€™t showered in so long, or if itâ€™s my clothes because I havenâ€™t changed in so long ðŸ˜¹"

Thetruthishere,ffb8a46,t3_esgbqm,1579754754.0,"I grew up in mound on Lake Minnetonka (three points Blvd) and had so many terrifying experiences in my childhood. Itâ€™s very interesting to me that you referenced the Mdewakanton tribe, as my son is a member. Iâ€™m going to ask is his father if has any insights on that. 
I have never seen anything similar to what you described though. My experiences all involved what I perceived to be a ghos in my house and recurring nightmares of black eyed bald men outside my windows coming inside and taking me. I had night terrors as a baby and evidently as young as two years old my grandmother had to not only cover the windows at night in my room, but also my mirrors that faced my Windows because I was so terrified. When I was older my neighbors told me lots of stories about UFO sightings over the lake. 
Anyway, if you ever want to talk about the subject PM me!"

He accused me of the same type of stuff, I was always having sex with someone out to get him in the hours I was asleep, or anytime I was in the bathroom because â€œwhy else would I keep going in the bathroom? Whatâ€™s hiding in there?â€ 
I was missing him recently, and this was enough to keep me from checking in."

Did they take a look at a tent city and think â€œhereâ€™s an idea for free advertising!â€? Or do they already have these tents from some promotion and put them to good use?"

Methadone,fd6t8dg,t3_ejxpke,1578195418.0,"Babies.
Some people just let their babies crawl around on the floor which makes me cringe because itâ€™s not uncommon to find needles or drugs. My mom is an LEDC at a different clinic and she found a big bag of meth. Her higher up tested it and then put it in a bag that ruins it (which kind of broke my moms heart as a former meth addict lol)"
