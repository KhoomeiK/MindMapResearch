No I'm not a troll, I'm just a redditor who likes meme and politics.

Calling something a right-wing talking point isn't a rebuttal, idiots can talk about very relevant issues geniuses can talk about irrelevant issued, the people who talk about something are not necessarily indicative of the quality of that something.

It's also not just a right wing talking point, I'm UK left of centre my family are UK right of centre, my close friends are Uk left and one even works for labour, we all talk about the rise of communist support on the far left and it's potential consequences. so adjusting for American politics we're at least centrist I'd say which would make it a centrist talking point as well.

Does it come out of ignorance, no. I've told you I'm familiar with the history of the Gulags I can say the same for the Holocaust, I believe they are horrible moments from history and when people make serious unironic, humour is fine, comparisons between them and any of modern US politics I think it's wrong, that is my opinion.

I too highly doubt Bernie has supported stalin or gulags as that just doesn't seem to align with his morals or politics.

I have seen Bernie supporters, who I was referencing by saying Bernie Bro not sanders himself, who are legitimate defenders of the actions of the USSR/Stalin etc, not people ironically joking about comrades or gulags but legitimate defences of that regime and suggestions that the current US is worse than it was and would benefit from its policies.

I am aware some holocaust survivorship compared current border detention to the Holocaust, there are also holocaust survivors and their families who say it's a very inappropriate comparison, I very much agree with the latter group.

I wouldn't say bringing it up is unrelated, it's a parallel discussion with vast similarities, a historical atrocity, comparisons to said atrocity used to some degree, discussion of whether said comparison is valid inappropriate ignorant etc"

But in the original meme that prompted all this you are against the 2A activist when they suggest that their gun is for defense and tyrannical government

In both these cases, the meme and how you see antifa, the violence is defensive as you put it, but for the hypothetical in the meme you make it clear you think these actions are wrong or misguided or foolish whilst not making the same suggestion of antifa, my ""bashing"" of them would imply you think I'm characterising them unfairly as does calling the bulk of their violence defensive.

No I'm not a troll, I'm just a redditor who likes meme and politics.

Calling something a right-wing talking point isn't a rebuttal, idiots can talk about very relevant issues geniuses can talk about irrelevant issued, the people who talk about something are not necessarily indicative of the quality of that something.

It's also not just a right wing talking point, I'm UK left of centre my family are UK right of centre, my close friends are Uk left and one even works for labour, we all talk about the rise of communist support on the far left and it's potential consequences. so adjusting for American politics we're at least centrist I'd say which would make it a centrist talking point as well.

Does it come out of ignorance, no. I've told you I'm familiar with the history of the Gulags I can say the same for the Holocaust, I believe they are horrible moments from history and when people make serious unironic, humour is fine, comparisons between them and any of modern US politics I think it's wrong, that is my opinion.

I too highly doubt Bernie has supported stalin or gulags as that just doesn't seem to align with his morals or politics.

I have seen Bernie supporters, who I was referencing by saying Bernie Bro not sanders himself, who are legitimate defenders of the actions of the USSR/Stalin etc, not people ironically joking about comrades or gulags but legitimate defences of that regime and suggestions that the current US is worse than it was and would benefit from its policies.

I am aware some holocaust survivorship compared current border detention to the Holocaust, there are also holocaust survivors and their families who say it's a very inappropriate comparison, I very much agree with the latter group.

I wouldn't say bringing it up is unrelated, it's a parallel discussion with vast similarities, a historical atrocity, comparisons to said atrocity used to some degree, discussion of whether said comparison is valid inappropriate ignorant etc"

In both these cases, the meme and how you see antifa, the violence is defensive as you put it, but for the hypothetical in the meme you make it clear you think these actions are wrong or misguided or foolish whilst not making the same suggestion of antifa, my ""bashing"" of them would imply you think I'm characterising them unfairly as does calling the bulk of their violence defensive.

It's not quite as effective as just being the first/top comment on a bunch of posts, but by having things filtered through rising it's a bit easier and less time consuming than trying to work out what's good or bad in new"

toptalent,febtciu,t1_febse7u,1578962470.0,"What part of risk vs benefit don't you understand?

I'm literally just saying don't do something that risks someone else's person with no benefit to them if you have a duty of care to them.

That is a very very narrow set of circumstances for which I'm advocating against risk taking."
toptalent,febr30e,t1_febpuyv,1578961740.0,"A speedy foot to the face can cause permanent damage

It's not about risk in general, it's risk benefit balancing.

Bikes are good, the benefits outweigh the risk.

Exercise is good, the benefits outweigh the risk.

Gymnastics is the same. The flip is the same.

Lying on the ground isn't gymnastics, lying on the ground in that specific spot isn't gymnastics, lying on the ground in that specific spot provides zero benefit to outweigh the risk of a foot smashing your eyes, nose, teeth, ears whatever.

It's not a decision that optimises benefit vs risk, it's unnecessary, and thus it's reckless and deserving of disciplinary action"

I feel like people who know the phrase already, and thus only need to read the first couple words to know what it says, are failing to acknowledge that bias in its perceived legibility.

English is my first language, I'm not remotely dyslexic, and yet I stared at this for a good five minutes and only got ""life liberty and *tehp?*"" before coming to the comments to see what it was, and it's still pretty garbage to read even now knowing what it says.

Some have cmoaperd it to the pehonemna weherby you can read wrods with tehir itnreoir lteetrs srcmalbed, but the letters in the picture are all scrambled including first and last, they're scrambled vertically as well as horizontally, and the individual words aren't separated, so I don't think that really applies either."
insanepeoplefacebook,fea6x41,t3_eo3mtp,1578945056.0,"r/technicallythetruth 

Tbf Hitler was economically left wing, whether he believed in the ideals or simply needed to unite the working class under his leadership is open to debate.

Obviously a lot of these policies were replaced once the *""social reform""* and militarisation kicked in, but to say everything single thing he did was evil is stupid.

A lot of what he did was just normal politics, politics good enough to enable all the *""shenanigans""* he got up to later.

So if some of his politics or policies overlaps with any modern politician it's really not all too significant in and of itself."
WatchRedditDie,fe7rjgw,t1_fe7bvwf,1578918387.0,"End of WW2 left very few countries able to manufacture a good economy, the best of those that could effectively became the superpowers of the world.

After that the events of the cold war effectively stripped the USSR of superpower status and led China to become more insular, so the US was basically left holding the bag.

In the years since they've actually been far less proactive than they could have been as the effective ruler of the globe, which is what has allowed other nations to rise up and why America is a common ideological opponent for so many, as it's just a rejection of them holding that mantle, it's almost symbolic and thrust upon them by the perceptions of others rather than their own actions"
