Direct quote from one of the people directly responsible for the war on drugs. Further proved by statistics... Black people are almost 4 times more likely to be arrested/cited for marijuana possession, despite equal usage. It's not just ""doing their jobs"", it's systematic oppression and racism. The truly scary part is that all of this is out in the open and this strategy still works."
