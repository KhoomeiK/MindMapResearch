CatsAreAssholes,fdbz9yi,t1_fdbh0rj,1578264181.0,"There is truth to the whisker fatigue thing, so flatter bowl/ plates work well for feeding cats. However my 7 yo guy ALSO has to have the bottom of his dish somewhat covered with kibble or else he has panic attacks, which include climbing up on my shoulder day or night and purring in my ear (sometimes with head-bunts) until I move toward his dish. 

We found our guy when he was a very cold & hungry kitten in a parking lot. At the time the vet put him at 6 months old. Vet gave clean bill of health but  said he might have ‚Äúfood supply‚Äù issues, ie, need to know he will always have a bowl of food nearby.

Winding through the neighborhoods, everyone - and I mean EVERYONE was tumbling out of their homes, standing on their front porches or front lawns looking skyward with a ‚ÄúWhat the ‚Äî‚Äî? ‚Äù look on their faces. 

Like a movie.

Got home to see WHIO reporting those sonic booms were the result of some dumpster fire  out at the VA. 

Crack reporting right there. Waaaay off, WHIO. 

Weeks later, learned from a base-adjacent friend that those booms were made by two fighter jet escorts for airforce one going into sonic boom mode (past speed of sound) . For ‚Äúhotdogging it‚Äù over the base that day they got in trouble (supposedly).

politics,fc33536,t1_fc2xmd7,1577380338.0,"I agree 100 per cent. I met Terry MCauliffe  at an event in early 2006 - he announced he was running Hilz  2008 bid ‚Äî I tried to tell him that HRC would never win Ohio unless she changed her strategy. He dismissed me as believing what the GOP was selling about HRC (ie scandal du jour, etc). 

I disagreed. I told him I wanted a strong Dem to win Ohio but it was not going to be her at the rate she was going. I was in fact telling him this because as a lifelong res Dem of Ohio who studied issues per women in Ohio I wanted to win but they were on the wrong track.

Clinton lost to Obama and despite the Ragin Cagin predicting a Hilz win in 2016 she lost to this Trump clown. Brazille wrote a book about it. Now Bloomberg has picked up the Clinton Playbook. Wash Rinse Repeat

Bloomberg is just the continuation of the Clinton Legacy. Go work for Bloomberg. Put Mike in office. Then who follows? Zuckerberg. .... and a long line of DINO wanna-be kings. 

Funny. If Mark Cuban were running I would not feel the same as I do about Bloomberg. He‚Äôs young enough, knew real hunger and would carry the midwest. Cuban for POTUS (wins the office) puts Bernie in charge of policy. (VP whatever).  Safer bet. 

The argument in Ohio is that Bernie is too liberal for red states voters. Voters worry about his age. Bloomberg will poll well in Ohio. 

But a Bloomberg win will not put Wall Street on the hook, end CitizenUnited or hold any CEOs accountable. Yeah we might not have 46 grams of sugar in soda but the working people will see less and less income.
