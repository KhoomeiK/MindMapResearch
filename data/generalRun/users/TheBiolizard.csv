Games,fgeghk2,t1_fge4aft,1580699005.0,Now that’s a name I haven’t heard in a long time
OnePiece,fg82dnp,t1_fg80w0p,1580607683.0,I think you’re probably right. Can’t wait to see what some of his more hardcore beasts look like. As well as who King really is under the mask
OnePiece,fg828uw,t1_fg816rj,1580607580.0,I’ll change it
OnePiece,fg7z91k,t1_fg7wsmd,1580605314.0,I think he means they're going to use Tama's DF ability to tame Big Mom. More likely that it happens to Kaido tho considering he has a creature form.
OnePiece,fg7yxki,t1_fg7n2ui,1580605072.0,"From a strictly narrative point of view, the three that would have the biggest impact on the reader are: Kinemon, Kanjuro or Raizo. I say this because they are the three we've spent the longest with. 

So if we narrow it down to those three, we can almost certainly eliminate Kinemon from the running, as the whole rebellion is built upon his back. It wouldn't make sense for him to be the traitor.

That leaves us with Kanjuro or Raizo. I'll tackle Raizo first. Him being the traitor would have the highest narrative impact as it would render the sacrifice of the Minks on Zou as completely worthless. Plus it could be explained that he spent his time hiding on Zou as an excuse to get a Poneglyph rubbing for Kaido. So narratively speaking, Raizo is the highest suspect.

Kanjuro is the remaining suspect, but there is little to no proof of him being a traitor. Not to mention that his devil fruit is ridiculous and the butt of many jokes. The only real narrative impact of him being the traitor would be that we've known him for a long time. I guess there could be a twist that he's actually a brilliant artist and can make crazy detailed creatures, but has been purposefully drawing shitty drawings so he can stay under the radar.

With all this in mind, it could surely be one of the other scabbards, but it's also pretty easy to eliminate everyone else.

Can't be Ashura Doji because he was literally backstabbed during the fight with Kaido. 

While it could be Kiku, she is really not the traitorous type, nor do I believe that she is at all intelligent enough to successfully scheme for this many years. As well she has known Oden for almost her entire life. As well x2, Oden literally saved Kiku from starving. So cross her off.

Can't be Neko or Inu because they have been shown again and again as loyal to a fault. Not to mention they went on Roger's ship with Oden.

Can't be Kawamatsu because he was locked up for so long. Timeline wise it doesn't make sense for him to be the traitor. Furthermore, he is also extremely loyal to Hiyori. Together with that fact, he was also saved by Oden. Can't be him.

Which leaves us with Denjiro, who it could also be, but Oda has been setting up the reveal of who the traitor is before Denjiro was even established as a character. It would have the least amount of narrative impact and would just sort of fall flat. He absolutely could be the traitor, but it would be by far the lamest reveal.

So in summary, it's probably either Kanjuro or Raizo. My money being on Raizo.

Edit: misgendered Kiku"

dankmemes,fg5w9dd,t1_fg5w1o0,1580541534.0,"Its a video on YouTube. It’s a completely community sourced half an hour pilot for a show. The reason it’s so impressive is cuz there was no actual studio that produced it, and yet the quality is on par with something that would cost a shit load of money to be made. 

It’s basically just a really passionate community project made by talented artists, voice actors, music creators, etc that all came together from different walks of life to make it.

Edit: I feel I should add that you’re right, it is interesting! Plus the way it’s made alone is an interesting enough reason to watch it."
OnePiece,fg5v2tx,t1_fg55o6v,1580540076.0,Just a thought about the female hand bit: what if King is a woman similar to how Queen is a man? Could be a fun subversion of the titles.
todayilearned,fg2bp2c,t1_fg1e83r,1580442011.0,Shit I completely forgot about that guy. Wonder if he’s perfected his technique considering we don’t hear much about him nowadays
todayilearned,fg2bieq,t1_fg22o72,1580441919.0,"We don’t really talk about old Willy anymore I guess. Lots of people I know have never even heard of the guy surprisingly enough, especially considering how prolific he was when he was active."
todayilearned,fg2b4gx,t1_fg282bm,1580441723.0,"I think he means compared to America our gun violence is relatively small to non-existent. Obviously we have guns but it’s just that, again, compared to America, gun violence is substantially more rare."

danganronpa,ffzm69g,t3_evwvml,1580385601.0,To be fair I do think Nagito is the best character the series produced so it’s completely justifiable for him to be worshipped.
Spiderman,ffxn7kd,t3_evlj99,1580328554.0,The art on the girl kind of looks like the Ace Attorney art style.
SmashBrosUltimate,ffradh9,t1_ffr6rxe,1580153918.0,"It is entirely possible! I just know that the in-game statistics always list Dorothea, Petra and Bernadetta as the top 3 deployed characters in every chapter. Hence meaning that Black Eagles are the most popular house. I suppose that doesn’t mean Edelgard is more popular than Dimitri tho! People are a sucker for a suffering boi after all"
SmashBrosUltimate,ffqk6k6,t1_ffq7kbr,1580136828.0,I was so sure they’d go with Edelgard since Black Eagles are by far the most popular house in the game. The statistics in the game say so anyway. Plus she’s a heavy axe wielder so she’s not even a swordy.
HazbinHotel,ffklt5w,t1_ffk4hfk,1580024876.0,So I guess it turns out Vaggie wasn’t short for vagina after all.
dankmemes,ffhkirh,t1_ffh252z,1579939505.0,"I’m glad you enjoyed it and that others have shared the sentiment. I on the other hand thought it was the most pure example of shitty hammy writing I’ve ever seen. My jaw was dropped by how awful it was and I eagerly wish I could regain the hour and a half I spent on the first episode.

I still can’t get over how almost every line spoken by Dracula is a vampire pun. I can see myself enjoying what I just said so I don’t blame others for liking it, but I thought it so horribly missed the mark at every opportunity. Writing wise at least. Set design and costumes were pretty cool I guess"
ChurchofChie,ffg4kwm,t3_etfa0g,1579898327.0,Your service to this congregation is worthy of only the highest praise. I am proud to be a member of this church when we got you as our pope.

titanfolk,ffc35c5,t1_ffc2jh4,1579790374.0,Pretty sure that’s closer to what Eren is doing.
ageofsigmar,ffb6gsd,t3_eshbu0,1579753072.0,Oh boy I’m jealous but super happy for you. Embrace the great Horned Rat and enjoy spending the rest of the year on those. Good luck!

dbz,fdedyfy,t1_fded952,1578336932.0,"I was thinking about saying Zamasu too. Actually a great character, and he accomplished a majority of his goals before the main cast even got involved in fighting him."
dbz,fdecp1q,t3_ekxnhx,1578336143.0,"Might get some flack but I still think Super Buu is the scariest villain we’ve gotten. From the moment he absorbed good Buu to his transformation into Kid Buu, he was the most terrifying force of nature the Z Fighters had ever faced. He exterminated the human population with one attack and even killed Chi Chi. Even when you think he’s lost for sure, he absorbs another fighter. I haven’t felt despair like that since watching the Majin Buu arc, so that’s why he’ll always be my favorite."
NintendoSwitch,fdc0i9o,t1_fdbrkpe,1578264757.0,"If you like strategy, anime or fantasy storytelling it’s up your alley. Even if you don’t like one of those individually, the game more than delivers on other aspects. There’s so much to it that even if one aspect isn’t your favorite, you will probably enjoy it enough to play through it because of another aspect."
