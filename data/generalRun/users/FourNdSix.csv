You are stressed and I think it's caused anxiety. Get yourself to a doctor or the mental health support services at your college. They should be able to offer you help at advice. You may even be able to defer a module while you sort yourself out.
Don't be afraid to try medication if the doctor recommends it, but be aware it might take a few attempts to get the right one.

Again, you're not going insane you're just anxious. Try not to worry about it too much, panic attacks are scary but you can't die from them and they won't send you insane. :)"
whatisthisthing,ffkxmdp,t1_ffjlhyf,1580030813.0,Noop can't find anything. I'd assume it was a coin at that size but it seems pretty rare that coins are that plain but also so uniformly rounded.
whatisthisthing,ffjhi04,t3_etyybe,1579998341.0,"How big is it, is it likely to be a coin?

I feel like I've seen the guy before but it's quite generic so maybe not."
NatureIsFuckingLit,ffjh89c,t3_etz3uk,1579998175.0,Why did you have to disturb them. I didn't need to know they existed .
mentalhealth,ffhqyt6,t1_ffhqq5s,1579949248.0,Good luck. Let me know if you have any more questions :)
nextfuckinglevel,ffhqbst,t1_ffhq9cd,1579948254.0,It looks impossible. How do they stay up!?!
mentalhealth,ffhq9ir,t1_ffhp673,1579948157.0,"Yep. Often when I was very anxious but it spilt out a bit when I didn't feel as anxious. I usually had a feeling like my tongue was too big for my mouth and Id trip over words. Sometimes I just forgot words I wanted to say.

Like I said it's amazing what anxiety can do. I'm medicated now and it's much better. If you can I'd recommend trying it out, although it's not always what everyone wants and it can take time to find a medication that's right for you"
NatureIsFuckingLit,ffhoq7i,t3_etntt2,1579945787.0,Looks like BB8
mentalhealth,ffhoi0n,t1_ffhoenj,1579945431.0,"Yeah I just think it's your anxiety. It affects memory and recall negatively if you're anxious a lot.
If you're really worried go to the doctor. I'd recommend it anyway tbh to try to get some help with your anxiety :)"
ALLTHEANIMALS,ffhog1z,t3_eto6hr,1579945348.0,I love how calm it was. Funny as. I generally hide bag handles because my cat is useless at them and freaks himself out.
mentalhealth,ffho7e8,t3_etojmn,1579944973.0,"It's very likely to be the anxiety. It's amazing what weird symptoms anxiety can cause. I recognise all of them as something I've experienced because if anxiety, except the grammar one, do you just mean you forget to put in punctuation etc or is it something else?"
nextfuckinglevel,ffgwisk,t3_eixej5,1579916856.0,"I was about to say, how can it be classed as a Lego model when they're defacing half the bricks, then they started painting it. Thanks s pretty good animation skills."

Unexpected,ffgw5p8,t1_fdwt9oo,1579916592.0,I absolutely love watching this guy look at toys. I find it madly entertaining.

Im also wondering why anyone would want a whip, who is it aimed at?"

discworld,ffft936,t3_e1zsmk,1579891302.0,THANK YOU! I kept seeing this and couldn't work it out although it rang so many bells. Like a group of canpanologists having a good practice in my head. xD

CasualUK,fffsm7f,t1_fffb250,1579890909.0,Sounds like he had a marrow escape!
nextfuckinglevel,fffs012,t3_etcmcw,1579890526.0,My eyes!!
mentalhealth,fffrvq8,t1_fffijq0,1579890452.0,"Yeah I agree. I think you need to try to find one that deals especially with your conditions if you can. That way they're more likely to understand and be more understanding.
Sounds like you got a crap therapist, although she's a bit right about the meds, they don't often take the feelings completely away but they should definitely make life easier and handling your emotions easier."
mentalhealth,ffflgx5,t3_etd2cd,1579886525.0,"Look up ADHD it sounds like that or maybe the subtype of ADD. https://totallyadd.com/
Is a good place to start. If you feel that it might be you go down to your doctor and ask for an assessment as it's negatively affecting your life.
If not might be worth going anyway, maybe you're anxious?"
blursedimages,ffer2yv,t1_ffbxgnp,1579861319.0,Well you're in for an even better treat!
mentalhealth,ffeoy89,t1_ffeomz1,1579858103.0,If you've been diagnosed with ADHD then I'd go to the doctor again. It's pretty common for anxiety to occur with ADHD so they should be able to help give you some medication that will either offset the stimulants or deal with the anxiety seperately.
mentalhealth,ffeoea4,t3_et7k82,1579857261.0,"Have you been to the doctor. I don't think it's 100% accurate but it's well known stimulants can help people with Attention Deficit Disorder. Maybe that's affecting you?
It depends too on your diet and amount of exercise. I'd recommend trying to wean off the stimulants if they're making anxiety worse. Try to drink something else instead. It's quite possible youre doing it out of habit and a need to do something"
CasualUK,ffeoaz9,t1_ffenzzw,1579857124.0,It's dazzling :')
CasualUK,ffeoaam,t3_et7nfz,1579857094.0,Can't blame him. He's the oldest of them all.
nextfuckinglevel,ffek4lj,t1_ffeie88,1579851355.0,"Tbh I think he does it from interest and the fact he's been doing it for ages than some sort of balancing compulsion.

Could you imagine his house if this was the case xD"
