There are lots of really scary signs at the ridge where you transition from blue/black on one side to experts only on the other but invariably ski patrol has to come rescue healthy intermediate skier/rider groups from the wrong side.

Once you get down in it, it's a whole different world than the semi groomed you just left, and the skier way out is to get to the bottom and take the lift back to the ridge, wiser and more sober than when you dropped in"

I used to backpack, then stopped, then did it again for a few years.  First trip back was a three day and I hurt so bad at the end of it I thought the pack was bad.  Nope!  I was just out of condition.

People look at you funny if you wear a pack on the treadmill down at the YMCA but there weren't any rules against it.  They did have a rule against boots on the treadmills so I had to buy some cheap trainers.  I had that pack loaded with my gear (more water in place of food) and kept it in my car.  I did 4-7 miles a night three times a week after work all winter.

I gave it to a buddy when I had kids, because I knew I wouldn't be backpacking for awhile.  I found a Mountainsmith pack in a thrift store some years later and it's also a quality brand but with some questionable design choices.

snowboardingnoobs,feec6rf,t3_eop0j7,1579030745.0,Nice repair.  Who did it?
Dashcam,feeatbd,t1_fee78mj,1579029941.0,"Thanks.  That one looks really cool but I think I'll just go with this $120 one, $480 before install is a little too much for me.  I just want something that can record the morons that try to hit me.

Again, thank you."

Do you know of a camera that does what I need?"
