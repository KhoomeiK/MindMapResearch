intel,fgm5e2l,t1_fglb9fd,1580918293.0,sorry but my 7700K is already 70-80W under heavy gaming load and that‘s already OC‘d. Never ever a 9900K only draws 70W while gaming.
sffpc,fglv5xa,t1_fglj2xg,1580911697.0,"wow, that may be worth it.
I have the exact same card in my Air 240, so not exactly SFF but due to my massive radiator in the front I‘m kinda limited lenght wise.
And the card is hella loud!! I upgraded last year from a 1060, and I can‘t game without headset. I‘m thinking of doing the mod, great work here!"

Corsair,fghz08r,t1_fghnkpn,1580798484.0,"Still, this is a big case, why then put all three into the case? And even if he uses 2x 1080 Ti for Mac OS (1080 ti is still supported on High Sierra, 2080 ti never got support), and a 2080 Ti for Windows, why not put the 2080 Ti into the external case, eGPUs are easier to run in Windows anyway and you got proper SLI support for the 1080 Ti.
I don’t know how many PCIe lanes this board has (propbably enough as its a TR board), but If there arent enough for running three cards on it, why dumping all the money on three high end cards and cheaping out on the board?"

fatlogic,fgg7luy,t1_fgfmsh0,1580755980.0,"Yup, chubby usually means being in the overweight BMI range for me or upper end of normal, not being into the obese range.
I‘ve got a friend who I‘d consider chubby, she has a BMI around 27, so not exactly skinny or fat, but chubby. Bigger hips, bigger tits, a little bit of extra fat around the waist but not alarmingly so. She never had problems to find a partner, because she is self confident and it probably helps that she carries her extra weight in an aesthetically pleasing way. 
I mean this post is pretty wholesome, sad we don‘t see that more often."
thinkpad,fgfdyxq,t1_fgfbq20,1580735851.0,"thanks for your answer! I‘m looking for an i5 variant, IPS screen is not needed as you often pay premium for it and I do have a nice 24“ IPS panel at home.
With an i5, the cheaper TN panel and a SSD I really hope it is archiveable, although I currently look into X250 and X260 as well due to the 16Gb Ram support (the X240 is maxed out with 8Gb right?) and the low wattage CPU.

The thinkpad would be only used outdoors at night for astronomy or during uni hours, for making notes, so it‘s that I need high specs, but the newer CPUs promise much better battery life."
thinkpad,fgf6omo,t1_fgf66rz,1580727381.0,"I‘d probably use an external mouse most of the time as well as I can‘t really deal with any trackpad for productive work.
How much is the X260 used and how is battery life?"
thinkpad,fgf6n4t,t1_fgf6cvm,1580727320.0,"Keyboard isn‘t that important, as long as it works, I’d rather put the money in a new SSD and a new battery. How is the battery life in a X230 with an all new 9 cell battery?"
ShitMomGroupsSay,fg2vwat,t3_ewkwvd,1580458165.0,"the more I read shit like this, the less I want kids, ever. Seemingly lots of women are only mothers then and are fully absorbed in that role, tbh I kinda want more from life and looking at this, I couldn‘t be even friends with women who‘s only trait or interest is being a mother, and tbh it seems like lots of women turn like this judging the amount of comments on this..."

riverdale,fg0qrkk,t3_evcltb,1580413184.0,"Nah, I like Season 1, but I also liked parts of S2 (first half, last few episodes) and the first half of S3. Also I think S4 is probably the second best season after S1 so far.
What I’d change? Send Hiram to jail for good (not another dead father please) and give Veronica actual storylines. More friendship scenes. Split up Varchie because it’s boring, at least Betty and Jughead have some development, some fights etc"
riverdale,fg0owri,t1_ffzd3z7,1580412158.0,I mean teens clubbing and drinking is the most normal thing they do. Hell I drank a lot while being 17 and I had my ways to get into nightclubs while being underage... Owning a club and a rum business is not normal for a teen though lol
PoliticalCompassMemes,fg08q88,t1_ffy1rwr,1580402634.0,"same here, lots of rational reasons actually. Im lib left and I‘m pro Israel...and I kinda have my problems with the hamas. I guess it‘s rare for liblefts?"
BitLifeApp,ffssd9p,t1_ffr59ci,1580190713.0,"woah, I didn‘t play bitlife for a long time, and I remember getting the membership over a year ago, I definitely only paid 1.99...lucky me, thinking about getting into the game again"
VintageApple,ff9h85s,t1_ff8prxl,1579712961.0,"My Mid 12 Non Retina 15“ MBP is still going strong 7 years later, maxed out the RAM, and put an SSD into it, you can even play some games on it thanks to the 650M( everything until 2013 mostly runs fine).
I still can‘t belive this Mac is soon gonna be considered vintage according to Apple...
My Brother uses my old Mid 09 13“ MBP and it also got an SSD and 8GB Ram, it‘s still going strong for webbrowsing, media streaming in native resolution and office loads.
The Unibody generation (before retina and stuff) was such a strong one in my opinion."

fatlogic,fe2h3x0,t1_fe01djq,1578838296.0,"I‘m around 125 lbs and 5‘6, and I‘m like a 75G or 70F (no idea how US sizes work there, sorry!) and tbh I‘d lost all hope, my boobs are really big compared to my frame, I don‘t really need to lose weight though. I can‘t seem to find nice affordable bras that fit and don‘t come with horrendous shipping fees due to being an import. They hurt while exersising, buying swimsuits/bikinis is a nightmare, they make every slim fitting top looking sexual as hell, oversized fashion makes me look way bigger than I am, tbh I thought about reduction but I can’t afford it and I’m kinda afraid of it...I’d rather have nice 75C or 70D boobs (which would probably be only possible via Weightloss with a BMI of 17.5 or so and I’m definitely not going there)."
AccidentalWesAnderson,fe1o0ge,t3_enhv0g,1578828872.0,"Probably built in the 90‘ looking at the metal flat roofs, circle windows and yellow windows. Not really Wes‘ 60‘/70‘ vintage aesthetics.
edit: I checked and I wasn‘t too far off, probably planned in the 90‘, finished in the early 00‘.
There are tons of buildings in this style (not many cats though) in Germany and all are build in the 90’, grew up in a house with metal flat roof, circle windows, weird colours and stuff, and now I moved to flat in an apartment building which features teal and blue windows in unconventional shapes, and some other unconventional not symmetric features. Oh and of course tin/metal roof."
IncelTears,fe1no8q,t1_fdysn1s,1578828728.0,"omg, that are literally children, what sickos. I was such an awkward teen-children hybrid, trying to look older but I was definitely still a child. my style was pretty awkward until I turned like 17, and tbh now I‘m 26, I look better than ever. I‘d consider the twenties the prime lookwise (looking from a conventional viewpoint on it) for most people, because you probably figured out your style, you look like an actual hot adult and your skin is still fresh and youthful. Glad I‘m too old for these weirdos, but I feel seriously worried for teen girls now."
fatlogic,fdq0jwd,t1_fdnogzk,1578648860.0,"I am a smoker (trying to quit though), and I workout rarely, and I can run up two flights easily and go up fast 5 flights without any issue eg huffing and breathing heavily. This must be the extra weight.
My boyfriend lives on the fifth floor without an elevator, which is not a problem for me, but tbh I probably couldn‘t visit him if I‘d be heavily overweight."
