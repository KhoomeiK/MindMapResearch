bipolar2,fettntb,t3_eqin3k,1579379945.0,"For sure. Once you find the right music, it can really amp things up further and everything just feels so good. It’s an experience that’s hard to describe, and is different than listening to music when not hypo. Also end up listening to the same thing over and over and still get a good effect."
bipolar2,feo9vfk,t1_feo7evk,1579297151.0,"Similar experience for me. Bipolar as portrayed in popular media tends to show the extremes, because it makes for a better show.
It took me a while to reconcile my actual experiences against what I’d previously perceived it would feel like to have bipolar."
bipolar2,fenk8p2,t3_eq3rcj,1579286482.0,"Ugh, sorry that happened to you. I like how you’re channeling everything in a positive way by typing out your feelings- it helps for me too. Hope you feel better soon."
bipolar2,fenjgj0,t3_eq3zv9,1579286002.0,Nice job! I’ll be rooting for you. Hope the week goes well.
bipolar2,fenj9ke,t3_eq40b3,1579285883.0,"Yes, this usually happens to me when I enter a depressive episode. It’s a little counter-intuitive, but I find that the more I’m in my own head, the worse things can start to get. Try to find something to distract you such as a hobby if you can, and of course follow up with your therapist to let them know what’s going on especially if things get worse. 
Hope you feel better soon!"
bisexualadults,fenijf6,t3_eq39n7,1579285440.0,Good for you. There’s nothing wrong with being bi.
BipolarReddit,fenicxa,t3_eq3enh,1579285328.0,You could ask the pdoc about gabapentin- it can help with mild to moderate mania and doesn’t have addictive effects like benzodiazepines.
backpain,felcpwq,t3_eprp04,1579219096.0,"That’s frustrating. One thing to keep in mind about an MRI at least is that it doesn’t show the full picture when you’re under load or in some other triggering position. After all, you’re laying still in a tube when they take it. 

Just because it shows nothing doesn’t invalidate your pain and what you’re going through. Stay on top of good back exercises if you can. 

Keep in mind I’m no doctor though, so it’s worth following up with a specialist too. 

Hope you feel better soon."
mentalhealth,fefk5yt,t3_eovqxm,1579058044.0,"Sorry that happened to you. That’s really horrible. Just wanted to wish you the best, there’s nothing wrong with being bi."
bipolar,fefjpu9,t3_eovgn2,1579057769.0,Love it!
bipolar,fdsvfbf,t1_fdsv6gr,1578708451.0,"I’ve been on it since April, and am still on it."
bipolar,fdsud3w,t3_emy0i9,1578708055.0,"I’m on 10mg, and it works well for me. Helped to remove depression and control hypomania. No noticeable side effects."
BipolarReddit,fdpj657,t3_emkich,1578630053.0,"100mg Pristiq, 10mg Abilify here. It’s been working quite well for me for about nine months."
mentalhealth,fdpimkv,t3_emkot0,1578629631.0,Good for you. And good luck.
bipolar2,fdoiusn,t3_emdcfl,1578606031.0,"I love hearing success stories. Congrats, and nice job recognizing what could help and looking out for yourself!"
bipolar2,fdohpls,t3_emd3vz,1578605370.0,"I’m truly, deeply sorry for your loss. I just want to say that you sound like an amazing, passionate psychologist and I really appreciate the work that you do. 

Please don’t think that you’ve failed. Your perspective and expertise is highly valued, and gives me hope for all of us that suffer."
bipolar,fdmfkv2,t3_em4vz8,1578548247.0,That's great! Hoping for the best for you.
bipolar2,fdje8mx,t3_elott1,1578467148.0,"I'm glad things are looking much better for you now. I can identify a lot with this. It's such a bizarre experience to look back and see the progress you've made, and wonder what happened, why you felt and acted the way you did when things look so much different now."
bipolar,fdjbdz1,t3_elo0dg,1578464150.0,I know how you feel. Hang in there.
mentalhealth,fdjbci4,t3_ell9d7,1578464110.0,Congrats! That's awesome.
bipolar2,fdjbbc6,t3_elf1wv,1578464078.0,Best thing you can do is to be honest with yourself and your psychiatrist. It looks like you're already doing a good job documenting different examples of how you've been feeling which is great! Take it with you to your appointment - it's easy to forget in the moment.
BipolarReddit,fdj9as8,t3_el68it,1578462187.0,"You're not alone. I've felt this way before too when in a depressive episode, and figured out that it's the distraction of work / school / whatever activity that can make things feel better for a time. Once I'd come home, without a distraction everything started falling apart.

I'd bring this up with your therapist for sure. In the meantime, finding something at home to keep you occupied rather than in your own thoughts may help."
BipolarReddit,fdj8zh3,t3_el694g,1578461910.0,"LOL this is me too. I have Klonopin to take as needed, but I always convince myself that things aren't bad enough to take it, and get super nervous about getting overly dependent on it."
BipolarReddit,fdj8o8l,t3_el59if,1578461635.0,"I take 10mg of Abilify along with 100mg of Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) and it works super well for me. Luckily I haven't had any big noticeable side effects from it either. I've heard about the ticks you can get from Abilify, but I believe it's a pretty small chance and it's not something I've experienced. Everyone is different though."
bipolar2,eymimjo,t3_cxnb4s,1567210161.0,"Bipolar runs in families, so it’s not all from trauma. Likely there are environmental factors that can trigger it though. Hard to say what the exact balance between the two is, and could even vary from person to person."
