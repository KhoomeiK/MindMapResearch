I was trying to find a new hobby to take up, and I decided that ventriloquism was the way to go. I got a puppet from my parents (Look up silly monster puppet; it's the light blue one. I named mine Ergie) along with an arm rod and a book on how to be a ventriloquist for my 15th birthday. I started practicing, and I still do to this very day. I'm 18 now. Unfortunately, I still haven't found a voice for Ergie yet, since the scratchy one I wanted to do for him was unintelligible and very taxing on my voice.

Before we are forced enter, the aliens first make a marking on our arm - almost like a tatoo, but with some foreign substance instead. I contemplate escaping, but I know that is impossible, as I would be killed, and the restraining devices they put on us only moves at the aliens' commands. As the line gets shorter, it is soon my turn. They extend my arm, and press the probe-thingy next to it. An eternity seemed to pass, then I felt the stinging sensation. It would not stop. I started to yell from the pain, but the aliens immediately shoved me onto the ship and slammed the door shut. 

It was too crowded. We could barely move at all. We soon found out why. Without any warning, we were immediately lifted up into space in the ship. I was lucky enough to be able to see through a window, and I knew that this would be the last time I would see Earth.

They lived right next to a river, and would help other travelers and families cross it. About once a month, they would have a party at their house to catch up with neighbors and newcomers. The parents would often leave their babies on a bed to sleep while they talked with other adults, and take their baby with them when they left in the wee hours of the morning. My great-great grandfather with his friends went in the baby room one night during a party, and switched the blankets on the babies. No one else knew what happened until morning, when they could see that the baby they were holding clearly wasn't theirs.

I would recommend getting a CDL, a special license which allows you to drive different vehicles, such as a school bus or a  semi truck. Working as a part time trucker or bus driver could help you earn some money. 

I'm not sure if your local school district(s) do this, but see if you can become a part time janitor. Where I live, they have very flexible hours, and you basically come in whenever they need you, mostly after large home games. That would help bring in a little extra.

If you aren't afraid of needles, you could sell your plasma if you live in a big city. Depending if you can donate twice a week, you can get about 70 USD by donating plasma. That only takes about an hour, less depending on your body type.
