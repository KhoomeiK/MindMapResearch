She was super skinny, but friendly, so I started feeding her.  After a couple weeks I took her in to my vet to have her scanned for a chip, since I had a feeling she was either abandoned or lost.  She didn't have a chip, but according to the vet tech she was in heat.  I then took her in to the city shelter. (The one where I live is really good)  She was in for about a month before she was put up for adoption, then adopted almost immediately!"

SaturatedFat,fffeb0z,t3_et99k8,1579882082.0,"Pop down to your local hardware store and buy a box of TSP.  Modern dishwashing formulas are suboptimal due to anti-phosphate environmental regulations, and don't work nearly as well as they used to.  You only need to add a teaspoon or half a teaspoon to each load, along with your regular dishwasher powder.  See how it works for you over a couple of weeks.

And if you're worried about the environment, dishwashers contributed almost nothing to the phosphate load before the new regulations were put in place.  It's a stupid rule.

Edit: Just saw that you have a smaller dishwasher.  Maybe a quarter teaspoon would be better to start with."

There are a few medical conditions where you actually do need to reduce salt intake, but for most people you should really be eating 2x the salt recommended by the government.  Lowest mortality is at about 4-5 grams of sodium (10-12 grams of salt) a day.  Recommendations are in the 2-2.3 grams of sodium a day range, despite the increased mortality of eating so little salt.

And the negative effects of salt (they do exist) are pretty much neutralized by upping your potassium levels.  (Eat your veggies!)"
