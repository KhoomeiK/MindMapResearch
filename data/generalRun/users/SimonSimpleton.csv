It's one of the joys of Reddit for me, when you see a 'relatively' sensible (or even inflammatory) conversation going on between two amusing user names. SparkDogPants makes an astute observation, Butler-of-Penises considers said observation and replies accordingly. Some idiot called SimonSimpleton chimes in..."

britishproblems,fdgpgyq,t1_fdgj4yc,1578404844.0,"I think it's more the fact that ""some"" front of house folk (across various industries) can come across as miserable cunts with little time for the bullshit of the people who dare speak to them. I notice this regularly with places I need to visit. I also regularly meet people who are happy to help and don't treat you like a stain upon your arrival at their station so it's swings and roundabouts really. Our gp reception team are ace for example. However Sylvia can be a complete twunt."
