I recently figured out that I probably have a dissociative disorder (likely CPTSD with slightly more pronounced dissociative symptoms, as opposed to something like OSDD) so that's at least a step in the right direction.

Edit: I wasted 10 years in therapy because, with the exception of my very first counselor,  there wasn't a single therapist willing to dive into my trauma or push me to talk about anything deeper than ""how was your week?"". And my new counselor is the first EVER that actually listened to me about some weird symptoms, instead of waving away my concerns as me being overly anxious about stuff that everyone experiences.  And I'm finally making progress for the first time in over a decade.  I wish more professionals recognized that, just because your patient LOOKS normal and can hold down a full time job, it does NOT mean that they do not have severe psychopathology. That we are not being tortured every single day of our lives."

A fair number of people with incurable/intractable depression and anxiety are that way because they endured ***trauma*** growing up, and it really fucked them up. More than they even remotely realized. Dealing with the trauma with a qualified professional is the only way to *truly* move forward. SSRIs do not undo trauma. Self-work with a professional can help ameliorate the effects of trauma though.

Edit:  And that's likely a big part of why LSD and other psychedelics help. According to research, we process trauma better during microdosing experiences.

To an outsider, this can appear like they don't have empathy. They do. They have so much that it is literally crippling and needs to be turned down somehow.
2. Alexithymia can also occur with autism. It means you can't identify your emotions.

I was horrible.....raised by abusive evangelicals but ultimately I never believed their God to be real. Despite me not being a Christian, their psychotic beliefs still impacted me. They took me to anti abortion marches as a kindergartner, etc. I remember that shit so clearly....they were handing the little girls baby dolls and I refused one because I thought the people were super creepy.

I have been on both sides of the aisle, so to speak. And evangelicals are terrifying to me because of it. They would be terrorists of they could get away with it. They believe they have divine proof they are right and therefore have no reason to entertain logic and facts. It lets them shut off empathy like a switch.

Thanks!"
todayilearned,fersw0c,t1_ferrkjc,1579358010.0,"I'm still confused. Apparently I have no idea what the difference between a bush and a shrub is. Because TIL that I have a bilberry AND an blueberry plant in my backyard. I thought one of them was just a mutant blueberry bush haha. The blueberry bush puts out a lot more fruit. Not surprising, I guess. Considering it is the native species.


But....they look almost the same, aside from size and fruit output. (Blueberry bush also has slightly darker leaves IIRC)  Why is one a shrub and one a bush?? Who makes these rules? And why was I not informed?


Edit:  THEY'RE ALL SHRUBS!  I HAVE A SHRUBBERY!   

>Bilberry plant information tells us that both are berry shrubs in the Vaccinium genus. The fruit of the two species look alike and both taste good. However, blueberries you purchase are usually from cultivated shrubs while bilberry usually grows wild.
