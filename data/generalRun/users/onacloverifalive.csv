Doctor here.

I’m going to cut to the chase. Some really low percent of inflammation is genetically modulated susceptibility . 
Some high 90% of inflammation is a combination what you eat, drink, breathe, think, and do. 

Common causes of inflammation-
physical injury: it is the mechanism of healing.

Toxic exposure: it is the mechanism of sequestration and sometimes elimination.

Lack of exercise: it is the signal to motivate activity through physiologic punishment.

Allergy: abnormal immune stimulation 

Infection: immune response to an attack on the cellular tissue of the body. 

Mental anguish: sufficient to stimulate adrenal cortical hormones and the downstream physiologic effects of shifts of the autonomic nervous system including digestion  and activity. 

Malnutrition: a catabolic and deficient state of the body and all associated physiologic response. 

Dehydration: a physiologic stress on every organ system.

If you’re looking for a reason for medical problems or the associated inflammatory process, first look at your behavior to identify the primary cause. Course corrections away from ongoing injury or exposure work far superiorly to symptom managing medications to treat most inflammation associated medical conditions."

It is an exact reflection of systemwide regulatory intervention and penalizing lack of compliance. If Medicare gives up to a 9% bonus for hiring enough bureaucrats to do all the data reporting, and up to a 9% penalty to those that do not comply (which they do at present), that promotes these positions in hospital systems and big dollars being thrown at electronic medical records systems to automate as much as possible of these imposed requirements. 

Additionally the profit margins of insurance companies are also an administrative expense as are the other side of that coin. They enhance their profits through contracting in exchange for value. Value to a payer is not just keeping costs down by having good outcomes from the care you provide and eliminating waste but also by rationing care at a system wide level to control costs and profit margins. 

All of the above amounts to an 8% premium from the entire healthcare budget spent on administrative expense alone. So an 8% premium toward the profits of healthcare related business that lobby the government to instate these requirements and a 9% premium paid basically to incentivize healthcare systems being as bloated as possible with business people jobs rather than providers is where this administrative expense is flowing."

While the legal system might be concerned about innocence or guilt it may fail to elicit the justifications of evil actions as for fear of repercussion, it is simply not the way of healthcare providers in general to cause harm. It is against our training and against our oaths, and against the nature of those that are selected at every stage for this type of work.  

Patients often feel very comfortable relating their failings, transgressions, and the contributing life experiences including wrongdoing and abuse perpetrated against them by those in their life to whom they are close and would not wish charges filed against. In many ways providers can be privy to much of the information that patients would not want to use as a legal defense, and so we likely can build different justifications for actions others would perceive as evil.

My parents and brothers grew up without any material or financial wealth. But what we did have was generations of families that supported each other. So when we needed to take a vacation we would get in the car, and travel to a relative’s home, for spring break or summer vacation or a holiday. We would do this even if it was just a condo, and they would visit us the same way even when our house was small and meager. We would also frequently take day trips and less of ten camp overnight at state and national parks. It’d it got too cold, we would get up early and crank the car for heat, then go to a fast food place once they opened for breakfast. 
Rarely when we had saved for years, we could do something more, like the requisite trip to a theme park. Sometimes we would crash at a beach or lake house with people my parents had been close friends of in youth. 

I actually became so comfortable being an excellent guest, that when I went off to college, I spent the first year without even having a campus residence, just sleeping in the floor or futon in the dorm rooms and apartments of new friends. If you are gunning for excellence, you are pulling all-nighters at times at each others’ rooms anyway, so it wasn’t even an out of the ordinary thing. If you present yourself well, always well groomed, well-mannered, and decently dressed it’s incredible how much you can get by with in life without any financial resources whatsoever. 

The manner in which my parents had accustomed me to travel in youth was actually the norm in college. Many times it was five people and gear squeezed into a car for a road trip to this beach or that festival or her lake house or his parent’s house. It was four or six or eight people to a room sometimes with air mattresses on the floor and sharing beds, but it was vacation on a budget. 

Actually right at this moment, as a middle aged adult, my wife and children and another family and a child each from two other families, and our off-duty babysitter are all vacationing in the mountains in a three story luxury cabin right by the resort slopes at well under $300 per night because the snow forecast for the early part of the weekend was bleak and at the last minute rental prices took a dive from those that would rather take less to break even than have no renters at all.

Also bear in mind that if you have the gynecologist or pediatrician do the circumcision which is incredibly common, there is no guarantee that they will be competent at it at first. I’m sure that OP is far from being the first person to have an improperly performed circumcision. 

Also people make a way bigger deal about circumcision than necessary. For all the women conditioned to thing uncircumcised penises are weird, you are as in error as a man who would not be intimate with a girl because her breasts are the wrong size or shape. The additional hygiene required is minimal , and after the foreskin gets pulled back, circumcised and uncircumcised penises appear basically the same. 

For the people that think circumcision is the same as genital mutilation, you are also wrong. The sensation producing tissue for sexual gratification and reproduction is uncompromised. The infant doesn’t respond to discomfort for more than a few seconds to minutes, if at all when topical anesthetics are used. There are also incredibly valid medical reasons to perform circumcisions such as prevention and treatment of phimosis and paraphimosis. Basically after the child reaches puberty, some foreskins have too tight an opening once the penis enlarges and it doesn’t support normal hygiene or sexual activity. Also if a tight foreskin gets retracted over an engorged glans and can’t be reduced back over, it can be incredibly painful and even strangulate the head of the penis unless emergency surgical release is performed."

Health,fert8zk,t3_eq3muh,1579358144.0,"As a full time clinician in healthcare in the US I can tell you that there is a perfectly good reason for this. There is not really a crisis of antibiotic resistance. We have hundreds of antibiotics that work perfectly well in the pediatric, young adult, middle aged, and even elderly populations. There is no selection pressure to preserve antibiotic resistance whatsoever in these populations. 

The only population that cultivates and preserves antibiotic resistance is the chronically infirmed, chronically debilitated end of life population with bed sores and bowel fistulas and incurable late stage cancers, etc. maybe also the self-destrictive IV drug abusing sexually promiscuous population as well but to a lesser extent. The reason it isn’t particularly a problem is that these are the two populations of people that without continuous ongoing maximum care efforts would die off immediately. 

This is only a crisis of and intolerance for accepting mortality of those that have reached the end of life. Even if healthy people contracted multi drug resistant organisms, their immune system would just brush them off without the need for antibiotics in most all cases. That’s probably already happening all the time with healthcare providers in a daily basis. Even though they are continuously exposed, have you seen a single article about an outbreak of these resistant organisms in healthcare providers? No of course not. Only completely debilitated people with prolonged incapacitation and illness are susceptible.

The over 200 antibiotics we already have work just fine for the other 99% of us who happen not to be dying all the time. In fact we only really need to use a handful of them. They are also the ones that best target the primary differences between bacterial and animal physiology. We could make other antibiotics, but there’s a limited number of attack sites of the bacterial anatomy and physiology that differs from humans, and we’re already using the best available ones like the cell wall and machinery of bacterial protein synthesis and replication. If we go after other processes that have more cross reactivity with human physiology, we’ll those drugs would be less like an antibiotic and more toward a chemotherapy agent. 

If you come into a hospital or doctor’s office with an infection you need treating and you’re not near death already for every imaginable other reason, odds are all the things we have to give you are going to work completely fine. What they mean in this article is that we have a worsening crisis of people that are supposed to die, just as we all are, eventually dying at some point despite all the advances of modern medicine.

Health,fdoaaj7,t3_ely86p,1578601593.0,"As a provider I always take issue with this. First of all, every single American at some point will die, and every single one that does ends up being included in these statistics. At the end of your life you certainly have a choice to spend every penny on futile care to in many cases extend life weeks or months at virtually unlimited expense until your estate runs dry, and the health care system can definitely can do that for you. 

Many if not most patients and family members insist upon this because dying is a fearful concept for some. 

Alternatively, you could get good medical advice, spend reasonably in a comfortable transition through life’s end, and leave wealth to your family for support and education and future opportunity. 

Almost no one chooses to do this because everyone from the hospitals to the funeral directors will be pleased to sign you up to spend every cent left in the estate if that is your wish.  So there is that choice and that tendency to consider. 

Almost no one can afford unlimited medical care, because medical care is expensive and requires incredible expenditure of man hours, lifetimes of training and experience, and some of the most valuable commodity goods in existence. 

And despite all this, there is almost always a way for any person to get care. They may have to go to an emergency department, or fill out paperwork for Medicaid or Medicare, or pay for insurance, or take literally almost any full time job of any kind to be eligible for health insurance, but there is always, always a way to get care. And even if you can’t pay for it, but you show up an unlimited number of times and rack up a bill that is impossible to pay, we will still give you unlimited care, write off most of your bill, and negotiate a payment plan based on what you can afford. 

There is this other little problem too: all the people destroying themselves. It would be different if American adults were by and large trying to be healthy. But they are not. Half of them are overweight, over a third obese, a quarter of them smoke. They drink alcohol to excess, even when pregnant. They smoke meth, snort cocaine, inject heroine, and pop oxy to escape the misery of not maintaining their life balance. They don’t exercise, they drink high fructose corn garbage, and they barely move. They agree to work three shifts a day for less pay than can support a household and don’t realize it’s as much their fault for failing to accrue skills to move up in the workplace and negotiate their increasing value as it is the slave drivers that profit on the pain of their backs and the fatigue of their minds. 
Well here’s the thing: rescues are expensive, preparation less so. Bringing the right gear and experience to survive a hike is vastly less expensive than a helicopter rescue. Americans today wreck their lives so severely and consistently that not just the ER visits but even office visits are doing damage control on a full scale disaster. That is why Americans are really dying prematurely. They make every effort to destroy themself and then complain that they can’t afford the latest set of magical pills that string them along living with disease rather than correcting the problems of their making through their life dysfunction. 

I’m a provider that sees patients in every setting from the clinic primary care to the ED to the operating room, ICU and medical floor, even for mental health and family dynamics problems. All day every day we care for smoker, drinker, substance abusers with poor stress management that are overworked, lacking sleep, that eat garbage, and drink calories for hydration that expose themselves to chemicals at work and petroleum makeup, and food with preservatives and dyes and processed flour and sugar all day every day. 

You want to know how often we get a patient that eats whole fruits and vegetables, a moderation of high quality meat, that avoids toxic exposures, gets adequate sleep, manages healthy social relationships and exercises that comes in dying before age 80? Virtually never. We never see those patients come in dying. We don’t even see them come in with medical problems. They don’t get diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease. They don’t have breathing problems, their organs don’t start to fail. They don’t get vitamin deficiencies and mostly they don’t get cancers unless they have some inherited genetic condition with abnormal cellular machinery throughout their while body. 

Yeah, there’s type 1 diabetics that need insulin. We’re not talking about the teeny, tiny minority of patients that are getting screwed in the price of medicine because everyone else is overusing the system and driving up the total costs dramatically. Those people should just be given the medications they need to live. We as a society can easily afford that for those kind of incurable conditions. 

But I’ll tell you what, the healthcare system will take much better financial care of our patients if the majority start developing some accountability for their health.

It is not required to overdose on methamphetamine for it to be lethal. 

It is a potent systemic vasoconstrictor and is frequently laced with all kinds of impurities and contaminants. 
Also users frequently inject intravenously and subcutaneously and also frequently neglect nutrition and hygiene.

The failure of heart and other organs, or infectious complications of typical methamphetamine abuse would be sufficient to be lethal without aggressive and timely medical interventions even over short durations of use I.E. just a few years. 

The reason treatment is so expensive for meth abuse is because it is costly and heroic efforts with frequency: debridement if infected tissue, prolonged courses of hospitalization for sepsis, frequent amputations of toes, feet, and legs, placement of pacemaker defibrillators for destroyed heart tissue, heart valve replacements for endocarditis, treatments of burns from lab explosions, and management of chronic organ dysfunction requiring maintenance medication which they do not take. It’s not uncommon to see meth addicts in their twenties with heart failure, kidney failure, diabetes, and amputated legs. 

There are a lot of drugs that people could abuse recreationally, but you have to have a special kind of self destructive death wish to use meth. There are frequently some concomitant other destructive behavioral components such as malnutrition, tobacco abuse, alcohol abuse, sexual promiscuity, and the like. The meth abuse just happens to be one of the more potent contributors to the downward spiral of a life.
