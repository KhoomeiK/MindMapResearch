Any will to stop an addiction is improvement bro
Nicotine from vaping is just as hard as quitting from a real cigarette.
I’ve been vaping for 7 years and the withdrawals were hell for me considering I was using salt nic 50mg 
We get our dopamine fix by instant gratification. 
I’ve gotten sooo much more energy from morning to night without nicotine as my body would use that energy for a dope fix when I was still vaping. Feels good to not rely on vaping to feel relief, I had super bad anxiety while on it too."
