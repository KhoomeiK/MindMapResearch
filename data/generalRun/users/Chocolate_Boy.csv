Yes, post-renaissance post-reformation denominations often prefer the renaissance Italy Jesus. Since they were spread by post-Renaissance Europeans with their Jesus and not say black Jesus or Chinese jesus (who looks waay in line with the Confucian elder), who were popular elsewhere."
AskReddit,ff97ly2,t3_esd3b7,1579706715.0,"Jesus is not always portrayed as a white man (white jesus probably wouldn’t have gotten many followers in Asia).

The Jesus that caught on in Europe/the West was originally made that way to flatter a Renaissance art patron (ie: I’ll make Jesus look like the guy that commissioned this painting, and maybe he’ll give me bonus). That version caught on in Europe, Europeans conquer other places and keep their version of jesus, and now some Italian guy from the 1500s is the default Jesus in the West/all over the world.

EDIT: his face I mean. You know the one. He’d been depicted with a beard and long hair way earlier than that."

AmItheAsshole,fcq3g0w,t1_fcpy73e,1577877886.0,"Yea NTA and I’m also now wondering whether OP’s method might be the best way to not forgive someone. Never considered the route she took.

Pretending not to remember could have the effect of diminishing the bully’s own view of herself and her importance in other people’s lives. But it also might allow her to write it all off as no big deal.

On the other hand, looking her straight in the eye and saying only “I don’t and will never forgive you” makes your position clear as day, but also gives her the opportunity to look back and think “I tried. I’m only human. It’s on her if she doesn’t want to forgive like Jesus would have.”

Real head scratcher here. I’m on the fence. 

Also, I fully acknowledge that many would consider giving this much thought towards shaping one’s response for maximum impact assholish. But we live in a world of assholes, and I’ll take most any opportunity to shit on an asshole if it’s not too much work.

EDIT:   wait, I’ve decided! The middle ground gets you the best of both worlds.

Look her in the eye and sternly (but indifferently) say “I don’t remember you, X” so that it’s obvious you’re lying. Just stick to that line the more she bothers you."
