If you're afraid of green tones (I kind of am) avoid dyes with a green/blue-green base, or make sure that your hair is toned to perfection before you dye it.

My most recent experience with blue was fine. When it started fading out, I used purple toners/shampoos to keep a cool tone on the blue, then when it got light enough just went for bleach baths to clear out the color. I didn't have issues with green after I corrected my initial mistakes!"

SkincareAddiction,fcwkjy5,t1_fcwk64q,1578028170.0,Found it! https://www.instagram.com/p/B42cnmbnjg_/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet
SkincareAddiction,fcwk8fy,t1_fcwk64q,1578027906.0,They did! I'll see if I can find it :)

The filters are DHHB and Ethylhexyl triazone, from a quick google (https://danlovesskincare.com/things/purito-green-level-unscented).

Edit: Another search: Uvinul A Plus and Uvinul T 150 (https://labmuffin.com/purito-sunscreen-review-safe-sun-unscented-sun-comfy-water-sun-block/)"
SkincareAddiction,fcwir38,t1_fcwib9g,1578026719.0,"Ughhh yepp. My lab notebook at work is full of solution recipes and conversions that on a good day I remember, and on a normal day I'm like ""..... please God give me knowledge."" I genuinely struggle to remember if I used Differin or AHA last night, and which days I use vitamin C. My routine is complicated enough (because I like it that way) that I need to mark things down if I'm going to be 100% right every time

Also adding: I write down every single recipe I like. Doesn't matter if it's the most basic bread dough I know how to make. It's in a book because I just don't have it stored in my head where I can find it"
SkincareAddiction,fcwdc95,t3_ej7wz1,1578022786.0,"Apparently a LOT of people have issues with the original scented version. It contains essential oils, which a lot of people tend to react to. I LOVE the unscented and have picky skin (I get VERY red and patchy), but have never reacted to it"
SkincareAddiction,fcwc93y,t1_fcwbtr9,1578022060.0,"O I didn't notice downvotes :( I'm at +3 right now.

I feel like in general people don't want to be told they have to try harder than they already are, but that's clearly not what this post is about. We all enjoy our skincare differently and I love dedicated lists for everything (I'm a scientist, it's literally what I do)"
HumansBeingBros,fcwc0ws,t1_fcve4mb,1578021910.0,"It's happened to me. I'm a 105 lb woman (benching 65 lbs max, I'm trying ok) and I go to the gym alone. Because I'm alone, I put the damn guard up so it can drop about an inch from my chest. I can get out from under it. I don't need random people coming to try to spot me. It gets really old. If I'm struggling, kindly observe the BRIGHT YELLOW guards that are clearly protecting me from my weakness, thanks."
