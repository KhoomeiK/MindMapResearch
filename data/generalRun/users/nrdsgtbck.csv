AskMen,ffhzmh0,t1_ffgo5uj,1579960463.0,"That’s the point of the show, though. I’m not sure why people can’t understand this. 

Big Mouth is about being a teenager and going through puberty, when literally everything is awkward and uncomfortable. The only part of the show I really don’t like is Coach Steve. It’s like one of the writers hates some guy named Steve in real life so they made him the weirdest most awkward character I’ve ever seen in any form of media."

This show was one of the main reasons Disney said fuck the EU, so they could invent their own bullshit lore as they went along. It’s also cringey as hell with their blatant copying of the Dothraki from GoT.

At the time of its discovery, about 8 months after formation, radioactivity near the Elephant's Foot was approximately 8,000 roentgens, or 80 grays per hour,[2] delivering a 50/50 lethal dose of radiation (4.5 grays)[8] within five minutes.[2] Since that time the radiation intensity has declined enough that, in 1996, the Elephant's Foot was visited by the Deputy Director of the New Confinement Project, Artur Kornayev,[a] who took photographs using an automatic camera and a flashlight to illuminate the otherwise dark room.[10]

He didnâ€™t give you shit for taking public transport. 

You sound like one of those types that misreads something, takes it out of context, then blows it out of proportion so you can justify to yourself and others why youâ€™re mad (for good examples of this, just open any random CNN article).
