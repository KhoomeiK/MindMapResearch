boardgames,felgrki,t1_fel3x6p,1579221800.0,"yupppp. i played online and with my friends for ten years before i stepped foot into a convention game.

the convention game was miserable. made me question what i considered to be my absolute favorite game of all time (werewolf) just because of how unfun convention goers seemed to be able to make it.

but, i realized that a lot of people are playing SOCIAL (deduction) games, and not (social) DEDUCTION games, and that's cool. it just means i keep playing with my own friends."
