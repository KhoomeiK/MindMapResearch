I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to but I included ""up to"" because the judge has discretion in deciding the judgement amount I believe.

According to the law I could have requested double the amount and I made mention of that in my court filing. However at the hearing I said I would be satisfied with only being returned what I was owed due to the landlord only being 5 days past. The judge could have awarded me double if he wanted to."

>Horticulture is the profession that nurtures, produces, installs, and maintains the built landscape, and protects, restores, and manages existing and natural landscape resources. The Temple horticulture curriculum is built on a strong scientific foundation that includes both technical course work and hands-on learning experience. In order to broaden and deepen knowledge and understanding of the natural and cultural world, students also receive solid education in the liberal arts.  
&nbsp;  
>  
>Our unique curriculum is one of the few undergraduate programs in which horticulture and landscape architecture are integrated. This relationship allows students to gain a greater understanding of the full range of the landscape process, which includes design, plant production, installation, and management of the urban and suburban landscape. They learn the relationships between horticulture, technology, and natural ecological processes, and develop a responsible horticultural approach toward the environment. The department encourages students to consider ways to eliminate many outmoded, environmentally damaging practices such as over-dependence on pesticides, herbicides, and irrigation, and use of harmful, invasive plants.  
&nbsp;  
>  
>Graduates find exciting professional opportunities in landscape contracting, restoration, and management; wholesale or retail nurseries; urban forestry; floriculture; public horticulture; garden restoration; horticultural therapy; and interior plantscaping. Research, teaching and extension are also rewarding areas within the horticulture profession."
