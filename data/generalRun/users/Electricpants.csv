From lung.org...
[Smoking](http://www.lung.org/stop-smoking/smoking-facts/health-effects.html), a main cause of small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, contributes to 80 percent and 90 percent of lung cancer deaths in women and men, respectively. Men who smoke are 23 times more likely to develop lung cancer. Women are 13 times more likely, compared to never smokers.11

Between 2005 and 2010, an average of 130,659 Americans (74,300 men and 56,359 women) died of smoking-attributable lung cancer each year. Exposure to [secondhand smoke](http://www.lung.org/stop-smoking/smoking-facts/health-effects-of-secondhand-smoke.html) causes approximately 7,330 lung cancer deaths among nonsmokers every year.12

Nonsmokers have a 20 to 30 percent greater chance of developing lung cancer if they are exposed to secondhand smoke at home or work.13"
