Regardless though, even if you are armed, backup is always good. For some reason, if something goes down and you have a gun, arguing in a court of law about why you shot some poor defenseless disabled person (because that's how their attorney or their family attorney will spin it) is never justified, and you, your site, and your company need to compensate the loved ones that couldn't have been bothered to take care of this person while they lived suddenly think their life is worth millions now.

Of course, one of those is ""give them money anyways, you judgmental fuck!""  


But what are we going to talk about? Some common interest? They have no real interests except getting their next need fulfilled, and we're all marks to get that.  


It's just easier to do what everyone else does and ignore them, because just by talking to them you're encouraging them to act out at you."
securityguards,ffq8bte,t3_eujzkp,1580125654.0,"We're often the first people that are made aware of these issues, we're the link that calls emergency services. It's harder to have empathy when you know that just dealing with them can mean a lengthy incident report, or at worst, a physical altercation if you're stupid or unlucky.

Transient people are a common occurrence at my site too. We have vendors and employees that refuse to lock up their vehicles, and get upset when shit is stolen. This is downtown SF, smash and grabs are just part of being in the City.

Mostly we'll just ask them to leave if they're on our side of the building, basically, we tell them that we aren't really interested in what they do the next alley over, but they can't camp out here.

And yes, it's always a sob story. I get from a sociological perspective the causes of drug abuse, and what happens when you take away basic safety nets. I live and work in the San Francisco area, where a milder climate, plentiful tourist/scranging opportunities, social services, and ridiculous rental prices ensure a lot of homeless. Closing down the hospitals in the late 60's and defunding of the programs that were supposed to stop that gap left a huge festering problem.

But the reality is, many homeless, who need the most help, are the hardest to help because they're assholes. You give them an inch, they take a mile, and then it's your ass. Like, when businesses let them use the bathroom and they break open the toilet paper holder and steal a whole roll of industrial toilet paper, shoot up or smear shit on the walls, or when you let them come in and get water and they take soda instead, leave all their crap around like they're a college kid back home for Spring Break.

And I feel you on the sleep-deprivation making things more challenging. My ability to ""count to ten"" is severely depleted when I haven't had sleep for 24 hours or something.

It also sucks that you don't have a partner for backup. This guy was just being a bit creepy and annoying, but having someone to watch your back could mean a lot in an situation where things get violent.

Good luck and stay safe."

securityguards,ffoaoje,t1_ffo8zrh,1580075775.0,"Well, yeah— I could write a blog about the bullshit that the previous shift does to make our jobs more difficult, but as my coworker who has been on graves since the building opened tells me, if I got mad at swing for not doing their job, I’d always be mad. I’m just glad I got into the habit of checking the doors to see they’re not manually left unlocked every night because I can’t trust them to do it. 

And even when they are locked, the doors are overpriced pieces of shit. There was this homeless dude that just kept yanking on the door like a methed out homeless person is wont to do, and for some reason, it opened despite being locked. Now my aforementioned coworker had to stay behind the desk while waiting for slow-ass emergency services while corralling oblivious employees that didn’t think to maybe give space to the tweaker in the lobby."
securityguards,ffo74iu,t1_ffo49vq,1580074819.0,"Okay, that’s a decent critique. While sober people will ask to come in and use the bathroom, drunk people are more likely to force themselves in. I was bored and wanted to talk about how irritating it is when people try to enter the building without having any fucking clue where they are, and what that could mean for me and my team. I also think imparting the fact that it’s easier to keep people out than get them out once they’re in is important.

If you wanted something spicier I could have written about the time I had to call the cops on a dude who, after I 86d him for stealing drinks from other customers, decided it was better to lay in the rain shitting  himself with his pants halfway down his ankles while calling me Papi and asking me to help pull him up again, as I also had to make sure people in the parking lot didn’t run him  over and emergency services found 200 bucks in his pocket.

securityguards,ffo4li4,t3_est3fv,1580074098.0,"First off, congratulations on your first job. That’s a big deal. 

Second, learn your post. Read your post orders. Try and become familiar with policy. You’re going to work with a variety of people, and that means trying to learn how to get a long with people that you might not have otherwise associated with. You did some college, so you might be familiar with that concept already.

 Your job is to observe and report, you’re not a cop, even if sometimes people see a badge and uniform and project that. You’re going to be an authority figure in a way, and there are people who resent those— it’s nothing personal.

 Your job is also customer service, and learning how to both be tactful but also have boundaries is key. The quality of the job can vary wildly depending on the post. Every shift has its own quirks. 

Resist the temptation to always eat fast food. Try and pack something with complex carbs and drink water. If you don’t already, start some form of exercise regiment. That will help with stress relief, but also help with energy. 

Try and invest in some better boots/shoes when you get some pay under your belt. I can’t tell you how much they’ve saved me from wear and tear over the years. 

Check your hours. Some companies are bad about paying you what you’re owed. 

Try and work well with emergency services."

I would suggest reaching out to Student Housing. I used to live in Student Housing at SFSU, and while I know they're different schools, I was basically told that they weren't going to actively evict a student living there. You might have a big chunk of debt that will prevent you from enrolling in Fall 2020, or keep you from getting your diploma, but you shouldn't have to worry about being out on the streets.  


I would also talk to the Bursars/Admissions and explain your situation. Perhaps they might be able to make an exception knowing the circumstances. It looks like it's a catch-22, not a lack of aid at all.  


Lastly, I'm really sorry this is happening right before the semester. School is stressful enough without this crap. It gnaws at you and saps your energy.

securityguards,fdmhdn4,t3_elspjt,1578549961.0,"I've been working graves at my current post for over 9 months. Before that, I was a bouncer part-time--  I'm a night owl by nature.  


The best thing you can do for yourself is to develop sleep hygiene. You're doing a challenging thing metabolically speaking. If you're young, it can be easier-- I'm in my early 40's and I've found that while I can go without sleep for upwards of 24 hours, it takes me longer to recover.  


This means making sure you have something like blackout curtains, at home, your roommates know that you're working graveyards. On your days off, try and mantain a similar schedule.  


It can be tough-- especially if you work weekends, because this is the time people are either asleep or social.  


I've found that your work quality will depend heavily on your particular post. Is it in an office building where employees have 24-7 access? Do you have a site supervisor or are is there someone from the field office that regularly checks? Are you exposed to the elements? Is your site in a part of town where personal security is an issue?  


Staying up can be hard. In some ways, it's one of the toughest parts of the job-- especially if you have had a bad day's sleep. This is why I point to sleep hygiene.  


Keeping your mind busy is important-- some ways are better than others. For instance, you could be texting your boss on the phone, but an employee will see that and assume that you're slacking off and possibly complain (if they're jerks). However, you could be playing Candy Crush on a laptop, and it could look like you're working.  


If you do bring a laptop, I'd suggest avoiding something that looks like a Gaming Laptop-- that looks like a toy. Also, be mindful of how the Internet works at your building-- some IT departments will be monitoring usage. If they do, see if your cell phone allows tethering and you have a plan that allows for it.  


I would suggest working a week or two before getting that familiar though.   


Try and be mindful of overuse of coffee and energy drinks-- especially at the end of your shift. Try and get up and stretch if you can. If you don't already, I would suggest an exercise regiment such as weight lifting or some form of cardio on your days off. This will help with your energy levels and your body's resistance to stress. Try and pack food that has some complex carbohydrates, something that is more substantial than Ramen noodle cups or fast food.  


Always remember you're at work. Someone advised falling asleep in the bathroom. I would highly recommend against that. If you have coworkers that will cover for you, that is one thing, but if you're the only person on site at the time and something happens and you're asleep? You're up shit creek without a paddle.
