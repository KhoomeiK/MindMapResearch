marketing,fgxwduh,t1_fgwnf7m,1581177276.0,"Wow, that’s quite the journey.  Pretty awesome in my opinion, takes a leap of faith for sure.  
But yeah, I think just soak in as much  as you can.  Analyst roles at agencies are typically easy to get into if you have a little experience, and many well staffed ones will do some excellent training.  Get some of that intensive training for a year or so and you can start looking around or try to move up.  Marketing is a great industry because you can always work harder or smarter to enhance your value.  Do that and you become more marketable yourself.

Good luck!"
marketing,fgv2x43,t3_f0c0zr,1581135622.0,"Though this isn’t uncommon, there are better companies and people out there who get it.  I hate that sales driven bullshit.  They get their way for a while but it eventually ends up burning out the staff.  Always die for a course correction.  I know of companies that actually train their sales people to NOT do certain things and it’s a very successful and high growth plan."
marketing,fgv2b87,t3_f0jpz1,1581135140.0,"Try meetup groups.  You can meet some great people and friends through those, and like-minded too. 

I’ve also been fortunate enough to work with someone who was on the way out, he was a seasoned veteran at the time and I was very inexperienced.  I’ll admit, it was great what did learn while I could.  Unfortunately you won’t get that your current job.  

Read, practice, read, repeat.  

Here’s topics I would get a strong level of learning on through YouTube, LinkedIn Learning courses, certification studies etc:

1.  Excel.  Just do this. Become an excel guy.  In marketing, you’ll have opportunities to find what’s working and what’s not by analyzing data sets.  High excel knowledge let’s you slice data in more meaningful ways.

2.  Google Analytics / Tag Manager.  Study up and take the GA IQ exam and get 100% on the test.  Take it again until you do.  Used to be that the trickiest questions that most people failed were the most insightful about how basically all tracking works.  Simo Ahava was always my favorite blog on GTM too, you can do soon cool things through a tag manager.

3.  Google Ads certs, Gr the advanced certs.  You could go for the Facebook Blueprint exam also, though I’ve heard is intense, all the better.

4.  For SEO get to know Search Console, and read all the fundamentals from SEO Moz (maybe there’s others that are better but they had some fundamentals and then fresh blog content).  Don’t skip out on understanding Local Listings if you do any local marketing.

5. Oddly enough, learn some web dev.  HTML/CSS is a great place to start and can be beneficial for a long time to come.   A big part of marketing (SEO/SEM/Social) is about what the experience is like after a user clicks.  Understanding how to affect user behavior after you analyzed it can be super useful.

6.  Bonus - add in to number four, get to know crazy egg heat maps or any heat maps/experience analysis.  Combine that with Google Analystics know how and you got a stew goin.

From here there’s still plenty to go for:  CRM/ROI analysis/integration/impact.  other analytics platforms like Adobe & tables are sought after skill sets.  Brand listening, audience segmentation, DMP management, DSP’s, on and on.

You got this, friend."
marketing,fgv0dw8,t3_f0lq6v,1581133666.0,"I’m so confused. You were a 28 year old intern with $1650 over 11 months budget.  This was either a great first timer experience (why at this point in your life though), or it was a terrible job and company and the experience was shit. 

You could of course use the very fortunate title of Marketing Director to your advantage and apply for a similar title (which is a title that took me 8 goddamn years of agency experience from ground level up to earn).  I would imagine you’ll end up in a pickle when anyone catches on to the type of experience you’ve had so far, you may even have a hard time landing another director role as they typically require 7-10 years experience in a field, and certainly a more substantial budget to be responsible for.

My take, go work for an agency, or as a marketing coordinator or marketing associate, associate marketing analyst etc.  you might land marketing analyst or marketing manager. Associate are the roles your experience commands right now ( it doesn’t sound like you had much to work with anyway in that time, so I’m not sure how much of that you’d bring to the table elsewhere).  Be prepared to learn a ton.  Take it from there.  You could scale a legit agency or business pretty quickly having the Director experience, but my guess is you’ve still got quite a few fundamentals to figure out.  After all you started out without a trainer or true marketing mentor, right?"

He’s basically trading 30 minutes of pay for that extra convenience.  If he wasn’t married at all, this wouldn’t be anyone’s problem but his own, which he clearly doesn’t see as a problem.

I don’t know your financial situation, but if money is tight, then I’d say you need to address it, or demand he gets a higher paying job to compensate for the needed money."

marketing,fg5nva3,t1_fg5kmp0,1580532781.0,"So, when I was in sales for a cheap-ass web design company, I learned all I could about SEO, and then Google Analytics.  We sold SEO packages with our websites, so I learned a bit mostly by asking questions for my own “consultative” purposes.  My employer at the time had fantastic SEO rankings, and outsourced shitty web design to India.

I then took all the digital marketing certifications I could.  Getting those exams ( AdWords fundamentals, Google Analytics IQ) took lots of studying that helped me understand digital concepts.  I jumped in on some of my sales clients and attended seo meetups. 

From there I started hacking away at job applications.  My resume made sure to fit in mentions of “seo planning” etc.  any related thing I did, I included it.  Certifications, etc.  I did a few SWOT analysis type situations to catch the eye of hiring managers.  

I eventually landed a job taking over for a SEO/SEM manager for a small local agency.  The owner said he liked my attitude and drive and hired me pretty easily.  In hindsight, the guy was just a cheap-o and wanted as close to the real thing without paying for it.  I was happy to oblige.

I learned a lot about local seo, paid search, web analytics.  Got raises and helped the business grow by handling digital marketing work for the agency, some client interaction, etc.  the raises seemed huge, but again in hindsight I was a cheap hire and helped keep everything afloat managing over 100 paid media accounts etc.  each sale was building the value of the ongoing business for the company owner.  lots of political heartache, arguing for my own worth, but maintained eventually hiring SEO help, splitting work.  Stayed with them 4 years until then... the company was acquired.  That led to further opportunity and put me in a good place to run marketing campaigns/department and grow a team for this new company.  I’ve been with the acquiring company 5 years now.  

At current I’m bored as shit and ready to find a new gig, go solo or something.  This post had me inspired to go the SWOT analysis again..."

Just think, you could deliver a million impressions to 20 people with a ridiculous (and unrealistic) frequency, you still have to pay for that delivery.  You can’t just get a bunch of free impressions because someone already saw your ad.  Each impression is delivered via an auction taking place in about 20 milliseconds to see who wins control of that ad space.  

There’s other niche delivery models such as CPC, Viewable CPM, you may even find a unique cpm, but plan on paying absurd higher prices for any of that.  In the end you’re always paying a calculation against true CPM.  Even CPC is really just CPM that requires at least one click."
