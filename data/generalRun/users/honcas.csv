So https://blog.programster.org/zfs-record-size states that a file will be stored in blocks of *varying* sizes (up to the recordsize). I don't know what the smallest block can be (presumably the size of the disk's block, or based upon the ashift?) But it seems like Chris' analysis is correct. If the file takes up more than one record, it will consume an amount of data which is a multiple of the recordsize. But this means that **per file** the most you will ever save is *recordsize - blocksize* (if I'm reading and assuming correctly.)"

This is a factor in any modern filesystem. There will always be a smallest block size that will be taken up by every block. Compression will not change this behavior, although if compression can compress 2 blocks into 1 or less, then you still get an improvement in storage."
