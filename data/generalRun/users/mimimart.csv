Exactly this.

You don't know how to handle your emotions and hormones and changing body, you just don't have the skills yet *because you're a child.*  You have to learn those things. That's ok. 

When I was 12 I learned 'my father loves me even when I'm a complete little shit' and coping skills...she's learned 'my parents argument is more important than my feelings, hobbies, and actual physical *hunger.* I shouldn't involve my parents in my interests because it will backfire and they will fight.'

She's also going to feel like she was the one who 'made' mom & dad fight and probably feels guilty when it's 100% not her fault.

Usually it was only a few weeks or months, just until things could get sorted at home.
The whole point was so that these kids could *go to* school, get proper sleep, eat well, etc. They always had to treat my sister and I well and we were always put first in terms of comfort in our own home.  They slept in a pullout in our bedroom and went to bed when we did. My father treated them all as he would his own children, not extra adults.... and 15 is just ridiculously, tragically young for this boy to have no real adult guidance.

I would ask you the same that you asked of me -- please don't make assumptions.

You mentioned none of this originally, am I missing something?  I had literally nothing but your comment to base anything on- which you specifically asked for my thoughts- and it only spoke of hijabs in general along with your male coworker and his qualities, so I'm not sure how I could possibly not interpret it as I did.  It's worded in a way which lumps all hijabi wearing Muslim together. English isn't my first language so maybe I'm missing something.  

I'm sorry your  coworkers wife feels this way in her community, but as you were asking me about mine, I can tell you it is NOT normal to be called *a harlot* for not wearing a hijab.  

Yes, there are a lot of people acting in bad faith, and the ones who ask questions veiled as concern, based on their experience with exactly one Muslim they know tend to be the most grating. Racists you can just tell to fuck off, but shit like that is just exhausting.

A few.

>  But over the years he has brought up his wife wearing a hijab several times and **he seems to think that it's her decision to wear it.**

Because it is. Literally part of our faith, as I stated above: The woman is the one who chooses to wear it. Nobody else. 

>   Which I feel sorta weird about. I want to respect everyone's autonomy, but I also have to wonder if it's a garment that's only worn as a tool of oppression, even if people are ""choosing"" the oppression. For instance, **if his wife didn't wear the hijab, his family would think she was a harlot.** And even if they didn't, members of their mosque would. And even if they didn't, other Muslims they encounter in daily life would. And he doesn't have a little girl yet, but if he did, and even if the hijab were her choice... Would it really be her choice?

You know literally none of this. I've never worn a hijab and about 50-60% of my female Muslim friends don't. They aren't considered 'harlots.' FFS. If you want to make such broad statements, learn a tiny bit about the religion and don't make assumptions like this.

> I hope my comments don't offend. First and foremost, I respect the autonomy of others, and **I mind my own business.**

....

>  I definitely don't tell others how to live their lives. But I have always wondered how much of a choice that really is. Do you have any thoughts to share?

So here's the thing. In the US, right now, it would be strange for me to walk outside bare chested. Perfectly legal, and within my rights. I mean, why not? I like my body just fine. But I like to keep those for myself and for my wife.  They are special and it makes me happy to be able to share my body with one person alone, just for us, and to buy pretty lingerie only 2 people in the world ever see.  
Women taking hijab or wearing modest dress feel this way about their bodies. *It's theirs.* It is just for them and their partner, if they have one.   Honestly, I get it. I hate being stared at by men and dress pretty modestly in terms of lengths/avoiding fitted clothing because I don't like being catcalled. It's very freeing to not worry about leers on the subway.  
I have a feeling many women of any/no religion understand that position as well. Avoiding the male gaze when it is unwanted is NICE. It's nice to not show off any extra weight gained or lost, and avoiding any comments another woman might make about your body as well.  My mom (and many other Muslim women) don't even shave their legs or underarms, either. It's not considered socially unacceptable, as far as their loving husbands are concerned.  Is shaving your legs and arms so you can wear a dress in public without getting shamed empowering? I would love to feel like I could do that with confidence. 

It's also communicating who you are as a cultural group as well as religion, and another person wearing a hijab or a Muslim man sees you and you are part of that group.

On a more lighthearted note, some are just lazy as all hell and have the worst looking hair under all that. They take them off at home and I'm like, *girl.* Wash that shit. A lot of muslim girls are people of various Asian and African hair types, that is not easy to deal with. 

TL, DR: There's so many reasons you are choosing to ignore. 

Don't put your own assumptions on to someone else. You do not know why someone is wearing a hijab. It's also none of your business.

Just the act of taking up a hijab *is the womans choice*.  Obviously some pressure from family can to happen and there's a lot of debate and differing cultural norms about it, but it's certainly not set in stone.

AmItheAsshole,fdco4rr,t1_fdbmst5,1578279765.0,"It felt like that to me, too. Just assuming automatically Muslims are like ______ sucks in general, and it's worse when it's a literal picture of me.

They served quiche with hidden bacon in them (chopped into the mix and not labeled) which a bunch of us ate and had to quietly tell the rest of the family to avoid.  I hope it was just a mistake but it feels a bit ironic she wants us to embrace her culture when she isn't being considerate of our religion."
AmItheAsshole,fdcjdey,t1_fdbmo8p,1578276352.0,">  The whole garter toss and especially putting it onto the bouquet catcher ""tradition"" is A) no where near universal and B) almost always gross.

Thank you for the insight! I was surprised by her insistence of it being 'tradition' so it's good to know this isn't a common American custom I'm clueless about. I've only been to one wedding that had a garter toss to begin with, and never one where the bouquet catcher has the garter put on her-- I'd never stand to catch the bouquet if I did."

If the ceremony place has a room like this, perhaps hire an experienced sitter and bring something fun for the sister to do in there, along with an Ipad to Skype."

He always values her as an equal partner in the relationship, was cool with waiting to have kids while she pursued her dreams, was/is a super attentive father who primarily stayed and raised us.  He never gave a fuck about being 5'7 to her 6', so I suppose confidence is a big one, too. To be fair, my mom thinks he's the most handsome man in the world, and back in the 70's his giant beard/stache and flowing curly hair were considered very stylish.

AmItheAsshole,fco4xgd,t3_ei0hr2,1577824152.0,"NTA at all. However, some tips that may reassure your wife (I started riding the subway on my own around age 12)


-Get an estimate on how long it'll take and ask him to text you when he arrives, if there's any train issues, etc, you can check them on the MTA website/app.

-Get him the MTA app so he can easily see alternate routes in case of emergency

-*Write down* your number, your wifes number and a neighbor/friend number, in case he loses his phone.

-If he needs help, ask him to look for a mom or dad with a stroller. 

  Studies have shown this to be the safest person for a missing child to approach, as opposed to an MTA employee or a cop. A parent will stay with the child, let him use her phone, and will stay until she knows he is ok.  She'd hope you'd do the same for her child. Make sure he is not too shy/afraid to speak to strangers, because if he's in trouble he needs to have the maturity to tell someone.

-Make sure he know basic subway etiquette- getting up for pregnant/old people, putting his knapsack on his lap and not on the seat, and letting people out before rushing in.  No drawing attention to himself.


If the child doesn't have a phone, I'd get him a cheap bodega one at least. I'd have a good chat with your wife about how much safer the subway/city is than when we grew up, as well.  Best of luck!"
todayilearned,fcm76fn,t1_fclm049,1577766011.0,"Me, too. It's bad enough that cleaning mold without gloves left me with rashes up my arms/chest for weeks. I am also not allergic to anything else, thankfully.

Always check when doctors give you antibiotics! I have been given Amoxicillin after stating that I was allergic, luckily my partner looked at the package before I took it."
AmItheAsshole,fci8gpk,t1_fchzt67,1577659011.0,"Sorry, no! I was unclear, apologies. Her last name is super common an easy to pronounce, mine is a Scrabble 60 pointer from eastern Europe, so I'd use her last name informally for stuff like magazine subscriptions.  

Twice someone called looking for 'Mrs. Woo' and meant me, not her.  

Two of my friends have the same first name and are getting married next summer, though- not sure if that would be more or less confusing than a last name!"

daddit,fca8mel,t1_fbg1vx5,1577564742.0,"I was a kid who escaped a poor, violent situation as well. Once we moved to the US and felt safe, I started to play and do things that were more like a younger child as well. (Play with dolls, get super stoked about birthday parties, watch kids movies, at age 11) It only lasted a year or so, and is a normal response when a child recovers from a bad situation .

I can't tell you the sheer relief of a child knowing they don't have to be the grownup anymore. They can play, they can do all the kid things they've seen others do, they can experience what they thought they'd missed out on forever.  It's such a joy you get to experience that. She gets to have her childhood back.

 It really shows how happy she is, and what an amazing job you're doing as her papa.

AskDocs,fbwgncq,t3_eefrf7,1577149417.0,"What was her blood pressure the last time it was checked? I have something called vascovagal syncope, my blood pressure drops suddenly and I faint.  This started at age 14, when I had just grown 4 inches and my weight hadn't caught up to me. It's not uncommon, especially for tall/thin young women in their teens and early 20's, made worse when on your period. I had something called a tilt table test to confirm the diagnosis and had to be on medication for a short time, but currently manage my symptoms by eating plenty of salt and drinking a lot of water. If I feel faint I get to the ground (a good method is to pretend to tie your shoe) and out your head between your knees and wait) and have something to drink and something salty to eat.  

I would look into vascovagal syncope / POTS together and see if the symptoms make sense, and if possible get an appointment for a cardiologist.   Meanwhile, I would get her blood pressure checked out right away at the pharmacy and if it's low, make sure she has plenty of fluids and salty snacks to carry in her knapsack.  Poor girl, it's no fun, but luckily it can be managed. Best of luck and let me know if I can help more. I'm not a doctor but I was a teen girl and know how difficult and embarrassing this can be for her.

Good luck!"
