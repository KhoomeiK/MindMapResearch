AskReddit,fevfn81,t3_eqies2,1579396865.0,"Just a few hours ago I was walking down the street with my wife. I told her ""I really need a hair cut"". Turned the corner and a man walked out of a barber shop that had just opened and told me ""hey man, you should come in for a hair cut""

It was like an irl targeted ad."
ContraPoints,feedkiy,t3_eo6pkx,1579031551.0,Just finished a whole pass. It was a lot worse than I expected. It's waiting on someone to validate it I guess. Not sure when it'll be up officially. When I have time I might do some of her other videos.
ContraPoints,fechxmf,t1_fechp9v,1578974338.0,"No problem. Just now getting home from work, so I'll give it a pass as soon as I can. It makes me wonder about the Italian in her other videos..."

Edit: just watched the first 20 seconds and this Italian is 100% Google translated"

By weak I meant he could either tell her he didn't want to go, or stop being in a rush and just enjoy his lady's company. I personally love shopping with my wife. Gives me an idea of what she likes so I don't have to guess what to get her for her birthday or Christmas."
