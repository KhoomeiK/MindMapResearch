During my first in high school 🚸, I already felt so many things that are directly rare and uncommon. I know how it exactly feels to be talked about with the life fact of having no ""real"" friends or should I say friends whom have started to jump in for others company and because of their still immature minds, they somehow use me for too much for favors like being a personal assistant. Some of my close students do notice and they seem to care because they scold me and gave me some advises. It took me some time to realize the essence and managed to apply those things they were trying to tell me about. It's about placing a mental-social boundary, when you know that people started to take advantage (when things are getting too much, careless leaving your personhood out), I react by altering my emotions into miserably mad and angry but still in the essence of kindness. However, in spite of that, they do not really seem to value what I am even when I am already overflowing these emotions leading me to being anxious and disappointed. That's when I realized that it is sometimes hard to be kind, but, however, the truth is it is only hard when the person being kind doesn't know exactly the whole being of him/herself because when you do, you'll know exactly how to influence and move them into what you wanted them to do (realize/learn) cause I have proven and lived that already.

These types of people you got there in your work never seem to be gone anywhere for some worldly reasons. The fact that you already seemingly have everything. You got real friends? Wealthy family? The physical looks? But... your insides aren't not? I must tell you and to everyone that one of the key 🗝 to open the doors of pure happiness, joy, and companionship is to firstly know yourself as a whole. :333 Ask yourselves, who are you? ""Who am I really?"" ""Who is me?"" extending to ""What is me?"" ""What makes me a human in this world?"" ""What is my identity?"" 😲👁️. If you guys can't answer those yet, or can't answer surely with confusion and unknowingly mystery... Then, that will indicate thay you guys haven't realized and haven't yet found your ""TRUE"" self identity.
To really identify who you are is to begin understanding what makes a human a human? Think about humans? What makes us or me special among all of the living species? What makes us, human beings, unique? Imagine you're living in the woods, currently. Without any infrastructure, buildings, and these technologies. There are only plants and trees, and in here, there are animals who are making their sounds. Birds ""tweet"". Somewhere in the plains, horses are seen. Ducks swimming in the pond. A cat coming over you, making its sweet ""meow"" sound. Making you sit down and caress it. Seeing a little squarrel making its anxious sound, you come close to it, and the trees behind it made soundz, and you look up and saw squarrels. However, the squarrel can't seem to find its way up there, and you responded by carrying it in such soft touch and bring it up to their fellow squarrels branches place. The squarrels look at you, and you can sense their grateful respond for they walk calmly and relaxed defining their thanks. The air feels very comforting. Wind blows. Flower petals are seen floating by, carried by the wind, and it's attractively beautiful. You follow where it blows and lead you to the flower fields. Smelling their perfect natural sweet scents that matches what they look like in various colors and structures.
However... Somewhere over the view, you saw a big fire, burning down certain flowering field plants, you naturally sense it as a threat and it calls you for action. Your heart beats strong and mind get a more defined concentration feels. You, wonderfully feel a calling to act, as the burning smell gets to you, without hesistation, you look around over to your left and you saw stones over view, and over to your right you saw a pond. Thinking straight without hesistant, acting in surety, confidence, passionate, and liveful, you look over to the stones and pick a pot shaped naturally formed stone, together you pick large leaves and couple it around the vent of the pot, and quickly head over to the pond, sit, hovered and swing down the stone filling it with some water, aware it's gonna be enough to stop the fire. You run over the ground in mighty confidence and extinguished the fire, stopping any more burning. You became proud of yourself filled with satisfaction, knowing you stopped a possible fire disaster. Saving all of those existing lovely creations in the path. The sun's ☀ light brightens more over you, and it's heat just perfectly give the comfortable warmnesss... Opening your eyes in the real world ...🤔

What significant things did you notice and saw over there? How do you feel about yourself as the story lives? What did you realize? What do you want to do now?

Answer all of those through you. 💖💖💖"

That does seem very fine to know❣️
However if anything, don't get into too much weeds. 😅🙅‍♂️
💖"
SuicideWatch,fc2qw7o,t3_eeyc3w,1577371374.0,"Hello, I am relatively new to Reddit, but, however a relateable random situation arise at me recently leading me to Google Search, and I went through in here and I feel like I am called to do this especially towards you needing an unconditional light 😉💡✨💗. Every people has the capability to give light to others' life but not all people have learned the proper mindsets to become a light and sadly, my worldly knowledge state that this shall be natural and the variables of your life situation currently have proven that once again to me. 

Alright, in behalf of all the community enggaged with your story, I wholeheartedly can relate at what you feel because I have been there and done that. However, I have a great twist at the end of this reactional sharing. I am very honored to give you life advises based from my worldly knowledge so far 😉✨.

Let's begin 🔰 XD 😃😄😁😊😉👍,
Knowing that you are an attractive white man, probably you're a chick magnet 🤣😍👌💝💖💗❣️

Moving on to ""odds always in your favor..."" 🤔, sharing life stories regarding this can be entertaining, however, I can sense that through your words you only not going to need just such a story but some direct wisdom thoughts 💭 instead. Every actions in this world 🗺 are governed by the natural laws that we are consciously (to) unconsciously (to) not totally aware at all. Some are not even written and published out there in books for schools to teach. Hahaha. Yes, I am prodigy yet in such a very young age. XD Knowing you are a smart 🧠 guy 😄 would probably means that you expected to be willing to read such a deep and in-depth statements 😂😁 and I expected that my literary style approach would be enough-ly suitable just for you XD. Every outcomes coming from the world have certain casualties 😅 which can be a good or sad reality depending on someone's perceptions about it. But... 🤔 Even if we expected ourselves to be a smart human person that would not necessarily mean we are able to properly able grasp the real world reality concepts. More on this later... I hope every reader of this statemet of mine would appreciate it 😉.

Woah, noooo❗❗❗ You are a beautiful person to be exiting life in such ways like that. I can proprietary sense that you are not worth it to exit in this world 🗺 in that way. There are way too much to learn in this life and way too much special ways just for you to diffuse the false mentalities that are currently running in your head rn making you to think like that. 💭

I am sorry 🙏 that you got to experience your early life in such an abusive mother. I am definitely telling you that it's just that it is not the way it should be... I understand your running anxieties from there... 🤔✨💪😉But, what I want you to do is to try to list 📃 all possible thoughts running in your head that always manifest the feeling of anxiety towards you and me in return would be so willing to interpret it just for you in such wonderful ways ✨💝💖💗💛 using a powerphase of wisdom thinking 💭. You can do it by just typing it straight in your keyboard or write 📝 it first depends on which is the most comfortable for you 🧒😉👍. 🗒👁️💌First 💭 thought: Always strive to find your unique ways of doing particular things in the most comfortable way as possible, you being a loner I think is a great advantage, the healing must begin and must recommendedly be founded by you, alone, in the first place. ✨✨✨ The supporting logic is before you can share who you are to people in the first place, you, yourself, alone should be first comfortable with your own self to begin with. That means start removing the anxieties that manifest on you on your actions that correlate with loneliness. """"P.S. I really this will work because I am a loner in life and I have been in severe depression for a period of years and still in constant battle with all life challenges at the same time"""". 


😲😯😲Woah, you really also experienced those kind of stuffs in such of that age bracket of being in college. I mean, in my personal opinion, did you somehow involved in drunkenness in that period of time or what? What as in that guy spent some time stalking you and somehow took advantage of a moment to have drugged you??? If it is, it's questionable and creepy at the same time. You may have overlooked some other main real agendas over there. 😧😟😨 Anyways, it's fine because it already happened and there's no turning back xd and I believed you already moved on with that :3. Always be careful out there especially on circumstances wherein you expose yourself to risky stuffs you are not willing to do out of your permission 😊✨

😱😓Ahhh, I can pretty much relate to the fact that your mom doesn't acknowledge her own mistakes. That's like lying 🤥 to her own self... I mean there are also people out here on my environment who are like that... They probably have lose proper life acknowledgements in the process and I believe that is something to pity upon like your Mom unconsciously acknowledge or being mentally randomness her feelings and actions that are perceiving to be bad and abusive. *Sigh* I wish we all can change the world for the better. Who knows what exactly made her to be like that on her own personal side. 😪 I am neutral and care to all people no matter who they are because there are always such powerful aggressive reasons why it happens in the world... We may never know until we managed to spoke it out of them 😢😔.

✨😉😍😊💖Your are a passionate and heartful working and that one manifest your beautiful human personhood. Keep it up. Hold on with life 👫❣️ I wish like everybody else to be there personally for you so we can manage to be your life apprentice and life best friends over there. Hahahaha 😂😉👍😁❣️ Sad reality about countryside divisions and such... 😔😢 

😖🙁☹️😟😔 Those therapist diagnosis saddens me more for you 🧒💔. Listen 👂, those words are merely foundational scientifically made-up literary words so that doctors can compoundly  express and explain mental conditions in general and the underlying reasons are of your personal thing to discover because you are the one in that mind and body unless doctors can psychically ""psychic abilities"" enter and read your mind and your past to explain and teach you how to get through the harsh feelings that should be there in the first place. Doctors are body teachers but like school teachers they can also have flaws in their works. What I mean in other words is that these mental conditions shouldn't be existing to any mental deteriorated people if only our evil world 🗺 haven't lost its original good harmony it where supposedly back in the past and in the beginning... 🤔😉😔 *Sigh* 😟

Oh my... Those hook-ups and your realization it isn't helpful at all is a sad reality... 😢😔😟 In the brighter 🔆 side, there are actually hidden worldly knowledge and wisdom on the real proper usage of those sensitive organs. If only everyone is aware that every actions possible in this world have its own proper ways/methods of how it is really done then the world could have been more a better place in the current generation... 🌍🌎🗺️😟

Alcohol wouldn't really help at all. People in the general society only treat it to dismiss the world that controls them to get out of the harsh feelings that comes along with it.

Hey, do not give up life 💪, if I can personally be your life apprentice and best-friend if I can really do so, but I am financially and socially-politically incapable. There are way more thoughts 💭 for me to tell you and also tell the world but the reality that time and location division is a sad burden 😔 for me and for you. All I can stick to for now is all these chattings and commentings.

So, let's get this over to another main real deal, those therapies should have been helpful for you already and one therapy sessions can be more than enough. Believe me, it can, because I have been there and done that also. But, the most important knowledges to living life are being hidden away by the world 🗺. You went through enough. ""Enough is enough... 🎶🎼🎵🎙️"". Aa, aa, aaa, don't get it wrong, again, don't get it wrooongg XD in reality of the world naturality your body would strive to keep you alive if you scar it because it's embedded in each of us to live and live. It's illogical to think lifexenough will get along good ""life is enough???"" because life will never be enough in reality, lol XD. Everyday is an adventure originally and harmoniously to be faced with a triumphant smile. You went through there because you need to find your true self, rescue it when you have to, and bring it back to reality. 😉😁😊😂😍💪♥️💗💖😇🤓. You can do it, I know you can. We are blessed to take advantage and dominate the world in its true harmony of GOODNESS. GOODNESS ALONE IS ITS HARMONY. Not evilness because if you go in that way, the world's good harmony will return it back to you. It's bot worth it to suicide because there are more to life that we all do not expect out of our mental intelligence 🧠 to think it all out XD :3.
Goodluck with life. And please respect me because there is no doubt for me that God exists. God Bless You, bro❣️ My life can purely attest to God's existence. ""My Heart Will Go On"". Sink in the truth that life had to go on no matter what. Mistakes should not be a burden at all and we shall treat it as a life lessoner. It's the world naturality of goodness that defines mistakes as mistakes. It wanted us to follow goodness alone. Happiness is goodness, depression is evil because it weaken our whole being, not allowing us to be purely a human being blessed to dominate in GOODNESS ALONE. Hahahahaha 😂😉😊😃😄😇🙏💝💖💗💞❣️"
