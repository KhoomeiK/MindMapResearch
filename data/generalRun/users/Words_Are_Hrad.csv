was significantly closer than the ones you provided just using a  year over year on January 1st. Your numbers are all wrong... Trump inauguration was 19,827.25. 2000 points lower than your chart...

Even an ideal, frictionless engine can't convert anywhere near 100% of  its input heat into work. The limiting factors are the temperature at  which the heat enters the engine, and the temperature of the environment into which the engine exhausts its waste heat, measured in an absolute scale, such as the [Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin) or [Rankine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rankine_scale) scale. From [Carnot's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot%27s_theorem_(thermodynamics)), for any engine working between these two temperatures:[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_efficiency#cite_note-Holman-4)   
>  
>Efficiency Max = 1 - Cold/Hot  
>  
>This limiting value is called the **Carnot cycle efficiency** because it is the efficiency of an unattainable, ideal, [reversible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_process_(thermodynamics)) engine cycle called the [Carnot cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot_cycle). No device converting heat into mechanical energy, regardless of its construction, can exceed this efficiency.

If we assume the surface temperature to be 120 F and use deep ocean water at 50 F the max efficiency is 1 - ( 283.15 / 322.039 ) = 12.1%. That is ideal. So if we had frictionless machines and superconductors to make this with that's the best we could do.
