Time is critical in this moment. One thing is certain to me - you will not regret acting out of love and kindness.

Everything I’m about to suggest is going to be much easier said than done, and I can only hope for the best.

The reality of your current situation is all that matters, and all you can do is your best to make things move positively from this moment onward. Guilt, shame, regret, anger and hatred will only detract from your energy, from those with whom you interact, and serve no helpful purpose to anyone or anything under these circumstances. Live in the now, love in the now, and move forward with grace and love.

Does it truly matter (right now) whether or not what she said or did is true? It might suck, but man, these are her final days, so fuck it. To the best of your knowledge, you had an actively loving relationship with her that filled each of your lives with good memories and happiness.

For now, I suggest you actively love the living hell out of her no matter what she said or did. Pour every ounce of your heart into her for her final days just because you can, and you’re a fucking good man.

Once she’s left this earth, then definitely seek counseling/therapy. Meanwhile, don’t let whatever current bitterness, anger, or resentment potentially haunt the rest of your life on this earth with regret.

Love her and support her the same until death do you part."

A very dear friend of mine is spending her first valentine’s day in eight years with an actual boyfriend, and she’s such a sweetheart. Long overdue. Your post made me think of her for some reason.

All the best to you both!"
