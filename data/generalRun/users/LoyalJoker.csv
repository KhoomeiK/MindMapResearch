TIHI,ff9nkq4,t1_ff9mwvn,1579716739.0,It's strange it just seems so common to me. And well we all know who brought forth Hitler.
Rainbow6,ff927vw,t3_esbhst,1579703031.0,"Yes everybody knows the hatch in Armory rite.

Edit: forgot an 's'"
TIHI,ff90r3z,t1_ff90ip8,1579701921.0,Germany?
madlads,ff8lswn,t3_es3s1z,1579684810.0,Too bad. His Twitter name does not check out.
TIHI,ff8lnq7,t1_ff8cebr,1579684589.0,Looked for this comment. I mean you learn to distinguish that rather fast if one side is against the law and the other´s not.
SiegeAcademy,ff8kbxl,t3_es1djn,1579682580.0,About Aim trainer. Can I reliably copy my settings to it? Like everything from sens to FOV and aspect ratio?
DMAcademy,ff5nrhd,t1_ff5jz9p,1579602191.0,"Well you want the data and the rest of the computer seems doomed anyway.

You could even put the hdd in a case to access the data like on an USB."
DMAcademy,ff5np5p,t3_errvjw,1579602093.0,If it´s impossible to repair you can open it carefully and take the hard drive out and then just try on another computer if it´s fine.
Rainbow6,ff5mif8,t3_err71t,1579600280.0,I´m way more worried about the ADS changes to the SMG-11. Like what I gonna do. Play the FMG?
Rainbow6,ff2hkbf,t3_er3t4n,1579506434.0,He should rather rush out and get Lion´s drone in the air.
R6SiegeFashionAdvice,fesqvv1,t1_fesmimc,1579368050.0,Why would you do that if it's your skin tho. Just make a good shot in operator menu.
R6SiegeFashionAdvice,fesmewf,t3_eqhcpv,1579366773.0,Like if it´s yours why is it such a shakey end screen picture?
criticalrole,femzpfr,t3_eq0nps,1579273692.0,Must be random right?
aww,fehffut,t3_ep1m72,1579115433.0,I remember doing that as a child.
ProperAnimalNames,fegjxsb,t3_ep160t,1579095035.0,One cryptobiote a day keeps the timefall away. Why do there remind me off that.
Rainbow6,fegeqxb,t1_fegdy02,1579090232.0,"I thought more like digital simulation. Like how would a real simulation even work, they are using real guns after all."
Rainbow6,fegdsff,t3_eozvwh,1579089161.0,After this the universe makes even less sense for me. Before I thought the game we play plays is sort of a simulation which makes sense. But building a real stadium and having the operators fight there would mean they die and that´s just dumb.
AskReddit,feg6gzw,t3_eondj6,1579079219.0,Alcohol free beer.
confession,fedbutv,t1_feda01i,1579006988.0,I guess parents are often a part of the problem mate.
mildlyinfuriating,fed21x1,t3_eofm95,1578994800.0,One hand each or alternating.
photoshopbattles,fed1q7g,t3_eo8rdo,1578994307.0,That´s like a flashback where the main character as a baby still needs to be recognizeable.
aww,fecxvb3,t3_eoefr0,1578989063.0,The part of the picture where it looks like a play button confuses me.
SiegeAcademy,fe8kzrn,t3_eo3v9m,1578927348.0,I think peeker´s advantage does not work like that. According to Rogue-9 stuff.
SiegeAcademy,fe76sut,t1_fe6y69w,1578910746.0,Nothing then.-
Rainbow6,fe74hc8,t3_ennbkg,1578909862.0,He really deserved that as a Jager
nextfuckinglevel,fdnjdy1,t3_em5s0e,1578587045.0,That was fucking graceful the way the foot moves from the highest point to the ground. Just beautiful.
Rainbow6,fdjj402,t3_elku92,1578473173.0,There is some stuff missing the overview is too simple. Smoke can be anti rush as well. Echo can be a callout op as well. Just form what I play. Mute could be intel denial.
dndmemes,fdgv1nc,t1_fdgu3tz,1578409031.0,"There are so many options to be honest. Maybe the BBEG is responsoble for a loz of harm for the PC that storms in, justified behavior. The other PCs could just hold him back. Depends on how smart the inting player is.
On the other hand the DM has other options than a TPK, maybe just scar the group more give them more reason to hate him or imprison them.
There are many options yours are possibilities too."
StarWarsBattlefront,fdgogwq,t3_el57bt,1578404005.0,Don´t even play/watch or consume the game but damn that was a nasty flank. Love Droidekas
Minecraft,fdgnfab,t3_el76v2,1578403110.0,Mix the color palette a bit and try more depth. I was obsessed with Grian for a while on YouTube. Check him out if you want some neat tips.
YouShouldKnow,fdgn352,t3_el86o3,1578402812.0,Had a situation like that and tried it over the sink. I quickly felt nauseous and symptoms of fainting. Like that I went back to lying on my back.
dndmemes,fdgd0g5,t3_el8miz,1578390852.0,"Why ""German"" though. I know it can be an inspiration but does it follow any ingame logic.."
Rainbow6,fdga8sg,t3_el0ctr,1578386846.0,Deserving.
dndmemes,fdga1fu,t3_el3vg0,1578386568.0,Well if the party decides against that after the DM said that it´s metagaming. And characters have all rights to act impulsive after such an reveal. One could argue bad DMing.
aww,fdg7763,t3_ekv4qx,1578382845.0,Too bad these fuckers are almost extinct.
Rainbow6,fctn0az,t3_eijewq,1577949588.0,I'm from Germany and I dont want to tell you why the name is a bad idea.
criticalrole,fc839ai,t3_egjq24,1577525786.0,I think you guys are thinking a bit too deep about that. Fjord was dping accents in regular gameplay the whole time maybe even session zero with Jester. It is wrong to assume all. this is referencing his fake voice and not his regular accent shenanigans.
blursedimages,fbg44dn,t3_ecy94i,1576833403.0,The ting goes...
