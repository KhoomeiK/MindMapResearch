AskMen,ffp6zs0,t3_eu2ixr,1580087812.0,Avoid fights if u dont know how. I usually dont hit people unless they attack me first. Ive been boxing all of high school and did muay thai and jiu jitsu beginning of college and i still never been in a street fight before. Something about if u know how to fight ur energy radiates differently with confidence that people avoid fights with u for some reason.
