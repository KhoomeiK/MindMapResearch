Having makeup done or being conventionally attractive frequently gets the response of â€œoh you donâ€™t look like oneâ€ when I say what I do for work. Because a lot of people still assume that attractive or even put together equals ditzy or dumb for women.

You probably wonâ€™t get assumed to be the office admin if you look less stereotypically feminine either. Thatâ€™s always a fun one.

Saying a degree wonâ€™t help though isnâ€™t very truthful when in reality itâ€™s that a graduate with no internship and below a 2.0gpa isnâ€™t going to have an easy time getting employment. Regardless of what school you graduated from.

A degree on its own has almost never been enough.

And I say that as someone who failed out and took almost two years off of school. It took a lot of work and a long time for me to come back from failing grades and not get turned down because of it, even after making deans list three of my last four semesters and pulling my GPA over a point.

Thereâ€™s really two routes you can go after that. Get defensive and make excuses or really take ownership of what happened. Unfortunately, the latter is more difficult to do especially if youâ€™re not in college anymore because you need to have concrete proof of changes you made and medium term results as a result. I started study groups and quit procrastinating and it was evident in the much better grades. People like a comeback story. But they donâ€™t like excuses.

If youâ€™re really homeless, you need to start there and see what resources are available where you live to get help. Because thatâ€™s a much bigger stumbling block to getting a job than a poor GPA."
