todayilearned,ffmvthy,t3_eu5wt2,1580059449.0,"Can confirm, cubicle farms totally suck productivity. I work in a benefits-related profession, and it's impossible to have a confidential conversation with anyone about anything, let alone sensitive, personal financial information.

quilting,ffhzzef,t3_etk82v,1579960822.0,"Press the fabric nice and flat before you start. Practice making short cuts well within the ruler length until you can do it without the ruler moving.  If you are using a normal straight edge like a metal ruler, DON'T. You'll cut yourself. Get a quilting ruler that's at least 1/8"" thick and preferable thicker. You need that thickness to hold your rotary cutter against."
quilting,ffhzjga,t3_etjz1b,1579960379.0,"I do own a longarm, and rented before I bought one. Estimated time for a queen size quilt top, using a super easy loopy-loop all over pattern, takes between 90 minutes and 2 hours. This is the quickest.

Anything more complicated, like a smallish stipple, or ruler work, is very time consuming.

IMHO unless you're making a quilt for a show, the quilting you do is pretty much invisible and doesn't matter at all. Once a quilt is washed, all you see is an overall cuddly quilt. No one but another critical quilter will even look at how it's quilted.

If you have aspirations to quilting artistry like you see in the magazines, be prepared to shell out rental money and lots of time. I would not attempt an ambitious project as a beginner, nor risk your favorite quilt top until you're reasonably competent with the machine."

quilting,fev4yo3,t3_eqobxx,1579393151.0,"IMHO, I would do an all-over loopy pattern, not too small. That way you can quilt around the thickest seams and avoid breaking a needle.The piecing should be the star of the show, and not be overwhelmed with too-fussy quilting."
