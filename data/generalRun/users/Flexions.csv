AskReddit,ffdmz84,t3_esy6i5,1579824326.0,My parents are from socialist Poland. They are glad socialism is dead and hope no one will need to go through such atrocities again. Russians destroyed Poland more than the nazis during ww2 then basically occupied it. Innocent polish died in thousands. The polish culture was being destroyed. All heritage sites were robbed and the country lived in a state of fear.

pointlesslygendered,ff9ng15,t1_ff95873,1579716662.0,You'd need to have no brain cells left to think that everyone who disagrees with you needs therapy and is projecting their fears. That's something a very special person would say.

pointlesslygendered,ff8gzww,t1_ff7x29q,1579678077.0,"You are not using facts dude, I said most women you donkey. What you're using is your extra chromosome. You never addressed the actual point I made, which is that proteins for men and for women are not the same. They have different contents so both genders can take them in easier.  Go to the gym dear beta male."

pointlesslygendered,ff6gv0h,t1_ff5q42j,1579626916.0,"You never saw a packet of proteins in your life bro. I don't care I'm ignorant, I am right, most women don't use protein shakes. 70% of a packet of proteins is actual proteins you idiot. The rest is other nutrients and sugar(around 6%). You never saw a packet of proteins and probably never went to the gym. You give people your expertise although you don't know anything about the subject. People like you should go back to school."
pointlesslygendered,ff5hd25,t1_ff52k9k,1579592926.0,"You are dumb my sir. You forget there's a difference between men and women, men are on average higher and heavier. What you refer to are  proteins in a normal diet not protein shakes after you go lifting. Same with vitamins, you have male female vitamins because both genders need different types of vitamins, we are not the same and never will be, it's pure biology."
pointlesslygendered,ff4xco5,t1_ff4n831,1579574707.0,"Nah its honesty, men and women have different needs to develop muscles. I wouldn't buy female or just normal proteins, good proteins cost 40 euro for a decent sized pack. If you want quality it costs, most people who never went to the gym don't understand how expensive this is and that the bottom shelf stuff is useless because you need it to suit your body. Additionlly women don't usually eat proteins, at the gym all they do is walk along the thread mills or do leg and ass exercises,  stretches too. I rarely see girls getting those pecs or biceps. Rarely = less than 1 in 100."
