AmItheAsshole,fft7fif,t1_fft6j6u,1580210880.0,"Idk what you're on about, first of all drag queens are mostly gay men who are playing a character. Most are not trans. Second of all, men using women's bathrooms is indeed inappropriate. But you're not referring to that, are you? Trans women are using women's bathrooms because they are *women*, not men. Same goes for trans men using men's bathrooms. They're men. they can use the men's bathrooms if they so please.

Unisex toilets have been a thing since forever. You have one in your home.

And yes, a woman having to share a hotel room with a man she barely knows, is incredibly inappropriate and also extremely unsafe."

ballpython,ffqlx9w,t3_eubc0y,1580138118.0,rule of thumb is it should be about as wide as the girth of his body! technically i doubt he'd have any problems getting it down but he's still very tiny so i'd try one size down first :)

instantkarma,ffc0c5l,t1_ffc08bo,1579788267.0,"YOU'RE implying that. YOU said the parents not intervening was ok so the kid could learn a lesson. Which is saying ""Let kids kick cats to learn a lesson"". It's all on you, bud."

instantkarma,ffbk0eb,t1_ffaq4y8,1579768954.0,"Sure kids have to learn. But there is literally no need for an innocent animal to have to get hurt for that, and it also wouldn't need to if the parents were decent."

TrueOffMyChest,ff963ac,t3_es5vqz,1579705717.0,"I'm a digital portrait artist. One time, I had a funny exchange in my instagram dms with someone asking me to draw them (for free). Their selling point was ""I am Brazilian"" ""You can do the drawing."". I posted it to my twitter and submitted it to a twitter page called ""for exposure"" which unbeknownst to me is basically the twitter version of r/ChoosingBeggars. A year or so later, I started using reddit, found the fitting subreddit and decided to post my screenshots there. Got called a reposter by 3 different people. For posting my own original content.

Tinder,ff65owl,t1_ff64zzf,1579619748.0,"I personally think a joke in the beginning is fun and you can usually transition into a regular conversation pretty easily off of them. And it's not like he just threw her a random pickup line with a self deprecating punchline – she asked a question, he answered in a humorous way and threw in a second joke after, and while sure it's a little self deprecating it's not the kind that's super awkward to respond to. This was literally only the first 3 messages so that doesn't really indicate how much he wants to get to know her or not tbh."
Tinder,ff62z70,t1_ff618dg,1579617830.0,"she could just go with it and go ""oh I tihnk i already have one in mind!"" or just switch to asking a question and starting a different conversation. we can direct conversations too!"
