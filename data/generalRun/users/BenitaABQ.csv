DidntKnowIWantedThat,ff5ol6f,t3_eprtdo,1579603436.0,I got on a flight that flew low enough that I could see the towns and villages. It was so beautiful! I grew up in the desert so seeing all that greenery was stunning.
bulletjournal,ff5oa7x,t3_erewty,1579602979.0,I really love whole drawing and I usually don't like anatomically accurate hearts.
bulletjournal,ff4qcqp,t3_erewty,1579569905.0,So cool with the sprout growing through the crack in the jar! Great idea and not creepy.
Damnthatsinteresting,fewa4ul,t3_eqeqx9,1579407417.0,Beautiful!
Damnthatsinteresting,fem86rd,t3_ephw2o,1579243271.0,How about one with refrigeration for here in the desert summer?
DidntKnowIWantedThat,fem82wr,t3_eprtdo,1579243155.0,But do they have good wifi?
bulletjournal,fem5o5j,t3_epj1q0,1579240637.0,Cute execution of a good idea!

HumansBeingBros,fcp3l9g,t3_eiavlp,1577849414.0,"I also have social anxiety so I used to tell my friend what I thought in our philosophy class. She would relay it to the professor. After a couple of months, he asked me to say it myself. I'd had time to get used to the class so it wasn't too terrible speaking up in class by then."
MadeMeSmile,fcp2qnu,t3_ei79jq,1577848674.0,"I believe having the vet help them pass away is our final kindness for them. When they are sick or in pain without hope of getting better, it is a gift we give them to thank them for loving us. It is so hard..."
bulletjournal,fcimtg7,t3_eh7uvy,1577665196.0,"I can draw, but I prefer using stencils in my bujo because I can get the consistent results. Yours are nice and sturdy, too. It is really hard to price your own work so I understand that concern...

That being said, please sell them! I think most of us would be thrilled to buy them from you!!"
bulletjournal,fbiei6h,t3_eddhry,1576898696.0,Beautiful work - your rows and columns are so even! Very elegant!
