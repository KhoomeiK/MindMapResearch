crashbandicoot,ff5l9r3,t1_ff4w9sk,1579598372.0,"I thought that Uka-Uka, Loco-Loco and Ahi-Ahi could be evil masks that Want to destroy Planet earth and many others to free a Powerful Planet sized Mask called Heva-Heva, Who was trappened by the Ancients because of his greed to obtain more Power. Each Planet has within It a part of Heva-Heva. Pretty much Loco-Loco has the power of madness allowing It to make whoever wears It super fast but less in control of his actions
Ahi-Ahi being a Mask made of four masks all with their own thoughts, is unwearable as It finds itself above of being whorn, while Ahi-Ahi and Loco-Loco have detroyed their planets, Uka-Uka Is still Stuck because of Cortex's continous failure

Let's start with your idea of liberation from death, do you know what will happen after it? the most probable option is complete decomposition of what you are, after death there is no you, it is difficult to understand it due to the fact that our conscience makes us believe that we are superior to that thing but after death we do not exist, there is no no peace after death because to have peace you need to exist in some way, but after death you will no longer exist.
