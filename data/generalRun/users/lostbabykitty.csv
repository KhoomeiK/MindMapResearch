SuicideWatch,fewoase,t1_fewfvjp,1579416907.0,"thank you <3 

aw man, i know the not wanting to tell people. i think they would rather know though than not. I’m glad you’re talking about it here, anyhow. sometimes i dont wanna tell ppl bc i love them and when i give less shits about myself i don’t feel like it’s worth telling them, or i worry it will worry them pointlessly, or sometimes feel bad about it anyhow and not want to have those talks. we can’t control people’s emotions or reactions tho. its okay to ask for help or just let someone know. i find it helps to not feel alone with my knowledge. 

it’s scary for sure. most unknown things are scary, but that doesn’t mean they’ll turn out bad. even if it’s freaky in this moment, theres a much better chance of sometime good happening when you share what’s getting heavy with you. a lot of people do give a shit and are okay to lend a hand. 

sending you best wishes 

i have a wicked dehydration headache rn lol
remember to drink some water too, if u will"

my parents called me a demon when i got outed as trans, and told me if they ever had a gay son, they just wouldn’t have a son

i did a bunch of shit when i was 16-18 too, k and m mostly tho. i think i kinda get u on the dying and living thing. i want to die but if things were better i wouldnt mind being alive. 

i left home and lived with a bunch of queer and trans friends <3 created my family 

it was really hard to keep trying meds and seeing my doc while i was using a bunch of other chemicals. it took a few years and different drugs to find the right prescription for me. it doesn’t fix shit, but i’m able to function more and find stable moments more often. 

life will always get worse. it’s gotten better some days too, then worse again. then better again. when i’m depressed its easy to feel life mixing together into a pool of dark times with no happy moments. 

i’m kinda rambling without aim here. i know the feeling of wanting to die while know people have it worse. 
that will always be the case though. 
you’ll be better off than some and worse off than others. 
doesn’t make your pain or your moments of feeling okay any less of what they are to you. 

i hope you hang on."
SuicideWatch,few808b,t3_eqjvmi,1579406682.0,"yo same here, i remember being a child (maybe 6) in the backseat with my mom driving down a hill and I was wishing I were dead and contemplating how I wouldn’t be able to eat ice cream anymore... :p its a little light hearted but depression has been with me for so long, and my earliest memories include pretty stark anxiety, particularly physical symptoms of chest pain and unending guilt particularly around 8 

it’s interesting to know other people have also felt so awful from a young age
