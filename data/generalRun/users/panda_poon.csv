Sadly a lot of nazi artifacts were simply destroyed out of hatred.  Uniforms, metals, flags, books etc.  what’s left is now pretty valuable just from a historical standpoint.  Sure there are those who collect it for other reasons as well.  Sadly when you show these kinds of items I think a lot of people would automatically assume you 100% support what the nazi agenda.  But the sad truth is there are some are people that just want to hold onto something that has historical significance.  

I’ll give you a real life example my father was to inherit some weapons that could be traced back to my ancestors in the Wild West.  A pistol and a rifle, originals not the cheap replicas that are flooded in the markets now.  When his father passed another male relative raided his place and took those originals and pawned them off, because of a dispute between the father and that relative. He wanted to hurt his father that was already dead, by pawning off a heirloom that was to be kept in the family."

MadeMeSmile,ffd9ziw,t3_ess27a,1579816349.0,"My mom had major surgery to remove a major organ that had developed a massive tumor she had. She used to get it treated but unfortunately it started to spread; so she would rather give up a pound of flesh than have a chance of keeping the organ and her life.  The surgery was 12-14 hours long and her recovery was just as long it took a total of a month in the ICU before she could be released back home due to complications.  She floored the nurses and the doctor when she was able to walk on her own after 4 days of her surgery.  They wanted her to get back on her feet to speed up the recovery but didn’t think she’d be up that quick.  During her recovery her hair started to fall out,  not because of kemo but because of the extreme stress on the body from both the recovery and from the surgery. She decided to get all her hair cut off rather than deal with it constantly falling out.  It’s starting to fully grow back now."

When a loved one is going through a hard time like she is it’s best to watch your steps, just give her lots of love and support, and if she’s getting a little better making some jokes/fooling around can help to ease the tension and alleviate some stress that’s on the mind.  

When your grieving things don’t look and feel the same as they do someone who isn’t.  It’s almost like looking out from a deep hole you’ve dug yourself in and you don’t know how to get out, each person varies when they grieve. There are a number of stages you go through, in accepting the grief.  There are some who need time, or those who need help to get out.
