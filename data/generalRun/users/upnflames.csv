It’s easier to just make business incur that cost like they do for so many other things rather then try to solve every other instance of why a person might want to use cash over credit."
newyorkcity,ffelm9o,t1_ffek4uq,1579853282.0,"I mean, it’s fine that you expect to live outside the norm and are okay with the restrictions that the lifestyle entails, but most people benefit greatly from having good credit. Telling someone to just not worry about it is a bit fucked up. Bad credit can bar you from certain types of jobs, cause you to spends thousands of dollars more on common types of loans and limit you housing options. Yeah, if you expect to live on a farm that you built with your bare hands from money you saved over a couple decades and you expect to just ride a bike everywhere, then who gives a shit about credit. But if you want a job and a house and a car in a suburb like 90% of people in America then you should at least think about maintaining you credit. Again, it’s great if it’s not important to you, but it should matter to most people."
newyorkcity,ffelbz5,t1_ffei9hk,1579852903.0,"Sure. It also leads to a lot of people spending a lot more then they would otherwise though and businesses know it. People are a lot more likely to pay $15 for a salad on a credit card then if they had to pull a twenty dollar bill out of their pocket.

technology,ffc6s50,t1_ffc5ufg,1579792854.0,"That’s simply not true. Last time Bezos divested a significant portion of his stock it coincided with a 10% decline of Amazons valuation over the next 30 days. Of course, it’s impossible to know what extenuating factors also played a role in that decline, but to say it had no effect is not only wrong, it shows little understanding of a well studied market effect."
technology,ffc2qqz,t1_ffbycg8,1579790081.0,"You are not quite understanding stock valuation. His stock is only worth $180B if someone is willing to pay that much.  A small part of the reason it even is that high is because one person owns so much of it. If Jeff Bezo’s starts selling his stock, the value of that stock would go down. Making each additional stock that he sells worth less. 

Daily market volume is just one way to to measure the resiliency of a stock price. Just because $200M worth of Amazon stock changes hands in a day without a rapid devaluation doesn’t mean it wouldn’t crash if one person tried to do it in a short period of time (say, a year). It takes *decades* for these billionaires to sell their positions in companies in a market healthy way - that is, if you want to meet supply and demand curves. 

So the question is not if we want to tax rich people more or not - that’s obvious. The question is whether a *wealth* tax is a) sustainable, and b) more beneficial to the middle class then say, a VAT or closing the carried gains loophole. *Most* models suggest that it isn’t. The government will get a bunch of money up front at the expense of future revenues and the potential decline to the market will hurt the average person much more then the average billionaire."
technology,ffc1d4n,t1_ffbvhai,1579789054.0,Sure. But how and how much are equally important questions. Certain methods of taxation hurt regular people and the economy more then the revenue they generate. There’s a reason most countries don’t have a wealth tax. There are just better ways to tax the wealthy but they don’t sound as good on the campaign trail.

personalfinance,fem30b3,t1_felw885,1579238068.0,"Again, it goes back to what the employee is authorized to discuss within the scope of their employment. A cashier may be authorized to explain the return policy to you as a customer and if they screw it up, the company will eat it. But the SEC is not going to fine a company because a cashier tweeted the wrong earnings  figures at Bloomberg. But if the CFO makes the same tweet, well, the difference is obvious. In this situation, a professor is as authorized to discuss tuition with a student as a cashier is to discuss a supplier contract.

This is an important professional lesson too. Always confirm that the person you’re dealing with is allowed to follow through on what they’re telling you. I’ve seen a lot of deals go to shit because one of the parties was negotiating without any authority to finalize a decision. Our poor rock supplier who shows up with a dump truck just to find out the cashier doesn’t have access to the corporate checkbook. Happens more often then you think."
personalfinance,felu4u3,t1_feltdxm,1579230993.0,"Good thing there are contracts and laws specifically dictating what companies are and aren’t responsible for.

An employee telling someone company policy is within the scope of their employment. An employee telling someone something that is clearly **not** company policy is **not** within the scope of their employment. Again, reread the article you linked. It’s pretty clear but if you’re not seeing it, I don’t think I can help you."
personalfinance,felrusl,t1_felqoxf,1579229391.0,"Did you read that entire article? It’s written a little silly, but scroll down to where it compares the difference between a “detour” and a “frolic” (I’ve never heard them called that, but whatever). 

It comes down to whether the employee should have reasonably known whether their action was within their employment duties. A professor providing tuition guidance to a student would be considered a “frolic” (assuming the university had attorneys review their employment contracts).  The professor should have had exact wording in their contracts that say they do not have authority to talk money with students. Policy should be readily available to students stating that financial officers are the only ones authorized to talk to them about money. Assuming the school has its ducks in a row, they’ll easily be able to argue that the professor was operating far outside of their employment responsibilities. 

Just use common sense on this one. Imagine what a mess the world would be if companies had to honor everything their employees said.

Edit: this is the pertinent paragraph in the article you linked:

>	Employers are vicariously liable under the doctrine of “respondeat superior” for the negligent acts or omissions by their employees in the course of employment. The key phrase is “in the course of employment”. For an act to be considered within the course of employment, it must either be authorized by the employer or be so closely related to an authorized act that an employer should be held responsible."

personalfinance,felo7zy,t1_fekuclt,1579226900.0,"In short, being vaguely “representative” means nothing. You need to have legal authority to manage a companies finances especially. If you don’t have that authority, you are acting outside of your employment and are personally liable for damages. A cashier might “represent” Walmart but they can’t sign supplier contracts on Walmart’s behalf. OP has recourse, but it’s against the professor personally, not the school."
personalfinance,felnojk,t1_feku2f1,1579226530.0,"Nah, any suit against the school would get dismissed immediately. OP could sue the professor but who wants to do that. 

When you are hired, your title actually means something. Within the org sheets, it will say which employees are authorized to do what. If they act outside of those authorizations, they are personally liable. This is what keeps a cashier at Walmart from signing a new supplier agreement and the bank teller from authorizing personal loans out of the till. It is also why everyone has “manager” in their title now. At most organizations, only managers can do things like sign contracts and direct third parties.

Back to OP’s situation, professors are probably not authorized to give financial instruction and they should know that. If OP pushed, the school would just say that the professor was acting outside of his  employment as a professor and is personally liable for any damages that happened to OP as a result. Now if it were a financial aid officer or bursars employee, different story. The school might still help OP to save face, but I can guarantee that professor won’t ever talk tuition with a student again."

There’s a reason why the number one thing people vote on is the short term economy. It sucks, but you’re fighting a steep uphill battle if your plan is to get people to vote on the future when they need to pay bills today.

No, eating ""dead animals"" is a cultural norm throughout the western world. If is makes her that uncomfortable, the appropriate response would be for her to leave. It's his home as much as hers and he has a right to eat his food in peace there. You may not like the fact that it is normal, but that doesn't mean it is not so.

>Is it not also disrespectful to the animals that our dietary choices fund their mistreatment if not torture, just for the sake of our culinary pleasure?

No. They are animals. It is normal to eat them. Yes, factory farming is cruel and some may choose to source their meat from more ethical places, but it is not for us to judge every aspect of another's life, especially if they are partaking in normal, legal activity.

>Is it not disrespectful to our planet that while the animal agriculture industry remains the number one contributer to CO2 emissions, we ignore it because it's ""too hard"" or ""vegetarians and vegans are rude to people""?

There is no doubt that factory farming in harmful to the environment. So is fast fashion, global travel, the disposable nature of electronics, having kids or owning pets, among a thousand other things. Most people in the western world have no platform to speak from, vegetarian or not. If we want to help the environment, we need to do it at the macro level, addressing the largest issues from an industrial level. The fairest way to do this is by imposing reasonable regulation and environmental taxes. Otherwise, it becomes too easy target one specific behavior and lose sight of the goal. The guy who eats locally sourced meat twice a week but is otherwise eco-conscious is going to be more environmentally friendly than the vegetarian with three dogs who replaces their iPhone once a year. They shouldn't be held to different standards.

The issue is when individuals try to claim moral superiority at the expense of others acting reasonably within society. When they weigh their own moralistic ideology as more important than others. ""Moral obligation"" in itself is an extremely slippery slope. Obviously, not all vegetarians act this way, but many do. There is a difference between simple education and outreach and public shaming/admonishment. It is the latter that I take issue with when it comes to culinary norms.

I just don’t want to toss more money in to see it go to wars I don’t support and departments that can’t do the job they have and initiatives that just haven’t worked the way they were supposed to in theory.

It’s like the system slowly chips away at the things you think are possible and a lot of what you had assigned to malice, you come to realize is just incompetence. I started working for a company that handles government contracts and I saw (and still see) *hundreds* of thousands of dollars wasted, not by greed, but by laziness. I know for a fact know that our government, left or right, will let people die, not because of policy, but bureaucracy. I started a small business and had to deal with my department of state losing my permits three times, delaying me six months. Not, not approving. The permits were approved - they literally just kept losing them and having to reissue them. If it wasn’t a side hustle, I would have went bankrupt. 

Now I’m thinking about buying a house and I look at what my total tax load would be and I can’t stop but to think, for what? We’ve got broken police departments, broken infrastructure, no public transit or health system, a mental health crisis, among a million other things *but just a little bit more* and everything will get better. Promise. 

For me personally, I have no issue paying a little more if it meant that all of these programs would get launched and work. But I have absolutely zero confidence that they would work and pumping more money into a system that is just complete garbage seems useless. Show me something that works even a little bit better with the money you have now, and I’ll think about wanting to give more. Till then, absolutely not, if I can help it."

No *reputable* organization is going to keep that person. And if you’ve got a low level corporate job, you’re gonna get canned for that too - it’s an auto termination policy at most places.

Big companies are trying much harder to eliminate bias these days and they’re much better for it. That’s not to say that a lot of companies haven’t updated their hiring practices. I’m sure your company is taking steps to account for the results of the study and I’m sure other companies are taking similar actions.

The hiring panel doesn’t even get to see the resumes until the day of the interview - I think it’s to help prevent implicit bias and all that.

I wasn’t trying to be mean or anything, it’s just a dangerous myth that goldens are completely harmless and people really shouldn’t be surprised that they can display aggressive tendencies just like any other dog. 

I might also be a little biased because I used to have a neighbor who’s kid needed plastic surgery because no one felt the need to watch him around a another neighbors Golden “because goldens are naturally sweet” or some thought along those lines.

Never make the crate a punishment. Dogs naturally love their crate as it’s the closest they’ll come to a den, but if you use it for a time out or yell at them when you put them in it, they only associate it with bad things. Not saying you *cant* use it that way as an owner, but if you do, then you can’t really expect them to want to go in there willingly. You have to pick one, crate for punishment or a well crate trained pup. You can’t really have both. 

For resource guarding, play the “make a choice game”. When your dog has something, offer something better. Maybe it’s a snack for a chew toy, maybe it’s a few minutes of tug with another toy. Maybe it’s a short walk. But the idea is to give the dog the option to voluntarily let go of what it has in favor of what you have. Once he’s occupied with the new thing, remove the old thing from the equation. Eventually, the reward can be toned down until the dog realizes that nothing bad will happen if it doesn’t have its bone, stick, toy or whatever.

But in my book, letting the kid have a great NYE celebration, while still going to bed at a healthy time for a six year old, and letting her sleep instead of being present at a party for adults is the **far** better option.

If you’re a start up or some other company that needs good people but can’t afford to have high dollar employees who don’t produce, this model just makes a lot of sense. My gf is a manager at a large tech company and she’s got an engineer tying up $120k of her budgeted payroll - she’s been trying to fire him for about a year now. Guy is great at his job, but turns out he’s sexist and has an issue taking direction from female managers. Basically, if a woman gives him an assignment he doesn’t like, he just doesn’t do it. If the issue gets pushed, he’ll jump to a more senior male manager and wait till that person tells him what to do. He’s also “professionally” aggressive (if that makes sense), and just an asshole to women in general. Took a few months to really confirm this trend and *everyone* wants him gone, but HR has forced multiple reviews and PIP plans and the company has even paid for him to have some kind of work place training related to the matter. Asshole should have been fired months ago, but  HR won’t let them for some reason I don’t quite understand. Had he been a contractor for six months first, this wouldn’t be an issue and my gf would be able to hire someone who actually deserves the job. 

As far as the difference in comp, it’s not quite as nefarious as you might think. When my cousin signed his contract, we were able to see the rate the company was paying the agency and it was about $60k a year. Which is pretty competitive for an entry level logistics engineer. It’s just that the agency took their cut and decided to pay him $45k. As soon as he got hired by the company, he would have jumped to $60k automatically even if he had done the same exact thing, but they bumped him to the next level anyway. Again, I don’t think it was greed - it’s a start up and they just really aren’t equipped to have a situation like what my gf is going through at her company and don’t want to risk it."

You’re right, that low level contract position will always be a low level contract position, but if they keep the contractor, it’s because they want them to do a more valuable job.  Honestly, from my experience, these seem to be some of the higher paying jobs you can get so it’s unwise to completely ignore that route, especially if you’re in technology or engineering. My cousin went from making $45k a year to $75k a year after completing his six month contract term. Like anything else though, you gotta be smart and really evaluate the company."
