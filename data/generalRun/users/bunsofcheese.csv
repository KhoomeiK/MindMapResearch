that doesn't mean she doesn't go out and do some herself.  of course she drove herself to the hospital while having a heart attack, so she's kind of hard core.

ADHD,fel5bby,t1_fek31rq,1579214379.0,"One of the things that I keep being reminded of is that just before I think something upsets other people or makes them angry with me, it usually doesn't, and it's just me over thinking. I realize that probably sounds a bit trite, but most of the time, for me at least, that worrying is all in my head. Don't be scared, she won't shoot you down, if she's good at what age does she will work with you to help you find balance and happiness."
reactiongifs,fekthl2,t1_fekkigl,1579207268.0,"Actually I did work in an office when the person in the cubicle across from me had chronic farting syndrome (not the technical term). It was constant, to the point where I brought a fan on that blew everything back at him. I asked my manager is there was a way we handled things like this, and she said ""yes: we don't"".

Best/worst part about assuring across from fart man? I have the sense of humor of a pre-teen boy, so I thought it was hilarious, but tempered only by the possible threat of stench."
reactiongifs,fekhh1o,t3_epjgj3,1579200132.0,"I remember saying something in one of those anonymous surveys and instantly regretting a very harsh comment I made about my boss - being his only underling, he'd know it was me. I messaged the company who handled the survey and asked if I could change it and the guy was like ""no problem, done"".  

Anonymous my ass."
ADHD,fekck4h,t1_fek9bni,1579197210.0,"these are all really helpful points - thank you.  What's interesting is that in job interviews I usually say ""I work better with a defined time frame"" to get projects done - vague times ""sometime this week"" don't work for me because I'll put everything off until the end of the week and do everything in a mad, confused rush.

I've started trying to adopt the ""if you can do it now, don't do it later, do it *now*"" mentality when it comes to simple things - dishes, laundry, making the bed, clearing up after cooking, and if i can keep it up I'll consider it a major win.

I picked up a book ""Zen and the Art of Happiness"" and I remembered this part early on in it that basically says ""whatever happens to you is the best thing that could happen to you""  - even the worst death in the family, terrible disease, stranded by your beltloops 100 stories up in the air, anything and everything is the best thing, not ""it could be worse"" or ""every cloud has a silver lining"", the ""best""...it's a hard concept to wrap my head around, but it's another thing I'm working on - whatever happens is what was supposed to happen, and it's a good thing.

i'm definitely looking forward to meeting with the psychiatrist next month.

thank you again."

CBD,feh4q66,t1_fegvcll,1579109103.0,"Fair enough; I only know a small part of your situation. CBD can't hurt certainly, but I take SSRIs, and - in my case - CBD actually reduces the affects of my medication, which in turn increases my depression.  I hope you find a solution that helps."

It's like when people say I only want a woman as a roommate and some guy decides to fight them, what kind of person with force themselves on someone else? So I guess I kind of take it back."

Check with the tenant board. I remember reading somewhere that it didn't matter if you're on the lease as long as you had proof of residency: you had mail in your name at that address, furniture there that was yours and so on. It won't keep you from being evicted but it should make it difficult, and if your friend wants to completely destroy your friendship, well, make them work for it. 

Or you could put your name on a list for your own rent-controlled unit and tell them you'll move out when another opens up."
