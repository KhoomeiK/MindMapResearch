2007scape,ffgj6zz,t1_fffyo9i,1579907466.0,its almost as if getting better and putting more hours into the game has these perks and benefits that would be meaningless if everyone had access to them...
BattlefieldV,fffx2vj,t1_fffbjg7,1579893694.0,"i would do better without it. In battlefield 5 you're almost never aiming at just 1 person so no matter what your aim gets dragged by every single movement of everyone in front of, beside and behind them. I would 10/10 do better without it enabled even if others were using it.

the only game play it rewards is running and gunning with an a smg cause you can smoothly point and squeeze without worrying about aim - and that's just not how i like to play in general"

BattlefieldV,ffd3q2h,t1_ffd2ykg,1579812824.0,as for what you said about mosquitoes and the bombers on other maps - all that needs to be done is 1 person has to load out in a fighter plane and immediately nobody on the other team can use a bomber effectively. The fact that there are only 2 plane spawns makes it so teaming up on planes isn't common - 1 fighter can take out a bomber and potentially outmaneuver another fighter and take them out. Add 1 more plane spawn and it's basically impossible to take out another plane if 1 or more person is working together. even on these maps 2 fighter pilots working together completely shuts down enemy airforce
BattlefieldV,ffd2psr,t1_ffd2grj,1579812248.0,Every single clip and video of people complaining about OP planes is a pacific tank getting bombed by a zero or corsair. there is at least half a dozen posts like that on this subreddit from just the last 7 days.

We used to serve farm to table breaded wings and there was often a little bit of pinkish tinge against the bone - totally normal - totally 100% cooked.Every night we would get at least one person who sent them back raw - the manager instead of correcting the dumb customer would apologize for serving them raw chicken (THE BIGGEST INSULT TO A COOK IMAGINABLE) - throw out the perfectly good food and then serve them a free replacement that has the exact same ""problem"".

For steak you could cook them the perfect medium rare steak and have it sent back because it's basically raw - instead of teaching the customer about the rarity of steaks the management apologizes for the cooks mistake (another huge insult) and insist that we cook them a medium/medium well steak and TELL them it's medium rare because that's what they wanted.

BattlefieldV,ffcsnb0,t1_ffc3clk,1579806441.0,"i've always noticed that the map layouts where the croc can be called in as a reinforcement just don't work in it's favor like it often does for the sturmtiger.

It's so low to the ground and doesn't have nearly as good visibility - i've never found a defensive/offensive position for it that didn't result in me having to drive ontop of the objective or deep into enemy territory essentially getting killed before making any sort of difference.

The Sturmtiger on the other hand I can think of a bunch of maps where it absolutely dominates because you can lob shots across a large part of the map and get multiple kills from the explosion including instant heavy/light tank kills.

Twisted Steel, Rotterdam and Arras are examples where just the terrain gives the Sturmtiger huuuuge advantage over the Croc."
BattlefieldV,ffcrrz0,t1_ffc9gxw,1579805923.0,the idea of the flamethrower works more than it actually does imo. if you have someone using the flamethrower now you can't see shit as the driver and your already incredibly slow and vulnerable vehicle can get rocketed and dynamited from just outside your vision because all you see is harmless red/orange flames.

Planes should be disabled or at the very least they should allow you to fly above the storm at a certain height, it seems to be easiest to see in a plane when you are as close to the ground as possible but that doesn't really make sense. (not ground visibility - front view visibility)

the Sandstorm should hit in the middle of the match and die down before the end of the match IMO - or at the very least tone it down to be as visible as fjell is during constant snowfall - they didn't make it a blizzard the whole match and it's a lot more playable"

\- you don't hear someone charging at you because of audio glitches

\-animation cancels incoming damage/forces you to stop shooting even when you'd have gotten the kill

BattlefieldV,ff4idn7,t3_ererky,1579564340.0,"All they need to do is remove/tweak Hamada and automatically grand operations becomes 100x more playable. 

You have Airborne where the explosives can easily get camped by the defending team, have massive terrain advantage, visibility advantage (seeing exactly where people land so they get killed instantly by 2 squads at once). 

2nd round conquest assault?? There is a hundred different ways to use that map if you had a brain and conquest assault is the most anti-climactic way to use it. 10-15 minutes in the luster of Grand ops is lost and all you're playing is conquest for an additional 20-30 minutes. 

I actually don't mind Aerodrome breakthrough to top it off, it's a faster pace than conquest and feels like a final assault. The only problem is that after the first sector falls the other sectors fall like a house of cards."

BattlefieldV,fekoxm7,t3_epjsn0,1579204578.0,"The way i see it, it was an intended change. Easier to swap out the ammo station with a med station than to remove the fortification from the map.

ammo crates were too abundant/frequently available and explosives/flares were being abused. So they increased the delay to refill and swapped a few ammo stations out for med stations. People camping ammo stations are just like people camping out of bounds - they are ""abusing"" the mechanics to create an advantage for their team - the fairness of which is debatable.

I have been very happy with the increased delay to refill ammo and the less frequent ammo stations. before they changed it, you could basically refill your gadgets by the time you finished lobbing your last mortar or firing your last flare. Now there is a solid 30+ seconds extra you would have to stand by the ammo station to refill - encouraging players to get back into the game.

The only part I don't like is that everyone loads out with so much ammo that the support role is essentially dead."

The planes are only an issue if nobody commits to using AA to protect the objective, it's incredible strong compared to the AA on other maps.
