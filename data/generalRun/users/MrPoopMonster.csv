In the case we're talking about we have the police officers being able to see the children from outside and no allegations of violence, so like I said unless their appearance was such that it would make someone think that they need immediate medical attention, then I don't see how they can enter the premises.

It also helps this lady's case that the children were never taken to the hospital afterwards, and only given to child protective services.

If these are indeed the allegations, I don't see how it would be reasonable to enter without consent or a warrant to render aid to children that they can see before entering. This is a far cry away from police seeing actual violence and entering to stop it and render aid.

In  these rulings probable cause must exist for a search to begin with before the reasonableness can be used as exigent circumstances, or probable cause of imminent danger or destruction of evidence can be exigent circumstances when probable cause for the search does not exist already. Either way, reasonable suspicion of something alone can never rise to be exigent circumstance. 

I still feel that this lady has an ""air tight"" case if she want to pursue a lawsuit. The police officers could see the children, they were presented right from the other side of the window/door. So unless their appearance was such that it lead them to believe that most likely they're being abused or need medical aid, then they can't force entry into the house.

And if that's the case they're going to make, then they're 100% wrong.

Edit: Also I was under the impression that to create exigency danger must be imminent, otherwise a warrant must be applied for, because with technology of today getting a warrant doesn't take more than 15 minutes. In order to bypass the protections of the 4th Amendment, the the circumstances must be such that getting a warrant would take too long to prevent serious harm or destruction of evidence, or whatever.

The neighbor also alleged that the problem was people were coming over and doing drugs, which is nothing more than hearsay unless the police have some evidence to support such a claim, i'.e it doesn't rise to exigent circumstances anywhere in any state or district.  Beyond that the DA hasn't said anything about exigent circumstances and has only said the community caretaking statute allows them entry in tho the house, which it doesn't.

Another thing if there was truly exigency then the police officers wouldn't have waited around for 10 minutes. Also, them seeing the children through the window probably satisfy that they're not in danger.

The facts are parallel enough, they can come and investigate allegations of crimes under the community caretaking duties of police, but they may not search a private residence without a warrant, consent, or exigent circumstances. When they were told to leave their only option was to get a warrant, or get consent, nothing it that situation is probable cause that anyone is in imminent danger.

Firing grenades into windows isn't even searching, in any way at all. That'd be like me giving cops consent to search my vehicle and then they proceed to slash my tires. Some of these judges are so willfully ignorant. But that's what you can expect when the government appoints the judges that decide if the government broke the law, instead of them being elected.

Also consent can be withdrawn at any moment. Your telling me the homeowner who handed over the keys didn't object to them firing grenades into their house instead?"

news,fdrin7p,t1_fdr6y0t,1578685101.0,">  People can be detained for all sorts of reasons

All sorts of reasons being *only* when police can articulate objective facts that would lead a reasonable officer to believe a crime has occurred, is occurring, or is about to occur. Which is a higher bar than you might think, based on what you're saying. 

An anonymous tip could come in that someone has a concealed gun at a bus stop and describe what that person is wearing. In that situation the police do not have the lawful authority to detain that person ""to figure out what's going on"" as you put it. They don't have the authority to pat that suspect down for weapons or demand their identity, unless they were to observe something else that would lead them to suspect a crime is afoot."
nfl,fdpocyt,t1_fdjf4e2,1578634539.0,"I dunno why you're being downvoted, because I think you're right. I only looked at rushing yards for my numbers on both sides. Except for Henrys yards after contact, I just looked up that stat. 

 Anyway, as non Titans fans, where do you think Henry will end up? The Titans might be scared to franchise tag him for so much after cj2k. But, could you imagine if Seattle throws so much money at him he can't refuse, to replace carson? Russ could end with more rings than Brady."

nfl,fdjeut4,t1_fdjehir,1578467852.0,I wasn't trying to make Fournette look bad. That's just how effective Henry has been at rushing after contact this season.
nfl,fdjesdc,t1_fdj31gk,1578467775.0,"This is a fun argument, first of all. 

But, I could see Mariota having success on another team. Specifically, the Panthers. I think his mobility could enable CMC a little more than Kyle Allen. Maybe they always played Dion Lewis so much because Mariota needed a safety throw becuase he wasn't confident throwing the ball down the field."
Showerthoughts,fdj7jyk,t1_fdhv6i7,1578460680.0,No one would ever do such a thing. Just like no one ever copied VHS tapes from Blockbuster so they could have cool movies like Independence Day for just the price of a rental and blank VHS.
nfl,fdj6da0,t1_fdhkmeo,1578459706.0,"You are right. He had 1268 yards after contact.

Here's some other interesting stats that are related:

\-82.3% of Derrick Henry's rushing yards this season were after contact

\-he had on average 4.18 yards after contact this season

\-He didn't play all 16 games and was rested week 16

\-Leonard fournette had 4.35 yac with 1152 total yards, So Henry after contact this season was essentially equally as good as Fournette was in total."
nfl,fdj4unq,t1_fdh9vv3,1578458490.0,"I think the Titans defense is a lot better than people give them credit for. And they didn't get to pad their defensive stats on the season against a division as weak as the Browns, Bengals, and Steelers. 

Also the Titans redzone offense is literally the best in the league since since Tannehill took over. So it's hard to stop them from scoring TDs. I could see Tennessee winning this game with 21 points or less."
nfl,fdj4chq,t1_fdhhyv2,1578458102.0,"I dunno. The Titans O line has been incredibly effective at making holes. So if they keep it up and Henry can get into the backfield,then I don't know how much time the Ravens will even have the ball. Beyond that, I think the Titans have a better defense than the Ravens, and their redzone offense is the best in the league. 

It's going to be a close game, and I think the Titans definitely have what it takes to beat the Ravens."
nfl,fdgaky6,t1_fdefi1a,1578387311.0,"I've had a weird feeling that he's the guy. You can give him a lot of money for 2 years, and you can try out some kind of new offense. The way they've used Hill all season seems suspiciously good this season. You have Kamara and Hill and Thomas and Cook., if Brees retries. Maybe they'll try to cook up some super weird stuff next season. 

I'd like to see it. Or Hill going to the Panthers."
