StarWars,ffbnmzz,t1_ffbmidi,1579774460.0,"I can't remember if there was a mention in Rebels or the Ahsoka novel but in the comics some of the Clones (not Rex) resisted the programming, like Kanan's Clone Commander. Iirc he resisted but still fell victim to Order 66.

However the opposite is also true. A fallen Jedi used a Jedi Mind Trick  on a squad of Purge Troopers (the last Clones in service to the Empire) to activate Order 66 which caused them to turn on the Inquisitors that were trying to kill him. So Jedi Mind Tricks do work on the programming, maybe that's how Ahsoka stops Rex.

But hey, I trust Dave knows what he's doing and Seventh is still one of my favorite Inquisitors next to the Grand Inquisitor who is voiced by Jason Isaacs no less!

starwarsspeculation,fdbtw6u,t1_fdbmpu8,1578262040.0,"Being against war and being against the Jedi aren't the same thing, though they are related in regards to Barriss Offee.

And I do wish they'd confirmed it to be Barriss, but on the other hand, I have a theory that the reason they name themselves numerically is their standard operating procedure. Their identities are their weakness. Someone finds that out, that Inquisitor is screwed. It keeps them as an unknown factor to the galaxy, and ensures that new Inquisitors can always be recruited, i.e. the baby snatching.

I've also been wondering if those hooded blokes in TRoS were all those babies Palpatine was stealing.

Probs where Anakin will leave for in the middle episodes. They will want to capitalize on the relationship. Ahsoka is basically Anakin's other daughter anyway, and I don't think he would want to miss out on seeing her hand Maul his own ass on a silver platter.

Side note: Ahsoka always knew about Anakin and Padmé, just like Obi-Wan. Just my opinion."
StarWars,fdbngae,t1_fdbe1ku,1578259105.0,"All Lightsaber Forms have been Canonized pretty much in their entirety by Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need To Know, published in 2015. But just to be clear for my own head:

* Form I: Shii-Cho, Kit Fisto (more like Lit Fisto), basis for all forms. Good for multiple enemies in a pinch because of how basic it is. This is the one you mentioned.
* Form II: Makashi, Dooku, the duelist's form. Focuses on conservation of movement while maximising blade and footwork. Gives Soresu users a bit of trouble, i.e Obi-Wan vs Dooku.
* Form III: Soresu, Obi-Wan, the defence form, designed to wear opponents down and take advantage of counter attacks.
* Form IV: Ataru, Yoda, the source of Jedi flipping, enough said. Suffers from rapidly exhausting the user. Anakin and Ahsoka both make good use of acrobatics of the form in tandem with Shien. Ahsoka in particular.
* Form V: Shien/Djem So, Anakin, the switching from heavy attack to heavy defence. Anakin and Ahsoka both focus on Shien as they were also both trained in Soresu, the much better defence alternative.
* Form VI: Niman, Darth Maul, the ""synthesis"" form, takes aspects from all previous forms and better facilitates Force Power use (fuck off, Soresu is the best for that, just my opinion) but suffers from not maximising on the strengths of any Form.
* Form VII: Juyo/Vapaad, Mace Windu, forbidden to most Jedi because of its aggression and Vapaad variant was developed by Mace to help combat the risk of falling to the Dark Side. Not that it did him any good.
* Jar'kai: Asajj Ventress. The art of wielding two lightsabers. Quite a few Jedi and Sith have at least a very basic training in it. Obi-Wan, Anakin, Maul, Palpatine, Kit Fisto, Pong Krell (that dick with the two saberstaffs on Umbara) all have used it to great effect over their careers.

My personal favourites are Soresu and Ataru. What can I say? Yoda backflipping his way around Dooku was cool.

AdviceAnimals,fdamf2z,t1_fdahp40,1578247699.0,"Our global carbon budget has already been mostly used with at *most* 20 years left in it.

Thanks to overpopulation, we are burning more fossil fuels, farming more coal, persisting in the delusion that fracking is a good idea, and venting even more greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere in the last decade than in the last 100 years.

China's birthrate is dropping like a stone, and they are investing heavily in environmentally safe alternatives for energy production, shutting down multiple of their coal mines.

France has opened its arms to scientists and engineers who wish to work on green energy initiatives, and is now by and large one of the most environmentally friendly countries to live in.

The US to this day is the world's largest output of greenhouse gasses, and pulled out of the Paris Accords, global warming being the one thing the entire UN could agree on. This is despite each country setting their own goals and the whole thing being voluntary, with no money exchanging hands in order for it to work.

Australia is under an atmospheric ""hole"" that was not there a century ago and has suffered seemingly endless drought since then. The latest bushfires are a symptom of the situation.

Globally, multiple oil companies have leaked oil and toxic fumes from supertankers designed to facilitate the needs of an ever increasing populace for years, essentially turning the oceans into a deep fryer.
