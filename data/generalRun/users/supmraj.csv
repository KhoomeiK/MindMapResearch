IndianFood,ff9nngr,t1_ff8vimx,1579716784.0,"It adds a layer of deep smokiness that can be subtle or not, depends on quantity.  I do not have enough knowledge to say if it must roasted, I typically do.  Else I am smashing it with my fingers to a dust, into a dish."
IndianFood,ff8t3vi,t1_ff8djer,1579695072.0,"I am not aware of a biryani recipe in which it is a required spice, though it may exist because I have eaten bought biryani with the spice in it.  I roast and grind my own biryani masala.  It is such a mixture of fragrant spices that I add little kalpasi, probably 1 tsp in your example if meat is half kg.  

One south Indian chicken curry recpe I know uses 150 gm chicken and just 1/2 tsp kalpasi in the temper.   I modify recipes constantly and make them to my own likes and taste, but giving an example other than my own."

Interlude: I never wanted to go to college when my parents forced me, a long, long time ago.  I simply was not prepared at all.  My parents had no knowledge nor the capacity to seek out the knowledge.  But they wanted me to go to college, none the less.  College was an opportunity never afforded to them.  I was not so grateful in the moment.  It was hard and I was so clueless.  I had a very hard time working to support myself, even though only part-time, and going to school full time.  BUT - professionally, that degree has taken me places that I’ve never dreamed I would be.  And, all the jobs I’ve had since coming of working age, have benefited me greatly.  I am beyond grateful.  I wish I had done so much better in my undergrad so that I could now go for a masters, but my undergrad GPA is quite horrific.  LOL.  I did a certificate course in 2000 that assisted me at the time as I moved into a lucrative career way outside the box of my bachelors degree.  I have since left that career and would like to move to something new.  Still hoping I find a way.  Cheers to you !!!!!!!!!!"
