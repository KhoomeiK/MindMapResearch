dating_advice,fckwus8,t1_fckshvj,1577734913.0,"Hmm okay, because I have seen a lot of post removals in the past week, and they all seem to be done by you only. All the other mods have been doing this reasonably. 

About the second paragraph: what exactly is this? Is this a threat? Are the general users not allowed to have a discussion about the rules? What exactly would happen if I do not 'consider'? Your style of moderation seems to be quite immature and leaning towards a dictatorship. If this is going to be the future moderation style of this subreddit, consider that this kind of a management style usually ruins any communities or organizations. Not to mention that you only seem to be a ""baby mod"", yet still asserting yourself as the ultimate figure above anyone else. I would like to see a response from one of the actual moderators."
dating_advice,fckpav2,t1_fckkzeb,1577730264.0,"The mention of ""positive community"" in the rules only comes up in the context of banning hateful comments and has nothing to do with ranting or venting. Furthermore, I don't see any mention to those in the rest of the rules. So unless the moderators collectively decided on this, I don't see how you came up with such an interpretation of the rules."
dating_advice,fcjsb0y,t3_ehhvou,1577702162.0,"Maybe stop removing posts under the name of ""this is a positive community"" excuse? People that come here have problems and are frustrated. I don't understand how you expect everyone to be super positive. If people were so content with their dating lives, they wouldn't be here, right? A little more compassion and less coldness would feel everyone more welcome. Since you are a new mod, you don't seem to be aware of that and seem to be taking rather a cold and mechanic approach."
