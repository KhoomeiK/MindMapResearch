DDlgAdvice,ffisjhh,t1_ffiptj2,1579981634.0,"I’ve tried that but I’m always on mobile and sadly mobile doesn’t let you edit things like that, drives me nuts! Will have to go on my laptop sometime and figure it out. They’re in the ‘community info’ section but I need to find a way to add them to the rule tab when you try to make a new post"
popping,ffilsm4,t3_etpar9,1579976937.0,There’s something seriously wrong with you if you allow your animal to get this bad...
DDlgAdvice,ffiln7c,t3_etsy2a,1579976833.0,"As I commented to another poster earlier, you’re much better off asking him this question than asking a bunch of people who know nothing about you or him or your relationship. 

Communicate with your partner if you want a relationship to work. Asking others won’t get you anywhere"
DDlgAdvice,ffilgv0,t1_ffibap5,1579976710.0,"Trust me I feel the same way. And I often give very blunt responses like the one I gave in my previous comment! However, it’s hard to police posts like that, cuz *technically* they ARE asking advice. I get just as annoyed when people ask where to look for a daddy/little. Like READ OTHER POSTS CUZ ITS BEEN ASKED A MILLION TIMES!!!!

However, I’m already fairly strict when it comes to postings that aren’t related to advice and a few times people have accused me of power tripping (which I’m not obviously, just trying to fun a sub lol) when I’ve yelled at them over something, so I try to play nice lol. 

But you are right, it’s definitely annoying when people ask common sense questions. I might have to start thinking of a way to communicate a few new rules, but it’s hard to implement rules where it excludes certain advice posts without seeming like a douche unfortunately :(

Been thinking about making a new sticky post for new posters to read, with some guidelines on what is okay to post. Thoughts?"
