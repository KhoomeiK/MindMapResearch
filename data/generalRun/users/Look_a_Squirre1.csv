Maybe my perception is skewed since I live in an ideal suburb, but go to Tinder, the gym, grocery stores, coffee shops, literally anywhere, and you'll find ""normal"" guys. If the type you like isn't approaching you, perhaps you could take some of the other posters' advice and make the first move. Also, make sure you're presenting yourself in the best light possible. A cute, fit girl who looks like she's enjoying life is hard to resist. Sure, you'll probably still pique the crackheads' and unemployed guys' interest, but the wholesome ones will be more likely to approach too."
AskMen,ffctcvt,t1_ffbmjjw,1579806855.0,"Dude, this is awesome. My bro met his wife on Tinder, so anything is possible. Wishing you two the best."
AskWomen,ffcsdyo,t3_esuji1,1579806285.0,"It's a pleasure, lol. The person I recently dated was the Dungeon Master of his D&D group and honestly one of the best guys I've ever met; so charismatic and a fucking phenomenal communicator. I have two other buddies I know who are super laid back, genuine, and the nicest people ever. It's almost a green flag in my book when I hear someone games now, ha."
AskReddit,ff8bjql,t3_es29te,1579671931.0,Nah. I can be way too chill and stuck in my routine. Dating people who are a bit more ambitious and spontaneous balances me out.
AskMen,ff6hd16,t3_ervfmm,1579627226.0,I like listening to motivational talks from people who focus on continual growth. Currently I've been really into Jocko (Willink) Podcast.
dating,ff6g8ce,t3_ervkyd,1579626526.0,"Aw, internet hugs. I can tell you've really been affected by things that ""could have been"" over the past year. Just know that while dating can be really fucking hard, you putting yourself out there is nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, it takes a lot of courage and optimism to be vulnerable enough to let someone in. 

That insta-chemistry can be addictive, I know. Like you, over the past year, I've had a string of situationships that didn't work for one reason or another. It hurts to see a crush withdraw, but no matter the reason, you have to try your best not to internalize it and keep moving forward. You probably did share really beautiful experiences with this guy, and I'd bet money he felt the same bliss too. The hard reality is he's not ready to date, and the reason is irrelevant. He told you what's up, and you can kill yourself analyzing past interactions or gather your dignity and continue the search for someone who's emotionally ready to date you, because they are out there; you just haven't found them yet.

I'm sorry you're having a tough time, OP. Heartbreak is one of those visceral pains that can stay with us for a moment or a lifetime. By focusing on **YOU** (your strengths, hobbies, positive relationships that *aren't* romantic), I have faith that you'll come away from this hiatus confident that you have a shit ton to offer the world, regardless of your relationship status. If you don't have anyone to talk to, feel free to message me."

AskWomen,ff4m4te,t3_er1k4n,1579566944.0,"Not sure if this is weird, but my older bro. He's definitely had periods of being the stereotypical asshole sibling, but I know he always has my back.

We're similar as far as values, mannerisms, and senses of humor, but I've always referred to him as the better version of me, lol: extremely intelligent (cultured and street-smart), a well-rounded athlete, hilarious, talented (dude was busting out Rachmaninoff on the piano at like 13), a natural leader, and very mentally tough.

I value my bro because turning to him for guidance in my weaknesses/his strengths makes me a better, more fully developed person. Likewise, he's expressed that he values my soft skills and outlook on connecting with people."
AskReddit,fdg0ffw,t3_el4t4n,1578375541.0,I go out of my way to step on crunchy-looking leaves.

For example, if someone's trying to force their way into my lane while I'm driving, and my passenger starts getting agitated, I might say: ""Maybe they have somewhere important to be/they're from out of town."" Most times we don't know everyone's specific situation. I've found that liberally giving people the benefit of the doubt can soften those around me."

AskWomen,fcirh83,t3_ehcw5w,1577668075.0,"I couldn't help but peek at your post history. Merry belated Christmas, and I'm so sorry for your loss. :( Cats are one of the most incredible creatures, because they're so humanlike; they crave affection, need space, have their own little quirks, and bring endless joy and irritation, lol. There's no doubt in my mind your kitty loved you with their whole heart.

To answer your question, I cry, sulk a bit, and then try to do an activity that keeps my mind occupied (e.g. work out, call a friend, watch a funny show)."

AskWomen,fc77jhn,t3_eg7ubk,1577499626.0,"My dad died in September of 2009, so I was pretty broken by the beginning of 2010. I was away at college but couldn't focus for shit, so I actually got that semester forgiven since I failed most of my classes. I had just started dating my ""first love."" Was gradually coming out of my shell after being somewhat of a loner in high school.

It's nearly 2020, and I'm at a Starbucks posting on Reddit on a Friday night, lol. I turned down an offer to get drinks with a dude because I just got cheated on and am still feeling a little fucked up about it. Much more content with who I am as a person emotionally, intellectually, socially, and physically, so I know the sad feels will pass. Looking forward to seeing what 2020 brings."
BeforeNAfterAdoption,fc5zqzd,t3_eg43ko,1577469173.0,"Look at those precious nacho ears! You've got quite the cutie there, OP. :)"
AskWomen,fc5wyeq,t3_eg7srq,1577467638.0,"Growing up I was always more on the awkward side. My cheeks were a bit too chubby, eyebrows too thick, had no concept of style, etc. I grew up with an older brother and was never super girly, so being hot sort of eluded me until my early 20s, lol. Back then I made social connections using my personality. 

It wasn't until I had been working out for several years and became best friends with someone who was into makeup and hair that I really hit my stride. I noticed that generally people were nice to me for no reason. Girls who would've been too ""popular"" for me in high school were eager to be friends, and guys would approach me in the most random places. One time a cute baseball player from my first high school saw me at the gym years later and introduced himself as if we had never spoken before. Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯

In a way, the change has made me more hyper aware of how I look. When the cashier calls you ""really pretty,"" it's a little dopamine boost, so I find myself ""keeping up appearances"" almost always. The last guy I dated exclusively complimented me on my face and body, so you start to wonder if you bring anything else to the table. I have mixed feelings about going from ugly duckling to more as I get older."
ExNoContact,fc5u199,t3_egckkk,1577465874.0,"Way to go, OP! You should be really proud of yourself. :) Remember that you weren't just strong in your dream; you're strong IRL too. Keep moving forward!"
ExNoContact,fc46qhd,t1_fc2nyjl,1577408114.0,Youâ€™re welcome.â¤ï¸
AskReddit,fc274ri,t1_fc267es,1577343487.0,"Much appreciated.â¤ï¸I haven't told many people about what happened, because it's kind of humiliating...especially after raving to everyone about how great he was. It's awful that something similar happened to you. Really glad to hear you've healed a bunch since the event. Sending hugs your way as well."
AskReddit,fc22mm4,t3_efqzp6,1577337937.0,"I found out I was cheated on a few days ago...

EDIT: I'm overwhelmed with the love and support. Thank you all so much."
ExNoContact,fc0with,t3_efjni4,1577301556.0,"I'm so sorry you're hurting. :( The pain of a breakup can be intensified during the holidays with all the smiling faces and get togethers, like you said. Just remember that your worth isn't tied to a relationship or lack thereof. 

You sound like a kind person who's very introspective, with a big heart. Those qualities will continue to draw people in at any age. Merry Christmas, OP. I'm rooting for you."
ExNoContact,fc0w282,t1_fc05lbd,1577301187.0,"Stay strong, Flora. I hope when you wake up, you're in better spirits. Merry Christmas from a random internet stranger.ðŸ’š"
relationship_advice,fbxrsx0,t1_fbxkrlr,1577198742.0,"Everything you said is exactly what my gut was telling me right after it all happened. I thought â€œWhy is he being so collected about me thinking he FUCKED ANOTHER GIRL?â€ Admittedly, Iâ€™ve dated more emotional people in the past, but I feel like an innocent personâ€™s response wouldâ€™ve been frazzled and upset that I could ever think such a thing, not something to the effect of, â€œI could see how that would be suspicious. If you need time, so be it.â€ Itâ€™s like he was already prepared for the consequences. 

I actually did catch him lying to me once about who he was texting, but I brushed it off, since it was much earlier in the relationship. Thanks for calling a spade a spade. Yesterday night I was still in denial because, for the most part, our time together was kind of perfect (i.e. easy, fun, sweet). I gave him all the space he needed, and look what happened."
