Seriously,  I'd have been more persistent with the crating. I have a dog door and a well fenced backyard. She hated the crate as a puppy, and she had mastered the house breaking thing after two weeks, so I stopped putting her in the crate when I was at work. 

I don't know if she was bored or teething or something, but at about 6 months she went through a mild destructive phase. At least one item was chewed to pieces in the backyard when I got home every day. Nothing was safe. I started leaving junk mail on her bed as sacrificial offerings.   On a positive note she got over it and I have new shoes (remotes, phone chargers, DVDs, etc)."
