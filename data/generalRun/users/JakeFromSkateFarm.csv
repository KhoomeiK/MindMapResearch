todayilearned,fftg0ec,t1_fftcyyt,1580219481.0,"It's actually not an exaggeration:

In Africa and Asia, the war hastened the end of colonialism by now-bankrupt European powers. Over thirty new independent nations arose from these former colonies. The last half-century of African and Asian history is likely very different, and significant portions of either region may still be colonies today if the war hadn't financially and militarily bled their owners.

In Asia, the war also ended Japanese Imperialism, but in turn would launch an economic revolution that would turn Japan into first a source of cheap manufacturing and then quality manufacturing. This in turn helped fuel similar economic revolutions throughout SE Asia, such as in Singapore and South Korea. It's likely Japan is still an empire, while the Asia it doesn't control remains under European ownership.

Additionally, the Germany-style occupation by the Allies of Korea would lead to the Korean War and resultant perpetual state of war between North and South Korea, and the struggle for decolonizing French Indochina would lead to the Vietnam War. No war, and decolonization likely takes a very different tact, if at all. No Vietnam likely means a very different America acting on the world stage in the 80s and 90s (for example, the US helps support the resistance to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in part from a desire to give the USSR its own ""Vietnam"").

World-wide, the Allies would form the United Nations to be both a stronger replacement for the weak League of Nations that had failed to prevent WW2, and to also handle the war crimes trials of the Nazis. It would also lead to the creation of the IMF, WTO, and other economic organizations that were intended to prevent future economic triggers to war by easing and centralizing the flow of funds for loans and investments by nations.

Also world-wide, the war would leave the USA and USSR as the two predominant would powers, who would in turn use the rest of the world to fight a proxy war against each other for the next 50 years, including revolutions, assassinations, coups, trading and political blocs. The US in particular had learned from the war the necessity of air and naval bases to stage bombers and fleets, and the threat of nuclear armageddon only further pushed both the US and USSR to ""align"" the third-world with them to ensure access to bases as well as the rare minerals needed for nukes and high-tech military equipment (e.g. the military precursors to GPS, cell-phones, computers, etc). 

Sovereign nations and entire regions were destabilized, both directly through coups and indirectly through illegal schemes to fund the Cold War (eg drug smuggling via Air America and arms smuggling as in the Iranian Arms Deal), and the Middle East and South America in particular would see wars triggered or fueled by the US and/or USSR as either direct or opportunistic means of undermining each other on the world stage.

It's sometimes a pointless exercise to say who suffered or who suffered worst in this or that event, but it's quite reasonable to argue that large parts of the world were more greatly impacted (and often for the worse) by the effects rippling out from the war than Europe was by the war itself."

literature,fft88mz,t3_euo953,1580211879.0,"I would not be surprised if Moore had read Dostoevsky and knowingly/unknowingly absorbed some of his work into his own.

Having said that, I find Moore to generally be overrated, but that may be because I've been exposed to enough interviews with him to know how highly he thinks of himself compared to everyone else, either in the comics industry or in the movie industry.

Anyhoo, regarding the existential stuff - there had already been an essay or two (IIRC, one by Umberto Eco) - that sorta dealt with the 'meta' of comic book tropes and how, effectively, the commercial nature of comics create the villains, making the structure of comics morally complicit.

(I'll try to TL;DR this: comics started as basic cops and robbers, graduate to superheroes like Batman and Superman taking on muggers and robbers (and in Superman's early socialist years, a lot of greedy bank managers and landlords). This quickly becomes boring - there's only so many ways to write your standard mafia goon or petty criminal, and it's hard to convince a reader that some low-rent mugger with a pistol really has a chance of defeating someone with genetic and/or high tech superpowers. Finger and Kane stumble on the supervillain concept via their introduction of Joker, and because supervillain concepts are so hard to come up with, it's easier to keep bringing them back, hence the invention of Arkham Asylum, Batman's 'no kill' policy, and similar comic motifs that allow for villains to keep returning. In short - the serial (non-stop week to week in the strips, then month to month in the books) format of comics requires villains capable of threatening the heroes, and then requires them to let the villains stay alive and free to keep generating interest, which effectively means tens or hundreds of thousands of Gothamites have been killed by the Joker in-universe because DC Comics out-of-universe needs him around to keep selling Batman titles).

Ahem, back to my anyhoo - as I said, there'd already been a few essays IIRC on this, and as much as I love Watchmen, I think a better existential treatment of comics is actually in The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller (which I hate rec'ing given Miller's post-9/11 descent into racism, xenophobia, and the very fascism he was criticizing in his comics writing in the 80s). But it's a great read, and makes a somewhat underappreciated point that, without Batman (in the story, he retires for roughly ten years after the death of Robin), Joker essentially goes catatonic in Arkham as he no longer has Batman to arouse his maniacal tendencies. It's only when Batman comes out of retirement to combat a vicious street gang that the Joker suddenly revives, gets out, and returns to his criminal ways.

Alan, in his own way, is doing much the same, in terms of his explanation for heroes and villains being the result of an escalation between cops and criminals with the use of costumes and vigilantism, and similar to Miller's work (which features a subplot where Superman has effectively become Reagan's tool for the war on communism), he also touches on the notion of how in a real world setting such superhumans would inevitably be controlled or hunted down by the governments of the world.

Having said that, I think the major difference between Moore and Dostoevsky is that the latter sees humanity's sinful ways (so to speak) as the result of how mankind's collectively fallen state manifests in brutal authoritarian structures like the state and (corrupted) churches. Moore I think sees it more only as just the natural result of individuals being selfish and impulsive, which having superpowers only amplifies due to the greater ability they have to act on and force their will upon others.

The thing about Watchmen is that I think it really springs from two creative motives within Moore - the interesting question of how realistically would ""supermen"" in the real world be actual heroes versus corrupted by their own power and/or unable to comprehend life for 'normal' humans, and the somewhat mischievous desire to dirty up known comic book characters. Keep in mind, he originally wrote the story to use a B-list cast of characters that DC had bought from another comics company, and in reality both they and the 'original creations' Moore was forced to make when DC refused to let him use their new properties were effectively duplicates of the more well-known characters like Batman and Superman. Put another way, I think Dostoevsky wants you to hope that somehow in the end there can be redemption, whereas Moore I think is more iconoclastic and wanting you to see how far your idols could be dragged down with just the slightest touch of realism (in that way, he kinda echoes the famous Joker plot of him believing ""one bad day"" can turn a hero into a villain (in The Killing Joke graphic novel, it's Commissioner Gordon, in the Dark Knight movie, it's Harvey Dent).

I don't say that to dismiss Watchmen - it's a great book, great movie adaptation, and great TV series. It's just a really solid universe that lends to storytelling.

BUT...I suspect Moore just got lucky. I'll admit to being biased against him as I genuinely cannot stand his views on himself and, while I do believe comics can match other forms of literature or art as great works, I feel his obsession with making comics ""legitimate"" leads him to view himself a bit too seriously and generously."

baseball,ffc4k9e,t1_ffazpai,1579791365.0,"I still think the more likely reason to avoid the union wasn't that they'd fight the suspensions, but that the league is hoping (or has a deal already with them) to accept the no penalty here in exchange for the obvious free agency collusion from the past few years.

Put another way, my guess is the league was either already aware or quickly became aware in investigating the Astros that this may be a thing where a third or a quarter or more of the league has been doing this. We know the Red Sox are being investigated and there were rumors of the Yankees, Dodgers, and at least a few more IIRC.

It's one thing to suspend a handful of players from one team. It's another if suddenly needing to suspend 2-3 (or more) players from possibly five or more teams. There's also the whole mess of who and how they get suspended. Just the ""masterminds""? Anyone who benefited? Do pitchers benefiting from run support count? Do pitchers who batted in interleague play count? Is it different suspensions if the player now plays for another team and the other team feels like they're being unfairly punished for something that didn't happen on their watch or involve them?

Right or wrong, the above spaghetti mess is one option. Another option is the Astros agree to play the villain for a minimal fine and draft pick hit in exchange for doing their part to bring labor peace through a wink wink deal with the player's union to view the lack of player suspensions as the league's payoff for the union not using the obvious FA collusion amongst the owners in the upcoming talks.

It's easy for a team or commish to take the hits of being ""cheaters"" or ""weak"" if you know it's the price for a greater payoff."

kansas,ff6uttq,t1_ff65mmf,1579635338.0,"Depends.

If the area average is (for example) $600/month, and someone builds a new complex that charges $1000/month, it's not uncommon for the cheaper places to go ""oh, we can charge $750/month and still be way cheaper than the expensive alternative"". 

Which in turn encourages the expensive one to go up to $1100/month to preserve the gap and all the ""luxury"" that gap leads people into believing it has over the cheaper places. Rinse and repeat.

The cycle's even easier if there's fewer options (either in terms of complexes or landlords if a few companies hold most of the properties)."
