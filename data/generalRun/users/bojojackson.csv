Thank you!"
sewing,fclnf5i,t1_fcl13lp,1577751895.0,I just changed the needle from 14/90 to 9/70. I will def try the stabilizer. The needle helped a lot but it's not completely flat. Thank you!  :)

cats,fckl43o,t3_ehkqrg,1577727691.0,"what an incredibly beautiful soul and steadfast companion. It is one of the most difficult things to say goodbye to such a devoted and loyal pet. 

The love you feel for this girl is tangible. This hit me right in my heart, over the years I've lost a few. The pain gets less but it never really goes away, nor should it. So many of us share your pain, you can be sure many tears were shed today for Luna, along with our own lost loves. Sending hugs."
cats,fcaux6k,t1_fcajaa8,1577577102.0,Awesome. She might have had a bit of a reaction to the anesthetic as well. They sure keep us on our toes. :)
cats,fc86rfk,t1_fbwa93g,1577528120.0,How's your kitty doing?
cats,fc86g51,t3_egp4ah,1577527923.0,<3!
cats,fbw8x1b,t3_eerusa,1577143667.0,"I'm wondering where she was in her cycle when she was spayed. I had a girl who was breed a few times by the breeder. When she went into heat she would get really really sick like that and I'm just wondering if it has to do with like a sudden hormonal change. 

Hope your baby makes a speedy recovery."
cats,fbw8fsd,t3_eervhd,1577143317.0,"So sad to read this. Sending a big hug. Such a sweetie. 

After I lost my girl I couldn't think of getting another cat. I didn't for 15 years. Long story how I ended up with my brood now, but when I  ended up fostering all those years later I unexpectedly felt even closer to my long lost girl."
