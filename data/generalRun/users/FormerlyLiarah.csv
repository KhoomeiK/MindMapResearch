explainlikeimfive,ffvdxjc,t1_ffvd0hm,1580261853.0,Okay. It’s still maths based. Lol.
explainlikeimfive,ffv89ab,t1_ffv6jyg,1580258039.0,How can you have a maths based class and not address the problems? Lol
explainlikeimfive,ffus4vp,t1_ffukj11,1580248328.0,"I had a chemistry professor who assigned homework and didn’t check our problems. The homework wasn’t even due until the exam. If you asked her to review the problem with you, she’d either hand you her answer manual or run through the problem super quickly on the board. I found myself face-timing my father (who is a chemist) for homework help. 

I complained to the dean. Thankfully, they allowed me a late drop and refunded my money."

What are they looking for in terms of grades, or are they more concerned about just having a license to practice and being a good fit in their work environment?"

I’m so sorry for what you’re going through, but nothing you could have done would have changed the outcome. Only she was capable of that."
