sportsarefun,ff3dmbi,t1_ff08v30,1579538988.0,Also it’s “cute” that an OLDER and FEMALE and NUN was able to juggle and then throw the ball in a straight line since she’s not a boy and she’s not 18

toastme,fey3olz,t3_eqrov1,1579440389.0,"I’m not going to tell you you’re beautiful because if your post is honest then you won’t believe it anyway. I’ll tell you this: this is your one life. If you think that what matters is the envelope you were born into, get ready to waste your life on stupid stuff. Get going young friend before life passes you by. Travel, volunteer, date, read, take walks, try lots of jobs to see what you love doing. I’m 45 and just became an EMT trainee. I don’t care what I look like, I care how I’m spending this short short life. Up and at ‘em!!"
