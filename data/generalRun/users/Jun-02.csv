But yeah, needs to be modified but I really like the idea of being able to colonize your own little town/safe area."
dogs,ff4yoew,t1_ff4xg1s,1579575632.0,"Okay, thanks so much!"
dogs,ff4t7fm,t1_ff4nfqd,1579571868.0,Thanks. Will it eventually stop with time/training? Or will it just stay as a big No for her to try to interact with him?
dogs,ff4qc3p,t1_ff4o3si,1579569893.0,Thank you so much! :) will be looking into all these videos
dogs,ff4n1no,t1_ff4lda4,1579567586.0,"Also, as I work with him and even after I get a professional to socialize him with (If a professional becomes necessary) Would it be good for him if we got a smaller dog to keep him company? I also don't really like when we leave because he's just there by himself. I think that's one reason our past small dogs weren't trouble makers, because they had each other."
dogs,ff4molz,t1_ff4lda4,1579567331.0,Thank you so much! :) I'll definitely look into those videos and keep at it.
dogs,ff4mh7j,t1_ff4ldla,1579567185.0,"Thanks. With my little sister, he just showed teeth and snapped as she was petting him. I think it's only when she pets him because when she's outside he is there ""normally""."
dogs,ff4hp0l,t1_ff4h8bz,1579563872.0,"Thank you for the advice/info! I really love the dog and want him to be happy, I feel hopeless at times because of real life occupations so I cant be with him 24/7 but I really want to have him ve good. I will see how I save up $ to have a professional work with him, in the meantime, I'm doing what I can with him. Because the main things that would be GREAT to fix are him running away when the gate is open and him being socialized/friendly."
dogs,ff4g5as,t1_ff4fr27,1579562806.0,"Thank you! For the showing teeth/growling, what should I do? Because I totally get if he wants to be left alone by strangers at places, I can easily get a mouth guard so he cant snap but since this is family that lives here and a little girl, it's more serious. So would it work to just slowly have them be together and over time he'll be good with my little sister or? Thanks for the advice!!"
