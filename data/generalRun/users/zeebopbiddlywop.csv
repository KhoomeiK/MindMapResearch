In fact, when I called my gyno (a male doctor), he did not make me jump through hoops to have a conversation. Every doctor I've ever had has made me have full on exams just to ask a question. My doctor sat me at his desk and listened to me. No exam. No special procedures. Just a discussion to find out what my options were about extremely painful, unbelievably heavy, debilitating periods. I almost cried because he made the process so easy and was so kind about it. He recommended me a 20 minute surgery. I have not had a period in nearly 6 years. He changed my life. I no longer suffer.

One of the best I've ever had. I don't see him as a man, I see him as a doctor and I value his skills as a doctor.
