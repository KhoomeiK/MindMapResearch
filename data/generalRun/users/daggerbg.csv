""You're"" is the short version of ""you are"" and it is used to describe someone

And also I know when to use ""you're"" and when to use ""your"" because I have been studying English for the past 10 years. I am now studying level C1 and the difference between those two, well I studied it in my first year of studying English which was in second grade."
