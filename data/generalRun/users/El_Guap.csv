northcounty,fd7p4r1,t3_ejm9ay,1578207911.0,"Welcome to North County!

As a background, I grew up in North County coastal, lived in Michigan for 5 years, Chicago for grad school for 5 years, and NYC for 10.

PLACES TO VISIT

So lots of suggestions by others, here are mine to add to the lists (largely North County coastal where I live):

* Salk Institute on the cliffs of La Jolla (not La Jolla proper but on N. Torrey Pines Road near UCSD and the PGA Torrey Pines golf course) at sunset is the best view in all of North County.  It's a Louis Kahn building and one of the most architecturally significant buildings in San Diego.  
* The Glider Port right next door is great too on the weekends when there are lots of paragliders soaring above the cliffs.   
* If you golf, there are lots of great public golf courses in North County that are really well maintained and reasonably priced.  
* Zen Garden at the Self Realization fellowship on the cliffs of Encinitas.  
* Yoga... outside of India, this is the mecca.  There are more Yoga studios per capita in the coastal area of North County than anywhere else in the US.  

All of the coastal towns... even Oceanside, are all really nice and worth visiting.  High on my list is downtown La Jolla -- there is a cove, always frequented by seals sunning themselves, and great tide pools.  Some of the best restaurants in all of San Diego are there (great happy hour food and drink prices especially on Sundays for some reason) and lots of shopping.  

I would say that Del Mar has arguably the best beaches.  Starting July 18th the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club starts it horse racing season and is pretty much the most beautiful horse track in the US.  If you are going to have a dog, the Dog Beach in Del Mar is the best in North County.  There is also a Polo which is worth seeing at least once.

&#x200B;

PLUBIC TRANSIT

Regarding living in San Marcos and transit, it's quite a bit East of the coast and public transit it POOR to say the least.  I would recommend getting a car because even simple things like getting groceries is tough in North County because of the urban sprawl and lack of density.  Until you get your car, Uber/Lift is your friend and you may want to look into ZIPCAR (a car share subscription service that focuses on college campuses and downtown areas -- much cheaper than Ubering all the time).  As mentioned there are some rail options and there are buses... but they really are not convenient timing-wise, nor do they really go where you would want to go easily.  

&#x200B;

BEFRIENDING LOCALS

People in general are pretty friendly in San Diego, but tend to be flaky (don't take it personally).  Since you will be on a academic campus, you won't have any problems at all meeting people.  It will be diverse and engaging.  People in San Diego say ""hi"" to strangers... very different from NYC...lol.  There will be a lot of people on and around campus that are new to the city looking to make friends like you will be.  

I feel like there is less racism in North County than most areas of San Diego and San Diego is a big coastal city with a lot of immigrants/visitors/non-natives.  People are more concerned about your economic class/income and education level than your race, it seems.  You being in grad school probably have nothing to worry about.  That being said, the further from the coast, the lower rents and more xenophobia.  Costal North County is a huge biotech hotbed as well as having a lot of Tech companies, so there are tons of all races and countries represented to include tons of people originally from India.   I would say that the most prominent racism in San Diego is against Mexican/Central-Americans (aka ""illegals"") given the border proximity, but that is just ignorance like every other kind of racism.  

I can only speak from my experience, but I have friends of pretty much every race here in San Diego.

SAN MARCOS ITSELF:

Restaurants I have been to and like in SM: 

* Prep Kitchen - good higher end restaurant (one of the few in San Marcos) which locations in Del Mar and La Jolla as well.  
* Pita Guys - fantastic middle eastern food near CSUSM.  Awesome food... great prices... nice guys/gals that work there.  Always try to eat there when I am there. 
* Taco Bar (Near the Nordstroms Rack) - probably the best taco (burritos are ok too) in SM.  Have an ""abuelita"" (grandma) making fresh hand made corn tortillas all day.  
* The Bellows - great gastro pub food.  
* Mana BBQ (All you can Eat) - part of a chain of restaurants, probably the best AYCE korean BBQ.
* There is also an Indian restaurant there (don't know if it northern or southern) that I heard was good, but I haven't really found any in San Diego that can compare to the ones in NYC or Chicago (almost no indian fine dining at all in San Diego).  \\
* Not is SM but close (VISTA) is Vamos a Texcoco, which I have been dying to go to.  It's a Mexican restaurant that specializes in whole lamb and goat stew.  It's supposed to be amazing... it's often hard to find Mexican options outside of the ubiquitous Taco/Burrito joints.  

San Marco it self doesn't seem to have a lot going on; I am sure it is different on campus.  I have never had any reason to go there for anything other than going to the Nordstrom's Rack or to a kids birthday party at an indoor trampoline park.  The place was actually fun for adults too as they have trampoline dodge ball... very very fun with a group of friends."

yeezys,fd0566b,t1_fczc3rh,1578113784.0,"I agree.  Inner tag is correct (fonts all congruent and straight) and matching the outer box tag.  The UPC is correct for the color and size. Shoe looks good (but I haven’t spent a lot of time on the triple whites/cream). 

I always look at the insole as well.  If the edge is perfectly cut through the bumpy area - good sign.  Stitching is well done under the insole.  Text on the side of the insole is perfect with the spacing around the “dash” even.  

Also, a new one to me, pull up the piece of fabric on each side of the inner heal.  The fabric on the inside should be stitched to the edge.  Less obvious in this shoes since every layer is white/cream,  it more obvious with shoes where the inner heel color is different then the inside of fabric."
