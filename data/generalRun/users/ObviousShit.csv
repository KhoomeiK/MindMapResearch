On the evening of February 13, 1945, a series of Allied firebombing raids begins against the German city of Dresden, reducing the “Florence of the Elbe” to rubble and flames, and killing as many as 135,000 people. It was the single most destructive bombing of the war—including Hiroshima and Nagasaki

While the Nazi Party's own SS forces (in particular the SS-Totenkopfverbände, Einsatzgruppen and Waffen-SS) of Nazi Germany was the organization most responsible for the genocidal killing of the Holocaust, the regular armed forces represented by the Wehrmacht committed war crimes of their own, particularly on the Eastern Front in the war against the Soviet Union.

Your source also goes on to show pictures of the SS and Einsatzgruppen commiting atrocities, the whermacht itself was not responsible for death camps or industrial killing as you call it. In war every country ignores the rules of war, the U.S and germany both engaged in unrestricted submarine warfare, the U.S executed prisoners of war, and firebombed civilian cities in both Germany and Japan, in fact the firebombing of Dresden killed more people than both atomic bombings.

HistoryMemes,fg501hf,t1_fg4xsrq,1580514995.0,"That was the SS not the Whermacht, by the time period you are referring to late 1944, the whermacht was 70% Conscripts and foreign sourced manpower from then Czechoslovakia, Austria, and other occupied countries. Most volunteers by this point were from the Hitler youth, and went straight into the SS. The SS and the Whermacht were TWO completely separate entities.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oradour-sur-Glane_massacre

The SS was hitlers personal bodyguard, that with 38 divisions in 1945 was basically an army in and of itself reporting to Himmler and Hitler only they are the force responsible for the Holocaust, and the vast majority of German war crimes and were the last to continue fighting.

People tend to forget that throughout world war two Germany had a political Military, and the national military and both organizations behaved very differently from one another. 

For more detail I recommend watching interviews of surviving whermacht, and surviving Waffen SS personel. You will find Whermachr soldiers are apologetic for their role, but were forced to arms to defend their homeland, while SS soldiers always appear unapologetic and carry their fanaticism on to this day."

history,ff53o7f,t3_erojdm,1579579349.0,"To get a good understanding you need to look at how Britain came under Roman control.

When undertaking his invasions of Gaul Ceaser was still making a name for himself, the successful Gaullic campaign essentially solidified Ceasers prestige and place in Roman society.

Ceaser initially invaded Britian with only Two legions this occurred in 55 BCE and Accomploshed very little. The second invasion a year later involved 5 legions. This large of a force was never really contested by the Britons and ceaser moved all the way to the Thames. At this point several warlords opted to become Tributaries to Rome. This was limited to small client Kindoms and does not constitute ""Conquest"".

Under Claudius in 43 CE the actual conquest of Britian began. By this point some of the Britons had been under Client states to Rome for around a Century, the vast majority of Briton still lived under the old Tribal systems. Because of this there was no attempt or reason to assimilate. The conquest itself lasted until 84 CE and the Stanegate was constructed (think of hadrian's wall but further north) the Romans had conquered the territory they were interested in and were not really able to hold the territory, with the forces available.

By 117 CE the Roman Forces withdrew to only the territory they knew they could Controll effectively and built Hadrians wall in the south. This year also marked the Death of the Emperor Trajan after Trajan the Roman Empire began its Death spiral. 

Faced with Encroachments on Roman Terriorty across the map, Britian from a strategic view becomes, of no value, it is geographically separated from the rest of the Empire, and any troops stationed there cannot easily Redeploy to where they are needed, this coupled with resistance of the native Britons as well as suitable defensive lines and forts along the Roman's walls means that from 117 the Roman's only hoped to hold Britian rather than expand. Roman rule effectively ended in 410 after, the Romano-British expelled the roman  Magistrate from the island."

My mos was 74D Chem-Bio so as a PFC I was essentially responsible for the chemical weapons defense of the whole force, for this annual period of chemical training I was given approximately 6 CS Grenades(tear gas) and a number of regular smoke grenades, the exercise begins and I was assigned to OPFOR, with the rest of the enlisted personnel in HHC, we had laid an ambush for the armoured convoy we knew was coming and had 2 m249 LMGs mounted on tripods. (We are all loaded with blank rounds) the convoy approaches and we open fire using the mgs and the smoke grenades, the convoy dismounted and attempts what I guess was supposed to be an assault through and ambush, my first sergeant pull me and my CS grenades out of the trench and we flank around, I tell first sergeant to put his gas mask on and proceed to gas, the whole of the element that is pinned behind the Humvees. They assume that the grenades are more white smoke, and do not don their masks, the result was about a full company of the battalion inhaling three full CS Grenades. 

A successful ambush and flanking maneuver by any measure, however when I return to the fighting position, my sergeant, the 15 year E5, proceeded to smoke the dogshit out of me for not staying in the fighting position with him, in the army explanations are the same as excuses  so I  took my smoking and went on with the exercise.

I still have three CS grenades left at this point, one at the advise of the company supply sergeant made it's way into the air filter of a humvee with the logic being before you start a vehicle you have to inspect it. Company and battalion CO get into this vehicle and being officers ignore SOP and start the engine, the AC system kicks on and rather than cool crisp air hitting their faces, they get blast of CS grenade inside of a sealed Humvee cab. 

Another one of the CS grenades found it way into an undefended troop tent, and the last was lobbed into the first manned position I encountered. Of course I was later told I might have done too good of a job on that exercise, but hopefully someone learned that wearing the gas mask on your hip may one day save your life.
