aww,fei674e,t1_fehhos7,1579131169.0," Want you to know: I understood your post perfectly. If I had ovaries, they’d be twitching too."

StarshipPorn,feeqdvv,t3_eoa8lv,1579038998.0,"Hey OP, is this your design? I’d love to model this bad boy. (I’m an FX artist, and need an excuse to do a spaceship). If I credit you, could I animate this?"
TumblrInAction,fe63cs5,t1_fe48xnz,1578880861.0,It might well mean that your daughter has an actual mutation similar to the original blue-eyed fellow.
CPTSD,fe08qp1,t3_engi02,1578806172.0,"Right here. I was actually diagnosed with ADHD. A sizable part of my trauma was how my parents treated me because of it. It was only last year (at the tender age of 45) thatI learned that attention issues can be CAUSED by childhood trauma. I.e. that not only did my parents abuse me for something that wasn’t my fault, but it was something that THEY did to me.  

....sorry for ranting. I just needed to get that out."
MGTOW,fds9p2l,t1_fds8vku,1578697578.0,"And ... set and match. Good game, don’t know if the other guy will even reply after that."
MGTOW,fdoep0w,t1_fdocwcm,1578603718.0,They DO attack men with acid. Something like 45% of acid attacks have male targets. It’s just that no-one cares when a man’s face/life is destroyed on a whim.

MensRights,fcl4u7v,t1_fckp9et,1577739838.0,"Are you serious? We honestly can’t call it rape anymore?! The whole point of this subreddit is to make a place where men can speak freely (and don’t you tell me it’s not, mods: I helped *make* this place back in 2008). **If we can’t call an adult taking advantage of a young teenager rape, just because women feel squeamish about it, we have LOST. **"

MGTOW,fckrwgt,t1_fckkxwj,1577731863.0,"Dude, what’s with the Jew-hate? Seriously. We don’t rule the world, we don’t meet up in secret cabals about how to enslave all of humanity. All of those were ideas made up for ‘The Protocols of the Elders of Zion’ by tsarist propaganda artists to keep people afraid of communism. 

Unfortunately, Henry Ford got hold of it, didn’t realize it was fiction, and published it throughout the US.  (Hitler later gave Ford the Iron Cross, as someone who inspired him)


My point is, the whole ‘da JOOS run da werld’ thing is old, it’s provably false, and it just makes you look... out of date."

That’s why I cannot foresee any way I could let myself marry."
