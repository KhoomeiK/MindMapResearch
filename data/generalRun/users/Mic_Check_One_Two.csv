lightingdesign,ffiv34j,t1_fffn0er,1579983442.0,That was the TDís goal when they set this console up... But they still wanted individual control of each light. So they only have like 10 of these assigned as groups. The rest are individual lights.
lightingdesign,ffiuu2q,t1_ffdyslu,1579983281.0,Iíve also worked here. The TDís idea was for basically any untrained person to be able to walk in and run a show off of faders. Which... In a way I guess they accomplished. But it means itís a goddamned nightmare for anyone who actually knows what theyíre doing. The first thing I do when Iím there is jump to like fader page 5 and start building my own groups from scratch.

rpghorrorstories,ffdvxoa,t1_ffdaurd,1579830261.0,"Itís also where a lot of beginners try to get their feet wet. Lots of people find an organized environment (like inside of a game store, or part of a large Discord LFG group,) to be much more comfortable than just showing up at some random dudeís apartment and hoping for the best. Like the DM has been vetted by the game store.

So you have a weird combination of:  
A) People who have been exiled from all the other groups, because of their behavior, and  
B) Newcomers who have no idea how the game is actually supposed to run.

It means lots of players will only ever play once or twice, before the toxic players run them off."
CrappyDesign,ffdkrqk,t1_ffcwv0h,1579822965.0,"Pretty sure itís cocked sideways to allow for exhaust extractors. Itís fairly common on fire trucks and ambulances, since those are typically parked indoors in dispatch/fire houses. So you attach the extractor hose to the exhaust, and it blows things outside to prevent the entire garage from filling with fumes. But you can only easily attach that extractor hose if the exhaust is cocked sideways. Then whenever a dispatch call rolls in, they simply pull the hose off and the truck is ready to roll out.

So it could just be that this truck is using one thatís also made for emergency services. Or itís frequently parked and left to idle in a garage."

My neighborhood has a shitty node that AT&T refuses to replace, so we just get random ìoh yeah your router is working fine but the neighborhoodís node overheatedî brownouts at odd times. Sometimes for just a few minutes, but the worst I experienced was ~20 mins when I was trying to upload a video. That was fun. 

And calling to report the outage it is usually just met with a ìlooks like itís working on our endî because the node has rebooted by the time you actually get to a real person. That obviously doesnít fix the ranked game you just dropped out of, halfway though a match.

If you have fiber in your area, then absolutely jump on that. My parents just down the road have fiber from AT&T and love it. The company has refused to install it at my place though, so Iím still in the dark ages with copper.

AmItheAsshole,ffbgla0,t1_ff9on81,1579764370.0,"Exactly. Watched it happen to a friend of mine. Dude got nearly ten million dollars in inheritance from his step-father passing. This is in an area where the median household income is something like $80k/year. Two years later, he was nearly bankrupt.

When he first mentioned it to me, he asked if I knew anything about how to handle suns that large. I pleaded with him to invest it in something like long-term US treasuries, index funds, or G7ís... So he could basically just live off of dividends as his income for the rest of his life. Even at a paltry 1% return, a ten million dollar investment will return *a hundred thousand dollars annually*. Thatís no chump change, and heíd never have to work a single day of his life to maintain it. And 1% is actually a hilariously low estimate. If youíre only making 1% returns on a 10 year treasury, youíve got some major issues and need to rethink your investments.

Did he do any of that? No. Instead, he blew it on sugar babies (oddly enough, giving pretty girls $50k for plastic surgery isnít a good long term investment,) and a house that he couldnít afford the taxes+upkeep on."

A good example Iíve heard in the past is one with firefighters: When more firefighters respond to a fire, the fire causes more damage. We can estimate how bad a fire will be by the size of the response. Therefore, firefighters cause damage, and should stop responding.

Itís an awful argument if you actually know anything about firefighters. Obviously more respond because the fire is worse, and is causing more damage/taking longer to fight/etc... But if you knew nothing about firefighters, I could intentionally misconstrue the statistics to convince you that firefighters just go around building pyres."

Thereís always some new shortcut or workaround to implement, or some new reason why you might EQ something a certain way, set effects a certain way, dial dynamics in a certain way, etc...

Itís usually little things, but every now and then you get something that just blows your mind. Something as simple as Shift+Update on an ETC Ion can be mindblowing if youíve never seen it used before. Once you know about it, you never stop using it. Itís a huge timesaver.

Keep your head down, donít stand out, and youíll be fine when the authorities eventually talk them down or bust the door in.

The passengers on the first two planes likely expected just that to happen. Then suddenly they were crashing into a building instead. The passengers on the third plane heard about the first two, and actually fought back against the hijackers once they realized what the plan was.

Essentially, a cochlear implant has ìchannelsî that it listens to. Each channel is a specific frequency band, which it then sends to the corresponding sections of the cochlea. So higher quality implants will have more channels, (or better definition in each channel) giving them more definition.

The reason we arenít able to fully replicate human hearing is because of those channels. The cochlea is normally full of hair cells, each hair cell is a ìchannelî, effectively giving us thousands* of channels. But even the best cochlear implants only have like 24 channels.

3.	When in anotherís lair, show him respect or else do not go there.

5.	Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal.  
6.	Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and he cries out to be relieved.  
7.	Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success, you will lose all you have obtained.  
8.	Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself.  
9.	Do not harm little children.  
10. Do not kill non-human animals unless you are attacked or for your food.

Essentially, a cochlear implant has ‚Äúchannels‚Äù that it listens to. Each channel is a specific frequency band, which it then sends to the corresponding sections of the cochlea. So higher quality implants will have more channels, (or better definition in each channel) giving them more definition.

The reason we aren‚Äôt able to fully replicate human hearing is because of those channels. The cochlea is normally full of hair cells, each hair cell is a ‚Äúchannel‚Äù, effectively giving us thousands* of channels. But even the best cochlear implants only have like 24 channels.

That‚Äôs 4GB just for a 1GB video.

It‚Äôs also possible that he had something like a RAID array for his drives. It‚Äôs not a backup, but it provides redundant protection against data corruption. Essentially the idea is that you spread the data out across multiple drives. So if a single drive fails, you don‚Äôt lose everything. That one drive can be swapped out, and the RAID array will continue as if nothing had gone wrong. But this takes a lot more space. At the more extreme ends of the spectrum, an 18TB RAID6 array may only be able to hold a few TB of data, but would be able to survive two full drive failures before any data was actually lost. For something as shady as child porn, I‚Äôd actually bet that this is the answer. Since downloading/uploading it is a huge deal, the dude probably didn‚Äôt want to lose what he had.

For those who are curious:  
1.	Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked.  
2.	Do not tell your troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them.  
3.	When in another‚Äôs lair, show him respect or else do not go there.  
4.	If a guest in your lair annoys you, treat him cruelly and without mercy.  
5.	Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal.  
6.	Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and he cries out to be relieved.  
7.	Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success, you will lose all you have obtained.  
8.	Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself.  
9.	Do not harm little children.  
10. Do not kill non-human animals unless you are attacked or for your food.  
11. When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask him to stop. If he does not stop, destroy him.
