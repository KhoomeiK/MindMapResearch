As the civil rights movement and dismantling of Jim Crow laws in the 1950s and 1960s visibly deepened existing racial tensions in much of the Southern United States, Republican politicians such as presidential candidate Richard Nixon and Senator Barry Goldwater developed strategies that successfully contributed to the political realignment of many white, conservative voters in the South who had traditionally supported the Democratic Party rather than the Republican Party.

Meat and starches and veggies etc.  In one of the reality shows (Three Wives I think), one of the wives basically made a huge platter of sliced bread.  They were in pairs, so you'd assume they were sandwiches, but there was nothing showing.  Just 2 flat pieces of bread.   OK, so no biggie.  THEN she said ""kids come get dinner"" and I was shocked.

How can someone on a fixed income lay out hundreds of dollars to feed working adults and their children?   Should she just skip her doctors and meds for a month to save up?  It's a holiday, it's family time, sure.   If she could afford to do it without stressing her finances she probably would.  Do you prefer that she just not cook for everyone?

My mother and I were fortunate enough to be able to afford to do big dinners for a couple dozen people.  I feel sorry for people who can't.  It's awful to want to make a celebration for your loved ones and not being able to pay for it.   And no, just dong what you can afford doesn't cut it.  Who wants plain spaghetti and bread on Christmas?  

The family members SHOULD kick in.  They should have offered.  They should have known whether or not she could afford it."
