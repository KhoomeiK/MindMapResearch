baseball,fgmpynd,t1_fgmooqe,1580929678.0,"I’m a corporate transactions lawyer. Trust me, I have a better understanding of how corporations function than 99% of people considering I’m privy to highly sensitive, confidential information of billion dollar corporations as a regular part of my job. I’ve helped negotiate multi-billion dollar acquisitions, I’ve helped startup companies go from early stage funding rounds to IPOs, and I constantly advise companies on how to minimize losses while maximizing profits in industries ranging from oil & gas to aerospace to software/hardware tech to medical device and pharmaceutical companies. You’re condescending to the wrong person here.

My point is that the luxury tax is a pittance to these teams, and the increased revenues generated from winning will offset the short-term losses from the luxury tax. Everyone on here was just complaining about how $5M is not even close to sufficient punishment for the Astros when you take into account how much extra money they made from playoff/WS tickets sales and championship merch. Yet all of a sudden, spending $20M is a sufficient enough loss to justify not trying to maximize the odds of winning and offsetting those expenses? That much money is life-changing to people like you and me, but to businesses like this it’s a rounding error. 

Let me repeat - not a single organization would be rendered unprofitable from the luxury tax. If that were possible, the owners would’ve never agreed to the luxury tax. The owners of the Red Sox make more than $20M a year just in interest alone. At a certain point, the argument that $20M is too expensive just doesn’t hold up."

baseball,fgmo8x8,t1_fgmnle7,1580928644.0,"Yeah of course they will. However, I agree that it’s a bullshit argument. I explained my opinion on billionaires wanting to skirt the luxury tax [here](https://reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/ezbmsr/_/fgml6nb/?context=1), but I basically agree with your last sentence. There’s not a team in baseball that would be rendered unprofitable, let alone unable to operate as a business, as a result of the luxury tax."
baseball,fgmno0u,t1_fgm9cux,1580928300.0,"The thing is, it’s a bit of a gamble to assume Mookie wants to return to Boston simply because it’s the Red Sox. The Yankees pulled this same strategy off with Chapman in large part because he wanted to play in pinstripes. Here’s what Chapman said after re-signing with the Yanks:

>	“I love the organization, they welcomed me with open arms, and that's why I decided to go back.... I was hoping I had a chance to go back, and it happened.... Every player dreams of being a Yankee, and if they don’t, it’s because they never got the chance.”

Yes I’m a biased Yankees fan, but I don’t think that takes away from the veracity of the argument here. It’s a risk to assume Mookie feels the same way about the Red Sox as Chapman did about the Yankees. Anyone can offer Mookie a massive, long-term contract, so just having the cash to pay him isn’t sufficient in FA. If he feels any lack of trust or respect from the Red Sox as a result of this, he’s not gonna want to go back and can go somewhere that will pay him whatever the Red Sox would offer. This course of action relies on the goodwill and rapport the team has built with Mookie, and being willing to pay him now instead of in FA would solidify that relationship and increase the chances they don’t miss out when he’s a FA. 

Now, maybe they know he does feel that way. In that case, it’s not as risky as it seems. But I haven’t heard Mookie talk about the Red Sox that way (please correct me if I’m wrong there), and I think any non-Boston fan would agree that the Red Sox don’t have the same appeal as a team like the Yankees (few pro sports teams do - the Lakers are really the only other pro sports team that have *that* much cache and appeal). Not to mention if Mookie gets a taste of what it’s like to play elsewhere and realizes he doesn’t want to go back, then the Red Sox have no shot in FA no matter what they offer him. Factor in the fact that the Red Sox are in a rebuild and unlikely to compete for another WS title in the next 3-5 years adds to the factors against wanting to rejoin the team. If they really want him back and are willing to pay for it, then it’s penny-smart but dollar-stupid to let him go now. 

Tl;dr - It’s a bold strategy, Cotton. Let’s see if it pays off."
baseball,fgml6nb,t1_fgmha8i,1580926820.0,"I’ll never understand the argument that it’s acceptable for literal billionaires to avoid the luxury tax. The luxury tax only applies to overages, and even then it’s maxed out at 50% of the overage. The Red Sox had $247M in player salaries last year, with the cap being $206M. That’s an overage of $41M, meaning the luxury tax cannot be more than $20.5M. They had $516M in revenue though, and their operating expenses were $84M. They were still turning a profit of nearly $200M even if we apply a max luxury tax to them. 

There’s really no excuse for any team not to pay the luxury tax. I think people forget owners have a say in what the luxury tax is - does anyone really think they’d agree to a tax which runs the risk of seriously harming any organization? The only reason the luxury tax works is because billionaires are greedy and want to hoard every dollar they can. No team would be rendered unprofitable, let alone unable to function, if they had to pay the max luxury tax every season.

These organizations get tax breaks, government subsidies and all kinds of benefits and handouts from the cities and states they play in. I think it’s more than fair to expect them to pay a luxury tax to make the team more successful - winning is the ROI a city/state expects from their subsidization of the team. An extra $20M per year is nothing to these teams, but they act like it’s asking them to chop off a leg."

Again, so what? If anything, that’s a good thing - it shows he supports players rights to autonomy in where they play. Andre didn’t have a say in where he was moved - why should he be forced to play there?

>	If the VP of my employer made $17M and I’m on a rookie contract doing all the work yet he’s not even showing up then I’d be upset.

The VP of your employer got to *choose* to work there. Also the NBAPA isn’t anyone’s employer in this instance, so not a good analogy. It’s more like if you were part of a unionized industry, and the VP of the Union got a $17M contract for doing nothing. You’d be stoked, because that means the Union has enough power to force employers to give union members contracts for doing nothing. 

>	Vince Carter is like 43 and will happily provide whatever services needed to whatever teams that wants him. 

So? That’s his prerogative. He could also quit and never play again, but he’d rather play than not. Andre clearly doesn’t care to play unless it’s for a contender. That’s fully within his rights. And you’d be stupid to reply with “well he should just retire” because who’s gonna pass up $17M when the alternative is $0?

Everything you’ve said is nothing but corporate bootlicking. I’ll never understand why people take the side of the clubs and not the players in these situations.

NYYankees,fg40c0l,t3_ewp3br,1580493485.0,"As much as I love Tanaka, Hideki will always be my favorite Japanese player. The bat looked like a tree trunk in his hands and every time he swung, it was like he poured every fiber of his being into the swing. 

And he earned the fuck outta that WS MVP. Even though he only started 3 games that Series, he batted .615 with 8 RBI, and tied the single game record for most RBIs in a Series game. Dude lived in the clutch. 

In fact, that WS was just fuckin legendary for him. He was the first Japanese player to ever win the WS MVP, the first MLB player to win it as a full-time DH, the second player to ever win rings in North America and Japan, and the third player in MLB history to bat .500 or above and hit 3 home runs in the same World Series, joining only Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. 

Other fun Matsui facts: he hit a grand slam on his 34th birthday, and a 3 run donger on his 35th. In a 2009 game against the Red Sox (which ended 20-11), he became the first Yankee to drive in 7 runs at Fenway since Lou Gehrig in 1930. That season he also set the single season HR record for a Yankees DH, with 26. When he joined the Rays, Matt Moore wore number 55 so Matsui chose to wear number 35 because it’s the same number Moose wore. When he retired, he became the youngest player ever inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame, beating out Hideo fucking Nomo. He gave up a $64 million, 6 year contract from the Yomiuri Giants - the highest offer in Nippon League history - to join the Yanks. He didn’t miss a single game in his first three years playing for the Yankees, which still stands as an MLB record for most consecutive games played to start a baseball career. When combined with his Nippon League consecutive game streak, his consecutive pro ball game streak was 1,768 straight games. That streak was only ended because he broke his wrist mid-game on a sliding catch in the top of the first, and had to leave before he could accrue the half inning or AB needed for the game to count. BUT after breaking his wrist on the play he still threw the ball back to the infield. When he came back, his first plate appearance was an RBI single and he went 4 for 4 with a walk and two runs scored. During his career, 35 Japanese reporters were assigned to cover him. His nickname, Godzilla, actually started off as being an insult to his skin problems early in his career, but he was so god damn good that it quickly morphed into representing his power at the plate - dude straight up made his haters eat their own shit. Oh and he’s naturally a right handed hitter, but when he was growing up playing with his older brother and friends, he was so fucking good at hitting that it embarrassed his brother, who insisted Hideki bat lefty otherwise he wouldn’t play with him. Hideki never went back to batting righty.

And my favorite Hideki fact: when he got married, NOBODY knew who his wife was. He didn’t tell anyone her name, and there were zero photos of her available - all people knew was that he married someone who had been formerly working in a “reputable position at a highly respected company“. The only image anyone had was [Hideki’s awesomely amateur hand-drawn depiction of her](https://www.nydailynews.com/resizer/qMseu9NvFuF3lqtcjr6hINzUbJo=/415x336/top/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/262KPHVBH7GJZVO6J7GEOGUYYM.jpg). Big. Dick. Energy.

Hideki is everything a Yankee should be. I fucking love that guy.

Edit: An additional fun fact about his marriage. Jeter and Bobby Abreu said at the start of spring training that year, Hideki overheard the two making a bet of who would get married first and got in on the action. The bet was Jeter had one year to get married after Abreu or Matsui, and Abreu - who had a long time girlfriend - had six months after either Jeter or Matsui got married. When Matsui got married, Jeter was quoted as saying, “It was a bet between me and Bobby. [Matsui] finagled his way into it. That's pretty good. Sneaky. How do you say 'sneaky' in Japanese? I should have known he was up to something.... He won. I've got one year. No chance.” Hideki straight up *finessed* Jeter and Abreu, injecting himself into the bet knowing he was gonna get married soon. Did I mention big dick energy?"

I’m an IP lawyer (although none of this is legal advice and I’m not any redditor’s lawyer). Everything you’ve said is wrong. Trademarks are jurisdictional by nature. Whatever Russian law says has absolutely zero bearing on whether a trademark can be enforced in the US, or EU, or any other jurisdiction. Having a Russian trademark is absolutely worthless outside of Russia. It doesn’t “strengthen his case” at all.  

In the US, when someone files for a trademark, they have to submit an application to the USPTO. That application gets reviewed by a USPTO examiner, who conducts a clearance search of the mark to see if anyone else has received or applied for a confusingly similar trademark for the same or similar goods or services. If they find any such pre-existing trademark, the application gets rejected. If they don’t, the trademark gets granted. There’s no “case” - it’s a simple examination of the USPTO records. And they absolutely don’t give a flying fuck if there’s a trademark registered in another country. Because trademarks are all about identifying a single source of a good or service. Nobody is going to confuse Delta airlines with Delta faucets, because there’s absolutely no way someone looking for faucets would mistakenly book a plane flight. Similarly, nobody would get a trademark that’s used only in one country with a trademark that’s only used in an entirely different country, because they’ll know they’re dealing with a Russian company and not an American company. Anyone could file for an unregistered SCP trademark in the US right now and (likely) get the application granted, notwithstanding this Russian dude getting a Russian trademark. 

Why that’s a dumb idea is because anyone who has used the trademark in commerce prior to that can file a pretty simple lawsuit for trademark misappropriation. Even if someone doesn’t register the trademark, as long as they used it in commerce, they get common law rights to the mark (note: it’ll be pretty easy to prove prior use in a court of law here - the site owners just show evidence of the date they launched the site and the trademark holder would then have to show evidence of use in commerce prior to that - which they can’t because the SCP website created the mark in the first place). Those common law rights can supersede the trademark which was granted. So all that would need to happen is the owners of the SCP website file a suit against the subsequent trademark holder, and a court would invalidate the subsequent trademark with respect to that particular pre-existing use for that particular set of goods/services. The court wouldn’t go, “hmm well this guy has a Russian trademark so we better defer to Russia here. Dismissed!” Again, because what Russia law says is absolutely irrelevant to what US law says. 

Yes, this guy’s actions have implications for how the site is run in Russia. But it has absolutely fuck all to do with any other jurisdiction."

This is not true, and at best is a gross mischaracterization of the FDA’s regulations. Not to mention you even state that they can refuse to approve a drug - that’s a rejection.

Uh, maybe because that’s not the FDA’s job? All they do is confirm that the drugs are safe and effective. Whether a drug/device/etc. is “useful” is irrelevant to whether it’s safe and effective. Whether a certain drug/device is “useful” is what’s considered by the USPTO when granting a patent.

That doesn’t explain all the *innovation* I referred to as well.

It was able to float while open with two adults and a baby inside, so it should have enough buoyancy to stay afloat even if it’s closed with just one body inside. The only way it would sink is if it were flooded while closed, but DIO still has to breathe - he can’t hold his breath for 100 years. His little glass compartment that Wang Chan transported him in had already broken, so there was no way he could be hermetically sealed like that while the coffin is submerged. And even if he were, that’d mean he couldn’t connect to Jonathan’s body, and Jonathan’s body would decompose over the years. 

And if the response is, “well he stayed in the sub-compartment, sealed in, while the main compartment Erina was in was flooded,” then you still have the issue that the sub-compartment is big enough to hold a man of Herculean size and strength, meaning it likely has enough volume to still overcome the volume of liquid displaced by the coffin and likely wouldn’t sink.

See that’s where you’re wrong again. Nazis are actively trying to hurt or kill you. They’re just trying to foement enough power to not suffer any consequences for doing so. I don’t think they deserve the opportunity to foement that power, and history has proven they *will* act on it when they get sufficient power.

It’s only overwhelmingly marginalized because they know they’ll suffer consequences if they act on that ideology.
