books,feev3cm,t1_feeiulv,1579041854.0,"Yes! The whole time I read the book, I wished that Donna Tartt had a better editor! I have a theory that, since it had been 10 years since her last book (and she is possibly also a recluse?), that the editor was afraid to make too many changes."

AskReddit,fdsh6by,t3_emzrit,1578702665.0,"I just finished re-reading Wicked. I picked it up off my mom's bookshelf when I was home for Christmas, since I had finished the book I brought with me for the trip. I read it years ago and basically had no recollection of the story. Because of that, I figured I wouldn't like the book a whole lot (if I loved it, wouldn't I remember it?), so I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it."

Cooking,fdel192,t3_ekvwmj,1578341278.0,"I am a vegetarian, and my husband is not. We cook a lot of stir fry dinners. It's really easy to cook all the veggies in one pan and the meat in another, and then just dole it all out to the family accordingly. Plus, it's all so versatile that you can avoid any vegetables you don't like."
