What the hell? So this person divides humanity into white people and ""the others."" It pisses me off when I get called white, it's reductive and completely ignores how there are, like, two hundred different cultures of white people, with distinct traditions and characteristics.

Each of The Nine represents a planet (and presumably the Sun), and they will cease to exist if either the solar system is destroyed or life in it ends. This is why they help us by doing things like sending Xûr to sell us goodies. 

There are also two factions. One faction comprising five of The Nine is actively helping humans because their existence relies on humans existing. The other faction made up of the other four is trying to figure out a way to become independent of humans. One of the Nine deliberately blinded Earth satellites to allow the Red Legion to invade because he thought the Nine could use the Light extractor to become self sufficient.

Roman gladiators were vegetarian and ate a diet of grains and beans. They were also chubby, more like strongmen or boxers, and not cut like bodybuilders. 

Humans are not meant to eat a lot of meat (but they are supposed to eat meat sometimes). Even cavepeople rarely ate meat, and foraged for berries and grains to feed themselves (they were also generally monogamous and shared most jobs regardless of sex, including raising children). Hunting takes a lot of energy, which then needs to be replaced with food. There's a good reason why carnivorous animals tend to lie around doing nothing.
