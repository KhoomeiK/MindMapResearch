Interestingly enough, my personality is the opposite of what you've guessed. I am in fact very introverted, private, and extremely risk-averse, always have been since a young age. I cannot be in large crowds of people and am incredibly sensitive to loud noises, heights, speed, etc. Basically any abnormal experience of any kind can cause a ton of anxiety. I still don't have a driver's license and I'm in my late-20s for example. I don't really like talking to others unless they are close friends. I've gone more than a week without speaking to another human (a few times) and have been perfectly content. I keep a pretty consistent daily routine and almost never seek out new experiences.

If I had to speculate about a connection to SDAM, I'd say that a reason might be that because I don't really have visceral memories of my positive experiences like most people do, I don't have much of a desire to repeat them. Instead of your suggestion that I would want to do them more often, it's more like ""well why would I do that again?"" I think it's the people who remember how much fun they had that want to do things. If I had to guess this probably plays a role in a variety of serious mental health issues I've had since I was a kid, but who knows.

Also, it's not like amnesia or anything. I ""remember"" things that have happened, I just can't relive them in the way that I understand other people can, nor do I really feel like it was ""me"" that was there in any important way. In fact, when I can recall something in my mind at all, it's always in a weird third-person perspective. Very hard to explain but my speculation is that I'm basically making something up based on the facts about the past. I also dream this way, as far as I can tell."

I wouldn't be surprised.

I'm starting to resolve them finally but it hasn't been fun. 

Interestingly enough, and further to your point, aphantasia may be correlated with something called Severely Deficient Autobiographical Memory, which is something I have as well. Basically you know things that have happened in your past, but you cannot ""relive them"" like most people can (I didn't know most people could do this until recently). It makes sense to me that this would be related to aphantasia and would also contribute to mental illness. I have no ""happy memories"" that I can relive or use as motivation when I'm feeling down like others can. But that said, I also have no ""bad memories"" either.

And in response to your DAE, yes, definitely. I'm always thinking about things, but it's usually just me talking to myself or planning (or, let's be honest, worrying).

Algebra is about how we can manipulate mathematical objects in equations using rules, like ab=ba or a+b=b+a. There are very well-defined mathematical proofs of these rules that do not rely on using particular numbers.

So to say that a% of b is the same as b% of a, we need the algebraic rule.

You can prove a particular case using arithmetic, sure, but that would only be the one case. 10% of 5 being the same as 5% of 10 doesn't necessarily tell you anything about whether 28% of 3 is the same as 3% of 28.

Think about what is actually happening inside of the printer. Toner has a powder-like consistency and sticks to the paper via electrical charge.

The only reason the toner stays on the paper is that consistent electrical charge; otherwise, it would go all over the place.

I've actually been interested for awhile as to why there isn't a monastic tradition in Islam. Not sure if you could shed any light on this but if you can I'd be happy to learn about why this is.

Buddhism,fe69fds,t1_fe5wdjk,1578884715.0,">To dispel any doubt about his reasons for prescribing this precept, the Buddha has written the explanation into the rule itself: one is to refrain from the use of intoxicating drinks and drugs because they are the cause of heedlessness (pamada). Heedlessness means moral recklessness, disregard for the bounds between right and wrong. It is the loss of heedfulness (appamada), moral scrupulousness based on a keen perception of the dangers in unwholesome states. Heedfulness is the keynote of the Buddhist path, ""the way to the Deathless,"" running through all three stages of the path: morality, concentration, and wisdom. To indulge in intoxicating drinks is to risk falling away from each stage. The use of alcohol blunts the sense of shame and moral dread and thus leads almost inevitably to a breach of the other precepts...

>It may well be that a mature, reasonably well-adjusted person can enjoy a few drinks with friends without turning into a drunkard or a murderous fiend. But there is another factor to consider: namely, that this life is not the only life we lead. Our stream of consciousness does not terminate with death but continues on in other forms, and the form it takes is determined by our habits, propensities, and actions in this present life. The possibilities of rebirth are boundless, yet the road to the lower realms is wide and smooth, the road upward steep and narrow. If we were ordered to walk along a narrow ledge overlooking a sharp precipice, we certainly would not want to put ourselves at risk by first enjoying a few drinks. We would be too keenly aware that nothing less than our life is at stake. If we only had eyes to see, we would realize that this is a perfect metaphor for the human condition, as the Buddha himself, the One with Vision, confirms (see SN 56:42). As human beings we walk along a narrow ledge, and if our moral sense is dulled we can easily topple over the edge, down to the plane of misery, from which it is extremely difficult to re-emerge.
