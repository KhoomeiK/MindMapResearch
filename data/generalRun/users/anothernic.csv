I don't disagree, but once that system fundamentally ignores the rule of law (see the Bill of Rights, Amendment 5, right to due process), you cannot honestly place faith in that system continuing to abide by any of the other amendments or laws that in theory govern it.

If Michael Hastings or Anwar Al-Awlaki dies without a trial under suspicious circumstances (or outright admission of drone bombing), impeach, jail, or otherwise have the judiciary severely punish the perpetrators. Al-Awlaki would have been convicted by any jury, but murdering him without due process is illegal as fuck, which isn't to mention murdering his 16 year old son, or his 8 year old daughter (who were both also US citizens)."
