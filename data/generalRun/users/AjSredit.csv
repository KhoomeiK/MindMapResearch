news,fegh2gb,t3_eow82n,1579092523.0,"We live in a retirement community in south Texas.  A few exceptions are made, but there are no permanent children living here.  The place is clean, quiet, friendly and well kept.  Other communities on any side of us do allow children and are basically slums.  Of course we feel for others, and if they can abide by the rules, why not offer the chance or heres a thought. Vote as a community on the course of action."

aww,fdtc9kv,t3_emvmdg,1578714713.0,"You just destroyed my wife with this cuteness.  We lost our six year old buddy to ivdd.  He was pure joy for such a stubborn lil dude.  Lost his back legs I ignored vet and gave him crate rest for 8 months and he made a full rexovery.....for a full year he was back running around.  Them 3 vertebrae ruptured at once and I held his paw as they put him to sleep.  Still remember him looking at me right in the eye as he went.  Dont want to bum you out, yours are beautiful...be watchful of the genetic trait, hits 25% of the breed.  Enjoy your new pups and old friend."

worldnews,fdqrn69,t3_emiteq,1578673406.0,Just because you can do something doesnt mean it's a good idea.  Needlessly agitating the most important thing in peoples lives seems like a desperate creator who's out of ideas.

Took a lot of research to learn how to treat and that long backed pets are prone to this.  Ivdd.  So happy for this little guy.  The joy they have when they get their freedom back is real af.

personalfinance,fbj9rbs,t3_edi8wr,1576928450.0,"52 here.  Run company on my own for 11 years.  It's all I know or want but the body fails and for the first time I Feel old.  You just wake up that way one day and realize it.  Your mind feels the same, but everything slows down and recovery takes longer.  Its hopeless out there and I'm doubtful I cam grow bigger ti hire help and thrive....tick tock waiting for that final hammer to fall.  Cant imagine what that will actually mean.  Not sure I'll stay.  So hoping for a happy ending here for your dad."
