When I do bookkeeping work I use it but I'm so fucking messy and disorganized it looks like a serial killer trying to use sacred geometry to tell google to buy groceries and set a reminder for pigeons.


The financials look good though... so I do get there."

Music,ffqpe48,t1_ffqmym1,1580140536.0,Lol my bad I thought I read they were both in the music industry. But I do expect a full report on Jimis mom when I'm off work.
UnexpectedlyWholesome,ffqn41c,t3_eukog4,1580138964.0,Men are so sweet. Running over to help do the thing! I bet they all felt very thrilled after they set it back down. :)

AskReddit,ffpxvt2,t1_ffpfw05,1580110188.0,"Same. I was so confused. But RBF + ptsd +  adhd + crippling depression is just like a shitload of obstacles so I don't blame myself for not understanding. Just wish I had managed to retain some friends now that I'm feeling a lot better.


I was watching a [video essay](https://youtu.be/dGiQaabX3_o) about ancient humans and they had compared them to what we think of an ten of all trades and having a rich social life where as now we can be a little more specialized and we're less likely to depend on social groups. It just makes you think about what we are designed for and how we actually live."
todayilearned,ffpioid,t1_ffomhbt,1580095974.0,Ah. Well. Maybe get over it?

todayilearned,ffn9ib4,t1_ffmsday,1580063428.0,"Some people have ptsd or anxiety problems and don't like it when people are behind them, or can't see the entrances and exits to a room, or if they are in rooms with only one entrance and exit, or if their path to the exit is obstructed. It's not a fun thing to live with. I hope reading about it can help you be a bit gentler in your approach, because implying op is overreacting is not thoughtful or helpful. We all deserve kindness and respect"
