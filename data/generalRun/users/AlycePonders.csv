I don't think it's fair for people to compare. Grief doesn't care whether or not a child should be more important, and if someone has never lost a child, the grief of losing a pet may be the worst they've ever felt. Its also different for everyone, no doubt there are people who have lost a pet and a child and felt both pains hit them the same. 

While what she said was insensitive, she wasn't saying it to hurt you. She was saying it because she was grieving. She was probably saying what she did to fish for advice on how to cope with death. Whether you feel it's the same as losing a child or not also has no bearing on how she feels at this time.

You were both being insensitive to each other's pain and loss."

I probably shouldn't have shortened it to child hater, since that does mischaracterize, but it's still a leap assumption to make for just a child free wedding (which, I've not made assumptions I literally asked for clarification in my first post, she just then said a bunch of stuff in response that didn't clarify and just came off as extreme entitlement)

I think you might be reading too far into my thoughts. I don't think I have made a single assumption about how she thinks (and if I did, I'm sorry). I've only attempted to comment on the fact that I think the insults and statements she made are unfair and come off as entitlement (and maybe that isn't her goal or genuine feelings, but it IS how it comes off)"

It's okay to feel sad that having kids has resulted in isolation I don't think anyone who has addressed this person has suggested otherwise. It's just the insults and entitlement people don't like."

AmItheAsshole,ffifg25,t1_ffi5kvx,1579972593.0,"I mean, I'm neither a teenager or a young adult and I don't think their views are reasonable. It's not that their situation is impossible to understand, or that their frustration is unreasonable. It's the judgement of others for not catering to their situation that people like myself are disagreeing with. She called her friend a vain bridezilla who she lost respect for because her wedding was no kids allowed. It's the judgement and entitlement for other people to cater their weddings to her situation that is disagreeable. 

Like, yeah, it completely sucks that having kids means certain aspects of her life have changed, and she feels isolated. But that doesn't mean her friend was vain or what have you. Part of being an adult and making choices means other things may become less accessible or other people can't include you to the same degree. This applies whether it's having kids, buying property, pursuing certain careers, or even just having pets. As an adult with obligations, I can't hang out with people to the same degree, or live anywhere I want, etc. Just part of adulthood, and blaming or judging others for not catering to YOUR needs instead of their own (especially for their own wedding) is kind of a jerk move imo, and wholly unfair."
AmItheAsshole,ffi17qf,t1_ffhzok5,1579962003.0,"No one is telling you what it best for you or your family. They're telling you what is best for them and their wedding. It sucks if it made it tougher for you to socialize, but that doesn't make them vain or bridezilla or anything of the sort. It just means they don't want kids they don't know at their wedding. 

I 100% sympathize with being mom-zoned, but it still doesn't mean your friend was being vain. If you feel that way, it's not actually something your friend did wrong. It reeks of entitlement on your end."
AmItheAsshole,ffhy3mu,t1_ffhx3ai,1579958885.0,"Are you assuming that she thinks kids ruin everything and is vain just because she didn't have kids at her wedding?

I adore kids. They make me so happy. But I'd still be someone who would consider banning kids from my wedding ceremony, or at least only have kids I specifically invited. It can be super boring and overwhelming for kids to be at a wedding, and if they lash out because of that it can be uncomfortable for everyone. Doesn't mean I hate kids or think they ruin everything. 

I hope you're basing those assumption on her actually saying she hates kids or is vain based on things outside of just her wedding."

privacy,fesfq25,t1_femdgac,1579364690.0,"Honestly I've done this a lot. Publications will charge either the readers or the authors because they need to fund the journal and pay their staff somehow. For obvious reasons then, a lot of authors seek to get published in journals that charge readers (plus it's considered more reliable for the readers because the journal doesn't need to take as many articles as possible to make money). While these authors publish with publications that charge readers, they usually don't care if the reader pays or not and just wants their research out in the world."
