bipolar,feo56gz,t1_femfopv,1579295281.0,"Thank you for reminding me to breathe. It's really what I'm forgetting in all of this, which may sound silly. I'm doing crazy breathing techniques and all sorts of other crazy coping skills but I'm not just stoping to take a moment and plain old breathe. I will try that. Thank you."
bipolar,feo4w3k,t1_femgmh7,1579295125.0,"Thank you so much. You're completely right, I just have to go and do it! And I do have a good set of coping skills to get me there... So it's just *doing* it. Thank you, kind stranger. Your words have helped immensely. I will probably re read them several times before my class begins I'm sure. Thank you so much."
bipolar,fe9b09j,t1_fe6nakx,1578935999.0,"That's actually a really good tip to record the class, I'm going to remember that one. Thank you!"
bipolar,fe9ais9,t1_fe6qiqh,1578935868.0,Thank you so much for this. You make an excellent point about the demon hoardes... I am definitely going to remember that in calculus. Math is not my strong suit and I am focused in science! Thank you for the tips.
bipolar,fe99p1p,t1_fe8rqu1,1578935616.0,"You can do it! I want to get my degree in earth science to start, still figuring where to go after that. I'm taking it one day at a time for now."
bipolar,fe98w7a,t1_fe8sw52,1578935464.0,This is what took me years to realize. I felt so much pressure in high school to finish that I felt like college was the same. Now that I'm older I feel like I can take my time and finish at my own pace. Congrats on your hard work!
bipolar,fe92fbw,t3_enyftw,1578933418.0,"Thank you so much for all the support and advice posted here you guys, I really feel like I can do this now and you guys have brought it to a whole new level! I don't have a post to edit this onto but I figured I'd at least comment on here. Thank you so much, this community is great. So much loveðŸ’•"
bipolar,fe6iy1w,t1_fe6c655,1578892381.0,That's amazing! Congratulations!!!:)
bipolar,fe6itbo,t1_fe6hrcc,1578892256.0,Congratulations on finishing!!! Got any tips?
bipolar,fe6ipz8,t1_fe6fhrl,1578892171.0,You've got this! :) you'll be done in no time I bet! Thats what I'm telling myself about getting started... I'll be done before I know it! Keep it up!
bipolar,fd6pw8k,t1_fd6phkx,1578194276.0,Thank you. I did not know there was an office so i will look into that!
BipolarReddit,fd5s317,t3_ek3ixt,1578180858.0,Can the pharmacy help with giving a few doses to hold him over? I dont know how long it will take but I've had my pharmacy give me a few days worth to hold me over before. I dont know if this is an option?
crafts,fd5r9bo,t1_fa8xcpd,1578180595.0,Thanks for your advice! After a ton of trial and error I wound up using diamond glaze. ðŸ˜Š They turned out great!
bipolar,fcoimdi,t1_fcn5h4f,1577833136.0,"Right now I'm on lithium, zyprexa, lexapro, and risperidone."
bipolar,fcoibl6,t1_fcm8d0i,1577832919.0,Yes. I told my pdoc about it and he bumped my risperidone from 3 to 4mg so *hopefully* that will help but this is just ridiculous. It's like my mind has all this free space from not thinking about being suicidal all the time so the paranoia just moved right in and took over.
bipolar,fafzln9,t1_fafdg9h,1576035949.0,Amen
