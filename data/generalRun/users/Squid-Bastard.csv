todayilearned,fej6jvf,t1_fej620e,1579158960.0,"Basically no two bloods are 100% exactly the same, or very unlikely, it's got way more components and parts than people think, even if the types match. Also every component of blood gives and receives differently, so O- blood cells go to everyone, but the plasma is nearly unusable for most. Hell the fact your can get transfusions so easily for most of you haven't screwed up your blood is incredible, you can be an exact organ match and still need to take anti rejection medicine for life. But people who do have odd blood for whatever reason will sometimes have hospitals call blood banks to call specific rare donors they know of. Or they will sometimes collect the recipients blood in advanced for a surgery if it's odd and give it back during the surgery."
