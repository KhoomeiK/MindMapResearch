bipolar,feuqw3r,t3_eqnqw3,1579389082.0,"I hade a period of like 4 months of mania that just got stronger and stronger, I stopped seeing friends much ever since school ended and the army is close by, so I worked out a lot with a group in preparation for the army, I soon later added workouts on my own so in a week 3 times with the group and 3-4 times on my own, and like a month after I started being hard-core about working out I joined martial arts gym and dude I was there 5 times a week training for 1:15-2:30 hours, in three of those days I had the group workout right before so it was another 1:30 of workout, and after that I would run from the gym back home for 7-10 km. And this went on for like a month and a half this intensity, shortest days were 1:30 of workout and longest were up to 5 hours lol, I felt amazing, I was so alive, I found how much I fucking love martial arts, it's like my medicine, and bro I ate so much food (healthy food), I needed the energy lol. 

Tbh just writing about it gives me those urges back, I think I am in the process of getting out of a long depression to a mania, I have started tracking my mood and I have spikes towards it, I think if I spark and start the right way, getting back to working out, I might just get to that state for a while"

bipolar,fejlq88,t3_ephh9t,1579179155.0,"Well i self diagnosed myself, let me tell you how I got there, I had an episode of psychosis (not stuff like hearing or seeing things or believing about a mission) but I started getting a bit paranoid, living in my own thoughts I stopped knowing how to act in social situations, my thoughts were racing and couldn't think clearly, it happened at a new work I started as a waiter and has been very stressful, that probably triggered it. That's when I started getting worried about my mental health, I have, since 16, had depression (not suicidal) with periods of time between them that I felt I could take over the world, I am amazing, I got into a huge manic episodes throughout my life and at one time worked out everyday between 2-6 hours a day for a month straight, I had manic episodes of probably a few months, but then I always have the crashes, those moments I start losing motivation, I stop caring about stuff, I get depressed, don't leave the bed, sleep 16 hours a day, and I never thought about any of it as more then up and downs, it seemed normal to me, but after that psychosis episode I realized something is seriously wrong with me and I then found bipolar which describes me exactly, I have been through exactly those things, I know myself better then anyone knows me, so when I reached a conclusion I am bipolar it was not an easy decision I had to rethink about over and over again, maybe I missed something, maybe it's in my head, everyday for the past week or so I am trying to find a a reason I am not really bipolar, I am over exaggerating, keep thinking back to all those moments, all those episodes throughout my life and it only confirms my beliefs, sometimes I forget that and again think I am exaggerating and start thinking how great I am but after how my previous two days went I realized oh right, I am getting manic that's why I am acting that way, and then I remembered all those manic episodes and understand there is no way around it. 
I don't want to be bipolar, I am scared to shit, I want to be normal don't you think, even if it meant I was as naive as others are.
I also have the abandonment trauma I got over the years as friends come and go, people you trust treat you like trash, no one cares, they act like they care until I am too much to them.
I get that some people will get it wrong, some are just confused or the idea of being mentally ill excites them, but what about a case like me, someone who tried to find reasons he is not bipolar but can't find, all I have are reasons why I am"

bipolar,feg7dlv,t3_eoz1tx,1579080498.0,"All of this makes sense, By the way of your writing you are most likely manic, mind you I am new in this world of bipolar (am 19), but sounds like you need someone to help you navigate since it could be that your judgment is clouded, you might be too confident in yourself (happiness to me when manic). That's my take away but of course I am not in your shoes, but I bet your So can help you figure out whether you are having a manic episode, and if so what to do, maybe you need someone to help you navigate through it, but whatever you choose to do, I think it will be best to make sure to have a plan, on how to be at your best during the episode and how to handle and watch out that it doesn't turn too strong it crash too hard. Best of luck"
bipolar,feevd3u,t1_feesqsp,1579042021.0,"First of all I am from Israel, so I get back home once every 1-2 weeks, so I will still update her on how the army is going on, what happens, but I won't share with her stuff like my disorder because I want to keep to myself certain stuff, I don't like being open about everything, those will be stuff I will share once I meet a woman I really love and trust, not everyone deserves to know it, or I want them to know. Now I am just daydreaming about something that won't happen in the near future.
Also I believe our motivations are different, while you don't want to be where you are I have reasons behind them I really believe in, believe me it's not a simple decision for one to make, this style of training, and pushing yourself to limits, and training to shoot, what to do in combat, etc. Are really stuff that talk to me, I have been training for a year as much as I can in preparations for the army and my general health, sure had those big downs before, but I have a way of managing and pushing through it even if I have periods of time I am depressed, once the mania kicks (it can be for like two/three months no joke) I get instantly back on my feet, and start training with times of 2-6 hours a day, depending if I had 1:15 or 2:30 hours of mma that day or not on the weekend, i basically catch up with all the loss I had from that depressive period, I can achieve so much when I get into it, and I believe the army will amplify it more. Sure  I still need to get through though times once in a while, but that's just who I am I guess, and I don't want to lose that spark of me that keeps me strong and moving"
bipolar,feeksoq,t1_feeiiww,1579035761.0,"If they somehow find out I have this, I will just tell them I didn't know, no way they could know whether I knew or not. assuming the information isn't shared with the military, if will know when I do anyway so I will take a private therapist instead of from the health care, and then this information is 100% private and cannot be forced to be shared by law, even the military has to abide by the law, so I can just tell them I am didn't know and they will have no way to prove it because they cannot access my files without my consent (I am a bit of a lier when it helps me and I think about all the angles hehe). 
If I know it helps me to share that I will, but I don't see how it will, I probably won't want any passes and it's available information for the army that will probably fuck me up if I try to get certain roles, I doubt that it is something that will be passed over when they consider me for a role I might want, it will surely give me way less chance of getting it because hey who wants a mentally ill person in an important role that needs responsibilities and many more"

I just don't feel comfortable doing that. I do know about myself a lot, I have only just recently started figuring out I have bipolar but I am not suddenly a different person, nothing changed about me (not talking about moods obviously lol) except for the fact I now know what condition I have, and what's been going on with me for a while, I now need to learn more about it through my own research and therapy, I think it will only do me better, and get me to handle challenges like I always do but better

Here is to in a weird way optimism to be able to live without the meds 🥂"
bipolar,feegohu,t1_feeesbq,1579033382.0,"Thank you, I get what you are saying but it's just something I like you know, Its not about the discipline or being a part of a team, it's about the challenge, the weapons, training, becoming a soldier is something I want, like how I like train in martial arts , I know it's not gonna fix my bipolar, but it's gonna give me goals, personal achievements, things that will get me better, serving in the military is mandatory here (Israel) and I much rather be a fighter then a desk job, programming or something like that.

Also I am going to see a therapist, but I am not planning on informing anyone about my condition (including the military) and will try to manage without meds, of course if things go bad overtime I will rethink about that, and will consult and do a lot of research, but for now I know i want to go without meds and handle my life with my condition however is necessary, but if I have to at some point in my life I will explore this option I promise. Will stay safe 🤞 

thank you"
bipolar,feeemqj,t1_fee8wyc,1579032175.0,"You are right, i understand now, I have thought about it for a while and my mom wants me to go to one to, I said I would search but didn't get down to it yet because I didnt see it as important, but you are right my judgement can be I bit over confident and well you know how it is, I think I recently started a manic episode, I have downloaded the app everyone is using to track emotions and last 5 days have been spikes towards it, and from a deep depression.
Ideally I think the psychiatrist would be to me someone who will help me know what to expect of my condition and how to navigate with it, but when things go wrong and bad I like to be alone you know? I don't feel the need to spill my heart, cry, it might be just the depression of me speaking but I don't think so, I just think that after all the shit I went through with people I don't care anymore about anyone, in a good way, and I think that's what keeping my mind clear of stress and anxiety, of course I would like to make friends and have fun I am still a human, but I think I am just being myself, and i really don't give a shit about anyone which is such a relief that's one of the reasons I am feeling better. 

But yeah I will get tomorrow on a psychiatrist, and luckily for me the army is accepting nowadays of Mental health issues, idk to how extent I need to check, and if I go to a psychiatrist the information won't get revealed to my parents since I am 19, but I do need to check if it gets to the army and if so how it affects me, (he is paid partially by Healthcare so he is much cheaper) and if it does I might look for a private one and split the bills with my parents since I get money from the army, anyways thanks you so much! You really made me rethink and understand why I really need a psychiatrist (few times do people manage to change my opinion). And I feel better now knowing I am gonna have a psychiatrist to help me figure this out. ♥️"
bipolar,fee22u8,t1_feduu8d,1579024785.0,"So here's the thing, basically I only figured out recently I have most likely some kind of bipolar after losing my mind a few times I did a little digging, so obviously no meds or doctors involved, and found out I had a psychosis episode for like two weeks, new work probably triggered it.            
it's all still new to me, I am still learning as I go what I am dealing with here, I am a mess, but I am sure I am more than capable of being in the army, I have the skills, will, motivation. There were times I forced myself working out to death everyday even when going through depression, I even hope to get into commando forces (I had 2 tests and didn't pass, I have 1 more chance in two months). I trust myself with weapons but more importantly I trust myself to know when I am not in shape of holding a weapon. Its true idk how I am gonna handle all the stress (hope it won't trigger anything) but I hope that the physical training will balance me out like it probably has been for the past 3 year.                    
I am scared to get another episode that was as bad as it was, but I won't let it stop me, if I get THAT bad, I will even break an arm to return home to get it healed, as long as I get through the episode and get back to the army.
As for depression I guess I will just have to manage and function (won't have any choice) and when I get a mania episode then great.
Also I will get to go home every weekend or two (trying to get a pass to go out each weekend) for three days, if I get a pass each week it should be easy, if I go home once every two weeks I will have to see how it effects me.

Btw I am from Israel"

when I smoked weed it only emphasized more and I remember having this ""episode?"" (still learning about all of this) super strong while eating high at my workplace (was a waiter) and I almost lost my shit so I went home, mind you I was feeling this way regardless of the weed for a while (also I found out my boss has a degree in psychology so it only freaked me out even more). 
so now I know if I ever feel like that again I should probably not smoke weed. But after that period I returned to kinda normal (although ever since that happened, sometimes I have those moments while socializing that I freak out on the inside because idk what to do or how to act, especially ending conversations I think?).

bipolar,fe6ghy0,t1_fe6e3ta,1578890187.0,"Idk I have handled good enough with that disorder on my own, and meds is not something I want to take anyway, i might get a psychiatrist sometime but probably not soon because I am gonna use the money for driving lessons instead which is probably far better for me. I mean some people live with that, I believe I can do it, it doesn't define all I am right?

Edit: tbh it might be the mania I just triggered talking, I know i can regret saying certain confident stuff like that sometimes but I want to dream I can do it.
Besides it's still me, its part of who I am in the end, The part with the mania that fights and can achieve the impossible at strong cases and the depressed part that honestly have grown me up quite a lot in a good way, and changed me for the better, I feel comfortable with who I am, don't give much fuck about others except good friends, don't ever care what people think about me I will just be who I am, I feel I have a better understanding of the world, and as a result I am more confident, charismatic, chill, sharper, I know it's weird that the depression did it but I just don't think my core nature and personality is like many others (I could be wrong, maybe i am like every bipolar lol) and sure it has an ugly and horrible side, the drops can be really hard, but I think overall it's just me, and using meds will turn me into someone I am not. What do you think?

2nd edit: kinda as looking at it as depression is my look into the world in a better way, through the eye of depression I see things differently, like check out my last post. It Wouldn't have happened without the depression part in me, and those are stuff I want and need to know, if I was still Innocent and wouldn't have gone through bipolar it I would have lost myself I guess?

Besides I have more then one side of depression, I can still be very active while super depressed.

I am a runner because I trained for the army for a long time but I never liked it really, and since I didn't pass physical army tests a month ago I don't really have a reason to run anymore, I know i will get back to it at least a month before the army (mid March) so I will be ready when I get there and won't be a fat slob.
I am not gonna work again since the army is right around the corner anyways and it only does bad for me, it's not worth the money."
