Lets say it's hunting season and some group just forgets to wear their reflective clothing and some hunter 250m away fires at a deer between them and the hunting party of 4 people get peppered with buckshot.  Nothing major at all, nothing more than a couple pellets hitting and leaving some bruises.  Well that would be considered a mass shooting by the majorly accepted definition because 4 people were injured by gunfire. 

The definition is just dumb.  A drive-by is considered a mass shooting.  Even a gunfight between 4 people where all 4 end up getting hit is a mass shooting."

DestinyTheGame,ffbguwx,t1_ffbf7rr,1579764707.0,"Losing a match but doing decent should lose a bit of Glory.  Losing a match and sucking really bad should lose a lot of Glory.  Quitting a match should be like Season 3 levels of Glory loss.  It should be **punishing** to quit a match.  Bungie knows when players quit matches and when their network cuts out, so improving that a bit more should do wonders to stop quitters from even playing Comp in the first place.

That being said, winning a match and doing incredibly well should net you the opposite amount of Glory as quitting since you're becoming a legend in the Crucible.  Tales of We Ran's and 7th Columns should come with the Lion's Share of Glory."

DestinyTheGame,ffbaas3,t3_esb6pt,1579757194.0,"The matchmaking in this game is so fucked up.  It's hard to believe Bungie made Halo with how bad the matchmaking is here.  Teammates are supposed to be your backup, not ankleweights.  85% of the time when I'm playing Solo Comp my teammates are getting 2, maybe 3 kills while my first death in the round is always a knockout.

With how bad the matchmaking is, I feel like Glory needs to be looked at and how it's distributed.  I feel like the best players of the match should receive Glory while the weakest teammates should not gain any or lose glory depending on if their team won or lost.  If you're the grand hero of your team getting 35 kills in Survival and you still lose then you should get some Glory for actually being good.  This way people will actually have to try in order to get Glory rather than just get carried."

DestinyTheGame,ffb9stm,t1_ff9my03,1579756541.0,"The ""you had to be there"" model is totally fine.  Part of what I love with redoing missions like Whisper and Zero Hour is remembering all of the streamers pouring in trying desperately to get through and to gain some sort of foothold in either mission.  Stream recaps help you get that idea back, but the true magic is being there yourself.  Still being able to experience it after the fact is important.  What's better when recounting a story, telling someone ""you had to be there,"" or actually going in and showing them all the fun stuff that happened.  Showing TR3VOR and tricking them into getting killed by it.  THAT'S the magic we need."

politics,ff4q79j,t3_erjoaw,1579569800.0,"I'm going to call a *bit* of bullshit on this poll.  The poll was done primarily over the phone in a span of 3 days and only had 1,156 respondents.  That's supposed to be indicative of the nearly 330 million people in this nation?  Don't get me wrong, I really don't like Trump, but are we honestly going to sit here and just lap this up?  They polled 0.00035% of the population and think that's accurate to the entire country."

shittymoviedetails,ff3dwoo,t1_ff3ca2m,1579539130.0,"TLJ has its problems, but I actually really like it for what it tries to do.  I think if Rian Johnson had full control of the Sequel Trilogy he could have made something actually great.  He stripped a lot of the fat leftover from TFA and broke the series because he knew it wasn't going to work unless we had a huge reality shift.  We couldn't just have the OT again and we couldn't have the same reveals as Empire.  Who are Rey's parents?  They're nobody, they never were anybody.  Rey is the symbol that the Force can manifest in anyone, you don't have to be from a powerful family or have a great father in order to be strong.  Who is right and who is wrong when it comes to supporting the Resistance or the First Order?  Well there's no right or wrong answer because these MIC tycoons support both sides for more profit.  Is Rose a bad character?  No, she's idealist meant to ground Finn and us by letting him see the flaws in blind devotion.  Is Snoke anyone important?  Maybe, but who really cares now because he's dead.  He was simply a staircase for Kylo Ren to climb in order to achieve greater power."

shittymoviedetails,ff35myw,t1_ff2ohi1,1579534249.0,"I'm fine with TFA being a recreation of A New Hope, but at least change up the details a bit.  The movie opens with the rebels receiving vital intel that need to make it back to HQ.  The character we will follow is captured and sends the intel out in a *desert planet* to meet the main character while they are interrogated.  The main character meets the dome headed droid with the intel and decides to escape the desert planet to deliver it with the help of Han Solo and the Millenium Falcon... Literal plot points and settings are ripped only just with the names changed.  You can pay homage to the original without copying it nearly word for word."

shittymoviedetails,ff35atm,t1_ff2ub8o,1579534023.0,"Just because it's \been nominated for various awards doesn't make it good.  Think about it though.  From now on, any post ST movie will have to deal with the fact that the First Order existed, that Palpatine came back to life out of literally nowhere and so many other bullshit plot threads."
shittymoviedetails,ff2dn03,t3_er5r3y,1579501874.0,"Rise of Skywalker pretty much cemented that JJ Abrams can't really make movies anymore.  His stories, simultaneously, have so many holes and unresolved threads in them.  TFA wasn't just a ripoff of A New Hope, it was practically plagiarism.  I get wanting to draw parallels to the OT, but it's almost like he just took Lucas's outline of A New Hope and used that for TFA.

What a fucking shitstain on the Star Wars legacy.  He had a chance to deliver the first great Star Wars movie in decades and he threw it all away and destroyed a franchise that now has to either exist primarily *pre* TFA or entirely as a prequel series."
