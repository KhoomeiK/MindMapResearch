Constantly pointing out their perceived age, that they were “cougars”. Acting like your stereotype about Asian women is a fact, I.e. “for those who’s might not know”.

“I overestimated my white to Asian age guessing ratio” (What the fuck? Who says that?) 

Your entire story could have been explained in one paragraph by simply saying “TIFU by guessing my date’s age as 10 years older than what she was.” But instead you added a bunch of unnecessary details so you could unwittingly flaunt your closet-racism and shamelessly notate how hot they were, as if that matters at all."
