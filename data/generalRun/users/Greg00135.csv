NFA,fgq2j6s,t1_fgq2gcv,1581016649.0,Thanks!
NFA,fgq0si9,t3_ezwpa6,1581015700.0,What you got there? That is a pretty sweet setup and I might want to clone it?
progun,fgpqm48,t1_fgp23tp,1581010098.0,Hey there fellow Okie! I would say all is welcome but to keep the policies that they a fleaing from there.
oklahoma,fgpq0o5,t1_fgpmsgu,1581009765.0,"Truth, I often find myself starting a comment then discarding it thinking it is not worth it."
AskAnAmerican,fgjkdd0,t1_fgjk4gt,1580845842.0,Truthfully both parties need to really split up.
htpc,fgfx4ad,t1_fgfv405,1580749517.0,"Sorry misread that, however the 4K FireStick support Dolby Vision and Atmos (Dobly Digital Plus not TrueHD) and it should work with your own media depending on how you serve it up. I don't have Atmos but I have read plenty of people using Atmos on FireStick or Cubes through Plex or Kodi."
htpc,fgfs3y6,t1_fgfffl6,1580746367.0,The 2019 shields support Dolby Vision. Atmos should work with your own media. How as are you playing the Atmos files?

AskAnAmerican,fgd3gd7,t3_extay2,1580678593.0,Love me a good fish fry (often with catfish). It is very common in Oklahoma. I do prefer caught fish over farmed catfish though.
AmItheAsshole,fg186db,t1_fg17duq,1580422575.0,"From what I remember when it was in the news a while back ago you had to make under a certain amount. Might hit up your state labor board and see what the rules are, you company might be breaking them or don't know what they are supposed to be."
AmItheAsshole,fg0qrhl,t1_fg00e7k,1580413182.0,Depending on how much you make salary they do have to pay over time still. I also don't remember if it state specific or nationally so ymmv.
ShieldAndroidTV,ffz0uzm,t1_ffyf9a3,1580360381.0,Sorry I wasn't able to find anything.
AskAnAmerican,ffx76ib,t1_ffx5fs0,1580319174.0,"I mean we could use the military budget to make us energy independent but building cleaner resources such as Wind, Solar, and Nuclear. Maybe use them to secure water ways and clean them up as needed.

As for universal health are and basic income I just have reservations for it and don't know if I can ever get on board with it. I would rather just see more manufacturing to come back to the US and give more people jobs making better quality products for them to turn around and buy. Just giving more people won't really help, they would just buy more cheap crap instead investing in fewer better quality things. If people have the option between one really high quality expensive dohicky that can do a lot or a bunch of different cheaper disposable dohickies they will most likely go for the cheaper disposable stuff because they can go ""look at all of my cool things""."
ShieldAndroidTV,ffx5ne1,t3_evo2o2,1580318265.0,"I havent messed with it on my Shield Tube but I know on the FireTv in the Netflix App and Prime Videos I could change it from DD+ to DD so I imagine you might be able to do it there in the app om the Shield.

Edit: I will test tonight and see what I can find."

progun,feegvps,t1_feec0q6,1579033500.0,The comment history screams of a troll account. They either are just trolling to get a laugh or they have some issues they need to sort out and possibly some growing up to do.

ar15,fdldz7v,t1_fdl8iuq,1578521983.0,Helps a little bit with heat build up too and if you are at all concerned with lead poisoning it can help a little bit with that. (watched a Garand Thumb video on lead poisoning for people with high round counts during frequent range trips).
