If you’re staring 20k in the face and still considering staying at a “non-traditional agency” that you are trying to find a way out of. They have their hooks in you. You don’t owe them anything and in the grand scheme of things they don’t care about you and you’ll leave eventually one way or another (your bosses will too), everyone does. In my experience all sides of the business value the experience you gain from the others because it’s what they lack. I’ve had publishers not beating down my door so to speak but A couple of times a week because they know I survived agency life. They know I can work like a machine day in and day out but guess what? I don’t want to do that for ever and ever and be underpaid so they can eek out better margins. It’s your life, make it work for you. I’m sorry if that was super blunt but I’ve been in your exact position and regret not taking the pub side job tremendously."
science,fefun3w,t1_fedr3su,1579065737.0,I would hypothesis that whatever chemical the wasp is secreting in to the spider more simply manipulates the density of the webs they weave rather than manipulating the actual web pattern in any way. We definitely need to see more webs. Maybe these wasps target a specific type of spider that already weaves a geometrically ideal style of web and they just manipulate how the spider moves when it weaves the same web it always does.

No REAL practical skill to develop aside from “management experience”. Everything you do is to become more efficient or to automate a process. Effectively you’re digging your own professional grave. Management styles change, organizational structure changes, companies try new things when the normal day to day isn’t enough and this new thing might mean less of you. I’ve found the best things you can do are get excited about your clients goals (you have to remember, they’re advertising to achieve something else, I think too many of us forget that) and be kind to others. Build you social network. Care a lot and a little at the same time (well put [u/the_kanamit](reddit.com/u/the_kanamit)), don’t make it personal. Go home and do something you love. For the love of (insert vessel for good fortune here) fight for your work life balance, not everyone has sold their soul to their pay check.

advertising,feiv3rj,t3_ep5ws7,1579148024.0,This is a very thought provoking question. Although I donâ€™t have a concrete answer I implore you to continue challenging the status quote in this fashion. Your future clients will respect you for asking these types of questions especially since this is a very real consideration. Have you considered strategy?

advertising,fehpoz5,t3_ep39zm,1579121391.0,"After reading only the first 3 or 4 sentences of your post I could already tell that itâ€™s time for you to try something else. If youâ€™re staring 20k in the face and still considering staying at a â€œnon-traditional agencyâ€ that you are trying to find a way out of. They have their hooks in you. You donâ€™t owe them anything and in the grand scheme of things they donâ€™t care about you and youâ€™ll leave eventually one way or another (your bosses will too), everyone does. In my experience all sides of the business value the experience you gain from the others because itâ€™s what they lack. Iâ€™ve had publishers not beating down my door so to speak but A couple of times a week because they know I survived agency life. They know I can work like a machine day in and day out but guess what? I donâ€™t want to do that for ever and ever and be underpaid so they can eek out better margins. Itâ€™s your life, make it work for you. Iâ€™m sorry if that was super blunt but Iâ€™ve been in your exact position and regret not taking the pub side job tremendously."
science,fefun3w,t1_fedr3su,1579065737.0,I would hypothesis that whatever chemical the wasp is secreting in to the spider more simply manipulates the density of the webs they weave rather than manipulating the actual web pattern in any way. We definitely need to see more webs. Maybe these wasps target a specific type of spider that already weaves a geometrically ideal style of web and they just manipulate how the spider moves when it weaves the same web it always does.

advertising,fe970vt,t1_fe68u50,1578934974.0,"Ugh, this 1000 times over. Imagine the other side of the isle per se (management side chiming in). Youâ€™re a PM or an AM or even a Director/VP. No REAL practical skill to develop aside from â€œmanagement experienceâ€. Everything you do is to become more efficient or to automate a process. Effectively youâ€™re digging your own professional grave. Management styles change, organizational structure changes, companies try new things when the normal day to day isnâ€™t enough and this new thing might mean less of you. Iâ€™ve found the best things you can do are get excited about your clients goals (you have to remember, theyâ€™re advertising to achieve something else, I think too many of us forget that) and be kind to others. Build you social network. Care a lot and a little at the same time (well put [u/the_kanamit](reddit.com/u/the_kanamit)), donâ€™t make it personal. Go home and do something you love. For the love of (insert vessel for good fortune here) fight for your work life balance, not everyone has sold their soul to their pay check. And most importantly (thanks [u/bongozap](reddit.com/u/bongozap)...

Itâ€™s just fucking advertising."
