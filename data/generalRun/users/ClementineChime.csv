They own the geese management company, which isn't a secret since it's their username and profile description, but they have no affiliation with the harness company. They've posted good stuff to the sub in the past and they contribute to the discussion. They don't just spam posts and then leave. There's no upvote bots. But yes, since they own the geese company you could call anything they post about it online an ad. And that's fine as far as DogsWithJobs goes. They want to share their working dog to the sub. One aspect of that dogs job is being carried up to a roof. Pretty cool in my opinion. There's one guy who has a bed bug sniffing dog who posts to the sub. All sorts of different occupations.

>Title guidelines: If we cannot tell what the dogs job is by the pic/gif/video alone, the title must make it clear.

>For example, if you post a picture of a service dog without its vest on, you will need to specify in the title that it's a service dog. Otherwise, for all we know it's just a picture of a random pet dog. People shouldn't have to ask what the dogs job is. 

>Your title must be at least 18 characters long (spaces included). While not all short titles are bad, this is to ensure that descriptive titles are being used rather than low effort titles like ""Good boy"".

You will need to resubmit and mention somewhere in the title what the dogs job is."

HailCorporate,ff4bkam,t1_ff41tov,1579559775.0,"It's similar to Arnold Schwarzenegger or the /u/ SeeThroughCanoe account. Yea, some of their posts act as ads, but they're transparent about their relationship to the company or product. They participate in the discussion. They're not just spamming things. This is the geese accounts first post in 5 months. Before that they shared some cool videos of the dogs herding geese. One of them even won our 500,000 subscribers contest in /r/DogsWithJobs. I don't see the problem. I enjoy their posts."

>Honestly I just wanted people to know we weren’t just half hauling him up the ladder. This was his first time in the harness. I have no interest in promoting the harness. I couldn’t video roof and climb at same time but when there are birds on the roof I will get that with the go pro I think. I just thought it was a cool video of a working dog headed to work.

Makes sense to me to get ahead of it. People get angry about all sorts of things involving working dogs. Hunting dogs, police dogs, military dogs, even some service dog posts bring out angry people."
dogswithjobs,ff4a6nx,t1_ff3xfiw,1579558903.0,Most posts are pics of dogs. I think it's cool to see a video of a dog doing something related to its job.
dogswithjobs,ff47xgg,t1_ff45wrw,1579557490.0,"That's not what astroturfing is. You can call it an ad, but it's not astroturfing. They're transparent about their ownership of the geese control company. Again, it's their username. It's like Arnold Schwarzenegger sharing a trailer to /r/movies. Yea, it's an ad, but he's not hiding that. He shares something he's involved in and participates in the discussion. I don't see the problem. Or take /u/ SeeThroughCanoe. The company is his username and it's in his account description, but he shares really cool things so who cares. 

They explained the reason for including the harness name. Makes sense to me."
dogswithjobs,ff45iln,t1_ff44pyv,1579555996.0,It's their username. They're not hiding that it's their geese management company. They've posted good videos here in the past. People are allowed to show off their work.
