According to the original story creator 

George Lucas in 2008: “I get asked all the time, ‘What happens after “Return of the Jedi”?,’ and there really is no answer for that,” he said. “The movies were the story of Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker, and when Luke saves the galaxy and redeems his father, that’s where that story ends.

For example Digital books unusually require a login or internet access to view the material.  This equals more work on the end user / consumer side -> less value

Digital books typically are priced year to year making them in many ways more expensive ... forced into “latest” edition and essentially renting them year to year.  With a physical text book you can reuse the book for a few school years.

With a digital textbook the material could simply be emailed as a pdf ... this would mean no shipping costs,  no binding or printing costs,  no packaging cost,  no logistics.  IMO there is price saving here that could be passed to the consumer.

Because the engines are further forward, the lift tends to push the nose up — causing the angle of attack to increase further. This reinforces itself and results in a pitch-up tendency which if not corrected can result in a stall. This is called an unstable or divergent condition. It should be noted that many high performance aircraft have this tendency but it is not acceptable in transport category aircraft [emphasis mine] where there is a requirement that the aircraft is stable and returns to a steady condition if no forces are applied to the controls.“"

To keep up with newer more efficient Airbus jets ... Boeing decided to outfit more energy efficient engines on its existing 737 design.  Unfortunately the engines are too large and so the engines had to be moved on the wing way to the front.

Here is the problem, with the new engine positions the 737 max no longer flies as smooth and its nose constantly pitches upwards when at an incline like takeoff.  To counteract this problem Boeing put in a sensor that constantly monitors the nose and keeps adjusting the trim automatically to keep the flight stable and nose down to prevent stalling at takeoff.

This plane will always be dependent on a computerized system to adjust pitch since it simply does not fly well, especially during takeoff.  The cause of both crashed has been attributed to this pitch correction system.

I read your comment you linked however I fail to see a notable cause for concern.  Not sure population growth due to migration is necessarily as advantageous as some may think.  If the US needs more people It can look at boosting natural birth rates like we have seen In Denmark and to some extent in Russia.

The number one barrier to US citizens reproducing is economic uncertainty and economic stress.  If the government decides to take a pro procreation stance through tax incentives, media outlets, and government programs I think that many current US citizens would have little trouble procreating.  Further such an government effort to support current US citizen family building efforts may help strengthen people’s perception of government.

macsysadmin,fc79u0y,t1_fc71y60,1577501346.0,"I agree with you that with managing Apple machines you have way less issues and it is much easier and hands off than say a PC.  I would just add a that IMO the T2 security chip, and JAMF / MDM product really have no bearing on this.  Deploying via an image and running High Sierra or Mojave = smooth running / or via a MDM."
macsysadmin,fc6zj0i,t3_eg7uzb,1577493544.0,"Unfortunately Apple has positioned its computer lineup away from imaging and now focuses on enrolling in a MDM setup.  This new approach has some limitations and takes a bit more setup or expense if you opt to go third party like JAMF.   

On this forum and others you will hear lots of comments on “imaging is dead” etc.  The future of device imaging does indeed look bleak however I think is important to hold Apple to account here. 

Is enrolling devices in apple school manager and then using a third party subscription based service a technological improvement?   Does this new method increase apples product value or total cost of ownership?

Apple has a history a back and forth history of providing value and other times taking product value away.  I would argue that the T2 chip for example takes more value away then adding value by “protecting” the computer.   Was their ever a problem with filevault and Apple? I mean what is the T2 chip securing us from?   .... well it now prevents a user from replacing their own hard drive (and do other self repairs) or cloning their drive from one to another and swapping it in the machine.  For example:  Let’s say as a macadmin the boss of your company comes in and has spilled coffee on his new machine.  Prior to the T2 chip you could open the coffee ruined machine and simply swap the hard drive into an similar model computer and .... whaa lah your boss is back in action on 10-15 minutes with no data loss.  With the  T2 chip ... you can see if your boss backed up his info via iCloud to or perhaps used time machine... yes these are good ideas and work however it is still a LOSS of value that you cannot simply swap the drive yourself.  

Back to imaging ... this is not a OK boomer thing or a I hate change moment ... it’s just let’s be honest not everything Apple does is Progress or provides a better value or necessarily an improved way of doing things.  Apple is very good at making money and they are looking to lock down their devices l... assert more control ... and push more subscription based services ... and try to incentivize users to use Apple care.  

I manage over 600 devices with this profile manager and am enrolled and actively use Apple school manager.  Just saying let’s not be pushovers and just passively agree with all apples moves like they are perfect and without at times fault. 

I mean look at Catalina ... to use a signature feature of the new OS .. sidecar you must tie devices together through an iCloud account ... almost like they are more and more forcefully nudging customers to use a cloud based account.  Or look at how they pushed Catalina as a system update ? Think about it for the first time they just listed Catalina as a system update in system preferences (not just App Store) ... system updates.  Yes you can ignores the update but again Apple should be called out here for kind of recklessly pushing a new OS as an “update” one that has lots of compatibility issues with legacy software. 

Sorry for the bit of a rant and yes MDM is the best way forward.  Just saying Apple may be looking to nickel and dime it’s user base a little bit and at least should be called out for it."
StarWars,fc3spz8,t3_efn6km,1577397657.0,"I think this snippet of a user review really sums up the movie.  It’s simply not a good story...

“Fast forward to today, the effects and production moved on in such ways that anything can be visualised in pixel perfect quality. Anything but a badly written story -- no amount of wizardry in production can make uninteresting characters alive, confusing and meaningless plot lines interesting to watch. It is funny how the very expensive CGI that is basically expected and can be achieved through high enough budget to pay for all the high tech necesary while no amount of money can guarantee a well crafted story which is as low tech as pen and paper. Bottom line -- not worth a movie ticket. Looking forward to start anew with someone graduating from Pixar.“"
