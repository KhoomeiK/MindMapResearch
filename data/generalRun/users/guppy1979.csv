Husband and I never tired of TYP; we have re-watched ""Deadwood"" more times than we can count; truly enjoyed the slow burn of ""True Detective"" (season 1); anything truly well done deserves a re-watch for us because of the hidden cues in dialog and cinematography. Currently looking forward to my next re-watch of ""Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" because the Coen brothers always pack a whole bunch of cultural easter eggs in their stories.

Sourdough,ffhahho,t1_ffha2a3,1579927906.0,Tested my oven yesterday and found it was doing the same -- running 25 degrees cooler than my required setting. As before: many variables running around in Duder's mind. Lots of strands in old Duder's head.
Sourdough,ffh91ok,t1_ffh7tva,1579926614.0,"Thanks! Will definitely do this next time.

I have adhered to the advice of preheating the oven for at least an hour, but did not pre-heat the pot, the Dutch Oven (DO).

Avoided it because my old Dutch Oven was missing the handle on top to make for easy removal (not blaming husband who dropped it and broke it five years ago, but, just saying, that's how that happened . . . ) And two days ago he came home from the hardware store (where he had been searching for some sink faucet plumbing supplies) with a new handle and screwed it onto the cover of the DO.

I think I have a lot of variables not working in my favor in this endeavor -- coldish kitchen in the American Midwest, no real warm, safe place to keep it, unsure about the ratios of spelt or AP or bread flour. Still experimenting and trying to be patient.

Common knowledge seems to be to heat up the DO, but I also read that one can let it do its final rise there. Lack of bannetons and other vessels to let the bread rise in, I've been trying to make a way.

Way too much info for you! But I thank you for the response. Putting it all into the baffle-chamber of how to get my sourdough experience off the ground!

Thanks, again!"
Sourdough,ffh6mbj,t1_ffgl5s6,1579924562.0,"Looks fantastic. I've read conflicting reports about whether it is necessary to pre-heat the Dutch Oven before baking or not. Which approach was yours?

Gave my new starter a week and thought it was ready, but didn't perform very well in an unheated Dutch Oven. Considering many factors in my failures, but am still making an effort. 

Off to feed my new-ish starter in about an hour. Still struggling from the get-go, so would appreciate your details.

I dreaded an experience like being engaged and wryly amused by True Detective S1, only to suffer painfully through S2 waiting for it to improve.  I am already disappointed in The New Pope. I, too, will bear with it a little longer, but I won't stick around for total desecration!"

We, too, were enthralled by the first season and captivated by Jude Law's performance and delighted by the complexity with which mysticism was raised and explored. 

But John Malkovich? Suddenly I had my doubts about Season 2.

Malkovich has his highs and lows; he can amuse, but very often I find his attempts at linguistic flair and accents to be downright distracting from the story. Dunno what he's going for here -- I have only seen the trailers a time or two.

Hoping we don't have a Season 2 like Season 2 of ""True Detective.""  But I, too, am very much looking forward to the return of Jude Law; jury is still out on the return of Pious XIII, though!

Good summary, BTW. Thank you!"
