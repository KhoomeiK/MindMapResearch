nottheonion,ffm7p9k,t1_ffk3jvv,1580049928.0,Well they have to justify their existence somehow. Telling the review board that you were deployed X times over Y period and conveniently leaving out that most of the deployments were unnecessary gets you more money.
harrypotter,fflkgw3,t1_ffjtk6f,1580040755.0,"The you start to run into problems of ""showing off"" mentioned in GOF. Parents flying their kids in on a dragon or kids stealing a magic car to fly to school."
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ffjnyap,t3_etpx86,1580002644.0,The cat just nested on top of my yarn so now I'm having trouble making a 2nd ear for a bunny. I also had to snag my phone out from under her so I can post this.
tifu,ffh42zz,t3_etfjl9,1579922561.0,"Is there any way to add a patch or chain to the gate (like a bike chain if nothing else). Now that they know they can do it, weights might not be enough."
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ffgzh8o,t3_etk776,1579919062.0,Long week. The best bit was that work today was 100% overtime and I only had to deal with shitty coworker for about 4 hours the entire week.
TalesFromTheCustomer,ffgxlbp,t1_fffh2ny,1579917656.0,"I get terrible migraines from mushrooms. I have to be really careful at potlucks, I just auto avoid anything that looks like it might have cream of mushroom soup. The migraine builds slow enough that I can usually time it to when I need to go to sleep *now* or I'll get nauseous and throw up. I currently have a long enough commute that mushrooms at lunch and I might not make it home safely because light and noise can speed things up."
news,ffgs0ic,t1_ffgb0mt,1579913574.0,"The girls have no released info on abuse. It may just be because bio mom of the boys was willing to relay that to reporters and that there's no confirmed abuse yet for the girls so no public info for reporters to use. They may have avoided physical harm or had it less frequently but I wouldn't be shocked if it turns out there was other abuse such as mental abuse, grooming for sex, outright sexual abuse, etc."
AskReddit,ffgpz2t,t3_etbrdf,1579912103.0,"We had a cat that would knock on our kitchen window to be let in. We kept a picnic table leaned up against the house right under the window when it wasn't in use so he would climb it and tap tap tap. If we didn't hear him he would climb down one side until he could reach the dining room windows and tap louder there. It was pretty normal for someone to yell out ""Simon wants in"" if they couldn't get to the back door."
audiobooks,ffe5akp,t1_ffdso31,1579837072.0,They introduced Hermione in the first Harry Potter book and I couldn't get much past that. I could not stand the thought of that voice for 6 more books. Stephen Fry was much better. Shame I had to pirate them because they weren't available in US otherwise.
orphanblack,ffaxid2,t3_esc5mi,1579746783.0,"Art's partner is corrupt. The IA guy is corrupt and has a bunch of power. They're willing to murder and to frame clone allies for their end game. The clones and co don't know who they can trust to even go to in the first place. The lack of law enforcement starts out because Sarah is a criminal who doesn't want to get caught with a body who looks like her while impersonating someone else who also looks like her. They were trying to figure out what the hell is going on. Then shit got too bad to involve law enforcement (corrupt cops apparent, Felix being framed) especially when there's military and high level government ties to some of the stuff."
longhair,ffawdq9,t3_esik51,1579746030.0,"Plenty of people already mentioned water softeners so I won't bother much there but you said you're rural. If you're using well water, you might want to treat the well directly. My parents had terrible water, lots of rust, slightly sulfur smell, bad taste, etc and my dad tried a home treatment and their water has greatly improved, no more clogged faucets, less build up in tubs and toilets, they don't drink it though. There are also well treatment services that can be hired of you're worried about DIY."
trashy,ff7wwhw,t1_ff75a55,1579660290.0,I won't give to people in the streets because I can't tell if they're legitimate or not. I don't want to support assholes rather than actual people in need and I'm not made of money.
nursing,ff5rb5t,t1_ff5fjs5,1579607172.0,"Had a CNA that got really into crystal healing towards the end of my time at the facility. I'm pretty sure whatever she was trying to heal with crystals would have been fixed by losing 50 or so pounds, but I'm sure the crystals in her pocket did absolutely nothing besides let everyone know when she was coming down the hall and wear holes in her scrubs."
aww,ff4jk3k,t3_erdfrg,1579565174.0,"Kittens have cute turned up x1000 so non cat people will be fooled by this particular mini specimen. By the time the true catness appears, it's too late and the kitten has a new slave."
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,feos8f0,t3_eq11gg,1579304700.0,"5 minutes ago I gave the cat catnip. 1 minute ago, she fell off the cat tree. She's fine, she's currently chewing the loose bits of the scratching post in retaliation."
AskReddit,feopmfc,t1_fen1kkt,1579303596.0,I'm ambi but I just had a realization that I probably sweep/mop Lefty.
funny,feo2f8x,t3_ept003,1579294171.0,"Several years ago at Thanksgiving or Christmas at my parents, mom got some of the serving dishes out of the china cabinet. An hour or two later I stepped over to grab something off one of the shelves and *bang* the lower door opens there's a full 5 second pause then out saunters my sisters cat. She had ninja'd inside while the door was open briefly then came out theatrically after her nap. I nearly jumped out of my skin."

MaliciousCompliance,fellhby,t1_fejnege,1579225018.0,"My brother just used to break my bikes. I thought I was safe at 14, he was 17 and had a car so I got a new bike one summer and 2 weeks later it disappears for an afternoon and returns with both handle grips twisted off and a brake out."
atheism,fejhtov,t1_feh73r3,1579174899.0,They also leave out that not every kid is as desirable for adopting couples. Most people want a newborn that is the same race as them and who has no known health problems. Baby born with a heart defect or born premature and has health issues? Much less wanted. Baby born to addict? Much less wanted. Baby has prominent birth mark or a defect? Much less wanted. Baby not a white male? Usually not as wanted.
antiMLM,fejgmb7,t1_feiffcp,1579173306.0,At least some of them try to hide their despicableness by messaging their condolences them waiting a few hours or even days before trying to make a sale.

nottheonion,fegqfw7,t1_fegmckb,1579100110.0,"I'm repulsed by lice and fleas. I like well groomed beards though. The duck dynasty look is repulsive to me though, no matter how attractive the man is, long beards the look like they've never been conditioned are really off-putting."
AskReddit,feb5pey,t3_eo6l00,1578955688.0,"Three years ahead of me was this 8th grade boy who had long hair. The school pulls out the rule book one day and decides that he must cut his hair to comply with some rule or other. The kid asks for a copy of the rule book and pours over it. He got his haircut but a few weeks later he had started work on a pretty epic beard. There was no rule against facial hair, plus how many 13ish year olds could manage that? The rulebook was revised the following year (no more haircut rules)  but that kid kept his beard, saw him a few months ago (he'd be 33 or so) while I don't like the long unkempt beard look, I gotta admire his resolve."
fatlogic,fe61owm,t1_fe4h1sd,1578879801.0,Smokers can be denied surgeries such as lung transplants and nerve/spinal surgeries. They're smokophobic too.
asl,fe3sxr2,t3_enq5k5,1578852602.0,"In my experience, most hearing kids will pick up talking just fine as soon as they can make themselves understood. There'll be a transition period where they combine the 2. My niece was taught some signs as an infant because she had a trach but she learned to talk around the trach and would say ""pop pop"" for popsicle and sign ""blue"" at the same time because she wanted a blue popsicle."
AskReddit,fe3n75h,t3_ennslu,1578850868.0,"Learn some life skills right away. Too many people go to college or move into their first apartment and don't know how to do laundry, that you need to vacuum/sweep, or to clean tubs/toilets/showers monthly at least. Also, change your sheets, at least weekly is best. Learn some basic cooking skills, you can't eat just every meal. Even if you're just following the directions on a box of seasoned rice, that's better than expecting to go to golden arches daily."
fatlogic,fe25of4,t1_fdz2nlj,1578834735.0,"The antiMLM sub has desensitized Me to emojis, I just read past them without registering that they're there or what they might be trying to add to the comment.

PastorArrested,fdw12l0,t1_fdvntb6,1578753956.0,"It's morally blameless for the rapist(s). The woman or girl who was raped is blamed, maimed and/or murdered for daring to be raped."
WTF,fdvzgbp,t1_fdvl6d0,1578753479.0,"Neti pot is wonderful for the ""throat is dry from mouth breathing all night despite the humidifier being on extra high"" feeling I always get. It soothes the area where post nasal drip irritates and relieves the sore throat from mouth breathing. Makes mornings with a cold a bit more bearable."
AskReddit,fdoxxpx,t1_fdofd39,1578615413.0,"I got bored at work and put googly eyes and a mustache sticker on our vitals cart. I came in the next day and he had a name tag, scarf, hat, and a few other accessories. They may still be there, I quit 2 years ago. I think the nursing home residents named him too."
