I go to a big box gym and a park district gym. At the park district People are so much more friendly and outgoing, and want advice. The big box gyms are so sterile and unfriendly (in my experience). Plus the park district gym doesn't rely on PT for as large a % of revenue so they would stop me if they thought I was taking payment, they don't care if I'm just helping out. But even they wouldn't openly cut a source of revenue. 

I wonder if there are any mom and pop gyms that would do this, though. If I had the money to burn I would. I also sort of wish I was an internet famous fitness personality, I'd give out my workout routines for free, I wouldn't want to charge like other fitness professionals

I hate it because I know what it takes to get abs, and for most people it isn't healthy, but for me being in incredible shape and spending hours at the gym I've had a visible 6 pack twice in my life. Once, the one I mentioned, the other when I was in pre-kidney failure and extreme hypercalcemia (when I was 19 I was big into lifting and I didn't like protein shakes or anything, so all my extra calories came from dairy because I thought that was healthy. Ate a quart of yogurt and drank a gallon of milk a day), where I couldn't eat anything and I would literally collapse at random times because it felt like someone was shredding my insides. I've broken my wrist, sliced a toe in half, pulled and torn muscles, boxed at heavyweight, so I'm no stranger to pain, but this was 10x worse than anything I'd ever dealt with. Oh and some of the people praising my body had witnessed my bouts of incapacitation. 

It drives me nuts that two of the most miserable points of my life, both if which I nearly literally died during, I was praised for my body.

So for me being that active is natural because A) way too much energy and exercise is a healthy outlet as opposed to the destructive things manic People often out their energy towards and B) I have 4-5 mores hours in a day than most people so all that exercise isn't costing me my social life or video game/reading time."

Everyone's body is a little different, but at 5'10 I was 12% bodyfat at 215. I was benching 415, squatting 600, and deadlifting 650. , Those are numbers you aren't going to find in the general population, and rarely even in the bodybuilding/powerlifting communities.

 And according to that guy I was 65 lbs lighter than him and had 26 lbs of fat compared to his 11. So he has 80 lbs more muscle than me, I guess. Do you work with the Mountain?

Also to put the 4k Cal's a day in perspective I was eating about 4.5k a day. To maintain my 12% bodyfat, I lifted 2 hours 5x a week, did 1 hour of jump rope/box jumps sets 2x a week, 12 3 minute rounds of boxing with sprints between rounds 2x, 2 hours floor hockey 2x, walked my dog 4 miles a day, hiked at least 10 miles once a week (usually longer and more times), walked an average of 5 miles during my workday, and on occasion played basketball, swam, played tennis, and cycled.

Fortunately I'm pretty well known in the local lifting community, and I'm an approachable guy, so a lot of guys just come ask me before they try anything new. The form and performance level of my gym has risen s lot I think in part to my sharing what I know.

Only one girl bothered to ask if I was ok, and she made me eat lunch with her for a few weeks. Probably saved my life while everyone else was praising my looks.

JRPG,ffft9j0,t1_fffqwfq,1579891309.0,"The canon doesn't matter now, unclear if it will in the future (whether they continue to make standalone main games and connect them only in Arena or Dancing or if there will be a game that eventually settles the lore remains to be seen).  It also does matter a bit as Makoto is seen in other games The Answer(even tho it's crap) is clearly built heavily in Yukari's feelings for him. 

Of the features, I'm a bit ambivalent. There's give and take. I wish the Maniac difficulty was in FES, but in P3P there are so many ways in which the game is easier that it's probably about equivalent to hard. I'm actually finding my P3P Maniac run absurdly easy compared to how I remember FES Hard being. The full party control, in my opinion, actually makes the game lose a bit of it's charm, and like I said turns it into a cakewalk (unfortunately it's too tempting to play on Direct Commands, I don't have the willpower not to haha). I liked the fatigue system. I don't feel any tension in Tartarus anymore, since I can zip back to the entrance and heal without losing progress, and I can grind infinitely without fear of getting tired. They might as well have removed the status system, because there's no detriment to grinding all in one day and not worrying about tiredness. If anything its a benefit because if free courage stat ups.  I kinda miss having a system limit grinding (I never specifically grind but I'm a completionist and end up spending a lot of time trying to get more fusion fodder and hunt down the rare katanas). 

I do agree that it would be nice to have a new version. (I'd just like it on PS4 because I love FES but I can't find my PS2....) and that any remake should include FeMc. I just think the added features do not equate to what was lost via lack of 3D models and cutscenes, unless you really want to play FeMc. So if someone asks about P3 I recommend FES if they don't want to play FeMc, obviously recommend P3P if they do."

I've yet to encounter a turn based RPG that has remained consistently difficult and varied through the whole game. Usually after you have familiarized yourself with the system, 5-10 hours in, even the toughest learning curves are quickly broken. 

It's just not a very good system if you are looking for a challenge because there is no skill involved, and not enough variables (unlike SRPGs) to make the outcome unpredictable"

JRPG,fffn1f1,t3_etczhr,1579887481.0,"Not necessarily limited to JRPGs, but I want a very low fantasy SRPG where you play the career of a mercenary. And not like a world saving mercenary jumping at the call, just a regular ass mercenary.  During the course of the game you'd probably start as a regular Merc soldier and sign up with a company if your choice. As you continue on you might get promotions and become an officer. And maybe one day start your own Merc company.

 There's no central plot, youve just got several factions/kingdoms/countries and when you control your own company you decide how to run your company. Maybe you sign an exclusive contract with one faction, or maybe you are the type of Merc company who changes sides the moment a better offer is made. You age and live through a whole career, it's possible for you to get injured, even maimed, or die in combat. Gameplay could continue indefinitely so long as no one faction conquered the world, which would seldom happen even with player intervention. 

Also, there wouldn't be levels, so you'd never become a world destroying monster. You'd only be as good as your equipment, player skill (and fighting multiple opponents or renowned knights/foes solo would be impossible for most players even with the best equipment), and tactical ability.

Persona5,ffdd11h,t3_et01ny,1579818297.0,"Playing armchair psychologist is a dangerous game. I know this both working in mental health, and being mentally ill. I'll share a bit if my story at the end, but for Futaba it's really, really difficult to actually say she'd be on the spectrum because A) we just don't really know much about her and B) she had a very traumatic childhood, ever before her mother's incident, and so she was withdrawn from society since elementary school. 

We can also see where several instances disordered behaviors/symptoms are alleviated. First of all the auditory hallucinations. They would normally imply some psychotic disorder, like schizophrenia or bipolar, but that they clear up so quickly is evidence that her issues are at least in part situational and not chemical. Admittedly you could argue that having your heart stolen is actually just curing mental illness (it's possible Futaba WAS actually schizoaffective and getting rid of her psychosis allowed her to think about her mom normally, and not the other way around. And you could argue that the others were sociopaths who came clean because their sociopathy was cured). But she also overcomes her crippling social anxiety in a span of a couple months. Highly unlikely for someone on the spectrum. She does have some extraordinary abilities, but remember this is not only an RPG, but a JRPG. They love to exaggerate intellectual abilities in fictional stories. Hyper intellectualism isn't limited to Savants in the real world either, though it is more common. 

There's just really not enough evidence to diagnose her in a limited time. Plus it's my understanding that autism is tricky to diagnose in highly functional individuals. I know I displayed a lot of autistic behaviors, but as my emotional, social, and intellectual development weren't impeded I went a long time before being evaluated. 

Then there's the fact that it requires knowing someone pretty well to diagnose them, drawing the line between chemically disordered behavior and normal behavior skewed by circumstances is hard. 

I'm schizoaffective, and also on the spectrum. When I meet new mental health professionals I have to spend hours convincing them that my (written) diagnosis is accurate since I do not show typical outward symptoms of either. When I checked myself into a mental hospital when I had my first psychotic break, the first 4-5 days (where you are monitored constantly) the staff kept asking what I was doing there. Near the end they understood. 

If you met me, you would never know I'm a Schizoaffective person with autism. I hold a steady job, I have a great number of friends, I'm very athletic and physically active, I go on dates regularly. You'd have no idea that I hallucinate a lot, sometimes I'm hallucinating while joking around, you wouldn't know I'm often manic and sleep 2 hours a night, you wouldn't know a lot im ways in which my mind is disordered, but it definitely is. Likewise, you'd think most murderers and other violent criminals are mentally ill, but most times they aren't."
Megaten,ffd9obn,t1_ffd8zmx,1579816165.0,"Yeah I enjoy the game but after the first palace it was just too easy (to be fair a lot if SMT games seem to have an early beef gate, then it's smooth sailing) and the characters are somehow worse despite getting a lot more development. 

P5 is a very pretty, fun entry, but it's also forgettable."
Megaten,ffd9g11,t1_ffd8vif,1579816028.0,"I think Persona 1 is done, caput, period. 

The best we could hope for is a P2 compilation. It's BS we got half the game originally then they only remade the other half. 

So if I don't want to play on an emulator or in Japanese I have to play one half original and one half remade, on different systems. 

But other than that there's not even a prayer of anything new coming from those games. Even a rerelease of P2 is a pipe dream."
