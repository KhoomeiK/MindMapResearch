Guildwars2,fdnjrwc,t1_fdmg4wz,1578587274.0,"I mean, +20 slot is 400 gems. which is 150 gold. So this is 150/20 = 7.5 gold per slot.

So if these bags are more than 240 gold. Than there aren't any point in them.

But if they are less than that, then it will reduce the price of gems because most people won't buy gems for a while, they'll change their bag instead.

I have 7 bags of 20 place. I'm sure many as more than me.

So if you reduce the price of gems, less people will spend real money on gems which will reduce arena net income.

I'm not saying I ain't for the idea, but I highly doubt they'll ever do it."
