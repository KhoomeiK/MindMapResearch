Borussia and Schalke are two football-clubs, and stinkt can be translated with either ""smells"" or ""sucks"".

So he essentially tried to name his kid ""Borussia Schalkesucks"" luckily this was stoped by the government."

AskReddit,fcx1c7i,t3_chtygy,1578046821.0,"We had this stupid ""Zero tolerance for fights policy"".

This was changed when one kids father sued the school. His son was standing there in his lunch break when without a reason some guy just came up to him and straight up punched him in the face. The boy immediately went down, and the attacker kept kicking him into his chest (again, without a reason). The boy desperately slapped against his legs, but it didn't help.

Before anyone could do anything, a teacher rushed to the scene, picked the boy of the ground, and dragged him and his attacker into the principals office. Mind you, the boy was crying and had bruises and an obviously broken nose, while his attacker didn't even have a cut and was grinning like a psychopath.

But as you probably guessed, both were expelled for fighting, no matter how many witnesses stated that the boy didn't even try to fight back expect slapping his legs when he was already on the ground.

So the father sued the school.
The attacker of the boy was then beaten up a lot, but after school.

Edit: a typo"

Anyway, one day there was a party, and that boy showed up. After some time, we all decided to play truth or dare. When it was Carls turn, he said ""truth"". One of his bullies then dared him to ""Go home and kill himself because nobody wants his shit face here""

So Carl did it out of sadness."
