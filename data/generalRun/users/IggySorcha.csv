First off, MAG was great. It always is. I've dropped other cons for MAG and it's one of the few things I will put my foot down with my boss to make sure I can go. Heck, my cosplay group had a chant over the weekend ""Fuck Otakon"" because MAG clearly cares so much more about taking care of their attendees whereas Otakon keeps putting in more rules that are barriers to lower income or disabled attendees. 

I've commented in several places on here, but shoutout to the **Museum** especially. Also the **Petting Zoo**, which I missed and was so upset to not be able to make it, but I love that it is a thing and hope to make it next year. I also loved that there were 101 events for people wanting to try out Jam but uncomfortable doing so, and made it to my first Jam session there and loved it! Another shoutout to **Accessibility** because ya'll are awesome and don't get enough love. Last positive note, the fact that you do both *Elephant at the Con* and the *illness survey* to keep improving (and Elephant listened to my advice for improving their survey) is so great. 

My quick additions from my other comments in here:

**Concert hall**-- I know finances and limitations by the hotel are a big barrier for improving the sound quality, but is there anything that can be done? A fundraiser specifically for people who want to contribute to the system so ticket prices don't have to increase? A call for off-season volunteers to advise and design something better? Also, how about some pre-recorded transition music between the bands to satisfy the people who can't stand the break between concerts? I saw at least one person in here asking for the double stage back and that is the literal worst idea with regards to sound quality-- I have an audiophile friend (who I'm trying to convince to volunteer) who literally wouldn't set foot in the concert hall until you made it one stage because the sound was so bad back then. 

**Museum** Interpretive panels in front of each museum ""exhibit"" entrance, with a QR code for a website people can go to learn more about individual games/systems. Have at least one copy in each room of this info as well for people who don't want to look on their phones. I would gladly volunteer off-season hours to this as a museum professional."

IDontWorkHereLady,ff6m3pb,t3_erq9dr,1579630115.0,"Oh man. I'm seething for you and every other teacher out there. I've been teaching for close to 2 decades now, have a higher education degree in education, almost enough psychology training to have another degree in it, and have worked with every demographic from early childhood through adult. That woman hit ALL the nerves with that bullshit about not knowing anything about children if you don't have children (fuck us who can't have children, right?), or about early childhood educators (who I give major props to, I don't have the energy for that long-term) not being real teachers, or about teachers being glorified babysitters. 

I've met CHILDREN who would be better parents than some parents. Heck there's children, myself then included, who parent their own parents). Most teachers go through years of studying cognitive development and psychology before they set foot around children so that they can know best practices in dealing with children to ensure they learn efficiently and come out into adulthood prepared for life, whereas few people even bother to take the free crash course parenting classes at hospitals or community centers before their first child. If the child is lucky, the parent has gotten a whole of one book (that may or may not be vetted) to use as a guideline. So many parents' favorite thing to tell each other to make them feel better about screwing up is ""no one knows how to raise kids we just have to do the best we can"". Fucking no-- teachers may not know everything but they sure can provide a lot of guidance on what's best that those same parents usually override, if they even bother to get advice. The best part about these people is they're also usually the ones who do totally inappropriate things that teachers know are actually harmful and traumatizing, and when you try to show them evidence to help steer them in a different direction you get shit like ""you have no right to tell me what to do with my kids, my parents did that too and I turned out fine!"" No you did not ""turn out fine,"" Karen, if you did you wouldn't want your kids to suffer just because you did. (looking at you, parents who still use corporal punishment)

To those people: If you think teaching is so easy, let's see you do it including writing the lesson plan, the pre and post tests, and managing the classroom. I'll even let it be easy mode where you can pick a topic you are totally comfortable with. If teachers were glorified babysitters, we'd get paid more than a babysitter. When someone calls me a glorified babysitter, I have to work so hard not to get fired because I just want to turn around to them, ""Ok, so if that's what I am it's $20 per hour, per child. That'll be $600 per hour if I'm to keep doing my job"". And don't you dare accuse me of not doing my job when your shitty kid is struggling or acting out in the same shitty way you do.

The cremes are really good if you're just doing the face only (and We Love Colors has great bodysuits and even matches them to paint suggestions, usually Mehron, if you want to go full cosplay). The other benefit to the cremes is you can do powder shadow, etc right over the creme for shading and it'll act as a primer. Also another thing that could really make this pop if you want to do this as a cosplay (and aren't just goofing around at home bc its fun) is to do the leaf pressed against your face, put a bit of latex at the seam to blend, then fade the skin and leaf together (walking around that leaf is going to get hit by the wig and going to get annoying fast as well as maybe pull off).

aww,ff309nd,t1_ff2ugye,1579530187.0,"> Neutering is actually pretty uncommon outside of North America.

That's not true for many countries, but regardless, letting dogs run loose in the streets is also common in many parts of the world. Usually those same parts that don't neuter. Those animals often have poor health, suffer abuse by strangers, and they breed like crazy resulting in feral dogs everywhere. Just because it's common somewhere doesn't make it a good thing to do.

>Neutering several large breeds has been shown to dramatically increase (like 5x) the risk of hip dysplasia and other medical issues

You're only partially accurate here. That is a conclusion based on a single University study of <800 dogs and only studied golden retrievers and labs. The study was also merely data collection from veterinary hospitals and so did not take into consideration the diet, activity, or genetic history of the dogs studied. All of which can impact hip dysplasia and other conditions examined in the study. Really all it showed was that there needs to be more research.

Neutering reduces unwanted animals, especially in case the dog ever escapes. In some dog parks you're not allowed to bring in an intact animal. It also reduces hormone levels to reduce aggression especially in males where hormones most commonly cause it. Lastly it overall has been shown to greatly improve lifespan, especially in purebreds (ironically least likely to be neutered) as domesticated species were made by a lot of inbreeding historically, so their chances of developing cancer are higher than with other species and the most common hard to treat cancers involve reproductive organs."

I'm always either denied immediately after the first interview or I'm second choice after the final interview. Most of the time they say it's to go with someone with more experience and I look the person up who got the position only to see they're much newer I'm their career and I definitely have more experience, but they look older (the rest of the time it's someone who is so overqualified they are making a lateral move even though the posting said they were looking to help someone grow in their career).

 I have had my resume inspected by multiple hiring managers/professional groups and they've also done mock interviews/screenings with me over the phone. It's not my resume or interview skills. I kick butt in phone interviews. My resume has in clear bullet points my management experience but because titles are not remotely consistent in my sector, places skim just my titles and reject me claiming I don't have management experience. I've literally been told my a hiring manager that when I walked in they were ready to kick me out because they thought I had lied on my resume because it wouldn't be possible for me to have such a long work history due to how young I looked, and they advised me to learn makeup styles that would age me. 

It's partially for these reasons I absolutely *despise* when someone tries to tell me I am ""lucky"" to be aging so slowly and should be more appreciative.

Heck, my cosplay group had a chant over the weekend ""Fuck Otakon"" because MAG clearly cares so much more about taking care of their attendees whereas Otakon keeps putting in more rules that are barriers to lower income or disabled attendees. 

I've commented in several places on here, but shoutout to the **Museum** especially. Also the **Petting Zoo**, which I missed and was so upset to not be able to make it, but I love that it is a thing and hope to make it next year. I also loved that there were 101 events for people wanting to try out Jam but uncomfortable doing so, and made it to my first Jam session there and loved it! Another shoutout to **Accessibility** because ya'll are awesome and don't get enough love. I'm one of the advisors in Slack and it is so great how much you do and how quickly you (pardon the pun) adapt. Last positive note, the fact that you do both *Elephant at the Con* and the *illness survey* to keep improving (and Elephant listened to my advice for improving their survey) is so great. 

My quick additions from my other comments in here:

**Concert hall**-- I know finances and limitations by the hotel are a big barrier for improving the sound quality, but is there anything that can be done? A fundraiser specifically for people who want to contribute to the system so ticket prices don't have to increase? A call for off-season volunteers to advise and design something better? Also, how about some pre-recorded transition music between the bands to satisfy the people who can't stand the break between concerts? I saw at least one person in here asking for the double stage back and that is the literal worst idea with regards to sound quality-- I have an audiophile friend (who I'm trying to convince to volunteer) who literally wouldn't set foot in the concert hall until you made it one stage because the sound was so bad back then. 

**Museum** Interpretive panels in front of each museum ""exhibit"" entrance, with a QR code for a website people can go to learn more about individual games/systems. Have at least one copy in each room of this info as well for people who don't want to look on their phones. I would gladly volunteer off-season hours to this as a museum professional."

IDontWorkHereLady,ff6m3pb,t3_erq9dr,1579630115.0,"Oh man. I'm seething for you and every other teacher out there. I've been teaching for close to 2 decades now, have a higher education degree in education, almost enough psychology training to have another degree in it, and have worked with every demographic from early childhood through adult. That woman hit ALL the nerves with that bullshit about not knowing anything about children if you don't have children (fuck us who can't have children, right?), or about early childhood educators (who I give major props to, I don't have the energy for that long-term) not being real teachers, or about teachers being glorified babysitters. 

I've met CHILDREN who would be better parents than some parents. Heck there's children, myself then included, who parent their own parents). Most teachers go through years of studying cognitive development and psychology before they set foot around children so that they can know best practices in dealing with children to ensure they learn efficiently and come out into adulthood prepared for life, whereas few people even bother to take the free crash course parenting classes at hospitals or community centers before their first child. If the child is lucky, the parent has gotten a whole of one book (that may or may not be vetted) to use as a guideline. So many parents' favorite thing to tell each other to make them feel better about screwing up is ""no one knows how to raise kids we just have to do the best we can"". Fucking no-- teachers may not know everything but they sure can provide a lot of guidance on what's best that those same parents usually override, if they even bother to get advice. The best part about these people is they're also usually the ones who do totally inappropriate things that teachers know are actually harmful and traumatizing, and when you try to show them evidence to help steer them in a different direction you get shit like ""you have no right to tell me what to do with my kids, my parents did that too and I turned out fine!"" No you did not ""turn out fine,"" Karen, if you did you wouldn't want your kids to suffer just because you did. (looking at you, parents who still use corporal punishment)

To those people: If you think teaching is so easy, let's see you do it including writing the lesson plan, the pre and post tests, and managing the classroom. I'll even let it be easy mode where you can pick a topic you are totally comfortable with. If teachers were glorified babysitters, we'd get paid more than a babysitter. When someone calls me a glorified babysitter, I have to work so hard not to get fired because I just want to turn around to them, ""Ok, so if that's what I am it's $20 per hour, per child. That'll be $600 per hour if I'm to keep doing my job"". And don't you dare accuse me of not doing my job when your shitty kid is struggling or acting out in the same shitty way you do.

The cremes are really good if you're just doing the face only (and We Love Colors has great bodysuits and even matches them to paint suggestions, usually Mehron, if you want to go full cosplay). The other benefit to the cremes is you can do powder shadow, etc right over the creme for shading and it'll act as a primer. Also another thing that could really make this pop if you want to do this as a cosplay (and aren't just goofing around at home bc its fun) is to do the leaf pressed against your face, put a bit of latex at the seam to blend, then fade the skin and leaf together (walking around that leaf is going to get hit by the wig and going to get annoying fast as well as maybe pull off).

That's not true for many countries, but regardless, letting dogs run loose in the streets is also common in many parts of the world. Usually those same parts that don't neuter. Those animals often have poor health, suffer abuse by strangers, and they breed like crazy resulting in feral dogs everywhere. Just because it's common somewhere doesn't make it a good thing to do.

>Neutering several large breeds has been shown to dramatically increase (like 5x) the risk of hip dysplasia and other medical issues

You're only partially accurate here. That is a conclusion based on a single University study of <800 dogs and only studied golden retrievers and labs. The study was also merely data collection from veterinary hospitals and so did not take into consideration the diet, activity, or genetic history of the dogs studied. All of which can impact hip dysplasia and other conditions examined in the study. Really all it showed was that there needs to be more research.

Neutering reduces unwanted animals, especially in case the dog ever escapes. In some dog parks you're not allowed to bring in an intact animal. It also reduces hormone levels to reduce aggression especially in males where hormones most commonly cause it. Lastly it overall has been shown to greatly improve lifespan, especially in purebreds (ironically least likely to be neutered) as domesticated species were made by a lot of inbreeding historically, so their chances of developing cancer are higher than with other species and the most common hard to treat cancers involve reproductive organs."

I am not an expert, just an ex Catholic, but perhaps if there were to be some sort of clause to prevent defrocking in extenuating circumstances, such as ""if the priest has observed/reason to believe the confessor is not truly sorry for their sins/intends to commit them in perpetuity."" that would allow people to still feel comfortable confessing mortal sins assuming they truly are remorseful and not serial murderers/rapists.

I'm always either denied immediately after the first interview or I'm second choice after the final interview.

 I have had my resume inspected by multiple hiring managers/professional groups and they've also done mock interviews/screenings with me over the phone. It's not my resume or interview skills. I kick butt in phone interviews. My resume has in clear bullet points my management experience but because titles are not remotely consistent in my sector, places skim just my titles and reject me claiming I don't have management experience. I've literally been told my a hiring manager that when I walked in they were ready to kick me out because they thought I had lied on my resume because it wouldn't be possible for me to have such a long work history due to how young I looked, and they advised me to learn makeup styles that would age me. 

It's partially for these reasons I absolutely *despise* when someone tries to tell me I am ""lucky"" to be aging so slowly and should be more appreciative.
