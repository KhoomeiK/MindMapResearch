i could drink a single beer and go to class tomorrow and people could smell it on my breath.

the best bosses i’ve ever had, treated me as an equal. obviously they can just outright fire me, but if they value and listen to my input, i’d do anything for them. 

that’s why i hate to see people just try to dominate anybody they’re in charge of. if i’m wrong, they should feel able to tell me, and trust that i’ll do my best to adjust.

news,fgrkx93,t1_fgriyjs,1581049475.0,"i am currently studying law, that’s my qualifications. take em for what it’s worth, but here goes. 

what the article refers to is called the Garrity warning. it’s basically the miranda rights, but it extends to employment and internal affairs investigations. 

IA’s job is to investigate how suitable your employment is, as such the conduct it investigates is likely illegal. a supreme court case Garrity v. New Jersey (1967) found that an officer was compelled to make a statement to an internal affairs investigation or be fired. here,the supreme court found that officer garrity was being deprived of his 5th amendment rights. 

basically, you can’t be forced to testify in an internal affairs investigation, as what you state in an IA interview can be used to prosecute you. in a criminal investigation, you’re afforded the 5th amendment, and can choose to not say anything that may incriminate you. 

effectively, this just extends that right into a corporate proceeding. the aurora PD can still fire this officer if they so choose based on his silence, but he can’t be criminally prosecuted.



as a law student i hate to see the constitution used in such a way as to excuse misconduct like this. it’s enough to reconsider my pre-law major."
