I mean just logically speaking.... why take the egg out then put it back in just to shoot sperm inside her hoping it gets pregnant? The point is to fertilize the egg then put it back in so that you maximize your chance of pregnancy. Idk man. I really dont. I've just always assumed that's how it worked because that kinda makes sense. If you arent gonna fertalize the egg outside, just have the couple have sex."

Literally. Hes our president.
politics,fdp6pl4,t1_fdp6i3x,1578621279.0,Everyone knew the rules before the election happened. You cant be mad when you lose because you didnt focus on the right areas. Clinton ignored micigan. She lost it... I hate trump. But he won. And he does represent the country. If he didnt... solemani wouldnt be dead. We wouldnt be on the brink of war. And a bunch of other shit wouldnt have happened. So let everyone keep downvoting me because yall mofos dont wanna accept the fucking truth.
iamverysmart,fdp6cx3,t1_fdm404f,1578621046.0,Btw I was just curious so I googled it and figured I'd share. Wasnt trying to correct you.
iamverysmart,fdp68ru,t1_fdm6jv6,1578620969.0,Yep. Was interested so I googled it. Figured I'd share.
iamverysmart,fdp6673,t1_fdn5hop,1578620920.0,Ha kinda.
politics,fdp5ydu,t1_fdp5ffs,1578620772.0,"They do though.... he won. I dont like him either. But we cant say that his actions dont represent us. He won an election fair and square. They do represent us.

Edit: The rules of the election didnt change. Clinton knew exactly what she needed to do to win. She didnt. You people are in denial. I dont even like the fucking dude. I genuinely want him out. But you all are literally living in a fantasy world. He is literally our president and he is literally representing us to the world."
iamverysmart,fdm28y2,t1_fdlzohc,1578538080.0,Average is 85-115. Genius being 160. Mentally handicapped being 70 and below. The vast majority of the world sits at 100.
politics,fdixlcp,t1_fdix2xm,1578453343.0,You genuinely think iraq is gonna go to war with America when iran just killed 20 of their citizens? And we hand them a gob of cash? And build infrastructure to get the equipment in? Come on dude... the people who dont see the benefits of that will suddenly become filthy rich citizens of whatever country that's allied to america under diplomatic immunity.
politics,fdiwnym,t1_fczhmqk,1578452731.0,"I mean... you do realize, trump isnt going to ask iraq. I'm not trying to be an ass. Like that dude is fucking insane and it's not like they can stop us. If we go to war, we will hand Iraq a HUGE amount of money, and they will shut up and the politicians that dont will not be politicians for long. This is being a realist. This is how america works. Weve all literally watched it before. 

I'm not condoning anything america is doing. We shouldn't have killed that general. And we shouldn't go to war. But we are. And we will use iraq. And we will justify it by saying they killed 20 Iraqis. And giving them all money. This is how the world works and I hate it."
yesyesyesyesno,fdivpmx,t1_fdggvau,1578452106.0,"I get your point but like... you will NEVER convince me that wasnt the best move. Japanese men were insane. They would've never given up. It would've been the bloodiest war in human history because they were literally making us slaughter them to win. I've seen estimates as high as 10 million total lives were saved because we dropped the bombs and forced a surrender. Most realistically say at least 1 million... at least. That means it saved almost 850k lives at a minimum and at most 5-10 million. Most of those, Japanese. But a LOT of Americans."
HongKong,fdivbr2,t1_fdfphvm,1578451855.0,"My god people. Stop being so melodramatic. Look at india 35 years ago. Is it better? SIGNFICANTLY. Look at America 35 years ago. Is it better? SIGNFICANTLY.  Before you say we arent, ask a gay person, or a black person older than 60.  Shit may look grim, right this second but the world is on a VERY CLEAR path forward. Almost all of it. We still have a few outliers but its getting less and less every single year."
politics,fdishov,t1_fdipyyx,1578450047.0,"The senate can vote all they want. That's not how our country works. And that's from someone who DOESNT want him as my president. The president controls the military. The senate makes the laws. Congress is the purse. To fundamentally change 1 of the three branches, it takes all three. One branch ""voting"" to limit the power of the other branch would be unconstitutional and thrown out by the supreme court. If one branch could limit the power of another, then what's to stop the president from signing an executive order saying the senate cant pass any new laws? 

Also... republicans hold the senate.

And 1 more also, vietnam proved the president can do whatever the fuck he wants with the military. We never declared war on vietnam. Our president can send the military anywhere in the world at anytime. That's literally his job. Hes the commander and chief."
politics,fdiruol,t1_fdiq3zc,1578449637.0,We should have NEVER killed that general but like... we did have 4 soldiers killed and our embassy attacked. I wouldnt exactly say it was 100% our fault...
