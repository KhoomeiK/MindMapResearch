We’re not hurting in our cap space, so finding someone that will fit our system through either of those is a real possible. Blake is a good player and will thrive in a different system.

PoliticalHumor,ffglwft,t1_fff1c2d,1579909271.0,"Bernie’s was the only one we got into. He had fun talking to random people and loved the way Bernie talks and the things he was saying about treating each other with respect. He’s had a pretty decent impression since that day. Trump’s had the line snaking around the school he was at and through the parking lot, so nobody knew when the doors were opened or how many people were getting in. It was obviously done on purpose to make it a spectacle. My son didn’t like that we didn’t know what was going on at all. And his sister (his mom was remarried) is half Mexican, so he wasn’t a big fan of what a lot of people in red hats were yelling. We drove down to Hillary’s and I asked him if he wanted to go in. He said it was good enough to just be there and see the short line. And someone outside of one of the previous ones in the day had yelled “Hillary is a witch!”, so he said he’d rather go get some food than wait in line to hear a witch talk. Ha."
PoliticalHumor,ffdjz4p,t3_esxeb3,1579822485.0,"Leading up to 2016 Sanders, Clinton, and Trump were all in Eau Claire, WI the same day. I took my 11 year old son there to go to each rally so he could see and hear first hand our process. Bernie’s had a few thousand people and was almost fun waiting in line because of how nice everyone was. The only dissent was the crazies yelling about burning in hell and abortion. Trump’s had a few thousand, but many of those were protesters, and others were there to sell Trump junk. A lot of people just hanging around to watch the spectacle. Hilary’s had less than 1000 people in line and her people put word out to the news stations to let people know there was plenty of room so people should come on down."

And in the comments sections of almost anything to do with the Packers there is comments and discussion about firing him. I don’t think we should, but the discussion is all over. And to dismiss all people with that opinion as “casuals” is ridiculous. Just because someone isn’t on Reddit daily or doesn’t follow every single off season move automatically label them as unable to be part of the discussion. This whole “real fans think X” is getting fucking old. There is one qualifying factor to being a real fan, and that is that you like the team you’re a fan of."

1.  Cut into big cubes. Put in a bowl with just enough milk to cover. Sprinkle in a liberal amount of your favorite rib seasoning (I like famous Dave’s rib rub for one you can get anywhere). Put on fridge for at least 2 hours, but I like overnight, especially on older birds. Wrap in a single piece of bacon. Grill indirect low temp until just about medium rare then put over your coals to crisp up the bacon a bit. Don’t let it get past medium or you’ll make them tough as hell.


2.  Leave the skin on the breast. Brine overnight in a sea salt and brown sugar brine with one each of sliced orange and lemon and sprigs of rosemary and thyme. Pull out and pat dry. Rub with salt and pepper (I like to add white pepper also). Grill/smoke over your favorite wood. I like hickory or pecan the best. Again, don’t go past medium and try to get medium rare.
