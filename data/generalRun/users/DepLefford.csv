worldnews,ff34odt,t3_erdr1j,1579533592.0,"""Leaked"", no way. War planning activities would not just get casually leaked like this in any country.  Those are the crown jewels of the military.  The US for example has never declassified any of its war plans since WWII, for example, though we know sketchy details of a few of them like the Canada invasion thing, which I'm sure exists.

This is most likely just a staged photo that was published to influence public opinion (like the photos from 6-7 years ago from North Korea that were widely circulated of a war room puporting to show a missile track to Austin TX or Fort Hood), or it's just some random army regiment or military college making up a scenario for training purposes.  The big diorama table makes me think the latter.

todayilearned,feyojk4,t1_feyerd0,1579448331.0,"Streaming started to seem possible around 2008-2009 once YouTube finally demonstrated the possibility for consistent, reliable video playback at 480p or 720p.  Before that, players on various sites were terrible and resolution was usually much less than 480p.  There were also a lot of sites that liked to use Quicktime (nag screens or crippled players), RealPlayer (similar problem), or Windows Media Player (didn't work well except in IE)... it was a terrible time.  So many video sites used Flash, and it was usually a low-resolution, low framerate pile of garbage the way it was implemented.

Even in 2010 early Netflix streaming was terrible... you'd get buffering all the time on some videos.  I only remember streaming really coming together in 2011-2012, and YouTube was already starting to raise the stakes by moving its platform toward HD."

The takedowns are probably Phil, his wife, or one of their children helping the business.  I doubt any network was pressuring him to take the videos down as if they're asserting ownership they could file YouTube claims on their own.

I will say the takedowns definitely killed his exposure on social media at a key time when his comedy genius could be exposed to a new generation and shared with others.  His rants in 2011-2012 seemed to express a negative opinion of social media.  I guess he figured iTunes podcasts,  TRN, and website presence would be enough to keep up the brand name recognition."
