Considering the utter disrespect your brother showed, I'm not surprised anyone would react as you did- assuming that is word for word what was said.

Should you have mouthed off in front of guests? Maybe not. It's not really the done thing but fuck it, I'm sure they'll get over it.

You might like to apologise to your brother for embarrassing him, but he should apologise to you too.
