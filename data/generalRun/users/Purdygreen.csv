Then to get past the emotional damage that was kept alive, every time the good people that were still connected to her would keep me updated on her, I asked them to not talk to me about her anymore.

She also had 9 months of carrying the baby, the last few she probably slept like shit too. Now her body is healing on top of being sleep deprived, she may be breast feeding, her hormones are all over the place. She probably counts down the minutes until you come home. 

I totally get that you are working your ass off, and on very little sleep. She is too while dealing with all the things I mentioned above (for longer because of the pregnancy). Yes her parents help, because she needs some help. 

Really, it truely is ok that you come home and are exhausted. Everyone warns you, but you just cannot fully understand what having a newborn baby is like until you are living it. 

Hug you're wife. Tell her your sorry. That you are just so desperate for sleep, and you know that she is too. I remember being there, and asking for sleep wasn't intentionally asking the other person to give up things, but that's what it is. 

Try to remember when you're sleep deprived like this, emotions run high, problem solving isn't anyone's strong suit, and naping is your friend. I remember being so sleep deprived at one point that I had decided I was going to cut off a toe So I could go spend a night at the hospital. I had the toe picked out and everything. All because my baby that loved to be swaddled could get out of swaddling and wouldn't sleep anymore. I had such tunnel vision I couldn't problem solve to get him to sleep, and it was a very simple solution, that did not involve amputation. Lol. 

Try to do the little things to make sure that your wife still feels seen by you during this time. Simple things like grabbing her favorite chocolate bar every time you're at the gas station can help elevate good feelings so much.

AmItheAsshole,fephaov,t1_fepg7gj,1579320478.0,"See, but it's not. That is what society says you have to do. You have to love kids that are your family. No you don't. 

I understand if you are meh about kids, or like them, it's hard to wrap your head around someone disliking babies and kids, but there are people who actually do hate children. Every single thing about them is terrible for them. Not terrible like oh this music is awful. Terrible like gut wrenching, floor falling out from under you, nails on chalk board, eye watering rotten smell, worst day of your life terrible. It's like a phobia almost. 

Those people removing themselves from kids isn't them being horrible or selfish. Those people forcing themselves to put up being around children are not healthy for the child. They are not good for kids. They have no empathy for the way children behave, think, have no emotional control, or just are. They don't understand kids are kids. They expect them to understand and behave like adults. They get super frustrated way too easily with them. They know this about themselves and know it's not good for the kid. They try their best when they have to be around kids, but they can't fake it for very long. 

My best friend is one of these people. She lives far away from me and visits once every 18 months or so. Seeing her with my son over the last 10 years has opened my eyes to this. She loves him because she loves me. But she isn't good for him. I would never have her watch him some for any amount of time. As he has aged, she has been able to tolerate him more. The closer he gets to behaving like an adult the longer she can act normal around him. But you can still tell it's a facade. 

She isn't a psychopath. She is a caring, empathetic, human being. She just cannot stand children.

I do believe Jenny is a jerk. I do. But I feel that her siblings feel entitled to her for childcare when she has made it clear that won't ever happen. 

Jenny should be making other contributions to the household in other ways, yes. She however has made it clear that caring for this child will never be one of them. 

It's harmful to Lilly to keep pointing it out as well. If they stopped, and made it clear that nothing was ever asked of Jenny for Lilly, the kid would pick up on that as well. I'm not saying it's great. But it's better then constantly pointing to Jenny and say""see Lilly she won't help you.""

What you're arguing is that just because you exist in that space with that pet you never wanted, and actually really really dislike, is that its now your responsibility to make sure all it's needs are met before you leave. That you are the abusive asshole for having a life designed around not having the pet. 

I actually agree with what you are saying. I would be the one filling the water bowl. But the thing is, we get to choose what responsibilities we take on. Just because someone is our family, and just because society says we should shoulder the burdens of our families choices, does not mean we always have to. The sister is be rude in this case. But she has the right to make these choices, and her family should respect them.

Her mom owns the house and obviously charges Jessica rent because she works and has a dependant that also lives with them.

AmItheAsshole,feecrbq,t3_eoozsw,1579031077.0,"NTA - my grandma waited her whole marriage for her ""horrible, overbearing MIL"" to pass away so she could finally be alone in her marriage with my grandpa. She only outlived her by 5 years. She was always kind, and respectful to her MIL (my great grandma) and we had no idea she felt that way until I had issues with my own MIL as an adult. 

My grandma is the reason I put my foot down when it comes to my MIL. I'm not spending my whole life making concessions in my marriage, being miserable, while still being respectful, trying to wait out a day when I will be free from the horrible wench, just to have it be a couple years. 

You're allowed to protect your space and sanity from people you don't enjoy, even if those people are ""family"". The fact you still go and put up with him at all means you can say no to putting up with him for your family stuff.
