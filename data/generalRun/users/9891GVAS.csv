depression,fek4c17,t1_fejnstj,1579192329.0,"You're very welcome! If my words can put a little into your stamina tank, it makes my day a lot better. But I do mean what I said"
intj,fek2r10,t3_ephknd,1579191370.0,"I agree 100% with you. I portray a certain image of being well dressed, clean cut, confident,sarcastic, and no emotion shown because I'm scared shitless of being vulnerable in any way. 

Relationships are difficult.  I can never allow myself to be vulnerable. I get a feeling I'm exposed and my walls go back up with reinforcement.

I'm trying to work on it but it really does suck."

depression,fedicl5,t3_eolepf,1579012279.0,"You can do it ! Don't throw in the towel. I'm always down too, but find just enough strength to get my head above water. I'll be your support, and I mean it. PM me if you need someone to talk to"
depression,fed6kiy,t3_eoiwn3,1579001321.0,Because I will need you in the future to talk me out of putting a bullet in my head.
depression,fed5cbx,t3_eojnu5,1578999645.0,"I completely understand you and feel the same way. I lost my brother and my sister. I've always hated life and would trade places with them in a heartbeat. Thinking of suicide is so soothing, but I couldn't do that to my mother and other sister. They have a hard time with it too, and it would be selfish of me to take the easy way out. I don't trust anyone to talk about my problems with, so I'm forced to carry this burden, plus the other shit I'm forced to feel. From someone with a similar case, you're not lonely. I'm here for you."
depression,fed3392,t3_eoiu8g,1578996356.0,I'm here if you want to vent. Can't sleep and feeling very shitty

depression,fed2uka,t3_eoj0ak,1578995995.0,"I'm feeling like this too, but I can't sleep. I wake up anxious after 3 hours of sleep. I took a strong dose of sleeping pills, yet here I am feeling this isn't a life I want to continue. I'm lost and have no idea where to fucking go."
depression,fed2irz,t3_eoj1ja,1578995505.0,"I've been feeling the same way. I was at my families graves earlier damn near screaming why them and not me. They had purpose, and I don't. I feel like crying and screaming out of frustration but I'm so numb I cant. Fuck it, we have to deal with it I guess. I'm here for you for whatever it's worth"
Psychic,fecee5t,t3_eod83x,1578971928.0,"Good evening, I would love a reading if you have time. Thank you"

r4r,fco7z25,t3_ei491f,1577825817.0,"Hang in there sweetie! I too, am a damaged individual that tries to get by. I'm interested in trading stories and hopefully cheer you up a bit. PM me"
