saltysweetsabrina,ffd1gl8,t1_ffcle82,1579811543.0,That was clearly sarcasm dummy. How could you be confused by that?
saltysweetsabrina,ffchm3f,t1_ffcfgi7,1579799641.0,"A white knight calling me a simp? Hmmm...
Bro I pay for her OF, her patreon, her snap, her copycat snaps I'm pretty much in a relationship with her, don't be jealous."
yourmomshousepodcast,ffcg5rl,t1_ffc71la,1579798747.0,She does? I can't see anymore cause she blocked me after posting that all another poster needed to get her body is endless amount of free time to work out and a nanny to help raise the kids.
saltysweetsabrina,ffce0yo,t1_ffbp5zw,1579797438.0,"She took down the mega so she def cares about posting it here. She can advocate for herself my guy, don't need to swoop in."
saltysweetsabrina,ffbboli,t1_ffb8uts,1579758746.0,"Only fans isn't about exclusive content anymore it's about paying fans getting first dibs at it. You can annoy yourself to the end of the world fighting every time somebody re uploads your stuff for others to see or just keep pushing content out in order to entice the existing subs and add personalized content to build a sense of loyalty from them. People are paying you because in some weird way they think you are interacting with them, kill it there. Yes it sucks that your content is being used for free but considering that all you're doing is making yourself cum and requires no effort for a large payout might as well let it be. Or not what the fuck do I know."
JoeRogan,ffapxzf,t1_ffap80x,1579741745.0,Brave.
ChildSupport,ffadzsn,t3_e84c7y,1579733363.0,"Going through divorce now in CA. VA disability was counted toward support, and apparently so will the BAH part of the GI Bill if I end up going to court, which will probably be likely."
Divorce_Men,ff3vzmm,t3_erfi8v,1579550059.0,"Add all income across every year married divide by the total time to come with an average monthly wage and pay out that for half the duration of the marriage. Alimony sucks and yes there are ex's who abuse it but it is very true that many times when the SO decides to spend their time at home it allows the other partner to pursue things outside the home because the children are handled, or the home is covered. Yes not always the case but they arent going to make the law based on exceptional money hungry bastards.   


The money should be capped at that amount the fact that the spouse can request a higher alimony based on future raises to the paying Ex is ridiculous. They are used to a standard of living when they were married not afterwards."
DnD,feuzgu4,t3_eqlog6,1579391489.0,I don't know how I'm already following you on Twitter but cool. Small worlds.

Sabrina_Nichole,fenu7ww,t3_eq12wc,1579290804.0,It sucks that we only have her fucking that fat dude as porn. Would have been great to see her go all in.
Custody,fen4ncy,t1_femm665,1579276875.0,"I don't work the traditional M-F, I have an alternating day off which includes Saturday."
Custody,fem3kwb,t1_fem0eed,1579238605.0,I have 35% and that's being generous. The overnights aren't two full 48 hour periods it's one 36 hour chunk.
Custody,fekx153,t1_fekv5ky,1579209362.0,I'm not in your country. I'm sad that your countries child custody laws suck but mine is compared to the cases around my area at most MY country which is a shit decision here. Thank you for the empathy though.
Custody,fekv0yf,t1_feku9m6,1579208171.0,"I think you misread the post. I don't have 3-4 nights anymore.

I have 2."
Custody,feks66c,t1_fekme6h,1579206491.0,"He did explain that, and I did not expect that I would get it but to go from every day to only having them when I have my designated day is beyond ridiculous."
Divorce,feep2o4,t1_feekytq,1579038244.0,"Honestly I think this is it. I've let him do everything and anything related to the case. Fill out and file all my documents and had multiple phone conversations and email exchanges. This is a bit infuriating honestly, they nickel and dime the shit out of me."
Animemes,feeelae,t3_eolebh,1579032152.0,Beggers can't be choosers.
PublicFreakout,fedxvem,t1_fednfcz,1579022194.0,I thought he just fingered the girl? When did it come out that he raped her?
temptationislandUSA,febdlry,t1_fea99gf,1578957732.0,"Date people that you really dont find ""moth to a flame"" attractive. If your picker is fucked then don't let it pick for you anymore."
trashy,fe5tjxp,t1_fe2u76p,1578874623.0,It's not about needing help it's about putting out advertisment that would reach the same amount of people for a fraction of the cost as any other type of ad.
trashy,fe5tgau,t3_enooqx,1578874561.0,This isn't entitled. She asked and offered another company that did the same as an example. She didn't demand or even was rude. She simply asked. Out of the hundreds of entitled influencers this was a really polite attempt.
JoeRogan,fdrmony,t1_fdrddyt,1578686722.0,"If you're going to argue for him saying those words specifically than sure, but he's expressed his confusion over borders existing and supported arguments for open borders many times. Now nowhere near the level of his other talking points but he has referenced it but this is Joe and Joe likes to talk out of his ass and he's constantly high so who the fuck knows what he would actually support if it came down to it. Most likely for borders though."
JoeRogan,fdr6gon,t1_fdqjfmf,1578680170.0,In the past. He's said it multiple times.
Celebhub,fdodtad,t3_ema935,1578603296.0,No thank you.
brimercado14,fdo1c31,t3_elp6z9,1578597069.0,"She had an only fans for a while and this is the best from all her content including ""leaks""? Man, she really ripped people off."
brimercado14,fdfycey,t3_ekybgm,1578373658.0,I don't understand how you can have that much ass and not know how to twerk. She needs a fairy hoe mother.
brimercado14,fdfy8em,t3_ekyb7p,1578373561.0,"She's so lucky she is genetically blessed, but god damn is she sloppy looking."
