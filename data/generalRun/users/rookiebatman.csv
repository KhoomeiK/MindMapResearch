Hey, I'm curious about something. I've heard a lot of people talking, and seen some gameplay video, so I know that this game has a lot of like wandering around and talking to people, and even some dungeon-crawling. In some ways, it almost seems like a full JRPG with a farming component.

Honestly, I think you're missing out by putting this limitation on it. In my experience, a lot of the custom content for The Sims is not just free, it's also *better* than the default stuff (more detailed, more creative and unique). If you set your mind to it, I think it would be very possible for you to get into the mindset where browsing the custom content sites and picking what you want to download and install that day is just another fun part of the ""playing dress up"" experience. If you can get into that headspace, then a vast new world will be opened up to you, with tens of thousands of clothing options that don't require any microtransactions. 

Alternately, you could try going to a Sims forum (or the subreddit here) and asking if someone with a lot of custom content will zip up their whole mods folder and just transfer it to you as a single file, then once you drop that in your own mods folder, you can just be done with it and not worry about downloading and installing anymore (of course, you have to trust that they have a good collection, but there are probably plenty of people out there who have a ton of custom clothes)."

> Why did you predict Trump would tank the economy?

Because his status as a highly successful businessman is largely illusory, and you can't just declare bankruptcy on the national debt. Honestly, the trade war is a great example of the kind of thinking and  behavior from Trump which led me to think that (and we still don't know what kind of long-term repercussions that will have). I still remember discussing the trade war with a Trump supporter, one of the people who believed the big lie that Trump is a master negotiator. He said he would be very surprised if the trade war was still happening ""six months from now."" That was in June 2018. 

Just like thinking a giant, expensive wall is the best way to stop illegal immigration (despite how many people would just go over, under, or around the wall; not to mention that the majority of people here illegally had visas and just stayed past their expiration), Trump's ideas about economic policy are, quite frankly, childish. Whether he was always this dumb or his brain has succumbed to the ravages of old age is a different discussion, but the person I saw campaigning in 2016 is not someone who I believe is capable of deftly navigating the complexities of managing an entire country's economy. Fortunately, Obama left him with a good one, so as long as he stays mostly hands-off, we should be fine.

> Right now we're going through an impeachment trial that is treating our elections as a joke

That's fucking bullshit. Trump did not get impeached because the Democrats wanted to overturn an election. If he's removed from office, Mike Pence will be president, not Hillary Clinton. You'll keep getting your nominations of conservative-activist judges. Nothing significant about executive-branch policy will change; the only thing that will change is that a corrupt president will have faced repercussions for his corrupt actions.

A candidate getting more than 270 votes in the electoral college does not entitle them to ignore the law (and congressional subpoenas). That's what the impeachment was about. The Constitution gives Congress full authority to remove a president from office for things like bribery and high crimes, and never once says anything about only doing that to presidents who didn't win an election. Honestly, this line of argument is one of the most pathetic defenses Republicans have against a thoroughly Constitutional process. 

It seriously would not sound any less rational to me if Republicans tried to argue that people *have to* reelect Trump in 2020, because ""we held an election in 2016, and the voters have spoken, so how dare you try to overturn that?"" This impeachment defense does not sound a bit less ridiculous to me than that. 

> a completely partisan attempt at impacting the 2020 election

You mean a president abusing the authority of his office to influence a foreign government to sling mud at his probable opponent? 

>  Are you honestly telling me that people aren't rooting for impeachment right now? 

Of course they are, *because Donald Trump committed impeachable offenses.* They want him to be removed from office because he's unfit for office, not because they're sore losers. And honestly, there's like a 99.9% chance that Pence was fully and willfully complicit in all this Ukraine stuff, but even so, I don't think people would be calling for his impeachment with anywhere near as much fervor as they have for Trump. Trump is completely and thoroughly corrupt, and he lowers the dignity of the office of the president every day he remains in it. You best believe that other people with ambition to be a corrupt president are paying attention to just how much they can get away with. If Nixon were alive today, he'd be screaming at the TV, ""why the hell did I ever resign?""

> Meanwhile in the real world, the economy is growing extremely well, unemployment is low, wages are going up, etc. 

Just like they were under Obama. Remember Spicer saying the numbers ""may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now?""  Pardon me if I don't give your side credit for that. Let me ask you this, though; do you think the tax cuts lived up to conservative expectations of stimulating the economy? Why are they talking about doing tax cuts for the middle class in Trump's second term, if that's what the 2017 tax cuts were supposed to be already?

> Who is suffering? Who? Tell me about all of these people who are supposedly suffering or are you just trying to push some belief of moral superiority while you lie, cheat and misrepresent anything that you don't like? It's disgusting what is going on right now from the democrats.

I guess the children in ""[icebox](https://www.thecut.com/2018/12/what-are-las-hieleras-iceboxes-used-by-cbp-at-the-border.html)"" detention camps don't count as people to you.

I'm guessing you're the type of person who thinks the El Paso shooter saying that he already held those bigoted views before Trump came along fully exonerates Trump of any influence on his actions (despite the fact that he never went and committed mass murder until after Trump). I'm guessing you're the type of person who thinks people not being able to afford healthcare or not having access to abortions is a good thing. You probably don't mind all the ways that Trump's deregulation is impacting the environment. 

I've given you some examples just so you can't pretend I'm dodging the question, but if you seriously need to ask ""who is suffering,"" then I don't figure you're the type of person who would have enough basic human empathy to appreciate any answer I might give, no matter how detailed."

But I'm not simply saying ""God is evil, therefore God doesn't exist."" The reason someone on my side of the argument points out that God seems to act in an evil, cruel, or unjust way, is to pose a *contradiction* within your position. If you're holding as a premise that God is purely good, and God does things that are clearly evil (by anything but a tautological or circular definition of evil which is specifically formulated to exclude anything that God does), then that premise is violated, and a conclusion that's reached by it is not sound. 

What I'm saying, in simplest terms, is that your position **doesn't make sense**, because of those contradictions between the supposed perfect goodness of God and his actual behaviors. If it doesn't make sense, then that's one reason not to believe it's actually consistent with reality.

>  If it transcends evil, then you have your work cut out for you because Atheism can't produce that transcendence. 

I contend that you can't either. If God exists, then good and evil are still conventions, it's just that God might be the one who defines the convention. Not really that big of a change. But if God (through the Bible or the church) describes a convention for good that's anything other than ""whatever I the Lord do is good,"" then there's a pretty solid chance that some of the things he's done (according to your beliefs) won't even meet *your own standard* for goodness.

You know what it's like to feel pain; if you experience empathy or compassion, then you don't want to make anyone else feel like that, regardless of whether any particular religion's deity really exists.

Given his enthusiastic willingness to cheat, and the lack of consequences he's ever suffered for doing so, I think Trump is likely to be president for the rest of his natural life (there's a reason he's ""joked"" so much about abolishing term limits). In a free and fair election, sure, Trump would lose.

The argument was that an investigation is a thing of value in itself, regardless of the outcome. If the only action being demanded is to *announce* an investigation (perhaps even without the investigation ever really being conducted), then the only outcome is that people hear that someone is being investigated. That certainly does change the situation, because it indicates that Trump's goal was simply to discredit Biden, not to find out whether he ever actually did anything wrong. Uncovering an abuse of power committed by Biden could be seen as a thing of value to the public, but if the investigation is not actually seeking the truth of that, then there is no public benefit left to gain.

You already said that before, and I responded that we should avoid such simplistic absolutes.

To be honest, it kinda seems like you're just completely denying the very concept that politicians can abuse the authority of their office. Let's use a hypothetical for illustrative purposes. A local politician is in charge of choosing who gets the contract for a public works project. Option A, he gives it to the company who he believes will do the best job, in the hope that the public will see how well the project turned out and reelect him to run more projects. Option B, he hires the company who gives him a cash bribe to pick them. By your standard, both of those decisions were made for personal benefit. Are you seriously gonna claim that one was not more corrupt than the other?

> Glad we can agree on that. That doesn't meet my test for impeachment though. 

You don't think that someone being unfit for office is a good reason to remove them from office?

> And can we also recognize that Ukraine themselves have said they didn't feel pressured?

Ukraine's word on the subject is entirely untrustworthy. Trump has already demonstrated that he's willing to withhold desperately-needed resources from them if they don't cooperate with his agenda. Of course they're gonna do everything they can to try to stay on the United States President's good side. If this were an investigation being conducted after Trump was out of office, that would be a different story. But at this point, it's like someone saying they weren't taken hostage, while the hostage-taker still has a gun pressed against their back.

Right, just like the media summarily [denounced](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/24/us/politics/trump-robert-mueller.html) Barr's biased summary of the Mueller Report. 

Or more aptly, like the media [handled](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/12/7/13872580/media-coverage-presidential-election) the investigation of Hillary's emails, especially after the Comey letter came out. I think Trump remembers exactly how that whole thing [went down](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/), and wants to make it happen again.

If that were how it really worked, then Hillary Clinton would be president right now. Unfortunately, there are too many people that simply see someone is being investigated, and don't look into it any more deeply than that.

> Additonally, it should be of personal benefit, without a national benefit.

If the *reason* Trump did it was for personal benefit, then I don't think it should matter if it happens to also have a national benefit by accident. It's still taking actions with the power and authority of his office for personal gain. Someone who does that is unfit to hold such authority, no matter what residual benefits the individual action might have had. (Not that I'm agreeing it would have national benefit.)

> I mean, anything the President does could be seen as a personal benefit to prolong their position and their power.

One could just as easily make a Louis XIV argument, that anything which benefits the president personally does have national benefit, because the president is the leader of the nation. We should avoid such absolutes in either direction.

> I think Trump bought into what was being sold to him that ""many people"" we're concerned about Biden/Ukraine potential corruption.

To be frank, I think the reason you're having trouble with some of these concepts is that most people just kinda subconsciously presuppose *magic* as a part of our thought processes. We take it for granted that free will exists, and since free will requires some kind of x-factor that allows us to choose freely (independent of all those more pedestrian influences), then we must also take it for granted that such an x-factor exists. Having done so, on a purely subconscious level, it seems odd for someone to suggest that free will isn't real, because how could it not be, given the existence of this x-factor that we're all subconsciously presupposing?

In a discussion like this, there's really nothing that can be achieved if you're not introspective and reflective enough to set aside tacit premises that haven't actually been established. Let me ask you this; if you accepted as a premise that the human soul is not real, would that change your opinion about any of this stuff at all?

Absolutely. But when he's creating a person, he would have just as much ability to foresee their experiences as their genetics. That doesn't change anything.

> And it is possible that god has created the world in which, though a combination of genes AND experiences, the most number of people go to heaven.

The most number of people that can go to heaven is ""all of them."" If the maximum possible is any less than that, then God is not all-powerful. 

> If thats so, then he is far from cruel. He would be awesome for trying to get as many people as possible into heaven. The fact that people suffer is a required side effect to bring about the most good.

What do you mean by ""trying""? Not to get all Yoda on you, but when we're talking about an all-powerful deity, there's no such thing as trying; he either does something (successfully) or he doesn't. The success rate for an omniscient being should be 100%. If God tries to do something and fails sometimes, then he is not all-powerful. If there are required side effects that he can't nullify, then he is not all-powerful. 

Do you not believe in an all-powerful god?

> Taking it a step futher, why doesnt determinism apply to God as well? Why isnt his choice to create also determined by his ""genes"" and experiences?

I mean, you kind of just answered your own question with those quote marks. God doesn't actually have genes; he doesn't have any physical elements (like brain chemistry) that drive certain reactions or impulses. As for experiences, humans can only be influenced by past experiences because we don't know how making one decision or another will turn out. But if God is all-knowing, then he should be able to see the outcome of every possible branch of the decision tree, and pick the best one.

Not in the moment when the decision is being made. Everything under ""experiences"" is in the past, and no one can change the past...

No, the decision you made was to go and do more research. That was (within a deterministic framework) the only choice you could have made, given the genetics and experiences you had at the moment you decided to do that. Then, when you go back to the original choice, and pick which way to go based on the further research you did, that research is now also a past experience that is part of the overall set of experiences influencing this new decision. 

You're thinking of it too much in binary terms. Decisions in the real world are not true-or-false tests. If you have a decision where the basic choices are ""yes"" or ""no,"" and you choose ""don't answer yet,"" *you still made a choice*. Yes and no were never the only options available to you, unless someone's putting a gun to your head, in which case the gun is also an experience influencing your decision.

Well, I think it makes him a lot more cruel, that the being who created people with the genetics that would determine them to not believe God exists, is also punishing them for their non-belief. If you believe that God is all-knowing, then he knows exactly how pious or righteous or religious any given person is going to be at the moment he brings them into existence, which means he could just keep reshuffling the genes he's going to give them until the result is someone predisposed to be a good person. But he doesn't do that, which means he either doesn't have the ability to (including the possibility that he doesn't exist at all), or he's perfectly fine with the existence of evil people who cause good people to suffer."

Think about what you're saying in this very discussion. The reasons that you're giving or the objections you're making are rooted in or inspired by things you've heard or read before, aren't they? Hearing or reading something is an experience. Mulling over things you've heard or read is an experience. Previous discussions are experiences.

> Ok then can you explain exactly what you mean by determinism?

I'm pretty sure I already did, but I'll try it once more. What determinism means to me is that genetics (our brain chemistry, physical characteristics, etc.) and experiences (memories, knowledge, having tried something before, having considered the repercussions of possible outcomes, etc.) seem to be the only things that influence our decisions, and since we have no control over our genetics, or over our past experiences at the moment of the decision, there's only one choice that each person could ever possibly make for any given decision. If they made the decision a certain way, and then time was rewound to put them back at the moment of the decision with no memory of how it turned out, they would make the same choice every single time without fail, no matter how often the clock was turned back.

Okay, no big deal. ""Belief"" and ""dogmatic faith"" are not the same thing. You can believe something with evidence or without evidence.
