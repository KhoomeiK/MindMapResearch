Hell, I got into Star Trek through Voyager and at the time all the fans were saying that Voyager was trash.

startrek,ffc56g2,t3_esqdo5,1579791782.0,"First, I 100% agree about the interviewer.  Things kinds of things are not done lightly.  Interviewers of high profile people are very tightly controlled by both sides.  The journalist organization is picked from the most highly reputable, the journalist selected from the highest caliber among their employ, and the interview itself typically has reps from both parties in the production booth.  Also, questions are usually pre-scripted and reviewed before the interview.

That whole scene went sour pretty damn fast - it didn't lead there, it was led.  Even if the journalist managed to get ""the scoop"" from Picard, that organization smeared their own reputation and they've hurt their chance to ever get a high profile interview again.

Ok, I digress.  My only other complaint is that I thought with the merger of the IP, we might see the sovereign instead of the Enterprise.  The argument could be made that they served on the Galaxy class together longer, but Encounter at Farpoint was 2364 and the Enterprise-E was launched in 2372 - that's 8 years.  Data died in 2379 - that's 7 years on the E.  So, I think it's half-and-half pretty much.  So, I'd just have expected the E."
