news,ffw1t47,t1_ffvz0yr,1580280720.0,"Seriously. His replies only further painted him in that way. He did not seem to believe that anyone would reject an offer to be in the position of CEO because, ""Right like you're so moral, anyone would do that if they were offered millions,"""
news,ffw1ky4,t1_ffw0n33,1580280468.0,"Jesus, dude, are you really so invested in your worldview that you can't believe that a person doesn't value money over abating some human suffering? Is empathy that alien a concept to you?"
news,ffvxwcy,t1_ffvt8q3,1580276685.0,"Man, this is some projection. Just because you wouldn't mind being a pig CEO like that doesn't mean everyone else wouldn't either. Power changes people, but I'm pretty sure most wouldn't create this kind of cruelty for profit."

He's got us there."
news,ffvt9qv,t1_ffvsrnk,1580272608.0,"All right, we can disagree on how to run an economy. Yes, maximizing profit is inherent to capitalism, and many will get there by unethical means, but what I meant is that producing life-saving drugs at costs that kill people is not how it has to be."
selfimprovement,ffvsk8g,t1_ffvk9uu,1580272038.0,"It all depends on what she's like! Movies and dinner are a classic - just make sure to sit next to each other rather than across while eating (makes it feel less like an interview and is easier to transition to casual touch) The first few dates should be doing something that would also be fun alone (things to talk about, silence is more comfortable) - maybe including a mutual interest? How well do you know her? A movie and dinner is a safe choice, but a more rewarding one might be something more unique to her?"
news,ffvs2sh,t1_ffvqe08,1580271656.0,"I agree that the government is needed to fix the issue, and they are definitely partly to blame, but I do also blame the drug companies. Yes, maximising profit is just capitalism, but that doesn't make it ethical or inherent."
news,ffvjudm,t1_ffvj5vs,1580265815.0,The more expensive SPRIX is the problem. The shortage would not be one if the alternative medication was similarly priced.
selfimprovement,ffvjfoq,t3_evfpex,1580265540.0,"If she likes you, she probably won't (or shouldn't) care about a somewhat janky car, as long as it's clean. She'll likely understand. If you don't want to take her in it before it's fixed, why not ask her on a date you don't need a car for?"
selfimprovement,ffvj05y,t3_evcfzr,1580265243.0,Absolutely switch therapists if you feel you need to - the difference between one who you don't *really* click with and one that you feel actually understands you is amazing. Source - on my fifth therapist

changemyview,ffv850r,t1_ffv3ovm,1580257959.0,"I wouldn't call that a reasonable conclusion from a selection bias. Therapy would unlikely be to try and take away the feelings, but instead to provide coping skills and fulfill other facets of their life."
SelfAwarewolves,ffpe82o,t1_ffo4l4z,1580092844.0,"Not to mention the *child rape* case being swept under the rug against him and his buddy Epstein. Katie Johnson if you want to look her up. She was 13. I couldn't find the court documents again, but it's... A tough read to stomach."
NotHowDrugsWork,ff3wv3s,t1_ff3pmn9,1579550602.0,"Oh absolutely! I'm not 100% sure, but anecdotally, acid comedowns are tiring, introspective, and kind of sad (?). That uncomfortable headspace often leads you to revolutionize your cognition, so it really depends on intent."
NotHowDrugsWork,ff3ojmx,t1_ff2vek3,1579545478.0,"Yeah, I never take acid if I don't have sleep meds. The trip can get exhausting, I generally want to tap out after 6 hours."

conspiracy,fespqce,t1_ewovw61,1579367721.0,"It was apparently a list of Epstein's important contacts - including people and organizations that helped him in some way. Most have said that they didn't meet the guy, or see the girls. For some, it's a glaring lie. For others, it's a possibility they were just schmoozed by Epstein."
PoliticalHumor,feotkdz,t1_feo9a6p,1579305242.0,"It's the world we live in, but dear God. This is a tough one to stomach. His former secretary confirmed that it was all true? I just don't understand how *child rape* won't land him in trouble, let alone prison."

LifeProTips,fdja6v7,t1_fdie4p9,1578462990.0,That's amazing!
LifeProTips,fdh8dmu,t1_fdh4pln,1578417589.0,True - common sense precedes all LPTs. Situation is everything.

shrooms,fdh19uv,t1_fdgbq1z,1578413196.0,I'm just wondering if it's even possible to sell it explicitly for consumption. Would it have to be from a country where it's legal? I can't imagine you could sell it from the US.

cursedcomments,fdfwi0m,t1_fdfucd4,1578372103.0,"For you, it doesn't have that negative connotation. For many, it *does* change the meaning."

LifeProTips,fdfro69,t1_fdfrbnl,1578368543.0,"Exactly!! People generally appreciate that - I once complimented someone's outfit at a bus stop, turned out they were new in the area, we ended up smoking and chilling together! It's surprising the experiences you open yourself to that way. That Mars Rover story sounds interesting!"

AskAnthropology,fd86lyo,t1_fd7zla7,1578214417.0,"Good point! Being physically higher is associated advantage in many sections - fighting, generally smarter animals, vantage points, hiding, etc."
AskAnthropology,fd7vdq1,t3_ek5k2a,1578210709.0,"Interesting question! Perhaps it's related to the size and stature of animals. Us bipeds stand taller and look up to the stars, which could also have an effect. The sky is infinite and wondrous, unreachable. It seems like a behemoth compared to the ground we stand on."

psychology,fcl9ova,t1_fcl4d95,1577742847.0,"The way I see it, our ancestors had circumstances that were more likely to cause depression, anxiety, etc. The effects caused by that may have abated their ability to survive much more significantly than it would have now. If anyone could add onto or correct what I'm saying, that would be appreciated!"
