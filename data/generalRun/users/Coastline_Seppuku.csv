gabagoodness,ffqyifl,t1_ffqxalj,1580146503.0,"I know, I loved cigs on Xanax particularly. It's confusing about gabaoentin, because it's a gabaergic, but it definitely doesn't get cancelled out by nicotine or caffeine, just changes the high. Look it up, I'm about to head out the door, but I'd love to know if I'm wrong or not. And no problem, I've been using gabapentin recreationally for years now, so I like to pretend I know what I'm talking about lol"
Drugs,ffqxva4,t1_ffqwyo6,1580146097.0,"I can tell your age just by your username, you've already lost this pissing contest. As far as ""addict mentality"" -- no shit, Sherlock. If your ass can't handle being addicted without ending up in the hospital, you've got no business doing drugs. If you're like this kid, quit embarrassing the rest of us who know how to get high. Thanks"
gabagoodness,ffqw215,t1_ffpnm09,1580144939.0,"I'm pretty sure I read gabapentin has a low affinity for gaba receptors actually. I noticed coffee mixes well with it, where caffeine and benzos tend to cancel eachother out"

I can push around guys who have 40lbs on me sometimes because they're chickenshit boys. He wouldn't have called if he didn't care, so he most likely ran from you.

Okay, now, will you two just hook up already since you hate ""men"" and quit your sexist bullshit?"
paganism,ffpub5g,t1_ffpou7v,1580105990.0,"Jesus wasn't a demigod, lol, is English your second language? That's not what that means. Lucifer is the serpent in the Garden of Eden, and Jesus mentions him in the New Testament. Also, I can tell you're just basically copying and pasting from the Wikipedia page"
paganism,ffpe2jt,t1_ffpcyng,1580092734.0,"El and Yahweh are the same thing. There are no demigods in the Bibble. You seem to be confusing Greek mythology. The closest thing is elohim, whichs means ""gods"" not demigods. Where does it say the devil doesn't exist"
paganism,ffp5018,t1_ffp1jlc,1580086346.0,"You are aware Devi worship predates any of this father worship, right? Sumerians weren't the first people in existence. If you want to quote the backwards new testament then you can go back to church. I don't want to hear it. And Yahweh is one of the names of God. If you knew anything you would know God in the Old Testament has many names depending on the context he's being referenced"
