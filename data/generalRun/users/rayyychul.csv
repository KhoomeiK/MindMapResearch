Office365,ffwjndz,t1_ffvwgu2,1580303168.0,That’s a good work around solution! Thank you :)
Office365,ffwjlzq,t1_ffwe8nd,1580303133.0,"We can’t use Google, but thank you."
Office365,ffvoacl,t1_ffvmdpt,1580268844.0,Too bad. How inconvenient. Thanks for the link to the thread!
PersonalFinanceCanada,ffrrkzm,t1_ffqnq0t,1580164257.0,Oh wow! Okay. Thanks for clarifying! That's really interesting to know.
PersonalFinanceCanada,ffqmnbu,t1_ffqm5jk,1580138636.0,Fabulous! I didn't know I could also use it for furniture. Thanks so much; I appreciate you taking the time to answer!
PersonalFinanceCanada,ffqma85,t1_ffqluup,1580138379.0,"Absolutely. It's my understanding that under the RRSP Home Buyers' Plan there is no penalty for withdrawal, whereas there is one when withdrawing under other circumstances. It's only a couple thousand dollars and I can work without using it, so if there's a penalty it doesn't make sense to withdraw. 

Thanks for tour response!

Edit: I just re-read your comment and realized I misinterpreted what you said. I thought you were saying I can withdraw from the RRSP no matter what (ie not under the HBP), but I understand now. I apologize!"
PersonalFinanceCanada,ffqm3d8,t1_ffqlvan,1580138243.0,Perfect! Thank you so much for your quick and informative response.
education,ffjqrbd,t1_ffixwar,1580004526.0,"I give them two. One to prep/plan, one to write. We have a Flex block daily so students can also come in and work on either part during that time if they need more."
education,ffirc5c,t1_ffhtkb8,1579980774.0,"I solved that problem by treating writing like a test. You do everything in class, no cellphones. If anything leaves the classroom, it needs to be redone in class."
Teachers,ffe2s5j,t1_ffe2c1a,1579835202.0,I teach an elective in which it’s very easy to plagiarize. I’ve had kids removed from my class for multiple plagiarism infractions.
shittyfoodporn,ffayuef,t1_ff9lbih,1579747662.0,Yes they are. I will chose no hot dogs over boiled hot dogs any day.
Teachers,ffaya24,t1_ffalu20,1579747288.0,"Yes! I’m sorry, I don’t have kids. I don’t know what to do about your moody teenager. Can we talk about him getting a tutor for French, maybe?"
grammar,fexzbar,t1_fexi33q,1579438695.0,Shouldn’t it then be “XY is a brand who/that specialize**s** in”?
Invisalign,fexywka,t1_fevk1qh,1579438515.0,No. A year of Invisalign costs the same whether you have 5 or 500 aligners. I have 99 trays so it’s not any faster but I avoided needing attachments which I like.
TalesFromTheCustomer,fesr35p,t1_fesbx1f,1579368118.0,"In the stores I've worked in, returns counted against our store's daily target and hours were reflective of the ability to meet the daily target. So there *could* have been an indirect affect on the paycheque.

That being said, I've never been urged to not accept a return. Sometimes I'd try to get the customer to do an exchange instead, but I never pushed it if they didn't want to."
AskReddit,fejpqht,t1_fejf4sq,1579182679.0,"That’s on Amazon. They send these questions right to people’s emails. Many think they’re being asked the question directly and feel obligated to answer. Hell, I was a little confused the first time I got one."
Invisalign,feixzd3,t1_feixhko,1579150341.0,"It totally depends on your plan. I have 99 aligners for lots of quick, small changes (instead of adding attachments)."
Invisalign,fehuu52,t1_fehul86,1579124313.0,I change twice a week (I do every three days so it ends up being a bit more than twice a week sometimes) and mine are never painful or uncomfortable! I even changed Sunday and then Monday (misplaced my trays) with no discomfort.
Invisalign,fehq262,t1_fegsihv,1579121602.0,Same. I change so often I wonder if they don’t have time to hurt.
1200isplenty,fehj60w,t1_fehi1zf,1579117617.0,They obviously need to tar and feather her.
