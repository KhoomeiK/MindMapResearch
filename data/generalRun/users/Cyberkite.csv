AskReddit,ffq27zk,t1_ffq09x4,1580116352.0,"I do have groups, just the one were there are girls most happens to be interested in girls more, some of my best friends are in that group. And the other groups is nearly only guys. 

It's a bit of a weird situation, but yeah I live in outside of town so I rarely get to meet new people on a daily basis, outside those groups.  

But tbh someone once told me, do what you love, instead of chasing a girl, so I will try to do that more, dropping dating apps have helped a bit."
AskReddit,ffpxsdu,t1_ffpv84t,1580110066.0,"Thanks! Was kinda needed! I do indeed admire people that strive to exceed what is expected of them. 

But yeah I'm a person that loves to bitch too much,and I'm trying to learn to get over that. 

Also dating apps are way too superficial, and people give the wrong impression on them self. 

I realized this when I met up with someone, that decided to meet me in a dirty hoodie with paint on it... Soooo many red flags, but really none on the app, while she might have been a bit obese, she did do her make up and so on all photos.... Was a shocker"
