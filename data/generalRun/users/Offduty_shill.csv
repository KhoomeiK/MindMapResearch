radiohead,ffe80eu,t1_ffcq980,1579839193.0,I'm so sad that one's not been reissued :( Someone stole mine from me in college and I haven't been able to replace it since. It was a birthday gift from a friend too.
whowouldwin,ffdoy09,t1_ffcbyb3,1579825527.0,"Eh it's way more fair IMO. Gaara is completely out of Toph's league, FMA universe and ATLA are way closer in general power level than ATLA vs Naruto.

Still agree Toph wins for the most part, but if Ed either understands earthbending and how's it's not alchemy or has a philosophers stone he wins. Environment also matters a lot in the battle, and whether we assume this is a Toph who's a fully proficient metalbender or Toph at the end of ATLA who can only barely metalbend."
FireEmblemHeroes,ffdgrss,t3_estx4a,1579820534.0,"Eh a lot of units can do this nowadays tbh. He's def an auto monster though, and he's become a staple of my TT auto team. He's also been quite useful as an AR omnitank with bonus unit status and light blessings.

FireEmblemHeroes,ff8fj99,t3_ermogl,1579676265.0,"Yes it works, but it probably isn't worth it.

The only units that are thaaat fast that you need phantom speed to proc close call are your Mareetas and Larceis who will destroy Lethe regardless. And even then I'd rather taking darting blow/stance since you'll also get the double."
FireEmblemHeroes,ff8fgud,t3_erru1h,1579676187.0,"Eh, I'm in the same situation. I think I'll prolly keep her as a galeforce unit unless I +10 her in the future though. The 18 base res turns me off from giving her DC despite the close call effect."
FireEmblemHeroes,ff7b50e,t1_ff5eeal,1579645221.0,I mean you do have Astram if you wanted a faster free sword unit.
FireEmblemHeroes,ff5fw0l,t3_epowo1,1579591090.0,"Eh I would just wait for other DC fodder if I was you. You'll get it eventually and while B!Ike is god tier with his refine and DC, it seems like you have other strong axe units that you're happy with at the moment so you don't need him badly.

Giving up 2 Hectors for one DC just feels bad IMO. But you should definitely give B!Ike DC, as much as he is hyped up I don't think it's enough. He's so fucking strong. He's legit the tankiest unit in the game and he can smack back hard, especially if you put him next to a Lancina. You can pretty much ignore weapon triangle cause this dude's impossible to one shot."

FireEmblemHeroes,ff4rknk,t1_ff4nysm,1579570741.0,"You're gonna get downvoted for this I feel but I honestly agree.

Getting a single premium character isn't that hard even if you never pay for orbs. It's not like you need good IVs or 11 copies or anything, just one. She is seasonal so availability is an issue, but tbh if I start building a Matthew now by the time I get close to +10 there'll be an opportunity for a Lillina probably.

Dew is also extremely valuable as a resource so I'd honestly rather wait to pull for Lillina and put it on something like a Sothe instead that can function in multiple roles."
FireEmblemHeroes,ff4r6dk,t1_ff4g2aq,1579570470.0,"Matthew can do more damage with reverse blade time. He's the best F2P vantage sweeper. Of course if you have a broadleaf fan, characters like Sothe are way better. Saizo functions more like a tank than a vantage sweeper so he's not really considered in the same vein as Matthew."
wholesomememes,ff4p5b8,t1_ff4n33c,1579569070.0,"Inglorious bastards for me. It was especially amazing for me because I didn't know about the whole ""alternate history"" angle before going in, so I thought it was a foregone conclusion that they would fail. And Tarantimo definitely baited you to think that with how incompetent the Americans seemed compared to Chris Waltz' character. But then nope, they just gun down Hitler and it's glorious."
FireEmblemHeroes,ff4mz9s,t1_ff4cgcb,1579567540.0,"I mean there's a spectrum of caring about how good a unit is. It's not always just are you a tier 27 AR player or are you someone who doesn't care at all. Most people are somewhere in the middle.

I want to summon for units that being interesting new mechanics or that I just like the design of, and I like trying to use new units on my AR teams or abyssal map clears, even if realistically I can use Ophelia and 3 dancers to clear every map with no effort.

And honestly by your logic just never use orbs, pretty sure you can hit up to tier 25-26 with just free Eir + Peony.

Plus it's not like feathers, dew, etc are free either. If you're using a +1 or no merge Elli over a F2P archer you now have 220k feathers and 200 dew for another project. It's not like +10 is required for AR usage."
OrderOfHeroes,ff41qfk,t3_enl9dv,1579553643.0,"Depends on build for both: for Zelgius if you plan on not giving him bold fighter, go speed. His best build IMO is actually DC/special fighter/slaying edge+ with speed boon.

Laevatein is better with +atk if you want her to vantage DC, usually in aether raids. Otherwise she's also better +SPD for general usage. But you kinda need fury or some other speed boosting skill to get her to a respectable speed"
FireEmblemHeroes,ff3x011,t1_ff3vp6b,1579550690.0,"Panne....? Huh? I don't see how hers is even close. Nor these mirage weapons.

Best weapons in the game to me are probably refined year 1 brave heroes except Lynn (seriously, these are probably the top 3), NY!Lethe and Selkie's with built in close call, and creator sword with nullify everything. Mareetas sword, L!Alm and Celica's are all also borderline. 

But honestly refined Urvan is by far the best weapon in the game. B!Ike is so fucking disgusting paired with Lancina right now and I don't see him falling off any time soon, % damage reduction essentially scales with power creep."
FireEmblemHeroes,ff3v5gu,t1_ff3l91u,1579549536.0,"She's also really good for AR-O potentially. Slap WoM and GF on her, then use her as the fly in GF sweeper where she'll be guaranteed her stat bonuses.

Though she actually faces competition in that role from Claire and Caeda, who may be better solely for having build in FB, as Tsubasa has super low attack to use HB. Plus someone else may want the seal.

Overall I think Elli is better, firesweep bow is already 5 star locked anyways and she has an insane offensive stat line compared to any unit in the game. Whereas Tsubasa is basically better Claire and Kiria is better Lillina, the F2P alternatives to Elli are way further behind. And Mammori is a green armor so who cares. She's good, so are the rest of them."
FireEmblemHeroes,ff3usfc,t1_ff3msm4,1579549309.0,"Some people play the game for fun or collecting characters not just tier 27 AR lol. Arena isn't even worth mentioning because all you need is score bots anyways. 

And arguably if you can hit somewhere above 21 every week the reward vs cost of hitting tier 27 isn't even worth it. If you just like AR that much, sure only summon mythics. But most people don't play like that. I half assed my AR runs this week cause I'm trying to make a GF team work and it didn't really. I'll lose out on 2 dragonflowers and greils, speaking from a pure pragmatic view I didn't lose anything by not hitting T27."
FireEmblemHeroes,ff3prjr,t1_ff3fsam,1579546219.0,"I'd actually keep repel, close call effect is insane. If you really want the double regnal astra shenanigans just put on times pulse instead."
OrderOfHeroes,ff2kw0n,t1_fevfaxv,1579510882.0,"She's honestly a pretty insane nuker. Her and Eli are the prizes of this banner IMO. She effectively inflicts -9 ATK/RES on her opponents in combat while neutralizing bonuses, and has that absurd 41 attack with a 17 might weapon.

With ATK/RES Solo in her base kit active, she's initiating with effectively 77 atk with a +atk nature no merges using her base kit. Pretty sure she hits waaaay harder than even Lillina. She's make a great AoE spammer if given heavy blade."
AmItheAsshole,ff26k9y,t1_ff0r152,1579495242.0,"I grew up in a town with similar demographics, all my friends in high school were white. When I went to college I ended up being friends with almost all Asians, and now I feel much more connected to other Asian Americans than white people. but I also went to a school that was nearly 40% Asians and in an area very saturated with Asian culture.

Not trying to invalidate your experience bycany means, but just trying to put it out there that everyone's experiences are different and it's not like Asian Americans are always very exclusive and reject ""outsiders""."
FireEmblemHeroes,ff1tma2,t1_ff1oy80,1579485902.0,"I think most people do realize Kronya isn't that insane. If her stats were allocated a bit differently she'd be OP but as it is she's only decent.


I do still like her a lot as a free unit though because she has a niche and is an interesting character unlike units like Travant that are released then forgotten about a week later."

whowouldwin,fet77th,t1_fbur0os,1579372427.0,"Yeah round 3 I feel like you only think that cause you haven't finished the show. I won't spoil anything but it should suffice to say that Yen solos that round IMO as long as she doesn't sit in the open and eat blaster fire for fun, which she wouldn't really do. And portals would be extremely helpful, though I feel like no portal user in fiction ever really utilizes them to their full extent. Baby Yoda is the wild card that could potentially stop Yen, but he wouldn't be the first to attack ever and he can only attack once so even in the best scenario he just buys time.

I think round 2 is also close, Geralt has better stealth and tracking. He'd be more likely to get the surprise attack. And then I think he has the advantage in close quarters. But the CQC advantage also isn't absolute, nor is the stealth/tracking one. So Mando would put up a good fight but I think it's slightly Witcher favored."
cremposting,fep9vkb,t1_fe4gg5i,1579315399.0,"Tbh I think you're overselling Geralt here. He's strong but even in his own universe there's many characters stronger than him. Anything he can do a mistborn can basically do, and more. Most of what he has as an advantage would be immense combat experience, but the raw gap in power is pretty massive."
FireEmblemHeroes,feovkkn,t1_fen147x,1579306345.0,But with a speed check. She'll pass it most of the time but I don't see her being able to deal with your Mareetas and Larceis.

Saying a woman can't win doesn't equate to saying a woman isn't fit to be president or that we shouldn't have a female president. It's pretty stupid to equate that with""Bernie's sexist"" when his entire political career shows the exact opposite. This is so much of a non-scandal manufactured by CNN for views, and shame on Warren too for not shutting this down.

movies,feha7s3,t1_fegtln3,1579112373.0,"Yup. Hit the nail on the head. As an Asian male we have little representation to begin with, and when Asian male actors get cast it's more often than not in comic relief roles where they're made to look like ridiculous caricatures. (Think Ken Jeong in the Hangover)

Bruce is one of the most well respected, serious, and ""badass"" male Asian actors out there so seeing Bruce Lee in that stereotypical Asian role and making him look like a pompous dick definitely did not feel good for me.

B!Ike for example is the best tank unit and best axe unit in the game because his refine is broken. actually all the year 1 brave heroes have absurdly powerful refines that make them worth building except B!Lynn, whos arguably still just very good on her own.

Tharja and Nino are still top tier mages in their own color thanks to their refines and the power of blade tomes. Kagero with high investment is the queen of AR defense.

Also Miyazaki has lots of weird opinions, he made great movies but he's not anime Jesus or anything it's no like anything he says is law.

So for L!Marth, yes. But it kinda depends. Binding shield lets Marth beat all dragons so swapping it out means he might lose to L!Tiki who has color advantage or Sothis who negates Falchion. But repel/close call will vastly improve his matchups vs non dragons. So if you have him at high merges and he's going to fight all enemies then it's worth it, but if you use him as a dedicated dragon Slayer then definitely keep binding shield.

Desperation is waaaaay better than having a conditional swift sparrow IMO. Though one possibility I could see is using sturdy impact with swift sparrow seal, that way she still has decent speed, at 48 I think with +SPD and +10 merges, and she can initiate more safely. But you could also just throw on a +SPD refine to the weapon which honestly might be better, as it allows you to keep desperation and you can use a SPD boosting a skill over sturdy impact to double more consistently.

FireEmblemHeroes,fdj72tf,t1_fdixdd9,1578460290.0,Yeah I kinda wanna pull a Larcei if only to give my Ayra her B skill. Can't fodder Mareetas cause I'm merging her.
FireEmblemHeroes,fdj6hv8,t1_fdj4jwr,1578459811.0,"I feel like there's no way IS is generous enough to give her a close call refine. That'd put her straight back up to tier 1. I'm actually kinda pessimistic about her refine cause I feel like they've not really given good refines except to the bottom tier units, which Ayra certainly is not. I mean look at Leifs refine.

Though I guess it wouldn't really matter since tier 1 infantry sword already has like 50 characters in it."
FireEmblemHeroes,fdj6bn3,t1_fdj4f4v,1578459668.0,"Eh, Ayra still gets the refine bonus stats which is something, and more dragon flowers. I'd say the difference is really not that big tbh.

As a +10 Ayra owner I'm actually much less salty after seeing the stats. And also if Ayra gets a decent refine she'll be right back up there with Larcei."
tifu,fdi10z7,t1_fdhb6zz,1578433827.0,"I feel like employees mostly don't give a fuck at the checkout counter. And a lot of places have self checkout so you can even avoid that interaction. But fuck me if I have to ask someone to get my lube and walk to the front of the store with me, the Safeway near me started locking up the lube so now I buy lube on Amazon. Almost shipped it to my ex last time though....so that was also scary in its own right."
FireEmblemHeroes,fdg3fc3,t1_fdg3c6u,1578378550.0,"Yeah hadn't seen that yet. Was kinda hoping it'd be inheritable tbh because I think it'd help a lot of older units.

But also partly glad it's not as +20 guaranteed damage specials for every fast unit sounds super annoying to deal with."
FireEmblemHeroes,fdg3cbl,t1_fdfo9x2,1578378464.0,"Yeah it actually looks cut and paste...plus she had the same damn kit. She's just better Ayra. Bleh.


Hope Ayra can get a refine soon, sucks when they release units that are strictly better than previous ones. Like yeah Ayras pretty much already been powercrept as early as L!Marth release but at least she still had a unique thing."
FireEmblemHeroes,fdg338x,t1_fdfpkmy,1578378203.0,"I mean she kinda is even without it being inheritable. Loli Ayra literally has a much better PRF with built in slaying, close call basically, and is going to have like 10 extra BST so she'll look like a +10 Ayra at 0 merges."
FireEmblemHeroes,fdg2x0l,t1_fdfs6po,1578378025.0,"Yeah seriously, two of them in one banner too? And right after Mareeta was released?

Like for christs sake make some other weapon type units good."
FireEmblemHeroes,fdg2ddh,t1_fdfrq0b,1578377459.0,"Please no. At least most speedy units are relatively squishy, I do not want to ever see a Brave Ike with the def version of close call."
FireEmblemHeroes,fdg28hr,t1_fdg18na,1578377321.0,Regnal Astra vs. Astra isn't remotely the same thing though so it doesn't really replace Astra. And I feel like it might be because why would they rename the special for Shannan when it does the exact same thing?
FireEmblemHeroes,fdg2267,t1_fdfojaa,1578377143.0,"I really wonder if imperial astra will be inheritable. Put side by side it really seems like it might be, since why would they make two different skill names for the same thing with slightly different descriptions otherwise?


Would actually be huge for a lot of units if it was."
FireEmblemHeroes,fdg1r34,t1_fdftr6n,1578376832.0,Yeah I'm kinda sad. RIP +10 Ayra. Hopefully she gets a refine sometime soon.
politics,fdb1jok,t1_fd9sczl,1578252641.0,"Hey someone's gotta sell weapons and missiles and shit. Who cares if we murdered over 200,000 Iraqi civilians and 4,000 US troops? Think about the poor executives at Raytheon who need to buy their next mcmansion."
FireEmblemHeroes,fdam1w7,t1_fd6az9h,1578247543.0,Yeah Svalin shield in particular would be an insane seal to release. And I don't know if IS will ever do that.
MurderedByWords,fdal7ed,t1_fd9r3ws,1578247329.0,"Yeah that was my first thought. That's a tiny ass house and looks pretty old too, and even if she did go to anbivy, how is getting into a good college considered a bad thing? It'd be one thing if you're like GWB and got in based on daddy then graduated with a 2.2 GPA, but obviously AOC didn't have that kind of connections."
aww,fdaf583,t1_fda3by4,1578245382.0,My kitten was left in a flower pot in front of a shelter before I adopted him :( he was less than 2 weeks old.

FireEmblemHeroes,fczfnp1,t1_fcx1bpq,1578100201.0,I mean it's been definitely unsurped - he isn't even close to B!Ikes level.
FireEmblemHeroes,fczff9e,t1_fcx2t30,1578100058.0,"If Ayra got a close call refine I think she'd be straight up better than Mareeta. Which is why I don't think it'll happen.

Mareeta may have extra stats but there's a reason why Ayra survived as a tier 1 sword unit forever despite being stat creeped by other units many times over."
FireEmblemHeroes,fczcq94,t1_fcx0j1k,1578098296.0,"Tbf Ayra does need a refine though, no one uses her PRF over slaying edge.

And so do all of the DC only weapons, even on Zelgius everyone uses slaying edge nowadays."
FireEmblemHeroes,fczajt4,t1_fcxivvy,1578097016.0,"I think people are used to myrmidons being crazy strong or something? I don't understand it either, the lull skill does make Lethes speed harder to match and close call more consistent on her, but it's not like NFU and solo spectrum made Mareeta easy to deal with."
FireEmblemHeroes,fczabgc,t1_fcxnffe,1578096877.0,"I mean tbf you don't need to match her speed, if you're within 10 then her close effect becomes less ridiculous. And plus most people aren't gonna put DC on her so you can just blow her up with mages given her pitiful resistance. She's a super strong unit but I think a lot of people are overreacting a bit."
OrderOfHeroes,fcz8hrd,t1_fcy6dkc,1578095806.0,"Okay, I have pretty much the same build and use triple mythics with legendary Azura, just taking the slight lift reduction from using her even when it's not water season.

Was curious if you did anything different. I want another vantage sweeper for Astra and thinking of just building another Tharja lmao. I also have a +9 Sothe, unfortunately though I don't have access to broadleaf fan, and I feel like his speed isn't quite there to use red hot ducks. I also only have 2 mythics since I merged my Altinas as they both had atk banes..."
FireEmblemHeroes,fcz3wcz,t1_fcwqpko,1578093146.0,"Yeah, great art but unfortunately even though she yas a big BST boost from regular Eir, the distribution of the extra stats isn't what you'd want it to be. Plus she has no PRF. I'm probably going to just give her dagger to normal Eir like many other people.

Dunno if I'll even level her 5 star version tbh, I don't see myself using her at all."
FireEmblemHeroes,fcy1k40,t1_fcwt20j,1578073433.0,"Yeah he's pretty chonky with his heals and defensive stats. First time I can consistently auto lunatic 7 with one team. So that's going to make this grind much easier.

Dude literally solos the last room which is actually what's making the difference here."
OrderOfHeroes,fcwbjao,t1_fcbpx9a,1578021591.0,How do you build Tharja/what kind of team? I've been merging one up. Is there just simple CC/vantage with a smoke skill?
OrderOfHeroes,fcwazcu,t1_fcb35x1,1578021226.0,"Lol didn't he also suggest Eir as the best tank, an unit with sub 20 def even at +10?

Yeah no I'll ignore his advice. Plus that vid is outdated, best tank in the game now is B!Ike easily. I personally use Mareeta has a semi-omega tank, she can proc sol every combat basically and close calls super strong. She'll obviously get blasted by blue mages, but that's why we use multiple teams.

I've been in tier 21+ for a long time though so probably none of my strats are optimal since I don't care thaaat much about getting tier 27 every week."
