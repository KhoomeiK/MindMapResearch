The only thing I don't like about gentoo, other than compile times, is using other distros and questioning myself whether I need to do anything else after an upgrade. Because I enjoy manually making sure the kernel will show in the bootloader etc."

progun,ff9zisq,t1_ff9no1a,1579724836.0,"If you purely look at protests, you could be correct in your assumption. Idk though, I'm sure I could dig up examples of non-peaceful protests from the right. But mainly the point that I want to make is to not completely demonize the extremists on the otherside without being aware of the extremists on your side. The guy who rammed his car into protestors. The Oklahoma city bombing. The Walmart shooting in El Paso. Etc. Because they are definitely there. 

I have a theory that the reason for the more peaceful protests from the tight stems from not only them having more power  currently than the left, but also a better awareness of violence from the right. Meaning, ccw holders and gun rights activists have a better understanding of when it is appropriate to use lethal force and are therefore more well behaved because of it. Most of the left have never actually thought about these things or are at least under the false assumption that they won't be fired upon unless they are brandishing a weapon greater than a knife."
progun,ff9mb2v,t1_ff8h12s,1579715984.0,I don't know about that man. The extreme right is responsible for the Oklahoma city bombing on top of many other atrocities. Don't think it's just the other side in its extreme form that are susceptible to cause violence.
StreetEpistemology,ff7dqhc,t1_ff788rh,1579647194.0,"I think given the context, being devastated at the desecration of a loved ones corpse is a completely normal reaction. I believe a desecration of a corpse is inherently immoral. However, consent and personal choices come in to play. If that is what you want and have agreed to, who am I to say that you can't? But I think it would cause more harm to those closest to you then it would benefit other people, and I think their wishes in regards to what to do with your corpse should come in to play and be discussed before you let strangers fuck your corpse and then eat you. If you feel that your corpse is merely an empty vessel, and that since you are dead you don't care what people do to your body, I think you should have a conversation with those that are left behind with your remains that might feel an attachment to it. 

If cannibalism were a social norm, burying someone could be considered a strange craving within that context. I feel that the whole purpose of funerals and burials are more to do with the grieving and allowing family and friends to mourn, than the dead themselves. If their society chooses to mourn their dead by eating them, I don't think it would be right to bury them. But allowing a stranger to eat them isn't for the benefit of the grieving, it's only benefit is for the stranger who probably has no connection whatsoever to the dead."
StreetEpistemology,ff7a1ao,t1_ff7324j,1579644272.0,"The quickest most easily accessible way to see how grey morality can be is the trolley problem or contemplating whether it's ok to torture someone who won't tell you where a ticking bomb is that will decimate an entire city. 

Personally, I don't think I have an answer about what I think about morality. I don't think using a societal consensus on morality is ideal considering slavery, killing witches, etc. Which implies the possibility there could be an objective morality underneath societal norms, but I don't believe that to be true either. It's been a long time since I have really thought about the categorical imperative and all the vast different deep avenues that you can you down trying to come to a conclusion."
StreetEpistemology,ff765vc,t1_ff72kmh,1579641894.0,"Personally, I'd feel extremely upset knowing me or my loved one's corpse was being used in such a manner. Them being the skull in hamlet, or having their skeleton displayed seems much more acceptable to me because there is a certain amount of respect given to their remains. 

I can't imagine mourning over a loved one's death, knowing that they are going to take their remains and fuck it and then eat it. Someone who I love, that I have spent years with, someone that is a part of me, someone who helped shape me into a better person, someone I experienced good and bad significant experiences with. Like that is just an extreme unnecessary pain that you are making those closest to you deal with so that a few people that you don't know can satisfy a very strange craving."
StreetEpistemology,ff6z6z0,t3_ers8zm,1579637908.0,"Some claim that there can be such a thing as an objective morality. That you could actually figure out whether something was moral or not by taking into regards the total amount of ""good"" or the total amount of ""bad"" it gives to society while also recognizing personal rights so you don't go full utilitarian about it. Sam Harris believes this to be true. I used to think it was possible, but now I think there is way too much grey for there to be an objective truth about morality."
StreetEpistemology,ff6z4id,t1_ff5tigo,1579637867.0,What about a necrophiliac wanting to have sex with your corpse after you died? What about someone who just wants your head so they can have it mounted and put in their living room?
