AskReddit,ff1vroz,t1_ff1st40,1579487280.0,"Not all of the true crime community is like that, although it may seem that way on the surface. 

I listen to true crime podcasts because they're very interesting to me. I don't romanticize evil and/or insane people that do horrible things, and I don't want people to go missing never to be seen again. 

I am curious about the situation, the court cases, seeing how a mystery that seems totally bizarre or unsolvable can be pieced together.

I definitely do not fetishize criminals or those that hurt people

Also, the true crime community does do good things. They help to raise awareness for cases that might not be in the spotlight anymore.

I actually just listened to a podcast episode about a couple who lost their daughter to a bad person. Years had gone by, and they had run into financial trouble trying to find answers for their daughter. They had planted a tree for her in their yard that they cherished very much, but they were going to lose their house. 

Partially due to a true crime writer, word got out about this, and the community raised money for them. They eventually were able to find someone willing to buy the house and allow them to continue living in it, and continue caring for and feeling the peace of their daughter's tree.


If I've changed your mind at all, consider listening to the Casefile podcast. They do an excellent job, and always talk about the victim, who they were, what kind of person they were, and how they impacted the world"
