circlebroke2,ffhn5dw,t1_ffgk1ml,1579943376.0,"The problem is run away capitalism and marketing constantly bombarding you, creating endless feeling of inadequacy. Creating problems and selling you the solutions. You're not pretty enough, you're not thin enough, muscular or whatever. 

I know I had my lowest points when I was looking for job and didn't know if I could make rent next month, well now I have a job again and I am 'successfully' living paycheck to paycheck praying nothing bad happens, but every now and then i look at one extension cord on the floor that I started calling 'The Escape Plan' and I ask myself: Wouldn't I be better off dead? 
Cause I hate living like this. I spend most of my time in work that I hate, hoping to earn some cash so I can do something I like in my free time, but then I realize that after paying rent, bills and food there is barely anything left. 

Tldr: Life sucks I wish my parents used birth control."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fexzru1,t3_eqmyjd,1579438905.0,"Rent is 40 % of my budget. If I did not eat out I would save less than 50€ cause I would still have to eat something else. So people who say budget will save me are telling me to spend nothing on myself and just exist increasing my net worth by absurdly small amount of cash each month, while top management and shareholders rake it in and I cannot save enough for mortgage downpayment in years. The so called job creators buying up real estate without even living in it just letting it sit empty for years so they can turn a profit."
DiscoElysium,feumdjf,t1_fetrgj8,1579387910.0,Yeah in game there are only few options but they should help a bit. I had about 20 fps on 1280x720.

DiscoElysium,fepvxd9,t3_eqc0qv,1579333230.0,Your laptop should have Intel® HD Graphics 620 and core 3 processor I think it should be possible. My 2in1 has HD 520 and i7 and I played it during christmas on it without any issues. Turn all graphics options down and you'll be fine.

Thankfully I am a big boy now so if I don't want to see him I don't have to. Have not met him in years. Hooray."
worldnews,fcytgut,t3_ejhhsd,1578086722.0,Well Americans been drone murdering shepherds and wedding guests for like 15 years now. I guess that wasn't really doing so they decided that assassination of some VIPs will spice things up a bit.

I cannot see how this could cause any good outcome and certainly I cannot see how this increased security of any US official anywhere. The opposite is true I would say. 

Donald Trump is truly the stupidest idiot in charge of any country on this planet. I cannot believe that Americans voted in someone so extraordinarily corrupt and dumb. And we the rest of the world can only watch in horror what will this absolute moron do next time."
