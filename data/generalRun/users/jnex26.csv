sysadmin,fc3we9t,t3_efwwvi,1577400347.0,"There are a few classes of people in this situation. 

* 1 those that see the path ahead and jump ship, because it is prudent 
* 2 those that wait it out either because they are swallowing the management line or don't have the transferrable skills 
* 3 those that are waiting for the payout 

I have done all three at some point in my career 

1. It really does not hurt to jump early.... Just don't do it too often
2. A Nasty shock waits these people 
3. The payout ain't that great goto option 1 


In general just run it seems those people with the essential and much needed skills will leave early to on, watch them if they are being pressed upon to continue to take on more and more it normally it not a great sign"
