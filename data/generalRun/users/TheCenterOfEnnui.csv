Orlando-Good!

Tampa Bay-Good! You might want to add in a trip to Busch Gardens since you have kids. It's super fun for kids. Clearwater is not as ""scientology"" as hear, but you'd be on St Pete Beach anyway and it's not there at all. If you're at St Pete Beach, there'd be no real reason to go up to Clearwater. Just stay at St Pete Beach.

Skip Boca. No real reason to go there. 

There's not much for kids in Key West. And the keys are awesome....BUT...not much for kids unless you plan on going fishing or snorkeling.The beaches in the keys suck.

Miami-Good stuff. Add in the Seaquarium. Wynwood is OK but it's not a major thing. 

Everglades-Do an airboat tour. 

Cape Coral-Meh, I guess you're going but not much to do in that area except go out to Sanibel Island (which is awesome). If you make it over there, hit up the Bubble Room. Kids will love it and the food is super. Get the red velvet cake."

todayilearned,few3pw2,t1_fevui0s,1579404912.0,"> we (Americans under 40) have been taught the metric system for years in science class throughout middle and high school. We do know how to use it

You said this, which is pretty much the notion that all Americans know all aspects of the metric system, at least in an everyday sense.

Whatever, who cares? I sometimes wonder why people get worked up over this. What we do works. What other countries do works too. The UK uses freaking stones as a measure. Does it work for them? I guess...so good. What we do works too. Good."
todayilearned,few2zgt,t1_fevy0gp,1579404730.0,I remember when I thought I knew everything and felt it was my place to tell others how they should think.
todayilearned,fevuape,t1_fevruty,1579401593.0,"OK that's fine but your point that all Americans know all aspects of metric isn't really correct.

And who cares anyway. We use Imperial with some metric here and there. It works just fine."

Yeah, the top 25 or so seniors....if I'm their agent, I'm not letting them near that game."

If you think it might help you move from 2nd round to first; actually get drafted; etc...sure....but if you  know you're going to go high in the draft, why risk injury? There are guys in that game looking to prove themselves that will go all out. Some DE that is a marginal 6/7 rounder is going to come hard at a guy like Burrow. If the LT protecting his backside doesn't try hard....he could get creamed."
