But well, I don't think it's unrealistic to have a couple online friends you talk to every once in a while. It's not like you have to talk to them every day, and keep them updated about everything. I don't think social media, although it creates that idea that we are keeping up with people, creates strong relationships just by sharing information."

offmychest,fewmxty,t3_eqstg9,1579415167.0,"To be honest, being afraid for the future of the relationship makes sense and is one thing. B him not wanting to bother to visit you because ""he doesn't like to travel alone"" is far more worrying, if the issue isn't money for him. I think you may have to rethink where this relationship is standing currently."
AmItheAsshole,feu58sx,t1_fetym7f,1579383247.0,"I am nowhere near an expert on this, but I agree with your point. In a court of Justice there's no way I could prove he is doing anything illegal with enough certainty to, and I can't be certain of that here either, other than he said in another comment he is pricing bellow cost, pretty straightforwardly. 

It's true, that legal there'd still be the issue of whether or not he will end up suprapricing after killing the competition.... I have no way to know that. But he seems pretty confident it makes sense to do this now from a business perspective. He is not getting vengeance on anyone, but is doing a sound business strategy to later on gain more money, I assume, suprapricing his consumers... That is definitely TA, although I agree again that unless one can show analyzing his market that in all likelihood he will viably be able to supracharge later the case would not stand in the US.

On price-fixing: I don't mean I expect him to raise prices to let that woman's business live, much less talk to her about it. But if he is pricing bellow cost, that's illegal, and he should raise prices to above his costs.

AmItheAsshole,fetkf21,t1_fetfcbv,1579376335.0,"Predatory pricing is illegal in the US, because what it means is that one is temporary lowering his price bellow his own cost which is unsustainable and an anti-competitive activity since the goal there is to bankrupt competition. Therefore, low prices in predatory pricing stems not from higher productivity but simply higher cash availability to lower your price bellow your own cost for long enough to starve out smaller competition. What  everyone is asking is not for him to increase princes so she can survive, but for his prices to be in a healthy level above his costs. Predatory pricing law doesn't protect HER (his competition), it protects the customers by protecting ""competition"" in the general sense. 

I admit I'm assuming, though, that his costs are above his current price, but I think that's a reasonable assumption because he said he can keep them there ""for a while"". That means he couldn't keep them at the current rate ""forever"", which would be the case if he was simply pricing lower because he is more efficient than others.

Price-fixing, on the other hand, would be setting the price at a level higher than normal, which is also illegal and anti-competitive, and not at all the opposite to predatory pricing. The opposite to both is a competitive free market, actually, with predatory pricing leading usually to a monopoly while price-fixing leads to an oligopoly. 

Let's just reiterate that predatory pricing is, in fact, illegal in the US, although it's something that's very hard to prove in court, and it is acknowledged to be harmful to the consumers. The only problem is that it's hard for an outsider, like a court of Justice, to differentiate real low cost from predatory pricing... That's why the courts in the US have traditionally put high thresholds for such cases (something that has been a focus of contention more recently, nonetheless, including due to Wal-Mart for example). Fortunately, though, here it's the business owner who is telling us he is undercutting his prices and selling for a rate he can keep ""for a while"" but not forever... So the ""reasonable doubt"" that a court would have and their reason for being skeptic of applying the law, doesn't apply in our ""judgment"" here."
AmItheAsshole,fet7si6,t1_fet6k3t,1579372519.0,"He said elsewhere he is undercutting prices and can do it for a while. That means, clearly, he is selling at a loss waiting for others to bankrupt and then raise his prices. No one is expecting him to collude with a competitor, just follow the law and not do predatory pricing."
AmItheAsshole,fet55k5,t1_fet0iu2,1579371892.0,"It isn't illegal if his price is lower because he is more efficient, but he says he is ""undercutting prices"" and ""can do it for a while"". That means, in English, that you are selling BELLOW COST."

AmItheAsshole,fep4ddd,t1_fep2rod,1579311865.0,"Well, considering even most experts have trouble with this issue of Jewishness, as shown by the recent census controversy, the fact that you mixed both is probably what caused her poor reaction and conflation of you raising your children as fully Jewish with white washing.

If she understands being Jew as an ethnicity (a white ethnicity) no wonder she feels that's white washing. I think you should separate the religion and the ethnicity there, as your children are ""ethnically"" half Jewish and half black, but religiously fully Jewish (being raised Jewish). If you explain it to her in those terms, it might be more acceptable to her (expect I suppose the religion part ahaha).

I also think that the whole discussion about whether being born from a Jewish mother is or not sufficient to make someone a part of the Jewish community doesn't matter here, in my view, and is superfluous from her point of view. It's simply about how different Jewish groups acknowledge who belongs or not to their group, and, to her, as an outsider, it has no meaning. One could also use the one drop rule and say your children are fully black, but again, I don't think that is a discussion that'd be helpful here. I'd just stick to the ""they are being raised as members of the Jewish religion"" part, and the ""we are also sharing your family (black christian) traditions, but without the religious elements"", along with the ""our children are half black, half jewish/white"" parts."

Advice,felu5am,t1_fek9cvj,1579231002.0,"Dude, he's being petty. I don't have close friends that do that so I don't know how to react I'd not text him, though, I'd talk face to face at least that part on how he is behaving. And I'd only do that if, after you apologize, he tries to guilt trip you. So if you apologize honestly (dude, I'm sorry, and I hope you can forgive me and we can go back to normal kind of situation) and he forgives you, I'd let that go. If he asks for time I'd leave it for now and wait to see if he continues sharing your secrets. If he tries to guilt trip you or continues to share your secrets THEN I'd mention that to him but not to be aggressive, more just like ""dude, I'm really sorry for that, but you also started to give away my secrets after that. Can't we get over it? I'm apologizing because I want to be friends with you etc"" and then if he's really aggressive, only then and knowing the possible consequences, would I attack him saying he is being hypocritical or something. Because diffusing the situation is the best specially since your mistake kind of started it... He's still behaving a bit like a kid, but if you value his friendship you have to walk around his flaws and hope he values you enough to do the same I guess."

Advice,fek7mcg,t3_epm0ke,1579194292.0,"He didn't do the same thing, he did the same thing *out of vengeance*. He has all the right to be pissed, but not to say he might not be able to trust you again and then be untrustworthy. He was hypocritical doing that, and his excuse (being pissed) is far more of a character flaw than yours (being drunk). I'd say you should try to talk to him eventually, and be honest and say you know you were wrong and you are sorry. Then, if he tries to guilt trip you, tell him he did basically the same, but for vengeance but you want to keep the friendship and are willing to move on.
