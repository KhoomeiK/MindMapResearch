vfx,ff54lyq,t1_ff4j32m,1579580085.0,"are you saying that there is a physical difference between blacks and other races like whites and asians? and that that is why the NBA is 80% black?

and it's almost like you're saying that handicapped people shouldn't be allowed in the nba.

how backwards of you. when will we learn that we can't put results over people.

we should not rest until we have limbless people and midgets slam dunking in the nba. basic human dignity demands it."
vfx,ff40n0t,t1_ff3qhfc,1579552961.0,">Finally, this phrase: “However I've never seen in this industry to promote people based on their sex/gender until now.” This is historically not true. VFX for a really long time was predominantly male from artists up to executives, and to ignore that is just as harmful as the practices you’re talking about.

that's bullshit. were men promoted BASED ON SEX? or ability and talent? historically, have there been a legion of women vfx artists that have been shut out despite superior skills? where's your proof?

and yeah, they're primarily male. SO WHAT? romance fiction is primarily female. is that a problem? the nba is 80% black. is that a problem?

just because there's a numerical disparity does not mean that it's ""harmful"" or malicious.

ffs."
vfx,ff408ys,t3_erfx6d,1579552717.0,we need more whites and asians in the nba too. also midgets. nba is very very biased against the hiring of midgets. when will we see a peter dinklage of the nba?

i think you are missing the point here."

and as we know from the zeitgeist, any gender imbalance is proof positive that there is sexism at work."
vfx,fcvxhnc,t1_fcvq9sl,1578012332.0,"yeah but that's if the unprocessed footage is in the ballpark. if it's RAW footage that's totally grey or desaturated or something that looks awful/wrong if you don't do anything to it, then trying to match vfx to THAT would be a mistake.

if they don't provide final(ish) grade, then you at least have to CC to ""looks good / no style"" before you add fx."
