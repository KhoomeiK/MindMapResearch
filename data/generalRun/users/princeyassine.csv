average_redditor,fdigd1f,t1_fdidplo,1578442289.0,"Sure, being sex positive is the assertion that any sexual activity conducted between consenting adults is positive and neednt be shamed, and that shaming is ultimately damaging. Obviously variables here can include what an ""adult"" is, however that variance can apply to more traditional couplings so let's consider that a wash between our positions. Additionally ""any sexual activity"" can be twisted to include truly divergent sexual activity that could still be considered to be between consenting adults. However those activities are constrained by laws and apply to both traditional and non-traditional sexual activity, so let's consider that a wash as well.

Being sex negative is the predilection to shame those who are engaging in consentual and lawful sex simply because it takes some form that is offensive to the judeo-chtistian ideal. Which I believe is what you were doing by seeing your shame in this woman's face, doubly so since she is smiling in the photo and looks to be a consenting adult to the proceedings.

Your concerns though don't stem from secular reasoning, you presuppose some sort of collective retribution for engaging in these types of behavior. Whether that takes the form of fire and brimstone or some sort of erosion of the social fabric. Both concerns of course coming strictly from your religious points of view.

Since I can't argue against fire and brimstone since that is from God and therefore unprovable as well as indefensible. I will reiterate what I said before (though not in response to you), human coupling has taken many forms. Where these forms represented the ""norm"" for those people for their time. And yet humanity survived...

If you need religion to sleep at night, more power to you, the problem with this is when you need religion for the rest of us, to sleep at night. Which I categorically reject.

Hey we can go on forever, we are never going to convince each other of anything. You would never refute any of your religious teachings despite what I or anyone else would say. And I don't believe in the unassailable truth of your or any religion that have ever existed.

See ya on the other side ;)"
average_redditor,fdiddsf,t1_fdi8rpw,1578440357.0,"Right his ""secular"" claim, thats his religious claim made more down to earth. Would any reasonable person believe that 3somes can lead to social destabilization. The very definition of what constitutes a sexual/romantic relationship throughout human history has been in incessant flux. His reasoning for this view stems from the religious teaching that the coupling between a man and a woman represents the fundamental and solely permissible form of human coupling. And you can go read my aforementioned post about why introducing religion effectively ends this debate. Jeez, you people are a collection of slack jawed ninnies, and don't white knight this guy, it makes you look pathetic."
average_redditor,fdhnlxo,t1_fdhk5m6,1578426451.0,"We really don't need to go further into any sort of reasoning because your position is irrational. Believing in something ""because the Church said so"" is the opposite of critical reasoning, despite dressing up your point of view as if you are making a cogent argument. You are just revealing yourself to be a head in the sand religious moralist. I can't persuade you otherwise because you literally believe your position is commanded by God. Which you could never prove but that I can never disprove. I suggest you live your life where you experience needless guilt whereas I won't."
average_redditor,fdhhy2m,t1_fdhh9z9,1578423021.0,So that's being sex negative. You are conflating positive sexuality with moral corruption which is toxic and frequently a self defeating point of view.

relationships,fc7th1t,t3_egff0l,1577518203.0,"I don't know, she doesnt need to go overseas if she wants to cheat on you. So if you are OK with them being alone domestically, what's the difference really? It would seem more consistent if you were to say that you are not comfortable them seeing each other at all. But even then if she really is intent on cheating on you, no agreement you have with her will matter. And she can find anyone to do that with and not just this person you are focusing on. My point is if you trust her than trust her, if you don't than there is weakness in your relationship. A weakness that should be more your focus in rectifying and not who she vacations with."

relationships,fc2u1he,t3_efwgi2,1577374031.0,"Not knowing how this was delivered and the tenor of your relationship makes evaluating this difficult. You could have been massively misreading the connection. Assuming though it was as you described, I think this is a bit of bad luck with someone who obviously assumed romantic intent. It's unfortunate she didn't want to try to come to an understanding about what happened and having her boyfriend come to the rescue like that is pretty unprofessional, moreso since a threatening text accomplishes nothing. Though the relationship is over, the inspiration doesn't have to be, I'd say try to use that if you think it can help you better your life. And treat this as a lesson to use more discretion in the office space."
