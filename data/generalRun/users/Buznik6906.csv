The trouble is you're presenting your argument as if just taking WoW away is the grand answer to all the kid's problems when it's WAY more complicated than that. I can guarantee you that both as someone with a background in Psychology and as someone who played way too much WoW as a kid. 

If you want to solve a problem, ESPECIALLY a psychological one, you need to understand the root cause and address things from there. That might involve making the kid go cold turkey, but it might not. The only people qualified to make that call are psychological professionals who get to sit and properly talk to the kid. How OP accomplishes that is going to be on them, since we're all just yahoos on the internet and don't actually know the kid or how he'll react to any given approach."
classicwow,ffa8urp,t1_ffa65zt,1579730142.0,"It's not healthy, but just cutting access completely without addressing the root of the problem basically never works because you haven't addressed the problem, you've just prevented easy access to the kid's main fix. If you want a stunning example of how it doesn't work just look at stories of Prohibition and alcoholism.

The first step to fixing the problem is figuring out what the problem IS, which is why if you went to a doctor about your sore ankle they would ask you questions about the ankle: what happened; what part of it hurts; how long has it been like this etc. They wouldn't just tell you to stop being a little bitch and go run around on it for a while.

Once OP knows WHY the kid is playing this much they can take steps to address the root cause. It might be addiction, it might be something else that the kid is using Classic to deal with in an unhealthy way. The treatment for those things is wildly different, and NEITHER of them is solved by just ""take away the computer lol"".

If addiction is the problem then the best way to solve it is to show the kid the myriad ways it's fucking his life up and make him WANT to change that, otherwise he just sees it as unfair punishment and feels justified in wanting it back and potentially finding ways to sneak around the ban.

If what looks like addiction is actually a manifestation of something else (maybe depression, maybe not) then he'll just replace Classic with some other coping mechanism which has a good chance of being EVEN WORSE for him. At least Classic doesn't cause your teeth to fall out."

rpghorrorstories,fexta21,t1_fexqrh2,1579435656.0,"Flying MIGHT make you the number 1 target for ranged enemies, but that all depends on the current situation with the melee; the party composition; and what role the flyer is filling. 

If the flying party member is a Sorcerer raining fire down on chunks of the enemy then it's logical to try and take that threat out first, but what if the flyer is a ranger who's taking shots and doing damage but the party also has a caster who's taking groups of enemies out of the fight completely? At that point the flyer is a nuisance but it's easily in their best interests to break the caster's concentration and get their numbers back up.

When you add an element like flight to a given encounter then it either becomes the focus of the encounter or it gives the flying creature a crazy advantage since a good chunk of the enemy are powerless against them, and designing basically every encounter around dealing with a flying unit is annoying and restrictive. How do you give the party a cool encounter against a dire bear when the ranger can just plink it from the sky until it dies without the rest of the party being involved?"
rpghorrorstories,fexqi7k,t1_fexo4jr,1579434725.0,"Spending a spell slot on solving a problem is at least a resource cost, if not a huge one, plus depending on the party setup they might not even have access to those particular spells. 

As for combat ranged stuff doesn't ""counter"" flight, it just stops it being an outright immunity. The only real vulnerability being airborne causes is not being able to take cover, but if the fight is taking place out in the open there might not even be any cover to use properly. If the fight takes place on a wide street or whatever then the question is not ""Do I leave myself open to ranged attacks to avoid melee stuff?"", the question is ""Do I want to be immune to melee while getting shot at anyway?""

If d&d took a cue from Fire Emblem and had flight bring explicit vulnerabilities with it then it might have been different, but by RAW I think it's too powerful to be a race benefit without some serious limitations."
rpghorrorstories,fexngzc,t1_fexlfkb,1579433669.0,"Sure, but the spells you get that can rewrite reality and solve problems on insane scales are way down the line. Getting to just fly for free forever at level 1 is kind of insane. Mobility is SO powerful in d&d both in and out of combat that I'm still a bit cagey about having Fly be a 3rd level spell. Think about all the times you've been faced with a terrain problem and wished you had someone who could just fly to that switch over there and solve the problem for you, then you had to think of some clever solution to get across the gap or up onto the ledge or whatever. Having someone who can just fly at will hamstrings the DM a LOT when coming up with interesting challenges that don't involve initiative and crossbows.

Flight is also one of those things that can just break combat if overused unless steps are taken to balance it or prevent it's use in the first place, and if you do THAT too much then the player(s) can feel like you're picking on them. Players want to use the cool stuff they can do, not just spend day after day inside castles and caves wishing they could go outside and be cool again."

We all convened in the computer lab at the agreed time ON time (which I didn't yet appreciate for the miracle it was) and took turns punching the results into the sheet, only took a minute or two each since it wasn't complicated stuff. Then the girl who had nominally taken charge of proceedings said ""Okay everyone, we need to get the average of <stat> for each bit of data. Calculators out, I'll take the top 6!"" The rest of the group started reaching for their bags and I was standing there dumbfounded. I said to them ""...Why? It's in a spreadsheet. Here, move over.""

If it's in gear then it doesn't have much room to move. It's the difference of a good few inches and it takes less than a second to check.

HotDQ is on rails the whole way for the major plot beats but once it drops the party in the location they're supposed to be and establishes the premise it does have some flexibility in the approach they can take. The first chapter lands them in a town in pretty dire straits and has about 8 different set pieces for them to take on in reasonably flexible order if you want to run it that way. Later dungeons aren't completely linear either. Just don't expect to do anything out of order or go on a field trip away from the track unless the DM is really changing things up."

At one point Michael and Harry are having a disagreement and Michael sighs, says to Harry ""Why is it when I talk about Faith you always assume I'm talking about Religion?""

From the first time we encounter Bianca Butcher makes it clear that the power of Faith in the Dresdenverse doesn't come from the subject of that faith, it comes from the believer. That's why Harry's medallion can repel vampires, the medallion itself isn't special but it's an icon of something Harry believes in with all his heart.

It doesn't go quite as far as the Tome of Bill series where there were instances of people who were so confident in their own worth they literally became their own icons of faith, but the power is in the believer pretty much regardless of the belief."
