EDanonymemes,fffz3l7,t1_ffevvux,1579894946.0,"I actually HAD to start drinking diet Coke bc I started developing insulin resistance (very slowly, I was symptomatic months/years before my labs showed it) and now I can’t stand regular Coke or Pepsi unless it’s cherry flavored. Even then, I only really have sugary drinks if I need to get my blood sugar up ASAP. I do like Mexican Coca Cola though, but I rarely have it."

Where I was there was a place for YAs, a place for adults, and a place for geriatric patients (a ward for dementia and a ward for without).
