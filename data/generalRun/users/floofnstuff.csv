I’m glad you posted this so our first time quitters here at least know there is risk with even one puff. I didn’t know that, but tbh I can’t say I wouldn’t have pushed my luck anyway:D"

stopsmoking,fguetfi,t3_f0i8em,1581119054.0,"I know exactly what you mean because it happened to me too. I had no idea just a few puffs and it was game over. I naively thought that just one wouldn't do anything. Oh nooo, quite wrong.

I didn't have 9 years smoke free but I almost 4 years. Amazing how cunning addiction is.

Congratulations on quitting again!"
