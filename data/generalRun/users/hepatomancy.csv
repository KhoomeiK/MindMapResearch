im still friends with two of the people ive dated and ive talked to them about this and they say theyre not upset and they dont blame me for it, which is comforting i guess."

Psychosis,ff8j645,t3_es5txg,1579680926.0,feels like someone talking nonsense close to me in the room. its caused me to jump and look around quite a few times.
BPD,ff8iz3u,t3_es582f,1579680653.0,"i joke around a lot about being some lovesick victorian boy because of how dramatically i feel everything. when im upset i need to lie down because i feel like im suddenly running a fever and im about to faint. 

when my bf dumped me i thought i was actually going to die, my heart hurt so so badly i thought it was gonna give out."
SuicideWatch,ff8ikg0,t3_es3lm9,1579680118.0,"most ways of dying involve pain of some kind, pain is as much of an inevitability in death as it is in life. 

ive found a way thats pretty quick and relatively painless that im fixated on, but its rather complicated and time constricted, so its kind of a win/win on either dying pretty painlessly or not being able to go through with it and staying alive for another year."
BPD,ff4a70k,t3_erfpv9,1579558909.0,"ive been changing it about once or twice a year since college but in high school id change it at least once a month, if not every other week or so. i started dying my hair when i was around 8/10 so i havent had my natural color since then and i hate it when people suggest it.

i dont have anything against brown hair on others but for me its just so boring and plain."
BPD,ff3stig,t3_erezq7,1579548090.0,"i look at my behavior and its just, god, i feel like if i were worse id be some kind of creep from a thriller or whatever haha. its really bad, i have to constantly remind myself and work to tone down the crazy."
BPD,ff3rv7h,t3_erfsk6,1579547504.0,"yeah its. not fun. im ugly and im hard to even enjoy being around because im a lot and i cant or wont tone myself down to appeal to people. when someone genuinely choses me, to date or to get close to, its usually because they feel bad for me or wanna fix me, and they quickly realize im too much and want out. 

funny enough, from what the other comments were saying, the only person whos ever wanted me in a relationship way because they actually loved me, and that im still very close to despite everything is a woman. im a gay man so thats not really gonna work out."
BPD,ff3r73z,t3_erc86h,1579547095.0,"its to protect myself from getting hurt again. if i can hate someone and push them away first, i dont have to deal with them abandoning me and rejecting me."

selfharm,ff1udzl,t3_er53ka,1579486401.0,"put pressure against them until they stop bleeding, when they do carefully clean them with (preferably unscented) soap. if youve been cutting deeper, its good to get some butterfly bandaids to help keep them closed. thatll help prevent bigger scars, let them heal faster, and protect against infection. 

its useful to make an emergency first aid kit, just in case. getting some gauze and some sanitized pads is good if they wont stop bleeding, and to help protect the cuts against getting irritated & reopening, as well as keeping them clean. 

id also recommend getting normal bandaids and some polysporin to help with infection. deeper cuts are more prone to infection, even if you take close care of them. 

sorry if i ended up ranting a bit, please stay safe."
selfharm,ff1sk4j,t3_er3w8b,1579485233.0,styro or deeper these days. i used to cut shallower but i hadnt cut in over a year and something really bad happened and i really want it to scar and i like when it aches afterwards a bit.

selfharm,ff1rvbv,t3_er5r1k,1579484797.0,"the best way to tell someone ive found is to just find a time when theyre not busy or you two are hanging out and ask if they have time to talk about something personal and serious. 

if its easier you can always text them about it, telling someone about it can get really emotional really fast, and its often easier to text people things than to tell them in person. 
really how you tell them is up to you, but i personally find it better to just tell them outright and talk about it from there. 

good luck, im hoping the best for you ♥️"
selfharm,ff1qws6,t3_er5l8n,1579484206.0,"a couple years ago i got the courage to go to a shaving store and get some good quality double sided razors, ive been using that ever since. a lot sharper & cleaner & therefore safer than whatever sharp things i could scrounge up before. 

i liked branding a lot too since its a sharp intense pain that fades pretty quickly but i lost the things i used to do it with."
BPD,ff1hoxs,t3_er3tga,1579479398.0,ive been going through a bad time and honestly being able to talk to people on here has helped...
Psychosis,ff0hpc5,t3_eqsiio,1579468952.0,"i used to get the whole ‘bugs crawling under my skin’ thing before meds, as well as feeling like someone was breathing on my neck, little things like that"
SuicideWatch,fewp7qt,t3_eqp6ad,1579417411.0,"i wish i could but lack of resources keeps me stuck. admittedly i fantasize a lot about taking a handful of belongings and clothes and driving hours to some small rural town somewhere and getting a job as a waiter and just becoming a new person with a new name, and vanishing again when i get tired of that. 

unfortunately i think in this day and age its a lot harder to up and vanish."
BPD,fewnubj,t3_eqrdtd,1579416182.0,"it feels like such a cruel joke, this obsession was born from abandonment and a deep seeded fear of further abandonment and yet it scares and drives people away. despite this i still cant help myself."
selfharm,fen8u8t,t3_epvkrr,1579279493.0,"nah, i dont count simply because ive never tried to quit. i stopped for about a year because of my now ex, but it was less about me and more about making him happy."
SuicideWatch,felqi9o,t3_eprnee,1579228476.0,"oof, i feel you. my bf dumped me because he never actually had feelings for me and he only felt bad for me, im admittedly still not over it. do you have any friends you can vent to? ive found that being angry at my ex helps, being angry feels better than being miserable. 

if theres anything i can really tell you, you deserved someone better than someone who just lied about loving you."
BPD,felpi6z,t3_ept15u,1579227779.0,i have mommy and daddy issues and its not a sexual thing but i find im constantly trying to find new parents in older people. getting attention and validation from them is really really nice.
selfharm,felp0oq,t3_epoa9u,1579227445.0,i know its a bit late but do you have any butterfly bandages? itll help keep the wound closed and will heal up better.
selfharm,felohyg,t3_epshyi,1579227088.0,"is there a specific reason you self harm? is it just for the pain or do you need to see blood/an injury afterwards, anything like that?"
BPD,felo615,t3_epo6vl,1579226862.0,"im so so so paranoid of being used by people that ill overanalyze any small shred of kindness as someone trying to take advantage of me, and due to my history with being used i automatically assume people have bad intentions. i have to actively keep finding reasons why theyre not manipulating me, that theyre just being kind because theyre a kind person. 

however, if that person is my fp i stop giving a shit and thats when things get unpleasant. i would tear myself apart if it would make them happy and want to be close to me."
SuicideWatch,felnig4,t3_epmh3y,1579226412.0,"i know my cousin and one of my exes do genuinely love and care for me, for their sake id rather just be declared as missing rather than them knowing i killed myself. kinda feels more merciful that way for them, they dont have to feel guilty that they ‘didnt do enough’ for me."
SuicideWatch,fed1sej,t3_eoc598,1578994399.0,"i feel i was meant to have killed myself as a child or a teenager, so now that im 21 i feel like im much too old and living on borrowed time, and ill up and finally get it over with sooner or later. 

my life has been pretty miserable since i was young so i feel like its my punishment for not having done it."

selfharm,fduf6h6,t3_emzwqs,1578732211.0,"for me, playing video games keep my hands and mind busy, and calling up friends and talking about whatever or venting if i need to helps a lot"
selfharm,fdqwje0,t3_emrti8,1578675869.0,"nah, ive never gotten any stitches for mine because i dont wanna be a bother. butterfly closures can be helpful for that if you are worried but dont wanna get stitches."

selfharm,fdo6ab2,t3_em4sai,1578599633.0,not to be an emo kid in 2020 but ive always listened to my chemical romance a lot. early sunsets over monroeville and demolition lovers hit different. i listened to the latter a lot when i was dumped.
selfharm,fdo5k8i,t3_emd6cq,1578599279.0,"i have about a dozen and a half reasons haha. i started as a kid because i was a very angry and moody child and i was raised in an environment where any negative emotion was frowned on, so it came out in intense bursts where i needed SOME sort of sensation. 

in high school, i started cutting due to self hatred, as a way to punish myself, as a way to cope with overly strong emotions, as a distraction and delusions involving blood. eventually that morphed into just this daily part of my life, to the point where i would get uncomfortable when i didnt have fresh injuries."
