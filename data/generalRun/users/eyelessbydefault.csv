On why would they, i can't say you why, they just want to. There's a lot of things that can affect this decision, culture, society, your childhood, friends, school,etc. Also at a biological level there should be a different hormone or substance secretion to trigger gender dysphoria, maybe a gene expression that can be related to this.
