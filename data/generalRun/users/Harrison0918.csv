The vast majority of the money you pay in tax is invested back into you (public education, social security, etc...) meanwhile the money the corporations refuse to pay you in wages just sits in their fucking investment accounts. It’s beyond me how people like you will defend greedy corporations that don’t give a shit about you and then demonize the government which is designed to help you, you are only fighting against yourself."

Warren should either say that Bernie is a sexist who should drop out, or deny that he ever said that. What she is saying now makes no sense.

I could understand if she didn’t want to initially leak the story because of the fear of backlash, but now that it’s out, I would expect her to come forward and tell the truth. Instead she basically says “Yeah he was sexist, but honestly it’s fine and we need to move on” which doesn’t make any fucking sense. Why is she so ok with him being sexist? Because he never was, and now that she is falling in the polls she is choosing to misinterpret what he said."

StarWars,fe6e4eg,t1_fe6d8eu,1578888219.0,"That’s the thing.

Luke was right to have been concerned, his mistake was how he tried to confront the problem, and he realized that, but it was too late. Luke hated himself for that decision, which is why he hid and isolated himself from the force. People really want Luke to be some perfect being."
memes,fe0esse,t1_fe0e2g4,1578812114.0,"Agreed, I think TFA should have given the sequel trilogy a bit more of a direction so that TLJ didn’t have to take a bunch of risks to shake things up. If TLJ didn’t shake things up then it would have ended up being very similar to ESB, and people would have complained about it. With that being said I liked most of the things that TLJ did."
