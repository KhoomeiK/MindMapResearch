RealEstate,feu57la,t3_eqmlm4,1579383236.0,"From what I know every municipality plays by their own rules. I’d see if the house assessment is close to what you’re buying it for. If the house has significantly changed (renovations or severely deteriorating) they might reassess. If you think you’re paying too much, you can appeal and request a reassessment. In my area I’ve seen houses taxes go up and down as much as 15% in a year. You could also compare to similar houses in the area to get a better idea of what’s going on there."

Audiobooks of public domain works- librivox

Public domain books- project guttenberg 

Bank of America has a museum program- 1 weekend free admission with a BOA card at participating museums

Museums- look for ones that have suggested donation. This means you pay what you want. In NYC this could save you $20 by not paying the full suggested amount

Historical clubs/nature centers- often offer free guided tours to the public to bring more awareness

Libraries- see if your library is part of a county collective and check for your state specific library to expand what you have access to. I know the NJ state library gives you access to the Rosetta Stone app. You might also be able to get access to a local college’s library. 

Friends of the library sometimes buy museum memberships that you can borrow from the library. If you’re library is part of a collective you might have access to various memberships.

MOOC (massive open online courses)- if you’re looking to learn for free, some colleges have free courses online. Harvard and MIT have excellent MOOC catalogs. It’s basically the courses without college credit."

IsItBullshit,fddgfza,t1_fdbgbnv,1578311180.0,From what I’ve seen unlimited policies work best as designated 20 days vacation or whatever arbitrary number with unlimited sick days.
