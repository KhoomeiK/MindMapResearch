I recommend adding this to your viewing. It discusses how the population will balance out, and if we choose to reduce the population, it means deciding what kind of violence we want - forced steralisation & abortion like China or choosing to kill an age group. 

https://youtu.be/2LyzBoHo5EI

We shouldn't be focusing on population. We should be focusing on improving the lives of people, particularly women, as that it what has the most impact. And like the cartoon, 'what if we make the world better and it was all a hoax?'

NHS would be offering more like 12-24 hours a year, more holistic therapy, e.g. Hanen, home visits, pre school visits. There's also issues that ABA therapists have no registration and therefore pose huge safety issues. Speech Therapists have to meet training requirements & be registered to a body called the HCPC.

slp,ffdpyi5,t3_et1egj,1579826164.0,"Hi there. I'm a Brit SLT (happen to living in the US) 

I've worked in the NHS and now manage a private network of therapists all over the UK. 

I've had brilliant American colleagues in both NHS & private. Parents have never had an issue. As long as you teach their local accent, there's no problem. (I'm slightly northern so have a more American sounding 'a' eg bath vs barth. But I would teach the long ah vowel instead of my vowel when working in South UK) 

A lot of NHS posts are quite general, so you might have a mix of clinic and school based sessions - dysfluency, speech sounds, language, ASD etc. There are also more specialist posts out there too. A lot of places are using Hanen and things like that. ABA is not supported by the NHS. 

You'll need to get Health & Care Professions Council registration. I've supported a couple of Americans and someone from Pakistan through this successfully, it can be a bit slow but it's doable. Imo it's easier going US to UK than the other way around. 

You will want to look on https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/ for NHS jobs. Band 5 is a new grad SLT. Band 6 is more specialist, Band 7 tends to have some clinical specialism and some management and band 8 is often a clinical leader post. This varies in different NHS Trusts, some are more clinical higher up. 

It can be so different based on where you are. Some trusts are just really awful to work with and some are amazing. London has lots of different trusts, so you'd be able to move fairly easily. 

There are also lots more private clinics popping up. Some employ and some you are self employed. (You still have to be HCPC registered to work privately.)

worldnews,ff358x4,t1_ff1yflg,1579533985.0,You also need to tax assets with a system like this. Or they start buying bananas taped onto walls.
aww,ff30y0p,t1_ff29br0,1579530742.0,"Hopefully tech companies will hire some Occupational Therapists. I consult them when I'm introducing a communication device because they can tell me which limb has more controlled movements, what size buttons, whether they need deep pressure to press or need a flat pad that can be gently stroked, whether the button should action on first touch or on release etc. 

Being able to select different sorts of options & use the buttons which already exist in the market would be cool. It would also be great if the tech companies subsidised the cost. Obviously this level of customization isn't cheap, & families with disabled kids already have higher living costs."

Instagramreality,ff2dlpw,t1_ff19u8e,1579501837.0,"Haha, wait till the cherry blossoms. 2000 girls in baby pink silk dresses in freezing March winds with their boyfriend in tow trying to carrying a pop up light reflecting disk and massive chunky winter coats for the girls to put on the second that angle photo is done. Some even sit cross legged in the middle of the road. I got a great pic of my male friend copying the ""gently holding a branch to my face whilst looking up at the sky like there's cake up there"" though."
mildlyinfuriating,ff2cabs,t3_eqycmd,1579500467.0,Someone actually went out looking for candles in that awful peachy beige colour. Probably went to a few places. Then they exchanged actual money for them and brought them home and put them in their carpeted bathroom.
truechildfree,ff21jrs,t3_er5a70,1579491309.0,"I don't sign up to this idea that people who have kids should suffer, or their kids should suffer generational poverty. 

How about we offer proper healthcare to all, including sexual health, steralisation, safe care for all women giving birth. Then we have more education, better workplace rights, childcare, rent control/social housing etc. 

It is all possible. It would mean people aren't getting chemo via go fund me, and struggling to meet their child's basic needs. 

Why not make the world better for everyone no matter their reproductive choices?"
HumansBeingBros,ff1r6hu,t3_er2l1g,1579484380.0,The amount of courage it must take to pick up that red pen must not be underestimated. Sometimes victims need lots of opportunities to speak up. This is brilliant.
AskReddit,ff0j1yp,t3_eqt3lg,1579469342.0,I remember teaching my relatives how to text before keyboards and predictive text. So pressing the number buttons 1-3 times depending on the letter you needed. To be fair it was a bit confusing and slow. But I used to be able to type super fast and they just thought it was voodoo.
bigboobproblems,ff04eeh,t1_feylhbs,1579465088.0,"Banning, whilst useful, doesn't stop creeps seeing posts on the sub or PMing users. Reddit needs to do something like making the victims account invisible to the creep instead of vice versa."
instant_regret,ff020eo,t1_fezz3ff,1579464382.0,"The UK have made it illegal. I'm surprised it's so recent to be honest. The RSPCA said: ""In modern day society there is no excuse or need for the use of devices which can compromise cat and dog welfare, especially when humane and viable alternatives to training and containing dogs and cats are available.""

Dr Rachel Casey, director of canine behaviour and research at the Dogs Trust: ""Scientific research has demonstrated that electronic devices which deliver an aversive stimulus have a negative impact on dog welfare, so this ban will have a major positive impact for dogs in the UK."""

Being disabled comes with costs, missing work for appointments, needing specialist equipment and medication, taking a carer with you places etc. A universal basic income doesn't work when people don't have a universal level of need."
news,feu694s,t1_ferj59o,1579383498.0,Background checks are only useful for finding out if someone has been caught before. Most priests go decades before police even hear their name.
collapse,fetubhx,t1_fet8esn,1579380159.0,Lol. I love the idea of billionaires going into their bunkers with cinemas and swimming pools then all getting osteoporosis because they didn't being any vitamin D.
funny,fetsdxx,t1_feslsg3,1579379488.0,"We had an issue that our wall thermostat was by the front door, and it was a 3 storey house, so it was always colder in that hall than the rooms we actually spent time in. We ended up switching the a smart thermostat that could move anywhere, put it in the lounge & solved all our issues. Nice to be able to change it from bed too without going downstairs."
