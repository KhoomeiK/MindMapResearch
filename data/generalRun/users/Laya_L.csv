Di kakayanin ng mga ospital natin, ni ng gobyerno natin ang Wuhan-level na epidemya. Wag sana kumalat sa Hong Kong ang sakit na yan. Sobrang daming flights between Manila at Hong Kong at ang dami ring OFW dun."

Or would they intervene with regards to the management? I've only read one case in past, with NetJets, and they seemed to have intervened. That's only one case though and NetJets is a pretty small asset for them."

Philippines,fes2ebf,t3_eqgku3,1579360690.0,"Duterte thought he's done enough for China to soften their requirements about those loans but because he acted like a beggar to China, China simply kept insisting on more outrageous demands. China saw a fool who would do many things in exchange of nothing, so maybe giving him a little more they can get more things in return. But to give him much more? Only a much more concession has to be made for that to happen."

As I understand it, what they need are top foreign researchers who can lead and provide further insights to their own researchers on how they can use the telescope and how they can maximize the amount of knowledge that can be taken from all the signals and data that their telescope will get."

You can argue illegal Chinese immigrants and Chinese spies now have easier time going here but it wasn't like it was difficult for them to do that before. We cheer Indonesia that they can stand up against China but Chinese tourists has long been visa-free when entering Indonesia and that won't change."

You can say Chinese tourists are rude and has bad manners all you want, but you can't deny this will bring money to our tourism industry. The only countries that can seem to afford requiring visa from Chinese tourists are South Korea, Japan, and Australia, developed countries which are all in high demand for international tourists anyway."
