I very angrily yelled that I have kids to raise, and to stay away from these apartments. Damn near every one in my complex had kids, and the ones who didn’t were permanently in wheelchairs. He took a step for me and his face changed, his buddy pulled him back, but for moment we were about to like scrap."
ChoosingBeggars,fej17oe,t1_fei4tkk,1579153231.0,"Ha, I was leaving a grocery store with my kid and a creepy old guy went and stood behind me car when he saw my revers lights come on.  I honked to make him move, he pretended to be surprised, approached my window still too close for me to back out without bumping him, and said, “Can I ask you a favor?”  I said NOPE! And drove back because he finally stepped back when he held his hand out. A strapping young man had actually been leaving when he saw, parked his truck partway out and was headed for the scene before I got rid of him. Good to know someone noticed. My brother in law catches his park and ride near that same store, and said the guy always asks for $.42 ‘for the bus’."
ChoosingBeggars,fej0wu1,t1_feiw6pp,1579152947.0,"And, I often see a guy at very busy intersection in town holding a sign, smiling, not taking his over the hill predicament seriously. You turn the corner and see “Help Wanted”, and “Now Hiring” on the fronts of several chain stores."
ChoosingBeggars,fej0qwm,t3_ep9qof,1579152790.0,"Ours change shifts at the Walmart and Home Depot intersection, you see the young guy sauntering comfortably to the ‘spot’ with his cardboard sign tucked under one arm, headphones in, smoking. Then he is standing on top of his shoes, crying and his sign says, ‘stranded, help me get home.’  Then he switches off after a few hours with a couple young ladies who hold the same sign and dress like hippies. It’s their beg-packer fund. A couple of years ago, a local news journalist gave this same guy a ride to his nice rental home and got an anonymous interview. They all collect food stamps and cash welfare, share rent, and save time for fun by collecting handouts instead of holding jobs. When the journalist had first approached the guy, his sign of the day said ‘hungry and homeless, anything helps’. So, he tried to offer him a fresh sandwich and some yardwork. This guy pointed angrily at his sign and through gritted teeth yelled, “money!  I only need money!”
So, ya. Basically fuck these people. They know our tax dollars can help them in a pinch. They thrive off off compassion like lice."
