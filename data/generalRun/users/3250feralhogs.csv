TrueOffMyChest,fffu0s1,t1_ffftbdr,1579891776.0,"We will just ignore his ""nationalist"" dog-whistles and the ""both sides"" argument. That's fine. He's garbage and it's shocking that people do not see that. I mean, yeah, you expect him to be a piece of shit but for people to look at him and go, ""Yeah, that's good person"" is just beyond my pale."
running,fffttou,t1_ffftb52,1579891655.0,Thanks. I went in pretty big when I got the new shoes. I should try the old ones but they are kinda shot--maybe I'll get another pair of the older model but they're over 100 bucks now :( . It's just a minor ache but it makes me dread starting lol. Once I'm going I'm Ok.

offmychest,ffc0umy,t3_estjmm,1579788663.0,"You have to be on your game if you have a boy, it ain’t ez. Everything I hated about my dad I tried to correct with my son and he rejected much of it. It’s not like you can just download the stuff, it takes time and work and his friends will be more fun than you. My girl is a bit more receptive to the way I do stuff although PERIOD and YIKES but we are closer than my son and I."
