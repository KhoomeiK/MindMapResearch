relationships,fg0tpem,t1_fg0l50t,1580414824.0,"If your lady bits still feel torn up months or years after delivery (sexual pain, incontinence, etc), see a pelvic floor therapist. You'd be shocked at what they can fix with physical therapy alone. Even mommy pooch!"
relationships,fg0swj3,t3_ew719y,1580414372.0,"Though her doctor was probably too prudish to suggest it, your wife *needs* to see a pelvic floor therapist. With physical therapy alone, this specialist can correct every common postpartum issue I suspect your wife is coping with: 

>My wife, though, has become more sedentary

Incontinence? That can make running and jumping no bueno. 

>her sex drive has diminished considerably.

Vaginismus? Sexual pain can tank any libido. 

>her figure changed

Let me guess, stubborn belly fat? It might not actually be fat at all, but separated abdominal muscles left over from the baby bump. Technical term: diastasis recti. 

And a pelvic floor therapist can fix all of this! If your wife called her doctor for a referral tomorrow and made a pelvic floor therapist appointment for next week, she'd be a changed woman within a month. 

Trust me. A pelvic floor therapist got me from no sex to happy sex in two sessions. It. Is. Magic."
antiMLM,fg0rije,t1_fg0ptz3,1580413598.0,Ah. My husband and I product of relatively sane marriages. The only lesson either of us got is that remodels always take more time and money than you'd think. Especially if the contractor who sold you weed goes to jail and suddenly you have to find a whole new crew.

If I was, I'd probably appreciate the quality of a $35 blush and store it on the highest shelf I could reach. There's no reason you should sacrifice your appearance for motherhood."

That might cost my husband more than half his income, so he's getting an excellent deal with me. (Or maybe he's getting what he pays for? With multiple kids including an infant, the house only looks good when I pay someone else to clean it)"
