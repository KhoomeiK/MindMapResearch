FWIW the implication of your joke is that either

a) this particular mime has serious mental issues thinking their “dog” is real. That is a horrid thing. Mental issues are _no joke_.

b) everyone else has a _blind spot_ to the fact that invisible dogs of mimes do actually exist; consequently this mime will get no support whatsoever and face only ridicule while searching for his dog, likely ending up in a mental institution, even though they are the only one bearing the real truth. Quite a horrid situation, I’d say.

Hope this explains why I thought your joke was a bit dark. I still think it’s funny and you should do more. I apologize if my compliments above were not of the quality you would have expected."

shittyprogramming,fejjvlf,t1_fejel13,1579177282.0,Welcome to the world of software engineering - writing the code itself is rarely the bottleneck. And there’s no easy proof that your solution will prevent more issues than it causes. Sure it fixes this one type of bug.

shittyprogramming,fej7a02,t1_fej6eez,1579159869.0,"Fair point although TLS itself does not rely on system time (Certificate validation does, somewhat). 

Anyway, I’m not saying this or that is the right way but there’s much more to it than just “hey I can implement this in 2 lines of code!” and arguments can be made for the fixed list being - in this particular case - a preferable solution."
shittyprogramming,fej5lra,t1_fej38iy,1579157821.0,"Are you going to take device time or server time for that? The latter is a lot more complex the former is unreliable.  Sure 99.99% of the time it works but then if you have a million users there still be hundreds having a problem of say their device be at epoch for example. Times the time and effort of the support personell. Oh and of course now you have a new dependency and at the bare minimum a guide for the support folks to check device time if something like this happens. Contrast this with the 5 minute effort of 1 developer per year required to maintain the fixed list.

Edit: see my comments below. The point I’m trying to make (without saying which solution is “better”) is that there’s a _lot_ more to this then just “hey it’s easy I can implement it in 2 lines of code!”."
shittyprogramming,fej0kqh,t1_fej05yv,1579152630.0,"Ux. You don’t want to have an arbitrary long list there. Someone probably told the dev that card companies issue card for a maximum of x years, say 10. It was likely even true. It got implemented with a fixed list in the UI. Couple years passed but noone updated the list. There’s probably a low prio ticket sitting somewhere in the queue that says it needs to be updated at some point, but there were always more important things to do."
