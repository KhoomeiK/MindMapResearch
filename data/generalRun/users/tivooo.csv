worldpolitics,fespxhd,t1_fepwa2o,1579367786.0,"I get all that. Basic supply and demand. More supply of workers = less wages, fine I’m sure that is one component. The other that I’m talking about that is a counterbalance is if you are legal then you ask for more because you can! The only reason undocumented workers get paid minimum or less is because of fear. Like of course they wish they could be fighting for more."
awfuleverything,feoweoo,t1_felrs23,1579306852.0,That’s why I always fight tooth and nail if amazon doesn’t deliver a package or any corporation doesn’t do right by me. Normally I don’t care but fuck man if I was late on 1 payment they would be after me.
worldpolitics,feovwv0,t1_feo6nyj,1579306554.0,"Except for the fact that the immigrant workers if allowed to the country legally would also ask for fair and living wages wages. It’s the fact that they are undocumented that really allows corporations to exploit them and documwnted workers. Undocumented workers is what amazon wants, it’s what big ag wants, it’s what big food wants etc etc. I was inclined to agree with you but I think you missed that."
Fitness,fdteyzv,t1_fdtc027,1578715799.0,That’s it huh?
Fitness,fdsen45,t1_fdrfds3,1578700957.0,Why not? What makes you so against it? Insulin is your fat storing hormone. You stop eating you stop storing fat and start shedding it a lot faster because your base insulin keeps dropping because you don’t need because you aren’t using it! That’s where I’m coming from.
Fitness,fdseanw,t1_fdrfsrh,1578700716.0,Read the obesity code if you’re a nurse. It’s pack full of science terminology and I think it may resonate! Obviously you are at the finish line so you may not need it but it’s a quick way to get to your goals. I KNOW it sounds crazy but now I think it really isn’t. Eating 3 meals a day with snacks is so new. Constantly eating is what is crazy now in my book. Fasting for longer periods of time once in a while seems totally normal to me now. I did 6 days of just water and coffee mid December to be able to enjoy the holidays. I obviously worked my way up to 6 days but it was perfect. I ate what I wanted after those 6 days until last week and I was right around where I started pre fast. Works for me is all I’m saying.
Fitness,fdsdqfj,t1_fdreo55,1578700323.0,"I’m wondering what makes you believe it’s such a bad idea? I’m willing to debate. I’m arguing based on Jason fung’s books the obesity code, and the complete guide to fasting. I was also really skeptical but it makes sense! 

I get the immediate “wtf” but it’s worked wonders for me."
Fitness,fdraqzi,t1_fdqs8rl,1578681823.0,"nice one! Yes, it looks like you are progressing."
Fitness,fdr9q4l,t1_fdqwon4,1578681479.0,you are so damn close. Try fasting for 48 hours twice a week for two weeks? keep everything else the same? See where that gets you. If that's too hard then maybe OMAD (one meal a day) every day for two weeks? I swear it's the best. r/fasting

politics,fdlltlm,t1_fdlfeoj,1578526931.0,"it should be indexed. I don't know what a living wage is exactly and I know it's different in every city but I do know that there are very smart people that could figure out great way to implement it. 

The free market is not the end all man. A society that works for everyone is. An economy that works for every single mother. I do not believe that everyone elses wages should rise a proportionate amount but I do believe they WOULD rise. A lot more people would be willing to leave their stressful better paying jobs for less stressful living wage jobs, the Market would adjust. 

saying something like ""why should people wanting to raise the minimum wage change that? Our skills haven’t changed, there’s still that disparity there, therefore the pay should reflect that, right?"" is like arguing against a minimum wage. Don't you think someone working at McDonalds deserves more than $7.25? (federal minimum wage) IMO pay them more! so what if they are doing 2/3 as well as me as opposed to 1/3 as well as me. When there is less income disparity between the rich and the poor the economy does better."
politics,fdldo2m,t1_fdlb53g,1578521797.0,In my mind it's as simple as this: A business that cannot pay a living wage is not a viable business.
