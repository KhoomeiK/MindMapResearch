If this girl has no symptoms, it's all good."

I wouldn't be all that worried about coronavirus, but even for the flu and stuff, that thing is money"

news,ffhwrt8,t1_ffhwg63,1579957355.0,"Sure, but I know for a fact they can't DO Anything about it.

There's no rapid test like the strep throat swab. There's no prophylaxis. There's no quarantine unless you're symptomatic and high risk.

So, and this is a question for you because I genuinely don't know, what do they do?"
me_irl,ffhv8nl,t1_ffg4f7z,1579955489.0,"Doctor here.

Surprisingly there have been studies about this. Largely for infection control purposes in aerospace medicine.

Even if you wash SUPER well, the bacteria that remain on your balls is very different from what's on your face. You would be making a mistake to assume that once you shower it's all the same. The only way to become truly sterile in the way that I think a lot of people assume, is to autoclave yourself in extraordinary heat which would melt your skin and bones.

tl;dr: the science is in, your balls will always be dirty-ish, even after a shower, so wipe your face first unless you want genital bacteria on your face.

And on a personal note, what the fuck you animals. Do some of you really PREFER to wipe your junk and then rub that towel on your face?! Jesus fucking Christ"
news,ffhotqb,t1_ffhn55y,1579945934.0,"It's pretty long for this virus. Somewhere around 3 weeks and you're good.

But listen dude if you get sick, don't freak the fuck out. Chances are - by a long shot - it's just the common cold and you'll be fine.

And really, even if it's actually coronavirus, you'll probably still be fine, so long as you aren't immunosuppressed or smoking. 

(And if you're smoking, stop now. It literally could save your life in a few weeks)"
news,ffhj594,t1_ffhifvz,1579937617.0,"Preach brother. This is something we teach children. How can we still be so fucking stupid as a species that we can't cover our breathing holes when we cough?

People are disgusting."

DO NOT go in to ""just get checked out"", or you'll infect every fucking patient in the waiting room. 

Stay your ass home until you're out of the window period, and if you get sick, come in if you feel like you need it for really bad shortness of breath or chest pain. But fucking wear a mask, goddamnit, PLEASE."
IdiotsNearlyDying,ffguj8t,t1_ffgt8yu,1579915412.0,"It may seem pedantic but it's an important distinction. The only difference between airborne and droplet is the type of mask you use. Then for real bad shit like ebola, there are higher levels of airborne precautions, with self contained suits and such.

But coronavirus is not airborne. You can't get it from breathing air in the same room as someone who's infected. You can only get it from cough or sneeze particles, or fomites, which are objects that somebody has coughed or sneezed on. Much unlike chicken pox for example, or measles, which you can get just by sharing the same airspace as someone. 

This is definitely something that people not in healthcare can understand."
IdiotsNearlyDying,ffgiix3,t1_ffgfwnf,1579907019.0,"Maybe, but that'd be such an awkward way to put it right - since you want to know if X person is facing forward, how far ahead of him can the virus reach. 

But you're probably right."
IdiotsNearlyDying,ffgaxs3,t1_ffg99g8,1579902241.0,"Ween yourself off the nicotine man. Gotta stop smoking. I've had a lot of people with breathing tubes on my ventilators who smoke and have asthma, and I have to infuse them with sedative just to be humane until they die, because they feel like they're drowning even when I'm pumping them with oxygen. 

It's one of the shittiest ways to die. You don't want that. Go see your doctor today about quitting."
science,ffgakom,t1_fff1sa8,1579902020.0,"There's no such thing as ""prize fighters"" in the immune system. You're just priming your adaptive immunity to respond more quickly to an influenza type antigen when you encounter it in the real world. It takes 2 weeks for a flu shot to accomplish this; if you get the real flu before then, you won't have the benefit of the flu shot, but it's certainly not going to be worse for you. The B-cells that are circulating don't actually attack the virus, and they're not ""busy"" with the vaccine. They secrete a LOT of antibodies into the bloodstream which stick to the virus and indicate to other cell types that that's the virus. I want to reiterate that you're not ""losing your prize B-cells"" to a vaccine for a temporary period of time while they ""train"". That's really not how it works. 

Most people tolerate the flu shot well with minimal side effects. 

Most 15 year olds won't die of the flu. But we roll the dice on everyone else if we don't vaccinate everyone. It's all a game of stats. A 15 year old might have a 99.99% chance of living, and a 0.01% chance of dying, and a 2% chance of developing severe complications like pneumonia. However, their risk of contracting influenza is higher without the vaccine, and with the millions of exposures we have daily to different viruses ""just avoiding it"" is impossible. So they'll get it and transmit it to more vulnerable people, like the elderly, who have a 2-5% chance of dying, and a 10-15% risk of getting pneumonia, for example. And that's the reason everyone should get vaccinated. 

Having an artificial immune response isn't a bad thing. No, it's not natural, but we don't want people to naturally die of influenza. To naturally become sterile after mumps. To naturally be crippled for life after meningitis from measles. 

Vaccines were invented to improve our lives, and the flu shot has a lot for evidence behind it that it's very helpful in decreasing the chances of getting sick, and decreasing the chances of ending up on one of my ventilators with a breathing tube."
videos,ffg99df,t1_fff29q3,1579901210.0,Yeah that's fair. I probably should do the same.
IdiotsNearlyDying,ffg938h,t1_fff6oja,1579901105.0,"The survival rate is way higher than that. Guaranteed. 98% of people haven't died of the infection yet. Hell when the ""good"" estimate there is stupid - half of cases haven't died. So don't worry."
IdiotsNearlyDying,ffg8zga,t1_fff7uel,1579901041.0,"First of all, why are you smoking if you have asthma bro?

Second of all, no, you're fine. Don't go see your doctor unless your symptoms don't get any better after a week, or you start really having difficulty breathing."
IdiotsNearlyDying,ffg8vs1,t1_ffg0u1v,1579900977.0,"Your 3 year old is highest risk, since s/he is quite young still. That being said, ""highest risk"" is relative. Your 3 year old, worst case scenario, gets sick, and will most likely recover. 

What I mean by highest risk in your case is your child has one risk factor - being young - but they're not a newborn baby anymore so that's also a point in their favor. 

Again, chances are they get sick, have a really shitty week at home, and then get better.

Edit: I see I've been corrected and you have a 3 month old, not a 3 year old. My advice is not really different from the normal flu season - starting in 3 months, give your child the flu shot, and try to steer clear of sick kids. Otherwise, there's not much else we can do."

IdiotsNearlyDying,ffezcl6,t1_ffexhr1,1579871226.0,"There are risk factors for developing severe complications of influenza. Immune compromise is one; old age, frailty, lung disease, smoking, diabetes, etc. etc. All contribute.

And no, it's 3 feet. For nearly all droplet transmitted diseases, the radius is about 3 feet."
