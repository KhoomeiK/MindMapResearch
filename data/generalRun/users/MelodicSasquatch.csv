Showerthoughts,fff45th,t1_ffe7ayq,1579875225.0,"You're taking about a classic method to help kids learn how to count syllables. if you use this method,  you count only when the jaw drops, not when it rises.

In the hypothetical word ""zab"", this method gives you one syllable, because you don't count when the jaw moves back up for the ""b"". In Elizabeth, the method gives you four, which is correct.

But, that method is only used for counting, it's not very good for finding syllable boundaries. For that you need to look at the spelling and other context, and know a few rules."

mildlyinfuriating,fe8swfv,t1_fe7kaxm,1578930371.0,"In the US, Basements were originally found in the northern areas where the soils are soft and it gets very cold in winter. In the winter, when the ground freezes and thaws, it has a tendency to shift plain slabs all over the place, so we have to dig down deeper to get our footings below what's called the frost-line. Since we're digging that far down anyway, might as well dig a little more and make it a usable space. This also might help with maintaining heat, since the basement floor is going to be a little warmer than ground level in the winter.

Note that if you live in an area where the soil doesn't shift much in the winter you wouldn't need to dig that far down, and a basement is merely a luxury. And, if you live in an area where ground is a lot harder, it would be too expensive to dig a basement. Also, areas prone to earthquakes and flooding aren't great for basements."

madlads,fcsxva6,t1_fcrd3nw,1577927852.0,"Not necessarily any more than your country. There are several biases at work.

People who do drugs talk about drugs. People who don't, also don't talk about it. So, in conversations about drug use, you will only see comments from drug users. The rest just read the conversation and move on.

People who do drugs tend hang out with others who do drugs, and people who don't tend to hang out with people who don't. This means, each group perceives their group as more common.

Also, people who do drugs tend to hide their use from people who don't, for fear of persecution. Which means, a non-drug-user may know a lot of drug-users without realizing it.

Finally, some things that lead people to use Reddit habitually may also lead people to do drugs, which means drug use may be more common among redditors than it is among the general populace.

Last I read, only about 9% of Americans use drugs. However, the source for that number was shaky, as there are good reasons for both underreporting and overreporting, and it wasn't clear what counted as drugs."

In Wisconsin, you talk to the dealer, the bank and your insurance agent, and that's it. You never even talk to the DMV unless it's a personal sale.

The dealer files all the paperwork with the DMV for you. Plates stay with the owner, not the car, so usually it's just a transfer even with a new car.
