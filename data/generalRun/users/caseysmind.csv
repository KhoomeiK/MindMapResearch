StLouis,feclskb,t1_fecex37,1578977071.0,just because it doesnt happen to you doesnt mean crime isnt high compared to other cities. not to say other cities dont have crime also. but it was just a rant about crime after being robbed. u

StLouis,feaf7at,t1_fe9votn,1578947919.0,Also I like that you can tell so much about me from my comments but when I judge people for an ass hole smart ass comment it’s me being sensitive.

Meanwhile crime and poverty and low education and all the shit that’s wrong with stl no one does anything for. Congrats America. Just report the thread or stop commenting with further complaints that aren’t on topic.

Take it to Pm if u have a problem with me as a person as so many do. I promise I won’t just ignore it forever because I completely don’t care"

StLouis,fe8ryqn,t1_fe8rqp2,1578930005.0,"I’ve talked to them plenty of times and I tell them society makes me sad and they tell me not to let it. Ok. Thanks I’m cured. I guess now I’m happy with how sick everyone is to each other. 

Also sorry I told people to get their shit together who already gave up on getting their shit together. I forgot we’re satisfied with the state of things. 

I think if I fucked up and needed to fix something and I forgot about it I’d like the reminder because it should be at the forefront of my head. But I get it we’re not all responsible for it. None of us are after all we were just born into it. So let’s do nothing and just start arguments over the internet and try to make ourselves feel like the hero by stuffing as many 2 cents as I can down everyone else’s throat. 

Don’t we get complaints about lazy useless generations all the time? This is me being a boomer and complaining about what ever generation we’re currently in I guess. And I know I’m part of the problem because I didn’t fix it yet. I guess for some reason I wanted to rant and have a discussing on crime and all that education poverty nonsense or something and I went about it the wrong way because everyone here is too defensive. I talk too vulgar I think and get people worked up. That’s life I guess. Words break bones. Sorry if I seem like an ass hole I just talk like one and I’m very disappointed in people and myself all the time. Just try to be kind I think I’m done having fun here.


And I guess what tipped me was the several smart ass comments. Sorry if I seemed an ass to folk who weren’t. All the usernames look the same to me so I treated it as one bubble of viscous retardity"
StLouis,fe8qln3,t1_fe8pwak,1578929387.0,"I don’t mind if people don’t like my responses. After all as you said I’m just a username and you are as well. A bunch of users spammed me with the same info I already had. I should ha e typoed my post differently to explain I’m frustrated at theft in the city and that way it could have been a conversation instead of a dump for everyone to stick their 2 cents in. Because keep in mind you all had the exact same 2 cents. Because literally only 2 cents fit. Lock doors and be careful. I said it’s frustrating we ha e to. You ca. Keep arguing if you want but I like getting people worked up over literally nothing like this post. I’m lonely and this is my human interaction. It’s bad btw. It makes me like people even less that people would rather argue with me instead of just saying ok or downvoting and moving on.and I have moved on just folding laundry and frustrated my girlfriend lost AirPods In a purse and a few ra don other things. Also was a relief we found her wallet not in her purse so she started screaming and crying at the folk who stole it and wouldn’t give it back to her less. And police thing was filed and they basically said they’d do nothing 


The only thing I’m mad at is society really,  cause this is a constant backdrop every where you go. Higher in stl for sure according to statistics though but as said that’s just how we designed the area for us. It’s designed to be part of the prison system and it’s going great."
StLouis,fe8ostu,t1_fe5xa3l,1578928734.0,I’m glad you’ve been lucky
StLouis,fe8on63,t1_fe5wtol,1578928699.0,Glad your so proud of the crime in the city. Sorry I wanted to rant about being robbed. Guess we’ll attack me now. Thanks circle jerk band wagon of reddit. This is literally what’s wrong with the world. This mentality.
StLouis,fe8o41d,t1_fe8mpn4,1578928402.0,"Everyone gave me the advice of locking the car. And I knew too unfortunately my girlfriend dropped her guard for a second and someone took advantage of her. So thank you and everyone for calling me a fool and downvoting me for saying there is crime and how disappointing it is to live near it. I really appreciate your response. I like when animals pretend to talk. Girlfriend knew as well she just dropped her guard. So I guess my complaint was that. Yep I get it I was an idiot she was dumb. Fuck us for allowing ourselves to be robbed. The robbers are fine let’s not talk about any of that. Just tell me how foolish I am and circle jerk how we in the subreddit have never seen crime so it doesn’t exist. Thanks global warming. I guess next time I’ll remain neutral and just ask about why our city has such a crime rate and not actually bring up my being a victim of it or any of the many times my friends have.

Next time just say that sucks make sure you lock your door and I’ll say , ya thanks. And we can be done. Or I guess just focus on the victims failures rather than societies when I want to talk about it. My bad for ranting I know the post was. But my goodness you folk are garbage and I guess that’s why the crime rate is high. City is full of unfriendly idiots"
Foodforthought,fe8ls1k,t1_fe8lh2h,1578927632.0,Oh I know it is. Every day I feel burned out and too tired to fix or help the problems in society and I know we were all built the same and I’m not the only one. I feel like not talking about it only makes it worse however as discussing is the only way to learn and progress in life

StLouis,fe8lblh,t1_fe8kerz,1578927474.0,Oh I know it was dumb and I’m trying to be more careful. This was my post to sigh at the society we’ve built where we can’t trust anyone. It is victim blaming though although I suppose we could argue that your giving advice the same advice is to not go out alone at night while dressed like a whore when a woman gets raped. So thank you for telling me to be more careful because everyone wants what I got and they will stop at nothing to take it from me. I try so hard to care for people but every day I swear it gets harder. It’s common sense to lock the doors I know my girlfriend stepped outside of the car because no one was near by. Walked 10 feet and turned around. Idk if someone was legit hiding because it was night and waiting for us to step away because they expected people to come by dropping stuff off that they asked for or what. But believe me I know to be careful
Salvia,fe8jzgh,t1_fe8jkat,1578927003.0,"I mean the trip will be weird but that doesn’t make it bad, idk what Shakespeare has to do with that. Stay calm and expect weird and it’ll be fine."
StLouis,fe8jkpq,t1_fe5vbbr,1578926846.0,Itaska I would give the address and tell you which set of people took the shit but police do nothing and I guess we don’t witch hunt
Foodforthought,fe8hjhe,t3_eo4df4,1578926207.0,"Yeah but the folks at the top don’t mind, they probably just want us to have two crap jobs instead of one as well as government assistance."
StLouis,fe8fzh4,t1_fe7tjkd,1578925761.0,"Yeah fuck me for not having common sense and realizing the world is full of shit people my bad. Dropped my guard for a second and it won’t happen again. My common sense is to remember how shit this world is and it’s people. Like you and the folk on this subreddit trying to defend the thief and blame the victim. I guess I was just asking for it with how I was dressed. I like how pride kicks in and people defend their shit city. 

I can only assume if my gf was raped we’d be having the same comments from you idiots. Maybe you should have been more careful. Go fucking kill yourselves"

I don’t think I have the highest self awareness all the time but I at least have any which is more to be said than you.
StLouis,fe6fwiy,t1_fe66ur2,1578889676.0,Sorry I didn’t have empathy for the guy complaining about another guy complaining about being robbed by so callously calling him an idiot over the internet. I hope your life isn’t ruined. Learn some math and maybe a little empathy
StLouis,fe65xba,t1_fe6490t,1578882515.0,We stepped away for like 30 seconds it’s mind blowing how fast people move. Already replacing all the door locks now
StLouis,fe65g9t,t1_fe60up1,1578882208.0,Sorry I’m being pretty ridiculous after being robbed by making a post over reddit. Glad you have no capability of empathy to try to share in it.

StLouis,fe60q28,t1_fe5wtol,1578879188.0,I like that the response is sarcasm. That’s our society. A bunch of selfish pricks that can’t try to be kind for a single moment. Thanks bud

StLouis,fe60mu6,t1_fe5xy25,1578879133.0,Yep it was 10 seconds walked to a front door like 15 feet away and turned back to car and it was gone. No one was around but someone chilling in a bushes or some shit idk. Classic St. Louis
StLouis,fe60klt,t1_fe5za6o,1578879095.0,It was like 10 seconds. But I love that the response is to be careful and not be kind. I guess we can’t talk to animals
StLouis,fe5xbgk,t1_fe5v8p2,1578877026.0,Girlfriend was part of some group to share stuff or what ever so we picked up some cat food and kitty litter and dropped it off at a persons place who needed it but had no car. We legit walked from like 15 feet to the place to the front door and back and someone managed to swipe the purse from car seat. Was no one around except folk in the apartment and idk what do when police do nothing. Neighbor said it’s a bunch of squatters. Knocked on the door but it’s not like they’ll admit anything so what are we gonna do besides move on with a shittier taste in my mouth
