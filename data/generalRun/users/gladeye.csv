&#x200B;

Hear my Train A Comin' (electric) is my favorite moment. Actually, I guess it's tied with the acoustic version."
janisjoplin,ff2i9se,t3_d21xmg,1579507325.0,I drive by it a few times a month. No bad vibes yet.
lego,feprnao,t1_fengtry,1579328954.0,Thank you for the feedback. I think I am going to auction it.
jimihendrix,femdc4u,t3_epwuc5,1579249686.0,That was terrific. Thank you.
trees,fel9ooq,t3_epnd3l,1579217116.0,"Congratulations and thank you very much for your service! My immediate thought was, ""Uh oh. He's going to have zero tolerance, smoke too much of something too strong, hack A LOT and get too stoned to be pleasurable. 

It happened to me. I took exactly a year off smoking weed and celebrated with a joint my neighbor brought over. Ughhh I smoked like I had never stopped and I needed to lie down because I was miserable with nausea and a headache. The time after that all was good again though. :)"
CBD,fekkbsy,t3_epj3pd,1579201843.0,"I rarely see the same strain more than once, so no. Does it contain Sour Blue Gorilla Cake  OG Cookies?"
lego,fekk2hs,t1_fekjfll,1579201689.0,I really don't want to. Do you think it's going to continue rising in value much?

TwoXChromosomes,fekee6y,t3_epkikf,1579198302.0,"You don't *have to*  engage these people, but if it's unavoidable you could ask, ""And how did your children turn out? Are they happy? Do they appreciate you and call you often enough?

Most of us have reasons to resent or regret how our parents raised us. Maybe you could trigger that in one of these busy bodies. ""Has your advice helped your children raise their kids?""

I dunno. I guess that's kind of mean-spirited. Plus, I'm doing the guy thing of ""Rather than hearing and sympathizing, let me try to fix your problems!"" Sorry. It does come from a place of caring."
pics,fekdung,t3_epldx1,1579197977.0,I hope it's only water.
tifu,fekdlcx,t3_epgrgt,1579197821.0,"There was a story very similar to this on the This American Life broad/podcast a few weeks. 

It was the same ""Hmm, I wonder what mom enjoyed reading. Oh shit, there's tons of erotica on here."" 

Is this the same person or just a coincidence?"
gaming,fe6od79,t3_eny8g6,1578898037.0,I have never earned bonuses for sleeping well.

I wasn't asking my question as a tinfoil hat guy. I know most things are on the electromagnetic spectrum and some things penetrate more easily than others. And maybe we are getting hit with things not on the EM spectrum? Like particles? I don't know all that's out there, so\* I asked.

\*I hate ""hence"""
AskReddit,fe6isej,t1_fe6im1h,1578892232.0,Check out all this guy's posts. He's obsessed with everybody's moms.
AskReddit,fe6ioey,t1_fe6i8sy,1578892130.0,"Emotionally, yes. I showed her what you wrote and she broke down. She didn't understand it was simply an anonymous mean spirited jab at a stranger. The only way I could calm her was to give her permission to haunt you frequently when she dies. Actions have consequences."
dataisbeautiful,fds0ws7,t3_emqdal,1578692547.0,"We get hit with tragedies and catastrophes so frequently now, there's never enough time to process everything emotionally, let alone intellectually. It doesn't help that fear and worry brings in viewers.

Like Dave Chapelle said, this generation has to deal with the equivalent of the space shuttle Challenger disaster, every day."
tifu,fdrw7l9,t3_emtnpp,1578690702.0,He will rely on willing suspension of disbelief.
AskReddit,fdot3q7,t3_em7trd,1578612269.0,"AOL chat rooms. The site was still small enough that names in certain chat rooms became familiar. There were get-togethers here in L.A., and a lot of sleeping around with rotating partners."
jimihendrix,fdi6yqu,t1_fdg7t6x,1578436839.0,"Jimi looks pretty bummed out in a lot of the film. And the audience seems so quiet while he's playing. And were the lights on? 

I don't remember which of the two nights was filmed, but was the unfilmed night the better performance?"
GetMotivated,fdi6ex9,t3_elbj4f,1578436552.0,"They color, but they aren't very sharp."
nottheonion,fdg804l,t3_el4sb5,1578383876.0,"We had something similar in Los Angeles sometime back, with a tagger who wrote CHAKA a ridiculous number of times all over the city."
tifu,fdg2qks,t3_el3vuo,1578377838.0,I'm going to assume you're a dude. Women never seem to end up in wacky fart situations.
GetMotivated,fdfiidf,t3_ekxjp7,1578362494.0,That's easy to say when you have the room to spread and your wings aren't broken.
jimihendrix,fdfiedb,t3_ekxmfr,1578362420.0,"That's at the Royal Albert Hall, Feb. 1969. I'm NOT saying it's a fake photo, because people have better things to do, but I am surprised they had headset mics like that back then.  

I bought  Hendrix concert program long ago and inside were two amateur photos of Hendrix at the L.A. Forum, 1970. They are close, but not exciting. It looks like they were taken when the band first got on stage and were getting everything adjusted. I'll post them if I can find the time to scan them."

TwoXChromosomes,fd7i584,t3_ek61az,1578204902.0,"My wife had just stopped nursing our daughter, so she ignored the lump at first. She thought it was just clogged milk ducts. She survived, but would have kept more of her breasts and lymph nodes if she knew to react sooner."
TwoXChromosomes,fd7hx1w,t3_ek61az,1578204795.0,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful news! Congratulations on dodging that bullet."

trees,fd0ripq,t1_fd0q2lb,1578122788.0,Thank you for the info. 15% isn't pricey either. I'm a pig and try to only smoke strains with over 25% thc which coast more.
trees,fd0rb9x,t1_fd0qqii,1578122706.0,Thank you for such an informative answer. Very helpful!

TwoXChromosomes,fcz06kj,t3_ejfp8j,1578090974.0,Aren't you already being exploited by virtue of fucking on camera so that others might watch and get off?
tifu,fcv7glo,t3_ej0e2y,1577996225.0,I think this is a younger person problem. I keep my shit tidy and discreet.
TwoXChromosomes,fcts1yl,t3_eirnp9,1577956535.0,"I'm sincerely sorry this happened to you. No one deserves to be disrespected and humiliated this way.

We should all know by this point that sending anybody nude pictures is highly risky, but when you refer to ""my nudes"" without explanation it feels to me like nudes are just a given, understood thing people have on their phones, like selfies or pet pictures. 

I tell my children and students, once you send anything to a person or put something on the internet, you can never take it back and it   
can stay out forever. Remembering that has saved me a couple times. 

I hope you get out of this situation without anymore humiliation."
medicalmarijuana,fchifiu,t3_eh5i50,1577650732.0,"Sort of. 

""Great for depression, anxiety, muscle relaxation, sleep, appetite, etc."" ""Great day time smoke for work."" ""Perfect for long creative days.""

To me, it's just, ""Oh, this gets me pretty high"" or ""This stuff is weak.""

I have no idea what difference all those terpines make, but who can keep track anyway, since there are a couple dozen new strains a week?

I once read that even the Indica/Sativa difference isn't really applicable anymore, because so much hybriding took away a lot of the distinguishing differences. Who knows? 

If there is a reliable, up to date guide, I've never seen it, but that seems like one of those things we're not allowed to talk about on this reddit sub."
pics,fchgdnj,t3_eh5553,1577650255.0,I live on Los Angeles. On a good night you can see the moon.

TwoXChromosomes,fbr7tgw,t3_ee2j5c,1577040191.0," *He went to several colleagues to tell them that I was not working 40hrs a week and always left early and also said I was the office bitch, that I was too emotional and crazy etc...* 

I'm a guy, and I do believe there are lots of men like this, but I am grateful that such ignorance and idiocy doesn't exist in my social or work circles. Yeah, I know that it's ""as far as I know"", but I'm in education, which is mostly women anyway. I wonder how guys like the shithead described in this post treat their mothers and sisters."
