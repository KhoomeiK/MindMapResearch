getdisciplined,fdpjg9i,t1_fdnarwq,1578630278.0,Thank you. I’ll take some breaks and not suddenly try to go from 0 to 100.

getdisciplined,fdpj3tx,t1_fdn9tae,1578630002.0,Thanks for the response. I just hope it will get easier and easier the longer I keep at it.
infj,f3bh9vu,t1_f3bgv1e,1570810241.0,Ok. Thank you.
