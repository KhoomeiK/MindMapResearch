bjj,ffiqsbj,t3_etp3g8,1579980388.0,"I went against a guy with 50-60lbs on me and a big strength advantage, let him start in side control. I wanted to practice the Danaher escape. He grabbed behind my collar to the far shoulder and cinched me into him tightly so I couldn't get my elbow to the mat. I was stuck there while he just held me in place with an iron grip for like 3 minutes. I couldn't bump or shrimp because of his strength, all I could do was frame against his neck to make the pressure breathable.

I also have very long limbs so it's harder for me to bring the elbow to the mat in this case. What do you do in a situation like this where you can't shrimp or bridge to make any space to get the elbow down? This is my kryptonite in this sport, when facing stronger guys, I feel helpless and it's no good if I'm going to be a purple soon since even white belts can do it to me."

NoStupidQuestions,fe6cg43,t3_enyjhk,1578886912.0,"You could ask her specifically to go with you to attend an event, like ""hey, want to go see this band at 7pm Friday?"" or just say ""hey want to go out this weekend?"" then trade numbers, and finalize the plans through text. Come up with some ideas, mention them, do something she seems interested in. It takes some creativity to make a good first date, but something simple is also fine, like walking around at a park/lake or getting food. Movies aren't the best option for a 1st date cause you want to interact with her, not sit next to her in darkness/silence for 2 hours.

When it comes to texting in between now and the date, just be casual, don't text her every hour. That will come off as clingy/needy which girls fucking hate. Just play it cool and find a good middle ground and it'll be fine."
