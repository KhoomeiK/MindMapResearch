AskReddit,ffmibuw,t1_ffmdl8n,1580055112.0,"LOL look at my post history haha, I’ve been trying MD of shrooms for about 6 months now and there’s definitely been some progress made but every time I drop my ssri dose that progress is erased and I feel less empowered than ever...gotta get over that hump.

I appreciate the kind words though, I’ve never been emotionally big into music, if anything I struggle to know what I feel and it’s been like that since I can remember but MD has been helping with that so I look forward to continuing that practice. I’ve been trying to open up to coworkers too so maybe I’m on the right track."
microdosing,ffm985x,t1_fflsjdz,1580050823.0,Damn 2 months?? What AD were you on? I’ve been airing on the side of caution and have been tapering since April ‘19 and that fact alone depresses the shit out of me as it’s still a huge pain in the ass especially as I get to these lower dosages. And that’s only 4-5 years on Zoloft. I’m terrified of a mission failed scenario after all this time. Feels like my life has been on hold because of just managing withdrawal symptoms it’s so horrible.
microdosing,ffm8v9d,t1_fflsudu,1580050592.0,I’ve heard of the Prozac bridge! How long did that process take you? I’m almost down to 25mg but the withdrawal effects seem to be magnifying a bit.
microdosing,ffm8m0x,t3_eu389v,1580050413.0,"Looking forward to hearing everyone else’s results. I’ve had a mixed bag that’s not entirely up everyone else’s alley mainly because of concurrent withdrawals, along with a *really* nasty withdrawal a year and a half ago I’m still working on healing that psychological scar.

Before going into more detail, there absolutely no doubt I wish I had discovered mushrooms before going to a psychiatrist. They allow you to feel your feelings and develop insight into their nature rather than SSRIs and benzos that numb them, ultimately making you worse off. For some people this subjective experience works, but for me it felt like it only inhibited me from growing.

In a nutshell, 2015 Zoloft, increasing dose through 2018 (ultimately 200mg); Klonopin at the same time (mind you this was after an hour session at my first psych...) as needed- which then became daily. 2016 same psych threw me on adhd meds (which I have bittersweet feelings towards now). Around 2018 was having increasing cognitive issues and went to a different psych when the first left the state. She was just out of school, decided to let me rapid taper Klonopin and Dexedrine at the same time. This had me in a deer in headlights withdrawal state for like 6 months where I became a hermit, couldn’t answer phone calls or texts, struggle to leave the house. 

Found mindfulness and meditation march 2018 which helped heal some of the damage, kept that going but knew Zoloft was causing issues...mainly increasing suicidality. I began that taper in April 2018- first going down by 25mg every few week, but things started getting weird at 100mg so I started spreading out the intervals. 

Around this time I started MD and I still can’t emphasize I wish I started sooner. I’m 26 now and more than likely ‘on the spectrum’ which ultimately dissociates me from what I’m feeling on a regular basis. The SSRIs and the Benzo kept all of it quiet, but ultimately after a year I started to feel like a shell of a human. MDing on the other hand is a brief couple days of filling up where I was starting to feel the most hollow. I’ve only been at it for 5 months now, with ‘mini trips’ at like 1g under my belt but with each SSRI dose decrease I feel the MD more and more which is cool. If anything I’ve had to reduce what I take because it gets a little overwhelming now that I’m on such a low dose of Zoloft. However I feel like it continues to light up the path toward being off it entirely. It’s definitely putting me back in touch with being human. 

With regards to ‘up and down’ cycling. Unfortunately in my case being on year 5 of Zoloft there’s nothing but up and down. It’s like medicinally induced bipolar. I can’t say it’s all rainbows and butterflies down here almost at 25mg of Zoloft but I’m closer to my goal than ever. The winter is kicking my ass too so I’ll prob hang out at this dosage till it gets nicer out but MD is providing a semi-weekly dose of looking at things differently that’s entirely needed as my patterned rumination flares up as a result of the rebound depression. My short term memory is fried as of late too so it’s a little difficult to take my learnings from one dose day and integrate it but I hope for that to get better.

I hope this provided some insight, MD is definitely a spectacular tool that I’m increasingly excited to investigate and integrate. Will they entirely replace my meds? Hopefully...but they work in the opposite direction of what the meds have provided me, in a more positive organic direction. For ADHD not sure yet at all, Dexedrine seems to triumph over the MD but I’ve yet to try MD lsd seriously yet (only did it one day and barely felt it).

I’m scared as shit to drop off the ssri entirely because of what happened when I jumped off Klonopin last year but hopefully this slow taper will yield a smoother final withdrawal. 

I’m also growing for the first time haha, my cakes are about a week or so away from birthing so we’ll see where that goes!"

Now 5 years later haven’t gone anywhere in life because I’m busy dealing with the withdrawals and rebound depression from coming off the meds. 

That and going to an expensive private college, and my parents acting like it would all be fine when I got out."

Still dysfunctional and about to jump back on the Dexedrine train. I never abused just used as prescribed for a couple years (just like every other med that’s fucked me over).

Petioles,ffilxcx,t1_ffgspyu,1579977029.0,you mix cbd flower with thc bud? I recently took up cbd vaping as I totally found more than a few days in a row of thc indulging increased my depressive symptoms but just like you cbd seems to 'hit the spot' just barely enough...but I still do find myself craving the high a little but find high thc bud nowadays to be too strong.
depression,ffdlenu,t1_ffdipyb,1579823360.0,"Thanks for the kind words :) having a particularly rough day psychologically, My core self doesn’t want to do anything stupid and make that hole in the universe, but the meds have just made and continue to make everything worse. The idea that I still have months more of withdrawal to deal with is just overbearing.

There’s no doubt that my death would cause a LOT of heartache, granted the longer I’m alive and not fortifying these connections (become such a hermit in withdrawal) the less of an impact that death would have. 

Idk I just wish I never felt like this. Fairly certain I never did before the meds. Being human is fucking confusing. That brightness being lost over and over again, even though it comes back in little bits here and there is one of the main pillars of my depression at the moment."
depression,ffdi0rf,t3_et0ok2,1579821288.0,Once you start to feel a difference don’t stay on it for too long or go too high in dose- can make you feel *too* numb. Hindsight 20/20 wish I was only on it for a year at most. 5 years later and I’m fighting for my life just to get off the med. also if suicidal ideation kicks in or gets worse just get off the med while you’re not in too deep.
depression,ffdhpp1,t3_et0t06,1579821103.0,"It just feels like my brain isn’t working. Anything near the way it used to. The future seemed so damn bright for so long. Even when it started getting hairy and I went to see a psych and a therapist I was still so optimistic that things would work out.

Now about a year and a half after Klonopin withdrawal, and currently in the middle of SSRI withdrawal I’m living an absolutely miserable existence. Yes I have a job (not looking to go into IT so it’s not really ideal) and yes I have degrees (BS and MBA) which came with a shit load of debt. But I’m so dissociated from the human being I was for so long, I literally feel torn in and out of ‘reality’ on a daily basis. The mood swings are the worst, but al the suicidal ideation that’s come from these meds has really been the worst of it all. 

I still live with my parents who couldn’t be more supportive but I can’t help but dwell in self loathing since turning 26 and still not being financially independent...anywhere near. Shit I’m barely emotionally independent. I feel like a fucking todler.

Coming off these psych meds feels like waking up *into* a bad dream...they say when you’re going through hell keep going, but I feel like I’ve been at this fight for the last year and a half of my existence and it’s so goddamn draining. It feels like I’ve hit my therapists limit, and just all support systems are failing me. Worst of all I’m failing myself."
StopSpeeding,ffco06o,t3_es7wkr,1579803528.0,"I'm more interested in your acid use; I've been playing around with mushroom microdosing but that's been more of an emotional haul rather than an uplifiting productivity reset. After about 2-3 years of moderate dexedrine use (no abuse but daily use) I went through 9 months of PAWS only to think 'hey maybe I do need the stuff' so went back on for 3-4 months...then when the toxic effects kicked in again and I realized I wasn't getting very far on them I gave it up again. Now 2 months off again and craving possibly more than I ever have because my executive function feels absolutely fried. I can't even make phone calls I want to make, and I'm convinced ASD may also be playing a roll in my social anxiety/executive dysfunction that the Dexdrine took care of. 

I'm also tapering off an antidepressant which isn't making things any easier; the rebound depression is only magnifying the executive dysfunction. Curious if you can elaborate on the whole raising to 'normal heights' thing and what your experience overall has been."

shrooms,ff1us5u,t1_feylku8,1579486652.0,"Great read, I look forward to some of my ‘real trips’ this year once I’m fully off antidepressants...more “treatment” that never actually helped and I only realized after 4, now 5 years. So sorry to hear about the benzo use, I was also prescribed Klonopin for 3 years and I’m still psychologically recovering from that (the ssri taper rips open old wounds on a regular basis)- I’m too much of a pussy to go above 1.5g while still tapering (my waking reality often has the anxiety of a bad trip ever since the Benzo withdrawal). However microdosing and meditation have actually provided a bit of progress. Each down dose on the ssri knocks me back into a bad place but soon enough the taper will be over and the real healing will begin. Memory is still super fucked through withdrawal (and from the klonopin use I’m convinced) so any progress made from insight slowly disappears...still working on that but the brain heals!"
StopSpeeding,fezc1hh,t3_eqt12w,1579455804.0,"Very intrigued by your meditative exploration! I was prescribed vyvanse back in Sept '16 for adhd (along with ASD symptoms I just didn't know at the time). Eventually I grew intolerant of that med and moved onto dexedrine IR that really worked the best. I was also on klonopin and an SSRI, both of which started to rear their ugly heads a couple years in, and now almost 5 years in as I continue to withdraw off of both those meds I regret ever going to a psych. The one thing that has kept me alive this year was getting into meditating. 

Now what's weird is I was heavily into everything buddhism/meditation/mindfulness from March-August; went back on Dexedrine after a 9 month break, then as I'm working my way off SSRI decided dex might be a good option to keep going on. Got a new job and focused on that and my daily practice fell off. I only realized 3 months in just how far I had fallen as anxiety slowly consumed me. Around Nov gave it another break and found I was again more motivated to get back into my practice. 

Oddly enough I found on dexedrine I didn't feel the need to meditate on a daily basis...It was like that was my chemical artificial center. However over time I def began to feel the toxic effects. I'm still VERY on the fence about going back on dex as I don't want to make things worse for myself but it may in fact make this SSRI withdrawal a bit easier, then maybe later down the road when that's all out of my system I can stop Dex entirely. 

I do feel that over a LOT of time meditating I may be able to cultivate and rekindle the type of motivation I find on dexedrine but it feels so far away. Like I'd have to quit my job and literally meditate non-stop, and still not find that level of clarity/execution. 

Very curious about the particulars of your practice if you don't mind me asking, like how long, how frequently etc."
StopSpeeding,feza54w,t1_feyleyy,1579455238.0,"You seem like the type who may be able to shed light on my predicament.

Been in a nasty state of withdrawal on and off since Sept 2018; due to ugly accumulating side effects, rapid tapered klonopin and dexedrine at the same time, shitty psych didn't give me any heads up what kind of hell I'd be getting into. I was on both for about 2 years...never really 'abused' per se, never really went above what I was prescribed, don't think I ever exceeded 30mg in one day, most days it was about 10-15mg IR; helped immensely for ASD and ADHD symptoms.

Concurrently on SSRI for almost 5 years now, once I started recovering from the aformentioned withdrawal, I wanted to be off all meds so I started a SLOW taper from Zoloft in April '19. Around July '19, now 9 months off dexedrine, had the bright idea of using dexedrine to help the zoloft withdrawal. It did in fact help with the struggle that zoloft withdrawal seems to bring up but I did begin to feel that 'shell of a human' feeling. It did help me work a new job (was previously self employed but the klonopin/dexedrine withdrawal combo in '19 turned me into a hermit for months still living with parents)

Around Nov '19 I began to feel like Dexedrine was having a little bit more cons than pros, mainly the physical and mental fatigue at the end of the day was begining to feel unbearable and I got the sense that what I was putting into my body was toxic. 

I have taken 2 months off since then but the executive function issues stemming from the zoloft are magnifying, and control (over emotions, and actually \*doing\* things) I feel lies in going back on dexedrine...

I can't tell if I'm ultimately making things worse for myself as I aspire to be off dex one day and return to my 'normal' self but low key the SSRI withdrawal is eroding me day by day. As I'm typing this I'm leaning more on my use of dexedrine is justified certainly while I finish up my zoloft taper (down to 36.5mg from 200)...I struggle to even do the little things at the moment, I can't even call people to make appointments, go places, I struggle to do things out of my normal patterns. 

Looking to move on and get a new job but I can't even drive myself to crank out cover letters and feel dexedrine might fit right into this spot...

Anyway I digress, any input would be mightily appreciated! Dexedrine has always been the one med that's helped the most but I fear I might be hurting myself in the long term."

CPTSD,feexasp,t1_fedtrf5,1579043233.0,"Curious what SSRI you ended up getitng off of! I'm working my way off Zoloft the last 8 months and it's been a bitch and a half, but the ONE med that has actually benefited me tremendously was dexedrine (while being a double edged sword it  has cons no doubt). I'm currently on a break again but thinking about going back on because my executive function is absolutely zapped- Still on 36.5mg of Zoloft (down from 200 where I felt psychotic) and 2 months into Dex break but in order to get my life back together I fear I need to embrace the one med that seemed to work-Dex. I never fit into the abuse category, even though I've had some psychs treat me that way because I would remark just how well it helped me out (also on the spectrum, first diagnosed ADHD), granted it does help the depression too and not looking for it to be a crutch for that but no doubt executing things, even the tiniest things like calling a doctor or making an appointment, are way easier to follow through with a bit of amp in my blood. The exhausting effects are what has driven me to take a break, and the dependence/tolerance scares the hell out of me thinking I'm actually making the dopaminergic dysfunction worse over time but I'm not really at a point in my life where I can slug around any more and not use whatever I can to pick up the pace. I just hope I don't regret treating the executive dysfunction in the long run."
Petioles,feewjm9,t3_eop1f4,1579042752.0,"LOL I felt that, back in college (in fact exactly 4 years ago this week!) had a big snow storm that cancelled classes for a week...instead of trecking over to my ""girlfriend's"" dorm to spend time with her during the day ended up hanging and toking most the time...pretty sure that's why we 'mutually' broke it off like the month after. 

I low key feel that when this is the case it's not well moderated...I mean extreme appreciation for the blissful state that can arise shouldn't be demonized...but when it gets in the way of relationships I think it might deserve reconsideration.

Everything I read said be be generous with the alcohol and sanitation so I didn’t hesitate to keep washing my hands in isopropyl, even dampened a paper towel in iso...I successfully got a single jar inoculated (out of the 6 I purchased presterilized lol) and only used one syringe (out of the 4 purchased)...when the lighter flame caught onto my glove and then the still air box I ran outside to throw water on it but successfully scared the living daylight out of me. Will definitely be more careful next time but my jar is slowly consumed by mycelium so despite that once fuck up I’ll prob give it another shot in the future depending on how the rest of this process goes!

I’ve only been on and off Dexedrine (first vyvanse but didn’t tolerate it so well so went to d-amp) for  almost 4 years now; I still do think I have some sort of legitimate adhd need and I’m very much contemplating jumping back on that train in order to get where I want. It did in tandem with Klonopin *almost* bring my business to hit a homerun but I struck out as my psych pulled me off both meds just about the same time as that huge deal. Threw me into a major depression a year and a half ago I’m still low key trying to get out of. It was my first business and I went into it out of college looking for a learning experience and knew there was a high chance I’d fail. I came so goddamn close to hitting it big and it fell just out of my cognitive grasp as I was majorly withdrawn from both meds. In fact I’m getting a little pissed right now thinking about it...

Anyway I’m trying to figure out sustainable alternatives but still struggling. After almost a year of laying low living with my parents :( found a shitty IT job close to home that’s slowly re-engaging me with society. The klonopin withdrawal I’m convinced fucked me up the most but the ssri I’ve been on concurrently also messes with my motivation and without the Dexedrine I became a slug real fast where I couldn’t answer the phone, emails or texts without having a panic attack. Honestly again I’m still struggling to this day to grapple (now two months off Dexedrine again)...still getting leads from the business but partly still too depressed to follow up..almost like a ptsd from personal business implosion. 

Mushrooms have been something of a miracle tool, although with the damage Klonopin has done, and/or the effect of the SSRI withdrawal/Dexedrine withdrawal my memory is absolutely horrible nowadays and I can barely ever maintain the perspectives gained from shrooms. Combined with mindfulness/meditation I seem to be getting somewhere but nowhere near fast enough."
