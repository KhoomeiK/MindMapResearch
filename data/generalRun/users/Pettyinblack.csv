therapy for all of you and make special time just for him and you. also, get him involved with an extra circular activity to help with his confidence and keeping him busy."

relationship_advice,fgpikd3,t3_ezmxp9,1581005502.0,"masters is marriage and family therapist here. so there is a couple possibilities I see here. 1. she might have been seeking supervision about your case, this can sometimes take place in groups. 2. she could have been case conceptualizing with colleagues, this is something a lot of therapist do. 

as long as she kept your identity confidential than she didn't do anything wrong. it's very rare for therapist to sit and talk about the details of cases with people who aren't other professionals but it is possible. I've definitely talked in very vague terms about a case before but the fact she was sitting with a group of people and she was going into detail leads me to believe these were other professionals.

you can definitely talk to her about it, I your trust is broken find another therapist. you are the client so you can definitely fire her of you want."
puppy101,fgoe7x5,t3_ezmcya,1580967043.0,"more exercise, and active training during short periods. just practice leaving the room and coming back very quickly and if he is calm give him a treat. also, put a towel or blanket over the sides of his crate so he cant really see what's going on and it feels more 'den' like. my husky mix loves denning up under my couch, desk, bed."
