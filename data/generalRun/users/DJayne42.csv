They revaccinated me and every solider around me with everything they possibly could. For the price of your time in service."

communication,ffee08r,t3_eolgel,1579844520.0,If you’re legitimately interested then start out asking her more questions you want to know about her. Show interest and pay attention to little details. If you’re not interested then call it and move on. If she’s doing all the manual labor in holding down the conversation she will lose interest soon.
complaints,ffedrax,t3_er4hq8,1579844274.0,"Here’s my daily PSA: 
Someone legitimately might be on their period. Flow can fluctuate and it’s natural human nature. So, depending on where in the age range they are. I say this cause many middle age 40’s women these days are grandmothers already and still have regular periods.  It might depend whether one is going through peri menopause (cause that’s when things get weird and unpredictable.).  So, women will use more toilet paper during their cycles. 

Don’t sweat it, Just be grateful they flushed. ;)"
