The ""brain drain"" is sending more and more folks from purple and red States to states like mine, where votes don't matter on a federal level. 

I cast an empty vote. I can donate money, but it's nothing compared to the money pouring in from the ruling class.

Do we pick up moderate Republican's by reaching to the center, or do we inspire new voters by nominating a progressive?

I believe we go progressive and inspire first time voters. Apathy killed us in 2016, and with a moderate, it will kill us again."
AskMen,ff7b9ql,t1_ff779ul,1579645347.0,"The anger of ""men's rights"" advocates is a complex thing... Many of them hate women and hold women responsible for the disappointments in their lives... Others are angry because they never get to see their kids, or were falsely accused of rape... Their anger isn't a single thing, and shouldn't be considered as such. 

Men's rights advocates have a PR problem, basically. 

Regarding your second paragraph, I agree. I'd say that both men and women are involved in the oppression of other men and women. Sexism knows no gender, it just takes different forms."
AskMen,ff75jjf,t1_ff6rixo,1579641546.0,"Thanks for being reasonable in your response. 

Causality is always guess work. 

Example: a women doesn't get a promotion. Is it because she is a woman, or is bad at her job? On an individual case we can't know for sure. But when we notice the trend that thousands of women are passed over for promotions we start to wonder.

When we look at suicide, homelessness, and how harsh the justice system can be to men on a large scale (not as individual cases), we see trends that make one wonder."

To your second point. That's actually one of their their main beefs... That they can't be ""victims"" regardless of situations where they are victimized."
AskMen,ff684l7,t1_ff65rg8,1579621381.0,"You make two completely different points...

One is that men who see their gender as something that causes issues are projecting and lashing out. There's plenty of evidence that isn't true.

They should have impeached right then and there... But they were too scared of the divisions impeachment would create among the American people.

They feared that faux news would lie about the report (they did) and convince their viewers it exonerated him. It worked... Look at the arguments you're making... They were right to fear the backlash for speaking the truth, but they should have done it anyway. 

They impeached Trump because after it got away with it (Mueller report) he immediately decided to pressure Ukraine into interfering with our elections, again. Clearly he's going to commit any crimes he thinks he can get away with... Therefore he must be challenged."
