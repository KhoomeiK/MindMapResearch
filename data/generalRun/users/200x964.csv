makeuporganization,fdg3fad,t1_fddnry9,1578378549.0,"Actually, I only tried sample and absolutely loved it. Kind of considering to buy a full size"
makeuporganization,fddaylx,t1_fddatgj,1578303281.0,"Definitely would say their cloudpaint- very buildable and natural looking, stretch concealer, boy brow (personally my holy grail). I also really like their eyeliner and mascara. Lip gloss is also great, but.. let’s be honest- overpriced. Gen G lipsticks are okay too. 

Not the biggest fan of lidstar. Absolutely dislike boy flick. Also I wouldn’t say that I really enjoy their cleanser, not that it’s bad- I do not see myself reaching for it often ."
makeuporganization,fdd5ds6,t1_fdd57ck,1578295532.0,"And I think that most of the products are great. I currently switched to full face of glossier, not sure if I will repurchase all of their products, but some of them are truly amazing."
