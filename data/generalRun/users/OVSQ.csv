computer,fdqkuyv,t3_emryzn,1578669105.0,try a linux boot and see what luck you have.  Also if you are lucky it could be a driver - try removing or replacing components one at a time to see if that helps.  It might be power savings or security settings - try going into the BIOS set up and disabling any power savings or security.  Try a different boot device.

well this is wrong.  The fundamental law of logic is that contradiction is forbidden.  Math is simply a language where contradiction is forbidden.    


\>although logic can be applied within maths it is not necessary.  


This is wrong, when you violate the only law of logic  against contradiction within the confines of math - it is called a mistake.  


\> I can use maths to prove  


As a result of logic's law against contradiction it is the only context were proofs are objectively true.  Because math is a language of logic it falls within that context.  Other attempts to prove things are necessarily flawed."
PhysicsStudents,fcrha5l,t1_fcqxhsh,1577901810.0,science is a method of evaluating evidence.  math is a language.  Saying that all science is mathematical study - is the same as as saying all science is English study.
history,fcp9syb,t1_fcn766o,1577855456.0,">The Abwehr tended to not be quite as fanatical as other branches of the Nazi bureaucracy. That's because there were German organizations that existed before the Nazi takeover, and Nazi organizations that had similar roles. The German Wehrmacht had the Nazi SS to contend with. The Abwehr had the SD. Folks in the SS and SD were appointed based a lot on their loyalty to Hitler, and folks in the Abwehr and Wehrmacht typically had their jobs beforehand and Hitler ""inherited"" them. He tended not to trust those that he inherited nearly as much, and they respected him less in turn.
