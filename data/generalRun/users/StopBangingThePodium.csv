People who study this have recommended we stop the race to have earlier primaries for a while now. 

As for the ""result I think it will have"", the result I think it will have is twofold - One, if we set it a few months before the national, we'll have a shorter election season. That will absolutely do what I think it will. Two, I think that it will diminish the outsized importance placed on early results because there *will be no early results*, they'll all be the same day.

Third, you're ignoring other employment taxes which eat a healthy part of small paychecks. Fourth, you're ignoring gas tax, sales tax, vehicle taxes (not just registration, there's tax on it too). Fucking state made me pay sales tax on my vehicle when I moved here from another state, despite having already paid tax when I purchased it.
40% is an estimate based on math I did at the time and no longer have (it was 20 years ago), but it's not an unreasonable one. I'm sorry that you've never actually sat down and calculated what percentage of your *actual* paycheck goes to the government, but it's considerably more than you realize. (Oh and if you do run the numbers, don't forget to include city services you're required to pay for but don't actually use, like Garbage tax when you share a dumpster that is also paid for separately.)


 Finally, there's  a whack of employment taxes that your employer *technically* pays, but like all expenses on a company they just pass that on to you by paying you less to make up for it. If you count those in, the number actually jumps up another 15%.

What I addressed was the *why* people always think of the ""welfare queen"". Because most of us who have lived in poverty KNOW someone who is a lazy entitled asshole living off the rest of us. Usually multiple someones. So it's not a ""myth"", it's a rarity, but even one is enough to make people very, very angry.

Frankly, we'd be a lot better off if we did scrap all of the disparate systems and just made one system that gave these people a check, especially the ones that are too disabled to work. We would be better off if we had jobs programs instead of some of things we do. All the programs with their special requirements and etc. cost more to administrate than it would to just have one consolidated program that cut checks. And yes, again, we're heading towards a UBI, but we could start with a BIG (and there's a big difference between those. The latter we can afford now, but the former is much better for society, as it's even less overhead to administer and doesn't require people to jump through hoops to prove necessity).

By contrast, we have roughly 40% of the population that can't really afford to pay income tax and are net takers from the federal government in terms of absolute benefits vs. payments, and roughly 20% that can't provide for themselves and their children without direct government benefits. Its an absolutely different situation, economically.
