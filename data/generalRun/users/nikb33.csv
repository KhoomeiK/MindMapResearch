CrohnsDisease,ffntdqd,t3_eu8ds4,1580070547.0,"The first flare is definitely the worst because you have no idea what is going on with your body and you don’t have the proper medications yet to handle it. My organs started shutting down during my very first flare. I have had horrible flares since, but at least now I have treatments and medications in place for it and now know what it feels like."

CrohnsDisease,ffg0dc8,t3_eteypn,1579895731.0,"The good news is that there are a lot of us that can relate and have been there and we will happily lend an ear! Keep copious amounts of hand sanitizer with you at all times. I can no longer drink alcohol and tbh, it was never a big deal for me because I just don’t like drinking like I used to. Be prepared for a lot of uncertainty. This disease causes all kinds of random symptoms and other conditions throughout your entire body that take some time to get used to. I’ve been diagnosed for 18 years now and my symptoms have changed drastically over the years, so when something is going on with my health I have to make sure it’s not just a Crohn’s side effect. Be on top of your emotional and mental health because this disease can drain you and depress you at times. I know it seems all doom and gloom, but I promise you will adjust!"

CrohnsDisease,ffaygfc,t3_eshg85,1579747404.0,That really sucks. I have always been knocked out for my colonoscopies. They never offered an alternative nor would I ever do that awake. That sounds absolutely horrible.
