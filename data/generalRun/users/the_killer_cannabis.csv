It sucks when someone becomes such a massive moment in your life and then you have to treat it like it didn’t matter in order to feel better. GL my guy and feel free to message if you fee like breaking NC again."

Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fehdtdi,t1_feha1ll,1579114491.0,"You can make fun, but I bet you wouldn’t be ok with everyone in the military wearing jeans and a t shirt everyday. We have uniforms for a reason. 

By wearing a soldier’s uniform the police are insinuating they are acting as soldiers, not peacekeepers. It is a completely different mentality and image. 

Would you recommend everyone in the armed forces wear sweatpants to work just because it is cheaper? 

I don’t understand how y’all insist we need to spend more money on the military and police force but now the price tag has become an issue. 

If you are going to try to frame it as a funding issue, I assure you these departments have more than enough funding for this.


Finally, they don’t need to get military gear for cheap *if they don’t need military gear in the first place*"
