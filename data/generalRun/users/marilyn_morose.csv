AdviceAnimals,fff3bjy,t1_fff05f5,1579874572.0,Hol up.
WTF,ffe68bt,t1_ffdfvfb,1579837787.0,Slug slime is surprisingly robust. I used it to great effect protecting opened squid eggs during research. It holds up remarkably well in salt water and keeps germs and shit out of wee vulnerable squid babies.
funny,ffcx8tc,t1_ffbrnpi,1579809167.0,David Sedaris has a good brown towel story...
funny,ffcx5j7,t1_ffblgb7,1579809113.0,Oh right!
funny,ffbcykq,t1_ffbccoi,1579760123.0,It probably costs more money in wages to train staff to sort and wash the black towels separately than to just have all linens wash together.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff8cppc,t3_es3fc1,1579673124.0,Ah ha ha!
aww,ff5crir,t1_ff4sghz,1579587536.0,All the cats currently in my life have been found in various stages of feral ness. I have one sitting on my bed right now who was born in a wood pile and not socialized until she was fully grown. Currently working on socializing a mama kitty who was TNR’d last summer and her yearling kitten. They are starting to trade food for pets! It’s always worthwhile to show them love.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff4ekl3,t1_ff4d814,1579561746.0,I thought you were going to go for wife for the different angle. Daughter is good though!
funny,ff4dd3f,t1_ff4d3ow,1579560946.0,How sweet is it to you?
funny,ff49qwl,t1_ff44tgt,1579558627.0,"It’s more that they think if someone has nothing they’ll be glad to have expired peas. Beggars can’t be choosers! 

It’s why food pantries often just ask for money instead of donations from food drives. They spend more time, money, and effort clearing out the inappropriate stuff that is donated than they benefit."
funny,ff497oe,t3_ereyt4,1579558294.0,Anyone else mesmerized by the wiener?
funny,ff491la,t1_ff3ribz,1579558189.0,"Breast milk is quite sweet. People liken it to sweetened milk or the milk left after eating sugar cereal. It’s probably not a stretch to compare it to melted ice cream.

Kids already have a sweet tooth - sweet foods are safer, evolutionarily speaking, than bitter foods. They grow out of it by watching people around them eating other things and by their caregivers offering other foods."

royalfamily,fetcncy,t1_feqtcww,1579373967.0,I was just thinking that there wouldn’t really be a purpose for flying Prince Phillip in the described manner. Logically I couldn’t use the flight as “proof” he died because it didn’t make sense. On twitter and in the news people were using info about the flight as a source for his “death” and it didn’t gel with me.

TheCrownNetflix,fepqfkk,t1_fepmscc,1579327828.0,"What is the purpose of flying him from Northolt to Heathrow, a distance of about 8 miles? Nothing says anyone was flying from Sandringham, and if there was a flight from Sandringham it could go directly to Heathrow."
royalfamily,fepmpo9,t1_fepff3t,1579324609.0,Why would they fly him from Northolt to Heathrow? It’s only a few miles.
WTF,fen8wwd,t1_felzhic,1579279537.0,"Yikes, that’s  not “needs work” that’s a ground up restoration."
WTF,fen863s,t1_fempfwi,1579279079.0,"People freak out about it. In my state it’s part of the legal disclosure form and if you lie about it the purchase can be voided or you can be sued. It’s big creep factor for some people. 

On the other hand, people die all kinds of ways and places, so if you truly want a guaranteed no-one-died-here house, buy new construction."
WTF,fekaury,t1_fekaly8,1579196202.0,Good reddit. Soothing anxieties.
