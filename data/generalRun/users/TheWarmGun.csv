Showerthoughts,fgt0g7g,t3_f08nna,1581096462.0,"The best part is that, for the most part, clothing is made by the same manufacturers regardless of price. Sometimes the only difference is the label."
askportland,fgksbys,t1_fgjehuo,1580872517.0,Did you ever go to Black’s?
Portland,fgjhd7s,t3_eyr5yf,1580844071.0,Pretty sure this is the guy who got convicted of abusing his vet medications.
todayilearned,fghx5qb,t1_fgh9924,1580796646.0,I came here to mention this lol. It’s nuts that my state is like the one place it’s grown outside of Japan.
Fantasy,fgcjt9t,t1_fgc0232,1580673266.0,"I have that problem. I can't read Malazan in small bits, like before bed at night. I have to save it for vacations and stuff where I can read for hours, because otherwise I spend most of the time trying to remember who the 1000 characters are."

Portland,ffvg3t0,t1_fftnvkc,1580263309.0,I'm willing to bet that replacing batteries is eventually going to be cheaper than the new diesel emissions systems.

Firefighting,ffsoxxp,t3_eur6hp,1580187510.0,"My dad started in ‘77, and there was one engine with a huge Continental gas engine. He swore that if you downshifted roughly, it would backfire and shoot flames out the side pipes."
Portland,ffrq4n6,t3_esk75f,1580163335.0,I see zero problem with this. It’s kinda telling that Hardesty and others spend more time bitching and moaning about this than working on a solution.
Portland,ffrp72i,t3_esgqtk,1580162753.0,I’ve definitely seen that guy on I-5 south. He was weaving all over the place like a drunk asshole.

Portland,ffroind,t1_ffedqb5,1580162331.0,Can you imagine trying to get in/out of a parking lot there? Not to mention the sheer volume of noise from the streetcar and trains.
Portland,ffroekm,t1_ffe5sbk,1580162261.0,"There is one near NW 23rd that is now a home, but was once a workshop for a dude who restored vintage (read: steam powered) fire engines.

He let PFB move the engines from their museum to there for safe keeping during the ‘96 flood.

Source: my dad was the FF in change of moving them.

They are neat AF and I love them."

AskReddit,ffpl9td,t1_ffo82zp,1580097830.0,Except the heroin trade.
morbidquestions,ffnpnb6,t1_ffmu0f7,1580069036.0,"Even worse, the US is basically 50 small nations, each with their own set of laws and regulations that vary enormously from one to another. Norway has 5.3\~ million people and one set of laws for the whole country (AFAIK). By comparison, just short of half of all US states have a population greater than or equal to the population of Norway, and many of those states exceed it by tens of millions of people. California and Texas, for instance, have 39.9 and 29.4 million people each, respectively. Each of these states has a staggering number of individual laws and criminal codes for everything from gun possession, to vehicle licensing, and even things like waste disposal. Marijuana is a great example: you can straight up purchase it in a store in numerous states, while in others even a single joint can get you a criminal record, if not jail time.

To say that comparing Norway to the US is in any way accurate or even fair is pretty ignorant."
morbidquestions,ffnocff,t1_ffmdags,1580068506.0,"Serious question: what is the economic situation like in Norway? Is there a wide disparity in wealth? Because poverty is IMO the biggest driver of crime, and is one of the reasons (combined with our bullshit legal system) so many folks in in prison in the US. ""Rehabilitating"" them wouldn't change anything if they still don't have the opportunity to support themselves without resorting to crime/ violating laws that basically criminalize poverty."
Fallout,ffnif47,t1_ffn6v2b,1580066340.0,"So incredibly annoying when they say shit like that. Realistically, EVERYBODY would know of you at the very least, given the amount of insane shit you have done as PC."
Fallout,ffngp4t,t1_ffn1qcn,1580065728.0,"Cooking is surprisingly easy to learn but difficult to master, and it is incredibly rewarding. Easily one of my favorite things.

Also it is like the best way to save money on living expenses."
Fallout,ffngfdd,t1_ffmsaey,1580065605.0,Real life caravan trains would often link up in large groups so that they could defend each other. Maybe that is too realistic for these games.

WoT,ffg5poi,t1_ff8wg8j,1579899018.0,"It wasn't a sheer dress. It was an embarrassingly bright light blue one that she hated and she wore it to punish herself for >!not feeling bad about the death of her uncle King Laman, as well as a few other things she felt guilty about.!<

Edit: And the dresses thing wasn't just about dresses. It is about remaking herself into what an Aes Sedai is ""supposed"" to be. It also serves to show just how different Moiraine and Siuan are in many ways. I found it also served pretty well as a bit of world-building, and I enjoyed it."
WoT,ffg2v57,t3_etfl2f,1579897268.0,"Duh? Its a prequel. You should never start with a prequel. 

On the book itself, I like it rather a lot. Probably because Lan and Moiraine are my favorite characters. Seeing their backstory in greater detail is awesome, but it felt rushed to me. It could have easily been a full-length novel."
CCW,fffzigb,t1_fff2rcw,1579895202.0,"When I read about it, it was mentioned in relation to battlefield injuries from shrapnel and other fun stuff related to explosives, not necessarily GSWs.

I’m just relating something I read from a qualified professional."
AskReddit,fffugy4,t1_fff45kc,1579892054.0,The fucking staircase one. Just thinking about it makes all the hairs on my neck stand up. Gah.
AskReddit,fffudnn,t1_fffp1lv,1579891998.0,"093 is the absolute tits. Top 5, easily. And definitely among the very best of the Series 1 skips."
CCW,ffeftdz,t1_ffeeil0,1579846364.0,"Having worked with some ""smart people"" in the medical field, I can tell you they get a remarkable amount of tunnel vision when it comes to doing anything that isn't directly in their wheelhouse, while simultaneously being terrible at realizing it. 

By all means, have a qualified and experienced medical professional approve/design the curriculum. But don't let them decide who can teach a course that is literally designed so that ANYBODY can learn it."
CCW,ffeflnu,t1_ffef91r,1579846136.0,"It does not take advanced medical schooling to learn how to use tourniquets, pack wounds or anything else being taught in those classes. 

If it was a matter of expertise, Law enforcement officers, pharmacists, dietitians, ski patrol members and numerous others wouldn't be qualified to teach it.

In reality, this is entry-level stuff, and as such, a train-the-trainer course should be available to anybody who can pass it."
CCW,ffef92y,t1_ffe9cgy,1579845772.0,"Might try a tennis or other small, hard ball and a tourniquet to put pressure on a femoral bleed or other hard to reach hemorrhage. Use the ball to put pressure on the bleed and then rachet the tourniquet down over the ball to keep it in place.

I read this in a show and tell article about SOF medic's pack contents but now I cannot find it for the life of me."
CCW,ffeegsm,t1_ffe7krn,1579844973.0,Some of those make absolutely no sense whatsoever.

nextfuckinglevel,ffcjd62,t1_ffcj771,1579800706.0,It was pump that basically had to be disassembled to clean it. I've seen the pictures. It is possible I am missing some details; I don't do field work.
nextfuckinglevel,ffciocv,t1_ffchzws,1579800291.0,"Our guys can get overtime, but its only for specific jobs. He was basically making more work that only he could do, during a time of the year where overtime was rare."

AskReddit,fek5m84,t1_fek4w0z,1579193101.0,A lack of sharp knives will fuck up cooking for anybody. I recommend a Victorinox chef's knife to anybody who thinks they can't afford a good kitchen knife.
AskReddit,fek4hf8,t1_fejgcva,1579192420.0,"Uh, you can literally buy one for like $150 on Amazon or at Walmart. They even advertise using it for alcohol.

Edit: please keep in mind that using it for drinking alcohol in the US requires some complicated permitting from the Treasury Dept., and possibly your state government as well."

I've heard that serious dudes preferred the thicker swords for serious use, and that some 'schools' of swordmaking tended towards thick blades for such reasons."
