TrueReddit,fgg739o,t1_fgg6j2s,1580755663.0,"its really up to city planners/traffic management i assume.  They know where people are driving.  And they know the reason why people are driving where theyre driving.  Roads are continually evolving and changing (either physically or through changes at intersections).  I assume this is going to be an everchanging problem that city planners will just have to deal with as it happens.   Fix an intersection, it will change the flow of traffic naturally back off the NIMBY's streets and onto the thouroughfares"
