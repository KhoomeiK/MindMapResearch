IncelTears,ffishis,t1_ffdlker,1579981594.0,"Let me give you some advice I learnt the hard way.

I once had a crush on a girl when I was younger, we were on the same course for 4 years and in all that time I never had the courage to ask her out, I was thinking all the time ""oh, she so awesome she must have a boyfriend already"", turns out she didn't and I found that out when she started dating one of my other friends 4 years later. 

That is one of my biggest regrets in life, and I still sometimes think of what could have been if I had asked her out, and it also stopped me from moving on for those 4 years. If I had asked her out at the start, it may have worked, it which case great, or it may not have worked out, not so great but its something that I could have got over in at worst a few weeks and I would have been more open to develop other relationships in that time. 

Since then I have been rejected by a couple of other crushes, and I can tell you that its nowhere near as bad as the regret of never asking and thinking of what might have been.

As for how you should ask, I'd say just invite her to a coffee shop (maybe after exams) and see where it goes from there, and if it doesn't work out it will hurt for like a week or two, but trust me, you will get over it pretty quickly."

space,ffbxpve,t1_ffbcbf4,1579786136.0,"Last time I studied this stuff was probably some 10 years ago, bit from memory, as hydrogen is used up, gravitation starts to win over the outward radiative pressure until the core is so dense that it starts to fuse helium, and it carries on going through cycles of this eventually fusing heavier and heavier elements until Iron, at which point it becomes energetically unfavourable to fuse any heavier elements, at which point the star goes supernova and you are left with a giant gas cloud and a dense supernova remnant.

The length of time that a star can sustain the fusion of heavier elements decreases exponentially, so a star can sustain hydrogen fusion for hundreds of millions/billions of years, helium fusion for millions-tens of millions of years, down to possibly only a few days for whatever elements you need to fuse to get iron (don't have a periodic table to hand).

My (semi-educated) guess is that what is happening is that it is transition to the fusion of heavier elements, and if we are lucky (from an astronomy point of view) it is one of the final transitions that could only take a few years/decades before the star goes supernova.

I could of course be completely wrong about this or our knowledge might have evolved in the last 10 years, but I am excited to conceivably be able to see a supernova in my lifetime."

I went to university, got a Physics degree and a Phd, in an area that is in pretty high demand, did everything right according to what they told me, yet I am now confronted with a lot of jobs that require extremely high qualifications, with little stability and low pay. I don't mind getting low pay if I like the job, I'm just put off by the prospect of having to move every 2-3 years until I'm 40 if I want an academic career.

When I shared my frustration with my parents about facing the choice of abandoning my dream job, or having no stability in sight, they called me a snowflake, told me that if I wanted stability I should have become a binman, that I am too clever for my own good, and that I shouldn't complain because out of all the people in my generation in the family I'm the one that's most stable and doing best career wise, despite being years behind where my parents were at my age.

Another thing is you should try to understand what it is that makes you struggle with certain food. If for example your problem is the texture of, say, fruit and vegetables, you might get somewhere if you try a juice or a soup instead.
