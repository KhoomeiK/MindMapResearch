In the spring and summer men with propane exchanges. Men are way harder to sell too unless they're 65 and older and are regulars. So for the men younger than 65 It's way more effort. So for the men with propane exhanges and tell them. ME: ""I can get you 10$ off your propane exchange"" C: ""how ?"" Me: upgrade your CVS card today and I will give you off 10$ today and If you want to cancel it tomorrow you totally can.  If you decide you want to keep it for future propane exchanges for the season this first month is free but would be 5$ thereafter which you can link to your credit card . You can also save 20% on any cvs brand items that you may need.  You can use the 10$ promo on almost anything else as well. If you signup today your promo would be on - *insert the day it is* - every month and it wont expire until the day before your next carepass is to renew which is on the - *insert previous days date*.-"

""3) Are they on company-paid leave (salary continuation, exhausting paid time under an FMLA policy, etc.)?

If they are on company-paid leave, they are being paid by you so there is no Wage and Hour violation if they work.

4) Are they receiving third party payments (short-term disability or Workers’ Compensation)?

If so, supplemental pay may affect their eligibility for third party payments. Check your disability insurance plan document to see if this is allowed. If on Workers’ Compensation leave, you would report any earnings."""

""Some ways that employers may be found to have interfered with an employee’s leave include forcing an employee to complete an assignment, and denying or discouraging an employee from taking leave. Although interference is determined on a case-by-case basis, employers should be mindful that allowing an employee to work on leave may constitute impermissible interference.

Employers who pay for FMLA leave but allow or require employees to perform work while on paid leave also put themselves at risk of a claim for interference with leave. Although the employee is being paid, the basis for the leave is a medical necessity.  Thus, the employee would be entitled to the protections provided under the FMLA even though he or she is being paid."""
