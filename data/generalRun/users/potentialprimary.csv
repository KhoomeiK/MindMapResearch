If on the due date for the contract the price on the market is higher from that stated in the contract, you can make money as you can buy it cheaper (and then sell it on the market at the higher price). If the market price is lower than the price for your put contract, you buy the stock on the market and then sell it for more than the market price.

Alternatively, if the opposite is true (you have a call, and the market price drops to below your contract price) then your contract is worthless. However you are never forced to execute the contract (whether they're in the red or the black) so if your contract is not profitable your loss is practically limited by the purchase price of the call/put.

explainlikeimfive,fcuufrp,t3_ej1lnl,1577988733.0,"Buying a call contract right now gives you the opportunity to buy a stock at a fixed price in the future. For a put, this allows you to sell stock at a fixed price at a later date.

If on the due date for the contract the price on the market is higher from that stated in the contract, you can make money as you can buy it cheaper (and then sell it on the market at the higher price). If the market price is lower than the price for your put contract, you buy the stock on the market and then sell it for more than the market price.

Alternatively, if the opposite is true (you have a call, and the market price drops to below your contract price) then your contract is worthless. However you are never forced to execute the contract (whether they're in the red or the black) so if your contract is not profitable your loss is practically limited by the purchase price of the call/put.

The people creating the contracts are 'writing calls' and 'writing puts', and those are actually enforced. So those people must honor the contract if so requested."
