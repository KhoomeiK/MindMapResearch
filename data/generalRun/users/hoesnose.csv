depression,fd7lszl,t3_ek3uky,1578206460.0,"Please don’t take this as it being about you. She didn’t cheat on you for anything you can control and I know it doesn’t make it hurt any less, but please know that you are worth more than how others treat you, even though it sometimes may not feel like it"
depression,fcmby1h,t3_ehyatw,1577769977.0,"Art isn’t about being good every time. It’s about expression and growth. Your skill level can’t be determined by anyone, because everyone has their own tastes and their tastes are subjective. You aren’t bad at it, you’re just out of practice and haven’t re established your love for art after it became a chore for you. Please be patient with yourself"
depression,fcmbpzx,t3_ehye82,1577769782.0,I understand this wholeheartedly to a painful extent. It’s hard to understand your value when you’ve been broken down from a young age. But people who hurt you do not determine your value. People who hurt you determine their value from their ability to cause harm to others.

Repressedmemories,fcmal8r,t3_eht0do,1577768798.0,"Please message me I have something similar going on with you as does one of my friends... you are not alone, you are whole as you are. And it hurts and it’s scary and secluding but there is no end to the love and support you will receive outside of your circle..please reach out to someone"
