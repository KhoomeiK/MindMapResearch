MMA,fffgcfa,t1_fffcynm,1579883355.0,I don't understand why his clinch was so loose and why he didn't turn his head after the first or second shoulder strike. I haven't seen the replay since the fight but it all seemed really weird. He automatically took out his biggest chance of winning by telling people that he wasn't gonna use it. This shows a fighter doesn't care whether they win or lose. 'We're gonna go out and have a scrap and what happens happens' is the vibe I got.  Win or lose the money was there. I'm not saying it was scripted but it certainly feels like Cowboy did what he was supposed to do rather than told to do.

TraceAnObject,ffe2504,t3_esz31t,1579834727.0,"Reminds me a lot of a fake generic football polo shirt parents would buy their kids during the 80s/90s. Most football shirts have their badges on the left tho which is why I think it's generic and not actually meant to be anything. The logo on the right looks like the Portugal flag to me. I've spent the past 30 minutes looking through Spanish and Portuguese football logos and also coat-of-arms for something resembling the symbol on the left and found nothing similar. 

I notice people stating it could be Mexican tho. Can someone confirm that these pictures were taken in Europe or in N.A?"

Advice,femld83,t1_femkwvt,1579261254.0,"Been introverted all my life and there's absolutely nothing wrong with it. It's who we are. Us as individuals are more caring of others and are able to see the bigger picture. I'm so glad everyone's positive messages are helping you. You just gotta hang in there, things really do get better. Adults have set backs now and again but it's how we deal with the setbacks that make us into better people. Someday someone will need your help and you won't hesitate to give it to them. You can look back at all these messages and see how even when things seem hopeless there's still people all over the world that care and that can lend you their strength."

MMA,fek9njz,t1_fejy3gq,1579195496.0,Conor has that big of an influence people are shit scared to say anything negative about him. If they do say something negative the diehard fans sink the channel/podcast/media-platform and stand to lose money or draw hate towards themselves.

dankmemes,fdwh9g2,t1_fdwdrk9,1578758672.0,"Sort of a smug way of saying ""I'm coming up on your left"" or ""Check your left"".  Wouldn't be used very often in many contexts other than in vehicles if you need to communicate and even then there's better ways to say it."

getdisciplined,fc9fkim,t1_fc9c82l,1577551942.0,Try joining a channel that isn't necessarily about gaming. I joined one called Knights of Academia where users are very friendly and help motivate eachother to getting where they want to be.
getdisciplined,fc977cp,t1_fc77wwt,1577548132.0,You ever thought about joining some online communities? There are sooo many to choose from. Ever heard of Discord? It's basically the modern day chatroom but people are religious about it myself included. If I'm on my PC I will almost always have Discord open in the background.
darksouls,fbrg3k7,t3_edz85l,1577042535.0,Should have been series of the decade. Show me another game that belongs at the top spot and I'll tell you why you're wrong.
