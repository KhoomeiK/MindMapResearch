Diagon Alley is in the main park. It has more shops but just about everything you can buy there can be bought in Hogsmeade.

Both parks can be done in one day if you start early and have a fast pass. Without the fast pass, you won't have time to see everything."

His comeback wasn't celebrated for what he did, it was celebrated because he had fans who missed tuning into his stream. I don't think that anyone would disagree that cheating on your spouse is wrong, I certainly don't. My point is that it is petty when it has absolutely nothing to do with anyone outside of his family and those directly affected. They have moved on from it, and so should you."
LivestreamFail,fc7dkd9,t1_fc78n7k,1577504274.0,"Okay, sure. But the fact that they as a family have moved on and people like you are still hung up on it is honestly pretty petty. You're literally meming it because you don't like him as a streamer, end of story."
