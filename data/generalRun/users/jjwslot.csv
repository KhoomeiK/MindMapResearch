It is a little easier now with celebrities share their diagnosis with the public.  Bringing more research monies to help find treatment for these diseases.

You will have to ensure your wife that you are ok with her being ill.  But, you will have to be strong with her taking the medication.  You will need to set hard boundaries of what will be accepted.  Always tell her you love her.   It will be a lot of work for you even when she does get home."

bipolar,fdl44z0,t3_elyc53,1578516729.0,"Straight antidepressants worsens the symptoms of bipolar.  Bipolar people need mood stabilizers.  One of the best mood stabilizers is lithium.  But, it's effective dose is close to the toxic amount.  The lithium levels needs close monitoring, to minimize kidney damage.

CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy is useful.  Protecting you sleep is great as is keeping a basic schedule, including meals.  Finding a hobby and getting out of the house is extremely helpful.

I also try to take part of any bipolar study that comes along.

The most helpful thing you can do for bipolar is accepting that you are bipolar.  I struggled with that for awhile.  After that, be honest with yourself and your doctor.  Finally, don't self medicate."

bipolar,fcyt34h,t3_ejl8o0,1578086485.0,"You will probably need medication.  At least a mood stabilizer.  You don't want to get caught in the top or bottom of the bipolar waves.  The mid stabilizer will flatten out the highs and lows.

Afterward, tell the doc you want to make changes  to one medicine at a time.  It is easier to see the changes that medication makes.

Most meds take 2-4 weeks to be at therapeutic levels.

Tell yourself and your doctor the truth.  Don't self medicate, no alcohol, no drugs and no weed.  The doctor has a hard enough job developing your treatment plan.  The doctor doesn't need you spiking the medication plan.  Accept that you have a serious disease that can put yoour life in jeopardy."

Once your diagnosed, the best thing you can do is accept it.  After that, DO NOT try to self medicate with alcohol or illicit drug use, that includes weed.  Next be honest with yourself and your doctor, even if you are embarrassed.  Your doctor only has your thoughts, actions and symptoms to develop a treatment plan.  Also, DO NOT go off your meds without your doctor's approval.  Remember these medicines take time(2-4 weeks) to take hold.  After the initial processes try to make one change at a time.  It is easier to see what each drug is doing.

This is a terrible disease to live with.  I let it be known that I suffer from it.  The more people in my social circles that know about it, the more people that can possibly notice me being ""off"".  They can ask what's up?  Because you might not notice that you are acting odd.  Many times that can reset your focus or get you to a doctor.  If anyone goes cold towards you for having bipolar, they weren't your friend in the first place.

Here is what I generally tell people who say think happy thoughts.  I tell people that bipolar is a physical health problem.  Mental illness is a lie.  Bipolar is like diabetes.  The body is not making enough of the proper chemicals to stay healthy.  You can't think your body into making brain chemicals anymore than you can think it into making insulin.

My manias are shorter and actually allow me to get many things accomplished.  Depressions can sink me, make me more likely to be destructive.  When mixed it is bad because I am energized and destructive.  Not so much to material things but to relationships and situations."
