Not all cats, but somewhere under half of them will retain a sensitivity in that area into adulthood that will make them respond similarly to this when it is scratched.

Lol. So you really think if humans layed eggs you would be completely fine with them being kept as slaves to some higher being? I call bullshit. Fine. Let’s say they like breast milk or human urine. You think there is nothing morally or ethically wrong with an alien species taking humans as slaves, feeding them and caring for them, in order to mass collect their urine/breast milk for consumption? That the humans just have to take it whether they want it or not because there is another species with much higher intelegence than us?

I highly doubt it. 

>	They even see pets as unethical, and have been known to kidnap and euthanize them. 

Things like this are just scare mongering. Yes there have been crazy people that have done crazy things. That isn’t somehow representative of the group. People who have eaten meat have also been cannibals. Does that say something about the majority of meat eaters? No it does not. 

>	Meanwhile they constantly defend the torture and consumption of dogs, cats, etc in Asian black markets because “Cultural differences” which is bullshit since many people in that culture despise that practice as well. 

You seem to be arguing against some SJW boogeyman. I doubt there is a significant amount of people you can find that hold these views while being vegan. Again, the fact that you can point to a small subset of people that hold ridiculous views doesn’t mean anything.

I’m sure you meet vegans every single day that you get along with very well. Not every one of them feel the need to preach to others. Yes, just like with every other group, the ones that are really preachy are annoying."
insanepeoplefacebook,ffg2q7b,t1_ffg1khx,1579897184.0,"I just stated that veganism isn’t defined by harm to the animal. It is defined by treating an animal like a commodity. 

I’m not vegan. I’m not trying to defend their principles. I’m just pointing out what it is they actually believe. They don’t think using another living thing to produce a tangible good is ethical. They would argue modern chickens just shouldn’t exist. It isn’t about the level of harm caused (although their argument would be that existing as a species entirely subservient to another *is* the harm), it’s that they are being treating like a commodity and exploited for their labor. 

Would we be happy if an alien species way more advanced than us came and took away our freedom and inseminated us over and over again do they could remove the embryos from our bodies and eat them as a snack? I mean they house us. They feed us. They treat us real good. There is nothing wrong with human husbandry!

That’s sort of the idea they would be going with. Just because you can argue they aren’t as harmed as an animal that is being killed doesn’t mean that everything is on the up and up. Unless you wouldn’t mind another living thing owning you and treating you the same exact way your friends treated their chickens. That is still a situation where we are treating the chicken like a commodity. 

Again. I’m not vegan. I do personally think factory farming is unethical, but I don’t personally feel the same for all animal husbandry. But I at least understand their arguments and don’t think they are completely ridiculous."

insanepeoplefacebook,fffyj8g,t1_fffxoym,1579894598.0,"Most wouldn’t because they just generally don’t eat meat. It isn’t like they are sitting around waiting for a chance to ethically eat meat. 

But if you are asking if they could and it would still be vegan, then technically yes. It is just Ike the roadkill question. Is it vegan to eat roadkill? Technically yes. But I doubt you will find more than a handful of people that do it. 

It’s also important to understand that not everybody will use the word “vegan” the same way. While eating roadkill isn’t technically against the original definition of vegan, There are some people who use the word to refer to simply abstaining from eating meat. They might not care about the ethical principles behind veganism and may just have a meatless diet for something like health reasons, but still use the word vegan to describe their diet because they don’t consume any meat. Technically these people are just using the word because of their meatless diet’s similarity to what vegans practice, but I’m just saying there are definitely uses of the word that solely refer to “meatless diet”."
insanepeoplefacebook,fffxfjy,t1_ffffxr9,1579893912.0,"No, not necessarily. The main point of veganism isn’t that they are against all harm to animals, it is that they don’t believe in treating animals as a commodity. 

It isn’t that if an animal was attacking a vegan they wouldn’t be able to defend themselves as that would cause harm to the animal. No, nothing about that would be treating the animal like a commodity, and that is the part they are shying away from. 

So in the same way there is no problem with taking care of pests. You aren’t treating the pest like a commodity by getting rid of it."

What you are basically saying is you enjoy eating meat enough to not care that you have to kill other living , thinking beings to do so. It is an incredibly selfish thing to do, and the only reason people do so so willingly while claiming it isn't wrong is because such a large percentage of the population sees it as socially acceptable.

Whether you agree with that or not, what your comment boils down to is an acknowledgement that it doesn't matter whether killing animals is wrong or not, that it is the only way we can produce fresh meat so you will continue to do so.

I think that is a much more accurate assessment of one's position than most people would admit when talking about the topic of the morality/ethics behind eating meat. So many people try to act like there isn't anything morally or ethically wrong with that.

If I had to put money on it I would bet that once we ""perfect"" some sort of lab grown meat and it becomes widely produced the social acceptability of eating meat that came from a living animal will change drastically.

Maybe an argument could be made that it has to be close in time to when you committed your crime or even argue that it is more about mindset and intent of the individual.

CIA officials die all the time when they are exposed while being in other countries, and those certainly aren’t deaths that really warrant going to war over. It’s actually pretty understandable for the very implications that made you raise it. Their line of work does sort of provide reason for it. I think this is actually true for Soleimani. His work does cause him to be a target.

That being said, no, this isn’t simply a case of the show coming to and end and fans being disappointed in that. The writing genuinely does take a turn for the worse starting around season 6. 

One of the main reasons for this is the last two books of the series haven’t been written yet. Somewhere around season 4 they decided that because the books weren’t completed (only 5 of the 7 books are completed), essentially what they were going to do was drop most of the content that is written in books 4 and 5 and while they got the overarching plot points that George R R Martin planned on reaching, they were going to wrap things up their own way. 

When doing this, a lot of the richness that came from the writing was just... lost. They started doing things that made for cool visuals on the screen but didn’t make much sense from a storytelling perspective, and one of the reasons GoT was such a good show for so long was because the deep narrative payoffs that came from the intricacies of Martin’s writing. Things that use to have real world weight and consequences switched to very clearly being forced in simply to serve the narrative. Payoffs were replaced with contrivances. 

Season 8 is just the culmination of all of the short cuts they decided they would take coming together with very little payoff. Developments that very clearly needed multiple books worth of development to make sense is just sort of shoe horned together in a way that is again,  very visually pleasing, just doesn’t make a ton of sense and doesn’t have a lot of the literary payoff that is what made the series so astounding in the first place.

You say something below about attributing this sentiment to a hive mind. I get it, and I actually do agree it gets a little bit blown out of proportion. I hate how the new cool thing seems to be to hate any media that becomes too popular. But this really isn’t simply that. Watch for yourself before coming to those conclusions. And I do actually recommend a watch. It is still one of the best shows ever made. It’s just that the end of the series isn’t as great as the beginning. It is still alright though, and from a visual perspective the final seasons are probably the best of the entire series. It is just the writing quality that takes a pretty big hit."

Scientology brainwashes into the heads of all members that even researching anything in the media that criticizes Scientology will get them labelled a subversive person (or SP) and will be ostracized from their family and friends.

The other things is that Scientology has now been around for 70 years or so. Most of the most damning information about Scientology has only really been widely public for the last 15 years or so with some of the most widely spread of that being within the last 5 to 10. The Religion already deep roots by that point. Acting like it is as simple as 'since that information is all out there now there is no excuse' is just really naive.

Either way, Kudos. I am glad I could get you to your actual argument.

I do think cult members do deserve special attention to the fact that the whole reason cults exist is because they use manipulation tactics on vulnerable people, but either way, they do have responsibility for the group  succeeding.

That clearly was not what the conversation was about. It was about how every person who is a modern day Nazi is one because they actually believe in the ideology and therefore can all be condemned for directly supporting that ideology itself in a way that can't be said about all scientologists. Most get in it because it is literally set up as a scam self-help thing to hook people, and members are brainwashed about how they will be ostracized if they look up any outside critical information about Scientology.

To say the desperate fools who get hooked into this shit are the same as fucking people who subscribe to Nazi ideology is the stupidest thing I have ever heard.

I *strongly* recommend the documentary *Going Clear* (2015) by HBO, along with a pair of BBC Panorama documentaries titled *Scientology and Me* (2007) and *The Secrets of Scientology* (2010). They are extremely revealing about the behind the scenes of the organization and the horrible things they do.

That’s literally what their provocations intend to do. And your response is just to repeat that the are long-rooted American problems and I’m uneducated on history? Okay...

I’ll say it again. The reason you are using for saying Russia clearly isn’t involved is a stupid one because it lines up directly with the sorts of things they target. Preexisting tensions between Iran and the US are exactly why they would want to further provoke those tensions rather than trying to get us to enter a war with Zimbabwe or something.

This is so successful because not only is it obvious that provoking preexisting tensions will have more success than ones people otherwise previously cared nothing about, but it has the secondary benefit of ensuring exactly what you are doing. Get most of the populace to dismiss as any claims of Russian provocation being effective, since racial tensions between white and black people is as American as apple pie. “How could you possibly say *this* is Russia’s doing? This is such an obvious American problem!”

This fails to understand how serious those provocations can be and how much further they can cause chaos to ensue in comparison to if those existing tensions would have existed on their own without any provocation.

I’m certainly not saying I think it is likely that Russia shot down this airplane, I just don’t like how people can be dismissive of any warnings of Russian interference for the reason that these issues are inherently American.

A business does need people to work. And they are going to often have a much worse time with people that are will to straight up tell their potential employer they are only there for the paycheck.

It’s a stupid question but it sort of serves its purpose for that very reason."

While there is a social service component to where I work which means some people really do want the job for larger reasons, I understand most people are just there for a paycheck. Questions like this are less about finding a person who is excited about some deep passion to help others (although that does help a lot in creating the sort of culture you want in your workplace), the main benefit to this sort of question is simply weeding people out that aren’t going to put a lot of thought/effort into their response. It doesn’t rule them out immediately, but when I have five good candidates, the answers to questions like that do sometimes end up mattering. 

The art of bullshitting is not something everybody excels at and it can often go a very long way in the customer service industry. Somebody that can easily bullshit those questions with flowery answers on the spot are likely going to be better at doing the same thing when dealing with problem customers. 

Again, this is generally only ever relevant when there are multiple candidates who are somewhat tied with each other in the hiring process, but it can be helpful. 

It is an extra large slap in the face for a place like Walmart though, I will give you that. 

But if you can’t realize that an answer like “Because I live close by” is probably not the sort of answer that an employer is looking for when asking why you want to work for them, it can be indicative of you not realizing a lot of other really obvious things. And while that isn’t always the case, when there are three other people that did just as well as you but came up with better answers on that question, how could you really fault them for going with the other person?"
insanepeoplefacebook,fdj3jbc,t1_fdiop6c,1578457489.0,"Lol, no. I never once claimed any such thing. People that think others shouldn’t have the choice to abort due to ontegenical reasons are still themselves coming down on one side of the question on whether or not the individual has the right to choose. They just have certain reasons why they fell on one side or the other. 

And sure, you are right that people opinion on when they go from having a choice to abort to no longer having a choice to abort, but that doesn’t change the fact that even then you are talking about the duality of an individual being able to choose or not. 

If you think they do have a choice up until a certain point and not after you are still pro-choice. Just because there is a discussion about when is an appropriate cut-off doesn’t change the fact that the choice question is a binary. You either think a human never has the right to abort an embryo/fetus or you think they do have a choice. There is no third option there. Saying they think they have a choice but there is a bigger conversation regarding when that ends still means they are coming out pro-choice. 

“Pro-choice” doesn’t mean “you think people should have the right to abort up until birth.” Or just means that you think they have that right at some point.

You can think people have the right to abort up until birth. You could think they only have the right to abort up until a certain trimester. You can think they only have the choice the first week they find out and the. They lose the choice after that week if you really wanted to. You can think that abortion itself is wrong and immoral but that people should still have the right to choose for themselves. You could also just love the idea of killing babies so want people to have the choice for that reason (although this fictional boogeyman generally doesn’t exist). 

All of the above describe a person who is pro-choice."
unpopularopinion,fdj2ytr,t1_fdiwho1,1578457077.0,"You disagree with what? That people have different sexual preferences? Just because it is the most popular porn sub doesn’t mean that everybody enjoys it. It’s popular because people like “real/amateur” stuff and it doesn’t get more authentic than other average reddit users showing you their goods. 

That doesn’t at all mean those people think that is the only sort of porn that everybody in the world likes. Again, the fact that people have sexual preferences isn’t at all refuted by the fact that gonewild is popular. I’m sure most of those users understand that not everybody likes the same stuff as them. I’m not sure why you would think otherwise."
