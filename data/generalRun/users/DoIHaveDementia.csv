aww,fg5dspq,t1_fg5dmiq,1580524813.0,You're never gonna accomplish stuff if you let your anxiety hold you back. I've been there. Sometimes you're kinda just too freaked out and it halts you in your steps. I say just go for it. Prepare yourself the best you can and then throw yourself in the deep end. You can do it!
aww,fg570zm,t1_fg5408d,1580519863.0,"Please don't use a light with your leopard geckos. They're nocturnal, which means they wouldn't be in the light in the wild. They can only receive heat from their bellies, so you're gonna need a heating pad. Heating pad goes under the tank, NOT INSIDE. They make them special for reptiles. Another thing, I've seen way too many geckos die from becoming impacted due to living with loose substrate. It happens when they try to catch their food and end up eating the substrate as well. Tile works well, even just a paper towel in all honesty. Make sure they have a calcium source as well or their bones can get weak after a while. Do your research. They're awesome pets, but like all pets, you gotta learn how to properly care for them.

Damnthatsinteresting,ffvywli,t3_evi5gj,1580277676.0,"Sorry if it's a bit morbid, but I'm wondering what will happen when one dies since they don't share lungs, heart, stomach, spine, etc, but they do share the same body.

Tbh, I did pretty okay throughout the awkward stage by just keeping in braids until it was long enough to be cut and styled onto a bob, still only cheekbone length at that point, but it was an attempt. Side note, bangs REALLY helped it look like I was going for a bob(ish) instead of a weird grown out pixie."

We'd try to bend the rules by watching a movie together using a few of our 30 minutes combined, but dad caught on pretty fast. My personal best was when I would log on to the computer, turn on my favorite radio show, and log off so I could listen without using my time.

No learning curve and the only time they leaked was when I was actively urinating. Other than that, they haven't leaked any! Definitely going to invest in a reusable disc."

Finally I give up with part of my bowels in the toilet and I run out the side door, hoping none of my coworkers would know it was me that left such a horror.
