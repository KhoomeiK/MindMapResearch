bipolar,ff70hhx,t1_ff6zx2e,1579638661.0,"Yes, I'm doing everything, and I've tried everything. Trust me I studied psychopharmacology in college, sometimes meds just aren't enough. I'm just saying don't assume everyone is gonna get ""cured"" with some Lamictal."
bipolar,ff6ezsx,t3_ervdes,1579625753.0,"Honestly this post is tone deaf. I've been taking medication for 3 years and it doesn't get better. It's not as bad as it would be without meds but some of us are just resistent to treatment and meds dont do everything they should. So please, shut up."
