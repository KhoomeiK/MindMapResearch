I remember watching Mirko Cro Cop kick people half to death and thinking this is nothing I've ever seen before.

Hunting,fedyomu,t1_fedqqt2,1579022681.0,Not sure. Would be interesting data to see if there is a large problem.
Hunting,fedkd9o,t1_fedj4c2,1579013704.0,"Trust me, if I could not drag another full sized deer out of the woods again I would. I mostly hunt in NH and it is frustrating because I can legally take up to 6 deer (if I get all NH permits) with technically all of them can be anterless if taken in the proper timeframe of the WMU.

I am guessing that one of the reasons is that we just don't have as much land as the western states, with a lot of the area being pretty residential. Perhaps leaving as much of the deer in the field would be a predator attractor into these areas? Im speculating I don't actually know why the rules are as they are, but I will take your advice and reach out to a couple of different agencies regarding this topic."

Old habit from when I didn't throw with as many revs and how I would try to play the lane."
Bowling,fdz7hfy,t3_emxnoc,1578787448.0,How far left were you getting? If you play up the 1-5 on lanes that are really dry you're just gonna hook early and or burn out.
