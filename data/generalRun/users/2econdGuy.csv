GetMotivated,fdhhfec,t1_fdh9a8w,1578422709.0,"“I weigh 120 lbs” is a factual statement, it’s not an opinion. “This lady is my mother” that’s not an opinion. “I bought this car for $30k” not an opinion. There’s some things that are either factual or they aren’t, rather than opinions. Shades of colors and things like you mentioned YES! Those are, but the statement  “EVERYTHING you hear is an opinion and not a fact” is incorrect"
