I'm currently going through the same thing. Feeling alone really sucks. Like, truly alone, not even my parents want to help me with what I'm going through. I just feel the urge to connect. With anybody. It's what I do best, too, I love feeling needed.

...yet I just feel like I'm in my own little island while everyone else waves back from their massive cruise line.

Keep searching for that light inside you, though. I'm searching for mine as well.

PM me whenever, love, I could use the company."
depression_help,ff38lab,t3_erer8b,1579536254.0,"It's what a lot of us are dealing with. I'm suffering now, and I'm pretty sure I hit rock bottom. But by no means do I want to kill myself. I just want to be happy again.

Don't be afraid to seek help, though. Don't ever think that it's a bad idea to learn about yourself."

I ruined my relationship with my fiance by seeking attention elsewhere. I was sexting with other girls online.

I'm still not over what I did. The guilt alone almost fucking killed me...

I went to see a therapist (who I still see), I'm going to church, hitting the gym religiously, finding new hobbies, just to feel better about myself.

But what really helped me was to figure out the underlying problem of why I did it. I just hated myself. Don't get me wrong, I was happy. My relationship with her was near perfect, and we were so great together. But deep down, I just... I put myself down and beat myself up for every setback and failure I had for the longest time... and man, did I fail a lot.

The only thing I can say is to find it deep within yourself to forgive yourself. I was the problem that led to my own destruction. And as soon as I could forgive myself I could start working on myself. As for getting over everything, I think a part of that has already branded itself in my heart. I'm more than certain I'm gonna keep this mistake for the rest of my life. Now I just gotta own it.

Be patient, brother. Wars don't usually end overnight. It's one battle after another, so just win the ones that matter now. And yeah, getting over something might seem impossible now, and we might think that we can never let go. But for now, work on forgiving yourself. I felt a planet lift from my shoulders when I did.

That was my latest battle."

depression_help,feqa9wo,t3_eq20d0,1579339440.0,"Hey man,

I suffered for years trying to ""fill the void."" It ruined my relationship with my fiance. I went and got help the next day.

My therapist says it's a combo of depression and anxiety, you feel sad because that hole is there so your mind goes frantic and finds anything to fill it. In my case, it was attention from other girls... It completely destroyed me when I found the root of the cause, but it made me stronger because now I can mold myself into the person I want to be, and not be stuck in who I was.

Still depressed, however, the heartbreak is still fresh in my soul-- happened a few months ago. Still taking steps to get over it, as well as trying to reinvent myself to be a better human being in general. You know, without the need to ""fill the void."" Progress is at a snail's pace, but I'm glad I'm progressing.

There is nothing wrong with being concerned with mental health. This is most definitely the worst time in my life right now (sounds really weird saying that) but I have made the greatest investment in taking care of myself-- quite possibly the only time I have truly ever stopped caring about anyone else but myself, and it feels so damn good.

Everyone fights their own fight inside. Don't be afraid to ask for help every once in a while."
TampaSwingers,femsn7p,t3_eor32z,1579268465.0,Definitely interested...
gaming,femlyu9,t1_femlko2,1579261979.0,"Lol. I feel your pain. Was so excited for No Man's Sky.

I was so mad that I finished it anyway before the massive update fixed everything."
WinStupidPrizes,femkutd,t3_epqvym,1579260602.0,Sigh. I live 20 minutes from where she lives. This makes me ashamed of where I'm from.
gaming,femkjbb,t1_femkh7j,1579260181.0,Fallen Order was bad? I actually heard some good things about it.
gaming,femizeh,t1_femip6t,1579258010.0,"Damn it, you're right..."
gaming,femgm0q,t1_femgcms,1579254474.0,"Yes! Exactly my point. I love how more and more people are beginning to realize this. Although I wonder if the video game companies still suffer from delays... I mean, I'm sure they'll take some kind of hit, but depending on how well the game will be, they'll greatly make up for it."
gaming,femg04p,t3_epxiw3,1579253548.0,"I laughed way too hard at this.

But seriously, I love how we all went through a miraculous shift from absolutely trashing the sheer thought of game delays, to absolutely welcoming them."
overcoming,femb1is,t3_epuzn0,1579246683.0,"I've been there before. I still am. Wasted the last 10 years fucking up and hating myself-- and my life was really nice, too-- so much so that I cheated on my fiance just to fill all the blackness in my heart.

Now that I'm going through the aftermath of my life ripping apart to shreds I can relate how a  lot of people feel. You might want to drop out, but I'e been trying to get back to school for a year now. I only have 3 classes left for my bachelor's in psychology (how ironic for somebody with depression lol).

The part that hurts most is that I hurt the ones I loved badly. I scarred the love of my life. I lost the trust of so many. And all the shame and guilt just rushed over me like a flash flood. I can't get rid of this drowning feeling, either; it's been this way for months.

My parents don't give a shit. They don't know the first thing about somebody in need. I wander around the house in all hours of the night, everything tastes like shit, the music I loved makes me hurt and I spend the rest of my time staring at my ceiling in bed waiting for next week's goddamn therapist session.

I know how lonely you are. Really. I do. I'm lonely too. I can feel your pain from what you'e going through, but I really hope you hang in there. If there's anything that truly gives me hope it's other people's strength to climb out of their own darkness.

Truly sorry for the loooong comment. But I hope my story gives you insight to how we're all fighting. And I really do hope you win your fight.

Don't give up, love. We're all fighting."
StardewValley,fem0uft,t3_epq0ak,1579236133.0,Also going through a hell of a time. This game has done wonders to keep me sane though. Hope your rough days see an end as mine will too.
