All he did was ask. Sure birth control fails and i rly doubt that you cheated, but looking at it from his perspective it seems fishy. All he did was ask. u less there’s more ur not telling us( if he did it accusingly but u said urself he claimed he didn’t mean it that way etc) put yourself in his shoes. His girlfriend, while using 2 birth control methods gets pregnant. It’s reasonable to question things. and by dumping him in the spot you most certainly affirmed( to him) that u were fooling around
(again just to clarify i don’t think u were, just put yourself in his shoes"
