I believe this is the end of the chapter for you, it's exactly what I want though, my ex thought that she needed to explore her options as I was her first real boyfriend as well as taking her virginity. I thought that I could wait and she'd come back, but after 3 months I had healed and moved on from it, now I don't see us getting back together, I've grown and I'm with my new girlfriend who is great. 

Point is, there's multiple people on this earth you can be with, not just one, and you won't see that until you've healed, but it'll happen. Even if you don't want to move on, you will. I tried so hard to stay in love with my ex, but as time went by I cared less and less everyday, then I met a new girl who sparked my interest and boom, new girlfriend. 

It will suck, but it seems that it's the end of the line, I say break it off and do not be friends, that doesn't work. You need to wipe her from your life unfortunately, I learnt that the hard way too. 

Good luck bud, right now she's the only person you see, but in time she will become a memory, time does this, it requires no effort, it just happens."

selfimprovement,fft9qmc,t3_ev4ow5,1580213635.0,"You're very mature and it is impressive that you are questioning your psychological thought process, trying to get to the route cause. 

It is always possible to have a craving for love when you weren't brought up with enough of it through parents, it's also possible early teenage experiences shape the way you see love and relationships. 

You're still young, and frankly you do not need to worry about this FOMO you have with dating around with other people. The fact is you just need to explore every avenue of your life, if you like this person, why not try a relationship? If it fails, let it end nicely where there are no hard feelings, at the end of the day we are all humans and don't know what we really want in life. 

You may find out that getting into a relationship is truly what your character enjoys, and you fear that once you enter a relationship you can't leave. You can leave whenever you like, the tendency to need to please everyone is stopping you from getting into anything serious because you don't want to let anyone down, and you don't want to be let down yourself. 

Rejection is shit and hurts for everyone, but as humans we aren't bad for dishing out or receiving it. Some people aren't made for each other, and you will never find that out if you don't give it a proper shot.


Tl;Dr you are young, you still have a lot of love to experience in your life and you shouldn't worry that your single days are not still over, and you can always experiment. If something doesn't suit you, end it :) take more control over yourself, don't carry out actions because of what other people may think, because in the end, no one really cares, we are all flawed."

What I learnt when breaking up with someone:

1. Slash all communication with them, unfriend, unfollow on all socials and never ever check up on them, I did this from day 1, works a dream.

2. Do not stay in contact, it will be hard but no contact is the best for both of you. 

3. Feel the pain, go through the healing. Stoicism doesn't teach being numb, it teaches experiencing emotions correctly, so feel the pain but do not act out. 

4. Find a safe person who you can talk to about your feelings and build a strong support group. Family is amazing for this.
