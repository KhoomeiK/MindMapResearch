PornoMemes,ffcaf2u,t1_ffc7kic,1579795177.0,So because so shitty ass dudes we should censor what we say/post on Reddit of all places? Let me be clear that’s a fucked up thing to do to a woman. I personally am throwing yolopies but it’s always been with woman who’s okay with it beforehand.

PewdiepieSubmissions,fcrqni2,t1_fcrpg4e,1577905317.0,And I’m sorry for coming off as an arrogant asshole that’s not how I meant it.
PewdiepieSubmissions,fcrp2jc,t1_fcrnofh,1577904712.0,My first post was meant as a tongue-in-cheek joke by saying some half truths and if the meme is true that’s actually impressive. Wasn’t looking for validation it was supposed to be funny. After that however I was trying to actually have a conversation and explain myself a bit not go on a bragging spree. Which is ultimately how that was taken unfortunately.
PewdiepieSubmissions,fcrner4,t1_fcrm297,1577904092.0,Look I understand how the sounds of the Internet with merely words and zero context I’m a massive douche. Admittedly I am kind of a jerk I will 100% admit that. I have many sort comings and most of them are with my personality and attitude am aware of this but do try and work on them. Besides I was only talking about looks not personality.
PewdiepieSubmissions,fcrk2tb,t1_fcrhyv8,1577902845.0,I’m also smart which means that I’m not as attractive as I could be because usually people who are 10 are DUMB. People give me free things and get away with things that my friends don’t. Ive never really had a hard time getting what I want out of women but apparently my girlfriend says I have low standards because to her all I need is a pretty face and a Fat ass. The biggest difference between creepy and romantic/spontaneous is being attractive. I’m an 8 but no more. The universe has a way of balancing things out usually you can’t have everything unless somehow the universe allows you to roll natty 20s in more than one stat. But of course I could be dead wrong and everything is out of pity lol.
PewdiepieSubmissions,fcrhtt8,t1_fcrfw9y,1577902008.0,I’m hot (which I know is subjective) but I can’t do that. I’m also questioning if I’m gay because that is impressive...Thankfully I’m taken so I don’t have to worry as much about being attractive anymore. The single world is a scary place.

I’ll admit right now my rig is kind of sad because I have a 3900x overclocked to 4.2 all 12 Cores 32 GB of ram and I only have a 1080 in it. I haven’t bitten the bullet yet and bought a 2080ti but I might just wait for the 3080ti at this point. Cries in pc enthusiast problems"

dankmemes,fchhcu3,t1_fch7di0,1577650485.0,"As someone who when I finish my new rig I’ll have spent roughly $3,500 on my bleeding edge machine not including my monitors. The only reason I give my friend and other people shit is they act as if the consoles are superior because the “value” option not looking in the perspective of 5-10 years on the same machine. I’m upgrading from a 10 year old rig yes I upgraded to an ssd and GPUs along the way but it can still play 1440p at 60+ frames on any game I throw at it. So there’s definitely a difference between budget PC and bleeding edge. I’ve helped build many of my friends rigs for $650-$800+ and those will last them at least 2 console gens so they’re saving money. I don’t care what people choose I just don’t want misinformation out there about PC gamers."
