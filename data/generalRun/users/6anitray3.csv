I always recommend going extreme and see what happens: 

Hot dogs

Cheese cubes

Chicken

Meat flavor baby food

Cheese whiz 

Peanut butter on a spoon

Liver

Deli meat (like turkey breast for sandwiches)

If dog doesn't care, try their favorite toy. Tug, ball, etc.

puppy101,fgedrfg,t3_exywzk,1580697224.0,"I wonder if it's a smell thing. Like some primal, smells like fire, run, kinda instinct.  When it's not on, can she be near it?  Or is it an arch enemy regardless?  How far away do you have to be to barely hear the ding? Outside? Down the hall?  

I'd see if you could stage it where it keeps dinging over and over just far enough from her that there's little to no reaction. 

Basically run it until it doesn't mean anything.  And then slowly get closer to not flood her, but enough that it's lost its meaning. 

If it's a smell thing, try turning on your vent Hood, plus a fan and some open windows, and see what happens? Maybe if it doesn't smell like you're dying, she won't try to save you from the toaster oven? 

I will just say, I find it hilarious how unpredictable it can be how and what dogs react to. My dog freaked out and barked at a bag of very threatening looking trash."

Dogtraining,fgdrdqb,t3_ext41p,1580685865.0,"To chain behaviors, start with mini chunks. I'll give one example and then you'll see how it's done.  I don't have any good resources to give you outside my own knowledge. 


Say you want to train the dog to get you a Coke from the fridge and bring it to you on the couch. 


You have to break down each and every action. First dog needs to learn to hold an object. Then bring you the held object.  For some, this is natural and easy, others, not so much. 


Dog needs to pick up an object from across the room and bring it to you. That's part one. Just retrieve the object, bring it to you.  


Part two is opening and closing the fridge door. Can be completed with a pull rope on the door handle depending on model of fridge.  So teach the dog to pull the rope, opening the door.  Then teach Target with paw, to close the door.  Do them repeatedly back to back. Open, close, open, close. 


Now phase three (chaining): have fridge door open already, place the coke/beer/object to retrieve and give the cue to retrieve it and close the door. Then bring it to you (just a couple feet away). Repeat.  Pick up object, close door.  If dog drops the object in closing the door, drop the bring to you part. Just focus on pick up, close door. Repeat.  Then pick up, close door, bring.  


Then chain together the beginning again.  Go to fridge, pull open. Repeat. 
Then door open, pick up. Repeat.  Then back to the end.  Door open already, cue pick up, close, bring. Then close the door half way. See if the dog will pull it open a bit. 


Then back another step.  Door closed, pull open, pick up, bring. Once it's reliable, start at the beginning. Cue the whole thing. See what happens. Some dogs just get it, and will chain together the next behavior.  Some need a bit more of a push (cue) to get to the next part.  Repeat the weak transitions always putting the next behavior in line behind it. 

Then if you've been saying the cue for each piece, start to say just the first one.  See what happens. Phase out each cue.  

Next thing you know your dog is doing multiple behaviors in a row to make one long 'trick'."

Get treats ready along with a room/place you can train in that's relatively calm. Place both hands behind your back and put the treats up out of reach. Use a clicker to better define the exact moment of success. 

With both hands behind your back, focus on your tone and say the cue.  Click quickly and reward. If you don't get success quickly, take a few steps away. This re-sets the dog for another chance.  Only give a few seconds for the dog to correctly respond.  

Really focus on the same tone and pace each time. Keep your hands behind your back until you click and reward. Doing this allows the dog to focus on your face, no hands to look at and get confused with.

If recommend going forward that you only do one at a time. Either hand signal with no voice, or voice and NO visible hands."

If he's buying from fear or frustration, then you need to examine the situation and manage it. Minimize the situation and work positive reinforcement to it and the biting should subside. So for example if he bites during nail trims, do less. Practice just touching paws, then give treats and walk away. Baby steps. I'm working to get my pup used to the Dremel. I can do one-two nails at a time now until I know he gets squirrelly. So I keep it short and positive and he doesn't fuss."

Are you in the states? If so, everything I'm about to say applies to you. 


US has NO regulations on dog training. There is no state license, no federal guidelines, nothing.  There are what I'd consider 3 major Options that are fairly well recognized. 

1. APDT. Within this there are two tests. One is just a written test and requires no true demonstration of skill. I call it book smart. You know the theories, you know how it works, but maybe you've never done it in person. The other is a video of skill demonstration. About 10% of APDT is this one because of the additional effort, but I consider this a legit trainer. It requires time, effort and follow through. 


2. Community/adult/specialty college. This includes college programs such as ABC trainer program and similar. These are for profit colleges and generally are not interested in a continues alumni education program or ongoing seminars. It's a one and done 'good enough' certification. I can't speak to the quality, it may vary by location. 


3. Karen Pryor Academy. This is the option I went with after a lot of research. They have different levels. I went with a 6 month hands on + online intensive program. You have to prove you can train. They teach you, and then you do it. It's hard, it makes you question yourself, everything you know, and you come out the other side 20× stronger for it. It wasn't easy, but it's the only certification I trust. It's legit, not just a textbook. And the mentor that taught me is still someone is go to for training advice.
