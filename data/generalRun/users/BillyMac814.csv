sexover30,ffgdn6c,t1_ffenb1d,1579903905.0,"Yea exactly. That makes all the difference in the world. Try to jam it right in and it’s going to hurt. You gotta pretty much wait for it to be welcomed in. I ruined anal for my girlfriend by doing, she wanted no part of it for 12 or so years. Then we talked about maybe trying it again and I told her everything I did wrong and told her there’s no pressure or anything. The first night it just wasn’t going in at all so I said tonight is not the night rather than to get frustrated and us and be less in the mood. The next time though it went great and she really liked it. 

What seems to work for us is I have to push pretty hard to get it in, just the tip basically and then just wait until things open up and let it in the rest of the way. It’s quite amazing how it loosens up as needed. It’ll hurt if you just get it in and go hog wild. 

There’s some almost disturbing videos floating around of people taking some giant toys up there, if they can do that I’d say anyone could take a reasonable sized dick."
BuyItForLife,fdqe76c,t1_fdq4xsg,1578664339.0,Yea that’s how mine is. I think that is one of the things that makes me prefer it over some other styles.
BuyItForLife,fdqdzvf,t1_fdpui4y,1578664179.0,"That’s true if you’re trying to heat an entire room but that really only works if it’s really small, otherwise they are too small to bring a whole room up to temp to get to the point the thermostat shuts them down or it’s set so low it’s barely on. I’m typically using them in short spurts and just trying to basically warm myself or a small area near me, like while I’m eating or in the bathroom or something like that."
BuyItForLife,fdpjxg2,t1_fdpimsf,1578630661.0,"Yea that’s been my experience. I’ve went through a lot of space heaters and newer ones don’t last very long even with fairly light use. I got to the point I’d pick one up any time I’d see one for sale at a goodwill or a flea market.

I think the efficiency is probably higher than 90%, even the electricity used to turn the fan creates heat, where else could the electricity go if not turned into heat?
Also I’d say that even if it’s basically equal in efficiency as the modern one I have in my bathroom that the Pelonis allows me to use less electricity. The one in my bathroom has 2 settings, a low and a high and the fan runs the same no matter what, low really isn’t very effective so when I use it it’s running on high which is probably close to 1500 watts. When I use the Pelonis it’s almost always turned way down and since the fan slows down as well a very low setting is fine as long as it’s close to me. I can’t do that with the other one because the fan spins too fast and just circulates all the cold air too much."
BuyItForLife,fdphu7x,t1_fdpgua2,1578629025.0,"I never tried to tip mine over to see if it shuts off, I just know it doesn’t have the button on the bottom like the new cheap ones do. I keep mine clean too. I’m really surprised at all the grief you’ve gotten for this heater. They are awesome, and they are still made so I’m sure at some point along the way they’ve added any safety features required. All the people claiming new ones are more efficient are talking out of their ass as there’s really no such thing with these kind of heaters. I just use space heaters as a supplement, like heating the bathroom so I’m not cold in there and don’t have to heat the whole house up as much or if I’m sitting at my desk I can keep it on really low and just heat up my legs so I don’t have to run my furnace as much, it’s always 100% supervised so even if mine doesn’t have tip over protection I’m not concerned at all but I’ll have to try it just out of curiosity."
BuyItForLife,fdozjci,t1_fdoc5ol,1578616457.0,"These aren’t 25 dollar heaters. I’ve had lots of heaters both new and old and the only ones I’ve had fail are the new ones and one got so hot and melted the plastic enclosure. The new ones are safer in the event of a knockover, that’s really it and they are heavy and bottom heavy so unless you’re letting your kids or dogs run around it or maybe you drink yourself to a blackout every night it really shouldn’t be a problem. I’ll stick with my Pelonis, I personally feel that is less of a risk than a new 25 dollar space heater for me."
BuyItForLife,fdoyrra,t1_fdo4qyv,1578615958.0,"“More efficient”. That doesn’t exist which these types of heaters. I’d like to see your data proving new heaters safer too. They might have a knock over safety switch but that’s about it. They are typically mass produced in some far off land with shoddy connections and components. Wait till the fan quits and the thing just gets hot as fuck and melts itself down. I’ll take my chances with one of these. I’m not at all concerned with it being knocked over as there are no pets or kids running around mine. 

Also as for your “more efficient” bullshit which doesn’t exist, the new “safe” ones typically just crank out at a few preset wattages and they all pretty much max out at 1500. These disk furnaces however have a potentiometer on them that allows an almost infinite adjustment, so while a more efficient heater does not exist most of the time if I’m sitting at my desk I have mine turned way down to where it’s only drawing a few hundred watts which works perfect for me, I can’t do that with some of these newer ones so they just crank out 800 watts or something close to that on low so while it isn’t more efficient it does let me use less electricity."
BuyItForLife,fdoxs8r,t1_fdo20el,1578615315.0,"As someone who owns one of these old heaters and a few new ones with the auto shut off I can tell you I feel safer with this old one. It’s heavy and clearly well made. I’ve had newer ones crap out where the fan quits and it gets crazy hot and melts stuff. If you have kids or pets or something that makes a knock over likely then sure go with one with the safety on it but I’m more concerned with shoddy connections and components than a knock over, these are heavy metal heaters that are bottom heavy and I only use it on the floor, I really can’t think of a way it could get knocked over."
BuyItForLife,fdox3mt,t3_emd2l5,1578614864.0,"I found the same one at a flea market a couple years ago. As soon as I saw it I knew it was a good heater. I love it, I’m sitting in front of it as we speak. I love that it’s pretty much infinitely adjustable so you can have it super low. I’d love to find another. They still make them but according to some of the reviews people say they aren’t as good as they used to be and they are a bit expensive so I doubt I’ll take the gamble until I have to."
ZeroWaste,fdowcn0,t1_fdkqfhv,1578614371.0,That was my first thought. I used to never think twice about grabbing stuff like this from the side of the road. Then one day we thought we found a bed bug at home after our daughters got lice from someone they had over. It ended up not being a bug at all but in the process of finding that out I did way too much research on bedbugs and people’s battles with them that It scared the shit out of me. I’m sure it would be easy to spot something infested but it would be quite hard to spot one where maybe they caught it right away and tossed out their bed but the few bugs there laid some eggs or something.
unpopularopinion,fcvmq1g,t1_fcvkc8f,1578005423.0,"Yes that’s exactly it. It’s pretty sad really, they are always the first one to point fingers and call people racist or close minded or whatever and they almost always follow it up with a comment that’s even more hateful than what they are replying to. Most of the stuff they do reply to was never even intended to be a hateful comment in the first place."
unpopularopinion,fcuxx6d,t1_fcuxo1f,1577990732.0,"Ok, that makes more sense. I’m pretty much the same way. I feel like a lot of these people are under the impression it’s gun nuts like us that are doing it and I don’t think that is the case at all."
pics,fcux8fq,t1_fcul5pu,1577990353.0,That’s not the reason...
unpopularopinion,fcuwxo7,t1_fcuayxd,1577990185.0,"Every time you see someone doing it?  Where the fuck are you going that you’re seeing this at all? I live in a very pro 2a area and nearly everyone I know is a gun owner/carrier and I’ve never seen that before and if I did I certainly wouldn’t be around to see it again the next year. I’ve seen it on TV or movies but that’s it. I’m certainly not saying it doesn’t happen or anything, I know it does, I just don’t think it’s the people half of these other commenters are accusing of being the ones who do that shit."
unpopularopinion,fcuwhnb,t1_fcura7r,1577989942.0,That’s just you being prejudiced against people that are different from you. It’s only acceptable when that group is white hick Americans apparently. All the people you’d call hick “musicians” I know would never fire their gun in the air like that. The people that do do that shit are generally people living in cities and that is why it never fails that someone gets hit and those “muricans” you speak of rarely live in the city.
Whatcouldgowrong,fcl9uoe,t1_fck9wrj,1577742948.0,"Yea I know the feeling. I’ve cut back significantly this past 6 months or so, when I start seeing the same thing posted a bunch of times or when I find myself caring about upvotes i know it’s time to lay off a while."
Whatcouldgowrong,fcjdc6q,t1_fcjd0yu,1577683705.0,"Yea it’s certainly not impossible, especially with things like Turo now where you can rent all kinds of older and unique cars."
Whatcouldgowrong,fcjd2e1,t3_eh9w7d,1577683471.0,What is with rappers and climbing all over cars?
Whatcouldgowrong,fcjcz8o,t1_fciqlln,1577683396.0,Seems unlikely with spinner wheels but maybe they rented the wheels too since that’s a thing.
Whatcouldgowrong,fcjclsp,t1_fcht78v,1577683081.0,Maybe that is a sign you’re spending too much time on reddit. It’s my first time seeing it.
Whatcouldgowrong,fcjcgrf,t1_fcitbqf,1577682962.0,"Their color is kind of irrelevant. If these were white guys acting the same way it wouldn’t change the way I think of them in the slightest. You can’t always judge a book by the cover but a lot of times you can. I’m sure post Malone, Lil peep and other white rappers have had the same things said about them by people who didn’t know who they were. I find it a bit odd that it really seems like the people who call out things like this and call people racists are usually the ones with the racist thoughts going through your heads first. 
I’d be on your side in questioning that statement if the guy was dressed like a professional and sitting in a car like a normal human and there was no other reason visible that would suggest this man couldn’t afford the car."
Whatcouldgowrong,fcjax10,t1_fchnfe1,1577681699.0,Maybe some hooptie lot. It has spinner wheels on it so I doubt it was a BMW dealer or anything like that.
Wellthatsucks,fcjanjq,t3_ehd3hh,1577681491.0,"What was his plans for after if it didn’t break?  There’s no way that glass would even fit in my cup holders, that’s even worse than McDonald’s large cups."
explainlikeimfive,fcckt0v,t1_fcbtdck,1577599547.0,I can’t remember the channel I saw it on and as awesome as it sounds it was rather underwhelming really.
Whatcouldgowrong,fcbsf7n,t3_egv9j9,1577590452.0,There was a zero percent chance that ball was going in the hoop anyway so this was all for nothing which makes it even worse.
explainlikeimfive,fcbo7mw,t1_fcbmvcl,1577589118.0,"Thanks!  I assumed the logistics of just getting there would be an issue but I wasn’t sure if the actual act of throwing something in a volcano would be a bad thing. I’ve seen videos where people toss propane tanks in and it just kind of swallows it up with a slight poof of fire. 

If it didn’t process everything what would happen with all the unprocessed stuff that would build up?"
Frugal,fcbj9zg,t1_fc8tmqs,1577587522.0,"How do you have a 20 yr old credit card if you divorced your husband 15 yrs ago and as a divorcee you couldn’t even get a secured card without a co signer? 
Did you have bad credit during the divorce or no credit?  I just went through a divorce as well and I’m pretty well fucked, it’s hard to even comprehend where to start and if there’s even any hope."
explainlikeimfive,fcbh7np,t1_fcau20f,1577586827.0,What’s the cliff notes on why it wouldn’t work?  Is it the logistics of getting it there or something else?
relationships,fc925mp,t1_fc866ca,1577545814.0,"Yea exactly. I personally wouldn’t be with someone who makes it a priority to travel with those she fucked. I in turn would not go do something like that either out of respect to who I’m with. I’m not the controlling type and would not be telling anyone not to do that if that’s what they want to do, I’m just old enough to know who I don’t work with and avoid getting into relationships with those people. 

That’s what OP should have done, but instead he’s stuffed his own feelings down for 2 years now and now there’s almost no winning this one, either he’ll resent her or she’ll resent him depending on if she goes or not."
dogs,fc6384b,t1_fc62ab8,1577471257.0,"Yea exactly. And let’s be realistic, if that were the case there’s be way more healthy dogs in shelters being euthanized because most people couldn’t afford that or wouldn’t spend that on a dog. Look at how many people can’t even spend that on their own health, especially when dental is concerned.

I love my dog and would cry like a baby if I had to put him down but it would be the responsible decision for me and my family rather than going into a big debt where it’s unlikely he will last as long as the loan term. 

If someone has the expendable income to do so I can understand the temptation and would probably do it in that case but certainly not going into debt over it."
dogs,fc5zv6c,t1_fc5ldjp,1577469234.0,"I agree. I’m a bit shocked at some of these expenses I’m reading to be honest. I pay for his food, treats and the flea and tick stuff and the occasional vet trip, I give him a bath and cut his nails myself. He comes to work with me every day and has a good life, he has a few toys he plays with that he’s had for years and he got a new one for Christmas. If he needs a 10k dollar surgery though I just don’t have it and I’d have to have a lot more than that to be able to justify spending that much. I kind of agree with OP here, it’s ridiculous to even suggest I should have just let him sit at the shelter if I can’t afford a major surgery like that though I’ve never really heard anyone being that critical of someone. I think it’s the main things like food and vet stuff people are generally talking about. Expecting people to spend thousands and thousands to maybe get a few more years just seems a bit unrealistic to me."
dogs,fc5yn9r,t1_fc5kv1a,1577468575.0,"I agree that 20 a month is very unrealistic however paying a groomer to cut nails and give them a bath isn’t a requirement. I groom my dog myself as I’m sure many do. He hates getting his nails cut either way and I’d just rather do it so I can basically see it. He gets so scared in the groomers or vets he shakes. I have a system down now where it’s really not a big deal, he fights the first few nails and then realizes he can’t move and just calms down and lays there."
BuyItForLife,fbibqpc,t3_e8wva4,1576896425.0,"In my experience spending 150 bucks on a pair of new boots is not worth it unless it’s some type of crazy good sale or used or something. That’s right in the price range where you can get a sorta decent boot but with massive corners cut to keep it in that price range, they might use a manmade lining or some cheap foam in the footbed rather than cork or plastic welts or just cemented soles or any of the other many coats cutting measures. 

If you want a good pair of boots for a very reasonable price and you’re opposed to buying lightly used ones you can usually get a pair of Allen Edmonds Higgins Mill boots in factory seconds on sale for around 200 bucks which is a pretty decent deal. You get Horween leather, leather linings, leather Goodyear welt, Dainite soles and heels and cork fillers. That’s a lot of boot for the money. I’m sure you can find similar deals with other manufacturers as well, I’d personally much rather have a factory seconds or a used boot over a lesser quality boot."
