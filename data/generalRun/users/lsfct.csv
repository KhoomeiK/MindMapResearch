NavyBlazer,fevb4hl,t3_eqlgvb,1579395309.0,"I only wear loafers now - so much more comfortable than laced shoes.  My favourite ones have been my Lobb Lopez (these things are built like tanks and last forever), and, to a lesser extent, my 1953s (not Penny loafers, but they still get the job done.  The quality is terrible, though)."

FinancialCareers,fckhf5z,t3_ehbrh8,1577725395.0,"First - go back to school.  Any undergrad internship will want candidates who are in school and learning.  
  
Second - I actually think that from an undergrad internship perspective, small PE/HFs are somewhat easier than IBD.  This is because most small funds don't have an institutionalized hiring practice, unlike bulge bracket banks.  They can basically hire whomever they please.  You should know the industry (know the big players, know terminology, know types of transactions, etc.) as well as some technical stuff (basic finance knowledge is fine, some modeling, but, tbh, I wouldn't expect much from an undergrad intern if I was interviewing).  
  
Lastly, I would network.  The best way in is through networking.  This doesn't mean you need family connections (although that helps), but you should tap into your alumni network, and cold email as a last resort.  
  
Happy to answer any other Qs."

todayilearned,fci2ojl,t3_ehady7,1577657026.0,"This happened at an apartment building in Manhattan as well.  Old building was bought to be demolished and all the residents were bought out.  One recluse Ph.D remained and refused to leave.  The developers even started demolishing the building around him.  Finally, they moved him into a $2 million apartment (giving him access for life, but not ownership), and paid him $17 million to leave."
FinancialCareers,fbziac2,t3_eeqj83,1577247619.0,"Personally, I like to nitpick at small details when I review resumes.  The first thing that stands out to me are your dates.  Make sure everything is uniform.  You have at least three different dates (“2022E” and “Winter 2019” and “2019”).  Make them all the same.  That goes for everything else on your resume: if you use an Oxford comma, use it everywhere (I noticed you use it on some lines and don’t use it on others).  If you spell out “and” instead of using “&”, use it everywhere.  Stuff like that.  There’s also a random semi-colon after languages."
