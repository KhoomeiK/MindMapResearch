The atmosphere, the story
One frame of it can tell you what heppend to this ruined world, what the characters have seen in their lives, what they have done to survive, how it has affected them mentally, all of that, in the box alone by the way
So yeah absolutely yes"
ShouldIbuythisgame,femgwjh,t1_femg12m,1579254911.0,"For portal 2, you have at least one parent, play with him/ her
I Played some Wii games on my crappy laptop, and they worked well enough, I think it'll work well, as for the gamecube controllers, they're a pain to set up and buy and waiting for shipping, but it's gonna be worth it imo"
ShouldIbuythisgame,femfnh7,t3_ephwgz,1579253016.0,"Portal 2 is fun to play with other people, but I think it's like 2 player only, I don't know exactly, and it's not that expensive, it's also good single player, but that doesn't matter
I would emulate smash brothers for wii U and get 3 gamecube controllers for PC, but that's a long process"

cats,fe4n67a,t1_fe4lzsd,1578861027.0,"Is her being pregnant affecting this thing that's happening
I'm worried that it's vomit attempt or something

She's like 4-5 years old now"
cats,fe4juon,t3_ensndq,1578860100.0,"Long story short, I just got back from the bathroom, and I saw her in this state, it's 11P.M and there are no open vets in my area, so I took a video and wanted to ask you guys for what you think is wrong with her, this happens everytime she wakes up."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fdn3ttq,t3_em86sp,1578576482.0,"In my opinion, death stranding, but there are some flaws to it ofcourse, every game has some
The game looks awesome ofcourse and the walking is very very realistic,  the combat is not that good, the story is very kojima, the acting is really good, the soundtrack... OOOOOOHHHH the soundtrack is one of the highlights of the game, the details are definitely there and they are awesome.
I played a bit of days gone and I can't tell you anything about it"

cats,fdjmrt9,t3_elkvnr,1578478439.0,"This for some reason reminds me of when I saw a cat on the ground possibly hit by a car, took her to the vet, I barely was able to pick her up because of how many broken bones she has, anyways went to the vet and he took care of her, can't say what happened to her because I didn't see her after that
But it's a hard feeling when you see such a fluffy boi for the last time"
cats,fdg5r72,t3_ekym3c,1578381123.0,"Yup, just wait until they sleep on the keyboard or on your sheets and you don't want to wake them up but it's cold and so you wake him up slowly so he won't get mad and bite you
Just me? Ok"

bloodborne,fatgiok,t3_eabqjr,1576338015.0,"Alright let's be clear, rom is hard because it's unfair, enemies are too much and deal too much damage, one slip up is more than enough, even though the map is endless, you'll get cornered by the sheer amount of spiders that WILL one shot you
While ebritas's attacks are high in damage, but that is expected from a boss where you are close to the end of it, your deaths are completely on you in that fight as well"
