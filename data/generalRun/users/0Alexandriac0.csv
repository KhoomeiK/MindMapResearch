occult,ff8mp2d,t1_ff8kx59,1579686196.0,That's the exact opposite of the point of anthropology. An anthro professor who took that approach would be a pretty shitty one

occult,fdgku13,t3_el8mhs,1578400695.0,"Maybe look for articles from the World Futures journal. I can't remember for sure but I swear I've passed over a couple of articles linking witchcraft (or was it just ""spirituality""?) with some kind of science; there's a chance that they might have what you're looking for. And I definitely found a bunch (from a different journal) linking social work with magick! But I can't remember titles or authors :( At the very least, hopefully it could point you in the right direction :) wish I could help more.

Edit: Oh! Check tandfonline.com. They have mental health/culture/religion/etc. subcategories and that's where I found a whole host of interesting stuff.
A journal example found there is the journal of Mental Health, Religion and Culture. Hope this helps (though your subjects of inquiry are so niche..!)"

Ive been happily medicated for almost 2 years now, no signs of depression, very rare anxiety, and now the past couple weeks I've been feeling the exact same flavour of depression, dread and brokenheartedness I used to feel around 2012 and prior. When i say flavour, its like, im still stuck in the same circumstances that facilitated my depression at that point in my life, even though theyve long passed. I literally feel deep inside what I felt like that year.

Also been having weird dreams where I'm just hanging around places I used to spend time, waiting for my boyfriend, but he doesnt come, and im alone and wondering where to go, and its all so soft and so very fucking sad and i just want to cry and break these days. 

I hate this and i hope it passes but i dunno. 2020 gonna be a weird one for sure."

mentalhealth,fcdq43d,t3_egygos,1577612447.0,"Well, unfortunately it took a suicide attempt to get there. I OD'd on benzos and was sent to a psych ward for two weeks. They put me on meds - prozac and risperidone at first (later quit risperidone because side effects and switched to lamictal). Been on meds for a year and a half. It changed my life. Really truly completely. I only saw a therapist a few times in the beginning (government, so free) and my meds are also government provided (so free), which helps a lot. I don't know if you have such a system in your country (I'm in South Africa) but if you do, take advantage of it!

Until then, like you mentioned, keeping busy is great. Even with the most mundane things, like washing the dishes or changing up your decore. 

You said you don't have a job yet so I'm guessing you're cooped up at home? This is dangerous and was a big contributor to my suicide attempt. PLEASE PLEASE get out of the house and make effort to see friends and family (if you have good relationships with them, of course). I seriously neglected that for a long time, thinking I deserve to be alone and suffer in silence, but man that social interaction is absurdly important, and you don't realise it until later. I know its hard as fuck but please do your utmost to reach out to loved ones. Anyone.

Journalling helps a lot, too. Be completely honest with yourself, get everything out on paper. Especially when you start feeling particularly bad or anxious. Its like, getting your mind out of your mind, if that makes sense. You kinda remove yourself from the awful thoughts and feelings. And when you read over them again, it hurts, yes, but it also brings clarity over time. 

Above all, remember to be gentle on yourself, and that this, too, shall pass.

Edit: sorry, just saw you're Ubering, so at least you're not home 24/7 :)"
mentalhealth,fcdn36c,t3_eh3le2,1577611547.0,"Agreed with above ^ its a good start, a nice fire to kick you into gear. But its unsustainable, so at some point you gotta make sure its genuinely because you wanna get better for yourself alone. Resentment isn't a good thing to experience long-term. However, I reckon that as you get better, you'll naturally start caring less about them and have more faith in yourself in any case :)"

NFR was pretty and intimate, but not a fan of the random rewind/zoom into her glasses at the end (though I'm biased because I generally hate that effect). Bartender deserved better, but the cut-shots of different scenes in the middle was lovely. I adored HIAB. And I love the little animations. 
Also, at first I thought the marriage/couple reflections in her sunnies in NFR were awfully kitsch, but then I remembered Norman Rockwell is all about that stylised everyday-ness, so it makes sense :)"
