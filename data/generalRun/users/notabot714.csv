depression,feob5rz,t3_eq6qry,1579297670.0,Put an alarm on your phone an hour before to see if it helps. I’m the same way I forget everything and think it stems from me just trying to forget everything in life.
depression,feoav9w,t1_feo9w6l,1579297531.0,Hey man one thing you have to remember is everyone lives life at their own pace.  I mean people are always going to judge you but just do you as hard as it is with anxiety. I’m the same way with certain situations

apexlegends,fel067w,t1_fel00y8,1579211239.0,I mean it isn’t helping anyone that you are posting here with not enough details about what’s broken. You just assume ranked is broken? Go try it out and report it to the devs stop complaining.

legaladvice,fcwabur,t1_fcw9z7u,1578020791.0,As sad as it is most older people are racist and it’s hard to change their perspective or refuse to see that they are racist.
legaladvice,fcw9jro,t1_fcw982j,1578020269.0,Some of it is his own opinion I’m guessing it’s an older dude? Whenever I go to work there’s always those guys or girls who small talk over nothing and sometimes can be racist just like you’ve seen. Older generations tend to be a little less tolerant of others.  If you don’t like it just find a new place.

ARK,fbzpao3,t3_efd1bb,1577254966.0,Tame a rex and then tame more eventually you will have a rex army that lays eggs. Make plants and make narcotics. Make kibble and get your crossbow ready and a giga trap. Go out on an argy and trap the giga in a trap and you are officially alpha
