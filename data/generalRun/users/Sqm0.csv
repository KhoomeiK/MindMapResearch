Cuphead,feaugbi,t1_fe88c5q,1578952260.0,King Dice took me about an hour. That stupid clown took me hours and hours and hours. IMO the hardest fight in the game.
Cuphead,feau8u0,t1_fe8cxaq,1578952204.0,"I don’t understand that at all. I didn’t find that fight very hard. It took me about an hour, so I suppose it’s one of the harder fights in the game."
Cuphead,featrft,t1_fe8getf,1578952151.0,I beat King Dice relatively easily. It took me about an hour.

I won’t copy and paste. I never have.

I care about the safety of everyone on this subreddit, and I do my best to write at least 1-2 comments per day."
SuicideWatch,fe5zzj1,t1_fe5zkxa,1578878715.0,"What a stupid fucking rule. You do realize some people go through these subreddits hoping for an excuse to escape temporarily? I’ve been that person, I’ve been scrolling through social media, just waiting for some post or message to save my life.

Whatever, I’ll just inefficiently write the same message 30 times under every post, just trying to make someone feel better."
SuicideWatch,fe5zdol,t1_fe5yyzu,1578878328.0,I know sometimes the world seems like a toxic place. There are good people in this world. Ones that won’t abandon you.

SuicideWatch,fe5z1y3,t1_fe5snzh,1578878124.0,"We’ve all experienced enough suffrage to be granted that positivity. I may not love you like I love my family, but I love you meaning I’d help you, talk to you, and back you up."
SuicideWatch,fe5yw8d,t1_fe5x8v4,1578878023.0,"Though I don’t know you, I do know that you have a large community of people in this community ready and willing to back you up at any time."
SuicideWatch,fe5yoo7,t1_fe5ybsw,1578877891.0,"I’ve been through three different outpatient programs and, unfortunately, one inpatient. I know depression and anxiety as well as any of you. My post is only to remind people that there are some good things available to them in order to escape. A pint of ice cream and an episode of your favorite show may be a temporary solution, but it’s certainly better than the alternative. I’m sorry if I came off as ignorant in my post."
