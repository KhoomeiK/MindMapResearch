What he doesn't realise is that he's differentiating between ladies and thots by term but accuses both of the same behaviour. Meaning he most likely believes that all women do what he claims they do.

niceguys,fdotrf4,t3_emhqbl,1578612684.0,"Interesting he mentions OkCupid, because the first time I ever read about the term Niceguy was in an online article called ""The nice guys of okcupid"", about a group by that name on the site (never used okcupid so I don't know how it works), thus unintentionally coined the term for all of them."

And that happened to be you unfortunately. It's a common habit among very insecure young men. Someone hurt him and he can't hurt them back because they don't care? He takes his anger to the next vulnerable person he can find and makes them answer for it. That's when they start addressing you as a collective, like ""you women"" or ""yall females""."

Him trying to be funny and gentlemanly about it was as wrong as you can do. I think not many people can imagine what waiting tables or similar jobs in the service industry are like sometimes.
