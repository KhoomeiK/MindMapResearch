How much starter are you maintaining? If you're tossing that much then you're keeping too much on hand. 

To answer your question though, you can use the discard whenever it smells appetizing. Before then it probably won't taste good."

lockpicking,fghz7zt,t3_eyfjbt,1580798706.0,I've done this before. Smacked it open with a hammer and managed to get it the core apart but fucked up half the springs in the process. Now I'm just trying to justify spending $2 on 100 springs + $8 shipping to be able to fix it...
Sourdough,fghukb9,t3_eyk6mc,1580794296.0,When this sort of thing happens to me I just start doing more folds more frequently up front before the fermentation really takes off.
Sourdough,fghtr3q,t1_fghqm2b,1580793617.0,"In the first few days after mixing a starter, the pH is still relatively high. This allows a number of types of bacteria to flourish, including a genus called Leuconostoc. The Leuconostoc bacteria put out carbon dioxide as a byproduct of metabolism, just like yeast does. As a result, your starter will bubble up just as if you had tossed a bunch of yeast in it. After about 24-48 hours the  pH of the starter will drop, and it will quickly become too acidic for these bacteria to thrive. This makes it seem like the starter has ""died off"", and many people will give up on their starters at this point unfortunately. 

After a while, however, the pH will become more stabilized at a level which is conducive to the strains of yeast we like in sourdough. The yeasts we want live on the flour that we feed with, so they will eventually take hold in the starter with regular feedings. The amount of time this takes seems to vary widely though, with the starter reaching maturity anywhere from 7 to 30 days from starting, or sometimes even longer, depending on the flour, temperature, and water used. 

I'm no microbiologist, but that's my understanding of the process based off of a lot of reading. Based off of my experience, patience and consistency are the biggest things needed to get a new starter going. Hope that helps!"

Breadit,fggtdhu,t3_eyddkf,1580769124.0,"Equal parts water and flour by volume will end up with a nearly 200% hydration starter. You probably want closer to 100% hydration, so I would cut the water in half. Better yet, start weighing the flour and water and use an equal weight of each."

Sourdough,fg86r5n,t3_exh1cq,1580611007.0,"Is it possible it's getting overproofed? If not, it may be an issue with shaping. 

Ears are largely the result of good shaping and proper proofing. You're also more likely to get an ear if you score more of a flap of dough rather than a slit. Either way, you don't need to score super deep. It helps to be decisive in your scoring. Don't slow down and give the dough a chance to pull. Sort of like slicing wrapping paper with scissors, if that makes sense."
Breadit,fg8692c,t3_exh8ii,1580610627.0,Should work pretty well. I'd give it a try!

Sourdough,fg6qr6q,t1_fg6iwcn,1580574724.0,"Depends on your % of starter and the ambient temperature, but generally that sounds about right, so you're probably good. Definitely something to keep in mind though. 

Beyond that, it could be an issue with gluten development (more/better folds needed) or you might need to cut back on your hydration a tad. 

Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words though, so if you continue to have problems try posting your final results here and see if anyone can give you any suggestions. Tag me if you want and I'd be happy to give my 2 cents."

Sourdough,fg266bt,t3_ewgbi0,1580439191.0,"It doesn't really matter too much, in fact a thicker starter may not fall much, or some might not at all. 

What's most important in my opinion is being able to tell when it's peaked and *starting* to fall, since you want to usually use the starter before then. What I look at is the surface of the starter. When it's still rising the surface will be domed. When it starts to fall it will begin to look more flat, and eventually it may even look a bit cratered. As long as you can see that it's exhibiting some sign of this cycle then you're good. 

The other thing that's important is predictability. It should always peak around roughly the same time. My starter peaks 6 hours after feeding it. You can almost set your watch to it."

Even so, I have managed to put probably 40-50 hours of use on the vice and it still works great for my purposes. I was expecting the ball joint to be the weak point, and that it would probably die fairly quickly, but I was wrong -- it still works great and has no looseness or sign of becoming stripped. The only complaint I've had at all is that the vacuum suction on the bottom is really ineffective, and doesn't maintain a seal on any surface for me, but the base is heavy enough that I don't feel the need to use that feature anyways. 

I still think I will be getting a Panavice at some point, but probably not for at least another year or more of using this one. I think the Harbor Freight vice really can't be beat for the price.

* If you do go with this recipe again, I agree it needs more salt. I shoot for salt being 2-2.5% of flour weight in lean breads like this, generally. 
* I wouldn't go any longer on fermenting at room temp. You're already a bit overproofed here. 
* Cut back on the amount of flour used in shaping. I know it says a ""well floured surface"", but I'd dial it back. If you have a bench scraper then you can cut back on the flour even more, as you can use that to help transfer to the dutch oven. 
* Less flour in shaping will help prevent unincorporated flour in the crumb. 
* It was probably just a bit overproofed, which led to the stretchiness -- especially if it was stretchy without being elastic. 
* Too much flour on the bottom is what caused the lack of browning.
* Don't worry about losing water unless you're seeing it form a skin.

Sorry for your loss, by the way. I lost a starter a couple years back that I got started the week I met my now wife, which I was hoping to pass onto my kids. It sucks, but I've gotten a bit philosophical about it now, and much better at keeping dehydrated backup around. ;-)"
Sourdough,ffpyn8n,t3_euk8d1,1580111181.0,"Gotta toss it, unfortunately :(

The fruiting bit that you see as visible mold is like the part of a tree that's above ground. Even if you remove it, the roots still go throughout. Additionally, depending on the mold there may be mycotoxins in the starter already which could hurt you, and trying to remove that is like trying to get piss out of a pool."
ArtisanBread,ffpy7c3,t1_ffpwck0,1580110602.0,"Well whether or not it floats in water isn't a very useful test, unfortunately, due to variations in starters. 

Usually you want to base it off of how far along it is in terms of peaking -- whether that's doubling or tripling or whatever. Once your starter gets very established you will learn how much it typically grows and how long it takes to get there (example, it may always double 6 hours after feeding). From there, it depends on the application and the recipe, but it's very typical to try to use it when it's almost reached its peak. So if your starter typically doubles in 6 hours you might shoot for using it at 5 hours where it might be around 180% of the original volume. 

Other recipes may say to use a ""younger"" starter, so you might use it only a couple of hours after feeding it. This generally leads to a more mild flavor in my experience, but it can be really nice in the right application. Other recipes may say to use a more mature starter, which might after it's peaked or even begun to fall. Other recipes may use other criteria altogether. 

My best advice would be to follow a recipe that includes the feeding of the starter within the instructions, so you don't have to worry about if you're using it at the right time or not. Then when you get more comfortable with it you can make your own judgement. The beginner sourdough guide at The Perfect Loaf has a recipe like this ([here](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/beginners-sourdough-bread/)).
