FridgeDetective,fd884pv,t3_ejx3nl,1578215059.0,"So you're in England or nearby. You only shop at the supermarket, so I'm guessing a rather city-based life. Probably in a rather developed urban area.

I'm going to guess it's not a full family, but there's more than one of you. There's only one person shopping (mostly) though, and that person is the person who managed the finances in your household too. Very budget orientated, and loves a good deal.

You eat a lot of salad, and enjoy good quality take out. The household would like to eat home cooked more often, but there's not much time. Very work/profession orientated household, possibly containing at least one accountant/financial student and one engineer/architect.

I get the feeling that OP isn't the person who does the shopping, but this is my gut, I have no proof.  


Edit: changed ""family"" to household. I also want to ruminate on what I read from others. I don't think vegan is even vaguely right. So much dairy, cheese, turkey, and other things that look like non-vegan foods. I do think there's a smoothie obsession, and it's possibly deeper than New Year's. Looks like a long running smoothie addiction. This screams to me that one of you is a health nut, and could bring the ""household"" down to two people. Lastly, one of you is into running or heavily into gym."

science,fcjwdy5,t1_fch8aqi,1577707951.0,"Dammit. I wrote a long response to this and lost it. But either way, many of the mines being explored are some of the deepest in the world. AFAIK all of them are over 1km deep, with most being more than 2km. Couple that with much heavier weights (think 100 cubic meters of lead for example - 1113 tonnes). Now multiply those weights by the number of weights per shaft (your assume one - but I assume there's multiple per shaft).

Either way. It's totally feasible.

Thanks for doing the math though. Fun to actually play with the numbers, and you've taught me a bit about water."
