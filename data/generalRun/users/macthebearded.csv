So I sleep naked, obvi, and had someone break in a few years back. They'd gotten into my truck that the now-ex left unlocked, hit the garage door opener, and were rummaging around in my tools. I'd just happened to have a bout of insomnia and heard the garage open at like 1am (this was a weeknight, mind you).  

So I got up, grabbed the AR15 that lives next to the bed, slipped on my flip flops and snuck down to the garage. Opened the door violently and yelled ""What the fuck do you think you're doing?"" with the AR levelled at this stereotypical punk-kid-in-a-baggy-hoodie. Buck ass naked save for my flip flops.

I woke up mid-firefight and was like ""nooooo let me back in.""

motogp,felyd3w,t1_felt321,1579234086.0,"They're pretty great. Way more comfy than hard armor, and a bit lighter too.  

For street I have a Tuono jacket and my older normal one... whatever Dainese's top model was, Super something I think. Externally they're very similar, different stretch panelling but same features. The Tuono breathes a bit better (both are perforated). I've crashed them both and the old one held up *significantly* better... the older Tutu leather seems to be much more durable than the D-Skin 2.0, so take this into consideration. Personally I wouldn't buy DS2.0 again, either the old Tutu or move up to Kangaroo.  
When I bought my Tuono jacket the Smart ~~Vest~~ Jacket was being hyped up... not sure if it's been released yet. Integrated is nice but f I were to do it again I'd run the vest underneath a more sturdy jacket. Fixing the Tuono cost around $450 as it had holes worn through where it slid on the tarmac. My passive armor jacket was crashed much harder, slid faster for longer on rougher tarmac and didn't have any rips or tears, I still wear it as-is... I would have only needed to repack the vest if I'd had one."
