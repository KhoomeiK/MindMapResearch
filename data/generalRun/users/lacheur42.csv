So the people you see smoking are 99.9% addicts, which isn’t the case with alcohol.  By the time you’re seriously addicted to booze you’re drinking way too much to be sustainable for very long at all.  But most people never get to that point.

And it is a tiny component of OSU's billion dollar budget. Insignificant in both cases. As far as management costing money, that is true.   The Benton County Beazell Forest is an example of using forest to support management of the park. It takes few logs to support management and easily fits within carbon sequestration and storage goals. But the point up front is that this is not the College of Forestry's forest. It is OSU's forest, and the cost of management is insignificantly small in OSU's budget.

The logging operation in the forest is not ""tiny"" related to the size of the landscape they are logging. The forest has mostly been developed as industrial plantation, and will take a long time to make it look like a forest again."

That isn't true.  It's a complicated topic, and results of research on whether the lifetime healthcare costs of smokers are higher or not have been mixed.  That's because smokers die younger, and dead people are pretty cheap to maintain.

Here's some more info if you're interested:

""The net effect of smoking on healthcare costs has been investigated in several studies.6–18 Some modelling studies have suggested that although smokers suffer more from many kinds of diseases, non-smokers incur more healthcare costs because they live longer,6–8 ,11 ,12 yet others have reached the opposite conclusion.9 ,10 ,13–18 Only a few of these studies have included pension and insurance costs,7 ,12 ,17 ,18 and paid tobacco taxes.12 ,17 ,18 In 2001, Philip Morris provided a report to the Government of the Czech Republic, which indicated that the effect of smoking on the public finance balance in the Czech Republic in 1999 was positive and estimated to be 5815 million korunas (about 150 million USD).""
