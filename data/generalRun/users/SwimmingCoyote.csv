Sephora,ffaofld,t1_ffabzsu,1579740730.0,Multiple strangers have independently responded negatively to your post. The common denominator here is you.
jewelry,ffaaf9k,t3_esfgyz,1579731034.0,I LOVE these. Any chance you’d be willing to make a slightly smaller version?
Sephora,ff9z4dh,t3_esh0bx,1579724603.0,You seem difficult. You wanted to talk to a manager over sample jar labels?

pelotoncycle,ff7vyrj,t1_ff7o0yr,1579659655.0,Same. It’s a good way to still get a sweat even when I know there’s no way I can motivate myself to push my upper limit.

Makeup,ff62bv5,t3_erq08w,1579617354.0,"No, not anymore. When they first came out, all of the imitators paled in comparison. Now, plenty of brands off cheaper good alternatives. If you're real curious, you can find the real beauty blender on sale. Look for holiday or limited edition colors/packaging. I would not pay full price for one. My personal favorites are the Sonia Kashuk and EcoTools sponges. The Sonia Kashuk is giant and soft but with good bounce. It's great for foundation. The EcoTools is a little firmer and I like the edge for more precise control with cream cheek products and concealers."
nba,ff5vhcp,t3_erqbfz,1579611650.0,I love Dame. He seems like a good guy who reps Oakland and has been loyal to his small market team. He is having such a good year but the current team would be lucky to make it out of the first round of playoffs and definitely won’t make it out of the second. I really hope the Blazers put the pieces together so that he gets a ring eventually.

weddingplanning,ff46iw9,t3_erevel,1579556623.0,Congrats! Such a lovely and unique wedding. I didn’t even think to look at Oakland Cemetery when we were looking for Atlanta venues. What’s the story with the GW socks?
PlasticSurgery,ff3zdb1,t3_erirbx,1579552171.0,"You are not “very ugly.” You’ve got clear skin, great hair, and strong, symmetrical features. I’ve seen people that I would consider far less attractive on this sub and IRL. I’ve also seen women that I consider to be less attractive than you do fine dating because they have confidence.

If you want to go for a more stereotypically pretty look, you could look into getting rhinoplasty. I honestly wouldn’t touch anything else. However, given your low confidence, I’m worried you wouldn’t be happy even after plastic surgery. Please get therapy."

I didn’t end up picking this dress but if I had, I would have added the straps but kept them removable so I could wear them during the ceremony and take them off after."

PanPorn,fertm72,t1_femviug,1579358252.0,"Yea it’s definitely a wake up call about the amount of products I have. Because I hit pan on several makeup products this year, I thought this would be more impressive. It’s a good reminder that there’s often a long time between hitting pan and fully using a product."

Instagramreality,feo4q3f,t3_eq2cf2,1579295052.0,"This isn't a fair comparison. There's a huge difference in lighting, distance, and resolution. Also, I'm suspicious of the right hand picture and wonder if it's been enhanced to look worse."
PanPorn,fen1lsp,t1_felyfe3,1579274941.0,"Of the ones pictured, the Pharmacy is probably my favorite. I like that it takes off makeup easily, including eye makeup, and isn’t terribly hard to wash off. As for the rest,

-Bosnia: Loved this. I think it is very effective. Unfortunately, because it’s a liquid, I found myself going through it faster than a solid balm. I would not buy again because of that and because it’s not cruelty free.
-Clinique: I think this is great and will use it when given samples but again, it’s not cruelty free.
-Pixi: I HATED this. The face wash side was fine — a non offensive creamy face wash. The cleansing balm was awful. It left a film and broke me out. Also, you’d think a two in one product would be good for travel but I found that oil from the balm leaked out of the container.

It’s not pictured but I’m currently using the Drunk Elephant balm and love it. It has the same great qualities as the Farmacy but doesn’t have a scent and is a better value when you look at price per ounce."
PanPorn,felqd01,t1_felodfr,1579228376.0,"It’s the YTTP Adaptogen Deep Moisture. For pros, it is not irritating, doesn’t appear to have fragrance, and works well to hydrate and combat the dryness caused by my tretinoin. For cons, it’s not cheap and I’m not convinced it is superior to any other deep moisturizing night cream."
PanPorn,felq158,t1_felo7ym,1579228149.0,"I don’t, sadly. I’m also curious about the Fenty ones but I want to see reviews before buying since Fenty can be very hit or miss. I’m currently trying a Milk liner and it’s fine but not as good as I was expecting given that I’ve heard people rave about them. I loved the high liner formula but they’re too expensive to buy if they’re going to dry up before I can finish them."
PanPorn,felo6y6,t1_felepil,1579226879.0,Thank you!
PanPorn,felo6ll,t1_fele171,1579226872.0,"I like the Lala a lot. It’s a good night moisturizer that did not irritate my skin. That being said, I don’t know that it did anything super special. I’m trying out a Youth to the People cream and after that I have a Kate Summerville one to try. I could see myself possibly repurchasing if my skin went haywire and I wanted something that I knew would interact well."
PanPorn,felnzgi,t1_fel31pn,1579226738.0,"It really is so good, but I associate it with my 20s. I’m now looking for the more sophisticated, less initiators version."
PanPorn,felnwuz,t1_fekzskt,1579226688.0,"Thank you! After rereading my post, I realize I came off overly negative. I think I was just frustrated because there are 3-5 products that I was working on all year and they’re almost done but not quite. I want them in this round up! Oh well, they’ll definitely be in my 2020 recap."

PanPorn,fekzhpb,t3_eppw5z,1579210834.0,"Lessons learned:

1. I did not go through nearly as many products as I thought I did. I know there are a few things missing because I didn't care to save some during a move but those were only a few dry shampoo bottles.
2. I go through moisturizer and cleansing balm at a fairly good rate. This isn't surprising since I use it every day.
3. I'm the most disappointed in the makeup. Eyebrow products, eye liner, and mascara make up the majority of the makeup. I thought I'd have more makeup empties but I didn't realize how many products I've panned but have not finished.

Oldest product: UD double ended eye liner - this came with the original Naked palette when I bought shortly after it launched.

Most disappointing product: Marc Jacobs Highliner pencils -- these dried out within a year. 

Worst product: Tarte Empowered foundation -- this broke me out terribly and my skin isn't all that sensitive. Luckily this product is discontinued so it cannot inflict clogged pores on anyone else.

Most overhyped product: ByTerry and Laniege lip balms. These were fine so I used them up but I would not repurchase. Neither lasted all that long or were particularly hydrating. I much prefer the old Bite Agave lip mask formula. 

Best product: Covergirl microfine pencil -- I don't love it quite as much as the ABH formula, but for the price, I can deal with the difference. Plus, unlike the NYX pencil, the colors lean cool, not warm, which is better for my hair color. 

I'll glad provide thoughts on any other products if asked."

xxfitness,fek9di7,t3_ep70in,1579195329.0,"I only care about another person's gym attire when it reveals your genitalia. I've seen leggings so thin I could see the girl's bare skin and shorts so small that a ballsack was hanging out. Otherwise, as long as your privates are covered and wipe down the equipment, I don't care. 

That being said, I can't see myself ever doing it. I hate working out in leggings. I'm a sweaty person who overheats easily. I need shorts, and if I'm wearing shorts, I'd probably feel way too exposed if I was just wearing a sports bra."
Sephora,fek877n,t3_epm59w,1579194637.0,I just got one today too! This was my second time getting one. The first was months ago when I think they were more readily available.

xxfitness,fedygca,t3_eonnqx,1579022543.0,"HOORAY! Good for you! It takes a lot of courage to admit that you need to change and put that change into action. Paying for a coach was a good idea. You're making a lot of changes all at once so a coach can help that keep from feeling overwhelming. Please be gentle with yourself. There will be days when you do feel very sore, are frustrated with your progress, or fall off the wagon a bit. The important thing to remember is that improving your health is not linear. The goal is steady overall progress but there will be up and down data points. I've found it helpful to gather different types of data--scale, pictures, measurements, dividing my clothes by whether on not they currently fit. That way, when I don't see improvement in one aspect, the scale for example, I can still see how far I've come by some other means, such as a pair of pants fitting more loosely. You've got this! Just stick with it!"

femalefashionadvice,fedr0o1,t3_eolep8,1579018025.0,"I worry about the rise in popularity of waist training. At best, they do nothing. At worst, it could cause actual health issues. From what I've read, actual corset training should be done carefully and only if you're committed to that lifestyle.

As for me, I can't imagine wearing shapewear daily. I like to be comfortable and the thought of having to struggle to get my shapewear on and off every time I needed to pee sounds like such a hassle. I've tried it for special occasions but honestly, I'd prefer to buy styles that I feel comfortable wearing without shapewear."

BeautyGuruChatter,feagx2f,t1_fea6kj7,1578948606.0,"I said it *could be* attention seeking behavior, not that it definitely is. There is definitely a type of bisexuality coming out that I find eye roll inducing. It has to do with claiming minority identity without showing actual allyship. Obviously, that doesn't apply to Nikkie since her video was on a different topic. As for you, my comment was no way a judgment on you since I don't know anything about you."

femalefashionadvice,fea8huz,t3_eo7o7z,1578945610.0,"I am VERY bottom heavy with thick thighs and calves but a comparatively small waist. My legs are also short compared to my torso. This makes finding pants difficult. Skinny/slim cut jeans and pants look best because wide leg emphasizes the size discrepancy between my top and bottom halves and makes my legs look stumpier. However, finding skinny/slim cut pants that fit my thighs and calves can be difficult. I often have indentations from the seams of my jeans. Finding boots that fit my calf circumference is also a challenge. 

As I said, I'm bottom heavy but I still have broad shoulders and muscular arms. If I'm wearing a sleeveless shirt, I can generally wear a small because I'm rather flat chested. The minute you add sleeves, there is no knowing what size I'll be."

pelotoncycle,fdphphl,t3_emksao,1578628923.0,"Welcome back! The best way to turn it into a habit is to plan for it. Start off your week, or at least your day, planning when you’ll get on the bike. It’s a must make appointment. What also helps me is, if I’m not feeling it, telling myself I can do a shorter ride as long as I get on the bike. Usually, once I’m sitting on the bike, I usually end up still picking a 45 min class. Even when I really am not feeling it and do choose a shorter class, I’m still happy I rode when I’m done.

What about changing the way your approach the thoughts of your dad when you ride? I think that would be easier than trying to not associate him with the bike at all. Instead of associating it directly with his death, could you think of it as your time to remember him and honor the relationship you had? I’m sure he would be happy you’re taking steps to take care of your health."
