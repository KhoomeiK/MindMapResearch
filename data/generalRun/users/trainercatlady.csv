Imagine, a trial, in which a few brief testimonies were allowed at the police station and passed along as evidence to a trial, several witnesses to a crime have come forward, but that the defense of the trial has decided that it's damaging to their case, and that they are also a majority of the jury, and that before hearing any of this evidence, their minds were already made up and they had no intention of changing them from the start, no matter whether or not any additional evidence was admitted or not.

Meanwhile, the prosecution has armfuls of evidence, people willing to testify should they be legally required to, but the defense simply plugs their ears and shouts as loud as they can that the fact that a trial is happening at all is obscene and obsurd without listening or faithfully considering even a single piece of the evidence to the contrary, again, remembering that the defense, prosecution, and the jury are the same people, and essentially voting to acquit because the defendant is lining their pockets.
