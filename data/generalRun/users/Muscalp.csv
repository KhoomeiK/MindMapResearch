todayilearned,ffg3pay,t1_fffnys5,1579897784.0,There has never been a better setup for a joke
Maps_of_Meaning,ffcfmgp,t1_ffcfei8,1579798420.0,">You mean, it would only end up being a few dollars, even after a long wait

Yeah, exactly. You also have to keep in mind that a company probably won't buy your phone for 2,40$ given they have to extract the metal first."
Maps_of_Meaning,ffccdmr,t1_ffcc49b,1579796409.0,I doubt there'd be an amount that actually would make a sum. Especially since a private person certainly doesn't have the means to filter the metal.
Maps_of_Meaning,ffbtbxf,t3_esj7d2,1579781996.0,Isn't that literally what donating tech waste is about?
GetMotivated,ffbsvhs,t3_esm9dg,1579781501.0,"Although that certainly is a very big reason for self-hatred, unlike people here claim, it is naive to assume your true desires will always align with what you think is important and right."
nextfuckinglevel,ffbr7t5,t1_ffbo8v0,1579779540.0,"Would that really make a difference? You can't really blame someone who struggles to compete with real ""talent"" for not practicing as a kid, because kid's are fucking dumb. In that regard, talent stills stays talent, wether be it genetical or througg upbringing."
trashy,ff66foq,t3_erol6u,1579620262.0,"Of those 7, 2 probably were serious about it."
hajimenoippo,fep1be6,t1_feml55n,1579309922.0,"Lol the first part was exactly my thought too, but Ippo certainly won't go up to heavyweight. That's basically impossible anyway. He will probably stay at featherweight, since Ricardo Martinez is already the best pound for pound boxer, and thus the ultimate enemy. Any Chamo Ippo could face in other weight classes would be weaker."
justneckbeardthings,feodau3,t1_fek4tb4,1579298596.0,"As a former Neckbeard, I'd say being bullied and later on just treated with contempt is what made me a neckbeard, although I never was *that* extreme. Without porn I'd just have jerked off to my thoughts."
justneckbeardthings,feo9jgm,t1_feo9e4c,1579296971.0,"Well he said ""nasty"". Vape juice doesn't only consist of water but of other substances to which settle in the lungs."
justneckbeardthings,feo98wq,t1_fengbks,1579296791.0,"Well the dirt should reside, so you're just vaping water. Depending on the Temperature you might inhale live germs though"
gatekeeping,femsa7q,t3_epux4e,1579268169.0,A savvy warrior uses all of his tools
hajimenoippo,femgcys,t3_epxbty,1579254093.0,Well I also thought that to return ippo would have to work considerably on his defense
