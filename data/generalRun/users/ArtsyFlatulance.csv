energy_work,ff9n1se,t3_es10aq,1579716426.0,"I’ve discovered that it helps to leave much earlier than I need to. This allows me to start off my day in a calm way. I can take my time leaving the house. Extra time for petting my cats. There are many less traffic and parking issues. Then I have made myself a nice morning ritual where I go to my favorite coffee shop and have some me time. I can just sink into my phone, I can write in my dream journal, or draw, or just be around other people without having any obligations until work starts.

As far as energy goes, I like to lay out my outfit the night before, pack my purse/bag for work, and sometimes even tidy up the night before. This creates a sort of positive energy flow, and I just merge into it in the morning. It’s a way to respect the path that I know I will walk."

I’m an LMT, and professions that rely heavily on one arm, such as dental hygienists, hairdressers, electricians, and bartenders, tend to have chronic imbalance. Once things return to normal, he might consider regular massage to prevent overuse injuries."
massage,fezditq,t3_eqpuh6,1579456207.0,"Does he have any other symptoms? Nausea, dizziness, etc?

Is it completely numb, or just partially? Any tingling, burning, etc?

How is movement of the arm? Test elbow and shoulder range of motion, and all movements of the neck. 

Is he a side sleeper? Has this happened before? Sometimes people just “sleep funny”, but this sounds like more than that.

Try some gentle massaging of the front of the neck and pecs, and some heat. Maybe a hot shower. Does this improve symptoms?

See doctor"
Empaths,fevk6dk,t3_eqnw65,1579398343.0,It sounds like you had an epiphany. I’m guessing the next step would be acceptance of your not-knowingness. Perhaps then you start learning. You’re like a blank canvas :)

Lightbulb,fem1694,t3_epf8iq,1579236420.0,"There’s a little ice cream place where I live that has a little area in the back where they do family movie nights sometimes. It seems to work for them. Plus when there isn’t a movie going, it’s just a nice little outdoor area. I think there’s a mini stage as well"

massage,feivr6i,t3_ep7szn,1579148538.0,"I recommend Tai chi. It helped me learn how to move and flow smoothly. Particularly the move called “cloud hands”. Basically, you must become proficient with the flow of each arm and hand independently, and then learn how to merge their paths in ways that make sense to you as the practitioner."

Shamanism,fdrcdy7,t1_fdr96g9,1578682503.0,"Yes, they do. Yes, I am. I agree, if I die then I die. I’m not being a “crying pussy,” I thought you legitimately didn’t understand so I was trying to help. I know that it is necessary to kill in order to survive, but people don’t need wing fans and decorative antlers in order to survive. I’m not sure why you’re so angry, but don’t worry, I won’t bother you after this. Carry on, you angry little hornet you."
Shamanism,fdqrq87,t1_fdq2sxs,1578673457.0,"There’s plenty of people too. They die all the time. 

I’m pretty sure “ethically sourced” means that the animal was found dead, and wasn’t killed for its wings. Like how finding shed antlers is “ethically sourced”, as opposed to hunting the deer then taking the antlers.

It is egocentric to think that other lives don’t matter, whether they are your species or not."
