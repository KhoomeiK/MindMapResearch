AskDocs,ffuxyh1,t3_evcycc,1580251473.0,Yeah at this point it'd be best to go to a doctor. Until you see the doctor try some sensitive skin lotion see if that helps any but since it stayed this way for so long I'd definitely get an appointment.

AskReddit,fft8do0,t3_ev4h6h,1580212043.0,"I was passively suicidal. Like I wanted to die but could never attempt to do it. What gave me the point of my life was I started working on loving myself. It is really hard to do especially if you hold guilt and feel worthless but it is what helped me the most. Also that was around the same time I left any kind of religious or spiritual beliefs behind. 

I realized I didn't believe in it anymore and no god out there was gonna help me so I had to do it myself. So I started working on how I viewed myself and how I treat myself.

An easy thing to start doing anytime is keep a journal and write down things you like about your self and everyday write down something you were proud of that you did and all the good things that happened. And always end it with 'I love myself'.
