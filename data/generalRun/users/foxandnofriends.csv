QueerTheory,fed84ap,t3_eok35z,1579003212.0,"Before I answer I'd like to preface with a little semantics, just for the sake of intellectual discussion: Hegemony is not equal to normativity. Rather it is more so the process by which normative ideals are enacted. 

That being said, I find that this dilemma often pops up in queer theoretical discourse. If a supposed binary materializes, it is quickly pointed out and criticized. 

So here's a follow up question: Despite having fallen out of popularity, the work of Claude Levi-Strauss is interesting in this case: Is it possible that the archetypal nature of binary opposition prevents it from ever being fully avoidable? Is it an inevitable event horizon of human cognition? 

It seems the best we can do is just what you're doing: Continue to critique our own perspectives and in doing so continue to let our ideas evolve as we deem fit."

QueerTheory,fdt6gby,t1_fdt4ebt,1578712532.0,"All this being said, I completely agree with you. I often try to challenge myself to keep aware of the arbitrariness of even the distinctions I myself designate as significant. ""Lesbian"" obviously refers to a phenotypical female (or female-presenting) person who is attracted to another phenotypical female, and that will probably remain pretty stable. But as I said before, with my comment my intention was to highlight the arbitrary nature of things like identities. The individual in question can align themselves with any signification they want. Whether its logical or they ""ought to"" is beside the point. (But maybe it's totally the point. I have a hard time with things like sometimes, sarcasm is a doozy)."

QueerTheory,fdpd2wj,t1_fdp7763,1578625574.0,"Right. I didn't say whether they ""ought to."" But you're right, in that there is an extent to which an identity can be rational, (after which it simply fails to serve as a useful indexicality). By my comment I was sort of trying to highlight what, in my opinion, represents the spirit of queer theory, (to sum up an extremely diverse and complex discipline): The rejection of conventional assertions of what constitutes normality and deviance. Part of that is the desire to delineate fixed ""identity"" categories."

exchristian,fcm9v1m,t3_ehxy4k,1577768179.0,"I recommend LSD. I took often after I left my religion, so it always reminds me of that period of my life. Get a test-kit to test its purity before tripping. I was lucky and had very close connections with suppliers, but I've heard a lot about unsafe research chemicals being marketed as pure LSD when they are no such thing. 
Take your trip on a nice clear spring/summer day and spend some time outdoors with a friend. Listen to your favorite music, if you're active run around and just enjoy yourself. I would start at a lower dose for your first time (110-150 micrograms). If you feel like you'd need it, bring a sober friend along to act as a ""trip-sitter,"" although at a low dose I think you'd be just fine without. LSD is a LOT less scary/intense than folks sometimes make it seem. 
Check out r/LSD for more info, if you've any further interest."
