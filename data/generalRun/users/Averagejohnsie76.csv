Battlefield,fffu30r,t1_ffft9he,1579891815.0,I feel like the game has just changed a lot. There aren't as many players who are team oriented. At least in my experience.
Battlefield,fffrv0v,t1_fffr5w7,1579890440.0,I try to support my team at my strongest play style (medic) but I cant when planes and tanks are obliterating us and I'm forced to switch to assault becuase of planes and tanks lol
Battlefield,fffqz86,t3_esxp6c,1579889897.0,ahhh that's what's happening! I never get in planes becuase I'm really terrible at them but recently I've had to spend entire games using the flegarfuast (Didnt spell that correctly). Just so that we can get into an objective on breakthrough. Its felt like our planes aren't doing anything to combat planes.
BattlefieldV,fffo9dy,t3_et7u5t,1579888219.0,"What exactly can Dice do to stop us from completely messing up their data? It is clear they are only going to listen to their data. They do not care how many people uninstall or stop playing. There data shows them something they prefer to happen. 

What happens if we fight back? If the entire community only uses one gun? If we randomly quit games for no reason? I mean, would it be enough to move the data in our favor?

Edit: what if we completely stop playing the new maps or stop using the new guns?"
BattlefieldV,ffejdn6,t1_ffe2z4s,1579850428.0,"Good point, if the new weapons are within the first 10 ranks then it wouldnt be terrible but we all know it wont work out that way. It will be just by chance that the new weapons are exactly at the paid $9.99 and $19.99 boins rank."

memes,ff9hkv5,t1_ff9fj7s,1579713174.0,"From my experience, it depends on the job."
memes,ff9hh4v,t1_ff9fbog,1579713111.0,"I havent started my career so maybe down the road I will work differently but I've held 4 jobs in my life. The first 3 I tried my best every day, at every shift, with every customer. I was subsequently fired or forced to quit those jobs becuase management just wanted more, more, more. It always happened around the 6th month mark when I would be asked to move up the ladder but didnt want the extra responsibility for a dollar or so raise. My 4th job i did nothing. Showed up but purposefully did nothing. Spent 3 years there before having a good farewell for school. Crazy."
todayilearned,ff53kqm,t3_ermtk2,1579579273.0,Lol but the assholes who want constant war wont let that happen...come on now.
UnethicalLifeProTips,fep0wix,t1_feoqbm5,1579309663.0,We just used 1s from the drawer and left a note to remind us to put the 1s back.
firestorm,fekdk87,t3_ep6m4a,1579197802.0,Never been in an end game where both squads were in vehicle and a helicopter at that.
BattlefieldV,feh23iv,t3_ep2urx,1579107539.0,"I mean, I've kinda had a thought about how much more profitable the coming generation is for this company. I have a 9 year gap with my younger brother and he spends money on games. I personally grew up in a time where you earned everything in game. Maybe this move was to pull in more players from his generation who love run and gun games."
todayilearned,fdo6xla,t1_fdnyty8,1578599953.0,Ahhh there it is. So not even close to the same. I was just making a guess towards why they might have possible not considered her born until a later date. Could be religous reasons though.
pics,fdnsa64,t1_fdnhf9d,1578591815.0,NEXT!!!
todayilearned,fdnovxh,t1_fdnkgc7,1578590147.0,Am I wrong about the religious ideology of the quickening or something like that. Where someone isn't truly born until the spirit enters them? I could be completely off on all of that but just a guess.
dataisbeautiful,fdl4olo,t1_fdktlqa,1578516992.0,Hol up....
AskReddit,fdkvhlm,t3_elssvy,1578512004.0,I always thought how impossible it was for professional athletes to be able to play their sport and play my brother all the time on xbox live.
firestorm,fdkclt6,t1_fdkbtkw,1578501034.0,I dont blame you man. There are definitely at least 4 squads I know of on xbox who use modded controllers. Just part of the game.
firestorm,fdkccnm,t1_fdkb22c,1578500884.0,Green sunomi RIP lol I used to use the pink bren and MG42 as a counter becuase I'm pretty shit with snipers but now it's kinda like. Oh...A sniper...Guess I'll die but I agree with you. It's great for those medium and long range battles. Sending one flank up the side to clean up.
firestorm,fdkam8p,t1_fdk88uk,1578499821.0,Yeah man. Reverting the ttk would be the shit but if they keep it the same then I hope there's less snipers. It feels like currently the only counter to a sniper is another sniper or wasting an artie.
firestorm,fdkad11,t1_fdk7uhq,1578499661.0,Different weather would be cool but I mean. The map is pretty diverse with weather. Random rain showers would be sweet.
firestorm,fdka98r,t1_fdk82ov,1578499594.0,I mean hes got 251 wins with 91 losses. That's not crazy.
firestorm,fdk7bg5,t3_elfsvq,1578497722.0,You've gotta be a legend in firestorm.

BikiniBottomTwitter,fdgnl4d,t3_el7zse,1578403253.0,What have you done. I live in this state and I will never unsee this.
loseit,fdebbzu,t1_fdeanqd,1578335290.0,Yep! That's pretty much a complete format of my idea! Thank you. I'm going to try that out and I'll update my post with it.
BattlefieldV,fdeaw17,t3_ektpa4,1578335015.0,The shitty part is that firestorm battles take forever unless you just run and gun people.
BattlefieldV,fdeaqyy,t1_fddykwv,1578334926.0,"Its frustrating that you dont even hear the shots or know you're getting shot before you're dead. For me, the game cant even process the shots in time. I just see a guy, a flash, then I'm dead followed by the sound of 10 bullets hitting me. This is on xbox btw."
BattlefieldV,fdeafzq,t3_ektvvn,1578334733.0,"Team balancing is on the top of my list. It seems like it would be easiest to handle and It immediately makes the game more enjoyable. There is nothing more boring than playing a game that gets out of hand in the first 5 minutes then it's another 10-15 minutes of looking at yourself bleed out every spawn in. 

Idk how they could complete this but just using the tracker app could help them. Sort by rank then by play style. I know people joining in from advanced search will be unsorted but if the game is already decently balanced then it shouldnt be a huge issue."
loseit,fde9qra,t1_fde9e6j,1578334288.0,No I havent. Is it the same idea?
comedyhomicide,fde73wt,t1_fdde3ne,1578332629.0,Exactly what I was thinking...she wanted to help and thought of an actual way to help instead of just talking to family and friends about it.
