Moviesinthemaking,fevuipt,t1_fevtup3,1579401678.0,"It's fascinating because it's ever-changing due to our cultural knowledge continuing to grow. Even 15 years ago I bet people would have been absolutely convinced that there were no visual effects and things would have looked more or less natural. But because as a society, we already have a shared knowledge built on the advancements of the past, we are trained to notice things we wouldn't have before."
Moviesinthemaking,fevrta6,t1_fevoia0,1579400763.0,"That's basically become the new ""uncanny valley"" for de-aging effects. You can age down how someone looks but not how they move or hold their body.

The part with DeNiro sitting shirtless in the steam room legitimately cracked me up. Here was this relatively young and fit body with the arms and shoulders all bunched up like an old man."

I just clicked on this video to watch it. I'm ready! I don't need an extra three seconds to prepare."

politics,fdg0vq9,t1_fdevaci,1578375974.0,">""Trump is threatening war crimes against Iran, and none of his top advisors have the courage to publicly oppose it. Instead, they act like cowards and go on background with journalists to express their opposition. They should all resign. They don't deserve to serve this country.""

While I do agree with this sentiment, I find it ironic that it's coming from an anonymous source."
todayilearned,fdfjzqa,t1_fde9ubc,1578363489.0,"The interesting thing about his Eiffel Tower scam was that the people who fell for it weren't as na√Øve as you might think.

When the Eiffel Tower was originally built for the 1889 World's Fair, it was not clear whether or not it would remain a permanent structure. Even decades later, the permanence of it was not a given.

The idea that it would dismantled and sold for scrap was not out of the realm of possibility."

AskReddit,fdc7omm,t1_fdaa8dp,1578268713.0,"That definitely doesn't sound real at all. You don't go from trying heroin for the first time to being fully addicted in under two weeks. And I don't mean that in a ""oh people think drugs are way more dangerous than they are"" kinda way. The human body is not physically capable of creating a dependency that quickly.

There are physical changes that occur as part of addiction but like any changes the body goes through, it takes time.

If he took the amount of heroin needed to create an addiction in only two weeks, he would've been dead. And not from an overdose. He would've been dead by having more heroin in his veins than blood."
