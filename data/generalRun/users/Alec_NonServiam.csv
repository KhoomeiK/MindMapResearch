Without addressing at least two of the three, you can never really squash the problem."
news,fgjtn8f,t1_fgjoa59,1580851171.0,"You can also read it like this:

49% have nothing, including no 401k and no IRA.

41% have a small amount, netting to a total of 15% of corporate equity

10% have a large amount, netting to a total of 85% of corporate equity

I think his point stands."
news,fgjt60g,t1_fgiyewv,1580850903.0,"I mean, if 100% of people were employed and 99% of them worked exactly minimum wage for 40 hours a week, technically we'd have 0 unemployment rate but a really shitty economy assuming current costs of goods.

So while it is a useful indicator for trends, job quality is also important (percentage of jobs with full benefits, percentage of jobs able to qualify for their area's average mortgage/rent, etc)"
PUBGConsole,fggs94r,t1_fgfb4q2,1580768414.0,"Hey, same issues as OP, happens to me at various times on all maps but more often on Miramar and more often when driving. The only common thread seems to be crashing while moving either your character or a vehicle. Doesn't seem to happen when looting stationary, did not happen as often before this patch.

Hope that helps. X1S / SSD."

They've got a hell of a lot of votes and comments for being the 5%."

The few I do see are talking about either a specific economic factor subject to change (like fed rate) or a specific company's financials. The echo chamber is real, I suppose."

You're buying SPY which is up, and pretty par the course over the last 5 year average?

I mean dollar cost average US companies by all means but buying the down market would be buying the shenzhen index in a few days once the dip has had a chance to break the circuit a few times."
investing,fggmhum,t1_fgelcv8,1580764947.0,I see more comments like thejourney made than actual bears saying the end is nigh or overvalued markets gonna drop. The former is always upvoted highly. Just an observation.
