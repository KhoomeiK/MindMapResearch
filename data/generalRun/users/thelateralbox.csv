MapPorn,fepdubv,t1_fenvfow,1579318062.0,"As a native Arizonan, I hate Cali transplants so badly. They constantly badmouth my state and talk about how much better and more cultured the utopian paradise of LA is over the desert yokel town of Phoenix.

CAguns,fel0mhy,t1_fekx1po,1579211509.0,"Nope, Afghanistan. The US army can win against pretty much any formal armed force with tanks, planes, and a defined leadership structure. What it can't do is successfully occupy a country that doesn't want it there."

gunpolitics,fdordn2,t1_fdoik95,1578611183.0,"I can literally not stress the fact that Martha McSally ran possibly the worst campaign I'd ever seen. I think I remember seeing one ad by her campaign that said she stood for retirement benefits, but the rest of the hundred or so ads I'd seen were attack ads over Sinema wearing a tutu during a war protest or trying to say she was in support of pedophilia or Al queda by using out of context quotes. (The quotes were that she thought that if a 16 year old looked clearly over 18, there should be a lesser sentence and that she didn't really care if someone wanted to go join Al queda)  I didn't know the anything about McSally or her policies until after the election, and you can be sure that the average voter didn't. (My exact words the day after the election: ""she was the first female US fighter pilot?! You think she'd bank on that!"") 

Meanwhile Sinema did mostly positive ads about how she believes in Arizona and our people and stuff like that to the point I almost got suckered in to voting for her until I looked up her record on guns."

And If I remember correctly, Mr. ""Hell yes we're going to take your guns!"" was only beaten by a razor thin margin in Texas. It could have plausibly gone the other way if Ted Cruz ran as awful of a campaign as McSally did."
gunpolitics,fdo3q5e,t1_fdnrv67,1578598334.0,"AZ only voted Sinema in because she played the whole ""moderate Democrat"" angle while mcsally ran an extremely negative campaign exclusively around trashing Sinema. (I didn't even know mcsally was a USAF pilot or literally anything about her when it was time to vote.) We voted in a Republican governor who pretty much spat in the faces of our teachers after the largest state political movement in years demanded better teacher pay. I'm pretty sure we have about as much time left as Texas does."
gunpolitics,fdmwc3u,t1_fdmbprg,1578568823.0,Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch. Liberty is a well-armed lamb contesting the vote.
todayilearned,fdmw5uq,t1_fdmkcun,1578568604.0,"The US government split up my family and stuck them in internment camps in the middle of the Arizona desert with no air conditioning, barbed wire, and inward facing machine guns, all despite them being citizens. Don't act like the situation at the southern border is the worst human rights violation the US has ever enacted, let alone compare it to the Holocaust.


(Also, just a little vent: the Japanese community has gone out of our way to call our camps ""internment camps"" out of respect for the Jewish people and the weight the word ""concentration camps"" has because of the Jewish experience during the Holocaust. But then along roll hyperbolic people like you who call an air conditioned warehouse with a chain link fence a concentration camp because you want to bank on the association with the Holocaust to dunk on Trump.)"
PublicFreakout,fdldlp7,t1_fdl3pb2,1578521756.0,"If his policy was just keeping the status quo on gun rights, I'd probably vote for him over throwing my vote away on a third party.

todayilearned,fdhjysp,t1_fdhfyrb,1578424251.0,Democrats put my entire family in a prison camp with barbed wire and inward facing machine gun towers because of their race even though they were *US citizens*.
