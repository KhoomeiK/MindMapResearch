WayOfTheBern,ff86twu,t1_ff7yfft,1579667642.0,">1. I went to college and got a good paying job because of it. I owe student loans. My brother who didn't go to college and has no student loans needs the money a lot more than I do. Under Bernie's plan, I would be given $20k and my brother would get nothing. People who didn't go to college, poor people need free money a lot more.

 >2. Here's a comparison. I worked the evening while I was in college, and I saved my money and tried really hard to reduce my debt. I paid off almost half my student loans before I graduated. My friend didn't work and just took more loans to cover his living expenses. He took out extra student loans to buy video games, fast food, extra spending money and drug money. He's like $60k in debt now because he maxed out his student loans on stupid shit, meanwhile I was working late and being responsible to pay off my loans. Why should we reward his behavior with free money instead of mine?

See I basically did both of those examples. I never maxed out my loans, but when I was a dumb 18 - 21 year old I always kept the extra ~$2000 each semester to pay for shit I wanted or just to help out with bills. I usually had a job during that period, but as a broke young kid with no financial instruction and no outside financial help I came to rely on that surplus of money. Ultimately I racked up about $28k in student debt. 

Then more recently I went back to school to get an electrical engineering degree and completely paid for all of it out of pocket. I worked my ass off and now I'm an engineer. I will be able to pay off my loans very quickly, probably before I would ever theoretically receive loan forgiveness. 

I still support debt cancellation. I think that our college process, and specifically the process of giving huge loans to kids who haven't even fully mentally developed yet, is predatory. I don't think that your friend should ever have even had the OPTION of getting into that much debt at that age. 

Beyond that, I view all the capital tied up in this predatory process as a lost benefit to the market. $28k is a down payment on a house. It could be seed money for a new business. It could be savings for an emergency that prevents someone from going bankrupt. Saddling multiple generations of people with this much debt only serves to destabilize the middle class. 

As for your brother, I think Bernie's platform is comprehensive enough that even people like your brother would benefit from it. Healthcare, college education if he ever wanted to try to get a degree, raise in minimum wage (which will raise wages for all workers), end citizen's United,  probably other things that I'm forgetting"

I would get the design decision if Apple owned a ton of lightning port components in a warehouse somewhere, but I feel like it's just a last-ditch cash grab before customer pressure forces them to make a change.
