Showerthoughts,ffhu93h,t1_ffgoam9,1579954174.0,How many more of the less candy can you eat. Lets give the humans “fun size” so they can  gorge themselves on the entire fucking bag.
offmychest,ffeue2b,t1_ffeu4c8,1579865958.0,It was put in place for the states with lower populations. Has nothing to do with education.

offmychest,ffestzn,t1_ffercbi,1579863878.0,"Trump won by electoral college votes, not popular votes. The majority of Americans didn’t want this man to be President...."
IWantOut,ffbqyjl,t1_ffazdex,1579779217.0,Florida is one of the cheapest states to live in.
AskAnAmerican,fev3pw4,t1_fetoolp,1579392755.0,Ahhh ok. Here in the US it’s just creepy.
AskAnAmerican,feqxfnb,t3_eq8w80,1579347191.0,You really want 20-30 year olds to be in school with kids 15-16 years old? No way. Creepy and very problematic
entwives,feque8h,t1_feqn61s,1579346083.0,I lived in Seattle for a bit. Didn’t snow munch in the city
entwives,feqedbl,t1_fepm167,1579340838.0,That explains all of that white nonsense on the ground

entwives,femx4q4,t1_femwhz3,1579271902.0,Not sure if you were part of the one I was in but the creator of mine seemed to be responsive and interested in making sure everyone got a gift who sent one.
TrueOffMyChest,femt3vy,t3_epz0pa,1579268843.0,This post and the comments are the issue.... you sound like the entitled race with this bullshit.
Wellthatsucks,femsqtr,t1_femdo3t,1579268544.0,Well you did buy a 15 year old $2500 used car with no warranty. There is also no way for the dealership to know the clutch was about to burn out. For them to offer to buy the part on a vehicle you voluntarily bought AS IS is something they didn’t even have to do.
entwives,femqah2,t1_felw5dt,1579266449.0,The organizer of the secret Santa reached out to those who didn’t get gifts. She mentioned sending out a gift herself to people who sent a gift and didn’t get one back. Did you happen to reach out to the organizer?
AmItheAsshole,fem9xla,t3_eptwhh,1579245291.0,YTA. You knew she was in there and ignored it. He is part homeowner. The kid is 5 and is his daughter. Maybe you should move out with your cat and date someone with no kids.

Tinder,fdq2301,t3_emb867,1578651054.0,"A number of years ago I was consulting a customer at his retail car sales office. He mentioned wanting to buy the business but couldn’t because of his “felony” record. Me (with my offbeat sense of humor) said “oh you were in prison?” He said “yes. I was. For 9 years.” Several of my customers had been to prison, so I wasn’t taken aback by this, but mostly because of simple things like drugs... Me: (joking) “oh, How many people did you murder?” Then I laughed. But he didn’t laugh. He just looked at me and said “only one.” I quickly changed the subject. 

I did google his name when I got home that day. Yep. Murder. Well, manslaughter. I always made it a point to be kind to him."
Whatcouldgowrong,fdq1exx,t1_fdpnbay,1578650091.0,"I actually lived in Vegas around 2000-2001. There was no tram. No sky-bridges. It was a nice walk up and down the strip. After I moved, I didn’t get back to visit until 2013-2014. I was incredibly surprised at how much the city grew and changed. The vibe was still the same, but Vegas really exploded. I will actually be there in a few days at Caesars Palace!"
AmItheAsshole,fdq17w0,t3_emdtnh,1578649810.0,"Nope. NTA. Kudos to getting healthy! GF sounds a bit insecure. Most of us women are to some degree. I think she over reacted, but I can totally get how she could get the wrong idea. Keep the weight off and get those weights UP! It’s your body - your decision! 

P.S. - I think video chats are the creepiest thing. I rarely FaceTime with my wife. Or anyone for that matter. Hell I actually have it disabled on my phone. I grew up in the 80s, so I still prefer to kick it old school."
relationship_advice,fdpz28o,t3_emkm7y,1578646783.0,"Sounds like he might have some internalized abuse from someone or he has underlying feelings towards men and his homophobia is causing him to react this way. Whatever the reasoning is, it’s bizarre and very weird."

entwives,fdnswfy,t3_emb7or,1578592172.0,We lived in an apartment and got a similar letter to this one. My neighbor below us complained about the smell. Anyway - everyone is right. Nothing they can do. They would need solid proof before evicting anyone. They have to give you notice to come in your apartment and they are not permitted to search through your things.  They aren’t police and don’t have a search warrant.
oddlysatisfying,fddwqrx,t1_fddk8cq,1578325855.0,I was just being silly. Didn’t mean any harm :)

entwives,fddiv08,t1_fddioqf,1578314049.0,"It really is. I grew up in the 90s and often wish I could go back to those times. Maybe because
I was younger and more innocent, but seems the world was nicer and people cared more back then."
entwives,fddic5m,t3_eknwjh,1578313465.0,"I am in the US and see the news daily. There is not much being televised here, but there has been some coverage. The media is too consumed with the “Trump impeachment” and the Iran conflict to bring us other worldly news. You guys are in my thoughts."
awfuleverything,fdbzqt2,t1_fdajb0q,1578264424.0,Omg. It was the absolute hottest thing. And people thought they would be worth millions of dollars!
AmItheAsshole,fcu0wnr,t3_eiqkar,1577968736.0,Would you have responded the same way if you saw husband hugging a female? I’m guessing you wouldn’t have said a word.... YTA. Hugging isn’t cheating and women can have male friends without fucking them. You could have cost this guy his marriage.
DoesAnybodyElse,fctk0dt,t3_eikno5,1577946018.0,I’m 41... wondered just the other day what the fuck happened to my life. Like wasn’t I just turning 21 yesterday? Time seemed to pass much slower when I was a kid. Now I blink and I’m getting AARP letters every other week....damnnn...
DoesAnybodyElse,fcs76tr,t1_fcraa5x,1577912396.0,No. Takes me two hours to get back off it. Hahaha
DoesAnybodyElse,fcq5tin,t3_eig2vo,1577879365.0,"I do it all the time and can never go back to sleep. I feel like sleeping in is “wasting the day.” So now my alarm goes off at 5am and then I get up, take my blanket and go to the sofa for another 2 hours."
shittyfoodporn,fcmuhx7,t3_ehytmy,1577792880.0,That looks pretty damn good
AmItheAsshole,fcjuyjk,t3_ehcfsb,1577706013.0,"I kind of think YTA. It seems like it was an honest mistake and at the end of the day, we are talking about a car - piece of metal. No animal or baby was left inside and no one was harmed. I have a hybrid with a push button start and have left the car running so many times accidentally I lost count. It’s a harmless mistake and you are acting like he did something horrendous."

HelpMeFind,fcfldal,t3_eh6nxb,1577631278.0,This bear is from the 1950s. The bear has a rubber face and was all black. The eyes were the orange starburst. Everything was exactly the same to this image but the color was different. I looked on eBay and have for years. Never seen a black one. I’ve looked on Etsy and toy collector. This bear belonged to my mother and was then passed down to me. It was produced by a company called MY-Toy.

AskWomen,fc58cmj,t1_fc55a2y,1577448380.0,I am a migraine sufferer. No one gets the intensity of a migraine unless you have experienced it yourself. I get so tired of people saying it’s just a headache. I end up in the ER about 2 times a year for how bad they get.
