penpals,fgks6jp,t1_fgkkt7l,1580872422.0,PM me! We could do like a test letter or two and see how it works out.
penpals,fgg7ikk,t3_ey155w,1580755924.0,"Hi! I'm 16F/NB in the US (I turn 17 in March). I have a lot of hobbies but my favorites are photography, videogames, ice hockey, and watercolor. I also collect rocks and stationary. Snail mail is a really cool idea to me because I actually get to use all the stationary I collect lol. I think its also fun to learn about other people and their lives. Writing is way easier to understand than talking for me because I have auditory processing issues, so I prefer stuff like this. PM me if you're interested, I think it could be fun but if you're uncomfortable with me being older then definitely don't feel obligated to."

cats,fg8b41b,t1_fg87vbg,1580614405.0,They say there isn't anywhere else in the house... do you think up higher in the same room would be okay? It really sucks because it feels like they just don't want her and they're not willing to try things out
