Truth is I always feel like there are some of us who will never be that someone special to anyone. There's few of us who'll walk the streets wondering if there will ever be someone to appreciate us.  
But that's life.  One foot forward the other one following staring up."
depression,feffa61,t3_eom99o,1579055095.0,"You are not alone.  It's okay to feel that way sometimes. Most times I feel like a waste of space but when am not feeling like that, I look back and see am intact not  a waste of space but a gem.  

Bottom line, YOU ARE NOT ALONE."
depression,fecshnt,t3_eofgj0,1578982911.0,"I sincerely understand you.  I have asked that question a million times.  I have been there not long ago but 2 days ago. 
I don't have the right answer.  I swear I don't know why am not dead yet. 
I wish I had an answer that would soothe your pain.  
But all I have is me so you are not alone. Am a mess and I can not hide it anymore.  But you are not alone."
depression,fduq3u2,t3_emvtuu,1578737158.0,"Am in the same boat.  
But am really getting tired.  This is not life.  This is a struggle and it's getting really hard.  It's getting impossible.  It never gets better."
