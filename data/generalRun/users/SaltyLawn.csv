What you're wanting to do is find YOUR actual TDEE by first estimating(MFP's suggested amount) and tracking that over a period of time(weeks) and grab your average. Your weight will swing around daily but there should be a somewhat steady decline over several weeks/months. If you're losing 2 pounds on average then your actual TDEE is 500 more than MFP's recommendation and so on and so forth.
