ChoosingBeggars,fdgzzi0,t1_fdg5m8r,1578412376.0,"I can't remember the story exactly, but my work tells people that think we charge too much the same story every time.
There was an engineer that had designed a nuclear power plant. Several years after the plant was built, they had a problem. Sirens started going off, people were panicking, workers didn't know what to do. So they called the engineer that designed the plant to come solve the problem. He came, calmly walked in, thought for a bit, and the went to flip a couple switches. Everything went back to normal. He had saved the day and the plant. Later on he sent the owners a bill for $100,000. The owners freaked out and asked him to itemize what exactly the large bill was, as he had only flipped a couple switches. He responded with ""$1 to flip the switch, $99,999 to know which switch to flip""
