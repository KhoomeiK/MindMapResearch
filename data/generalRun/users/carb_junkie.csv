depression,fczcvny,t3_ejamne,1578098383.0,"All the time (want to cry but somehow can’t). I often realize how much I’d rather just be crying than be stuck with how messed up my tense breathing and muscles are from my anger and frustration from ruminating negative thoughts and not being physically able to really cry. It sucks. I don’t even care who sees me or not. And I’m a girl (I mean that in no disrespect whatsoever to men OR women, we’re just always told women can cry more easily because of societal conditioning, whether that’s implied positively or negatively or neither)."
depression,fcx29t8,t1_fcvu6px,1578048028.0,"First off, I’m glad to hear this and I appreciate the encouragement. I don’t mean to assume your type of situation/depression and I’m not, however you did remind me of something I was thinking about before: situational depression vs chronic mental illness, and combinations of both. I was thinking about this because, while horribly depressing circumstances or drawn out tough periods of life can be incredibly taxing and cause people to not be themselves or think clearly, I currently tend to believe that time and powering through can lead to a light at the end of the depressed tunnel that seems impossible at the time for situations/grief - but compounded with 1, 2 or 3 mental illnesses left untreated and without financial means for treatment has me convinced that it won’t get better in the long-term. I hope I’m wrong, though. 

I’m really digging the lack of judgement here and how people understand what depression is and isn’t, so I hope I don’t come across as dismissive of what your case was, it just reminded me of that thought."
depression,fcx1ryv,t1_fcvq8cs,1578047391.0,"I feel you on the sleep issue also. :( On a side note, I admit I’ve never tried SSRI’s, but aside from my non-expert opinion against them and admitted ignorance of them on a personal level, I still refuse to try them because of financial distress, and yet wonder if it has been “the answer” (not a cure of course, but if it’s medically necessary for me and I won’t come to realize it because of my stupid stubbornness)

That sounds so interesting re transferring to someone who needs it..."

But yeah, just seems like Turo would be losing much more business in denying owners compared to the repair costs they want to avoid by being that nitpicky."
