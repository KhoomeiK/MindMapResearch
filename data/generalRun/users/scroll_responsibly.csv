politics,fbypdw4,t1_fbyntjp,1577222832.0,"I love how you spew data and then when I ask for a source you:

1.	Dismiss me as a prick
2.	Call me pedantic 
3.	State that the data that I provided was wrong even though the article is about favorability
4.	Bring up your job that doesn’t prevent you from posting on Reddit but magically prevents you from finding data that is as you put it “fucking everywhere”
5.	State that you are making an “observation” which is odd seeing as 14-18% is very specific and authoritative sounding for an off the cuff observation 
6.	State that my requesting of a source is trolling

Maybe you should edit your original comment to say that it’s unsourced conjecture if you don’t have a source."
politics,fbylsmc,t1_fbyl0bz,1577220165.0,"You didn’t let your job get in the way of calling me a prick but somehow it gets in the way of (as you put it) doing a Google search for data that are “fucking everywhere”.

Edit: and you still haven’t provided a source.  Also, I like how you’re all about how you have a job as if it’s something special.

Edit 2: a word"
politics,fbyjkcc,t1_fbyflft,1577218520.0,"So, seeing as you see your self as statistically literate, please point me to your source. Regardless of my statistical literacy, you made a conjecture backed with words like “prick” and “pedantic” but no data.

Edit: the guy you first responded to was talking about favorability same as OP and the link I posted."

[This](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/sanders_favorableunfavorable-5263.html#!) is the link I’ve found. Maybe I’m not statistically literate, but I don’t see the ceiling at 18%."
