She’s basically explaining purchasing “points” which is like a small little chunk of money you pay them now in order for them to drop your interest rate a little bit. It adds up as a win for you in the long run if you plan on owning it for a long time. Otherwise just don’t buy any points and move on.

I have a brother who is really into motorcross so I’m sure he’s going to be the lucky bastard that breaks his leg and gets the family jewels.
