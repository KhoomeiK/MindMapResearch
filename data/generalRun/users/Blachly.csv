service_dogs,ffa94n1,t1_ffa8r0c,1579730295.0,That's a great question.
service_dogs,ff9ybxv,t1_ff9xns7,1579724139.0,"It's not really a new rule, though. That's always generally been how it's been done - You are not entitled to spill over into your neighbor's footspace, and airlines do only have limited space. The SD handler will have to be conscious of their dog's comfort throughout the flight, and maybe schedule occasional restroom trips or just a walk up and down the aisle (when possible) - Which is healthy for humans as well, to get the blood circulating a bit better. I don't really know what the airlines or regulation can do about that in the SD law portion.

It is interesting that one of the comments from disability advocates was to regulate that airlines can't make the seat size any smaller (which wouldn't just relate to SDs, but in general) - Which would definitely help, I think."
service_dogs,ff9xgru,t1_ff9wfdq,1579723623.0,"So what would your proposed solution be?

It sounds like they'd still leave the requirement to seat the handler next to an empty seat if there's one available.

>In instances where an animal is too large to fit in the passenger’s foot space or be placed on the passenger’s lap, the Department proposes to require airlines to seat the passenger traveling with a service animal next to an empty seat within the same class of service where the animal can be accommodated, if such a seat is available.  If there are no empty seats available to allow a passenger to travel with the service animal in the cabin on the passenger’s scheduled flight, the Department proposes to require airlines to provide passengers the option to transport the animal in the cargo hold for free, or to transport the passenger on a later flight with more room if available."

Can you excuse yourself without your dog fidgeting? Yes. So why would it be considered a task? Obviously, you have the presence of mind to realize you wish to leave the situation - You're cuing the dog to do a behavior to lead to that. Now, why is the dog's behavior in that chain required at all?

Now, that being said, some people find the pretense useful, and so they choose to train it anyway. There's no harm in that. But if you took this to court, and went in front of a judge, and laid it out for them, what would they say?

A good place to start looking if you're looking for a program dog (where you get an already trained dog) is the ADI website: [https://assistancedogsinternational.org/member-search/?query=%28Region.eq.ADINA%29](https://assistancedogsinternational.org/member-search/?query=%28Region.eq.ADINA%29) You will probably have more luck finding a program that trains Diabetic Alert Dogs (often shortened to DADs) and then working with either the program or a separate trainer to add tasks for your panic attacks - There tend to be more DAD programs than programs that work with autistic adults and non-military psychiatric needs.

>is it even possible for it to serve two tasks

Yes, it is definitely possible to have tasks related to both of your needs! But see above - You may need to 'customize' your dog a bit on your own afterwards, lots of programs specialize in training one or two things (and get good at those things)."
service_dogs,fdhyjv1,t3_elhzs1,1578432503.0,">Because already they’re doing a few things that go against the ADA

The ADA does not apply to housing, so that's a moot point. The Fair Housing Act applies to housing, and would require you to request reasonable accommodation to have your assistance dog in your apartment with you. They are allowed to ask more questions than the ADA allows for public access.

>basically saying they have the right under the fair housing act to request medical information to why you need the SD

This is correct to an extent. If the disability is not obvious, they can require medical documentation that you have a disability, and information on how/why the dog is required due to that disability. They cannot require the name of your disability.

>The form also makes you write down what breed it is so they can approve you for one?

Probably for identification purposes of the dog. Not outside of the realm of reasonable questions.

>Next was they wanted proof he’s a certified SD.

HUD guidance makes clear that there is no registration or certification.

>I’m just worried if they try pulling something sketchy, is there some advice you guys can give me to watch out for?
