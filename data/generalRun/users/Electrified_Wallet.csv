OurPresident,ff87267,t3_erusrg,1579667835.0,I like Bernie but I still think a UBI would be the most direct and fast way to give millions of people a base to stand on. But knowing our luck we'll get Biden or Trump again.

TrueOffMyChest,ff25zw3,t3_er3gnf,1579494770.0,"Do not work at Starbucks. This happens daily. Over the years I've seen multiple supervisors and baristas walk out of the store just to cry. People are so fucking entitled and never had to work a shit job before so they treat us like garbage. People falsely believe that working at Starbucks must be a ""chill and hip"" job because it's become so popular. I've watched so many young people pick up smoking, lose sleep and develop anxiety attacks and depression within months of working here. 

Going a bit off topic but corporate is only concerned with profit so they continually add product (with no where to even put it all. We literally have so little counter space to even make drinks) and they cut labor so you often have to do the job of three people at once. It is a fucking nightmare. You'll be alone on bar with twenty people staring at you checking their watches, laughing, demanding you to make their drink first ahead of others, meanwhile more and more people are lining up to order this overpriced crap. Yeah just avoid these sorts of jobs if you like your mental and physical health."

ILTrees,fewt2mt,t3_eqqc4s,1579419076.0,You people are fucking nuts! The windchill is so bad out there to stand in line and get fucked by insanely overpriced product. Literally throwing money away. Weed is great but wait until the prices go down. If the majority continued to buy weed the old fashioned way at reasonable prices then these highway robberies wouldn't happen and they'd be forced to lower prices in order to compete.

TrueOffMyChest,fewpk65,t3_eqiiai,1579417576.0,"I fucking wish these jobs were destroyed and automated as quickly as possible. I know it provides us with a shitty income but it causes horrible mental and physical stress which is basically giving us depression and shortening our lives. It sucks so bad when you get stuck in it for years and watch young new hires also deteriorate over time just like you did. We need to end this nonsense. Humans should not be doing jobs like this. 

And don't listen to those morons who say that these jobs give us meaning. Lmao they clearly never worked a shit job."
