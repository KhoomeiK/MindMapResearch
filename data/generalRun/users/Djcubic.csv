Shattered in three pieces and scattered in three random planets of the galaxy, each sealed by three powerful magical doors that can only be open by keys (also scattered between random planets).

Why this much level of security? Because the Elementiaga holds the power to wake Essos, the god of all, who will grant you a miracle/wish. There won't be no bounds or limits to this wish and that's why the ICOE* protects it at all costs.

*Interplanetary Confraternity Of Espers, an alliance between all dominant species in the galaxy, all connected by the esper power (many but not all individuals of each species can be born with a power tied to an element or type of magic, some species can only be born with one type of esper power)."

worldbuilding,fexna61,t3_eqqtyo,1579433615.0,"Esperitia is a huge city on the floating continent of Lugonia, the city has its origins in Greece and therefore a lot of its colture comes from the greeks.

With this said, i was wondering what to add to the colture that could be unique to it and that didn't necessarily trace back to the greeks, so i went to Pinterest and searched for a bunch of random things and came across with lip-art. Essentially they were little flowers and plants painted on lips, i thought it was cool af and added it to Esperitian colture. Im still trying to figure out the purpose of all of this.

Apologies for my broken grammar, i just woke up and didn't feel like caring."

On Earth, Esperitian protection is vital since the planets hold one of the three pieces of a mass destruction weapon. While on other planets there really is no need for military. Of course it all depends on the political situation on those planets."
