Have you never seen your ballsack get tense when you're cold and relax when you're warm?"
AskReddit,fcmyjsg,t3_ei2gsw,1577797726.0,"Used a Razor that had a beard trimmer on the back if it. 
Caught my ballsack and sliced it pretty good.
Wouldn't stop bleeding since it was a super clean cut and my ballsack kept expanding and contracting. 

Yeah, sucked."
aww,fchk507,t1_fchhzpa,1577651213.0,"Most of mine get a variety of dark leafy greens, herbs and when they need a treat cactus steaks ""spines taken off ofc"" 
Also horn worms.

I feed many different bugs as a staple but none in bulk.

Silk worms, super worms, meal worms, crickets, dubia roaches/discoid roaches."
aww,fchh6mh,t1_fchgrm0,1577650424.0,"I explained why fruits arent a staple in another comment.
 
Short explanation, Humans made fruits too sugary so they cause parasite blooms."
aww,fcco2ph,t1_fccmu87,1577600629.0,"That dragon is not sick.

Even if it is, that's not a correct diet to feed to a sick dragon.

Too much water can cause kidney failure since they cant process it like humans do."
aww,fcbmcv9,t1_fcblr31,1577588519.0,"They honestly dont need them. 

Since humans bioengineer them to be sweeter they can cause parasite blooms.

I would feed cilantro or cactus before fruits.

For water if your beardie is dehydrated you could mist only the greens before putting them into the enclosure or offering a hornworm once a day."

aww,fcaw7rt,t1_fcavcpq,1577577829.0,"It's not the correct diet at all.
