\- The way you talk about your daughter "" while she plays games on her phone, reads or watches TV. "" makes out that she is of teenage age yet then say "" nowhere near big enough to somehow get up onto a bed or desk  "" Which makes the child of toddler age (though even toddlers can climb onto beds and chairs quite easily) or has some form of disability you have not mentioned maybe. 

\- Toddlers are not an easy gig to look after, specially when they are not your own yet you expect her to babysit for free, even after she said she doesn't want to. 

\- The child does not have to be drinking a drink in order to knock it over, or even be able to reach the drink either, just knocking the table or grabbing something else near by can cause this. Also children can spend their whole life refusing to eat/drink something and instantly say yes please and consume at someone elses house.
