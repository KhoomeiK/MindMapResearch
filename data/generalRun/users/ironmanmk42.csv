Cold weather - regen is very low because it is chemically difficult to get energy in and out of of cold batteries due to their inherent composition and properties. 

This means the car tends to not brake in time and you need to be careful and drive with foot on your brake as needed as the car coasts more, like a typical ICE car. 

Additionally the car also can easily lose traction and slide around/fishtail if the roads are slippery. Experienced it first hand a few times. 

All this is easily solvable by educating yourself on cars and driving slower and having enough separation to take corrective action. 

Still, having the car counterbalance itself would be great. Because humans tend to get influenced with one pedal driving and expect it and it is tough to change driving behavior from morning to evening (presumably the battery is preheated mornings so regen is close to normal/full opposed to evening as car was left outside in the cold)"

What makes movies great? When you can rewatch them and enjoy and most importantly recall dialogs.

I struggle to recall one movie where I can recall dialogs.

Closest is the Avengers movies but generally all superhero movies are just fast food. Eat and throw.

No permanence.

Edit : Inglorious Basterds was pretty good. ""it's a bingo"" etc."

Why did they not get it from whomever Brady was texting supposedly?

Also why should Brady turn personal content to them?

They could have asked his cell carrier too? Texts are backed up by them.

teslamotors,fepdvn2,t1_fennqx0,1579318087.0,"I drove 86 miles a day back and forth to work. 

That's about 86*22 days = 1900 miles / month

At about 240Whr/mile - actually lets make it a crazy 300 Whr/mile for winter.

So, at 300Whr/mile I use 570kW of electricity. 

At $0.13/kWhr cost of electricity, that is $75/month for charging the EV a month.

----

Lets consider my ICEV now. At 25mpg, it is $1900/25 = 76 gals of fuel. I filled premium but assuming cheapest gas of $2.50/gal, that is $190 of gasoline cost. 

===

EV = $75/month  (assuming worst case inefficiency). Assuming your double electricity cost, it's still $150/month. 

ICEV = $190/month (assuming most efficient). Assuming 30mpg car, it's still $160/month

----

This means EV is cheaper than ICEV however you look at it. Even assuming worst case. If you do more realistic case, EV is much much cheaper than gas. Savings are easily approaching $100/month ($1200/year = $7200/6 year loan agreed to).

> [My realistic case numbers are = 230Whr/mile for EV = $56/month. 25mpg highway ICEV filled at Premium $3.05 gas = $230/month. 
Savings/month because of EV = $230-$56 = $175/month. Per year = $2100/year. For 6 years = $12600 saved because of Tesla (not counting oil changes ~ $100, repairs of ~$500)] 

Your numbers are totally off. Either your car is super inefficient or you're just calculating/seeing it all wrong."
