Neglectful narcissism is so insidious and subtle and hard to explain to people on the outside. I feel like I'm making everything up for attention, no matter how many times I read about it and check almost every box in a list, or read comments telling me what I went through isn't right, I still think I'm a lying, attention seeking kid.

menstrualcups,fefw87y,t3_eow0qh,1579067222.0,"Please, before buying a cup, consider the fact that you have to do quite some research about different designs and brand before finding the perfect fit for you. You should consider your age, sexual history, blood flow and the depth of your vagina (or position of the cervix). For example, young women like you and I have tighter pelvic muscles, and older women (30+) or women that have had a baby have pelvic muscles that are a bit more flaccid. This means that younger women need firm cups and older women need squishy, flexible cups. If your cervix is high, a short cup will be uncomfortable to remove. If your cervix is low, A long cup won't even go in your vagina. If you have a heavy flow, buying a tiny cup means you'll have to take it off every couple hours to throw the blood away and avoid leaking. So consider all of this and take some time! Cups are expensive, make sure you don't waste yours. Assuming you are a virgin teen with with a regular flow and an average vagina, I'd advise you to look for a small, firm cup with an average sized body and a long stem."

I let my doctor know and asked her to take it slow. She rammed the speculum in with absolutely no regard for my condition. She didn't use ANY lube and said that it wasn't necessary. Needless to say, I cried and sobbed during the entire examination while she told me my problem is that I'm just too anxious. It was a terrible experience and hours later I still felt violated and disrespected. I don't think I've ever been so mistreated befoee.

But as I started cooking I realised I'm actually a really good cook! For me, all that it takes is following the recipe down to a T. Don't try anything, don't experiment. At least not yet, as you are a complete beginner. Pick a dish that is delicious and easy to make and just follow the recipe closely and you should be fine. Trust me, when you get that first recipe right, you're gonna get so excited and want to try even more! I managed to cook two dishes: a mousse and a box cake. Both were delicious. It's a huge progress for me since I was the type of person that couldn't even cook the bare minimum to survive. You should start out simple (less ingredients, less steps, less time in the kitchen) and keep progressing to more complex recipes, just like I'm doing. Your Nparents are probably going to discourage you. When I baked my first cake and happily told my mom everyone who had a slice loved it, she said ""It's just a box cake, no way you could get it wrong"". Funny thing is, her cakes are always hard and dense and mine was soft and delicious. I guess she was just jealous. Either way, don't let them discourage you! Have fun"

It was an emergency, he wasn't thinking about keeping his persona and his real personality shone through. Makes you think about what could've been. He would've matured and grown out of that, but didn't have enough time unfortunately."
ukulele,feaa7io,t3_eo7a65,1578946196.0,"You can use your thumb's pad, the nail on your index finger or a pick. I had some trouble with strumming in the beginning too cause I couldn't find a good technique that worked for me. I found strumming with my index finger is what does it. On your way down, use your nail. On the way up, use the index finger's pad"
Dogtraining,fe9ri86,t1_fe9ngc5,1578940881.0,"My dog actually loves people and is all over them once he gets to know them better. He's sweet and absolutely loves getting attention. The thing is, he needs to SMELL people first and then he absolutely calms down. If he can't do it, he just won't calm down and stop barking until they leave. My dog won't bite. He barks, runs over to the person, smells their feet and then instantly calms down. And the problem is that most people wouldn't like to have a dog bark and lunge at them, because they're scared of getting bitten. But you gave me an idea! What if I buy a crate and, when we have guests over, instead of locking him away in an isolated room, I keep him in the crate in the room where the guests are and have them interact with him a little bit. Do you think that would work? That way he can smell their hands, get treats and rubs and then once I think he's calm enough I can let him out!"

birthcontrol,fe6r0al,t1_fe6pi9z,1578901303.0,I now see it from a different perspective. That's nice of you to say. I guess I'm a bit distrustful of those tests because my mom is pregnant this year and she took three regular tests and one blood test. Two came negative and two came positive. She felt worse.
birthcontrol,fe6paf6,t1_fe6p0lj,1578899139.0,"Ugh, I know. I totally understand it, you're 100% right. But it's so difficult because buying a test and taking it would feel like I'm admitting to myself that I'm under a huge risk, you know? I guess I just want someone to convince me I'm gonna be okay."

When I visit him at his parent's house, he cooks for me, serves me. If I'm sick, he takes care of me. We're best friends, but in two years of sex I haven't cum once. Unfortunately though he tries, he just can't get it right. We're kind of at a loss now."
