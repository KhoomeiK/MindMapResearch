FYI, no, it isn't. ""Disapproving"" of gay marriage is the very definition of bigotry. It means that you believe that a certain group of people should not do something that everyone else is allowed to do, solely due to a characteristic that they have.

There's a podcast I listen to that frequently plays a game called ""Make it Black"", where they take instances of bigotry from the news and change the parties from gay (or whatever) to black, as a way to demonstrate the bigotry in the situation. In this case, they might rephrase your statement thusly:
