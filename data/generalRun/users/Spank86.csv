SOGEA lines have no dial tone on them and no conditions, other than digital hiss when they're working."
gadgets,ff99dsf,t1_ff9904e,1579707855.0,Depends if their phone is by BT or not then. Sonce they are the only company from the bakelite era and any phone ever produced will still work on their current lines (unless its an ex payphone line and pulse dialling has been disabled) and will continue to work even with the switch to voip.
gadgets,ff998mg,t1_ff992vo,1579707762.0,Sky are currently the only ones doing it with VDSL/Gfast. BT were going to move over to it but they've delayed it by a few months. Within 5 years all of them will be doing it. Dial tone is going in 2025.
gadgets,ff98ehv,t1_ff8vgk5,1579707226.0,"Yes, if theyre in the UK. If they move over to a data only service with no traditional voice, they could plug it into the back of their router and it would still get voice over their broadband."

Generally cables up to cabinets are ducted, after cabinets that varies. If you have to start digging especially on roads costs go up massively as does the time to complete."

With new staff and new managers? Or will it even exist. I'd make the jump assuming all seems good with the new job. More money, more opportunities and more education. Almost too good to be true tbh."

IAmA,fe98wso,t1_fe8iv3f,1578935467.0,Depends how far you live from the cabinet. Sounds like you're about 1.5km or more from yours. The other guys probably within 300m.

Fitness,fdkk1bo,t1_fdkjlg4,1578505259.0,"Everyones different. Sugar doesnt have a massive effect on me whether i eat it or not, some people it does, i assume he means hes cutting added sugars, fizzy drinks, sugar in processed foods etc, not trying to eradicate ALL sugars, and it will tend to make you feel crap until your body adjusts.

Tbh I guess it depends how much they were eating and what they're trying to achieve but for some people going cold turkey before reintroducing it is a good idea, for others it doesn't work."

I'm not saying they are the same, if they were the same we wouldn't need to compare them, I'm simply illustrating a similarity between certain of their attributes. Namely withdrawal symptoms.

At least ricky gervais has some redeeming festures.
