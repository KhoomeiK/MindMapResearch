DaveRamsey,ffeadfu,t1_ffe8dao,1579841164.0,At the very least you should be making a minimum payment even if you think it has a shot.
DaveRamsey,ffea4wr,t3_eszbxe,1579840957.0,"Gonna go against the grain here: 

I'm not banking on any candidate paying off my student loans. But it's become a part of enough DNC platforms, that depending on the result of the 2020 election, it may have a decent shot at becoming a reality. I dont agree with the policy, but I'd certainly be foolish not to take advantage of it.

I had to disengage off the pay down my student debt road a couple months ago because of some financial emergencies. Now that I'm back, I've decided to stick what I would be paying on student debt in savings until November is over. Then I can better assess if this has any chance at happening. If not, I just dump my savings into loans and continue on my day none the wiser."

WTF,ffe0kmp,t1_ffdj5mh,1579833587.0,Someone having a heart attack in Wuhan during the epidemic is probably still going to be treated by medical staff in protective suits.
worldnews,ffe0gre,t1_ffbswlu,1579833509.0,"Nobody is saying they're not. But there's nothing that's not already being done to keep them out of the risk group. That's not being heartless, that's just a fact of life."
Entrepreneur,ffe07dy,t1_ffcqv4b,1579833324.0,"MSPs offer a ongoing subscription rate based on their services. The average does $130 per month per end user/computer. The cream of the crop is doing $200 per month per end user/computer.

With that, you're basically their IT department and they'll call whenever any helpdesk issues come up.   


I'd recommend seeing if there's an MSP in the area that's looking for a helpdesk guy for a 2nd shift. You'll quickly get a good idea of what you can do."

WTF,ffdzddz,t1_ffdx1x4,1579832718.0,Redditors are so excited to ratchet up the tension about this without any actual facts backing them up.
WTF,ffdh70x,t1_ffdf97q,1579820788.0,"Part of me believes that this isnt coronavirus, and is actually something more serious like a heart attack. The treatment I've seen for Coronavirus right now is more akin to hunkering down for a shitty cold."

videos,ffd0zfv,t1_ffcvbnw,1579811275.0,"Yall are so high on the fear mongering. You know why outbreaks like this are met with slow infection stats and leaders saying ""We'll keep an eye on it?"" Because people love to irrationally panic.

This virus has only killed elderly people with underlying health issues thus far. The city it originated in is quarantined and people are required to wear masks. Airports began screening for infection from suspect flights as soon as they were aware. 

This isnt close to the Spanish Flu. Governments are paying attention to their medical leaders."

worldnews,ffbnc6q,t1_ffbj617,1579774007.0,I'd upvote this 100x if I could. Theres no need for panic like all the other comments are doing.
Entrepreneur,ffaqw09,t1_ff2uy7r,1579742377.0,"Implementing 365 licenses, servers, enterprise applications, redoing their infrastructure stack, plus more. If you ever get a small client base taken care of, then you jump on prevention, usually with security. Making sure everything is patched, email delivery is secure, all firmware on devices is up to date, ect.

Fully managing their systems is a 24/7 job. It should also aim to curtail break/fix issues, because you're on top of it."
