MadeMeSmile,ffjooin,t1_ffjajuu,1580003138.0,"My husband wasn't particularly demonstrative, either, but telling him I was pregnant is still one of my favorite memories. He didn't say anything; he just smiled the best smile I've ever seen, and hugged me tightly. 

So don't worry about having a certain mood or attitude. When it happens, the person who loves you will see your genuine reaction, regardless of how you express it."
blackmagicfuckery,ffiptgo,t1_ffio2js,1579979711.0,"You both have good points, and if you would stop butting heads and posturing for a moment, you'd realize you're both on the same page; just on different lines."
todayilearned,ffh9pjw,t1_ffh7ul6,1579927201.0,"A lot of people are freaked out by the idea of eating insects, but they are a wonderful source of protein, and they actually taste pretty good, as long as you know how to cook them right. Far less of a carbon footprint, too. I predict that in the future harvesting insects for protein will be a big deal. It already is in some countries, but I'm certain it's going to spread."
todayilearned,ffgk4zd,t1_ffgiy81,1579908083.0,"Unfortunately, those that are typically hit don't benefit. A trash bag full of locusts does not equate to several metric tons of grain."

insanepeoplefacebook,ff16ztr,t1_ff10sa2,1579475871.0,"People have shown, on numerous occasions, that you can either climb the wall in a few short minutes, are you can cut a hole through it with a saw in less than an hour. I don't think that's going to deter anyone who sufficiently motivated."
politics,fek8znu,t1_fek03ai,1579195104.0,So say we all.
politics,feeyui5,t1_fec53rm,1579044231.0,I meant in this current climate. Perhaps I spoke clumsily.
politics,feeq9ry,t1_fe8zgxf,1579038932.0,"Because he's the only one in the universe that matters. Everyone else is a commodity to be exploited at his whim. 

/s, but kinda not, because that's how malignant narcissists think."
politics,febx7ni,t1_fe986p4,1578963776.0,"Unfortunately, I'm certain that the non-white person and the not-male won't make it to the end. It doesn't matter how progressive their views are (although Warren is more middle of the road), it's just not going to work. I may be downvoted for this, but it's true that even the progressives aren't ready for a minority president. 

That being said, I'm all behind Bernie, and I hope he keeps to his word that his VP won't be 'an old, white man.' I like the idea of Warren as the vice president."

TooAfraidToAsk,fdqe34x,t1_fdp480s,1578664249.0,"Okay, so that made me cry."
PublicFreakout,fdokl31,t1_fdnu0mv,1578607026.0,"I thought you might be exaggerating, so I checked it out for myself. And holy hell."
Frasier,fdgxj2o,t1_fdfynbs,1578410769.0,I started to hate all of them.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fcwivmu,t1_fcwhday,1578026819.0,"I have two spots on my butt and right leg that I always assumed were birthmarks. I'm a very pale redhead, so the moderately darker spots are far more noticeable on me than most anyone else. They're just small pinkish-brown splotches, though, not super dark, and are far less in number than 6 CALS. It's probably just coincidence. I simply have a slightly lumpy, bowlegged body. The guys salivate. 

Thank you for the education! Seriously."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fcwf3c6,t1_fckfpq1,1578024000.0,"This kind of makes me wonder if I have a mild form of that. I'm prone to chronic headaches, my legs are a little bent, and I have quite a few small, almost cartilaginous bumps underneath my skin about the size of lima beans. 

Of course, my body could just be a little weird, and I'm reading far too much into it. It's kind of like going on to WebMD about a cold, and leaving the site convinced you have mega, super cancer."
