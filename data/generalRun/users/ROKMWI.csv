I wasn't thinking about the size so much, but yeah, could I get a lens with similar zoom (with similar image quality), also with similar pricing and similar size/weight?

EDIT: personally I'm not even working with FullFrame. I've got Sony A6300.

EDIT: also thought it was funny how I'm asking about quality similar to a point and shoot, and you link to a $120,000.00 lens..."

I don't see how that affects this in any way tbh."

I would guess that the quality of that point-and-shoot lens is so bad that lens manufacturers wouldn't want to make a similar one for mirrorless or dslr. But it still seems odd that nobody makes a similar lens. It seems to get decent results on the Nikon, so I would think that a similar lens on mirrorless should get decent results. Professionals obviously would never use it, but I would think amateur users would buy a cheap lens with that range and quality."

EDIT: to be clear, I am not asking about a 3000mm lens. I'm after any lens that would give me similar zoom to the P1000 with similar quality. I am fully aware that the image quality would not be as good as with professional level lenses, I am asking for similar quality to the P1000."

And I thought that the vikings would have been invading Denmark, as opposed to being from Denmark (that is to say I thought that the vikings could originate from Denmark, but be working against the state in a way). From the other reply I gather that the Vikings could have been working for the state, and the King of Denmark even presided over the British Isles."
