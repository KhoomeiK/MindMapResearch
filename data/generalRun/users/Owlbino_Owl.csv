Except this is learned through observing, but yeah they just see people pop up behind the door every time a ding is heard. I bet if someone changed their doorbell to sound unique and different from other doorbells then they'd mostly react to that sound than the normal ding."
dogs,fe0h8fs,t1_fe04s41,1578813402.0,Your dog could also associate the doorbell to guests or a stranger being nearby. My dog always freaks out over the doorbell because she wants to see the new guy. If she sees us ignore it then she'll calm down almost immediately.
dogs,fdzs22r,t1_fdzlcpj,1578794455.0,Loud and high pitched sounds tend to do that.
dogs,fdk3f0q,t1_fdjrfn5,1578495101.0,She likes dogs and puppies when we stop by for them to sniff each other. But I'm not sure if this will be the case when there's a puppy in the house 24/7.

And it might be because the older dog becomes more of a parental figure rather than a rival or a challenger. Kind of hard to consider a parental figure as an enemy, especially when they guide you. If that makes sense."
iranian,fdj9fty,t1_fddpli7,1578462310.0,I feel like at this point it's just opinion to whether he's a martyr or not. Different people have different moral codes. Whether he's a martyr or not can't really be justified when he made his fair share of heroic and villainous acts. He's not completely on one side of the spectrum.
iranian,fdj95xx,t1_fda4sxk,1578462066.0,"Realistically, I will never consider Soleimani as evil as America and their generals. All the US has done is get involved in wars they had no business being in, and literally killing hundreds of thousands. Their death toll just keeps rising.

The definition of martyr: someone being killed for their religious or other beliefs. 

Let's be honest, Trump has shown to strongly dislike muslims and Islamic Republics, to the point where it's racism. I genuinely believe that if Soleimani and Iran were swapped out with a non-islamic country and general, with similar history, Trump wouldn't have been as trigger happy. 

I'm willing to bet my life that Trump's hate fueled his assassination of Iran's general, Soleimani."

America has much more innocent blood on their hands than Iran as a whole. Your country has done nothing but bring death and despair. Soleimani and Iran crushed ISIS and kept Iraq safe while America twiddled their thumbs. Don't disregard their hard work with fake news. Most Americans are too lazy to fact check what their ""news"" outlets and mentally deranged president are telling them. 

The only criminal here is America and Trump. You have no right to call Soleimani and Iran criminals after America's act of terrorism."
iranian,fdj7aiu,t1_fcx6ogm,1578460464.0,"Why are you pretending that American generals also don't have blood on their hands? Have you forgotten the vietnam war? What about the Iraq war? Americans had no business in either of these countries and yet you invaded both anyway. Let's also not forget the fact that America bombed pearl harbor twice.

Soleimani isn't innocent of death but he's also been leading the fight versus ISIS. He's got noteworthy achievements under his belt and honestly you should research him from unbiased websites. He really isn't as bad as the media portrays him to be."
iranian,fdj6wlj,t1_fcye84y,1578460144.0,"Would you tell Americans to ""get over it"" after 9/11? This was an act of terrorism just like the twin towers; even though there's a significant difference in scale between the two, it doesn't change the fact that they're both terrorist attacks."
iranian,fdj6re9,t3_ejbs9g,1578460027.0,It's sad that Americans are calling him a terrorist when he lead the fight against ISIS successfully. If it wasn't for him and Iran then ISIS would've torn apart Iraq. Really depressing that Americans can't fact check before they parrot their mentally deranged leader's words.
iranian,fdj6mmv,t3_d7tbts,1578459919.0,"Trump is literally a terrorist now, so I wouldn't be surprised if he segregated all Iranians in America if a war broke out."
dogs,fdj6f0c,t3_ele34n,1578459746.0,"Start documenting these incidents and once you've gathered enough, take them to authorities. Also find a new place to live because once you report her you'll most likely get kicked out."
iranian,fdg5t4a,t3_ekpmi4,1578381184.0,My aunts and uncles are going to enlist into the military if there is a war. That terrifies me. Honestly I've never felt so much hate towards the US and Israel until now. I know its irrational anger but these past few days I just kept wishing that both these countries would just disappear for good.
