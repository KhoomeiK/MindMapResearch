She still needs to do the work, but I'd personally give a bit more leeway in this situation. Can you strongly encourage grief counseling?

I would probably say something like 'Baby is very vulnerable at the moment. Your mother put her at risk by not following the schedule/listening to me. She can't go into the NICU anymore.' and then let the nurses know. They can enforce it and you can put it out of your mind. Honestly visitors other than parents in the NICU is a privilege, not a right. NICU nurses have no time for people's crap, they are too busy.

In a normal situation I would be annoyed at your partner for not stepping up, but his baby's in NICU.
