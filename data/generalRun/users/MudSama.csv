pcgaming,fefsw0w,t1_fedcwhv,1579064198.0,"Common problem. I do this too. The best way to break it naturally is to find obstacles to move around and start with limited space, requiring you to rebuild sooner. Don't start at the obstacle, but start nearby and build into it immediately. You'll make good decisions at the time then you'll need to eminent domain some stuff and rebuild for efficiency, which sometimes means a highway right thru an old square neighborhood .

In Sim City games, lakes and mountains combined with smaller maps (never start on a large map). In Cliff Empire start in the middle of a cliff with angled edges (like obsidian?) and go straight for that angle. Other games have other variations, follow the same principles. Move to larger maps after you get your stride on rebuilding small ones a few times first."

DestinyTheGame,fdaxwnn,t1_fd80dmq,1578251675.0,"To exaggerate on the damage resistance one, you can pull a setup where picking up an orb of light (or breaking a shield) gives you a charge of light.  When your shield breaks, your charges are eaten to give you that damage reduction.  Assuming you still get killed before regenerating any HP, thats 19% more effective HP. If you have high regen and get some life back before the buff wears off, it's just more free HP.  It lasts 5 seconds for 1 charge.

You can make it so you get two charges of light in lieu of just one, so one orb of light pick up or shield broken gives you 10 second damage reduction buff, allowing you to get more out of that effective HP boost.  You can also bring that up to 13 or 16 seconds using mods to increase your max charges.  Also, your ally might run something where giving him a charge gives you a charge, which is still affected by that 2x charge modifier (so you'll just randomly get 2x when he does something).

The infinite ammo one, it's costly and arc, but special ammo kills when surrounded drop special ammo, sometimes in very high amounts.  Telesto can mean free ammo, allowing you to rock two special ammo weapons in a crucible, otherwise you can have infinite shotgun in Gambit and strikes. The same mod also allows titans to get infinite shoulder charges (if they have charges of light) in all subclasses with MK44 boot exotic, not just constrained to the arc tree with skullfort helm exotic.  Warlocks can do something similar and also get like 85% of their grenade energy back on grenade use (different mod)."
DestinyTheGame,fdav77a,t1_fd9mss7,1578250625.0,"They should make all gear work with any season mods, including exotics.  Or at least exotics."
DestinyTheGame,fdauewh,t3_ekd16r,1578250305.0,"Differing opinion here, they should take some time with balance. HOWEVER, that's not to say they shouldn't address other items.  They need to be addressing things like EDZ and Tower Obelisks being not functional 80% and 40% of the time, respectively.  There are lots of other such things that break and otherwise hinder the ability to even play the game as intended that need regular attention.

Onto balance, though the game doesn't have ladders and competitive modes, they don't want to shift a flavor of the week meta every other week.  Assuming there were ladders and PvP leagues, balances should take place between those leagues/seasons.  Every OP weapon, meta, or combo will almost always be countered, people need time to work out how.  Too many balance changes, you shift the meta and burn out players who can't keep up with a whole new scene destroying their rank every other week.  It takes time to allow these things to work themselves out, then make balance changes in a more rational way to aim towards a more perfect balance, rather than dramatically overpower something and overly nerf another thing.

Armor 2.0 sucks, but maybe there are things to learn from it yet.  For example, if they shifted a change for that in 2 weeks, they may have never considered seasonal slots on exotic gear, or those slots being able to accommodate any season mod, which are things that maybe they will consider now.  The idea for being able to reroll affinities might have been a consideration now that wasn't there before.  The idea for choosing/editing your stat allocation on masterworked armors might not have been considered but might now.

Things take time to get the best perspective. Though countering my own initial statement, some shit has definitely had enough time to figure itself out and needs to be addressed, like a whole heap of useless exotics."
DestinyTheGame,fdasiyt,t1_fdalgc0,1578249542.0,"Agreed.  The cash shop is a cash grab onto a paid-for game.

I also missed completing the iron banner quest because I don't have that much time and I didn't want to grind. Being on the same step as every other player sort of kills the fun.

The point is, you do miss things if you don't act. This game is all about act now or it's over. The grind to 100 (~206 for some) may be a little more lenient, but it is still another crunch. I only hit 67 last league myself, and missed things as a result."
