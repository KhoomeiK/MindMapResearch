EDIT: What's scary is reading all the misinformation in this comment thread. The propaganda has been so unbelievably strong the last 10 years, people are still entirely confused about an event that is **FULLY** understood. You could spend a few hours reading the total and exhaustive summaries of exactly what happened, who caused it, and what was created in the aftermath. Spectacular journalism was done on this subject. It's some of the most exhaustive reporting done on any subject so far in the 21st century. I'm surprised more journalists haven't gone postal trying to get people to shut off the garbage podcasts and prime time editorial bobble-heads and just read their fucking work."

Same applies to JoJo Rabbit, which averaged between 200 and 800 theaters for most of its run, but is now (like Parasite) expanded a bit because of Oscar noms.

Cats opened in **3500** theaters, and played in 3500 theaters for almost 2 weeks.

People need to start looking at distribution size (and marketing) when comparing box office performance. Cats is a spectacular failure BECAUSE it had so much distribution / marking backing while still failing miserably. It will likely have the same box office take as JoJo Rabbit...a movie with less than 1/4 the distribution size and anemic marketing."

Setting an Alien movie in a rainy, dark, drab, low contrast, hopeless  shithole prison - and spending the ENTIRE movie there, was a big mistake IMO. There's just no contrast anywhere. It makes for a difficult watch.

Lack of contrast also applies to most of the characters in the story. Virtually none of them are relatable, everything is absurdly serious (no surprise considering the setting), which also makes it difficult to watch or rewatch.

I've heard the recut fleshes out the characters more, but unless they also revised the setting to be more interesting, I doubt it's going be interesting or fun to watch it again.

The original Alien does a great job of taking a very sterile setting and using contrast (i.e. shadowless bright white eating quarters, med bay & sleep pod room) to break up mood, accent gore, and help break suspense. The 3rd film needed this kind of smart directing / production design. Also surprising, 'cause Fincher was exceptionally good at doing this with Se7en only a couple years later.
