I was under the impression the host would be female and that there would be other guests staying there but the only person there was a drunk man. My door didn't have a lock on it either. I just hit him with my bag and ran. 

Hmmm, I'm white so I'm not sure! I noticed a weird trend that people would glare at me right in my eyes and I'd look at them then eventually wave or ask what was up and they seemed almost confused or angry that I acknowledged their staring? Like it somehow didn't make sense for someone you're staring at to ask why you're staring at them? haha"

casualiama,ffeaqj4,t1_ffeaijw,1579841481.0,"I've had panic attacks too. I had no idea what it was the first time, just that I wanted to... run away, jump out of my skin, scream hide, cry, and have someone hug me all at the same time, but I could just sit still with my eyes wide. I feel like the moment you realize you have an anxiety disorder and that treatment exists and it's not just a thing you'll have to deal with is a big step! 

I hope therapy helps you a lot, my first time going I imagined some eye-opening moment walking out the first day like I was reborn (lol) but it was definitely a more subtle difference that took personal effort. But starting is literally the biggest step so in comparison it's smooth sailing from here. :)"

morbidquestions,ffdlpl3,t1_ffdkuh9,1579823545.0,"Yeah like, I had a conversation with a friend recently about how we both have vivid nightmares about committing incest with various family members and wake up wanting to just crawl out of our skin and die, I have disturbing dreams that bother me all day and have definitely thought during Psych 101 when I read more about dream theory ""OH GOD WHAT IF THIS MEANS I WANT TO DO THIS DEEP DOWN"""
morbidquestions,ffdl2fx,t1_ffcflse,1579823151.0,"Also true, I honestly don't think this would have much of an effect on actual sexual abuse statistics because abusing children sexually would have so much more to do with power imbalance, a lack of morality and empathy towards others, an ability to manipulate and get close to vulnerable people, etc. than being attracted to children. 

&#x200B;

Of course I don't think pedophiles should be around children whatsoever but this made me think, honestly if we executed all the pedophiles how much of an effect would that REALLY have? With the extreme number of people who commit sexual assault against children I feel like a large percentage of them don't even have this deep seeded attraction to children or the self awareness to recognize their problem and seek help/out themselves.  

&#x200B;

I feel like it's kind of like the ""not all murderers are mentally ill"" concept. It's hard to just say ""people do x because they have this clearly defined issue"""
morbidquestions,ffdkkyv,t1_ffc7l0i,1579822852.0,"Also, it makes me think of how many people with extreme intrusive thoughts due to OCD would mistake themselves as pedophiles. It's very common for people to have intrusive thoughts about the darkest, most depraved things possible and obsess over how horrible they feel about it. This definitely does not make a person a pedophile. Intrusive thoughts regarding sexual abuse, violence, incest, suicide etc are all common among these people and many of them feel extreme distress over it and I could see them honestly thinking that's really who they are. It's a tough subject. 

&#x200B;

For example, unrelated to pedophilia obviously but I was a caretaker for my elderly grandmother for years and would have horrific intrusive thoughts about harming her, it was stemming from obsessive anxious thoughts that I wasn't taking care of her well enough or that I'd miss something or she'd get hurt while I was sleeping or something like that. Obviously I was not ACTUALLY wanting to hurt her (I've never been violent towards anyone), but I felt extreme distress and questioned myself a lot before I realized how severe my anxiety was and learned coping skills. I imagine sexual intrusive thoughts are even more disturbing."

travel,ffd8env,t1_ffd3mcx,1579815431.0,"Right? For example when I was in Italy holy shit people were SO rude to me. I got stares bordering on disgust, people laughing at me and pointing right in my face, getting yelled at every which way, I was attacked by my AirBNB host... but like, that was my isolated experience in a country where millions of people visit yearly, I'm not going to tell people ""no don't go to Italy people are so rude!"""
travel,ffd843s,t1_ffcqfin,1579815264.0,"My thought exactly was that I've heard lots of stereotypes that American's are overly talkative and outgoing. I live in the South and wow. The amount of times I have had heart to hearts with strangers is pretty mindblowing, lol"
travel,ffd80z9,t1_ffc1kab,1579815214.0,"Wow, that's crazy, I have lots of very friendly interactions with people every day (I'm in Florida). However, any international trip I've been on I was met with lots of dirty looks, scoffing, being pushed out of the way, etc. Not that I really mind, I'm pretty in my own world, but I've never heard someone describe a part of America that way, maybe unless you're in a large city or around a certain type of people? I've grown up in the South but been all over, but especially in the South people are... almost too nice. I have in depth heartfelt conversations with strangers surprisingly often. Something I always like coming home to is feeling like I can approach anyone."
solotravel,ff5nvxy,t3_erkut0,1579602378.0,"Same. Especially since I solo travel as a young woman who had a traumatic experience my first time solo/out of the country, I generally like places where a lot of people travel that are very easily accessible aka foolproof. Not sure when I'll get ""adventurous"" enough to go to places no one has heard of, hitchhike, couchsurf, go without a plan, etc if ever!"
BPD,ff5ntu8,t1_ff5cigx,1579602290.0,was gonna say- having an FP I think is just a common thing a lot of people with BPD may or may not experience and Tumblr just coined a term for it b/c usually you'd assume it were a romantic partner or whatever
BPD,ff5jwoy,t3_erfsk6,1579596382.0,The feeling of being unwanted (and unwant-able) is at the core of a lot of my trauma and self loathing personally. Somewhere inside me the child that felt hated and mocked by everyone she came across is still crying out to be understood.

depression,fenfwfb,t3_epvzb0,1579283819.0,It's honestly hard for me to comprehend that other people have experienced mental illness to the point I have.

Again I am a huge fan of Emily and I'm interested in cosmetic surgery so not judging, it's just an unrealistic standard if people think it's natural :) taking fat out of the waist and putting it into the butt/hips/boobs is common"

Being alone isn't always bad, and you're right about your mom, she seems really sweet. Maybe you two could have a fun day together!

I grew up really poor and my family has never left our county let alone state or country in my entire life so I always wanted to travel as soon as I was old enough.

I just booked the flight like 6 months in advance and saved up a lot and did everything really cheap.

BPD,fdcr5vf,t3_ekmnsz,1578282002.0,"I can see why it'd be a common trend for us. For me, I'm extremely hyper-sensitive to where even neutral responses might leave me panicking, I overshare a lot,  I'm way too...eager for most people, I overthink things, I have a really erratic schedule so planning things with me can be kind of difficult, my point of view changes really often but during a 'phase' of any kind it really feels concrete to me, I need way more alone time than most people then have sudden moments where I want to hang out with someone for days at a time, when something upsets me I get so hurt or anxious that I have to just run away, I will literally run out of a room and peel out in my car after an awkward moment and not look at my phone all day if I'm really chaotic at the time... I could go on! Lol. I feel like we're all probably relatively awkward in various ways."

depression,fdcq713,t3_ek3uky,1578281284.0,"Jesus Christ that is insanely disturbing. I can't even imagine how you might feel right now my stomach literally churned when I read this. I just want you to know, when I had something similar happen to me I felt like every time I got depressed about it I was being childish/weak, NO, this is a huge betrayal and any feelings you may feel right now are valid. I know being cheated on and betrayed by a friend can hurt your self-worth deeply but I really hope you understand that this does not reflect on you AT ALL. Those are the actions of two severely fucked up people that completely lack empathy. Good riddance, I'm sorry you're losing two people you cared about at once man that is seriously bullshit. We're all here for you! You deserve so much better and tbh being single is loads better than being with a person like her, I'm sure you're leagues better of a person than she is.

For what it's worth so you know you're not alone, my best friend who I let live with me for free and spent every day with for years sought out an older man who sexually assaulted me as a preteen after I told her the story and got into a (short) relationship with him. I ran into them together and the feeling of seeing my best friend in the world making out with my rapist sent me into possibly the worst spiral of my life. The lengths people will go to for sex/attention are unbelievable to me. But now when I look back I think of how awful they both are (obviously I knew that about the guy but yknow) and fuck it I guess they deserve each other. If a best friend can be 'stolen' just because they wanted to get laid, FUCK THEM."
