I 100% believe that this is how they intended it."
Ask_Politics,ffhktil,t1_ffh1hj2,1579939937.0,You didn't understand. It called welfare trap I believe. Meaning if you get a job you will lose more in welfare than you gain in salary.
Ask_Politics,ffeqq6g,t3_et65az,1579860801.0,"Welfare system is keeping people perpetually poor. Means testing inevitably creates an optimum income that you should stay at to maximize profit. It also makes everybody hate the government. Poor people hate it for its tendency to be arbitrary and for the huge hassle it is to get any money out of it. And rich people hate it for not giving them money ""for nothing""."
BasicIncome,ffep7ut,t3_esy7f4,1579858503.0,I see UBI the same way I see social healthcare and schools. They all make the country a better place to live in. And to me that's worth every penny.

atheism,fdpupwa,t1_fdpoasd,1578641265.0,While I agree somewhat. Its hard to give kids rights while they are in the care of their parents and depend on them. Legal rights don't mean shit if the kid cant act on it.

SandersForPresident,fdn6m10,t1_fdn1uqt,1578578711.0,"Thanks for responding. I did the math. Ten years with one percent should make it 66 277.  With five percent it gets close to 100 000.

The reason it felt outrageus is that its your own government doing it, and education is one of the best ways a country can improve..

Here in the nordics there is no other loan that you can get cheaper than a student loan. Its like 0,5 %. I feel sorry even bothering you about this."

Ask_Politics,fdmoflp,t1_fdmjncy,1578558000.0,Atleast you should be able to declare bankruptcy for it as with any other loan. Why can we forgive someone for buying an expensive car and not for educating themselves?

AdviceAnimals,fdgc6hb,t1_fdfv55z,1578389614.0,I would say occupation is definitely wartime. You are controlling another country with military force.

I dont see why it should be taxed less."

For example, Finland is very cost effective in what we use our money on. Healthcare is a majority of our budget, but per capita we use much less than privatised healthcare systems.

I would say we even need to spend more money. This age of cutting down on everything (austerity), especially the taxes on the rich, is showing to be working only towards the next class war."
