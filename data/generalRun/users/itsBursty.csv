If I create something (we can all agree a cellphone video is original content) how much do you *own* that video? Did you license it? Copyright? What's in the video, any products you *don't* own? If you film me, do you have my consent? It might be your video but it's my behaviour. Did you create the device? Did you upload it and if so where? How did you upload it, surely using the internet right, so does the government or your isp own a part of the content?

FragileWhiteRedditor,fggwcne,t1_fgepso0,1580771026.0,"The problem is how do you know? Who will decide? I'm sure you're aware white nationalists new wave is all about tone and civility in the public sphere, and the most dangerous of them have positions of power. It has nothing to do with winning white nationalists over, it's about winning over the centrists who think the white nationalists aren't so bad, who think you're the problem for being so radical, the people who voted for Obama in 2012 and Trump in 2016. 

We have to engage on a whole other front, like Bernie has been doing. Don't ""attack"" the racists, defend the worker. Defend labour. Defend the working class. Just like in the civil war, the elite class have pitted us against each other. Centrists see your behavior as extreme when you say an undefined group of people are subhuman. 

Just to be clear, I completely agree with you. The trouble comes when asked to define the group, to define a white nationalist. There was a post recently about a billboard saying ""Nazi lives don't matter"" and I was fully behind that statement because there are literal neo-nazis and neo-fascists who self-identify as Nazis. In regards to the billboard, that's who I'm talking about, the people who call themselves nazis. But even white nationalists call *those* people extreme in order to keep centrist support. 

Lets not miss the forest for the trees. I would prefer Americans not to be racist at all but it's at least better if they support policy that benefits marginalized people. This is basically the inverse of racists in power; they don't care if their supporters are actually white nationalists so long as they support them.

Obviously none of this is ideal, but we need solidarity."

I acknowledge that my views may seem pretty far left to some people, but I think this is due to the Overton window shifting to the right. 

Despite all that, I see a fundamental difference between Reps and Dems in the sense that Reps have so much influence comparatively that even liberals have to appeal to Rep constituents. Obama was called a *socialist*, Hillary is painted to be the literal devil, I just don't see that happening on the other side. Fox news has more viewers than the top 2 left media channels.

Now back to the ~~butt~~ point, all guys can cum from their prostate. It can be stimulated, albeit weakly, from the outside. The comparison for women is like penetrative orgasms vs clitoral in terms of intensity, but I personally think it's more about being comfortable with your own body as a man. I've been with women who've said the sex is always better when they're comfortable. I think this means a clean house/bed/partner, sure, but also comfortable with their partner's desires and perception of them. If you think your partner is very judgmental, for instance, maybe you don't open up as much, just as one example of what I mean.
