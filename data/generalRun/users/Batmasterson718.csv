PoliticalHumor,feem3je,t1_feekmxg,1579036519.0,"Article doesn’t mention that Bernie was the harasser. 

Not letting him off the hook for unequal pay, or allowing this type of shit to go unpunished in his own campaign. 

But saying Bernie was the sexual harasser and using that article as proof is utter garbage."
eagles,fdhqms7,t3_elgx48,1578428250.0,"So, you’re saying that early in the season, the eagles should basically bench Wentz to give Sudfeld some snaps? Should Sudfeld be brought back as the backup. 

NFL teams don’t do that sort of thing. You put the best combination of players you can on the field to win a game. I’m all for the eagles bringing in a more veteran player as a backup qb, as an insurance policy. But Kapernick ain’t it. And I suspect Sudfeld might be too expensive as a free agent this year. 

As a wise man once said (slightly adjusted for eagles) “if 11 goes down we’re fucked, and we don’t practice fucked”"

First sentence of the second paragraph “here’s the thing though: once those mediocre division winners get to the playoffs, they often play like anything but.”"
