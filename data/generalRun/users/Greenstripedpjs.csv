IAmA,ff475f2,t3_erek2q,1579557011.0,"How would you deal with allergies that seem to run in families? I.e. I have a few oral allergies and one of them seems to affect my son (kiwi). Pineapple also gives me stomach cramps and makes him vomit (not psychological, he was sick with juice a few months ago and didn't look at the ingredients before drinking because he's eight). I have a few other oral allergies and obviously I'm worried that he will eventually inherit them."

NoStupidQuestions,ff2r12f,t3_er1vm8,1579520196.0,"I refuse to answer calls that aren't local or known to me. I'll only answer private numbers if I'm waiting on a call from someone who calls from one (my kids health visitor calls from one).

I changed my number a good few years ago, and since then I've had phonecalls left right and centre for a man who I'm assuming a) had my number before I did, b) has a similar number to mine and has changed the last digit, or c) has made up a number, memorised it, then given it out to anyone he doesn't want to hear from.

I've had calls from satellite providers demanding money, I've had people try and sell me stuff, I've had scammers, I've had insurance, I've had people who won't even tell me who they are...

So I refuse to answer. Or if I do answer, I ask them straight off who they're looking for. If it's this man I'll ask them if I sound like a *middle aged male name*. If they won't tell me, or answer ""I'm looking for you"" I'll tell them that I will hear them out if they can tell me my name. They usually hang up after that."

AskReddit,feuoep6,t3_eq9k9o,1579388449.0,"I've seen a couple in festivals that weren't that great.

Wheatus - the crowd knew one song and that was Teenage Dirtbag. They played the intro to that about five times before launching into another song. No one was happy.

Girls Aloud - was around 03-04 and they were playing a big pop festival near me. They took the totally ridiculous decision to have two of them sing live and the other three lip sync. The ones that sung live were horrendously out of tune and the other three sounded perfect but quiet."

It's like a poor man's YouTube where you play music videos but they're only on set playlists and it's completely random. It has a kids section and it rotates between Can't Stop The Feeling, Happy, that Shakira song from Zootropolis and Kidz Bop.

One evening I was working (community carer) and was hungry. I was near said supermarket and bought one of these bags to eat in the car. Got back to my car and tore open the bag and it was glorious! So. Much. Meat.

Then I looked up to see the person in the next cat staring at me. Then I noticed that said car had a PETA sign on it.

Ah well, their problem not mine."

NoStupidQuestions,fdyn9oz,t3_end9ge,1578781634.0,"You're not meant to park in front of a dropped kerb either (generally where someone has a driveway) because common sense.

But generally in residential areas there are no real regulations (again common sense, don't park in a stupid place where you're likely to get hit and don't block the road).

In built up areas there are commonly double yellow and single yellow lines, parking spaces are outlined and there are signs pretty much everywhere saying where you can park, how long for, whether you have to pay or not, and how long you have to stay away for before you can return to the same street/area.

There can also be some restrictions on when you can't park in certain places, e.g. outside a school at opening and closing time."

AskReddit,fdyh179,t1_fdyfg2x,1578779676.0,"There is Irn Bru, Diet Irn Bru and Irn Bru Xtra (the differences are like Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Max). There are also two In Bru energy drinks now, a full sugar one and a diet one.


 There was a limited edition Christmassy Irn Bru (which had ginger added) and Irn Bru 1901, (which tastes more like the full sugar one used to before they added sweeteners and took out some of the sugar).

There used to be, years ago, Irn Bru 32, which was an energy drink but doesn't taste like the new energy drink, and Firey Irn Bru, which was basically Irn Bru and Firey Ginger Beer.

Also used to be Irn Bru chew bars."
