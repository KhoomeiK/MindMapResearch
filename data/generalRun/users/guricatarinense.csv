We are not 56th cousins :( 

But I did find the French part is right.

Doing some study and averaging the calculators , plus from known family history it ended up my Iberian side had south french admixture and my Germanic side had north french admixture.

Ironically I'm mostly French lol."

I was pretty sure I would be like 80%. My grandma and one uncle have almost brown skin, like too brown for regular Iberian, so I thought like 10% African which is pretty normal among white Brazilians (not so much from my state, but still).

The only explanation I can find is that 1.5% Yemen Jew having some truth and not being just noise."

My mothers side was always  has been a mystery to me, but I expected the regular Iberia/Native/Africa mix + 50% Germanic from my dad (his parents were ethinic germans).

Im kind shocked theres not Africa and my german side was pulverized between many countries and for my complete surprise theres more to the European side of my mother than I could ever imagined.

Also, wtf yemen jew??? Although my grandma from my mothers side does indeed have some semitic features."

O que o cara ia fazer? Separar da vagabunda e ficar com dozinho da filha do carteiro e visitar ela de vez em quando? Representação máxima da traição?

Now imagine, a single egg of sperm being the  result of no meiosis is already rare, not that having to happen to the both of them two times! O

That's gotta be a chance in some billion.

The other way, as in 2 eggs and 2 sperm cells with the same random array of chromosomes generating a embryo is also extremely unlikely..

If I'm gonna guess that never happened in the entire history of mankind,  BUT is possible, just unbelievable unlikely.

Edit: Also keep in mind from the circa 1 million eggs a female is born with, she will only release 400 or so. 

So, you not only gotta have two eggs with the same chromosomal structure of those one million, you gotta hope she will realese the two of them during her fertile life AND be fecunded by the sperm cell with also the same chromosomal structure from the first pregnancy.

I'll correct and say the chance of it happening is one in some trillion."
