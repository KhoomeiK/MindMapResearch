AskReddit,fffpdrl,t1_fffmq2c,1579888907.0,Even just regular boredom and ingenuity. The kind of shit people in the military whip up in the middle of nowhere with nothing but the same few ingredients is impressive. You learn to get creative when supplies are limited. Shit anyone that's had to stretch $10 to make a week's worth of meals can tell you how creative they got just so they didn't have to eat plain rice for 3 meals a day.

I don't give a crap that dude was killed, he's a horrible person and dangerous terrorist. From what I understand he was called to Iraq for negotiations and then assassinated. It seriously lessens peaceful negotiation tactics in the future if anyone unfriendly with the US knows they'll immediately get drone striked when they're on their way to the table. 

Other people apparently have issues with a lack of congressional approval, but as far as that goes I honestly have no idea what needs to be approved by Congress and how much they need to be in the loop when it comes to operations like this."

eagles,fduwacj,t1_fds6fci,1578739917.0,I'm not sure the answer but it's definitely part of the problem. Remember Wentz playing with a broken back?
