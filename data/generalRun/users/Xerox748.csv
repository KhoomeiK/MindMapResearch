EDH,ffhajsl,t1_ffh9xgw,1579927965.0,And did anyone give you shit about it? Say you were cheating? Or did no one care? Iím guessing no one cares. Try that with Tabernacle and it might be a different story.
EDH,ffhaffw,t1_ffh854p,1579927856.0,You get my point though. No one takes issue with proxies of basic lands. They take issue with proxies when they change the power level of a deck.
EDH,ffh6qk5,t3_etk77n,1579924660.0,"So, in my experience the most often reason people take issue with proxies, isnít really about the proxies themselves, but rather the power level imbalance people create with them.

Letís be honest, no one proxies basic lands. No one would say a thing if someone did, other than maybe a friendly heckle. No, people are putting in proxies for OG Duals, Gaeaís Cradle, etc. People proxy cards that are powerful and as such, expensive.

Itís not great when youíre playing a game and 3/4 people are playing at about the same level and then one player starts dropping in a Cradle, Mox Diamond, Timetwister, etc. itís not great.

Add to that situation that the player whoís playing all these powerful cards doesnít even own them and is just using a computer print off of the cards and it starts to feel like their cheating to get ahead.

That being said, personally, I wouldnít really care that much, but most of my decks are about as optimized as you can get without delving into straight cEDH territory. So if someone wants to proxy a cradle, Iíll feel like itís a more evenly matched game. But if I was running my 1 intentionally bad deck, matching everyone else at the table, and someone started dropping OP cards that arenít even the real cards, Iíd feel a little iffy about it."

todayilearned,ff7t63r,t1_ff7b3hc,1579657748.0,"Right. Their argument boils down to:

Itís a nonsensical argument.

Also, again, this completely ignores the fact that the DA checked out *ALL* the evidence from the police evidence locker, walked it over to court, and submitted everything *except* the evidence that exonerated him, which conveniently just vanished into thin air.

todayilearned,ff71z8j,t1_ff6jsxa,1579639519.0,"That and the thousands of other cases of wrongful convictions, and executions.

You want a really fucked up case look up 2011ís Supreme Court ruling Connick v. Thompson.

The tl:dr is basically that the DAís office convicted this guy of murder, had multiple pieces of evidence the whole time proving that he was innocent, and not only did they not disclose that, which theyíre required to do by law (called the Brady Rule), they actually disposed of some of it. Hid the evidence that exonerated him, and prosecuted him based on the circumstantial evidence that they could use to make their case.

He spent 18 years in prison, 14 on death row, almost executed, until his lawyers uncovered proof that the DA had evidence that exonerated him. He got out. Sued. Jury awarded $12 million. DAís office appealed, appellate court upheld lower courts ruling so the DAís office appealed it to the Supreme Court.

Are you ready for the kicker? The Supreme Court struck down the lower courts ruling in a 5/4 decision, saying the DA wasnít responsible. That there wasnít a reasonable expectation that the DAís office should have known what they were doing was wrong, and that they were required to turn over the evidence that exonerated Thompson. *Even though* Thompson had shown there had been 4 convictions overturned before his case for the same violations, where the same DAís office hid evidence that exonerated the people they were prosecuting.

The conservatives on the supreme court argued that because in Thompsonís case it was specifically blood evidence the DA was hiding, and in those other 4 cases it wasnít ìbloodî evidence, just regular evidence, that it was unreasonable to expect the DAís office to know they were doing wrong by hiding evidence that exonerated him. 

Yeah, it really is as stupid an argument as it sounds. They conveniently ignored the little detail that the DA checked out all the evidence from the police station, walked it over to the court, and submitted everything they checked out *except* the pieces of evidence proving his innocence, which just magically disappeared.

So in the end, Thompson, an innocent man spent 18 years in prison, 14 on death row, was almost killed, and the conservatives on the Supreme Court said, ìtough shit. You donít get a dimeî. There were no repercussions for anyone in the DAís office who essentially got away with attempted murder."

Iím not sure why thereís this war against comparing. Comparing one to another is a great way to illustrate a point.

Iím not equating the two. Iím not elevating the bullyís actions to the actions of Bin Laden.

Iím using Bin Laden as a reference, someone most people would know of, and agree that there would be celebration upon learning of him developing cancer. Much in the same way there was celebration upon his death. Bin Ladenís purpose in the discussion is to establish universal agreement that there are situations where celebrating someone getting cancer is a reasonable response, or at least an understandable one.

Using that as a reference point, we can then turn to OPís bully. Someone no one other than OP knew, and whoís actions are unknown beyond the ambiguous ìbullyingî which can range from name calling to physical and sexual assault.

Since we donít know what he did, or how devastating the experience may have been to OP, itís hard to say wether or not celebrating the news of the Bully getting cancer would be a reasonable response. But because of our reference point, we can at least say that there are situations where it would be reasonable.

Obviously OPís bully isnít responsible for the deaths of thousands of people, heís not Bin Laden. Obviously if the bully had called OP fat one single time, it would be unreasonable to celebrate the Bully getting cancer. But somewhere between those extremes is the line where it is okay to celebrate.

I donít know where that line is, itís probably a very subjective line that depends on the person, and the situation. At what point do allow OP to celebrate? Does he have to be physically assaulted, or is one punch not enough? What if he held OPs head in the toilet until he almost drowned and developed pneumonia? Is that enough? How about if he forcibly sodomized OP with a broom handle?

All we know is that for two whole years this bully made OPís life miserable. Maybe it wasnít enough to warrant celebrating a cancer diagnosis, maybe it was.

Mostly welding, with some construction, farming, and auto work thrown in. He always talks about how glad he is to be out of that life and doing the work we do.

The thing about many of those jobs that he really rails against is how brutal they are on your body. Welding payed so much better than what heís doing now, but at the end of the day he was physically exhausted. And then he had to wake up the next morning and do it again. Our current work can get kind of sedentary at times, but he can and does go to the gym to counteract that. Thereís no anti-gym to alleviate the daily wear and tear on your body that more physically demanding labor does. He talks about how glad he is to be out because of the high burn out rates too. People he knew worked themselves too hard or even just working a regular amount, would throw their back, or their knee and thatís it, one way or another it wasnít long before they didnít have a job, and had a hard time finding a new one, especially a new one that paid decently. And to have just a major physical breakdown as young as some of these people are, means their later years are going to be even harder than the average elder.

I have a close friend whoís brother had that happen. He made decent money working a warehouse but after a few years he needed spine surgery and couldnít work anymore. Heís lucky that it happened after Obamacare so the medical bills didnít bankrupt him, and heís young enough that itís relatively easy to go back to school. But if he didnít have insurance, and had been 5-10 years older, his life would completely fucked.

No one should be ashamed of blue collar work, but I hesitate to say ìthereís nothing wrongî with those jobs. Thereís a serious problem with the physical toll on the bodies of people who work many of them, and at least here in America, when their bodies are broken, society largely casts these people aside, and doesnít provide a decent path to alternative careers with adequate earnings.

todayilearned,ff71z8j,t1_ff6jsxa,1579639519.0,"That and the thousands of other cases of wrongful convictions, and executions.

You want a really fucked up case look up 2011‚Äôs Supreme Court ruling Connick v. Thompson.

The tl:dr is basically that the DA‚Äôs office convicted this guy of murder, had multiple pieces of evidence the whole time proving that he was innocent, and not only did they not disclose that, which they‚Äôre required to do by law (called the Brady Rule), they actually disposed of some of it. Hid the evidence that exonerated him, and prosecuted him based on the circumstantial evidence that they could use to make their case.

He spent 18 years in prison, 14 on death row, almost executed, until his lawyers uncovered proof that the DA had evidence that exonerated him. He got out. Sued. Jury awarded $12 million. DA‚Äôs office appealed, appellate court upheld lower courts ruling so the DA‚Äôs office appealed it to the Supreme Court.

Are you ready for the kicker? The Supreme Court struck down the lower courts ruling in a 5/4 decision, saying the DA wasn‚Äôt responsible. That there wasn‚Äôt a reasonable expectation that the DA‚Äôs office should have known what they were doing was wrong, and that they were required to turn over the evidence that exonerated Thompson. *Even though* Thompson had shown there had been 4 convictions overturned before his case for the same violations, where the same DA‚Äôs office hid evidence that exonerated the people they were prosecuting.

The conservatives on the supreme court argued that because in Thompson‚Äôs case it was specifically blood evidence the DA was hiding, and in those other 4 cases it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúblood‚Äù evidence, just regular evidence, that it was unreasonable to expect the DA‚Äôs office to know they were doing wrong by hiding evidence that exonerated him. 

Yeah, it really is as stupid an argument as it sounds. They conveniently ignored the little detail that the DA checked out all the evidence from the police station, walked it over to the court, and submitted everything they checked out *except* the pieces of evidence proving his innocence, which just magically disappeared.

So in the end, Thompson, an innocent man spent 18 years in prison, 14 on death row, was almost killed, and the conservatives on the Supreme Court said, ‚Äútough shit. You don‚Äôt get a dime‚Äù. There were no repercussions for anyone in the DA‚Äôs office who essentially got away with attempted murder."

Bin Laden‚Äôs purpose in the discussion is to establish universal agreement that there are situations where celebrating someone getting cancer is a reasonable response, or at least an understandable one.

Using that as a reference point, we can then turn to OP‚Äôs bully. Someone no one other than OP knew, and who‚Äôs actions are unknown beyond the ambiguous ‚Äúbullying‚Äù which can range from name calling to physical and sexual assault.

Since we don‚Äôt know what he did, or how devastating the experience may have been to OP, it‚Äôs hard to say wether or not celebrating the news of the Bully getting cancer would be a reasonable response. But because of our reference point, we can at least say that there are situations where it would be reasonable.

Obviously OP‚Äôs bully isn‚Äôt responsible for the deaths of thousands of people, he‚Äôs not Bin Laden.

How about if he forcibly sodomized OP with a broom handle?

All we know is that for two whole years this bully made OP‚Äôs life miserable. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt enough to warrant celebrating a cancer diagnosis, maybe it was.

Mostly welding, with some construction, farming, and auto work thrown in. He always talks about how glad he is to be out of that life and doing the work we do.

The thing about many of those jobs that he really rails against is how brutal they are on your body. Welding payed so much better than what he‚Äôs doing now, but at the end of the day he was physically exhausted. And then he had to wake up the next morning and do it again. Our current work can get kind of sedentary at times, but he can and does go to the gym to counteract that. There‚Äôs no anti-gym to alleviate the daily wear and tear on your body that more physically demanding labor does. He talks about how glad he is to be out because of the high burn out rates too. People he knew worked themselves too hard or even just working a regular amount, would throw their back, or their knee and that‚Äôs it, one way or another it wasn‚Äôt long before they didn‚Äôt have a job, and had a hard time finding a new one, especially a new one that paid decently. And to have just a major physical breakdown as young as some of these people are, means their later years are going to be even harder than the average elder.

I have a close friend who‚Äôs brother had that happen. He made decent money working a warehouse but after a few years he needed spine surgery and couldn‚Äôt work anymore. He‚Äôs lucky that it happened after Obamacare so the medical bills didn‚Äôt bankrupt him, and he‚Äôs young enough that it‚Äôs relatively easy to go back to school.

No one should be ashamed of blue collar work, but I hesitate to say ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing wrong‚Äù with those jobs. There‚Äôs a serious problem with the physical toll on the bodies of people who work many of them, and at least here in America, when their bodies are broken, society largely casts these people aside, and doesn‚Äôt provide a decent path to alternative careers with adequate earnings.

To be honest, even long ago the 3 generations thing seems like more of an anecdotal kind of folksy wisdom than an actual fact. 

I mean hell, Johnson & Johnson was founded in the 1880s and the family is still rich as fuck. Same with the Rockefeller‚Äôs. George Bush‚Äôs family have been going to Yale since the 1840s which, obviously isn‚Äôt a school for the poors.
