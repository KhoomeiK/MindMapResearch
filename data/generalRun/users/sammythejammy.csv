I can't commit that much time to hating something, it's a waste of my time and everyone elses when it's just about how much I dislike X.

There was a comment someone wrote about **Hating.** It's beautiful and seeing as I've shared the subreddit already, I should also [share this view on hatred](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/erd4mo/just_a_friendly_reminder/ff3l7mf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x),"

Just wonder if it was their job to spec the materials they required..."
notliketheothergirls,fftekyx,t1_fft77ep,1580218275.0,I'm sure there is a subreddit dedicated to her. /r/bluehairbitch <- Yep I found it.
funny,fft8wwy,t1_fft5553,1580212681.0,"I would be the one chilling in the trolley and if I was the one trapped I'd sit there until someone let me out.

I'm assuming:

1. It's during regular shopping hours
2. Other people exist - Staff member, another shopper feeling sorry for you can let you out.
3. I'm not in immense pain or close to death

Sure it would be fucking annoying, but it's a good laugh. I'm not going to lose friends over something that doesn't literally hurt me.

Plus I'm not really claustrophobic so I'd be comfortable enough until either my friend let me back out or someone else did."
AskMen,fft8dcq,t3_ev2v2k,1580212032.0,"I've said this before... I think it's different from the problem you're facing though but this is how I feel sometimes. I don't know if it's people not wanting to hang out or if you're trying to make friends with the wrong people...

For me:

I don't talk to people because they don't really need to hear from me.

I don't make plans with people because they're probably busy or have something better to do.

I don't share things with people because they're probably boring to them or they don't care anyway.

People aren't interested in the same things I like so why should I need to talk about them? The thing can occupy my time, I don't need to occupy their time with it as well.

People don't need me. They can get what I offer from other people. If I am ok with myself, I'll leave the opportunity open to others that need each other.

... All of my negativity is externalised. It isn't an ""I'm useless"" thing; it's ""They don't really care"" kind of thing. It isn't about me but about them. It's not like I hate people, quite the opposite, I love them all so much. But I feel that it isn't reciprocated. I love me as well, I can love me more than they can, so what is the point? Surely I am better by myself. I love it when I get to hang out with people, in group settings or when I go and do something with someone. But it's usually so rare. I only really do it when I know the other person wants to do it. I can't fathom how my attendance makes whatever plan actually worthwhile making. Everyone is so much better company to everyone else, I'm just a small addition who joins in sometimes.

When I put this into words... It gets weird.

Sorry for the ramble. Your post just accidentally prompted me."

Aphantasia,ffqrif1,t3_euokzq,1580141969.0,"I had a discussion with some friends about whether Aphantasia is like this or if it is caused by people's differences in describing things.

This OP photo looks like it has been formed from the inside of eyelids, using actual eyes rather than being built from the mind's eye. But that is a substitute for some people isn't it? Making images out of the darkness of eyelids.."
