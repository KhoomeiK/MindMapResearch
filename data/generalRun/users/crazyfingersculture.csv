Fishing,fdwbx0j,t1_fdvmaio,1578757143.0,"> Florida Snakehead Fishing…Asian fish commonly known as a snakehead is the most recent addition to Florida fishing list of reproducing *exotic* fishes. All species of Florida Snakehead are illegal to possess live in the state of Florida. Possession of live Snakehead is a second degree misdemeanor punishable by up to a $500 fine and/or 60 days in jail. Florida law also makes it a crime for anyone to release any *exotic* fish into state waters.


I respect your candor throughout this post but it's not a fish that's legal to catch and release in the State of Florida. You catch it, kill it.

I'd say you could clean it out before eating by putting it in a clean water bath for a couple days but that would also be breaking the law. Anyways, these are typically canal fish so eating it from the canal wouldn't be that unusual."
