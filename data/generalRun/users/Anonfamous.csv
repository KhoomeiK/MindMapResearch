It asked me to ""push 3,"" if I want to donate money to the campaign. So anywho I push 3, and on comes a REAL trump supporter working the lines, at which point I tell ""impeach that mutherfucker!!"""

politics,fdlymxu,t1_fdlv7rm,1578535622.0,"I'm in Texas, so it's hard to tell being that Mexicans have been here a little while. I said 4th-5th because I'm a 3rd generation and my grandfather came in the 50s. So I just assumed a 4th as the 20s and a 5th as the 1900s.

I also assumed that you'd have to be a 4th to 5th generation separated to NOT know who your immigrant ancestors were. Just as my children will not know their great grandparents very well and their children definitely won't."
politics,fdks9ha,t1_fdkqna0,1578510091.0,"I said 4-5th generation. By that I mean they were very much born as a citizen...

 Hell some of them don't even know which of their ancestors first crossed and none of them speak spanish.

 I'm 3rd generation myself, my grandfather crossed in the 50s and my father was born here as was I. My grandfather went thru the grueling process of becoming a citizen, successfully in the 70s. And he is VERY sympathetic towards illegal immigrants going so far as to house them. Growing up I remember him and my grandmother housing and feeding people who would pass through our property on their journey to San Antone.

I have also worked side by side with some fine gentleman whom were illegal and became legal and even they were sympathetic towards their peers (as they should be)

So to me, these 4-5th generation trump loving immigrants suffer from something called ENTITLEMENT and also lacking any real struggle in their own path to citizenship as it was literally given to them by birth right."
