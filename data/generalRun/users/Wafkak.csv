scouting,ffnprwt,t1_ffmxoh8,1580069089.0,"Your camp sounds really different from ours in Belgium 
Tho we have 5 associations in most groups we just rent out a field close to a forest (aka a plot of land wit 100 trees in most areas in our country) and the patrols pitch there own tent and construct there own shelter with table and cooking fire through pioneering and cook on wood fire the whole camp
The younger ones sleep in a building in some associations (younger than 10 you we work by birth year and with school years) but in mine they just sleep in tents per patrol in the same field but a team of former leaders and parents that were leaders cook for them
The leaders construct the central area and the pioneering construction for the flagpole by pioneering
Most of camp is spent playing games hiking making campfires doing badges and night watch (your patrol makes a camp for 25 hours and keeps watch by a fire at night while leaders try to sneak in a night)
And we also have the occasional dropping (you are left in a forest with a map and have to find camp at night while the leaders try to find you

-most groups are also co-ed (in my federation that happened in the 60s)
-the extent of the patrol system can vary as some of my unit at the Jamboree didn't use it and with groups like mine you live cook and sleep together as a patrol
-also at most camps the toilets are a HUDO (a pit with a tent over it and a construction you can sit on)
