morbidquestions,ff91g32,t1_ff90ot2,1579702453.0,"Exactly, eventually in the end you discover that you are not even at the center of the onion. You are in fact nowhere, there is no one who is suffering because the self is only a concept created by the mind to fragment pieces of reality. The suffering is not a problem anymore because it is seen as a natural phenomenon rather than something happening to poor me. Do you resent the wind when it blows against the skin?"
morbidquestions,ff8pao4,t1_ff7mhqk,1579690137.0,"Fighting doesn't work, it only aggravates the problem and will exhaust you. Think of you emotional state as composed of layers. The layer you are focused on is the negative thoughts, unpleasant sensations in the body space, etc. What you are not seeing is that all of these are occurring in utter peace. All of these ""sensations"" that are tormenting you are akin to images appearing in a mirror. Whatever the content, the mirror is not affected. Look inside your body space and find small sensations of rest and peace, if you focus on those, they will surely grow. Find that mirror inside yourself and become it, you are not your thoughts. PM me for a book that will save you."

Why are you implying that there exists some kind of moral obligation from the individual towards something as abstract as a country."
Meditation,fak0cqk,t3_e9m8m6,1576158444.0,"Metta is not limited to beings, think of it as a lens which you can see through. In it's gross form it can resemble the love and nourishment with which a mother looks at her child. Or think of the ""goodwill"" you would feel towards a puppy. If you can access this, then you can refine the sensation down to a feeling of openness towards all components of experience. I made the mistake of ignoring myself in this process, specifically my body. Don't do that, the first step is to fill YOUR body with metta, it manifests as being at ease and having a sense of buoyancy. Fill yourself first, if you have resistance towards that then that will become your next goal. You can work on it by first forgiving yourself of anything which obstructs this love from yourself to yourself. Also pay attention to other people during the day and the behaviors which trigger you the most, those are exactly the qualities which you hate inside yourself and have repressed, making them effectively invisible in your self image. When you find them direct metta and compassion with the full understanding that there is no one at fault, you would have to point your finger at causality itself."
