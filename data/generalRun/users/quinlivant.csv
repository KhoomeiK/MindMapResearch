HouseplantsUK,femvrvx,t3_epng5y,1579270907.0,"It depends on the plant because plants propagate in different ways, before taking a cutting you'll need to decontaminate (what's the word with alcohol lol) the blade to make sure not to introduce bacteria to the plant, if you take a cutting from a main plant it's good to put an anti-fungicide on the wound afterwards. And make as clean a cut with a sharp knife as you can

A lot of cuttings you can place into water to grow roots but you need to take the cutting correctly e.g. taking a leaf cutting from a monstera (Swiss cheese plant) won't do anything and you need to include the node with it, that's the bit where the aerial roots come out and it'll grow anew. For schefflera you have to include a bit of the stem with it and then place into water, for th fern I'm not 100% because I don't grow ferns but I think they clone themselves and you can plant an offset. You can always Google these things just Google ""How to propagate ..."""
