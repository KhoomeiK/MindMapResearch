newcastle,fgqdum7,t1_fgodzhf,1581022303.0,Yes the barringtons and mountains near kurri have an effect. However with the trajectory of this slow moving low everywhere will get some rain
newcastle,fgqdins,t3_ezjub3,1581022155.0,"This east coast low is slow moving. 
We are expecting 3-4m nth then east swell as the slow heads all the way down the east coast. Depending on how the models go.

Some of the water in the east Aus current is around 26 deg.
Perfect conditions for cyclone development as far down as sydney.

The low will go subtropical.

Get your umbrellas ready."

This is not water hammer.
This happens when the cross section of pipe is suddenly too narrow. For example if two culvert combine into one of the same size.

The pressure is doubled and escapes through manholes and or the drains.

A similar phenomena happens in sewer. (I forgot the correct name for it). But i have a video at work of it blowing a manhole cover 20ft in the air."

NSFWgaming,ff6udfb,t3_erc8x6,1579635070.0,"Not sure why I have been getting downvotes.
I find it an obstacle course finding adult games. 
They send you to some website, but that website sends you some where else. Then you can't find where to click to down load the file.
Then it says you need some special app youve never heard of to run the game. 

Why can't adult games be as trustworthy and as easy as getting them from the play store?"
