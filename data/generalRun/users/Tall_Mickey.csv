AskReddit,fffx50v,t3_etejh8,1579893731.0,"Nobody told me that toenail fungus was such a thing, and thus grotesque toenails.  I was clear for 30 years and then got a girlfriend who had it.  That did the trick.  

Just had a marathon toenail trimming session last night and they look relatively normal.  For now."

AskReddit,fffwooa,t3_etdzz6,1579893447.0,"You're supposed to ""tough it out"" to get everything done in your overburdened life; and there are no immediate long-term bad effects.  

Except of course there's the short and medium term: poor judgment, being in a drunk-like fatigue state, decreased performance, poor memory retention, and perhaps even weight gain. And down the road, perhaps, greater chances of dementia in old age."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fffnr71,t1_fff7y70,1579887914.0,"Yes.  I live in a very expensive area, and I hear retail and food server employers complain about worker quality.  But they don't/can't pay enough for people to reasonably survive without another job (or two).  A job that doesn't provide reasonable life is a fake job.  Fake jobs attract more fake employees -- especially since they know they can always get another one."
WouldYouRather,fffl3j1,t3_etaaft,1579886294.0,"Probably be the richest person alive; I'd spend all the money undermining all the other billionaire by pushing technologies and legal reforms which undercut the choke points in the economy that they exploit at the expense of all the rest of humanity.

Probably make myself richer by doing so, too.  And frankly, if you're rich it doesn't matter what you look like.  Health would be taken care of by the best health care that money could buy -- or even better, by the best health care that _power_ can buy."
AskReddit,fffhsn0,t3_etcrur,1579884257.0,"A lot of supposed ""dumbness"" is just a failure to think: poor impulse control (""it seemed like a good idea at the time""), believing what other people say without thinking for yourself (gullibility), and so on.  And yes: if you can identify it, you can work on it.  Even Internet searches can show you the way.
