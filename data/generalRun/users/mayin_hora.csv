I'm glad you've gotten a diagnosis as I struggled with depression since I was 12-13 but never sought treatment until I was in my 30s. Being bipolar is a huge challenge that will follow you the rest of your life (from what I understand). 

Unfortunately, I can relate on the ""never been good at anything."" I've had people call me loser and have been fired from several jobs over my lifetime. But I'm a teacher now, though not the greatest, and the depression and anxiety is still a struggle. I'm a good helper, supporter, assistant, behind the scenes guy. I know that and recognize that I'll never be a leader type. Take a personality test and read the results about gifts and talents. Google 16 personalities.

Maybe you can start planning how to leave home when you're old enough. That environment is toxic and your therapist/doctor will agree. Hang in there!"
