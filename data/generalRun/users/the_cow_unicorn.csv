reddevils,ffzgjjj,t1_ffzbicn,1580377976.0,I somehow misread your last sentence as the Portuguese having a lot more pheromones than the Spanish. Was a weird sentence to read.
reddevils,ffwklh7,t1_ffw5sml,1580303981.0,Which doesn’t make things any better. Severe lack of ability there...
reddevils,ffw43lb,t1_ffw323k,1580283456.0,"My concern is tunnel vision. As can be seen on the past couple of windows. We have one target and one target only per position for whatever reason. If they tunnel on maddi only, we will end up overpaying and be screwed because he will only join us on the last day.


Just take Fernandes for example. Literally no reason why his transfer process needed to start so late and be dragged so long. If we had other options who knows, we may have gotten him for cheaper or sooner. It’s almost like this club has never bartered in a market or car dealership before..."
reddevils,ffw2s3c,t1_ffw2o2n,1580281846.0,"Yeah absolutely, we definitely need depth for sure. But with that trio someone will need to be the third wheel of sorts. Unless the manager is great at man management and keeps everyone happy. 


I’m really envious of the people next door with their massive depth of midfield talent. And I hope we have that again someday"
reddevils,ffw2klo,t1_ffw29p4,1580281601.0,"Hmmm... point noted... that could be an issue. The thing is our injury record is garbage so we probably wouldn’t have them all available together. 


However knowing our luck in recent years, I wouldn’t be surprised if all three are fit throughout the year and end up with one of them dissatisfied with their opportunities or something along those silly lines. Our luck is just really unbelievable sometimes."

worldnews,ffqw14a,t1_ffqu9pr,1580144924.0,"They are that selfish though. The woman who brought the virus to Paris was already ill when she was in Singapore, but took medication to lower her body temperature to get through the thermal sensors. 


Another one, whose husband and son were hospitalized and quarantined decided to make a run for Malaysia. Guess what she was also a virus carrier, and that’s how Malaysia got their first case. 


It’s ridiculous how selfish and just black out deluded that they think it will only happen to others and not to themselves. Selfish and ignorant."

Tomorrowland,ffprjx0,t3_eu38g5,1580103162.0,"Just a friendly piece of advice. If possible ask for a lower floor room. Because when you have a hundred people heading back to the hotel at pretty much the same time, water pressure is really going to suck. 


Last year was my first year. And the hotel offered me a top floor room with a bathtub. I took it. Couldn’t shower till around 5am."

Do I buy them on a scouse Jersey? Then there’s no way I can step into my own home. My fingers might rot if I touch that shit. 


Will this curse even work with external players? Will it only work on existing players? Will the curse transfer if I buy another clubs jersey? Will I be cast out for all of infinity by doing something so sacrilegious?? So many questions."
