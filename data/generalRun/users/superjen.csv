NoStupidQuestions,fcbujgo,t1_fcb47ds,1577591128.0,"Look it up for your area, now before you actually need it. Sometimes it's 311, in my county it's ###-HELP to call basically the same dispatcher as 911, but they know going into it you're not needing urgent help."

NoStupidQuestions,fcbnol6,t3_eh0jl4,1577588940.0,"Take out your contacts if you wear them, get some soothing eye drops that do not have anti redness ingredients (something like systane ultra, not visine) if you have dry eyes and go see the doctor if it gets very red or irritated looking. Give it a day to decide if you're not in pain, go ASAP if it's bothering you, you don't want to mess around with your vision! I went to the Walmart vision center with a scratch on my cornea a few months ago and it was a $59 office visit for them to check it out. Hope that helps."

I'm not a doctor or anything so I could never guess if it's a psychiatric disorder or if he's 'just' an alcoholic, but either way please make sure your kids are safe. Don't let them grow up with even more memories of hiding from their father as he beats on a door — that is horrific! Stay strong, I hope you find someplace to go with them until you figure out your next steps."

It's not that great a plan, many people online have already typed up excellent explanations about why not so I won't duplicate their efforts here. If it's new to you, try it I guess but don't let it take up any mental bandwidth or feel guilty if you drop it by March."

But yes I can imagine needing that  while traveling since there are many situations where you are stuck over an hour with no bathroom access."
