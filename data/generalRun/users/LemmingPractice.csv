nbadiscussion,ffny1gm,t3_euat2f,1580072166.0,"You are definitely overvaluing Simmons. He definitely does not have enough value where you could trade him straight up for either Harden or Dame. Neither of those players will get dealt unless they ask to be traded, in any event. Houston is in win now mode, and gave up a lot of their future draft capital to OKC. They are all in on winning with Harden now. If they trade him for a younger player like Ben, it would be to pursue a rebuild, and I just don't see that happening right now.

For Dame, he means a lot to that franchise. You could talk yourself into dealing Dame for a younger high ceiling guy like Simmons, just based on on-court value, but Dame's off court value is bigger. When it comes to small markets like Portland, getting a borderline top 10 guy like Dame to commit to your franchise is a big deal. There is no guarantee that Ben will commit to Portland like that. Dame may end up being that franchise's GOAT, which is also a big deal, and he is loved by the fanbase. I just don't think they have any desire to trade him.

The one of your deals that makes sense, from a value perspective is Embiid for Beal, although I think that would need to be a three way deal. If the Wizards are dealing Beal they probably are blowing it up, and Embiid is not really where you want to start a rebuild. They would probably either want Simmons (who is younger, locked in for longer and has less of an injury risk), or would flip Embiid to a third team for more rebuilding type assets.

The thing is that there just aren't a lot of superstars who are on the block right now, and if any come available, it is probably because a team wants to rebuild. That's part of why superstar for superstar deals are so rare. Except for maybe KAT, there aren't really any superstars that could reasonable be expected to come available anytime soon. And, KAT doesn't actually make a lot of sense for Philly (you are not putting KAT next to Embiid, and if you trade him for Embiid, you have a pretty similar problem with Simmons, since KAT wants to be in the post).

The most realistic deal for Philly to fix their spacing is probably Simmons for D'Lo, with the Warriors throwing in this year's pick, as long as it is not a top 3 pick. Its not as sexy as dreams of bringing in James Harden, but D'Lo would be the perfect type of offensive player for Philly, and Philly has the defence to cover up his shortcomings."
nbadiscussion,ffngkku,t1_ffnf5tu,1580065671.0,"I agree with you on Simmons for Harden being laughable, but I similarly think that Simmons for Westbrook is laughable. Simmons is basically the younger cheaper Westbrook. Westbrook's biggest weakness is his three point shooting, just like Ben's. Philly gains a new player that Embiid doesnt fit with, while getting an expensive past-his-prime guy who relies heavily on his athleticism. That deal makes no sense from Philly's side."
nbadiscussion,ffmbhwm,t3_etjfwj,1580051862.0,"I was going to go with Kyrie, but someone already took that one, so I'll go with Trae Young.

I was shocked to see Trae be voted the first place all star starter, not only by the fans, but also in the overall counting, after players and media votes were considered.

Yes, his counting stats are great, and yes, he is fun to watch. His offensive impact is not overrated, he is excellent. But, people tend to just paper over the fact that he might be the worst defensive player in the league. By DRPM, he is ranked as the worst defensive point guard (86th out of 86), with an atrocious -4.11. This is a large part of why his team is the second worst team in the league.

This isn't to say that I don't think that Trae can improve, or that he won't be a star in the future, but in terms of his current overall impact, he's not even an all-star level player yet. He is a promising work in progress, but he has some very clear areas that need to improve, like his defence and turnovers. Putting him above guys like Kemba, Lowry and Simmons, at present, is ridiculous."
nba,ffm7llc,t1_ffjv0fm,1580049844.0,"It is pretty silly to say he doesn't provide 3 point shooting. His 31.9% from 3 its not the greatest percentage, but it's not terrible either. It is the equivalent of a 47.85% two point FG%. And, he isn't shooting that off open spot ups, he it's primarily creating his own three point shots off the bounce, and he is a high usage shooter (over 9 3's a game). Comparing his percentage to a Danny Green type player who shoots primarily open spot up corner 3's is apples to oranges. Luka is the guy who gets the ball at the end of the shot clock and has to create his own shot. If Luka was only shooting spot ups from the corner his numbers would be way better.

Also, probably most importantly, Luka's three point shooting is not about just his efficiency on that shot. His three point shooting is about opening up the floor for the rest of his game. His three point shooting just has to be good enough for the other team to respect it, and it is. No one defends Luka like Ben Simmons, or he would torch them consistently. Opponents have to respect his three, which opens up his drive, which allows him to kick to teammates. All around, his efficiency is elite when you factor in his two's, ability to get to the line, and assists. His three point shooting is good enough to open up all the rest of that, and that's all it needs to do."

For guards, Trae doesn't make it. This isn't an exhibition where you pick flashy players the fand like, this is about playing winning basketball. [Trae is the worst defensive point guard in the league](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/page/3/sort/DRPM/position/1), and his team has the second worst record in the league. He's not making all-NBA.

For those two guard spots that open up by dropping Trae and Butler, I think you fill those with Kyle Lowry and Chris Paul. Those are both guys who have been central to their teams overperforming this year. They are putting up excellent numbers, play great defence, and have been great leaders for their respective teams."

It's not about blame. I don't blame AD for New Orleans failures, but he also doesn't get credit for  successes that he never accomplished.

>Pls explain how Lebron isnt in his prime anymor

LeBron is playing some great basketball, but if you think this is prime LeBron then you don't remember LeBron's prime. He was on another level.

Take a look, for instance, at his win shares per 48 (to adjust for the fact that we're only halfway through the season). He is at .223 right now, which is an excellent number. But, in his prime, he put up four straight years at .298 or better.

Post-prime LeBron is better than the primes of most other players, but saying this is prime LeBron is frankly understating how amazing LeBron's prime was."

Lol, yes, 5 time all star Kevin Love was, in fact, the 2nd other all star on that team.

>??? They were both around the top 5 players before Lebron got there. 2020 Anthony Davis is definitely as good, if not better, than 2013 Wade. And 2014 is when Wade fell off a cliff in the playoffs

""Top 5"" is just people's opinions, and doesn't actually mean anything. And, no, most people didn't consider AD top 5 until the trade to LA (then, of course, after the trade happened, the LA media decided that he was). Wade had already won a chip without LeBron, and had proven his ability to be the best player on a high level contender for years. AD has played in the playoffs twice in seven years, and has won a grand total of 4 playoff games in his career.

AD still has a lot of career to go, and a ton of talent, so I'm not going to make any judgements on what he might accomplish in the future, but comparing AD's career to Wade's career at the time that they joined LeBron is ridiculous. AD accomplished nothing in New Orleans aside from putting up some nice per game stats on a number of bad teams. Wade was a champion and a Finals MVP."

They are both great players right now, and incredibly exceptional players for their respective ages, but their primes were on a whole other level.

Lebron is playing incredibly well for a 35 year old, but he is not prime LeBron anymore. As a good comparative comp, let's look at his win shares per 48 (to adjust for the fact that the season's not over). This year he has a .223, which is an excellent number.

As for the Bulls, they were a 62 win team, while the Bucks are on pace for 71. Meanwhile the Heat, while they had a slow start to ""only"" 58 wins, were a juggernaut with prime LeBron, Wade and Bosh. The Heat also held a better point differential than the Bulls, even though they had fewer wins.

By DRPM, Trae is literally the worst defensive point guard in the league (he ranks 86th out of 86 point guards with a -4.11, ranking behind even Isaiah Thomas). Luka isn't a great defender (he's a -1.82), but he is far less of a liability, and has the physical tools and basketball IQ to defend reasonably well when he needs to."

nbadiscussion,ffiewk8,t3_etmuyn,1579972224.0,"Pretty good list overall. I would only tweak it a bit.

I don't think the Sixers are number 1. Embiid has serious injury concerns (had never played 65 games in a season), there are aignificant fit issues between him and Simmons, and they are both through (or about to be through) their cheap first contracts.

I have Dallas number 1. Doncic is by far the best asset going. He still has several years more on a cheap rookie deal, and he's already a legitimate MVP candidate. With a pretty solid number 2 asset, in Porzingis, I think Dallas takes top spot.

I have Denver number 2, largely because of MPJ's recent breakout. Jokic's value is ibvious, and Murray and Harris are solid starters, but MPJ has top 5 potential, and still has 3 years left on his rookie deal. I think that puts them above Philly.

I think the Pels are a bit too high. Zion has played like 2 pro games, and has some pretty serious injury concerns. BI is awesome, but the rest of their guys have yet to really show enough on a consistent basis for me to consider them difference makers.

I would rank the Grizz above the Pels. You left Brandon Clarke off your list for them. Ja and JJJ give the Grizz a true star duo, and then they have some solid depth behind that with Clarke, Melton and Brooks.

I would also jump the Raptors' core above the Suns. Booker and Ayton have good potential, but the Raps' guys are proven winners. Also, I would add Terence Davis to the list of Raptors guys. He is having a great rookie season, is has both the physical tools and mental makeup to be an excellent pro.

The other couple that i think deserve to be higher are the Pacers (who have proven themselves to be winners, too, and deserve to be above unproven groups like the Bulls) and the Knicks (they are one of those unproven groups, but a team with young talent like RJ and Robinson should not be as low as 23rd)."

I don't know enough about the technicalities to judge the accuracy, but the article certainly had a massively different estimate than that (saying it would only cut 19 minutes off a 5 hour ride). If the reduction is 30% (presumably reducing the time of the trip to about 3.5 hours), then the proposal starts to look like it makes a bit more sense.

>Toronto-Ottawa in 3.5 hrs for $50 is probably an existential threat to Porter Airlines and would probably end Greyhound service to Ottawa.

So, I think it pretty much comes down to this statement here. Is that the service and cost that we are realistically looking at getting here? If so, this is a massively different value proposition than what the article says HFR is offering. Do you have any sources that show your version to be the right set of facts? If that is the value proposition we are talking about, with the potential to upgrade speeds in the future, then I'm in. If we are talking about 4.5 hour ride time (like the article talks about), $100 fares (or massively subsidized fares with public money), Then we are talking about a massively different value proposition.

>If VIA does this right, the HFR line will be upgradeable. They spend a few hundred million each year upgrading sections of track and slowly boosting speeds.  Over a decade the line starts approaching High Speed Rail speeds.  Keep in mind that HFR starts with Class 6/7 rail which has a passenger train speed limit of 177/201 km/h.  Upgrading to HSR at that point is a matter of spending money removing level crossings and smoothing out curves.  That can be done over time as budgets allow.

So, genuine curiosity question: what is the point of building a system like that with the plan of upgrading it so soon? If the technology is already there to build the eventual system from the beginning, wouldn't it make more sense to just build the end product right away? Sure, you get to spread out the cost, but you are still installing portions of track that you are planning to replace in the relatively near future. That seems like a lot of sunk cost.

In addition to that, launching the better product from the beginning is the much better marketing proposition. People who look at the day 1 offering and decide it isn't good enough may not be tuned in by the time the increased speeds do make the proposition good enough. It is much harder to change people's minds once they are made up."

It still does not change the fact that the time for the trip does not compare favourably with air travel. It still ends up being more expensive and less convenient than driving, with no real time advantage.

It just seems like it is spending a ton of money for no apparent benefit. If you are going to do it, do it right, and do it high speed. Otherwise, I just don't see the point in flushing billions of dollars down the drain on a system that will end up being underused."

The main reason why they have that is because the quickest way from Toronto to Montreal doesn't go through Ottawa.

So, the question with a high speed rail line is whether it goes through Ottawa, or goes straight from Toronto to Montreal, with a secondary line where people can transfer at Kingston, or somewhere like that.

Trudeau (our current Liberal PM) is considered left wing for his Party (typically considered the center, or center-left party, depending on who their leader is at the time), and campaigned on making the rich pay a little bit more into the pot...so, our top income tax rate (combined federal and provincial) is now about 53% (varying slightly by province).

In the East, the Raptors are healthy again, and their best players are rounding into form, while Norm Powell is emerging as a 6MOTY competitor. Meanwhile, the Heat have cooled off a bit with some troubling losses (like to the Knicks) and some squeeked out wins against teams they should smash (ie. yesterday's overtime win over the Kings). The Heat have been winning a lot of close games, and their +3.7 differential is well below both the Raptors and Celtics. I think that the Heat will slip down closer to the middle of the playoff pack, and will be in the 4 or 5 slot in 20 games. Meanwhile, I think the Raptors will power into the 2-spot, between regaining their health and having a pretty easy scheduling coming up (they have the Sixers, minus Embiid, then 6 straight games against below .500 teams).

I was ready to say that the Celtics were coming back to Earth, until yesterday, but damn were they impressive beating up the Lakers. They have a bit of a tricky scheduling coming up, but I think they will maintain their grasp on 3rd place, and we'll see them a couple of games below the Raptors, and a couple of games above the Heat, in 20 games. I think the Pacers will hiccup a bit, as Oladipo gets back up to speed, but will be fighting the Heat for the 4 seed in 20 games, while the Sixers will struggle to keep up while Embiid is out. They will be in the 6-seed in 20 games, but will still be the team no one wants to play in the first round of the playoffs.

In the West, I feel like the Nuggets are going to make a deadline deal. They have so many pieces to do so. I am predicting that they swing a deal for another star. They have the pieces, and I think they have the desire. If they can upgrade some of their depth into another star (maybe, like a Jrue Holiday level guy...or, just Jrue Holiday), along with the development of Michael Porter, I think they will solidify themselves into that number 2 seed in the West, and might even push the Lakers for that one-seed, if the Lakers take their foot off the pedal.

Below that, I think the Jazz will keep up their hot streak and solidify themselves in that 3 seed, while the Clippers' results continue to lag below their skill level, as they rest guys, and look forward to the playoffs. I think that in 20 games, we will see the Clippers pretty solidified into the 4-5 matchup. The Rockets look like a mess, over their last few games, but I still think they will hold onto the 6 seed.

I'm Canadian, and our politics are generally way more left wing than American politics are. Your Republicans are way more right wing than our Conservatives. But, you are also a two party system, so there is a huge swath of space on the political spectrum that is covered by your two parties. Anything left of the Republicans is Democrat, and everything right of the Democrats is Republican. That goes all the way from centrist to the extremes, on both sides.

AOC has endorsed the candidate who openly touts himself as a socialist. In Canada, the country more left wing than you guys, Sanders and AOC would both solidly qualify as left wing candidates (either one would neatly fit into our NDP party).

nbadiscussion,ff62ekf,t3_erlbpb,1579617410.0,"First of all, yes, I am concerned that Middleton can't be the second best player on a championship team. He will have to show up in the playoffs before I will believe that, but that's not my biggest concern with the Bucks.

My biggest concern with the Bucks is that Bud isn't a championship coach. He is a great regular season coach, no doubt, but we've seen this story play out twice now. He has now coached two 60 win teams, both of whom have flopped out in the playoffs. Both times, Bud was unable, or unwilling, to make effective in-series adjustments. The first time, he couldn't find an adjustment to allow his 60 win Hawks to take a single game off the Cavs. The next year, they got another shot against the Cavs, and got swept again. Then, of course, last year, the series against the Raptors was the Bucks dominating, until Nick Nurse made some adjustments. After that, the series just kept swinging in the Raptor's favour, with no adjustments swinging it back. The Raptors went back and forth with the Sixers as the coaches made adjustments and counter-adjustments, but against Bud, it was basically, ""you got me"" once plan A was adjusted to.

If he was a rookie coach, that would be one thing,  but this was the book on Bud before he got to Milwaukee. He may very well be the best regular season coach in the league. When it comes to putting together a system and getting players to buy in, he's great. But, in the playoffs, you can't win with plan A. You need to adjust, because the other teams will adjust. When a team runs up against the Bucks, who is good enough to push them into the deep water of a 7 game series (maybe Philly, the Raptors again, Boston, whoever wins the West) Bud will need to show the ability to be flexible and adjust his plan to counter what the other team throws at him. He got outcoached by a rookie head coach last year (albeit an extremely talented rookie head coach). He needs to be better for the Bucks to get over the hump."

In 1986-7, he won the scoring title by 75 points. Second place was Jari Kurri, Gretzky's linemate (who got the benefit of goals set up by Wayne, or assists from passing to Wayne). The year before that, Wayne won the scoring title by 74 points over Mario Lemieux (second leading scorer of all time). The year before that, he won the scoring title by 73 points, over his linemate Jari Kurri. The year before that he won the scoring race by 79 points...and I could keep going.

ontario,ff3sas2,t1_ff3okfy,1579547770.0,"I agree, but I think that's why you would have to leave out Kingston.

If you take Kingston as the given, then there is a strong argument for adding Ottawa to the path, because it is one of Canada's largest cities, and the capital. But, if you assume the Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal path, then adding the detour to Kingston (a good sized city, but still only about 100k people) I don't think you can justify it."
ontario,ff3nh30,t1_ff3jnrm,1579544819.0,"I think the long term goal would be for the route to go all the way from Windsor to Quebec City. You build the Toronto to Montreal route, which anchors the economics of the line, and then extend the additional tracks out from there.

Ideally, you would want a Kitchener stop on there, and you might not be able to have both Ottawa and Kingston, because it requires a sharp north turn from Kingston to Ottawa, which is problematic for high speed rail, and would extend travel time on the core route significantly. You probably have to drop one of those stops and then add a separate line between Ottawa and Kingston, for riders to transfer."
canada,ff3m3dr,t1_ff38zqm,1579543959.0,"It is absolutely about filling a logistical need for people. Time matters for transportation options. No one uses the train because there is no reason to. You can hop on a Porter flight and, even with the time it takes to go through check-in and airport security, the trip takes a fraction of the time. High Frequency Rail does nothing to solve that problem. It will just continue to be unpopular, like it has been, because the trip takes too damn long. 

With High Speed Rail, the option becomes much more compelling. If you could take a train from downtown Toronto to downtown Montreal, in about 2.5 hours, while avoiding the time delay involved with going through airports, you would be able to compete directly with air travel, easily.

Studies have concluded that there are two routes in Canada that make sense for high speed rail: Toronto-Montreal and Calgary-Edmonton. These also happen to be two of the most popular airplane routes in the country. High speed rail would reduce the amount of air traffic (also reducing emissions), while stimulating the economy by offering a more convenient way for business traffic to go between some of Canada's largest business centers. You can even provide stimulus for one or two smaller areas which conveniently fall on each line (ie. Kingston and Red Deer)."
ontario,ff3gbjb,t1_ff37gwh,1579540455.0,"It doesn't need anywhere near that many stops. In fact, too many stops actually hurts ridership, because it increases the time for the trip the largest group of riders wants: Toronto to Montreal. High speed rail wants to be fast enough to compete with air travel. Montreal to Toronto is the most profitable route in the country, with tons of flights daily. If you can take the train directly into the downtown core, and avoid the delays of airport security, then high speed rail can definitely compete...unless you have 20 stops on the route.

The ideal would be to run the route up through Ottawa, and have just three stops on the journey. If you are running it along the existing tracks, have stops in Oshawa and Kingston and call it a day. The amount of riders you gain from stops in smaller areas just isnt worth the ridership you lose by lengthening the time of the trip."

I care about who gets selected as an all star, but I couldn't care less about the actual game, so make ""all star"" just a title, and name the all stars at a ceremony during mid-season tournament week.

As for the tournament itself, I would run the top 8 over a week long period in February at whichever city would otherwise be running the all star game. Scatter the division qualifier games throughtout the early part of the season on designated weeks that are ""qualifier weeks"" to add juice to those games. You can then run all the normal all star sideshow attractions during mid-season tournament week (ie. Dunk contest, three point competition, etc).

Instead of one all star game, you get 7 games for TV, which should all be more relevant than the all star game circus. Play up the East vs West rivalry that the all star game is supposed to foster by having all quarter final games be east vs west. The weeklong event should result in increased revenues over the all star game, so you aren't sacrificing revenues.

To make the tournament matter, give the top fnishing team in either conference a first round playoff bye in the playoffs, football style. Compensate for those lost games with a play-in tournament at the end of the season (except everyone competes for one of 7 playoff spots, not 8).

AG is a much better and more versatile player than Caris. I do think Orlando needs a deal to even up its roster composition, but I don't think this is a deal that they would, or should do.

Frankly, Levert is one of those players who gets overrated because he's in a big market on a team that gets a lot of media attention. He can score, but he's more of a high volume, low efficiency scorer (47.2 TS%). He's a below average defender (-1.51 DRPM), and provides little value when he isn't scoring. He's very injury-prone and is already 25, so he is even the older of the two players (AG is 24), even though Gordon has more experience.

Gordon is actually exactly what the Nets would love to have. Levert will have a tough time next year, because there won't be a ton of touches for him with KD, Kyrie and Dinwiddie all needing touches, too. Gordon would be a great fit, as a guy who doesn't need the ball in his hands to be effective. He would be a great glue guy for them.

nbadiscussion,feys7xz,t3_eqxkek,1579449958.0,"KAT is a fascinating player in the modern NBA, and really begs the question: what do we want a center to be?

Comparing him to a guy like Gobert really is apples to oranges, because they are basically opposites. [By RPM, KAT is literally both the best offensive center in the league and the worst defensive center in the league.](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/DRPM/position/9) His offensive game is very well suited for the modern NBA, but, if you need a rim protector, look elsewhere. Comparing him to Gobert really is just asking the old ""offence or defence"" question.

I don't think KAT is mad underrated. Most stoll view him as one of the top 3 centers in the league (along with Jokic and Embiid...AD, is generally counted as a 4), but KAT's skills are quite different from those two guys. Jokic is a unique facilitator at the center position, while Embiid is a far superior defender, but I think is a step below KAT on offence. I woukd tend to rank Jokic, Embiid, then KAT (or Gobert, depending on what you team needs), but that is pretty subjective because  each of those guys has such a different skill set.

Ideally, I think that KAT would be optimized next to a rim protecting 4. Someone like a Serge Ibaka or Horford type (can protect the rim, shoot the three and play the 5 when KAT is sitting) would be the ideal pairing."
nbadiscussion,feypnlg,t3_eqwbp5,1579448841.0,"Frankly, I'm surprised to see people unconvinced on this from the Philly side. From the Philly side, I don't think there's any question. If you can get Lillard for Simmons (and maybe a future first and cap ballast) you do it in a heartbeat. Lillard is arguably a top 10 player (top 15 at worst). He is the exact type of player Philly needs, too. He is an excellent floor general, who stretches the floor, he's a great leader, and he's a clutch guy who can create and make the final shot.

Yes, Simmons is younger, he's got crazy physical skills and potential, and he's got a cheaper deal right now, but imho Lillard would make Philly the favourite to win the chip instantly, and opens up a championship window that probably lasts until he starts to decline. Having a point guard as elite as Dame, with arguably the best, or second best, big man in the game, and a third all star level talent, in Tobias Harris, is absolutely enough to win a chip.  

From Portland's side, I just don't see it, though. Dame is locked in long term, and is happy to be there. If you are a small to mid level market like Portland and you have a superstar who wants to be there, and wants to win there, you would be foolish to move him. Dame also means a lot to that fan base, even beyond his on court value.

For Portland, I think you go a different direction. I do think that this season is a loss, and they should accept that. They need to give their young guys a chance to develop, they need to give their team a chance to get healthy, they need to get themselves a high draft pick (either for using or trading), and they need to pick up some support talent in free agency this summer. 

Nurkic is a major piece, but he's not going to be up to speed from day 1. Look at Paul George and Hayward, who had similar injuries. Nurkic won't show up and save this season, but he should be a major force again next season. Between him, Dame and CJ, they have a very solid contending core. They need to focus on building around that, or maybe even trading up for another win now asset using the high pick they should get this summer (ideally a high level wing or power forward). But, getting Nurkic and Zach Collins back and healthy for next season would be a big boost.

This is a team that can quickly reload, and has its stars locked in for several years. They should call this season a loss, and focus on coming back strong next year, because, if they can get healthy, they already have all the pieces to be a major contender."
boxoffice,feyanlk,t1_fewlpuz,1579443064.0,"That's actually not accurate. The first live action film to be filmed in 3D was Ghosts of the Abyss (a documentary Cameron released in 2003). After that Robert Rodriguez (a friend of Cameron's) got ahold of the tech and did Sky Kids 3D (2003) and Sharkboy and Laval Girl (2005). Pretty much every major animated movie around the time started being released in 3D, with Zemeckis being one of the main drivers of the tech. Zemeckis' films around the time were animated features done with motion capture technology (not dissimilar to the non-human portions of Avatar) and included Polar Express, Beowulf and A Christmas Carol. Polar Express is actually in the Guiness Book of Records as the first all-motion capture film. Even concert films like U2 3D and Hanah Montana were shot with 3D cameras in that timeframe.

Avatar popularized 3D, and popularized the concept of movies being shot in 3D, but it was far from the first. It also wasn't expected to be anything special by most pundits. Boxoffice.com had projected the movie at $175M final total, in advance of its release. It was pitched as having groundbreaking visuals (which it did), but there wasn't some huge clamour about people hyped to see the new tech. The movie succeeded once people started seeing it, and it developed crazy word of mouth.

I mean, yeah, the visuals were cool, and I assume the visuals in the sequel will be, too (apparently, the underwater sequences use brand new tech), but this was also a Best Picture nominee at the Oscars (largely considered, at the time, to be in a two horse race with Hurt Locker). Even if it had been the first film shot in native 3D, general audiences don't care that much about that type of a gimmick (if they had, Ghosts of the Abyss would have made major bank). A gimmick like that might get people's attention, but a film still has to stand on its own merits.

Unfortunately, that all comes in a package with a guy who has shit basketball IQ, and is too arrogant to realize it.

Kyrie is the exact reason why the eye test is such a bad way to evaluate basketball players. People vastly overestimate one-on-one skills. Kyrie has ""School Yard Legend"" skills. Put him against someone one on one, and he can put any defender on skates. But, NBA basketball is not a one on one game. Iso is just not an efficient way to score, unless you are reeeeeeally elite at it. [Of the top 10 players with the highest percentage of iso plays, only two average more than a point per possession on their iso plays (Harden and Dame).](https://stats.nba.com/players/isolation/?sort=POSS_PCT&dir=1)To put that in perspective, every single team in the NBA averages more than a point per possession, overall. Kyrie averages less than a point per possession on iso plays. He has a low turnover rate on iso plays, because of his handle, so he gets his shots up, but he draws very few fouls, which goes back to basketball IQ.

The thing is that a lot of players use their iso skills to open up the floor for teammates. LeBron also has less than a point per possession on iso plays, but he's not primarily using his iso plays to score, he is using them to draw the defence and kick to the open man. Kyrie isn't. He gets tunnel visioned and fails to use his iso skills to open up higher percentage plays for his teammates. He just doesn't see plays develop like point guards are supposed to. 

For all his skills, [he is 22nd among point guards in RPM, just behind DJ Augustin and just ahead of Aaron Holiday.](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/position/1) And, that is after a blazing hot start to the season.

Boston had the same thing last year, where their record was better in games he missed. And, of course, we all know about their ECF run without him, and how well they are doing without him now (even while missing Horford, too).

Of course, some will bring up his success in Cleveland beside LeBron, but, I don't think its any secret that LeBron makes players look really good. There is a reason why Mo Williams can call himself an all star. Kyrie lacks basketball IQ, but LeBron has it in spades, in addition to being a great leader. Kyrie was essentially able to play as a shooting guard, a role he's actually very well suited for, while LeBron was running the offence. Of course, Kyrie's impact in Cleveland is also somewhat overstated. They did, after all, make the Finals again after he left, despite the guy the got for him (IT) being an injured non-factor.

In reality, it isn't that Kyrie can't be your best player, if you want to be a championship contender, it is that you don't want him running your offence, if you want to be a championship team. So, who can he be effectively paired with, then? Ideally you want a point forward who Kyrie would be willing to defer to, since a backcourt with Kyrie and another small point guard would be defensively vulnerable. Off the top of my head two point forwards come to mind who would fit well next to Kyrie: LeBron and Luka. But, in his last year in Cleveland Kyrie had a higher usage rate than LeBron, and then left because he didn't want to defer to him, so even with a guy like Luka I'm not sure that Kyrie would buy in.

So, where do you rank a guy with exceptional skills who can't (or chooses not to) adapt them play winning team basketball. Is he a better player than Kemba? Well, he's more skilled, but the Celtics have been way better with Kemba, especially considering they also lost Horford and Rozier, along with Kyrie. If I were a GM I would sign Kemba over Kyrie in a heartbeat, so, by that measure, I would rank Kemba above him. It feels weird to say that Klay is a better player than Kyrie, but I would take him over Kyrie in a heartbeat as a GM. Kyrie would beat him one on one, but in the context of a 5 on 5 game, Klay wins you way more games. I think any of Klay's Warrior teams would be worse with Kyrie, and any of Kyrie's teams would have been better if he were Klay. Tough to compare with much bigger guys like Siakam, KAT and Gobert, since its apples to oranges, but I definitely think that any of those guys contributes to winning more than Kyrie.

I would tend to say that Kyrie is a top 20 player, but I also feel like I could name 20 players I would sign as a free agent over Kyrie, because his playstyle works with so few teams, and he is unwilling to change his approach, so take that how you will."
torontoraptors,fepbm4f,t1_feowasj,1579316556.0,"So, in the first paragraph you talk about how Kyle will never catch Kyrie on fan vote (which I agree with), like ot means the whole thing is hopeless, and then in your last paragraph you acknowledge that the fan vote is only 50%, and that the media and player vote can swing things.

Sure, Kyle is not going to catch Kyrie on fan voting, but do you really think that a bunch of players who have played 40 games this season are going to vote in a guy who has only played 14?

Voting counts towards 50%. Sure, the players and media can swing the vote with their 50%, but its still important to get our boys as much of the fan 50% as we can.

Kyle is a respected veteran who just won the chip, while balling out in the clinching game. Players respect him. He is an incumbent all star, who has paid his dues and reached the mountaintop. Players are less likely to let a second year guy like Trae, whose team they stomp every time they see him, be a starter. Trae is not an incumbent all star, he hasn't earned the respect of the league's players in the same way that Kyle has. I can totally see a bunch of guys thinking to themselves, ""that dude's not an all star starter, dude can't even guard me!""

So, yeah, I vote every day. It takes like 2 minutes to vote all 4 times, and voting only lasts until Monday, so its not some huge ordeal.  You could have done your day's voting in the time it took you to write your message. I want to see Pascal and Lowry make it, ideally as starters. And, I know FVV won't make it, but I want him to make the top 10. I think he deserves that, and maybe it makes more people think about him as a potential all star next year."
torontoraptors,feout5v,t1_fenule9,1579305908.0,"Kyle can still get the starting slot. There are definite issues with the guys above him in voting. The players and media might not vote a guy like Trae Young (a second year player who is [the league's second worst defensive point guard](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/page/3/sort/DRPM/position/1), leading a 9-win team). They probably won't vote in Kyrie (who has only played 14 games). And, they almost certainly won't vote in Derrick Rose (25 mpg bench player for a non-playoff team, who is also [the league's 75th best defensive point guard](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/page/2/sort/DRPM/position/1)).

So, if we can keep Kyle's voting numbers up, he could sneak into the starting lineup.

And, on that note, just a reminder to everyone, you can vote up to 4 times a day.

boxoffice,feo1tro,t1_fenwk9o,1579294027.0,"The movie wasn't a star vehicle (or, at least, didn't need to be). The concept is what sold the movie, not Tom Cruise's star power. Honestly, I think you could have had a no name actor in there, and it would have outperformed. It was a high quality movie, and would have probably made a great breakout role for a younger actor.

Just thinking back to 2014, if you had a guy like a Hugh Jackman or Michael Fassbender, I think it would have worked quite well. I don't really think it matters if they do their own stunts. Will Smith certainly would have killed it, too (I don't really see Leo fitting into the role, he's not really an action star). Denzel would have killed it in the role. Bradley Cooper was fresh off American Sniper and would have worked, too. Brad Pitt is always another option (he was fresh off World War Z back then)."
nbadiscussion,fenm662,t3_eq38h1,1579287653.0,"No, it shouldn't matter. Those net ratings for Giannis are pretty skewed by the fact that the Bucks have been blowing opponents off the court so frequently. There have been a lot of Bucks games where they are in garbage time super early, Giannis gets to have a rest, and both sides throw their second or third units out there. The numbers that come out of all that garbage time aren't really a great reflection of how important Giannis is to that team."

boxoffice,fen9atm,t1_fen7mk6,1579279771.0,"Yeah, but Mission Impossible is a long running franchise that was established and well loved long before all that stuff happened. As long as they make good movies, the Missions Impossible franchise seems like it will be able to keep drawing audiences.

But, outside of that franchise, Tom Cruise's box office drawing power just hasn't been all that impressive for some time. The only two non-Mission Impossible movies he has led to worldwide grosses over $300M since 2005's War of the Worlds are The Mummy (who no one considers a success), and Edge of Tomorrow (which was still only made $370.5M on a budget of $178M).

Aside from those, his resume, outside of MI, has been littered with disappointments or mild successes like Knight and Day, Rock of Ages, Oblivion, Valkyrie, etc.

I am bullish on Top Gun: Maverick, but outside of established franchises, Tom Cruise's drawing power has been pretty minimal over the past 14 years or so. If you had a different star in Edge of Tomorrow I am sure the movie would have seen a much stronger gross, considering how awesome the movie was."
