PoliticalHumor,ffh3yrb,t1_ffgoj6w,1579922469.0,For some reason I thought you had to renounce previous citizenships in order to become an American citizen.
insaneparents,fff7olz,t1_ffegrxr,1579877786.0,"So a while back in a Nebraska there was more than a few teenagers being dropped off and abandoned at hospitals and firehouses because Nebraska forgot to put an age limit on the law that allows parents to give up their babies without consequences as long as they left them somewhere safe. 

My point being people have a strong ability to be stupid and selfish in tandem."
aww,ffe81fx,t1_ffe7ovc,1579839216.0,"I dunno, my hens are all hand raised from day one so they are sweeties.  The only asshole behavior they have aimed at me is that they will sing an egg song when they know damn well they haven’t laid an egg because they know I’ll come out and check and I am the Bringer of Treats."
aww,ffe29kg,t1_ffdrk3a,1579834820.0,"Alpha wolves don’t exist in the wild. Alpha chickens definitely exist. The pecking order is a very really thing, although it can also be super fluid. I’ve got four hens and three of them switch positions at least weekly. One is quite content to be the omega. I would worry she didn’t get enough to eat except she’s twice the size of the rest lol."
niceguys,ffe07t1,t1_ffdvp3x,1579833332.0,"I do a dozen or so strep swabs a day at work right now. Where there is a will, and maybe a tongue depressor or two, there’s a way."
ChoosingBeggars,ffd2lz8,t1_ffbh57n,1579812189.0,"If she lost her kids it wouldn’t be because of you. It would be because she was not providing them with an appropriate living environment. When in doubt always report. CPS isn’t going to take kids away with no reason. 

I say this as both a mandatory reporter, and a mom who had CPS called on me by a neighbor who didn’t like my kid crying in the middle of the night. They came, investigated, talked to her doctor who confirmed that she had night terrors, and that was that."
insanepeoplefacebook,ffd1thj,t1_ffc3clu,1579811741.0,"I loved being pregnant but yeah, at 41+ weeks I was ready for it to be *done*."
insaneparents,ffc8wv6,t1_ffc7ucx,1579794228.0,"My fiancé did this a lot when we first met, to the point that I had to talk to him about it because it was super irritating and obnoxious. In his case it came from growing up dirt poor and now having a comfortable wage so wanting all the stuff he couldn’t have before."
trashy,ff7xpkf,t1_ff77t9i,1579660839.0,Most of the doctors I know drive shit cars.
aww,ff40zxx,t1_ff3z8xm,1579553187.0,"For us it was based on money more than anything. Frozen fruits and veggies were cheaper than processed foods, so I fed her a lot of that when she was little and we always had more month than money."
homestead,ff40ubw,t1_ff2u0h0,1579553089.0,I put my hens down in the basement last year for less than a day and they totally cleared out the spider infestation.
aww,ff3y926,t1_ff3r261,1579551471.0,Kids don’t know they’re supposed to want these kinds of foods until they have them. My daughter was obsessed with snacking on things like carrots and sugar snap peas and bell peppers until she got to first grade and discovered that other kids preferred things like hot dogs and mac and cheese.
legaladvice,ff3lqr2,t1_ff3ljan,1579543741.0,"Good to know, thank you! I didn’t take the picture after he said that and I was heading out anyway. I try to stay as cautious and polite with uniformed folks as much as possible. Was mostly just curious."
legaladvice,ff3ld8n,t1_ff3crb3,1579543511.0,"Is an airport considered a public place? I ask because a few years ago I was taking a photo with my daughter before she was getting in the pre-boarding line (so we were out in the public lobby as I didn’t have a ticket) and I was told by security that I wasn’t allowed to take a picture in the airport. 

Just curious if he was talking out of his butt or not."
niceguys,ff3ex9u,t1_ff3cwk5,1579539674.0,I met my fiancé on Tinder. We keep joking that we need to come up with a different story though because people don’t think that’s possible.
fasting,ff3djvz,t1_ff3664m,1579538954.0,"No, it discusses the fad in the Victorian Era or pretending to fast for outrageous amounts of times."

trashy,ff32fau,t1_ff2l05c,1579531910.0,"I would not call a 40 year old a young adult, that’s stupid. Hell I’m 35 and I’m not a young adult."
trashy,ff29nkn,t1_ff27dlh,1579497929.0,"A young adult is like 19, 20. She’s an older child. To be a young adult she has to be, ya know, an adult."
insanepeoplefacebook,ff172pq,t1_feyhw3y,1579475899.0,"My kid is in elementary school and they have all their food made my scratch daily. They still get pizzas and burgers and stuff they enjoy, it’s just not frozen and shipped from somewhere far away."
bestoflegaladvice,ff16smh,t1_ff0cyxk,1579475801.0,"I regularly see literal newborns, under 8 days old, and yeah I feel silly asking their parents if they have any allergies but it’s part of my job lol."
ChoosingBeggars,ff08g1p,t1_feznitk,1579466269.0,I don’t know where you are from but look up Just Between Friends. You can sell your baby stuff with them. They do the actual selling so they do take a percentage but I’ve done it several years in a row and it’s better than tossing them anyway. As my daughter has grown up I haven’t had anyone her age to give clothes to second hand so this was a good solution. Last year she even picked out some of her toys to sell and I gave her the money from the sales.
bestoflegaladvice,ff07ji0,t3_eqyf6l,1579466037.0,"My clinic is 99.9% latex free, other than the one or two bottles of Polio vaccine we have. They have a minute amount of latex in the stoppers, I’ve been told because the non latex stoppers don’t work well with the chemicals that keep the vaccine from going bad after multiple draws. (They have 10 draws to a bottle, as opposed to the one and done syringes that you pop a needle in and go)

Honestly even if we didn’t have those and we were 100% latex free, I would ask each patient! We don’t just ask about allergies to make conversation."
Spokane,fepc1pn,t1_fep71gk,1579316849.0,Isn’t No-Li giving them away for free right now?

insaneparents,felfuxw,t3_eppgap,1579221194.0,12 months old isn’t too young for the MMR....that’s when they get it.
bestoflegaladvice,fel0dex,t1_fekzoa7,1579211360.0,"I definitely appreciated the whole system. Even having it go off as we left and scaring the crap out of us, I was very thankful it existed!"
bestoflegaladvice,fekv0jf,t1_fejz6cc,1579208165.0,"Exactly. A hospital will treat them on an emergency basis. A pediatrician would even see them, just couldn’t administer shots or do tests or anything incisive without mom there."
bestoflegaladvice,fekumfh,t1_fek6lty,1579207934.0,"Baby Lojak! I learned about those real quick when they forgot to remove one from my daughter’s ankle before we left the hospital, lol."

Spokane,fec9r1e,t3_eo009i,1578969182.0,There was a centennial trail ass grabber a few years back. I worked near the trail so we had officers coming in and warning us about it. Don’t remember if they ever caught him.
Spokane,feahk7b,t1_fe6mepp,1578948864.0,It always surprised me when it popped up on Criminal Minds lol
insaneparents,fe93spa,t1_fe6mhc3,1578933860.0,Ahhhh you are correct. Brain fart. My brain was saying GBS and thinking gonorrhea was the g. Oops.
insaneparents,fe6e3gi,t1_fe6d57c,1578888198.0,The eye goop is why they do the double q-tip poke to your nether regions in your third trimester. Want to see if you’ve got a symptomatic group b strep (thank you for the correction)  and might blind your new tiny human on the way out.
insaneparents,fe6dybb,t1_fe6av29,1578888085.0,"Speaking as someone who works in pediatrics, I can tell you that they are refusing due to it being an injection and “injections make them cry”. Then being the infant. This isn’t always the reason but it’s the reason I’ve heard more than once. 

These same parents often request oral vitamin k at their newborn visit. Most insurances don’t pay for it FYI. And it’s super ineffective in infants for the same reason they don’t have enough vitamin k to begin with: brand new tiny human gut bacteria that isn’t doing it’s job yet."
aww,fe5qwjo,t1_fe2rfcz,1578873248.0,"I remember after my csection it took months for me to be able to feel my bladder again. Seems so weird. I would really only realize I had to pee when I got nauseous from having such a full bladder. 

Had a similar experience after the next two abdominal surgeries years later (sleeve gastrectomy and gallbladder removal)."
trashy,fe03j1n,t1_fdzpqd2,1578802164.0,Reminds me of a patient from years back. She said she was hearing fireworks inside her head. We pulled out 5 bedbugs from her ear canal.

science,fe01b75,t1_fdzzlsr,1578800622.0,"My daughter was 2 when my dad died, she’s 9 now and really doesn’t remember him. I make sure to show her lots of pictures though and tell her stories. A friend of mine sewed a pillow that looked like him and included scraps from one of his shirts as the pillow-gramps’ shirt."
trashy,fdywx2q,t1_fdx85d9,1578784358.0,I have started just ordering online with Target and using their pickup service. Easier and less chance I’ll impulse shop as I wander the store.
bestoflegaladvice,fdy1s3u,t1_fdwjrdj,1578775117.0,This is why I’m not selling my knitted baby yodas despite being asked to by multiple people. I may casually drop one on a coworkers desk that admired it though. Haha.

PoliticalHumor,fdxo0ne,t1_fdxa6r3,1578771091.0,"Let’s be honest, Spokane is definitely more right wing than it should be. I think it’s more Idaho than Washington most days. I say that having lived here most of my life."
insanepeoplefacebook,fdwxlj7,t1_fdwrchd,1578763220.0,"It’s funny, I have joked that as long as the placebo isn’t harmful, if you think it works then go for it. 

My personal example: I have severe Tympanosclerosis, which every ENT I have seen swears doesn’t cause pain but I highly disagree. One “treatment” that I have found that helps calm the pain is doing hypertonic saline nasal washes. 

There is zero reason this works, except it does. My ENT said well, okay. If it helps go for it."
insanepeoplefacebook,fdw68k6,t1_fdvq8zf,1578755453.0,"Yep, exactly. Peppermint won’t cure either, but it’s a temporary relief until you can see a dentist. 

They actually use cloves after wisdom teeth removal if you get a dry socket. 

I’m willing to acknowledge that some things like that are valid. But I’m also a big advocate that when you need the Big Boys (antibiotics, chemo, etc) you have to be willing to take them!"
insanepeoplefacebook,fdw5hvc,t1_fdu1xdq,1578755309.0,Working in pediatrics I’m learning that boys have weird shit they deal with too. I think women are just allowed to be more vocal about their stuff these days.
insanepeoplefacebook,fdw5ep2,t1_fdulok3,1578755276.0,I have the implant in order to stop my ovulation because I’ve got awful cysts. It doesn’t stop my periods but that’s alright.
insanepeoplefacebook,fdw58cx,t1_fdudhm8,1578755218.0,"Very few would ever do a hysterectomy for that reason unfortunately, not to mention if you do a full one and remove your ovaries then you have to deal with hormone replacement and all that entails."
insanepeoplefacebook,fdtblx1,t1_fdqqnyu,1578714460.0,"Clove oil can help with toothaches. I think I read somewhere that peppermint oil can too. Lavender makes some people sleepy. That’s a benefit I guess. 

That’s all I got. Lol."
insanepeoplefacebook,fdtaf83,t1_fds2tv7,1578714018.0,I wish. I started when I was 9. I’m 35 so I reckon I’ve got another 15-20 years left. Hard to say for sure because both my mother and my grandmother had hysterectomies before menopause.
