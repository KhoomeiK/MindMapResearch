AskReddit,ffkle1w,t1_ffkeel6,1580024687.0,I didn't! I am talking to them
AskReddit,ffkaqld,t1_ffk6kh2,1580019716.0,"That's nice to hear, lol. I honestly feel that way, but it's just one of the many things I feel like ""others"" me."
AskReddit,ffk6baz,t1_ffk4ohw,1580017294.0,"Well sure, but most people in my area like normal people music. Pop. Country. 
I like weird obscure shit... Different types of metal, synthpop, hardstyle.
I don't want to sound all ""I'm NoT liKe OtHeR gIrLs!!1"", but it's kind of like that. If I were normal, I'd fit in better."
AskReddit,ffk49n7,t1_ffk3v7e,1580015370.0,"I wish that were the case. I feel like I'm too weird and creepy to make friends anymore, and I'm just too tired to try."
AskReddit,ffk0ep8,t1_ffjyn5g,1580011996.0,"I hope so, but I was recently in a group ( I guess I still sort of am, but I digress) that was based on a shared interest, and I found out that they all planned to meet up in my home state, and nobody said a word. We've been talking for over a year. We send each other snail mail and little gifts. I thought we were friends, but she didn't let me know. I guess I feel like I invest way more in friendships that the other parties, and I just no longer see a point in trying anymore. I must be pretty annoying and terrible. No point in wasting my breath on people I just annoy and push away."
AskReddit,ffjzy76,t1_ffjy7o6,1580011614.0,I think I come off as annoying and desperate?  I'm not sure though. Like how do you even ask someone that?
AskReddit,ffjwkl4,t1_ffjsqcj,1580008917.0,"Weird stuff... Horror, anime, comics, video games. Most people where I am like normal stuff... Football, parties, music, tv."
AskReddit,ffjk658,t1_ffj6eg6,1580000078.0,"You're very sweet.
Its not a desperate plea, though. I'm just so tired of trying when I know how it's going to end- nobody truly wants to be my friend, and I end up heartbroken and alone. Clearly I am the problem. If everywhere you go smells like shit, check your own shoes, you know?"
AskReddit,ffixyo6,t3_etpwdr,1579985457.0,"I really, truly, genuinely wish I was dead. No more worries about debt, or school, or being alone. I almost *want* to get something like that coronavirus because it would mean for a brief while, people would care about me and my well being. And if I died from it, then maybe someone would think of me fondly."
AskReddit,ffixbk2,t1_ffimboe,1579984996.0,"Same hat. The therapist keeps telling me I need to try to make friends. Buddy, if it were that easy, I'd have at least one by now...
To put things on perspective, I have had several birthday parties where I invite people, and not a single person shows up. I essentially have to bribe people to hang out with me...but that doesn't always work, either.
Tbh, I want to die"
MadeMeSmile,ffhnqf1,t3_etocjq,1579944256.0,Being smooched is so tiring
AskReddit,ffhncb3,t1_ffhic4l,1579943669.0,"I agree wholeheartedly. This isn't about trying to force everyone to believe that being fat is healthy, but to stop assuming terrible things about far people. Stop asking that they're lazy, ugly, bad, whatever. I mentioned this in my comment, but you have *no idea* why someone is the way that they are. Depression and many other things can make that happen. There's no reason to grind people that are already suffering into the dirt, you know?"
AskReddit,ffhn6s4,t3_etnhf3,1579943434.0,"Not necessarily. I think it encourages big people to not hate a d be disgusted with themselves 24/7. News flash to everyone who makes awful comments: WE FUCKING KNOW. WE OWN MIRRORS. Telling us how awful we are because we're fat isn't exactly motivating us towards change.
Anyhow, I do think that on some circles that this sentiment gets warped into that sort of thinking. But for the most part, I think it's more self acceptance and not hating yourself. I mean, you never know why someone is big. Maybe they're disabled. Maybe they suffer from depression. Maybe they have an eating disorder. You have no idea. So learning to accept and love yourself is so important."
relationships,ffe4wmd,t1_ffdxhuq,1579836783.0,"I second this. Growing up, my mom would make """"""jokes"""""""""" about trading my sister and I in for Chinese children because they're smarter and better listeners. Not only is behavior like this from a grown woman incredibly racist, but toxic as well. What an awful thing to say to another human. You aren't a pet. You are a fucking human. I can't believe her dumb ass wasn't screened out for adoption.
Kids aren't your fucking friends. They're your children, and it's inappropriate to have that kind of relationship with them. So her adopting you in hopes of adopting a live in friend is incredibly awful."
relationships,ffe3wqc,t1_ffcziyx,1579836037.0,"Yup. The way he's treating OP, she's just a mom that he can fuck. Be doesn't care about her, he uses her. And honestly, fuck her parents for putting her in such a gross situation. I really wish we did PSAs for high school kids about what is not ok... Fucking grown ass man going after a barely legal adult, gross."

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,ffabh57,t1_ff9waot,1579731643.0,"Yeah, that is a huge dog! What is he, part Greyhound, part horse??
I was concerned about the bread at first because I am paranoid... We had some terrible monster poison a cat of ours with food they left out..."
relationships,ff7pe8m,t1_ff7286p,1579655115.0,"He's likely going to blame the STDs on OP, too. Gaslighting for dayyys....
There is literally no reason for him to be ""friends"" with this girl unless he wants to hook up with her. You are being perfectly reasonable, and he's being secretive because he knows he's being gross and sneaky. He's gaslighting you and trying to flip this around so *you* feel guilty and get off his back. 
You deserve better, OP. Let these sketchy people be together. There are plenty of honest, good people out there that will treat you with kindness and respect."
relationships,ff7omnm,t1_ff7gfn0,1579654581.0,"Maybe that's a good idea, but do you think husband will go if he doesn't think there is a problem?
I don't like ultimatums at all , but maybe that is what needs to happen. Either he goes to marriage counseling and gets help with his alcoholism, or OP walks.
I know the whole ""in sickness and in health,"" bit, but if he isn't even willing to admit there's a problem and says awful things like that to OP, there really isn't much she can do. She can't force him to overcome an addiction. She certainly doesn't have to set herself on fire to keep him warm, doesn't have to spend the rest of her life in a miserable situation like this."
relationships,ff7ndkm,t3_erz092,1579653698.0,"EW EW EW. Wtf. I had to stop reading when  you said she tries to catch you having sex!
That's gross and awful. You know what? Her creepy ass can have him. You can certainly find a decent person out of the billions on this Earth that isn't dating his mom..."

relationships,ff4pmg4,t3_ermcu0,1579569401.0,"I would leave these incestuous nasties be. None of those things you described is normal, and shame on them for blaming their culture. I couldn't tell you a place on Earth (besides maybe Alabama) that brothers and sisters kiss and call each other ""my little b*tch"". Wtf??? Gross???
I don't even see this as a sister problem, but a boyfriend problem. If he really cared about you, he wouldn't do creepy shit with his sister. Don't continue this relationship- you're always going to be second banana to his sister (which, ew anyway), and it's a lot easier to break up with a momma's.(well, sister's, in this case)  boy than try to change him or divorce him"
relationships,ff4opxx,t1_ff38vf9,1579568770.0,"A nasty, sleazy ""technique"" used by gross pick-up artists. They criticize you about what you're sensitive to in hopes of driving you to fix whatever thing they deem ""wrong"" with you in order to make you their perfect, envisioned partner. It's awful and disgusting and cruel. Leave this awful neckbeard. He doesn't deserve you. 
Millions of people on this planet that are decent and will treat you well. This guy belongs in a dumpster."
relationships,ff4ogaw,t3_erisrs,1579568582.0,"I don't have kids of my own, but I can damn sure tell you that of my partner crossed the line and *literally blocked my daughter from entering*, on the threat of evicting her, I would be gone and take the kids in a heartbeat. Your wife is basically driving your daughter to rebel. If you have completely rigid rules and threaten to evict a literal child, not only is she breaking the damn law, but she's just evil. Wanting things to go your way is one thing, but threatening to send your daughter to the streets (in this case, to love with boyfriend until he gets her pregnant, in which case may make him leave her too, putting her in further danger... I will say this, too- her potentially getting pregnant doesn't make her any less your daughter. I hate the terrible mentality that happens to these kids that get pregnant, like they're criminals and bad people or something. A mistake doesn't invalidate her being your kid...)
Just my ¢2. I don't have kids, but this seems like way too far to stay with your wife, to me. Your kids need to know they are lived and supported."

>You need a protective order/ restraining order from this homicidal lunatic! Itwasn't enough that she's a fucking pedophile pervert, stalking someone old enough to be you, she could have killed your kid, OP!! Get angry! Protect your baby! Stop trying to get back someone you never, ever had! She is not healthy, sane, or a good person. She is a manipulative pedophilic monster, and she will stop at nothing to get her way. You need to get that protective order, get cameras, tell your workplace/ husband's workplace/ child's school or daycare that under NO circumstances os she allowed to visit or call, and she is NEVER, EVER allowed to take your kid home. Get new numbers. Change the locks.

>You are mourning the loss of someone you never had, and I am so sorry for that. But you have a family of your own now, and you need to keep your baby safe. If a friend told you that their mother cleaned their baby's mouth out with fucking *poison*, would you tell her to keep trying to have a relationship with them? Certainly not. You are worth so much better, and you are a mom now, OP. Be the parent you needed for little you, and keep baby safe."
