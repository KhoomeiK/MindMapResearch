You guys completely miss the point. It has nothig to do with sexuality or anything. It is simple as they are bored, but any entertainment that is more complicated than beating up something is just too complicated for them and does not give a sense of power. Also in their culture the real power is still not how much you make, what connections you have, what skills you have, but how capable you are defending yourself in the old ways. You know these retards often get into conflicts with each other and other families. They are most likely criminals as well so if someone does them wrong they have to settle it themself ad they can't ask for the help of authorities. Beating up random people shows the others that they are not to be fucked with. So they need a justifiable excuse to beat up someone. Just like football fans. And in their minds it is justifiable to beat up gays and anyone similar. Why? Just cause it is. They don't really bother with why.
It has nothing to do with sexuality. These guys will look for a guy (they cannot go for girls due to it is being immoral even in their 20IQ minds) who they can pick on and provoke a fight with. They'll look for excuses while doing it. But they are really just excuses. They do not care about the victim. They don't want to teach a lesson to the victim. They just want to feel a little excitement and show others they mean business. That's it.
The female version of these retards will provoke fights for her boyfriend the same way.

It is all just entertainment and show off. They'll have fights with anyone. But they cannot, without a way to justify it."

Pulled a handbrake turn in school parkin lot (it was safe) and did a burnout.

Hijacked the projector in the main hall and put meme playlists on it. Then a fuckface told them it was me. I got a lecture about eisking the school's image. Totally worth it.
I was asked to make a presentation of the school due to my presentating skills. I wasn't told that important people would be invited to earn financial support. I thought it would be only for the class. So of course I hard photoshopped everything in it and put a serious face to inappropreate jokes written on the screen.
Wrote a huge ""SEND NUDES"" in the snow on the football field.
Counted the classes I skipped and made sure that I stay in the legal limit every year, but barely. I always got lectured for it. But hey. What are they gonna do? It is totally legal.
Riced a teacher's car with cardboard and duct tape. Making a cool wide body and spolier. The teacher actually liked it and posted it on facebook. But the principal took offense.

It basically everything MLM claims themself to be. And can be done in as little or as large scopes as you want. You chose the items. You chose the hours put into it. You chose your budget to start. And if the price is fair people are always buying. And while it may not promise much when you are just starting out, it can grow over time as you get more experience. You can start by selling the items you already own but never use. Put them on FB marketplace, ebay and some other platforms. Sell them. Then keep an eye out for good deals that you know you can buy and then sell with profit. Sure you'll have to get to know what your field it. Nobody will tell you if an item is good for said purpose. But you only spend as much as you are comfortable with on every item. And I guarantee you there is more money in it than in any MLM.  And you really dont have to build teams and work for any supervisor. Just watch out for scammers and look up the tax laws of your country before starting."

The border was literally moved over people's head while the people had to remain there and later wanted to hold onto the land of their ancestors and their houses.

So naturally both hungarians and romanians claim the said territory as rightfully theirs."
