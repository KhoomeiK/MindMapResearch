Guitar,ff3kx56,t3_ercwqe,1579543237.0,"If you think about that a floating trem on it's own is starting at about 200 (at least from high end brands like Floyd Rose, Schaller or Ibanez), I'm not sure if there is any really good guitar with these specs for that price range.

Personally I'd probably get a low price kind of decent guitar, try to find a used floating trem for a good price and put it in myself.

I know that's probably quite a hard task, but I think it is possible with some research.

Also you then would have kind of a custom guitar :P"

Bass,feghk8s,t3_eo19iz,1579092979.0,"I play guitar for about 12 years now, played bass in a prog metal and acoustic band and sold my only bass (5-String) couple of months ago and I want to get back into bass, but a little more serious. Now is the question, do I go for a [Harley Benton 4 String](https://www.thomann.de/de/harley_benton_enhanced_mp_4eb_lake_blue.htm#bewertung) to properly learn the instrument or do I get a [LTD 5-String](https://www.thomann.de/de/esp_ltd_b_205fm_see_thru_blue.htm) and learn and play with this.

Playing with a pick is not a big problem (obviously), fingers are quite okay but I still need to learn a lot and slapping for me is currently just a thing I can do on rare occasions when playing with fingers.

As I play a 7-String guitar, for some of my own songs (and songs I want to learn as well) I definitely need a 5-String at some point.

EDIT: Maybe I'd even go with the [HB 5-String](https://www.thomann.de/de/harley_benton_enhanced_mp_5eb_lake_blue.htm) :D

EDIT 2: Maybe I should say that my main music style is metal, but I also want to go more into pop, especially with bass"
