Which would require a Republican to cross over to the Democratic party without any significant distraction or blowback that costs votes.

And then there's the whole front end of the process..just imagine if a Democratic candidate approached a Republican to cross parties and join the ticket..and they laughed in the candidate's face and ran to the press it would be a disaster.

Or when someone like Joe Liberman left the Democratic party for the Republican party...it's seen as very tribal and all past ""principled"" party-line decisions are brought into scrutiny.

There just isn't a circumstance where this notion makes sense or is practical...let alone survives the scrutiny of our media and general population.

And then yeah, there's the whole problem of one party being a bunch of high school debate team nerds, and the other party flirting with actual Nazi behavior..

science,feemnxl,t1_feek49j,1579036852.0,"I'm starting to qualify as an older dude. Stoner culture was big when I was in high school in the 90s. The taboo of marijuana was pretty potent, and yeah it drove a lot of burnout rebellion.

Today? I actually smoke more than I ever did in high school. Daily in fact, often twice a day. Morning and night.

Except now, it's more like a cup of coffee or a nightcap. It's just a thing to consume to change my headspace like so many other consumable options out there.

I think the taboo going away will absolutely kill the drive in some people...but in others, it just means I'm not in the shadows and get to do something that used to feel risky in a much more boring ass adulty way.

Imagine if Coffee was under prohibition for decades..people would slam 10 cups any chance they had because of scarcity mindset. But with it everywhere...no one even bats an eye that you're ""juicing up"" before heading in to work or taking an extra bump in the afternoon when the effects wear off.

This is where I see weed going. Into the realm of normal, moderate daily use that is so boring as no one is talking about it.


In other perspectives...I'm just super fucking happy people are abandoning the old bullshit that weed is what makes you creative. That was tedious AF, and absolutely untrue."
