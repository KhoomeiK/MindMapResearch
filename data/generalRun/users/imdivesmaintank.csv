funny,ff5w9qd,t1_ff3qzps,1579612379.0,I don't know why you're being downvoted but you're absolutely right. kids aren't able to properly digest cow's milk until about one year old and it takes a toll on their kidneys.
aww,fes0hwt,t1_feq2zp0,1579360192.0,"He's asking why don't they just say ""my dog""."
funny,fenfkp8,t1_fenc5w3,1579283619.0,"but 37/55 of the letters, so 67%"
funny,felkqdb,t1_felkjr8,1579224513.0,cuz fuck him. that's why.
modernwarfare,fekofyl,t1_feiov2l,1579204289.0,which one of you dead motherfuckers said that?
modernwarfare,fegr11v,t1_feggo05,1579100510.0,some people can't be asked to change their kill streaks constantly
amazonreviews,feelbfx,t1_feejz73,1579036069.0,hurtling would be my guess
aww,fedlsus,t1_fed66m0,1579014681.0,humans are just the most intelligent animals
MurderedByWords,fedkrmb,t1_fedjrdb,1579013976.0,there were also plenty of gospel books that didn't make the cut for the bible and they are far different from the four in the bible.
modernwarfare,fedk7fd,t1_fedbuff,1579013594.0,the reward isn't even fair for the person who gets the kill credit.
modernwarfare,fecc4b1,t1_fec5y06,1578970499.0,are you me?
videos,feaffzl,t1_fe8wm83,1578948049.0,Plex won't get shut down anymore than windows media player will. They both serve local or privately-shared media. One just does it much better.
buildapc,fe8srir,t1_fe7hzs4,1578930283.0,"I feel like googling ""best"" anything just results in a bunch of paid-for blog posts."
MurderedByWords,fdhyih6,t1_fdhrapx,1578432484.0,lol sure but now I've seen way weirder!
MurderedByWords,fdhcei7,t1_fdgm947,1578419871.0,"growing up, my dad used to eat grape nuts (a cereal) with apple juice instead of milk. it was the weirdest thing (to a child)."
aww,fdhbyhn,t1_fdh2v72,1578419653.0,MICHAEL!

BattlefieldV,fde8xpy,t1_fddng1m,1578333774.0,same but to BF4
modernwarfare,fcxxvdr,t1_fcxbajr,1578072045.0,"if all cheaters did it for attention, subtle cheaters wouldn't exist. now this guy is clearly not a subtle cheater, but there's no telling whether his only motivation is attention."
modernwarfare,fcxxjq6,t1_fcxh4sj,1578071881.0,that (the need to ban in waves) is only true for automated detection bans. banning people quickly based on reports doesn't do anything to help cheat-makers as their users keep getting reported until they stop being obvious cheaters (the technical method of cheating doesn't affect reports).
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fcvp3dt,t1_fcvnw2h,1578006914.0,then tell me the logic you're providing b/c I can't figure it out
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fcvm249,t1_fcvi7iz,1578005010.0,"I told you nobody has to work the job, which you responded to with ""most people have to work a job"". If you agree that nobody has to work the job, then why not just say so? You made it sound like you disagreed because ""most people have to work"". I agree that most people have to work, but that doesn't mean every possible job is filled."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fcvi25n,t1_fcvd8cq,1578002531.0,"by this logic, open positions never go unfilled because somebody always has to work them? may as well drop the pay down to minimum then I guess."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fcv6gs0,t1_fcv2qdb,1577995634.0,"nobody else HAS to work the job. it's not slavery. if nobody thought it was worth the money to stand up all day, nobody would, and they'd have to raise the wages or change the job responsibilities until that changed."
modernwarfare,fcupc4d,t1_fcu9bul,1577985807.0,I'm pretty sure it's just negativity bias more than anything.
gifs,fc4dndm,t1_fc395o0,1577413634.0,I am confused because I could swear I read that humans (or maybe primates) were the only animals that could be tickled in the rough way (e.g. fingers digging into ribs).
pcmasterrace,fc1czow,t1_fbzc4zq,1577315072.0,Ctrl alt delete also does the trick
