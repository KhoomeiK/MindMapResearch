[Early base WIP with Boat](https://i.imgur.com/jYUVlvB.png?1)

This is pretty early stages but note that the walled paddock serves as a second layer of walls.  All walls are double layered to help deal with manhunters, or the errant raider who breaks from the pack.

The second layer will have sandbags at each external door, which is a first defense against sappers, and generally useful sniper spots.

[An ice-sheet map with more sapper defenses and full sniper positions in outer wall](https://i.imgur.com/X2dHy6Z.jpg)

Additionally the original walls are incorporated into the build, so I really have three layers of walls here.  There are also emergency melee chokepoints at each cardinal direction, which could be filled with animals while we bug out on the boat, if need be.

Eventually I'll have two automated defense platforms/forts in the harbor to cover my escape/deal with errant drop podders.

And you can see a false entrance with traps, which will be at each section of wall.  Once they break through teh first, they'll often go for the ""open door"".  I like to make them follow the line of the wall so it only takes up three spaces or so.
