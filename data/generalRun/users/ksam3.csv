He looks for concrete things to make himself feel like he has a handle on things, like a fancy briefcase, or a new expensive executive office chair, etc. As things get increasingly out of control he flails around looking for *anything* eg: ""If I had a way to control these employees better everything would be fine. Yeah, it's the employees. I'll get a speaker system and then I'll be in control""

I worked with a person (not directly-they were a different division) who was *never* qualified for their position, and *never* learned how to do it.  A few months in, the requests started: I need to have a separate office built (done); I need my own clerk (done); I need a special web page and program (done); I need new office furniture (done); fancy laptop (done, then never used); fancy software (done, never used). She thought that the accoutrements of this ""professional"" position would magically make the *work* of the position happen.
