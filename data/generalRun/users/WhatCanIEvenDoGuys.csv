My dad has been huge on Fox news for ever and it has gotten worse since he retired and found Facebook. There is no talking to him about any of this. The ironic part is that he called my brother and I brainwashed for being Bernie supporters.

He committed a crime by withholding the aid. It wasn't his job, that's why it was Giuliani the Ukranians spoke to and why all someone blew the whistle in the first place. He abused his power by using the office for personal gain to win an election. How is that not meddling with the election? All of the facts from the Biden investigation make it clear that he did it for personal gain, not in the name of foreign policy. This trial is about that, not what anybody else may have done."
