worldnews,ffn2vl9,t1_ffmyra0,1580061432.0,"The Ben Elton novel ""Stark"" describes a dying Earth, and the only people who are able to get off it are the ultra-rich, who build a giant rocket complex and have been preparing to do so for some time. They want to start a new life elsewhere, but their businesses and companies are the reason most people are in the shit. 

I won't spoil it in case you or anyone else ever end up reading it, but there's an inherent problem when you decide that the only people who can be saved are those who caused a big chunk of the issues in the first place."
worldnews,ffmurtd,t1_ffmrovw,1580059173.0,"My great aunt in Cornwall (who's in her 90s) just won't accept that Brexit is anything other than sending brown people back to countries that half of them have never been to in their life. She's delighted that ""all them nig-nog shops"" (a favourite phrase of hers) presumably, in her world, now have to close down next week and people marched to boats. 

There are Brexit-voting members on her side of the family who have tried to explain that it's not just getting rid of anyone not white (though she'd much prefer everyone not from Cornwall to fuck off, whatever their colour), but she's not having any of it. Her doctor isn't white, her diabetic nurse isn't white, the guy who does her garden and his dad, who've done her garden for about 20-25 years, they're not white. 

Her vote effectively cancelled mine out. There are many people who think like my great aunt and your mother in law; the people who think the ""Great"" in ""Great Britain"" means ""AWESOME"" when it means nothing except as a differentiator between Britain and Brittany; lit. ""this bit we own that's bigger than the Brittany we also own"". Unfortunately, there are some of those around. As time goes on they'll mostly die off, but the effects of their votes and policies stay."

worldnews,ffmq4ar,t1_ffmim8v,1580057805.0,"This is basically what's happened with the people I know who supported Brexit in the last week. 

They voted for it because of lies, more of which have come to light and yet the reality of the shit they *they themselves as low income people living in the North* are wading into is absolutely irrelevant. I've seen people demanding apologies from family members for the three years of 'messing around' now that they've 'won' and it's all been signed. 

The fact that it's an enormous pile of shite and fuckwittery is irrelevant. Universal Credit is screwing up their situations and those of other family members, we're basically going to be bent over by most nations going for a trade deal - but it's okay, because they 'won'. 

Goodie goodie gumdrops."
