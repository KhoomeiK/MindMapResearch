Cote de nuits was apparently having a better 80s but this one opened up through the night and was pretty special.

Definitely not Rudy juice. Much cheaper than what he'd go through and the cork was a dead giveaway of its age."
wine,feiwggs,t3_epe9is,1579149088.0,"I'm not a taste notes guy, but got this in an auction for my spouse's birthday as it's her birth year wine we opened for her birthday!

Surprisingly fruit forward and hints of cherry, raisins, tobacco and little bit of leather. Almost no oak or tannins. 

Not an amazing grand Cru but still held up really well. 

What's crazy is it's from Acker auctions- yup the shady auctionnaier from Sour Grapes. Fuuuuuun!!! :)"

Google it, you may like what you find."
nba,fdkwloc,t1_fdku519,1578512660.0,"The system fails if we don’t hold commitments we made including paying debt. 

However, you can vote to make the system work for the people and not greedy private corporations. One of the major 2 parties wants to privatize everything and profit from your health problems. The other party wants to guarantee healthcare for every citizen like all other developed nations. Vote for the one that will help you, not the corporations."
GoogleMaps,fdcbfg8,t3_ekgl8y,1578270928.0,"Can you elaborate what you'd use this for?

Navigation?

Just curious?

Getting to shelters?

Knowing this will help me get to the right folks who are thinking about these things (like the Crisis map)."
aww,fcwsvfb,t1_fcws1qz,1578036241.0,Makes me happy to hear this. He's a 12 year old gentleman and would appreciate this as well :)

wine,fbfeeys,t1_fbfebvz,1576808567.0,Aww. Love him. First growth cat right there.
