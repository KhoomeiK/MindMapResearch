hockey,fgnyc2c,t1_fgna0gb,1580955586.0,Which I think he plays that role perfectly though for our team. Especially since we will probably be losing zad in expansion
nfl,fgnxm3u,t1_fgnkfne,1580955127.0,I stayed off any football subs for like a month after the SB that shall not be named. I’d see one thing about football and it’d ruin my day. Why the fuck we care so much as fans is absolutely beyond me
nfl,fgmfqsn,t1_fgme1o3,1580923625.0,Well he was also dealing with an absolute statue for a QB for half the season. His play calling was much better when lock and even Allen were playing
nfl,fgkgek2,t1_fgk7yrs,1580864957.0,I like him
nfl,fgj8sx7,t1_fgis7p4,1580839237.0,But they don’t have a great defense. They swung way heavier than their weight division and were lucky that shanny is a choke master in SBs. They were getting eaten alive by that run game and shanny decided to throw the ball while ahead. That and mahomes getting a record breaking deal is going to take a lot of pieces away wether it be on D or O. Now I think mahomes is good enough to make mediocre pieces look great but that D will suffer.
nfl,fgj42m4,t1_fgie0bx,1580836593.0,It was two years. And people here act like elway can’t put together a roster. He went all in and we got a SB. Yeah these last four seasons have kinda sucked but the future looks bright at least. Minus having mahomes in our division. At least he looked human in the SB
nfl,fghbhlb,t1_fgh8lv7,1580781115.0,It was my biggest fear after we lost 48. Was manning wasn’t going to get one and his last appearance would be a blowout in the biggest game of the season. After winning two years later though it felt like we’d have never gotten that team to do that if we hadn’t been blown out so it’s definitely not impossible just more improbable
holdmyredbull,fgght7l,t3_eyckw2,1580762161.0,That’s crazy
falcons,fggfjue,t1_fggdzx7,1580760814.0,And yellow. So super similar to gold
nfl,fgfz3t0,t1_fgez86l,1580750743.0,Sorry bro was wasted last night. But losing to them for three seasons now has really brought me to hatred for that team and fanbase
nfl,fgfz1dw,t1_fgez98s,1580750702.0,I was drunk last night but yeah no fuck the chiefs. I can’t ever bring myself to cheer for them
DenverBroncos,fgevbc0,t3_ey2s70,1580711368.0,Sick down vote
nfl,fgepr77,t1_fgep4hp,1580705916.0,I can’t yet. I’ll be over it by tomorrow but tonight I drink to forget. FuKC
falcons,fgepc4p,t1_fgek5cc,1580705555.0,Chief colored streamers... so like. Red?
DenverBroncos,fgeoume,t1_fgeopyi,1580705144.0,I don’t get why there isn’t one and why they can’t keep one thread up so we can all talk about it. Now there isn’t even a fuckin thread up to talk about the game.
