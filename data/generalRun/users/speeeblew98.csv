Deleting the pics takes minimal effort and would make this a non issue. I just truly couldnt imagine risking a relationship I care about over a physical reminder of past men.

The only person you're hurting here is yourself... while you're trying to salvage this relationship, you're losing time that could be spent improving yourself. An important part of adulthood is learning how to be alone - how to be comfortable with your own company. Since you've been dating since you were 15, you haven't really had time for that. And even if you don't want to do that now, you're missing the opportunity to date someone else who actually is into you, and just you. Believe me I know break ups are hard, they are brutal.

I just don't really agree with your comment because you're making it out to be like he would be doing something wrong and should just stay so as not to pressure her - he did everything right, stated his preference of not having children and used birth control.

It really depends on the couple and guests I guess but the point is is that $100 is a pretty standard gift and there's no need for comments about it from other people. And I want to add that it's not like every guest is expected to give at least that much, at least not for non entitled people lol"

Of course no one is obligated to give up parts of their body if they don't want to, but I just find it selfish. If you're dead, you aren't using them anymore. Burying organs when they have the potential to save like 6-7 lives just seems wrong"
