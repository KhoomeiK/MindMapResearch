All meat animals on farms would probably have to be killed anyway since they can't be released, and all those farms would lose their incomes. There would be so much deforestation needing to happen to support new crops growth, and a lot of work done on previous grazing ground to support crops. There would probably be a dramatic increase in pesticide runoff and issues. Those in developing nations who rely on meat for their diet would all probably die.

It doesn't consider the risk of introduced crop species and their impact on new environments - and yes, this can also be an issue locally, but I am a big believer in the return of traditional agriculture and crop sources. 

And as for soy for cows, this is an issue of education I think. I'm Australian, and when I buy meat, I make sure it's grazed and local (on this point, I think more cattle farmers here should be changing to roos).

I know fish is a great fertilizer, but again, it's all bi-catch and you have no control on what species you're sucking up - common bait fish is fine, but I'm not ok with throwing critically endangered species onto a literal fire.

I know some species are free drifting. In fact, my local beaches are covered with cornflake seaweed at the moment. And whilst there's a lot that could be collected from here right now, I don't think it would cover a whole lot of fire area. Fire blankets work by smothering the fire - so you'd need to have proper coating of seaweed for this work. 

Another issue with seaweed I just thought of it that many plants in Australia use fire to reproduce. Have the ground covered in seaweed may effect seed germination. They would struggle to break thru the layer of seaweed, or may not even germinate since the soils would be much wetter than if we used water which would evaporate quickly."

AskReddit,fdsiixt,t1_fdsh1r9,1578703402.0,"Honestly that sounds like a lot of work and time to get probably not much seaweed.

Plus you'll probably be getting a lot of crap and debris too. And seaweed isn't all floating around, it's attached and growing on substrate so simply sucking up won't do much I think

As for eating it - remember it wouldn't have been treated so it'll probably still have gross ocean things on it. And each species is adapted to a particular diet. These animals have minimum salt in their diet so a sudden increase might cause some damage. And since your plan would be using anything you suck up, you might end up with toxic plants too.

AskReddit,fds5fib,t1_fdryr1l,1578694763.0,"Simply put, climate change has increased the average temperature of the country, reduced rainfall, and therefore dried the country out. This has created a lot of fuel for the fires to spread quickly and far, and burn extremely hot. Climate change also affects weather systems, so there's an increase of dry storms. This creates lightning, and lightning sparks the fuel creating fire. Since there is reduced rainfall, there is also a lack of water to be fighting the fires with so they are harder to control once they begin."
AskReddit,fds4qfv,t1_fdryssl,1578694315.0,"Camels are an introduced and invasive species in Australia. There are no native hooved animals in Australia, and our ecosystem doesn't cope well to hooved trampling. Think about kangaroos for example, they have soft pads on their feet like dogs.
Camels (along with horses, pigs, deer, goats ect) rip up the top soil, destroying it, and this allows for invasive plant species to spread and outcompete native plants for space and nutrients (most Australian plants, especially those in the arid areas where the camels are, are very slow growing whereas invasive weeds are quick to establish and dominate).


Camels are also massive compared to native Australian fauna, and therefore consume a lot. They are outcompeting natives for food. And since they eat so much, are not allowing for these plants to recover. 


They also consume a large amount of water. As Australia is in drought, this is taking it away from the natives also. 


We are culling the camels (and many other invasives) to help out natives survive. We didn't realise it was a mistake to introduce them, but now we have learnt and are taking action to correct this. It may seem cruel to kill them all off, but leaving them will impact so many other native species. A cull is also beneficial to the camels actually, since we haven't planned to destroy the whole population, just reduce it. So the issues I've mentioned - shortage of food and water - will have less pressure on the remaining population too. However, I do believe it would be best to destroy the whole population but unfortunately national parks and wildlife services simply don't have the funds for that.
