WTF,ff3aob0,t1_ff32apg,1579537507.0,"LPG vehicles outside of fleet vehicles are pretty much unheard of in the U.S.

and I say that as someone who knows two people with LPG personal vehicles."
science,ff1fifc,t1_ff1ej7h,1579478420.0,I didn’t say it didn’t. What I’m saying is the choice between 100 days of being wet where the coldest day recorded was 50 degrees Fahrenheit 50 years ago and the Midwest in January it’s a no brainer.
science,ff1cy9j,t1_ff1cbh3,1579477578.0,I absolutely do not blame a homeless person for attempting to carve out a life that is easier. Getting rid of the weather as a worry most of the time is a huge burden relief.
science,ff1ckwl,t1_ff171oq,1579477512.0,It isn’t just young people. The majority of Americans. Something like 30% of us have less than $1000 in our savings account. Literally any minor thing could drain that enough to put without rent.
science,ff1bg3w,t1_ff19w68,1579477146.0,Eh. Quite a few of the homeless in Hawaii are mainlanders who spend the last of their money getting there.
science,ff1azp9,t1_fezsmnk,1579476964.0,"There are also parts of the homeless population that are hidden from public view surprisingly well. Homeless kids who are homeless with a parent or parents are a great example. Homeless kids are hidden because in most places if the state realizes they are homeless they will be removed.

delusionalcraigslist,feywmvt,t1_feywho7,1579451446.0,It is cheaper than using CLR as you can get white vinegar in huge 2 gallon bottles for a few bucks. The bar would be the hardest part to clean. YOu could probably soak towels in vinegar and wrap it.
delusionalcraigslist,feyw928,t1_feyuxlk,1579451243.0,"Unless it is really damaging the material rust can almost always be cleaned up. A cheap way for these would be to get a tub big enough to hold the largest one (at least) and some white vinegar. Soak it (50/50 vinegar/water) for 24-72 hours and any remnants should wipe off for the most part.

I should add to this that once a material begins to rust it becomes susceptible to more. You may want to clear coat it with spray paint to coat it.  You can also use mineral oil but kind of defeats cleaning them up at all as they’ll be oily."
instantkarma,feyr49e,t1_feybzot,1579449584.0,Fair enough it probably isn't the best word to use as it may imply that we aren't nearly entirely responsible for their extinction. For awhile though... we ate like homeless kings.
instantkarma,fey4cb3,t1_fey1ky1,1579440717.0,Be careful. We Americans contributed to the [extinction of the passenger pigeon by eating their delicious delicious meats.](https://www.audubon.org/magazine/may-june-2014/why-passenger-pigeon-went-extinct)
WinStupidPrizes,fey3pz9,t1_fexk7ci,1579440409.0,Who hasn't wanted to put their face in a big plate of garlic-y hummus and just slurp it up? Lucky girl.
aww,festgk0,t1_fesofvy,1579368873.0,Like they fear the introduction of pathogens the horses have no exposure to. They don’t want them to all die from horse flu basically.
LifeProTips,fepsqiv,t1_fepi60t,1579329992.0,I say they probably have diarrhea!

trashy,fei2ldb,t1_feheazn,1579128902.0,I don’t but I have a lifelong friend who does. I don’t even notice it... it is just part of who she is.
aww,feeacmc,t1_fee9snl,1579029669.0,"How do you bring up that they are a child of a violent rape? If you skip over that then they’ll ask why their bio-mom doesn’t want to see them. If you tell them they have to deal with not only be the product of said rape but the product of a rapist.

instantkarma,fe2xbil,t1_fe2qxxb,1578843916.0,Now think about if you’ve ever been in a bathroom with automatic flushing. I have to imagine that even with others being in stalls we are just coated in their poo particles.

MadeMeSmile,fe2tv51,t1_fe2qyz0,1578842742.0,"That’s like looking at chemo and saying is there anything other than poison.

Should the first step be prescription medication? Probably not, but it does serve its purpose."
MadeMeSmile,fe2t78n,t1_fe2mvio,1578842590.0,For my ADHD coffee actually makes me sleepy (all caffeine) which is a not uncommon thing among sufferers. I could drink a 32 oz cup of light toast and then take a 4 hour “nap” no problem.

mildlyinteresting,fe2mokm,t1_fe26bsp,1578840612.0,If food is food why not buy all your food from a dollar store? It’d certainly be cheaper than a market.
mildlyinteresting,fe2m8l7,t1_fe1xgzp,1578840427.0,Cocktail sauce isn’t ketchup and mayo. It’s ketchup and horseradish.
UpliftingNews,fdxd5yu,t1_fdx645q,1578767618.0,He probably did. If not you can also use your pants as a flotation device.
LifeProTips,fdnfy13,t1_fdnbi5h,1578584971.0,"Adoption/foster care is run on less than a shoestring budget in the US. Most money goes to providing wellness services, transportation, and a myriad of other things that are unfortunately far more important than a duffle bag."
LifeProTips,fdnfldc,t1_fdn76ii,1578584759.0,Suitcases much like brand name toys don’t last long in storage at adoption agencies. They get snatched up almost immediately by workers for kids I. Their caseload. If a kid is being moved they’ll grab it and take it to the foster parents/kid.
