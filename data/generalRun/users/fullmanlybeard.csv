ElizabethWarren,fgmfpmb,t1_fgm3g6c,1580923605.0,"True, but what many people fail to realize, back in 16 and now, is that a lot of these voters ARE choosing between Sanders and Trump. So you literally might be talking to someone who could vote for trump if they are talked down to or if you minimize their concerns. 

Dems need to be more welcoming/less hostile to conservative values. There are a lot of so called independents who have very complex and intersecting political ideologies. Dems for too long have tried to be monolithic in their dogma. That’s gotta change if we are going to truly become a big tent party and not just pay lip-service to the term."

ElizabethWarren,fgj13nu,t1_fgite9h,1580834974.0,"It is helpful because you have to recognize there is a problem before you can fix it. Dems are more often than not willing to paper mache over problems in the party. A republican is justified in saying the Dems suffer from tremendous hubris. In 2016 the Republicans has a much better caucus than we did too. 

Humility and humbleness would take us a lot further in the red states and in general. Hell for a long time we just wrote them off entirely. And I hear it all the time now, “there is no way we could lose to trump”. There is a long list of republicans who thought the same."

In my case I had one who was a wise older professorial type. He had a lot of wisdom, but ultimately he knew how to get me to unlock my own doors and I trusted him to help me explore the real reasons I was holding myself back and depressed/anxious/etc. In my case, being adopted had caused deep seated issues. Coming to terms with those was the best thing I'd ever done. As I'm getting older I am realizing that I have some other things that need addressing. TBD if I can come to terms on my own or seek therapy again. 

Good luck!"
fatlogic,fgbiln5,t1_fg73fa2,1580662488.0,What they obfuscate is that they themselves got where they are by making incremental changes; both in their fitness and brand.

1200isplenty,fg7csza,t1_fg7ba0c,1580589408.0,"Drinking water with every meal is not an extreme. That is the baseline. It’s the only beverage you need to survive. Everything else, juice, soda, etc. is optional and unnecessary. I’m not saying nobody should enjoy these ever, but their prevalence and the acceptance that 1-2 per meal is normal and good for you is ridiculous.  Soda is a modern invention and it has led to many health consequences. Source: I was addicted since I was a kid"

intermittentfasting,fg6y6ys,t3_ex9go7,1580579619.0,"I weigh myself twice a day. Once in the AM, once in the PM. I like seeing the difference. Typically about 2lbs. I know if it's more that i'm probably going to weigh more the next day and need to eat a bit lighter. 

That said, I have noticed that when I was getting into a lull it did build a lot of anxiety that I was trending up rather than down. All those weigh-ins during that time might have actually contributed to the problem and kept me from making better choices.

I want to start weighing myself every other day, or maybe once a week, but I will also miss the daily affirmations and data points to track my progress. However, perhaps I am short changing myself by focusing too much on the number rather than intuition with greater intervals between data points."

loseit,fg6nfze,t3_ex2w1n,1580572479.0,"The last time I tried to lose weight this happened to me. But what I realize now is I was “trying” but hadn’t committed. I was using nutrisystem and trying to run but really my working out was an excuse I was giving myself to eat more food. Then I convinced myself that nutrisystem tasted like garbage and cost a small fortune so having been on it three months I understood what proper portions were and quit. Within a month or two I was back up to my original weight and had given up on the idea I could ever do it. 

A year went by and my doctor put me in statins and gave me the talk. I let a whole year go by again without losing a pound. When I had seven pills left and no refills I decided to get serious and commit to losing weight. No more trying. 6 months have passed my BP is normal again, I’m down 45 lbs and I feel great. 

That was with no working out. Simply controlling my diet with IF and CICO. It hasn’t been perfect but the progress is what matters. You can do this!"
progresspics,fg6l5vr,t1_fg6cgjm,1580570862.0,Hah my scale is funny that way sometimes too. If you pick up a towel or two step on and then step back on without it should clear the anomaly. If not get a better scale! I can see improvement in your stomach and thighs. Well done!

I wasn’t working out until this month. Started on a weightlifting routine and I can already feel results. I never have done this in my life and despite having great natural strength I had noticed a big decline in my abilities over the past 8 years from being super obese. I wish I had done all of this 10 years ago. 

Curious why you take all the supplements you listed? It seems like a lot of people feel those are totally bogus. I’m on the fence about it but would be interested in your take."
