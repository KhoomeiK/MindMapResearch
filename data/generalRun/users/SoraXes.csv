iamatotalpieceofshit,fe3d01m,t3_enmxva,1578848173.0,"Weirdly been seeing more shit about Thailand on the front page lately. Bribery to the police is everything here. Traditional taxis and motorbike taxis pay the cops in that territory or precinct in order to do business in that area solely, which was part of the reason why rideshares law have been rather slow to implement. Bars have to pay a monthly bribe because alcohol sales laws are fucking fickle. It’s all bullshit. Hell! Our alcohol import company has to lose a few crates to keep the import department happy! Or even some nosy pigs that decide to come in once in a while to ‘check our documents’ but will not leave until a few bottles were given out even if they didn’t find anything.

Pigs."

I do still think that their portrayal of his homosexuality is terribly negative though, as in it is portrayed in a negative light. His issues stem from his homosexuality (like how the music and mood be more grim)."
todayilearned,fcqcuhg,t1_fcq48p7,1577883475.0,Yeah I would give BR a 7-7.5 and Rocketman an 8.5-9.
todayilearned,fcphtye,t1_fcpgypm,1577864711.0,"No worries man. The advantage for bohemian rhapsody was that it came out first, and arguably Freddie is a more idolized figure in music. The movie however was flawed in its portrayal of Freddie.

By all means, It's a fantastic movie and great acting and performance by all but the timeline and storyline is heavily altered to portray Freddy in a positive light due to his bandmates contributions to the movie. Although both movies had fictional characters, Bohemian Rhapsody features them in fictional arcs like that one music producer.

Most glaring of all is the portrayal of Freddie's homosexuality. It's portrayed as if his homosexuality was the issue rather than Freddie's rampant debauchery with both men and women.

Rocketman's approach these ideas by exploring the overarching theme of finding love, seeking acknowledgement, and coming to love oneself which ends with accepting who they are in the finale. Also it's not restricted by the pg 13+ rating of Bohemian Rhapsody.

Both are great movies but Rocketman is better."
todayilearned,fcpg6d8,t1_fcpf012,1577862548.0,"Amazing movie! Personally, I think it's a more honest rendition than bohemian rhapsody."

AskReddit,fco316w,t1_fcmxlxf,1577823124.0,"Currently working upper management in Bangkok and here's my 2 cents. Sex is taboo in Thai culture but the sex industry here is huge, and not only sex tourism but among local men. It is not uncommon to hold meetings after a quickie at the massage parlor.

Personally, I don't participate and prefer to meet directly at the meeting destination. There's no peer pressure involved or anything... It's just this weird culture of adultery among Thai males. Multiple times have I met business associates whom talk openly about the many side chick's they have."
