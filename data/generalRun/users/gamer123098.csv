wildhearthstone,ffcwu6i,t3_esohyl,1579808928.0,I've found it inconsistent. Sometimes I lose to it if I don't have some early curve but that would be true vs any face deck. It often comes down to how often you can roll murk eye on rando generators

politics,ffcqds6,t3_esro3o,1579805035.0,The system is so badly broken that there is no saving it now. It's now supreme leader Trump. The republicans have decided to ride this one out and put themselves before country. Truly a dark dark time in America.
boardgames,ffccjiz,t1_ffcbx92,1579796512.0,I agree that you can get a much better well oiled machine if you customize a deck but the players in my group wouldn't want to put the time into doing that step. They'd rather just open the box and play. The key thing is that my wife actually likes this game despite it being a bit cut throat at times which is a plus in my books.
boardgames,ffc9ylo,t3_esrrxh,1579794892.0,Instead of deck construction I've just jammed all the cards into single monstrosity decks made up of all expansions. Has worked ok so far.

GameDeals,ffc2qir,t3_essbrp,1579790076.0,I bought this recently and have been playing it. If you are using a PS3 controller like me it is very helpful to pick up the mod that switches the button prompts that match your controller instead of it defaulting to xbox. If you are using a ps4 controller I hear that this isn't required since it's already supported.
todayilearned,ffc2c5k,t3_esqil9,1579789782.0,Dairy Queen has a disgusting amount of sugar in their products. I ate it for years until I got older and started to actually look at the nutritional info. I knew it wasn't going to be healthy or anything but I was shocked at how unhealthy it was. Another one was cinnabon. Again knew it was unhealthy but actually seeing those numbers on paper turn these treats into a once a year type thing.

politics,ff6uvsx,t3_eryydr,1579635373.0,"I think this puts it nicely:

 *We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is  getting smaller, and all we say is: ‘Please, at least leave us alone in  our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted  radials and I won’t say anything. Just leave us alone.*

Everyone is looking out for their own ass and they don't see this as something that they need to protest about. It will take them away from their TV, the Internet, etc. Nobody wants to risk losing their job for taking time off. Everyone just hopes to make a living long enough so they can retire and die in peace."
hearthstone,ff6u8zz,t3_erxa8j,1579634998.0,I still prefer evolve. The real power was evolving several minions in one shot. Heck I'd probably be inclined to like unstable evolution more. Evolving 3 times would cost only 1 more mana but gives you the ability to stop when you highroll. This doesn't provide a way to mitigate a low roll easily. Meh

worldnews,ff664t3,t1_ff656lj,1579620052.0,Yes I agree that it is possible that an extinction level virus could be engineered. Has something like this ever been created? Who knows. Countries have been messing around with viruses for a long long time but I have no idea where the research stands today. I would like to think even if someone had created something like this it would be safeguarded well enough to never make it to the wild.
worldnews,ff6514z,t1_ff5tv7p,1579619293.0,You say sloppy but I clearly they get the impression that they don't care anymore. They've got their hooks in deep into the USA and with that they can move with impunity.

worldnews,ff63w7g,t1_ff60f5u,1579618490.0,A bit exaggerated. Won't ever wipe out the planet. Might put a dent in the population but some sort of random virus like this wouldn't be a wipe humanity off the map type thing.
