I guess I can speak from the perspective of a relatively suicidal man. Life sucks. I'm in constant agonizing pain, I'm unable to hang out with people like others can because I'm an alcoholic and so much of society revolves around drinking, and nobody really gives a damn what I think or what's going on with me. I struggle to find reasons to continue living, and I know (from experience) that even if I were to tell a health professional all of this they won't care in the slightest.

Sometimes I talk about this online. I'll talk about becoming an alcoholic and a drug addict as a child during and following the severe abuse I sustained by my father and his friends and why that lead me into a lifetime of depression and other mental health issues. I talk about my paranoia, crippling phobias, and how I now only ever feel like myself when I'm not sober, and so I haven't been ""me"" for years. Usually, I get told to man up, it's not that big a deal, and from the especially spiteful, that my problems don't matter at all because women and minorities have it worse. I've long since exhausted the people in my life I can talk to who'd care at all. I'm just not important enough.

That's how a lot of these men feel, I think. We're poor, we're hurting, we're unimportant, and nobody gives a damn what happens to us. Why shouldn't we just end it? It's not like It's A Wonderful Life where it turns out our death would lead to a worse world; there is no outcome other than a positive one.

My mistake - I'd assumed since most maps are still free and not covered in watermarks and patreon links that they existed. Pardon my stupidity.

Do you know why I didn't mention the quality or anything? Because when I see multiple watermarks it's no longer a factor. It's not a map, it's an advertisement. Why should I comment on the quality of an ad? Do you stop in every time a site has a ""vaccines cause aids, click here to read why"" ad and comment about how good the article's writing is? Do you comment on youtube videos to talk about how well the delivery of their fourth ""be sure to subscribe to epic battle app iphone game"" plug-in ad?

I don't expect the map for free. I expect that the map is either free or paid. I'm willing to support a good creator. Someone who plasters their ads everywhere isn't a good creator. I expect free or paid, not freemium adverts. There's a huge difference and you must be blind to not recognize that.

>Massive compromises. 

If they had massive compromises it wouldn't be optimization. Optimizing requires minimal or no compromises, otherwise it's not worth it. It's done all the time as poor code is replaced with better code.

>Reduced quality

There are many ways to use different assets without reducing quality. I can make an identical image take up either 2MB or 100MB without any loss of quality whatsoever depending on what additional information is left in it. Go ahead and take a picture of an apple and export it through Photoshop, max quality, as a PNG. Compare it to the camera RAW. The quality is exactly the same but the filesize will be a fraction of the original because it's removing unseen and redundant pieces of data resulting in the same output for a lower requirement. That is optimization.

>Reduced audio

Same for that. There is no system on Earth that can tell the difference between BWF and WAV or max quality output ATRAC/AC3. No system, and especially not your headphones at home. And yet the filesizes are different? Wow. How's that possible? Optimization; removing redundant and hidden data without changing the end result.
