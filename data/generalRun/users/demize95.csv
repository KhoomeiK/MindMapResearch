I don't know the details of the contract here, so I guess it's possible they did have some sort of incentive for on-time completion (bonuses rather than fines would work a lot better here, for example) but they probably don't need them here. 10 years is a lot of time and a lot of money paid out to the contractors and workers through it, and they'll look pretty good if they come out with only the delays being discussed here."

That was also a long project, probably 5+ years (though I was only there for a year or so towards the end, until a couple months before substantial), so they definitely had enough time.

Without caller ID spoofing, their caller ID could only be the phone number assigned to the trunk, which you probably don't even want any calls going to. Call centers are another common example, where you could have many different customers contracting out your call center, and you need to show the right caller ID based on the customer. Caller ID spoofing allows you to do that as soon as the contract starts, and allows them freedom to quickly change contractors if you're not living up to their expectations.

Most ""highways"" in Canada are just divided roads used for a significant amount of traffic between regions."

It's going to be terrible at first (which is why I don't have one; I just bought a Surface Laptop 3, and I was very tempted to consider the X but I'd also just seen some reviews on it) but if it sells decently it'll show other manufacturers there's interest. Once other manufacturers start making Windows devices with ARM, it'll start to see a lot more support from everyone.

For most things people want, it's just going to be adding another build target and compiling your software twice. There may be some changes needed to make it compile (in rare cases) or fix bugs (in most cases, probably) but it's a relatively minor amount of effort to make yourself available on that platform."
