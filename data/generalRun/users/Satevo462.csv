videos,femfszi,t1_femepgm,1579253249.0,"Honestly, that's kind of a tough call. But mostly because of me. I have anxiety issues, and when my phone jolts me out of bed with a ridiculous heart rate, I don't care who's in trouble, because I'm in trouble now.

But it's not that I don't care. If I was in my car at the time I would be like Ned Flanders looking for the kidnapper. But when it's 3 in the morning and I'm sleeping peacefully, that Amber alert sounds like an incoming nuclear bomb. And it's very hard to go back to sleep after a noise like that.

But like I said, it's still a good thing. Society doesn't care about my anxiety issues, and when it comes to a kidnapped child, it shouldn't."
