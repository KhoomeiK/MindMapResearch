interestingasfuck,fed43a0,t3_eoc7ws,1578997825.0,My grandfather worked for Culligan(a water company where I'm from) and he had one of these on his fridge as well as a real one next to the fridge for as long as I can remember. My sister and I would always act like we were filling our cups up with the magnet one when we were younger. He passed away when I was in high schooland I don't know what happened to it. Thanks for helping me remember that.

GetMotivated,fclqbro,t1_fcldp7m,1577753885.0,She was acting all weird and being short for like a week not really saying much or being her usually self. And when I was there on Christmas I saw his name in her texts so when I got the opportunity I went through it. I know it was shitty but I had to know and I don't regret it.
GetMotivated,fcjjt96,t1_fcjidvj,1577690436.0,Never thought about it like that. Thank you for that. It's a rough situation we're going through but if you need someone to talk to you can inbox me. I'm not the best at conversation but I'll listen.
GetMotivated,fcjg6ie,t1_fcjehin,1577686406.0,The memories are the worse part of it. I thought we were doing just fine...the healthiest relationship I've ever been in honestly. But I guess everything happens for a reason. Silence and music are probably the only things helping right now. Thank you so much I appreciate it. :):)
GetMotivated,fcjdknq,t3_ehdo84,1577683910.0,Broke up with my girl on Christmas when I saw she was talking to this guy she had gone on a few dates with before me. Telling him that she thinks about him everyday and that she misses him and wants to rekindle things after she leaves me on new years. I saw that and just walked out didn't say a word to her just left her place and proceeded to burn every single bridge between her friends and family. It sucks but sometimes it's all you can do for yourself. Now I'm focused on leaving my hometown to start a new life somewhere else
AskReddit,fc2p8yi,t1_fc2omc8,1577369885.0,"Damn that is really shitty of him.. I've never understood this mentality of talking multiple people when you are in a relationship. Just be with that one person. But I guess that's too old fashion for most people.. I'm sorry you went through that it's difficult leaving someone you care about. 

What makes it worse is she is divorced because of her ex-husband cheating on her with their daughters teacher. And she would constantly talk about how fucked it was and how it made her feel like a terrible person. But she wants to turn around and do the same thing to someone else because she didn't like that I was ""emotionally further"" into our relationship than she was..."
AskReddit,fc2nxci,t3_efqzp6,1577368604.0,Finding out that my girlfriend well ex girlfriend now has been talking to some guy she met on tinder before we started dating and telling him she's gonna leave me after the first of the year and that she hopes they can rekindle things. We'd been together 8 months.
