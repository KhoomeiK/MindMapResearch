1. You start off by being a part of the community, which it sounds like you have. You join a youth group. If your youth group is small, see if you can organize meet ups with other youth groups to give you an opportunity to socialize with other LGBT people. Being a part of a LGBT group is essential. There are ""gaymer"" groups or PFLAG groups.

2. Get to know a bunch of them. Hang out. Do stuff. Go to movies. Bowling. Have parties. Get to know *people* in a group setting.

3. If there are guys you're interested in. See if you have a connection. A ""connection"" is usually that a conversation is easy. You both want to hang out together. You both make each other happy just being around one another.

4. Now here's the least risky way of asking someone out:

*""Hey Liam, we've been friends for a bit. I really like hanging out with you. I could see this going somewhere more if you're interested. I'm totally okay just being friends but I wanted to throw that out there to see what you thought? ""*

It gives you a chance to backpedal without sticking neck out too far and risking a friendship. 

They can say *""Uh, no I don't feel that way about you""* and you can be *""Nah, it was just an idea. If you're not feeling it. I'm fine with just being friends""*.

5. Eventually, hanging out enough in a ""more than friends"" way, you might want to make it exclusive. ""Wanna be my boyfriend? "" Then talk about what that means... relationships aren't defined by one global set of rules.

Apps are basically a virtual community so you're skipping a few steps. They generally focus on sexual encounters so ""getting to know someone"" is a bit secondary. I honestly, don't recommend it for someone first dating. 

Also, at 14, you've got a lot of time to get into dating and relationships. Enjoy hanging out with your friends as a group. Dan Savage recommends that you work towards the person you're becoming. Work on the things that make you interesting to another person (you're passions and interests). The more you're defined as a person, the more other people will take interest in you.

The Last Jedi made 65% of THe Force Awakens. Any company would be very concerned if a product took that kind of nose-dive. It wasn't a perfect film.

The reason Rose had less of a presence in TROS is because her story was integrated with Master Leia's scenes at the base. She was to have a greater presence in the story but because the CGI integration of the pre-recorded clips of Carrie Fisher didn't work in those scenes, Rose's scenes were left on the cutting room floor. Abrams commented as such. It's unfortunate. I liked Rose. It's not a conspiracy.

I acknowledge that there's a lot of misogynistic hate for TLJ. The reasons the man-babies hated the film, I liked. I like Rose. I like Holdo. I like Rey. I like Poe's fall from grace even if I felt it was a little heavy-handed. 

> erasing any signs of the intimate physical relationship the black man and white woman displayed in both previous films

Hey, TLJ erased any sign of an intimate relationship between a black and white man by introducing Rose as a love interest for Finn in the first place. Let's not ignore the heteronormative erasure of TLJ, thanks. As a queer person, I am frustrated by the bullshit they gave us in TROS doesn't make up for a real opportunity to have a great fun queer relationship. That's on TLJ thanks. Let's not ignore it's flaws because we happen to be putting it on a pedestal.

TROS is a *safe* movie to be sure. The same way that TFA was a safe movie. Be repeating characters and themes and living for cheap fan service moments rather than taking the greater story arc in a new, broader direction. I wanted to see the revelation of a new beginning with Rey leading the way to a new Galaxy where Force wielders evolved into something new.

>  because it seems to be ethically bad on purpose just to impress racists and sexists.

This is an over-claim. I doubt Abrams nor Kennedy give a shit about impressing a bunch of man-babies. They care about box office returns but if they really concerned and didn't want to take any risk, they wouldn't have taken risks in the first place. Rey would be a straight white boy. 

TROS is just an attempt to appeal to fans and they spent a lot of time back-pedalling on the things Johnson broke in the TLJ which genuinely makes it a bad movie. 

Killing Snoke and giving him no backstory was dumb. Giving Rey no backstory was cheap because it was transparent. ""I can't think of who she'd be a kid of so I'm going to assume it's NO ONE! Aren't I clever!"" Fans had been dreaming and speculating about these backstories for ages. Johnson dismissed that. 

THe Holdo maneuver defeats the purpose of deathstars in the first place if you can just FTL asteroids into planets. Why spend all that money on a space station that keeps getting destroyed by rebels when you can destroy planets on the cheap. If hyperspace can be weaponized, then there's no point to even ""A New Hope"". 

The hyperspace tracking would have been a better plot device, in TLJ, if it had been a spy among the Resistance rather than a machine because it would have given Holdo a reason to keep her plans tight to her chest and give a reason for Poe's failure. It wouldn't have been this unnecessary Deus Ex Machina.

TROS has a lot of great stuff in it. I loved Luke and Leia's training scene in the film. It was such a great moment in the film. Touching on something I would have liked to have scene in a post ""Return of the Jedi"" movie. I like Rey's relationship with Ben Solo. I like his redemption arc. Getting rid of Snoke in TLJ means that there was no greater evil that Ben could fulfill his destiny and become the Skywalker and bring balance to the force. I love that he's a reluctant villain. Because of Johnson's decision to kill off Snoke arbitrarily they had to stitch in Palpatine at the last minute and correct film. The Symbiotic relationship between Ben and Rey touches on an idea I wish they'd explore more. 

I liked a lot of Rian Johnson's themes. *IF* he had been giving the trilogy from the beginning, it would have worked but The Force Awakens wasn't pointing in that direction. The Last Jedi feels like a film that is disrespecting and subverting the first film and the Star Wars Saga in which it's built. The comedic elements of THe Last Jedi are irreverent to the the narrative lore that the original films built.

* Luke tossing the lightsaber over his shoulder
* Drinking blue milk from the udder of an animal
* Chewie eating a Porge in front of another Porge
* Poe ""holding"" for Hux
* The physical comedy fo the caretakers and Rey

The only one that kind of sticks is Luke tickling Rey with a leaf because it kind of mirrors Yoda's relationship with Luke. The original star wars movies had a much lighter touch in comedy and as such made for better scenes. The Last Jedi was ham-fisted.

The reality is that the sequel trilogy failed purely because they plotted as they went and didn't have a cohesive narrative from the start. 

Fuck the man-babies... but the Last Jedi is a bad film. Honestly, the sequel Trilogy just sucks over all. I don't have to like a movie because a bunch of man-babies hate it. It can be a bad film even if it's a bad film for other reasons than why a bunch of racist, misogynistic man-babies believe it's a bad film."

Recently there was legal ruling that First Nations rituals and culture weren’t violation of a white woman’s religious rights because they weren’t required to participate but in order to counteract some of the cultural genocide of Canadian history, we need to make sure schools are inclusive of First Nations history and culture.

This should be clear that I was singling our a specific individual and asking them questions. It does not suggest that I was only asking questions on this post on the whole as you claimed I did.

> Personal question, what would it take for you to admit you’re wrong?

What aspect? That I was wrong it was cultural appropriation? CA does demand that the appropriator has something to gain. The term seems broadly applied when people mean that someone is culturally insensitive. The Washington Redskins are clear appropriation.

I think the first comment that called out appropriation was fair in saying “you might want to think about this”. 

I can admit that I am wrong. But hopefully if you see that I am trying to respect you by answering questions honestly, that you’ll do me the favour and answer mine:

Do you think it’s fair for a white person to use the “n-word” if their black friend says it’s okay?"
characterdrawing,fenjrv6,t1_fenhgzx,1579286199.0,I didn’t “scream”. I didn’t even capitalize my comment. There is no “scream”. That’s the hyperbole you employed. Try again.

> What are your motivations? Why are you telling people how to feel about their own culture? Why are you trying to stir dissent amongst people who had no problems with each other?

My motivations are to educate about  cultural appropriation because education is important. Go back and read my very first comment. It’s not raging or screaming. It’s trying to be chill and offer some insight.

I have tried to only educate on the subject. I haven’t told any one who identified as First Nation how they should feel about the work. I have asked them questions for clarification because I want to reconcile what I have been told is oppression of First Nations groups and what is said here. 

I’ve been told that nations headdress’ are of cultural and spiritual significance and that they should be treated with respect.

I am not specifically trying to stir dissent. The fact that my initial comment got some positive reaction suggests that some people agree with me. 

I can’t satisfy everyone. I can only try."
