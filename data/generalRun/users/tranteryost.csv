My ac leaked into the passenger floor board (over a month until I figured it out!) so I called around to a couple detail places and explained what happened and asked how they could get rid of any existing mold and keep new mold from growing. 

Car Toys had the best answer, once everything was dry and fixed, they did a hot water extraction on the passenger carpets to remove any mold growth and then put an ozone generator in the car for about 6 hours to kill any spores. Seems to have worked great!"
