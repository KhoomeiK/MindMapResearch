Hes my only friend. I might be 29 but he better out live me or were fighting.

Thru all the hospital visits. Jail stays. Psych wards... he never once, not one single time; gave up on me.

He always says... failure is not an option. And to fail one must give up entirely.

I built a deck with him, took us like 2 months. But goddamn it's beautiful and I hope every day he walks out to his hot tub time machine he remembers that I love him.

Surround yourself with the happy and successful. If you cant do the aforementioned which is the short path to success.
Start from the bottom and grind your way up.

If you dont like either of those ideas just start a business. Literally everyone has a side business or a side hustle. Figure something out and grind it. 

A guy behind my parents is a multi millionaire from selling snacks outta vending machines.

Started working minimum wage. Bought vending machine
Kept working. Kept buying. Kept trying. Eventually he wound up with 300+ machines and 5 box trucks and 5 drivers to refill the machines on a near daily basis.

Stop looking at things so shittily. 
Perception of reality is your choice.

As in. You choose how you perceive reality. 

If all reality is to you is a dead end... just find something that makes you smile. that's the point of life anyways.... happiness."

depression,femu8ox,t3_epy9c8,1579269741.0,"Ayy I carved ""fuckup"" into my leg and made enough cuts to go from hip to ahout mid thigh on both legs.

I wanted to die so bad. 


The problem was that I saw everything as a negative. And now I try and look at it different. 

If you look for defects in a house long enough you'll eventually start to see nothing but defects.

But if you look for the good part of the house, and work out from there, learning to take the ""problems"" in stride, your living experience will be more productive and more progressive.

People are all born broken. Some of us realize it and some of us never will.

You know you're hurting and you're manifesting it in physical pain when really you're suffering an intolerable mental pain...

Doctors are great resources. Psychiatrists and psychologists, i personally had luck with hypno therapy and shit, even a well versed life coach can help.

Theres also AA NA And my favorite CA.
You dont have to be a drug user to go there for support. They're not trained individuals but I'll be damned if they aren't the most grateful bunch of humans.


And if you cant manage to make it out the house... call that 1-800 suicide number that Logic raps about.
I used it once and it really helped.


This is a temporary problem. Please dont use a permanent solution to a temporary problem.


Idk. I used to believe nothing would change... and now here I am. Bipolar as fuck. But not manic anymore because of meds. With a little counseling and medicine I went from a total shitbag to a half decent dude.

You got this bud"

thatHappened,fekxq3m,t3_epprkf,1579209773.0,"I was showering and heard what sounded like a circle grinder grinding something, but lo and behold it's my schizophrenic uncle trying to break into my apartment because I stole his 2 stair ladder. First off I'm over a foot taller then he is, I dont need a step stool. But second, why drill my lock out? Those things are expensive..... what a cunt. 

And by ""they"" I mean my uncle and his personalities. Theres uncle drugs. Uncle scream. Uncle cookies and coffee. Theres uncle pizza. And theres uncle mentally unstable. And every once in a while... maybe 15 minutes combined in my life... I've had ""caring uncle""

He heard me crying after a bad break up and brought me a dank ass pizza and sixer of beer and I thought we were gonna bond as soon as the pizza hit the table he started screaming about the washer machine being broken [turns out he left like 3$ in change in his pocket and broke the machine]

Your best bet is to go to AA/NA and try to find a psychologist who's licensed and legitimate and safe. That way they really know the grind."
