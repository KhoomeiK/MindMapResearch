""We don't want to be part of the EU"" and ""Britain deserves a say in what happens in British waters"" aren't mutually exclusive. I don't want the US to fuse with Canada but if they try to make claims on who can or can't fish in shared water without including us that's not going to fly."

They released a game you can beat in 4 hours with no post game, few side quests, and almost no exploration. THEN they had the balls to not include all the pokemon that they already had animations for. And I still saw people buying double packs with both games in it. Seriously? It's frustrating."

LifeProTips,fd7yo5u,t1_fd7y0di,1578211896.0,Read better. Nobody gave any proof whatsoever that it's illegal to record in your own home when renting it out. That's all I said. I dont know if it's illegal.

>Go go a hotel and rent from them and have everything but the bed recorded. You OK with that being done? Do you think that's legal?

>But you're OK with it. You understand.


Do you actually think about what you hear or do you just automatically contradict? I have said many times that I don't agree with recording people in rental properties but I understand it. It's not hard to comprehend so I can't tell whether you're being purposely obtuse in order to keep arguing or if you actually dont understand the basic idea of understanding an opposing opinion that you disagree with. Like are you an idiot or just overly argumentative?"
LifeProTips,fd7hd3v,t1_fd7gts2,1578204532.0,">You're OK with the bad stuff being done and would do the bad stuff if you were the other side.


This is how I know you're stupid.... if I'm ok with the bad stuff being done from both sides then how am I a hypocrite?



Seriously though, if you read my last comment and thought I contradicted myself in any way you need to sit down and think harder about what I said, because you're clearly slow. You can think something is wrong while also understanding why it's done. That's not being a hypocrite, that's understanding different points of view. It's a basic skill that anybody should be able to do. The fact that you can't possibly wrap your head around understanding an idea you dont agree with is a problem with yourself, not me"
LifeProTips,fd7gfnh,t1_fd7g6kz,1578204096.0,"I didnt say I'd record the people renting from me, just that I understand. It's not a contradiction. Would I want people recording me? No. Would I understand them recording me? Yes. Do I think it should be legal? No. Do I understand people doing it if it's not illegal? Yes."
LifeProTips,fd7fv1c,t1_fd7fiq4,1578203832.0,"Is it really that difficult for you to understand that different people have different motives and would want different things? As a consumer, no I wouldn't want cameras in a place I rented. As someone renting out my property, I obviously want to make sure people aren't fucking with my house for no reason and would like proof should they damage my house since I know I'll be stuck with the bill if I can't prove anything. Those are obviously contradicting ideas but they're also both reasonable."
LifeProTips,fd7cej0,t1_fd761sd,1578202314.0,"No, of course not. But I also understand the difference between a company renting a space made to rent and a person renting their house. I wouldn't want to get recorded in an airbnb either, but I also wouldn't want people to fuck my house up. I didnt say that recording people without their consent was ok, just that I dont know if it was illegal and that I'd rather share the video to get my shit paid for than let them get away with it just so I could continue renting on airbnb"
LifeProTips,fd6orko,t1_fd6k5s8,1578193904.0,"I dont know if it's actually illegal for an airbnb, but the 2nd part of your quote just means they breach airbnb terms. I'd rather get kicked off the site and never rent out on Airbnb again than pay for damage some asshole caused in my house."

It's said to the point of being cliche, but they literally see politics as a zero sum game. If the government stops working for the people who don't deserve it then that means it must start working for everyone else. They've been convinced that the only way to get yours is to stop others from getting theirs, like neglected dogs fighting for food."

You can make up scenarios in your head all day about what they MIGHT do, but what they actually did was check your doors then look in the window. They could be a delivery driver at the wrong house, an extra pushy jehovah's witness, or a concerned neighbor who thought they heard trouble.

PublicFreakout,fcufijl,t1_fcu9c1f,1577979718.0,"I'm the person you replied to. I get what you're saying, but it's a really bad analogy and doesn't help your point. 


It's like the original person had said ""if you ever get attacked by a bear, respond like this to keep your odds of survival the highest"" and you replied with a sarcastic ""if hunters targetted bears who have attacked people bears may have learned not to attack humans by now"". Yea, we have a way to go with equality and better public attitudes would probably reduce the rates of general violence against women. But your analogy is bad because giving advice is not blaming in any way while saying ""other men made the criminal think beating and kidnapping women is ok"" is clear blame. You just said it wasn't but that just contradicts your original point, it's not a clarification. Self defense = ways to defend yourself after the situation has started so you're most likely to survive it. Saying that the attitudes of 50% of the population encouraged him to act that way = 50% of the population are at least partially the cause of / to blame for the attack."
PublicFreakout,fcu36tg,t1_fctxp09,1577971183.0,">saying women need to scream louder and fight harder than this woman did is implying that it might not have been so bad if she did or that what happened to her could have been prevented



Yes, that's exactly what they were saying. And that's not victim blaming. Saying this woman could have handled the situation better is not blaming her for what happened. Nobody is claiming it's her fault because she didn't scream enough. But if she was louder, still refused to comply after being kicked, and actually tried to hit back she has a much higher chance of escaping this ordeal alive."
videos,fcoju59,t1_fcob7bq,1577834035.0,"That's the worst part of the sub imo.

starterpacks,fcnbu0y,t3_ehrjow,1577808302.0,"I'm not sure you can really say people ""miss the point"" for idolizing them and I'd argue the people saying that are the ones actually missing the point. Sure, some people think these characters are great for doing what they do, but most people idolizing Tyler Durden or the Joker or Rick understand that they're bad. That's the whole point of their character. They aren't supposed to be analyzed and enjoyed based on their morals, they're avatars that let you experience ""the joy of shattering the grand illusion"" without the consequences and guilt of all the bad stuff that comes with it. You can really resonate with and respect the philosophy of the Joker or Rick's selfish nihilism while also understanding that killing people is wrong and that they aren't good guys. 




The only people who I think actually misinterpret their character on the whole are cops with the Punisher because that's a dangerous mentality to have. Your average person can fantasize about destroying universes or blowing up credit card companies and it's fine because they'll never be in a position to do it. Even going on a killing spree like the Joker would require more than just a split second decision. But cops point guns at criminals every day. I dont want the guy who's 1 finger twitch away from ending a life to feel like a powerful murder vigilante."
AdviceAnimals,fcn6oi5,t1_fcn1cc9,1577804679.0,Redditors have the stereotype of being pseudo-intellectuals for a reason. Give dumb people a shallow understanding of something complicated and they'll form bad ideas. Give lots of them a platform to share those ideas and a voting system that rewards watered down groupthink and they'll start parroting the ones that sound the smartest or that line up with their existing worldview/prejudices.

todayilearned,fcl4q25,t1_fckwly2,1577739766.0,"OP is right, the guy you replied to was talking about precision of a measurement, which is the same but just another way of looking at it. High precision just means your results are close to each other. When talking about the precision of a measurement that means that the values of any given measurement are very close together (aka, to more decimal places). For example, if you measure a distance with a ruler and with calipers both may give a result of 1"", but the ruler is less precise because a dimension that measures as 1"" on a ruler could really be anywhere from 15/16"" to 1-1/16"". That's a cluster of 1/8"" where all the results show the same value. Calipers are more precise because if you measure 1"" you know the actual length is somewhere between 0.999"" or 1.001"" (assuming you have a precision of 0.001""). That doesn't mean it's accurate though. Calipers are a higher precision tool than a ruler but if the calipers aren't calibrated they'll be further from the correct answer."
