interestingasfuck,ffglgui,t3_etftbc,1579908978.0,"Mars is not in the green zone of our solar system, and will NEVER be terraformed by humans!

It is actually a useless piece of rock to us.

In my opinion it is a ridiculous waste of money to even *try* to put man out there. 

All we need of physical matter to study the planet can be fetched by robotic means.

THE MOON however, should be 'biosphered' so that it can serve as a life raft for life on earth - in the face of the inevitable catastrophe that will strike. 

The only planet humans will EVER terraform, is the earth itself.

And that would have to happen from the moon."

PublicFreakout,ff5kc83,t1_ff59lfc,1579597005.0,"The version I've heard on the 'first film ever' is the famous 'bear on the beach'

A woman sits on the beach and a bear is approaching her from behind. It gets closer and closer while the woman is oblivious to it.

This started the movie audience shouting at her to get away, and apparently some people ran up to the screen to save her!

'The bear on the beach' is today an aknowledged term for that specific tool(a danger, unseen by the character, but seen by the audience - approaching) in dramaturgi/screen writing."

This often a problem with individual sports - the director and the camera director are in the dillusion that a bunch of close ups gives more action and drama.

Well, it doesn't!

To fully appreciate the speed with which these guys move you have to see them in relation to the surroundings. 

And to show this - the cameras have to pull back somewhat...

This one was especially bad!"
