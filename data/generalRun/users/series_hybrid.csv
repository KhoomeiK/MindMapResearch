When Tesla was in the prototype phase, they planned on using a 2-speed, because in order to reach their goals, they would have to use very high amps, and the controller components were not capable at the time. Then just as they were having problems with the 2-speeds they bought, there was a breakthrough in the efficiency and amp-capability of the IGBT's that are the on/off switches (to the motor phases)  in the controllers.

Once the controller could handle the amps, they went to a larger single motor with no gears.

In a conversion, it's not horrible to use the stock transmission, it's been done with manual trans and also CVT/automatics. However, when you are building a new vehicle, a transmission is a significant cost, plus a point of repair and wearing-out. Many auto transmissions wear out by 200K miles, and an electric motor can run millions of miles.

Instead of an engine and a transmission, a large motor costs less and lasts longer. Also, using a large motor with no transmission is cheaper and longer lasting than a medium motor and a transmission.

That being said, a 2-speed planetary trans with reverse (like the 1920 Model-T) would be a good fit for a motorcycle."

I recall reading about crack dealers who have an under-age ""runner"" picking up the cash from a car, and the car pulls down a few houses where another under-age runner takes a crack nugget from the window of a house to deliver to the car. 

Cops see this evolution of tactics, and they SWAT-ted the supply-house. they break in with a no-knock warrant to try and catch the holder before they can flush the crack down the toilet. The house only needs a few seconds of warning to flush, and one house had a front door mounted so it looked normal from the outside.  It opened inwards, and the side that looked like it had the door-knob actually was lined with many hinges. (The knob was fake, the door could only be opened from the inside).

As the door-buster banged away on the hinge side of the door, it took quite a few seconds to bust the door down. They were still arrested, because one of the customers was an undercover cop, but they didn't capture the ""big stash"".

You open the inner hatch and get in, I think you could comfortably squeeze four adults in there. Shut the inner hatch.

The pressure of the water outside is always more than the air-pressure inside, which is shirt-sleeve comfortable at one atmosphere. You open a valve a little bit and water starts to come in. There is a space for the occupants heads that is shaped like an upside-down cup. You fill the water to the bottom edge of the cup that your heads are in. 

So, the space is now 90% filled with water, but the water is not pressurized, so you cannot open the outer hatch. The inside is about 14-PSI, at 200-ft, its about 100-PSI on the outside.

There are two gauges, one for the inside, one for the outside. You begin pressurizing the head-space with air until the two gauges are equal (your ears will pop a lot). When the inner pressure is equal to the outer pressure, you can open the outer hatch.

If you have a scuba tank, now is the time to put the mouthpiece in, and go out the hatch.

Once the escape chamber is empty, The inside of the submarine has a hydraulic handpump that can operate the outer hatch. You close the bypass valve and begin pumping. When you can't pump anymore, the outer hatch is shut.

At this point, the headspace is pressurized to the outer pressure, so you only have to open a drain valve for the water to flow out to a drain tank inside the sub. Then the air pressure inside the escape chamber needs to be vented to the inside of the submarine.

Once you do that, you can open the inner hatch. Sea pressure will keep the outer hatch shut, even if its not latched. Repeat as necessary.

Off the top of my head, the Bugatti and Koenigsegg can both easily pass 210. I also think the Porsche Carrera GT does that (mid engine 10-cyl).

Wind resistance increases with the square of a cube. Meaning it takes four times as much power to go twice as fast (*I'm sure I said that wrong, but look up bicyclists breaking top-speed records behind a car with a huge wind barrier, so the bicyclist is pedaling in an air pocket).

The reason LeMans is so respected is that the cars dont just compete head to head, they have to last 24 hours.

The GT40 kept blowing up the 289's, which had light weight and plenty of power, but couldn't last 24 hours. At top speed, they had better fuel consumption, so the plan was to beat Ferrari by having fewer fuel stops.

Sometimes you deliberately let the other guy pass you, and sometimes you pass him. But...if you run the top RPMs all the time, the engine will not last.

Here's one if many reasons. Smaller bearings have less friction for higher RPMs. Larger bearings last longer. There is a subtle balance you have to choose and risk. The main crank bearings on the commuter 225 Chrysler slant-6 are the same large bearings from the monster 426 hemi. 

The GT40 won when they switched to the 427 side-oiler. It had worse fuel economy, but it had enough torque to run a different set of gears that gave them the top speed they needed at a lower RPM.

They won because they held together for 24 hours, and the Ferraris blew up trying to keep up with them.

A modern Bugatti or Koenigsegg must last years, not just 24 hours. So they both have power near or over 1,000-HP..."

I dont know enough about electronics to make a proper suggestion, but with the increasing police over-reach in China, and also the US, it seems like somebody could find a way.

The police get very angry when they see a camera being used (or a phone cam), so the trick is to secretly record and have the image and sound preserved somewhere if your phone is confiscated and broken."
todayilearned,fegy1ou,t1_fegm6r4,1579105070.0,"I agree. One of the items mentioned was that a stock advisor might recommend that you sell a certain stock in your portfolio to generate cash to buy a ""hot new stock"" that the stock broker suggested.

First, unless the stock was in a tax-isolated trust or retirement account, the sale might incur capital gains taxes. Secondly, whether any stock goes up or down, the sale and purchase incurs brokerage fees. So...she felt it was a conflict of interest.

Brokers who constantly buy and sell are doing what's called ""pumping"" to make sales commissions. Lots of activity, even if the stocks that were pumped never change value.
