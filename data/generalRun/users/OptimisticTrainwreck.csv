Their Grandmother had died about ten years earlier.

Turned out her brother had raped her when she was younger and continued on until the birth of the eldest cousin which was a result of that. The Grandfather, adoptive/non bio, agreed to say that she was his when she was older and the family all kept it a secret.

They'd likely need to apply for a different kind of Visa if their Visa is dependant on being in/at Uni. What is their home country? If you check the foreign office you could see how the government classes that country to see if there's any help for people from there residing in the UK.

Have a meeting with the Uni, students union, find a lawyer - you'll need professional help most likely and more help than this can offer you.

It's just that sometimes there's no point, there's nothing special an American Doctor Who could offer. With shows like sitcoms it works as different countries have different types of humour so the American Office is more upbeat and the jokes punch up whilst the UK Office is more dry and sarcastic.

Edit: spelling"
AskReddit,ff95bjm,t1_ff94nk0,1579705198.0,"It wouldn't. A key point of the show is the Britishness and an American version is just pointless - there doesn't need to be an American version of everything.

Every other country doesn't demand remakes of American shows because they understand and accept media comed from a range of countries and it's stupid to refuse to watch anything from outside of yours.

An American version would be pointless as it wouldn't add anything, just change things needlessly and would end up being a lazy and stupid cash grab.

You said it was low budget which put you off, so then the improvement would be a higher budget - not making it American.

Edit: A similar American show would be great, I mean specifically an American Doctor Who. An American UNIT show would be interesting but unlike comedy where jokes and context don't work to international audiences I'd say for the most part Doctor Who translates pretty well; guy with a time machine picks up companions and they go on adventures."

TheSinner,ff913kn,t3_erwzug,1579702189.0,"Depends on *how* like Sinner you want, these all reminded me of The Sinner in one way or another:

The Missing reminds me of The Sinner so much, two series with different but similar cases and the main character/investigator - both of the mysteries were really well done with the second series being my personal favourite. Definitely worth a watch!

Definitely Safe, One of Us and Quicksand - these were pretty similar to Sinner for me and probably my favourite shows from what I watched last year.

For criminal profiling/investigating Mindhunter although this is pretty different, follows the early days of criminal profiling and has real serial killers

Unbelievable is meant to be good but I haven't personally watched it."
todayilearned,ff8wjh2,t1_ff8vql8,1579698431.0,"Her name was [Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Bell) Bell, she was abused a lot and that led to her killing - she was released when she was older and given a new identity. There's one documentary on YouTube I've seen passed around but haven't watched it myself and a few books.

I believe her identity got found out whilst she was with her daughter, 12/14 at the time and the press were there which then helped them all get further protection from being identified.

Only remember it as the protection of the grandchild is a fairly recent-ish thing and was on the news for a little bit and because it's a pretty local thing for me. Quickly searched it to tell you the name and found out she had an accomplice, I never knew about that and I'm surprised only Mary recieved public attention.

edit: added in the book mention. Also there's quite a few cases like it, always surprises me but the UK has had quite a few kids prosecuted for murder/manslaughter."

Everyone in my family is terrible for going to the hospital as we feel like a bother taking up a bed when there's people worse off - always one fighting with everyone else trying to get them to see reason.

Just now things are and truthfully I don't fully understand why. It's a common enough attitude, especially with medical care/receiving help - always see old people on the shows that follow ambulances about saying they don't want to be a bother/take up a bed.
