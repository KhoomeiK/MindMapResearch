Honestly I believe the First Gen already sacrificed quite a lot just to come to SG and make a name for themselves. Plus the opportunity cost and the actual monetary costs involved to get a HDB, applying for PR etc. outweigh the 2 years. A lot of sweat and tears involved.

Family ties and nationality is another thing, it is not feasible to serve in another nation's army when you are still holding onto your host nation's passport/citizenship. Well I have to admit my mother actually feared us going into NS but I think personally it's just another experience, no point trying to siam or escape the country.
