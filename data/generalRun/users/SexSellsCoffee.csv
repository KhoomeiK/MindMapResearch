>It's false to assume the war wouldn't have otherwise happened. If it wasn't slavery it would have been something else. 

Slavery was The Issue since the Constitution was being debated. The three fifths compromise, the Northwest ordinance, Missouri compromise, Nebraska-Kansas Act. American history is full of trying to placate the South over slavery.

>For instance, VA, AK, SC, and TN didn't secede until Lincoln called for them to muster troops to fight the states that did secede. 
>VA, SC, AK, Tenn  represent most of the southern influence, economy ect., and they didn't leave until the feds told them to fight a war. That's not slavery. And that's a topic that is highly relevant today, as the draft is *technically* still on the books. If we tried to institute a draft today, how would the states respond? Do states have a say?  


You have SC and NC mixed up but I don't see why they have anything to do with anything. Shit popped off because the other states seceded over slavery. And it's not like those states didn't have slavery sympathizers. Richmond, VA became the capital of the CSAA and the CSA forbade individual states from addressing abolition of slavery. They were deep in the shit too. Somehow other states that didn't have slavery were able to not secede from the Union despite a draft.


>This is part of the reason the south fired first shots. South Carolina saw the north as the aggressor (due to the draft issue), and was very worries about union troops at the fort. Likewise VA was very quick to muster troops for the same exact reasons. The north, in their eyes, wanted the war first, the north came to THEM asking about war. Then the better chunk of the south seceded. 
>
>Chances are most people haven't really thought about it because the only instance that it ever came into question is generalised into slavery.


All roads lead to slavery. It's why the South seceded. State rights to own slaves. Economic factors because of an economy based on slavery. The South had no legal basis for secession. They did an illegal. They started shit. The South tried to have their cake and eat it. Decades of the Northern states appeasing the South just so when things looked like it might favor abolition.

For example, they can't ask about a disability and disqualify you from a job. They can however make you take medical tests as a condition for hiring if it's something they make everyone do. Employers are really more worried about the ADA since what medical info is in there could cause an employers actions to be considered discriminatory.
