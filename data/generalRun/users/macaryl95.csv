funny,ffes66c,t1_ffegei5,1579862939.0,This is a common scenario thrown up whenever cheating is mentioned. Whether it happened or not is irrelevant. This is why communication is key. People who cheat lack communication skills and respect for their partners.

I mentioned circumcision to enlighten others to the fact doctors do actually lie. I fully support vaccinations yet decided to drift from that topic. As a result, here we are. 

Here is [one doctor](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/uk-england-nottinghamshire-41898408) who performed the sickening procedure without any permission whatsoever. 

[Another](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/MindMoodResourceCenter/miami-hospital-circumcises-latino-newborn-mistake-horrifying-mother/story?id=11626925) did so completely ""by accident."" 

[Proof](https://www.intactamerica.org/falsehoods-and-facts/) the procedure is barbaric and cruel. 

The only reason this continues to happen is *men are cut because their fathers were cut and so forth.* Also the fact that *to this day doctors spread misinformation based around inconclusive studies.* Religion is still a major factor as well. 

So no, my parents are not purely at fault here. They were young and ignorant. They were told it would be fine and I have to live with the cost. Because they trusted a medical practitioner. It was a joint effort between both sides."
