todayilearned,ffmrlmp,t3_eu5wt2,1580058210.0,I work in an open office. Can confirm.
mechmarket,ffjftyz,t1_ff7sj0p,1579997355.0,Possibly. I’m not sure if I wanna sell or not. I’d likely sell to find another build of the same keyboard just with different switches.

I sold the ErgoDox ez to fund another project, otherwise I would have kept it. 

I missed the ortho and split form factor so I bought all the components together. 

As far as usage goes, it’s pretty similar, but the ErgoDox is a much more substantial keyboard. 

I recall having most of the thumb cluster keys dedicated to macros for things like locking my screen, or navigation like page up/down. I want another one, for sure. It’s kind of a toss up as to which is better. But if it’s your first ortho split board, and you can solder, build an Iris. It feels like a better introduction to the layout."
ErgoMechKeyboards,ffhaht0,t1_ffh7exe,1579927914.0,"I’m the opposite, too many bad experiences with micro. But, I’ll say this, when I owned an ErgoDox EZ, it was awesome and the input cable worked just fine."
ErgoMechKeyboards,ffh2orh,t1_ffgy869,1579921489.0,Nice. I’ll see about getting it printed somewhere. Thanks!
ErgoMechKeyboards,ffgrrba,t3_es707p,1579913388.0,"The ErgoDox EZ would be *perfect* if it had USB-C input. But, that’s a nitpick from me. 

I built an Iris rev4 from Keeb.io. Split, ortho, usb-c, qmk firmware, its great."
