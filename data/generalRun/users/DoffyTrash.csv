Rant: I made delicious cake... That no one is eating. So I lowkey want to eat it. But I'm also sad that it seems to have gone unappreciated :'("
xxfitness,ffg8pwv,t1_ffg6kq2,1579900877.0,That is really weird! Definitely check your shoes in that case. R/running might also have ideas.

fatlogic,fffypo0,t1_fffrgno,1579894710.0,"One mantra that works for me is, ""Hunger is not an emergency.""

You feel hungry. You want to eat right away. Sometimes you can, and that's great! But sometimes you can't, because you have a big dinner planned, or because the available options don't fit your plan. In those moments I like to pause and remind myself, ""It's ok to be hungry. I've been hungry before and survived. I know my next meal will be at xx:xx, and I can wait until then."" Then I drink some water or tea and find something other than eating to fill my time."
fatlogic,fffwsl5,t1_fffvrox,1579893516.0,"Am a woman, can confirm that learning to lift has been a lot of trial and error. It helped that I had the resources to go to physical therapy and was guided through a lot of the workouts I still use now, but a lot of women are never encouraged to lift growing up and get fed misinformation when they finally do give it a try."
xxfitness,fffrvh2,t3_ete86h,1579890448.0,Maybe you're pushing yourself too hard for it to be sustainable.
fatlogic,fffjzac,t3_et9m7n,1579885600.0,"If EVERYONE in my life were doing something, I am not nearly arrogant enough to believe that my not doing the thing would be the correct choice. As it is, I am the only person in my life who keeps my diet and exercise under control."
xxfitness,fffblo8,t1_fff91f3,1579880370.0,Check out the FAQ here and on r/loseit! There is information that should help you.
xxfitness,fff8kiy,t3_etbbvz,1579878400.0,"The endo/mesomorph thing isn't real, so I wouldn't worry too much about that part."

xxfitness,ffd8jtr,t3_esyq72,1579815515.0,"If one of them is going to run with you, talk to their pediatrician first to come up with a safe plan! Running can be hard on developing joints."
xxfitness,ffcj0rx,t3_esr22g,1579800499.0,"So right now my main running goal is to do a 5k in 26:23 (8:30 min/mile). I've been incorporating speedwork into my weekly routine, using Jeff Galloway's ""speedwork for the 5k"" workout. You start with 4-6 400m repeats at 8 seconds faster than your goal pace and work your way up to 14 repeats. Today I did a full 4 repeats at the target pace for the first time! I'm super stoked. Next week I get to move up to 5."
fatlogic,ffalhmp,t1_ffak3nv,1579738729.0,Ugh. I want to downvote just for the concept alone.
fatlogic,ffa5svm,t1_ff9ufrz,1579728446.0,You can always add made up stuff
xxfitness,ff9da4j,t1_ff9c8oo,1579710472.0,"My weight is closer to OP than yours though, and from your other reply it sounds like you lift a lot heavier than they do. It still sounds like they're eating too much."
xxfitness,ff96m62,t1_ff9688y,1579706069.0,"2200 is definitely too much. Try adjusting your calories and see if that makes a difference.

(For reference, I'm 5'7 and at the gym every day and I eat 1600 for maintenance.)"
xxfitness,ff95whc,t1_ff94xm1,1579705589.0,How tall are you? 2200 seems really high unless you're doing a metric ton of cardio on top of your lifting.

xxfitness,ff93qns,t1_ff8zudc,1579704115.0,"""Eat healthy""

What does this mean? How many calories are you eating? How much protein? Are you weighing and tracking your food?"
xxfitness,ff910ug,t1_ff8qk3m,1579702130.0,I'm 5'7 and maintenance for my goal weight is 1600. You could go up a little and see if you're still losing regularly.
xxfitness,ff8zrn3,t1_ff8u6y6,1579701142.0,"Ask him firmly to give you space. If he refuses, get a staff member involved. If you don't feel safe doing that, go straight to staff and explain the situation ahead of time."
fatlogic,ff7f7fp,t1_ff7eo0i,1579648158.0,"Are you anxious or distressed about food and eating? Are you restrictive with your diet to an unreasonable degree, or such that it negatively impacts your daily life or relationships? Are you losing too much too quickly?

Only a licensed therapist can diagnose you for real, but if the answers to those questions are no, you probably don't have anorexia."

xxfitness,ff6gziu,t1_ff5ekuf,1579626994.0,"Mood. I hate this fake positivity stuff. I think people should strive to feel neutral about their bodies at best, and I think it's valid to feel bad about your body if it isn't what you want."
fatlogic,ff6fb0q,t1_ff693mv,1579625948.0,I realized my diet is almost entirely carbs with a little bit of fat and almost no protein. Trying to be better but... Cheez its...
fatlogic,ff6eu95,t3_ervuu1,1579625659.0,"Body positivity makes me tired, guys. I don't think fake positivity has ever helped anyone be better than they are.

I've been having a hard time waking up to go to the gym in the mornings, so I've been having to go after I eat breakfast and drop my husband at work which throws off my weigh ins x-x can't keep a scale in the house either. Sigh. When it rains it pours."
