endometriosis,ffi3ylx,t3_etoke8,1579964397.0,I wish this worked for me. CBD seems to do absolutely nothing for me.
Aquariums,ffi3pl7,t1_ffe32ba,1579964190.0,Gotchya! Thank you!!
Aquariums,ffdy9f2,t1_ffdnneh,1579831919.0,"1. Got it. I'll probably just do that. I'm not interested in breeding but I know it might happen. 
2. Ok good to know about the cories! 
3. I'm thinking of getting a wider shorter tank [kind of like this](https://www.marinedepot.com/aquamaxx-long-low-iron-rimless-aquarium-12-gallon) but bigger. Unsure if I have the space for anything over 20gal but depends on the actual width/size. The tank will be sharing a table with a lot of my plants so I could probably do some rearranging."
Aquariums,ffdy3bi,t1_ffdpcom,1579831797.0,I haven't but I am definitely open to those!

web_design,fehtfre,t1_fehmg3u,1579123521.0,I was able to get this to work!! Thank you so much. I've been struggling with this for two days.
web_design,fehsa45,t1_fehmg3u,1579122870.0,Thank you!  I'm less familiar with how use SVG in this way so I'll take a look.
web_design,fehjs2l,t1_fehivnn,1579117978.0,Ok - makes sense. I'll play around with these. Thank you so much!
web_design,fehhtaw,t1_feh9tjg,1579116822.0,"This is solid, the only problem is the angle gets sharper when adjusting page size, etc."
web_design,fehhna0,t1_feh9tjg,1579116724.0,Thank you - I will try this

TFABLinePorn,fee8hgl,t1_fea6l2u,1579028570.0,"Well, period arrived in full force! I'm still so confused about these tests. I don't think it was a CP because I didn't really have any symptoms. Oh well."

lookatmydog,fec1bt5,t1_fe9rfcl,1578965204.0,He gets his fair share of snacks ;)
lookatmydog,fec18je,t1_fe9evw9,1578965164.0,It is. He's the best boy.
trollingforababy,fec14xo,t1_febmv1d,1578965117.0,Thank you! We're still cosleeping too. Right between my legs is his favorite spot. Maybe he knows I'm TTC and he's trying to prevent something... not sure. & thank you! I love him.
TFABLinePorn,feb5s3e,t1_fea6l2u,1578955712.0,Thank you!!!
lookatmydog,fea5187,t1_fe9ftwq,1578944441.0,I always do! (As long as it’s not poisonous for dogs)
lookatmydog,fea4u6q,t1_fe9krbd,1578944400.0,I always do! His favorite is baby carrots. He’s a weirdo.
TFABLinePorn,fea4opp,t1_fe9yebh,1578944344.0,I didn’t test again... I’m too afraid because I didn’t want to head on my work trip feeing emotional. I had an early flight this morning and didn’t pack any with me either. Temp took a huge dip though so I’m guessing my period will be here soon. I decided if it doesn’t show up on this trip (til Thursday) I will test when I get home.
rescuedogs,fe6clss,t3_enx9mh,1578887030.0,"Take your time choosing a dog! Sometimes people can be pushy because they fear they won't find a home for a dog, but that's not a good reason to pressure anyone. The situation has to be mutual for the dog and the owner. You'll know when you know. Most people understand that."
TFABLinePorn,fe6bzat,t3_enxzgy,1578886563.0,CD10 seems a bit early but not terribly far off from your average. Are you temping also? It's possible you won't ovulate for a few days still.
aww,fe5wkg2,t1_fe5usgp,1578876550.0,"His adoption was $400. It varies from rescue to rescue and usually least expensive at any local humane society since they have more funding. There are always border collie mixes up for adoption. If you’re looking seriously, check out Petfinder. Definitely worth doing research on the breeds though and thinking about yearly costs (vet, training, food) - adoption is the least expensive part of owning a dog. Australian shepherd mixes have similar looks too! Also smart dogs."
aww,fe5epv7,t1_fe5dj0f,1578868522.0,"Ours definitely looks just like a BC and has the personality traits as one. However, he's 55lbs and bigger than the standard BC. We did a DNA test as a puppy because everyone kept telling us he was definitely pure BC, but the rescue said he was a lab/BC mix (so, opposite of what happened with you)"
aww,fe5ehcc,t1_fe5dp0a,1578868399.0,Both me and my husband work from home and take turns exercising him throughout the day. He cleans up toys from the backyard (his job) and herds the tennis ball we throw like a little psychopath. We love him.
aww,fe5dp0a,t1_fe3u38n,1578868168.0,I have a BC mix. I can attest that they are not a beginner dog. They are full of pure anxiety and OCD if not given something to do daily (like a few hours minimum) exercise.
aww,fe5bvzt,t1_fe59cwy,1578867446.0,"These were his DNA test results (His Mom was 100% BC - she was at the rescue we adopted him from).

bettafish,fdrfg28,t3_emmn90,1578683741.0,I have the same tank. I really like it!
TFABChartStalkers,fdrdzb6,t1_fdramw1,1578683083.0,Thank you! I'm really hoping it means something but this has been a weird cycle so who knows.
