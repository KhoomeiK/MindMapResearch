If you live near a university and they have a Veterinary school my advice would be to go there unless your  veterinarian has intensive training in veterinary neurology in order to provide the very best outcome for your pet. 

Certain  diseases and conditions require the care of a doctor who has had intensive training in veterinary neurology. Make sure she/he is certified by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM)

I’m jealous because your father said something. My parents didn’t care if I got an A or an F.

Keep your head up and think about where YOUR going and what YOU want to do with YOUR life. 

Even though it’s no consolation, I feel your hurt. 

Remember, your the greatest asset  we humans have. 

It’s YOU and YOUR JOURNEY that counts.
