Male Friend 1 to MF2: ""Do you have a girlfriend?""
MF2: ""No""
Me: ""A boyfriend? Just checking""
MF2 usually says something like ""no i'm not gay you asshole"" and it's all pretty funny in the end.

Even if you don't have anyone right now, I am confident enough to tell you that when even a piece of shit like me can have a partner, you must be able to get one as well. Please keep your hopes up."

fatlogic,fehgczd,t1_fehawdl,1579115975.0,"This is very true. There are indeed people who are lucky regarding weight-gain (slow gaining/quick losing) or unlucky (quick gaining/slow losing), but if you deicde to spend a lot of time changing the situation, you will most certainly regret wasting the time if it doesn't work out.

A lot of people also don't realize they can easily change their personality while losing weight. For example, when they want to start eating more strictly/healthier, they might stay home instead of going to restaurants and bars with friends or family (easily tempted to eat/drink unhealthily), which could ruin their social situation. This also goes for meeting new people or finding/performing new hobbies (fitness, attending events).

If there are certain things people love to do, changing their lifestyle might cause these things to dissappear in their lives. It might even affect your relationship if you are not careful enough."

But putting off is a different scenario. It makes sense people dont want to buy new clothes because of the prices, but I think this post is related to people who do it a bit too much. Your case is also more unfat-wearing-big instead of fat-wearing-small ( I believe this is the main complaint in this post). Like someone who doesn't want to admit they are fat."
