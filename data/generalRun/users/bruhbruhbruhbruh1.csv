Is this <If \_\_ is wrong, I don't want to be right> indeed a reference to the third Hobbit movie, or did they just borrow an already popular sentence construction?"

Engineers hardly ever do shit that requires additional resources 'for the fun of it.' I mean, that's a classic optimization problem - expected payoff for efficient usage of constrained resources - but they'll add redundant systems to your aircraft, and extra satellites, because they know all things eventually break, but not all at once. And so, by having extra, your service won't be interrupted as likely or as often."
