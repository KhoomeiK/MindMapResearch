Fantasy,ffay3kk,t1_ffasceh,1579747171.0,Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norell is one of my favorite books. There is a bbc series that is pretty faithful as well.
Fantasy,ffa0aht,t1_ff9sgb3,1579725287.0,It was always planned as a trilogy of series - 2 sets of 3 books with the third being 2 or 3. I will say that the first trilogy was stronger than the next 4 books by far.
Fantasy,ffa022x,t3_ese3fr,1579725151.0,"Powder Mage series - Brian McClellan (sp) developed a really cool form of magic but failed to develop it to its potential the way Sanderson did with mistborn. Power Mage is alright because of its plot, not the way magic is used."
MMFB,ff9zldu,t3_esg5fl,1579724878.0,"You're only 23 man. You have time to get your life back on track. Start by finishing a college degree or get an associates at a community college. What do you like to study? Now is the time to be learning a field, not feeling sorry for yourself. People in worse places than you have turned their lives around. 

I suggest seeing a counselor and asking for help with coming up with a plan for your future. You aren't pathetic, you're just someone who took a while to get on their life path."
Fantasy,ff9z1ir,t1_ff9vskd,1579724557.0,Expect the next Rothfuss publications to be the 10 year anniversary editions of The Wise's Man's Fear late this year or early next year and the 10 year anniversary edition of The Slow Regard of Silent Things in 2024. I hope Simonetti does the art for both.
cyberpunkgame,ff4m9rr,t1_ff3fvnf,1579567039.0,"Are there still collectors? I would think the hundreds of pops that come out each year, the rerelease of characters, and the pointless pops like generic storm trooper 6 would cut down the desire anyone has to collect them all."
cyberpunkgame,ff4m473,t1_ff3auyz,1579566932.0,"Some people feel the need to justify spending hundreds, maybe thousands, of dollars on a figure collection."
lostgeneration,ff43sk6,t1_ff3kdxa,1579554914.0,Its part of the corporate indoctrination program that views labor as a resource in the capitalist system.
Games,ff2wt34,t1_feojir9,1579527087.0,"Yep, just about every game has a fan base that plays almost nothing else. You'll find everything from people who've 100% the witcher 3 10x to people who play almost nothing but cod."
todayilearned,ff2t8kc,t1_ff1mrtp,1579523186.0,"Its like that now in places like the San Fran Bay area and Silicon Valley, but that is the future of the US. It'll start with the rest of the Cali then spread to other desirable states. It'll take a while, say 60 years for the whole US to become like that. Maybe we'll do something to address income inequality before it happens, but I doubt it."
bravelydefault,feufsc5,t3_ejl8v7,1579386071.0,They'll need new jobs and killer writing to keep the series fresh. There is still a lot of potential here.
NintendoSwitch,feue8k5,t3_eqm3sc,1579385674.0,"Switch controller is supposed to get 30 hours out of a charge I believe. If its new, it could last longer, but the best thing to do is put it on the charger when not in use. FE: 3 Houses was really fun. Black Eagles all the way."
sandiego,fetbyy8,t1_fepqcqe,1579373725.0,"Do they build anything but luxury apartments in San Diego county? A cockroach infested dump with asbestos insulation, lead paint in the walls, and no ammenities (other than a pool, all apt complexes here seem to have a pool) can be listed as luxury apartments."
newhampshire,feicq76,t1_feic65h,1579135447.0,Do all the tolls in NH have a cash option?
Malazan,fei86s0,t1_feho1z7,1579132443.0,Correct. This one had the moon on it so they went with it.
FinalFantasy,feep75j,t1_fedhc27,1579038318.0,"Square Enix has never gotten a release date right for their major releases, they're always going to be delayed."
Fantasy,feb72id,t1_fe69ckx,1578956018.0,What app are you using to determine page numbers? My Kindle rarely gives me page numbers and when it does they are based on the physical book I'm pretty sure.
worldnews,feb3mvo,t1_feas5pm,1578955132.0,"Unless you raise people to be fanatically loyal to the state, ingraining it with a system of compulsory primary and secondary education. When that happens, in a country the size of China, you could get a small army that was willing to shoot enough people in Hong Kong to quell a riot or at least arrest pro democracy activists and leaders."
worldnews,feb2e5o,t1_feapp16,1578954833.0,"It rarely works unless a new autocrat just seizes power through a coup. Aboy Ahmed of Ethiopia is about the only modern example I can think of for someone changing an autocratic government for the better.


I guess South Korea is another example of going from stratocracy to a liberal democracy."
worldnews,feaxg9e,t3_eo891n,1578953209.0,"How big are the protests really? Its high profile news in the west, but is this something serious that the regime will need to address or is it like in the US where there is some protest going on in DC nearly every weekend, with a big one every couple years or so?"
Games,fe0c84k,t1_fdyqpyv,1578809466.0,"I loved 3, which made me go back and play 2. 2 has a great storyline but the gameplay and graphics are showing their age. It took me probably a dozen hours before I was used to it."
education,fe0865e,t1_fdzc8bv,1578805668.0,"Other first world countries have high levels of income inequality. In the US, income inequality is simply obscene."
Malazan,fdiva8c,t3_elhq6m,1578451827.0,That size is called trade paperback. https://readoscope.com/creative-writing/books/difference-between-trade-paperback-mass-market-paperback/
worldnews,fdcxzev,t1_fdcsqe1,1578287641.0,"It was to check the power of slave owners who wanted slaves to be counted in a states population in determining seats in congress and electoral votes without enfranchising those slaves. The only voters in southern states would be free men who voted against the interest of slaves (generally) and with the weight of their slaves behind them, their votes would count for more (Eg they'd get more congressmen for their state if the slaves, who weren't allowed to vote, counted as a full person instead of 3/5)."
sandiego,fdct2i1,t3_ekjf6l,1578283524.0,We will see a lot of them close down as the rent for the lots have gotten so high they will no longer make financial sense.
Fantasy,fdcsp2s,t3_ekjs8t,1578283222.0,"16 ways to defend a walked city by Kj Parker is pretty good. Like Abercrombie, Parker has a dark humorous style."
politics,fda8hkv,t1_fd7ikzs,1578242980.0,"Nixon, Bush, Trump. Republicans sure know how to pick them. Back then there were truly independent voters, uneducated people who were swayed by the media and debates. Today there are few independents left because the media is so all pervasive."
worldnews,fd6eygx,t1_fd40zm1,1578189958.0,The US would be willing to get along with a secular democracy with fair elections in that region. Or at least that would be the case without madman Trump.
bakker,fd6djzx,t3_ek1ntl,1578189331.0,"I don't think there is any evidence to suggest that the quya are more powerful than high level gnostic mages. People in that world may believe it, but the reader shouldn't."
JRPG,fd3fhk2,t1_fd2ufoz,1578157790.0,"I agree with you. A town or city needs to fill lived in. Sometimes games get away by making a large part of the town appear inaccessible, off in the distance, up a hill. I want a jrpg with cities the size of novigrad in the witcher 3."
NintendoSwitch,fcyq213,t1_fcwl7ke,1578084755.0,"In total across all the games (2d, 3d, tennis, kart, etc.) Zelda games come out once or twice a generation and the zelda spin offs aren't really party games."
NintendoSwitch,fcypuzu,t3_ej5ee2,1578084647.0,"What I really want is a Zelda game with a strong narrative and quests ala the Witcher 3, yet with dungeons and items you have to get to progress through the world."
NintendoSwitch,fcxknn8,t3_ej9c4w,1578065255.0,Man no one could name systems like Sega.
Fantasy,fcwbfne,t1_fcw40g0,1578021524.0,Logen or Cosca on the other hand...
scifi,fcvsi01,t1_fcctm0z,1578009106.0,"I know, I just don't believe it."
gmu,fcs0bml,t1_fcrffcy,1577909373.0,"Even if the department says he's totally in the wrong and can't lower your grade like this, I would not take this guy unless you absolutely need this section of this class this semester to graduate. I'd steer clear of this professor, he sounds unstable and I can only imagine more draconian or crazy policies you'll have to follow to do well in the course.

That said, if you've been getting emails from him, why did you ignore them. It could have saved you a lot of trouble just to read the emails and log in to blackboard, but oh well.

If you intend to go on and take the class and the department agrees with you, that your grade can't be lowered before the semester actually starts, you're going to have to stay on top of this class and crazy things you need to do well in order to succeed.  In my time at gmu (alum) I found that most professors understood students were under a lot of stress and busy with other classes and willing to work with them, but there were some who would not budge - and my department tended to side with the professors which led to a couple of nerve wracking instances where I only passed a class by blowing the final paper out of the water."
nintendo,fcrz8b9,t1_fcpksj8,1577908797.0,"Outer Worlds looks pretty good, but its out on other platforms already. Hard for this list to be taken seriously without any nintendo exclusives appearing on it."
politics,fcrlbza,t1_fcrk6el,1577903305.0,"The president should be held to a higher standard than this. He should have to take a 500 question exam, with an 8 hour time limit, scoring 95% or higher."
rpg_gamers,fcrfm8r,t3_efvfbm,1577901192.0,"Old final fantasy games, up to 9 and I am Setsuna and Lost Sphear might be up your alley. I would like a turn based or atb rpg with modern graphics. It looks like ff7 remake may have some kind of classic or atb mode and that comes out in march."
rpg_gamers,fcre05i,t1_fcbx1ow,1577900555.0,"That is a fair assessment of the games. I would suggest doing main story with just a few sidequests for your first play through (except in X where you have to do a good number). The sidequests are designed to pad the game length, not really be interesting or give you good stuff. They are there for people who feel they should be able to get over 300 hours out of a game. The main stories, in contrast to the side quests, are very interesting.

If you love exploration and surreal environments, you'll love these games. The big draw is the huge other worldly open areas to explore and getting invested in the narrative as you do so.

If you are looking for incredibly deep combat or tons of thinking in order to beat bosses, its not really here."
rpg_gamers,fcrbuvo,t3_egscsd,1577899719.0,"I like Suzy Lu's lets plays, especially for final fantasy games as she is sort of a super fan. https://www.youtube.com/user/SuzyLuGME

A word of caution though - she plays multiple games at once, which can cause her to take months to finish games, so I'd reccommend watching a game she's already completed, at least to get a taste of what her channel is."
rpg_gamers,fcrbjdv,t3_ei6bvh,1577899574.0,"I disagree with you about the Witcher on almost every point. I will say horseback riding felt clunky. Riding a horse feels clunky to me in real life too, so maybe they got it right. I just downed werewolf potions constantly.

As for skyrim vs the witcher - its a matter of preference, do you prefer creating a role or playing an established role. For me, I like the latter."
rpg_gamers,fcrb8j3,t3_eic9vm,1577899443.0,This sounds really cool. I love Bronze Age stuff.
NintendoSwitch,fcl96a2,t3_ehlgzz,1577742523.0,"Doubtless there will be more icons, themes, trophies, and netflix. The direct will be announced for Jan 8th with Botw 2: Zelda gone wild releasing January 9th."

scifi,fc7g3g4,t1_fc6s18g,1577506381.0,Snoke could have just had a clone. Or that Snoke could have been a clone of the original. It makes as much sense as Palpatine surviving the death star 2's destruction.
scifi,fc7g049,t1_fc6qsrq,1577506300.0,Disney doesn't do interesting though. They make multi hour long toy commercials.

Elric is a weakling and nearly crippled and requires the sword to maintain his throne, yet has a strong conscience and despises that he must keep feeding souls to his blade.


Another twist on this is dragnipur, Anomander Rake's sword from Malazan. As far as I can remember the sword doesn't confer any powers but it holds the souls of those it kills, preventing them from passing on to the realm of death.

A few books into the series there is another cool sword as well, one that grants it's wielder the power to come back from mortal blows. It's held by an emperor who's army captures champions for him to fight."
