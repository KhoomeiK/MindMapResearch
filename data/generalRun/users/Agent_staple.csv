I started out loving it a few episodes in to not caring much at all, probably around season 3 but kept watching cause there were still certain scenes popping up that where incredible (Beach morphine cinema and woodcutters axe, episodes comes to mind).

&#x200B;

Honestly, I was figuring things out episodes before the explanation in the first season but I still liked the direction it was taking. By the third it felt like a long dragged out M Night Shyamalan movie. Just throwing twists at you to show how interesting and clever and mysterious it all is. But it wasn't. The build up of the first two seasons was not paid off."
television,ffn76g1,t1_ffiplf9,1580062693.0,I imagine that would be quite hard to convey through the show alone... Then again you could just have someone like jojen or sam explain the bond to bran or jon at some point and all scenes involving the wolves would then make sense.

summonerschool,ffkt61e,t3_etv191,1580028422.0,"Get her to play something other than support. Starting out as support seems safer but it's harder to learn how to trade and when to all in because you're relying on a random adc, everyone you all in or trade you will have a different outcome because of this.

Whereas, if she plays a solo lane she will have more damage. More control and eventually more confidence. I'd say play top lane, a bruiser like garen, Darius, sion. This will give her the health, tankiness and ability to reliably all in at lvl 6. She will learn wave control, jgler ganking and top-mid ganking faster purely cause she will be forced too. Having 2 got lane lets you worry a little less about most jgler because of all the cc you have. Top lane you don't have that.

Last thing is teach her about freezing, slow pushing and fast pushing early, explain. The benefits of each. And also positioning with the waves, if your scared stay opposite the minions, if you're aggressive match the enemy. Teach her about quickly building a wave and using it to trade and how the enemy will do the same. Also make sure she understands how of a difference half an item can make. Or a level at the right time. A lvl 5 garen and a lvl 6 garen are completely different animals

Lock certain items behind events which start happening after X days. 

Day 1 no events, the best you can get are satchels, pumpy/semi pistol found in military crate/elites

Day 2/3 oil rig crates start, gives explosive ammo, semi/smgs/pythons

Day 4/5 cargo starts, AK and chest plate 

Day 6 Launch bradley starts, gives C4, bolty and face plate.

Day 7 Heli starts, gives rockets

With each new stage all previously locked items will be available in mill/elitecrates/airdrops like they normally would.

Obviously those are just examples, you'd tweak the days of events and what items they give, that's just meant to give you an idea of how I would slow down progression and pit the clans against each other instead of the solos/small groups. They'll fight each other at the monuments as each even unlocks trying to get the higher tier loot, at least till c4/rockets. By which time the smaller groups have had time to build up a half decent base/compound so they have a chance of surviving.

&#x200B;

Also, off topic but seeing as we're discussing what needs changing.

Fix render distance, 250m is not enough, no where near far enough. 350 might be bareable but 500 is what I'd really want.. (If we cant get unlimited). If this was to nerf roof camping, put the view distance back up and add armour pen drop off at long distances. Roof camping>crippled.

Can't think of much else right now, I've not really been listening to much edm at all lately, let us know if you have any good recomendations. Oh and if you don't know about monstercat check them out, pretty sure they're a big label or group that hosts other artists. If you just search monstercat on yt you'll find tonnes of stuff"

I've played for years and I just this past month started really practicing warding, deep warding, clearing wards and actively controlling vision on support. As well as better positioning in lane as sup/adc, poking every chance I get, knowing when I can take fights and keeping track of enemy abilities and capitalizing on them being down, lux misses q attack attack attack."

I've not done any shroom grows yet but when I do I wanna try figure something out with wheatabix, they should make a good food source and they come sterilized and packaged. I've no idea how it'll go, 100% mush or mold or if it'll work, but it's worth a shot."

I'll probably keep watching it though tbf, it is fun and very pretty. Dandelions great, the monsters are cool, I enjoyed yens story and I'll take all the dwarf content I can get lol

Anyone coming to the witcher fresh, if you're considering reading the books or watching the show, I'd definitely suggest you do the books first. There are story arcs which will be much more emotional and rewarding than the TV show has managed."

Well some people get something similar to that, better even, when listening to weird shit like this. Continuous waves of tingles from your spine to your toes, it feels awesome and it's super relaxing, I listen to it while meditating"
