I’ll take your condescending remark as your still in high school and yet to even have a job. All the mr definition kinda points to this. When you grow up, you might be lucky enough to have a hard time and have to figure out a way to survive on $8/hr. People have done it for generations, and learn from it. And the thing is when they overcome such trials, you don’t hear them complain about not getting paid enough now, they complain that people now aren’t worth a damn what they get paid and can’t spend what they have.

I don’t provide proof for arguments, I provide sufficient evidence. 

I would like to see someone with time and ability. Break down the cost of a hamburger from farmer to counter $. And see what the overhead is at $24/hr minimum wage. 

I think what will actually happen is places like McDonald’s will either only hire and train people capable doing 3x the work. Or they will find a way to hire foreigners and pay under minimum wage. Make everyone work for tips something to get around the law."
