RMS_Titanic,ffg69p1,t1_ffg4onv,1579899361.0,">Will not having the wireless in an exhibit make Titanic less special, will it ruin the mystique? Or will it be like it's always been, and people can view it on the underwater survey footage.

Do you expect new people to be drawn in by old artifacts? You and I can be as fascinated with Titanic as we like, but the average person needs novelty.

Do you really believe that Titanic research will continue without new sources of revenue, without new excitement, without new press?  Titanic may be an iconic story, but that doesn't keep funds coming in.  A new exhibit traveling around the world with THE Marconi would drum up new interest, which means more funds, which means more dives.

>As to restoring it, no expert can say for sure if it's possible any more than you or I can. They won't be able to tell until they have it in front of them, and salvaging so many delicate, rusting pieces seems like a fools errand.

An expert can definitely say that it's possible more than you or I can.  Do they need to be sure?  Do they need to be 100% positive that it's possible, or can they just make an educated guess?  This sort of archaeology will never be an exact science.  Get used to that.

>It seems so unnecessary. When will we have enough pieces of Titanic that it'll be enough?

When new pieces stop being interesting, when they stop creating more interest, when they stop sparking people's imagination.  If they bring this SOB up, I'll find a way to see it, and I'll bring my kids.  I can't get them to watch documentaries, they don't give a flying fuck about dive footage, but they'll enjoy a trip to a cool museum exhibit."

Amy - Her senate seat is safe, she's basically girl Biden and she's still young enough to run the top of the ticket in 8 years.  She brings out the female vote which is going to be super important this cycle.

Plenty of people with mental disabilities that put them well below the intelligence of the average person can serve as translators, as can pre-teen human beings.  Plus, most conversation occurs at a more surface level than people realize.  I'm not saying that AI could replace translators for business or government tasks, at least not for some time, but the average person having the average conversation can live without foolproof accuracy.  Think back to the last conversation you had with someone whose first language was not English.  Could you understand them well enough to accomplish what you needed to accomplish?  A great deal of those folks never achieve a native speaker level of fluency in English (just as a great deal of anglophiles in areas where English is not used don't) because they don't need to.  They learn enough to get by and then stop.  Think about all the pidgins that have sprung up over the centuries, communication using those languages is common, but rarely deep or meaningful.  All machine translation needs to do is to rise to that level if it is to stop people from learning one single global language.  That does not require human level AI.

Generally, streaming services just let creators do what they're going to do and then they evaluate how well they did and decide if it's worth continuing to pay them.  If anything, Seth will have MORE creative freedom on Hulu than he did on Fox, which in my estimation means that the 3rd season is going to be MUCH less comedy centered since it doesn't seem like that's really what Seth wanted to do in the first place."
askscience,ff9gkg3,t1_ff95ue0,1579712556.0,"You can't forget about the conservation of angular momentum.  As the DM gets closer to the black hole, it wouldn't maintain speed, it would pick up speed which would cause it to slingshot away from the hole rather than fall in.  A particle of DM would basically need to be traveling STRAIGHT at the hole in order to fall in, any other trajectory, even slight, would cause the particle to fly away.  Since space is SUPER vast and we're looking at 3d trajectories, the chances of it being on a deadly one is astonishingly small.  Regular matter works the same way, except regular matter often collides with other regular matter which can slow it down.  Even worse, regular matter often breaks apart due to extreme tidal stress anywhere near a hole, which means that a rock heading towards a black hole becomes thousands of rocks heading towards that hole, and those thousands of rocks can easily smash into each other and be forced to slow down.  DM doesn't do that."

asklinguistics,ff6zy5v,t1_ff6xbiz,1579638349.0,"It already has.  Think about Shakespeare.  He did most of his writing in the very early 1600s, over 400 years ago and most of what he writes is pretty intelligible today, though it's pretty borderline.  Chaucer was born 220 years before, and Shakespeare would not have been able to read The Canterbury Tales in it's original form at all.  Because of writing and education, language change in English slowed down quite significantly in that period. It's likely slowing down even more now.  Think about how intelligible 100 year old works like Mark Twain are to you today.  Someone speaking Twain's English today would barely register as speaking a different dialect.

&#x200B;

However, someone from rural England would barely be understandable to you.  That's because America and England aren't collaborating to make sure that our language is the same.  If two countries with a close governmental relationship and a shared history can't keep that straight, what are the chances that we're going to talk Mongolia into not only teaching English exclusively, but also the exact sort of English we teach?

Bear in mind as well that governmental standardization can actually *accelerate* language change, as is the case with Hindustani.  You may not know this, but Urdu (as spoken in Pakistan) and Hindi (as spoken in India) are basically the same language. This is changing, however, as the respective governments don't get along, and Pakistan is pushing for closer linguistic relations to Farsi and Arabic.  Who's to say that such a condition is any more or less likely than us all coming together and deciding to speak a single way?  


EDIT:  It has been pointed out to me that I've put too much of a stank on my comparison of Chaucer and Shakespeare.  It's still pretty obvious to me that English changed much more between Chaucer and Shakespeare than between Shakespeare and now, but that it would not have been as unintelligible to Shakespeare as I originally stated.  My apologies."
asklinguistics,ff6vq44,t3_eryzbl,1579635862.0,"It's ... possible... but far from inevitable.

Signs sort of point towards this already beginning to happen, languages are dying at an increasing rate, and the vast majority of the people on earth have some familiarity with one of 20 major languages.  One can get by these days in most places on earth without speaking the local language if one understands whichever of those 20 is used in that area.  A historical example that helps to add validity to this idea is that of the disappearance of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of dialects used in areas where a central government have standardized language.  France, for example, used to have a dialect continuum stretching through their entire country where some dialects were more intelligible with dialects of Italian in northern Italy than they would have been with dialects of French spoken in the north of the country.  The French government standardized their language to a single dialect, only teach school in that dialect, only print newspapers in that dialect, that sort of thing.  For a while, the government dialect was the language of prestige and people would still speak their regional dialect at home, but that's been worn down over the years and most French people only speak the one French.

On the other side of this, however, is the rapidly increasing utility of machine translation.  Google does a pretty good job of translating English into Spanish or French and back, and is only getting better at it.  Between that and the advancements in speech to text it's entirely likely that within a few years an earpiece could do the job of a translator between similar languages, and a few years after that might be able to translate reliably between totally unrelated languages.  The sooner this happens the less likely it'll be that language becomes standardized throughout the whole species, since there won't be a need to speak to the French in French as your phone will be able to interpret the conversation for both sides.

Personally, I think a new worldwide language is pretty unlikely unless there is a serious need.  It would take the cooperation of a ton of different people who would first have to agree on which language that should be.  Then, that language would need to be protected from drift somehow, since drift is unlikely to occur in the same way and at the same speed everywhere. That would require we achieve a level of connectedness the likes of which we've never dreamed.  The only way I'd see that being possible is in a Star Trek type future where we identify as ""human"" in comparison to other beings rather than identifying as a race or nationality in comparison to other humans."
