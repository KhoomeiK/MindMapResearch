Twitch,ff693zo,t1_ff68vek,1579622024.0,"That's strictly revenue from bits and subs. I don't get donations typically because I'm a strictly charity channel. I do 2-3 marathons a year, have a wonderful community who supports and hangs out when I stream, and have had some crazy successes the last year."
StardewValley,ff60y4r,t1_ff5yidx,1579616313.0,My apologies. I sometimes get the two confused. They do look so much alike.

Twitch,ff60km9,t1_ff5rre2,1579616027.0,"Knowing what I do about charity through Twitch, they can't do any direct payment of the subs/bits to charity. If you have questions, definitely reach out to /u/alykkat or Alykkat@twitch.tv at twitch about charity things."

I've seen crazy amounts raised by people streaming. Some stream throughout the year, some stream just on gameday, or multiple gamedays.

I've seen people who don't stream at all raise crazy amounts of money. They share on their social media, with friends at work, with people they meet at their weekly dinner date restaurant. 

If you're looking to stream, I suggest watching casters like TheOnlyRyann and Bloodyfaster, or even larger, Rooster Teeth.

If you're looking to do it more offline style, I'd check out Moser (https://twitter.com/Mosersaurus444) or Michael DiPirro, RealDealDiPirro.

Hope that helps, and welcome to the family! If you're close to Florida, you should also check out Extra Life United. It's a competition to win portions of $150,000 for your hospital. 

What hospital are you raising for this year?"

He was maybe 5 weeks old when I found him. He didn't super like being held while the person was walking. A few days later I came home, picked him up, and commented that he seemed to be better with being held. 

Him: ""Oh yeah, I wrapped him to me while I was doing dishes""

Me: ""You freaking papoosed him?""

*In the voice of Morgan Freeman: ""It was at that moment, she realized that they were going to get to keep the kitten"""
