There has actually been some progress in this area. But basically all of it came from taking things like gravity into conaideration. Emergent spacetime and things like ER=EPR point towards a nonlocal structure of reality at small scales. None of this came from interpretations of QM though. These are such a dead end that people like Everett (who you mentionned) actually left physics long before philosophers resurrected his idea to ponder about it. Btw that that doesn't mean it's not an interesting idea. But it does not point in any forward direction for physics research, just like all the other interpretations.

>you can't define what ""the world is quantum"" even means without some interpretational baggage

Except you can, once you have a formal education in physics and mathematics. Take a Hilbert space, states living in it, some equation governing their time evolution and depending on your favourite interpretation you may also need to include something like the Born rule, but that's it. Once the mathematical construct is there, you can throw away all interpretations and start doing actual physics."

Wigners friend points to a possible inconsistency, but I have yet to hear anyone who calls QM broken because of it. EPR has nothing to do with any of this, so I don't know where you're getting at that. Non-local structures perhaps? That's not an interpretation issue in general (although some interpretations deal with it in different ways). People have yet to find any violations of locality, so it is understandable that some are slightly uncomfortable with this. But again it does not tell us that QM per se is broken and different interpretations don't tell us how to solve this either. Bell merely tells us that local hidden variables are an impossible interpretation of QM (but even that has room left for discussion).

Paradigm changes are not instantaneous, and the myth of the lone wolf genius scientist that single-handedly overthrows the world order is merely common folklore.

**Edit:** Actually, if you approach this from a certain perspective originating in String Theory, then the answer is a bit more nuanced. There's a concept called T-duality, which relates two different theories: one living at length scale R and one at length scale 1/R. Those theories are dual to each other, meaning they are equivalent for all practical purposes. So when you go to shorter and shorter length scales, you'll eventually find that any description of these short length physics will be equivalent to another description on longer length scales. So another answer to this question may be that it simply does not make sense to talk about lengths shorter than a certain distance - specifically, the point where 1/R and R are equivalent.

This would definitely need clinical trials."
todayilearned,fejqd3k,t1_fejj8yh,1579183174.0,The paper specifically mentions that many people suffer from hypersensitivity to horse-based antivenoms and opossum serum could thus have less side effects in humans. That is precisely why something like this would need clinical trials.
todayilearned,fejfsq1,t1_fejavtk,1579172136.0,This paper is more than 20 years old. How did this never make it into clinical trials? It sounds almost too good to be true...
Physics,fee5h7w,t1_fedu9yt,1579026800.0,Hence their focus on *realistic* SN scenarios. A non rotating perfectly spherically symmetric star is not very realistic.
Physics,fedpt64,t3_eomu0q,1579017268.0,"The scale factor of the expanding universe as a function of time can be directly derived from standard cosmology. There is no analytic solution, but all you have to do is evaluate an integral for any time t to get the expansion factor of the universe at that time."
Physics,fedp3gv,t1_fedm7ja,1579016820.0,"This is wrong. Supernovae like this don't just emit gravitational waves, they also should be detectable by LIGO if they happen anywhere inside our own galaxy. [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0307472)"
Austria,fed1xoy,t3_eodrog,1578994621.0,"The law gets a bit tricky in your case (you can directly look up § 20 WaffG for category B guns if you know german). If you're an EU citizen but do not live in austria (i.e. have a principal residence here) you either need a special permit from your own country in addition to an austrian permit, or you need to argue that you will not leave the country with the weapon. Additionally, you have no right to own such a weapon (unlike austrian citizens), meaning that you may be denied a permit for any reason and not just psychological or criminal issues."
Physics,fctng7l,t1_fcs2otg,1577950150.0,I told you why it's impossible to generate infinite free energy that way. But your argument regarding performed work is nonsense and being dismissive of this fact doesn't make you right either.
