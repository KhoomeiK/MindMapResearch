I think this is why the police haven't contacted him yet. Usually when the police need to talk to you, they talk to you.

Edit:

This from ESPN: A Hollywood police spokesman said Brown was at home with Holt at the time of the incident and they attempted to make contact with him for further questioning but they were unsuccessful before leaving for the day.

The hope in contacting Brown was to determine whether they would bring battery charges against him, but they could not do that Tuesday.
