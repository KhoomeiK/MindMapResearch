legaladvice,ffkwk72,t3_ety9aw,1580030295.0,"Bahaha just no, tell him he's dreamin. Am Australian and am a developer. I've certainly answered a few questions about previous projects. When it has stepped into actual work and effort, that was payed. Typically with a flag fall amount say $500 daily minimum or $100 an hour, whichever is higher. These rates are far lower than any ""consultant"" so they shouldn't blink.
The amount you choose should also be a high enough amount for them to stop bugging you and hire a real replacement for you. Remember to save a portion for paying tax on this income (about a third) You don't need ABN as long as you don't do more than $40000 a year of this kind of work.

They have two options:
1. Hire a developer that is not a complete idiot. Working out others scripts while annoying isn't too hard.

2. Pay you an agreed above market rate to do the work in your spare time.

That's it.

If they are not complete tools they will realise that any court action is not going to get them anything but a huge legal bill, their deadlines missed and possibly a legal spanking for wasting the courts time.

They would even struggle to get an official developer to come back and document an real payed for external software project. But two years? I've never heard of such ridiculous entitled nonsense.

If you weren't an actual developer it is unlikely you were even given company guidelines about software development and documentation. It sounds like this business is too small to even have policies and guidelines for software development. Not that it matters you were never a developer.

Legally policies and procedures have no grounds for anything but as justifications for dismissals, they would probably even struggle to prove that you even wrote the code.

Expecting software support as well is bordering on insanity.

If none of these options satisfy I would consider telling them you are considering feeding this story to the local tv or paper."

AskReddit,feo67ij,t1_feml21o,1579295667.0,"Yes. In my case it was a $5000 test instrument. They asked for duties, and I don't usually carry an invoice for all of my tools was informed that a carnet would avoid the situation. Payed a fraction of the duties and learnt a lesson. The item has to be worth above a certain amount and look new for them to care but an XBox in a third world country will look sufficiently new and valuable to a minimally trained customs agent."
AskReddit,fem8jw6,t1_fem7hif,1579243676.0,"Duties for importing goods is not corruption. 
Deliberately avoiding paying duties can lead to fines that will easily exceed the duties payed, in this case $15 vs a many $100 fine. 

Most countries want to be in control of the goods entering their countries for many legitimate reasons, mostly to make sure taxes on imported goods are being payed. 

Refute what I am saying with some sort of argument or evidence and I will change my mind."
AskReddit,felbvv9,t1_fekdben,1579218547.0,"Yeah this is common for most countries and not really corruption. They just let you pay the duty without really punishing you for being an idiot. 
If the goods look new and are worth above a certain amount. You either need to declare it and potentially pay duty when entering, then potentially pay more duty arriving back to your own country.

 If you don't want to pay a huge duty on a real expensive item you need to organise a Carnet.

UpliftingNews,fe14x74,t1_fe132sg,1578822593.0,"Not to be a buzz kill in your drone idea. But you can scale up a bunch of drones far more effectively with a real water bomber, as far as I'm aware you still must be in sight of them and in direct control of them.

Their weight carrying capacity and range are very low. Even real water bombers aren't really for watering, they are just about laying down fire suppression chemicals where they want to save property or people.

But why scale up drones and water bombers to water plants, when there is already a workforce trained and able to do something far more effective, large diameter poly-pipe for water transport and irrigation. They can be dragged into all sorts of rugged terrain without much work required to support them. Basically any fire trail will be fine."

Been personally involved in a big regeneration project and it takes a lot of time and money to get anything to grow, especially if the water isn't there. These last couple of drought years have been particularly hard in the areas I have been working, and there's been a lot of failure even with the eucalyptus and hardy species being planted."

AusFinance,fcznkzx,t3_ejp3fd,1578105139.0,"All depends whether they need to sell quickly or can wait it out. Your offer may be below their mortgage owing which is a hard pill for them to swallow. Remember these are usually other people with feelings, so yeah depending on how thick skinned they are they may get insulted. Also though giving them a low ball offer may be better than their current no offer, and give them a starting point to negotiate up.

Maybe check the numerous websites that let you see the public information of what it last sold for and when to give you an idea of their current situation. 

If I was being nice in negotiations I would split out what you considered the necessary repairs vs the things that are just your wants and desires to give them as good reasons to low ball so low.

Good luck."

Got some hidden spots I like on Shark island at Fingal bay if you're adequately prepared to cross the spit.

Some stuff at Boat Harbour around the rocks.

Naru Beach on Lake Macquarie, or most places around the Swansea channel are clean.
There's some rocks around Redhead surf house, if it's not too rough.

There's probably others I'm missing, but those ones satisfy my snorkelling urges."
