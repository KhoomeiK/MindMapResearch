Some women need to be approached, try not to use horrible one liners, but say or ask something genuine. Some women need time to ensure you aren’t just working the room, even if it is obvious you aren’t. Be friendly to her friends but not overly so.  You may have to approach and flirt before a woman will reciprocate."

tiedye,fei7oqj,t1_fei63fd,1579132124.0,"Yes, bleach should always be neutralized. When it isn’t, you risk the chance of it shredding in the future. You could get lucky and it may not happen, but the chemical reaction needs to take place, no matter how it is rinsed/laundered. 

Since the cotton count is so high, the procion dyes will be strong enough to help mask the orange. I would still shy away from blue or purple, but not turquoise. You can try to bleach again  and place in the sun for a bit before neutralizing. Sometimes the sun will help make the rust color lighten."
tiedye,fei5jo1,t3_eoxc9t,1579130757.0,"Make sure you neutralize the bleach before you add dye with either 10:1 water:hydrogen peroxide or bleach stop.

While I cannot bring you comfort, I can share some things that have brought me comfort after losing close friends. 
Cry through the pain. 
Write down memories you shared. 
Remember them when something reminds you of them; take time to enjoy that memory. 
Share things about them; it may catch you at first, but try and work through.  
Some of the silliest things may remind you of her, let yourself pause and feel it. 

Try not to allow those final moments to overshadow the life she had and the friend she was to you.

Cooper passed away today, at home, with my husband.  He had been doing so good the past few days. He even ate his food this morning without added incentives and was back to following me around this morning.  So it was a bit of a shock, but these past few days gave us time.  We are pretty sure his heart was struggling, unsure of exactly why.  I’m very sad, but at peace and he wasn’t alone. 

Much of the advice about after was extremely helpful today, and even though I completely broke down when requesting the rainbow bridge at our humane society (which houses RB), I was prepared.  

Thank you ELIS, I will be here helping when and where I can."

Explainlikeimscared,fdeh2tc,t3_ekoemz,1578338875.0,"I wanted to update, especially since everyone was so kind and helpful. We just got back from the vet with Cooper. 

He is a bit anemic and his liver function was ever so slightly elevated.  The vet confirmed what my brain was telling me, but my heart didn’t want to listen for fear I was wrong, that he isn’t in pain at this point. He is guarded and has some weakness in his hind legs. Instead of poking and prodding him further, we are trying to make him comfortable and to be able to enjoy whatever bit of life he has left. He is on one medication and an antibiotic. We will be following up with the vet in a few days and regularly after that to ensure, when the time is ready, we know for certain. 

Thank you everyone for sharing, it really was helpful to mentally prepare to not come home with him and to ask all the things that were on my mind. I know I will never be truly ready, but you all have filled my toolbox with much needed knowledge.  

It is a lot to manage emotionally and I cannot express my appreciation enough for sharing your time, words and experiences.  If I had the means to award, I would.
