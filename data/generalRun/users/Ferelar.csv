Personally I wouldn’t find longevity.... that impressive. I don’t think from a historic perspective we can dispute that absolute rule is generally quite stable. Most of the longest-lasting states in history have had power vested in an individual, generally with power passing on in a hereditary manner. 

But does that make them *better* countries? Does that improve the lives of the common folk, or help them advance the sciences? That question is much more difficult to answer. Even if you only look at it militarily and restrict it to Rome, most of the territorial acquisitions made by the Romans were during the Republic period.

But I’d look back to the fall of the Roman Republic more than the fall of the Western Empire. In fact one of the things that I fear most is what happened after decades of civil war during the Roman Republic. Contemporary accounts suggest that when Octavian/Augustus began consolidating power (though he never referred to himself as Emperor, everyone knew where power truly resided), many of the common folk were quite happy about essentially the collapse of republican (small r) ideals. I can’t quite remember whose writings it was, but he talked about how the common folk had become SO exhausted by all of the democratic processes, constantly having new candidates running for office and making power plays, constantly having to keep up with the issue of the week... they actually were happy at the idea of power being invested in a single individual, and the general sense seems to be one of *relief* that they wouldn’t have to worry about politics any more- that would be decided for them.

wow,fdgjq83,t1_fdexy1e,1578399560.0,"I honestly believe WoD would have been hailed as one of the great expansions if it hadn't come out around the same time as the movie. The movie itself didn't hurt it, but the fact that Blizzard was trying to cash in on the movie rush made them rush things, and that led to cutting out the middle of the arc (we only got parts 1 and 3- that's why for instance Yrel suddenly goes from random civilian/slave that you save into an uber paladin. That was supposed to be a gradual growing) and trying to weld together the remnants of it that weren't cut. Shattrath was supposed to be its entire own tier but effectively got cut- one of the places I think players were most looking forward to playing through considering it was their hub for TBC. It also meant there was a lot less content overall, so max level players felt like they were just sitting around their garrison. On top of that, the movie coming out meant that they wanted to capitalize on recognizable characters over telling a story, so we got some shoehorned stuff in with the Orc Warbosses rather than focusing on telling their story- they felt a little fake and underutilized, more surface characters than deep and impactful.

warcraftlore,fddmtjs,t1_fdd2wrr,1578318085.0,"I got the impression from lore that Fel was not only inherently quicker/more destructive, but that its greater power revolved *around* destruction. That’s not necessarily a problem for Fel users seeking great power- they tend to consider “destructive power” and “power” to be synonymous. 

But the implication I got from playing through each game, and others are free to correct me if it’s been directly contradicted, is that Arcane is more powerful as a *creation* force. Arcane was the magic used by the titans to create, sculpt, and shape entire worlds; Fel seems to be mostly used in lore to destroy or corrupt existing stuff. 

It’s also worth noting that Fel and Arcane are considered polar opposites on the energy “chart”, like life and death magic. That doesn’t necessarily mean that a Fel user couldn’t use arcane (many warlocks started as mages), but it’s possible and even likely that the methods used to master Fel magic would be very different than those to master Arcane. So it’s entirely possible that if, say, an arcane mage abandons his studies in pursuit of power and takes the “quick” route with Fel, he or she may never have mastered the arcane. Aka, a master Fel user might still be a novice or journeyman at the arcane arts. Orrrr... just as possibly, their existence on the same spectrum of order<——> Chaos might mean that mastering one would give unique perspectives on the other. Difficult to say."

At that point his plan to burn Stratholme was not that bad- certainly incredibly ruthless, but by strategically killing the (most likely) infected people, it would prevent their position from being overrun and hopefully allow them to regroup and form a solid defense to protect the rest of the area. 

I think being abandoned by Uther and Jaina is what caused Arthas to double down and decide that all he cared about was vengeance. I honestly see it as Uther failing.

And if he’d decreed with all of his royal power that everyone would be forcibly relocated, it’s possible he would’ve been assassinated or faced riots. That’s a pretty massive shift in regal policy."
