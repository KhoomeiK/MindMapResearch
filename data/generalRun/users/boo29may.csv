psychology,ff0q1d9,t1_fezt3n5,1579471234.0,"Yes! That is a great way of putting it. I never thought of it, but that is exactly it, music with more lyrics is like an audio book. So, someone playing an instrument is actually different than listening to a published song. I actually enjoy watching a musician play, I really enjoy seing the effort, how immersed they are in the action. I find the act of playing the instrument by really good musicians beautiful and I appreciate how smoth it is. I find the perfection in it amazing. The actual music they produce I don't particularly enjoy. Violin is actually an instrument I particularly don't like, the sound is just unpleasant to me. Piano is my favourite. The weird thing to me, is the lack of emotion brought by the music. It is frustrating, because I wish I could feel it."
psychology,fezqfsi,t1_fezoffp,1579460352.0,"I prefer music with more lyrics. Like country music because it feels more like singing than modern music which is just noise to me. Music just never said anything to me, like the sounds themselves. I never felt the different notes really. I just never felt good emotions from music like I hear people say they do. It is kinda like having the TV onn in the room with a show you are not interested in. You don't dislike it, the background noise doesn't bother you, sometimes it's nice that the room is not quite, but it doesn't bring any positive emotions either. I do have a few songs I like, but it is nothing more than a feeling of nostalgia."

AmItheAsshole,fez3joy,t1_fez1m1n,1579453560.0,I don't know. Maybe I'm biased because I've seen older people in muslim families to a million times worse.

Because she was told so by her parents. This doesn't justify it. But it makes sense that after being freed from her family she understood the wrongful doing and apologised. OP is still NTA as he has the right to not forgive her.
