AskReddit,fgb71rd,t1_fg8nefa,1580659153.0,"I think that it's also worth looking at the cause/other side. The reality is that in many households, the work is not split equally and the child rearing and chores fall a lot more on the woman. This is probably especially the case of older generations. Even today, especially in more conservative places, it is still the norm. 

Maybe the people praising you are those who had to do a lot it themselves so are happy others for which that isn't the case, and decide to give some positive reinforcement.

I say this as a father myself who has been on the receiving end of such comment. And I try to take them with that in mind. It's not meant as ""men suck, good job for not sucking"" but ""this is a sign of progress and equality and I'm happy to see it"" or ""your wife is lucky"" because, frankly, having an equal partner is not necessarily the norm."
Frasier,fgb4qen,t3_exmnzq,1580658501.0,"Fun fact: for almost all of Frasier's time on air, Seattle was in the AFC West and was rivals with KC. There's a reasonable chance Marty would remember that rivalry more than the more recent SF one"
worldnews,fg8274l,t1_fg81jyb,1580607543.0,"Impeachment, removal and, most of all, a fair trial with witnesses were pretty popular with independents. These are the people who determine elections"
worldnews,fg7q8jo,t1_fg7ds1d,1580598737.0,"The reality is that impeachment was never about getting him removed. The Democrats knew there was 0% chance of Trump being removed. They did it for 3 reasons:

* it had to be done. Trump had committed impeachable offenses and their base wanted it for a while. They couldn't not do it.

* as a mechanism to get this info/corruption more in the public eye. The more evidence of his treason and the more people who see it, the better

* as a way to put the GOP on the record. In this case, they basically ran a sham trial with a sham acquittal.

All of this would, hopefully, help them in the 2020 elections and that's the only real solution. 

Bolton would have simply increased the impact of 2 and 3."
nfl,fg7pmd0,t1_fg7lbby,1580598301.0,You're not wrong but if we are going to use QB wins as a thing then we should at least be consistent about it.

AskAnAmerican,fg7pdgh,t1_fg4w5ts,1580598127.0,"It's not really bipartisan. 

McConnell knows he has 2 votes to spare so he lets those who need to vote for it do so (i.e. those up for election in blue states). In almost every vote with a few GOP ""breaking ranks"" it is planned well in advance. The only difference here is that Romney actually did break ranks meaning McConnell only had one vote to give up."
AskAnAmerican,fg7p6js,t1_fg5rs1i,1580597993.0,What if I told you both are incorrect?
politics,fg7osz6,t1_fg6s1ss,1580597725.0,"I don't think we know for sure if it was out of principle. We don't know what his long game is. For example, if he's aiming for a 2024 Presidential run then he's laying the groundwork to appeal to moderates and independents.

I agree it wasn't because he was ""allowed to"" or for any allegiance to Trump/the GOP but it could very well be for selfish reasons rather than principle."
hockey,fg7nytb,t3_excqfu,1580597139.0,"I read the title and immediately thought of Jack Hughes and wondered if I had missed some huge scoring surge.

amazonprime,fg4hlep,t3_ew5ud9,1580503445.0,Same thing is happening to me with community.  I'm actually doing a 30 day of trial of prime. Not really selling me on it.

baseball,fg35h7q,t1_fg1uu1u,1580471124.0,That is mentioned quite a lot in the article.
science,ffyqx15,t1_ffyfpzo,1580352955.0,"Also that line is essentially meaningless. It is not an objective measure of how liberal or conservative the ideologies are. In other words, that line is not an objective political centre. If you took Canada's ""centre"" and put it in there as a black line, it would probably be in the middle of the Democratic group and the picture painted would be Dems generally being a centrist party with heavy tails on both sides and the GOP being a far right party. 

It basically says the Democrats have a more broad/diverse spectrum whereas the GOP is fairly homogeneous. And that the two parties are very distinct now. That is what the plot is supposed to show - that the parties have grown further apart."
DenverBroncos,ffypt20,t3_evwp8z,1580352192.0,"Does ""former Bronco"" mean Sanders or is there someone else?"
nfl,ffygnka,t1_ffxhwj0,1580345971.0,Rodgers has played in/won only one. Same with Brees. Big Ben won two but both were relatively early in his career. Rivers has never made it. Brett Favre made two back to back early-ish in his career and then never again.  Wilson is in a similar boat as Favre but obviously lots of time left.
fatlogic,ffy0joa,t3_evn8xi,1580336133.0,E equals m c squared. Einstein had to arbitrarily square the speed of light to make it work. What a fraud!
BoneAppleTea,ffvnmok,t1_ffv894c,1580268390.0,"Yeah we were told that there are a tons of risk factors: smoking, alcohol use, weight, health conditions, medication, the bed itself, blankets/pillows and more. It's much easier to say ""don't do it"" than ""it's okay if..."". 

It's the same with things like alcohol, caffeine, exercise, exercise etc. during pregnancy. It's much easier to say ""don't do it"" than to educate people on the subtleties."

ColoradoAvalanche,ffmm0e4,t3_eu8izz,1580056495.0,I think it's just bad luck that the Avs are in the same division as the host team.

MurderedByWords,ffevuaw,t1_ffe3nim,1579867699.0,"You're generally right, it is defined that way to make other things consistent. 

However there is a retroactive justification. You can use factorial to find out how many ways to order things. If I give you three books and tell you to put them on a shelf there are 3! way you can do it. In general n books would have n! orders. If I give you 0 books, how many orderings are there? In a way, 1, the empty shelf."
MurderedByWords,ffdwczc,t1_ffdth8c,1579830562.0,Haha just a side note but you can also parse this as 0! = 1 which is also correct. But I was reading that and trying to figure out why you were bring that up.

nfl,ff7bhy9,t1_ff6cbv3,1579645559.0,"This swings too far the other way though. If a defensive player is in a position to give up a first down catch, they just commit DPI. The calculus of giving up a 4th and 1 vs a 1st and goal from the 1 is much different."

Like I am in an office job that's unionized. We have our share of slackers and they are hard to fire because the union will protect them. It doesn't matter that everyone else on their team wants them gone and has to work harder to make up for it"

Previously, Reddit filtered out some threads from your home page. I'm not sure exactly what the criteria was but it seemed to be sticky threads - so megathreads, weekly/daily threads etc. These were not filtered on popular. 

 These would only be viewed by those going to that sub and wouldn't have a lot of upvotes. These are now not filtered from home, so get a lot more upvotes and thus make it to popular."
