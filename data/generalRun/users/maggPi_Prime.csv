The other day I started humming a song I'd written and forgotten some 30 years ago, and liked the fragments enough to re-compose (is that a word? The opposite of ""decompose,"" anyway, haha) it and get rid of some bits that weren't that great anyway. 

I say ""song,"" I'm no musician. It's more sung poetry. ...Damn it. I'm supposed to play a cleric, not a bard ffs. 

_ANYWAY..._  

In my own classes, I teach my kids something similar to you regarding characters, but a lot more basic. Good guy or villain, if you can't relate to your character, no one else will and both you and your audience will lose interest. Also, the ""geographical"" setting is just as much a character, and affects those within itself. Is it sci-fi? Real world? Surreal? If it's surreal, it needs to be consistent in its inconsistencies, etc., and each OC's reactions to their surroundings must also make sense to the narrative. 

Annnd I'm gonna stop. I'm so looking forward to my own classes that I'm teaching them before they begin, lol! 

When you're teaching your kids, and you come across something really good, no matter how small, ask ""may I use this as an example? It's really good and I like it."" You don't have to share the whole thing (I know how private poetry can be to a kid), just that little bit. I make sure to do this with everybody, rather than focus on one person. It seems to encourage creativity and validate their ability. I kind of discovered it by accident, and just kept running with it when it worked. I don't know how big your classes are, mine are pretty small, so it's easy to make sure everybody gets a turn having their work support what I'm teaching. We all learn from each other, and I've incorporated a few new tricks myself. 

And if something makes you feel disillusioned, take an emotional step back and an objective step forward. I've had an instance where I was shocked to find myself disliking a child. So, I took a look at what bothered me and then worked to guide the kid to a more appropriate outcome while also praising their virtues. The results were mixed, truth be told. But that was my own failure, not the child's. And luckily nobody seemed to notice my bias. Which was shoddy of me, and I've learned better since. 

Sigh. Shutting up now. 

Good luck! I know you'll have fun!"
writing,fe5beo5,t1_fe55umd,1578867312.0,"Yeah, you've hit on some points I had in the back of my mind; like learning incorrect procedure and/or practicing bad habits thinking they are correct. 

One of the most important things a would-be writer can do as ""studying,"" is to read a fuck-tonne of books. Why would anyone who hates reading want to become a writer? I mean, if one wants to develop a story based on their favourite RPG characters, there are host sites dedicated to fanfiction. 

Let actual bookworms choose whether or not to clutter an already competitive market. 

Now, as to your impending teacherdom, I'm so excited for you!!

Yeah, it's scary, but kids are easier to teach than adults, because they're still in the middle of their careers as students and are primed for learning. They are professional sponges! As long as you don't worry about sticking too rigidly to the lesson plan/curriculum to be able to answer their practical (and sometimes sassy) questions you'll be fine. 

I've had to dial my expectations back in terms of what is ""obvious"" to me, as not necessarily being obvious to others, regardless of age. Encourage corny jokes, and have fun!"
writing,fe500cd,t1_fe4rnos,1578864397.0,"What a shame. I mean, it's basic learning.

We forget how in early childhood that letters, simple sums or even motor skills are difficult when they are new but become easier/second nature as we repeat them by rote. 

Even the kids in my classes have to be reminded that things only get easy with practice (""boring"" repetition), and the very oldest I've taught has been the venerable age of almost-thirteen. 

No one is born being good at anything and only routine hones our skills in our natural aptitudes beyond those tasks in which the same application brings us to mere competency. 

Our egos get in the way of our own progression, ""I'm an adult, I already know how to do this!"" I myself am guilty of this, in that when illustrating what I've written, I stick to the media over which I have better control (such as pen and ink) rather than exploring something more in character to the story (such as watercolours). I hate giving myself up to the vulnerability of ""not being good at something.""

We are all fallible, and children are more easily influenced by their parents' agendas/examples. No one is faultless. We celebrate such people as Mandela, Ghandi, Winston Churchill, Mother Theresa, and John Lennon, after all. 

At any rate, bubble-bursting aside, voting and working for change are definitely necessary, which includes informing or children better than we were informed, and educating ourselves further as well. 

Unfortunately, some of the heavier, more drastic changes are at the hands of the very people who need it the most. We see China at the brink of civil war, with heavy unrest and retaliatory propaganda clouding the truth. Will they be able to achieve their goals with minimal bloodshed, or are they headed to a devastation before the herald they seek?

aww,fe3on8d,t1_fe3hcq4,1578851395.0," So who are ""we?"" North Americans? Europeans? The problem with ""developing countries"" is that they often have politically controlled education systems. As in; restriction of education available to poorer classes and girls. It can be considered as a way to subjugate the populace for easier political control. So it's not even a matter of educating the poor, but to get the education consistently available to all in the first place. And Foreign Aid is a temporary bandaid at best, along with a brief fundraising drive that is easily forgettable in the eyes of rich, white countries. 

As for reforming our political systems, yes, I agree. And it's why people like Malala and Greta have politely, and increasingly less so, been raising a stink in the UN and worldwide. But why are we leaving it to our children to fight when it's our responsibility as ""parents"" to fight _for_ them? 

I officially live below the poverty line in Canada, but I recognise that I currently have a home and fresh water, food, etc., while billions do not. I donate a small amount monthly to a world child organisation and a world animal organisation.

I also plan to see what eligibility I have to become a foster parent when my own kid moves out.

There's also the possibility of giving him mindfulness exercises, like paying attention to the structures in different movements of classical music. What slows him down better, Beethoven or Tchaikovsky? What agitates him more, Wagner or Mozart? 

I suggest classical music, because of its complexity and length. It satisfies an active brain better.

Many Christian sects still believe suicide a sin, and instead of getting her the help she needs, she may be somehow punished or shamed for it. 

Going through the school might be the best of the ""direct"" options, but could also backfire badly. The asoptee community forums others have suggested sound like the better long-term way to go. They will help her confidence and encourage her how to seek help at school. 

Do be careful about her sharing her suicidal thoughts with any local Chinese community, as some American-Chinese communities have similar taboos about suicide as some American Christians: It would risk her being being shut down/dismissed conversationally or even ostracized after having been previously welcomed."
IDontWorkHereLady,fcnadj5,t1_fclpjj3,1577807310.0, We should all work harder at improving ourselves rather than patting ourselves on the back as heroes for stooping to their levels. There's a difference between defending oneself and being an edgy jerk.
