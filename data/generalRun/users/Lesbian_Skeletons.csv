television,ffa9aj0,t1_ffa53d3,1579730387.0,"Yes and no. It sounds like you got maybe a quarter of the way through it. It's a war story in that it takes place during a war, the politics of it are discussed at length, the nature of war, and military operations of the war have a direct effect on the story, but very little of the main story takes place in the middle of the conflict. It's almost like an ever-present supporting character, always looming over the main plot."

television,ff6tupb,t1_ff6k8rz,1579634762.0,"They're all completely different genres. The first was noir, the second was a war story, the third was...very introspective. The themes and settings are all different enough that it's a little unfair to compare them to each other."

You want to be vegan? Great, you do you. Just don’t be an asshole and don’t let it define who you are, or at the very least don’t be obnoxious about it."
JoeRogan,fepvhjq,t3_eq5phd,1579332774.0,"Good episode so far, but for a guy that claims to be a fan Bill really doesn't seem like he knows Joe's humor. They're talking about marriage and divorce and Joe is clearly being sarcastic and Bill is buying it hook, line, and sinker. ""She really trained you what to say buddy"", Joe even has to go, ""you think I'm being serious?"". How such blatant sarcasm got by him is beyond me.  
Edit: Okay, the end got super awkward, Bill is hilariously butthurt about Joe's criticism. Extra funny since I watched it right after the RDJ show, talk about two very different egos."
