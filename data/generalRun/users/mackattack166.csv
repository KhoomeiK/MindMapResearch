facepalm,ffjmg53,t1_ffj3dum,1580001631.0,Exactly what I’m saying? If you are unable to stand on a scale because you are worried about what it says than you probably need help and who better to help you than a doctor who has spent half their life being educated on helping people get healthy.
facepalm,ffigsiv,t3_etsmxb,1579973514.0,"If you don’t want to know your weight, you can tell your doctor you don’t want to see your weight and they won’t tell you or show you. However, if you are so against knowing how much you weigh, you should probably try to fix that so you don’t make such a big deal about standing on a scale."
AmItheAsshole,ffhi4pb,t3_etm4cw,1579936280.0,"NTA Obviously but YWBTA if you don’t report them!!! If they’re abusing their animals whose to say they aren’t abusing their kids. They say abusing animals is step one of being a crazy psycho killer. So please, report them and save that poor baby kitties life. She will be so much happier with you :("
AskMen,ffe28kr,t3_esruuu,1579834800.0,"I like when men wear their rings:/ they’re hard to get used to but once you are used to and as long as it fits, You shouldn’t even notice it there. Growing up I never once saw my dad wear his wedding ring and it always bothered me a little. Turns out he was having an affair the whole time."
Im5andthisismacaroni,ffe22pz,t3_et30v0,1579834678.0,Is that... cheese pasta?! That can’t be *gulps* Mac and cheese :/
TrueOffMyChest,ff52nh8,t3_eqdgge,1579578562.0,"Ah an intelligent man. More men would get lucky if they would just see the cues women set up for them. Most of the girls I know are constantly dealing with boys not taking hints, but are just too scared to be more obvious so nothing ever comes of it."
facepalm,ff4tgs3,t3_ern4kz,1579572044.0,I think they’re more fun to eat if you can look at them in your bowl and agree that they look like the littlest tiniest condoms ever. But that’s just me.
AmItheAsshole,fevw4nw,t3_eqpzmz,1579402188.0,"YTA. Just because you’re sober now doesn’t mean you get to be forgiven for being an addict. You did shitty things when you were on drugs, so now you have to pay the consequences of that. You should feel extremely thankful that you are even being given the opportunity to pay her back. If you were my sister, I’m not sure how easily I would forgive you for what you did."
unpopularopinion,fevuy3l,t3_eqpu6w,1579401839.0,"I agree. It’s supposed to be a free country, and legal prostitution might help with the issue of illegal prostitution."
unpopularopinion,feo9z1k,t3_eq6ldy,1579297196.0,"There are a million reasons why people still don’t feel refreshed after sleeping 8+ hours, even if they are healthy. Maybe you are lucky to not have any stress in your life, but I’m a full time college student and while I exercise and eat healthy, I don’t feel like I ever get enough sleep to get me through the whole day everyday without some form of caffeine, whether that be tea or coffee. Plus, studies say some black coffee in your life is actually good for you."
unpopularopinion,fel8kh3,t3_epqi7w,1579216399.0,"People are so weird. Literally who cares if you want attention, who cares if you seriously just want to dye your hair. I have personally been dying my hair since I was 12 and haven’t ever stopped, so most people don’t even know this is not my real hair color. The world will be a happier place once people stop getting booty tickled and all weird about everyone just doing what they wish to do with their own lives."
unpopularopinion,fel7tnt,t3_epq6m9,1579215928.0,What is your definition of huge? I think curves are cuter than looking like a wooden plank.
unpopularopinion,feg6xt2,t1_feg6lti,1579079876.0,"Yeah I know many professionals have highly trained pigeons that come home, and I’m sure those trainers all do love their birds. I still think it’s sort of cruel, and I am not sure I believe that there are no casualties or accidents that happen."
mildlyinteresting,feeo0ee,t3_eorih0,1579037626.0,"It’s very cute, but it kind of seems like a diss. Girls like receiving flowers, and for whatever reason she has specifically noted that you never spontaneously buy her flowers. Instead of mocking her with tiny (but cute) bouquets, maybe try and figure out what you can do for your girlfriend to make sure she notices that you care. You’d be surprised how much a 10 dollar bouquet of flowers can mean to someone."
AmItheAsshole,fecfwwl,t3_eoeslw,1578972953.0,"I’m gonna go with NAH. I guess I can’t imagine not wanting to have my late husbands child, a piece of him to have in my life until I die. This pregnancy is the very last living thing that is tied to this brother. Desperate times call for desperate measures, and I know that it would be hard not to ask a SIL to consider not aborting my late brothers first and obviously only child. However, your SIL does have a right to do as she wishes with her own body and in the best interest of herself. This story is sad all around and I hope you all come to a solution."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fecf9z9,t3_eoewmx,1578972526.0,"Out of curiosity, What leads kids to draw on walls? I was always an artsy kid who loved to draw and paint. However, I know for a fact I never colored or painted anything that I wasn’t supposed to. I think it’s entertaining when kids decide to make the walls, floors and furniture in their house an art piece, but I wonder why that’s such a common phenomenon with some kids but not others."
AmItheAsshole,feakm90,t1_fea8jwp,1578949913.0,Ah I see I misread! I love it too.
AmItheAsshole,fea4yxy,t1_fe6zkoc,1578944420.0,"I agree, and I understand. I’m just saying that’s the way (most) women are. No matter how confident/ secure they are"
AmItheAsshole,fe6x7kx,t3_eo1c1c,1578907109.0,"I think all the people responding are men. YTA. Yes she did ask, but she’s your girlfriend! While I’m sure you have noticed her flaws, that doesn’t mean you can’t think she’s perfect even with them. Even though I know I’m definitely not a 10, I’d still want my boyfriend to lie and tell me I’m an 11 (and I’m definitely not super insecure like a lot of girls). She said she was feeling bad and looked to you for reassurance, and you reassured her, but not in the direction she needed."
unpopularopinion,fe6wrxb,t3_eo1k3f,1578906879.0,"If you have shit to hide, don’t buy smart technology. Obviously. If someone listened to what my Alexa heard all day, I can assure you that they would be incredibly bored."
unpopularopinion,fe6vsnl,t3_eo10lh,1578906344.0,you can add ANYTHING to Mac n cheese. Truffle Mac n cheese? Amazing. Mac n cheese with pesto? Delicious. Mac n cheese with hot dogs? A childhood MEMORY. Mac n cheese in a bread bowl with garlic and extra cheese and bread crumbs? WHAT is not to like!! Gosh. Unpopular opinion for sure my friend.
AmItheAsshole,fe6pn80,t3_enzvit,1578899569.0,"NTA. Wtf? Your mom seems... odd. Lol. If it’s actually your lamp, then it’s your lamp. Tell your mom and brother to buy ~another~ lamp since you can literally get salt lamps for less than 15 dollars."
funny,fe5zytl,t3_enw1u8,1578878702.0,This is incredibly unfortunate. Sometimes the brave can’t win.
AmItheAsshole,fe5zh6d,t3_envyl3,1578878390.0,"NTA! Girl that’s your hair. It’s always nice to donate, and I guarantee that if you could ensure your hair would be made into a wig, someone would definitely enjoy it. However, if you need the money this hair would give you, then do what you need to do. Donations are always appreciated, but you’re worth something and so it your hair."
AmItheAsshole,fdi3fj8,t3_elhs27,1578435040.0,"NTA- break up with your boyfriend. This sounds toxic. He isn’t entitled to make you cook for him; that is a TREAT not a responsibility on your part. You were visiting your new niece/nephew, he should understand that you also have a job and other things to do like a normal person."
AmItheAsshole,fdg5e3k,t3_el7gdj,1578380698.0,"YTA for even considering asking. I mean Jesus, the guy lost his freaking dog. A family member. Dogs get out, and sometimes it’s the owners fault, but accidents happen. Slow down if you see animals on side walks or near a road; even if it’s just a squirrel."
shittyfoodporn,fdg56ip,t3_el73nt,1578380455.0,Those chicken nuggets almost look like they’re still frozen
unpopularopinion,fdg2haz,t1_fdg24vk,1578377572.0,And I’m not even against the death penalty either. I just think there can be worse things than death.
unpopularopinion,fdg2gbg,t1_fdg24vk,1578377544.0,I guess i don’t know lol but I feel like being ostracized from society and dealing with what you did is a better punishment than death.
unpopularopinion,fdg1xo7,t1_fdg1ou7,1578377018.0,"Oh that’s sad. What about oatmeal cookies WITH chocolate, like in an ITS-IT?"
unpopularopinion,fdg1vnw,t3_el6wdd,1578376962.0,I personally think living in a world where people know you are a child molester is a worse punishment than escaping via death. Every child molester should have to announce themselves to those around them or have signs on their doors stating their crime. Death is an easy out in my opinion. Let them rot in jail or face the wrath of the public if they’re free.
aww,fdg1n36,t3_el6th0,1578376723.0,Look at that big toother. I love you Bucky and I hope you enjoy your new home.
funny,fdg1jup,t3_el6eki,1578376635.0,So cute!! But your parents should be careful having animals that are so curious about deers. My 6 month old puppy at the time found one very exciting and ended up having to go to the ER and almost died because it kicked him with its hoof:/
unpopularopinion,fdg1fco,t3_el6ioc,1578376510.0,"I agree with the oatmeal, but I don’t really like raisins. Oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, however, are fantastic."
funny,fdg18xa,t3_el6b3r,1578376334.0,You should get him one of those blankets that looks like a tortilla. Everyone likes being swaddled like a burrito
