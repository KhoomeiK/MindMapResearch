One therapist (who I had a phone session with that particular day) called 911 on me because I had a suicide attempt the day before but with *no physical injury*. I also received help & was not feeling suicidal anymore. I ended up in a shitty hospital with a terrible inpatient unit (unfortunately, this is the norm here). I was traumatized from my stay there. I ended up becoming suicidal *again* because I had to stay there, even though I was fine. It was like being punished for being sick.

The second therapist was a family therapist. She told me that I wasn't abused & what my parents did was just ""bad parenting."" She also kept insisting I have autism despite the fact that I had a psychological evaluation done which showed no signs of autism & proving that I was misdiagnosed with autism as a child. I posted about it before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/edhqgb/whats_the_line_between_bad_parenting_abuse/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).
