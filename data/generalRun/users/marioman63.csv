i feel that one should focus on the gameplay, not the commentary. these are VIDEO GAME streams first and foremost (obviously not everything on twitch is video games, but im assuming thats what you chose to stream). focus should be on the game. if i dont think the way im playing the game is important, then i wont bother. like i said, i turn my camera on for osu because its a very fast game, but i wont bother for first person shooters cause its normal to play that way. if i got really good at star craft for example, id probably turn on a mouse cam for that too."
