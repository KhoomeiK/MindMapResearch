She makes mistakes, but typically doesn't do many shitty things, especially to those she cares about.

It really doesn't matter what bullshit you come back with, you're a bitter old crone (most likely obese and haggard, like so many other antisocial crazy dog ladies) who trolls low level dog forums with people asking questions like ""can I train my dog to stop shitting in the house"" with you thinking you're the only one who's figured it out. Your ""expert professional advice"" includes shit like ""the breed you picked sucks, kill it and start over."" You're nothing but negativity and wannabe gatekeeping and everywhere you go people tell you to fuck off. And I bet you think the common denominator is literally everyone else on the planet, not you.

You hate men because they're repulsed by your hideous personality. You claim to reject relationships so that way your lack of one looks to be a choice rather than the ineptitude to gain one. Making ""childfree"" your entire personality at your age (past childbearing) is beyond ridiculous and it's a humongous personality red flag - it's incredibly easy to FUCKING AVOID CHILDREN if you don't like them. That's what I do, you dolt. It just further emphasizes how insecure you are, that you have to harass people on the internet where your gross self can remain anonymous and find things like parenthood to shit on in order to elevate your own sense of worth... which you obviously do not derive from your million dollar government dog training program. Probably because it only exists in your head."
BanPitBulls,ff8o96g,t1_ff83r8w,1579688581.0,"OP needs to read these two responses right here. No one advocating for the woman to euthanize the puppy likes the idea of killing a baby animal, not even a pitbull, which at that age is barely a pitbull. It's a tough situation, but the emotional toll is on the owners, as the dog will have no idea leading up to the event and will peacefully, painlessly slip away. It's an ending that humans in horrible amounts of pain dream about but are denied in most countries and states. Consider that.

OP - is euthanasia really worse than languishing in the confinement of a cold, noisy shelter run and being passed from home to home, only to return to the shelter and eventually be euthanized having lived a life of fear, anger and misery? Is it worth putting countless adults, children, dogs and other animals at risk as irresponsible owners pass a dog with behavioural issues around?"
BanPitBulls,ff8n89z,t1_ff85nqj,1579687015.0,"The AKC is not the gold standard for dogs. Many are byb dogs, many are severely inbred with horrible behavioural issues, and many are physically deformed. Plus, many working dogs such as border collies are registered with a breed-specific association (such as the ABCA, which does not allow dual enrollment with the AKC) which emphasizes health, temperament and working ability and usually has more scrutinizing health tests performed before breeding occurs. There are also purpose-bred mutts (that cannot be AKC registered) such as lurchers used for all manner of dog sports like hunting, lure coursing, agility, flyball, herding, etc. The high impact of these sports often requires the dog to be intact as desexing has a negative effect on bone density, muscle mass and joint strength. 

The other caveat is that it's exceptionally easy to register a litter with the AKC. They don't have to meet any kind of conformation standards, so someone could register a garden variety pitbull litter in the AKC as Staffordshire bull terriers.

I think the only way to go about it is BSL. If it looks like a pit, it gets flagged for mandatory desexing. If the owner wants to contend its heritage they can provide a dog DNA test proving it's actually a lab/boxer/terrier/sharpei/weimaraner/dalmatian mix."

Point to make, regardless of breed - if you have a legitimate service dog, then it needs a legitimate harness that very clearly designates it as such in plain English (or whatever national language) so that immigrants, children and normal people who aren't obsessed with a goddamn cartoon show can immediately identify it as such. No one is going to take you or your dog seriously if it has cartoon character quotes all over its harness.

Now, considering breed - the OP claimed to be ""disabled"" and that the dog was ""medical equipment."" Obviously pitbulls are not cut out for any type of service, but what the hell could it possibly be doing for her? And if it really were such a serious requirement, why would she want to invalidate it with a joke harness? Oh, because like 100% of other service pitbulls, it's not medically necessary and she just wants attention on top of putting society at risk.

I've seen ESAs at Disney World and such with stupid harnesses - one was a golden retriever with its fur dyed purple and blue, wearing a saddle blanket and rainbow harness saying AUTISM SERVICE DOG. I completely don't doubt the owner had autism, but I really question the need for a non-medical dog at fucking *Disney World,* especially one with a long coat and a BLANKET in 100 degree humid weather."
rawpetfood,ff5jp0v,t3_erigv7,1579596077.0,"Great advice here so far - but I will also suggest the Ross Wells premade blends called Titan Blue and Titan Red, both AAFCO approved for all life stages. Depending on where you live - if you can find a Ross Wells co-op, you can get the blend for about $1.50 per lb or less. If there isn't one nearby like in my case, a company called Rah Raw ships the food in bulk orders and even with shipping it works out to about $2.60 per lb. My dog LOVES it, and it's easy to add supplements to (goat's milk, eggs, sardines, veggies, coconut oil cuz he's ashy af, occasional raw meaty bones).

I'm going to assume that people who own labs, pointers, hounds, etc. to actually work in the field go through similar sport/working line registrations, where dogs might not be as pretty but their behaviour and working ability is much easier to predict.

A husky that doesn't pull sleds should be allowed to run frequently.

Penting those dogs up almost always results in horrible behavioural issues. Border collies will start herding children, labs will chew up the whole house, huskies will jump the fence and roam.

4. Don't have other pets

5. Don't have children

6. Don't invite guests into your house (unless the dog is locked away)

The only application I see for the breed is boar hunting. They're too stupid, stubborn and unpredictable to do anything else. I could see a VERY niche few people properly keeping the dogs in 6-sided kennels, transporting them in individual cages and boar hunting with them in remote areas. But they're what's known as ""throwaway"" dogs; you don't let a good, trained scenthound attack prey and risk injury, whereas pitbulls will latch onto prey no matter the damage they sustain. They're expendable compared to any other working dog which is highly valued."
BanPitBulls,fdbvl1g,t1_fdb9i45,1578262665.0,"My first border collie was a rescue, and he was absolutely amazing as a pet. Impeccably trained and behaved, loved nothing more than to fetch, swim and follow commands. But he also hated other dogs (wasn't aggressive but would growl/snap) which constantly made me nervous. He freaked out during thunderstorms and fireworks. He barked at every leaf that blew by the front door. He had genetic issues (mainly IBD) which caused him to shit all over the house near the end of his life. And I don't think he ever really loved me the way a dog usually does.

My current border collie came from a reputable breeder. He has no health issues, no neurotic behaviours or fears, never barks, loves all dogs and people, and actually shows affection and concern for me unlike my last dog. I loved my last dog, but my current dog is inarguably better from a genetic standpoint, which shows in all facets of his behaviour and personality.
