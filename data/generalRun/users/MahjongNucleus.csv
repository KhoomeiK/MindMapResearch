LivestreamFail,ffb1wfn,t3_esjg4l,1579749724.0,"There's a shortage of quality health and mental healthcare in rural America. I grew up in a town of about 1,183 people, most of which is below the poverty line.

Most rural clinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and are usually overworked. Nearest quality psychiatric care is usually in the bigger cities that are 50 or more miles out, and costs an arm and leg. You know what's closer and a lot cheaper than therapy? Pills and booze.

Rural suicide rates are through the roof, and it's only going to get worse before anything changes."
