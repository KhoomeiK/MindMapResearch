This place took me away from feeling like a complete oddity, accepted in my society but not understood, viewed as an eccentric at best and a freak at worst. This was during a time when I didn't pass, and even though my friends and family used the correct pronouns, it was a constant struggle to stay affirmed in my identity because it didn't feel like anyone else saw it. It really helped to hear other people talk about feeling the same way. This place taught me that there was a whole community of people who saw me for who I am, and it taught me that I could, in turn, offer that feeling of acceptance to another person. I had never felt the joy of making another person feel valid, because I didn't know how to validate myself. I learned how to do both on this sub and other trans subs, and I don't just think it helped me with my transition, I think it helped me become a more rounded, compassionate person.
In conclusion, I think you should do what's best for you, but this sub is crucial to a lot of our mental health."

educationalgifs,ff1n34o,t3_er1drs,1579481917.0,"For those wondering, these comments from u/MoonlightsHand explain a few things:

This is a Tollens reaction process (which actually ISN'T how a majority of modern mirrors are made). A Tollens reaction is a process in which a solution of silver nitrate, ammonia, and usually sodium hydroxide are mixed with an aldehyde compound and allowed to sit. Aldehydes cleave the silver from the nitrate and it deposits out of solution on clean surfaces within the bath. 

This is an old process, and it's no longer the normal way to produce mirrors. Since the mirror is silver-backed, it costs more.
...

Today most are made by vacuum-deposition of aluminium onto glass. They place a sheet of clean glass just above a sheet of aluminium, drain absolutely all the air from the room, and then heat the aluminium from below. Aluminium heats up and then deposits on the cooler glass, forming a very thin reflective layer. This is a LOT cheaper than a silvering process.

...

Silver reflects slightly more light than aluminium does, but the difference is not significant for household uses. Comparing a silvered vs aluminium-deposited mirror at home will yield negligible detectable difference because to be honest the human eye is staggeringly good at compensating for brightness, and it's extremely unlikely you'd notice it. On the other hand, for scientific equipment, silvered mirrors are usually preferred because they reflect about 95% of light vs aluminium's ~90%, and because the layer is usually a little less deformed (vacuum deposition isn't always even). While an eye wouldn't see the difference, a laser photometer would.

The BIG difference, though, is that a household mirror's reflective layer (regardless of material) is on its back side, while a scientific mirror has the layer on its front side. This means that a household mirror has a protective layer of glass to shield the reflective metal, but in a scientific experiment this would refract the light and fuck up resolution. They keep the reflective layer on the front, which makes it MUCH more fragile but much better for precise measurement."
