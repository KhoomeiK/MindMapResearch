Those feel good stories about the homeless person who with a bit of help cleaned themselves up and got themselves off the streets. Not completely unreasonable. Problem is they are a rather small minority in the homless groups you are noticing and causing problems. 

The homeless groups who tend to cause problems are the ones with many issues beyond being homeless and while a free house might seem a good first step you are missing a step where you need to get homeless people to engage with the offer in the first place. Remember most will have had homes at some point and will have reasons why they can't function in that enviroment. Even with a free home if you screem at the voices in your head at 3am you won't keep it for long.

Or did they? In any case the setence is rather vauge. They could certianly see that a number plate existed but if they can't read it can they accurately capture it?

For film cameras resolution is governed by lens design and film size. Its pretty cheap to scale film up to large format and beyond. Its well within the budget of an intelligence agency to commission custom lenses to go with them. So having that good a resolution isn't much of an achievement on its own. Probably cost in the range of a few million (we know rich arabs have purchased custom lenses and the Leica 1600mm cost around 2 million).

>Now imagine how good our current cameras and imaging systems are that the general public doesn’t know about.

Not that much better than what you can buy. Sharper lenses are certainly possible (lens rentals once released the data for an unreleased lens that was better than anything on the market) but things you can buy (zeiss otus) are already pretty darn sharp (and you can always bin existing lenses if you need sharper).

In terms of sensor tech sony sensors are probably the best all round sensors. The NRO have a budget of around $10 billion. For that budget will be able to get sensors that perform better in specific areas but given the other things they needs to spend money on they are unlikely to have better all rounders.

That assumes they want to force concessions. Sniping off bits of city business that they would like in paris and frankfurt would be another motivation."
ukpolitics,fdwnfsx,t1_fdwk2av,1578760482.0,"> You said before that for support industry names would pick AMD. So what is it now?

No I didn't. I said they would chose computers based on support contracts not hardware. Somehow you manged to missunderstand this.

>I just told you that everywhere I've worked in the game industry -- and I mean everywhere, from large enterprise names like Microsoft, to indies and even with freelancers -- have used exclusively Intel.

Which for most of that period means very little (since AMD's ability to make a CPU was limited) and after that we are just looking at industry inertia (don't change anything that works).

>This is contrary to what you said about industries only using AMD

Where the hell do you think I said that?"
ukpolitics,fdwjgvz,t1_fdwfk68,1578759340.0,">The game industry, which accommodates all of the roles mentioned, is not actually an industry? That's a hot take, mate.

The game industry is for the most part going to be concerned with support over hardware. They aren't going to be buying from the company advertising here.

> Nobody cares about marginal performance differences. That is your fixation alone.

Which leaves price. So again we are back to AMD while killing off intel's actualy valid use cases."

So you are waving around the ""industry"" term when not talking about industry.

>The sort of people who work these roles are very likely to have these machines at home, and furthermore, these roles are very popular for freelancing where people will also own these machines.

And for most of those tasks AMD (depending on your price point) provide outright better performance or better value for money for CPUs. The ad is missleading."

PCMR is gaming and for pure gaming Intel still has an edge (eh mostly there are exceptions)

> not a take from someone who has industry experience.

My industry experince is that companies tend to be more interested in support than hardware. The ""the creators, the editors"" they are nominaly aiming this at are going to be the one man band types."

Not he biggest concern (that's why it was listed last) but yet another issue.

>If you really want it, ECC is available on Xeon motherboards last I looked, but it's simply not worth the money.

Not going to be building gaming systems around xeon.

>If you just hate intel, well, PC Specialist does AMD as well.

Nothing to do with hating intel. Its a value for money thing. AMD provides the core count at a reasonable price. Intel does not. The advert went with intel.

>I am sure if you try hard enough, you will find some applications where this spec system isn't enough. But probably for most CAD work and video editing/transcoding etc, gamer rigs are hard to beat for value.

For anything other than pure gaming the Ryzen 5 3600 is the value option (other areas of the ryzen stack may come into play depending on your price point)."
