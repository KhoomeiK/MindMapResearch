changemyview,ffg0le6,t3_eteg8p,1579895868.0,"Everything we do can have a negative impact on the environment, yet that doesn't make them unethical. Having a baby in itself isn't the problem, the problem is how we sometimes consume certain things. Because one thing can lead to an unethical situation does not mean that thing is in itself unethical. Not only that, but we don't know the impact of having this child for the long term. Maybe this child will be a responsible person, or maybe even one that brings us closer to a solution to some of our sustainability issues.

From your perspective it would be more unethical to have an unwanted child out of bad luck. At least an IVF child is more likely to be really wanted and get a proper education."

This is why Schiff was absolutely right: we simply cannot afford keeping him in office longer, he still has plenty of damage to make to the republic."

I won’t argue that corruption isn’t a politician problem, it definitely is and I’m sure some democrats have dark secrets, but it’s also worth noting that many politicians are rich before getting into politics. The causation is often the other way around."

science,ff7ezw9,t1_ff7cuic,1579648021.0,The best way to get people to have less kids is for these countries to develop. Higher development = less children per household. This includes having a path to food supply. A bit like global warming where some scenarios show that it may be better to let developing countries burn through fossils for a decade so that they fast track their development and are then able to advance to greener ways of producing energy.

There is definitely an argument for making the most of your youth on the cheaper end rather than skipping another 7 years to enjoy a little bit more comfort. It's a personal choice, there is nothing absolutely objective about choosing one over the other.
