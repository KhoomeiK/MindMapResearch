Asking someone to learn to program is a tremendous commitment. So those strategies have even more risks than mine. If you're willing to go that route, best of luck to you. Over the years I've worked on many large scale corporate projects where domain knowledge and system wide understanding is not possible. Everybody was coding blind. Yet it can work with modern Test Driven Development. You need clearly defined Unit Acceptance Tests, Integration Tests and Regression Tests. That involve rigorous project management but I've seen it done."

They wouldn't have descriptive names and you wouldn't disclose that it's trading software. There might even be a way to do that in the cloud way the dev wouldn't have access to the source, but I don't know what that is. If your algo is straight forward and you're not using a lot of libraries, you can do it in C and give access to the compiled object modules thus protecting your source code."
