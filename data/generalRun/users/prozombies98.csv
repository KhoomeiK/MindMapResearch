So what you do is load into IX, knife your banner, finish 3 challenges and get the pap’d one, and go on with your game leveling up your strife. Then when you get your strife to max level, you can use the stilletto knife operator modwhich will let you knife until round 5."
blackops3,fdq1bs6,t1_fdpydir,1578649964.0,"You can get a starter pistol that can one hit knife until round 5
So you don’t struggle for points whatsoever
Plus you have perma jug, a perk which prevents downing, and can get a packapunched gun by round 3 for free
Edit: you can also have op equipment which recharges very quickly which you start with and it can be very effective until high rounds AND you can have a specialist weapon which can be broken depending on which one you pick. One of them is takers katana and can give you zombieblood if it leveled up all the way and you are using it"
