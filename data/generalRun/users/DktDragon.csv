If you want some massive damage output, grab [[Embercleave]] and dish out 48 points of damage. I’m evil and have [[Grafted Exoskeleton]] in the deck. Finally I have [[Batterskull]] to round out the equipment package."
todayilearned,fd461b8,t1_fd3ba22,1578164724.0,"I’d like to respectfully disagree with you. A persons ability to hear isn’t reflective of their parenting skills. The only thing a Deaf person can’t do is hear. They can certainly do anything they put their minds too. Having Deaf parents myself gave me the skills to communicate to so many people I would not have been able to otherwise. That’s what they taught me. They also taught me to have patience with those who I conversed with, as it’s better to understand one another rather than be right. 

We cannot choose the circumstance that we’re born into, but we can make the best of the circumstance we are in. I learned how to communicate effectively with just shy of anyone I could meet, even if we didn’t use the same language. My parents leveraged their sight and spacial awareness skills to raise me. The dude you’re trying to insult leveraged his maths skills to become a salesman. That’s awesome! Kudos to him! I wish him and his wife the happiest of futures."
todayilearned,fd1fj21,t1_fd1e7xo,1578130801.0,"Some, sure. People tend to find partners from similarities such as school, work, hobby groups etc. It’s the same for Deaf people. I think the other additional layer is communication. Finding a partner that understands them is pretty important in relationships, this goes for everyone! It’s just that for Deaf people, you can be pretty assured that the potential partner can communicate with them if they are Deaf themselves."

todayilearned,fczp1su,t1_fczf3r0,1578106049.0,"Yo! I was the interpreter to my parents divorce. That was when I was 17 but definitely not the place for me to do it. Also making bookings over the phone for your folks, or worse, when they ask to hear vocal confirmation from the person on the phone and you have to say “they’re Deaf.” Although frequently if I had people asking for my parents over the phone my reply would be they’re Deaf. The amount of times that people heard me say “they’re dead”..."

youtubers,fczh4vy,t3_ejmlje,1578101138.0,"You can use google images, but you’ll need to turn on “labeled for reuse.” You may need to credit where you get the image from but everything from there should be sweet. Alternatively if you get lucky, there are free stock photo sites like Pixabay you could use if you get lucky."
todayilearned,fczewfn,t1_fczdtng,1578099685.0,"Agreed. I find it interesting chatting to other CODA’s as I can always find a point of commonality. Since you had two Deaf parents, people tell you all the time that you were loud??? I had no idea I had a strong voice until I tried to whisper and everyone heard what I was whispering about. Never been able to tone down the sound of my voice hahaha"
todayilearned,fczdda0,t1_fczczet,1578098679.0,Yo! You’re like me! You’re a CODA/KODA! You and I have heaps of similar experiences.
youtubers,fcw35i2,t3_ej7sqp,1578016058.0,"I reckon use your voice. It will give you an opportunity to practice reading from paper and improve that skill. Even if you feel your voice isn’t great, you know your story better than anyone. You know when to emphasise, exaggerate etc. and remember you are your own worst critic. Someone may hear your voice and be enthralled by your narration, even if you think your voice ain’t great. Practice makes perfect, starting now is a great first step in being great later. If you need a space in your house to record voicing, may I recommend your closet if you can? The clothes will make sure sound does not bounce back and it’s away from everyone else."
movies,fcntvn4,t3_ei3u0m,1577818316.0,"I don’t think anyone posted these two so...

Dope: one of the funniest movies I’ve seen ever. Rawnchy comedy with some serious commentary. 

Short-Term 12: An absolute gut-punch the first time I saw it. Bring tissues."
youtubers,fcmmjq6,t3_ehym03,1577781669.0,"Heya! Watched your video and want to give you feedback. 

Your thumbnail: I saw a previous comment about your thumbnail and was very impressed with it. Did a quick look to see your other thumbnails and in my opinion it looks much better and cleaner. It’s the reason why I decided to click through and do the review. 

Narration: Good pace and like you said gets better the further you get. I think I’d have to agree. I think you have a strong and clear voice. I was trying to work out your accent though! Nothing bad, if anything I enjoyed the accent! 

Animation: I think a bit of attention could be spent on this. Some animations feel a bit PowerPoint-y. Personally I don’t like the spinning animation in particular, but that’s just me. 

Content: I thought that your timing of 5 facts and 5 mins~ pretty good. It didn’t feel rushed and the content was genuinely interesting. If you had sources for your info I’d love to know, just in the description. I think for anything history based it’s worth letting people know your sources, even if it is Wikipedia! We all have to start somewhere, right?

I enjoyed watching your video and I look forward to seeing what you come up with in the future. You earned a like on your video from me. Best of luck for your next video!"
