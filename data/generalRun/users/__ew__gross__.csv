AmItheAsshole,ffhyznx,t3_etfr3u,1579959818.0,If you can look at the tattoo and not immediately think of your ex than he has no significance whatsoever to the tattoo. It's your body and your tattoo. Getting a tattoo removed is painful and expensive (at least last I saw) there is no logical reason (other to make your bf's ego comfortable) to get it removed. If he's so sensitive about a tattoo I can't imagine how he will act when there is something actually worth getting upset over. This sounds like a huge red flag.

Heres some articles for you to read. First two are on how humans are contributing to this and why we are the main cause the other two are on how we know it's real."
HydroHomies,fffkujt,t1_fffk9yh,1579886143.0,Yes the climate changes naturally but it's very slow. We have scientific research that humans have increased the warming of the planet which is causing major issues. We are behind the rate at which the climate is changing. If you don't believe me google scholar is free and so is just about every scientific study on climate change.
HydroHomies,fffk6lg,t1_fffj6wp,1579885729.0,"We are the main reason for client change. Her study was on if it's natural (as in humans aren't involved, it's just what the earth is doing) or if it's being sped up due to humans and her results proved that we are the main cause of climate change."
