You realize that people from all over the world have moved to the US and that it's not a homogeneous culture of only white people,  right?

If you go to literally any major city in the US, you will find plenty of people who brought their traditions and cultures, some of which include facial tattoos.

So yeah. Here too."

My best bet is that the door leads back to Earth to  go back for more learning and more lessons.

Reincarnation makes sense."
popping,ffnhlzm,t1_ffn3qn9,1580066094.0,Except that there are cultures where facial tattoos are significant. The Maori are an example. And there are PLENTY of professional Maori with their own facial tattoos.

abv,ffbcrve,t3_esonaa,1579759918.0,"So I used an unmeasured tablespoon of abv and ground it up further by pressing it firmly with the back of my spoon against the side of the mug like an impromptu mortar and pestle. Then I added the mug mix, the 3 measured tablespoons of milk, and some Penzy's pie spice as I wanted to add more flavor.  Microwaved it for 1 minute, 30 seconds as anything less in my microwave leaves it under cooked. Added the included icing and ate it up.

If you want edibles that completely hide the flavor of abv, mug cakes and mug brownies are a pretty sweet way to go."

Fucking peace and quiet."

My parents pulled this shit. My mother let my ex stepfather treat me like shit and then shrugged me off to be petty.

He died a decade in to me going no contact. 

Four years ago, I went no contact with my mother.

She'll die before she ever hears from me again. 

May your daughter have her opportunity for escape and peace."

RATS,fe9rdlx,t3_eo83u7,1578940843.0,"I had several rats years ago,  but haven't had any in about 15 years. 

Yesterday, I went into the pet store to get crickets for our RES turtle and I decided I wanted to cuddle the ratties. My spouse left me at the store to go across the street and grocery shop, saying ""We're not coming home with a new pet...""

Nooooooooooooo

So the employee comes over and mentions that they have a blind rat. Then mentioned that they rarely sold the rats as pets.

I promptly asked to cuddle with the blind boy. She thought he'd be bit, but he was calm and started bruxing immediately with the head scritches.

I called my spouse and they reluctantly let me adopt this handsome fellow. 

Normally, I wouldn't keep a single rat, but it looks like he's lost at least one of his eyes to bullying and I am very much the sort who will have him with me almost the entire time I am home. He's content to snuggle without going too far from me.

Meet Dear, as in no eye Dear."
aww,fe5uode,t1_fe5schc,1578875348.0,"Normally, I would keep two. This guy, however, had blood around one of his eye sockets, so I think he lost both of his eyes to bullying. Because he's eyeless, I worry about him being further bullied by other rats.

I promise he will be out of his cage and with me being cuddled whenever I am home. I have plans to get a hoodie so he has his own rat pocket and he is currently sitting on my boobs grooming himself. 

I also kept his cage smaller and easier to navigate  while still providing enrichment materials to shred and play with. I made sure to get a platform that has a raised lip that will prevent accidental falls and a tube rather than a ladder to prevent slipping. He's a juvenile right now. If he ends up needing a bigger habitat,  he'll get it.

I've had ratties in the past, though it has been roughly 15 years since I lost my last pair. This boy will be so very spoiled and loved."
