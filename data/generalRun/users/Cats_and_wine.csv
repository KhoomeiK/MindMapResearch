AskReddit,fen0png,t3_eptxb3,1579274362.0,"my family is very distant and emotionally cold, but my grandma (dads mom) had a very sad life. she was a highly intelligent, proud woman, that always carried herself with her head high, but she was badly abused by her husband (who was an alcoholic and a gambler) until she herself became an alcoholic, and was one day rushed into a psychiatric hospital (i dont know the exact reasons), leaving my Dad and his sister alone at home, without anyone caring for them. My dad was around 6 years or so at the time, and had to care for my aunt (3) all by himself for weeks (granny always had some cash saved in her cupboard), until someone finally  came to help them. 

Grandma never forgave her husband or herself, and my great grandma never let her forget that, always calling her ugly names etc


my great grandma herself, was on a completely different level of ""evil person"", but because of all that, my grandma became kind of bitter and resentful, and i just knew her as that person.

Im sorry i stopped talking to her a few years before she died, if i knew what she went through, i maybe wouldve understood her better."
