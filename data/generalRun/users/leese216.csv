AskMen,fffv4z2,t1_ffflyc7,1579892468.0,"Same. I mean, I finished the season but i took it as stereotypical teenage relationships. 

I think they could have handled it better but it wasn’t enough for me to stop watching. I think both Mike and Hop were being way too monopolizing of 11’s actions. Both were controlling her. Just in different ways. Also, someone mentioned Hop being “obsessed” with 11. That’s very far fetched. He took care of her and kept her safe. Idk about any of you but my parents would NEVER have let me stay in a bedroom with a boy at 14. Even with the door open, let alone a crack. 

Also, Hop is a damaged in his own right. He didn’t know how to talk to 11 about sex. He’s going to fuck that up a bit. That’s the point of these characters. They’re flawed. They wouldn’t be interesting if they were perfect. 

What annoyed me was the big way they used Billy. Like, why do we care about him ?  He isn’t a major character. I don’t have any investment in his prior abuse. I’m glad they didn’t pick on Will again but that’s what I didn’t like about s3.  Other than that, I enjoyed it more than s2. And yes, s1 was still the best. But then again, they always are."

However, 300 years after Jesus's death, this council sat around and decided on that.  They also decided when Christmas and Easter would take place, and what gospels would make it into the Bible (and this tied into the decision that Jesus was a divine being, because there are many gospels that speak of Jesus as just a man, and of course those gospels were NOT chosen)."

With meditation, you train your brain to clear our your thoughts and focus on your breath.  Of course, this takes A LOT of practice to achieve, so when thoughts do come, you just let them.  You don't engage.  When you find yourself engaging with those thoughts, you just gently bring your focus back to your breath.  

I like sitting cross legged.  

As Buddha said when asked, ""What have you gained from meditation?"" he said, ""Nothing, however, let me tell you what I lost: anger, anxiety, depression, insecurity, fear of old age, and death"".

Meditation is about being self-aware of your thoughts so you stop being emotionally reactive."

AskWomenOver30,fff9fz5,t3_et70ce,1579878984.0,"I was at a job for 2 years.  During those years, I tried to become an asset to the company.  Volunteered to take on more responsibilities, came up with ideas (that they gave to someone else) all that jazz.  

Then they wouldn't let me go on vacation with my family because it was during a trade show, which I had offered multiple replacements for me not being there.  They still said no, so that was the cherry on top.

I quit, but gave them a month notice so I could train my replacement.  

I was unemployed for 2 months, got a seasonal position, then unemployed for 2 months again, which led me to apply to a job cross country, which I was offered and accepted.  That was almost 2 years ago.  My life has changed in every way and I have never looked back.

Now, I never felt like I was running away from that job.  It was more that, I contributed all I could and had no growth left.  I wasn't happy, although I didn't hate that job.  

Still, my advice is, if you need to quit to keep your mental health in a good place, to make yourself happy, then do it.  You're not running away from that job, but running towards where you're supposed to be."

It completely changed my life.  In a great way.  Although bad things did happen, and I've had one of the toughest years of my life, I wouldn't change a thing.  I've learned SO MUCH about myself, what I'm capable of.  How strong I am.  

I also met the love of my life, and everything had to happen the way it did for us to be together.

I moved because I felt like I was in a rut.  Call it a quarter life crisis, but I quit my job, couldn't find anything remotely interesting, and was so tired of feeling the way I was feeling.  Like, this is it?  This is all there is to life?  So I decided to start applying to jobs where I live now, and I got one in literally a week and a half.  Officially moved 3 weeks later.

I met him at that job, but we didn't start talking until 6 months in, and at that point we were just friends because he had a gf.

That being said, I do not enjoy casual sex at all.  I also lost my virginity at 20, but I haven't had any truly serious, in love, LTR until now.  

I've gone years, many times over, without having sex.  Because I NEED an emotional connection.  Otherwise, I can close my eyes and for all I care it can be a dildo inside me.  If I don't have feelings for the guy, I don't want him touching or kissing me, especially if he's a bad kisser.  

Then I met my man in 2018, and my views on sex were reiterated because I feel for him the way I never have for anyone else, and the sex IS mind blowing.  But BECAUSE of the connection we share.  It's intense and amazing and real.  We are completely ourselves with each other, which led to an intense intimacy I always hoped for, but for a long time never thought I'd find.

Denver,ff45thw,t1_ff3q64p,1579556184.0,"I would agree with this.  

I grew up in NY and moved here almost 2 years ago.  In Manhattan, you literally cannot miss the swarm of people, especially during rush hour.  However, NY has grown around foot traffic.  So although you have the people who cross at crosswalks, you also have people who will walk anywhere, cross any street at any time they like.  But NYC drivers are used to this, so they learn to expect it.  If anything, the cyclists are the ones getting into accidents, because they do whatever the fuck they want, regardless of street lights and traffic etiquette.

Also, the speed limit in the city is 25 MPH, flat.  Everywhere.  Unless you're crossing the park or something, you're not going very fast.  

But I will say, my mom made a comment when she came to visit me, ""Where are all the people?"".  I'm sure it's because we've been conditioned to associate any large metropolis with a ton of pedestrians, but we just don't think what is considered a ""large amount"" is actually any amount at all."

Neville Goddard talks about ""living in the end"".  If you've heard of this technique, then forgive my brief summary, but basically Neville says to imagine a scene where you have the thing you want.  In this case, it would be the loving relationship with your SP.

You build that scene, let's say you're celebrating your one year anniversary, and you really FEEL what you would if you were in that image that moment.  The happiness, joy, fulfillment.  Once you truly feel those feelings, you accept them as real and let it go, knowing that will happen.  That scene is a reality, and soon it will manifest.

Also, Neville says your current 3D world doesn't matter, circumstances don't matter.  You have to ignore what's in front of you.  So stop following her on social media.  Block her if it helps your will power.  Don't ask you friends about her, or talk about her to anyone.

Just live in the end and let it come to you.

Edited to add: You DO NOT want to focus on the HOW or WHEN.  The ""end"" will bring about a ""bridge of incidents"" that leads you to that image in your head.  So, for instance, don't try to manifest a text.  You may get it, but it won't lead to the relationship you want.  But, if you live in and from the end, then whatever happens begins the bridge of incidents that leads you to the end.  A text could be included in that."
AskMen,ff417g8,t1_ff3wfop,1579553317.0,"I gave historical figures as a reference because they're easy to look up, and unfortunately most historical figures from several hundred years ago are wealthy.

I also have no idea why you're insinuating wealth has anything to do with the love of a pet?  Have you never seen homeless people on the street?  Half of them have pets, and those pets are loyal, and loved.  9/10 times those pets have food, but the human does not, so whatever your reasoning is for calling out wealthy people, from what I can tell, it's based on a snobby opinion and complete lack of evidence."
AskWomenOver30,ff40sm2,t1_ff3vrmp,1579553059.0,"I've had similar experiences as you, and always felt I was shit at interviewing, even though I knew what I could bring to the table, and the kind of value I would contribute to any company I worked for.

I always worried, was I being professional enough?  Am I speaking in the best form?  Am I sitting up straight enough?

And you know what I realized?  I was a robot.  I had NO personality whatsoever, because I was so concerned about being professional.  My sister and cousin interview A LOT of people for their jobs, and they always told me, while of course having the appropriate skills is important, it's about who you are as a person.

Most people are hired based on how well they jive with the interviewer.  You can always train/coach/teach new employees a specific skill, but if they don't have the right fit with the company and rest of employees, if the interviewer doesn't think you'll blend well with the company, then chances are you won't get hired.

The minute I got more relaxed, and stopped worrying so damn much about how I'm perceived, and just focused on my experience, work ethic, and what I can do for the company, I have gotten 75% of the jobs I've interviewed for in the past few years."

CasualConversation,ff3swo9,t1_ff3r5n4,1579548145.0,"I've been ALONE alone A LOT in my life, and while i thoroughly enjoy that, being with my man is so much more fulfilling.  We kind of have opposite work schedules so I'm home in the evenings and he's not.  So we have our time to ourselves, since he's home during the day and i'm not.

If for whatever reason I need some ""me"" time, I go for a hike or run some errands.  We are very communicative about that, and if he needs some time he takes, it too.  

As for your example of listening to music, while that's very kind of you to think of others, you don't HAVE to.  That's your choice to do that.  You can do a mix of genres, like ones you enjoy, then a few others enjoy, to keep it fair.  

""So having someone LIVE with me, with no personal room sounds exhausting"".  Those are definitely introvert qualities.  Social situations exhaust you and you need time to recharge when you're by yourself.  I recently learned that while I'm very social and extroverted, I also have a bit of introvert in me, too.  

I think it's about finding the right balance for YOU.  If you need that time by yourself, take it.  If you don't want to live with someone, then don't.  Or, if you do live with someone and you don't want them in your bed, communicate that and work together to find an arrangement where both of you are satisfied.  Every relationship is different, there is no right or wrong."

Either he gives you a sign he really likes it, or he doesn't, and it's just something that happens when you're getting down and dirty.

As for sharing your living space, that all depends on how serious you are and how serious you want to be.  I'm the type of person who loves to be around their SO a lot because I'm butt crazy about him, so I WANT to share a bed, couch, chair, whatever with him.  We have our time for ourselves but in general, def want to be around him and want him to be around me.  

Again, that depends on how serious relationships you've had have been.  Maybe you haven't been there yet.  Or maybe you want to give it several months to a year to open yourself and your space up to that.  Everything is different for everyone."

AskWomenOver30,ff3oe0i,t1_ff28hqd,1579545382.0,"I feel like I was in your position for a long period of my adult life.  

For me, it was because I didn't recognize my worth.  ""We accept the love we think we deserve"" (Perks of Being a Wallflower) and I clearly didn't think I deserved a loving, fulfilling, emotionally intimate relationship.  I thought the only thing I was good for, was sex.

Until I made a lot of changes in my life, like moving cross country, working and kicking the shit out of a difficult job that gave me so much confidence, and meeting my man, who made me see how amazing i actually am.  

Now, I don't want to assume anything about how you view yourself, but I would definitely reflect inwards and really be honest.  You want someone who will bring as much as you to the table, and any guy who isn't willing isn't the right guy for you.  And that's totally fine.  It's just a faster ""no"" and will get you to the right guy more quickly :)"
