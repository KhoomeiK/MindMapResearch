I don't have a lot of advice, outside of what others have suggested with covering your pets so the cats can't get to them. I don't think that a cat would actually try to kill a tortoise, depending on the size of the tort, but I understand the concern. Perhaps set out live-traps with a can of tuna or something and take any cats you catch to the shelter. You just have to be prepared to deal with any incidental catches, like raccoons, oppossums, etc. And have a plan for what to do if the cat you catch is actually feral, in which case the shelter isn't really an option."

The difference between dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate is very important here. Most dogs can eat any white chocolate with no problem, as it has little to no theobromine. Milk chocolate has more, but not that much and most dogs can eat quite a bit of milk chocolate without experiencing side effects (One website I looked at said a 50lb dog would have to eat more than a pound of milk chocolate to actually become sick). The chances of a dog being able to eat enough milk chocolate to make itself really sick are low (they're more likely to make themselves sick by eating too much before the theobromine toxicity sets in).

&#x200B;

Dark chocolate or baker's chocolate, however, can be fatal very quickly. [According to this websit](https://www.petmd.com/dog/chocolate-toxicity)e, my large dog (75lbs) could handle maybe a couple tablespoons of cocoa powder or dark chocolate, but more than that can make them sick very quickly."

snakes,ffaeuvx,t3_esiv6i,1579734047.0,"Honestly, it's hard to argue for any snake over a corn snake as the best starter snake.

Pretty much every other species has a ""it can be a good beginning snake, except"" attached to it. And that's true, people can start with a Ball Python, or a Hognose, but none of them are quite as good as a corn as a starter snake.  Kingsnakes aren't \*much\* different, but there are some temperament issues with kings, they often don't handle as easily. A king is much more likely to bite than corn. I'd say the one downside of a corn, as opposed to a ball python or some other species, is that they're active. You're not just going to plop a corn down on your lap and read a book without paying attention to it. 

I've owned ball pythons in the past and currently own a corn snake and a colombian rainbow boa. I'm not the type to collect, I just want one or two snakes that are easy to take care of and take to handling well and I'll likely only ever own corn snakes again."

My friend and I are still playing 2 player **Wingspan** regularly. For a while, we tried balancing the game a bit by removing the power birds (the two ravens, killdeer, and Franklin's gull) and reducing the eggs you get from the plains row by 1, but that made the game a little too slow, so we went back to normal. We actually added a 5th round, with no goal, only 4 actions just to let our engines run a bit longer and we're enjoying that. We've modded this game so much, it's crazy."

It might just be a matter of finding a dry food he likes! My dog was fussy when we first got her, she'd be fine with a dry food for about  half a bag, then get bored and turn her nose up at it.

Three of the set were practically unusable, they were so poorly made (including the d20... when I placed it so a certain side was facing up, I couldn't balance another die on top of it, it'd just slide right off). So yeah, I'm sticking to simple resin dice."

dogs,ff32jpj,t3_erco5m,1579532006.0,"I mean... this is going to sound a little harsh, but my advice would be to listen to your vet. When the medicine your vet prescribed didn't work, did you contact the vet and tell them or just switch to the Throat Gold on your own? I looked up throat gold and it's not medicine, it's just a throat soothing formula. It's like taking cough drops, it's not going to cure an underlying problem, just make the symptoms less harsh. So if the cough is continuing for this long despite it, there's likely some other problem going on. A month is a long time for a dog to have a cough like that.

So if your vet wants to do additional tests to find out what the problem is... my advice is to do that."

Tombofannihilation,fevjxoq,t3_eqovdb,1579398252.0,"No, it's not common knowledge that the Soulmonger is in Omu. In fact, Omu existing is not really common knowledge.  There's no one-way that players should gain the information, but there are a couple spelled out in the book: Saja Nbaza in Orolunga is an oracle that can tell them the Soulmonger is in Omu and where it is. Valindra Shadowmantle in the Heart of Ubtao is fairly certain the Soulmonger is in Omu and knows where Omu is. The aarakocra of Kir Sabal know where Omu is, though they don't know about the Soulmonger (the sidebar says that they ""watch over the city""). Salida, the Yuan-ti guide knows where Omu is. I'm sure there are some that I'm missing.

&#x200B;

Personally, I had my players learn through bits here and there. They asked Father Zitembe in Port Nyanzaru to divine where the Soulmonger was and got the clue that it was in a city of snakes in the South of Chult. They talked to Zalkore in Nangalore, who told them Omu was a great city in the south (alternating knowing it's in ruin and thinking it was still the royal city). Then Asharra confirmed the location of Omu, but also told them of other cities in the South (Hisari, Shilku, Hrakhamar). They met Valindra, who told them she sent people to Omu, Hisari, and M'Bala (I decided it made more sense if she wasn't certain the Soulmonger was in Omu, as to why she wasn't there herself). Then they went to Orolunga and got it confirmed. They ended up traveling across a large portion of the jungle.

&#x200B;

Basically, you can do it however you see fit. I've heard of people who learned very early on that the Soulmonger was in Omu and had to ""grind levels"" because they knew they weren't strong enough. I think it's better to make them search for that information."
