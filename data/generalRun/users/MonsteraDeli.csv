Good teeth, strong jaws, massive muscles to use them are worth it to make the most of scarce food. If you don't see many animals with wonky teeth, it's because they didn't survive the competition.

Domesticated animals don't have to be super efficient when it come to that, they get their food delivered to them. Humans learned to cook food, grind grain before eating it, or cut up fibrous plants with tools instead of teeth. It's ok to not have perfectly suitable teeth, you won't starve before having kids anymore. 

More goes into the typical changes when domesticating a species, like humans breeding the more docile, less dangerous individuals. Horns get smaller, canines less prominent f.ex. And not wasting extra effort on large teeth and jaws is efficient, too, when food is so easily available. A small edge over other individuals can be enough to start some interesting evolutionary developments."

The way egg shells are layered makes them even sturdier. Glass is fragile, sandwich it with plastic foil and it will crack with a strong enough impact, but not shatter.

Sometimes birds produce imperfect eggs. They can get stuck along the way for a bit before moving on, leading to odd shapes, or sometimes no shell at all. The shell-less eggs can tear, scramble egg in the nest, but the shell wasn't hard yet, so at least no cuts. If an egg gets stuck completely it's a life-threatening emergency. Usually you'd try to lubricate it and gently massage it out in one piece. Breaking the egg is a last resort and dangerous, because yes, the shells can cut the bird up.

With the amounts you need acid dyes can easily be cheaper too. 

They're no evil, toxic chemicals either. Gloves are a good idea because they will happily dye skin and finger nails too. Like any powder, don't inhale it all the time. Exhaust the dye baths if possible and wash (the stainless) pots thoroughly after use.

For plant fibers the fiber reactive dyes are nice. But I don't usually play with those. 

Jacquard and Dharma dyes are nice, for a bunch of colors they use the same substances. Ashford has become very expensive here, when their quality hasn't been all that great, not worth it anymore. Eurolana are supposedly good too, but I don't have any experience with them. Stay away from surprisingly cheap dyes, they're either lackluster in color or are very diluted with inactive fillers."

I probably think utterly ridiculous things to be true about the universe because I'm simply not up to date with modern physics. My world view is simplistic, I know it, I still don't want to invest time and energy to get a better understanding. Willfully ignorant.

No one knows everything, we all select what to learn more about. And what we don't know we make assumptions about. Yes, evolution and the basics of the universe are easy pieces of information to come by and the surfaces of each aren't hard to understand. Choosing scripture and myths over science is rather weird to me, but how old the earth is doesn't really matter all that much. If people want to believe it's flat and clouds are mayo, wtf, have fun. Spouting that praying cures cancer, or vaccines are evil, or human actions can't possibly influence the climate, or whatever made up reason why only one group of people to be worthy of respect,... these ideas all have  a potential to harm others. (People are still free to believe them, but I get seriously pissy if they try to infect others with the bullshit, or keep them away from information to come up with their own conclusions)

Sure, most of such ideas come in combination. Someone who refuses to accept scientific methods and results in one area probably rejects others too. Young Earthers who are otherwise unencumbered by odd ideas are rare."

ehlersdanlos,fcmr7s0,t3_ehv4nv,1577788232.0,"Deciding who is allowed to reproduce and who not is utterly unacceptable. Period. Competent people should always have the right to decide for themselves to have children or not (and no! no moving the goal posts of what ""competent"" means to match some ideology).

But I also think they should be allowed to terminate a pregnancy for any reason (in my personal opinion, it should be as early as possible, but late-term abortions are rare and usually for some devastating medical issue anyways. People don't wait longer just for ""fun"").

Not all genetic disorders that can be tested for allow for much of a life. Trisomy 13 or 18 come with such profound health issues that most children already die before the end of the pregnancy, and somewhere around 90% before they're 1 year old. *Forcing* parents to watch their child suffer and likely die very soon is as unacceptable as telling someone they're not allowed to have one.

Extreme example classic dominant Huntington's: 50/50 chance to hand it on. Is it really morally unacceptable to want to spare a child that condition when prenatal diagnostics make it possible to do so? If the parents don't want tests, ok (Better not touch the question whether this is fair to the child, because that opens a whole new can of worms whether unborn children have rights that supersede their parents', and very, very bad things linger in that direction)

If someone wants tests, with hopefully some (or obligatory?) counseling beforehand, they have the choice what to do with that information. Taking into account not only the child's prospective quality of life, but also the parent's. Raising a severely disabled child is hard. Children in general are emotionally taxing at times, a financial burden, and need lots of time. If people believe they can not handle that, for the sake of the child and the parents, allow them to decide to terminate the pregnancy. People with a disability that makes them depend on others are already victims of abuse often enough. Don't force people to have children they don't want. Some might find out they are up to the challenge after all, but I wouldn't bet on it when the quality and length of life of another human depends on it."
