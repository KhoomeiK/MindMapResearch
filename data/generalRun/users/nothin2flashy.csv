Or should I just make a toon on standard and level / progress at my slow pace? Any suggestions for a new player would be welcomed, and thank you.

Also, I’m on Xbox. Would try pc but my graphics card acts up and sometimes turns everything into pixels and broken colors. I think it’s dying out."

u_dirty_rose,fedlbgz,t3_eoazu5,1579014353.0,"KC - 35

TEN - 34

the titans will be up 34 to 28 with 1:30 left in the 4th quarter, having just come off a drive that led to a 41 yard field goal, putting them up by 6 on the chiefs. They will kickoff and the chiefs will take the ball on the 25 yard line after a touchback. Pat Mahomes will then drive down the field with 2 time outs remaining to spare and he will end up closing the game out with a final TD pass to Watkins from roughly 38 yards out. PAT is good, game ends. KC fans go ballistic, as well as the team, Andy Reid gets a Gatorade bath and I walk away with 1 plat award. :) 


For real though... if this is how it plays out, I’ll freak myself out and prob play lotto. Good luck all <3"

It’s like that at my job, the doors are locked but you can walk out, but if the door closes you are now locked out, unless you have the key to reopen the door."

My sister got the furby and so I cried in front of them. I felt so bad for crying in front of my dad at the time cus I felt like I let him down. Little did I know, I would end up having way more fun with the BB gun, and learned a lot about guns and gun safety.  I dropped contact with my parents years later though after several years of them picking hardcore drugs over there two kids. Not cus anything like this."
