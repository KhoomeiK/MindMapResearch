WTF,ff856m1,t1_ff84xg8,1579666295.0,It's not so much the difficulty as the expense. Hanging wires on poles is a fraction of the cost of burying them. It's worth mentioning though that buried lines require far less maintenance and are typically less expensive in the long run.
funny,ff84tgq,t1_ff7y0g1,1579666010.0,"I hear you and before I had my son I felt the same but there is this weird thing where, when it's your own child it doesn't bother you. I spent 40 years avoiding becoming a parent and now in couldn't imagine myself never getting the chance to be a father. I assume it's biological but I'm no scientist. It's truly odd though, the sound of a child whining or crying used to go through me like nails on a chalkboard and now it just makes me want to comfort them. Paternal instincts are as real and strong as maternal ones and they're strangely fulfilling.I really can't explain properly to someone who hasn't experienced it but I still find myself trying.

Although, I do still have a thing for combat boots. In short, I'm a fit but boring middle aged dude in a perpetually boring monochromatic outfit. 

I have the most expensive, non toxic,  hypoallergenic, organic children's hair mousse and hair wax to give my 2yo son a mohawk or old school punk short liberty spikes. I either dress him like a little rocker in all the colors or I dress him up all NY fashionable punk. He loves it more than I do (which is a bold statement) and helps me pick all of his outfits. He also grabbed the TV remote to change Sesame street to my System of a down channel today on YouTube and bounced around to it all on his own. 

When people see just me and him, they either think mommy dressed him or anything other than I might have had a hand in it or encouraged it. It's hilarious. Mommy has very little to do with it and would prefer to dress him like a little preppy boy with nice normal hair but she enjoys how much we love it, so she tolerates us.

I liked Kirk and the original ST far more as a kid than as an adult. It's probably because as societal norms evolved and changed, so did I. Now Kirk is my least favorite captain and while I still like and appreciate the original ST, it's my least favorite of the ST serieses (seriesii? seriesapodes?). Watching DS9 after 9-11 really brought that series to life for me, especially once you realize the B'jorans were basically modeled on what we now consider middle eastern terrorists, the Cardassians are basically the current US military and the Federation is the UN, just slightly less toothless. I too really liked Capt. Janeway but I think part of that is because she was a strong female lead in a time when there wasn't many of those. I even like the Enterprise series but I have to admit I really didn't like it at all when it came out. If the Syfy channel didn't have marathons of it when I was sick and there was little to no other decent SciFi shows out, I would probably never have discovered how much I enjoyed the later over arching plot. All the ST series had flaws and strengths. All of them are enjoyable and watchable.

I prefer thicker crust with a pronounced edge for pizzas that are their own meal. I'm not a fan of super bready pizza but that's personal taste and you can make exactly what you like with your own stone. 

If you garden and/or make your own sauces, that's when you'll really benefit. Even if you just grow your own herbs and spices on your windowsill you'll benefit.  The quality and range of flavor in fresh grown or fresh made ingredients is far superior to anything premade or store bought.

killingfloor,ff3nrcc,t1_ff3hp6r,1579544993.0,"Ok, my reply was harsh and I apologize. I should have said that better. I was a dick. I'm sorry. I wouldn't kick anyone for their gun choice, that's a stupid reason for a kick. Sell another player's weapon or harass someone though and I'll ban you in a millisecond and I think we can agree those are valid reasons. 

My main issue with a zerker using the nailgun is it goes entirely against their main job for the team. Sure a zerker can take down anything but their job is to tank and keep the big guys on them while the team does most of the killing (this goes double on HOE). Even if you disregard that for a second, or you're playing solo, giving up movement speed, block and parry to kill one zed a bit quicker is a huge weakness. 

My secondary issue with the nailgun is that you're giving up all the additional effects like stumble, stun and EMP. Upgraded Static Strikers or Bone Crusher with smash can take out a FP or Scrake in 3 fast headshots, while stumbling or stunning them so they do no damage to you or your team. A fully upgraded hemoclobber can heal you and put out an AOE that panics or kills everything. The Ion thruster can can cause fire panic and has that super attack that knocks everything down. Etc etc etc. Ignoring these effects is severely limiting your abilities as a zerker. This goes double at the higher rounds on endless when you have multiple FP to deal with at the same time. Fast takedowns are only really ""optimal"" when soloing  or in survival game mode or under controlled conditions."
Connecticut,ff3l2e9,t1_ff3fvxb,1579543326.0,"I'm down in the Norwalk/ Stamford area.  My wife and I have gone up to New Haven just to see what the hype was about and at the recommendation of friends.  It's just not our thing. As I mentioned  I think it's just because it's so different than the pizza we grew up with. We both dislike pizza from pretty much every other state as well. I've often joked that PA pizza is basically bread with ragu and random melted cheeses and Chicago pizza is a bread bowl with cheese and tomato soup in it.

With that said, a good pizza stone will change your life. Making pizza exactly how you like, with many ingredients grown in your own garden and a sauce made by yourself pretty much ruins any pizzeria or restaurant bought pizza. The only caveat is that you need a stove than can hit 500f and many do not."

I legitimately wish I could enjoy CT pizza but  everything conflicts with everything I like about pizza; the sauce is too sweet, the cheese is too oily, the crust is way too thick and overcooked. 

Again, for clarity, in not bashing CT pizza, it's just nothing like the pizza I grew up on in Westchester and the boroughs, so I can't enjoy it. I'm glad others can and hope they continue to do so."

killingfloor,ff37jke,t1_ff2wp4e,1579535557.0,"I'm just going to pick the two that annoyed me the most. His GS and zerker loadouts are comically bad. The GS needs their top tier weapons for big zeds, they are not supposed to be trash killers. Literally every weapon the zerker has is better than the nailgun.

I could pick apart almost every other one and even the ones I agree with are debatable. For example, the medic loadout. While that is my exact preferred loadout, There are medics who are better healers with two guns with healing darts instead of the 501. Also, the Hemogoblin has a slow+weakening effect that, in the hands of a medic who is skilled with it, can prevent more damage than they could possibly heal by other means. 

It's worth noting that I only play on HOE and have most perks (Zerker,  medic and GS included)  at lvl 25 perk 5. So my disagreement isn't difficulty or experience related. 

By all means read and watch guides like this to help you improve as a player but pick the guns and skills that suit your play style. Have fun, it's only a game."

I'm going to seriously simplify this,  keep in mind engineers spend a serious amount of their education time on structural loads of various materials. I'm pretty sure sheetrock has it's own dedicated course(s) if you become a construction engineer or structural engineer. 

For our purposes there are two main ways for sheetrock to carry a load:  Tension weight,  which is pulling away from the wall (articulating TV mounts can cause this kind of tension when b pulled away from the wall) and shearing weight which is when the weight is flat against the wall and gravity is pulling it down (like a TV on a flat mount). 

Sheetrock doesn't handle tension loads very well and, while it can handle shearing weight much better, BUT too thin of an anchor+too much weight=cutting the sheetrock. This is one of the reasons you never just put a screw right into sheetrock (there are many more). Yes there are screws with large threads made for screwing right into sheetrock, but they have extremely low weight limits by comparison (even the plastic and metal anchors, with giant threads,  that screw into sheetrock can only hold about 60lbs if my memory serves) 

The toggle anchor in this post has a plastic sheath, which has two benefits; it holds the toggle in place and prevents the screw from cutting the sheetrock by spreading the force over a larger area. This allows these anchors to hold significantly more weight than a standard molly anchor. Just to clarify,  The toggle (metal brace behind the wall) itself distributes the load instead of focusing it like the screw or molly based anchors, and the plastic bit distributes the shearing load so screw doesn't cut downward. 

Now that's not the only reasons the sheetrock can fail. It may have been patched and fixed before. It may have been damaged during transport or installation. Etc. This is why you always want to hit at least one stud.

And yes, that was the overly simplified version. I could go on much longer and more in depth and I'm not even an engineer."

specializedtools,feyja1c,t1_feygnd3,1579446215.0,Depending on size but the 3/16ths ones can hold over 250lbs and the 1/4 ones can hold over 300lbs of shearing weight. I have absolutely mounted modern TVs on tilting wall mounts with them without a single worry.  I would strongly discourage mounting articulating mounts with them though.
killingfloor,feygnxo,t1_fextord,1579445278.0,"The maps are downloaded directly from the server like in KF1. I don't know why they occasionally still have issues and even those issues are often odd. 

For example,  Sometimes it still load the custom map and everything is fine until the match starts, the player moves and then crash. But then if they rejoin the exact same match, the client won't need to download the map again and everything will be fine. This bug also won't effect everyone, so it's hard to troubleshoot. 

I wasn't arguing and I agree it's a hassle. I'm just trying to provide a solution that 100% cleared up the the crashing with my group and our servers."

patientgamers,fepiz8o,t1_feo9qcx,1579321718.0,"First off, I loved both Vermintide 1 and 2 and had over 1000 hours in each of them but it wasn't the grind that killed either. I'll focus on V2 because that's what you brought up. 

The population in V2 died off because of the bugs not being fixed while they added paid DLC. I stopped playing before the last DLC with the beast men but supposedly that changed everything about the combat, breaking how several classes were played. Basically every veteran of the game quit after that last DLC came out. 

I absolutely experienced several game breaking bugs like exploding barrels, needed to finish the end game of one if the boards, not spawning and several other really frustrating issues.  It was the reason I took a break and expected to go back after the next patch when it was fixed, but it never was, so I eventually lost interest and stopped keeping track. 

Either way, I got over 1000 hours out if either game, so I really have no right to complain. I absolutely got my money out of both. It's just sad because I'd be playing V2 still if they did address the bugs instead of pulling a cash grab.

Edit:  you made me nostalgic and curious so I did a bit of searching and it looks like Fatshark finally got their act together in November 2019 (after people complaining hard about bugs since 2015) and did a giant rebalance and big fix. I guess I'll go give it a try again tomorrow.
