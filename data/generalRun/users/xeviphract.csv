You may want to call ahead and ask if they have a trained officer who can be part of your interview, given the sensitivity of the crime you are reporting, but before you go, make sure you have people you can turn to after, as even the best case scenario means repeating what you went through and you might need the extra emotional support.

I have a friend who believed for much of her childhood that her father had abandoned her. She only later found out her mother forced him to leave and obstructed all forms of contact. It was only by chance she learned the truth, that she'd always been his favourite child and he'd desperately tried to see her.

For myself, I'd always heard from my adoptive parents that my biological family were terrible people who had starved and beaten me. When I finally met them, yes, they said they had done those things, but they were *really sorry*. Well, they weren't sorry enough to confess to the police and they weren't sorry enough to admit they'd even been bad parents. Were they as awful as I'd heard? Yes, but more importantly, they weren't prepared to accept responsibility, so how could we have had any kind of meaningful relationship?  


In both cases, there was closure from meeting that absent parent. In one case, the parent had indeed been maligned, but by then too many years had gone by to heal the hurt of that absence. In the other, the parent had been exactly as described, but there was confirmation of that early on, so the churn of wondering, wondering, wondering was no longer there.

I would say, you have every right to judge your father for yourself. 

It may be that you end up liking him, despite what he has done, or it may be that you don't feel any connection, even if you discover the truth is in his favour. Families can be complicated in that way. If you only have hearsay to go on, then you will never really know for yourself how you feel about that person. Take all necessary precautions, as you would when meeting any online stranger, and decide the limits of the meeting and what you want from it.

There are certainly plenty of people who do not know the first thing to say. Others may well not wish to accept that such painful things can happen.

UnresolvedMysteries,fdqp4jn,t1_fdppw57,1578671843.0,"There are several reasons for suggesting a Jewish killer, but there is no firm evidence either way.

The Ripper killings took place in areas associated with masses of new immigrants escaping the pogroms in Eastern Europe. As with many poor Londoners, they often went undocumented, or would be known by different names to different people. They would carry out the work no one else wanted to do. 

It was felt that someone from outside this community would have been noticed escaping the crime scenes, whereas a local was expected to be there and may not have needed to 'escape' at all. If they were covered in blood, then they would have looked no different to the slaughtermen or butchers going about their lawful business.

The police also had a list of the usual suspects. On that list were several Jewish men known to be either violent or mentally disturbed. Detectives followed up leads, but the closest anyone seems to have come was an eyewitness (believed to be Joseph Lawende) supposedly refusing to make a formal identification of the murderer, because he did not want to condemn a fellow Jew to death. 

There is also the matter of the graffito referencing Jews, which was found by a policeman, written next to a piece of bloody evidence that had been taken from the most recent victim. The message may have been completely unconnected, but the police ordered it be removed, in the belief it would spark a race riot.

It should be noted that the local populace had such little faith in the police to protect them, that they organised their own Vigilance Committees, which were themselves involved in the Ripper drama. There were also mobs chasing people down streets and all kinds of high feeling on the matter, so maybe the police were right to remove the graffito from view, but it was so small, they could have just stuck a piece of paper over it, instead of washing it away. As it stands, we have conflicting records of what was actually written there, as it was gone before the police photographer arrived to document the scene.

You must be careful with which Ripper Tour you choose. There are loads of them touting for business and not all guides provide excellent service.

Easy concepts for non-gamers.

If you are only looking for Oculus Store games, then I'd recommend *Space Pirate Trainer* for a similar experience to the Lab's mini-games (remembering to explain use of the shoulder weapons and turrets), especially since it works well with any sensor set-up, and *Trickster*, because it's a fun, casual, hack 'n' slash game, with upgradeable weaponry and unlockable stages. 

There are many titles which would be cool experiences, but they all have their own quirks and some subjects may be more appealing to your potential players than others.

As with other podcasts that use black comedy, the presenters have said they make light of what they can, in order to cope with the worst humanity has to offer. 

It helps to remember that many confessed killers take a kind of pride in being notorious, especially if the press gives them an intimidating moniker, so part of undermining that pride is to poke fun at them. A similar trend is to remove the criminal's name from retellings of the cases, so that the life of the victim is the focus and not the perpetrator's crime."

It's not the audio files themselves I object to, as they are only articles of evidence. I dislike that they are presented in this manner, as show-pieces in a podcast asking for money, without justification given in the rest of the episode, beyond ""You can HEAR the evil!""

Other true crime podcasts can be poorly written, harrowing to listen to, or perhaps just uninsightful, but S&S is the only one that's struck me as unethical."

Listen to the episode, if you want. My objection to the series is that it is overly emotive when attempting to be objective and uses whole chunks of primary, unedited audio (you hear people being murdered, for instance), but the playback isn't commented upon, so there didn't seem to be any reason to play it in its entirety, other than to be sensationalist, or perhaps pad out the running time.

I find old people seem to believe you can still walk down the road and get hired at the local factory, when in reality, they're not hiring and you must apply online via an automated agency system. The benefit to that is that you can yourself auto-apply to various places.

You are perhaps being too harsh to criticise these reactions you've been reading. People experience the world in different ways and hold certain beliefs. What is easy for one person is hard for another. It shouldn't matter to you what they may or may not have typed on the internet about someone else. 

You are taking it personally, when no one who replied meant any real harm from their comments. You have hurt yourself by over-identifying as a victim. Even the woman they were talking about will likely never know about these comments, so she won't feel bad that they were ever written. Maybe she's even doing something fun right now, while you're pitying her, because all you know about her is from someone trying to help her overcome an obstacle in her life. Her world is wider than that obstacle, but you aren't being given the complete picture.

There are people and places which offer unquestioning support to any grade of person, but much of the world consists of people who would draw the line somewhere. That's to be expected.

If these redditors haven't thought deeply and empathically about the question, it's because they're larking about on the internet and not being forced to face that same fear. If this is a fear you face, then you owe it to yourself to deal with it in more constructive ways than you have previously, but remember that you are in control of your emotional response. No one is making you feel this."

If you eat in excess of what you need to fuel and repair your body, you will not lose weight.

With strength training, you will not gain muscle quickly enough to off-set your eating habits. You will still think yourself overweight for a while before seeing the kind of change you're looking for and that is likely to be demotivating.
