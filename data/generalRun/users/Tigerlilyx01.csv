Vindicta,ff9fjfk,t1_ff8mh5x,1579711930.0,"You are defeintly right. I used to breathe through my mouth a lot, I learned when I was 21/22 that its not normal to breathe through your mouth and forced myself to learn to breath through my nose. Though I think its too late at this point for it to make any change. I still breathe through my mouth when I am sleep however which is a lot harder for me to control. I think that may be called sleep apnea, and I also read these facial characteristics  are associated with sleep apnea. Sometimes when I walk, I still find myself breathing through my mouth, as I feel I cant breathe through my nose when I walk. So I defiantly think its a functional issue too . 

I tried to tell my dentist assistant about this, but she said jaw surgery is a big over reaction and to try to go speech therapy and to buy a mouthguard to help stop teeth grinding at night. But I honestly I want the surgery for the aesthetic  results and a more permeant way to open up my airway. I wonder if its possible for insurance to cover it, since technically its a medical issue?  I also will talk to my plastic surgeon about this! Im hoping for now fillers can help my face a bit but I may need several syringes of them ha

I also had a few tooth extractions when I got braces when I was a kid, I also wonder if helped screwed my face up, as a kid, my face and palate used to be wider, it seems I got uglier when I got braces lol :/ .But it seems a lot of my family members have the same type of face too and also wonder if it is genetic as well. Same, I think I could have been an attractive girl if I have forward projection and didn't have this issue T.T

I think I may visit a oral maxillofacial surgeon along the way to discuss this problem further in depth and explore my options since fillers  maybe would only be a temporary solution to mask the problem"
Vindicta,ff8gti3,t3_es0c3s,1579677847.0,I have flat cheekbones/midface deficiency and slightly recessed chin. Getting fillers soon in those areas and hopes it improves my facial balance a bit!!
Trufemcels,ff8gd7k,t3_es6sqa,1579677270.0,"I think everyone honestly is like this, even if they do not want to admit it. Men all the time talk about desiring six packs, chiseled jawlines, hitting up gyms in high hopes of scoring a hot chick. I also want to ascend high as I can be so I can have a higher chance of ending up with someone I am actually attracted to. Lets face it, we all want to find our partners attractive, there always has to be a baseline of attraction there or else it just won't work out. I think most people want to be/work hard at getting attractive as possible to get the fittest mate (Biology at its work here) and to improve confidence. Though I may add, guys are sweet to pretty girls so it increases their chances of having sex with them. But Its not even just that, its also better treatment in general. I even see girls be super nice to pretty girls too, complimenting them and kissing their ass. I want to be complimented, I want to feel adored and loved. I am tiring of being ignored, having doors slammed in my face, being thought of as less value, getting insults and backhanded compliments, and constant trauma due to my ugliness.


I am saving up as much as I can for fillers and eventually surgery to improve myself to have a better life and improve my non existent social life (Dating, connections, friends)and even getting a job!!! your face affects every single thing you do, even just walking down the damn street and how people will react to you when passing smh."
Trufemcels,ff7p3hq,t3_es43eo,1579654908.0,"Oh yea, I always feel a lot more horny and have more urges to have a BF right before and during my period, those times are the WORST for me. I also feel like this strangely when I get very very sleepy and tired which is a hassle. I just do self pleasure. It does suck to not have a physical guy to do it with, but then I always feel relieved after the feeling is over because then at least I don't have to get paranoid or worry about possible pregnancy, regret or pain  afterwards :) Honestly I just fantasize about fictional guys, like the ones in video games, books, and such, its a lot easier for me compared to a real life guy because I feel ashamed and almost kills the mood for me since I know deep down that guy would never want to do anything with me lol. >.<"
Trufemcels,ff3ke0j,t3_eraqr5,1579542914.0,"Agree with you 100%.  I always thought it was bullshit. Usually maltreatment causes mental illnesses not strength!!! Would you tell a child that is being abused and bullied that it will make them stronger in the end?? Of course not!!! There are numerous studies done that confirms that long term abuse even damages the brain and diminishes your quality of life! Smh. I never got used to the rejection, hate, stares, and bad treatment. It just further traumatized me more, making me more childlike and sensitive, awkward, agoraphobic, unmotivated and depressed. We are a social species and we certainly do not thrive on exclusion and hate. I know its good to have resilience but not everyone is strong enough to have it. Its easier to say that ""pain/abuse makes you stronger!!!"" when you haven't lived through it!!  There is a reason why suicide rates are moderately high for people with PTSD and  depression (it will always haunt you) and why life quality is so low for us"
Trufemcels,feyzk76,t3_eqngha,1579452423.0,"These are some good points, but honestly my ugliness has not benefited me at all and I would still much rather take being beautiful with those outcomes than ugly.  Being ugly is still far worse and to me its more like an invisibility cloak than a superpower.  Being unattractive has caused me to be develop poor social skills and made me very very awkward.  I never had the chance to develop my social skills because nearly no one is interested in talking to me, so I am not sure how to start or end conversations or how to manage the flow of it.  This results in every social interaction being very stressful for both me and the person talking to me when I have to interact with someone. This also will make getting jobs a lot harder because of the interview process.

My loneliness which is the usually the price to pay for ugliness has made me horribly depressed. Being a social species we thrive on validation and acceptance which is a lot harder for someone who does not fit into the beauty standards.  I just lie in bed most of the time knowing my horrid fate.  Depression/ugliness has destroyed my personality and left a huge void in me, and made me lose motivation.   Beauty would have been my security, it would have helped me build a personality, and even if it didn't, at least even if am awkward, I would still be nice to look at which could make up for it. I give props for trying to find some positivity in it though"
Trufemcels,fevduvl,t3_eqof4w,1579396285.0,"I got 54%  lol :( i copy and pasted my results below :

You are not bad!

Prominent Features

Good face shape

Normal forehead size

Little interocular distance

Nose too wide for face (my smile makes my nose look a little wider when i am smile, so this is not too accurate)
Normal mouth size

Normal chin

Bad face symmetry

Trufemcels,feu7s17,t3_eqmsed,1579383930.0,"If you can afford it, I would recommend to try out fillers on areas you personally think you may think you need an improvement from a respectable and credited plastic surgeon , fillers are great for subtle improvements on the bone structure that hair and makeup cannot do . I am looking into this as well because my face also looks off as well even when I fully looksmax"
Trufemcels,fetubq2,t3_eqhxdg,1579380161.0,"Wow that's really really depressing.  It seems people only want to talk to you if you are pretty or have something valuable to people. People just look at me then look away or give me weird/dirty looks, I never get compliments or nice treatment like that!!! People get annoyed by my presence. This is why I shut myself out from the world, to be young and ugly is a depressing and horrible fate"
Trufemcels,fenubdu,t3_epwzpc,1579290861.0,"That picture kinda looks photoshopped, especially her face area like in the magazines or maybe it just a high quality picture. But yea  the comments are so depressing, knowing a man will never think of me like that in the comments, thats why i avoid oldschoolcool, it just bunch of beautiful people from the past and shows how motivated people are by looks since hot people are the ones most upvoted there lol. It sucks how drastic my life would change if looked like that. I would have so much success and happiness its not even funny !!

For me I like it and find it flattering, especially since I do not feel my age and  I will age a little slower i hope. The only drawback is people tend to undermine me and treat/ speak to me in a condescending manner which really pisses me off, having a childlike voice to match doesn't help either lol"

Trufemcels,feegozz,t3_eoqo51,1579033391.0,"Sometimes this does puzzle me, I also  have seen Stacies and Beckies with weak/recessed chins, messy hair, gummy smiles, low/ flat cheekbones, crooked noses yet still considered attractive. I remember I had a young pretty teacher and me and her literally had the same bone structure , yet she looked so much better than me, I find it so unfair. I guess her facial proportions and facial features were just more feminine than mine"
EUGENIACOONEY,fec5d6r,t3_eocm3c,1578966896.0,"I think the reason so is because Kati has a different type of face/bone structure and facial features than Eugenia, kate has a narrower face while Eugenia has a wider type, the heavy eye makeup suits Eugenia  better because of how her eye area is shaped and such"
Trufemcels,feamsrn,t3_eo5w4o,1578950387.0,"Yes that was always me. Thankfully I just finished my AA degree and this reason made me decide to continue my bachelor degree online, it was too tiring and stressful for me to physically be at school that had bad effects on my body and even hair (Developed one grey hair because of it I think). College is too depressing/ exhausting for me especially with all those social activities they make you do ugh"
Trufemcels,fe6idbz,t3_enycb4,1578891843.0,"That sub sucks!! They are one of the most delusional people ever and think they are so high and mighty. This post just shows how hypocritical they are. I read a post on there that says how no one cares what people look like and to just bEe yourself and how the reason we are alone is because of our personalities, someone made a post about femcels that had a pokemon meme that has Jesse from teamrocket saying ""I cant find anyone to love me because I am mean and nasty"" Wow. They think we are horrible people.

 What a bunch of BS. Attractive ppl can get away with bad personalities  (Attractive serial killers had tons of admirers) and will always have orbiters. Its like they will always blame us, its never other people, our circumstances we grew up in, or the environment we were exposed to that shaped us. It's our fault and we should feel bad for feeling and thinking a certain way because we been treated like shit all of our lives. 

Give me a break. Anyone would be miserable, bitter and negative if they are always excluded, rejected, ignored, insulted, and abused on a daily basis. Its hard to stay positive and upbeat when you have nothing but negative energy and bad luck constantly thrown at you.  Humans are social species that thrive on validation, acceptance, positive treatment and love, its how it fuels our survival. How is anyone supposed to be all sunshine and rainbows with that kind of life? GTFO"

Trufemcels,fe3uphs,t3_enlynp,1578853081.0,"I first dropped out of college at 18.becauase of bad social experiences and how i couldnt focus.. then spent years in my room doing nothing due to extreme anxiety and fear of my appearance and depression. Then I tried it at again at 23 and i just finished. I had an awful experience that I am too sad to write about since I do not want to remember, but it was awful, ignored and excluded as always. but somehow i finished it all the way this time. The only benefit I got out of it was the financial aid refund checks, which has given me enough to get fillers in my face to improve my appearance, so I guess the money and the AA degree at least was a two in one bonus for me for that awful and lonely experience lol.

I will continue my bachelor degree fully online after my horrid experiences. I do not want to be in such a depressing atmosphere like that again I do not thrive in classroom settings, I am very anxious in them and my PTSD cant let me focus. At least with online, I can do it in comfort of my own home and i can fully focus instead of me constantly worrying about people seeing my ugly face and having more bad memories of how unapproachable I am and seeing people my age get flirted with and living a life I always wanted"
PlasticSurgery,fdzmzp5,t1_fdzhfkm,1578791907.0,"Thank you for  you ranswer, i also feel tempted to stick Huettner due to her low complication rate and good reviews, just wish she was a little cheaper with the pricing. sorry for asking for more questions but when your friend said not the most amazing, did she mean by her results from Huettner procedures? did she feel she had better results in terms of fillers with another surgeon? im not sure how many years of expereince Huettner has with fillers, I was also wondering if by any chance if you or friend know any other surgeon in NYC that is is good that are a little cheaper than Huettner? sorry again for the questions,"
PlasticSurgery,fdzaz51,t1_fc29p8k,1578788361.0,"Thank you for your reply, in your opinion did you see a moderate difference/improvement with your friend after she got the fillers? I went to a consultation with Dr. Huettner recently, I also liked her, her prices are a bit steep/expensive though"
Trufemcels,fdyfygd,t3_encczo,1578779397.0,"Generally yes.  im a femcel due to my flat cheekbones, receded chin, and underdevelopment of my maxilla. So it's not a healthy look for me nor the habits it leads me to do (such as mouth breathing), and health is also connected to beauty. Bone structure is the anchor to your face and how your facial features are balanced. Most models have a similar bone structure which include sharp and high cheekbones, symmetrical faces, defined jawlines and chins which is why they are perceived as attarctvie most of the time.  A person can have decent facial features but if their bone structure is underdeveloped/not so good like recessed chin/jawline, midface defeciney, it can put them into the average looking or below average category due to the lack of strong support of the bone that would help balance their features out

However, I think a person can be ugly with good bone structure if they have wonky facial features that don't look symmetric  or proportionate. (like maybe huge nose, super small eyes, eyes too close together, etc..)   But I also seen people who have balanced and pretty faces even thought they have flat cheekbones and small chins/jaws which sometimes puzzles me, because I think a well developed bone structure would balance facial features out for the most part."

I somehow pushed through and finished but it also encouraged and made me pursue the rest of my education for my bachelor degree online, at least that way I wont be reminded  of what i am missing out on and have more painful memories, and be able to concentrate more and be more motivated to do my studies without that horrible and depressing atmosphere.

Trufemcels,fczg6jv,t1_fczbimg,1578100540.0,"I am sorry that you had a bad experience your surgeon, did your surgeon have good reviews btw? that's one of my main fears of it going horrible wrong, even it is just fillers or if they have high rated reviews. I made a consultation appointment with one for next week, and pretty nervous about it.

Yea community college people seem to have a high school mentality, I guess considering that community college takes anyone.  I am nervous that a 4 year school will be the same too.  Honestly I have no idea what bachelor degree I want. It seems whatever I want to study is useless or low paying.

I did think about a family and consumer science degree, I read it can give me a variety of options in the career field, but for this degree I would have to go college in person, it also offers a fieldwork as part of the major. but idk if its really I want to do.

 At first I wanted to be a counselor that's why I picked psychology, but I got so burned out and I can’t see myself staying in school long enough not to mention its expensive. Then I considered being a kindergarten teacher since I like kids but when I volunteered at a preschool, it was fun but got exhausted from dealing with all the kids, it felt like labor work really. . I would like to maybe work with kids one on one, but those careers I need a master's too.  Then lastly I wanted to be a nutritionist but im bad at heavy sciences and too squeamish to work at hospitals.


I also remember when I went to an internship workshop, I spoke with one member from an internship company and she told me what I study doesn't matter and its my skills and who I know that matter and how she is working in a field she didn't study. So I think I basically have to find my skills, but I barely have any lol.  I only have a few soft skills .


Ugh yes for sure,  i feel like i wasted my time at college. I find the idea of working and school at the time very hard, it was already hard enough for me to focus on my four classes at school, having a job on the side would have been quite tiresome. now I am trying to find work, like an office assistant or something to give me some experience and money. I applied to so many places online and never hear anything back. One place did call me but  bit too far to travel and got bad reviews on glassdoor. Another place basically ghosted me when they reached out to me lol. 

What did you get your degree in?


I only have volunteer experience from the daycare and library when I was a teenager. . I wish I had passions for something, my depression destroyed it all and just put me in survival mode. My depression also destroyed my creativity and personality, which also puts me at a disadvantage with interviews and networking.. etcc…. :/ I have no idea anymore, do you think its a good idea to work for a litte bit and then go back to school later on when I figure something out? im facing pressure from my mom, she thinks bachelor degree is key to good paying job and I am wasting my time trying to find out what I am good in and what I like, when its really the opposite way around lol

unpopularopinion,fcj55h4,t3_eh7rag,1577677522.0,"ya its what made me develop agoraphobia, depression, and anxiety.  There was a short time in my life when I was pretty when i started to do my hair, eyebrows, and makeup and my god my life was so simple and easy. Everyone was super nice and happy to talk to me. Now Im ugly again, I think due to stress, i don't know what happened but now even doing my hair, makeup, etc... I still don't look pretty, just average at best. The difference in how i am treated makes me very mad,  men now glare at me  and ignore me instead of smiling and being helpful. Women also became more awful, they look me up and down in disapproval, they don't want to talk to me or interested in being my friend because I am not stylish or pretty enough. It made me realize people are only nice to you when you have something they can gain from, which is either looks, money, and high social status.


It doesn't help I am a very sensitive person is who highly effected by the behavior and moods of people around me, so I am very depressed, bitter, and negative around people because of their bad energy they direct at me. I am only happy when I am alone since i am not judged or treated bad if i am alone, its why I resorted to continuing my education online and trying to find a way to work from home.


its also why i am saving up for plastic surgery, i wish to be pretty again and have my life to how it was back then. Life as an ugly person, you are just doomed to misery,  loneliness, and bad luck  and a easy target for people to feel better about themselves until the day you die."
Trufemcels,fc61qfd,t3_egdcyu,1577470297.0,"BIG time YES.  I also wear hoodies, sunglasses, and try to hide my appearance whenever i go outside. i also avoid people, even though I would like to have relationships. But I had too many bad experience to trust anyone ever again.  I cannot handle any more pain or more rejection, i feel i will have a mental breakdown soon enough. So its much safer for me to be alone. For about five years, i stayed at home doing nothing paralyzed by fear because of my appearance.  I tried some attempts to get better during the time like trying out anti-depressants and therapy, but the medications didn't work and all i got was ""just go outside until your anxiety gradually lessens"".But one day I just took the courage to apply to go to college when realized i spent the first few years of my 20' s holed up in my room and also because i felt guilt about doing nothing while my mom was working so hard.

I enrolled in community college and just finished. It was HELL. A lot of people didn't like me, I got bad comments on my appearances and treated like i didn't matter and ignored. The one person who thought I was my ""friend"" turned out to be toxic and shamed me (including my appearance) so I cut her off. all my attempts to find a genuine connection failed.  Which just further confirmed how hideous I am and how im too awkward and anxious for people to feel at ease around me.  

Now I applied for some jobs because I want to make my own money and save up more for plastic surgery before going to a four year college and not have the same shitty experience and  so I can have a better life, but when they call me back I freak out. I applied to a bank and they called me this morning and when I heard their message to call them back, I was happy but I am to nervous to call them back.  I looked up their website and their place, and it just look intidmating, well dressed business people. But ugh I need to make money asap lol

You aren't alone.   I am sorry that this happened to you btw, people are awful. i am not a psychologist but taking a jab a it, it sounds like you may have developed depression,  and agoraphobia/ extreme anxiety to being seen by other people as a response to how they have treated you, just like me .  Being treated like this can be traumatic for us, so sometimes becoming a reculse seems rational to protect us from getting hurt and re-traumatized all over again. But in the long run it will hurt us even more being isolated and prevent us from getting a job which is essential to surivve  :/

And plus you know them a bit better and how they act compared to online. Shoot, I met up with an online friend and she turned out to be horrible and a manipulator, and much different than how she was online, so that scared me off from meeting anyone else from the internet.   (but maybe it was my fault since she did show red flags before meeting up, but I guess out of my loneliness, I ignored it and gave the benefit of the doubt. Never will i do that again. I still have other online friends that are good, but I am more wary to meet up if they ever want to because of my last incident. I couldn't even imagine meeting up with a guy, too scary and doomed for failure.)"
