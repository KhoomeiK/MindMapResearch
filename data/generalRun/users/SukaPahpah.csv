AmItheAsshole,ff68fkb,t3_erlqlm,1579621585.0,HOLY CRAP. What a brat. It sounds like an honest mistake. I'm glad your aunt stood up for you. Your cousin needs to take better control of her food and start cooking for herself if she's going to be so entitled about it. NTA

AmItheAsshole,ff50guq,t3_ergc1h,1579576927.0,NTA. It's a tough situation but it's for the best you told them. I don't know what else you could have said. Your family could have reacted better but it was your parents actions.
Onision,ff4bv90,t1_ff41kgn,1579559967.0,It's so horrible but we just have to wait for them to be brought to justice. We need to just support the victims and warn others. It's all us bystanders can do.

WelcomeToPlathville,feezvus,t1_f8s3z6w,1579044905.0,I think this is a great point. The show was taped recently and it's opened up the older kids to want to be part of the world very recently. Teens and kids pick up to things quickly. I think the parents freaking out about losing control is genuine too.
