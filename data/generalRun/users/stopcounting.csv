That's why I'm still fat. And it's harder for some people than others, based on physical and mental conditions. 

But other than that, it's basic thermodynamics. Your body needs energy to run. Energy comes from calories. If you don't eat as many calories as your body needs, your body will use its fat for energy instead. If you don't eat enough and you don't have any more fat to burn, your body will stop working and you will die.

Almost every fat person thinks they're some exception to this rule, and ""no matter how little I eat, I don't lose weight!""

No matter who you are, no matter what else is wrong with you, if you put less food into your body you will eventually get smaller.
