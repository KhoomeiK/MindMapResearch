But, listen, you can't continue like this. You know how on an airplane, when they are giving you emergency instructions, they tell you to adjust the air mask on your own face before trying to help someone else? That is where you are right now. 

The situation as is can't be sustained.

Yes, it is very possible they will hold moving out against you. But, from the sound of it, they hold things against you anyway. 

Sometimes you just have to be OK with people being mad at you. It doesn't feel good, but that's not a reason to give into abuse.

Their debt is not your problem. Finding them a renter is not your problem - do you think they will honestly be happy with whoever you pick? More likely they'd try to make a deal like, ""well, you can't move out until you find us a renter we approve of"" -- and then just never approve of one.

How are the mental health services in your area? Or with your job? A lot of jobs have an Employee Assistance Program. It really feels to me you need an ally on your side to help you navigate all this. Someone who can listen objectively, help you figure out what you want to do, and give you tools to deal with all this."

Agree with him. Say, 'Yes, I am saying someone sho loves and respects me wouldn't speak to me that way.'

> saying he's not going to be my rug and let me hurl accusations towards me and is now contemplating our relationship.

Agree again. 'Yes, we should both contemplate this relationship, because all the signs are pointing to you being a manipulative, abusive asshole, and it's looking a lot like I would be better off alone.""

Sounds more like he led you on by pretending to be thoughtful, respectful, and understanding, and making you think he would always be that way.

Instead, the moment you tell him no, he becomes a sulky, manipulative baby. That's probably the real him, I'm afraid."

She should be scared of looking bad because you left, because she was being an asshole to you. She does look bad. In fact, she looks like a terrible person. Good for you walking out. Maybe next time don't feign a headache. ""Not in the mood to be your punching bag tonight, I'm out.""
