AmItheAsshole,ffad8bz,t3_esjfx7,1579732801.0,YTA- you’ve been in this kid’s life since he was 3 months old? I can’t imagine being in a kid’s life forever and not thinking he was mine. I hope he doesn’t pick up on the inequity.

There’s a wonderful restaurant/ brewery called Brewer’s Art. It’s a high end restaurant with great food and cocktails. Definitely get some mussels from Berthas. Visit the Lexington Market and get some crab cakes. Walk around Federal Hill, Fell’s Point, and Mount Vernon. The hotel Indigo is perfectly situated in Mount Vernon."
