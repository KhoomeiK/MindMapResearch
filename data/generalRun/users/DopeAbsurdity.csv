HadesTheGame,ffar112,t1_ffa54xp,1579742472.0,"> I really don't understand why other game studios/devs treat their games like art.

They don't. That is just the weird excuse they make to reject criticism. Your criticism is invalid because the game is art that is too complex for you to understand. It's bullshit. 

Art is made for various reasons. If you create a work of art for pure self expression and people don't understand it then it's ok because you made it for yourself but you probably should prepare yourself for harsh criticism and confusion from those that end up seeing it. If you create art specifically for the consumption of others (like a graphic design logo) and others don't understand or like it (An italian restaurant logo that looks like a catapult flinging poop emoji's at a giant cat on fire) then you are at fault for being a shitty artist.

Games are art but they are created for consumption. If you make a game and your target audience hates all or parts of it (the ending of Mass Effect 3) the excuse that it is art means nothing you are just a shit artist."
