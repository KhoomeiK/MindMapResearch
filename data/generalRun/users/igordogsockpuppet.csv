Pathfinder_RPG,ffpw0n5,t3_eu6426,1580107892.0,"I haven’t looked into the rules, but my only experience with it was negative.  Another player was playing one, and it seemed to be a spell caster that could do practically anything if properly prepared.  It was almost comically predictable, we’d be presented with a challenge, and the player would peep up, if we rest, my character can cast _____.

I don’t know.  Maybe it was 5he player that was the problem, not the class,  it it totally soured me to it."
dndmemes,ffpvlpf,t1_ffpp6og,1580107409.0,That’s a brilliant insight into animal minds
PoliticalHumor,ffpn4aa,t1_ffo4swi,1580099236.0,"Another fun fact about standard deviations.  Two standard deviations is about the limit where people start seeing things as unusual.  Taller than 6’3” is generally seen as unusually tall.  More likely than not, your height would be the first adjective they use when they describe you.  If you’ve got a 130 IQ, you’re very likely regarded as intelligent by most everybody, but not viewed as abnormally smart.  

I think Mensa requires a 132 IQ minimum.  Screw those guys, but if you’re going to have a club for smart people, just slightly above 2 standard deviations is an ideal place to put the minimum requirement."
Pathfinder_RPG,ffpm7bs,t1_ffopn24,1580098519.0,Thank you very much.  This is exactly the list I was hoping for.  I’m not familiar with spheres of might or path of war.  I’ll peak into them too.  Thanks
coolguides,ffplxm7,t1_ffoxz16,1580098319.0,"It’s called trepanation.  People absolutely do have holes surgically put into their head.  Open to the air.  You could reach in and touch their brain (or more likely, their dura mater.  Also, see cochlear implants.


The OP was claiming that Chan had a hole in his head with missing skull that his skin had grown over.  I think the myth is likely a misunderstanding that stemmed from Chan trying to describe it with his heavy accent and limited vocabulary."

coolguides,ffocwc0,t1_ffnuff7,1580076388.0,The general wisdom is you don’t leave holes in people’s head if they have active lifestyles.  You literally could kill yourself diving into a pool.  It turns out that Chan’s doctors agree.  Chan has a plate in his head.
coolguides,ffocevx,t1_ffmzl3j,1580076220.0,Nope.  There’s a plate in there.  He says there’s one in that very interview.

PoliticalHumor,ffmcufv,t1_ffkro1k,1580052556.0,"130 is two standard deviations above the average.  A cool thing about IQ is on a normal distribution just like the height of North American males.  Because of this, we can use height to exactly describe how rare or extraordinary high IQ is.

130 IQ is a direct analogue to being 6’3“"
coolguides,ffmb4m9,t1_ffmahjy,1580051661.0,Yes...  that’s what I’m saying.  Money alone doesn’t necessarily provide you with the care you need.

coolguides,ffm9bvv,t1_ffm2lei,1580050880.0,"Remember Steve Jobs?  A lotta good his money did him.  Being able to afford the best doctors isn’t the same as having the best doctors.  People literally try to treat their cancer with essential oils.

Ultimately, the entire thread is nonsense.  The hole in his skull seems to just be a rumor"

I’m also an introvert.  I also prefer the company of reptiles.  I’ve still got my first snake, whom I’m proud to say is nearly 30 years old now.  (I like to brag about her age and health)"
TooAfraidToAsk,ffl9bah,t1_ffkw6hg,1580036700.0,"What you’re describing isn’t introversion.  Introverts don’t hate people.  They just shy or don’t crave excessive social interaction, and often find it exhausting or stressful.

If you literally hate everybody, what you’re describing is closer to misanthropy or possessing cluster b personality traits."
TooAfraidToAsk,ffl8nz5,t3_eu39ji,1580036372.0,"Having zero friends isn’t healthy.  Thinking everybody is bad isn’t healthy either.   I don’t know your current situation, or what led you to feel this way, but you might want to see somebody about it.  You need social interaction to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  

Although, if you were being hyperbolic, and you have at least a few close friends (family members count too), or you don’t genuinely think that *all* people are bad, then I wouldn’t be overly concerned."
TooAfraidToAsk,ffl7mfc,t1_ffirx8n,1580036014.0,"Absolutely not.  It would be literally abnormal to feel any significant sorrow for somebody you hardly knew.  However, you might feel sorrow from empathy due to seeing closer family members who knew him better grieving.  It’s sad to see people who are sad.

My grandfather died, and I felt nothing.  I wondered if I was a sociopath.  My dog died and I was inconsolable for months.  My father died and I’ve never really recovered from it at all."

But yeah...  if it’s not what you want in a relationship, then there’s good reason to move on.  You’re going to experience so much in the years to come.  There’s no real reason to feel regret about moving to the next step in your dating life."
TooAfraidToAsk,ffl5t3r,t3_etxc3y,1580035291.0,"The feeling you’re describing is consistent with dissociative disorder.  Sometimes people feel like they’re not real, or they feel detached, as if they were watching the world through a tv.  This can last for days to years depending on the person.
