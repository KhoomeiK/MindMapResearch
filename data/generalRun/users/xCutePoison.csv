offmychest,ff64gol,t3_ervbje,1579618893.0,"I'm so sorry about that. Must have been a terrible experience but keep the nice and beautiful memories with him in honor, he loved you, you loved and love him and now he's in a better place. He's gonna watch over you every day and I'm sure he's proud of having such a nice sibling. Stay strong man, I'm with you, much love! :)"
offmychest,ff63z6u,t3_ervc2d,1579618549.0,"Bro I feel you, lost my greatest love one day on another recently aswell. I know how you feel. But don't give up, there's also someone out there who cares about you. Even a stranger like me on the internet. I don't want to say now ""There's still plenty of fish in the sea"" cuz I know that's not that easy as it's said but lives a cool thing and opens you opportunities wherever you don't expect them so keep on going, one day there's gonna come a girl your way, more beautiful, more charming and more lovely than she is, you're gonna live a happy life, I'm sure of that! :)"
offmychest,ff63a4d,t1_ff61ydn,1579618053.0,"And sometimes these strangers are less strange to someone than the real ""friends"" you have."
offmychest,ff635lh,t3_ervi0m,1579617961.0,"Keep the medication, there's nothing wrong with that! When you need it don't be ashamed of it, you're not the only one out there having to take them."

hardstyle,ff5bsel,t1_ff4llx7,1579586515.0,"Didn't see the other ones you are talking about to be honest. HS isn't a religion to me, it's a hideout. A community where I feel happy and comfortable and this just gives me an amazing feeling in combination with the music but I wouldn't call this a religion lol"
