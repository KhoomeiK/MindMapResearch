technology,ffc8f6k,t1_ffamqgb,1579793910.0,"So as long as people are free to not vote, and be suppressed you’re happy?"
technology,ffam37c,t1_ffaljff,1579739143.0,"You’re freedoms only exist until the government takes them away, from the house you “own” to the value of a dollar. What about your freedom when your income tax is due? Just vote at the bottom of your taxes. My comment was more about gerrymandering and voter suppression."
technology,ffajn21,t1_ffagkmt,1579737380.0,"Go ahead and open a restaurant, or eat kebabs, or move somewhere else"
howto,ffad1ut,t3_esjavm,1579732678.0,"Wait till spring, it’ll thaw out on its own"
technology,ff9y6jo,t3_esgrwb,1579724051.0,"It’s a great idea, probably just not ready for prime time. We should probably just start with mandatory voting and stop trying to squeeze different groups out of the process."
alberta,ff9as4v,t1_ff88c3w,1579708726.0,"Don’t forget the environmental costs we will be paying for the next thousand years due to broken aquifers, fracking, and  old, leaking oil wells that nobody is responsible for anymore."
science,ff6ad52,t1_ff69koa,1579622834.0,"Water availability for human use is a pretty stupid thing to focus on if there are no trees or other plants, or any other sort of an ecosystem left at all."
science,ff67so9,t3_erw0p7,1579621167.0,"But keeping people in jail is still $182 billion a year industry, so the sociopaths at the top still like it. Maybe they should spend a little of that money on education?"
science,ff67k5t,t3_ervh5n,1579621008.0,"So that’s actually a lasting positive impact, by growing trees?"
science,ff64aiw,t3_erv65b,1579618771.0,It’s probably due to electronic voting being used to sway results with minimal input.
Fixxit,fdzja0p,t3_eng8lv,1578790749.0,I’m guessing the float valve is leaking and overflowing.

By the way deciding what you do for a living is a bit of a luxury. I don’t fault the guy for wanting a job, I fault the government for allowing such a shitty company to make such an impact on our country. Keep kicking the underdog, it makes you asshole look huge."
britishcolumbia,fdsh6r6,t1_fdsg6vc,1578702671.0,"Of course I am, that’s the point. We are all the problem. Some people just aren’t ready to admit that."
britishcolumbia,fdsb1p1,t1_fdq4iq5,1578698491.0,"Such a hardliner, there’s a few options between coal rollers and naked hippies, I have to make do with the idiocy around me. I was born on stolen land, maybe one day we could fix that."
britishcolumbia,fdpcovk,t1_fdpb8k0,1578625307.0,"Perfect, watch this. I’m going to support our earth ferociously."
britishcolumbia,fdp8vfq,t3_emil69,1578622729.0,That looks a bit like me with my dirt bike in the back of my station wagon.
technology,fdp8kb1,t1_fdp7m8c,1578622523.0,"Wait for the ai to solve this riddle? No. We are the ones who are in control at present, we should not relinquish the control to an unknown entity. This is almost the only problem we have to solve in the next 50 years, AI  can take care of the small stuff."
britishcolumbia,fdp5l4a,t1_fdolq0d,1578620525.0,"Shit in My Hand?
You oil cultists are really strange! What I meant to say is I hope the natives blow up or injure all of the oil workers. No peace on stolen land."
homeowners,fdp5brz,t3_emj2dm,1578620350.0,I would strongly consider moving. There’s pretty much no way I would ever be happy with that situation.
technology,fdp4o0v,t1_fdoty92,1578619911.0,"It’s a tricky conversation, but the most important one to have at the moment. As humans are responsible for less work we have to re-understand what it means to “earn” a living. Is all of humanity working to prop up a few extra special people? Or are we all trying to rise together?"
technology,fdon3kn,t1_fdokc56,1578608517.0,But what about the socialism?!

Dirtbikes,fdogwje,t3_ementr,1578604905.0,I saw a YouTube of guys racing full size 50cc bikes.  They looked like 125s with the motor swapped
technology,fdobrq4,t3_emewys,1578602314.0,"I have limited my vehicle budget to $1000/year. Drive a $2000 used car for a few years and throw it away. Spend a grand on tires and a tuneup, just need to get another year out of it. Try that math with a car from the dealer. I’ll buy a new car as soon as it matches this level of economy."
technology,fdoa9uf,t1_fdo8l6s,1578601583.0,"The grass in your backyard probably does cause cancer, if you are using Monsanto products, chemical fertilizer, etc."
costa_rica,fdo9v31,t1_fdo6035,1578601387.0,Any scent is sort of toxic. Most people are using a lot less smelly stuff than they did 15 years ago. I understand everything turns to mold in Costa Rica but for your own safety don’t put any artificial fragrance in your car.
britishcolumbia,fdo93sp,t3_emf4jh,1578601015.0,"I blame the oil company, for producing the gas."
science,fdo8dcj,t1_fdo7uny,1578600660.0,But Celsius has more decimal places.  Can you taste the sarcasm?
