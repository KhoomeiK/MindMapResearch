SuicideWatch,fgfg7e1,t3_ey793w,1580737823.0,There is an individual life for everyone. If everyone has to die after the departure of their loved one there won't be a human on earth. It's really hard but it would pass. You are in the bad time and time can change from bad to good just like how it changed from good to bad now. Still there is hope. And the hope is you yourself.
SuicideWatch,ffkpxf2,t3_eu2cu9,1580026836.0,"There is definitely something good waiting for you. But there is catch .. you got to make that "" something good "" come to you.  Yes, whether you are alive or not the world is the same and it keeps going .. it stops for no one. So if you take your life, is that gonna change anything ? Nothing ! Your family will mourn but they too will move at some point of time. You are the hero of your life and this world is here for you. You see it through your eyes and your world ends with your end. So waiting for something good isn't an option. But you can turn your story around and make it a good one. And the change has to start from you. Depressed for long periods of time make people to lose any interest in life , perseverance,endurance and make us think we got to see if there is something good coming in our way. Nothing comes without effort. And you start to put effort to make yourself better mentally , physically, emotionally . 

If you see this world through a red colored glass it. Appears red. If you see through blue it appears blue. But the world is the same always. And the glass is our view , our mindset. You gotta change that view. When u feel better to view this world in a good mindset this world will be full of sunshines and rainbows. Good luck"
