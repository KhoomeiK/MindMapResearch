depression,ffdrzvb,t1_ffcgpac,1579827475.0,"I know how you feel. It's like a foot race, people are happily running this race at their own pace. Some are running fast and some are just strolling by but they are ALL comfortable. 

You are in this race too but your legs are shackled with heavy ball and chains. You have to drag a ball that weighs a ton of with every step. You see others passing you by and they tell you to hurry up. They keep asking you why are you so slow?  That's because no one else can see the chains and the  heavy weights you're dragging. It's invisible to them. 

I am on medication now. I can understand why you might not want to try it. For me, I knew I was stagnant in life. Dull, dead and dry. After a few years, my family made me see a psychiatrist who told me what we all already knew, that I have clinical depression. 

They wanted me to try medication but my stubborn ass was very resistant. A few years later and I'm  just as depressed. I would try some meds for a little while or be very non compliant. The first med didn't do much so I would be even more resistant to try a new one. 

The truth was because I was scared. I did not want to be depressed anymore. I wanted to die. My health and everything else was suffering too. I was hopeless and afraid that if I allowed myself to have a little hope that maybe this new medication might work.... I would be totally devastated and destroyed if it turned out that the medication failed to help me. 

After some time, I let the doctor do his thing with NO expectation that anything might help me.. sure, I'll take whatever med the docs prescribes and not think about it. I've tried trintellix which did not work. 

Then my doc prescribed me Cymbalta... and a week later the positive difference was noticeable.  I am grateful for it although I still regret wasting all these years. I would not say that it's a cure all but it lightens my mental load enough for me to get up and initiate working on things to better myself. 

Depression sucks but just remember how strong you are, carrying this burden on your shoulders that most people cannot even imagine but at the same time remember that help is out there and I know a better time will come for you."
SwordOrSheath,ffdng9c,t1_ffcyqhr,1579824611.0,Fuck that. We need to figure out what this dude experienced that made him choose jumping out the fucking window while getting shot up as the better option instead of just eating that pussy?!

These two dimensions have never met... but throughout history there have been certain points in time where an energy-matter balance was disrupted in one or both these dimensions resulting in these two dimensions coming dangerously close to a collision.
