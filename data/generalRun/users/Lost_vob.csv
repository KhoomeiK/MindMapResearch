NoStupidQuestions,ffivdwd,t3_etshez,1579983635.0,"Conspiracy Theorist. Tesla lost some mental faculties later in life. He started thinking to ideas that were, frankly, pretty stupid. He said relativity was metaphysics, he denied the existence of subatomic particles, and he wanted to fill the sky with giant bolts of plasma to power the world. But Conspiracy theorists LOVE stupid ideas. So they begin filling the internet with nonsense about him being some misunderstood genius.

Secondly, the oatmeal. A few years back, a webcomic called the Oatmeal made an extremely inaccurate webcomic painting this picture of Tesla as a scientific underdog battling Edison, who he painted as an evil asshole. Tesla actually admired Edison a great deal. But people *love* an underdog story, so no one bothered to look up any facts, and just took the comic at it's word. This made Tesla a popular to the average non-conspiracy theorist.

The truth it, Tesla was an engineer and gentleman Scientist of above average intelligence. But he was in the Gilded age, where  engineers and gentleman Scientists of above average intelligence were a dime a dozen. He was as a member of a collective of people who together created our modern world. He does deserve recognition, but no more than anyone else in that time."

Graduation rates are growing, and both Bush and Obama set measures in place to fund nursing education. But graduation rates arent the full picture. Not everyone who graduated will be working in the field. A lot of students don't fully understand how thankless of a job healthcare can be, and burnout is a real issue, especially with long, late hours in stressful environments.

Older generations are not retiring like they use to, and this has a major impact on hiring and upward mobility in the field. Most boomers are still recovering from the last crash. But, even so, they can't work forever. Nursing is still a few years away from being oversaturated, and we will see a lot of the older nurses retire in that time.

Of course, in the last few decades, talk of increasing access to healthcare has been a ***massive*** politicial issue that only gets bigger. Regardless of politics, this is going to happen. American competitiveness is dependent on increase access to healthcare. Some form of Universal coverage will happen in America in the next 5-10 years, regardless of what some politicial factions want to admit. It's unavoidable progress. Universal coverage will open up way more jobs and people who often avoided much needed care will now seek it out.

I did believe Edison was some powerful Titan of industry and Tesla was a misunderstood Scientist trying to make the world a better place inspite of Edison. Everyone loves the underdog, we as a society really like the David vs Goliath trope. But what you find when you dig into the history is that Edison *was* a misunderstood Scientist trying to make the world a better place. He came from nothing, and made something of himself. In fact, in Teslas autobiography, he says of Edison:

>The meeting with Edison was a memorable event in my life. I was amazed at this wonderful man who, without early advantages and scientific training, had accomplished so much. I had studied a dozen languages, delved in literature and art, and had spent my best years in libraries reading all sorts of stuff that fell into my hands, from Newton's ""Principia"" to the novels of Paul de Kock, and felt that most of my life had been squandered.

Tesla was so impressed with Edison, he wondered if his own education was wasted because of all Edison accomplished without it. And Tesla was a hard man to impress, too.

OurPresident,ffb4dkr,t1_ffb46sm,1579751481.0,*That's what's Tulsi is fucking saying!!!* You lost respect for someone who 100% agrees with you because she made a protest vote ***in support of Bernie Sanders*** that has no effect on the outcome.
OurPresident,ffb450o,t1_ffb2lsk,1579751305.0,"The impreachment trial of Clinton lasted a month,   and this has already been drawn out longer than Clintons impeachment. Best case scenario, Bernie gets out a week before supertuesday."
OurPresident,ffb0ved,t1_ffayq1l,1579749027.0,"She did it because of ""party politics."" Establishment Democrats had 3 years and a fuckton of reasons to impeach, but they choose to time it in such a way that *just so happens* to forces Bernie and Warren to miss campaigning during supertuesday, but you fault *Tulsi* for it? Tulsi tanked her career in 2016 to support Bernie and she continued to do so by voting ""present"" to draw attention to the issue with party politics. If supporting Bernie causes you to lose Respect for someone, may this isn't the sub for you..."

But as adults, rolling over or walking isn't a great thing? These people are idiots, they still have royalty running their country, you have to coddle them."
SandersForPresident,ffatylv,t3_eslyp6,1579744428.0,"If there are no DNC shenanigans, Bernie wins without any trouble. But there will most definitely be shenanigans.

Credit where Credit is due, the RNC did the right thing in 2016 by letting ***the people*** pick the candidate, and it paid off for them. Hopefully the DNC will get a clue and do the same thing in 2020. The polls are clear, if they try to shove an establishment candidate down the people's throat, they will lose. Happened in 2016, and it will happen again. A populist candidate will always win in the current political environment."

changemyview,ffadsag,t3_esisay,1579733200.0,"I understand, the data is very clear, but it doesn't line up with what we would think intuitively. It doesn't make sense. There are several reasons for this, and it differs from industry to industry. But here is my response to some of your comments.

>Businesses aren't just going to eat that cost.

That's the core problem with your thinking, they do. There is only so much elasticity in things like price, quality, and staffing, and any businesses worth a shit is going to Max that out as much as they can. So they are already at their limit when the increase hits. Their prices are already as high, and staffing and quality are already as low as the market will allow them to be. 

Of course, they can always refuse production, but a reduce in production means a reduction in profit. You just gave all your minimum wage workers a mandatory raise, the ***last*** thing you need is a decrease in profit. 

So they absorb the cost and move on. Eventually everything will even back out as worker become accustomed to their new, higher wages and start spending more."
