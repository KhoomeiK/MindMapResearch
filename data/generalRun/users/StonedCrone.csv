TopMindsOfReddit,ffzykv6,t3_evzetu,1580396170.0,"My dad's education cost him $680. He graduated in 1968 with 2 associate degrees from a community college. He took 3 years to graduate. He took out a loan. He didn't need a cosign and that included the 23% interest that was incurred and compounded for 5 years. He finished paying off the loan in 1973. He was 25 years old. 

In 1998, my student loans for 4.5 years of college and a bachelor's degree from a New York SUNY school, (as a NYS resident...tuition is partially subsidized already),  my loans with compounded interest were $13,470. My final student loan payment was made in 2013. It took me 14 years to pay back the loan. I was 37 years old. 

My daughter is going to be starting college in the fall of 2021. She is a high honor student who could get into a very good school. My fear is that we won't be able to get the loans, because she will need a cosign for tuition that is around $15k or more per *semester*. Her 4-year loan outlook looks like $120,000 in loans. We can't afford to take on all of that. I am disabled and we can't seem to save much, at all because of extraneous medical costs that go beyond my HMO coverage. I'm trying to get her prepared to apply for scholarships, but even if she can win some money, there will likely be a huge loan out at the end of her college career. That's just for a bachelor's degree! What if she wants a masters or maybe she will want to go into medical school or law school. Maybe she wants a PhD. 

But with college costs the way they are inflating, the way the economy does not reciprocate once these kids get out into the workforce, what's there to encourage the brightest and best of our students to seek advanced degrees at prestigious universities? 

Something's got to give. Education should be for everyone, not just the super wealthy."
