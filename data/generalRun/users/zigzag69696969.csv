It all comes down to thinking about sustainable replacements for your high-cholesterol foods.

Ex #1: Red meat/chicken with skin/pork. Replace with beans, tofu, fish.

You don't have to cut these out, but if you can replace one meaty meal a week with one beany meal, you're making huge progress.

Never underestimate the power of beans! Tofu and fish are really expensive, but beans are cheap! American culture has conditioned us to look down upon the humble bean, but in truth there are many different kinds of beans out there that you can use to make all sorts of foods. 

If you don't want to fuck around with rehydrating them, you can still buy cans for very little money. 

Examples of bean dishes:

Bean salad

Pureed bean spread for toast

Beans in a casserole

Beans in a sandwich

Chickpea flour savory crepes


Ex #2: Mayo, whole fat yogurt, cream cheese, butter, lard, palm oil. Replace with any of the following: olive oil, avocado oil, canola oil, peanut butter, safflower oil.

Say you get up in the morning and you want toast. Rather than putting mayo, butter, or cream cheese on it, you could put peanut butter or another nut butter of your choosing (just make sure to read the label as some plant oils are actually high in cholesterol). Note, though, that the only ingredients that should be in your peanut butter are peanuts and salt. I get teddie's all natural super chunky peanut butter.

You could also cut it in triangles after toasting, and dip it in olive oil mixed with some mushed up garlic, garlic powder, basil and oregano to have a tasty and low cholesterol snack.

Say you love yogurt. Consider what kind of yogurt you're eating. Is it loaded with sugar? Is it whole-fat? Maybe you replace that with low-fat greek yogurt and add your own sugar in the form of simple syrup, honey, or molasses. This will allow you to control the amount that's in it, and Greek yogurt has more protein and will keep you full longer.

Ex #3: Pastries, pasta, fries, potato chips, cereal. Replace with: whole grain cereal, protein-boosted pasta, wasabi peas, roasted chickpeas, fruits and veggies, honey and molasses.

This one is less to do with cholesterol and more to do with just eating healthy in general. Carbs can creep up on the best of us, and I've found that three things have helped me the most:

1) Break any sugar craving cycle by replacing pastries, cakes, pies, etc. with fruit, honey, smoothies, molasses, you get the picture. Controlled amounts of natural sugars added to a base like yogurt or whole grain cereal is a million times better than eating a muffin you bought. If it's really bad, start by eating graham crackers instead of dessert, and slowly cut down on the number of crackers you need to eat to stop the craving.


2) Swap regular pasta for multi, whole-grain, or protein added pastas. Consider soba and buckwheat noodles, as these are filling and high in protein. They're expensive, but a box of so a noodles has lasted me twice as long as a much bigger box of regular spaghetti, because I don't need to eat a shitton to feel satisfied.


3) If you find you're eating your protein but can't stay full unless you eat a ton of carbs, it's very likely that there aren't enough vegetables in your diet. A bag of frozen spinach mixed in with your pasta sauce can bulk up the pasta significantly, helping you feel more full without eating a ton of calories.


Good luck!"

HealthyFood,fdp8evc,t3_emd4i7,1578622421.0,"Low-fat greek yogurt mixed with about a tablespoon of mayo for every 2-3 cups of 'gurt. Then add pickles, tuna, and onions cut up in little bits. Takes maybe 10 minutes to make in a big batch and it adds a lot of protein to your toast. 

Another idea if you're trying to stay low on dairy fat as well: olive oil and pureed chickpeas, or any beans for that matter, seasoned however you like would make a good spread. You could make this taste like anything from hummus to southwestern-y to curried, even. Maybe even add some shredded white chicken in there to add protein."

There will always be horrible people who can't be saved (people who are incapable of empathy and remorse, and have no problem hurting those around them to lift themselves up) but those are very very few and far between.
