college,fdh1bgr,t3_elcmhp,1578413224.0,"Found a job that works around my schedule, very difficult to do IMO. Work between 30-35 hours a week while taking 12-15 credit hours depending on the semester. This semester will be the end of my junior year. So far, my cumulative GPA is a 3.68. I generally stay pretty tired during the times of class and work together but overall I’m pretty satisfied with the results thus far. Can be very mentally challenging and burnout becomes a very real thing though. To each their own, there is no right way to do life."

AskReddit,fcxbz5t,t3_ej7pm7,1578058721.0,"“1984” by George Orwell. 

Description 

Totalitarianism. In writing 1984, Orwell's main goal was to warn of the serious danger totalitarianism poses to society. He goes to great lengths to demonstrate the terrifying degree of power and control a totalitarian regime can acquire and maintain.

Great book, I think it is very applicable to current society as well, especially regarding mass surveillance in the US."

relationship_advice,fcqnx0r,t3_eiisg6,1577889302.0,"Well you don’t exactly give any examples of toxic masculinity besides stating that he displays it. I don’t really know what’s going on between him and his dad realistically so there’s not much I could really tell you. I would sit down with your boyfriend and just try to talk to him about the situation as a whole. If he doesn’t want to talk about it, don’t make him. Tell him there can be another time when he is more comfortable. Don’t pry, it can sometimes make the situation more complicated. Most men do not want to talk about their personal problems or demons because that is how we are generally socialized and it mainly still seen as a gender role normality. If you can get him to talk about it, try to come to an understanding of his situation. Try to help him figure things out and understand his emotions and then potentially you can work on the overall situation. 

Best of luck."

relationship_advice,fcqla36,t1_fcqkqd6,1577888006.0,"That sounds like a solid course of action. Do not let this consume you. Try to find things to take your mind off of it if this is all you can think about. Come to an acceptance of the situation and try to find some understanding. There are likely many more relationships in store for you in the future, each unsuccessful one teaches you something and helps you learn what you like and do not like in a partner. 

Good luck."
relationship_advice,fcqk4uc,t3_eiignx,1577887417.0,"My friend, you are still very young and you have many more experiences ahead of you. Everybody goes through this. It’s very easy to get hung up on a ex, especially if this is one of your first real relationships or one that is meaningful. I understand that this is very painful for you and you wish to have her back in your life. But from what I’ve read, she does not seem to want the same. Of course, I am an outsider looking in. However, I would not continue to pursue this in hopes of salvaging it personally. I think that you need to move on, which may take a long time, but it can be done. If you are having these issues this early on in the relationship prior, having a meaningful, long-term relationship does not seem very likely if you were to successfully “win her back”. 

A song comes to mind when writing this paragraph,  “House With No Doors- By George Strait”, the line “You can’t make a woman feel something she don’t, and you can’t build a house with no doors”.  Give it a listen, it may help you better understand my point of view. 

Best of wishes and best of luck, have a great 2020."
