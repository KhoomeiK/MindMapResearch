Give yourself a break, You used your body’s resources to make a person and they need to be replenished. Humans are both are animals and higher-thinking creatures. The animal in you decided it needed what that chicken had. Your higher-thinking self can evaluate and return to your normal choices whenever you want."
relationships,ffi23l3,t3_etrcf0,1579962809.0,"I’m sure you’ve heard or read this many times before but I’m going to remind you....it’s ok to say no to a favor any time you want. Also, you don’t have to care if the recipient of your ‘no’ is pissy about it. You can draw a line on the boundary of your happiness and stand behind it with both middle fingers in the air and know that you’re doing the right thing."
confession,ffhwvki,t1_ffh9x5z,1579957476.0,You’re right. He’s a good kid and we developed a good system together.
confession,ffdzp2t,t1_ffdvofg,1579832956.0,"Well thanks! But then after that he was like, “What chore can I do for $3.99?” Since the whole lesson was about how you have to work for money..."
AskReddit,ffd1y18,t3_esms6x,1579811812.0,"I wanted to ask this question just now, but thought I better search it up to see if it's a common question. I have to say that like my life, the answers here are pretty disappointing."
confession,ffctsfr,t3_esxnna,1579807107.0,"My kid ran up $90 in charges once when I didn’t have the settings right to require a password for every purchase. I made him work for $3 an hour. He mostly raked leaves for me, my neighbor and my best friend. It took several weekends though and he couldn’t get his game back until he “paid back” the money."
AskWomen,ffbyycl,t3_esroxp,1579787172.0,"The most important thing a good boss can do is remove obstacles that impede performance. They listen and have empathy for their staff. They communicate goals and needs in a transparent and timely way. They protect and insulate their employees from outside noise and departmental drama. Also, a rare but valuable skill is to be able to give critical feedback while still making an employee feel valued and appreciated."

NorthCarolina,ff8vco2,t1_ff8ubo8,1579697350.0,Now that’s fast! Haha! They would get you for that in my neck of the woods.
NorthCarolina,ff8txw8,t3_esayja,1579695964.0,Not surprising. More than one person who has moved to NC from out of state tell me that North Carolinians always drive 5 over the speed limit and never use their signals.
offmychest,ff8tpxb,t3_esayu9,1579695737.0,"You could get dressed up with your husband in your bridal clothes and have a photo shoot with a different photographer. It will just be the two of you, but you’ll have something nice to frame and display."
aww,ff8rxdt,t3_esaplp,1579693696.0,This is heartbreaking. Just awful.
relationships,ff7pzi8,t3_es4b0j,1579655534.0,"If this is very out of character for her, then her doctor is probably your best resource for the right kind of treatment and support. I recommend going with her to her next appointment and letting her know that you’re going to be bringing it up with the doctor. Whatever is happening, she needs to talk to someone who can treat and monitor her emotional well being from now through post-partum."
relationships,ff5tg7f,t3_ertaz5,1579609599.0,I think you need to come to terms with the fact that you are unhappy. You’re the only one who can decide what to do about it.
relationships,ff5sk0c,t3_ertfj9,1579608623.0,"She’s definitely doing something she doesn’t want you to see. I ignored the subtle signs like this for while, until one day I just couldn’t anymore. He was cheating. Trust your gut and find the truth. Ask her to open her phone for you....be cool about it, not angry or too pushy. Just ask. If she won’t, then you know."
AskReddit,feye7xq,t3_eqwmzk,1579444275.0,Some cultures say that a dream of tooth loss or crumbling teeth is a death omen. But I’ve had a few of these dreams and no one died after. You’re probably just stressed and grinding your teeth in your sleep.
Dachshund,fetsuip,t1_fetlzwq,1579379661.0,She practices a lot. :)
interestingasfuck,fes5ksp,t3_eqhew9,1579361645.0,I feel like there’s a lot of things I would eat in a life or death starvation situation. And I understand that these are unfertilized. But I don’t understand why someone who was not dying would eat this.
relationships,fegt8tc,t1_fegswjs,1579102009.0,She didn’t lie by omission. No one vomits their entire life story in one day. And three weeks is not enough time to be “too deep in”. You are ridiculous.

relationships,fdkd9rt,t1_fdkap96,1578501431.0,I kind of feel like if you felt like she was being respectful of your boundaries there wouldn’t be a question to answer here. I don’t think you’re wrong to question this situation.
relationships,fdk73ma,t3_elu2r2,1578497580.0,"I work in an industry with people from many countries. I’ve never come across a culture in which that text you were forwarded would not be considered disrespectful. 
However, I think the important thing for you to evaluate is your personal boundaries. Regardless of culture, your boundaries are your boundaries and you have a right to them."

I promise that if you choose to stay, there will be a day (many days) that you will be glad you’re here. All those people you addressed in this post don’t deserve the pain you’re going to pass to them. Let your love for them keep you with them where you should be."

gardening,fcj718e,t1_fcj2rww,1577678860.0,They are pretty big for chemical treatment. I’d be worried about ground contamination. They’re so old and deep. I figure as long as I keep digging it out when it sprouts it will either run out of energy or I’ll get all the parts eventually.
gardening,fchrwkf,t3_ehbf7a,1577653485.0,"The sad thing about this is that they can dig it up, but a yucca that big will likely come back. They’re not just evil, but also immortal. I’ve been trying to dig these out of my yard for several years, they always come back."
relationships,fc483dr,t3_eg3c6a,1577409167.0,You are not over-reacting. Why would you want to talk to someone who literally takes no responsibility for anything they do? I feel like if she would admit and show remorse for her behavior (your abuse) it might be worth considering a reconciliation. But she has no remorse and because of this it’s fair to predict that she will repeat past behavior. Your grandma is a sweetheart and she’s just trying to be a good mom to everyone. Be there for her when your mom starts acting up again.
