The most obvious reason is Jay’s story is complete BS. He lies and changes his story multiple times. The cops fed him everything to the point where you can see his story change based off of new information he got. 

There is no need for Jay’s story to be as messed up as it is if he was telling the truth.

These talking heads lose all sorts of competitive common sense  when they take the pads off and grab the mic. 

Heres what people are overlooking when the play is in real speed. Remember this happened at real speed/ real time. Not slo motion . 

Carson is diving or stumbling for more yards. He is not giving himself up. So he has to be brought down. Theoretically with his hand being down he could friggin stay on his feet and keep going. So simply tagging him with his hands isn’t enough. So Jadeveon has to put force into his tackle or hit to make sure Carson is down. 

Now because Carson is maybe 3 feet off the ground, Jadeveon has to lower his shoulder and drive it towards the ground to get to carson. Simple human anatomy and the law of physics tells you that Jadeveon will have to lower his head too to make this happen. 

So Jadeveon’s helmet is bound to make contact with Carson and yeah it can possibly make contact with Carson’s helmet. It’s incidental contact folks. Nothing reckless about it. 


For the record I am not mad at any Eagles fan for being pissed. Carson is your guy. Him being out undoubtably cost you a chance at the game. Although I disagree with you on the technicalities of the situation, I understand the emotion and the desire to grab the pitchforks. 

But to everyone else trying to shame Clowney for this, give me a fuckin break. Watch touch football. Y’all have no clue how impossible it is for defensive players if you try to make what happened to Carson illegal. It’s just an unfortunate accident in a violent game. 

Don’t hate the player. Hate the game."
nfl,fddl5ef,t1_fdcihfs,1578316461.0,How is it wreckless? You realize that is his job? To tackle.  If you are tackling someone low to the ground you have to lower your head. The head to head contact was completely incidental. It’s amazing how Goodell has completely changed the view of the average fan to look at this as the fault of the defender when its just the price of playing a full contact game.

nfl,fdctsgn,t1_fdbwh87,1578284100.0,"Slo motion does that. 

People are acting like the law of physics don’t apply to defensive players and that slo-motion is real time. 

Anybody who thinks this was an evil heinous hit in any sort of way is an idiot who has been moulded and manipulated by the NFL to believe that these hits are egregious when really they are just doing their job playing a violent game with physical contact. 

Shit happens. 

They play the game in real time. It’s not like the friggin Matrix where you can move and make decisions in slo motion.

serialpodcast,fcs630x,t1_fcs40q4,1577911951.0,"Dude. Think about this carefully.  Let me break it down for you. 

First off. The cops’ plan worked. So it’s silly to say that the cops should have gone after the black kid when they got the kid they wanted behind bars. 

But lets say they wanted to target Jay. First off. How do they even get Jay in the building if he is the target? Jay is giving them a story about Adnan. You need someone to give them a story about Jay to make it work.  

How would they convince Jay to snitch on himself. 

The cops fed Jay all of the information he has. Who are they going to feed to convince everyone that Jay is the issue. 

And what motive are you going to manufacture. It’s way easier to go after the ex or the current boyfriend.  But Jay’s connection to Hae is so limited, is the “black kid did it” really going to be enough. 

Basically to pin this on Jay is impossible and makes no sense when they wanted Adnan."

serialpodcast,fcs322d,t1_fcrxic5,1577910740.0,"Dude. Understand what you are doing. 

You are convincing yourself that someone who is an asshole enough to falsely accuse a guy also would have the integrity enough to eventually come clean and admit they were lying. 

Isn’t there a myriad of reasons why someone like that wouldn’t recant their story. Could be pride, pure stubbornness, may be he has an incentive to keep his mouth shut or maybe he has been threatened, either way that shouldn’t matter. 

The real issue is the cops using the same tactics that put many innocent men into jail."
serialpodcast,fcrrlzw,t1_fcrpfv1,1577905676.0,"Dude. Jay’s story changes all of the time. Didn’t you watch the newest documentary where he is talking about 10 pounds of weed?

Obviously Jay for whatever reason has been convinced that it is in his best interest not to tell the truth after this time. He is not in jail for something he arguably should be in jail for. That is a good enough reason right there. 

But what I was referring to that happens all of the time is the cops using false confessions and coercing witnesses to secure convictions. 

You are right. It is super easy to find
