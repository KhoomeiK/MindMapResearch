And i also have a ton of eating issues stemming from various chronic health conditions making it very hard to either get food down, or keep it down once its in there. Either way, bread is one of my favorite go to staples. Pillsbury honey butter crescents for example are something i can almost always manage to ingest fully and my husband keeps on hand. Sometimes even nutritional meal replacement drinks (such as ensure) are too heavy for my stomach to handle, but bread is light and fluffy enough while still being good enough complex carbs on days thats all i can manage to eat.

I cant remember which of those is which anymore, one is said to be our “rational” mind and the other is also referred to as the “ape brain” or our impulsive desires that arent actually helpful to us anymore in current modern times but are left over from the days our ancestors relied on those instincts to survive. Like the urge to find shiny things? “Shiny” triggers our ape brain to think “i see fresh water nearby” and to thus search for the shiny because it means life giving water. Those instincts dont account for much in modern times anymore. Yet they remain. Sadly we are still only breaking the surface of how our bodies/brains work and there are many unanswered questions still."

Its instinctual for them to seek social approval because their ape brains whisper that if they are rejected by their peers, they will be expelled from the pack and die of exposure. Most people just cant get over that our ape brain isnt necessarily the voice to be giving the most attention to anymore though. Not all the members of a species, evolve at the same rate. Sadly that means some people are ruled by nothing *but* their ape brains while some seem... higher evolved to modern times.

If someone actually wanted suggestions on how to improve their situation, they will ask straight up for advice or what you think they should do next. If they dont outright ask for advice, all they want is an ear to listen and a (possibly metaphorical depending on how you are with physical contact) shoulder to lean on.

aspergers,fgnqob2,t3_ezdhxi,1580950751.0,"I am reminded of my mother talking about when my (aspie) older brother was little. Even as a small toddler, he preferred being alone in his room. He was perfectly happy alone in his room with his toys. My parents came in regularly to be sure he was clean and still safe, but he just hated being held or even in the same room as other people soooo much. And this was his toddler age. It was a bit of a shock for my mother as my aspie brother is her middle child, and my eldest sibling was an overly clingy baby she had to stay home with because first (NT) baby *refused* to bottle feed. 

Though my mother never described a lack of bonding to my brother, shes always been there with him working through his diagnosis (he was 7 when diagnosed) learning coping skills etc. i can see the mothers love in her eyes as she looks at /talks about him (im also a mother now too) 

However, right after my brother was born, my biological father (also an aspie, i find it odd research is currently leaning towards the mothers passing on “the genes” for asd... but in my family its all the men. My paternal grandfather, father, and brother all have it) had a bad work accident and became a stay at home dad to my infant brother (and 4 yr old sister) while mom returned to work as the only capable adult (he lost half his hand in a machine)

Lyme,fgng1do,t3_eze662,1580944094.0,"I contracted at about age 4, right after my older brother was diagnosed with autism. He got all their attention growing up and i was punished for “attention seeking out bursts.” Quickly i learned to self soothe. Once my brother was out of the house, i started contracting throat infections one after another and kept falling “mysteriously ill”. Finally being the only child left in the nest (youngest of 5 and for an age scale, my eldest sister is the same age as my mother in law) my parents realized maybe there *was* something actually wrong. 6 YEARS of misdiagnosis after misdiagnosis, we finally find a disease that seems to fit everything, and a specialist who agreed. 

Three and a half years of excruciating treatments later.... nothing was “fixed” despite the lyme being “cured” because like you, i had it undiagnosed for far far too long and all the nerve damage it did was too extensive. (I wasnt diagnosed till 24, making it a solid 2 decades it had free play in my body)  that was almost 3 years ago that ive been “cured”. I have since needed to get both a cane for home use, and a walker if i want to leave the house because of really bad POTS. I can barely do ANY housework so my husband not only caries all the financial stress but household stress as well, on top of basically being my nurse on my worse days. Sometimes im basically bedridden for weeks. 
 

The first year living alone together was the hardest. He had lived with me at my parents (they had a guest room he used, he paid them the same rent he had been spending on a single room of a bachelor house on their insistence to help with my mental health) but then my dad was still the home maker, not my now husband. Once it was just the two of us in our own place, suddenly he realized just how frequently practically every chore would fall to him. It took resentment building up and sparking a fight that opened the doors to necessary communication. For many things, i had to keep reminding him, im not strong enough to do x or i cant stand long enough etc etc before finally he started to really realize the full extent. What actually really helped, was him finally working from home for several weeks/months so he actually saw that i really was in too much pain to move for entire days etc etc.

Now he beams with joy whenever he sees me doing any tiny chore, taking the recycling outside, emptying dish washer, put his car keys in the key bowl. Because instead of him seeing it in the context of “well fucking finally” he now sees it in the context of “shes actually feeling well enough physically/mentally(also bipolar) to act on her desires to not live in filth!” Now when i break out a craft project, instead of seeing energy “wasted on what could be put into chores” he sees that im at least happy enough to be crafty, if not physically feeling well enough to do real housework.

My crafting that i took up (long before meeting him) to cope with my conditions gradually taking more and more from me, caused several fights early on in that learning to live alone together period. At first he couldn’t distinguish between “energy to sit and craft for 15+ hours” and “energy to get ONE FULL household chore like cleaning the entire kitchen done” simply because they “took the same amount of time” 

I had to really break it down for him, just exactly what goes into all that, that doesnt into crafting. For instance, i sort of “nest” when crafting, so i only need to get up for potty breaks between movies... but cleaning the kitchen? All the standing, walking, reaching, bending, scrubbing... it was finally sitting there watching me *try* to clean several times before it really sunk in. 


It was hard. I almost left several times, even contacted relatives to ask if the option of staying with them awhile was there or not. But now that he really understands... its just so much better. For the very first time, i dont really feel like a burden. He doesnt make me feel like we are missing out on social crap because my husband is autistic (same kind as my brother actually) and prefers being home with me on the couch anyway. Most people would (and have) tossed me aside as broken unwanted goods, but i just wasnt a right fit for them, nor them for me. And im better off without them constantly making me feel shameful for existing and trying to keep doing so. He finds the love and emotional support i give him to be more than worth the price of caring for me until death do we part. He frequently reminds me of this fact whenever reality tries to bring us down with things like articles reminding us how at risk of dementia (which he has experienced caring for with a late grandparent) or an otherwise difficult later life, i am due to the unquantifiable amount of nerve damage to pretty much everything (and growing issues with brain fog and memory lapses)

BipolarReddit,fgmdh21,t3_eyzc0d,1580922443.0,"I can remember having depressive episodes all the way back to early primary school (6-7 years old? Im a 31 yr old female depressive bp type 2 btw) i mostly raised myself as my parents were busy working or caring for my older (autistic) brother and i am still not close to any of my family in order to discuss this sort of thing. Not even any friends from when i was young. 

Something about my bipolar that really stands out to myself though in my own memory, one of my biggest embarrassments... We moved a lot and i changed school very frequently (made it to 9th grade and i attended 13 schools in that time) and eventually learned not to make solid connections with kids at school because id just leave again soon so why bother. (No sleep overs or ever seeing anyone outside of school, never invited to a birthday party or anything) But whenever a depressive episode hit... it was obvious to even children and eventually someone would be kind enough to ask the weird book worm if they were ok. I felt... bad, not having a good enough reason, or any reason really... but my inner sorrow was so great i felt the need to justify it. I started making up family deaths or maybe an anniversary of one (to explain not missing school for a funeral) this usually resulted in me being left alone to my misery (which was the reaction i wanted at the time)"

If OP got just any ol’ cashiering gig thinking they were all the same... that could quickly lead to a suicidal episode and I merely wanted OP the reconsider “any ol’ minimum wage” job as the same.
