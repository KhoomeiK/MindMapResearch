And proving to my teacher that I showered after PE.

PE was a nightmare for many of us growing up in the 80s."
IAmA,ff4vuhf,t3_erek2q,1579573672.0,"So, I have an autoimmune disease (SLE) and I was diagnosed with Eosinophilic Esophagitis. I noticed things got bad when I ate nightshades, but my scratch test came up negative and my doctors think I am crazy. However, I cut nightshades (especially potatoes, they were the worst) out of my diet and, voila, no more ER emergency extractions when my throat closes up. What gives? Why can’t this be diagnosed through testing?"

television,fdfmzrv,t3_ekwln1,1578365449.0,"I think the average person doesn't watch many of the movies that are nominated, so they don't care.  

And many of the TV shows are fairly obscure so, again, not many viewers.

I wrote a haiku to summarize:

I love not knowing

Those loved by Hollywood hacks

I'm blind, yet I see"
politics,fcp2j5h,t3_eic2mm,1577848491.0,"It was more complicated with the Jews in Germany in the 30s. There was a disproportionate number of Jews involved in the Bolshevik movement in Russia, and fascism was, at least in part, a response to the spread of communism. 

So, for the Jews, it was a perfect storm. They were a hated minority that would not fully integrate, and they were, for right or for wrong, associated with the communist movement that much of the western world feared.

The Mexicans in the USA are less of a minority than the Jews were, integrate more (especially after the first generation), and are not associated with a global conspiracy to take down capitalism.

I think they’ll be ok."

bourbon,fcbtl1h,t1_fcblzdf,1577590821.0,"If you can find it, San Matias Extra Anejo is the best tequila I have found  <$50. Otherwise, I like Herradura Reposado, Gran Centenario Anejo (the best tequila for margaritas, hands down), and CasaAmigos Reposado and Anejo. All easy to find under $50. There are a lot of great tequilas around the $100 mark if you wanna splurge."
bourbon,fcbsae6,t1_fcbklx4,1577590408.0,"I think that’s why the prices are so high. There is a limit to agave production. And a geographic limit to what can be legally called tequila. Modestly aged tequilas (2-4 years), aka extra anejos, routinely sell for over $100 a bottle. Compare that to whiskeys."
bourbon,fcbdvgj,t1_fcawwef,1577585658.0,"I have been  a BIG tequila drinker for years. There is definitely a tequila sub-culture, but it’s a complicated spirit with limited availability and high prices. I have definitely seen an increase in interest, and have introduced tequila to many newbies, but I don’t see it gaining much ground. It’s just too complicated and expensive."
