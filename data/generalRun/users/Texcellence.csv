LonghornNation,fenhvmy,t1_fenao6o,1579285032.0,This past decade has taught me that the off-season is the time to drink the kool-aid. It gives our livers a rest for the football season when we inevitably drink copious amounts of alcohol to dull the pain of dashed hopes.
CFB,feezea3,t1_feehjf4,1579044587.0,"Rumor has it that sometime in the 1960s, Peter Wahlstein, a Purdue astrophysics grad student designed a device to measure strange radiation fluctuations emanating from dark matter. The device was such that it would send radio waves into the void of space which would then reflect off of the dark matter to be read in his lab in Indiana.  

At first, the student sent simple blips and beeps into the void, but he received no response. Over the weeks, Peter tuned his array and sent blips and beeps at different frequencies, but still the void remained silent.  

Exasperated after weeks of trying and dejected that his project had failed, Peter spoke into the radio transmitter, “I am Peter Wahlstein, a PhD student at Purdue University. Why aren’t you answering me?!” And then, the void answered.  

Over the device’s speaker a disembodied, staticky voice instructed Peter to tune his machine to a certain frequency and transmit a particular sequence of blips and beeps. Peter did as the void requested, without questioning the void’s motives.  

Late at night, upon transmission of the code, the device’s vacuum tubes glowed brightly and exploded. But, inexplicably, the device kept running. Frightened, Peter picked up the telephone and called his professor to explain what had happened.  

However, Peter never finished his explanation. An unearthly orb of darkness appeared at the center of the lab and from the orb a hypnotic voice beckoned Peter to come closer and touch the orb. Just Peter reached for the orb, the laboratory door flew open and his professor watched horrified as Peter and the orb disappeared before his eyes.  

Years passed and people presumed the professor’s story was nothing but a tall tale meant to frighten students. That is, until a ball of darkness appeared in the middle of a lecture. Students gazed upon the orb as it slowly expanded and at its center they could see a vaguely human shape coming towards them. The students were rightfully terrified and backed away, but nothing could prepare them for the horror that followed.  

For from darkness appeared an image more horrifying than anything yet imagined. A twisted creature, a perverse approximation of the human form emerged with the body of a normal man, but a cruelly misshapen and enlarged head. And the eyes, God the eyes! Black, expressionless pits they were. As black and vacant as the void from whence it came.  

And then the creature spoke. “One here once touched the void, and we have become one. Call me Pete, emissary of the void. You will give me embassy, or the void will envelop this place.”  

And so, from then on, Purdue was represented by a hideous abomination known as Purdue Pete. Silently, Purdue administration has tried to return Pete to the void, but to no avail. For the void has spoken."

funny,feetf2z,t1_feen1ph,1579040823.0,In Houston we use the turn signal to notify other drivers that there is an open space between them and the car in front. We do this as a polite gesture  to allow the other driver to quickly close the gap so that they may arrive at their destination .0397 seconds faster. It is a very efficient system.
