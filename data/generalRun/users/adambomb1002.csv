saskatchewan,ffiixhb,t3_ettb41,1579974968.0,"Honestly, I think the space at this point is better to be rented than to be not rented at all. I don't think there is anyone else chomping at the bit to get that space willing to pay a higher rate.

On the other hand the optics of the situation are just awful for anybody in the SK party to be involved further with that mess."

askscience,ffhjw9i,t1_ffhjtkj,1579938631.0,"Yes, but odds are you would have your lowest chance of surviving it if you contracted it right now, when it is least understood. Chances are slim that it will mutate into something deadlier."
askscience,ffhjbx1,t1_ffhj6oy,1579937862.0,"It's unlikely to mutate all that rapidly, especially in times when it is spreading easily through the population."
askscience,ffhixpo,t1_ffhihy4,1579937338.0,"No. Common flu's have a much lower mortality rate, and are thus not nearly as dangerous as swine flu or coronavirus .

How long you carry a virus without showing recognizable symptoms, and how long it takes to die can certainly have an impact on the spread though."
askscience,ffh55os,t1_ffh0il4,1579923399.0,"So far, no.

At this point the World Health organization does not consider it a global emergency.

2009 Swine flu, 2014 Polio,  2014 Ebola, 2016 Zika virus, 2018–20 Kivu Ebola were all considered global emergencies.

There is of course the potential for coronavirus to mutate, become more lethal and spread. It's location is of particular concern as it is hard to contain in China's urban centers which are tied all over the world. The more it spreads the greater the potential for mutation. This is what makes it quite different than Ebola in rural centers of Africa."

saskatoon,fffud37,t3_etcyet,1579891988.0,">That's why **a high ranking member of the police force is calling for an outright ban on bear spray in the city** in an effort to get it off the streets and out of the hands of criminals.

>""It's common enough that we're running into bear spray weekly,"" said **Supt. Randy Huisman.**

>**At the same time, Huisman said he accepts that a ban would likely have next to no impact on the amount of bear spray police see out on the streets.**

Then why the hell are you calling for a ban on it when you recognize it will have no impact on criminals getting a hold of it?

What is the logic there? Keeping it out of the hands of law abiding citizens?"

movies,fffo9i9,t3_esxzj6,1579888221.0,"I do not agree with Carlin on this when it comes to the ""All the problems in the world"" line. 

The other half of the coin creating the problems in the world can be traced to female nesting instinct which strives for more and more security for their offspring to the point that it is never enough. This makes women seek out the men who have billions of dollars, power, greed and in turn fuels this hyper competitiveness of man. Women are drawn to competition and they will tend to choose those who are the victor's. 

My mom always used to think exactly like Carlin does in this speech when we were growing up, right down to blaming it all on testosterone. It took a long time to realize she was wrong and that we are not the bad guy for the hormones we carry. This is nature and we are one half of the equation."
