At this point he didn't know if it would be covered, so he called Jimmy Johns.

The failure here was the VA not letting him know he could go to the hospital if something went wrong or that they didn't have a good number for the social worker.

He would have 100% been covered for any emergency visit (related to his surgery) at any hospital in the country. Source is I'm a vet with way too much first hand knowledge of the VA.

todayilearned,fcbej4d,t3_egwlvw,1577585888.0,"Ok so this is what happened. It is the same fate King of the Hill had and to a certain extent Family guy. 

The Simpsons aired in 1989 on Sundays. At this time football was not aired on Fox. The ratings were great and it became the anchor for all Sunday comedies on the network.

Que 1994. Fox gets the NFL rights to air Sunday night football. As good as the ratings were for the Simpsons, they would never match football. But they were still good. They aired The Simpsons late enough that it wouldn't get preempted, but the lead in shows might.

Then comes a slew of really good and funny cartoons. King of the Hill in 1997 and Futurama and Family Guy in 1999. All three of these shows were very popular. But they were all 3 leading into the Simpsons. 

Fox tried to move King of the Hill to Thursdays in 1999 which failed miserably and it almost got cancelled. They moved it back to Sundays were it continued to get really good ratings. 

All through this, the lead ins to the Simpsons would sometimes get preempted by football, which was still getting better ratings then any of the cartoons.

So Fox had an impossible decision. Stop airing football, which would be insane, or move the cartoons to another day, which had already proven to be a mistake and might kill their most popular shows. 

They settled on locking in the Simpsons and taking turns of the first cartoon of Sunday which would almost always get preempted. Also based on ratings, which I'd have to look, but Futurama was probably the lowest of the 4 cartoons airing at this time.
