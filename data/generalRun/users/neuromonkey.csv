bestofnetflix,fgklhgq,t1_fgkadof,1580868325.0,"Generating wealth isn't evidence of hard work, nor is a small GDP indicative of laziness.

America occupies a unique position in the world. We are fabulously wealthy, and so are able to live in ways that are inconceivable to most of the rest of the world. We can count on largely uninterrupted power, well maintained infrastructure, relative safety, cheap consumer goods, and a long list of other privileges that we have come to regard as normal, unremarkable l parts of life.

It's difficult to see this without context. From outside of the developed world, America is an absurd, ostentatious concentration of wealth and opportunity. 60% of human beings don't have access to toilets. You know all the plastic stuff we buy for next to nothing? People make that stuff. Real, living human beings, who are paid so little that it's cheaper--far cheaper--to ship materials from the US to them, and then ship finished consumer products back to the US, than it would be to assemble the stuff here.

There are a lot of reasons why there are such massive disparities between America and the rest of the world. To pretend that Americans don't inhabit a very unusual, very privileged place in the world is just being wilfully ignorant.

If you're making $35k or more, you are one of the 1%, globally speaking. You are fabulously wealthy, and free from kinda of fears and worries that you could barely even imagine are real."
MurderedByWords,fgk86uv,t1_fgj3bnr,1580859576.0,"My dad lived for 14 years after his diagnosis. He went through round after round after round of chemo and radiation. He took fistfuls of pills every day, self-injections, and had to have all-day IV infusions once a week, every week. He had surgeries, and tons of treatments for the health problems caused by the various medications. There was periodic nursing care, many, many doctors, nurses, radiologists, imaging techs, transportation, and whole slews of non-medical that being being sick generated. Many of the drugs he took were so highly toxic that they couldn't be handled or transported without special training and precautions.

Just ONE of his meds cost $17k per week. That's more than $12M over the course of treatment. For one drug. Fortunately for him, he'd paid for spectacular health insurance for most of his adult life. Without it, he wouldn't have lived a year. Even with it, it took threats of lawsuit to get many things covered. The endless, constant paperwork, and non-stop trips from A to B to C to D to E for overlapping treatments... just incredible.

I think you may be going a little way on them. The guy who pardoned Libby is even worse than they were. 

> I'm just saying that OPs ""I'm gonna try to get your wife killed"" was an exaggeration.

I disagree. It may have come from Cheney's  truculent rage, but it was also a calculated act meant to shut Joe Wilson up, but it was also a warning to dissuade others from looking to closely at the excuses we used for military acts. Cheney is a shitbag, but he was a cold and calculating shitbag who made careful study of methods of political manipulation. 

> her life was going to be put in danger.

I've never read any evidence that suggested that her life was in imminent danger. There definitely were state actors who knew of some of her activities, and would have liked to see her gone. Some of these people learned that Plame was CIA subsequent to the Novak article. I am certain that the article ended her Inteligence career, and limited her (and her family's) ability to travel due to safety concerns.

Saying that Cheney tried to get her killed may be a bit of an exaggeration, but the damage it did went beyond Plame and her career. It also put a spotlight on people she'd been friendly with in other countries. An exaggeration, maybe, but not inaccurate."
