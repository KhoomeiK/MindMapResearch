> This result stands in great contrast to the previous belief that methylation marks had to be actively and repeatedly renewed. Methylation was thought to be a transient DNA modification that only was carried forward for one or two generations.

This is just simply not true on many levels. This fungus is still actively, repeatedly renewing it's methylation using a maintenance methyltransferase everytime it divides, just like pretty much any other methylating organism does. It's just not modifying it's methylation pattern between cell cycles in the transient style you're referring to with additional methyltransferases. During each division of this fungus some methylation patterns may mistakenly change do to poor copying by it's maintenance methyltransferase, leading to selection opportunities. These same exact kinds of errors can and do occur in any organism that uses maintenance methyltransferase to copy methylation patterns during division, including human cells. It's literally not  new, it's just that in their system which has no secondary, transient methyltransferase activity, there's a more clear picture of how incorrect copying of the template strand methylation pattern can lead to selection opportunities. The major development here is that they have a system to study that so cleanly, not that it's a novel never-before-described ""mode"" of evolution.

Sure. I wanted to see if the commented on this in the paper - they said the capsid proteins are easy to conjugate the nanorods to,  so presumably it was easier to attach the gold to the capsid while leaving the targeting proteins untouched than it was to engineer purified targeting protein with appropriate thiol groups required for the nanorod conjugation? Maybe they didn't even try because there was no need to when whole virus works? 

> As for all the immunogenicity issues you raise, sure, those exist, but they are still orders of magnitude less of an issue than using full phage

We're just going to have to disagree on the certainty of this, no big deal. 

>As for the specificity, obviously you would have to test that, the same you would for the phage.

 Seems like their process in this paper is directly applicable to current phage therapies more so than if it was protein specific.  Most recent phage therapies to treat bacterial infections have been previously uncharacterized,  brand new, never before seen phages that were directly isolated out of sewage and selected for killing of specifically the patient's infectious cultured microbe (like the groups at UCSD are doing) in a matter of days. They don't do any extensive biochemistry or genetics (like cloning genes etc) on them to determine what proteins they are using the target the bacteria etc, and they are only working with phages that can be purified from the start. So in that setting it seems more adaptable to conjugate on to whole phages, since you've never characterized them before, than it is to characterize this brand new phage from scratch (determining, cloning, expressing, and validating the exact targeting protein plus any modifications required for nanorod conjugaiton).  In this process by definition they are only working with phages they can easily isolate so I don't think phage isolation problems are an issue here. Hope that makes sense."

biology,fenbij7,t1_fen1ezu,1579281141.0,"> it is typically easier to produce and harvest proteins than it is phage.

This is just not true for most cases. You can grow and purify bacteriophage *significantly* easier than express, induce and purify a properly folded and functional (and eventually cleaned and suspended in an in vivo-friendly buffer) protein. Phages are remarkably hardy and easy to purify endotoxin free, without worrying about folding, solubility, preservation/stability, and appropriate buffer issues.   The particular protein may also loose activity if not in the context of the whole phage ie could bind to more off-target proteins when solubilized on it's own. 

>It lowers the chance of the phage causing problems from low to 0 

This is true, but solo proteins cause problems too, either in production or in use (solubility, endotoxin removal, allergic reaction, or long term stability issues). In some cases a protein can be more immunogenic if injected on it's own than in the context of an entire phage.  I seems counter intuitive that a whole phage, with many proteins, would be less immunogenic than a single protein, but often you're more likely to get allergic reaction if you inject a single protein than if that single protein is diluted and/or covered by the context of other proteins in the structural phage.  It's part of the reason why we don't make antibodies against critical viral proteins that would offer us protection - because in the context of the whole virus it's difficult for the immune system to access them compared to if they were free-floating soluble proteins.

>The advantage of the phage is that you combine the targeting with killing and self-replication, if you take out the latter two your advantage to using phage in the first place is essentially gone.

Similar to my first point, it is actually easier to produce phage than it is to purify protein so they're just using whole phages as a proxy for purified protein. It is also possible the purified protein only targets bacteria specifically if in the context of the phage structure. Yes they lose the advantage of self-replication but that doesn't remove the advantage or easy preparation or possible activity issues that are lost when removed from the phage structure.

I'm not saying using a purified protein isn't a good idea! It's just that in some cases there are advantages to using whole phage."

Seems like ""waste thirst billions on tests"" is still better than $7.5 trillion lost - seems favorable to me?

There would be a few trillion left over to help support that - similarly to how we decided the costs of lead exposure were worth incurring huge loses to force major industries to remove lead from their products for the sake of future economic growth - supporting development of safe alternatives seems reasonable given the opportunity costs.

Not to be super nitpicky, but we do this for tons of things. Insulin and antibodies are in everyone's blood for instance and we test those routinely. Just because it is in everybody does not mean it's not worth testing - we test for the people who have unusually high or low levels of something that's routinely in blood all the time.

No, the options are to continue to use our flame retardants, but monitor pregnant mothers and young children for their blood circulating levels of these to be sure they're not in the top percentiles of exposure, and if they are, to offer interventions (education on maintaining the home to minimize exposure, perhaps subsidies to replace carpet with hard flooring etc) to minimize the damage to children.

We moved states mid-pregnancy (newer house with less metal worries) and asked our new doctor the same thing, who gave us the same answer, but suggested we could contact ""outside labs"" if we were very concerned and wanted a blood test.

It is strange to read these reports of the dire consequences of these exposures while also not seeing these concerns in the clinic. Shouldn't we be offering preventative blood screenings?  Yes it is expensive but the authors of these kind of report always suggest the long run costs to the country are more severe than even the costs of regulating the chemicals themselves.  I know there's a risk-reward trade off in screening for these things, but it doesn't quite make sense to me. This report is talking about chemicals that are in basic home goods, like carpets and mattresses, which you can't wave your hands at like we do with ""don't eat paint chips"", so shouldn't we test for them? The response is:

>""Frequently opening windows to let persistent chemicals found in furniture, electronics, and carpeting escape, and eating certified organic produce can reduce exposure to these toxins,"" says Trasande, who also serves as chief of environmental pediatrics in the Department of Pediatrics at NYU Langone.

Is this *really* the answer? Is there a correlation with people who don't open their windows regularly and children with intellectual disorders? 

To be clear I'm not some eco freak or hypochondriac, but as a scientist I'm knowledgeable enough about the literature to know it's something I should be concerned about it in a real way, but I'm not seeing that reflected in the clinic."

politics,feh257v,t1_fegy6l7,1579107566.0,">There is an article written by one of the attendees that goes into it in detail. Basically it was just a campaign event for the middle and upper middle class demographic

I just looked up the attendees account because I wasn't aware of it - thanks! I bring the same skepticism to this account of a Pete fundraiser attendee supporting Pete that I would a Trump supporter defending Trump.  Someone with over a million dollar net worth defending the person they showed up to a fundraiser for and telling us there was no big money involved. If you replaced Pete's name with Trumps we'd all be just as skeptical of this account. I think if Pete was more explicit and consistent about rejecting big money it would be easier to believe both him and this account.  But on to Warren's part in this...



> Warren's mischaracterization was Republican-level misrepresentation and demagoguery.

Yes it seems Warren definitely got the price of the wine wrong (over $100 but not $900) which I knock her for exaggerating when $200 is just as bad as $900 imho, so we could call that a lie, and Warren has absolutely used similar fundraisers in the past so she shouldn't really be pointing fingers. Seeing this new ""evidence"" of Warren's mischaracterization of the event does makes me think less of her.

Overall I think Pete's own words about big money have been more damaging than Warren's mischaracterization, but either way it's disappointing."

AskReddit,fegwcqj,t3_ep206k,1579104000.0,"Generally men find woman identifying with male characters to be endearing - however also, consciously or not, are capable of shaming other men for identifying with female characters.  Yes there are dudes who just want to have sex with a cartoon character, but there is also some serious cultural issues about pressuring men to not empathize with or identifying with female characters in pop culture.

If some dude identifies with Sailor Moon at the same intensity some dude identifies with Luke Skywalker, it sucks that the default stance is that this requires explicit defensing explanation."
