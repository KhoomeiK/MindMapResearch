I do see myself in mathemathics and physics (not sure what specifically yet). Every time I hang out with friends or do something fun, I get bombarded with these small thoughts like ""this is kinda absurd, what youre doing"", ""this wont change anything"" or so,which I usually ignore but keep in mind. Ik, sounds cringeworthy now, but thats how it is. 

As I said, I ignore these thoughts. I know that what I am doing is meaningless, everything is arbitrary and random (according to me). I feel as if I am ignoring the way I should go about the life - like Im ignoring my default way of feeling and experiencing everything. I dont even know how to feel most of the times. I just dont. What you said - Im forcing myself to be small minded.

For some time, I was afraid of death and not being around. Then I started having trouble sleeping. Obviously, this influenced my life a bit. Thats was about the time when I started concluding some things myself. I have had started talking to people about it, hearing their thoughts and preferably, an advice. What I found out was that ¾ of them were also scared of death. The remaining ¼ I felt as if was faking bravery. No one came up with a good advice. Then, while trying to fall asleep, I started wondering what it would be like to die from the anatomical standpoint. For example: if I was shot in the head, thatd be it. I wouldn't even know I died. The last moment I was concius of the surroundings was before that bullet hit my head. And then, bam, nothing. And I am not aware of that nothing cuz I cant think. Alright. What if I was to slowly bleed out. Well, my blood pressure would drop significantly so I would pass out. Again, not aware of it. Here I saw the similarity of death and sleeping (Ill let you give the analogy a whirl yourself without myself explaining it, in case you havent heard of it). I bet it was something I heard before, but it was mine to me, and I still use it to this day. 

What Im trying to say is, I dont see people living as if they are aware of their time alive, even though death is one of the most important things in our lives and it will be something we will be remembered for. So, I dont know if people do what we do and try to not be aware of the insignificance we call our lives or are ignorant as default. ¾ of them seem to be ignorant.

\-Taken with a Skywatcher reflector telescope (150 aperture and 750mm focal length) from my backyard.

\-EQ3 mount with added dual-axis motors

\-No auto-guiding whatsoever, just the telescope and my old unmodified Canon 1300D camera that had some damage done to its sensor beforehand

\-No filters were used

\-I can't expose for more than 30 seconds on my camera I took:

\~150x30""@ISO800 (50 bias frames, 40 darks, and no flats)

\~200x30""@ISO1600 (50 bias frames, 30 darks, and 50 flats)

Total integrated exposure time= 3 hours

Unfortunately, my lack of equipment forces me to stand right next to the telescope at them freezing temperatures and press the shutter button on the camera every few minutes.  

The photos were quickly edited in 5 mins on Affinity photo, just dragged some levels sliders and tried to subtract the present light pollution with subtraction mode on layers. I will come back to the photo soon, but now I don't have the time.
