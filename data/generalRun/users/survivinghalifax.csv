depression,fcjyirb,t1_fcjw4id,1577710582.0,"so what would the proper treatment be for a depressed dog in a dog shelter? drugs? No the dog needs a change n environment, it is a pack animal living in a small kennel without its needs met in a loud, stressfull and changing environment. The dog cannot relax. It doesnt have a home, a pack, a purpose (scent work, training).  Stops eating, gets sick, loses weight, starts with strange coping behaviours, zones out goes blank, gives up hope.

A siamese cat in a cattery for many months will stop eating, will get cat flu, digestive problems, give up crying for attention. this breed is very social and needs companionship. This is depression in animals, drugs arnt the answer. we need to look deeper. If you see cases in animals first hand it makes you realise that depression is what we have done to ourselves. imo ;)"
depression,fcjuvnu,t1_fcgbx9g,1577705901.0,"yes, nail on head. whats sad is people dont realise it but their subconscious and their bodies do and depression is the reaction."
depression,fcjustp,t1_fch7luo,1577705793.0,depression is a disease OF society. imo
depression,fcjuqw2,t1_fcii8xi,1577705717.0,"not at all a dumb thing to say, not all of us feel like we have a disease, where did you catch your 'disease' then lol. some ppl think there is more to it than that. have you spoken to every person in this world with depression?"
depression,fcjuksi,t1_fcidk7h,1577705478.0,interesting point about the normal coping mechanisms of humans. Im still not sold on it being a 'disease' tho
depression,fcjui6z,t1_fcfks43,1577705373.0,and i agree with you. this world pushes us into the most unnatutral living and we are surprised when our brains react like this?
depression,fcjue97,t1_fcjrk4p,1577705216.0,"depression will cause changes in the brain as you say, however in my experience its the environmental factors that occur first. some people are definitely more predisposed to it. I am sceptical of professionals trying to label it a disease so they can administer drugs. I dont feel like I caught some disease. Its a disease of modern living."

depression,fcju4ha,t1_fcgryrk,1577704822.0,"i dont think that they are saying that at all. I think that they mean that people can experience depression as a response to living in an incredibly unnatural world. high stress, loneliness, lack of purpose in life, this causes depression, if it causes the same symptoms, then its depression. whether its subconsious or not."
depression,fcjtwlf,t3_eh6aac,1577704510.0,"I think that you are pretty much right. Depression in my opinion is all down to unnatural living. I very much doubt that when we were living in ancient times in tribes that depression was an issue, with family surrounding us and close friends, each with a purpose in life, with skills to survive, working as a team, eating natural foods in nature. 

Evolution is our downfall, today our lives are so  unnatural to how we started out. As humans we can adapt but only so much, depression is a realisation that something isnt right, our needs are not being met. People may not realise that that is the reason but they can feel that something isnt right, and its isnt!

Animals will also experience depression from lack of social interaction or the wrong environment to express behaviours. The key is to find the little things that make us feel more human whatever that is, everyone will be different and the depression may still remain but we can help alleviate it and find some solace. 

for those saying it is a disease, yes, but a disease of civilisation. weve fucked ourselves. lol gotta laugh really."
