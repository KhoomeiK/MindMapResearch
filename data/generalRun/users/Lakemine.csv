But then again we have to define the word. Also harassment is not rape. Also asking questions to see where the boundaries are with each woman is not harassment.

And what if a lot of other people walk that same path and keep telling you (or yelling in some cases) to walk it as well, but it’s washed out for you? And then when you keep looking for a different path, those same people are still telling you to do the same path that failed for you but not them, what then?

Is it wrong to limit risk? Obviously can’t eliminate it, but is it wrong to think/ponder/question before moving forward or running headlong into unnecessary failures, hurt and pain?"

And yes, multiple times, but guess what? Requires money and no longer on insurance.

Also another issue, can’t swallow pills, have to take liquid or gummy meds, but because the processes to convert the medication they say they wanted to try are rare and expensive, it’s $300 bucks for one bottle, and that was WITH insurance, it’s more now.

That’s why I’m trying to get a job, because as soon as I have insurance, that’s the first thing on the list is medicine, second is teeth since I havnt been able to go to the dentist in 5+ years (insurance again).

If it means better quality because less people working on it/melding in it, then yes. Iâ€™m fine with a franchise not being mainstream. More money and more people doesnâ€™t automatically mean itâ€™s better. 

LucusArts was shut almost immediately when Disney bought them, and then handed it to EA which....hasnâ€™t had the best track record atm. (Not just with Star Wars games but just in general.)

They can still make new material, was happening before Disney bought it. Kenobi was great and came out right before the purchase.

Also, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s in great hands. There are certainly a few that are good story tellers, but alas they are few. The other ones Iâ€™m just.....concerned, especially with different things they say that donâ€™t pertain to Star Wars or storytelling.

Me just like Lyn. ðŸ˜Š"
StarWars,fes17f2,t1_ferpbze,1579360379.0,"I will also agree on that.

In fact, when the first trailer was released I was hyped. But when the second trailer was released, my enthusiasm diminished. Maybe Iâ€™m just old fashioned or a sap, but I didnâ€™t want a â€œEmpire ONLY killing Rebelsâ€ storyline. So I wasnâ€™t going to pre order it (even though I was alpha and beta testing it). But then they released the clip of Iden taking to her father and the Sidious droid, and the look she gave right at the end sparked hope. Hope that the storyline JUST might not be what people think it would be. So pre ordered it, bought the book and read the book in the 3 days leading up to its launch. And was playing through it and BOOM, I was right. And I liked it.

Now mind you, that doesnâ€™t mean it discards the pacing or the shortness. Even though I basically knew of her turning traitor, because of hints here and there, they should have spent a little bit more time showing her turning. But then again, sometimes people make snap choices. 

Also even though I like it, that is a issue with A LOT of the storylines from 2013+, is that they tell the whole storyline over multiple forms of media and if people only watch/read one piece of media, it feels like â€œsnap out of characterâ€ choices, when itâ€™s not, itâ€™s that their character was changing in other media. Which like I said I like, but I know Iâ€™m in a minority.

Also (this is a rumor and I have not confirmed this) the rumor is, that they were going with a heavy Imperial storyline that would continue and connect to EP7-8, but when they tested it on audiences, they disliked it. So they changed it for a rebel storyline, and it became favorable.

Thatâ€™s only a rumor and I have never been able to confirm it, but it makes sense with the timeline of the trailers. (There are frames, images and voice lines in the first trailer that are never used in the game. Just like the first trailer for Rogue One.)"
StarWars,ferodgz,t1_fernjdt,1579356466.0,"True. But the counter point I was stating, is franchises donâ€™t â€œneedâ€ movies to succeed, survive and have a fan base.

Not saying we canâ€™t or shouldnâ€™t get new movies, just saying the viewpoint of â€œWe werenâ€™t getting anything.â€ (Because no movies) is flawed is all."
StarWars,fernysw,t3_eqehxi,1579356314.0,"IMO, Disney should just double dip and get profits from both ends.

Let new fans be happy with Canon, and still produce â€œLegendsâ€ material and continue the storylines that were left off. Mark them clearly (like they already do with the old books they are reselling) and BOOM. Both sides of the fandom are happy and Disney is making money.

StarWars,fdcngam,t1_fdcm9p5,1578279269.0,Ahh ok. ðŸ‘ðŸ»
StarWars,fdce0i7,t1_fdc7plp,1578272594.0,"1. Correct. There are many female lead storylines that donâ€™t push a agenda. Also Iâ€™m not saying 100% there is one with Star Wars. Iâ€™m just also saying itâ€™s not 100% NOT happening, because of not only storyline plot threads plus them leaving writing and struggles to books and comics instead of writing better for the movies. And also we have to take into account what some of the current leaders at Lucusflim have said in regards to that mindset. Iâ€™m not fully on board with it, but it canâ€™t be just blatantly disregarded just because itâ€™s something that is uncomfortable.

2. Correct again. I never said people didnâ€™t like any of the new content, myself included. There are many things they have come out with since 2013 that I personally have liked (disregarding other people for the moment) Rebels, Hera and Kanan, A New Dawn, Lost Stars, Bloodlines, either of the Darth Vader comics, Dark Disciple, Ahsoka, Battkefront 2 and Iden, (and both Battlefront books) Poe, Mr Bones. If you want to include SWTOR as well, World between Worlds, Rogue One, Jyn, Lyra and Galan Erso, Catalyst, anything with Thrawn, some other comics here and there and The Mandalorian and Fallen Order (even though I hated it for the first week.)

But there are many other things I have either disliked or just went meh about. The Forces of Destiny were meh. A lot of the kid tie in books for everything were meh. (Though I liked the Adventures in Wild space because of that call out to the comic lol) Lukeâ€™s first kiss was sad though. Havnt seen Resistance so canâ€™t comment on that. Even though I have liked TFA and TROS, and liked TLJ when it first came out, sadly I can not they are good because of poor writing. I like Rey and even Rose, (but not because of the movies) but when you leave most of their character development to books and comics instead of in the actual movies she is in, it weakens her character on screen and does a disservice to their characters. Plus a lot of people who only see the movies (such as yourself) are not able to enjoy just how deep or damaged the characters are and how they fight and triumph over those hurts and pains. Same with most other characters introduced in either of the 3 movies. LL-3 might have been a bit heavy handed for some people, but I was fine with her because droids in SWTOR do it all the time. Also EA doing bare bones with their game development to rush them out the door ASAP for money and greed weakens a potentially good game.

3. Maybe. This is subjective because a franchise doesnâ€™t need movies to be successful (looking at you Pokemon) and I have been a Star Wars fan since I was 6. There were many games, books and comics from 2005-2013, (I can list out all the ones I know if you want) some of which were very much anticipated (1313 we miss you) but were scraped because of Disney buying Star Wars. Also many games, books and comic storylines were just left hanging (SWTOR being the only exception) because they were canceled. Which is very sad. Clone Wars just being the biggest of them.

4. Yes and no. Correct in that almost ANY piece of media is designed to make money, and making money is not inherited wrong. But when greed takes over, the product is weakened. (Ie: Star Wars games as a comparison.) Or if a agenda takes over it weakens the storyline and characters it took over. (Any of the CW DC shows and most (not all) of the female lead action movies recently.)

EDIT: Forgot to add Cassian to the liked section (I really like his character and his interactions with K2S0) and add some of the comics to the meh or disliked section. (Allegiance specifically.)"
StarWars,fdby2nl,t1_fdbp99c,1578263638.0,"While there is some good and I like myself (books, games and comics mainly) sadly the movies have either been lacking or leaving storytelling to books. Which, while I will admit I do not dislike that (I like reading things to explain hidden or expand on other media), is sad and disheartens me. Plus even though I can argue against the idea of â€œThe leaders and executives at Disney are pushing a agenda!â€, sadly that hypothesis does have some merit. And sadly when you start with a agenda and try to fit a storyline around it, the story suffers. Writing for new characters is fine but writing for established characters should be VERY easy since you study what they have gone through, the choices they make and write how they would react in a new situation. And in the books and comics, and even the games, that has largely been true. But not so in the movies recently. 

Maybe with the Mandalorian and hopefully Clone Wars showing you donâ€™t need a agenda to sell a story, just good characters and a good impactful or emotional storyline, we can get a good Old Republic movie/tv show. 

But if the current leaders are still in charge, I fear they will mess it up. Which.....just might make even more people upset then what has previously had been done because they will be messing with the video game genre now. And gamers are notorious for poking out mistakes or flaws.

EDIT: When the goal is to push a agenda or greed, and no longer to tell a good compelling storyline, the story and characters suffer. In all media (movies, tv shows, comics, books, music, video games and manga.) not just Star Wars.

EDIT: Also to head it off. There is nothing wrong with having a message in a piece of content or media. Literally EVERY piece of media has a message. But there is a difference between having a message to say and shoving a agenda in front of people. Also just having a message to say, does not cover up weak writing. Doesnâ€™t matter what end of the spectrum the message is coming from. Weak writing + weak characters = flawed or weak content."
StarWars,fdaulo5,t1_fdatx3z,1578250386.0,"Fair enough. Iâ€™m glad there is enough media for different people to like different things. Sorry if I came across as confrontational, itâ€™s my head.

Anyways, be safe and May the Force be with you."
FireEmblemHeroes,fdatpe0,t1_fdapdcy,1578250018.0,"Yes and no. When the base character doesnâ€™t get one shot and yet with +1 or +3 stat gets killed instantly, thatâ€™s not strategy. Thatâ€™s taking the rules you learned and flipping them out the window. Thatâ€™s a fail design. If something is stronger it should be easier, not harder or flat out impossible to complete a objective.

Also if the â€œmust have all 4 surviveâ€ rule wasnâ€™t there, I wouldnâ€™t have a issue as I can clear most of the harder maps and lose 1 or 2 characters and still win.

Also I have asked many many many times to other players for help, linked all my characters I have. The only advice I get it â€œshut up and leaveâ€ or do horse emblem, flyer emblem or a tank with 3 dancers. Which helped me clear a few more maps then I did before but still canâ€™t even clear 1 abyssal map. (Iâ€™m still stuck on tier 15 on the basic training.) I canâ€™t even beat the â€œeasiestâ€ abyssal map Navarre. I have timed it before, spent 6-8 hours banging my head at them. Changing characters around, different set ups, different S seals, different pair ups. Still failure after failure after failure. Now yes I havnt tried to work at it for 6 hours in the past few months but thatâ€™s because after trying it for so long, isnâ€™t that the definition of insanity? Trying the same thing over and over and expecting a different result? So I have tried new things, still doesnâ€™t work. And I donâ€™t have the characters for most of the f2p guides.

Interesting to think about though to only focus on the movies and never any other media connected with it. Like what about if people only think The Lord of the Rings movies are the only lore or what about the Harry Potter movies and discard everything else?

I understand your starting point and I am sorry for not rereading your statement more and slightly taking it out of context. But should we just discard everything outside of movies?

FireEmblemHeroes,fdacalw,t1_fda3g1e,1578244489.0,Wish the devs didnâ€™t design it so stupid and illogically that merging a character and making them stronger means your locked out of content because the devs never said â€œHEY DONâ€™T MAKE YOUR CHARACTERS STRONGER!!!â€
FireEmblemHeroes,fd9qvi6,t3_ek7pza,1578236893.0,I want less alts for other characters and more alts for Lyn. ðŸ˜

StarWars,fd9ocyg,t1_fd7rns0,1578235977.0,Same. And the theater I saw it in the speakers were a bit broken so the booms were louder and shaking the seats. Man that movie was SO GOOD as a kid. 2nd front row btw. ðŸ¤˜ðŸ»

CatastrophicFailure,fc96yj2,t1_fc7jc3k,1577548013.0,"Agreed. The penalties need to be severe to deter them from driving fast and recklessly. Growing up in a firefighter family, fires are not the most scary call to get but highway calls, and they get them more often. Seen too many familyâ€™s lose a dad/mom, husband/wife or brother/sister, due to side of highway crashes/run overs/back ends. It needs to stop and those idiots need to have their licenses revoked or a heavy payment to make them think before they kill someone."
