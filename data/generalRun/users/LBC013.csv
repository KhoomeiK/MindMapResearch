blop,fcbnfta,t1_fcbmmht,1577588861.0,"Heâ€™s on daily vitamins that seem to help! His toenails still arenâ€™t right, so we cut them down at the vet about every 2 weeks to keep them from getting caught on anything and betting pulled out."

blop,fcb6168,t1_fcb0ott,1577582823.0,He had a toe nail auto immune disease and we had to have all of his toe nails removed (not permanently). Now we keep them super short and heâ€™s fine... and still blops but on less drugs :)
