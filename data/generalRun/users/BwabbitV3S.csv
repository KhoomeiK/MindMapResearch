dogs,ffmz3bk,t1_fflfg5n,1580060358.0,Extreme isolation distress or separation anxiety is not normal or something everyone should be expected to be able to deal with. With how bad it is it is something I personally believe should be dealt with before offering the dog up for adoption by the shelter just as much as starvation would be. Think about the level of anxiety and panic it would take you to scratch at a door until your finger bleed or scream until horse to get an idea of the level of stress this dog has. It is pure trauma and torture for this dog to be alone. It is not at all unreasonable to be unable to completely rearange your entire life to revole around never leaving a dog alone for even a minute while training for months on end. Cause that is what this level of behaviour needs to keep from regressing and becoming worse. It will take months of work to see improvement and that improvement can be in tiny amounts and subject to regression.
dogs,ffmuh7v,t3_eu9ca6,1580059065.0,Dogs tend to do really well without vision/eyes as smell is such a large part of how they interact with the world. If they are already going blind then the adjustment tends to not be as bad for them. There are things you can do to help them but most adapt pretty well after losing their vision. Keeping furnature in the same place so they can learn the layout for instance. They also make [bumper collars](https://glamorousdogs.com/collections/best-selling/products/blind-dog-bumper-collars/) to help dogs gain confidence moving around and learning to avoid things.
52weeksofbaking,ffj67oz,t1_ffivtjh,1579991424.0,"I am in the same boat and have been really careful in choosing smaller batch recipes for this week. Still trying to choose exactly what I want to make, but do know it will be salted caramel or involve bacon.

This pancake recipe is really tempting. [Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate Pancakes](https://thecookiewriter.com/salted-caramel-hot-chocolate-pancakes/)"
Dogtraining,ffj37pe,t3_etffq4,1579989247.0,I find my tone of voice can have a huge influence on my dogs behaviour. How I use it can really help with his training depending on the situation. When he is excited or overwhelmed I use my softer calm voice. Get really close to him and body block his view to help him refocus. It helps keep him from feeding off it and getting more hyped up. A excited cheery voice when he is unsure or I am looking for more energy. Loose open body language and exaggerated happy praise. It helps him gain confidence and feel more at ease about things. I sparingly use a sharp strict voice on him. I have only used it a couple times when something really dangerous was happening. The time he ran out into the garage when someone was pulling their car for instance. It stopped him in his tracts because he never hears me use that tone. I made sure to follow it up with happy praise with him to keep it from being scary for him.
dogs,ffiy585,t3_ettecm,1579985591.0,They look like a pretty heavily mixed breed dog to me. Reminds me of the dogs that are multi generation mixed breeds that have 5+ breeds mixed into them over ones that are just a couple breeds. My only guess would be some sort of spaniel mix because of the feathering. Even that is iffy as feathering can turn up on dogs that are a mix between a short coat and long coat breeds.
dogs,ffii02u,t1_ffhw9j0,1579974331.0,You also need to remember that for every person that brings home a dog that does not fit they taint the reputation of rescues greatly. I know lots of people that second guess getting a rescue dog after hearing the horror stories and struggles of fluffy language that hide real problems with the dogs they got from a rescue.
dogs,ffigby5,t1_fffrpfh,1579973200.0,"There is this one tiny toy poodle near my house that rarely slips past the owners while they work on stuff in their garage with the garage door open. They are normally really good about keeping her leashed and safe but still leave both door into the house and the garage door open. I am really lucky that the tiny dog is friendly but man she comes charging out barking like mad right up until super close before turning into a wiggly happy dog to excited say hi to the other dog. My dog of course loves this tiny happy dog and does not mind the weird charge towards him, but I hate to think of her doing this to a less tolerant dog. She is so small that even my small dog could hurt her on accident."
dogs,ffifqk7,t3_etd5f7,1579972794.0,"I had a close call with an off leash dog recently. The big shepherd/lab mix came charging towards us as the owner ineffectivly shouting at him. I squared up towards the dog and gave a loud harsh 'hey' at the dog. It skidded to a stop, I repeated the harsh snapped out 'hey' louder while pointing behind the dog. The dog turned around and finally seemed to realize that their owner was calling. I waited until the dog was gone before turning around and continuing my walk. 

This is the first half of my plan for charging off leash dogs. I also carry pepper spray made for use on dogs which is part two if the dog had continued his charge."
dogs,ffh66r6,t1_ffg751o,1579924213.0,I spotted one where I live near my house not too long ago. It is one of the reasons I carry pepper spray with me when walking my dog. I live in a semi suburban area that backs onto both farmland and high density. It was early evening and walking along a very popular dog walking pathway in a green space near an elementary school. You often see people with their dogs walking that path at the same time along with bikers and joggers.
dogs,ffh3ugk,t1_ffgu7de,1579922376.0,Totally. It feels like they are trying to hide and lie about the dogs true behaviour until last minute. Waiting until people have gotten emotionally invested/attached before dropping the bombshell on them is pretty manipulative.
dogs,ffg690z,t1_ffg5ar5,1579899349.0,It does kind of suck but the slander towards the store could not be ignored by them.
dogs,ffg2fsk,t1_ffg1yt3,1579897005.0,"Yeah thats the reason why I suspect BYB myself. Pretty much any time an obvious purebred is in a shelter is because of bad breeders or really irresponsible people not bothering to return the dog. Add in the wonky hip has me suspicious of poor breeding.

Edit. I like the leaner more athletic working line shepherds also. A lot nicer to me than the chunker show line dogs I tend to see."

dogs,fffx6ht,t1_ffcr5nk,1579893756.0,"I agree so much with this. I have dog and cat allergies that vary quite a bit. The dog allergies has gotten way better to the point I have a poodle. My cat allergies though are crazy and vary between cats to the point I have no idea how bad I will reacts. Sometimes I step foot into a house that has been cleaned really well and the cat put away in another room and have to step back outside and can't go in it is that bad. Other times I can sit in the clean house with the cat put away for an hour or two before having to leave. Rarely I can even pet the cat a few times. Sometimes I have to pull up shot of during a so nice to see you hug because I can feel myself starting to react to the cat hair on their clothes. Always I have to after getting a reaction spend the next couple hours recovering from it and cleaning what I wore really well. It sucks so much. 

I could not imagine living full time in a house with an animal my allergies react badly to it would be torture. I tried it once when visiting family and woke up in the middle of the night unable to breath because my meds wore off early. For me exposure that time to the allergens in the house got worse with exposure despite midigating factors."
dogs,fffvty6,t3_esz9oc,1579892907.0,"Does he sleep in it at all? If not he may just not like really plush beds to sleep in. Did he nap on pillows or other deep plush surfaces or more of a carpet and blanket sleeper. 

I know my dog prefers thinner pad style beds over deep pillow style beds."
dogs,fffuwwd,t3_et3f8t,1579892330.0,I would be honest and polite with her about how you feel now is not the best time to add another dog to your life. Tell her that you are honoured that she feels you are a good fit for a show prospect puppy. Except that at this moment your life has a lot going on that does not make it a good time to add another dog. That with a baby on the way you don't feel you will have enough time for puppy also.
dogs,ffftj10,t3_et9i9a,1579891473.0,"Check out r/rawpetfood. I would talk to a vet about designing the right diet for your dog. Raw diets especially home made one can be tricky to balance. Make sure your monitor them really well with your vet as you go. 

I had a picky dog on that was a bit skinnier than I would like before switching to raw. I found that he did not get bored with his raw diet unlike kibble, wet, or dehydrated diets."
dogs,fffs6n8,t1_fffl2ek,1579890639.0,Oh yeah I have a tiny bit of a pushy dog. Not much but just enough to get someone in trouble if they tend to give in or are inconsistant. The breeder warned us that he was the kind of puppy if you give them an inch they will go a mile.
dogs,fffranr,t1_fffmsbz,1579890089.0,"I agree she looks like a full german shepherd, likely a byb, enough I would be surprised if she was a mix."
Dogtraining,ffcv1kg,t3_eslbg7,1579807840.0,I heard an idea of it being due to right handed bias. It really made sense to me as a reasonable explanation for it over the left side. Most people are right handed so having the leash in the left makes it easier to use your dominant hand for other things. The trainer that mention it was because they notice people that are left handed tend to have their dog on the right if not doing or used to formal dog training.
Dogtraining,ffctdu2,t3_esxabj,1579806870.0,"Talk to your vet first. Weight gain or lack of weight loss despite controlled diet can be a sign of health problems like thyroid issues.  A fat dog lives a shorter life, it ages their body faster, and can cause excess wear and tear of their joints. They can help you figure out the weight they should be and how much to cut down on calories to reach it. 

Second you really need to control how much they eat. If you can't control calorie intake then you will never get them to lose weight. Just like with people you can't lose weight if you are getting more calorie than you burn. [This is a great example of what control of diet can do if followed and when it is not.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIOmOzlepLc) Dog proof the kitchen and food storage areas to prevent food stealing. Use baby gates if needed to keep them out of the kitchen. Tuck garbage cans out of the way where the dog can't reach, switch to covered ones they can't open, or keep them in a dog proof room without them when you can't supervise them. If they are counter surfers keep food off the counters any time the dog is allowed in the kitchen. You may want to muzzle train them if they are a vacuum on walks to the point you don't have a chance to stop them eating things.  

You may want to switch to a lower calorie diet food so they can get the same volume of food with less calorie. Feed meals in separate rooms to prevent stealing during meal times. Switch to weighing portions of food instead of scooping to make sure you are not being more generous than you think. Feed from slow food bowls, treat dispensing toys, kongs, or snuffle mats. It can really help dogs feel more satisfied if it takes them longer to eat their food despite getting the same amount. Switch to lower calorie treats and remember to take into account the added calories they are and reduce meals to prevent over feeding through treats."
dogs,ffcq05f,t3_esg7kf,1579804786.0,After bath zoomies are pretty common. I think it is because they have to exert a lot of self control during the bathing process and some dogs find it stressful. Once it is done they have pent up energy and it can explode in a flurry of movement. Sort of like how a bunch of kids can be super polite and well behaved right up to the recess bell going off when they burst out in excitement and run off.
dogs,ffcovwg,t3_esmbwk,1579804064.0,"One of the big things I love about having gone with a good breeder is because my breed of choice, poodle, have high grooming needs. Having a dogs breed by a responsible breeder that comes from titled parents means that they had to be able to be groomed to show standards. They and their parents before them were good for grooming, had a coat that fit the standard, and were tolerant of the dog show atmosphere. It meant that I got to start from a favorable position when he was a baby to get him to accept grooming. He was introduced to the salon environment as a tiny baby still at the breeders and it really showed. I had a lot of work to keep him tolerant of grooming but it was not an uphill battle. I have meet others that did not get that start and it is stressful on both them and the dog to accept something needed to keep them healthy."

dogs,ffcjpqg,t3_esv0qz,1579800917.0,"Your dog won't be sad or depressed about not having his testicles anymore. One of the great things about dogs is they don't get the emotional hang ups humans have about surgery be it a neuter or amputation. Living so much in the moment they recover really well and just accept things as a new normal. They may act a bit odd while coming off the anesthetic from surgery for a day or two but that is normal. 

Timing depending on your dogs breed is something you should look into. For large breeds it is best to wait until 12-18 months when growth plates close. Smaller breed you can get away with earlier if you want as they are less prone to the orthopedic issues early neuter/spay can cause. If your breed is prone to joint issues or a giant breed you may want to even talk about getting x rays done to determine if the growth plates are closed before neutering if going closer to 12 months old. This is a [great article](https://www.parsemus.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/kustritz_optimal_age_gonadectomy.pdf) about figuring out timing that works for you specific dog."

dogs,ff7t95p,t1_ff7sshs,1579657807.0,With how they described their dog as having very long fur and being a poodle mix it does not sound like a border collie coat. With the groomer suggesting they do a haircut also made me lean towards getting it trimmed to a length they can care for easier. Better to trim it now to a shorter length then have to get it shaved due to matting.
dogs,ff7rsfj,t1_ff7ejck,1579656794.0,Their coat only helps so much in keeping warm and a jacket is much better if you are worried about a puppy getting cold. It is better to have it cut to a manageable length and give them a jacket than keep it and struggle with upkeep.
Dogtraining,ff7reb1,t3_ernmy8,1579656522.0,Have you tried those sprays they make to attract puppies to pee on potty pads? I have also heard of them making stakes/posts that do a similar thing. I would try to set up a new potty routine and being her to the same spot each time to go before or at the beginning of the walk. You may just need to stand their with a book and wait for a couple hours.
Dogtraining,ff7pyr1,t3_es1mqv,1579655519.0,Could be the stress of you being away is what caused him to act that way. If he is used to the place for daycare and going home at the end of the day then not going home could be stressful to him causing him to be more likely to act out. I would stick to having him boarded as a 1 on 1 instead of group because of his past behaviour.
Dogtraining,ff7pepm,t3_es2sfz,1579655125.0,"I would get a towel damp with warm water and try to get her to touch it with her feet. Laying it down on the ground in a bathroom would be my suggestion. Roll a ball, toy, or treats onto it to lure her over to it. Then reward her each time she touches it with her paw even it it is just for a second."
dogs,ff7oklo,t3_es2lpv,1579654540.0,"Honestly with dogs who need haircuts the sooner the better. My poodle when he was a puppy had his first full haircut at 4 months old and had been getting trimmed since 6 weeks old with the breeder. Clippers and scissoring can take a lot of work to get older dogs to accept if they are not used to it. 

Coat change for poodles does not happen until around a 8 months to a year old. It can take months for it to fully transition. My pup took nearly 6 months before he fully transitioned to an adult coat."
dogs,ff78wsc,t1_ff6zfo4,1579643444.0,It has been a lot of work to get him to where he is not. I also make sure to add in reinforcement to maintain a good reward history for it. Sometimes he only gets a few treats for spots he normally does not like and other times he only gets a couple when we finish grooming. Rarely I throw in a super rewarding grooming session when I am treating nearly every other minute for his good behaviour.
dogs,ff6tbt6,t1_ff53koe,1579634455.0,"Grooming is my thing too, as I also have a mini poodle. I get constant complements by vets and groomers about how good he is for handling. He is a bit of a grumbler for having his legs brushed sometimes but they say it is normal grumbling not I want to bite you grumbles."
dogs,ff6hvze,t1_ff6bcjp,1579627548.0,You want to be really careful with rabbits and dogs as just the stress of a dog roaming outside their enclosure can be harmful to the rabbit.
dogs,ff6h6x2,t1_ff59myw,1579627121.0,The groomer I had been taking him to at petsmart changed to a private salon to tutor under a master groomer for show/competitive grooming recently. She let me know where the new place was but also which groomer at petmart would be a good choice for my dog. As the new place was too far I am still going to petsmart and the groomer she told me to try is just as great with my dog.
Dogtraining,ff4t1nw,t3_ermpd3,1579571758.0,That looks like excitement or demand barking to me. See how he is watching the ball and fixated on it unable to look away from it. He can't concentrate or has the impulse control to look away and do what you are asking. It is too much for him in that moment. You might want to practice the [Jazz up then Settle game](https://www.dogstardaily.com/training/jazz-settle-down) to work on impulse control and settling.
dogs,ff4pz3m,t1_ff44gqr,1579569642.0,Totally agree. It is not uncommon for some to learn a dog has isolation distress or separation anxiety because the Foster home had more than one dog or never crated them in alone in a room.
dogs,ff4nnqj,t1_ff45y6u,1579568020.0,They tend to be alarm barkers. If you are consistant with training it can be easily managed to keep them from barking for fun.

puppy101,ff4mmva,t1_ff3zlsj,1579567298.0,"Benji was fine with lawn inflatables for the longest time, until one house turned on the motion/bobbing. Then then became enemy number one and needed to attacked. It took ages but now he no longer growls and tried to intimidate them."
dogs,ff3no25,t1_ff2twnh,1579544939.0,"I have always had great experiences with my dog being groomed at Petsmart. My pup has been going their since I first got him and he loves the groomer there. I have tried other private salons and never felt they did as good a job as Petsmart. The worst groom my dog has gotten was by a private groomer that was supposed to specialize in my dogs breed! They gave him a very choppy poor haircut that looked unfinished and did not last a week before looking like he had not been groomed at all. They obviously rushed his groom and did not spend nearly as much time needed to get an even haircut done. 

The people their are always nice and kind to the dogs and don't force a dog to do something that is too stressful or dangerous. They will stop a groom if it can't be done safely and refer the owner to the vet groomer right next to the store. They also won't demat a dog for hours as it is torture to the dog and a surefire way to make a dog hate grooming. 

Yes salons are going to be loud some level of barking no matter what you do as not all dogs tolerate being kenneled. It is the safest way to keep them as free roaming in a shop is dangerous for both the animals and the people.  

They are always prompt in letting you know when the dog is finished and how long it takes. Always phoning you if they finish early or if a lot of drop in nail trims are slowing them down. They are not a boarding kennel and only keep the dogs for the length of the groom not the entire day."
dogs,ff3fq61,t1_ff3actn,1579540123.0,"I think what they are trying to say is that a lot of people get pressured into adopting shelter dogs that don't fit them well out of guilt. These people often burn out on rescue animals after getting talked into taking on too much or a bad match. Often they are then criticized when despite doing everything they can end up needing to return them or find a new home because it does not work out.  

I know several people that can't adopt senior dogs due to the heartache of only getting to spend a short time with the dog. They are afraid of not having the emotional bounce back to get another dog if they lose them so soon after bonding. One person is a huge rescue person and is struggling to accept their pet they have had since they were a tiny baby is now a senior and their early signs of aging. 

I also someone that love senior dogs and only adopt them because they love to make their golden years great. That it does not matter if they only get a few months or a couple years with them. They cry and morn each one and then let another gray muzzle join their side for as long as they can."
dogs,ff0jqjr,t1_fes83im,1579469494.0,I feel this deeply in my soul. I own a miniature poodle and the number of people blown away at how nice he is and not at all like they though poodles are is frustrating. The bright side is I may have convinced several to go with a poodle over a doodle.
dogs,ff0glrr,t3_eqhle8,1579468666.0,"I hate when people cherry pick stereotypes to fit the narrative they want instead of reality. These are the people that go on about the 'good' qualities of a breed and blame the 'bad' ones on owners or not training them enough, as if training can erase hundreds of years of selective breeding. That use poor examples of the breed or outlier individuals to define an entire breed. 

Examples include: bully breed owners that fight tooth and nail for the 'nanny dog' idea and ignore the dog aggressive history of the breed. Those that try to turn primitive livestock guardian breeds into gregarious biddable golden retrievers. High energy breeds into couch potatoes. Try to make terriers/sighthounds/hunting breeds into living with cats or small prey animals in a Disney movie harmony."
Dogtraining,ff05muu,t3_eqxr4n,1579465437.0,"Walking on leash is the hardest thing for several reasons. First it takes a lot of impulse control as humans like to walk slower than dogs want to move when exploring preferring a trot over a walk. Not to mention the distractions going on that can make it harder for your dog to maintain focus. It is also a sustained behaviour they have to maintain for long periods of time. Just think of how much harder and incremental it is to teach a dog to sit for 5 seconds, then 20, then maintain it for a full minute. 

You have to teach a dog to yield to leash pressure instead of following the opposition reflex to pull against it. This can be really difficult if the dog/puppy has learned to ignore it or even that pulling gets them what they want. If something is distracting or rewarding enough they can become too distracted to notice it. 

Some dogs also take a lot of training to accept wearing a collar or harness and then to have a leash connected to it. Many dogs find a leash a handy chew toy or object to redirect onto when frustrated."
dogs,ff04xs3,t1_fezesut,1579465289.0,"I also like the frat party comparison. Some love it, some hate it, and some grow out of it."
Dogtraining,ff03qxn,t1_fez7pmq,1579464830.0,"You can try doing an about face when they pull. So that instead of just stopping you get the dog to turn back to you and walk in the opposite direction for few steps with you before turning back around and continue walking they way they wanted to go. This can greatly help a dog learn that if they want to get somewhere pulling takes longer to get their but they still get to move. 

There are also sill leash games where you move about quickly changing direction randomly to teach the dog to pay attention to where you are heading. Giving plenty of feedback so they know you are about to change direction. I like to use 'this way', ' 'right', or 'left' to let my dog know what is expected of them."
dogs,fezr2po,t1_fezk9s1,1579460579.0,I would not get a wood crate as it is much easier for dogs to chew than plastic or metal crates.
dogs,fezq8i7,t3_er09c4,1579460283.0,Are you sure he was their for the full 18 months? It could be that he got loose again or even several times and the owner decided they did not want to deal with him anymore. The owners may have taken claim of the dog and never picked him up and the shelter has to wait a certain amount of time before the dog is considered abandoned. Could the owners claim of ownership also be disputed or being fought over which is why they are there. Their may be a fine they have to pay or are fighting over has the dog stuck in limbo. Thus can't be adopted out until it is settled or that would count and the dog being 'stolen'. How quickly is the shelter on the upkeep of their website? I know some can takes ages to post a dog online after taking them in or rarely update it at all.
dogs,fezoap8,t3_eqzsy7,1579459617.0,"I blame it on the fact that their is no universal spot to expect the D ring on a harness to be. Not even a ballpark guess as it can vary greatly by brand, harness type, size of the dog it is to fit, and even how much adjusting you have to do affects where on the dogs back the D ring sits.  

I have two harness that fit my dog well. One is a mesh style harness and the D ring sits about 6"" down my dogs back. The other is a Y style harness and that one has a D ring just 4"" down my dogs back. A harness I nearly bought put the D ring so close to the dogs neck it is barely 2"" away from the collar. That is a huge variety and I can't expect a brand to put a slot for the D ring in all those places."

Dogtraining,fezjdn8,t1_feyxpzd,1579457967.0,"Yes this was exactly what I was going to comment. I was warned that it is not uncommon for dogs that are uncomfortable with people to get lured too close to them with a treat then bite/snap at the person once the treat is gone. As they were suddenly too far past their boundary  with the treat gone. 

It is something you need to tailor towards your individual dog."
dogs,fezh3b5,t3_eqqrv5,1579457268.0,It could have been a human predator that took them. It is common for pets that are highly visable to be stakes out by people and snatched when given the chance. The activity by the coyote could have been the distraction someone needed to steal them.
dogs,fezddhy,t1_fexyls3,1579456179.0,"I totally agree with this. It is really important to remember that dogs this reactive don't always respond, improve much, or quickly to training. That regression or backsliding is always possible and can set training back weeks to months. They will never be a normal dog and you must always treat them as an aggressive dog that needs careful management for life."
dogs,fez12f0,t3_eqxx8s,1579452918.0,"Yes it is totally normal and for dogs to pick up bad habit/behaviour from others. It is one of the reason you need to be very choosy when you allow them to play and interact with other dogs you don't know well. A lot of bad habits like barking and jumping are self rewarding and easy for a dog to pick up as an option to do when they want something or are excited.  

To be fair though humping is a pretty normal displacement behaviour, both male and female, dogs that are over aroused/excited can do. It is sort of a outlet for frantic 'I don't know what to do and am so worked up' than many dogs can do. If the energy and general feel of the park was very busy and excited it would not be unusual for them to display more drastic behaviour."

dogs,feliyjx,t3_epsfb5,1579223300.0,"She looks like a pretty common black shepherd mixed with a longer coated breed to me. The feathering on her is common in mixes that have a parent with longer fur length or feathering themselves. Remember that mixing breeds can really hide distinctive traits of their breed. Black is a strong dominant trait and can cover a lot of different coat patterns. Mixes are also unlikely to come from dogs with strong breed type or ones that vary from standard.  

The filed teeth is likely because she had a problem with tooth alignment. They can grow in a way that causes them to potentially damage the roof of the mouth/soft pallet. This can be because of over or under shot of the jaw. One way to fix this is to file the teeth so they don't damage the mouth. 

How much of her tail is missing? With working breeds they normally either dock to 3/4 of the length or a short bob. If it is just a little bit off the tip it could be from an old injury.

I also urge you to really think on why you want a doodle instead of either of the breeds used to make it. Mixing two breed means that the puppies are not predictable in any way.

dogs,fehm9dx,t3_ep62ma,1579119410.0,"I think you would do well a golden retriever. They tick pretty much all the boxes you want. Loving, goofy, cuddly, biddable, eager to please, good with other animals, accepting of other dogs, and friendly towards stranger. It is hard to go wrong with a good golden retriever. 

They do well with other animals if raised with them as puppies and have a soft mouth. That does mean they tend to be very mouthy as puppies so super puppy proof and take advantage of crate,exercise pens, and baby gates to keep them away from things when you cant watch them closely. Give your cat dog free spaces and work on preventing your puppy from chasing them. Baby gates, cat trees, or cat shelves work great at getting them off the floor and away from the puppy if they need a break. Have them dragging a leash when inside (remove the handle to keep it from catching on stuff or diy one from rope) so you can stop them if they try to chase. Just make sure when you talk to a breeder you ask for a low prey drive puppy as some can have a surprising amount of it making cat chasing a problem.

I suggest golden over a lab just because golden hair tends to fall out and form tumbleweeds of hair that are easier to clean up than lab hair which tends to weave into things. If you get them used to the groomer you can take them for a bath and blow out every couple months to drastically cut down on the fur in your home. It is amazing the loose hair a groomer can get of a dog vs what you can do at home. High velocity blowers are a game changer in getting loose undercoat out of a dog. 

Goldens are a great breed if you want to dabble in dog sport because they are biddable, eager to please, and forgiving of training mistakes. They want to please and be with you so do well in most sports or activities. If you end up really liking it you can go farther with golden than most breeds without needing a sporty or drivey dog. At the same time if you don't have as much time or things change they can adapt to not having a sport outlet if given other things like fetch or long walks. 

If you are willing to do more grooming and want a smaller dog then my other suggestion would be an English Cocker Spaniel. Keep them cut short and take them in often for less work in grooming them yourself. Similar to a Golden they are tick most of your boxes off. Just be careful with choosing a breeder as they can have more prey drive if from hunting lines."

dogs,fe3i4ns,t1_fe0dpit,1578849444.0,"One of the tricks to grooming a large dog or one that is still learning to accept grooming is to do it one section at a time. Divide the dog into sections like the back legs, chest/back, head & tail, and front legs helps keep the time spent on each grooming session short and sweet. It makes it much more manageable to teach the dog to accept 10-15 minutes of grooming for a section then try to push them into letting you do everything. It also lets you trouble shoot if any spot is particularly sensitive and needs more work on desensitization. When you do the entire dog it can be hard to tell if a spot is sensitive or they have just reached the point in time they are done being good for groomed. 

Use lots of treats when you start out. If you have a particularly wiggly puppy like mine was get a helper to assist in holding them still and feeding them treats while you brush. [Licky mats](https://www.aquapaw.com/products/slow-treater) or just smearing peanut butter on the tub walls can be used in the tub to help with baths. Make sure to put down a towel in the bottom of the tub to give them grip. The slippery footing is one of the reasons many dogs don't like getting baths. 

Do a section a day until you finish brushing the the entire dog then restart the list is a great way to make it a manageable task for you. It is also easier to fit a 10-15 minutes brushing into the average schedule then a full body brush. 

Check out your local groomers to see if they offer puppy baths/grooms. The point of a puppy bath/groom is to get them comfortable with the grooming process not to get a full grooming done. Groomers are a great source of information on how to teach your puppy to accept grooming what tools to tryout for their specific coat type and what needs work.

A fat dog lives a shorter life, it ages their body faster, and can cause excess wear and tear of their joints. They can help you figure out the weight they should be and how much to cut down on calories to reach it. 

Second you really need to control how much they eat. If you can't control calorie intake then you will never get them to lose weight. Just like with people you can't lose weight if you are getting more calorie than you burn. [This is a great example of what control of diet can do if followed and when it is not.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIOmOzlepLc) Dog proof the kitchen and food storage areas to prevent food stealing. Use baby gates if needed to keep them out of the kitchen. Tuck garbage cans out of the way where the dog can't reach, switch to covered ones they can't open, or keep them in a dog proof room without them when you can't supervise them. If they are counter surfers keep food off the counters any time the dog is allowed in the kitchen. You may want to muzzle train them if they are a vacuum on walks to the point you don't have a chance to stop them eating things.  

You may want to switch to a lower calorie diet food so they can get the same volume of food with less calorie. Feed meals in separate rooms to prevent stealing during meal times. Switch to weighing portions of food instead of scooping to make sure you are not being more generous than you think. Feed from slow food bowls, treat dispensing toys, kongs, or snuffle mats. It can really help dogs feel more satisfied if it takes them longer to eat their food despite getting the same amount.

Clippers and scissoring can take a lot of work to get older dogs to accept if they are not used to it. 

Coat change for poodles does not happen until around a 8 months to a year old. It can take months for it to fully transition. My pup took nearly 6 months before he fully transitioned to an adult coat."

I have tried other private salons and never felt they did as good a job as Petsmart. The worst groom my dog has gotten was by a private groomer that was supposed to specialize in my dogs breed! They gave him a very choppy poor haircut that looked unfinished and did not last a week before looking like he had not been groomed at all. They obviously rushed his groom and did not spend nearly as much time needed to get an even haircut done. 

The people their are always nice and kind to the dogs and don't force a dog to do something that is too stressful or dangerous. They will stop a groom if it can't be done safely and refer the owner to the vet groomer right next to the store. They also won't demat a dog for hours as it is torture to the dog and a surefire way to make a dog hate grooming. 

Yes salons are going to be loud some level of barking no matter what you do as not all dogs tolerate being kenneled. It is the safest way to keep them as free roaming in a shop is dangerous for both the animals and the people.  

They are always prompt in letting you know when the dog is finished and how long it takes. Always phoning you if they finish early or if a lot of drop in nail trims are slowing them down. They are not a boarding kennel and only keep the dogs for the length of the groom not the entire day."
dogs,ff3fq61,t1_ff3actn,1579540123.0,"I think what they are trying to say is that a lot of people get pressured into adopting shelter dogs that don't fit them well out of guilt. These people often burn out on rescue animals after getting talked into taking on too much or a bad match. Often they are then criticized when despite doing everything they can end up needing to return them or find a new home because it does not work out.  

I know several people that can't adopt senior dogs due to the heartache of only getting to spend a short time with the dog. They are afraid of not having the emotional bounce back to get another dog if they lose them so soon after bonding. One person is a huge rescue person and is struggling to accept their pet they have had since they were a tiny baby is now a senior and their early signs of aging. 

I also someone that love senior dogs and only adopt them because they love to make their golden years great. That it does not matter if they only get a few months or a couple years with them. They cry and morn each one and then let another gray muzzle join their side for as long as they can."

That use poor examples of the breed or outlier individuals to define an entire breed. 

Examples include: bully breed owners that fight tooth and nail for the 'nanny dog' idea and ignore the dog aggressive history of the breed. Those that try to turn primitive livestock guardian breeds into gregarious biddable golden retrievers. High energy breeds into couch potatoes. Try to make terriers/sighthounds/hunting breeds into living with cats or small prey animals in a Disney movie harmony."
Dogtraining,ff05muu,t3_eqxr4n,1579465437.0,"Walking on leash is the hardest thing for several reasons. First it takes a lot of impulse control as humans like to walk slower than dogs want to move when exploring preferring a trot over a walk. Not to mention the distractions going on that can make it harder for your dog to maintain focus. It is also a sustained behaviour they have to maintain for long periods of time. Just think of how much harder and incremental it is to teach a dog to sit for 5 seconds, then 20, then maintain it for a full minute. 

You have to teach a dog to yield to leash pressure instead of following the opposition reflex to pull against it. This can be really difficult if the dog/puppy has learned to ignore it or even that pulling gets them what they want. If something is distracting or rewarding enough they can become too distracted to notice it. 

Some dogs also take a lot of training to accept wearing a collar or harness and then to have a leash connected to it. Many dogs find a leash a handy chew toy or object to redirect onto when frustrated."

So that instead of just stopping you get the dog to turn back to you and walk in the opposite direction for few steps with you before turning back around and continue walking they way they wanted to go. This can greatly help a dog learn that if they want to get somewhere pulling takes longer to get their but they still get to move. 

There are also sill leash games where you move about quickly changing direction randomly to teach the dog to pay attention to where you are heading. Giving plenty of feedback so they know you are about to change direction. I like to use 'this way', ' 'right', or 'left' to let my dog know what is expected of them."

I have two harness that fit my dog well. One is a mesh style harness and the D ring sits about 6"" down my dogs back. The other is a Y style harness and that one has a D ring just 4"" down my dogs back. A harness I nearly bought put the D ring so close to the dogs neck it is barely 2"" away from the collar.

They will never be a normal dog and you must always treat them as an aggressive dog that needs careful management for life."
dogs,fez12f0,t3_eqxx8s,1579452918.0,"Yes it is totally normal and for dogs to pick up bad habit/behaviour from others. It is one of the reason you need to be very choosy when you allow them to play and interact with other dogs you don't know well. A lot of bad habits like barking and jumping are self rewarding and easy for a dog to pick up as an option to do when they want something or are excited.  

To be fair though humping is a pretty normal displacement behaviour, both male and female, dogs that are over aroused/excited can do. It is sort of a outlet for frantic 'I don't know what to do and am so worked up' than many dogs can do. If the energy and general feel of the park was very busy and excited it would not be unusual for them to display more drastic behaviour."

dogs,feliyjx,t3_epsfb5,1579223300.0,"She looks like a pretty common black shepherd mixed with a longer coated breed to me. The feathering on her is common in mixes that have a parent with longer fur length or feathering themselves. Remember that mixing breeds can really hide distinctive traits of their breed. Black is a strong dominant trait and can cover a lot of different coat patterns. Mixes are also unlikely to come from dogs with strong breed type or ones that vary from standard.  

The filed teeth is likely because she had a problem with tooth alignment. They can grow in a way that causes them to potentially damage the roof of the mouth/soft pallet. This can be because of over or under shot of the jaw. One way to fix this is to file the teeth so they don't damage the mouth. 

How much of her tail is missing? With working breeds they normally either dock to 3/4 of the length or a short bob. If it is just a little bit off the tip it could be from an old injury. While uncommon sometimes mother dogs bite off the tips of their puppies tails near birth when eating the umbilical sack or cord."

You are better off selecting a puppy with the temperament and personality you are want first and worrying about gender second. You really only notice a difference in intact animals as hormonal cycles can make females moody at times.

I also urge you to really think on why you want a doodle instead of either of the breeds used to make it. Mixing two breed means that the puppies are not predictable in any way.

The second formal one I reserve for when I can ensure he will come. This can be because I have him on the long line so he can’t dart away.

Things like this person lets me jump on them a couple times when I greet before telling me to sit/stop so I keep jumping on them where as this person does not and I need to sit right away if I want the treat. They remember exactly who will cave if they whine at them for table scraps and who will not no matter how much they beg. Poodles are a breed that you give an inch they will take the mile from you. At the same time this means if you are consistant they can pick up  what you teach them to get what they want fairly quickly. 

I learned this the hard way during my puppy's teething stage when he learned I put up with harder puppy biting more than everyone else.

dogs,fehm9dx,t3_ep62ma,1579119410.0,"I think you would do well a golden retriever. They tick pretty much all the boxes you want. Loving, goofy, cuddly, biddable, eager to please, good with other animals, accepting of other dogs, and friendly towards stranger. It is hard to go wrong with a good golden retriever. 

They do well with other animals if raised with them as puppies and have a soft mouth. That does mean they tend to be very mouthy as puppies so super puppy proof and take advantage of crate,exercise pens, and baby gates to keep them away from things when you cant watch them closely. Give your cat dog free spaces and work on preventing your puppy from chasing them. Baby gates, cat trees, or cat shelves work great at getting them off the floor and away from the puppy if they need a break. Have them dragging a leash when inside (remove the handle to keep it from catching on stuff or diy one from rope) so you can stop them if they try to chase. Just make sure when you talk to a breeder you ask for a low prey drive puppy as some can have a surprising amount of it making cat chasing a problem.

I suggest golden over a lab just because golden hair tends to fall out and form tumbleweeds of hair that are easier to clean up than lab hair which tends to weave into things. If you get them used to the groomer you can take them for a bath and blow out every couple months to drastically cut down on the fur in your home. It is amazing the loose hair a groomer can get of a dog vs what you can do at home. High velocity blowers are a game changer in getting loose undercoat out of a dog. 

Goldens are a great breed if you want to dabble in dog sport because they are biddable, eager to please, and forgiving of training mistakes. They want to please and be with you so do well in most sports or activities. If you end up really liking it you can go farther with golden than most breeds without needing a sporty or drivey dog. At the same time if you don't have as much time or things change they can adapt to not having a sport outlet if given other things like fetch or long walks. 

If you are willing to do more grooming and want a smaller dog then my other suggestion would be an English Cocker Spaniel. Keep them cut short and take them in often for less work in grooming them yourself. Similar to a Golden they are tick most of your boxes off. Just be careful with choosing a breeder as they can have more prey drive if from hunting lines."

If the management of the bar make excuses for it, don't see this dogs behaviour as a problem, or refuse to do anything about it leave. I would not directly confront the dog owner but instead leave that to management to do. You have no idea if the owner will be reasonable or flip out."

They may not live in an area where others take care and it is safer to spay their female than deal with the local male dogs in their area. 

They wish to take part in things like daycare or boarding which may require dogs be altered to avoid hormonal behaviour.

Baking,fe4q9cl,t3_ennkvm,1578861822.0,Its not bad and pretty good for a beginner. Frosting the sides of a cake can be tricky. One of my tips for frosting the sides is to scoop the frosting in to a large zip top bag and use it as a giant piping bag. It is easier to get a rough coating evenly over the cake sides and top. Then you just swirl it together gently with a spoon and whala a rustic looking frosted cake.

dogs,fe3i4ns,t1_fe0dpit,1578849444.0,"One of the tricks to grooming a large dog or one that is still learning to accept grooming is to do it one section at a time. Divide the dog into sections like the back legs, chest/back, head & tail, and front legs helps keep the time spent on each grooming session short and sweet. It makes it much more manageable to teach the dog to accept 10-15 minutes of grooming for a section then try to push them into letting you do everything. It also lets you trouble shoot if any spot is particularly sensitive and needs more work on desensitization. When you do the entire dog it can be hard to tell if a spot is sensitive or they have just reached the point in time they are done being good for groomed. 

Use lots of treats when you start out. If you have a particularly wiggly puppy like mine was get a helper to assist in holding them still and feeding them treats while you brush. [Licky mats](https://www.aquapaw.com/products/slow-treater) or just smearing peanut butter on the tub walls can be used in the tub to help with baths. Make sure to put down a towel in the bottom of the tub to give them grip. The slippery footing is one of the reasons many dogs don't like getting baths. 

Do a section a day until you finish brushing the the entire dog then restart the list is a great way to make it a manageable task for you. It is also easier to fit a 10-15 minutes brushing into the average schedule then a full body brush. 

Check out your local groomers to see if they offer puppy baths/grooms. The point of a puppy bath/groom is to get them comfortable with the grooming process not to get a full grooming done. Groomers are a great source of information on how to teach your puppy to accept grooming what tools to tryout for their specific coat type and what needs work.  

If you have more questions I suggest checking out r/doggrooming which is a subreddit for groomers. They offer great advice on helping pet owners groom their dogs."
dogs,fdzwd1w,t1_fdztd3o,1578797385.0,I find most middle of the price range brushes tend to be good for most dogs coats. If you are looking to show talk to your breeder about the brand they like to use. Personally I like the [Wahl gel handle brushes](https://www.amazon.ca/Handle-Stainless-Steel-Bristle-Orange/dp/B07L4VLBPL/ref=sr_1_61?dchild=1&qid=1578795904&s=pet-supplies&sr=1-61).

I would suggest you get one that is a dedicated pin brush and not a double sided one like I did. They tend to be more awkward to use or you end up only using the one side anyway. Raid the cat side of the store if you have a small breed as they are much easier to use on a puppy used to than a larger brush. I really like [CHI for dogs leave in spray](https://www.amazon.com/CHI-Keratin-Conditioner-Moisturizing-Balanced/dp/B07J5C4H7G/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=chi+for+dogs&qid=1578797205&sr=8-7) for when I am brushing.

dogs,fdzseug,t3_engh17,1578794692.0,"Get a nice pin brush to use on their coat and don't cheap out on one as they don't last as long. Choose one with rounded over tips not just straight uncapped pins. The longer their hair the longer the pins should be. Keep a separate brush for use on their coat when wet as it can change the spring in the brush after it gets wet. Slicker brushes are also great and match the length of the pins to your dogs coat. Just remember to be gentle with a slicker as they can scratch or irritate your dogs skin causing brush burn. 

Spot brush their feet and armpits frequently as they tend to tangle faster than other spots. Same for high friction spots like where their harness or collar sits on their body. Detangling spray or spray in conditioner are life changing in how easy and quick it makes brushing. 

Learn how to [line brush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRmsuoe6z6s) it makes a world of a difference in caring for their coat. Also remember to go over their coat with a comb to check for any tangles that have been missed. You should be able to part their hair and see skin.

There are many alternatives you can give like other seed or nut butters like almond, cashew, sunflower, or pumpkin seed if you wish allergies allow. You can give other similar texture moist treats like plain yogurt or baby food made from dog safe ingredients."
dogs,fdzdd9s,t3_enfqk7,1578789146.0,My dogs call name is Benji to relate to the poodle my dad had as a kid who's name was Bijou. I also went with it because of the nickname potential like Ben or Benjamin when he gets older and becomes more of a gentleman. His registered name I got to choose as long as it started with D and chose Dante Crema. It is after the Italian poet for the breeds intelligence. Crema was after the name for the foam that forms over espresso as a his baby puppy fur was the same dark cream colour.
dogs,fdy4k58,t3_enb8li,1578776074.0,"The whole point of going with a purebred dog is the consistency in how they behave and the care they need. We have spend hundreds if not thousands of generations fixing these traits into those breeds. Choosing a breed looking get the exception of how it acts makes no sense for even choosing that breed in the first place.

Perpetuating the myth that it is all how you raise them is dangerous and cruel. It set unrealistic expectations of how much nurture and nature go into how a dog behaves.

dogs,fdxc2kg,t3_en9txj,1578767286.0,"I would say you need a pinbrush, metal comb, and either a detangling spray or spray in conditioner. I suggest getting a metal comb with both fine teeth and wider teeth on it as the fine teeth are great for getting stuff out of the coat.  Detangling spray is wonderful as it helps the brush go through the hair and keep it from getting too frizzy/staticky. [Here is a great video on how to brush a double coated dog.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRmsuoe6z6s)  It goes over how to line brush them to make sure you get through the  entire coat. Since your dog has long guard hairs you will want to go over with a metal comb after you finish line brushing. I would also get a nice slicker brush. [Here is a good video on how to use a slicker brush.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyW1ZU5-LBc)  Practice on your arm how much pressure to use when brushing with a  slicker as they can scratch or irritate your dogs skin.

dogs,fds5nd0,t3_empiur,1578694903.0,I would try to stick to your usual routine if they are already used to you working nights. Routine is such a useful tool in making dogs comfortable with things as they know what to expect. Try not to make a big deal about it and treat it like normal can help. If you can it would be useful to get an extra day where you are their at night before leaving them at home when you go to work. Maybe give them each stuffed kong to make your leaving that day less interesting in the face of a yummy treat. Of course use your judgement if your dogs tend to have a sensitive stomach when stressed or may squabble over it.

Just like training any other command you pair saying their name with good things. A fun way to do this is to get a bunch of treats and every time your dog looks to you when call their name you toss the treat for them. Since the dog has to break eye contact and look away from you to get the treat it reinforces that they need to look back at you to get more treats. It also helps keep their name from becoming a recall and more of a 'hey look at me'.
Dogtraining,fds0l1y,t3_emtmpu,1578692437.0,I would invest in a long line and use that while you work on her recall. Chasing is super reinforcing and the more times they get to chase something while ignoring their recall the less effective the recall becomes. They are just learning they can ignore you and do what they want.
dogs,fdr6rjf,t1_fdqtoth,1578680216.0,"I think the reason is because poodles tend to be on the sensitive side and handler focused. In a well bred dog this means they are very in tune with their owner and loving. They want to be with their owner and do what they are doing similar to other handler focused breeds. In my experience they are not any more needy than other handler focused dog breed I have met. 

Bad breeders use this as an excuse to pass of neurotic, anxious, and timid dogs as normal when they are not and should not be bred from."
dogs,fdr3gu0,t3_emu1n8,1578678968.0,I would take them to the vet or an experienced groomer. Phone a groomer and explain the situation to them first. They may be able to use a dremel to get it shorter.
dogs,fdqso07,t1_fdqmks1,1578674031.0,"Yes it is about health testing and about proofing temperament. Depending on the breed each club has certain conditions/faults/diseases that are more common in them. For health testing it is genetic tests for those known disease the breed is predisposed to or checking for recessive genes that they could pass on. Along with those tests many breeds require xrays of key joints to ensure the parent dogs don't have orthopedic problems or eye exams by specialists. Joint exams need to be done after the dog is two years old for accurate results as until then they can still change as the dog finished maturing.

Another thing is good breeders test their parent dogs temperament in some way to prove they are worth breeding. This can be a canine good citizen title, conformation title, sport title, working title, or job as an excellent working animal. They remove overly aggressive, timid, or those without the correct temperament for the breed. This is the part of breeding that helps ensure that the dog that looks like a golden retriever acts like a golden retriever."
