Damnthatsinteresting,ffjo8q5,t1_ffhnegc,1580002845.0,"It was fairly close to being accurate despite what that guy said. The few glaring inaccuracies related to factual events, not character interactions, that I found, which the show added to give dramatic effect, was no helicopter crashed into the core for getting too close and losing communication; and the entirety of Eastern Europe wasn't in danger of a contaminated water if the core melted into the bedrock water table. Also, all of the divers survived. They didn't participate in a suicide mission."

Then, one time, they were all sold out all over the city. My girlfriend went to drugstores and pharmacies all over NYC and couldn't find any whatsoever. At each store workers said one small, curly-black haired woman bought up their entire stock. She must've been one depraved individual."

Steel_Division,ffgi6kc,t3_eth35y,1579906793.0,"I enjoy SD2 much more than SD1. The terrains are better, with elevation playing more of a role, and it's nice that everything that's not dense forest isn't just an orchard. Orchards were everywhere in SD1, and the sightlines for light forests in SD2 are much more nuanced than the sightlines in orchards in SD1. Finally, I like how effective ranges were increased for many infantry weapons in SD2.

In my humble opinion, SD2 is much more advanced than its predecessor."

Conservative,ffanb8l,t3_esarcy,1579739972.0,"I read one arrest was made on a woman who refused to take off a bandana that was covering her face, after 2 previous warnings from law enforcement.

Compare the Virginia 2A protest rally to one of the myriad of Antifa gatherings. In Virginia, thousands of armed people showed up. Nobody was harmed in any way, and one arrest was made. At Antifa rallies, there is typically numerous instances of violence, typically instigated by Antifa members, and there are usually dozens of arrests.

To CNN, MSNBC and the rest of the ultra left, it was a huge Nothingburger."

Also, here's a link to the Indeed for Olympia Entertainment - which is the Illitch's business.

Go ahead and submit your sparkling, extensive resume and I'm sure they'll give you an interview. I mean, with you being such a well-rounded, intelligent individual and all, and someone who encourages similar property business tactics. You'll fit right in! Good for you, Champ!"
Steel_Division,ff4ccfo,t3_erj7rt,1579560273.0,So just to get things straight from reading other posts: most people think the optics of recon isn't significantly better than standard infantry?
history,ff4ahv0,t1_ff3okqh,1579559102.0,"Mike Illitch wasn't as great as you out of towners might think.

He and his company bought acres of land and property in prime downtown/midtown and surrounding Detroit neighborhoods decades ago and did nothing but sit on it, allowing it to become dilapidated, rather than giving other landowners an opportunity to purchase the land to develop. Much of his land near the new Little Caesar's Arena is still in shambles and an eyesore.

Oh, and then there's the thing how his group convinced Detroit taxpayers to foot the bill on LCA with the promise to build this grand ""The District"" neighborhood near LCA. Funny that zero work has been done on ""The District"" since LCA was opened.

But hey, he gave money to some old black lady who was a civil rights pioneer who had shamefully gotten robbed, and his Red Wings were damned near unstoppable in the 90s when I was a kid, so he must be a good guy. Right?"
