earbiscuits,ffmof3j,t3_eu5kna,1580057287.0,"Really loved this episode.  Once they explained their reasons for not sharing these details before, and explained why they decided to share them now, it kinda made sense. They were   unhesitatingly open and honest, and I thought Link especially seemed quite eager and happy to talk about it, as opposed to, say, their appearance on Pete Holmes' podcast, where he (Link) seemed very reticent to discuss it.  I'd imagine this was because the direction of the conversation wasn't 100% under their control. Rhett opened up a little, but Link seemed (in my opinion) to shut down and become very uncomfortable. Who knows, maybe the Pete Holmes podcast sparked the thought of talking about their faith journey on their own terms. 

In any case, I'm glad they decided to make this EB, not to get the juicy details or get to 'know' them better, but because I think the whole discusion of faith and spirituality and others' journeys on that path is fascinating. And I say that as someone who was raised and educated in the Catholic faith, who now has pretty much zero interest or involvement in that, or any, faith. I am basically non-religious these days, as is pretty much every Catholic of my generation that I know (is that weird?).  But I fully respect other's religious beliefs. And as R&L seem to be/(have been?) so heavily involved with their faith, I think this series of EB's is going to be really interesting listening and I'm really looking forward to hearing their individual stories."

I think the vlogs are a great idea. It's cool to see the guys a little more unstructured in their presentation. It just shows their experience and professionalism that they can still make it look effortless, even with the little digs to each other about how to hold the cameras properly lol.

Both guys have beautiful homes too! Those rugs!!

In terms of the vlog subject, it might have been better to have the dogs meet the cat in a neutral setting. Barbara might have felt a little threatened about unexpectedly meeting an animal she had no experience of ever seeing before, in HER territory. But that's just an aside."

goodmythicalmorning,ferd6s0,t3_eqfcwx,1579352545.0," I mean,  Rhett didn't actually have to get nekkid   and shower,   he  could have just stood in the shower cubicle fully clothed  and  looked out the window. ...but that wouldn't have been  as much  fun lol ...."

goodmythicalmorning,fea8nxh,t3_eo8z5n,1578945669.0,"Link probably has a 'tell' that Rhett has picked up on over the years, as they know each other so well. I had a friend several years back whom I always knew was telling a little fib or fishing for information, as she had a particular physical 'tell' that was obvious to me but not to others."
