But  I can guide you as to how I do it.  The fit has to be tight. So go slow and check often.  First lay out the slot in the piece you want to use.  Then drill holes smaller then the width.  I then use jewelers files to open the hole.  Go slow and check often.  If you have a file guide use it.  I get mine to slide on to almost a 1/4"" left to go and then hammer it on using a piece of copper pipe. When you are happy with the fit ,  move on to the next step.  I would then dry fit all the parts.
