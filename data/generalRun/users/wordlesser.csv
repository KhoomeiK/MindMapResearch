AskReddit,ffdh8pf,t1_ffc69tt,1579820817.0,"Nothing wrong with giving up on hobbies. My hobby is trying new things. That means I'm not truly passionate about something, and give up on things when I get ""okay"" at them.

It's a blast. One week I'm obsessed with playing guitar, then all of a sudden it's videogames, then I'm all about weight lifting, then it's 3D printing, then it's drums, then it's drawing, then I get it in my head I want to make a website.

I'm never bored, because I always have something new to try, and can rotate between things whenever I feel the urge. Sure, I'll never get really good at anything, or be incredibly passionate about a specific thing, but trying something new is the hobby moreso than whatever it is I'm doing.

It's also fun to just go along with others. My friends are into boardgames? Cool, I'll join! They're into archery? I'm up for that! They're into sports? I'll go to the game with you!"

Having more interests besides games, or up to try new hobbies.

Seriously, a dude who's genuinely interested in my hobbies and tries to relate is way more attractive than someone who keeps going on about their singular interest. 

""I've never done that before but it sounds cool, can I join one day and try it out?"" is also a great way to get a date when someone talks about an activity they love."
AskReddit,ffd70an,t3_esr647,1579814653.0,"Organizing.

Whether it's clearing out cluttered drawers, organizing files online, alphabetizing something, reorganizing a space to make more room and have the layout more efficient, or even if it's just making the best schedule to fill in time, I can get it done and get it done efficiently and quickly.

I hate it. I hate strict schedules and rules, and I'm the most unorganized person I know. I spend most of my life in one hour bursts of productivity in which I just ""get shit done""."

AskWomen,femmjqa,t3_epo2ax,1579262664.0,"Do new things with the intent to fail at them. Getting over the fear of failure and rejection makes life easier. 

Apply to jobs that you're underqualified for but know you could do. Date those people who seem out of your league. Turn up the difficulty in a video game. Talk to people who have vastly different opinions. Take a introductory class in something you've never done before.

Do the things that you feel lead to rejection and failure. Base it on what you're capable of dealing with right now. If losing at a game is hard, start playing more games you'll lose. If job rejections are your level of ""I can't deal with this"", apply to more jobs. If you take online commentary personally, put yourself out there in subreddits you know you'll get attacked.

Start small. Take a break when it gets to you. Remind yourself that failure and rejection aren't personal. 

The more you do it, the easier it gets. It helps improve your self esteem, helps with navigating difficult situations, makes it easier to ask for something you need, etc."

Ever notice how most of that motivation happens when you should be getting ready for bed, and you rarely do anything with it? It's easier to think about what should be done than to do it, and an easy way to feel good about yourself.

todayilearned,fdrfsv1,t1_fdr1bml,1578683942.0,It also depends who you're talking to; it's so easy to subconsciously pick up the slang used by others you frequently talk to. I suppose it is a form of digital code-switching.

I suppose it also makes a difference which sources you use. There's enough people whose internet presence doesn't go much further than popular social media and get most of their exposure to written English from Instagram stories, Tweets and Facebook status updates.  

But in general, my experience is that those with limited formal education in English have a weaker grasp on the language. This goes for native speakers as well."
relationship_advice,fdqh9fi,t1_fdqbeyk,1578666626.0,"And hey, don't forget, it's a big world out there. I grew up in a relatively small town (30.000 population) myself, and dating - especially in the age range where a lot of people have moved for college - just tends to be a bit harder in that situation. 

Maybe you'll meet someone who's back in town, visiting her parents during a school holiday. Or someone who's from out of town, and visiting friends or family. Or someone who moves to your town and is new. Or maybe you'll meet someone somewhere else when you're out of town yourself.

relationship_advice,fdqa7d8,t1_fdq6uac,1578660902.0,"So keep going at it. Be as happy as you can be. Relationships will happen eventually, you're really not missing out and losing all your chances.

The best advice I can give you is, just for a while, forget about it. Live your life. Don't pick up hobbies to be more interesting, but pick them up because you like them. 

If insecurity is an issues, ask yourself who you are as a person. If you'd be single forever, imagine yourself ten years from now and relatively happy. What would you be doing? Who would you call if you're sad? What would your friends do for your birthday? Where would you travel? What job would you have? Forget the whole partner thing, and figure out yourself first. Because a relationship isn't going to change your life drastically, it's not going to make it complete - it's just going to add to your life, for the better. 

Some ideas:

Find a sport you love, or go to the gym, but see getting in shape as an added benefit, and getting your endorphins running and maybe making some new friends as the main reason.

Find hobbies involving other people. Like music? Go to shows! Like dogs and cats? Volunteer at the shelter. Like reading? See if you can volunteer at the library, or if they organize some events. Get out of the house and get around other people who share your interests, it usually does wonders for your self esteem.

Go on dates without expectations. No seriously, just install Tinder and ignore the rejections. It doesn't have to be serious or go anywhere, your approach should be getting to know the other person and their story. Don't actively look for hook-ups, but actively look for dates. This way, when there is a click, the first date won't be as awkward and scary, because you'll be used to it.

Don't date broken people who think a relationship will fix them. Seriously. Don't. You're not going to fix anything, and more often than not, they'll just use it to fix their broken self esteem, and move on. People who think a relationship will fix them / give them what they're missing / is needed for them to feel complete usually aren't ready for it.

Get good at something. Anything. Find a skill and get at least a bit better than the average person you know. It can be anything, from running to writing, speed reading to programming, woodworking to drawing, new languages to public speaking. Usually even starting it makes you better than the average person. Having things you're good at help make you feel good about yourself.

But that's it. You need to start feeling good about yourself. You need to start feeling like you're not missing out and ruining all chances, but instead are building yourself for the future chances.

You're gonna be okay, and you're gonna find someone. Don't make not having someone yet your life."
AskReddit,fdlwa76,t3_elssvy,1578534031.0,"We always had slot machines at our local fair, where we could win points to trade for the things they had available. I loved those as a child.

So they had a jar with what looked like funny figures. I wanted those. Got asked if I was sure, and didn't understand why they asked me. Of course I was sure, funny figures seemed cool!

I ran off to my parents with said funny figure. They laughed at me. Turned out it wasn't a funny figure, it was a condom shaped like a funny figure.

I chuckled to myself as I reread my old Terry Pratchett novels. Good thing he wasn't around to witness the craziness of the current day. Then again, no one was around. Rereading old books had become a habit of mine, a desperate grab towards a sense of familiarity, comfort, even love. The first few weeks after the world ended, it was devastating. I hid in my room, frantically refreshing the internet, hoping for some sign of communication. I even figured out how to get on the dark web, in the hope some far-away drug lord might have found some ways to survive.

That was when the stench of dead bodies became too much for me. I had to do something about it, clean out my immediate surroundings. The tap water was starting to look kind of murky, and I needed to get to the store, was I to survive. Store first. Bodies later. Well, at least I didn't have to worry about money, for once. The entire store was mine.

I'm not sure why the power was still on. Why the freezers were still working. Or, the internet, with its vast resources of information but now as much of a desolate wasteland as the rest of the world. It took me another few weeks to gather the bodies on a pile. To go through the stores and freeze the perishables. To set myself up for... I didn't know what. I guess the best I could do was write down my experiences, day to day, in case someone - or something - would eventually find them.

The pile of bodies burned like a rescue fire. No one came. At least I was smart enough to do it far from home.

I started exploring the city. My trusty smartphone with me. The satellites still worked. The internet still worked. Sure, public transport wasn't an option and I never got my drivers license, but who was there to call me out for driving? I learned how to break into cars and start them. I learned how to break into homes. The world, empty and quiet, was mine.

Empty and quiet except for the books, were the emotions of humanity were stored. Except from the videos, where the movements and sounds were recorded. I always hated YouTube, never had the patience to look through videos, yet I found myself mesmerized - and eventually, in a sense of morbid humor, started commenting ""last"" on each and every video. Who cared? I started a Vlog. I bet it would have been popular, who didn't want to see New York City at the end of times? But there was no one to watch but me.

My next step, I thought to myself, sitting on top of the Empire State Building, looking at the sunrise, would be to go through the government files. Find some interesting classified information. Figured out which switch was pulled. Figure out why I survived.

My thoughts were disturbed by a sound on my phone. Damn robo-callers. I wish they'd be taken out with them.

**YouTube**.

I thought I turned off all notifications for apps.

**""Someone liked your comment.""**

Wait. What?

I stared at my phone in confusion. Another notification. YouTube, again.

**""You have one new subscriber.""**

I opened the profile. No username. No information. No other subscribers.

**""You have a new message.""**

I opened the message, my hands shaking. Could this be it? The sign of life I spent so many months looking for?

*""Hey! if you're reading this were not alone!!! i am soo far away from you and always wanted to go to nyc but am scared to fly a plane?""*

I laughed at the irony of it. Of course. Of course the only person who'd be able to track me down spoke English, but was too far away to meet. Someone who could fill the void of human conversation, but couldn't help me out of this. Whatever this was.

*""Hi! Yeah, reading this. Where are you living? Any idea what happened?""*

*""Don't know. don't care. the world is better off this way. england. anyway, whats your #?""*

I didn't know whether my phone still worked, but gave out my number. Anything better than those bots, right? I could do with some human interaction. Maybe an old-fashioned call. I'd give a lot to hear a human voice again.

Two minutes later, a text came through. A picture. I opened it. A second message came through almost immediately.

*Send nudes?*

I wish this end of the world took dick pics with it too."
AmItheAsshole,fdh4wly,t1_fdh1z9m,1578415448.0,"Just so you know, you're not alone. This could've been written by my husband, who also found solace in the punk/hardcore scene.

We both speak English, I'm the only one who speaks Dutch, and his job doesn't easily translate. It just made more sense for me to acclimate to his life. Plus, his mom would be heartbroken if her only child moves far away. He once jokingly told her he planned on moving to Portland, and she freaked out. I don't think I could do that to him, make him chose between me and his parents.

But yeah. I forget sometimes that night workers are actually in demand. I come from a small town, without a drivers license, were night jobs were almost impossible to land. Being in a big city with 24/7 public transport, it opens a lot of new possibilities I haven't fully explored yet - and probably never will live long enough for to fully explore. The sleep disorder isn't going anywhere, I wish it did. Turns out waking up early every day does nothing but make me sleep deprived and fat, I've given up on that routine.

I was thinking of a food handlers license just in case I needed to look at the restaurant business. It's usually late at night, and might give me a plus on a resume. Whether it's needed or not, it's like $20 and won't hurt. I will look into carer jobs, and see if there's a side of them I might enjoy.

You're right about coding not going to give me a job in the short term. But it might help with learning how to automatize some basic work in office settings, and might give that one-up I need to get me into an entry-level data entry job. It doesn't have to lead to a full-time job, it needs to be that tiny bit extra that gets me into something. 

I need to set aside money for the TOEFL. It looks like the GED (TASC here) is free for city residents, which is great! 

The goal for volunteering is mostly to just get references. I haven't looked into Habitat for Humanity before, but it sounds like a great idea and I'm going to sign up. Thanks for that!"

That's why my priority for study goes to IT - it's a versatile field with enough paths to take the time and see what clicks with me. Within no-degree paths, I'm thinking data entry for now - but it seems hard to find opportunities outside of the 9-5 hours there. I think that eventually, working in a higher tier tech support role would suit me, combining direct communication with people with technology. 

In the short term, I will settle for anything that has overnight shifts. I'm done sitting at home and relying on my husband financially; I want a job as soon as possible when the work permit comes in, but life-long experience taught me I am unable to consistently fall asleep before 4am (it's more often later than earlier).
