And no amount or mix of drugs killed me.  Just took the pain away for a short while.  Now I am saving up for a bunch of Xanax."
depression,ffusvgh,t3_ev7hve,1580248714.0,Feel exactly the same.   Don’t have the strength to carry on.  I have a daughter and now just thinking of her makes me cry.  I feel you.
depression,ffrzcl4,t3_eskidd,1580169374.0,My girlfriend since 7 tears back left me.  Yay. One less thing to live for.
