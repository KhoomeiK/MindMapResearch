todayilearned,ffn3pxt,t3_eu5wt2,1580061718.0,It makes sense. How many people would want to live in an open space with their neighbors?
MurderedByWords,ffj1c3p,t1_ffix2cb,1579987909.0,">You're forgetting a lot of other people who still need to go to college to get into their field though. A biologist needs to have a degree to enter their field.

I am not forgetting about required degrees and mentioned certain positions requiring degrees. I would be open to government opening free/reduced cost/capped tuition colleges for specific fields requiring a 4 yr degree. To me, it's a good middle ground. 

Message could be simple to students. Are you going to college for a field that requires a degree? If not, then you have to pay. If so, then you can attend this school in your home state or pay for the school of your choice. 

>Not every community college has the capability to prepare students for transferring to a university. For example, credits may not transfer or they don't have the program desired by the student.

This isnt in line with my experience. My university allowed core class transfers from any accredited college. However, that's easy to look up prior to enrollment. 

Capability isnt really an issue in year 1/2 and is probably better at a community college. When I got to university I had a communications class of 200+ students. Biggest class at community was 60ish. 


I still run into people complaining about paying off student debt. (including parents) Unfortunately, there isnt a lot of accountability about their involvement in taking out the loans. 

I do agree with you about college being overpriced. I went through poor with no family money but researched how to minimize debt which meant not going to the ""best"" schools."
MurderedByWords,ffivhg9,t1_ffhgud8,1579983697.0,">Set it based on a program's ROI.

Scenario 1: ROI of the student attending
  - This implies expected earnings in the field after graduation. How many years of earning go into that calculation? Medical school would continue to be several hundred thousand. 

Scenario 2: ROI of the university teaching
  - The university makes any investment and then tuition increase. Tuition increases fund more investment. Rinse and repeat. 

>If at school can't maintain services, I can go elsewhere. 

Unfortunately, many students wont go elsewhere. They have their dream schools and will take out any amount of loans to attend. You mention all schools overcharge but community colleges are significantly cheaper. No need to do 4 years at the same place. 

>Let's say we do nothing. Should schools get away with charging $80,000 a year for degrees that are necessary to enter a field? That's your solution to the tuition issue? 

My solution is to stop telling students they have to go to college. My employer has already removed degrees from every position unless required. (Ie for licensing)

Alternatively, K12 should partner with local companies for internships. Trade schools should also be advised for students esp in hands on fields and IT. 


College is not and should not be the only path to employment. It's a nice brainwash on youth convincing them there is only one way."

MurderedByWords,ffhfidr,t1_ffgx90c,1579933079.0,"But how do you set the initial rate and could certain events allow a university to raise more than another. Examples: Would a research 1 university be able to charge more? Would a university with a number 1 program be able to charge more? Would only that particular program be able to charge more? 

I see many unintended consequences to capping the cost. For example, universities would be incentivized to maintain the bare minimum service in order to maximize net income.

Your idea isnt bad assuming all the ""what ifs"" could be worked out.
