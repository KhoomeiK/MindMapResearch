Thank you St Eligius!

Ps- fine silver will fuse, but sterling oxidizes w/o flux, and needs an intense pinpoint flame to weld without melting the surrounding mass. You'd be better off using a medium solder if you're not doing a zillion parts. Until you get some skills, that is.

Turn the burner on to medium heat and get your torch ready.
(I use a MAPP torch-same size as butane but there's a three foot long hose from tank to tip, which makes it easier to handle.)

Play the torch flame all over the piece and when the flux starts clarifying, focus the flame on a joint at an end. When that flows, move to the next.
The burner should keep the piece hot as you work. Keep the tip at least 1.5-2"" away from object for max heat.
Let cool down a bit before quenching. I count to ten slowly.

SilverSmith,fcwkmnw,t1_fcvzepy,1578028232.0,"I have to correct myself- I confused butane for propane- those 10 inch tanks used for caramelizing creme brulee, which I used in HS. Those butane torches might be too small for a bracelet...they're perfect for posts and pinbacks, and individual links. Try with the hot plate anyway. I once soldered the handles onto a silver ice bucket by putting it on a lazy Susan soldering pan surrounded by 5 blazing bernzomatic propane torches while I applied target heat with the 6th.
I can't believe I didn't burn the place down.

Thank you St Eligius!

Ps- fine silver will fuse, but sterling oxidizes w/o flux, and needs an intense pinpoint flame to weld without melting the surrounding mass. You'd be better off using a medium solder if you're not doing a zillion parts. Until you get some skills, that is.
:)
One mm square solder per 2cm length of bracelet is more than enough.
Good luck!"
SilverSmith,fcvvtxt,t3_ej57k4,1578011244.0,"If you have a stove, place the band on the burner on an iron screen, prepped and ready with all paillions fixed in place by the thin allover coat of flux that you have brushed on, applied paillions to, and allowed to dry completely.

Turn the burner on to medium heat and get your torch ready.
(I use a MAPP torch-same size as butane but there's a three foot long hose from tank to tip, which makes it easier to handle.)

Play the torch flame all over the piece and when the flux starts clarifying, focus the flame on a joint at an end. When that flows, move to the next.
The burner should keep the piece hot as you work. Keep the tip at least 1.5-2"" away from object for max heat.
Let cool down a bit before quenching. I count to ten slowly.

Edit- you can get a cheap hotplate for this. Just make sure it's all metal."
