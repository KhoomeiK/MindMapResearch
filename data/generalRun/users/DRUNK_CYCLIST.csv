Wellthatsucks,ffmrj7x,t1_ffkvuev,1580058183.0,"So, when I was like 10 or so my family went to myrtle Beach. One night we went out for dinner and since we were by the ocean we went to a seafood restaurant. Not sure if it was a buffet or if we had just ordered crab legs, but I was using that little crab/nut cracker thing and the leg exploded in my hands. I was left holding nothing but the cracker and our entire family sat in silence for about 10 seconds wondering where everything went. Everyone at the table was looking around until my grandmother looked behind her and realized at the next table a woman was picking crab meat and shell out of her fresh vacation perm. I thought my grandma was gonna die she was laughing so hard. In short, 6 of us were obnoxiously laughing at this poor woman with crustacean in her hair in front of a full audience of restauranters. 

We did apologize profusely, but the damage was done and I probably ruined an old ladies night."

bicycletouring,ffhie5u,t3_clyz1g,1579936626.0,"I really wanted to do this for my Houston to Arkansas tour, but soloing and the added weight seemed a bit dangerous and arrogant for a newer climber. I was worried about my trad and knot tying skills as a newer climber as I had done little sport climbing and mostly bouldering at a gym. I like that I'm not the first person that has thought this would be fun though

Side note... I didn't touch my bike for a month after my week long tour. My wife wanted to go to the Rock gym and I strained my Achilles, and it has never FULLY healed since then. (I'm 38 now but this was about 4 years ago)."

houseplants,ff2crp4,t1_ff0v7g0,1579500963.0,"Man, I'm jealous and sad. We had a rubber tree growing up (my mom's a big green thumb and I'd always help with plants and weeding as a kid). We had that thing for 10 or 15 years. When I was 24, I moved to Chicago and she gave it to me. I packed all my stuff up in my work van and got that in there, but couldn't leave until the next morning. I drove to Chicago unloaded the van and realized it had froze overnight and I killed my moms ginormous rubber tree. I was fucking devastated. I called her and was so upset, she said that her aunt had given her a 20 year old jade and she had never had a jade so almost immediately killed it and that it was OK. They leaf cleanup is a bit ridiculous but it's otherwise a easy to care for plant. Congrats on your new score! I hope they do well!"
