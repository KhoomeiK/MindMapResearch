But supposedly it only relaxes it for 30 seconds . . .  anyway, I found another thing in Italy that would be great for somebody with less severe GERD than me, called ""RefluMed,"" a concoction of banana powder and a few other things. It helped even me, to some extent. In the US, if a product isn't backed by a truly massive corporation, it's probably not going to live long, and companies like Gaviscon don't seem too motivated to innovate."
GERD,fdsems3,t3_emvzpg,1578700951.0,"There are a bunch of different Gaviscons. The one that works best (for me) comes from England. You can get it on Amazon. Gaviscon Advance. Tablets or liquid. The aniseed liquid kicks ass, but the tablets are excellent as well. They have sodium alginate and potassium carbonate which together form a foamy raft that glues itself to inflammation and protects your LES. Works good."

Just so many single-usage connections, throw-away fastenings, plastic snaps that only work once, hoses that crimp if you play with them too many times. And as for cars, computers, tractors etc, there's a reason there's a Right To Repair lawsuit pending--corporations are deliberately witholding proprietary software and deliberately loading stuff up with inaccessible circuitry"
AskReddit,fdrsip6,t1_fdrgedn,1578689003.0,"Urban legend has it (I'm sure it's true, personally) that the big box stores buy in such huge bulk that they can blackmail these famous brands into building down to cut-rate specs, so the Husky you get at Home Depot is not the same as the Husky you get at the local Husky dealer. Same with John Deere, Milaukee, on and on"
