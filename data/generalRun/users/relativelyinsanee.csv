That one always surprises me because when I used to try it, it was extremely difficult, painful, and awkward to hold more than 2 seconds. Now it's effortless and I enjoy sitting like this. Crossing my legs is super easy too, and when I wear a skirt, I feel so sexy crossing my legs, something I couldn't even imagine doing before. My skin is clearer, my eyes look bigger, my nose is smaller, my hair seems more voluminous (since my head is smaller). Oh, and my shoes are big! It's just a mindfuck all around, especially because I don't see myself as that much thinner until I notice these things."
loseit,fdhim9i,t3_eldbfh,1578423429.0,"Went from BED since childhood to Bulimia in my 20s. I still have an awful relationship with food, but tracking calories obsessively (even if it's still a disordered behavior) keeps me somewhat sane by knowing how much I'm eating. I can tell when I'm eating too little which will predispose me into a binge, and I know when I do slip into a binge that it actually wasn't as bad as I thought and that purging isn't necessary. 

I would love to move away from weighing several times a day, not putting a single morsel into my mouse without knowing the count, and to be free of hating myself, but at the same time, I find so much comfort in my disorder that I can't imagine letting go of it any time soon. I tried to go to therapy to improve it, but I didn't want to listen to them. I was too petrified of gaining weight if I did, and more often than not I ended up binging after one of my sessions, so I quit. If someone is ready for recovery then they would find some value in it, but ultimately, I don't think I want to get better yet.

Even if my thoughts are unhealthy right now, I do think that my body is actually much healthier thanks to the much less frequent binging and purging. I also try to remind myself that a purge is way worse for me than a binge, so try to forgive myself for those.

Keeping busy helps me to some extent, but too busy and I get stressed out and more vulnerable to binge. Having alone time also helps me not binge because I don't feel the need to eat quickly and hidden from everyone. If I don't have enough alone time, I will end up just binging in the parking lot at night inside my car."
loseit,fdhhfhg,t1_fdhf8rb,1578422710.0,"Yep, hated myself and still lost 50 lbs. Only when I felt comfortable and okay with myself (with moments of hatred, like when getting dressed for a party) did I keep gaining and gaining. Shame doesn't work for everyone, but it can be a motivator for msot."
loseit,fdhgzj6,t3_elcwlr,1578422445.0,"It's winter and cold af, so when I go to work (layers), my leggings are under my pants, my sports bra and tee shirt are under my sweater, and if im not already wearing sneakers to work, I keep my sneakers in my car."

loseit,fdegygr,t1_fdeex8v,1578338800.0,"Truthfully it's mostly going to be veggies for true volume eating. Lost of roasted cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower. Zucchini and eggplant are good for filling up, too. Mushrooms are great, but they cook down a ton. What will make them taste good is whatever seasonings you use. 

For example, with broccoli you can take a head of it. In a spray bottle put some sesame oil and give a couple of spritz to coat the broccoli. Then throw on garlic powder, ginger powder, salt, sesame seeds, some soy sauce, and when you roast it, it should taste pretty nice, kind of like an asian flair. 

When I'm feeling extra lazy I take frozen broccoli, dump it in my steamer, and make a dressing with sliced onion, red wine vinegar, tiny bit of olive oil (seriously don't over do it, this is where the bulk of the calories are), lemon, and salt. Then I dump this dressing all over my pound of broccoli and I usually can't even finish it from how full it makes me.

Cauliflower can be roasted like broccoli. For a pound of cauliflower, toss the pieces in some texas pete hot sauce, about half a cup for 60 cal, and a quick spritz of canola or vegetable oil and pop it into the oven for a nice kick.  

If you like rice noodles, try shirataki noodles (miracle noodles). They're made of a root vegetable extremely high in fiber and it's supposed to be 0 calorie because of it as printed on its labels. With a soak in some cold water, you can then use this to whip up a huge low cal pad thai.

If I'm craving something beefy like meat, I do 1 part ground beef to 3 parts finely chopped mushrooms. Egg whites are great for getting in lots of protein on low calories. If I make an omelette I like using 1 whole egg and mixing in 2 egg whites. More filling and far fewer calories. 

The main takeaway really is to try and look for ways in which you can reduce a calorically dense food and pad it out with something lighter. However, it is important to try to hit all of your dietary goals too. (I.e. don't eat 3 pounds of broccoli, be completely stuffed and eat nothing else during the day. That's only about 460 kcal and you're getting virtually no protein or fats, whatsoever.)  

I hope this helps, and feel free to ask me more questions! Also r/volumeeating !"
loseit,fdecrt8,t1_fdec25z,1578336191.0,"Same! Did keto and went from 190 to 157, then I ballooned back up to 196. Now I try to eat good things without cutting anything out. If I crave something I wait a few days and if I still want it, I'll have a little. Now I'm down to 139, and I haven't been this small since even high school! (Probably middle school, quite honestly). Never thought I would get here, but my goal weight seems like it's finally attainable! Don't cut anything out, stay within your calories, and try to steer toward stuff that actually keeps you full. I like to eat alot of stuff, so consider trying volume eating for satiety."
BingeEatingDisorder,fddusjj,t3_ekh0c6,1578324498.0,"Almost everything you said is pretty much exactly me. My issues aren't work related, but I have the vyvanse, the insomnia, the constant upping of the doses, close to your height and weight (5'2"", 139), the binging, the purging. I went to get help for my ED (I dropped almost 60 pounds in the past few months, but I'm still overweight) and they wanted to hospitalize me because of my disordered behavior, but ultimately I declined because I have to work and pay bills. I tried doing an IOP, and while they really wanted to work with me, and I THOUGHT I wanted to recover, I couldn't let go of the obsession with my weight and shape. I can't recover if I am still trying to lose weight. I want to not be so obsessed with this, but I am so terrified of being this size forever, or worse, to gain weight."
BingeEatingDisorder,fddu2mg,t1_fddkkdo,1578323989.0,"I struggle so much with this. Food is always the highlight of my day, and no matter how hard I try, I can't unlink them."
BingeEatingDisorder,fddtlsr,t3_ekq4wz,1578323652.0,"I can relate to this too. I've eaten to the point of pain and discomfort. I have forced myself to purge in the past, but I have eaten to the point of fullness that I puke regardless of me trying to or not. I get this so hard, but know that you're way more than this addiction. 

Something that has helped me avoid this situation is to keep myself away from anything ""bingeable."" Chips, bread, crackers, ice cream, cookies. Things that are quick and easy to eat in bulk. Delete Ubereats, Grubhub, other food delivery apps, and remove your card info. Hopefully the extra step of having to input your info gives you a chance to reassess what you're doing.

I would lose my mind if there was nothing I could eat in my house, so I try to keep things that won't perpetuate the binge, portioned out fruits and veggie sticks, salsa, hummus, skim mozzarella. I like those foods, but they aren't things I would crave during a binge, so it makes it much easier to stop myself and ask, do I really want this? It won't always work, but it's way better to binge on a pound of grapes instead of 4 sleeves of Ritz crackers or an entire baguette with butter and cheese."
BodyAcceptance,fddrrek,t3_eh10xz,1578322273.0,"It depends on what you mean by ""curvy."" Do you mean a small waist to hip ratio? Or rather someone who is larger and softer--for example are you thinking of Beyonce curvy or Lizzo curvy? 

During the peak of her career, Marilyn Monroe had a small waist to hip ratio which is why she was regarded as an iconic curvy sex symbol. At 5'5"" her bust was 35', waist 22"", and hips at 35"". Her dress size was a 1950s 12, which would be considered about a 2-4 today. Her weight did fluctuate during the end of her life because of personal stuff, however.

Women of the renaissance wore waist cinching corsets, meaning they probably also had that tiny waist ideal. In garments recovered from the 1700s, waist sizes teetered between 20-23"", in the 1800s about 23-27"", and early 1900s a smaller waist returned at around 19-22"". 

Being thin wasn't unattractive back then, but having the wealth to not be as thin as say a working farm girl unable to eat as much while expending huge amounts of energy was definitely an enticing thing in the past. That being said there are many strong, confident, beautiful women throughout history that have deviated from the ""ideal"" woman of their times that we could all look up to."
BodyAcceptance,fddpoea,t3_ekg7v5,1578320597.0,"I've lost quite a bit of weight this year, and I'm not even thin, yet I get all sorts of disaparaging comments about how flat I am, or that my curves are gone, men like meat not bones, etc. etc. When I was larger it was complaints about how I'm letting myself go, if I lost weight I could be pretty, what man is going to love me like this. 

The point is that people are always going to judge you and talk smack. As long as you (and your doctor) know that you're healthy, then you keep doing you. Even if you were unhealthy, no one else's opinion matters but yours and your doctor's. Sorry you've been feeling this way, and I hope that you can come to love yourself in spite of all the BS around you."
fatlogic,fddoxrh,t1_fddbg79,1578319967.0,"Right? Disordered eating is way different from a diet. And eating disorders are incredibly uncommon unlike what FAs love to believe. 

0.9% of americans will suffer from anorexia in their lifetime. 1.5% of americans will suffer from bulimia. And a big shocker to all the obese people out there claiming to have BED, only 2.8% of americans suffer from it. With 70% obesity, but 2.8% BED, there's quite a disparity, meaning that a large portion of obese people are simply the way they are because they don't want to stop eating, not because of some mental illness that they can't stop eating."

fatlogic,fd3vqh4,t3_ejwt2k,1578162055.0,"I actually agree with part of this. My parents liked to spoil me when I was a little girl, but as my weight went up I was put on a diet (doctor ordered) but my parents started shaming me for the habits they instilled in me. This led me to start binging in secret since I was 6 years old and I still do it many many years later as an adult. Binging obviously led to weight gain and only recently when I moved away was I able to lose from morbidly obese to slightly overweight. Shame is really good at perpetuating binge eating."
fatlogic,fcqzjcf,t3_eiii15,1577894549.0,I was obese less than a year ago for many many years. I think I still haven’t forgotten what that was like. Sometimes I wake up and I’m still confused and weirded by my new body. I may look thinner but in my mind I’m still the fatty from before so I absolutely can “fatsplain” what you’re going through.
loseit,fcqxerk,t1_fcod3ap,1577893666.0,"If he doesn’t exercise at all, 5-6 sounds like way too much to jump right into. I think focusing on his eating habits for a few weeks and then introducing 2-3 days for a few weeks would make it easier to not burn out. Then every couple of weeks gradually add one more exercise day. It’s a marathon, not a sprint and introducing too many changes at once is overwhelming and he’d be more prone to giving up. Good luck!"
loseit,fcobfxm,t3_ei7jc4,1577828148.0,"4000 sounds way too high. While it generally isn’t safe for people to make huge deficits and lose weight rapidly, for larger individuals it’s not as risky because they’re still eating quite a lot. I think 2500 is a ton of food (if you’re choosing nutritious things of course) and he can feel plenty satisfied with 2500 calories of vegetables, healthy fats, protein, and grains. I’m doing 1200 calories a day and I’m having smoothies and protein powder, an assload of egg whites, chicken breasts, quinoa, yogurt everyday and it’s hard to actually jam in all those calories even at 1200. If you’re really that worried about creating too big of a deficit (even though 2500 would be plenty assuming no exercise) 3000 would be reasonable for your friend as well. Weight loss is rapid for obese people at first but it slows down significantly. The first 20 pounds fall of way more easily than the last 5."
loseit,fckublq,t3_ehg689,1577733357.0,"i suffer from bulimia and some of my weight was lost because of disordered eating and unhealthy behaviors. i just don’t beat myself up over those moments and try better next time. meal prep helps me actually eat all my calories and keeping junk food out of the house prevents my binging. if i want ice cream i have 1 ice cream cone in a parlor. if i want chips, i buy a single serving and eat them at work or walking through the city. if i want mcdonald’s i get a small fries and 4 pc chicken nugget. it’s important to not deprive because for me that’s when the moments of desperation and weakness come through. weighing yourself once a week is also helpful, though i admit i can’t bring myself to do that. i still have disordered tendencies and if i don’t weigh myself at least once a day i’m too afraid to eat anything. that’s bad and you shouldn’t do that. also telling someone about your issues might help. they can hold you accountable and question your lack of eating or over exercising or whatever it may be. good luck and take care!"

loseit,fcksa9w,t1_fckdira,1577732100.0,"you can keep a chipotle order at less than that and have it be pretty tasty. my order is usually a salad (no dressing because all the other stuff is pretty flavorful)

i pick black beans (130kcal) 
steak (150) 
mild salsa (25) and medium (15) 
and fajita veggies (20)

it’s super flavorful, filling, and with a dash of chipotle tabasco it’s already making my mouth water for a meal only 345 calories. you can swap the beans for rice (210) and have it at 425, but i wouldn’t do both rice and beans, but that’s just because my tdee is pretty low on days i don’t exercise at ~1600 and I’m trying to keep a deficit of 400-500 for 1100-1200 calories.

also a hamburger at mcdonald’s is 250 calories, a side salad is 15 and if you bring your own vinaigrette from home that’s about 100 cal for a serving so you’d get a meal for 365 calories. 

grilled chicken wrap at wendy’s for 300 and a side salad again for 115 with dressing for 415 calories. 

shake shack or five guys order a burger pull of the bun or wrap it in lettuce with all the veggies for about 250 calories.

fatlogic,fcfawyz,t1_fcav95p,1577628195.0,"the post has a fair point. moralizing food like this can create unhealthy relationships and this is something super important that you learn in therapy for EDs. it’s better to look at what nutrients can pizza provide, portion it into amounts that satisfy your hunger, and complement it with whatever you might be missing (like a salad for veggies). marking foods as healthy vs unhealthy is a common thing for people with EDs and any consumption of food deemed as “unhealthy” even in reasonable quantities feels like a moral failure and like something that should be punished with restriction/purging. i think this post is something taken from ED recovery and misconstrued as Fatlogic."
fatlogic,fcfa1tr,t3_egy9h4,1577627933.0,"in my time at an ed program this isn’t something we’d say because even ranking in nutrients is creating an unhealthy comparison. pizza meets several components, a carb, a fat, and a protein. you can eat a slice or two and be satiated, however you should complement it with a salad as a complete meal and get your veggies in. 

a salad is a vegetable, and a fat (dressing) but you need to complement it with a carb (croutons?) and a protein (boiled egg? grilled chicken?) to make it a meal. decomposing a meal into what it provides, portioning it out into a sufficient but not over indulgent amount, and complementing it with whatever it might lack is the healthiest way to look at food."
