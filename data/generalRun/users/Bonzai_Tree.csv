Ended up getting super infected, one time where I had to take antibiotics to get rid of enough infection before the podiatrist would touch it. 

You will never fix it with force, only make it worse. Trust me. Try this tip (Haven't tried it yet) or just be careful how you cut your toenails (straight and flat, don't curve!) and if one starts getting ingrown, be gentle to it and your body will probably fix it on its own. Otherwise, I've found cutting a small v in the middle of the nail (suggested by the podiatrist) helps encourage it to grow out normally. Done it before and it seems to work!"

Then I there was a drummer that gave advice (I forget who, think it was maybe from the DrummerTalk podcast) about accepting compliments gracefully.

WTF,fcyt7xm,t1_fcyd3us,1578086567.0,"I had a somewhat similar thing happen once--I stopped at a marked crosswalk to let two kids cross the road. This dickhead POS in a big truck decides he's too good to wait for traffic and rips full speed down the shoulder instead. I see him coming in my mirrors just as the two kids are about to pass my car right into him and lay on my horn and wave and shout at the kids to stop. Thankfully they noticed me and the truck flew by literally a foot or so from them.

&#x200B;

I was so pissed I almost followed the guy home--he knew he fucked up and was booking it away. And by the time he turned off I had cooled down enough I just kept going home. But that guy almost killed two kids.

&#x200B;

Sad part is, people do that ALL THE TIME there--in the sense of driving on the shoulder to get around stopped cars that are 99% of the time turning left. I always thought they were assholes doing so but that time really scared me. I'm just glad the kids stopped and looked instead of sped up when I honked."

gatekeeping,fcphoq9,t1_fcpdv63,1577864557.0,It might not be possible on modern manual cars with lockouts but lockouts weren't always a thing--also just accidentally shifting from 3rd to 2nd instead of 4th can still happen and it's a terrible terrible terrible feeling.

gatekeeping,fcphgtf,t1_fcpe407,1577864255.0,"Yes! All of my cars I've owned have been stick. When I drive automatics now, it feels so odd! I don't like it moving forward on its own, not being able to ""engine brake"" to slow down and coast, and just feels so herky jerky to me when braking, etc. -- not to mention the pause before downshifting when I want power (the autos I do end up driving are econoboxes, not using nicely tuned sport transmissions)."
gatekeeping,fcphbb4,t1_fcp7t90,1577864050.0,"You absolutely don't NEED to drive manual and I 100% understand why most people have no interest or desire in it. But just because it's not for you doesn't mean it's useless.

It's fun and engaing for some people (like me). I don't find it a pain in the ass, I find it fun and find it makes driving a more engaging, visceral experience that I have more control over. Some people view cars as just appliances made to make getting from point A to B as easily as possible and that's fine! Some driving enthusiasts might still prefer automatics and that's fine too. 

But I wouldn't completely write off manual transmissions just because you don't pefer them."

My first car was a 2002 Honda Accord Coupe (with about 250,000km on it) that I paid cash for. It was a manual--and I didn't know how to drive stick and neither did my parents. I had one buddy drive it home for me (horribly) and then I literally just watched youtube videos and practiced engaging first, driving forward, switching to reverse, etc. etc.

&#x200B;

Then once I was comfortable switching to first and reverse without stalling, I started taking it around the block. You figure it out pretty quick! It's not that scary once you try, as long as you give yourself some time.

I'm now on my third car, and my third manual transmission--but I'm a car nut and just prefer them."
