politics,fgu0a1g,t1_fgtzxpf,1581111675.0,"So black people should be given money for some of their ancestors being slaves. But whites shouldn’t be punished because some of their ancestors owned slaves. 

I’m not sure I follow the logic there. Either living people are responsible for their ancestors choices or not."
politics,fgtyhxi,t1_fgtx6dy,1581111014.0,">	Well, for one, the parties switched platforms a few decades ago - your argument is a non-starter. It’d be more honest to say that *conservatives* supported slavery.

Nope. Your logic dictates once a bigot always a bigot, regardless of switching platforms. Don’t move the goalposts now. Democrats are the side that supported slavery. Sorry that contradicts for ideological identity.

>	Though no, I’m not talking about distrusting people due to the actions of their ancestors. I’m talking about distrusting people due to shit they themselves did.

For the record, I agree with this - which is exactly why I don’t believe living white people should be chastised or punished for slavery."
politics,fgtwr2r,t1_fgtv6we,1581110381.0,"

>	not someone who hurriedly changed public policies to look better.

Like Democrats did after they lost the Civil War. 

Everyone says “tHeY SwiTChEd PLaTfOrMs” when in reality they just changed their tune because they got egg on their face supporting slavery and losing the CW.

So by your logic, all Democrats are canceled since they supported slavery."

This. Is. Not. Proof.


I won’t read the rest of the wall of text, because you’ve clearly made up your mind that the accused are automatically guilty. 

Which is ironic coming from a child rapist like you."
worldpolitics,fgqp3u1,t1_fgql7yu,1581028535.0,"Thanks for your response. Sorry if I sounded snarky, I didn’t expect a level-headed reply. I think you and I agree on just about every point you made.

My main point was Trump has plenty wrong with him that cheating on his wife should hardly register (although I agree it’s wrong). But again, I appreciate your elaboration on your side of things."

>	Tell me, was OJ guilty of murder? He was never convicted in a criminal trial. I’m sure you tell your other buddies he’s innocent all the time.

Yeah he’s innocent. He wasn’t found guilty... and since you are innocent til proven guilty... do I need to spell that out slowly? Accuser is not synonymous with victim.

We don’t call people guilty just because they are accused. I can’t just call you a child rapist and have it be real.

You’re clearly upset. Do yourself a favor, sit this one out. Just breathe. You don’t have to let this ruin your day."

worldpolitics,fgqjshf,t1_fgqildb,1581025549.0,"So you made claim that Brett Kavanaugh was a rapist. But the article says nothing about a conviction. Nothing was ever proven, so he’s innocent.

Do you know what “allegation” means? I think it’s a 9th grade word. Use Google to look that up next, might help you from embarrassing yourself in the future :)"
