I’ve been lucky enough to go through this kind of healing with my parents while everyone’s still alive... and while it’s a rough process, even the non specific unprompted acknowledgement of the harm done, whether intentional or not, begins the healing.  My sister and my reactions when our parents did an official “we’re sorry” speech was figuratively just like tahani and kamilah’s."
personalfinance,fg8vxxj,t3_exkcsj,1580630471.0,"Worth noting that this type of scam happens with accommodation sites as well... hotels aren’t always good about securing their platform passwords, and so if an attacker gets into their system (which is surprisingly common these days) they then have the private information of every guest.  If someone calls you telling you to pay over the phone in advance, hang up and call the hotel from a publicly listed number."

Composition,fewxtn5,t3_eqt53y,1579421149.0,"Well, it depends on what strings you’re playing on.  So open 5th (c/g/d/a on viola and g/d/a/e) is easiest... and then anything which is open on the lower register and not open (so think 5+ intervals) are easy as well.  Then non open  intervals that are 5+ are too... but depends on whether the sequences are easy to get to from one to another.  And finally. Seconds and thirds and tritones are doable, but the ease depends on where."

taiwan,feg0fy1,t1_fefo5pi,1579071666.0,I didn’t see it as losing or winning Chinese American votes... I saw it as more an identification as “other” in white voters... to make a strong stand in line with his identity.  It’s the same as when Kennedy ran for office: he had to disavow his Catholic identity and proclaim his allegiance to the United States instead of the Pope.
taiwan,feexs4m,t3_eojqc9,1579043540.0,"To be fair to Yang...  I'm pretty pro-Independence Taiwanese (by ethnicity) American, but if I were running for President of the United States, the *last* thing I'd want to do would be to tweet anything about Taiwan, because all that would do is call to attention the fact that my family *isn't from the U.S.*  ...and from a foreign policy perspective I'd be super careful to not ""rock the boat"" to avoid accusations of placing a Taiwanese allegiance above an American one.

changemyview,feedqnj,t1_fed8620,1579031653.0,"The thing I'm finding in this discussion seems to be a complete lack of empathetic language.  Sure, it takes discipline.  But it takes different amounts of discipline for different people, and it's not fair for everyone to be  judged equally.  It's like if we were all playing a game, but some are playing on easy mode and others on hard mode, and we give the same amount of ridicule for low scores despite which one it is.

The discussion I keep seeing focuses on the raw score (i.e. whether one is obese or not), rather than on the struggles that one may need to take to get there, and I think the point of the body-acceptance movement is to try to give some emotional space for people, so that their struggles aren't invalidated.  


As an anecdote, my mother had a a tumor in her thyroid, and had to have it removed.  The way that she regulated her weight, then, was to slip some extra thyroxine.  Does her weight then, have anything to do with her ""discipline""?  Absolutely not.  If she stopped taking the pills and stopped eating, she would still get fat!  She'd also just have no energy to do anything, and die of starvation while becoming fat.

It's not fair to judge people with metabolic disorders, or antidepressants that cause metabolic issues, and since we can't differentiate based on looks alone, I think it's worthwhile to have some empathy and step back from the overt judgement."
Stormlight_Archive,fe1ky1r,t1_fdzsy7t,1578827800.0,"One thing I found in reread later was the observation that it felt a lot like a screenplay.  I was able to imagine framing and paint a picture in my head of the action, but it was my painting and not necessarily his."

todayilearned,fdsjgc8,t1_fdsdxnp,1578703909.0,"""Intent"" is kind of a tricky translation to use, though.  Because when you say ""intend"" people think ""I didn't /intend/ to cause X"" ...whereas the meaning of intend here is the ""I did a deliberate action, of consequence I may not know.""

Because in this particular case the people at hand /intended/ to ""save lives.""  But their actual deliberate actions were 1. Exchange money for custody of the animals, 2. Put the animals in an ocean.

When I originally wanted to study this, I thought that the wording and what direct meanings of words were seemed to be tricky, and really open to misinterpretation.  So I figured I'd have to learn Pali before I could truly understand the teachings in full.  Suffice to say I'm no longer going that route..."

taiwan,fdlxg57,t3_em29xg,1578534817.0,">Maybe by residents of Kaoshiong who voted for Han of CPP after decades of DPP mayorship. See what they have to say after Han took office and the developments have happened since. 

My family is from Kaohsiung.  Many of them voted for Han in the Mayoral election.  Many of the ones that voted for him will not be voting for him for president.  Taking a holiday to avoid answering questions is not leadership.  Immediately jetting off to run for President after promising to focus on Kaohsiung is not leadership.

Not saying that Tsai Ing-Wen is the paragon of virtue, but to say that all of the media that's come out to the west is misinformation?  That's definitely a stretch.

You know what the biggest fear my extended family has?  It's China.  It's being absorbed into the one country two systems model.  And the KMT party list being occupied by China reunification sympathizers is scaring them.

Han isn't like Trump.  Han is a lot more like Sarah Palin.  Big on the buzzwords, but he hasn't exactly given any detail on exactly how he's to be measured, and is immediately running for an office he's not qualified to serve."
