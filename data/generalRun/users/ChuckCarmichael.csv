So the nursing home put a fake bus stop in the yard. When one of those old people with dementia decides they want to either go home or go shopping in the city, they first run into this bus stop.

Why did she shorten it, probably knowing that it's gonna spell gibberish, and that, as a person in the public eye, she's gonna be ridiculed when she has a tattoo that spells gibberish?

So she started to get the tattoo, and she probably noticed right away that she's not as pain resistant as she thought she was. Did she stop? No, for some reason she kept going, knowing that there are a whole lot more symbols to come. I assume after the first symbol was done she had realized that she wouldn't be able to push through, so for some reason she decided to just leave out some symbols, as if that would still be fine, in a script that is notorious for being turned into bad tattoos that mean something completely different to what they're supposed to.

That argument is so ridiculous. When I played through Sword I was constantly buying new Pokeballs because there were so many different Pokemon I had to catch.

Als ich damit fertig war, habe ich, anstatt mit dem zweiten Band weiterzumachen, mit dem deutschen Herr der Ringe-Hörspiel angefangen. Es wurde natürlich sehr viel gekürzt, aber das ist verständlich. Die Musik ist manchmal etwas merkwürdig. Die Abmischung ist gelegentlich nicht ganz optimal, so dass man in einigen Szenen kaum etwas versteht, und manche Sprecher klingen recht gleich, sodass man manchmal nicht weiß, wer da gerade eigentlich spricht.

I read about this a while ago, but to put it simply, the original version isn't as black and white as the one we saw. In the original, Mewtwo was really angry and confused over just being a cloning experiment, so he decided that clones are superior to the originals. Mew meanwhile decided that all clones are evil and must be destroyed. 4kids didn't like that there was no obvious villain and no obvious hero, so they removed the parts that made viewers feel sympathy with Mewtwo and turned him into an evil monster who wants to conquer the world. In the original, both Mewtwo and Mew realize at the end that all life is precious. 4kids changed the moral to ""fighting is bad"", which is just stupid since the whole franchise is based on fighting."
