JUSTNOFAMILY,ffmg2oq,t3_eu3dca,1580054211.0,"Let me preface this by saying that my family situation is nothing like yours. But my mom does a similar thing where she would rather treat the high maintenance/shitty/quick to complain people in a way that will minimize conflict than treat the people who are good to her and stand by her the way they deserve. This is one of our biggest points of contention, as I am the latter and my brother is often the former.

From that perspective, I’ll I’ve ever wanted is for my mother to acknowledge what she’s doing, apologize for it, and then stop the behavior. I would never want her out of my life, and definitely not dead!

Another commenter suggested letters and I think that now you are cutting off 6, letters could be an excellent way to acknowledge and apologize. Just make sure not to violate the trust you build back by letting 6 back in.

Regarding 6, it sounds like she was always this way. That is not your fault. What is your fault is how you have made your other children feel, and that’s what you need to fix.

Lastly, I don’t know what your other views are, but if someone made homophobic comments towards me and my parents didn’t intervene, I would feel like they shared the sentiment but were just polite enough not to say it. Accepting 5 means standing up for him and his husband 

Best of luck, OP. I know it’s hard, but believe in you. Just do the work and it’ll get better"
simpleliving,ffirr7i,t3_etsgph,1579981070.0,Oof this is hard. I would be in the same boat but was lucky enough to end up with someone who shares my dream and makes much more money than me. But my best recommendation is to start breaking into networks. Both virtual and real. There’s a lot of us who can’t afford our own land but if we pool resources we can! My partner and I are buying a house with friends
bridezillas,ff7zzrk,t1_ff71d8r,1579662439.0,I hope it was more of a “I’m asking in the hopes you’ll confirm to me that this is not ok” because otherwise yikes
somethingimade,ff4lr7m,t1_ff0fpgg,1579566680.0,I love that! I do the same with vegetarian meals :D
somethingimade,fepltoe,t1_fepg044,1579323893.0,Thank you! I’m vegetarian and love making substitutes for furs!
AmItheAsshole,fensnii,t3_eq24av,1579290109.0,"ESH. Your sister sounds like a horrible person, but there are also lots of issues with what you did.

1) These are cosmetic surgeries, but they’re still medical history with implications for mental health history as well, and that is not your place to share about anybody, ever, unless they are in danger and it’s directly relevant.

2) Even if it was ok to share people’s private medical information, it wasn’t a good way to handle this situation. Would it have been ok to say those things about the waitress if she hadn’t had surgery? What if you didn’t think the waitress was ugly? Kindness is kindness, regardless of who is speaking and who is being spoken to, and that’s where the focus should have stayed"

weddingshaming,femvp2m,t1_femmcaw,1579270849.0,"Honestly as someone for whom family situations can be hot or cold... if you star your time as family with them using you as a doormat, things will not get better. Better strained than shat on, every time."
AmItheAsshole,fe2u41f,t3_enm4dc,1578842859.0,NTA - she’s a racist and good on you for standing up with yourself. And honestly if my friends treated me like the asshole after I experienced discrimination I would be taking a hard look at my friendships
Agriculture,fdqc6bp,t3_emcecu,1578662681.0,"If it’s not commodity prices for grain, maybe it’s the wet year we had? Horses are MUCH more sensitive to mold than other animals so perhaps there was storage difficulties for horse feed this year? Or maybe they’re just ripping you off. Really not sure!"
JUSTNOFAMILY,fdk2dzy,t3_elqwgr,1578494373.0,I was so confused at first because MLM means “men loving men” in the LGBTQ community xD but toned and flexible blood vessels is hilarious
