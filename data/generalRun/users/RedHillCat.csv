PersonalFinanceCanada,ffawkb5,t3_esezlv,1579746153.0,"Yes, you can.
Although, you can always call them I ask.
I bought a laptop in the same way, and they said it wont be a problem."
aww,fenhrdh,t1_fen6ys9,1579284958.0,"Interesting.  
I believed that 99% of people actually put boots/clothes just because of hype, fashion or whatever else and not because they noticed their pet really needs it. Had no idea that dogs especially can be really that sensitive. Good to know!"
DunderMifflin,femaqix,t3_epnvv9,1579246302.0,"Well, thanks a lot for the spoiler.
You just ruined my 18th watching of the show.."
aww,fema5pr,t1_fem9igr,1579245570.0,"Yeah, hot pavement make sense. I read something about it..

Interesting.. I always had a perception till now, that these are animals, they dont need extra layers.. 
You know, because our parents, grandparents would never ever come up with that idea, so why would we do it now?
But yes, if dog is visibly uncomfortable, shivering or cold, I would get him a coat for sure.
Thanks for your explanation."
aww,fem95bn,t1_felpuwb,1579244355.0,"Out of curiosity ,
are short haired dogs really cold during winter/rain? I never had a dog..

When I was in USA, and was raining, a lady was walking her dog (similar size or a bit smaller), The dog had all paws in some kind of rubbery boots.. It was in the nature, not the city. Even our american guide, rolled his eyes and started to laugh when he saw a dog in boots."
aww,fem8crt,t3_epu04u,1579243454.0,"More, please"
PersonalFinanceCanada,felzej0,t1_felrblj,1579234921.0,"Can you clarify?

I don't have a job experience yet. If I stay in Canada, first I have to find a job and work for one year to be able to apply for PR.If I get a job outside, say USA, work few years there then I may apply for PR with job experience outside Canada.. Or second solution would be to find employer in Canada who would appreciate my skills from previous job, get work permit, and then PR."
PersonalFinanceCanada,felm82l,t1_feliskg,1579225528.0,Perfect! Thanks!
PersonalFinanceCanada,felfndh,t1_felc1fs,1579221050.0,"Sweet! This helps a lot!  
So you think my tuition tax credits are of the same value as credits from a PR or a Canadian citizen? I was afraid maybe as an international student, I might have less rights to claim them if I leave Canada.  
I will try to check it with CRA when the time comes, if I get them on the phone."
PersonalFinanceCanada,felaftq,t1_fel8v9k,1579217598.0,"Thanks for the link. Unfortunately, it does not give an answer to my question."
NintendoSwitchDeals,fefamx2,t1_fef9xx8,1579052105.0,"Ah... It was set to toycon.. no wonder no controls worked.. I made it! Finally! No game broke my brain as this 2 dollar game! Now all my buttons in the main menu work. before, I had to scroll with left-right arrows because it were the only buttons that worked. Thanks man!!!"
NintendoSwitchDeals,fef9xx8,t1_fef8ilt,1579051645.0,"Yeah, no. My switch is complete opposite.. Back and forth.. What would you use on the phone to accelerate or brake for any other game, on switch lite it goes left and right.. And it is NOT super sensitive, so at some point you cant even see the screen properly because you are turning left/right. Hahahah"
NintendoSwitchDeals,fef705d,t1_fddglta,1579049674.0,"I gave it a shot and downloaded game again for the same price. You were right, it does work!!!So if you want to turn left, you need to push top of the switch away from yourself, and if you want to turn right, you need to pull top of the switch towards yourself. Or the opposite.. I find this weird because I cant see the screen when i move the screen away from my eyesight. Its more natural to lean it left-right. Is it same with you?"

I will keep my money with EQ."
NintendoSwitchDeals,fdd34e0,t1_fdcznz5,1578292838.0,"I knew that but it really didnt work. I cannot explain. I even tried to calibrate it, but still didnt work"
NintendoSwitchDeals,fdcxymg,t1_fdcxejl,1578287622.0,"Hm, that's interesting. Thanks for letting me know.   
I tried to enter the game at least 10 times, and everytime it would ask for an external controller. However, I did manage to enter into the game, but none of the buttons worked.. The bike would just go by itself and crash."
NintendoSwitchDeals,fdcvh8r,t1_fdcuy24,1578285480.0,"No, but I called Nintendo and got a refund. You need external controller for it."
