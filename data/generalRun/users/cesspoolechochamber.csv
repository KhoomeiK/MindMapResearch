europe,fftcdgc,t1_fftbtvs,1580216272.0,A Brit calling America a 3rd world country? Try not to get shivved in the wrong part of the UK where your NHS didn't do a great job of providing first world healthcare. Basically anywhere outside of the big cities. 1776 and back to back champs(You're welcome).
ABoringDystopia,ffrmk3j,t3_eurs4p,1580161142.0,Let's compare the US to a mostly homogeneous country with 1% of the US's population.
todayilearned,ffq0mi2,t1_ffpffo6,1580113927.0,"Not all progress is good. It's selfish to expect other people to pay for your mistakes via loan forgiveness proposed by Bernie. Taxpayers should not pay for someone's bad investment. Bernie's ""progress"" is loose redistribution. Sorry, but I can't get behind stealing even if it's stealing from people who are envied by the public for their wealth."
todayilearned,ffpb7h5,t1_ffp7eot,1580090711.0,Natives owned slaves. Union wanted to free those slaves. Natives did not.
dadswhodidnotwantpets,ff1dzq1,t1_ff0pb8e,1579477971.0,"You're right. Wrong wording, but replace negative reinforcement with punishment and the message is the same. They can't comprehend why they're being punished."
dadswhodidnotwantpets,fezsojh,t1_fez72mo,1579461149.0,Negative reinforcement doesn't work with cats. They don't understand why they're being sprayed because they don't make the connection. They just see that a person is doing something to them which is harmful and it makes them want to avoid that person. Good way to make your cat fear/hate you if you do it enough.
SandersForPresident,fezs28k,t1_fewsevm,1579460918.0,"How come when Bernie holds the same views for 50 years he's progressive, but when other people his age do it, they're considered archaic and stuck in their ways?"
facepalm,fezqc1w,t1_fezkuxb,1579460316.0,Your country polices speech because it believes the individual is incapable of rationality. That's why the first amendment exists. We believe in the individual instead of the collective in America. Very different from homogeneous European countries. Funny part is what is happening to Europe as you take on people who might be a darker shade compared to what you're all used to.
greentext,fewepau,t1_few5x7z,1579409349.0,"It's not breeding out desirable traits. It's telling someone to not have kids if they're financially unstable. Not having money isn't an undesirable trait. It's their situation. It can be changed by working harder and motivating themselves to earn more so that they can provide for their family instead of blaming capitalism for their fault. Now saying that communists and anarchists should not be allowed to have kids would be eugenics, since every one of them has some kind of mental deficiency."

OurPresident,fecltix,t1_fe5hvc3,1578977091.0,"You don't. Many degrees have a great return on investment and if you seek a degree in a field that has little to no value compared to what you paid for then that is your fault. Other people shouldn't be forced to pay for exploration into fields that the market doesn't care about. 

This student debt issue is how it points to the sheer amount of people in the US that the government(taypayers) would be paying for to pursue useless degrees. I guess there's a good side to everything."
OurPresident,fe4ld06,t1_fe449n3,1578860536.0,"It's been 6 years and you only managed to pay down 3k of your loan? You know degrees are an investment, right?"
HongKong,fdxkniy,t1_fdxfonp,1578769805.0,Communism can only exist under an authoritarian government at that scale.
MadeMeSmile,fdp2ct0,t1_fdokvw1,1578618345.0,"Now they do. They've criticized it in the past questioning whether it's effective. The past is what matters, since it's a preventative measure. They can claim they support it now after the damage has been done, but that means very little."
aww,fdp0hmx,t1_fdl744g,1578617089.0,"I'd assume those cases are the minority as the increase in self-diagnosed anxiety has increased as technology has advanced leading to more teenagers sitting in front of a screen to avoid socializing with others. Yes, there are people who have anxiety in the way that some people have depression and they need medication or therapy to treat it, but someone who closes themselves off from the world is only going to prolong their own suffering."

todayilearned,fdmnzqd,t1_fdmjucs,1578557441.0,"You weren't a coward when they gave you all those tax dollars and you willfully agreed to pay it back. You are, however, a coward now as you blame someone else for those debts."

MurderedByWords,fdktjso,t1_fdks1eq,1578510855.0,"Did CNN, MSNBC, ABC, or any of the other alphabets choosing to outrage your side tell you to say that, or are you just compensating for your own bias?"
TechNewsToday,fdkt3td,t1_fdkoz0p,1578510591.0,"The supercharger network is terrible if you don't live in a place like California, and even then it's garbage if you don't live near the city. Of course Tesla has less incentive to put superchargers in reasonable spots along the highway where very few people occupy, but that's one of the major reasons I think many people should hold off on buying a Tesla. The infrastructure is objectively bad when compared to the cost and availability of storing and buying gasoline."
aww,fdkq2y0,t1_fdklzrq,1578508795.0,You get over anxiety by exposing yourself to situations that make you uncomfortable and learning that it's okay to feel that way. Continuing to hide away from the world because you are afraid of that one feeling will just exacerbate the loneliness that I assume is a product of the first problem.
SandersForPresident,fd74ss7,t1_fd5vcdu,1578199435.0,">Inequality is so severe these days that the rich people and companies pay less in tax percentage than normal citizens! 

This isn't true and lying about this kind of stuff is only going to kill his chances at winning. That post history makes you out to be a shill. Hopefully your employer doesn't see how bad of a job you're doing."
PublicFreakout,fcyw6xf,t1_fcynjd7,1578088418.0,This has to be Reddit's understanding of how investment works. Explains the deep hatred for anyone that isn't a bum asking for UBI or someone stuck working min-wage because they cannot apply themselves to something better.
PublicFreakout,fcyvdbu,t1_fcyuob8,1578087897.0,"No, he's saying that if you aren't willing to give up your wealth then you're a hypocrite for criticizing others. Don't hold others to expectations that you are unwilling to meet."
DesignPorn,fcyuex3,t1_fcymkas,1578087303.0,The only reason the natives didn't extinct other tribes is because they were too primitive. Don't kid yourself into thinking they were a peaceful people.

todayilearned,fctr4oo,t1_fctmhoz,1577955194.0,I don't see how that's depressing. Why should everyone receive above the bare minimum if there are people only willing to put the bare minimum into society? I see that as encouraging as it means there's more for people who try to achieve something above the minimum.
todayilearned,fctcbla,t1_fctbnex,1577938819.0,"Even then you cannot win. Thankfully, not enough people are as delusional as you. America is not Cold War era USSR. We aren't starving or in extreme poverty because of the government. Masses aren't willing to take up arms against the government because, despite how much they might say they hate it or blame it, they understand that they aren't being oppressed by it."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcs48os,t1_fcs0ahg,1577911241.0,"He's generalizing Chinese people based on where they come from and using ""culture"" as an excuse. You're the moron avoiding logic because you're so adverse to criticism."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fcru1q5,t1_fcrk2t2,1577906613.0,Chinese is a race. American is not. Generalizing people based on race is racist. Don't try to backpedal like a bitch because someone called you out for it.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fco45xt,t1_fco17xc,1577823739.0,"It's the same reason people are more open to saying things on the internet anonymously that they wouldn't repeat if the person knew who they were. It's not about what they feel is disgusting, but how other people will judge them."
JusticeServed,fco1a6t,t1_fcmmpoq,1577822272.0,"You have no clue what you're talking about. Law enforcement budgets are continuously cut while people complain about quotas and you are also criticizing their ability to send all those resources to try and box in a suspect? If someone is willing to go on a high speed chase they aren't going to just sit there and go the speed limit as they see police cars trying to surround them.

Not Edit: This dude crashed his car in an accident and didn't make an attempt to **intentionally** crash his car into the people trying to stop him from making a run from it. So yes, it does apply. I know it's very hard for people like you to use critical thinking while trying your damnedest to make up reasons to hate police, but there are so many other instances you could go after. Grasping at straws with this one."
JusticeServed,fcmm9w1,t1_fcmkmxa,1577781300.0,"Someone driving around the speed limit and not willing to crash his car is a lot easier to stop than someone trying to evade police going double the speed limit. At least be reasonable when trying to shit on cops, idiot."
