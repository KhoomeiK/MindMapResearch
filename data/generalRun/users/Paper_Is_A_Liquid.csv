In the same way, you using that word may have made other people in the place you posted uncomfortable, which is why they made that mistake. 

And I'm not gonna say ""quit whining"", I think if anyone IS saying you can't have dysphoria if you have a smaller chest then they're wrong. But give yourself the freedom to enjoy your chest for what it is without getting so hung up on it looking the same as other trans men's chests - the artwork often features DI either because the artist themselves had/wants/needs DI, or simply because the noticeable scarring makes it clearer to the viewer that the person is trans and that the artwork is representing that. Besides, people don't choose DI because of how the scarring looks.

fatlogic,feysbj8,t1_fe5xbrb,1579449997.0,"Hey! Sorry, didn't see this until now. 

The way trans-related healthcare clinics can be bigoted or gatekeep is the way they ""judge"" who is or isn't trans based on things that have little or nothing to do with it. There's one particular clinic in my country with this reputation; some examples from friends who've gone there would be claiming that a trans man was ""faking it"" simply because he likes wearing earrings, that nonbinary people must be or want to be completely androgynous in order to actually be nonbinary, and that ALL trans binary people (so MtF or FtM) must want to have ALL surgeries available to them, otherwise they're ""not really trans"". 

So just very stereotyped stuff, often rooted in HEAVY gender stereotyping and the idea that trans people are all the same and must all want the same thing in order to be ""real"". It's just sad that the people who've been put in positions of power over the healthcare that we have access to can still be so ignorant of our community or what it means to be trans."

The other played flute

They looked very similar, yes, but the one who spent time outside, did sports and played the drums was taller, had slightly lighter-coloured hair and wider shoulders. The one who spent time indoors and played flute had sharper facial features and was skinnier.

Their differences weren't extreme; you could definitely tell they were twins, but these multiple, subtle differences meant that you COULD tell them apart if you payed attention"

> I think that Whittaker's Doctor could be as good as, or better than, Tennant's if the writers and showrunners start showing massive improvement. The storylines all through the 13th Doctor's first season were just messy. They also seemed like they were trying to hard to push current events into the story lines.

This I 100% agree with. It's so disappointing to see so much wasted potential. I genuinely believe she could have some of the best Doctor Who episodes yet if everything else wasn't such a car-crash that she's having to navigate. Even in the new series, they've had a WHOLE YEAR to work on this and it's just not good. The first episode was.. pretty ok. The second was good, *bordering* on great imo (but again, given that they took a whole year to work on it, I would've hoped for better). And then the third episode, the most recent, was a fucking dumpster fire.

*sigh*. I've never taken a break from DW before, even during Capaldi's first season when a lot of people backed out for a while, but I'm probably gonna give the rest of this season a miss unless I hear that it's improved."

You could also shade the sides of your head - the area just in front of your ears, where sideburns would be. This can make your jawline and facial features appear sharper, which can also help.
