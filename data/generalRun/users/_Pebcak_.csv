Well done :)"

AmItheAsshole,ffck6j2,t1_ffc6zdh,1579801199.0,"I agree with this...I had a job once where I really thought I *was* doing all that I could, and when a position came to go from part-time, to full-time, I applied.  During my interview they said all this stuff about how they didn't know if I could handle all these other responsibilities b/c I barely did anything as it was (they said it much more politically correct but that's what it boiled down to) and I wrote this huge response back about how I was so sorry, I honestly had no idea b/c nobody had ever told me otherwise, etc.  I immediately started doing more, improved performance, and they gave me the position.  All it took was feedback that I now wonder if I'd ever have gotten if I didn't apply for that job."

I'm in my 30s and I still don't have any idea why.  I'm outgoing, and very open-minded.  And, it's funny b/c to look at me I seem like I have a lot of friends, like I'm popular, well-liked, etc...but nope, no.  I'm more often than not at home alone doing nothing wishing I was out doing something with some friends.  You know, the type of friend who thinks of *you* first, the type of friend where you're not the afterthought, you're the first thought, like ""Omg we have to go together, Pebcak!"" not ""We should all go...oh yeah, Pebcak you can come too if you want.""  Oh cool I made myself sad.  Guess I'll just go drive home from work now."

Parenting,ff9699g,t1_ff8qeba,1579705830.0,"That's true, but even that is a lot of 'luck of the draw' type thing.  My SIL had premie twins at 26 weeks; as of now they both appear to be growing normally and developing normally on the adjusted scale.  Time will tell though; they can't test everything until they age more.  Even still, issues can range from mild learning disabilities to total blindness.  (They are not blind; that's been tested for already.)"
TalesFromRetail,ff72c8b,t3_eryg0c,1579639717.0,">I should also note that i only got paid up until the store closed, so all the end of day banking and other jobs were effectively in my own time.

Wait, wtf?  How is this legal?  What if something happened to you while you were doing the banking bits, store insurance-wise?  Like we weren't allowed to bring the nightly deposit down to the drop box or to the bank without being on the clock!!  I'm flabbergasted!"
