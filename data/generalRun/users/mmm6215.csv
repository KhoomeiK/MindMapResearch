Guitar,fecyp8g,t3_eohwo0,1578990132.0,"Standard tuning (Top to bottom) is E, A, D, G, B, E. Thickest string is on top, skinniest on bottom. The symbols you are referring to are # (sharp) and that little ""b"" is (flat) neither should be present for standard tuning. Tightness of strings depends on how thick your strings are. Aka ""string gauge"". And the length of your guitar aka ""scale length"". You could also have a really fat neck (lol), but I don't know what kind of guitar you have, so maybe it's not small hands, but it might be. As far as strumming goes, it kinda comes naturally, just get a clean consistent strum, you'll soon realize there is a difference in upstroke and downstroke, and most songs are not just up or down but a mixture of both! 

I don't really know any songs, mary had a little lamb? That's no fun. I've been playing by ear forever now (NOT RECOMMENDED) and have been writing my own material, I did start with basic chords, (C, D, and G) and then A and E, the ""F"" and ""B"" are the hardest but also the most important chords to learn, as it will open the fretboard up for you. But that's a little later. Just learn C,D, and G, then A, and E, also learn the ""minor"" version of each chord. 

Plastic and metal? Sounds like a classical guitar to me. Now listen closely, you're finger tips won't hurt as much, due to the fact it has ""plastic"" strings, but they usually don't stay in tune well, and the strings are usually really high off the fretboard. That usually discourages new guitarist, but don't quit. Play it, learn on it, the harder your first guitar is to play, the more you'll appreciate a newer nicer guitar. If you like classic rock get an electric guitar, if you like folk music, get an acoustic. You'll eventually have 10 guitars, all with there own purpose, it's an addiction I know. I will say, never buy new guitars, it's a waste of money. Buy used, and $200 will get you a decent guitar, keep playing and you'll know a decent guitar when you play one!

Over all just have fun man, it's hard at first, but it'll change your life, it saved mine. Hope I helped a little. Good luck!"
