No we are not winning the trade war every single one of those tariffs backfires on the American people, tariffs have been shown to not work. 

Oh you mean like how he avoided conflict when he allowed hundreds of Kurds to die and accidentally release Isis soldiers, or when he Assassinated an Iranian official, pulled out of the arms deal, and almost sparked a nuclear war with Iran, oh this ones my favorite, how about when he withheld military aid from Ukraine so that they would be forced to investigate Biden lest they remain liable to Russian attack. You know what’s even more humorous about this, is that they all happened in less than a Year!"
teenagers,ffj3igt,t1_ffj0etu,1579989462.0,"First off the economy hasn’t gotten better other than the Dow, and as I stated previously the national debt has increased 3 trillion dollars, so any economic success(that even so was a trend that continued from the Obama admin) is going to be drastically short lived. This also combines nicely with the fact that the minimum wage is unlivable, and 8 people hold more wealth than the bottom 50% combined, and the class divide is growing rapidly as the cost of living is increasing exponentially and wages are well... not.

2, I live in an area with a large illegal immigrant population and I have yet to see any difference in the numbers, neither has my father, who deals with ICE on a daily basis. But even if the border was more secure, that’s no excuse for treating children like dogs and letting them die in fucking kennels. Children (might I add) who did not come here by themselves. A four year old cannot be charged with any crimes under federal law, so we just lock them up until their old enough? No. That in and of itself is a violation of human rights.

3. What the fuck are you on about? If anything we’re withholding money from people we are allied with (see the fucking impeachment trial? That’s literally what it’s about) also we aren’t about to go to war with anyone, and we haven’t officially been to war since WW2, and guess who gave those countries their weaponry (I’ll give you a hint, it was Reagan). And the reason we were nearing war? Because Trump pulled out of the arms agreement, and attacked an Iranian official without any evidence for his reasoning. Sure he deserved to die, but that doesn’t mean there’s not going to be massive backlash because of it.

I don’t know if you know this,  but you are A not rich enough for any of trumps policies to benefit you economically, and B completely incompetent in understanding foreign affairs. And considering that actual Americans are no longer the priority of the White House, your are not just worse off, but delusion in saying that Trump has benefited Americans."

Bare in mind I was not yet born at this time so this is from what I have gathered from stories from the people at his office, The opposition to Graham had obtained (through means I am not aware of) pictures of Graham and his fuck buddy (a guy), now at this time the release of these photos would greatly influence that election. But, in a rather stoic turn of events the candidate decided that it would be unfair to leak the photos. They were shredded. I wonder how the world would be different if that decision wasn’t made.

environment,fenwd09,t1_fenqib1,1579291820.0," the electoral college is literally a form of Gerrymandering. Instead of taking people’s votes into account, they choose who has the most and that state becomes that color even if its 49/50. They then will get a disproportionate amount of votes in the electoral college compared to how many people live there and or actually voted for whoever. 

What you then get is land voting, and people’s votes being changed because slightly more people voted red than blue, or blue than red. 
I say that their vote is being changed, because they are then represented as whatever the slight majority may be, even if a considerable portion are not that.

Then because of this system, the people aren’t accurately represented, and that’s how a dictatorship starts."

me_irl,fdp2eae,t1_fdoph9p,1578618373.0,"Hmm interesting, because according to CNBC the cut off in America for the 1% classification is $421,926 while the average income for the 1% is $1.32 million. 

But no, a “regular office job” as in average, as in most people have, that meaning that more than 50% of people have that absolutely definitely qualify them as the 1% because that’s certainly how math works where 50%of the population fits into the 1% of income. If you think I’m pulling that number out of my ass, the median income in 2017 was $59,000, meaning that this is the middle most income, ie, the 50% mark exactly. But I guess the us census bureau isn’t a credible source.

Now I know your probably talking world wide, but I’m talking in America, and I don’t mean to startle you but while you might be rich compared to a Somali pirate, you certainly are not compared to Bill gates.

And I really really really want to put this in perspective for you, the cut off for the one percent is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars range. But the average income is in the millions, and the richest people have incomes in the billions. The wage gap in the 1% is gigantic, yet you look at these numbers and see that people are literally living on seven dollars an hour. 

But anything other than supporting the rich is communism and is against America’s values on which it was founded so that the poor wouldn’t be exploited by the rich."
