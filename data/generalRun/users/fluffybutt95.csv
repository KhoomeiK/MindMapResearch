depression,fej2r0i,t1_fej0tz3,1579154726.0,"Well, I have been on pills for one year. I started feeling better so I stopped using. I scored 27 on a 30 point depression test before pills. Seeking professional help isn't a bad idea, however I delat with it on my own. I think the first step is being honest with yourself and figuring out what is the main source of your depression. Is it existential crisis or body image related or any other reason and only than you can start figuring out your way out of it. It's the rotten and disfigured logic that's killing you. Therapists often tell you to change the way you are thinking and I can confirm that that works. You might think that what you feel is true or genuine but it's not. You have to doubt your depression and whatever it creates. After a decade you might want to seek professional help."
depression,fehs02y,t3_ep78py,1579122713.0,"I can say that once you get rid of depression, you can finally experience genuine sadness which is a totally different experience. Also, all the twisted logic and rotten thinking is gone. Just knowing that depression is gone is an empowering feeling. If you need any advice just ask me. I'll help as much as I can."

GearVR,fe6lwcr,t1_fe6ls2b,1578895324.0,Good. I believe quest has support for steam vr but I'm  not sure.
GearVR,fe6lq89,t1_fe6k7sl,1578895143.0,"I'm sorry dude. It's  ik because gear vr is a dead platform. You are not missing anything special. Also, you have to buy almost every app. The free ones are usually short or trash."
GearVR,fe6k4wb,t1_fe6ie8n,1578893534.0,Yeah I'm not sure about note 10. I think only the last version supports it

TooAfraidToAsk,fculxkf,t3_eiwrjk,1577983868.0,"I think it's about the cause of your depression. The ""You are beautiful"" means nothing to a person with existential crisis."
