depression,ffbd059,t3_esbfsf,1579760170.0,"Its your choice. I'm not going to be a hypocrite and sit here telling you not to kill yourself. Our society is totally socially dysfunctional. People don't give a damn about you and then suddenly freak out when you say you want to end it. But they're the ones who drove you to this point. Why listen to them? Every single person in this thread is just whoring for karma. I guarantee you they don't give one honest fuck about anyone but themselves.

Its ironic. We have police officers who will literally kill you just to stop you from killing yourself. All of this is done under a Christian flag in a Christian nation because people are too stupid to understand what Jesus really said. These people mindlessly vote in Trump and even think he's a Christian.

I'm unemployed, soon to be homeless, unable to keep friends because of my own mental illness. I was just hanging out with a guy last night who is homeless himself. Last night I drove the guy back to his van that he's sleeping in, and the police were staking it out to catch him sleeping there. That's our tax dollars at work.

That should tell you exactly how much all of these hypocrites care about you.

13 years ago when I graduated college, I was dating a cougar at that time. I confessed my depression to her and she said that ""things will get better"". But of course nothing has gotten better for me since then. I later found out she was even cheating on me at the time. But when you are trash, like me, its okay for the real members of society to hurt you. They've earned that right. You're gonna have to beg for everything in life, and when you beg, you get the scraps.

I have to go through the daily torture of seeing the happy families and lives of everyone on social media. Meanwhile I have nothing. If I try to call my parents they just want to explain to me why I shouldn't be depressed. They are absolutely incapable of listening or showing any sympathy. Their only concern is in pretending to be good parents. My mother thinks she loves. She buys me candy every year for Christmas, but it's the candy she likes. She doesn't even know what kind of candy I actually like and she's so self-centered that she doesn't bother to ask.

If you decide to go through with it, you're a brave person. I'm too much of a coward. I still love life, even as shitty as it is. I like to look at the clouds. I think the world is beautiful and appreciate it even when I feel completely cold and dead.

To be honest, I feel like existence is worse than people think. Like, even suicide isn't an escape. Maybe you'll just be reborn into a life that's even worse. The only thing to do is grit your teeth and persist in suffering, quietly cursing society, not too loudly, because there's always someone there with a stick to beat you back into line."

A law can't be bad simply because it was racist in the past. One must argue that it is racist today, and not merely on the basis that it was racist in the past. This follows simply from the nature of change. Things change over time. If, for example, I had a picture of a tree which was taken in 1900, I would not expect that I would automatically find that tree there when I visit the site the picture was taken today.

Likewise, historical arguments, even about offensive words, are really just religious in nature. We should use racial epithets to the point that they become ubiquitous, because then they will no longer be offensive.

If we want to deuniversalize whiteness, we must treat it as a valid culture, in which case we must allow and even personally participate in celebrations of our whiteness and white culture, our white heritage, etc. This creates a distinction between what is white and what is universal. But that's the exact thing we refuse to do... the solution to racism is the most racist thing.

Yes, this is the exact opposite of what you've learned in your High-School understanding of tolerance and racism, but it's the truth, the inverted world.

> Personally, I think the merits of repealing primarily have to do with plea bargaining. Prosecutor's can use that fact that only 10 of 12 are required to convict to scare/coerce defendants into pleaing, even if prosecutor's have a weaker case that, in other states, defendant's may try and go to trial against.

The law, in the present day, certainly saves the government money. That money, just as in any other monetary calculation by government, is and can be weighed against the innocents who are wrongly convicted. That money, in the budget model of Government, comes from other services which benefit people. Therefore it is people vs people in the final analysis. Once again, the conventional wisdom falls flat.

> The second merit is just that if non-unanimous juries aren't good enough for murder trials (as OR tacitly admits, since they don't have them for murder cases) then they shouldn't be good enough for other cases, especially when many other charges can carry as much time as a murder conviction.

Here, I must admit, there is a discrepancy. But I would advocate requiring non-unanimous juries for murder as well. This way we can have the requisite consistency."

I personally believe that when you die, you're born into a new universe. Ancient Greek philosophers were able to show that a person cannot think ""nothing"". They also showed that the metaphysical existence of change in the universe is contingent on something called a ""generic set"". But this generic set is a set of all differences. Differences are what are necessary to think. If you think, you are. Dying is precisely the moment when you are able to think nothing. This is unavoidably a change. Therefore the generic set must exist at the moment of death, therefore you can think, therefore you are. But the event of death itself is necessary, and we know that nobody who dies returns.

Prosecutors also need to stop turning a blind eye to verbal assault that is otherwise mixed in with lawful protests. It's one thing to show up to protest an event.

I also hope you aren't interpreting my post as saying that we *should* ignore warning signs, etc. What I am saying is that despite this man's actions he is also a victim. Even if you say he's a victim of his own stupidity, he's a victim. It's utopian to pretend that society can escape such tragedies.

If, however, you do *actually* resolve to understand why such a thing can happen, victim blaming isn't a useful approach. The doctrine of personal responsibility is a dead end because it essentially just says that the person made a choice, and by definition choices cannot be analyzed as deterministic events. If we are to create a policy which addresses the problem, we must *not* see it in terms of personal responsibility and instead see it as a result of certain deficits in society.

A more mundane example, though, would be the mere fact that we all drive 5-10 mph over the speed limit. Statistically, this ensures we are more likely to be injured in crashes.

It's just a sad fact about our culture today that we don't show proper sympathy and support to young men. This lack of support is reflected in suicide rates and the rise of groups like PUAs, Incels, Nice Guys, etc.

The ideologically misogynistic groups, and their feminist critics, are both caught up in a rationalist worldview that simply isn't supported by modern cognitive science (or even many philosophers, for that matter). The reality of these group identities is that people join them and participate in them for emotional and personal reasons and only adopt the ideological viewpoints as a justification. It follows that, while it is valid to attack the ideology itself on the basis of reason, it is not valid to turn these attacks on the members themselves, because they do not participate for that reason. It is just like voicing your complaints about Amazon.com to a random customer service representative. That's simply the way our social structure is organized today."

It could quite simply be a matter of technique. Or it could be that this particular girl just doesn't like that particular thing. As you grow up you will experience the displeasure of others performing sex acts on you that you dislike, and you'll realize this is simultaneously not a big deal and also something that is potentially a big turn off for your partner. Men are not immune to such experiences. I've had my share of pain and turn offs: women folding my erect penis in half, women carelessly smashing my balls with their thighs, women shoving it inside when they are dry as a whistle and damn near giving me a circumcision. I once had a woman put her fingers in my mouth and stretch my cheeks open in an incredibly painful, random act. I've had women finger my anus too. None of these things turned me on and some of them were quite upsetting. But the nice thing is these women didn't try these things again because I told them.

So I think you should thank your girlfriend for telling you. It shows that the two of you can communicate, which is a good start to a happy relationship."

Don't put any food in your house, or within your eyesight, that you don't plan to eat. It isn't just willpower. You need to help yourself by planning that out in advance. I, personally, don't have any alcohol, cookies, soda, candy, snacks, etc. anywhere in my apartment. That way, I simply cannot reach out and start eating them when I'm bored.

I've never had a weight problem, but I decided to lose a little weight recently, and I've discovered a few ""tricks"" so to speak. One of them is bacon. The thing about bacon is it is very unhealthy, but it is also a very satisfying food. At least for me, if I eat nothing but two slices of bacon for breakfast, I am not hungry until lunch. Another trick is fruit. I found that when I drank soda, or ate candy or snacks like chips, I didn't feel satisfied and just keep eating. I've actually eaten a whole box of cheez-its or a whole pint of Ben and Jerry's in one sitting before (marijuana may have been involved). Eventually I noticed that if instead I ate an apple, I would be quite content afterwards. It seems that our brains are bad at telling us the thing we actually want to eat. So my system now is to keep a supply of fruit and carrots. If I want to snack, I reach for one, and I never end up eating more than one per day. I also found that by keeping myself busy, I naturally don't feel so hungry. Finally, I realized that my habit of getting seconds, or always ""cleaning my plate"" was pointless. I bought tupperware containers and started putting away leftovers to eat later.

Apologies in advance if none of this would work for you or if you think I'm not taking you seriously. Good luck!"

To me, it sounds like your therapist is not providing you with appropriate treatment. PTSD is not something you forgive yourself for. Your brain is stuck in a loop where you refuse to let yourself recall the event fully but paradoxically want to recall it. Forgiving yourself is not a simple choice -- it's a matter of exploring the details of the situation in an emotionally calm and rational way, so that you can realize, at a deep level, that it doesn't make you a bad person today. It's like putting yourself into the flow of time, so that  the past becomes history so to speak.

Just think about what responsibility is. It isn't as simple as ""not making excuses"". You need to discover the reasons for your actions so that you don't make the same mistake again.  It's also a way to be able to tell if you're at risk of making that mistake again. Sometimes, when you first think of something, it seems like just an excuse, which is why you need to really think about it, which is hard if it is something horrible that you'd rather not think about."
