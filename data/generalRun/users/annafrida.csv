Instagramreality,ffxulmh,t1_ffwxi00,1580332730.0,He clearly suffers from wavy arm disease.  He caught it from the window blinds behind him.
My600lbLife,ffk4sbx,t1_ffjmdik,1580015849.0,"He did, but at 900lbs it seemed like it should’ve been WAY beyond just starting.  It looked like what you see on someone ~400lbs"
dogs,ffh323s,t1_ffgzoe0,1579921768.0,"My dog is dog reactive.  We have very strict careful training protocol that my dog has learned well.  A key part of that is us being able to maintain adequate distance from other dogs.  Some people around us have dogs they let out off leash all the time.  They’re all friendly dogs, but them running up to my dog sets him off BIG TIME.  It can become an unsafe situation very quickly, and while I have my dog under control on a two-point leash I obviously can’t control the other dog.  I can only hope they respond to my dog’s many signals of “do not approach me.”  It’s terrifying for me and for my dog, because as this strange dog is running up I don’t know if there’s about to be a fight like what OP experienced or not. 

I’m active in the reactive dogs subreddit and this is a very common complaint there. I hope you’ll reconsider letting your dog off leash/run up to other dogs out of consideration not only for other dog’s sake, but for the safety of your own dog."

RoomPorn,ff9ji5c,t1_ff9j7vn,1579714335.0,He’s making a joke that the floor was made with herring (the fish).
minnesota,ff8i9xd,t1_ff8fvis,1579679729.0,"Regarding the mall stores it’s important to note that there’s multiples of lots of stores in the mall.  Like there’s literally 4 Lids stores.  Only a small amount of the stores are unique to MOA/the only location in the state.  So yeah def nothing special.

It’s the other activities and attractions that make it worth it, like you said."
femalefashionadvice,ff812zl,t1_ff7wl6o,1579663226.0,I find that sports bras meant for high impact tend to feel more suffocating.  Medium to low impact ones tend to be much more comfortable!
