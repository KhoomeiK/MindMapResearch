leagueoflegends,ffk39vl,t1_ffjcup4,1580014473.0,I'm ecstatic froggen and aphromoo are on the same team. Less 5eams to cheer for
leagueoflegends,ffjzyis,t1_ffjcykh,1580011622.0,Shot caller on froggens team is the dream tbh
leagueoflegends,ffjvpje,t1_ffjegk1,1580008251.0,It's funny how true that is. You see any anivia flair and you can with a 99 percent certainty assume they cheer for W.E team froggens on. This coming from a froggen fan.
todayilearned,ffjvjbp,t1_ffisiw5,1580008116.0,I was talking about how there's a bunch of universitys that have adapted it for real life play. It's tackle and they run around with broomsticks in between their legs. It's pretty funny. A few guys from my rugby team are on a team.
leagueoflegends,ffjvbef,t1_ffjk3sr,1580007945.0,Man he was showing a cheese as fuck Draven jungle strat the other day lol. Pink gromp stand behind wall build stacks forever as it resets. Throw ult when you see low target.
leagueoflegends,ffjv4es,t1_ffjdymg,1580007795.0,I loved tabzz playstyle I was upset he left. High mechanics as well.
todayilearned,ffirc6f,t1_ffik148,1579980774.0,The irl version is a lot more balanced. Jk Rowling obviously didn't know much about balance in sports
nba,ffib0qw,t1_ffh8ley,1579969585.0,Put in your bets now +3000 is a steal especially when considering 76ers are +1000 lol (last time I checked)
torontoraptors,ffi6nv1,t1_ffh9cm7,1579966501.0,Nah Celtics beat heat and lose to the pelicans and 76ers
nba,ffi4v2y,t1_ffhtnbz,1579965130.0,He's not bad at passing he just is really good at scoring without passing.
torontoraptors,ffhinub,t1_ffh5a1o,1579936979.0,Yeah but we need better first quarter in the playoffs we need a fix this shit now
torontoraptors,ffhii4x,t1_ffh5lia,1579936771.0,Honestly kawhi would have broken that

torontoraptors,ffflw46,t1_fffhvfl,1579886780.0,The dudes pretty thick I wouldn't waste any more effort man. Saying 100 percent alone is stupid as fuck in basketball. Or professional sports in general. Case and point sun's beating Goldenstate last year lol. Or Tennessee taking out both ne and Baltimore.
torontoraptors,fffl3el,t1_fff7r7g,1579886292.0,As long as they don't go to ot. They almost lost to the kings and wizards.

videos,ffey63z,t1_ffeh86b,1579870110.0,He knew what would happen he was filming and called the dog back. Probably knew it wasn't venomous cause he wouldn't risk his dog like that. Fuck that guy
videos,ffexryw,t1_ffepgrb,1579869725.0,Uhh he goaded his dog to do that. He called it back and said I can't walk past this snake ho dee dum. Dude is a straight up pick.
videos,ffexmt0,t1_ffdk3xz,1579869581.0,No this dudes an ashhole the snake was fine

torontoraptors,ffbdl6e,t1_ffbc3gg,1579760814.0,Powells hand came down and smacked him. Nothing sinister. Just 3 or 4 people jumping for a board.
torontoraptors,ffao5s3,t1_ffao1xl,1579740544.0,Just nose shouldn't be an issue
nba,ff8uaw6,t1_ff7ydzb,1579696331.0,I still remember last year when he caught it one hand into the dunk. Looked like he caught it like a baseball https://youtu.be/AHis_8W3LkA
politics,ff7xsz4,t1_ff7qcgl,1579660906.0,He also goes on to ask what if he had been aborted.... It's a nice hypothetical
nba,ff7iep0,t1_ff6x3mf,1579650274.0,Which isn't unreasonable in the slightest
torontoraptors,ff7b7hr,t1_ff56wvx,1579645287.0,I know Miami has a relatively tough schedule coming up they have Celtics and clippers before the 3rd and 76ers on the 3rd.
torontoraptors,ff7alho,t1_ff703qq,1579644733.0,Hey better now they learn how to deal with it then the playoffs.
television,ff77jcj,t1_ff3dj24,1579642663.0,Well it's a good thing they crushed it with doom patrol
toptalent,ff758bb,t1_ff63zmb,1579641370.0,Ehh arm wrestling is a lot of technique. Notice how extended his arm is and close her elbow is to the body? Yeah that leverage changes the match drastically.
NatureIsFuckingLit,ff5fq8g,t1_ff4sker,1579590889.0,I mean not really people hunt them all the time when they are in season.
torontoraptors,ff5e0r6,t1_ff549wc,1579588906.0,Probably to due with the alleged rape.
nba,ff5czua,t1_ff4h8bf,1579587789.0,Well maybe we can see how he handles playoffs next year?
nba,ff3jkp5,t1_ff1xjbg,1579542419.0,Just need okc to lose more so jv and deebo can be in the playoffs
leagueoflegends,ff30s59,t1_ff2qm8v,1579530612.0,Ehh singed goal wasn't to die just be a nuisance and pin the other top laner to the lane. He just happened to die a lot.
movies,ff2vhsu,t1_ff2sqqq,1579525748.0,People definitely recognize Luke. Probably a lot don't realize they're brothers though
movies,ff2vdn6,t1_ff2mq1c,1579525627.0,Hey Ben can act. Gone girl. The town. The accountant.
movies,ff2vaji,t1_ff294et,1579525538.0,Never knew about him or seen any of his movies really may have to check them out. Also realized after learning all his sisters names as well their parents were very liberal with their naming of kids.
movies,ff2utjy,t1_ff2bqun,1579525025.0,Yeah that movie was fantastic. Topher grace also surprised me in that

nba,ff01s5k,t1_fezntef,1579464284.0,Nah I think kawhi will stay for a while barring any major injury. He takes care of it enough he will be able to continue to play for at least 5 years
nba,fezmv3b,t1_fewltgv,1579459133.0,Nah I don't think lebron will let his skills diminish. He wants to leave when he's still top of the league.
nba,fezlsl4,t1_fezdtta,1579458758.0,I mean it's just like standing across from LeBron you're probably not gonna win. Nowadays there are great players that can hold there own but that's cause he's aged but is still pretty dominant
nba,fezk3mn,t1_fez9t9j,1579458181.0,Yeah but he'd still beat my ass in ball
torontoraptors,fevm2id,t1_fevlgxk,1579398954.0,He's on restricted minutes. Coach doesn't want him to reaggrevate his injury
torontoraptors,fevlybw,t1_fevlhoh,1579398912.0,This year? Maybe not with the games he's missed
torontoraptors,fevfiw9,t1_fevf34q,1579396822.0,Early and they are running hot we aren't falling behind too much so we'll be fine
torontoraptors,fevduwz,t1_fetsr06,1579396285.0,I mean he'd probably fare fine in LA but yeah he definitely needs a upper end city to flourish. But the multiculturalism in Toronto definitely makes it probably the best for him.
torontoraptors,fevd9kg,t1_feuausp,1579396033.0,I want someone to photoshop space jam with raptors players rather than mj and Co. And make the ball Fred's baby.
nba,fevchzc,t1_fev74rr,1579395788.0,How am I crying lol. I'm just stating facts.
nba,fev3hki,t1_fev2p0o,1579392654.0,Most raptors are still fans. A few spurs. But joining the clippers doesn't help selling jerseys lol
politics,feutsd6,t1_feur00h,1579389817.0,If I'm going to trust anyone it's Bernie because he's walked the walk and talked the talk his entire political career. He doesn't seem like a person that would say that. I don't have the same faith in Warren.
AskReddit,feup9f0,t1_ferdzqu,1579388717.0,This game is really easy on your phone

nba,feltwul,t1_fejbu76,1579230835.0,It will make future coaches and gms reconsider trying it though
torontoraptors,fekb621,t1_fejwog2,1579196385.0,Pretty sure statistics say having him on your team = championship who wouldn't take him
netflix,fejjls1,t1_fej389t,1579176989.0,Interesting enough the same actor played manson in once upon a time in Hollywood
AskReddit,fegezlv,t1_feg1xk9,1579090485.0,Honestly just hop bank vault to bank vault everything concealed and take some money. Not enough that it gets noticed quickly. Spend it and live life a lot easier.
torontoraptors,fegeniw,t1_fedykmr,1579090131.0,Yeah also I want the spurs and grizzlies to make playoffs so taking down okc is the easiest way to make that happen.
television,fefi3ua,t1_feffgbk,1579056786.0,You left out viggo

AskReddit,fe08kat,t1_fe07apc,1578806009.0,You can't will it but you can certainly avoid getting one/making it go down with some concentration
confession,fdxo4ob,t1_fdwr19r,1578771139.0,I mean generally you're right about that but.... 3 of these have a good shot that you'd be fucked the next day. https://laughingsquid.com/snake-venom-worlds-strongest-beer/
confession,fdxnsnt,t1_fdweimx,1578771004.0,"Dude had 3 beers I doubt they stayed up past 12 and he was probably drinking those beers over the course of a few hours nursing them. Then he has sleep time. Also they don't breathalyze every person, they only do that if they think you've been drinking. U turning is a bad idea cause they definitely will breathalyze you. Just go through and act normal. Maybe pop a piece of gum if you're worried."
aww,fdq66l3,t1_fdptjy5,1578656606.0,Likely a lot of these cases were ignoring fire bans and such and not directly meant to inflict harm just stupidity.
nba,fdm6nt8,t1_fdm42nv,1578541103.0,I mean you can fuck around with a hurt shoulder it'll. Just be easier to reinjure. If you cant run well or reinjure your legs you're pretty useless on the court.
worldnews,fdlh2tu,t1_fdldjxv,1578523870.0,Bagels and cream cheese croissants are all fine. Frozen lemonade in the summer is also good.
AMA,fdix3qn,t1_fdhkoh6,1578453022.0,Put fresh pineapple on it and it's delicious. It's just the canned shit tastes weird.

torontoraptors,fdi7eiw,t1_fdhoylj,1578437059.0,Oh man I've had my shoulder pop out a few times during sex. From flipping into a lake. Playing ping pong. Sleeping with my hands behind my head. Yeah it's 100 percent something you manage. Currently I've built up the strength quite a bit in the gym but I still won't throw anything overhand. And have to be very careful on my bench/shoulder press progression to not fuck it up.
torontoraptors,fdgkfk4,t1_fd5aciu,1578400285.0,Adrenaline is a hell of a drug
nba,fdggazb,t1_fdfhoo4,1578395495.0,Yeah I've never dislocated one but I did tear a tendon once in my pinky. The worst part is the rehab to make your finger straight again. Wasn't painful at all. Actually took me a while to even realise it was fucked
movies,fdgfmyk,t1_fdgcbwd,1578394598.0,I think that choice was made cause heath died wasn't it? I thought it was only supposed to be heath.

torontoraptors,fd3f84d,t1_fd022vn,1578157697.0,Like maybe 5? He never really got a ton of minutes or shooting opportunities I don't know why people keep using him as someone were missing

NatureIsFuckingLit,fcxlzi4,t1_fcwu230,1578066146.0,Likely just the camera lense
running,fcx75wg,t1_fcvwxdv,1578053990.0,Yeah I think that only worked for a short time before the tigers wondered why all this food is walking backwards.
running,fcx6st6,t1_fcw4i77,1578053586.0,Skunks will hiss at you first. Spraying is their last line of defence.
