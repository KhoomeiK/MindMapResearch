TikTokCringe,fdwdkxf,t3_en3r7m,1578757618.0,"From what ive heard this is the only subreddit that is “bullying” him. But I dont think it’s bullying solely because this subreddit is dedicated to cringy Tik Tok and he just fits in. I can’t speak for TikTok and i’m not sure if Redditors are harassing him on the app, which I hope you guys arent doing. But DevilSeam if you are reading this, we talk shit about all the cringy videos on the sub. Especially the really ones, like the “are you a poopy stinky baby.” This is the internet and if you post something online, its gonna spread to other places. If you are a reddit user then just block this sub, since its the source of all your problems. I highly doubt you can sue this subreddit or its member because they trash talk you. 

Or you could just stop making cringy content, and it won’t get posted here anymore."
