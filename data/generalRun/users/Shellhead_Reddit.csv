getdisciplined,fel8m26,t1_fel8ezo,1579216426.0,"Wait, what are your fitness goals? 

Me personally, I want to have a swimmers body like Micheal Phelps. I don't want to get muscles to the point that they are a bulge, you know. Like body builders. I just want to be tall and big, without the fat of most body builders. Search micheal phelps body."
getdisciplined,fel85t2,t1_fel7k0k,1579216140.0,"4 hours wow! Everyday! You would get some insane gains with that, i bet. 17 here too! Happy late birthday. But dude sleep is where the growth happens, not at the gym right. 6.5 hours, you don't think that's a bit too little? Like I know some people who say its good and all and saves time but those people that say that are like adults who have grown already. We are in the stage of growing, bro, we need lots of sleep."
getdisciplined,fel6ys7,t1_fel4oy0,1579215391.0,"So I'm assuming you get off from work at around 5pm, right? If that is so, you would only like 2-3 hours to yourself because to get at least 8-9 hours, you would need to sleep at 7pm or 8pm. Do do you use that last couple of hours? 

&#x200B;

Me personally, I wakeup at 5 to swim and be at school by 8am. Then school ends at 2pm and I have 2pm- 8pm to work homework assignments, reading a book, eating dinner. 

  
Also, you workout 2 hours? How do you have that much power?"
getdisciplined,fel4gr6,t1_fejoc3m,1579213854.0,"I wake up at 5am and thinking of waking up at 4am in order to get an extra hour for swimming. What does your schedule look like? Ill be honest, I'm in love with mine."

Don't ""make breakfast"" and order a cake. Make yourself oatmeal and eat that. This meal will keep you full until lunch and you will have the energy to make lunch or dinner."

getdisciplined,fdcv0wh,t1_fdcr3c1,1578285104.0,We should totally do a group chat! Maybe on a website that is not known for being addicting haha.
getdisciplined,fdcuw4a,t1_fdcsng6,1578284996.0,"I used to play clash royale too I remember playing it with my friends in middle school and it was so fun (all games have a time period when it is actually fun) but after middle school (that was like 2-3 years ago) everybody in my group stopped playing it. I continued to play through high school at random times (when I was having an existential crisis I would download the game and play nonstop until 5am in the morning) and these last 6 months I came to a realization hat I wasn't playing because I enjoyed the game but rather because I was merely addicted to it. Soon after that realization I quite gaming one by one. 

Also, I was into photography last year and I took this class in school and our project was to focus on a problem in the current world. You know, like poverty and racism and stuff like that. I was concerned more about internet addiction/ ""Technology addiction"" as I called it in my project but when I was presenting it was clear that most of the students and parents had a problem with this too. I was trying to get an outside of school project going where I would hand out informational pamphlets about technology addiction and how to snap out of it but the people who I asked for help (friends) weren't interested and soon enough I fell into another existential crisis and I was addicted for like the rest of the school year. This thing is actually crazy. 

As for your question about how freedom feels like, all I have to say is it feels like god opened a part of my brain and now I see the world clearly(sorry, didn't want to bring religion into this). It's like the whole enlightenment time period in history, that's what it feels like. Getting these realizations and being like ""ohhhhhh, yeah that is so true"". Like now If I look back and see my bad habits (like watching porn, masturbation, staring at a screen all day, doing nothing else everyday) I see that they were actually harmful to me. I feel this weight lifted off my back. I feel like time is more controllable and it moves to my command (crazy idea lol but it actually feels like that because my time management skills are getting better) . 

I do feel empty sometimes because I'm still in the first couple of months of sticking to this routine and that's to be expected. I can say that in the morning I have no time to feel empty, or during school, but after school there is time to ""feel"" so sometimes I feel bored or empty but only when I decide to eat lunch without putting on my favorite TV show (Person of Interest, Netflix) or (Friends, Netlix). I just watch like 30 minutes while I eat my food and I'm good for the day. 

Send me a message, we should talk more. Sorry for the essay haha."
getdisciplined,fdcs4b1,t1_fdcrg4o,1578282727.0,"I miss the good old ""cell phone"" times. My aunt had this nokia phone and I think that's what phones were supposed to become, not what they are now. I like this freedom from the cellphone. Ive been trapped inside the  ""smartphone"" from when I was 10 to now 17, playing mobile games like clash of clans. What about you?"
getdisciplined,fdcqts4,t1_fdcqmkh,1578281753.0,"Basically everything you mentioned in this post!

selfimprovement,fdaydnk,t3_ekf7gd,1578251758.0,"Start by getting yourself a journal, pen on paper is the best way to start. You should make yourself a daily schedule to follow. What you should include in that schedule is up to you but I recommend that you give yourself time to workout, meditate, read a book, and maybe even take up a sport. I do all of these within the first 3 hrs of my day. I wake up at 5am, workout, meditate, make myself oatmeal, and head to my local swimming pool to swim, while reading a book on the day. I do all of this before school starts at 8am in the morning. Message me if you want to talk."
getdisciplined,fd9tgkn,t1_fd9rs3l,1578237840.0,"Actually! When I went to bed last night at like 2am after working on this post and spending some time on Reddit, a genius thought came into my mind. It is like god just opened up a section of my brain or something. I just remembered it right now. Instead of swimming in the afternoon at 2pm, I will wake up at 5am, workout and meditate for an hour, and eat breakfast for like 30 mins, and then traval to my local YMCA at 6:30am, at which point it should allow me 30 minutes to swim before school at 8am. The rest of my afternoon is now opened up! Meaning that I can eat lunch, dinner, clean the house, wash the dishes, and still have about 3-4 hours to do homework until 8pm. This also gives me time to browse reddit during the week! I basically never interacted with the internet during the week."
getdisciplined,fd9qiy5,t1_fd8vii6,1578236716.0,I swim and workout so I 9 hours is a minimum to me. I feel tired even with 9 hours sometimes though so maybe I should aim to get 10 hrs.
getdisciplined,fd6z31x,t1_fd6y5qi,1578197499.0,"People get addicted to even the smallest things that you wouldn't even think off. Like sucking your fingers or squinting even if you can see clearly. Smallest things/reasons. For the **Game** Habitica, you never know what people might get addicted to. Maybe its the focusing too hard on the app and not enough on the task? If your mom says wash the dishes and she gives you like a cookie, you would focus on the cookie while you wash the dishes. It's the same example with this. Do you understand what I mean? Maybe I'm not being clear?"
getdisciplined,fd6tt90,t3_ejg03i,1578195621.0,"I would just like to discuss some things. 

1) Breakfast for you takes 15 minutes? What is your breakfast? It takes me 15 minutes just to make oatmeal and tea and wait another 30 minutes for it to cool down. 

2) How do you manage with 1hr and 30 minutes of h.w? I asked the same question in my post and I just can't seem to work with 1hr 30 minutes. 

3) What are your workout goals? Bulk up, shred, get skinny?"
getdisciplined,fd6rnzz,t1_fd0j8ix,1578194883.0,I like the idea of the Habitica being used early on but I don't think you should really stick to it long term. I saw some guys in this thread recruiting players into their alliance. I just feel something wrong with that but I don't know what. It's like my productivity nuerons are tingling like how spiderman senses danger but I can't pinpoint exaclty what's wrong with that. Maybe its the fact that it's a game that may become addicting over time? Help me out here guys.

selfimprovement,fcisd8k,t3_ehdo0p,1577668672.0,I quit watching porn and fapping altogether this year. I also quit watching TV for hours and hours and playing games. I also broke down my internet addiction and have been wearing my glasses to fix my eyesight caused by these awful addictions.

getdisciplined,fcipc3g,t3_eh9vhi,1577666641.0,"I would recommend you factory reset your phone and uninstall all applications that you dont need in your daily life. For me, I have 3 apps on my phone: Dailer for calling, Clock app for alarms (the one made my Google), and a music app (Mine is YT Music). Nothing else on my phone. The plus to this is that your phone's home screen layout will be clean, you will save more battery, and you wont find yourself addicted to your phone. What, are you gonna get addicted to looking at your alarm/clock? Oh god I hope not!

Edit: u/UpperWash shared something similer to this

""A good book I would encourage is ""Digital Minimalism"" by Cal Newport. Basically, just delete any and everything that truly doesn't add value to your life off your phone, or you can try to do what he suggests and do a full wipe of your phone and install only whats important back on it. Then remove all notifications on EVERYTHING (except maybe calls and such)"""

So many people have been telling me that weed is good since I'm young and dumb(Not directly selling to me, just changing minds) .I categorize it as a pleasure drug  that can have very bad effects if addicted to it.

selfimprovement,fcinler,t3_ehccs7,1577665599.0,"These are the games I used to play: Minecraft, Mobile Legends (League of legends for mobile),Clash of Clans, and Clash Royale. 

I grew over Minecraft and COC and Clash royale but Mobile legends stuck to me until recently and I when I was making my Daily Schedule (When I will swim, eat dinner, play the piano) I was really conflicted because I wanted to put this game into my schedule. I wanted to level up and become one of the best. Then I learned that becoming very good at a game means putting more than 1 hour into the game daily. I didn't have this time! I was planning on spending like 30 minutes at Mobile legends. So it got to me that I would be wasting my time in a virtual world. There is nothing to gain from this game, I told myself. Now, games like chess and checkers increase your mind, but this game Mobile legends is filled with pay to win schemes and addicting interfaces. Not to mention the toxic pro Indonesians who play for 10 hours a day ! (No offense, guys). I realized my 30 minutes of playing a game would be no match for the 10 hours these guys put into the game so I quit. It's much more than that but thats the basic story. 

I would recommend getting a hobby like drawing or swimming. Increase your brain power and your physical capabilities. These gamers might spend 12 hours a day getting good at the virtual world but we are improving in the real world! We are getting smarter and stronger,etc. You know what I mean.

selfimprovement,fcikhnq,t3_ehb4i5,1577664077.0,"I personally do 5/7 days for sports (Swimming), you should consider finding a hobby/sport you love because it keeps you in shape and it keeps all your other habits in check. The healthy diet and much more positive habits come with sports. As for the meditation, I think 10 mins a day is not enough to get a calm state of mind. I give myself 30 minutes after I workout in the morning to meditate. As for reading, I recommend reading this science fiction book called 2001: A space odyssey from Arthur c. Clarke. It's mind boggling! 

Just a few more suggestions:

1) Sleep early and wake up early. Early bird catches the worm works for 99% of the human population. So unless you're part of the 1% of night owls who biologically can't wake up early, then  I recommend you sleep early and wake up early. I sleep at 8pm and wake up at 5am but early is whatever you make of it. For example, I think the people that wake up at 2am are crazy but for them it's early. I might wake up at 5am and you might think that is unreasonable so you can wake up at 7am and that might be your early. 

2) As for the girls problem, I might not be the best person to help with that :)  I can offer some advice but I'm still 17 and working at my social skills myself, even if you might consider me an extrovert if you talked to me."
selfimprovement,fcg6cdj,t3_eh6d32,1577636907.0,"I (17, M) deleted my social media and spent more time with myself and my family and that helped me get out of that trap. I also made a schedule for my schoolwork and outside of school like activities like swimming so I don't have time to think negative thoughts (comparing myself to others). You should give it a try. Hope you the best."
Swimming,fagbkmz,t3_e92xu1,1576047074.0,"I've been swimming for 4 months now and have had this problem numerous times. I believe it is because you exert too much force with your legs/feet with the flippers. Whenever I swim with flippers and I push really hard with my feet, I get a cramp in my lower leg area. I've heard bananas are good for preventing this. I'm not an expert, though, so you should look futhur into this. (I might be wrong, who knows.)"
