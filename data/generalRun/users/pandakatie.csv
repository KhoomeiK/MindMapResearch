For me, personally, watching it made me uncomfortable, and if other people shared my perspective, then I can understand why it wouldn't be nominated.  That's it.  That's my whole opinion on the matter.

vintagelesbians,ffgcnti,t1_ffgbtgj,1579903294.0,"That isn't what I'm saying, no.  All that I'm saying is that I found Anne Lister's perusal of Anne Walker dubious, and that I can understand why GLAAD chose not to award it.  I'm not even saying that I *agree* with them, if that is the reason why the show wasn't awarded."
vintagelesbians,ffgb4iu,t1_ffg9kpb,1579902354.0,"Look, I absolutely love the show.  I love historical dramas anyways, but I will not agree there was nothing suspicious about the way that Anne Lister began the relationship with Ann.  It's been a few months since I've watched it, but Ann was emotionally unstable and deeply lonely.  Anne saw this, and after one meeting decides to stay at home and make Ann Walker her wife.  Attraction is attraction, sure, but it felt to me when I was watching the early episodes that Lister was really pressuring Walker into the relationship.

You don't have to agree with me, and like I said, I liked the show, and by the end of the series I was totally on board with the relationship, but to me, Anne Lister's persuit of Ann Walker wasn't healthy.  It felt like Lister percieved Walker as ""her's"" from extremely early on, before Walker was even aware of her own feelings.  

I appreciate that Lister perused Walker the way that a Victorian man would pursue a woman, but that isn't a high bar.  In the later seasons I felt seen and accurately represented, and I cheered when Walker returned to Lister to get married at the end of the series, but the beginning of their relationship was dubious at best."

I don't think that being gay necessarily means that I reject gender norms any more than being straight means that a person doesn't.  The fact that I'm queer doesn't make my fashion choices any more valid than someone who isn't.

  My ugliest outfit is a t-shirt and jeans, that isn't any different than a ""straightie"" wearing a t-shirt and jeans.  I really like wearing suits, they make me feel powerful, and that is a rejection of gender norms, but plenty cishet women also enjoy wearing suits, and also reject gender norms in the same way.  

On the otherhand, I wear a lot of dresses.  I love dresses.  I don't think that my sexuality means that my choice to wear dresses is more important than a straight person's choice to wear a dress.  

Imo saying that a straight person's best outfit is fundamentally less cool than a gay person's isn't a good look."

If it isn't a problem to habe like stores that exclusively sell Plus Sized fashion, it shouldn't be a problem if stores exclusively sell straight-sized fashion.

As far as I'm aware, Plus Sized exclusive srores began because overweight and obese people were the minority, and stores didn't cater to them because there wasn't enough of a market.  Now that thin people are the minority, why shouldn't we have stores that cater to our body type?  I'm a thin woman.  31 inch bust, 23 inch waist, 32 inch hips.  I'm small.  I find it extremely difficult to shop in stores because the Smalls and even some of the Extra Smalls are too big, because they're made for women with larger breasts/hips.  Asian stores (and incidentally, certain vintage inspired UK stores) fit me correctly, and it isn't a problem if they don't go up to fit all sizes, because stores shouldn't fucking have to.

It isn't a far trip, it is five minutes at *most.*  Even that is pushing it. But I ran there because I was leaving a meeting at 2:10 to go to my 2:20 class, and it was the first day, and I didn't want to be late.  When I made it to my classroom at about 2:14, give or take, and I was super out of breath.  I was so confused, I run longer distances with less trouble all the time.  I sprint up hill with my dog regularly, I'm very active.

In the case of this person, (in armchair psychologist mode) I think it stemmed from him not having his own sense of identity.  He knew he was attracted to men, so he knew he was part of the LGBTQ, so he made that his entire personality because he didn't know what else to be.  When being the most LGBTQ he could wasn't working out for him, he started emulating other people.  He tried to be me, to the extent that he admitted trying to copy the way that I *stand.*  Lesser attempts at his emulation was his adoption of fountain pens (my favourite writing utensil) and his desire to start shopping at my favourite clothing store.  It got to the point where I had to tell him that I wasn't his to replicate, that I wasn't his security blanket, and that he needed to decide for himself who he was.

I've seen hundreds of people say, ""I'm ashamed to admit I like anime because of how anime fans behave.""  Young atheists thrilled by their atheism are mocked even by other atheists.  Women who adore makeup, only watch Beauty Gurus on youtube, and obsess over new products are called vain and stupid.  In my own personal experience, I notice people who base their entire personalities around theatre or dance be heavily mocked, and the same goes for people who base their entire lives around a sport team.

I think the criticisms against sexual/gender minorities is certainly the loudest, but I think it's because those criticisms carry more weight to them.  If you aren't ""gay enough"" you're criticized for conforming to heteronormativity, and if you're ""too gay"" you're criticized for screaming about it.  I'd never criticize someone who fit gay stereotypes naturally, but the problem with the people who base their personality on their sexuality, at least the ones that I've met, is that it isn't natural, it's donned because of the belief that it's how they need to behave in order to be accepted by both the LGBTQ community and society as a whole."

My sister told me not to listen to them, though, she said, ""I like them, but I think you'll be offended by them.""  Of course that was the very reason why I started listening to them.  Don't tell me not to listen to something because I'll get offended, let me figure that out for myself."

I like sci-fi, I like fantasy, and sometimes I just want to put on a movie that makes me go, ""Yay, lasers!  Space!  *Cool!*""

Using nail clippers was a big pain, next time I do it I'm borrowing my roommate's nail scissors because they are much smaller.  I've also used hair scissors (I cut my own bangs), but I don't want to dull the blade.  Also, if your hand slips when using hair scissors, you will seriously cut your hand.  I learned that the hard way."

TrollXChromosomes,felvfv7,t1_feltetd,1579231923.0,"What I always do is just take the shirt into a fabric store or craft store with the shirt or shirts, and just see what I like with it.  For example, I have a white, sleeveless blouse that I gave pearl buttons to.  The pearls are set in ""gold"", they're really cute buttons.  I also have a black, long sleeve button down that I gave these fancy gold buttons with a little fake diamond in the center. 

It's good to bring the shirt with you, because different buttonholes are different sizes, so you can test to make sure the button will fit through, and so you can make sure you buy enough buttons.  

I can't sew much, but I can stitch holes closed and sew buttons."

Oh no, I don't think he meant anything like that!  He's one of the best people I've ever met.  At the time he made the comment we had already been at a party together for a few hours, and everybody else was dressed in t-shirts and jeans, and I was in 1940s style trousers, suspenders and all. 

I just had to wonder if this guy would comment about how I typically dress, with how lovely and kind he is (the guy talks about how he has to repay his emotional debt to his wife after having many late evenings while we were in a play together), what must people less kind than him think about it."
