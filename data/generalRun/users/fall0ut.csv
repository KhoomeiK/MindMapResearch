first, i hate wearing headphones all day.  do you think someone playing games all day is going to enjoy wearing a headset all day.  no.  

next, the most games popular game genres in the US are action, shooter, role-playing, sports, and adventure.  all of those would require physical activity.  no one wants to be standing/moving around all day playing a game.  people want to be lazy and relax on the couch.


driving or flying/cockpit games would be great candidates for vr.  aside from that i feel like it's a huge gimmick.
