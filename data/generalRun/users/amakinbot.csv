IASIP,fg71t7u,t1_fg7007c,1580581999.0,I wasn’t commenting about her character or how funny she is. I think everyone struggles with self-esteem issues and I was saying it broke my heart to see that she felt the need to get work done because I think she’s beautiful.  I never once said she wasn’t funny or how I think her character was based on her appearance. It was a comment about how I was sad to see she struggled with thinking she wasn’t beautiful enough.
IASIP,fg6z0fa,t1_fg6rogl,1580580154.0,"I don’t have any idea the pressures of Hollywood, but I thought she was so beautiful too. Then the last season she got so much work done on her face it made her almost look like a different person. It makes me sad that she felt she needed the work done."
justneckbeardthings,fg6xc24,t1_fg5ls2b,1580579052.0,"Yea, just because someone is overweight with a beard and/or fedora doesn’t mean to me they are     a neck beard. IMO it’s all about people with personalities that are a complete dumpster fire. When I was in high school in the 90s there were so many dudes who loved samurai swords, metal and anime and they were decent dudes. Regardless of if they were tall and lanky or short and stout, anyone has the potential to be a shitbird. I understand the term was coined for people who liked a particular list of things AND were pretentious  weirdos. I just hope we can give people the benefit of the doubt first. If they truly are neckbeard material, it’ll shine through like a beacon."

FoodPorn,fg6kr30,t1_fg48ukz,1580570565.0,Thanks for looking that up! I only wonder if it would chill the espresso? I really like it super hot which already doesn’t last that long. I didn’t know if it was a bigger scoop or a tiny one. I’m very interested though and totally going to try it!
MadeMeSmile,fg6ki7i,t1_fg51rsz,1580570383.0,"‘84 baby here! And yea, my old photos aren’t very crisp or clear. It wasn’t until it gets into the 90s where they get clear. It’s almost like a slight blur"

FoodPorn,fg3q07t,t1_fg3paqh,1580487184.0,"Something magical happens with a super hot double espresso and then taking a bite (or lick, whatever you do) of a super cold heavy cream. After drinking enough espresso plain, you can really start to taste the flavor profiles. I love lattes and other creamy drinks too sometimes, but there’s something special about plain espresso. I think of it like whisky and scotch. The more you drink it straight, the more you’re able to enjoy the different flavors that each employs. I can’t do peaty though, I’m still not cool enough, lol.
Edit: more not mire"
wholesomememes,fg3p7f2,t1_fg2zv16,1580486688.0,"As a former smoker, once I read that baby birds get killed by the chemicals in the butts when parents use them to build nests, I always put them in a used can, cup or whatever with a small amount of liquid. I started as a young teen and honestly I flicked, it was a shitty thing to do. Once I started to be more considerate I’d even go pick my friends up and put them in my hoodie and then throw them away."
wholesomememes,fg3ot9n,t3_ewj7wj,1580486444.0,"I always thought it was interesting that you never see imported beer cans on the side of the road. It’s always Coors or Budweiser, I think that says more than I ever could."
toastme,fg3n1o0,t1_fg30sb9,1580485347.0,"I’m the same way, I still love the smell of people smoking and it makes me want a cigarette. Besides the fact that everything was paired well with cigarettes. Working? Cigarette. Stressed? Cigarette. Felling great? Cigarette. Driving anywhere? Cigarette. Just want to sit on the porch and relax with music? Cigarette. Anytime I work in the yard or driving anywhere I still want one and I quit 4 years ago. It’s like being a recovering smoker, it never goes away so you just have to suppress the urges no matter how much time goes by. I tried the whole vaping crap too and all it did was make me want a cigarette. There’s something so much more satisfying about a lit cigarette."

I just don’t understand. Especially how it was an attempt to showcase her to you, lol. Look, she can be blindfolded and tied up!"

raisedbynarcissists,ffikwcy,t1_ffgrcwq,1579976321.0,"This is actually reassuring to me. My mother tells me anytime I block her on my phone when she’s being abusive that one day she’s going to die and I’ll never be able to forgive myself for treating her like that. And just like my father, will start abusing drugs and live in guilt for the rest of my life. There’s a part of me that knows she’s full of shit, but another part that says she’s right, I’m a monster who will forever regret not giving her everything she wants. Sorry for the rant, it just means a lot to know that everyone here can back up with experience after an abusive parent has died that it’ll be ok."
raisedbynarcissists,ffiej52,t1_ffhtzce,1579971970.0,"Oh man, that social media bullshit. Where for their followers and “friends” they act like they care so much and are just the victims of circumstance and ungrateful children. After my brother committed suicide my mom literally said “I’m just a horrible mother who raised two messed up kids” and that was my cue to comfort her as one of those messed up kids"
raisedbynarcissists,ffid2db,t3_etafil,1579970985.0,"Honestly, thanks so much for posting! It’s really difficult when you hear “but they are family” “it’s your mom, she raised you”. It’s sad but also validating to hear others hear that nonsense when they have legitimate concerns about their parents. My therapist made a good point when I told her that I just wanted to be a good daughter. What does that exactly mean? Where does the line get drawn? Does that mean you have to be in a toxic and abusive relationship?"
raisedbynarcissists,ffickpl,t3_etpt72,1579970649.0,"When I was crying as a child about my father’s heavy drug use my mom angrily said “ oh boo-hoo my parents used to beat me with a belt”.  My therapist made a good point about parents who do this. Is there a pattern of them turning everything around so that it’s about them? Your  feelings are valid and I think they just don’t want to take responsibility. I’m wondering if she also conveniently forgets when she’s been outright abusive. Their brains are doing mental gymnastics so they can remain the victim. I’m so sorry to hear about your pain and I’d give you a hug if I could. You aren’t alone, and there are those of us out here who support you! Take care"
