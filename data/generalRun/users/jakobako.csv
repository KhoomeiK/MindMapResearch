Also, the Brexit voting demographics are the old, the poor, the uneducated. All three of them get ALL of their infomation from the same 6 red tops and faux-broadsheets. The British media decides elections in 2017 (or whatever it was) like it did in the 30s.

Cutting services and upping poverty actually creates more right wing voters beleive it or not, as they reach for the easiest scapegoat (as the papers prescribe to them). We don't have a credible opposition to this so for the next 8-12 years will be a complete renovation of our entire constitution from the top to bottom that ensures what is now the status quo persists. And it'll be subtle and death by a thousand cuts, all the way, and you won't even realise it's happening because it will happen slow and you're too busy reading headlines (you haven't read the article) like this.
