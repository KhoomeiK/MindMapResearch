I’ve learned this after years of therapy: It wasn’t your decision, you had no control, it’s not your fault, you can’t change it. 

You have three traumas to unpack here, your husband’s and friend’s betrayal and his death. It’s a lot and it’s ok to admit you’re in need of help. 

You’re going to want to make major life decisions. Don’t. Let the grief process happen. Find someone who can be an honest sounding board to run things past. Someone who’s not an enabler. 

It will hurt for what seems like forever, and then the pain will slowly fade with time. It’ll never completely go away, it’s now a part of who you are. You’ll become a stronger person from it.
