Seriously though, I also have a small social group outside of work, and even those who are somewhat interested in fitness think that I go overboard.  I am into distance running and strength training - those things take time, commitment, discipline.  A lot of people don't have those things and so there must be something wrong with those who do.  Really though, it takes guts to commit day in and day out, on shitty days where you would rather just stay in bed."
fatlogic,ffg94aw,t1_ffg774l,1579901123.0,"No, I think that is called 'healthy.' People don't like when people around them do things to better themselves. It makes them crazy."
fatlogic,ffg8v1a,t1_ffg8amy,1579900964.0,"I second this.  I tried some hardcore training at 1500-1600 calories, it was fucking awful.  I was exhausted and hungry constantly.  I slowly upped my calories and found that 1800-2000 keeps me from wanting to chew my own arm off.  I found that I still lost weight as long as I kept up with my workouts, and I had more energy for better quality workouts."

CICO,ffg011w,t3_etf53r,1579895522.0,"I was diagnosed with pcos, lost 109 lbs since May 2018.  The vast majority of that (80 lbs) was in under a year.

I didn't restrict any type of food, but I ate a lot of fruit and vegetables because you get more bang for your caloric buck.  Stuck in a 1200-1400 caloric range, walked for exercise.  Ate at the higher end of that range when I was more active, lower when less active.

Used MyFitnessPal for tracking.

Of my 109 lbs lost, those factors alone account for about 80 of those lbs.  I became more active around the 80 lb mark so I had to change how I ate, etc."

Vegetarianism,ffflmig,t3_etcon5,1579886619.0,"I started running, then doing distance running.

I read Scott Jurek's book ""Eat and Run"" and decided to give it a go.  I really fell in love with all of the new flavors and textures of a plant based diet.

That was last summer.  This month, I decided to try switching over to a vegan diet after watching The Game Changers."
