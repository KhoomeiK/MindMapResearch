depression,ffjcmbo,t1_ffjcewp,1579995468.0,I could try something like that thanks:)
depression,ffjao43,t1_ffj7cpc,1579994335.0,I could try that but can't right now at work because of a project going on.. don't think they will appreciate it
depression,ffjaksb,t1_ffj74av,1579994281.0,"I'm sorry to hear that, and yes I agree. I also find it difficult because at work and at school and with family I just have to pretend nothing is wrong with me. I can't say I'm depressed or whatever. Just have to hide and continue as if nothing is wrong"
depression,ffj6jqo,t1_ffj2936,1579991658.0,Also dutch! And I got my bachelors degree at the uni but work is also stressing me out. Right now at life I just need a break from everything so bad but that's not easy to just do.
depression,ffj6fb1,t1_ffiyz0u,1579991573.0,I just need a break..

depression,ffj6do6,t1_ffikduk,1579991541.0,"Just finished my 3 year bachelor and started in my first year master, only one more year left. And work is also really stressing me out right now. Would actually prefer not working and only studying but that would be such a waste of future posibilities"
AskReddit,ffhk8cm,t3_etkqrx,1579939093.0,Pause everything in the universe and first get myself a nice break i've been longing for so long
AskReddit,ff8eexv,t1_ff8eapu,1579674979.0,Glad I'm not the only one then haha
NoStupidQuestions,ff71mr4,t1_ff6yv0q,1579639332.0,Sorry thats a typo indeed I meant 5-6 hours per day. Other than that I know you're right. Will look into it and hopefully find a routine that suits me and is good. Will definitely try going for a walk tomorrow during work. Thanks
NoStupidQuestions,ff6wjik,t1_ff6dimy,1579636349.0,Want to avoid that tbh
NoStupidQuestions,ff6vseb,t1_ff69hgp,1579635899.0,"No worries I don't think you're an ass haha. I actually started eating balanced since a week now since I wanted to change my diet, which was indeed sugary and fatty. Now I eat the right amount of fruit and vegetables and carbs etc per day. I don't have much physical activity and I think sleep could also be an issue like you mentioned. I get roughly 5-6 hours a week. Work is mainly sitting so that indeed isn't a reason to be tired. Currently I work 20 hours a week and I'm doing a full time master at the uni. Maybe I could try getting better sleep and more physical activity but its difficult because of well the main issue which is what the original post was haha. Stupid cycle.. need to break it but too hard.."

NoStupidQuestions,ff5myvg,t1_ff5m75d,1579600989.0,I just looked up the audiobook and I'm gonna listen it right now while I'm at work. Thanks!
NoStupidQuestions,ff5mvlv,t1_ff5m19v,1579600849.0,I hate this. I don't want to spend my life working 40 hours a week and at the end of the day be too tired to do anything and prepare for the next working day.  It just makes me depressed.
NoStupidQuestions,ff5mtvm,t1_ff5l0co,1579600775.0,"I was thinking about writing down tasks on post-it notes and hang them on my wall so I can look at what is easy to do, try to do it and remove the post-it note."
