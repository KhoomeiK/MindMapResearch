bipolar,ffi0c0k,t3_etqcya,1579961165.0,"Side effects are also tied to blood level. Give it some time. Like other psych meds, the side effects are usually worst at the start and calm down over time.

Hydration works pretty much the same as for everyone: drink water when you're thirsty or when you notice that your urine is not clear or pale straw-colored. During highly dehydrating situations like long bouts of vomiting or diarrhea or high heat and heavy sweating, normal rehydration methods apply: diluted sports drink, water and a little salt, etc. 

For the most part, your body keeps everything in balance and send you cues about what you need, like thirst or salt cravings. The biggest risks come from not getting regular lithium level tests and ending up with too high a level or from sudden large water loss. I've been taking lithium for a very long time at a level on the very high side of the therapeutic range and the only time I ever experienced acute toxicity was during a long morning run in high heat and humidity. Now before I head into the heat I eat something or drink a sports drink and make sure I'm well hydrated. During, I pay attention to my thirst and drink diluted sports drinks if the sweating has been very heavy. For the most part, just eating food will restore lost electrolytes. 

Other than times I like this, I do nothing extraordinary: I drink water when I'm thirsty or when my urine looks too dark. That's it. 

In short, we on lithium worry about and approach the hydration the same as everyone does (or should), it's just the consequences are a bit different if we get really depleted."

bipolar,ffc2041,t3_estj67,1579789533.0,"I've always envied people that can just lie down and conk out at night. Also people that can nap, particularly those who can nap anywhere. I don't know what sleeping normally is exactly, but I don't think it's unusual for some people to need some wind-down time to settle their minds for sleep. My spouse does not have bipolar disorder and also listens to audiobooks and podcasts before falling asleep. Well or unwell, I have needed to read a book before falling asleep since I learned how to read, and I don't believe it's related to my diagnosis. 

Where the illness might come in is when sleep happens excessively or in amounts that are inadequate for health, especially in conjunction with other episode symptoms. At that point, it might be time to get with a doctor to figure out a strategy."

bipolar,fejy5ix,t1_fejmfam,1579188517.0,"I had a depression where the only thing that got me out of bed was my cat sitting on my chest and pawing my face. The only reason I left my apartment was to buy her food and litter. I would walk to a gas station convenience store in the middle of the night to reduce the number of people I would have to be around. As a side effect of being there, I would buy myself cans of tuna, vinegar, and Tabasco sauce. I largely couldn't taste food anymore, but if I doused the tuna in the vinegar and Tabasco, it tasted little enough like cardboard to force myself to swallow it. When my cat ate, I ate. When I filled her water bowl, I drank some water from the faucet.

After months like this, I was a skeleton, and eventually family showed up to take care of her and put me in a hospital. Without my cat, I think it's possible that I might have died of dehydration or starvation lying in bed. My survival was not enough motivation to move, but my obligation to care for her pulled on me. Of course I loved her, but in those depths I had no feelings aside from the pain. It was the contract I had made with her by adopting her that kept me at that minimal activity level; I couldn't neglect her the way I neglected myself because that was a violation of the contract. Keeping up my end of the bargain provided the momentum for me to act at least slightly to keep myself alive."
BipolarReddit,fegprm2,t1_feg52gb,1579099641.0,"I was given Ritalin and Prozac as a teenager, and the consequence of that was a diagnosis of schizophrenia. It was a while before the correct diagnosis of bipolar 1 was made. 

I agree with your belief that there is not a clear distinction. It seems like drugs can hasten or elicit episodes because the vulnerability is there. When it happens then, the primary factor in it happening must be the psychiatric illness because as far as I know this doesn't happen to people that don't have the illness. That makes them bipolar episodes in my opinion.

The other reason I would class an episode like this as a bipolar episode is that if it meets the diagnostic criteria, it doesn't matter what triggered it (except as a means of preventing future episodes). If I were to end up in a depression because of the death of a pet, the distinction between grief and depression might initially be unclear, but eventually the diagnostic picture would show a condition that requires medical treatment. Diagnostic criteria are to facilitate treatment, not help us with making sense of things by naming them. Making sense of the condition in the context of our lives is much harder."

bipolar2,fdqho3l,t1_fdq6yyt,1578666918.0,"I do. I think the time for retrospectives like that is when you're not in the middle of dealing with an episode. You might try saying something like, ""Can we postpone this discussion for when I'm more stable?"" 

Also, if you can get to seeing a psychiatrist instead of a nurse practitioner, that might speed up getting an accurate diagnosis and the right meds."

bipolar,fcxjdki,t3_ejdbip,1578064382.0,"I think the reason to treat the episodes that feel more minor is to arrest their momentum so that they don't become worse. Assuming what you've experienced was indeed true mania, if you address matters now, maybe you have a chance of never learning the hard way about how bad these episodes can get. If you peruse this sub more you'll see what mania can lead to: bankruptcy, job problems, broken relationships, jail, hospitals, etc.

My observation has been that it often takes something really bad for people to take their diagnosis seriously. For me, it took a lot, and I still have to keep relearning that lesson. If I could, I would tell an earlier incarnation of myself to get on lithium and stay on it, but I probably wouldn't listen."
