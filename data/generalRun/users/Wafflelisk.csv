A lot of CanCon might not be the best, but it still does it part to create a uniquely Canadian heritage. If we're going to have garbage pop we might as well get something out of it.  


  
Also, The Weeknd, BNL, The Hip, Our Lady Peace, Arkells, July Talk, Sam Roberts? Who hates these guys more than an equivalent American/British Band?

Right before the election - and shortly after it was revealed - he announced he was renouncing his dual citizenship.  Since he lost I haven't heard anything about it; maybe he's still going through with it. But it was clearly for show
