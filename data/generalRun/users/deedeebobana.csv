Stick around here.  Weight loss is calories in, calories out.  Every diet is based on this principle.

fatlogic,ff1vpdw,t1_ff0bq72,1579487239.0,Right...that is HR's job to ask as many questions as possible to confirm that the employer has a defensible position  in however the employer wants to proceed.   What you describe HR doing with the person that picked up and left in the middle of the shift was the right thing for HR to do in order to analyze the situation and determine the risk to the employer.

Maybe they are worried that the employee might have a case for accommodation but I would be asking for medical documentation if that were the case.   If you are the manager, start putting the pressure on her if she is being late all the time or not getting as much work as you expect her to get done.  Sometimes that pressure (performance management) makes an employee realize that maybe this job is not for her."

fatlogic,fep6aav,t1_feoulmt,1579313087.0,"But the way you have described it makes it seem like ""well, metabolisms slow down so just expect weight gain"".  That's fatlogic.  Any changes to metabolism (the rate at which the body burns energy) are minimal compared to changes in a person's habits.  As we age, we move less and probably eat more.  That's why most people gain weight as they get older.  Not their biological metabolisms."
fatlogic,feoqy5y,t1_feoo1on,1579304262.0,"That's not the metabolism slowing down.  Becoming less active means burning fewer calories (and usually eating stays the same or goes up) so weight increases.  And yes, there may be some muscle loss but the impact to metabolism is negligible.  

When people gain weight as they get older, it is because CICO.  They are either eating more OR moving less or some combination of the two."

fatlogic,feob1it,t1_fenjxje,1579297623.0,"So are you saying purposely avoiding food is ""anorexia-lite?"".

I purposely avoid food for a number of reasons:  some types of food anger my digestive system, other types don't satiate me and some types of food I just plane hate.  If I am ""avoiding food"" it is not automatically a negative thing - it is mostly as a way of making better choices and getting healthier and being responsible.  I am not a child - I don't always have to have what I want, when I want it and as much if it as I want.   And that's not ""anorexia-lite""."

Until you are squeezed beside someone taking too much space on a plane or on a bus.  Or your health premiums increase because of the strain obesity places on the health care industry.  Or you are left waiting on an ambulance when 8 paramedics are trying to help get a 400 pound immobile person out of their home.

When you want is probably less frequent too.  And what you think is a fairly regular sized meal is likely smaller than what a larger person eats as a small meal.

It still comes down to calories in/calories out.  If you are underweight then you are eating LESS than you burn on a regular basis."

Because metabolism has almost nothing to do with it.  Some people do not eat more and get away with it - those people are eating exactly the right amount to maintain their weight.  Other people eat too much."

EDIT:  Here's WHY I am trying to make this point.  I see too many people say ""well...I can't exercise so I guess I'll never lose weight so might as well give up.""  It is THOSE PEOPLE that I want to say you don't need to exercise...focus on diet."

fatlogic,fdngp7k,t1_fdn6erv,1578585429.0,"> I think it should be talked about more for people who want to lose weight. 

This is what I don't agree with.  A larger person that wants to lose weight needs to focus on diet, not exercise.  Exercise might actually be dangerous for someone at a very heavy weight.  

Incorporating exercise is a great habit to build.  But a heavier person that wants to lose weight needs to focus on making sustainable dietary changes first!"
fatlogic,fdn62fi,t1_fdn5bh2,1578578292.0,"I don't know why it is so hard to accept that CONSUMPTION is the key, deciding factor regarding weight.  You might be that special case that exercises heavily and doesnt have to worry about food.  My partner works a manual labour job, burning a good 4000 calories a day.  But on weeks that there is no work, the pounds will pack on if not being careful about consumption.

Calorie consumption is THE FACTOR for the average population.  When people come to accept that they have control in what they put in their mouth, that's when real change happens.

Exercise is great.  Metabolism is negligible.  Food/drink is what determines weight (for MOST average people)."
fatlogic,fdn5ntx,t1_fdmhrv1,1578577975.0,"Where do you get that 10,000 steps a day equates to an extra 500 calories burned?  On days I get 10,000 steps I have usually done an extra 20 minutes of running (or 40 minutes of walking).  That's barely 200 extra calories for the day.  It is misleading to think that the exercise you suggest will make a dent in maintaining or helping weightloss without a plan for maintaining dietary changes."

...ok but do you eat this much pasta every day?  Another response on this thread has talked about how we can't judge a person's intake based on what we see them eat for one meal!  Maybe you have an entire box of pasta because you didn't eat much the rest of the day!  Or that big salad is because your dinner will be small.

You are never hungry, so sure it's not that hard.  For you.

And yes, it is a simple concept regarding how to lose or maintain weight (CICO) but it is fricken HARD to do once you have already built habits that leave you with cravings and hunger. 

You are simply one of those types of people that have managed to consume exactly what your body needs.  No more, no less.  Most people have to work at that."

Good on you!!!  So many people feel like since the food is there, they have to eat it!  But if we don't need it, it belongs in the trash.  We should not treat our bodies like a trash can!  I threw out two boxes of chocolate today.  Because I'm done the chocolate eating until Easter!"

I actually have a funny dentist story about ""proof in the pudding"".   I have been trying to reverse a youth of teeth neglect (my parents never cared about dental hygiene) and am super diligent about flossing every day.  My last check up my hygenist complemented me on having almost zero plaque.  I told her about my flossing regime.  She said ""I have so many clients that floss every day and can't understand why they still have so much plaque!""  I said ""maybe they don't actually floss every day.  I mean the proof is in the pudding, right?""   She stopped.  Thought about it.  And said ""OMG I think you are right now that I think of it."""
