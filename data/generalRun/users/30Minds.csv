LosAngeles,ffx2rp0,t1_ffx26rp,1580316517.0,Yeah it's a program that was created to help mom and pop landlords to retire from the rental market business but instead has been exploited by developers who buy a rent controlled building and then immediately file an Ellis Act to destroy it and put up something more lucrative. It's responsible for about 26k rent controlled units being removed from the LA housing market since 2001.  The LA Tenants Union campaigns against this act and it probably will be reversed but not for a few years minimum unfortunately. https://knock-la.com/la-tenants-union-calls-out-housing-department-for-allowing-illegal-ellis-act-evictions-569120cdc3dd
