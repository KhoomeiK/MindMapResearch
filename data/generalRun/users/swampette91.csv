vanderpumprules,ff1sp7j,t3_epatm8,1579485321.0,"Same! I was always into the show and would watch new seasons but I haven’t even cared at all to tune into this one. I might try when there’s when there’s nothing on but I do not care. And yes, I have been in this sub and noticed nothing seems interesting this season."

vegan,fc5zpxo,t3_eg8171,1577469157.0,"This is so damn cute! How can people torture and eat these friendly, curious and awesome animals!"
vegan,fc5yxw3,t3_eg53mp,1577468736.0,Vegan ricotta is SO good too.
vegan,fc5y3tb,t3_egbek0,1577468294.0,"I have experienced this and last night chose to ignore my aunt talking crap for 20 mins straight right next to me after trying some of my vegan food. I was on the fence, I could have either went off and said some things back to her or try to inform her on some shocking and grotesque facts about meat or ignore her completely. I ignored her and avoided getting upset and aggressive. It does nothing and will never end in someone becoming vegan."
vegan,fbfnyf4,t3_ectpz6,1576815492.0,I have so many friends like this. They just love dogs and will do anything for any dog ever and hate people that treat their dogs poorly. Even share videos and pics of cute farm animals but then talk about loving bacon and burgers and chicken wings. Pisses me off SO much.
