AskReddit,ffjoits,t1_ffjl04w,1580003031.0,Ryan Eggold (lead in New Amsterdam) is a fucking master at realistic vocal pause. The reason it looks fake on many actors is because the facial and body micro expression has to match and reflect what caused the vocal pause. The expression you make when you suddenly realize that your mouth is getting you in trouble is different than the expression you make when you suddenly get a new idea and go off on a tangent. An actor using the wrong expression is going to come off completely out of context.

While I very much and very deeply continued to love my living children, a large part of me was absolutely convinced that losing one meant I was unable to keep my other children safe, that I was bad luck, and that it was just a matter of time before I lost them too. I ended up going the opposite way as your mom and never wanted them out of my sight and seriously overprotective them, but I could just have easily fallen into the trap of thinking I needed to stay away from them so they could be safe.

The thing that help me the most was my kids kept telling me that they loved me even when I was acting crazy, that it was ok that I was broken and they didn't want a better mom (in those exact words). These words from them eventually gave me the courage to seek out medical help and dig myself out of the depression. I was on medication up until about a year ago, and still go to therapy. I still have the occasional bad days, but I work really hard to make sure they don't bleed over to the kids like they did at first.

I know you are young, and that none of this is fair, but I promise you that it is ok for you to fight to get your mom back, that she does love you, and that you have the right to tell her how you feel.

AskWomen,fcr5efj,t1_fcqoyo2,1577897029.0,"One way is to make it a policy to look things up before asking for help. Example, if your car is making a weird sound, don't just head off to the mechanic. Figure out where the sound is coming from and look up what the part of the car is and what it does. Find out what the parts should cost and how long the repair should take. Then when you do take it to a mechanic, you won't get ripped off. Or maybe even  fix it yourself, save a ton of money, and build up you confidence in yourself."

JustNoTruth,fcjjpig,t1_fcj43oe,1577690308.0,"Re: 9 month old dog not being a puppy...

I'm going with no on the technicality here since dog maturity is heavily dependent on breed. I have Anatolian Shepherds and they, like many large working breeds, are neither physically nor mentally mature until 3-4 years.

That being said, the dog in question is a Pug. It's highly unusual for a pug to be that aggressive and there is either some seriously bad breeding or bad rearing going on here."

IsItBullshit,fcirr2n,t3_eg9ne8,1577668265.0,"Spacing out vaccines can be helpful in rare, specific cases. 2 examples:

People with autoimmune urticaria with facial swelling have a greater chance of having a significant flare involving breathing problems with multiple vax than a single vax.

People who have a history of anaphylaxis to vaccines should not get multiple vax at once for the simple reason of knowing which vax caused the reaction. Spacing out vax in this case prevents unnecessary avoidance of the vaccines that were not responsible. Family history of multiple allergies may warrant such precautions as well."
