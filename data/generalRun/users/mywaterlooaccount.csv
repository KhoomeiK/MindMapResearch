You were warned _specifically_ not to do ECE with the intent of transferring, and look at you here.

To answer your question, yes, they can and almost certainly will consider failed term marks. Otherwise it'd provide an incentive to poorly performing students to sandbag (it should not be advantageous to intentionally do worse). More generally, students who transfer are not the poorly performing ones.

But enough about admissions, let's talk about you. This term you either didn't really try (as I suggested), or even worse, you did. If knowing your transfer chances basically get demolished when you have below an 80 average (and realistically a 90 average) wasn't enough to motivate you to even pass the term, it isn't going to get better on a repeat. 

If you really did try your hardest, poured your heart out into the term, and gave it your all, and you still couldn't pass 1A, that's not good news. The hardest terms of ECE are 1B and 2A. If by some stroke of luck you pass 1A, you're going to basically faceplant into even harder terms.
