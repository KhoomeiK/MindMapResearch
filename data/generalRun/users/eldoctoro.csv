Kidding. Thank you. My laundry thanks you."
ADHD,ffney8w,t1_ffmg0m8,1580065097.0,"I use this watch feature multiple times a day, every day. I wish I could ping my keys and my wallet and my motivation and my tv remote and my other boot too."
ADHD,ffnecrf,t3_eu3koq,1580064846.0,"It’s the best! I’ll read all the questions and circle the ones I’m unsure about. Then I’ll answer the questions backwards and 7 times out of 10, I’ll have found the context needed to confidently answer the questions I was iffy about at first.

The only problem is that I’ll sometimes get through the exam too quickly with this method and then start second guessing myself. “They gave me 90 minutes but it’s only been 25... this can’t be right...”

So then I take the time left and count all the questions I’m sure are correct and calculate my lowest possible grade and on a separate piece of paper (or just on the back if it’s not going through a scantron) I’ll write out any questions that I had while writing so that I can go over them with my teacher later. I think of it like insurance in case I get tripped up by a trick question, so my mentor doesn’t think I’m an idiot."
AskReddit,ffn4bd4,t1_ffmfhdb,1580061933.0,"When I was little I loved Barbie.com. I thought it was so cool that I found all these games and Barbie related content. Barbie.com is a pretty on-the-nose name for a website, so that’s probably how all websites work, right? I was a little girl, I would definitely find a bunch of content meant for little girls at Girls.com, right?? Wrong. I was wrong."
AskReddit,ffd7tbb,t3_esype6,1579815095.0,"Checking and replying to emails in a timely fashion, especially if I’m at home. It gives me so much anxiety and I hate myself because of it."
woahdude,ff7v1s1,t1_ff5t892,1579659035.0,"This made me think of the people on crowded sidewalks who use big umbrellas when it snows.  That umbrella is not helping any more than a good hood would, and it’s poking everyone within reach."
woahdude,ff7us8x,t1_ff7pnr9,1579658860.0,"Mmmmmm don’t forget about the nosebleeds and the seasonal depression.  If you do most of your crying in the shower, the moisture in the air kind of makes you forget just how dry it actually is."
femalefashionadvice,ff024q1,t1_fezzztt,1579464418.0,"I think a lot of big stores kind of copy that style! I’ve seen it at H&M and at most shoe stores, but I’m in Canada and they’re very in style in the area where I work right now. But maybe now that you have it in your mind you might start seeing this style around in shops near you. Maybe!"
femalefashionadvice,ff01r7x,t3_eqwnh4,1579464272.0,"I work in fitness and have to wear all black while I’m working, and my clothes have to pass as athletic attire. Is there a way to elevate my style so that I can look and feel put together while still meeting my uniform requirements?

Edit: I should add that I have a uniform top which is a ribbed black tank top with fairly thick straps. It’s flattering enough. I’m mostly wondering about what kind of sweaters/jackets/silhouettes or textures to wear as a layer over top. When I don’t need the uniform I play with patterns and colours and textures. My usual silhouette that works for my body is high waisted leggings and a fitted sleeveless crop top, usually with a higher neckline because I like the coverage when teaching and demonstrating. The uniform tank top is full length and has more of a scoop neckline."
femalefashionadvice,ff019tc,t1_fez19do,1579464055.0,"[Lulu’s](https://www.lulus.com/categories/13_3492/wrap-dresses.html)  has a pretty big selection of wrap dresses. They’re not the highest quality but they’re definitely better than I had expected at the price point. Sometimes they run a little long, though I’ve never ordered a mini dress, only full length and midi. The full length had to be hemmed but the midi dress did not."
femalefashionadvice,fezzhrw,t1_fezwpgl,1579463553.0,"If chunky trainers are your go-to, have you considered [J-Slides](https://jslidesfootwear.com/sneakers/) or something similar? They’re kind of sporty but a bit more elevated and you can go with trusty black/neutrals or if you’re more into colours they seem to have a lot of different colours and patterns."
gifs,feulfew,t1_fesuucm,1579387652.0,I rock a Canadian tuxedo sometimes. It’s not so bad.
bulletjournal,fehlt0u,t1_fehfima,1579119148.0,Oh okay then they are even more similar than they appear! He seems very sweet. :)
bulletjournal,fegryh3,t1_fcxfpnw,1579101145.0,Oh he’s so beautiful! I also have a spaniel and they look like they could be twins! But Hugo seems a lot more chill. Thanks for sharing!

AskReddit,fdlpj9n,t1_fdifmby,1578529423.0,My ex’s aunt was named Baby. When they moved to North America they got to pick their own English names and she thought it was a popular name for beautiful women because it was in so many songs. She was a sweet lady.
AskReddit,fdlpb2c,t1_fdiks60,1578529269.0,"My dad used to call me Cash as a nickname! I think it’s because he really loved Johnny Cash and my name starts with C. My older brother’s name is Travis and I remember teasing him that if dad ever gave him a nickname it would be Trash.

I haven’t thought about that in years. Thanks for the memory jog!"
bulletjournal,fdkj9rr,t1_fdkhc0r,1578504886.0,"On the next page I have a much less pretty Celtic Cross guide, a little note of things/patterns to look for, and prompts for asking effective questions. That page is just writing though. I’m not sure how else to make it visually appealing but I’m really glad I did this page!"
bulletjournal,fdjzhmq,t1_fdirrvc,1578492210.0,Thank you for the heads up!! I noticed a bit but assumed it was because I didn’t wait long enough for it to dry. Good to know!
bulletjournal,fdipstx,t1_fdiplnl,1578448318.0,I definitely had to sacrifice space for aesthetics but I think it’s just enough information to do the trick!! :) for reference I believe the circles are 1.5 and 2 cm in diameter.
bulletjournal,fdikjpk,t1_fdik7n7,1578444961.0,Thank you! I saw a post on this very subreddit like four days ago that made me realize I needed a black bullet journal too.
bulletjournal,fdikgoz,t1_fdi8ga3,1578444907.0,"Ha! I’ve done that so many times with various stencils. This one is part of the ruler which I’m pretty good about keeping and using, so I’m hoping to trick myself into using the stencil more."
bulletjournal,fdik8ah,t1_fdicgy1,1578444763.0,"Thank you! The journal is by Quo Vadis and the cover says

LIFE JOURNAL

DOTS

BLACK EDITION

The white pen is a uniball signo broad white pigment ink, the gold and green are Sakura Gelly Rolls (gold is metallic, green is not), and the silver is a Pentel Slicci 0.8mm ball. 

They’re all very new to me, I’m still playing with them and figuring out what works but so far I am enjoying working with them! :)

Edit: autocorrect doesn’t share the same affinity for specific pens and their brands as we do.

Edit 2: the silver pen is what’s in the chart on the minor arcana page, major arcana is white ink wherever it looks like white ink, in case anyone was wondering."
bulletjournal,fdi6zpg,t1_fdi3twf,1578436851.0,"A lot of it is from Biddy Tarot’s cheat sheets, but some of it is from my own experience and from a friend who is an *amazing* reader. She has a fun style/way of connecting everything. I think my favourite tarot thing I’ve learned from her was about the ten of swords. Her elevator pitch description of that card is “okay but why did it have to be TEN?!” 

(I know no one asked for that anecdote but I figured I may as well share while I have a somewhat captive audience!)"
bulletjournal,fdi6feu,t1_fdi61td,1578436559.0,"The first time I wrote this out, my reading improved exponentially. Quite literally the evening after I wrote it all out I did three or four readings and they were all really good, like I had hit a flow state! Probably because it’s enough information to string together a narrative but not so much that you’re constantly reading someone else’s long winded interpretation. Good luck on your journey :)"
bulletjournal,fdi67xf,t1_fdi18ll,1578436449.0,Thanks!! I got a ruler that has a few little stencils in it and it’s giving me (and this spread) life.
bulletjournal,fdi63jg,t1_fdhzkd2,1578436386.0,Thank you!! I spent waaaay too long with my bullet journal today (and not nearly enough time drinking water or being a functional member of society) but these two pages feel really special so I have no regrets!
bulletjournal,fdi5w4m,t1_fdi16vt,1578436284.0,"Yes please feel free to get inspired (or steal it, I don’t think I invented anything here either! Ha.)

A lot of it is from Biddy Tarot, some of it is from conversations with friends, and a small bit of it is from my own experience. I copied a page that I had written out in a random notebook back in... September? So there might be some broken telephone in the interpretations!"
bulletjournal,fdhx70d,t3_elfp36,1578431783.0,I like the Sakura Metallic Gelly Rolls. I used to use them a lot in university for side notes and headers and now I have a black bullet journal and they’ve been great so far. The line is pretty thick though (seems at least as thick as but probably thicker than 0.7).
bulletjournal,fdhwukf,t3_elhn01,1578431599.0,That is so sweet!! Beautiful poem and beautiful artwork. I love the colours. Thanks for sharing!
BALLET,fcuhx3e,t1_fcpgejg,1577981365.0,Baby powder also helps to prolong the life of bands and prevents breaks and tears!
movies,fcohxkf,t1_fca0kbp,1577832647.0,"I also found Jennifer Hudson disappointing! Obviously her voice is beautiful but I just didn’t really care about her as Grizabella. The fact that Jennifer Hudson seemed like a fairly young cat was also kind of off putting. It made it seem extra tragic that Gus the Theatre Cat didn’t get chosen.

Edit: for anyone wondering, I like, reeeeally love this musical, even though I know it’s terrible. I didn’t love the movie like I love the stage show, but I liked it for how bad it was."
movies,fcoha40,t1_fc2u6a9,1577832198.0,"It’s like she was too good to be in Cats 2019 but was still in Cats 2019. She was also probably the worst, or at least tied for the worst with James Cordon."
movies,fcogo4g,t1_fc4nu82,1577831782.0,I’m pretty sure it’s for kids and theatre kids and stoners. Based on the movies included in the previews.
movies,fcogi5i,t1_fcegl4s,1577831667.0,"I went to see this by myself on a Sunday night and the theatre was PACKED with people who were clearly there to laugh at (and occasionally with, but mostly at) it. It was so fun. It was obviously a terrible movie but being in a theatre full of roaring laughter was a real treat. I don’t know why people are expecting it to be good. It’s campy and it’s bad and it’s wonderful, as is the play. I agree with some of the reviews that said it was missing the “magic” of the stage production though. The movie took itself too seriously is all."
movies,fcoftmb,t1_fcm7nqc,1577831204.0,No and it’s a tragedy.
asmr,fcktejo,t1_fcjou9u,1577732788.0,"ASMR Alyssaa and Karuna Satori both do a lot of “broken record” videos! Tingles with Flyby has some slothy type videos, but not all of her videos are quite that slow."
