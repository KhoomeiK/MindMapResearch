AnimalCrossing,ffid70r,t3_etrj5f,1579971072.0,So cuteee!
ac_newhorizons,ffid3o0,t3_etqscv,1579971009.0,"Omg the details are amazing right? It’s just sad that we have to find out things ourselves, (also a good thing of course while we’re waiting for the release) but it feels like Isabelle isn’t even running the twitter account anymore .. the last post was on 2 January? It feels like ages ago that we got some new content. I really do hope they have a good reason for this lol. I don’t know if it’s only me but I’m sometimes concerned if the game really would be that good and has a lot to offer since. (ok, besides the new crafting system) We haven’t seen new footages in a while, it’s all so ‘mysterious’ ..but hey fingers crossed!"
