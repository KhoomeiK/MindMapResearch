Your parents are demanding, just make sure you enjoy your life in high school and don’t let your parents ruin the beautiful person you are."

lifehacks,ffdgpjo,t3_esvnrx,1579820497.0,"NOT FAIR. Yes it gets rid of social media, AND TEXTING. Old phones cannot handle the modern group chat messages of smart phones. And nobody is going to actually CALL their Friend to make plans. Get rid of Instagram sure, but unless you are trying to entirely cripple your child’s social life (which is a bad thing to do) you should not do this to your kid. It is as if they do not have a phone at that point."
AskReddit,ffd9qr0,t3_esr647,1579816205.0,"Making others think everything is fine with me. I am always relatively cheerful at school, and so when I feel like throwing a brick through a car window, usually when I’m at home, I have nobody to talk to."

ApplyingToCollege,ff7wrt4,t1_ff7t3bw,1579660202.0,"Well, don’t get me wrong, I’m probably still only gonna be able to pay 40k a year and that will include loans. But a lot of people get caught up in the idea of the name and reputations of colleges. The name on a degree may make a difference later on in some cases. Plus, there definitely are some educational reasons for the price differences, they will get a better education. But going to a cheaper school and saving the money is almost never a bad option."
ApplyingToCollege,ff7s35o,t1_ff6otgn,1579656997.0,"As much as I hate to say it, I’m pretty sure I have some old money waiting for me from my grandparents, they helped with my older brothers, and I’m also applying for a ton of scholarships. I’m only really saying this cuz I know at some point I have to receive my share of hate for this fact. Trust me, I’m not taking college for granted."

Your crush still cared about her bf when she had that fight (probably), and celebrating at the heartache of others is selfish and obsessive.
