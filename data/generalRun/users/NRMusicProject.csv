If you're afraid of a small, drunk man doing much damage while you have two friends with you, you probably shouldn't be a police officer."

She used to say climate change is obviously a thing, but there isn't proof it was humans.  She did say that being said, it doesn't mean we shouldn't be exploring greener options for the planet, because it could still be human related.

I had a girlfriend with severe anorexia break up with me after the counselor told her I was a very supportive and helpful boyfriend, when she was trying to get the counselor to blindside me and tell me that any help I was trying to do (read books on the subject, suggest simple meals, drive her to the counselor) were only making it worse.

That was over ten years ago, and she still tells people how horrible I was.
