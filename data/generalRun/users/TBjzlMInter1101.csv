We are cyber bullying kids now it seems."

Do you actually think they make their own thumbnails? And Vikk gets ignored tbh because he simply is not a natural comedian. He is not spontaneous. He can be quite funny, like “Dr, Pepper, you can’t be drinking that,” moment from sidemen reacting to draw their life, but his usual style of humour is different. 

You also forget that he’s not too good at physical sports like football or VGs FIFA — it’s what is common in every single other sidemen. It’s why there seems to be a rift between them."

wholesomememes,ffhtbkv,t1_ffhrfkq,1579952840.0,"Pls don’t suggest that going to church will fix your mental illnesses. 

Just like breaking your knee, they affect your brain physically, and none of those can be fixed by priests. 

Also yes, I’ve seen where depressed people can be coerced to church to “fix” them...but try a bipolar person on a severe manic spree, or a person suffering with schizophrenia, and you’ll realise how quickly you need a doctor."
Sidemen,ffhsylu,t1_ffhswbx,1579952305.0,"Yeah definitely lol, he’s got that Karen energy going on. But I’ve seen a lot of his videos, he does have a lot of empathy/feels bad for people."
Sidemen,ffhstv1,t1_ffhsrxj,1579952111.0,"Tbh that’s just how it is. He acts the same with JJ. I don’t think he’s bad by heart, any OG viewer will know."
