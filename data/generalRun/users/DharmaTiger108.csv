Looks like white supremacy/racism on the part of Women’s March. 

That’s not ok. Unfortunately, many white feminists have not learned from their (our— I’m white) past."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,few5pb7,t1_fevyagz,1579405769.0,"Oh, no! I had no idea. I’m not in LA and I didn’t hear that. That’s terrible. If I had known I would not have attended. That’s not ok at all."
pics,fevkizd,t1_fevdwy8,1579398477.0,"Well, the article didn’t give any concrete data on people with degrees (and honestly, they said “university” which usually implies a BA which is significantly easier to obtain than advanced degrees) and their comparative levels of intelligence, because the premise is that there is no one way of defining intelligence, which, as someone with experience in conducting IQ tests, I agree with in essence. 

Gifted people, ie, people with a high degree of intelligence, like my friend, are known to have greater empathy and concern for social justice issues and global concerns. I’ll send you links if you want, but I doubt you do. There’s also a correlation between capacity for empathy and progressive views, but that’s a conversation for another day. 

It is possible for people who are less intelligent to complete AAs and BAs, but it generally requires a psychological assessment for supportive accommodations. Despite their being a variety of ways of measuring intelligence, I do think it’s fair to deduce that people with (multiple) advanced degrees and a passion for social justice, and have taught and written doctoral level textbooks are intelligent."
funny,feve0am,t3_eqp0r7,1579396341.0,That would be hysterical. I would totally watch.
pics,fev8xsu,t1_fev6tws,1579394517.0,"People who practice those traditions, particularly paganism, sometimes refer to themselves as witches. They are both earth-based traditions, often indigenous, and have quite a bit in common, if you cared to compare them, which is beyond the scope of this post. 

Witches were women who were healers and were targeted for practicing midwifery or knowing about healing herbs, etc. She’s indicating solidarity amongst the ages between women confronting the patriarchy and standing up for themselves. “We are pissed” because not only does patriarchy continue, but it has been quite seriously exacerbated recently. Edit- another was y of saying this could be, “you didn’t get us all, we are still here, you still ha e to contend with us and our anger at how you have treated us for millennia.” But that’s just not quite as catchy, is it?"
pics,fev45qw,t1_fev27tx,1579392940.0,"The fact that you are calling her a “dumb bitch” indicates that you feel threatened by her and it’s clear that you don’t comprehend the underlying cultural relevance of her sign. She is not “advocating for witches,” and even if she was, do you even know the first thing about paganism or shamanism (other than the uninformed, fear based distorted views of right wing Bible thumpers)?"
pics,fev0wdz,t1_feuy3ln,1579391871.0,"Your article actually doesn’t conclude that having advanced degrees is not an indicator of intelligence, but that it’s what you do with the education that counts. My friend is a psychologist and a Director of Behavioral Health at a medical clinic. She works to make people’s lives better and understands how the intersectionality of social justice issues and poverty impact people’s me tal health. In her spare time, she advocates for policies that will have a positive effect on her patients and all oppressed people. I would argue that based on the article you provided, my friend has used her education very well, and it has “gone through her” and not just she gone through it, to paraphrase one of the quotes. Based on the article you provided, we can conclude that my friend is very smart."

Chelsea Handler has a documentary on Netflix about racism. She shares a story where she was with her black boyfriend and they had pot on them and the police pulled them over whole driving.  Her boyfriend was arrested, but she was told to leave the neighborhood and didn’t get any kind of punishment whereas he went to jail. Yes, that’s an anecdote, but it is anecdotes like that that build up the statistics. 

I encourage you to watch her documentary called, “Hello, Privilege, It’s me, Chelsea.” It’s a decent primer in what these terms mean and how they affect people’s lives. 

Here’s more data including stats and footnotes to the sources.  https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2018/02/21/447051/systematic-inequality/

But, based on your comment, I can see this isn’t a serious conversation and no matter what evidence I provide, it doesn’t fit with your worldview so you won’t accept it."
