Could you get it reversed through your bank? If you have proof of the recipient and venmo saying the recipient needs to reverse it and the recipients email requesting the reverse I would like to think that legally you are covered?

todayilearned,ff94eoc,t1_ff938ml,1579704578.0,Under a white flag would be totally disgraceful. However I could see where if two nations were at war and ships were fighting today the orders would be to totally destroy the ship. With the amount of communication tech we have today if after a fight a ship ran into a storm and needed help it could call for it. Or just use technology to avoid the storm as much as possible.

Plus the fact that he might not be able to father children later in life.. Way more than just a testicle being worth 26k on the surface.
