fatlogic,ffdj6az,t1_ffccxgy,1579821990.0,Yeah it just makes me feel vulnerable!
fatlogic,ffdho02,t3_esqqw3,1579821076.0,"I did hate when people complimented me on my recent weight loss,  

“how did you do it?” 
What I said:  “smaller portions” 
What I meant: “my brother died and I can’t eat and only feel in control of my life when I try to manipulate my body” 

I think it’s a fair and solid general rule to not compliment someone’s weight loss unless they’ve explicitly told you their trying to lose weight. “I’ve been on this diet” “I can tell; you look amazing!” Is a very different discourse"
drivinganxiety,ff7tsfd,t3_es3wz8,1579658182.0,Have you had a more experienced driver try to drive your car and maybe give you some tips on how to compensate for its engine issue when driving? Might be nice to let a pro take a wack at it
