SuicideWatch,fclluvh,t1_fclj7pb,1577750823.0,"I understand.  For me It’s the pain. It’s overwhelming. It takes everything you have to get through every moment. Yet you still continue. Each step seemingly more painful than the last. Suicide is never about other people, or the future, or anything like that. It’s about the insane amount of pain that existence can be. If you want to talk let me know. I’ve been there. I tried to go through with it and this story is my perspective of that act 5 years later."

After My Death

I killed myself five years ago. Five years ago I was writing a note to my parents telling them it’s not their fault, that I just wasn’t good enough for this world. I told them how alone I felt. How I had nobody that wanted to listen. How I didn’t have a purpose in this life. 

My mom found my body. She walked to the door of the bedroom and glanced in. She thought I was asleep at first. “Jake, wake up! We’re home, can you help unload the car” she said. I didn’t move. “Jake!” She said again with a tone of frustration. She walked into the bedroom now. A trickle of gunpowder stung her nose mixed with the copper of blood. “Jake?” She asked with the questioning horror of a mother who is realizing that she just lost her child. The unintelligible shriek she made as the realization hit will forever ring in the halls of my home. When my mom realized I was dead she collapsed to the floor, her back braced by the frame of the door. She couldn’t move. She couldn’t think. There was only pain and grief.

  My dad found the note and his gun laying on the floor. He had to enter the room to see the mask of death on my face, the extra hole over my ear, the bloodstained sheets. He felt the clammy, lukewarm skin of my arm, and then my face as he reached out one final time to embrace his son. His hands stained with my crimson blood, still warm. He will never wash his hands of that blood in his minds eye. When he looks down all he sees is the stain of the last of my life etched in the grooves of his fingertips. This is our final moment together. 

My brother got the call on his way back from work. He had to pull over to keep from crashing. The song that was playing in the radio, one of his favorites, is never listened to again. He won’t stop wondering if he was responsible in some way. How could he not know his own brother was in pain? That the pain became overbearing? That life seemed to hurt too much to continue? That the promise of it maybe getting better was not enough to overcome the pain in the now? He’s still in therapy to this day. 

My friends were coming home from practice when they heard. None of them could believe it. I seemed happy. None of them will ever forget it. One still sits up at nights holding his head in his hands wondering if he could have stopped it. If he had just said one phrase or another to let me know he loved me like a brother. Another doesn’t get too close to anyone anymore. He doesn’t want the pain of the loss he felt, so he gives up the emotions of companionship. One turned to alcohol and drugs. At first it was a coping mechanism, but it become his everything. A couple years later he followed my footsteps. 

That night was clear and beautiful. A full moon illuminated the mountains. Endless  stars carpeted the indigo sky. There was no one to appreciate it on that night. For most, the world kept spinning. For everyone that mattered it came to screeching halt, never to be the same again."
