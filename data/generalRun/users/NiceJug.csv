trees,fehywt5,t3_ep8cd5,1579126672.0,It’s like a glass tube with a metal coil. You fill it with weed most hold up to 1.5g and then twist the coil thing down to compress the weed and disperse it through the twisty thing. Light the open end like a blunt and draw through the mouthpiece. It stays cherried so you can just keep drawing until you’re done and then stub out like a blunt when done and put the rubber cap on for later. Then relight when want it again. Clean with alcohol - honestly a game changer. You can pick them up for about £12 on Amazon and stuff!
