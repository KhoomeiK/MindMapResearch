aww,ff4on7d,t1_ff49mt4,1579568716.0,"I guess the internet has a big part in this. Millenials see other Millenials complaining about their dads, realizing what their own dad is doing is NOT the way to go, and go on to be more involved and a dad that's more fun? I have no kids so I'm just pulling this out of my ass."
LiverpoolFC,ff22vro,t1_ff1yw6t,1579492319.0,"As much as I hate Man United, I'd say James and Fred were the only ones who put their heart and soul into this game. The rest were there but... kinda absent at the same time. Kudos to them. But James is still too immature in his play style and unfortunately couldn't make too much of an impact."
LiverpoolFC,ff22nad,t1_fezpsrm,1579492138.0,"That slide felt like one of those  slide jumps that we do to speed up our runs in FPS games. 

Yet another piece of evidence that this man is literally not from this world."

LiverpoolFC,fezk5tl,t3_eqygjm,1579458201.0,Alisson ran faster to celebrate with Salah than Martial did throughout the whole game.
LiverpoolFC,fez4x3l,t3_eqygjm,1579453897.0,This is dangerous. Not saying Man united is actually threatening us because they're so shite that even if we give them an open goal they'd still miss. It's just that we're giving away balls too easily and it won't fare well for us.
LiverpoolFC,fez1s9v,t1_fez1gct,1579453100.0,"Yeah no way it wasn't a foul. 

Regardless, Firmino's finish was neat."
LiverpoolFC,feq8c58,t1_feq1wcs,1579338791.0,"Yeah I know. But I guess it doesn't make sense for him to sprint like a sprinter because he has to brace himself for sudden turns and stops, which an Olympic sprinter never does."
LiverpoolFC,fepsdyx,t1_fepdswf,1579329653.0,"I find it funny how he runs. 

Like everything I was taught when I was a sprinter goes against the way he was running. But he's so damn fast."

Like no matter how hard I use real life objects and himself to demonstrate the relationship between things, he just can't understand which part is front which part is back.

In my years as a tutor this is the only thing that truly drove me crazy."
gaming,fejr2h3,t1_fejb78h,1579183716.0,"I don't think anyone would even recognize the voice. Like unless you're a voice actor or something, or Sean Connery, most actors have pretty generic voices. And over a non professional mic I'd think it'll be even harder to recognize it."
movies,fejqsoh,t1_fejo0z1,1579183515.0,"Might get crucified for this but I just think we're going overboard with this woman rights thingy. Like... You never see us changing genders for iconic female characters. We don't need a male snow white or male Lara croft. They're women as they are, why change the gender? Why are we trying our very best to make everything politically correct? Honestly, why is this even considered PC? 

Bond is Bond. If he's a guy he's a guy. There's no point turning him into a woman. You can create another character for a woman who's similar to Bond but he'll always be a man."

I know she's probably just being cordial or trying to kill the awkward silence, but it's really the first time a stranger's complimented me so it feels great. I mean, hell, not even my girlfriend likes my lifting body."
LiverpoolFC,fdss07c,t1_fdrxql8,1578707186.0,"Still kinda depressing though. I mean, he sure knows he's got skills but to be played as a sub and be injury ridden is obviously not something footballers enjoy, regardless of the team they are playing in."

CCP: we got laws and regulations alright. But no one follows them and we honestly don't give a flying fuck as long as we can make money. 

China has a shit ton of laws on pretty much everything, but the enforcement of them is so fickle that they might as well not be there."

Granted it's how the PL plays but some of those were obviously targeted just at Minamino."

There's just no point fighting literal thugs with guns because you can't win. Yes you can seriously injure a couple cops if you actually start fighting but with tear gas and guns they can easily kill a few dozens, if not more.
