I wish you a wonderful journey! :)"

bipolar,ff737ql,t3_es0snh,1579640220.0,"I think you answered yourself in that text :) If people feel the need to blame you for the choices you take, even when it means not caring about what others think- so that you can have a decent life. They are definatly the walnuts that you dont want in your life. Keep doing you, and eventually maybe they will learn a thing or two from you!"
mildlyinteresting,fez0ahs,t3_eqyjzx,1579452676.0,I like the fact that you have drum sticks on you kitchen counter. Playing on the pans when cooking? :D

bipolar,feyyb86,t3_eqam9p,1579451960.0,"Sounds like a manic episode. But! The topic you were giving yourself into about spiritualism is not that bad. Ofcourse to the point you did was not healthy, but the alternative religion is a lot about not feeling bad or blaming yourself for decisions you made in the past. You are a human, you fucked up, you ended up hurting yourself and now you are richer from that experience. This does not in any way mean that you have lost your chance of love and happiness, even though you are dissapointed of how you treated your ex. Sharing you thoughts and remorse to him, making it clear that you dont expect anything in return is a good way to start in the right direction.

I can’t tell anyone wich religion to follow, but seeking answers in christ after a breaktrough (as I see it) experience like this, is a recipe to crush yourself to pieces. It will make you full of regret and low self esteem, without giving you the freedom to be happy without «paying for your sins». And that is neither good or healthy.

Take your time to figure this out, without focusing in any type of religion or diagnose. If that is too hard and you still feel stuck I would as others here recomend reaching out to a therapist. Good luck! You got this ;)"
DMT,fevhf5r,t1_fev9w0q,1579397484.0,"Then maybe you should have a chat with someone you know, if they have done it about your toughts of trying it out. I am still waiting for the right time in my life, as I currently react quite bad pyshically and mentally on lsd, mushrooms and weed. I thing when you go into your trip with toughts and intentions to better yourself, that is exactly what the trip will show you. So if this is things you are thinking of, maybe this is indeed a good time for you to do it! :)"
DMT,feufic1,t3_eqn7xm,1579386000.0,"I haven’t tried it myself yet but I see a lot of changes in my friends who have done it. It seems like they open up in their heart and personallity similar to how children are. Having more fun without anxiety and creative solutions come naturally for them. Some of them had been struggling to keep a job, but after DMT they found their path. Most of them running their own buisnesses or selling their own creations like art, music etc. I think DMT changes a person forever in a very positive way :)"

bipolar,fdrwz52,t1_fdrule1,1578690947.0,"1400$ a month and free health care. If the total income of everyone living in your house is under 2100$, they also cover your rent up to 750$. Not sure what you mean by food cards, but the income is supposed to cover groceries and bills for the month as well. But we also pay insane taxes when working, and also with everything we buy in the stores. When I went groceryshopping while staying with my family in New Jersey I felt like I was in heaven. One bottle of 0,5 Coca Cola here costs 3$ because of taxes. So there are pros and cons"

As long as I go to therapy and do things that will help me in the direction of a fulltime job the government supports me with ca 1400$ each month for up to 4 years. Mental health is equally reason for sick leave as a physical injury. Dont know if you have options like that over there?"

bipolar,fdgogcj,t1_fdgfsf6,1578403992.0,"It happened very recent, and I guess it is normal to use some time to progress it. I remember when saying goodbye to my grandfather when he was laying in the coffin before they closed it. I made him a bracelet that I wanted to put on his arm, and was not prepared of how cold and stiff he would be. Seeing death «in the eye» is very uncomfortable, but it also gave me a lot of questions that was good for me. Now, I am more ok with the tought of death than what I would be if I didnt search for the answers. Hope it gets better for you guys!"
Dreams,fdgdo1h,t3_el9c3e,1578391819.0,"I think that when dreams are very intense, they are crossing with our pineal gland and actually connecting with another person subconcioussly.

The humor in this community is more based on that set of mind where you say fuck you to everyone who tries to cheer you up. I think it is nice that we can laugh about that mood as well"
