relationships,ffxyfx7,t3_evrl0f,1580334888.0,"The only thing imo that I would have to say I disagree in your points would be expecting assistance with gas for visiting him, solution would be to see him less. I used to drive \~120Kms a day just to see my gf and then be go to work. When I could have driven about 50 or 30 kms in total, and I never once expected her to pay up for gas. Every other bit I agree, but perhaps if this would have not been an issue from the start, you might not have felt the stress to consider the break up and for him to move in with you. 

&#x200B;

The most important thing is always going to be communication. If you do expect some things, for example some compensation for gas, to discuss with concrete information. If he would not be assisting you and you felt it was too much, to simply stop visiting, picking him up etc, as you would not be okay with it, and if that would cause the stress in the relationship, you stick with you and what you want; If he wants to be with you he will see how to adjust himself to you. 

I'm probably too high atm and rambled a bit there, but def kick him out or have a grown ass conversation reminding him of his age and wtf he wants to do with his life, and if he seriously thinks you should be a part of it, and take it from there."

I remember seeing that post, reading her title, then reading her eyes a form of faking to be fine (insert peace fingers) to the internet as a fake to oneself. Again, this would be the best form I could put it into a none cringey idea that might have past her mind. Would a text post have been better, yeah def. But also dumping shit on the girl just because attention seeking is the only option, not true, a lot of plausible alternatives.
