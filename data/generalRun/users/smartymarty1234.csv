Assuming he pays no interest on his payments, which is usually how it is with carriers here in the us, and it is just the lump sum divide by a certain amount of months, he actually gains money by doing the payments instead of the lump sum because 1, that money is otherwise accessible to him, and 2, it could be accruing interest in his savings account, sometimes with a good amount of interest or his retirement accounts or stock market accounts which have even higher interest rates. So, he is actually making money by not spending it in the lump sum and if he's going to stick with the phone for that period anyways, there is no loss to him."

ACT,fdjakjh,t1_fdiloqa,1578463346.0,"Hey, my biggest advice, and you've probably heard this a lot, but it's what I did, is to take practice tests. I first went through a review book entirely in about 1 to 2 weeks and tried to see what strategies they talked about that I could use to work with like learning how to eliminate answers, and for the science, skimmkng the passage, reading questions and then going for the answer, or for different strategies to use with math. After that, it was practice test one day, review what I got wrong the next, and then take a break day, and then start going over individual sections instead of taking the full test and really analyzing what's I was missing. I kept a running list of types of problems I had problems with, especially in math, and then kept track of my improvement. Then I repeated. I did this starting about 3 months before the test. For reading, I would say go over the fundamental grammar rules first and do some regular contact practice. This is just my method, so it may not work for you based on how you learn but I was also like you, not able to stay focused and tiring through the sections. No matter what, I would say you need practice tests. In addition, try to save the official ones for closer to the tests and take ones made by other companies or you find online first so that you have original material to work with. Good luck!"

ACT,fdhu98k,t1_fdhtjvu,1578430253.0,"I think you have a good chance for a 34. I would say what helped me that absolute most is doing practice tests. I studied by reading through one of those princeton review, or any other, test review books for strategies and general info about the tests. I spent maybe about a week to 2 weeks. After that, it was just practice tests. I did a practice test 1 day, reviewed answers the next, break, and then over four days take specific sections of a test and go in depth into what I needed to work on. I created a running tally of problems that I had issues with and would cross them off when i was finally able to get similar problems in other tests. This method very well may not work for you, but even so, i would say the biggest test is to take practice tests. I saved all of the official ones until closer to the test date and did other ones I found online and in review books and stuff first."
