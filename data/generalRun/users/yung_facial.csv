leopardgeckos,fc1l4mn,t3_efkgts,1577322025.0,I've actually driven tons of snakes and geckos 8+ hours. The way I do it is put them in a little tub with breathing holes in the top. Put their tub in a styrofoam cooler or something else insulated. Tape a probe thermometer to the tub the gecko is in. And then fill a couple water bottles with hot water wrapped in paper towel and put them in the cooler as well. You will have to stop every now and then to refill the bottles so just keep an eye on the temp.
