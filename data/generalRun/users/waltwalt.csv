But yes we are on the same page, if you can't find a breeder for the breed you want you're not going to get a dog you don't want from a shelter. But the people that want to argue about it won't use logic, just emotions and will setup strawmen just like this to argue on.

I recently just purchased a farm and was toying with breeding hunting dogs as I love dogs and there are a lot of local hunters. But between dogs that get left in fields after their hunting usefulness expires and the 10,000 dogs a day put down in shelters, I couldn't bring myself to breed dogs for profit. We will be doing goats instead."

Something like 10,000 dogs are put down every day in North America because of the overpopulation issue.

I know it doesn't quite make sense. If you want a mini toy poodle but can't find one you're not going to go adopt a Labrador or bulldog, you're going to keep looking for a breeder of toy poodles.

It's the large puppy Mills that just breed as many dogs as possible to sell that are the cause of the problem, but efforts to thwart them just aren't effective enough to solve the problem."
