brewing,fg6yjq6,t1_fg63nlp,1580579854.0,"The difference is the relative mass of sugar and water. While molten sugar does have an insane heat capacity, that is swamped by the volume of water.

By the way, I like your idea of caramelizing your sugar before you put it in the wort. It could very well add additional toasty flavors to your finished brew, as it does in abbey ales. But be careful with it. Molten sugar sticks to things and can give you serious burns. Read up on candy making some before you try to make caramel: it goes from caramel to burnt in no time. If the sugar burns, throw it away. It will add nothing but sadness to your finished brew."
brewing,fg6xx62,t1_fg6i4p0,1580579441.0,"Actually, if you’re making kvass, you don’t need to worry that much about sanitization from fermenting point of view. Real old-school kvass uses raisins as a source of wild yeast, which also has lactobacillus, which causes gradual souring. That is typical of wild-inoculated, low-alcohol small farmhouse ales like Finnish sahti and Swedish gotlandsdricke. 

However, it is true that sanitation is crucial if you want to avoid any souring. It just sort of depends on what character you’re going for."

The story is spectacular.

Some facts:
-They had no navigation maps, so they used some maps they got from a local library in Australia
-They had no funds, but a banker gave them an unsecured $500 cash loan to buy fuel along the way
-They flew directly over the Kaaba when (illegally) crossing over Saudi Arabia
-They landed on the river in Leopoldville after hours of flying over trackless rain forest, in a plane that had only pontoons, not wheels

There’s way more to the story.

Apparently there was a movie announced in 2007 but AFAICT it never happened.
