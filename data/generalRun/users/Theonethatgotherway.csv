I'm glad she had you to not only help her to regain some of her autonomy, but that you were here to share with the rest of us. I've had this suspicion for a while, but no one would confirm it.

Denver,feir8vm,t1_feiqtji,1579145195.0,"Now a new study in the journal PLoS ONE adds another bizarre piece to the tale: When male rats infected with Toxoplasma smell cat urine, they have altered activity in the fear part of the brain as well as increased activity in the part of the brain that is responsible for sexual behavior and normally activates after exposure to a female rat.


The double messages of “you smell a cat but he’s not dangerous” and “that cat is a potential mate” lure the rat into the kitty’s deadly territory, just what the parasite needs to reproduce. Scientists still don’t know how the parasite works to alter the brain, though there apparently is a link to production of dopamine, an important neurotransmitter in the systems for decision-making and reward."

A tal fine, dirò che c'è sicuramente più libertà sessuale, ma è normalizzata / regolata in diverse comunità per motivi di sicurezza. Ho amici nelle comunità bdsm, poli, monogome, cis e lgbtq che sono tutti adulti felici e di buon funzionamento che hanno supporto e normali vite per appuntamenti."
italy,fd9nszm,t1_fd9m1k1,1578235820.0,"Yeah there is a bit of a pendulum swing in the other direction happening right now in some places to make up for the defecit in others. On one hand you've got the rape culture that was rampant in Hollywood and on the other, you've got PC culture calling everyone a rapist. But in the middle is good intention and a very important need for power of choice. It's everyone's right to be respected and loved in their own way. ""As long as you're not hurting anyone else, go for it""seems to be the general feeling.

Sì, c'è un po 'di un'oscillazione del pendolo nell'altra direzione che sta accadendo proprio ora in alcuni punti per compensare il deficit in altri. Da un lato hai la cultura dello stupro dilagante a Hollywood e, dall'altro, hai la cultura del PC che chiama tutti uno stupratore. Ma nel mezzo c'è una buona intenzione e un bisogno molto importante di potere di scelta. È diritto di tutti essere rispettati e amati a modo loro. ""Finché non fai del male a nessun altro, provaci"" sembra essere la sensazione generale."

i can't tell if this is a joke or not but will answer anyway. there is definitely more sexual freedom and acceptance of different types of sexuality(where i live and in larger cities). I um... have never been swapped so I can't speak to that, but there's a sub Reddit for everything they say! as far as troubled romantic relationships,i would chalk that perception up to the fact that there's just more options so people are more likely to talk to more potential partners before hooking up. dating apps are super popular with my generation and frankly, I suppose it's better than a bar because at least you know both parties are consenting and more likely to be sober... overall though, I'd say people are just less aggressive about dating because it is so easy to find people due to technology now
non so dire se questo è uno scherzo o no, ma risponderò comunque. c'è sicuramente più libertà sessuale e accettazione di diversi tipi di sessualità (dove vivo e nelle città più grandi). Io ... non sono mai stato scambiato, quindi non posso parlarne, ma c'è un Reddit secondario per tutto ciò che dicono! per quanto riguarda le relazioni romantiche travagliate, aggiungerei questa percezione al fatto che ci sono solo più opzioni, quindi le persone hanno maggiori probabilità di parlare con più potenziali partner prima di collegarsi. le app di appuntamenti sono molto popolari con la mia generazione e francamente, suppongo sia meglio di un bar perché almeno sai che entrambe le parti sono consenzienti e hanno maggiori probabilità di essere sobrie ... nel complesso, però, direi che le persone sono solo meno aggressive riguardo agli appuntamenti perché è così facile trovare persone grazie alla tecnologia ora"

The truth is that when you live in more isolated areas, there is not a lot of variety when it comes to economic opportunities. Small towns are small towns wherever you go and the lower class tend to bear the brunt of the cost of the upper. I would rather live in the US for now because I love in a city that is well connected, exiting, beautiful and friendly. I can rely on an extensive friend group for just about anything because we're all growing together and are independent enough to achieve on our own terms. That being said, I hate the consumerist attitude that is bringing the planet down. It's classic teenage country behavior. Live like there's no tomorrow. Well hopefully we will avoid that still fulfilling prophecy. The town I'm in has an emphasis on sustainability and eco- friendly practices as well as an emphasis on open-mindedness and acceptance towards different communities and Feliz which gives me hope. The rest of the state is, well.. Texas. So that sucks lol. Italy is much more mature in it's policy, but the people are a bit more negative and the infrastructure is a bit scary

sono pienamente d'accordo. un altro motivo che volevo chiarire. le opportunità di lavoro sono fantastiche qui. ho pensato di trasferirmi in Italia a causa del nostro presidente e dei problemi che sicuramente avrebbe portato, ma la vita non è così facile in Italia come qui. lasciatemi sostenere ulteriormente tale affermazione dicendo che sono un artista a tempo pieno. vivo molto bene. l'istruzione e l'accesso alle risorse sono abbondanti ed è sorprendente. la generazione più anziana non è tanto responsabile del tuo destino finanziario e ideologico, quindi sei libero di interagire e crescere come preferisci. sì, c'è un limite a questo, come dimostrato dal nostro presidente recentemente impeacher, ma la stampa libera alla fine trova la sua strada. sì, purtroppo il cibo non è così fresco. ma è più abbondante e diversificato."
