namenerds,feftm2f,t1_fee6pz0,1579064819.0,"I am an Olivia born in the early 90s. I rarely ever meet people my age or older with my name. I always loved it, and it did feel pretty unique for a while — I never had an Olivia in my class growing up until I went to college (she had my first AND middle name and was only about 6 days older than me!). I do think it’s interesting how the name has grown in popularity. I got a lot of compliments on my name growing up. Now I work in education and am just barely starting to see the effects of the name popularity. I am kinda curious to see what happens as I get older and the kids get older...the more Olivias I meet."

Teachers,fd15jdy,t3_ejp8st,1578127743.0,"Third year here and I am currently in the trenches with you. I feel the bitterness building as I lament my terrible work-life balance and trying to address my habits. I had gained around 25-30 lbs and have been working on addressing that and my self-care habits. I walk during lunch with a co-worker and have been dipping my toes into intermittent fasting (hence skipped lunch). It helped me lose about 10-12 lbs since September, so it’s a start!"
