Edit:I counted 6 seconds of falling."
woodworking,ffkgmy9,t1_ffkgc4s,1580022440.0,Nice. One day I’ll treat myself to a new one. What do you use to sharpen? Thinking about getting some diamond stones. I’ve just been using cheap water stones since I started and they don’t stay very flat for long.
woodworking,ffkd2m4,t1_ffk9gce,1580020782.0,"You’re right. That really depends on the type of plane you’re using. There are planes that have a longer sole (the flat bottom) which reference more of the board to avoid riding the waves and compounding them. However, the edge of the plane can be used as a reference for straightness, a combination square can check for edge squareness, long straight edges and winding sticks (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winding_stick) can be used to check overall shape as well. As long as you’re aware of where the deficiencies are, you can plane in one particular spot more than others to bring the high spots down to one plane."

woodworking,ffk0st4,t1_ffjzsoi,1580012329.0,"Here’s a link if you’re look for some info: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(tool)
The plane in my picture is a Bailey No. 4 that I restored. They tend to be quite expensive, so as I’m just starting out as a woodworker I decided to buy cheap ones that need to be restored."
woodworking,ffjzdo0,t1_ffjypnc,1580011152.0,"Not sure if you’re being sarcastic, but in case you aren’t that’s called a hand plane. It uses a sharp blade pushed out slightly below the flat bottom to flatten, straighten, thin and shape wood. They come in many different sizes and types for various purposes."
