You have evidence ?? if yes, go and report it to the authorities, just don't sit back.

It's difficult for the people who are actually sexually harrassed to get their cases out, when whores like in my case, do it for their own selfish reasons, which ultimately deafens the purpose of calling out against harrassment.
