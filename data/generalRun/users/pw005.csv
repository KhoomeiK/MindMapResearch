CAA gives citizenship to minorities of 3 neighbouring countries who have been living in India before 2014-15.  


I agree that at some point government will have to give citizenship to illegal immigrants because numbers are huge and other solutions are not feasible. But, this and NRC should be done after borders are sealed.

Frankly, Anti NRC people have not been saying illegal immigration is a problem and put pressure on government to seal borders. Prod NRC people are very vocal about it.

In my opinion, considering the size of population of illegal immigrants, NRC will just give a list to government. There will be no action (except maybe in Assam). New about this exercise has already resulted in  illegal immigrants fleeing back. Before NRC is conducted, one will see huge number of immigrants fleeing.  


Have faith in mathematics if not in government. Numbers are so huge, it's not feasible to do anything except accept them. Rhetoric that illegal imm. will be thrown out is in some way necessary to stop incoming flow and start outgoing flow."

I hope the implementation of NRC will be relaxed keeping in mind that it would be fine if few illegal immigrants are given and no Indian Citizen is harrassed.

Practically speaking first thing that needs to be done is to seal 4000+km border with Bangladesh.

Also it wouldn't be feasible to keep crores of people in detention centers. Not possible therefore not gonna happen. Most of news pro and anti NRC is rhetoric.

CAA gives citizenship to minorities of 3 neighbouring countries who have been living in India before 2014-15.  


I agree that at some point government will have to give citizenship to illegal immigrants because numbers are huge and other solutions are not feasible. But, this and NRC should be done after borders are sealed.

Frankly, Anti NRC people have not been saying illegal immigration is a problem and put pressure on government to seal borders. Prod NRC people are very vocal about it.

In my opinion, considering the size of population of illegal immigrants, NRC will just give a list to government. There will be no action (except maybe in Assam). New about this exercise has already resulted in  illegal immigrants fleeing back. Before NRC is conducted, one will see huge number of immigrants fleeing.  


Have faith in mathematics if not in government. Numbers are so huge, it's not feasible to do anything except accept them. Rhetoric that illegal imm. will be thrown out is in some way necessary to stop incoming flow and start outgoing flow."

I always believe if matters can be resolved using peaceful negotiation, that's the way to go.

On ground reality is daily hundreds of Bangladeshi immigrants who entered illegally are fleeing back.

I hope the implementation of NRC will be relaxed keeping in mind that it would be fine if few illegal immigrants are given and no Indian Citizen is harrassed.

NRC should be delayed until border work is done to avoid incremental illegal immigration."

Practically speaking first thing that needs to be done is to seal 4000+km border with Bangladesh.

Also it wouldn't be feasible to keep crores of people in detention centers. Not possible therefore not gonna happen. Most of news pro and anti NRC is rhetoric.

Once the borders are sealed, then give citizenship to people who don't have, want it and are living in India. After that, periodic checks is the key.

I still think we needed to start somewhere unlike postponing long term problems like previous governments have done."
