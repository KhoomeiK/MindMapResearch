Your lesson from this is that you should probably stick to your guns more in the future and trust your gut. That’s not to say that this situation is your fault at all - but that it is always good for us to learn from our experiences. In this case it seems like you might’ve been better off to just rip that band aid off instead of being convinced into doing this.

His lesson ought to be that he can’t duct tape a relationship back together when it’s clearly fallen apart, OR if his motivation was to take advantage of you - then he’ll learn he can’t pull that shit - on you, at least - Whether he tries to do this to others in the future will be his choice.

I tend to be lenient, so I am considering the possibility that he just really wanted to make this work with you, but many other commenters have suggested he is just taking advantage, and I think that perspective is worth considering.

I don’t think it’s necessarily right or fair to expect people to socialize at work. I’m super introverted and frankly happier at work if I don’t get too involved with people. I prefer some separation between my personal and professional lives, and I don’t really want my coworkers giving me their undesired feedback on my personal life. (Which inevitably seems to happen as soon as they know anything about me).

That said, people are going to form judgements anyway, and if you’re not making an effort to at least be personable at work, then you’re kind of actively being a jerk at work.

The point is that homelessness has a root cause, and that’s what we want to investigate. By all means - YES, let’s create solutions to the problem like more homeless shelters especially to help homeless men, but let’s also fix the *root* of this issue so that no one need be homeless in the first place. If you just create solutions for the problem, you’re only helping one group - and that’s how we’ve wound up here! We didn’t set out to make homeless shelters just for women - we set out to help women feel like they had an option other than staying in an abusive situation. In creating the solution (more shelters for women) we left men behind. 

So on one hand, yes - do more to help those men left behind, and also - examine the root of problem more closely and develop solutions to not leave anyone behind.

Job hopping isn’t just something boomers get upset about - although it’s true they do - but they’ve also shaped the modern workplace culture and the reality is that too much job hopping looks bad, whether anyone likes it or not.

I live and work in the Bay Area where it’s very common to switch jobs every year or two, and it can still backfire on folks. 

A former close friend who is a somewhat famous engineer changed jobs every year for about five years. When he was interviewing for his current role he had to meet with the VP of product and convince him that he wouldn’t leave that job in under a year if they hired him. 

I’ve also been on the other end, where my company refused to hire a department head that our team *loved* because he had only been at his current role for 6 months.

My resume goes: 1 year, 3 years, 10 months, 1.5 years, current role (1.5 years) and I have never had a problem.

Job hopping is more acceptable than ever, but there are still some limits, and people will judge you for it. Don’t make it habit or a pattern, and try to get a few years under your belt somewhere. You can leave this current role, but you better make sure the next job you take is one where you can stick around for 2-3 years. Employers want to see that you can own work/projects over a period of time."

That out of the way - your resume gap might catch some people’s attention, but you can address it in your cover letter or in person. The fact that you’ve been moving and not really rooted is a perfectly reasonable explanation for that gap, and it’s a pretty small gap - I wouldn’t be concerned if I was interviewing you.

Lastly, just make sure you’re doing high quality applications rather than a high volume of applications. You can only apply once - make it count.

careerguidance,ff373vg,t1_ff2l12w,1579535263.0,"Visual designers can have all kinds of other skills - they could also *just* be good at the visual aspect of design. If that’s the case, those people typically do work as a ‘brand designer’ or just ‘visual designer’ at tech companies, and they could be doing some print design, icons, illustrations, and doing the visual side of user interfaces that a designer more focused on UX or UI made.

Generally though, at least in tech, everyone is a product designer meaning you’re going to be more well rounded. You can kind of pick and choose your hills and valleys, generally you need to be able to make good user interfaces - so you need to have a good sense of how to convey information to people and make it easy to use. Some of that is logic, some of that is visual.

There are tons of skills in design.
You could be good at user interviews/research, simple animation, visual design, coding, etc, etc. ultimately we need to make good interfaces and advocate for the user, and you can use a lot of different skills to get there. 

Code is an extra skill. It’s desirable to companies, but I have not actually coded at 4/5 design jobs. It is most useful just to understand and speak a common language with engineers. If you’re designing things, it’s good to know how they’re built.

Other extra skills are user research, simple animation, and visual design/illustration. Don’t get me wrong, you need some skill in all of these areas, but it can vary. If you’re highly skilled at coding or research, you can be worse at visuals. But there’s a minimum bar for quality in all of these.

I’d recommend looking at company design team blogs - Ueno is a product design agency with a great blog, Airbnb has a good blog, too. And I’d look for designers at those companies and browse their portfolios a bit. Often you can find case studies where designers walk you through a project and you can get a more concrete sense of what skills they used and what that looks like.


I’ve been really happy with this line of work. As a product designer, I have one of the most fun jobs in the office. I get to make the things our users interact with all day, and sometimes I do random stuff like design shirts and stickers for the team just for kicks. Everyone sees the stuff I make, I get to talk to our users all the time (I love user research). And it’s generally a challenging, fun job. Uses lots of different skills and ways of thinking. The pay is also good. I’m in range with a lot of engineers, but my job is much less stressful. No one is measuring my productivity the way engineers are constantly being measured.

That said, I definitely still overwork at times. Tech jobs are kinda hectic and fast paced which can mean figuring a lot of shit out on your own and short deadlines. You get good at setting expectations and boundaries, or you overwork!

It has all depended on the job. In my current job I am happier than I have ever been at work. I love my team and the product I get to design (I work on social good) Our workspace is cool - you typically get free snacks, a company laptop, some shirts - the most important thing is the culture of an office. Work with nice people whenever you can. My last job was the complete opposite from my current job - it was a toxic, abusive workspace, and the product designers were often tasked with doing shady things and creating ‘dark’ UX patterns. Most of my jobs have been pretty fun, though.

I think design is a great job and a lot of fun!"

careerguidance,ff08ing,t3_er00kz,1579466297.0,"I’m a product designer in the Bay Area. 

Product designers do everything - user experience design, interface design, interaction design, and visual design. I also know basic front end code (which a lot of companies seem to ask for, and only about 10% of them actually have you use those skills on the job). I do a lot of user interviews, and a lot of visual and technical designing. It’s a fun job with a lot of variety, and people in roles like mine tend to be generalists but have different hills and valleys. For instance, you might be better at coding but not so great at visuals. Different skill sets mean different opportunities might be open to you, some companies will need or value skills over others. I consider myself to be really even in all areas, and I think it has made me very employable.

In my experience here, product design is what’s most common in most tech companies. You need to be able to do a little bit of everything, including visual. This is still a job for creative people with good aesthetic sense. You could be being too hard on yourself, you could be right that it isn’t for you - it’s hard to say. If you really can’t stand visuals/aren’t good at them, you could still find work as a product designer, but if your ‘valley’ is too deep it’ll be a bit harder to land jobs. I’ve worked with a few designers like this though. And some places will sometimes be specifically looking for someone with that skill set. Less common, but also an option is working somewhere that organizes their teams into interaction design and visual design, so the work is split. AFAIK google still does this. You mostly see this at bigger, harder to get in to companies who have so many employees they can break apart that kind of work.
