Lol no."
worldnews,ferr8v7,t1_feqdwlg,1579357429.0,The only thing I know about Belgium is they make a lot of chocolate.
television,fejgkja,t1_fejce81,1579173238.0,It's a plausible enough theory. The fake serial killer storyline felt out of place in a show that was almost TOO realistic.
television,feiphgq,t1_feii48o,1579143986.0,I finished watching it recently. It was top tier but season 5 rubbed me the wrong the way to an extent.
MurderedByWords,fehavf3,t1_feh7b0a,1579112766.0,"> the twitter hot-take sphere never seems to go that route

I think I only saw one person actually criticize his policies but even then, she made a complete fool of herself."
MurderedByWords,fef6imv,t1_fef65ba,1579049344.0,That bastard!
MurderedByWords,fef6h5u,t1_fef643q,1579049316.0,Are you insinuating that The Washington Post has an agenda? I refuse to believe you. /s
MurderedByWords,fef69cw,t1_fef5qeh,1579049172.0,"Yeah, it feels like a lot of people expect their preferred candidate to be perfect.

I won't lie to you. I wasn't sure if you were joking."
MurderedByWords,fef54ot,t1_fef3qp0,1579048404.0,"To be honest, I think this whole ""controversy"" is trivial. It's manufactured outrage."
MurderedByWords,fef46bg,t1_fef2t3r,1579047762.0,"> apparently politicians are supposed to have an entire reformation plan drawn up individually for every ethnicity, gender, and demographic individually.

I've noticed that people who think that way are some of the most self righteous assholes on the planet. I hate arguing with them because they either patronize me or outright curse me out."
MurderedByWords,fef1g56,t1_fef0do4,1579045933.0,"It's a little ironic, huh? 

""Don't watch this show, it promotes satanism"" has been replaced with ""Don't watch this show, it's problematic""."
MurderedByWords,fef0mio,t1_feeyyxz,1579045389.0,"You hit the nail on the head. And anytime they get asked WHY they think he's sexist/racist, they make up an utterly stupid reason.

""Bernie's policies don't explicitly mention helping xyz. Therefore, they don't help xyz in any way.""

That seems to be the most popular one lol."
MurderedByWords,feevi23,t1_feetu45,1579042104.0,"> But what that panelist did was assume Bernie was being sexist, then talk over his explanation of his comment to offer an even more sexist ""summary"" of his statement. What a load of bullshit.

It's pretty funny how people like them are unable to just say ""I don't support Bernie because I don't think his policies would work.""

No, every decision they make HAS to be a show of moral superiority."
MurderedByWords,feeuerd,t1_feetztz,1579041434.0,"Yeah, a lot of people are pissed at her right how."
MurderedByWords,feespmq,t1_feerlae,1579040390.0,"> He told Elizabeth Warren that he thought it would be difficult for a woman to win the election in the present climate. Clearly it was in the context of an actual discussion on demographics and on voters' perception of electability, which is a legitimate concern.

As soon as I saw the headline I assumed that that was what he meant. The only people that think he's a sexist are the ones that never liked him in the first place."
MurderedByWords,feesahq,t1_feeq015,1579040137.0,"Yeah, I know about the video. It makes the whole situation even dumber lol."
MurderedByWords,feepoz6,t1_feepe3v,1579038603.0,"Right now people are up his ass because he allegedly said ""women can't be president"" or some shit."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fedv26o,t3_eonobr,1579020507.0,Black noses aren't big so much as differently shaped lol.
AskReddit,febpg26,t1_febnsyn,1578961295.0,"Ah, I see. I always assumed most of the people that talked like that were the ""I'm offended on xyz's behalf"" type. Thanks for the insight!"
AskReddit,febn6y8,t1_feamgnz,1578960621.0,"Which group do you think is most guilty of saying ""it's transphobic to not want to date a trans person?

People who are actually trans or people that wanna speak for them?"
facepalm,fdzbiuf,t1_fdz7z1i,1578788528.0,It's probably both to be honest.
facepalm,fdai2kb,t1_fdaecns,1578246351.0,"No, because I already know about those things. I read about it a long time ago. 

Anyway, I found out the OP was leaving out important context so I've changed my opinion."
nottheonion,fda5r47,t1_fd98ikl,1578242072.0,That's not incompetence lol. He's just a cunt.
facepalm,fda5kb1,t1_fd9ycfg,1578241985.0,"Why even turn it into a discussion about gender? Are there people that wouldn't care about homelessness otherwise?

Edit - I checked out other comments and it turns out OP was leaving out important context."
television,fd65vpe,t1_fd64xbh,1578185956.0,I MIGHT enjoy the show but I absolutely agree with you about the animation. It's one of the main reasons why I avoided Rebels for so long. I especially don't like how thin the lightsabers are.
television,fd654i9,t1_fd61uv2,1578185658.0,Hmm... I like your review. It was harsh but fair.
television,fd61nvz,t1_fd5yqup,1578184296.0,"I wish Disney wasn't so obsessed with making Star Wars kid friendly. I mean, they let Marvel show Thanos getting his head chopped off. 

Anyway, I'll check out Rebels but it's low priority. I KNOW it won't be as good as Clone Wars but it's canon so I gotta at least try it.

Thanks for giving me your opinion."
television,fd5zanz,t1_fd5rr4c,1578183395.0,"Hmm. I'll check out the 1st season but it's VERY low priority. I think I'll binge watch clone wars first. I was never able to watch all the episodes because of cartoon network's shitty schedule.

Thanks for giving me your opinion."
television,fd5gcyz,t1_fd3b4nq,1578177312.0,"Should I bother with Rebels? How good is it, on a scale of 1-10?"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fd4tehn,t1_fd4mi55,1578170903.0,I think he said that he would try.
MurderedByWords,fd0979w,t1_fczvkjf,1578115507.0,"Dude, even I wasn't sure LMAO. I knew about his tweets but I didn't know there was an actual interview."
news,fckvv20,t1_fcknix7,1577734307.0,I rarely interact with that sub unless a post reaches the front page. How bad is it? Most of the posts I've seen were self-deprecating but I remember one or two making me uncomfortable.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fckspmo,t1_fckpxde,1577732361.0,"Oh, I know all about that lol. I know full well that the word ""ghetto"" is rooted in racism and classism against black Americans.

You don't need to ask yourself ""does u/jaytix1 know about this?"". Trust me, I'm woke."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fckqmpk,t1_fckowfj,1577731081.0,"I've heard of that before, yes."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fckincs,t1_fckee5x,1577726164.0,"Yeah, that makes sense."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fckiexg,t1_fckefhm,1577726021.0,Ohh lol.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fckhswf,t1_fcke6rq,1577725635.0,"You want me to be BLUNT? 

1. ""Ghetto"" names are names that are associated with poor black Americans. They are usually derived from an African or Middle Eastern language. 

2. White people will call your name ghetto just because it isn't traditional. Black people will do it when they think your name sounds ridiculous. So... it depends on who you're talking to.

3. Names like Pilot or Mary Jo or Mary Beth would not be called ""ghetto"". They would be called ""white"", which could mean a) very bland or b) very snowflake-y."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fckcxbo,t1_fckaver,1577722517.0,"That's super racist but I gotta laugh at how PETTY your mom sounds.

""I'll be voting for Romney, not Barack HUSSEIN Obama."""
BlackPeopleTwitter,fckc0bq,t1_fcka72s,1577721913.0,"You want me to be blunt?

It's a name that is associated with poor black Americans. They are often derived from an African or middle Eastern language because black Americans want to distance themselves from white Americans. 

White Americans often think that these names are automatically ""ghetto"" because they sound unusual. Black Americans usually have no problem with these names, obviously, but if they think a name sounds ridiculous, they'll call it ghetto too.

You know how everybody makes fun of white people for giving their kids names like ""Neveah"" or ""Abcde""? Yeah."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fck9ud8,t1_fck9kyk,1577720432.0,That's absolutely true lol.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fck9dyo,t1_fck8j2i,1577720109.0,"lol yeah. The irony is that westerners would think it was badass. Shit, a lot of ""black"" names refer to royalty if I'm not mistaken."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fck93sp,t1_fck8ld7,1577719911.0,"Oh yeah, I always forget that. Thanks for the correction."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fck8p0n,t1_fck827w,1577719624.0,LMAO Obama is lucky that a) most people call presidents by their last name and b) Hussein was just his middle name.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fck8e8a,t1_fck7g04,1577719408.0,"Yep! I've never heard of that term but I assume it's about names that have super pretentious meanings. 

I remember the protagonist of Durarara being embarrassed because his parents gave him a name that more or less means ""Emperor of the dragon's mountain""."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fck7nya,t1_fck7esd,1577718859.0,Oh yeah lmao. I stand corrected.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fck79il,t1_fck681o,1577718554.0,"Yeah, anytime a REALLY bad person comes about, their name becomes taboo. Like, the name ""Donald"" was already losing popularity but Trump put the final nail in the coffin."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fck6gwk,t1_fck5yks,1577717937.0,"Ohhh. I didn't know that Iraqis used that system. 

But anyway, I think the problem conservatives had with Obama was a mix of ""I hate black people"" and ""I hate Muslims""."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fck5lff,t1_fck5012,1577717244.0,"> I mean Obama being one letter off from Osama was a big deal with a bunch of people too.

That's true, though one could make the argument that Bin Laden is to blame for that. It's like how a certain German ruined ""Adolf "" and ""Hitler"". 

But you made a good point about his first name. I've been told that he used to be called Barry for a long time."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fck52lr,t1_fck3qd4,1577716820.0,You know what? That's a fair point.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fck4z99,t1_fck3bsu,1577716746.0,"Yeah, there'll always be people who are like ""your name sounds too foreign"" but some parents, of all races, really do give their children names that are VERY unusual. 

You've got white kids with names like ""Abcde"" and black kids with names like ""NaOnka""."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fck3iwe,t1_fck36mn,1577715513.0,"Obviously lmao. I think the only part of his name that people bothered him about was ""Hussein"" and that was because of Saddam ruining it for everybody."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fck32ls,t1_fcjnj5o,1577715117.0,"Yeah, but there's a threshold lmao. Most of my friends have African/West Indian names but none of them sound stupid."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fck2xai,t1_fcjove2,1577714988.0,"In Obama's defense, his name isn't ghetto. It's just non-Anglo."
news,fc6kmxo,t1_fc6j2v4,1577482821.0,Ikr? I had to read it twice because I couldn't understand why she would tell on herself.
OutOfTheLoop,fc5l3of,t1_fc4qxwl,1577460489.0,I've got the same problem lol.
quityourbullshit,fbytmw0,t1_fbysy95,1577226011.0,"Yep! It even happens to people who have lived in a country for generations. I once saw it happen to Native Americans lol. 

Absolute dumbfuckery."
