And when done reading the TOS 99.9% of the products will be disqualified. You cannot live in America with privacy unless you live off grid and hunt/gather for food for 100% of your needs. That's kinda my point. We need to recognize where we are. Accept we're fucked. And do 1 of two things - Absolutely nothing because we are not worthy of being saved after allowing the mega rich to own us as societal slaves. Mega corporations control every aspect of our politics even at the local level. Therefore consumers will do nothing because the businesses don't want to change and the population as a whole are just too uneducated to even know they're being fucked or care enough to change. Or, overturn Citizens United, destroy American economics from the ground up and tax the everloving fuck out of the rich with mandatory and unquestioned federal prison time for hiding money in tax havens. Completely change the fabric of American police forces by forcing legislation that legally binds police officers to protect the public abolishing any and all law enforcement unions and lobbyists (lobbying would fall under the removal of American economic thankfully). Should I even start with the IMC? What if you want to go to a different country? How would you control your privacy? The point is what we might expect for privacy is already nonexistent and we need to make a plan on how to fix it. Not just keep the ball rolling for profits (COUGH THERE'S THE PROBLEM COUGH). Also when I said younger generation I did not mean millennials."
