fatlogic,ffm2d7c,t1_ffm15c7,1580047405.0,"Second story: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharin
Saccharin was produced first in 1879, by Constantin Fahlberg, a chemist working on coal tar derivatives in Ira Remsen's laboratory at Johns Hopkins University.[17] Fahlberg noticed a sweet taste on his hand one evening, and connected this with the compound benzoic sulfimide on which he had been working that day."
fatlogic,ffm15c7,t1_ffjz0ur,1580046835.0,"As I remember such accidental discovery happened twice for two different sweeteners totally unrelated in terms of chemical structure. In one case, a chemist was smoking, second case I don't remember what he was doing.
ETA: here is the story https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_cyclamate
""Cyclamate was discovered in 1937 at the University of Illinois by graduate student Michael Sveda. Sveda was working in the lab on the synthesis of anti-fever medication. He put his cigarette down on the lab bench, and, when he put it back in his mouth, he discovered the sweet taste of cyclamate"""

fatlogic,ff7smmt,t1_ff7n4si,1579657375.0,"As someone who comes from a country with very low quality of life, I'd also add that in third world countries it is very hard to get proper medical treatment and people die from diseases that are totally treatable/manageble in Western countries. So the doctors you're talking about probably chose medical profession because they really wanted  to help people. Must be frustrating to deal with patients who refuse to be helped and waste your time bitching about how being weighed hurts their feelings."
fatlogic,ff5x2z5,t1_ff5uv1q,1579613128.0,"One of the ways is ""small seats in the restaurants"". It is funny that they focus specifically on restaurants, not other places where people go for entertainment, like theaters, stadiums, music halls, etc."
fatlogic,ff5w9p0,t1_ff5daef,1579612378.0,"I struggle with eating on public, can confirm. And small talks about food make me panic. And I've never been fat. Must be even harder for fat people."
fatlogic,feyuc10,t1_fexcefw,1579450620.0,Just a post here? I've heard it offline from some women I've met personally.
fatlogic,fem7q9q,t1_felek7a,1579242778.0,"Damn, you were the first to comment. I also thought about similarities between junk food and cigarettes."
fatlogic,fem7gyb,t1_feldfgm,1579242503.0,">i could actually imagine some some soda companies out there actually advising this person to listen to their doctor


It made me think about warning statements on cigarette packs and liquor bottles. Actually it is not a bad idea to put warnings about obesity and obesity-related diseases on soda bottles."
fatlogic,fem6zlg,t3_eppewe,1579241995.0,"Well, ""other thread"" is right actually. There's some evidence that sugar by itself does not cause diabetes. What she misunderstood is that the problem is not sugar, it is consuming too many calories. And the obvious way to decrease caloric intake is to stop drinking soda.

Well, now I realize why my Dr goes on explaining me in detail very basic and obvious things. Because there are patients like OP."
fatlogic,fem64ls,t1_feku6fc,1579241100.0,"Idk, maybe 1200 was a standard weight-loss plan for women in the pre-internet times, no online TDEE calculators => many people were too lazy to search for TDEE formulas and do calculations themselves and just used 1200. To me this number looks quite reasonable, small enough to lose weight, but large enough to get all necessary nutrients and stay healthy. However, I, personally, would be hangry AF on 1200, but I am a bit taller and more muscular than average woman and quite active."
fatlogic,fem54l5,t1_fejcg5j,1579240089.0,"Thanks for clarification! I currently live in the US (but will move to London in a few months) and have never heard using ""fire"" in this context."
fatlogic,fej6pvg,t1_fegmyuv,1579159163.0,"I feel you about feeling ashamed of eating anything other than salad in front of people. When I have to eat in front of people, I'd rather eat a salad than a sandwich or a cake. Especially now when I have some coworkers who love to discuss food, and would always ask me what I am eating, is it tasty, etc. I don't think they mean anything bad or judge my, but it still makes me anxious AF."
fatlogic,fej66s8,t1_feizaxv,1579158517.0,"Yes, you've got it right, that's similar to what my therapist told me when he threatened to fire me. He basically said that if I don't comply there is no point in treatment and it is a waste of his time and insurance company's money.
Also TIL that word ""fire"" can also apply to client, not only to employee. English is not my first language so it was quite interesting."
fatlogic,fego64f,t1_fegkh8u,1579098513.0,"Yep I've had both ""couldn't walk next day because of sore leg muscles"" and GI issues during ultramarathon distance trailrunning competitions - I did several 50-mile races, 100 km one and 94 km one, and rogaining Europe championships, which are, basically, ""run as far as you can in 24 hours on rough terrain"". But this is unhealthy and harmful, I have no illusions about it. I am willing to take the risks because I love those sports. 
And I can't imagine this happening during regular Zumba or other type of dance/aerobics class.  Either ""can't walk"" is a huge exaggeration , or you're doing smth wrong, or that person had some serious health condition. I know quite well that moderate muscle soreness the next day after workout is normal, key word is ""moderate"".
But good for you and your clients that they enjoy classes and keep coming back.
Edit: grammar"
fatlogic,fegk3zh,t1_fegj693,1579095176.0,"Yes, I fear eating in public and never do it unless it is unavoidable - like a professional discussion over lunch, but even then I eat very little, don't finish my portion and feel very anxious. I don't think I have BED. I don't feel out of control and remember what I ate, and was at bmi 25 at my fattest. I overeat in the evenings because I don't eat all day due to fear of eating on public. It is more like some weird form of social anxiety rather than BED. But I am in therapy and already see some progress.
Sorry about your struggles with BED, hope it got better - from how you wrote about it I guess it is in the past.
ETA: sorry about being unclear, English is not my first language."
fatlogic,feghn4v,t1_fegdilo,1579093051.0,"Just curious, what was your marathon time? I ran marathons when I was a bit overweight (bmi 25 point something) and my typical time would be around 4:20-4:30. Then I lost some weight and my time significantly improved. Still have a lot to lose though, 5'5"" 140 is still quite fat for a runner."
fatlogic,feghcnz,t1_fefyn5e,1579092786.0,">people tell me they couldn't walk the next day 
>someone literally pooped in their pants 
 
Doesn't it mean that there is something wrong with your classes? These things are not good or healthy."
fatlogic,fefoozu,t1_fefmzpi,1579061012.0,"Aaaaw I see. Sounds like a classic FA who are often featured on this sub. But I hope that bodypositive fitness professionals who are more sensible and don't take a good idea too far still exist.

Well idk maybe images of donuts and cupcakes are more aestetically pleasing than photos of burgers or fries. I am also not a fan of sweets, but I am heavier than I want to be bc I love savory calorie-dense food (eating a sandwich with olive paste while typing this)."
fatlogic,fefmguw,t1_fefhgsf,1579059505.0,"No, havn't watched and I have no idea who Michelle McDaniel is. And the title suggests that I probably wouldn't like that video. Though I am an ardent feminist, donut part is unnecessary and sounds kinda gross. But I fully support the idea of fat-positive fitness classes (but without donuts and harmful pseudoscience), might be very helpful for folks who are insecure about their weight. Because yes fatshaming does exist and it sucks.
Also, why is it always donuts or cakes? Why not beer and sausage, for example?"
fatlogic,fefknt6,t1_fe8zaaj,1579058350.0,"If you're making it only sub-4 hours you'll not qualify for Boston. But seriously, I know a guy who loves to say ""I don't train hard, I train smart"" but surprise surprise he's not a good runner. This approach does not work for endurance sports."
fatlogic,fefj3w2,t1_fecr4qp,1579057394.0,"Biomedical scientist here. I know several obese colleagues who do research on obesity-related topics, like studying mechanistic links between obesity and obesity-related diseases. It is surprising and sad at the same time.

fatlogic,feffddz,t3_eotnc6,1579055153.0,Overeating is harmful for everyone. Not just those who are knowingly obese. Because it affects healthcare costs and contributes to environmental crisis.
fatlogic,fefdz3g,t1_fef309d,1579054282.0,"But in that case, ""your body is your buisness card"" applies to FA fitness professionals as well lol))) Their buisness card basically says that their classes are fat-friendly and are a safe space for FA clients. And no, they are not going to take jobs from muscular and lean fitness professionals, they just have different target audiences."
fatlogic,fefcj3k,t1_feedldt,1579053352.0,"Yes, that makes sense. However, I have never been diagnosed with eating disorder. I am not sure if fear of eating on public, so I often have to skip meals and then overeat when I come home, qualifies as eating disorder."
fatlogic,fefbt35,t3_eoue6r,1579052875.0,"Well, it is correct that metabolism rate slightly goes down when you're in caloric deficit for long enough time. And how much it slows down depends on how large is the deficit.  What is incorrect is 1) calling it ""starvation mode"" - no, 1200 cal a  day is not starvation 2) assumption that it is harmful and unhealthy 3) it is not mentioned  in this post, but they grossly overestimate the effect of adaptive thermogenesis. No, you're not gonna gain weight from eating a cup of lettuce. Even during severe undereating, metabolism rate goes down by, like, 15%. And it is totally reversible."
fatlogic,fecg0os,t1_fecdnny,1578973024.0,"Lol wasn't that obvious from the beginning that this sub is anti-obesity (aka ""fatfobic"")?"
fatlogic,fecet69,t1_feawl03,1578972213.0,"Well, there can be shitty therapists out there. I was seeing a therapist for body image issues and severe anxiety about eating on public and other food-related stuff. I was at healthy weight tho, closer to upper and of healthy bmi than to the lower end. She said that losing some weight might help me and gave me a lot of standard advice on healthy eating and weight loss, like ""you should eat more veggies and avoid sugar"", ""write down the reasons to lose weight and re-read them when you feel like snacking"", ""when you're hungry find ways to distract yourself fron thinking about food, like go for a walk"". When I asked if there are methods to fix my body image problem other than weight loss, she insisted that CBT for weight lost is the best choice for me. Also she used to complain that people eat so unhealthy these days, consumerism culture is awful, etc., with which I kinda agree, but her rants were not helpful for my mental health and sent me to guilt trip instead. So yes at some point I started to suspect that something is wrong and I might know better than the therapist. Eventually I left her and found another therapist who is amazing. 
Also, looks like OP didn't have great experience with therapy. Good therapists usually find a way to work through client's denial.
That being said, being concerned about patient's/client's weight gain, especially if they are already overweight, is not a sign of unprofessionalism by itself."
fatlogic,fdyyu2y,t3_en9y8m,1578784929.0,"Looks like she does not know the difference between mean (""average""), median, and mode. Since weight/size distribution in the population is not symmetrical, these are not the same. I can't take her seroliously after that. Also, Idk about English, but in my first language  the word ""normal"" can mean both ""statistically normal"" (i.e. common) and ""medically normal"" (i.e. healthy, without disease) and many people don't understand the difference. And in the case of weight medical norm is different from statistical norm."
fatlogic,fd5ezsk,t3_ek22r9,1578176967.0,"So, they mean that restricting food intake in any way is bad, leads to famine mode and bingeing? Unbelievable.
And what about avoiding certain foods or even fasting for religious reasons? Avoiding certain foods because of allergy or intolerance? Or, for example, I don't eat meat and poultry, significantly limit the intake other animal products, and try to avoid whenever possible food in plastic package and food brought from overseas to reduce my environmental impact. Where is my starvation mode? Why I didn't start bingeing on said foods and didn't gain 100 lbs yet?"
fatlogic,fcw0vhr,t1_fcv0nb2,1578014561.0,"I agree with you on that, but they are talking about what OP calls ""running"", not about what running actually is."
fatlogic,fbzu5do,t1_fbwnj70,1577261687.0,"So what's the problem with ""throw out""? I started learning English in my 20s and don't see how this question it is biased and why it is difficult. ""Throw out"" = ""remove"", no? Or is there something I don't understand?
But in general, of course I agree that non-native English speakers are in disadvantage when it comes to career and academic success."
