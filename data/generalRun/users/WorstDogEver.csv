ffacj,fgj2wwu,t1_fgipkta,1580835963.0,"srs I find that type of underwear way more comfortable. All underwear rides up like that for me, so if it's designed to do so, then there's less fabric and it lays better."
TrollYChromosome,fgivfal,t3_eyl2nu,1580831761.0,"I was never into self-help, but I had to start reading some books for work, and it definitely rubbed off on me. Went from having difficulty looking at myself in the mirror to being very self-confident."
femalefashionadvice,fgh7snx,t1_fggsv8a,1580778697.0,"I wear the Aerie Chill leggings (with pockets) in winter. But I'm also in California, so they might not be warm enough for you, depending on location."
AreTheStraightsOK,fggd1yk,t1_fgftfqw,1580759309.0,"Oh man, I love Korean skincare products because I feel like I can get more for cheaper! I hope you can find some affordable stuff you like."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fgfxgvm,t1_fgfvx2y,1580749734.0,"I like the Garden of Life women's one, which looks like it's a little cheaper at Target. ($25, plus $10 gc if you buy two.)"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fgfurbs,t1_fgfpnga,1580748051.0,"I've always found a cotton gusset to be enough, but if you want to experiment with how your vag health does with some all-cotton underwear, go for it. It's cheap, so why not? (Also, after antibiotics for a BV gave me a yeast infection, my gyno told me to always take probiotics with antibiotics.)"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fgfhzvh,t1_fgf6nbi,1580739274.0,Some people just don't have much discharge.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fgfgg80,t1_fgfcwh7,1580738026.0,I don't think it's possible to have all-cotton seamless underwear because of the nature of the fabric. But they usually have a cotton gusset.
ffacj,fg7dhau,t1_fg6vswc,1580589861.0,"Lol, our COO is a middle-aged woman, and she'll wear fancy tank tops, shorts, and platform sandals in the summer."
ffacj,fg6rxem,t1_fg6k98l,1580575489.0,"srs That would be totally fine to wear at my office. People would think you were being fancy, and no one would give the cutout or thigh slit another thought. I knew we were casual, but didn't realize it was unusually so until reading the other thread."
mildlyinteresting,fg4n5tv,t1_fg4l9m2,1580506779.0,I didn't know there was a Netflix series! I'll have to watch.
beyondthebump,fg3vb8f,t1_fg3n163,1580490445.0,"It varies by daycare, but in another thread about daycare, several employees chimed in to say they weren't paid during holiday shutdowns even though parents still have to pay."
delusionalcraigslist,fg0p7iu,t1_fg0ounp,1580412323.0,That is a nice find! Looks so cozy.
ABoringDystopia,fg06hv7,t1_fg02r3w,1580401276.0,"Some farmers markets are regulated, some aren't. For example, [there's this group in California:](http://www.cafarmersmkts.com/about#about-cfma)

“Certified Farmers’ Markets” and “Certified Producers” are certified and regulated by State of California law. It is illegal for farmers to buy and re-sell agricultural products at a Certified Farmers’ Market. A Certified Farmers’ Market is a location, certified by the Agricultural Commissioner, where a producer sells only their own fruits and vegetables directly to consumers. A Certified Farmers’ Market may only be operated by a local government, a certified producer or a non-profit organization. Certified Producers enjoy the exemptions of certain State regulations that require strict packing, labeling, size and grading standards. These exemptions foster the freshness and product availability that enhances every Certified Farmers’ Market in California.

Each farmer or other agricultural producer must carry in transit and post at the Certified Farmers’ Market a copy of his/her Certified Producer’s Certificate, which is provided by the farmer’s production county agricultural commissioner."
