•Koalas often return to trees they consider their territory.

•Koalas can be ferocious when resisting capture. They growl, fight, and bite.

•When the temperature rises, koalas press their bodies close to tree trunks, which cools them off.

•Koala twins are very rare.

•Many of Australia’s koalas have an STD called chlamydiosis."

[Some more facts](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wired.com/2014/12/creature-feature-10-fun-facts-wombats/amp)

>Wombats have slow metabolisms. It takes a wombat up to 14 days to digest a meal. This slow metabolism helps them out in their hot and dry habitat.
They have teeth like rodents. Wombat incisors, like those of rodents, are continuously growing. To keep them in check, wombats gnaw on bark and tough vegetation.
They're not as helpless as they look. Wombats defend home territories around their burrows and can become aggressive to intruders. There are reports of human injuries from wombat attacks, including puncture wounds from their claws, deep bites, and injuries from being bowled over by charging wombats."
