IncelTears,fgfu4yw,t1_fgfocs4,1580747662.0,"I'm a straight guy, but I do find certain men attractive in their own way. I definitely don't find him attractive. I never found the whole muscle thing to be attractive on men. You can take it to a certain point, but after that it just starts to look weird. Same deal with women. But then again, a lot of my friends tell me my taste in women is a little different than most. I tend to prefer women who look unique over women who look conventionally attractive."

I got my first girlfriend when I decided to just start talking to a girl I thought was way out of my league, and had no chance of ever having a relationship with. Instead of being awkward and trying too hard, I just had regular conversations with her. Six months later, she was dating me. We all go through a phase of being insecure, but neckbeards just tend to refuse to leave that headspace."
IncelTears,fftcbz2,t1_fft32qn,1580216235.0,"One of the things women always tell me is that they find them most men can't bring them to orgasm regularly, but I have very little trouble, and I always explain it's because I fucking ask them what they like. I think most guys are too insecure or proud to ask a woman what she likes. I have to say though, it makes you feel a hell of a lot better to make a woman lose her fucking mind having orgasms then not, so ask your fucking partner what they want! And that goes for everybody, and every sexual orientation!"

Incels don't understand that women are on the receiving end of sex, and have to bear the burden of all of the negative stigma, and the possibility of pregnancy. That's the way it works in nature, one male can impregnate every woman on Earth in 9 months, but a woman can only give birth to one child in the same amount of time."
IncelTears,ffktlz0,t3_etw0dm,1580028640.0,"The LGBT community is usually a good place to start. They tend to be extremely friendly to people like you, or like me, who are on the Autistic or schizophrenic spectrum. It's best just to make friends and not worry too much about a girlfriend. Things will happen. There are plenty of autistic girls who have never touched a guy, trust me.

It's important not to go around thinking you're alone and thinking that you need a girlfriend. This is a major problem, because now you're putting your self-esteem, and your happiness in the hands of a condition being met. Just wanting to have a girlfriend is it terrible goal, because it overshadows the idea of actual romance, wanting to be with somebody because of who they are, not just because they are someone who will date you. I have made this mistake way too many times.

As time goes by, eventually, you will meet somebody who you actually have feelings for and want to be with, and then eventually, you will meet somebody like that who shares your feelings. And then everything happens so fast, and sometimes it falls apart, but you realize how much of a crazy and random thing it is to fall in love.

I still remember the first night when I finally realized I was in love with one of my friends and she realized she was in love with me. It was just so crazy. After years of knowing each other, and it just happened so fast, and man it was just so much of a whirlwind of emotion.

That ended up being my first, and to date, my last relationship. That ended almost eight years ago. Still haven't been in love since. I promised myself I would never date anybody just to date somebody. In those years, I've been very happy, and I don't feel alone. I'm getting to the point now where I'm probably about ready to meet somebody else, but I can't rush things. When the time is right, it will happen."
IncelTears,ffkqpsb,t3_ets8uj,1580027220.0,"I've tried talking to them on probably 20 or 30 different occasions, and it's always the same outcome. They refuse to listen, they refuse to accept that I used to be an incel, and I realized that I was the one that was wrong. They refuse to believe that just because I've had multiple sex partners I'm not some gorgeous Chad. All they do is make excuses as to why I got better and they didn't. It's not worth it."
