Showerthoughts,ffadr9p,t1_ffa6jl0,1579733179.0,Seriously.  I watch the early 90s X-Men on Disney+ for fun and background and damn is the animation pretty rough. The stories hold up and you can turn a blind eye to it because of this. But yeah...I am enjoying the new(ish) art styles and animation that is hitting the cartoon scene lately over the 80/90 style.
UpliftingNews,ff7mzjl,t1_ff6svcc,1579653423.0,"There was a lot of behind the scenes before this too though.  I believe three ish people were arrested a few days before the protest due to their neo-nazi connections that were planning to come to start shit. And gun safety groups cancelled there MLK day vigil that was going to happen after this protest. 

Honestly between those two things are what made it stay peaceful.  The neo-nazis in disguise weren't able to start a fight unless it was with the crowd that they are trying to win over and the law enforcers made sure anyone who was planning on starting shit before hand were caught ahead of time."
TrueOffMyChest,fes56th,t1_fes2ji5,1579361496.0,"Yeah honestly that's what this came off as.  It was an easy way of trying to see if he was interested in her.

It's not that uncommon for both parties to do these ""Who would you kiss if you could?"" Type Questions to each other."
HumansBeingBros,fenu782,t1_fenmepk,1579290792.0,"If I could not provide safety or support to someone human I cared for I would be more then willing to let them move to somewhere safe. People literally give up their babies all the time because they can not supply them with what they need to grow.  Just because someone rehomes a pet doesn't mean they don't care. It means they care enough to know they can't supply the support the being needs to live.

You are allowed your opinion sure, but don't try to start pushing people down because you don't know their situation.

Edit: hell there are people who re-home their pets and still see them weekly thanks to the new owners allowing them to come hang out with them.  Just like how adoption can work too."
HumansBeingBros,feni7k7,t1_fenh4f3,1579285237.0,"I know a few people are assuming the owners are bad people but if I had someone trying to harm my dog by kicking down my fence and trying to lure him away I honestly would try to look into re-homing him if I couldn't get away from the person.  

We don't know if this is a stalker or a neighbor.  People are fuckin nuts and I could see someone easily fucking with the dog if they got pissed at the owners.  I mean people steal homeless people's pets to ""save them"" and then sell them to whomever.

Sadly not everyone is made with enough money to just get up and move so rehoming would be the best winning situation for the dog."

Even if you forget about it for a few days/weeks at least it will be there so you can go ""Oh yeah!"" Later on."
TrueOffMyChest,fdr14ni,t1_fdq8407,1578678041.0,"Not to mention that parents not swearing is pretty common.  Hearing Mother humper, freakin butthole, fudge, or something of the sort is probably pretty freaking common.

Honestly for all we know OP is the owner of both accounts and this whole thing was to make even more Krama. Easy enough to do and Reddit sure loves drama."
YouShouldKnow,fdky5o6,t1_fdjt9oq,1578513573.0,"While this is true, we also don't want people to freak out because fluffy took a nibble.  No need to Fear monger and cost people money on a vet appointment they may not even need."
YouShouldKnow,fdj4iz5,t1_fdj3dm5,1578458239.0,"This is a myth.  Your pet is fine if they take a nibble.  You don't want them to eat like 5 of them.

""Poinsettias are not poisonous if consumed by pets either, says Steven Hansen, director of the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center and a veterinary toxicologist. But they can irritate a cat or dog if eaten in large quantities. So if Fido or Fluffy does chow down on the showy red shrub and shows signs of lethargy, drools, vomits or has diarrhea, don’t feed them for 24 hours, and give them water until the effects subside. If their side effects don’t stop, go to the veterinarian.

Hansen does caution that all types of lilies—especially the Easter and tiger lilies popular during the holidays—are extremely poisonous to cats, but not dogs. The number of reported feline deaths is low, but consuming the lily can cause kidney failure if the cat is not taken to a hospital immediately"""
MensLib,fdie6fz,t1_fdh6ivt,1578440877.0,"Honestly this is what I've been thinking. There is no use in a draft. Most people are over the weight, most people have some sort of mental illness that would get them let go.

AskMen,fdakq0r,t1_fd8gtso,1578247142.0,My partner does the same.  I really like their name but I know they have no real connection to it but I really like their last name but know how much easier it would be to pick on someone with it.

SubredditDrama,fdadbfp,t1_fdaafa5,1578244786.0,"Yeah... let me be reall the mods don't seem like the best people either.

worldnews,fdacl70,t1_fdaai4m,1578244621.0,"Cold war was wrapped with the ""red scare"" and generally framed as a ""We were scared of nukes!"" Sort of way.  Problem with Vietnam War (or well probably their excuse) is that, when I was in school (before 08), it was always at the end of the year. We had to rush through the 60s through the 90s within a month and a half. 

Also Watergate was a huge talking point for this time frame and took most of the time.

Don't even get me on how much we talk about the Gulf War. For the longest time I didn't even know what the whole thing was about and my father was part of it.

Seriously if he said nothing, no one would really think about it. If someone ask if this was your house, honestly answer ""uh no?"" And leave it at that, even if it is. Chances are people won't risk getting someone else involved, especially if they didn't personally doxx you.  Sure you can get yourself prepared in case someone does. Call the police let them know that you might be at risk of an attack but don't make it *public* don't let these people know that they are on the right path.  Especially because most of the time it's not a person showing up, it's them trying to swat you."
TrueOffMyChest,fd42qdq,t1_fd3dbl8,1578163819.0,"Yeah Facebook is huge and while I am a bit wary of them for older kids or Teens with younger siblings (for runaway abuse reasons) I still try to keep an eye out.

TwoXChromosomes,fcrd8t6,t1_fcqztgm,1577900268.0,"Yeah this is what bothered me.  I play music or have a TV on when we sleep due to my partner's tinnitus.  For me this would be more then enough to mute all sounds from waking me up because my brain has already notes that it's noisy. (However in our apartment I never hear any hallway noise, even tho in the living room I can hear pretty much everything.)  

The OP did an amazing thing, and she should be proud of herself but she shouldn't get upset with her own neighbors when she just doesn't know what was going on in their own home.  Hell, for all she knows another neighbor did hear, wanted to help, but choked out because it started to cause them panic attacks of their own past trauma. So today, they are now dealing with the baggage of it all."
AskReddit,fcpodf3,t1_fcpnewu,1577868649.0,"Think of it this way though, you could go deeper into those more out there games that you might have avoided due to time restrictions.

Or become a YouTube gaming channel and ""predict"" how some triple A games are going to go."
AskReddit,fcpnn9e,t3_eic8yl,1577868205.0,"Yes and no.

I would want to cause I wasted a lot of time healing and lost so much due to it. I would also be less undecided in what actions I wanted to take.

However it would be 2 years before I met my best friend and the love of my life. I guess in a way I could run into them again online, but I'm not sure if I would want to actually risk that. I'm happy where I am now. While not the best spot to be in while heading into my 30s I generally feel happy again. Like, my depression is finally clearing up, life feels like it can get better.  I'm not scared of having to be trap or abused again.  I'm gaining my confidence back.  I feel like I can finally move on with my life.

And sure I guess I would have this all when I went back but things could change. And it could make everything worse. I just don't know if I'm willing to risk that. Risk possibly losing the person who seems to understand me the most."

A good chuck of charter schools here are own by her family or friends. Our state government allowed her family to set this all up with little laws to prevent for profit.  And because of that more for profit scam artist have started to move in, especially in the metro area."
Michigan,fci5ne7,t1_fchtxxc,1577658054.0,"Yeah I remember reading about her long before Trump and hating her guts.  Charter schools *can* be good. They can do good things for the students and community.  There are plenty of states that are/were doing great things with charter schools but they put laws into place to avoid for profit. We don't have the best laws, thanks to the DeVos family.  

Notice: It's been a while since I looked up Charter school system. (Since 2014ish) it does appear that even the ""good"" charter schools have started to go down hill as the rise of for profit ones come in, take the Federal money and then never open their doors or open them for only a quick second."

TrueOffMyChest,fcbxhyc,t1_fcamwth,1577592067.0,"We can vocalize the importance 1000x to the common (American) Joe.  But the problem here is it ends up being the same with even physical health.  ""Pay $50+ a month for food or to see if I'm actually fucked up?"" 

We need to start being vocal towards health insurances.  If they can afford one ""yearly check up"" for physical health that can include things like pap smears and anal probing then they can also afford a couple of yearly mental checks.  It would benefit them since us not cutting our lives short means they can take more from us."

My car took little damage (just paint chipping) and I was over all fine.  However anytime I have to go on that road I get filled with anxiety and fear. I actively avoid taking the road if I can or going on it Durning times when it shouldn't be busy.  

I don't think mine is PTSD though, as I always had a horrid phobia of driving to begin that can cause me to have super bad anxiety at times. But I just wanted to help you feel better.

Edited so English was better"
TrueOffMyChest,fc3zr1d,t1_fc3yadj,1577402846.0,"I honestly feel like it's slowly making a turn. Just...slowly.  (like it's been turning since the 70s kind of slow.) But with the rise of stay at home dads, both working parents, and divorcing being less stigmatize, I feel like it might be turning a bit faster now. 

Also others have said, their partner was all for a ""team"" set up only for it to change the moment they got married and started to have kids. Sadly, people view marriage as a ""end."" Once you married all the other things you said don't matter and you don't have to keep trying. (Or try to fix things.) It's honestly a fear I have. But that's also because I had a ""good guy ended up not being a good guy"" story. Luckily my gut/anxiety made it so I never went through the whole marriage process so I was able to easily get out."

Be that dude who could always point you to some weird but entertaining game. You can still partake in the conversation for the bigger games you played.

Or become a YouTube gaming channel and ""predict"" how some triple A games are going to go."
AskReddit,fcpnn9e,t3_eic8yl,1577868205.0,"Yes and no.

I would want to cause I wasted a lot of time healing and lost so much due to it. I would also be less undecided in what actions I wanted to take.

However it would be 2 years before I met my best friend and the love of my life. I guess in a way I could run into them again online, but I'm not sure if I would want to actually risk that. I'm happy where I am now. While not the best spot to be in while heading into my 30s I generally feel happy again. Like, my depression is finally clearing up, life feels like it can get better.  I'm not scared of having to be trap or abused again.  I'm gaining my confidence back.  I feel like I can finally move on with my life.

And sure I guess I would have this all when I went back but things could change. And it could make everything worse. I just don't know if I'm willing to risk that. Risk possibly losing the person who seems to understand me the most."

politics,fciahmf,t1_fchvkkn,1577659754.0,"It might be better to do our state first as DeVos set this up long before she became SoE. A good chuck of charter schools here are own by her family or friends. Our state government allowed her family to set this all up with little laws to prevent for profit.  And because of that more for profit scam artist have started to move in, especially in the metro area."
Michigan,fci5ne7,t1_fchtxxc,1577658054.0,"Yeah I remember reading about her long before Trump and hating her guts.  Charter schools *can* be good. They can do good things for the students and community.  There are plenty of states that are/were doing great things with charter schools but they put laws into place to avoid for profit. We don't have the best laws, thanks to the DeVos family.  

Notice: It's been a while since I looked up Charter school system. (Since 2014ish) it does appear that even the ""good"" charter schools have started to go down hill as the rise of for profit ones come in, take the Federal money and then never open their doors or open them for only a quick second."

Airplanes don't go ""Children and Women first!"" still  (Hell they tell you to take care of yourself first then help others.) I'm pretty sure boats now do the ""Quickly and calmly"" method as well."
TrueOffMyChest,fcbxhyc,t1_fcamwth,1577592067.0,"We can vocalize the importance 1000x to the common (American) Joe.  But the problem here is it ends up being the same with even physical health.  ""Pay $50+ a month for food or to see if I'm actually fucked up?"" 

We need to start being vocal towards health insurances.  If they can afford one ""yearly check up"" for physical health that can include things like pap smears and anal probing then they can also afford a couple of yearly mental checks.  It would benefit them since us not cutting our lives short means they can take more from us."
TrueOffMyChest,fcbu4up,t1_fcal74b,1577591003.0,"If it's any help, over a year ago I was the third car in a rear end accident.  My car took little damage (just paint chipping) and I was over all fine.  However anytime I have to go on that road I get filled with anxiety and fear. I actively avoid taking the road if I can or going on it Durning times when it shouldn't be busy.  

I don't think mine is PTSD though, as I always had a horrid phobia of driving to begin that can cause me to have super bad anxiety at times. But I just wanted to help you feel better.

Edited so English was better"
TrueOffMyChest,fc3zr1d,t1_fc3yadj,1577402846.0,"I honestly feel like it's slowly making a turn. Just...slowly.  (like it's been turning since the 70s kind of slow.) But with the rise of stay at home dads, both working parents, and divorcing being less stigmatize, I feel like it might be turning a bit faster now. 

Also others have said, their partner was all for a ""team"" set up only for it to change the moment they got married and started to have kids. Sadly, people view marriage as a ""end."" Once you married all the other things you said don't matter and you don't have to keep trying. (Or try to fix things.) It's honestly a fear I have. But that's also because I had a ""good guy ended up not being a good guy"" story. Luckily my gut/anxiety made it so I never went through the whole marriage process so I was able to easily get out."
TrueOffMyChest,fc3y2ak,t3_eg02o3,1577401584.0,"I don't like the idea of blaming women for marrying these men though...At least not fully.  Let's be real, at least in America, we kind of show both sexes that men are suppose to be like this useless loafs that deep down is loveable and that women are suppose to put up with it cause that's a woman's job to take care of everything outside of making money!

 Mix this with the ""American dream"" and the ideal (white) ""American family"" they like to feed us as kids it makes sense why young mom's end up realizing that everyone has been lying to them since day one.  And generally they didn't have the resources to get out. (Nor the support from their social circle) so they now have to put up with it. 

Sadly I feel like a lot of American women view this also as the norm.  It's normal for men to be like this.  They are just venting like people vent about things they are flustered with but accepted.  Honestly they probably assume their husbands are doing the same about them
