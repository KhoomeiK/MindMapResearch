rpg_gamers,ffaqxe5,t3_eqsyyr,1579742403.0,"Chances are you're both bad and missing a load of content that gives XP. This isn't an unusual thing, crpgs are hard especially initially when you're used to playing other games that hand hold and don't give you options. Crpgs focus on exploration and interaction, they don't reward making direct bee lines for the main objective, in fact you'll be heavily punished for it later on. You don't know how to maximize combat efficiently yet so you need XP and gear.

Poke around the fort, talk to everyone, there are secrets and hidden things *everywhere*. Focus on one damage type if you can, or double up as enemies either have strong armor or magic shields but rarely both and splitting your damage means enemies have 50% more health. 

Use the environment to your benefit when you can, use the teleport gloves you get early to screw over enemies by moving them into fire or to group them up for some aoe, or even just make them have to walk over to you all over again. Drop heavy things on people, it does damage.

They targeted celts and anglo-saxons and any kind of christians. They did not raid their own countries. In fact in terms of racial targeting it was more specific than the African slave trade, they knew specifically what cultural, ethnic and religious groups they were going after.

Shit happens often enough for people, life would become a tiresome hassle if every time it happened it became a big thing. That is one angle to consider.

Another is location, some times people just don't want to see a showdown in a location where that isn't helpful. Right or wrong, that isn't going to change, just because one person is slinging shit doesn't mean you're responsibility free for getting down into the mud with them.

And personally, I know how these things turn out. You don't win by being angrier and louder than the idiot you're berating. It might seem satisfying but actually to many people it looks like you've lost control and are defensive or attacking someone. Its just a product of human interaction that the first one to lose their temper seems like the loser of any disagreement, no matter what their point is.

For many LGBT people they also don't relish the idea of getting into heated arguments and name calling with bigots either. You might be fine with it, but for others their safety isn't so secure, if some hick decides to follow them home or get his gun over a name calling session, well harsh words isn't going to do much good then is it?

You might not agree with his stance on healthcare, but every single person in politics takes money from someone and has lobbyists. That means Sanders too. There will never be a poor president that never takes money from donors and never listens to lobbyists in some form.

I'd rather see Buttigieg president over Warren or Biden, but then again I also don't live in fantasy land where I am concerned over Buttigieg winning either, he has zero chance at the nomination, so attacking him while the wealthy boomers take the nomination... well its typical of left-leaning political discourse these days, devoid of any actual useful discussion or relevant political discourse. Buttigieg isn't important, but he also isn't the literal uncle tom devil corporate puppet. I think if by some miracle he was president, it would Obama-lite for 4-8 years at worst.

Really? Generic? There is nothing generic about that imagery, and I'd ask that you prove that statement with some comparisons. We have no idea what is going on with those two, but its not generic.

> red hair girl : when I saw her I thought "" please god , not another prosthetic arm like sekiro ... ""

You act like Sekiro started some trend of prosthetic arm based characters. Its one character from one game. Every other person here spent their first time looking at her hair and helmet.

Its also clear arms are a theme in this game or play some role, similar to how eyes played a role in darksouls. 

> red hair giant: this is really one of the ugliest character I have ever seen in a videogame, so far from the usual Fromsoftware quality. I really hope it wont be in the final game

We didn't get a good enough look at the character to really judge that. And its in the trailer, it will be in the final game, what a stupid thing to even hope.

AskReddit,fdgd3s5,t3_ekyrlt,1578390991.0,"Pretty sure the concept of a draft in the modern era serves no purpose. More people does not mean you're any better prepared for a war where drones, nukes and cruise missiles exist and where highly trained specialized units are prized over some illiterate teenager with a rifle told to point and shoot.

But putting aside the fact that nothing will ever justify a draft, even if you did manage to draft people there would be very little you could do to get people on your side. Your average millennial or gen z, the only people who are eligible typically hate their government, hate the wars, have zero sense of blind patriotism or live under the delusion that going to a foreign place to kill people is ""defending"" anything. At best they'd just refuse, at worst they'd actively harm any of your efforts. 

This is also ignoring the fact that the draft would be challenged and basically destroyed in the court system and rogue judges and states would outright refuse to enforce anything, it would be political pandemonium. By its very nature its unconstitutional and sexist, its impossible to argue otherwise legally.

And finally Iran might be a meat grinder if there was a war but nothing about it would rise to the level of justifying a need for loads of unwilling grunts who consider their commanding officers war criminals and a greater danger to their lives than any Iranian.

The draft is dead, morally, politically, legally and practically. Even in other nations where its used the draft is way for the government get free labor out of usually young men, leaving women to advance in their careers while men fuck about doing community service or planting trees and pretending what they're doing would matter even one bit in a real war."
