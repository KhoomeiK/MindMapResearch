AskWomen,felvyop,t1_fel1dhq,1579232300.0,"Hey I also have bipolar! It was extremely difficult for me to tell my current SO, and I can’t imagine having to tell someone else that if we were to ever break up. Fortunately for me, when I told my SO about it, he was like “yes, and? That doesn’t have any effect on how I see you”"
WiggleButts,felukij,t1_felui49,1579231303.0,Weird. I’m not from a big city like New York though! I’m assuming concrete is just easier to maintain?
WiggleButts,feld3ij,t3_epl40l,1579219350.0,I find it odd that the dog park (I’m assuming this is a dog park) is all concrete. Good pups though
WeightLossAdvice,feffvjd,t1_fefftkn,1579055457.0,"That’s why you need to consult a professional, and not random internet strangers dude"
WeightLossAdvice,feffpch,t1_feffge7,1579055357.0,"The best diet to lose fat is a balanced diet. This is a balance of the macro nutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins). It will give you the best results in the long run. I’m not a doctor though, so if you’re really serious about it consult a nutritionist for a diet that is tailored to your needs. But I know with 100% certainty that eating a carb only diet (fruit) will not give you the results you’re looking for."
WeightLossAdvice,feffe1o,t1_feffa07,1579055164.0,"Fat is much harder to lose than muscle mass, and fat can be maintained pretty easily which muscle mass takes more work."
WeightLossAdvice,feff6u7,t1_feff3p0,1579055039.0,"Because, in order to build and keep muscle you need to eat proteins and fats, which fruit has very little of. Without enough nourishment, muscle goes away."
WeightLossAdvice,feff1fs,t1_fefeykz,1579054947.0,"Unlikely. You’d probably lose muscle first and foremost and maybe some fat, but you’d be malnourished."
WeightLossAdvice,fefetob,t3_eovpxj,1579054813.0,"You’d be missing out on a lot of key nutrients, fats and proteins especially. Fruits, while somewhat low in calories, are high in sugar and carbohydrates. Sure you’ lose weight if you still had a calorie deficit but you’d be lacking in nutrients. In order to live a truly healthy lifestyle you need to eat a balance of foods."
dogs,fe46u11,t1_fe31jje,1578856314.0,"That’s probably why he hates it then, being in a kennel his whole life. He most likely does not have a good association with being in the kennel as it sounds like he used to spend most of his time in there."
WeightLossAdvice,fe45g7o,t3_enrmsy,1578855986.0,"I’m no doctor, but they say a healthy weight loss rate is 2 pounds per week. 12 weeks (3 months) at this rate would be 24 pounds, so I would think your goal of 25 is fairly reasonable!"
dogs,fe3rx80,t1_fe2sdjs,1578852269.0,"I think you’re misunderstanding. Sam (small visiting dog) is the one who’s doing this to OP’s golden retriever, Tin. It might be harder to teach a visiting dog to stop this behavior if he’s only there for a small amount of time."
TexasTech,fe334nq,t1_fdz34ym,1578845472.0,"Also, if you go to your eraider account online you can look at your “concise student schedule” under the current term tab in the “my tech” section of the site and it should tell you what buildings and rooms all your classes are in."
bipolar,fdzbxzy,t1_fdz1dxe,1578788593.0,I can’t stand it when people compare me to others they’ve met with bipolar or movie and TV depictions of it. Bipolar manifests in different people differently and just because Karen from Florida gets angry and violent when she’s manic or hypomanic doesn’t mean that I do too.

dogs,fc7j3c1,t1_fc7hwn1,1577509021.0,"I’ve worked at two different Petsmart locations, one doing retail and pet-care and one in the PetsHotel. I loved working the retail side. The location I was at was super about the animals. My managers cared about our little friends and gave us the full right to refuse animals to anyone for any reason. If we got a bad vibe from someone, we could refuse them a pet. 

When I worked at the hotel, that was a different story. It was in a different state with completely different people, but my coworkers didn’t care about most of the dogs. They had their favorites that they would treat well but the rest were unimportant. Any little annoyance would result in them slamming doors behind the dogs, shoving them, and just being generally cruel. I would NEVER leave my dog with a PetsHotel.

My point is the treatment of animals by PetSmart totally depends on the employees who work at each store. Some are good, some are awful. It’s a risk."
Endo,fc6yue7,t3_egch6g,1577493036.0,"I have been on orilissa for about 3 months now, and it’s worked wonders for me! I have very little to no cramping pain anymore with my cycle, and very light bleeding. It took me about 4 weeks to get past the menopause type symptoms. I had hot and cold flashes and nausea, but after that I’ve had no ill side effects. Everyone is different, and it might be worth a try for you. Orilissa has been extremely helpful for me."
offmychest,fbms1ww,t1_fbk1byl,1576988193.0,"Lol, I’m having the opposite problem. I looked at it to see the G and the p but no matter how hard I try, I can’t. It just reads Disney to me"
