NoStupidQuestions,ff2rl4l,t3_erby4i,1579520996.0,"Yeah for me ICU really wasn’t bad. When I was on life support & had a machine breathing for me, I was in a medically-induced coma while they took care of me. When I woke up, I certainly didn’t feel great, but I was still being taken excellent care of & the nurses did everything in their power to keep me comfortable. Of course, this is just my experience and I don’t know anyone else’s story. But I can absolutely say it wasn’t anything like torture. The hardest part was laying down for such a long period of time- eventually my body just *hurt* from that, it was hard to get comfortable in those beds!"

That way no need for a LTA , mom gets paid, everyone is supportive. All good."
