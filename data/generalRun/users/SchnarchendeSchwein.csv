Making new friends, however, I’m lost. Most women won’t get close because they think since I’m gay I’ll hit on them, and there’s just not as much time to hang out as adults. And it’s hard for me to tell when to call someone a friend, because when I was young people used to pretend to be my friend, then make fun of me. Means people stay acquaintances for a long time, and I don’t trust it when someone wants to be closer."

Last fall, I went to German language immersion for adults for a week. A six hour ride to the north woods, knowing no one there, living on site, and constantly using a language with no singular “they” (well, German does have a neutral version of “the”, but it is usually used to refer to technology or machines- I don’t have a USB port!)...that was tough.

When I was 19 I got drug resistant walking pneumonia. Being an overachiever I kept going to classes and all my college stuff...



Finally got the right antibiotic but not before permanent lung damage and resulting chronic asthma.




Then, when I was 23 and in grad school I married my first love. Parents totally cut me off- not that I needed their money, but I was hoping for a smooth transition from their insurance to another plan of my own, or for me to pay them back the premiums.




So I was without insurance for about a year. The maintenance inhaler I needed was $200/month without- and I didn’t suddenly *have* $200. Went without and didn’t go to urgent care/the hospital for a few asthma attacks.  Lung damage got way, way worse. I even asked my parents for help with the $200- no, we don’t agree with your decisions!  *They could afford it*, and if needed I could ration the medicine.

Particularly Dr. Huisman. She is more liberal than I am, and being nonbinary and queer I am pretty fucking far left. I came to college the year she started teaching. She was unsure of herself and obese, but always very kind and willing to go the extra mile for students.



Then around 2009-2011 she went on Weight Watchers (it was stricter then), and lost enough weight to become a normal BMI. Even pretty athletic! I used to see her at said top notch gym once I got my head out of my ass and worked out six days a week without anyone making me do so.




Now she’s regained a good amount of weight and occasionally talks about “fat-shaming” on her FB. Her poor rescue mutt is a bit too fat! But she remains at a net loss, still.

The outdoors there are also *amazing*. Year round sports- sailing, swimming, rowing, hunting, hiking, cross country, hockey, dog sledding, and cross country skiing. And the town is small enough that if you live in it properly, it’s cheaper and easier to walk around.



People either fish and hunt and grow for themselves, or buy from local shops. Like, go to the fish place, the bakery, the orchard, the butcher, and the farmer‘s market instead of having a lot of junk under one roof.
