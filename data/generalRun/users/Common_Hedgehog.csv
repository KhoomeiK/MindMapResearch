asexuality,fgyt7kj,t1_fgyrnm0,1581186761.0,Hmmm good points. I should probably stop talking to him then. Everyone in the dnd group all lives in the same household (including dm) besides me and one other player. I do sit next to this person but I’ll see if I can move.

asexuality,fgyq69b,t1_fgyo6wr,1581185802.0,"I try to talk about being aro/ace around him a lot so he will get the hint. In addition, whenever he buys me stuff I will send him money on Venmo but he will send it back so that doesn’t work haha. Additionally, taking time apart is difficult because we see each other once a week for dnd and it’s a smaller group so not talking is difficult to avoid. He also watches my streams online for an rpg I play. You know, the more I talk about it the the more weird I feel about the whole situation. Blehhh"

 I am going through something similar with depression, alcoholism, and work issues. The depression started to manifest within December, and recently at work I made a mistake and am currently suspended while an investigation takes place. I was pretty upset about the situation at work but I am learning to trust in the universe. Whatever the result from the investigation may be, I will be learning from it (spiritually and materialistically). I was recently placed on antidepressants which does not allow for the use of alcohol.  I am hoping to kill two birds with one stone. Medication is not the solution for everyone, however.

I hope the best for you and may we both gain wisdom and insight <3"
