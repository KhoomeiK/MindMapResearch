depression,feiy0pa,t3_epehhb,1579150373.0,i know from experience that drinking to forget sadness is dangerous. i also know how difficult it is to overcome. there’s no magic words that will fix the suffering you’re feeling. it’s something you have to do for yourself. and it’s not fun.
depression,feixl4e,t3_epebw5,1579150010.0,society’s standards are so humiliating. we weren’t designed to do the things required of us. we lack freedom for self. it’s painful. you should be free to enjoy yourself without being stuck living up to someone else’s idea of success. it’s so frustrating.
depression,feiq4gc,t1_feiowzo,1579144420.0,you’re right. i’ve tried many times. i’m just awkward. i get panic attacks easily. i don’t have anything in common with people. it’s not lack of effort merely apathy from so many failed attempts to be social.

ClimateOffensive,feieunn,t1_feieiqv,1579136877.0,i thought my original comment was a worse case scenario. after reading more it seems like it’s much worse than that. i try not to think about it. so i often downplay the severity of these issues.

Doomers,fehuuj6,t3_ep8n2s,1579124319.0,grim and hopeless... like my existence...
ClimateOffensive,feht6tb,t1_fehqwqc,1579123381.0,"as the surface heats up from the greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere the ice caps will melt releasing more and more greenhouse gases (co2, methane) creating feedback loops. making it impossible for the plant life to remove the gases as fast as they’re being created. the hotter temperatures will increase water consumption for farming leading to famine and water wars. eventually it will get to a point where farming will become mostly impossible. like a worldwide dust bowl. all the resources and diversity will bottle neck. mass extinction events happened in the past. never this fast tho. if we act now we might be able to reduce a %90 extinction rate to a %70 extinction rate. however humans will have a difficult time adapting regardless. basically the whole world looks like Australia in 2050-2060. 

i’m not an expert. i’ve just read some reports from Exxon and Goldman Sachs. they’re preparing for a 5°c rise in temperature. which is catastrophic. this occurs in 2068. basically the peak of extinction. after that it’s red skies and desert. 

(edit: this is worse case scenario)

i might be wrong. i hope i’m wrong."
ClimateOffensive,fehqesh,t1_fehp9is,1579121804.0,sure but do you mean how the earth’s surface is heating up from greenhouse gases and deforestation making life unsustainable or the groups of people allowing and supporting the exploitation of nature for capitalistic gains or out of sheer stupidity?

ClimateActionPlan,fefzapj,t1_fefyy34,1579070377.0,the air quality in my city is the opposite of healthy. it would be awesome if we had some  windmills but the coal industry has a ton of money from the exploitation of nature. they manipulate any system necessary to maintain power. and as long as capitalism protects them i’m pretty much powerless. plus having chronic depression sucks.
