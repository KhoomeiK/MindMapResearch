socialskills,fg57j8f,t3_ewt4ee,1580520232.0,"Set reminders immediately after conversations. So you call friend X on a random Tuesday, when you hang up you use Siri (or other, that’s my choice) and say “remind me to call X in N days”. Ex: “call Ross in 51 days”. Use days instead of weeks and double digit numbers and you’re always a random-ish interval away. Also reminder instead of calendar that way you can snooze it if inconvenient moment.

movies,fekjco1,t3_epmxxj,1579201255.0,"""Fantastic""? I don't mean to rain on the parade here, but they are mediocre movies, at best. Perhaps, and I'd go out on the limb here for it, they are much better when viewed together as you describe. But generally speaking, despite nostalgia, it's hard to say that ""meh"" movies are truly fantastic... 

By comparison - nobody needs to tell you CoBP is fantastic when ___ - it's just a great movie. Tight writing, good acting, good effects, etc. 

The others lean far too heavily on visual effects, kitsch, and an overly complex plot just to tell a story in the same universe... Sorta like... nah, don't need to say it. :)"
coolguides,fejyr8k,t1_fejx3d2,1579188898.0,"Yeah, I generally agree. My perspective is, roughly:

* let's stop doing the ridiculously wasteful stuff ASAP (like a single use plastics ban would be somewhat meaningful over time, ending corporations' ability to deduct costs of transporting materials, etc)

* let's stop fighting about IF there's problems ahead, and just all generally accept that there are, and move the debate to what do we DO about them

* let's also shift the convo from individual responsibility (though there is much to be done there) to corporate responsibility, which is where the true problems exist to making meaningful change - this is, IMHO, the key to it. you and I could leave our lights on 24/7 and it won't matter a blip - but getting hotel chains, skyscrapers, etc to have mandatory sensors/off-switches, would add up quickly.

Nice to have a civil discussion with you! :)"
coolguides,fejvxf5,t1_fejsaxa,1579187083.0,"Right, and that’s an understandable perspective, many people share it. Rather than try to convince you of anything, since the science is pretty clear on the trajectory and likely impact over the next century, I’ll ask a simple question:

What is the risk vs reward of you being wrong vs being right?"
