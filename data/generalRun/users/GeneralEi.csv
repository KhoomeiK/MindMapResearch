This is what happens when you vote based on electioneering and politician promises. History and consistency matter more."

aww,ffil01b,t1_ffik06t,1579976389.0,"I saw crows in Japan that knew to wait for traffic lights to turn red so cars would stop, so they could scavenge food/catch rodents off the street. It's kind of scary how cerebral these animals are, they probably have a fuck-ton of behaviours that we don't know of or understand the significance of yet.

Zoology is crazy man"
Drugs,ffiks6w,t3_ettfw0,1579976242.0,"If you mean purely chemicals, everyone is on something. Heroin, weed, sex, food, internet porn, stalking that girl from the coffee shop, posting fanfics online, desperately seeking parental validation, attending church every sunday, the list goes on and on and on.

Everyone has a vice because everyone is just looking to feel ok, or better than they do right now. Evolution made your brain this way because it forces you to seek out reward. Unfortunately, it's a system that is so liable to be abused because it's so sensitive. You can reach MDMA euphoria highs and chronic depression-chasm lows, all by never even touching a substance.

It's about learning to appreciate the different facets of life, man. You're already acquainted with one; drugs. They're amazing, they can feel fucking INCREDIBLE. But because they feel so good, they can stifle your want to discover more. What's better than discovering something new that you love that you never had any idea existed? Nothing, man. No drug is better than that feeling of your soul increasing in size, in depth.

I dunno when you'll be able to drag yourself out of that slippery walled, sticky-floored pit that is drug dependency, but I hope this comment helps motivate you just a bit. All it takes is one ok day after another, and you can be a new man in less time than you think. You've just gotta remind yourself that you want it, all the fucking time. Because once again, stupid ass brain will make you forget and want the old shit again. It's never worth it.

Good luck to you, OP. I'm rooting for you."
Drugs,ffik4q2,t3_ets8o9,1579975788.0,"Good fucking job man. Serious congrats, you just climbed out of a hole that many others never did, and never will. Savour the air at the top, you deserve it. Sounds like you already are.

If you ever feel drawn back, just look down. You won't wanna anymore. Good luck to you OP"
