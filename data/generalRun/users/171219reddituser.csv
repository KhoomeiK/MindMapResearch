depression,fd2a0mt,t3_eju46v,1578144046.0,I can relate. I think you should tell the 2nd girl how you feel.
depression,fd29w41,t1_fd0q7sm,1578143978.0,Well how very nice for you that you have a family. Some of us do not.

depression,fd29rtr,t3_ejt9jo,1578143918.0,"How very glib of you.

Also inaccurate in my case. My whole family is dead, so really nobody would care much if I died."
depression,fd29hpe,t3_ejrbe8,1578143788.0,"Yes. My parents and siblings all died in the last four years and my ex and I split because he didn't like my reaction to discovering he had cheated on me with six different women. I do have one friend I can trust but her life is hard enough as it is and I can't overburden her all the time.

My other friends I do not trust and again, they are busy.

I am incredibly lonely and completely suicidal. 

I've never been able to make life work, I'm in my mid thirties now and if I ended things nobody would suffer."
depression,fd28wbw,t1_fd27pe4,1578143525.0,"Thanks. Yes, I'm aware of the literature on medication and how it's almost totally useless and only moves depression 2 points at most on the ""48 point scale"". I also don't want the side effects either. Definitely not taking anything.

I'm feeling a bit uncertain about how to pick the best therapist I can within my price bracket. I just want someone who can talk to me and help me find a solution."
depression,fd28lha,t1_fd1uwif,1578143392.0,"I've thought this my whole life. My parents did care and they would notice no contact after a week but they are dead now.

I work from home so if I died I think maybe it would take a few weeks for a friend to both text and then think the lack of response was weird."
depression,fd282zm,t3_ejsoej,1578143172.0,"I know how you feel. Though in my case no pain would be passed as my family is dead and my ex left me.

I am really low today. All my loved ones are gone, I feel incredibly lonely. I'm not as strong as others. I'm terrified about the future and just don't have the maturity to deal with it in the way others can. I don't know how to do life without a support network and I'm just weak, a weak mess.

I was just thinking that if I had a guaranteed painless easy way of killing myself, I would be at real risk of doing it right now. The pain is too much to fight through. I think a lot of you can probably relate. It's really scary to have crossed over into a state where I am ready to kill myself and I think my loneliness is mostly the culprit.

At least we have the Internet, it's some comfort to communicate this way."
