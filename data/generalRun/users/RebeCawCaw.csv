tax,fd7s7n2,t1_fd7qmld,1578209281.0,"No benefits or income of any sort. I just want to make sure that my claiming him isnt going to be like a bad thing. I (like a lot of young adults) really don't understand taxes, I brought up claiming him with him and he said that would make his taxes worse, but he couldn't tell me how. So that's what I'm trying to figure out"
tax,fd7rl27,t1_fd7po93,1578208996.0,"I'm fairly sure I am eligible to claim him, I used the IRS questionnaire thingy and it said I was. 
I just want to make sure that I'm not impairing him by claiming him"

tax,fd7m6w1,t1_fd7k7g4,1578206617.0,"Okay, but what would claiming him do to his taxes? Since I'm the one who would pay  his taxes too I'm just trying to figure out what's the least expensive/most lucrative thing to do"

Dont be afraid to wash tho! It's the prolonged spraying with the shower head that simulates douching that poses the risks. If you want more information you can DM me and I can send you some links about it"
