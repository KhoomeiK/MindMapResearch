StrongCurves,fgitxtf,t1_fgi5g3i,1580830840.0,"So right now I’m eating 2200. 

In the past when I wanted to maintain my weight and I wasn’t working out at all, I use to eat 1500 . If I wanted to lose weight I’d eat 1200. 

I’m thinking start off around 1700 while working out so I can still get the necessary protein in. Trying to cut calories while working out is a bit tricky for me because I don’t think I’ve ever done both at the same time."
