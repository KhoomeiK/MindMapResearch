space,fdjgkhl,t3_elj5qx,1578469870.0,"Maybe the real names of The Sun and The Moon should be known officially as Sol and Luna, but that's just my opinion. In other languages throughout history, The Sun has been called many different things throughout history, and modern languages other than English have related but different ways of saying The Sun, so even this one version isn't universal.

I think some of the confusion is due to popular fiction, like Star Wars references the twin suns of Tatooine at least a few times, they don't give them names, but there are tons of other solar systems in the Star Wars universe. And I don't have any source, but I bet you on each planet in every English language sci-fi story they still call the nearest star the sun when they are on the surface of a planet.

So yeah, it's not as simple as, ""the name of THIS star is The Sun,"" and that is weird in another way, since most people don't have a friend named The Nathan, and no other planet is named like The Jupiter or something. Then again there is that guy some people call The Rock, although that's a nickname.

Is ""The Sun"" a nickname? Does it matter since nobody alive will ever travel to another star?"

It's misleading to say that 13 sextillion individual things were made, with that line of reasoning you could even count dots of ink printed on paper, molecules of alcohol, crumbs of cookies, or something along those lines, and then choose your size of thread/crumb etc to fit your argument and make whatever number you want."
