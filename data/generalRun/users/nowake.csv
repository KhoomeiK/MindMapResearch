More lines means the locomotives are closer. My end goal is to get as many routes as possible - 51 currently!

AdviceAnimals,fdl1o5m,t1_fdkqula,1578515501.0,"The problem with automatic lights is that it makes people forget that 'needing to turn the lights on' is a thing. They stop checking to make sure their lights are on when it gets dark, because they think ""hey, I've got automatic lights, *of course* they're on. 

Except when they're not on. Switches have the following settings:
* Full On
* Automatic
* Parking/DRL
* Off

And if someone else drives their car and happens to switch the lights from Auto to Off, they won't notice. The little visual cues in older cars that told us our lights aren't on, like having a completely dark dashboard and/or not seeing at least *some* light output from the front of your car, have gone away with LED running lights up front and always-lit gauge clusters. You won't notice your lights aren't on unless you look at the switch, or hunt the little icon on the gauge cluster... which a lot people don't do when they just jump in the car and start driving. 

Chevy did it right in my 2004 pickup truck - automatic lights that default to 'on' no matter where the switch is set, with the ability to kill them only after you've started the ignition and purposefully turned them off."
