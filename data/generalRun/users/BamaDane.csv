buildapc,fe3actv,t3_enojmw,1578847468.0,"I asked a similar question here:  
https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/emq7yz/i_just_bought_a_used_2080_ti_and_have_two_weeks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

And I also cross posted in r/buildapc 
Lots of good suggestions in there"
deeplearning,fdykt3t,t1_fdqlxxr,1578780843.0,"Thanks, I ran the fp32 and fp16 CNN tests as well as the LSTM test and so far everything is within the +-5% you suggested.

Incidentally, that was my first exposure to docker containers.  The instructions linked on that post were pretty straightforward, so thanks for that as well."
buildapc,fdx519r,t1_fdtg8lu,1578765430.0,"Thanks. I ran it on all of these except timespy and it did fine.  Leaderboard performance on unigine wasn’t too impressive, but the cpu is an i7-6700K and the mobo is from that era as well.  Seems good so far."
buildapc,fds534d,t1_fdry9ap,1578694541.0,"Thanks for the furmark warning.  It runs 3d mark fire strike without an issue, gets a score close to 22k.  I can’t find ‘siperpositon’"
buildapc,fdrvlki,t1_fdrubjx,1578690358.0,"Thanks for replying.  I'm trying to look for any defects.  

The card had been previously bought and then returned, but the store where I purchased it did not have a record of why it was returned.  It could be that someone bought it before Christmas hoping to sell it at a profit, and then returned it right at the end of the window (or some other reason that doesn't indicate a defective card), or it could be that someone bought it, discovered a flaw and then returned it.

I agree that playing fortnite isn't going to push a 2080 TI to its performance limits, but if the card is defective I hoped my son might sense something amiss.

I'll mostly be using it for ML, in case that affects your answer."
deeplearning,fdqhpol,t1_fdq8yn2,1578666950.0,Thanks.  My monitor maxes out at 1920x1200.  Can I still run this test (getting the card to process in 4K even though it will have to be downscaled)?
datascience,fdhjqpn,t1_fdgo3zg,1578424115.0,"I think CS/Math is better than Stats/CS for this, I agree with cephalopod1 here.  But details of the courses you will be taking are important. You will definitely want lots of CS courses and lots of ML courses, along with a very strong grounding in statistics."
datascience,fdglsgp,t3_elasly,1578401619.0,"Q1.  Is CS/Stats (not Stats/CS minor) an option?  If the CS focus is ML, that’s what I would recommend.  If CS/Stats isn’t an option then it’s a tougher choice, but Stats/CS minor is probably best.

Q2.  In finance your data scientist description sounds more like a quant role, but the lines between data scientist and quant are blurry and vary a lot between firms.

Q3.  For your Ph.D. you should consider something ML-focused, either in CS or Stats.

You can see that Econ doesn’t appear above.  Even though it seems like an Econ minor would help, in my experience it doesn’t help anyone get a foot in the door or get ahead (I’d enjoy seeing people pipe in who have different experience).  I personally find Econ very interesting (and am currently studying macro on my own), but that’s what I’ve seen.  I think most employers in finance (certainly quant finance) assume you can pick up the necessary Econ on the fly."

datascience,fcxclp2,t3_ejf9g1,1578059255.0,"I’d recommend something slightly different, a Masters in CS with a focus on ML.  It is certainly worth your while to take classes to expand your skills, but the Masters in CS carries more weight than a Masters in data science, at least in some industries."
