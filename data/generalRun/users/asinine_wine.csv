Horses,fdioavf,t1_fdg3e50,1578447360.0,I had to look this up! Medicine Hat horses were supposed to be spiritual and have one or two blur eyes. This one had two and I remember being really surprised because I had never seen a horse with blue eyes.

Baking,fdevag6,t1_fdel5d0,1578347337.0,Mexican cookies! They are lard based (or butter depending on the recipe) and have cinnamon and anise. We throw in a splash of pineapple juice for sweetness. They’re dry but are super crumbly.
Baking,fdev0zj,t1_fdenwsd,1578347181.0,"Maybe a little, since they are made with a press. Instead of butter they call for lard and have a few other ingredients."

I am not as active as I once was, but I’m a higher VIP and don’t want to lose that. Plus I am in one of the top unions and I feel that our group is pretty great. We have strict rules to avoid drama so it really helps. Honestly, drama is going to be on every server, but find the group that fits you most. Good luck!"
