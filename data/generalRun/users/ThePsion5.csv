That wouldn't prove anything, since the dominant force at that scale would be surface tension, not gravity. And the next dominant force would be the gravitational force of the earth itself, not the ball. See below

> Once you do that, then show the mechanics of the gravity, and why it does what it does.

The Law of Universal Gravitation (Gravity, for short) is stated as a formula:

    F = (G * m1 * m2) / r^2

Where m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r^2 is the distance between their centers of masses. Using that formula, we can see the force acting between the water and the tennis ball would be extremely small - definitely too small to be measurable without specialized equipment. So your proposed experiment would not measure or demonstrate gravity in any meaningful way.

Gravity does not answer ""why"" or ""how"", it's just a formula that expresses behavior observed in the real world."
