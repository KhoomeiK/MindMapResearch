This is an interesting theory, about the subliminal message to not dial 911.  I was suspicious of a story posted the other day about people getting evicted for calling the cops to complain about neighbors or report domestic violence.  Well, it turns out that many cities have ordinances that fine landlords if cops are called to their property a certain number of times within a year.

I guess the idea is that they don't want the landlords to be absent, and hold them accountable for not addressing public safety issues with their property.  But unfortunately this results in people getting evicted by their landlords because they called to report their SO beating them, or calling in a noise complaint on the neighbor.

I haven't been seeing it.  The only time my artifacts have gotten nuked it's been things like Mass Manipulation or Agent of Treachery.  I'm guessing will see a lot of [[Banishing Light]] in white decks due to it's utility, so maybe artifacts will become weaker.

MagicArena,feo7ls3,t1_fenphcg,1579296254.0,"> Rare drafting doesn't hurt your win rate too bad but it does hurt it.

To put it another way, if picking the non-rare over the rare means you get 4 wins instead of 3, you've lost a rare, but gained 150 gems and 4% chance at a 2nd pack.  This is approximately 79% of a rare, for a net loss of 1/5th of a rare.  If your plan is to complete a play set of all rares, then you almost never want to pass a rare (because that's one more pack you need to open at the end).

The gains of passing rares is less than what you lose in just about all cases.  The only exceptions would be if you have a really strong deck of a certain archetype after the second pack, and P3P1 is an off color rare and a bomb uncommon for your deck (e.g. 2nd or 3rd Innkeeper when you already have strong G Adventure deck)."
MagicArena,feo75gq,t1_fenjck9,1579296005.0,"> you should still draft good decks, but if there's a rare there prioritize it.

My personal strategy is to draft every single rare unless I already have 4 copies.  The opportunity cost of drafting a bad or off-color rare is usually very small.  Basically, it only affects you when draw the card you would have picked over the rare, and the amount of the effect is the delta between the card you passed in lieu of the rare and another card you end up putting in your deck.

For example, let's say you get passed a pack with [[Happily Ever After]], and you have the beginnings of a GW adventure deck.  Also in the pack is a [[Trail of Crumbs]], [[Flutterfox]], and [[Faerie Guidmother]].

Here you would probably pick Guidemother.  But in games where you draw the Guidemother, your chance of winning probably only goes up minimally (3-5%?).  You'll only draw it in 30-50% of the games, so impact on overall winrate is closer to 2-3%.  On top of this, Guidemother is common, so you have a fair chance of seeing it again in another pack.

Weigh this against the payoff of increased win-rate, and picking a good common or uncommon is not going to net you an extra rare card in rewards.  If picking Guidemother (or Inn Keeper) over Happily Ever After pushes you from 2 wins to 3, you pick up 100 gems and 2 percentage points of a pack (basically ~1/2 a rare)."

You don't have to be great at draft for it to be a good economical choice.  If you go 2-3 consistently, you come out slightly behind buying packs.

0.8 from WC progress (1.24 / 6)

So you get just about 6.17 if you use your gems to buy a pack; as you said, it's probably better to use the gems to draft instead.  So I think you still come out ahead drafting if you can average 2 wins.

50 drafts gets you 150 rares and 60 packs, which is 210 total rares.  I logged 30 ELD drafts and bought the Mastery Pass (which gave me extra packs), and I was very nearly complete after opening all my packs.

If the set lasts 12 weeks, this is 2.5 drafts per week, which is definitely doable as F2P if you don't waste your gold (since you get gems you can reinvest in drafts, as well as daily win and Mastery Pass gold)."

Use the won gems to draft Bo1 or Bo3 (Bo3 might have slightly higher expected value in terms of # of rares, but play/draft strategy is a bit different).  Don't open any packs until you have somewhere in the neighbourhood of 80-100 packs.  The exact number can be found with a formula (google rare drafting formula) and there are various spreadsheet trackers that will help you figure out the right moment.  The key to this strategy is that you have duplicate protection when opening packs, so you pick every rare you see in draft where you don't have the protection, and then when you have, say, 100 rares to go and 100 packs to open, you are guaranteed to complete the set.

That said, if you are going to buy packs with gold, I'd buy the new set.  Use your WCs to craft ELD cards you know you want/need.  You won't know with THD (TBD?) cards are safe to craft (outside of a few obvious ones) until the meta has settled in a couple weeks."

It might do better with Paradise Druids instead of the Flourishings, but they are helpful for finding the Fires."

Is that a must kill threat more because of the mana or the card draw?  I tend to think it's the latter, but I've never seen that card in play."
MagicArena,fdljhsg,t1_fdlgmmf,1578525393.0,"Fair point, but I think this highlights how much stronger Nissa is versus this card.  Even if you don't untap with Nissa, you've gotten a 3/3 Vigilance creature out of it.  This card has the upside of producing more mana, but it's also a hell of a lot easier to get rid of than Nissa (5 vs 6 toughness, vulnerable to enchantment and creature removal, etc.)."
MagicArena,fdlj790,t1_fdlg6jj,1578525205.0,I don't think you want to cast this without being able to activate it right away.  This seems more like a card that you hold until you have your X spell ready to go.
MagicArena,fdlj0s2,t1_fdlhw4y,1578525089.0,"Yeah, it might find a spot in EDH or Brawl.  But the thing is, this card does one thing really well - it makes a ton of mana.  Decks that make use of a ton of mana are usually using it to kill or mill you outright.  An EDH/Brawl deck that is doing that is going to have a lot of different cards that accelerate/multiply mana.  Will this replace one of those cards and make that deck *a lot* better?  I'm not sure."

If you are playing so much other ramp that you can get this guy out (and make use of him) on Turn 4 or 5, then how much room do you have in your deck to kill the opponent?

Maybe you can do something like this:

4x Nissa  
4x This guy  
4x Nissa's Triumph  
4x Circuitous Route  
4x Incubation Druid  
4x Leafkin Druid  
4x Finale of Devastation  
4x Big Green Creature  
4x Stonecoil Serpent  

Maybe splash blue for Growth Spiral, Krasis, etc.?  Maybe it could work."
MagicArena,fdl9kx9,t1_fdl4ppg,1578519374.0,"> You could argue that this isn’t great ramp because it’s quite expensive and ramp is better at lower CMC

Well, yes, that's the point.  Call me crazy but ramp that costs 7 mana doesn't really make the cut for me.  This is a very specialized form of ramp that takes you from A LOT of mana to AN INSANE AMOUNT of mana.  This goes in a specific type of deck.  ""Ramp,"" to me, are cards that accelerate your mana that are relatively widely applicable.

Fires of Invention accelerates your mana, but I wouldn't consider it Ramp because it needs a specific type of deck to work well.

EDIT: Another part of the definition of Ramp for me is something you play as soon/early as possible (barring needing to do something else like deal with an opponent's threat instead of casting Grow from the Ashes).  You don't necessarily do that with this card, because you'll want to make sure to use him the turn he comes down."
MagicArena,fdl94g8,t1_fdl6gfz,1578519142.0,"Yes, if you can stack the top 10 cards of your deck, this card is powerful. I was trying to imagine something a little more reasonable.

So you have Grazer, Spiral, 2 mana dorks, and 5 lands, for 9 cards needed by 3 where you've seen 11 total.  And then one of the last two in your hand or your top deck needs to be this guy.  Might as well buy a lottery ticket at that point."
