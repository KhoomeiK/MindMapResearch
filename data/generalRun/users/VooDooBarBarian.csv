dune,ffgm104,t1_ffft3vn,1579909358.0,"I didn't outright hate the Legends of Dune trilogy.

That being said, ""contrived"" only barely covers it. Remember in Phantom Menace when we find out that Anakin built C-3P0? This is like that, but on steroids. Brian wrote that trilogy so that he could lay claim to everything that makes the Dune universe interesting. Within a single human generation we have: the creation of Mentats, the discovery of Arrakis, the founding of the Bene Gesserit, the invention of glowglobes, suspensors, and the Holtzman drive, the founding of the Spacing Guild...

Oh, and on top of all that, every one of the characters is an ancestor of someone from the original novels... Like I said, I didn't hate them, but your tolerance for contrivance will be tested over and over again."

The idea that someone should be excluded because of something they have no control over (gender, ethnicity, height, etc) is bullshit.
