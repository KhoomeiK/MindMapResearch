In my last job, somehow they had too big of a space, so there were rows of empty cubes. They moved my team Facilities + EHS (barely 4 folks) at the end of the building, with at least 4 empty rows as a buffer, because we were just way too loud. That was fun."

OSHA,ffabkse,t1_ffa34yt,1579731701.0,"Like others said, it's not legal to be punished or discriminated for reporting unsafe work conditions or environment. Your school would be in bigger trouble than they are now if they were to go that route.

Also, anonymous reporting is definitely a thing. Just give a call, you don't have to give your name, address or anything."
DIY,ff3ksfx,t1_ff251cz,1579543156.0,"It's polyester vs. cotton. You might get some nice surprise due to the composition of the thread and fabric.

 I once dyed a white cotton dress in black and the threads remained white because they are polyester. I recently dyed a polyester dress with purple dye designed for synthetic material and I got different shade of purple depending on the polyester mix (the yoke was mostly cotton, the lace 100% polyester and the lining was a mix)."

Our previous technology allowed us to recycle mixed plastic into crude oil but with the price of the barrel falling down, it was not economically sustainable."

Portland,fdqzkew,t1_fdqgd1i,1578677430.0,I was comfortable with snow driving too until I moved to Portland and had to drive thru Multnomah village frozen and not de-iced at all. It was a freaking sh*t show.

We are not that different after all."
pics,fdkplro,t1_fdkn3so,1578508510.0,"Hiking and camping is cheap AF.
As for more exotic travels, target countries that have a cheaper cost of life than yours. Don't travel in the peak season (my bday is mid September, kids are back to school, way cheaper than traveling in July). Look for deals. Consider less ""luxury""/comfort (like cooking your own food instead of going to restaurants, take the bus/train instead of renting a car) and use the savings for super cool activities."

I ended up spending my bday in the Atlas (Morocco), hiking for 2 weeks with a group of people I've never met before, or hiking/camping alone in the Olympic peninsula in Washington state. Some of my best birthday celebrations!"

gifs,fdcj3md,t1_fdaytb7,1578276159.0,"Reminds me of the Eurotunnel under the Channel. They started boring on both sides and they met in the middle, which was quite a impressive job. I remember seeing on TV when the engineers were waiting for the second boring machine of the first of the 3 tunnels, right under the sea, and finally the second one arrived, joining the tunnel and stopped. It was a huge celebration.

Now I don't recall what they did with the machines. They may have been left under the sea."

todayilearned,fcxwev0,t1_fcxslvn,1578071409.0,"My explanation may have been confusing. In French, the word croissant is used for the pastry but also for the crescent shape. Like the moon ""un croissant de lune"". A croissant pastry is named after its shape, and that's why calling a pain au chocolat a chocolate croissant doesn't make any sense to the French, because it's rectangular."
todayilearned,fcxron1,t1_fcxmkfc,1578069533.0,"A croissant is called as such in French because it a triangular dough rolled in a crescent shape. Now, I agree with you, most croissants nowadays are not really crescent shaped. However it makes a complete difference with a pain au chocolat that is rectangular, the corners are not dry as with a croissant and there's an awesome thin chocolate bar in the middle. Two if your baker is a kind man.

Now I want a pain au chocolat."
todayilearned,fcxjnpa,t1_fcxg480,1578064575.0,Petit pain au chocolat ! ;)
todayilearned,fcxjkl7,t1_fcxheb6,1578064516.0,And it's an heresy cause it's not a croissant (crescent in English). IMHO these are two different things. I have a huuuuuge preference for pain au chocolat.
