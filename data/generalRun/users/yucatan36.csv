Also, I've met so many girls that were either strippers or in porn that become nurses, any thoughts as to why nursing is chosen?

Do you have any friends, neighbors or anyone you can frequently chat with? It would be harder to just visit a store and talk a few words a day. But you need to be having 20-30 min conversations often with Ticos or Nicas. They light up when you are not native and speak Spanish with them. I must have 15+ WhatsApp numbers just from the last two months. I found if I just go up and say something or ask a question the conversation goes on and on. In a store or mall, never, they are working and don't care. I haven't found as much slang here as I did in Mex, just a lot of Pura Vida and Mae. Also, take time away from your gringo groups and go out on your own."

shopify,fdn4kv3,t1_fdn0dmq,1578577102.0,"Thanks, I have optimized the same things but unfortunately you have a slim chance of getting top 10 to 20 positions with Shopify. There is a lot of issues with having things like ""product"" and ""category"" in your urls. You cant change those which is pretty terrible. They are useless words that extend character length. Also tons of duplicate issues, especially if you have variants. But no control over robots.txt. I understand it is easy and works for most, but my last site was 250k visitors a year. So I need the same flexibility to do what I do. I appreciate it though and good luck."

Nothing there that tourist wouldn't be around this time of year, but it's an epic place. San Jose, if you want less tourist you can head to Atenas, it's 45 min from San Jose. Even on there way there from San Jose it's beautiful rolling hills. Just stopping at little home Restaurants is a unique. I stopped at a random place where they give you a fishing pole with plantains for bait. You catch a trout in the back of the home and they fry it up with papas.
