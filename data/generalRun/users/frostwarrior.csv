But eventually they talk to me as if I were a psychologist and it becomes tiring and the friendship feels more like therapy.

I recently said to a friend it would be better to pay someone more professional and prepared because all we were talking was about her sadness and bitterness. And I'm still a friend. The point of hanging with a friend is to have a good time."

After a year and a half, I still have back, flexibility and posture problems. Even though I explicitly asked them for a routing that will help me with all of that.

It's crowded as hell, 5 people have to share the same pair of dumbbells and there are people waiting in line to get into the treadmill (there are like 20 treadmill machines).

Worst of all, it closes relatively early, so I have to RUSH every exercise to complete a routine or else the gym closes and sorry for me.

I'm tired of this."

linuxmasterrace,fdxstpk,t1_fdwxkcs,1578772518.0,"In fact, Windows is the only one that really cares about end users. Mainly for economic reasons but still

Linux (and most FOSS projects) are too centered on the developers choices about the project.

Even desktops environments like GNOME just don't care about end user feedback and disqualified every negative response about their design choices.

Most of the open source communities have a critical lack of design and UX. Either because design costs money, or because most devs and power users simply lose touch with what is obvious and what is not. Of course, I don't care if the button is green, red, blue or just an underlined hyperlink in Times New Roman. For my dad, it can mean clicking the wrong way in a multiple step procedure and moments of frustration later."
