That is why taller people do sometimes tend to be skinnier, they would have to eat a lot more to maintain more fat on that frame. We have to eat what's correct for our body size (height) and not somebody else's, unfortunately. I can eat the same amount as someone 6ft but if I am nearly 1ft shorter than them then that is a lot of excess calories for me. A little excess every day is how you pile on the pounds. Not sure of your gender either but men also just naturally burn a couple 100 more calories just by existing, so if you are woman comparing yourself to men is not helpful either."

I used to get such sore knees from standing around all day, now I never do. I feel much less clumsy and more light on my feet and more energetic. I'm not sure at what point below 190 those benefits came along but I just can't imagine lugging 40lbs around every day (even though I did it, for years). I am sure there's zero chance you won't feel better if you kept on going!

YOu can just take 2 of those and come in at 600 cals or less. Heck you can even get orange chicken and one of those and clock in at maybe 650. That's reasonable for lunch assuming you don't go all-out at dinnertime (and just eat about the same as for lunch).

loseit,fdodv4o,t3_elp6vh,1578603320.0,"I eat fast food or fast casual food for lunch at work every day. It's convenience really and I want something interesting for lunch to look forward to. What I did was try to figure out what was the lowest calorie thing I could get at my usual fast food places and only stick to those things. For example, Chipotle isn't so bad if you get a bowl, skip the guac and sour cream and cheese. (Or maybe include just a LITTLE)  You can also caution them not to be so heavy handed with the rice, etc. Heck I have a friend who goes there and just gets a burrito with nothing but chicken, salsa and gauc. They have a calculator to make it easy to calculate a combination of calories that is more like 600 than 1200. I do a lot of snooping of menus/nutrition info ahead of time before I leave, and I even entered it into fitnesspal before I get there so I can't change my mind. EVen for Taco bell (which is not a place I frequent so not so familiar) you can jsut stick to getting like 1 or 2 tacos or something, instead of going all out. 

If tricks like that help you find a SUSTAINABLE lower calorie routine then maybe it will help your progress. Sometimes that's better than depriving yourself completely. I have a couple places I can go regularly, Panera, Panda Express, Chipotle, a mediterranean place, etc and find something satisfying for under 600 calories. Heck I even used to go to Five Guys and just get a little cheeseburger and skip the fries. It's doable."

If you followed them around at home they most likely don't eat like that all of the time. They may exercise, and if they are taller than you that'd make a difference as well with what they can ""get away with"". I'm sure people who never knew me when I was 55lbs heavier think I eat a lot but that's just because if I'm eating out with friends I am celebrating, when I go home I eat very boring, count my calories and exercise, and I know that's what makes the difference because I absolutely did not do that when I was 190 lbs."
