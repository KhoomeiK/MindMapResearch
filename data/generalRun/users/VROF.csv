TLCsisterwives,fgnxvwe,t3_ezi0ir,1580955298.0,"I think there was just a lot more excitement with Robyn. With Janelle and Christine it seemed like the marriages happened because the religion dictates at least 3 wives. They lived in poverty, he says he wasn’t attracted to Christine, she hated her wedding dress and wanted to be 3rd because it was easy. It was all about duty and life sucked because they were poor and Kody was never capable of supporting his family.

Then they decide to try and do the show (I think Christine made this happen). TLC probably expressed interest so they decide to have another baby to make it more interesting and bring in a new wife. The real “courting” was probably deciding who they knew in real life that would agree to become part of the family. They settle on Robyn who probably only agreed to do it because she would get paid, and didn’t have to live with them in their polygamy poor house compound. She didn’t have to share a pantry or work out transportation or childcare; she had her own house and handled her own kids while she dated a guy that for the first time in his life had money. 

Robyn and Kody’s marriage was the first that was exciting. It was a huge celebration with a big budget. I bet the other three never had a cake tasting, or got to pick out an expensive dress, and they damned sure didn’t take a two week luxury honeymoon. 

It was just a totally different experience which is probably why Kody treats it more like a conventional marriage than he did with Christine"

At the very least you should always leave the spigot open. [This lady actually pours water over her can o’ worms](https://youtu.be/ZAR056WD9qU) and hers seem to be doing well.

I’ve had mine for several years and after the first year I gave up on adding trays and now I just set up all three trays with coco coir and shredded paper for bedding. I feed in the top tray only (unless I have tons of scraps) and rotate the trays once in a while. I keep a thick layer of damp cardboard or newspaper on the top of the top tray and when I feed I try to bury the scraps and cover them with shredded paper. This works out great for me. 

My only complaint with this bin is a lot of worms end up in the very bottom, especially when it is warm. During the summer I actually put shredded paper down there to soak up the moisture and provide food for the worms that fall down there. 

I might just get a piece of window screen to put between that and the bottom tray."

AmItheAsshole,fglbvom,t1_fgkksf4,1580889951.0,"This situation is textbook bad parenting. And it was preceded by a lot of other bad parenting which is why they ended up pulling this bullshit move. 

If OP was a friend of mine asking for advice I would suggest that moving forward they make a real effort to only engage in positive ways with their daughter. Don’t take any bait into fights and try to say positive things to her always. They should do this after they sit her down and apologize for what they did, explain that they are frustrated with having them ask someone who is almost an adult to do their basic chores. TALK to her about how they should move forward and explain that she is almost an adult and needs to be treated as such then ask her for some suggestions on ways she could be given more responsibilities. Not just chores, but responsibilities for managing her own life, maybe more freedoms she thinks she can handle.

So many people told me “they have to learn” to justify making my kids suffer through some miserable experience. The worst one was telling me having bad teachers was ok because “they have to learn” to deal with bad bosses when they grow up. Personally, I don’t think we need to train for working with difficult people by going to school with assholes. 

By the time my youngest graduated from high school I let him run his life. If the school called with an absence I cleared it automatically because if my son didn’t want to go to school he must have had a reason. As long as his grades were ok then I was fine with it. He is going to graduate from college with honors this semester.

AmItheAsshole,fgl8f9e,t1_fgktzkt,1580885717.0,Your daughter should never think her period is embarrassing. By not sharing this with a medical professional you are setting a bad example for her. She needs to feel comfortable telling the nurse what is wrong.
AmItheAsshole,fgl7w41,t1_fgl50bh,1580885133.0,"This girl is going to grow up to be an actual adult, maybe a mother of her own children and she will look back on this event and judge it with an adult perspective. I just don’t see how not emptying a dishwasher deserves this kind of punishment. But OP and his wife have also managed to raise a kid that does not see herself as part of the family and her chores as an important part of making the family run smoothly. 

By 16 she should be in charge of doing her own laundry, helping with grocery shopping, cooking some meals, in addition to the other chores they pay her to do. But this is all based on mutual respect and these parents don’t seem to have any for her"
AmItheAsshole,fgl7hgu,t1_fgl468l,1580884698.0,"You can’t undo the damage overnight. At some point OP and his wife are going to expect this girl to live on her own. When do they expect her to get these skills? 

Treating a kid like an adult is not letting them do what they want, but it is giving her adult responsibilities and privileges. Emptying the dishwasher is a pretty low level chore. She could be responsible for cooking dinner one night, helping with grocery shopping, doing her own laundry, etc. She should be encouraged to get a job. She should be exploring college or other educational options. She should be allowed more freedoms with friends as she shows more responsibility at home.

Boiling this all down to emptying the dishwasher is not helpful. OP sounds just as immature as his daughter. He does not respect her, does not see her as a young adult but more a child who should be tainted and shamed in front of her friends."

I was a total hardass as a parent and what OP did would never have occurred to me. But I strongly believe in treating 16 year olds like adults.

No adult I know would tolerate this kind of treatment from people who are supposed to love us. 

I’ve never agreed with punishment for kids or teens. Only logical consequences work and they should be used because we are trying to raise good adults in the long run, not just get the dishwasher emptied on time. 

If this was my kid the first thing I would do is stop paying her for chores that are family responsibilities. No one pays OP for loading the dishwasher, why pay her for emptying it? If she doesn’t empty it right after school then she does all of the dishes that night. Period. And that continues until she does her chores on time."

The recruiter asked her to join him for dinner with the other students he had talked to. They were all engineers.

Being involved and active in your interests makes you almost more employable than the almighty STEM degree. In my experience people with Biology or Chemistry degrees are just as unemployable as people with Sociology or Gender Studies degrees if they don’t have a good resume. Employers want to see work experience and references; making connections through jobs, activities and clubs makes that easier. 

I would suggest going to career fairs and talking to the employers there. See what is out there and practice talking to recruiters. One complaint I hear from recruiters is that students at career fairs don’t know how to talk to them and seem really uncomfortable and awkward; those who are comfortable talking about jobs and opportunities stand out, regardless of their major. 

If you are a good student who connects with your teachers and forms relationships through clubs and organizations you will have tons of opportunities regardless of your major"

TLCsisterwives,fgh39cq,t1_fggwbvc,1580775656.0,Didn’t they all share a 3 bedroom mobile home at one point?
TLCsisterwives,fgh381x,t1_fggzfui,1580775630.0,Meri will not be around enough to bother her. Christine has always been the one to watch Janelle’s kids and I bet she doesn’t want to be Robyn’s babysitter
TLCsisterwives,fgh32lx,t3_eyfnys,1580775527.0,"She lived in her own apartment at the Utah house so she knows that it is not the same as having her own home. We can all talk about how it’s her own space but she has lived it and knows that it isn’t.

There is no way that Robyn, who has not lived in a house like that will ever agree to it. She is living in an insanely huge house right now, I don’t see her trading that in for a luxury apartment."
TeardropTrailers,fggo1rb,t3_eyc5zo,1580765861.0,"The A frame pop ups are great. Love those! They do leak sometimes so store them covered.

Have you considered having one or both kids sleep in the van?"
AmItheAsshole,fgge0oy,t1_fgf6irw,1580759896.0,"This guy sounds like an extreme creeper and harasser. He shortens her name which assumes a familiarity they don’t have, repeatedly asks her about her “culture” and wants to meet up outside of work. Then says “she’s not my type at all.” Then leave her alone"
AmItheAsshole,fggdnxs,t1_fgf6lie,1580759682.0,These people started at the company at the same time and he’s giving her career advice about her name. What an asshole
AmItheAsshole,fggc8be,t1_fgfuowg,1580758804.0,I think the church probably pays for that privilege. I know they do stuff like this in San Francisco because the neighborhoods of 2 bedroom homes are now 5 bedroom homes with 3-4 cars so there is no street parking anymore.
AmItheAsshole,fggb14x,t1_fgga7kp,1580758071.0,I don’t know where OP lives but we just picked my son up at the San Diego airport and the traffic was INSANE. I can’t imagine having to navigate that with poor vision in bad weather.
AmItheAsshole,fgg5o2g,t1_fgetgah,1580754783.0,She should at least look at her local Community college for some courses that would help. In California the first year is free
ApplyingToCollege,fgg2e7w,t1_fgg14mu,1580752769.0,"Investigate. The point of standardized tests are everyone takes the same exam in the same environment.

That proctor should not be used again."
ApplyingToCollege,fgg04d3,t1_fgfe86c,1580751366.0,"It is so much easier and can even be a better education. There is just no reason to kill yourself in APUSH when you can take it online for cheap or free from a CC and get an A. Then take something you like for the next semester. 

In California it is so easy to transfer CC units and they offer tons of GE classes online. Taking them in person one night a week is great too. And if you do well and connect with the teacher they can write you a letter of rec which looks great coming from a college teacher"
AmItheAsshole,fgfzt3a,t1_fgf9dbm,1580751174.0,If he believed the heart attack thing he should have left work because it was an emergency.
NetflixNextInFashion,fgf124i,t3_ey29k3,1580718703.0,"I loved this show so much. It was like back in the first seasons of Project Runway. It seems so fresh. I loved how the judges talk to the designers, I loved the challenges and most of all I loved how the clothes always looked polished and finished. Even the stuff I didn’t like. I also liked how they weren’t trying to stretch it into 90 minutes for commercials and product placement. 

I hope each of the Queer Eye guys gets a show like this because we deserve good tv"
disability,fgezca6,t3_exxsco,1580716326.0,Caucuses need to end. The stakes are too high to have this be any kind of method of picking a nominee
