OculusQuest,fehzzqm,t1_fehz42s,1579127322.0,"Yeah I think the issue is more network based than anything else. My theory is that you have to have PERFECT network conditions including channels, traffic, bands, etc.. otherwise casting simply WILL not work. And even wifi will drop randomly (even on a non-mesh network)... so you probably just have the perfect router/network conditions, so casting works for you on all devices
