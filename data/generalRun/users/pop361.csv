fatlogic,ff1xtke,t1_ff1fqz0,1579488639.0,"I'd love to see a version where they have a few weeks at the ranch as a fitness boot camp where they learn healthy cooking and eating habits and also try different exercise routines to see what works for them, then go home and come back a few weeks later for an intensive weekend capped off by a weigh-in and elimination. I know that it would take a while to make a season, but they could start filming other seasons while one is still in progress."
