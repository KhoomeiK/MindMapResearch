aww,ff1nz2d,t3_eqtnj9,1579482351.0,Omg these could be my girls.
AfricanViolets,fddk2by,t1_fdcnw75,1578315343.0,Thanks that makes sense on why I have two crowns. Can I just leave them as is?
AfricanViolets,fdbqt40,t1_fdbbx8h,1578260413.0,"Thanks. This one was normal AV when I purchased it. Then started crown this long stalk. There was like 4 inches between the soil and the first set of leaves. So I scraped the stalk and replanted it so the stalk was in the soil. Seamed happy for a while the started growing a 2nd crown. This little AV just seems to want to be a little wild. 

I’m  not sure how to split it up without killing it. My AV success is all dumb luck. I can’t say I really know what I’m doing. I think I’m just lucky they like the lights under my kitchen cabinets."

Pottery,fd2l453,t3_ejov2q,1578148765.0,"For clay recycling- be careful if you add dry ingredients.  Read up on clay dust. Where protective mask. I usually just let the clay dry a bit and wedge it well. 

In fact you should read up on clay dust anyway. Google silica dust. Clean up only with wet cloth. Never clean up dry. 

For glazings- look for a craft guild I. Your area. They usually have classes or you can join just to get access to the studio. Also.you can look for local potters that can help you learn. Try going on Nextdoor app and see it there is one near you."
