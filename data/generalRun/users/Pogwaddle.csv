Keto_Food,fegwt0r,t1_fds0tij,1579104288.0,I have a preference for Boston Lettuce because it has a nice shape for wraps but I usually end up using Romaine because it grows nicely in my Aerogarden when I fire it up over winter. In the spring and summer I have all different kinds growing outside.

No one wants to take short-term temp jobs. Someone willing to do this suddenly becomes popular with employers. I told my temp agency that I needed to build my resume and wanted them to promote me to big name companies. My first job was a 4 week gig doing remote upgrades to American Eagle Outfitter servers. The day after that contract ended, I did 6 weeks for Allison Rolls Royce during a roll-out. They extended my contract another two weeks and the manager said they would have hired me if there had been an open position. The day after that contract ended, I walked into the next temp workplace. All the companies I worked for had name recognition. Each new employer saw who I'd been working for and it made me more attractive as an employee. After the first three jobs I told the temp agency not to call me unless they hit a minimum hourly rate. 

After about four months I landed a temp to hire job and they made me a supervisor."

Dogtraining,fdrayqz,t3_emtbul,1578681946.0,"It sounds like the pup has decided that taking care of your wife is her job. She is a mix of several working breeds so this attitude comes naturally. 

You need to give her extra motivation and fun to bring her focus to you. Start by taking her for her morning walk before you feed her. Being hungry when you have a high value treat in your pocket will soon capture her attention. I recommend chopping up a little smoked salmon and mixing it with her serving of kibble so it's extra stinky. The morning walk/training session is breakfast and will quickly become something she looks forward to. Channel your inner teenage girl when training (at least keep in mind you need to sound like one). According to the trainer we work with, the people who have the easiest time and fastest results training dogs is teenage girls. Use a softer, higher voice and get excited when the pup does something right.  

The nice part is you can take advantage of this pups nature and love for your wife. Train her to help around the house. Our Border Collie picks up socks people sprinkle around my house, color sorts laundry with supervision, gives me the remote when I drop it on the floor, etc"

This is totally how I get mine. I just dry it at the end of the year as it doesn't survive a Michigan winter...at least not under my care. I end up using the lemon grass for a bunch of stuff.

I can yell 'down' at my dog when she is quite a distance away and she'll do it.

Dogtraining,fcuuev2,t3_eizxth,1577988717.0,"He's young. If you can't just tell him 'NO' in a stern voice to get him to stop behavior you don't like, replace the leash with one made of chain. Chewing or tugging on that isn't fun. After he matures a bit, you can go back to a leather or nylon leash because the habit will be broken and you will have had time to teach proper behaviors."
Dogtraining,fcuoc30,t3_eiz8cu,1577985239.0,"We work hard on teaching that 'sit' is the default mode when greeting people or even when excited. You don't get attention until the butt is on the floor. Take puppers to a hardware or farm store. I know Home Depot TSC, and Rural King usually allow dogs. Just tell people what you are training the dog to do and ask if they will help by ignoring her until she sits. Then they can treat and pet....but go back to ignoring if she breaks sit. She'll catch on pretty quickly because attention is EVERYTHING."
Dogtraining,fcuntgo,t3_eizae5,1577984952.0,I'd definitely get him back into the vets. You said he has been getting along well with the pup and a dog his age would not have a personality change like that without something causing it.

ketorecipes,fcukjam,t1_fcp43oa,1577983060.0,"Oil will work as well, but I recommend the silicone mats because they are super easy clean up (often don't need to worry about the pan at all) and I am a cheapskate. Like $3'ish + for every can of spray oil, which has to be replaced vs $6 for a silicone mat that I can reuse for years.   


Of course, you can save by just putting oil into a hand pumped spray bottle (I've done it) but the silicone mats are cheaper in the long run and less fuss."

I'd say all told, it takes me 15 minutes with most of the time being devoted to kneading the dough. Kneading helps develop the elastic gluten aka the glue that keeps noodles from dissolving. The half hour rest is so the gluten strands can relax. Have you ever had dough that is hard to roll out and keeps shrinking? Resting takes care of that.

Make sure the soup is at a rolling boil when you put noodles in. They'll cook and swell a bit immediately. The thing about the fresh noodles is they will have some dryer flour on the outside so it will thicken your soup broth. That is one of the reasons I love them."

My Border Collie wears a shock collar when she is free.  Sometimes she gets too far away to hear me call her and I'm shit with the whistle. A vibration or beep from the collar is generally enough to get her attention. Twice in 5 years, I've had to shock her on the lowest setting. In both instances, she was endangering herself and not listening to commands. This could be an option for you to keep her from running people over. If this is a route you decide to take, make sure you work with a trainer to ensure you know the proper use of the tool.
