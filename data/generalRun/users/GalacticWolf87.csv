TrollXChromosomes,ffz8gn3,t1_ffyukbu,1580367254.0,Maybe that’s part of their choice too? I mean imagine having to see pictures and hear people talk about your family members 24/7 on the news and social media. I think later the family might care more but I think I’m this stage of the grieving period it’s for the best.

TrollXChromosomes,ffybfkh,t1_ffxqj24,1580342440.0,"Who’s they? I personally cared about him because he was an influence in my life growing up. I knew of him. But I’m sorry, I have sympathy for the families who lost family in the crash and I’m sorry that any lives had to be lost. It’s a fucking shame. But without knowing them at all it’s hard to feel much past that. It’s like your not going to feel the same emotions for a friend who died versus maybe a friends distant cousin. 
And you shouldn’t assume either, people can care about Kobe dying and care about all those other things. Shit I do. But at the moment there’s only so much you can do besides spread awareness 

I understand on this subreddit that’s no one likes Kobe and that’s fine, I’m not here to argue, change anyone’s mind or have anyone change my mind. But there’s an obvious reason that people have more of a connection with Kobe and Gianna than the other people in the crash, but I’m 100% everyone isn’t okay with the other people dying and do have sympathy for the families."

I read a quote I liked the other day:

“Just because you did something wrong in the past doesn’t mean you can’t advocate against it now. It doesn’t make you a hypocrite, you grew. Don’t let people use your past to invalidate your current mindset : growth.”


Rape is 100% wrong. No one is going to argue that. Kobe was 100% wrong for raping her. But shitty people can make a choice to be shunned and stay shitty or change their mindset and grow.   Kobe did something horrendous that will forever impact a woman’s life. But he recognized what he did was wrong, he made that choice to not be an R. Kelly and just keep raping women while not taking responsibility/accountability for their actions. 

I can’t always forgive or forget someone who has done something malicious but I can respect them for making the choice care enough to change."

By looking at the pictures could be 294939 things, hot spot, foreign body, allergies, spider or scorpion bite, valley fever depending on where you live, etc. 1. Put an E collar on if he’s licking and biting it. 2. If the meds aren’t working usually the best bet is to go to a dermatologist, most vets will use simplicef, cephalexin as far antibiotics for the skin infection and apoquel and prednisone for the irritation, maybe some topical ointment. But I would say if those aren’t working, and you’re preventing him from licking his paw, and it’s still there, dermatologist.

If Chris told his family that she tricked into having another kid somehow then no shit his family is going to have this same reaction, the only thing lacking is them also being aware that Chris just as much trash for choosing to have sex with a woman who he knows wants to have another kid from him, who wants to be with him and still choosing to not use a condom."

2. Obviously want's to trap Chris.
3. Condoms exist
4. Birth Control exists

They are just trash people. It is clear where her maturity level is and Chris's either lack of intelligence or despite the obvious infront of him, still refuses to wear a condom. I feel bad for the soon to be kid through all this and I hope them they best possible out come co-parent wise for their sake, but as for Kail and Chris.

I say all because with Jo it could be fine and then she flips on him, and Chris clearly unstable. And if abortion isn’t an option that fine but use birth control! I know she’s an anti-vaxxer but being on 16&p and teen mom you would think she would get like an IUD or something.
