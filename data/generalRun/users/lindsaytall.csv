Alternatively, we could refer to BMI 19-25 as “average” because that’s where most people SHOULD fall. It’s an ideal-average. It’d be dishonest to call it an “average” because most people aren’t there, though. 

I mean she’s got a lot of word salad in that piece but I get her point that average should be honest. If you’re a healthy BMI you aren’t (statistically speaking) “average.”"
