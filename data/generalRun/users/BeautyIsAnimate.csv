aww,ffr4ir4,t1_ffmwh4f,1580150287.0,Jayzus! Speaking of assholes...shouldn’t you be over on Twitter making everyone miserable?
aww,ffr3tql,t1_ffor0vt,1580149856.0,"My pleasure!

Yes, I noticed the tree as well. I was trying to figure out what kind of tree it was. It’s difficult to tell because of the blurriness. My best guess would be an oak. This is the most likely reason for the retained leaves:

aww,ffmq816,t1_ffm6la3,1580057840.0,"Honestly, we (Ohioans) have had an unusually warm winter. I live in the northern part of the state (just a couple of miles from the Ohio/Michigan state line) and there were days in December that I wore a hoodie as opposed to a winter coat. There was even one day in December when I was out on my deck in a t-shirt and jeans! We’ve had very little snow, as well.

ETA: The day after Christmas it was 60!


Yesterday, almost as far north in Ohio as you can go, it was 40 degrees.

sugarfree,ff6siu8,t3_ersyld,1579633975.0,"Sugar is a hell of a drug.

Did you know that the way sugar lights up a scan of the brain of a sugar addict is very nearly identical to the way cocaine lights up the brain of a coke addict?

I found that I have to treat sugar the same way  I treat alcohol. (I’m 23 years sober.) I know that if I drink, I die. It might not be immediate, but it will happen a whole lot sooner than it would have if I stay sober (or clean from sugar).

Suggestions based on my experience: google podcasts, videos, books by Robert Lustig, MD. He only shares evidence based information on sugar. I also find he presents information in a way that is easily understood.

I find it takes about 90-100 days for the cravings to really decrease. I also know if I don’t take it one day at a time I’m going to be overwhelmed which increases the “f*ck it” factor. I’ll be more likely to just give up and relapse.

Not everyone is willing to do this: consider going to an open AA meeting. “Open” means you don’t have to be an alcoholic to attend. I find, if I replace “alcohol” with “sugar” and “alcoholic” with “sugar addict” (or just addict) I’m able to translate the information so I can apply it to my sugar addiction.

Wishing you all the best!"

WholeFoodsPlantBased,fems7c1,t1_femqub5,1579268102.0,The reason I asked is because it appears this “nutritionist” is putting you on a diet for diabetes. Did he tell you that you should only eat so many grams of carbohydrates per day and/or per meal?
WholeFoodsPlantBased,femghjt,t1_feli02n,1579254286.0,Only $40 per session? That’s a hell of a deal! When I saw a registered dietitian in 1994 I paid $110.

Just about to try a ginger sparkling water from prime pantry. I *might* sweeten that with a splash of 100% apple juice depending on how strong the ginger is.

There are also water bottles with inserts that allow you to make your own flavored waters. You can use strawberries, blueberries, lemons, limes, oranges, mint leaves, etc. Oo! I bet putting some chocolate mint leaves in would be nice.
