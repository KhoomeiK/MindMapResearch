AskEurope,fglf8nd,t3_ez1646,1580894682.0,"I would like to explain to you how our system works:

I live in Italy, we have both public and private facilities.

Of course the private ones are way more expensive than the public ones but you have to wait less. 

One of the few issues we have with our public healthcare system are the queues for seeing a specialist and for getting some exam. Whereas in the private sector you don't have to wait.

When you go to the hospital to see a specialist and/or getting an exam (radiology, blood works and so on) you will have to pay before having the visit or the exam just a little bit and the cost can be used later on to pay less yearly taxes. 

If you are more than 65 years old or you have a preexisting condition you can be exempted to pay even that.

Now, let's just give you an example:

When I was pregnant I didn't go through the private system, going always to the same gynecologist and so on. I went with the public system. Everytime I had a different doctor that gave me the exams. I had extensive blood works during all the pregnancy and other exams. Then I went and gave birth through C-section. I paid less then 100€ for all of this. 

Even our medicines can be deducted from the yearly taxes.

And also if I go abroad to any EU country I will have free healthcare same as here in Italy.

So, yeah, I'm pretty sure for the US it would be a very good idea especially for the people. Not so much for the corporate in the hospitals and insurances. And the pharmaceutical companies.

I was especially horrified when I read the hospital bill of a new mom that for just seeing her newborn baby had to pay 40$... It is insane. And all the scandal about epipens and so on... It is just crazy"

askscience,fg5w2jr,t3_ewwmem,1580541297.0," I would like to understand the numbers better. 

The cases that we hear about in the news are only the reported ones by China officials. Are those numbers true or not? Or is China downplaying the number of persons that have the virus? The same goes for the number of deaths that the virus have caused.

I ask this because I have read this article by Gabriel Leung (a clinician and a public health authority, is Dean of the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong (HKU). Leung concurrently holds the Chair of Public Health Medicine at HKU) from Hong Kong that in a recent interview said that the cases are way more than the one reported. At least until 25th of January there were 44000 cases in Wuhan only.
