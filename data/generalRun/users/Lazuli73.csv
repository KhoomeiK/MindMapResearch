writing,feizoc9,t3_epcskg,1579151811.0,"I think of fanfiction as a good writing exercise for novice writers. You're working with an established universe and characters. You can just focus on the story you want to tell through them.

But my own unpopular opinion?

I'm not sure, per se, if I have any. I certainly have strong opinions, but I don't know whether any would be considered unpopular. Perhaps the fact that I don't read very much of other works may be a possibility? 

I've never been an avid reader, but I've always had a talent for writing. I've only been honing that skill tree for the last couple of years, but I don't necessarily contribute a lot of that skill trough reading other peoples' work.

Rather, I constantly edit my work by reading it over, and also indulge in a lot of critique media. Mainly videos on the Tube of You. I learn through that form of entertainment what other people love/hate in a certain property, their perspective on it, and their opinion on how they would improve it.

That would certainly be an unpopular opinion, in my eye. Generally a lot of people on this subreddit preach about taking in as much as you intend to put out. Though that is fair, I've never really needed that kind of influence, though I do read on occasion. Perhaps 1-2 books a year."

As said in the comments, I think it's important to know where your niece came from. Why her father turned to drugs and ultimately died. I personally don't see most addicts as criminals, like a lot of people seem to do. I see them as sick people. There are obvious exceptions, of course. Real scum that don't want to get better, but I think a lot more people turn to substances as a faster escape or alternative to dealing with some kind stress in their life. In your brother's case, that was the shame given unto him by the church for being gay. That is not right and that is why he died. I think it's critically important that she realise the consequences of the beliefs she is beginning to hold.

Would this be undermining your SIL's parenting. Maybe. You stated that you pretty much raised her too. You're a parental figure, even if you're not truly biological in the sense that your direct genetic material contributed to your niece. And her father is also your brother. You have a right to inform her about what really happened and what kind of scoiety caused his life to end so tragically.

As for the financial side of things? NTA. Though she is family, you are not obligated to provide her a tuition. Receiving a free ride through school should be a privilege she is grateful for. Becoming a person you don't see as kind or accepting or what have you, that if your choice to make. She can change for, in likely both of our opinions, as a person type in scoity that should be extinct, then that is your choice. A tough choice and a hard one, one that may ultimately screw her over, but like I said, everything has consequences.

I almost always find that she chooses to view something as an offence against her character. A shite character, one that makes me feel pity upon her boyfriend and have no sympathy towards her griping about not having any friends. I'm sorry you peaked in high school, sweetheart. Anyways, she takes wild offence to a simple joke, or oft finds herself as the but, and because she only sees childish puns and dad jokes as the height of comedy, is so offended that Yellowstone would be put to shame when she blows her top.

I think what may help you is maybe learning some common bar terms. Like 'on the rocks', and 'with a twist' and that ilk (the former meaning over ice and the latter meaning with a citrus peel). Knowing what you like to drink really helps you too. If you're able to spit out what you want and the bartender knows what you mean, and they're good at their job, the drink will just magically be there. And as a courtesy to bartenders, be able to understand what they serve. Not all bars offer the same drinks. Most likely you won't be able to get a frozen margarita in an Irish pub etc."

writing,fcw5b5j,t3_eiywwe,1578017492.0,"That's certainly something interesting I've never really actively considered before. Society is a complicated place, as men have just as many struggles and pressures and old-world norms burdening them as women. 

Men are expected to be strong, emotionally stoic breadwinners in many cultures and that is just as unfair as women being expected to be dainty, motherly, demure housewives. Naturally, writing male characters would give them their own perspective on the world that is often clumsily stereotyped. 

As mentioned in the comments, the perfect dream-guy in candy-trash romance novels are a common one. Where the man has the chiselled body of a Greek god statue, a humble personality, high sex drive, and unending attraction to the demure wall-flower female lead. However, a roll of the D20 will show another side, another stereotype of all men (in the context of that story) being cavemen short of a protruding brow ridge. Brutish, gruff, unkind and uncaring and aggressive. 

Men are more complicated than those stereotypes, and any other, and deserve far better writing and societal release as much as women. 

Most of my male protagonist characters are very emotionally intelligent and tend to not be shy to cry before people they have close connections with (partners, family, close friends). I think that's something really important that needs to be comments on, represented, and become normalised. A big thing in society that men are often denied are access and support and respect of their emotions.
