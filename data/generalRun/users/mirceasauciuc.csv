ramen,ffislk8,t1_ffis9hq,1579981674.0,"That's excellent. Thanks for sharing. The pin idea is a good one. That's where I get stuck sometimes is the peeling when they're too soft and the underneath film stick to the egg and makes the egg rip apart with the shell. Painful to do, especially when you know you've got a good egg! Thanks for sharing!"
