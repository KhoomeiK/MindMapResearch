You are correct in that theres very little time to do so, but its certainly possible. It happens in war all the time when they switch radar on, get a lock, fire the missile and then have to turn the radar back off because they got a targeting warning on the missile radar."

Giant airliners dont look like tomahawks on anyones radar on earth. Secondly, radars can see to about 100-200 feet agl. Not 6000 ft. Thirdly, they dont have 5th gen russian equipment. (S300 came out in 1967 btw, its been updated tho) Fourthly, if they did, it would have immediately alerted the tech it was a boeing 737 because modern radars know things like that. Fifthly, you dont think that controllers at the airport wouldnt tell the iads people a plane just took off?  You dont think the INTEGRATED air defense system isnt integrated with civilian radars??

edmproduction,fdkcxio,t3_elppqs,1578501229.0,"Its kinda hard to tell until you use nice plugins or outboard. Alot of the free or cheap shit isnt very good or its super exaggerated. 


For instance, i got a uad interface and satellite, i bought the satellite used but it was unopened, i lucked into a promotion for the $1000 package of comps/eqs/pres they do. So i got a bunch of nice plugins, and thats when i really started understanding the difference between an la2a, 1176, 670, etc. 


Basically, they react differently. So an la2a isnt for slamming drums, its a generally soft compression that makes most things sound a little louder without much more smack, and you can put them on your mixbus as long as they have a sidechain filter on them(called emphasis on la2a). An 1176 is super duper fast, like 1000x+ faster than an la2a. (And remember the attack/decay knobs are backwards on 1176) You can make it catch every transient and really make drums smack with it. You can also squash things flat, or use all buttons mode to do a distortion smack thing. Fairchild 670 is very mild and generally just tightens like real playing(guitar or singing) up a bit and makes it louder and sound better. 



You really need to use them to understand. Its like talking about the differences in which key you use to make a track changes how the subs hit. Its there, its real, but its hard to understand until you do it, on real subs. 



And usually the free plugins emulating these comps suck big time and are just thrown together comps with saturation and settings semi similar to the hardware, but not actually modeled. You need a uad, ni, acoustica, etc type of company’s plugins to really appreciate them."
