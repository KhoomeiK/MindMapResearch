relationship_advice,ffh8wo8,t3_etlv0k,1579926493.0,"Not gonna lie. As a married woman, living with someone... there is no buffer. You are in their unwinding space. Sometimes that will get sass lash. Now... there is NOT a fine line between sass lash and abuse. My father is a hard, critical military sarge who fixed engines (helicopters, planes, land vehicles - though very limited on tanks he had admitted, he just didnt like the hulking cunts)and this will always cause friction between him and my husband who is a more technologically inclined without the possibility of land mines or gunfire.  My husband make work in a foundry that makes parts for engines, but they still just  nit- the-fucking-pick out of each-other (oh its gut wrenching for me because I cant fuckin win no matter who I choose) 


For my father, not
Gonna lie, hes petty as fuck. Not coming from a bad place. He is my DAD but he adopted me, finalized when I was 8 two years after he married my mom. BUT he struggled with me, it tried (small fires, damn near psychotic behavior, fighting him every step of the way) and he believes I deserve the world. HE IS MY DAD. DNA need not
Apply to us. He would act the same if I married Elon Musk. 

For my
Husband, he isnt a child. He never go to be a child. He had to defend his mom against a drunk dad who was the keeper of the money. And he had to remind and physically beat his father unconscious so that his mother could pay bills. It was ugly.

My father should NOT be venting to me and my
Mom has told him as much. Telling him why love should be enough, my husband being godlike to me and I am the same to him (we are aware of the flaws - Zeus as a goose lol) but we are harmonized. I am selfish. My husband indulges this unless I get excessive and may harm our future or our childrens financial future. He is vain and proud. I am all too happy to get done up three times a year to be a trophy. I work for my form.


MY POINT BEING - he is going to bitch about
Your family. Thats the flaw of any SO. Any SO with no complaints Id worry is a sociopath. I am a wretched being, as is my husband. We had three kids because you should always have multiples in case of fatal freak accidents. We love them, but their number is not an accident. And your family isnt perfect, just like he isnt. The only thing is,.. you have an outright choice in deciding on whether or not your can tolerate a significant others flaws. 

I had an ex who was MALICIOUS about my parents. My dad is a hard ass. My mom is a strong woman but she gets tired and will let her husband bark all offenders down. He told them to to kill themselves, that we would have kids and they would NEVER see them.

For perceived privacy I didnt state their names outright. No Luna, Hermione, Fluer or Ginny.
