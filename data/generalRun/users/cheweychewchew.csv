Showerthoughts,fdb5pmg,t3_ekg1s1,1578254063.0,"Absolutely hate this about academic journals. Academics, especially those in the social sciences, are constantly crowing on about how their work isn't influential enough on society and how the world would be a better place if people only listened to what they had to say. Yet, the way the journals are set up, only fellow academics have free access to their research, hence an intellectual bubble of their own making. If they truly believed their research had substantial public value, they should make public access to their work a priority.

There won't be any WWIII. If there is a war, it'll be Iran v. US + Israel. The Russians and Chinese would love to see the U.S. blow its wad with this so they're gonna sit tight and enjoy a chocolate malt from the luxury box. And Europe sure ain't getting involved, especially since Trump has convinced its NATO partners that he's an untrustworthy asshole. The Saudi's might get involved, but fighting alongside Israel in a war against a muslim country would have a massive blowback domestically and in the region. Really, only the U.S. and Israel have an appetite for war with Iran."
