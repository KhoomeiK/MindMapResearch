k9sports,fbv6szq,t1_fbv6cr8,1577126460.0,"Day 3

1.  Dropping Kong out of motion and also able to walk over it. 
2. Sit while tossing toy remotely then send.
3. Dog sitting remotely and staying with thrown toy, then calling dog away from toy, heeling then send out.
4.  Sitting dog then walking a bigger distance away and throwing kong.......then walking back while he holds sit and I send him.
5. Teaching him not to just grab the kong out of my hand and that he can fetch it when I tell him to for safety and other reasons and that I can heel him with that as distraction also.
6. Differentiate between ‘fetch’ and ‘out’."
