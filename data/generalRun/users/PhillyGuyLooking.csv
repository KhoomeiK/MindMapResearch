datingoverthirty,femss4r,t3_epojr6,1579268574.0,"I used to do this sometimes. I don’t consider it a “lie” because I disclose my age right away when I first start chatting with a match. 

Why did I used to change my age?

Simple. So that I would show up in search results with women whose age range I would more likely have a relationship with.

I look young for my age. And 99% of the women didn’t mind my age when I told them the reason."
dating,fe91a3r,t3_eo1j05,1578933121.0,Man that sounds like a dream come true! Us guys  can’t really do it because “we come off as creepy”. But if a cute woman approached me and asked to swap numbers I’d be so happy!

Screenwriting,fdeq1uo,t1_fdepun5,1578344230.0,"I definitely don’t work with the ideas if I’m not satisfied with them. If they are not good enough then I keep putting down ideas until there’s something I’m satisfied with.

What are some things happening in the world that movies have not been made about? What films have been nominated for Academy Awards? What trends or relevant topic is facing people currently? 

What genre do you want to write about? Watch movies in that genre to spark some ideas."
Screenwriting,fdenhqd,t1_fdenb9n,1578342735.0,"Absolutely, brainstorming is great, I love using a whiteboard sometimes to just write out some ideas. And if you have an iPhone, using Siri to talk to a notepad is also great, as you can just kind of walk around the room spitting out ideas. I do that all the time."

Screenwriting,fdeixo2,t1_fdeh5yp,1578340008.0,"Well that’s a lot tougher to diagnose. That’s the kind of thing you have to do research on. These are the types of things you get from watching movies, reading screenplays, books, learning about different topics online, etc.

Do you have a peer group that you bounce ideas around with?

There’s a good sub Reddit called movie ideas that you can probably put some of your ideas on."
Screenwriting,fdeg5kb,t1_fdeg1ei,1578338303.0,"So honestly, the best way to figure out if a scene works is if it fits on your 40 card board. If it doesn’t fit or if you’re missing something, that’s where you’ll figure it out.

There are four acts. Act 1, Act 2, Act 2 after the midpoint, and Act 3. Each act gets 10 cards / scenes.

Now when it comes to shorts, that’s going to have a different structure but it will still have a beginning, middle and an end. Still needs a theme, character development, and story, etc."
Screenwriting,fdeamwy,t1_fdeakfo,1578334855.0,Yes that’s right. Outline. Logline. Title. Beat sheet. 40 scenes in cards. Then screenplay.

Screenwriting,fddu04q,t3_ektldy,1578323940.0,"I watch movies all the time whilst studying them. The trick is to not focus so much on writing because you watched movies.  Use them to your advantage. Find out what you like and don’t like.

I’ve had Hollywood producers read my scripts and tell me how original and unique my writing style was, the way I introduced characters, my pacing, and unexpected twists that I used that they  had never read before. 

That comes from all of the movies that I’ve watched - avoiding all of the things I hated about them, and incorporating things I loved about them.

Now when it comes to writing, there’s definitely a process. At least for me there is. First I start with a simple outline. Then I come up with a title and logline. 

Next up is a beat sheet. Then I write out the 40 scenes on cards for my magnetic white board. More recently thanks to a redditor, I use his new and free platform [PlotDash](https://www.PlotDash.com) to write out my scenes. 

Once I’m done writing out everything, I review it extensively. Fix any holes or issues. And then begin writing my screenplay.

My goal is always to write 1-2 scenes (2-5 pages) per day. If the writing gods have granted me inspiration, I can sometimes write up to 5 scenes per day. I’ve written entire first draft 100 page screenplays in 2 1/2 weeks. 

The key is to set yourself up with little goals, one scene per day or a couple scenes per week. And then before you know it in a couple of weeks or months you will have a screenplay complete!"
datingoverthirty,fdaixc9,t3_ek4zh9,1578246561.0,"This is definitely an epidemic. I’ve been on OLD apps for a very long time and I’ve noticed a large percentage of women either giving out their IG, asking for cash via Venmo or some other app, they are a straight up sex bot, or of course don’t respond to your messages. 

The worst part about this “DM me on IG” situation, is that 9 times out of 10, their profiles are private so you can’t even see their pictures before messaging them."
datingoverforty,fd3sh7t,t1_fd3pwo4,1578161306.0,"It’s possible that it’s age related, but also app fatigue has become a thing in the past 10 years. More and more people are deleting apps because of privacy issues, but also because technology has made people less social.

I think ultimately having somebody’s phone number and being able to text and call them makes it more personal."

datingoverforty,fd3l0e9,t3_ejxtog,1578159295.0,"Some of the reasons I like to ask a woman for her phone number, especially using OLD apps are:

- to confirm they are not a bot 
- to be able to text easier and see if they read my messages (if they have read receipts on)
- to be able to share things a little easier, links, videos, pictures, and have a record of it.
- I don’t use Snapchat
- there are some advantages to using iMessage (assuming the other person has an iPhone)
- maybe we can FaceTime or call each other after texting a bit
- giving me your number tells me you’re serious about meeting/dating"

Screenwriting,fcyox11,t1_fcwx7o6,1578084127.0,"Hey! Awesome, I just tried it out and it worked. I saved it as a PDF and it puts two cards per page. A lot bigger than index cards so I'll probably just put the PDF into photoshop and convert the cards into images and fit them into smaller cards so that I can print out at least 6 per page. This way I can put them up on my white board with small magnets and fit 10 per row. I think this will work, I'll let you know how it goes. Thanks for adding yet another useful feature!"

AskReddit,fcqdkmw,t3_eic8yl,1577883882.0,"I had just bought my house a year before that, wrapped my first movie, and started to take my technology business seriously. A few years later I had written a book about my experience, made a documentary, and had a couple of failed startups. 

I wasted so much time making mistakes. Which of course gave me a lot of fuel for my book, my online course, my podcast, my YouTube channel, and a lot of other things, such as teaching at Ivy League universities. 

There are so many things I would do if I could go back to 2011. First I would avoid certain people who I worked with. Second, I would not waste time on a couple of startups. Third, I would not have sold my cryptocurrency as early as I did. Fourth, I would start all of my projects that succeeded much sooner. Fifth, I probably would have sold my house and purchased one in a location that went up in value a hell of a lot in the past 10 years. Lastly, I would’ve probably stayed with one of my ex-girlfriend’s and started a family with her."
