depression,fendz0r,t3_epzjky,1579282640.0,"I am /was in the same spot as you. My dream was my career, finding a GF who has her shit together, earn a certain amount of money, move to the city of my dreams, go on fabulous vacations, and so on. I thought, when I achieve all of this, my suffering will end.

  
**Plot Twist:** It didn't. It just showed me that the void inside myself is a bottomless pit that nothing from the outside world can fix. I probably never felt worse. Here I was, with everything I ever wanted, but all I could think of was lying down and crying till the world stops spinning.

  
However, after a couple of months of crushing misery, I began seeing the beauty in the pain. Realizing that all that I had was irrelevant to my suffering was a necessary step to see what truly mattered to me (pursuing creativity, expressing myself, forming meaningful connections) and that I needed to wrestle with my void **on my own.**

  
**NOTE:** With ""on my own"" I don't mean ""alone."" All it means is that I can't bank on outside success to fight my void. I need to utilize what's already in me. And how do I do this? With the help of a therapist, with friends, I trust and by living a life I feel is worth living.  
You may find it hard to relate to this idea right now, but maybe it will be different in a couple of months. 

  
You asked what's wrong with you, let me explain:

  
You struggle with depression since you're 12, but you still managed to get your shit together by taking care of your body, mind, vices, and social connections even though (I assume) you wanted to stay in bed most of the time. 

  
*The only thing wrong with you is that you're one extraordinary strong motherfucker!*

  
**You didn't ask for advice, so ignore this if you don't want to hear it:** You should see a therapist and talk to friends about your struggles. Thinking that you're weak for seeking help may feel like it's your own thought, but it actually isn't. It's just your depression playing mind tricks on you. Don' let it trick you."
depression,fenarwa,t3_epxpfw,1579280680.0,"The problem is not that your mom doesn't understand depression, but that she doesn't understand that you are suffering. Nobody needs to understand a disease to empathize with a victim of it. I  don't understand how cancer works, but it still breaks my heart, seeing people going through chemo. 

  
This is just speculation, but from my history, I suspect that the cruel comment your mother made does not mean ""get your shit together you weak idiot,"" but more ""YOU CAN'T BE DEPRESSED BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE DEPRESSED, IT MEANS THAT'S MY FAULT, AND I DID MY BEST TO BE A GOOD MOTHER."" 

  
You also didn't ask for advice, but my mother said the same thing to me, and I wished to act differently, so here it is: Tell her that it's not her fault but that you need her support. If she can't give you the support you need, cut her out of your life. Emotionally or physically. That's some tough shit, but if you're not taking care of yourself, nobody will. 

  
If she's interested in getting the perspective of a depressed person, you can show her Babadook ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5WQZzDRVtw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5WQZzDRVtw)). It's a horror movie, but the monster is nothing more than a metaphor for the depression of the female protagonist. 

  
There is also a book called **Noonday Demon** by  Andrew Solomon. I haven't read it, but it has been recommended by people I trust enough to recommend it to somebody else blindly."

Statt zu sehen, dass OP ein Mensch ist, der vermutlich noch nie eine öffentliche Konfrontation erlebt hat und ihm/ ihr hilfreiche Tipps zu geben, wie er/ sie durch in dieser Situation durch die urmenschlichen Blockaden brechen und reagieren kann, hast du ihn/ sie einfach mit einem zynischen Kommentar angegriffen. 

Herzlichen Glückwunsch, statt der Gesellschaft zu helfen, zu wachsen und füreinander einzustehen, sodass solche Vorfälle seltener passieren und Menschen, egal welcher Hautfarbe , Sexualität oder Religion, endlich in Frieden in Mitten unserer aggressiven Gesellschaft leben können, hast du dich entschieden, anzugreifen. 

Menschen die in solchen Fällen nicht reagieren, tun es nicht weil sie folgsame Deutsche sind, sondern weil sie nicht wissen wie."
