It won't fly up everywhere when dropped in the freefall method. Also take in consideration that this is a drill where there are max 3-4 people on board. Look how all the rest of the crew is still on the ship. In a real situstion the weight eberybody is enough to not make the lifeboat bounce back like it did in this situation. I did twice this test and on board the lifeboat, and it's really not as bad as it looks. Even i who have a phobia of heights. Though 90% the time the fall is much smoother than what hapened in this gif, i'm sure they're all safe except for having vomit sticking to their faces."

Unexpected,feov1dk,t1_feorv5e,1579306028.0,Yeah that's pretty sad but thats the consequences of being reputated for a shit tons of mocking stereotypes 10 years and more ago. Remember the ching chang chong face figure? Or the arabs bombs jokes? About how blonds were all stupid? Mongols being a synonym for autism? None of these jokes are still popular nowadays but the memory is still there. Gotta wait some decades ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

todayilearned,fecikyf,t1_fecd1jp,1578974793.0,I went to Sydney once and coworkers joked about the bad reputationnof the city being full of gay rapists that will put drug pills in your drink if you're a male. It was absolutely absurd but i didn't spend enough time to analyze it but for sure the coast of the maritimes is magical. The coast of St-john's in NL was the best that i have ever seen.
todayilearned,fec9chw,t1_fec7zwr,1578968962.0,Haha personally the cultural aspect is not that big of a deal. Actually in Quebec a lot of people dream of traveling on BC. It's loved for the rockies and the cheap weed online stores. But the distance and price of everything over there is what back people from going there. Domestic plane peices are stupid in Canda and buying an all-included resort+plane ticket in Cuba for a week is less expensive than the simple plane ticket to Vancouver.
todayilearned,fec8k0w,t1_febwo8k,1578968530.0,"If you are <1km from the coast the amount of mosquitoes is actually bearable. I was hiking for a little bit once in Deception Bay which is in the northern coast of Quebec and i've heard a mosquito which was like 3 fucking inches thick and the sound it produced was so deep i leggit thought at first it was an helicopter and looked up in the sky. When i saw that black orb making 8 figures in the air i got the fucking chills and runned for my life. Over there mosquitoes won't stink you, they'll fucking stab you and pump your blood like a fat chick drinking a coke."
todayilearned,fec7ey4,t1_fec6ovl,1578967943.0,"Yeah but BC is recognized to be California levels of expensive housing. It's hard to decide between having good weather, but quitting all your relatives and living in a cheap appartment vs having a home where you grown."
trees,fec6b9r,t1_feannkz,1578967362.0,"It's not that delicious food is necessarily bad for your health. It's that cheaply flavored food that is available in most cheap restaurents and cheap grocery store products are bad. Tons of either sugar, fat or salt. If you take the time to buy raw ingredients yourself it's perfectly possible to eat healthy and relatively good and cheap at home. 

It can only take 15 minutes to make sauteed brocolis with chopped garlic, a sane amount of salt and some droplets of sesame oil(it may seems expensive in the store but the perfume is incredibly strong and a few amount is necessary for cooking, it can last a long time). Eat it with crushed peanuts and instant noodles and you got one heck of a asian plate! The only difference with the restaurent is that YOU control the ingredients quantities, you can try new sauces or veggies everytime to find the perfect spot, and you can make a much bigger quantity for the same price. Going to the restaurant and coming back is honestly the same time taken as preparing it yourself, if you're pro-active.

Experimenting this kind of shit when you're high is also fun, i always try new shit and fail like half the time but food is still food and coming from your own art is worth much more than driving 10 mins to buy 5 chicken juniors and think about your life choices just like when you finish masturbating. Enjoying your own made high quality(i didn't said expensive!) plate and washing your dishes with good music before the high goes away and its the equivalent of being proud after a wild sex session."

Showerthoughts,fdrio36,t1_fdqz6kp,1578685110.0,The true vegan burger is just mashed beans with somes spices and flour to make it keep it's shape. I don't understand why there are 36 sifferent ingredients in beyond meat burgers and a fuck ton of salt.
OnePiece,fdmgf7f,t1_fdlbik3,1578549034.0,You saw how luffy worked the fuckest most he has ever did against katakuri? He was constantly smacked on the whole fight. That's also a good characteristic of pre-TS luffy when he managed 3 rounds against Crocodile and the epic duel he had with Lucci. Don krieg was one of the longest fights of the series which was so early in the series. It was just luffy not stopping at every dirty tactic from him. Luffy has always fighted in a way where he is completely fuled by perseverance.
