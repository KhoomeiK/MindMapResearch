are u native too? my doctor says it’s more easier for us to gain weight and harder to lose weight because our body isn’t used to all the processed food and the generic stuff they put in food. that’s partially why the diabetic rate is so high for natives."
todayilearned,ffyfe5q,t1_ffycjro,1580345111.0,"Wow, that made me love her even more."
AskWomen,ffyeo10,t1_ffxncnt,1580344616.0,"We didn’t. We nagged about the health risks and just how gross it was. (She never smoked in the house  but the stench was still everywhere) Whatever we did or say never worked. 

She just couldn’t afford to fund her cigarette addiction anymore. I think it brought shame to her to have to ask my grandma for money because it was either pay for all your cigarettes or have enough money for bills, groceries etc. (She’s on disability and can’t work.) But literally a few weeks into quitting she already had so much more energy and her voice sounded better and a lot of things she convinced us and herself were not because of her smoking instantly stopped. And now we can go to dinner or see a movie without her leaving every 10 minutes just to smoke. So i think those things is what made her not start smoking again."
AskWomen,ffyboxo,t1_ffvg66s,1580342615.0,"you can’t be too hard on yourself because i’m sure people didn’t know much about teeth that they do now. that goes for the skincare too. 

i had a terrible diet during the time i had braces and i just realized awhile ago that my teeth yellowed a lot. luckily no one can really notice it but i definitely can. it’s like i traded my white pearls for straight teeth lmao"
Dentistry,ffvzx1y,t3_evhxka,1580278714.0,"I don’t think it’s more than usual because my sister was making payments on her root canal forever. 

I don’t know about the crown, sorry."
AmItheAsshole,ffvnx20,t1_ffv5qce,1580268589.0,"Yeah, based on his wording it definitely seems like he kinda looks down on her because he has kids and she doesn’t. Maybe she can sense that? It definitely doesn’t excuse her shitty snide comments but I don’t think OP is 100% innocent either,"
AmItheAsshole,ffvnlkl,t3_evbyg8,1580268369.0,"ESH

You were being petty. You never mentioned that you ever actually spoke to her in a mature manner and told her how inappropriate these comments were and you would appreciate if she didn’t make them anymore. if you did and she still made shitty comments about your kid, she would be the only asshole here."
insaneparents,ffvjf67,t1_ffuilyj,1580265531.0,Yeah no one should be praised for simply taking care of their child. It’s just expected.
AskWomen,ffvddas,t1_ffv72ti,1580261469.0,"My mother takes ton of medication, and along with her chain smoking since she was 14 (she only quit a few years ago) her teeth are in horrible shape. It definitely made me start taking better care of my teeth."
AskWomen,ffvcvpl,t3_evfa4q,1580261141.0,"We usually didnt fight at all but there was like a month period where we fought a lot. Her friends would text me or call me regarding our fights and it was like instead of fighting with just one person, it was all her friends and her against me. I  don’t mind her going to vent to her friends but it’s not their business especially how personal some of the stuff was. I didn’t want my dirty laundry constantly out there with these random people even if they may be my gf’s friends so i broke up with her."
Wellthatsucks,ffuhtxv,t3_ev5xy9,1580242258.0,"Kids are so fucking funny and smarter than people realize. 

That’s what bugs me when anyone tells a funny story about their kids, and everyone comments like “i’m sure that happened.” Like it probably did happen because kids are hilarious"
unpopularopinion,ffudqzx,t1_fftaai9,1580239821.0,"What annoys me is the hypocrisy in it all. 

They accuse women of generalizing all men and go on their “not at all men” rant. A woman then comes to defend herself and the man immediately generalizes her with all women. like ???"
unpopularopinion,ffud5de,t1_fftm2br,1580239462.0,Yeah “fat people = bad” isn’t unpopular opinion at all considering i see the same thing being said just worded differently every day.
AskReddit,fftdg38,t3_euv96i,1580217272.0,"I’m pretty sure I’ve been depressed since I was able to have coherent thoughts. 

I was mute as a kid, I would speak but was very selective and just chose not to talk. I also lived with my mom half my childhood who was bipolar and wanted to isolate me because she literally thought everyone was out to kill her. The police would take me away to my grandma’s whenever she was a threat to herself or me, thank god. But I had no social interaction with anyone when I lived with her because she would just sleep all day. 

My sister said I cried myself to sleep every night at my grandma’s. I had no social skills due to the isolation so I never wanted to play with other kids and when I did it was always awkward. I was irritable, and so mean to my grandmother who was my only real mother figure at the time. 

I never really got help professionally until I was way older and attempted suicide. I kinda wish someone just brought me in to see a therapist but looking back everyone was going through their own shit and trying their best."
AskReddit,fftaxg6,t3_euzl8h,1580214878.0,"Movie is contracted. 

I was bored in the middle of the night and watched some zombie b movie on netflix. Basically a girl is slowly turning into a zombie. In one scene, her eyeball literally falls out and it was such a minor scene but it freaks me out so much."
dogswithjobs,fft3zsz,t1_fft31db,1580205881.0,"I feel lucky because I’ve had the same one forever and he’s really good. The cost of going to the vet in my area is one the highest in my country though, so that sucks."
dogswithjobs,fft3u9t,t1_fft16i2,1580205643.0,"You must be exhausted from reaching that hard. 

I never said that vets shouldnt be questioned. I do agree that OP should get a second opinion if they feel like something isn’t right. But they should get the information from an actual vet, not just a vet tech, because a vet  is more qualified? I don’t know what you’re trying to prove by pulling out fake scenarios that aren’t relevant. 

And questioning someone’s credentials in a world where the internet is full of people who suddenly have medical degrees or are all doctors is not unreasonable."
DoesAnybodyElse,fft1md7,t1_ffr0rta,1580202209.0,My grandma is  70 and most of her colleagues are in their 50’s at the least. There’s still lots of petty drama and fights. It definitely doesn’t end after high school like I assumed
dogswithjobs,ffsyq64,t1_ffsyfxx,1580198141.0,"It’s just kinda weird they’re questioning actual veterinarians who went to school for a long time and are experienced. I agree not every veterinarian is gonna be up to date and know everything but I think most do 

but i agree it never hurts to get a second opinion."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffsyaky,t1_ffsxvau,1580197580.0,lol thanks
dogswithjobs,ffsxprp,t1_ffsv0p4,1580196842.0,And what’s your degree in?
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffswe58,t1_ffsrd7c,1580195179.0,"Ew, I’m glad he’s an ex then. Most of the time it has nothing to do with the girl and it’s just their own insecurity and old fashioned  thinking that they have get a say about whether their girl wants to wear a short skirt or no bra underneath her shirt."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffsw9nm,t1_ffslk8y,1580195026.0,"Yeah I would never do this because I have big boobs and they sag if I don’t wear a bra. I read that’s quite normal for natural big breasts but i’m still quite insecure about it and not ready for everyone to see that.

edit: My messages are now filled with guys wanting to fuck after this comment so uh cool?"
HumansBeingBros,ffsvtrs,t3_euzm0m,1580194499.0,This blows my mind. I live in Canada and all the insulin cost is covered by insurance. My mom is a diabetic and I’m just so thankful that we don’t have to pay outrageous cost just for her to survive.
AskReddit,ffq7p1m,t1_ffptr20,1580124832.0,"Holy shit. I’m glad he’s an ex, then."
