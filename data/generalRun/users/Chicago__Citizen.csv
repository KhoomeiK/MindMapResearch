I know there is this stigma on reddit against suggesting non-chemical ways to deal with sadness but I mean it.  Your body is a tool waiting to be used, it will reward you mightily for using it more than is barely necessary if you try.  Even walking a few blocks when you feel down can be therapeutic.
