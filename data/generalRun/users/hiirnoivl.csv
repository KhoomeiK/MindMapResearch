No I didn't translate anything for fear of spoiling myself on the main story. Instead, I used the official website information and imagined from there, and I asked questions of Rabbie and others if I thought maybe something might conflict with the official lore.

Thank you for reading! ðŸ¥°"

WritingPrompts,fdidevf,t3_elbe2s,1578440376.0," *I could feel my chest heaving. This single email, the only human communication I'd received in a week. I didn't know what I was feeling, a new human emotion that was driven by desperation, rooted in grief and fear, while being brightened by hope and shadowed by doubt.  This feeling carried me as I click the link, which took me back to my single comment. 'Last'. I'd given up hope of finding anyone else in that moment but maybe I was wrong.  Or, said the doubting shadow, this was simply the last gasp of an algorithm that didn't know how to behave in a vacuum. If there was only one person to comment, maybe, in its neural networking logic, it figured that it must become the person to like and subscribe. The thought drew a simple laugh out of me.  I stare at the like. No, it's like, comment and subscribe.  I reply to my own comment. ""Like, comment and subscribe to my channel, if you're alive.""*"
