LegendsOfRuneterra,fftc9nx,t1_fftc3p1,1580216176.0,The pain is real. I didn't read properly and got confused when Aniva didn't revive next round for a board wipe.

LegendsOfRuneterra,fft0wjl,t3_ev1eqt,1580201143.0,"LoR is definitely a step up from HS in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate HS but I did just see a post where someone summons three Leeroys for free and won the game."

LegendsOfRuneterra,ffsvf2x,t3_euewz4,1580194017.0,I took your advice and put autopass back on. Needless to say the game went a lot smoother and quicker without having me forget to pass on my turn. You sir are a hero.
LegendsOfRuneterra,ffqggin,t3_eunvv8,1580133878.0,I like Braum right now if I'm honest.

LegendsOfRuneterra,ff9nf4y,t1_ff9c2gj,1579716648.0,"I'd be majorly bummed. But if they had to delay it for a bit more polish, I'd be ok with it.

That being said, thank fudge it isn't."
hearthstone,ff8n1ia,t1_ff8luqd,1579686732.0,That's why I'm hoping LoR is so good that it wakes those devs up.
hearthstone,ff8kj78,t1_ff8kg93,1579682878.0,Maybe they are waiting to see how it performs in open beta?

LegendsOfRuneterra,ff5eyg9,t3_erkz27,1579589969.0,"All aboard the hype train express! Now departing! 

Yes dude, super excited for the game. I can't remember the last time I was this eager for a game and I think what Riot has done with it is just awesome."

AskReddit,ff2u3nn,t3_ercok2,1579524222.0,It's okay to put yourself and your needs first sometimes.
southafrica,ff2l0pi,t1_ff2fkyq,1579511069.0,Yes but this far too efficient and cost saving for our country.
gaming,ff2djz7,t3_er2z1h,1579501786.0,Please make this into a legit game.
LegendsOfRuneterra,ff00b55,t1_feygc6a,1579463770.0,"What's going to be really cool is that everyone starts the game at the same time (give or take certain time zones or whatever). So everyone will be on the same level for a bit, there won't be any massive super power decks or colosal card collections."

southafrica,femb0f7,t3_eptmo4,1579246643.0,Good. It's selfish drivers like this that ruin driving for everyone else. Just chill in your lane bro.
gaming,fem8hr8,t3_epmk42,1579243607.0,I'm really glad about this actually. I'd rather they make sure of everything before release instead of putting out a broken and rushed game like so many other studios. Kudos CDPR. More companies need to be like this.
hearthstone,fem7lne,t3_epmo45,1579242642.0,"At first I read ""Pirate with Rush."""

LegendsOfRuneterra,fem6pwi,t1_fekdtlh,1579241707.0,Right? He just plays the game a misses around with off meta combos. I love anything off meta. I also love how giddish he gets when he pulls off a sick combo. Just plain good fun.
hearthstone,fejsrn4,t3_epjp1f,1579184952.0,I just wish the timer stopped when you closed the game.
FallOutBoy,fejcvpv,t3_epgzsy,1579167734.0,I would love it if the band covered this song. It's the best song on the album.

FallOutBoy,fefzu58,t3_eorz57,1579070976.0,So it seems that everyone hates the red AB/AP album. I've never heard it before so I think I'll avoid it.

TeamfightTactics,fe70v0w,t1_fe6zdda,1578908494.0,"I've never had the good fortune to try either of them to be honest. I think both builds are be good in their own right. An assassin Olaf could pretty much mow down any long range carries.

Maybe blademaster will be better considering you already have Renekton for the berserk and Sivir for the blademaster and that all also adds to the desert comp."
southafrica,fe6ufxq,t3_eo0ah2,1578905490.0,She is crazy but she isn't wrong. That guy is a hate speech spouting machine but nothing ever gets done about it.
