I know an adult pedophile, and he said violence and rape are the most terrible things he could imagine.

He didn't dare to go to therapy, and said he wouldn't have problems with it either, since he was satisfied with, yes i know, loli hentai.

He said he didn't hurt anyone with that, and therefore he wouldn't be a danger to anyone.

I'm sorry for any pedophile, and i hope that they accomplish to recist their sexuality and life a happy life as a functioning member of society.

And btw i agreed with him, if your a pedophile and you fell an inevitable urge to life it out, maybe this is the best way to deal with it.

I found that there was someone saying 65mp/h at clear and 64mp/h at foggy days, which seems rediculous because air density and humidity are probably the smallest variables in the equasion. Much more important factors would be the drag coefficient the area that stands against the air, the density, the mass and the angle that it falls in.

For any generically formulated equasion the range of +-1mp/h seems rediculously small to me.

Give me the source so i can judge i can judge it.

I read that the terminal velocity of a pen would be 200mp/h (all these factors above can be normed in that case), but a pen is much denser, has a better drag coefficient and barely any area when falling straight."

If you decide to continue trying i'd recommend the following: Proceed slowly, maybe try being friends with benefits or something like that shit, but at abdolutely no cost, pretend that you wouldn't be in love with her.

If she then still, even with a slow approach, doesn't want to be with you, you should distancr yourself. But generally, for example in this story i was talking about, it all started with something like a kiss on a party, then there was nothing but good times and hanging out, then they started being friends with benefits and then they got together.

But you shouldn't pretend like the 'FwB' thing was just a friend thing - but rather just a test phase for a relationship.

There were many different styles i heard the first part being played with alredy, in my personal opinion i like a bit of pedal on the first part, but there is no pedal on the sheet music, so you've got to decide whether you either want to play the piece as accurately as possible to improve, or to implement your own touch, for a nicer sound.
