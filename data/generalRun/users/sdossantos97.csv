Adulting,ff2zi53,t3_eqy01b,1579529547.0,"I’ve been getting my glasses from zenni, most recently I got my newest ones from firmoo.com. like everyone said, know the distance between your pupils and your prescription and you’re good to go! 

I actually ordered glasses from firmoo that were too small for my face, so I contacted customer service and they allowed me to exchange them so long as I pay shipping! I definitely recommend firmoo, I personally think they have cuter frames, but I will always trust zenni too!"
