Beastars,fdc8idv,t3_ekdfit,1578269179.0,This reminds me of those old Problem Sleuth comics...
GetMotivated,fc7cjow,t1_fc74i56,1577503454.0,"That much is probably true, but back then, steady labor with pay and occasional festivals were about as good as you could hope for a commoner."
GetMotivated,fc72u6f,t1_fc59gjv,1577496043.0,"Well, those that died during the construction (which I assume were many given how long the project ran for) were buried in a tomb right next to the damn pyramids themselves, so I'd say within their society, they got some pretty huge honors ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/11/great-pyramid-tombs-slaves-egypt))"
GetMotivated,fc72mjf,t1_fc6kure,1577495884.0,"FYI, it's no longer believed that the pyramids were built by slaves. Rather, they were built by paid, skilled workers who were buried with honors in a tomb next to the pyramids themselves ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/11/great-pyramid-tombs-slaves-egypt))."
GradSchool,fc6dppq,t1_fc55bdh,1577478143.0,"Hah, sure! I'm always happy to talk about this stuff. What's up? I will warn you that my practical experimental knowledge is quite a bit stronger than my theory."
GradSchool,fc4gtid,t3_efvkz5,1577416244.0,"No comment on the relationship thing, but one thing I've found tends to work is setting everything to light mode and then using the inverted color filter function. If you're really trying to be fancy, you could probably additionally use Autohotkey to tie the Alt-tab button to the color inversion combo (Windows+Ctrl+C) to swap between the two modes when you swap into the rest of your stuff that has sufficient dark mode."
gamedev,fc3ra7p,t3_efxijx,1577396634.0,Reminds me of Crypt of the Necrodancer. Looks good!
InterdimensionalCable,fay9s3q,t3_eavh95,1576397170.0,Definitely fits this sub. Love the callbacks for each character!
