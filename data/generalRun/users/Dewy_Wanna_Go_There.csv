It seems sort of implied that the murder you use to make the horcrux needs to be combined with some sort of spell/ritual, and that he already had done it by murdering his father and grandparents. I think Harry even mentions something like this in his head when he sees the ring. 

And I don’t think he ever claimed while in school that the ring was heirloom from their descendants (if slytherin) it was beaten and chipped and doesn’t match his character to boast about something so important he needs to later hide.
