Nowhere in an IEP does it say a student gets to be disruptive and/or disrespectful. What type of behavioral system does your school use? Do you have a SAT (student assessment team)? If a student with an IEP has significant behavioral problems that interfere with learning, the school is mandated to perform a FBA assessment to evaluate the motivating factors behind the student's behavior. After that is completed, the team will put together a BIP (behavior intervention plan). 

The special education teacher should also be working with you to set the academic goals for any student with an IEP, so you shouldn't be alone in that battle."

education,feyufnp,t1_fere1u3,1579450657.0,">The bright side is the federal government has very little impact on education because ""states rights"" or something.

This is actually not true. The Federal Government has enormous power over local schools due to the amount of funding they provide school districts, not to mention that IDEA, which is the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, is the one of the most powerful education law in existence.

For example, Obama passed an executive order through IDEA that penalized school districts if they have a disproportionate amount of suspension for black students with IEP's. This led to many schools refusing to suspend students, regardless of their actions, and blaming the schools and teachers for their behavior. Due to this, we have seen an exodus of highly trained teachers and other school staff leaving the profession, due to the fact that they are being emotionally and physically assaulted by students with no repercussions."

teaching,fdyfoqo,t3_enbflk,1578779288.0,">I love the idea of helping people grow and making an impact on their lives, and have always loved training people, but I don’t know if that’s reason enough to seriously consider teaching as a career choice. 

This is the best reason to consider teaching. The people who are able to gut it out year in and year out are the ones who are there for the kids, not just because they like the content or want the summers off.

My mother is a teacher, so I had a pretty good idea of what I was getting into. I really love helping kids succeed. I was also an EI kid in elementary, so having really stable adults at school was really helpful to me. I started teaching Social Studies in secondary, but recently switched to Special Ed, and was placed in Elementary.

I would do some serious investigating into how english is taught in elementary vs. secondary because they are very different. Teaching english in elementary means you are actually teaching them how to read, so breaking down and decoding words and sentences. Secondary means more intense reading and interacting with the text."

Teachers,fcy4843,t3_ejhonk,1578074482.0,"I've taught both elementary and secondary (middle and high school) as both a gen ed teacher and special ed teacher. In my experience, the stereotype that men get more ""respect"" is one that is enforced more by staff and administration rather than rooted in reality when it comes to how the kids actually act.

I was hired to take over a very unruly 5th grade class that had run off a previous long term sub under the context that the ""kids will respect a man more and do what they are told"". That was complete BS. The kids were already conditioned to act poorly so there was absolutely no change in their behavior until I implemented strict classroom management, and even then it was a battle.

Now, do I think female teachers are judged more harshly than male teachers by other staff members when it comes to their students behavior? Absolutely. But in the elementary setting, men are in the minority, so they are given more leeway."
AskMen,fcngs2c,t3_ehxbn5,1577811391.0,"I think there is two factors why men struggle with emotion in the eyes of women. 

1. The first being that the spectrum of what emotions are ""allowed"" for men to express in front of women is very small. For example, it is acceptable for a man to react with anger in response to stress, but not with fear. Anger really covers up many different emotions in men, and is viewed as more socially acceptable in the eyes of women (I am using generalities of course). This is due to the idea that if a man reacts fearfully or with sadness, the woman he is with will feel less secure, reducing the possibility that she will become a mate. I don't think this is always a conscious choice, it seems to be a subconscious drive of the male instinct.  
2. The other factor is that the safe places for men to show other emotions outside of anger are few and far between, and have been reduced as we have become a more integrated society gender wise. Many women assume that ""guys night out"" is drunken debauchery, but in many cases is the opportunity for men to talk to other men about issues and emotions they are going through. There is a really good book called ""Self Made Man"" written by Norah Vincent. In the book, Norah impersonates being a man to infiltrate the ""boys club"", and in many cases is shocked how open her guy friends are when there are no women around. They talk openly about their fears, how much they love their wives, etc.

I think many women assume that because men don't talk about ""taboo"" feelings in front of them, that they don't exist. Men are aware of this, and it reduces the opportunity for them to talk openly in front of women."

This sounds like a broad term made up at your grad school tbh. I will add in also since you are starting your student teaching that you need to be very, *very* careful about how you are teaching social studies since your job is to teach the curriculum as it is designed, not your own spin on it. You will have to find the spots in the curriculum where you have wiggle room to introduce your own content (like book reports, group work, etc.)."
