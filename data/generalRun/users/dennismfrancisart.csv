PoliticalHumor,fh8goga,t1_fh8bluk,1581359344.0,"Truth be told, they never have. Dwight Eisenhower was the last Republican president to preside over a balanced budget with good overall economic numbers. He worked with a Democratic House.

""Eisenhower's interest in balancing the budget and paying down the national debt led to his refusal to apply the tax cuts that many across the nation wanted. And there was the issue of economic stability. Under Eisenhower's eight years in office, the economy chugged along with an average annual growth rate of 2.4 percent – less than the 4 percent average growth rate during the Truman years."""

They do find ways however to profit from it for their donors.  **Medicare** is **funded** by the Social Security Administration. Which means it's **funded** by taxpayers: We all pay 1.45% of our earnings into FICA - Federal Insurance Contributions Act, if you're into deciphering acronyms - which go toward **Medicare**. Employers pay another 1.45%, bringing the total to 2.9%. 

Medicaid is what they love to screw with because of how it's funded and by who. **Medicaid** is **funded** by the federal government and each state. The federal government pays states for a share of program expenditures, called the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). Each state has its own FMAP based on per capita income and other criteria. The bitter irony is that many of Trump's base need both to survive."

Trump is feeling pretty brazen and the anti-Trump GOP are really worried for the party's longevity right now. Trump's overall approval rating has not really moved past the base. McConnell has been dangling the purse strings to keep the House and Senate members in line, but they see this as a dangerous and unsustainable strategy for party growth.

She picked some guy that looked like a sitcom extra. Bringing massive voter turnout is key to counter the GOP gerrymandering, election tampering and voter suppression that they are so good at.
