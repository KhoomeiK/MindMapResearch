todayilearned,fgbr9pk,t1_fgbojqc,1580665330.0,"Sorry I didn’t make that clearer. The names of the letters also give you the pronunciation:

æ – the ‘a’ in ash

þ – the ‘th’ in thorn

ð – the ‘th’ in eth (or feather for a more common example)

Note:

> Thorn and eth are used interchangeably to represent both voiced and unvoiced ""th"" sounds (the sound at the beginning of ""the"" is voiced; the sound at the end of ""with"" is unvoiced).

https://people.umass.edu/sharris/in/gram/GrammarBook/orthography.html

So my hope of disambiguating voiceless versus voiced versions of ‘th’ with these was not realistic after looking into it more."
todayilearned,fgbhzut,t1_fgbchgf,1580662282.0,"Cool!  Thanks for letting me know about that one. I did a search on the text and didn’t find any either. Probably since this text uses ‘w’ it doesn’t use the *wynn* letter. 

I’m not sure what the rules are for transcribing OE into modern glyphs so it may used in other texts."

And these are sounds still in modern English and reflected in the letter names themselves. It makes it less strange to attempt reading Old English once you at least know all the letters. 

I wish we still used the thorn and eth characters since it is less ambiguous than ‘th’"
