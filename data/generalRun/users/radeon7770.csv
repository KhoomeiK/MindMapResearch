DecidingToBeBetter,fexqj22,t3_eqq7bg,1579434735.0,"I've done something similar, I went one week without access to the internet or gaming. I spent most of my free time reading both fiction and nonfiction books, exercising and playing with my dog. I noticed it felt like time was passing by at a slower rate, also by the end of the week my craving for irrelevant content on Reddit and YouTube had faded. I no longer watch boring videos for the sake of watching them, or browse stupid subreddits."

MostBeautiful,fd1gt59,t1_fcqjla9,1578131204.0,"Can't believe there's a sub for something I've always hated ever since I started using the internet, I can't stand when someone takes a cool picture of something and then there is a person far away (usually at the center for dramatic effect) to ruin the whole thing."
AskReddit,fczbla8,t1_fcz972h,1578097630.0,That's my favourite short story ever.
DecidingToBeBetter,fcxj26a,t3_ejfodd,1578064163.0,"I'm no professional but the human brain was not made to concentrate for such a long period of time, you get to work at 9am and want to work till nearly 10pm. I wake up at 5am to study and work on my business (which is far more important that working for someone else), then I go to my regular job. Maybe you could use the same routine? You'll still be working the same amount of time but at least you will have a clear mind to get work done."

selfimprovement,fcm9629,t3_ehuq6n,1577767602.0,"The first thing I thought was ""loads of money"" but in reality I just wanted to live in a stable environment again, where no one hated each other or fought for no reason."
selfimprovement,fcarq7l,t3_eguszh,1577575322.0,"Unpopular opinion: you SHOULD be worried about money because without it you can't live comfortably unless you're fine with living in the woods or something (which is ok too). We live in a capitalist society so you do need money to survive, you say deep down you already have everything you need but what if any of your relatives get really ill, would you like being unable to help them? IMO not worrying about money is an excuse for mediocrity, just don't be obsessed to the point that you ruin your life or your health because of money."
selfimprovement,fbsyho4,t3_ee90vf,1577063573.0,"Abstain yourself from the internet for a while, or at least from unproductive websites. It's funny, when I was younger I didn't know about Reddit or the endless rabbit holes on YouTube, I also didn't own a smartphone. Back then I could focus on a technical book for nearly an hour and understand what I was reading, nowadays there's too much information everywhere and I can't focus unless I abstain myself from electronics. I know it's nearly impossible if you actually need the internet to get work done but it's effective."
