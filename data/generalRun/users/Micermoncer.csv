Also I may be wrong but I think it's just the green parts specifically so providing you cut the new buds off and get rid of any green bits around it, it's probably fine."
TumblrInAction,fexye36,t3_eqrnht,1579438279.0,Artificial diversity is absolutely pointless.

technology,fddwk7g,t1_fddvsq1,1578325729.0,"You don’t sound aggressive at all and this argument hasn’t been completely useless. I still hold mostly the same opinion over Apple and still find them to be a overtly greedy company but scouting through articles it seems they have made attempts/are making attempts at improving their positions behind the scenes. 

However I do think people massively overestimate production costs. The extra little bits/packaging etc. Probably cost less than a penny each to produce. 

Their overall profit margins as a company have been going down from 40% since September 2015 and while only marginally going down they are continuing to go down. 

I don’t think I can forgive Apple yet though for their historically bad treatment of employees, only time will really tell I suppose."
technology,fddv4vz,t1_fddukkl,1578324738.0,"Had a look and the amount Apple pay Foxconn doesn’t seem to be anywhere, your more than welcome to try but I genuinely can’t find any further info on that. 

Also don’t forget we’re arguing about individual iPhone costs, so it would very heavily depends on how many IPhone are produced by how many workers over a space of time. 

A number I really have trouble imagining fills the very large gap between production costs vs consumer prices."

technology,fddtvdv,t1_fddtor3,1578323844.0,I could very easily be wrong. Just basing this of various articles I could scrape together. Struggling to find any information on individual operator costs via Foxconn for the production of iPhone.
technology,fddspdj,t1_fddscvi,1578322992.0,"But as I said while it does seem component costs are going up, so are the customer prices which leaves their profit margins unchanged. 

History manufacturing has never cost more than $10 so I can’t imagine it being much higher than that."
technology,fdds54o,t1_fddrsqz,1578322568.0,"But judging by those numbers the consumer price for the iPhone has also gone up by about £400 maintaining their usual profit margins. 

Also I get what you’re saying but I don’t think development really counts for much in the price of the product. Can’t imagine the price for development being that much out of the price for an iPhone."
technology,fddrgst,t1_fddqzvl,1578322047.0,"Where did you get that number from. It’s costs them about 200 to make give or take based on plus or not etc. 

Any sources to say they costs 700 to produce?

Edit: most sites agree that the IPhone 5,6,7 cost about £170 in components and costs about £4 to manufacture. 

Couldn’t find much on the newer iPhones but I find it hard to imagine the margins would be much different."
technology,fddqpng,t1_fddqbi5,1578321452.0,Maybe Apple shouldn’t be so greedy with their profit margins.
technology,fddqlnb,t3_eku1eh,1578321360.0,Can’t say I disagree with much of anything he said. Starting to get really annoyed by all the London and Hollywood Lovies.
