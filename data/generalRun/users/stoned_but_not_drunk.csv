relationship_advice,ffox2im,t1_ffo4tij,1580082841.0,"How long was he abstinent from weed? Tolerance resets for a true seasoned stoner after 90 days. He should be able to “baby” his way back into smoking. He doesn’t need a full bowl/joint, just a few rips to actually enjoy it."
relationship_advice,ffowvl8,t1_ffo4tij,1580082752.0,"It’s pretty easy if you use it as a reward system. I was a burnout for awhile. Even when I have nothing going on genuinely I feel like a burnout when I smoke up in the morning. 

If you have the tolerance and ambition you can honesty be high for a good amount of things. I worked at an upscale restaurant and...cannabis really vibes with cooking so showing up a little high was alright if you could handle it. 

Everyone is different. Even though it doesn’t really effect me for most things I feel like a crackhead whenever I light up right after I wake up.

Even though cannabis is more AM friendly then alcohol doesn’t mean you should do it. Wake and bakes are more fun if you do them once a week, not everyday. 

I don’t know if weeds your cup of tea but if he is genuine and holds off cannabis for an appropriate amount of time until say Friday. You guys can have a fun Friday night, get a little high together, and enjoy each other’s company. 

Kinda like team building it’s like a bonding experience. Cannabis makes intimacy more fun for both males and females. It will drive into his head that maybe doing it more seldom is worth it. 

Even in the stoner community no one likes a burnout. If all cannabis does is make him want Cheetos and to game out whenever he does it maybe it’s more of a after work-all obligations done activity."
relationship_advice,ffo3oud,t3_eud0ka,1580073779.0,"Weed isn’t really the biggest deal but if he is legit dependent on it there is an issue. Don’t force him to not smoke just encourage him to be responsible. Only smoke on weekends/ after work. Being high 24/7 is redundant even from a stoner perspective. Just an all out waste of money.

Human vices are meant for the end of the night. Smoking weed nightly won’t have the same consequences as drinking nightly. But if the dude needs to wake and bake to get going otherwise “my day isn’t the same” that’s a red flag. 

Moderation is key, abstaining isn’t always the answer but being a responsible adult is"

cats,ffjot98,t1_ffjn2zh,1580003229.0,"Throughout all of your numbers I must say we leave this mostly up to the cats self regulation. All of our cats are heavier. 

Siamese never had more then 4 laps per day, no other cats like coffee like him. Cat that enjoys tomato beer literally drinks for 30 seconds then goes away like it’s the water dish. Cats are pretty smart in general. Our “more stupid” cats don’t venture beyond the food dish. But the one that likes tomato beer doesn’t get too sloshed. And this happened maybe once every 4 months (not enough to throw off their livers operation). 

Onions are a serious threat with our cats they never get garlic or onions directly unless it was cooked with my steak. (Giving then the steak not the cooked garlic) 

I know this isn’t a basis for all domesticated cats. I’m saying don’t worry if your cat has few sips of coffee or beer. Don’t think it’s liver is going to fail.

If you have the rare cat with Down syndrome and it drinks everclear consult your local vet hospital."

Keep living on your 80k/year provided you don’t have any other outstanding debts. Save, reinvest, and look towards FIRE for the longterm. That 90k invested on top of your salary is a good start."
relationship_advice,ffjm7ud,t3_etzt04,1580001477.0,Few classes? You bright in the brains? If so find out if any big projects are coming up in any classes. Then ask her if she just wants to hangout and get an A.
