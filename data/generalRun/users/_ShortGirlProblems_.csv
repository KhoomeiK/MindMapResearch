sugarfreemua,ffh0zgw,t3_ethzkf,1579920202.0,"I really like the green on the lower lash line.  I think the eye overall looks great.  I'd maybe keep the brown shade closer to your eye and blend it up instead of going up so far with it so intense.  My main CC is the lips: I feel like the lip color is a bit too cool and also the finish is emphasizing the lines in your lips in an unflattering way.  I'd switch it to something a bit more brown-toned and more hydrating formula.  Or even going with a more ""MLBB"" shade could really let the eyes take center stage."

I'm not normally a fan of blush on the nose, but it looks perfect on you with this look.  You look like a dark fairy.  The only CC i have is I'd love it if you softened your brows a bit, but that's really personal preference.  If you love them this bold and dark, I'd suggest just cleaning up the inner part of your brow to get rid of that line of product at the top edge of your left brow."

Although it's pretty standard for the bridesmaids to pay for their own dresses, hair, makeup, etc. usually - unless the bride is insisting on professional hair and makeup.  However, since the location of the wedding changed, I think you can reasonably back out.  Just let her know ASAP, and cite the extra expense of travel and lodging as the reason."

SkincareAddicts,fdqp9h9,t3_emq6on,1578671930.0,"No, I don't think your derm is an ""idiot"".  It sounds like you are interested in other treatments for your skin, aside from accutane.  I imagine he was correctly able to diagnose your acne as hormonal upon exam, in which case he's right - ingredients in your skincare and diet aren't going to make much difference.  The accutane will probably help a lot.  However, if you have concerns about going on accutane, you should express that and ask for alternative treatment options.  You can try emailing or calling the doctor's office and communicating your concerns and asking for other options. Maybe spironolactone would be an option you'd be interested in?  It just sounds like a mixture of your doctor being a bit rushed and short with you, and you not communicating that you want more of a discussion.  I understand your frustration with tracking your routine and diet, and having that brushed off, but I also can see from the doctor's point of view why he wouldn't be interested in that data.  It's not relevant to him.  You are justified in feeling frustrated, but if you are wanting to stick with topicals like niacinamide, AHAs and BHAs, an aesthetician might be more in line with what you are looking for."

sugarfreemua,fdorjf9,t1_fdoq9zz,1578611287.0,"I really like the Better Than Sex waterproof version.  Or L’Oreal Lash Paradise, but it dries out quickly.  You could probably even just get a lash comb and run it through them. I tried the one you’re using now and personally didn’t like it, but I feel like mascara can really work differently on different people."
sugarfreemua,fdocb09,t3_emeakg,1578602577.0,"Your base looks good and your brows look good.  For the eyes: it looks like you have just one shade of eyeshadow around your eyes.  I am not seeing the different colors you used.  I would say, make sure you're not over blending.  Use a clean brush after each color, and then a clean brush for blending.  I'm not familiar with the shades you used, so it is also possible that they are not distinct enough from each other.  I'd also do less eyeshadow under the eye - keep it closer to your lash line - and keep it away from the bridges of your nose on your upper, inner eyelid area.  That may not be eyeshadow, it might be actual shadow, but it looks like you have applied makeup in those areas, and I think it is emphasizing how deep-set and wide-set your eyes are in a way that isn't doing them justice.  I'd focus the eye makeup more on the outer corners of your eyes.  I also think you could comb through your lashes or possibly switch to a different mascara, since that one looks a little bit clumpy.  Pictures tend to wash out blush, but I would like to see more blush.  You have a lovely face and lots of great features to work with."
toddlers,fdj3o88,t1_fdj0art,1578457593.0,"From what I remember, it has to be more like 2 separate concepts. Like an adjective and a noun or a verb and a noun. Showing that they are doing more than parroting, and that they are putting words together in ways that make sense. Some examples I can think of are “plane up” if they see an airplane in the sky, or “mama bye bye” if they see you putting on your coat. So I don’t think “more please” counts because they’re not putting those words together on their own. Again, I’m not a speech therapist or professional in any way, so please take that into consideration.  :)"
toddlers,fdioho8,t1_fdij85x,1578447480.0,She sounds right on track to me!
toddlers,fdihd3p,t1_fdidc2o,1578442943.0,"Yeah that’s one of the speech milestones. Really, it’s starting to be able to combine two words to convey more information.  I think I remember reading that something like “all done” doesn’t count because it’s not really combining words.  A better sentence would be something like “more milk”. I’m definitely not a speech therapist, though, so I may be wrong. Your kiddo has 2 more months, and a lot can change in that time!  I think most 2 year olds are able to say around 50 words, and understand most of what you are saying, too."
toddlers,fdic5bw,t3_elj9os,1578439585.0,"It does sound like maybe she has a delay. If you are in the US you can go through child find to get her evaluated and start speech therapy if needed. You don’t need your doctor’s referral. At 2 she should be speaking 2 word sentences.

I wanted to add that if you are concerned, definitely get an evaluation. My daughter was delayed in her speech. I had to push my pediatrician for an evaluation. I had concerns at 18 months and again at 2 years. At that point I just informed the pediatrician that I wanted an evaluation. She was found to be 6-9 months delayed!  I wished I had gotten her evaluated at 18 months. She got speech therapy at 2 and really started talking a lot when she started preschool at 3. Now she is a 4 year old chatterbox. :)"

AmItheAsshole,fczy4t6,t3_ejkij2,1578110634.0,"Info: did you sign a form when you scheduled your pet for the surgery or stopped him off? 

When I worked as a vet tech we always had an estimate for the owner to sign that specifically said the charges could be more. We always tried to call the owner before doing anything extra. We would have tried to call the owner to get an ok to remove the extra teeth. We also had them check a box to say if they: a) wanted us to do extra procedures deemed necessary by the vet or b) wanted us to do nothing, if we couldn’t contact them. Owners also had to check a box for what they wanted us to do if an emergency arose while the pet was under anesthesia, and if they wanted us to attempt to save the pet at the vet’s discretion or not.  

IMO they should have attempted to call you. And the vet is TA if they didn’t go over these sorts of things with you in advance, or have you sign your consent to do additional procedures.  

Please rest assured that removal of retained baby canines is a normal, common procedure, and your pet will benefit from having had it done."

Coffee,fcp7da1,t3_ei9roi,1577852918.0,"I'm going to agree with a lot of the other comments here.  Since it's something she's really into and knows a lot about, I'd suggest letting her choose.  You can still surprise her with the idea, give her a budget, and then let her pick it out.  Maybe even have a few suggestions, but ultimately let her decide.  That's what my husband did for me, and I'm not as experienced in coffee as your GF.  I ended up choosing a different machine than the one he had in mind, so I'm glad he left it up to me."

I want you next to lots of other people if possible.  You can blur their faces, too, IDGAF.  Cause I'm mainly looking at their necks anyways.  I want you inside, outside, in different lighting.  Wearing different colors.  No makeup, or at least tell me what the foundation you're wearing is.  And I want them unfiltered.  Oh, and feel free to throw in more info in the comments.  Do you look good in blue?  Red?  Like you're dead if you wear pastels?  Any great foundation matches?  Any that are close but too red or to yellow?  If you want, you can tell me that too.  Or not.  Give me some more data to base my answer on.  Then I'm gonna tell you what I think.  I can't promise to be right, but it's Reddit, so someone will probably correct me if I'm wrong.  Cool?
