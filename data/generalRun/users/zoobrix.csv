PUBATTLEGROUNDS,ffdtd2p,t1_ffcgke6,1579828437.0,After having started playing Tarkov lately the terrible sound levels in PUBG stand out even more now. Tarkov has problems with not hearing footsteps sometimes too but at least the sound level of footsteps is much louder relative to gunshots. It's so refreshing to not have my ears blown out every time someone shoots and be able to hear footsteps at the same time.

It might be impossible to say the exact percentages but please don't make it out that human trafficking is rare in prostitution, it is quite common.

Many people are manipulated into it by someone they think they're dating but really they are being groomed. A common tactic is to give someone gifts and money which later become debt they have to pay back in the form of being pimped out. You might think that kind of manipulation wouldn't work so well but human traffickers pick their targets very carefully, they're often young, disaffected and feel unwanted by people in their personal lives. That kind of tactic might not work on you but you're not a teenager with little life experience desperately looking for acceptance.

Hamilton and Halton region are hotbeds for human trafficking, highway access to many regions in Ontario and customers with a lot of disposable income, it's sadly more common than you probably think."

The reason I bring up that Amazon isn't really worse than other warehouse jobs, and in terms of pay and health plan is often better, is because everytime the focus is on Amazon other companies that treat their employees as disposable and politicians beholden to corporate donors love it because the spotlight is off them and all on Amazon. It frames the problem as ""we need to make sure Amazon treats people well"" instead of ""we're changing labor law to give employees greater protections"". The former is an easy target, the latter requires politicians that actually give a crap about the citizens the represent. The other companies and politicians sure don't want the spotlight on them so it's important to not make the discussion just about Amazon."

This is the feeling that increasing the loot on all the other maps has taken away from the rest of the game. I've only played 2 matches on Karakin so not sure how I feel about it yet but I still remember some of the games I won early in PUBG's life using crap, killing people with more useless crap and getting the guy at the end with an ironsight M4 cause that's the best I could find and I hate the holo. The thrill of shooting someone out of a passing car to find they have that sniper you needed. Nowadays you loot someone and maybe you need nades and meds, everyone after 5 minutes has an AR, sniper/dmr and all the scopes they need. I get a lot of people just want to loot and shoot but it's taken away a part of the game I used to really like."
BurlingtonON,ffag65e,t1_ffaeaff,1579734983.0,"I suggest looking at the actual growth targets in the plan and how much Burlington is growing by per year. Halton sits at over 550,000 now and has a target of 800,000 by 2031. Looking at the building rates of new residences over the past few years in Burlington and how much Oakville and especially Milton is growing you don't need a $600,000 dollar report to do the basic math. I did it a couple years ago when I saw this issue debated and found that people saying we needed to embark on some massive building campaign were pointing to provincial growth targets we're already set to meet, they were being disingenuous at best to cater to their own personal opinion of wanting more densification. I just briefly looked for the section in places to grow that laid out the target for 2041 that I can't remember off the top of my head but it's buried somewhere I can't find at the moment, nonetheless I don't think it involves needing 400,000 more residents in Burlington, ""could be expected"" doesn't sound particularly authoritative to me. Look at the numbers for yourself.

Also we must remember what penalties Places to Grow sets for municipalities if they fail to reach provincial targets, there are no penalties. I get you don't want to hear that your opinion is not supported by the numbers, point at all the staff reports and consultancy you want but it doesn't change that we're already growing to meet those targets, maybe that doesn't apply for the 2041 numbers but the 2031 ones will be met no problem."

BurlingtonON,ffab3wt,t1_ffa7r6x,1579731431.0,"So if a council member said it has no weight? Biases seem to be showing rather heavily again.

In any case I've heard it from multiple sources and looking at the numbers shows we would only need modest population growth to reach the target set for Halton, growth rates we were already achieving since places to grow came into existence. We don't need to embark on some massive increase in high rise buildings to meet the target, that is something that is pitched by people who want more intensification. The growth targets set by the province are pretty modest and will be met even if we set some draconian limit on heights in the core. The building already taking place around go stations will probably see us above the estimate alone, not to mention future construction already permitted along plains road.

If you personally think there should be more density certain places in Burlington that's fine but constantly pretending that the provinces numbers have forced some need to embark on making sure we build as high or as densely as possible is false, a quick look at the target numbers and existing growth rates show we will get there anyway."

So you have an editor at polygon that has tons of guides, reviews and opinion pieces on popular games they need filled and tons of people chomping on the bit to get something published on a site that has some any sort of existing reputation and fan base.

The editor doesn't know anything about Tarkov but it's the flavor of the moment and they want content on it stat, someone probably presented themselves as being knowledgeable about it and not knowing the game better the editor went ""ok this looks good"" and up it goes. When you want to pay as little as possible for articles this is what you'll get, it's the exact same reason you see so many completely ridiculous articles on video games in Forbes, when they're just bloggers writing for free the quality will reflect that."

Should Burlington grow in the right areas? Sure, do you need to warp your statements on council wanting to restrict growth in some areas as being incompatible with provincial guidance? No, you want Burlington to grow even more than it is, and that's fine if that's your desire but to present council's plans as not being feasible is being untruthful.

Making such statements that place blame for any decision you don't like on the council while pretending staff can do no wrong is a gross over simplification over how matters like this are decided and seems to come down to your own personal preferences on development. Feel free to have your own opinion of course but it's strange how the people you disagree with have no idea what ""good planning"" is while the people you agree with are the ones you think that should be deciding everything. It is staffs roll to advise council and implement their decisions, not decide the direction of anything.

Personally I think both the council and the staff have done a poor job managing growth in Burlington. A lack of new green space, allowing some condos to be built to the edge of lots which means no space for trees or wider sidewalks, no path directly connecting Aldershot go with plains road when they had the chance, still arguing about a tree protection law years after other municipalities have some form of one, farcicaly over optimistic estimates for increased transit ride ship and others that probably aren't coming to mind right now. There has been poor leadership from council and poor advice from staff.

Both the staff and the council are to blame for these failings but the elected officials are the ones in charge. If you think they aren't capable enough than work on getting people elected that are, like it or not the staff are not the ones in charge nor should they be."

Not sure if you read the post I linked but they touched on many of the back end processes that bottleneck back end processes and make scaling up quickly hard.

Maybe but aerial bombing was not particularly accurate at the time and I'm not sure of how much air power could have been focused in that area by the bombers they had and what kind of fighter escort they might have had. In any case the Luftwaffe would have no doubt vigorously defended the column for obvious reasons, they would not have had free reign in the skies. One of the game changers of Germany's march across France was the use of Stuka dive bombers in a close air support role with the actual precision to strike hardpoints, fortifications and armor and it was something the allies simply lacked at the time which would have made getting accurate hits on the column far from certain even using smaller bombs on fighters.

It might have made a difference but it also might have just meant slightly less armor and men to penetrate deeply into France.

Things like helicopter logging specific old growth trees that are near the end of their life but still make very expensive lumber is the type of logging we should be doing in old growth forests, low impact on the ground and taking a tree that wasn't going to be there much longer anyway.

We all know people that think people are driving insanely when they go 10 mph over or that one time they squeaked their tires, how do we know her estimates of how fast he was going was accurate?

Also they're not taking into account the data is not fool proof evidence, the driver might have not finished the ride right away which would make the average travel time longer even if they were excessively speeding.

That was not known before you watched the movie unless you read/saw some spoilers.

As an aside seeing how terrified an average solider would be of vader made for a great scene too.

Personally the fact that I knew they got the plans out but was still engaged, the movie impressed me because it made me interested in the story of how the hell they got them and also explained *why* that flaw existed in the death star at all. Plus the way it worked the last shot into the start of new hope was seamless. Rouge One didn't blow me away but it had a focus and point that all the other new movies lacked which only got worse after the force awakens, it didn't feel like it was made by a committee.

Strangely Disney has tapped a ton of the people that made Rouge One to make the Mandalorian and a bunch of them are apparently working on the new Obi Wan series as well. I feel like they have correctly identified that Rouge One is the only new star wars film with any personality and vision, something I feel those other movies sorely lacked.

Can't speak to the judges where you live but a ton of judges make extremely reasonable decisions and will definitely let people off for minor stuff even though they've technically broken the law. It especially helps if you dress decently and are very polite.

For my grade 12 law class we went to court for a day and we saw a short trial for shoplifting where the woman had run out of a store with some clothes she hadn't paid for to chase her small child who had ran away. She was ""apprehended"" by store security already walking back to the doors after picking up her kid, this was all confirmed after the security guard and the accused testified. It was painful though as the defense attorney got a lot of ridiculous answers from the guard before they finally admitted she was on the way back to the store before he even talked to her. Sure she technically stole when she left the store without paying but literally ten seconds after the trial ended the judge apologized to the woman and while glaring at the prosecutor dismissed all charges and wondered aloud why they were ever brought in the first place. The judge sent the appropriate message that making sure your child doesn't get lost hurt takes precedence over worrying about whether you've paid for something you're holding.

Thousands of cases get decided in court every day that are quite reasonable and make no headlines at all, it's only the shit judges and the odd insane decisions we end up hearing about.

It's important to note that you can not agree to a clause in a contract which is illegal so the important part is knowing your rights.

Obviously if a landlord has a ton of illegal crap in something they want you to sign that is a huge red flag but if you like the place and it's just a couple minor things you might want to consider just signing the lease and if it comes up gently informing the landlord you found out that part of the lease isn't enforceable.

Signing a lease with illegal crap in it isn't the best but it's so hard to find a place nowadays that you have to decide whether a few minor things you might have to work out afterwards is all that big a deal. Some landlords might be assholes but many smaller ones don't even know what they're asking for isn't proper.

If the street lighting is bad in that area mistakes can happen, the vast majority of Burlington transit drivers are pretty good and would never do it on purpose."
spacex,fdeykkk,t1_fdeotoo,1578349345.0,"I agree trying to say that the software issue on Starliner requires no investigation and was no biggie is ridiculous but the 737 max problems are far more serious and concerning than what might be one software error. 

Boeing rushed the 737 max into production in just 8 months to compete with a suddenly more fuel efficient Airbus 320, underplayed the changes so pilot training on the new type was minimal and the bare bones MCAS system in the cheapest model was a ticking time bomb waiting for a lackluster pilot with poor situational awareness to lose control of their aircraft.

The cause of the 737 crashes were a classic case of rushing a product to market when you got caught flat footed by a competitor and ignoring best practices in the name of money, it was systemic failure over many months by Boeing's commercial aviation division. Starliner might have had a piece of poorly written code someone should have caught, that doesn't excuse what was a pretty disastrous mission but I don't think the two failures are very close in causation."

It was always fine for the price, it was their donuts and baked goods back when they were made fresh in store that were great. With that being replaced by frozen reheated products long ago you have coffee that is now below average served with mediocre at best food. Suprise surprise people don't like that."

They do do a lot of selective cutting in old growth forests as well where they just take out a few tress in each area so it doesn't damage biodiversity as much.

Like I said logging isn't pretty but considering how much wood we use the fact that it's all eventually regrown and we have more tress than before is not pointless at all, it's succesful management of a renewable resource."
pics,fdcxt08,t1_fdchw6c,1578287483.0,"> I wonder how much of this cocner about plastic has to do with rising oil prices

Plastic is still dirt cheap to produce and great for shipping as it's lightweight but the extra concern around plastics lately is from finding microplastics, which are super super tiny pieces of plastic, in the tissue of so many animals that we eat and in the environment at large. We always knew plastic took forever to degrade but it's only in the last few years that the true danger of plastic has come to light with it literally starting to lace itself throughout the natural world. If we had it in proper landfills with clay bottoms and rubber liners we probably wouldn't have ended up with it being so pervasive but a lot of countries just dump garbage in the oceans or use landfills that are just a  pit and that has allowed plastics to infiltrate everywhere.

Plastics aren't really rising in cost to make as oil has actually been down a bit over the last couple years in general but some new science has made us speed up wanting to minimize it entering the environment. No one knows what the effects of such microscopic bits of plastics in ourselves and what we eat might be."
pics,fdcxdtd,t1_fdctio6,1578287114.0,"North America has more trees now than 1950 because of mandatory replanting schemes where you have to make sure a tree actually grows to replace the one you took, long story short that means logging companies plant so many tees often you end with more than they took in the first place. There is a hell of a lot more we need to do to protect the environment but don't worry about using wood products produced in the US or Canada, it all gets regrown in the end even if it can look pretty shitty right after an area is logged."

The person I replied to literally said she wouldn't probably have had a chance even if the statements were true. I am not a lawyer but it doesn't work that way in Canada and I don't believe they know much of anything about defamation law ls here because they didn't even know the basics about it."
UpliftingNews,fd3s5bw,t1_fd3a99v,1578161218.0,"You don't use the words it's a conspiracy but what you're saying would have to be exactly that.

> they've just convinced us its our fault for using them

That's the same all companies are evil all the time kind of talk because no they've never done that. They gave us cheap packaging, cutlery, plates and bags that worked and didn't place a huge cost burden on us or them. I keep mentioning the conspiracy talk because that's what you and some other posters in the thread sound like.

And no the microplastics thing has just become known in the last few years, before that plastic was of course known not to biodegrade but is that their problem for making it or people's problem for not making sure it was disposed of properly so it ended up in a proper land fill? 

I'm not against any of the ideas you propose to fix the problem but we're just as responsible for what we want as them for giving it to us, stop putting it all on the companies that make the products we use, if we didn't buy them and like them they wouldn't make them."
news,fd230np,t1_fd0sj9w,1578140897.0,"Yet Canadian courts just recently threw out Subways defamation lawsuit against the CBC for saying their chicken tested as only being half chicken because it was in the public interest to know that. It's almost like the law is being intelligently applied since there is no public interest in knowing the details of this random guys private life but there is if we're told we're eating chicken that isn't all chicken. There is an exemption for things that would be in the public interest to know.

So I guess it doesn't always work out for the plaintiff."
UpliftingNews,fd20rwt,t1_fd0o7cv,1578139859.0,"Every single thing we use has a cost in pollution associated with it, not every single decision a company ever made was done with malice and ill intent.

No one post world war 2 knew about microplastics and that they would end up infiltrating so much of the biome, they thought it was a better and cheaper material to put things in. Plastic is actually a much more environmentally friendly from a shipping perspective because it weighs so much less than glass or metal. I hope any decision we make takes the increased emissions into account from going back to materials that are far heavier. And yes companies in the 60's and 70's didn't think about that advantage either. Once again plastic was just cheaper and a better packaging material, they thought it was a win/win, cheaper for them and the consumer and better to boot. Less worry about breakage for them and the consumer and it kept food fresh as well.

Glass and metal have their own environmental production consequences too, but I guess we're just going back to them with no analysis of the total environmental impact from end to end on the production chain?

Not everything is some evil conspiracy and to see it that way only gets in the way of finding the best solutions to the problem."
UpliftingNews,fd02wzn,t1_fczuaic,1578112844.0,"Plastic cutlery became common because it was cheap and convenient. So cheap you can even give it away with every meal and you sell and because every place that serves food offers it you need to match.

I'm not saying that doesn't mean we need to look at every way possible to reduce our plastic use over time but it became common in our supply chain as a packaging as it is cheap to use, keeps products including food very well and is light for shipping purposes which is why over the last many decades a lot of things that used to come in paper, metal and glass shifted to using plastic. Sure they wanted to save money and be able to cut their price and/or make more profits but it's not like anyone planned how prevalent it would be. When you don't know about the environmental consequences of microplastics it seems like the perfect material.

Not every product has some huge evil scheme behind it."
