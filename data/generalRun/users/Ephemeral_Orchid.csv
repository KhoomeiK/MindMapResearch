My last comment was actually tongue in cheek. I believe diversity makes communities stronger and that immigrants should be able to live anywhere they choose regardless of their culture, race, or religion."

AskReddit,fe75ccd,t1_fe0po0x,1578910246.0,"Hepatitis just means an inflamed liver, which can be caused by a virus, heavy drinking, disease, autoimmune disorders, toxins, parasites, or infections. 

 Hepatitis A, B, & C are most common in the US & developed world but there are actually FIVE hepatitis viruses, the last two being D and E. 

â–ªï¸ŽA & E are both transmitted by orally injesting infected fecal matter, most commonly through contaminated food or water. 

â–ªï¸ŽB, C, & D are transmitted when body fluids (eg. blood, semen, vaginal secretions) are exchanged with an infected individual via sex, shared needles, childbirth, blood transfusions, etc. (Note: Only people who have or are carriers of Hep B can get Hep D.)

There are vaccines available for Hep A, B/D (the B vaccine protects against D too), & E, but the E vaccine is only available in China. Hep C has no vaccine, has always been the most serious of the viruses and only recently has a cure been discovered."

CasualConversation,fbos49v,t1_f9m5vik,1577013779.0,"Just a few words of advice for ladies thinking about going to bars alone, from a woman who's traveled/lived all over the world alone & walked into many bars by myself. 

   I pick smaller bars with a ""local feel"" (as opposed to clubs or tourist traps) and avoid places with emcees, live bands, or karaoke... because it's difficult to meet people or have a conversation when you're shouting over loud music & can't hear each other.

   Also remember to be extra vigilant about safety. In my experience, most men are quite protective of women out alone but those few bad apples are rarely the ones you'd suspect. 

   So never leave your drink unattended and when you leave either have a Lyft/Uber pick you up at the door or wait for others to leave so you don't end up by yourself in the parking lot at night, some of those creeps will sit outside in the dark and wait for you to leave.

   Have fun, just stay aware of your surroundings, and be safe!"
