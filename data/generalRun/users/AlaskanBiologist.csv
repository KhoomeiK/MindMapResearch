politics,fgmnge0,t1_fgmmmz3,1580928174.0,"Yeah that's super frustrating. One of my good friends is about 10 years younger than me (mid 20s) and she doesnt know jack about politics. I had to force her to register to vote last year when she finally got a driver's license.

Her boyfriend and I try to get her interested but she just doesn't care. I point out that literally everybody who controls her life votes (her boss, the governor, etc) and she still doesn't care. Honestly shes always broke as fuck though so I think shes more concerned with surviving day to day then anything more than that. It's sad. She came from an abusive household that force homeschooled her in a religious ""group"" and when she left the group she couldnt go to high school cuz she was so far behind in math etc. I've been trying to help her get her GED but honestly she has just given up."
