I think the whole fad of automatically believing the women in the MeToo movement had actually done a ton of damage to the justice system and feminism.  It went unchecked and, as with most things in life, the dregs of society saw an opportunity to take advantage of and so they did.  What's unfortunate is the average joe doesnt have the resources to defend themselves and TMZ isnt gonna care to play leaked audio supporting them."

LifeProTips,fgq0cfe,t3_ezhpn6,1581015454.0,"I got two stories relating to this from when I worked at a consulting firm in NYC.  So I worked as like an editors assistant for the Global Video Services and when there was a lack of work for me to do they would lend my assistance to the Digital Asset Manager that worked at the desk next to me.  So, if memory serves, we were kinda changing systems and how we meta-tagged our assets and I was just like manually moving things around and making sure everything played together the way it was supposed to when I found an error in our ID system that was causing files to sort into the wrong places.  We had an office mantra of not bringing problems to our managers but instead to approach them with solutions.  So I figured out a simple fix that I figured I could implement in 2-3 days and went and explained the problem and solution to Asset Manager.... well, she berated the shit outta me, saying things like ""I didn't ask for you to look for issues, I told you to sort and transfer everything"" and ""that is the stupidest solution I've ever heard of.""  It was pretty hurtful, and I already didnt like the woman but this caused me to outright resent the bitch, no wait, the resentment came the next morning at our quarterly office wide meeting where she went in front of the entire office staff (couple hundred) and in her status update reported a major redundancy error and her simple and practical solution that would keep us on schedule for delivery... yeah that was my ""stupid"" solution she was boasting.  After the meeting there was no apologies or thanks.  Just go implement that stupid solution.  And she got all the praise from the execs, not that I needed praise, but it killed me how much she insulted my intelligence when I had gone out of my way to help her and potentially save months of trouble shooting.


The other story is shorter haha, a big part of my job was ripping audio from video footage and sending it out to be transcribed.  The computer does all the work but it was a little time consuming to set up each file in the software program, so I created these like  ""action folders"" that were automated to execute certain preset functions on any file that was dropped into them.  So if I received a harddrive with 20 video files I could just drag them into the action folder and that was that.  Everything else would happen in the background.  I would have so much more time to help on other projects and eventually my manager asked me how this was possible.  Young and naive, I taugh her how to create these action folders thinking she would be grateful for my ingenuity and together we could find other ways to automate our productions and increase efficiency.  Instead about a month later they got an unpaid intern for me to train to help around the office.  A month after that I was notified that my position was being eliminated from the company.

To add further insult to injury; when I applied for Unemployment my former manager told them that I had actually be fired for a myriad of infractions like constantly being late or no show.  I fortunately saved all my performance reviews which all had stellar remarks and never had any issues documented.  Third party arbitration sided with me but I was amazed how my manager totally stabbed me in the back.  She had been so bubbly nice and I genuinely thought we were friends.



Anyhow my conclusion was never trust anyone in an office/corporate setting.  You gotta look out for number 1.  Everybody else is.  Even the ones you genuinely think as friends will throw you under the bus if gets them one step up."
AskReddit,fgpurmo,t1_fgpnru2,1581012403.0,"I've heard the expression of ""kicking the crutch out from beneath"" but I never heard the second part about ""cushioning the fall"" and I really like that idea and it resonates with me so much.  Wife and I have been talking about having kids and I've spent a lot of my free time imaging how I would raise me kids.  My parents pushed me outta my comfort zone, and as much as I sometimes hated it it actually really helped to shape me into the man I am.  I want to be that way with my kids, but maybe even a little more so and definitely with a calculated cushioning.

Anyhow thanks for adding that expression to my vernacular"

There's definitely a lot more abuse towards men then is reported but hopefully everyone else who shared their experiences in this thread also found it therapeutic like I did, and maybe not so isolated in their experience. 


For what it's worth, it's a hard thing to discuss outside of threads like this.  I always feared if I discussed it with friends they'd assume that I must have been physical to cause her to hit me, because that's the stereotype ingrained in us by society.

videos,fgiqin1,t1_fgihmfp,1580828627.0,"Will prob get buried but just wanna say I was in the same situation way back when.  Dated a girl who got more and more emotionally abusive which eventually became physical... punched in me the face on two separate occasions (one time I was dead asleep and she walloped me for supposedly snoring).  She would gaslight me and make me think I was the problem, honestly fucked me up for even a good 5 years after the relationship ended.  She would drink so much, accuse me of cheating on her (which I would find out she was actually cheating on me the entire 2+ years) and most nights ended with me sleeping on the couch.  One night I had enough and packed my bags and started to leave and as she started chasing after me when she fell on the sidewalk and then stood up and accused me of hitting and pushing her onto the ground... a feat I somehow accomplished from 10 feet away with my hand on my car door and the other hand holding my suitcase.  The worst part though was be were both from the same tiny town and she had a lot of influence in my social circle, so she told everyone I was hitting her, a drunk, and a cheater.  May have lost my reputation and standing back home but I'm such a happy person to have her out of my life, and now im happily married to the most wonderful woman.  Sorry for the rant but it was good to vent that"
