Dingos are semi domesticated because they are only bred away from their wild counterpart by a margin.
Cats are not domesticated through selective breeding so there isn’t much of a difference to the wild cat it was. That’s why there’s a difference between dogs and cats. Cat domestication isn’t based on a breeding practice. It’s based on direct exposure and change to the environment that they’re used to.

They would be on separate mixers, but those mixers would be routed to another mixer. That way if you have your drums mixed the way you want them separately but they’re too loud or quiet, then you only need to turn that one up or down instead of adjusting them all.

It just saves time if you’re working on a larger project where you might have a lot of individual mixer tracks for certain elements of the song.

So if you have kick, snare and hat in the channel rack and you want to do that you can colour them, put in the mixer number you want it on, then select them all or each and click cntrl L.
They’ll be in the mixer.
Title an empty mixer bus or drums bus or something and click the kick, go down to the arrow at the bottom. Right click and select “route to this track only”
