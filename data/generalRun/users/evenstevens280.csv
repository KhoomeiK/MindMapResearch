Sure, if I was thinking rationally I should have been directing some of my frustrations at my landlord. But I wanted out, and quickly, so I was going for the path of least resistance to most conclusions.

That's not to say that the estate agency were doing things like they're meant to, either. I gave them (and my landlord) pretty clear instructions that I'd be happy to cooperate if:

\- They kept requests for viewings below a certain amount per-week

\- To always give me at least 24 hours notice (this is a legality anyway)

\- To NEVER enter the property without my permission (also a legality, but I felt like I had to say it)

\- To not have viewings at the weekend

\- To only have viewings between 10am and 5pm

The landlord said she was fine with this, and was sympathetic to the situation... even though it was crappy of her to put me into it in the first place. To be fair to her, she lowered my rent 25% whilst in the sale process, which she absolutely didn't need to do. So... y'know. Make of that what you will.

The estate agency said they were okay with that... but broke all of these rules anyway, or at least attempted to, *multiple* times. So yes, I will gladly get cross with the 'minimum wage wallys', because they ignored me.

But, it was still her property to sell and I never questioned why she was selling up. For all I knew she was having financial troubles or needed to move out of the area."

I feel like she rented out her property without much thought about how much effort being a *good* landlord actually takes.

Anyway, that landlord decided to sell the property six months into my contract, and gave all responsibility for the viewings to the estate agency. Obviously that's up to her... it's her property and all that, but it was really bloody annoying. It took me a month to find a good enough place to move into - with a month's lead time to move in - so I was there for two months after it went on sale.

Tell you what... having people coming and going from your home for two months *whilst* dealing with finding and moving somewhere else is enough to send anxiety levels to dangerous highs. I exercised my rights of no-entry many times to the estate agency. They must have got tired of it because I caught them twice entering without my permission. Long story there... it involved threats of legal action and quite a generous ""settlement"".

Also... why don't they understand the concept of ""24 hours notice"". I had emails and calls coming through at 6pm requesting viewing for 9am the next day. No fuck off with that. Leave me alone.
