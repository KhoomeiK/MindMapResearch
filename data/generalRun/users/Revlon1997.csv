Chemistry is not a difficult subject. It is taught poorly all throughout secondary school.

Find a topic you want to learn about and spend a half hour watching youtube videos then try answer the exam question again.

Youtube has hundreds if not thousands of lecturers and teachers explaining concepts with a level of understanding and passion that you teacher is unlikely to have.

Professor Dave was one such youtuber I found invaluable at all levels bar my final year.

I literally spent years after secondary school learning from youtube to supplement poor lecturers in college. This shit works and its a crime that secondary school teachers dont make this knowledge available"
