HomeDecorating,ff9vic6,t1_ff9ssqz,1579722405.0,I love plants. But not rooms that look like the plant aisle at home depot. Lol. What are you thinking? A tall potted tree in the corner might be nice.
crafting,ff9rydi,t3_en63mq,1579719873.0,These are beautiful! I adore copper. What an amazing gift. How much would something like this reasonably be? I had looked before on Etsy for copper tulips and the price ranged so wildly I got stuck not knowing what was reasonable and would be good quality.

Also, I'm not saying that or anything is ""how brains work"". I'm saying that the comparisons being made between healthy brains and damaged brains are different than what comparisons would be made between different damaged brains of those with wildly different functions levels and that would be interesting to see those comparisons. But I get it. Everyone loves to say x did z because a study said so."

But it doesn't always. I work with special needs and it's incredible how people that have seemingly empty spots in their brain are able to function and conform while similar scans are used to explain why someone is nonverbal or severely disabled.

Teachers,fez2nrm,t3_eqnitn,1579453293.0,"Congratulations! My suggestion would be to be accepting that this is a time of learning. There are few hard rules in sped and so many grey areas that depends on your state, district, site, admin, etc. That can be very frustrating. Focus on your students. Document EVERYTHING.

I see what some kids have to deal with on a daily basis and I know, as an adult, that would be extremely difficult. I often point to behaviors of domestic violence victims and compare them to some of the students trapped in classes with out of control students. We are teaching kids to empathize, sympathize, and excuse behavior of little terrorists. They are told that they need to learn to ignore the other kids behaviors and that their reaction is their fault. As books fly by, kids get pushed around, and teachers get cussed out."

I don't know that any schools would have staff left if people who called each other bitches couldn't work together. Also, use this opportunity to learn a very valuable lesson. Those who you engage with in bashing a peer are the same people who will later engage in bashing you. It hurts the first few times and then you just gotta learn to shrug it off."
