Yes, because the judge using his horn to inform the officer that he was causing a traffic hazard does not merit a citation. That's plainly obvious. 

>there is no such thing as an enforceable traffic violation.

Sure there is. First off, the percentage of citations that are actually contested is so low as to be irrelevant. All uncontested citations are automatically enforceable. 

Second, most citations are supported by radar, camera, or other evidence. The number of traffic citations where the only evidence presented is the testimony of the officer and the testimony of the driver is extraordinarily low.

I did not make that claim at all.  Of course it is admissible.  It's simply not given the greater weight that you seem to think.

>And the officer never got to state his reasons because the judge would not let him

What are you talking about?  The judge had no power to do what you are saying.  The officer's authority to stop and cite a driver is absolute. The driver's identity has no effect on the officer's authority to do his job. He was perfectly capable of citing the judge. I suppose it is theoretically possible that the cop was too stupid to understand he was fully and solely in control of the traffic stop, but that theory doesn't help the officer either. 

Your argument that he was intimidated by the judge requires that the officer was either acting maliciously when he pulled over the judge, or he was acting cowardly when he refused to cite the judge. 

>Once again, your claim that the officer manufactured evidence is unfounded.

I have **never** claimed the officer ""manufactured evidence"".  Precision of language, please. Manufacturing evidence is a very serious charge, and nothing in the video suggests it. 

My claim is that it is not unreasonable to believe the traffic stop was unjustified. This suggestion only requires that the officer be mistaken, and acting on that mistake.  

With the judge's actions under scrutiny, I suggested it is possible that the officer made an unverifiable claim that the judge was tailgating.  The officer's claim is not supported by the video evidence. With the judge under scrutiny, the officer's claim must be discarded unless conclusively proven.  

>A lack of evidence is not evidence.

That is true in science and logic. That is untrue in law.   The presumption of innocence requires that a lack of evidence supports the claims of the defendant. 

Since this is not a situation that can be resolved conclusively and inarguably, we must not apply the rigid and inflexible scientific standard, but instead operate on the legal one.  We must assume the accused is telling the truth until proven otherwise. 

The judge's actions were not justified in either case, but there is a big difference between anger over getting a ticket, and the righteous indignation that comes from catching a cop abusing their authority.  The video evidence supports either case."

What's the difference?

Today, if I give a gun to a friend, and it turns out he is a felon, I can only be prosecuted if the state can prove I knew he was a felon beforehand. 

If we make NICS publicly accessible, then I can know, and I should know that the recipient is a felon. The state merely has to prove that the transfer occurred to convict me. 

The problem with UBCs is that they criminalize inoffensive transfers between people who can lawfully own guns.  This is a problem when UBC law considers a transfer a sale even though regular people wouldn't.    For example, a friend is leaving town for a month and wants me to store his guns in my safe.  Or, another friend is about to start a course of anti-depressants. He is worried about dangerous side effects, and wants me to hold on to his gun until his mental state is stabilized.   Or I get old and senile, and my daughter wants her brother-in-law to hold my guns.  Or I need to leave the range suddenly, and my shooting partner has to transport my guns. 

Each of these is considered a ""sale"" under UBC law.  When statistics say that 90% of transfers are conducted without a background check, these are the kinds of transfers they are talking about. Mandating background checks for these common, inoffensive ""transfers"" is unreasonable. 

Under the system I propose, it is impossible to prosecute a transfer when the recipient is allowed to own guns, but any transfer to a prohibited person is simple to prosecute. The legitimate purpose of UBCs is accomplished without the unfortunate side effects."

The question isn't whether or not it is a burden, but whether or not it is an *unacceptable* burden.  It is a ""burden"" to have to travel to the polling place.  It is a ""burden"" to have to request an absentee ballot. It is a ""burden"" to register to vote in the first place, especially for someone without a permanent address. That doesn't mean that it is unconstitutional to demand that potential voters register to vote, nor to demand they travel to the polling place or request an absentee ballot.   Reasonable burdens are acceptable.  A requirement to prove you are who you say you are doesn't seem particularly unreasonable to me.



> So tell me, how is it any different than poll taxes that were ruled unconstitutional?

Demanding that everyone *buy* an ID would certainly be a poll tax and thus unconstitutional.  But, the government could be required to provide an ID free of charge to anyone authorized to vote. Hell, they could even *pay* everyone a nominal fee to cover the burden of acquiring an ID. 

Again, I don't particularly care one way or another.  I don't think the current system is broken enough to demand a change, but I don't think requiring an ID card at the polling booth is a big enough of a problem to prevent such a system from being adopted."

>This hurts my brain it is such a level of doublethink.

Wait: You actually do not understand this concept?  You don't understand the difference between ""lawful presence"" and ""citizenship""?  

Ever hear of a ""green card""?  The people who hold them are ""lawful permanent residents"".  These are immigrants who have not become naturalized US citizens. They are still citizens of their former country of residence, but they are legally allowed to live and work in the US.  Green card holders are legally present, but they are not afforded the civil rights and privileges of citizens. (They are afforded all the civil rights and privileges of American *persons*, but they do not have *citizenship* status.)

Students, tourists, refugees, temporary workers, and many others are lawfully present, but they are not considered American persons.  They are not afforded the civil rights and privileges afforded to citizens, nor the civil rights and privileges afforded to American persons.  

We don't need to bestow citizenship on everyone who approaches the border, but we don't need to automatically deny entry either. We can adopt a ""shall issue"" policy on work permits/taxpayer IDs.  Give them to anyone who requests one. 

Establish an income taxation policy that leaves Americans competitive with non-Americans.  Require them to pay into social security and other programs, but they only become eligible for benefits if they become American persons or citizens, depending on the purpose of the program."

You tell them who you are.  They look you up in their registration book to verify that you are allowed to vote.  They record that you showed up to vote.  If two people show up claiming to be the same person, they trigger an investigation. 

You couldn't be ""literally anyone"".  You would have to claim to be an actual voter actually registered in that voting district, who doesn't actually show up and vote. 

The risks of getting caught far exceed the likelihood of changing the results of an election. The problem doesn't exist.

Are you forgetting that as far as my voting district is concerned, **you** are (effectively) a ""non-citizen""?  **You** are just as much (or as little) a threat to election integrity in my electoral district as any immigrant. I am just as much a threat to election integrity in your electoral district as any immigrant.

But, to answer your question: Voter registration already accomplishes that task. The ""problem"" you're describing was solved long before you asked the question. 

The reasons I don't have any strong opinions on voter ID requirements are because the existing registration system is working fine.  No need to fix what isn't broken. 

Of course, I don't feel that an ID card is a particularly steep burden for a citizen to acquire and maintain.
