In the space of a month I have had an appointment with a  Neurologist at Queens Sq the country’s leading hospital for check ups from the neck up. I waited 2 weeks for the appointment.  Also had an EEG and an MRI scan. I had a full health MOT including full blood work, replacement inhalers, pain killers with my GP who saw me the day after I called.. I had a chest X-ray yesterday that was a walk in appointment with no wait. Next week I have an appointment with a Rheumatology Dr. I also get ongoing CBT therapy every week. All for free - but should I have to pay it would just be a minimum prescription charge which is about £8.50.
