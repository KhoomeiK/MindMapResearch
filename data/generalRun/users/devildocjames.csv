Should be no reason can't find one, as long as she can be responsible for it.  I hate to say it, but.... oh dang, this is difficult... okay, well... maybe she should get a cat?

There, I said it!  Okay? Cats are probably better for indoors, when living in a small apartment,  especially if someone is elderly.  I don't know, maybe your mom is able-bodied and goes for walks.
