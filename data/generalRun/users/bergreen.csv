Just a couple weeks ago, almost an hour after closing. Doctor was gone and we were having an important manager meeting.

That's still a pretty huge leap in logic, as there are many gaps that make what you've done so far an insufficient food trial.

For example: where is your list of protein sources, your complete ingredients list, your food journal that tracks times on each diet & dates of each reaction? Where is your complete list of brands, and a specific list of their food lines that you've tried? Have you tried a hydrolized protein?

Normally the first recommendation would likely be diagnostics, followed by a proper food trial. However since your dog has been so ill for so long, I would probably suggest seeking a consult with a board certified nutritionist or internal med specialist.

No, it isn't. It's a simple fact of reality. There isn't a drug made that hasn't killed a living being, even when dosed appropriately. Even if it's just from a simple anaphylactic reaction. Far more humans die from eating peanuts, than dogs do from Carprofen - and I've yet to see someone run to a public forum to tell everyone to never feed their children peanuts again. Then there's Tylenol. People die from Tylenol toxicity pretty often, and many of those are not overdoses.

Trusting your statistics for sake of argument, I must admit I was likely wrong. It must be more like, perhaps, one in 100 million. Just *one* of my clinics prescribed Carprofen to over 5,000 dogs last year alone - without one serious side effect reported. Multiply that by the tens of thousands of vet clinics in the country, and we've demonstrated a drug that is statistically extremely safe. 

Don't get me wrong, Carprofen is not a totally benign drug. This is why veterinarians recommend bloodwork at least twice per year for a patient that will be on it long term. Unfortunately in my clinical experience, roughly 8 or 9 out of 10 clients refuse the bloodwork and demand refills anyway. 

That said, it's typically very safe for short-term use, and bloodwork is often not even recommended in those cases.

Spoiler alert: every last one of us working at the animal hospital already knows your dog is high. Not a single one of us will call the cops because you have drugs. We just want to know what your dog ate, so we know how to treat it.

Now it's a totally different story if you're intentionally drugging your pet, but then again if you were you most likely wouldn't be bringing them to us in the first place."

Now for some more specific advice:   


Wet VS Dry: I personally find that dry food generally promotes better oral health. Dry food is less likely to get stuck between teeth, and helps mechanically clean teeth. Ask your vet about a good dental chew/supplement/etc if you want to add chemical cleaning to the oral hygiene routine as well. 

&#x200B;

Brand VS Brand: The big 4 are honestly pretty similar. After deciding on a properly-balanced diet for a pet/patient, many docs will choose brand based on anecdotal palatability experience.  In your shoes I would probably compare each brand's version of a small breed senior food, and select based on price & availability.
