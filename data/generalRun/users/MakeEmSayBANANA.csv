Damnthatsinteresting,ffoo49r,t1_ffomjns,1580079801.0,"I had to read it a few times but I get it now. If fish could draw, this is what the map of their world would look like. Based on the areas that they are able to access/navigate, which are the oceans."

funny,fcad17c,t3_egvfdm,1577567070.0,"There was a guy who worked at my local Subway years ago who was military-style serious about crafting my sandwiches. His response was always a simple and robotic - “Understood.”

“Lettuce?”
“Yes, please.”
“Understood.”

“Would you like your sandwich toasted, ma’am?”
“Toasted would be great.”
“UNDERSTOOD.”

I was torn between admiring his dedication to his craft and also feeling like I should ask him to blink twice if he needed help escaping...."
