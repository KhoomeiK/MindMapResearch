bipolar_irl,ffvmuy2,t3_evbj5o,1580267864.0,"I once had my roommate drive me over an hour away to buy an albino hedgie off some craigslist lady we met in a gas station parking lot for more money than we had budgeted for the rest of the month - and we then had to hide him in our room for the rest of the year since we had a no pets clause.

He was the worst pet ever, but also no regrets."

ThriftStoreHauls,ffimwx9,t1_ffih79v,1579977712.0,"Looks like OP went to one of the Goodwill Outlets, where they sell most things by the pound.

You can get things incredibly stupidly cheap there (my local ranges from $1.99/lb to $0.39/lb depending on type of item and how much you buy total), but you have to do all your own sorting through the bins while defending your place and I *highly* recommend you wear gloves. Other customers can be aggressive about the bins and carts and everything in general.

A fun way to spend the day if you aren't easily grossed out and can deal with the absolute chaos that these stores thrive on."

1200isfineIGUESSugh,fewhc30,t1_fewguzt,1579410587.0,That would absolutely cut down on my monthly food budget - but what's the calorie discrepancy between eating a posh rich lady and my usual poor starving orphan steak?!
1200isfineIGUESSugh,fewge28,t1_feu460z,1579410141.0,"I'm in a ""budget eats"" group and a lady just commented about how eating for under $1000/month for a couple is impossible unless you just eat ""absolute garbage""."
