YouShouldKnow,ffujntn,t1_ffud5xa,1580243366.0,"There's a difference between taking a kid somewhere they don't want to go, and human trafficking. Just because you gave birth to somebody doesn't mean you automatically get to do whatever you want with them. 

But even if it's not human trafficking and little Suzy is being a shithead because she doesn't want to go to Grandma's house, as soon as she says something, alarm bells are going off and people are being investigated. They're always going to take it seriously and I really don't think it's something you'd be able to talk their way out of, even if you are the parent. You're missing your flight, the kid is being brought somewhere, and you're probably ending up in handcuffs. Best case scenario, you're stuck with a months long court battle to get your kid back."
Luthier,ffudxm8,t3_ev7wcy,1580239930.0,"It looks good without the pickguard.

I think a clear pickguard would be cool too, since you get the look and feel of a pickguard without hiding the grain. 

But I'll also suggest a black pickguard to match the hardware. Anything you do needs to be subtle. If you go flashy, your bass will look tacky. Black would blend in perfectly and wouldn't take away from the fun grain pattern you have."

It's not like the spoon is some top secret anti trafficking code, it's just a big metal object that's guaranteed to set off the detectors. 

As soon as you say ""I'm being taken out of the country to marry somebody against my will"", the cops are getting called. Even if it's your parents, I don't think anybody will be able to easily talk their way out of that one. It's a pretty big deal and the authorities are going to take it very seriously. 

It's kinda like calling the cops and saying your parents beat you. They're not going to take your parents word on it and ignore it. They're sending in CPS to investigate."

People said 2015 sucked but hoped 2016 would be better.

Then they said 2016 sucked but we were all hopeful for 2017..

And then 2017 came and went, but we all crossed our fingers for 2018...

And 2018 sucked, but maybe 2019 wouldn't be so bad...

Aaaaand 2019 was trash. I know we are only 3 weeks into 2020, but it ain't looking good. Politically, everyone's fighting over an impeachment and in a few months everyone is gonna be fighting over an election. It's gonna be a rough one, my friend.

pics,ffrqq2h,t1_ffrjcag,1580163711.0,"I don't think we're doomed. People are always going to do what's easiest for them, so we need to solve these problems by coming up with solutions where the ""good"" option is also the most convenient. You can't fight laziness, so I think you have to embrace it as best you can. Or, in some cases, don't even give people the option to be bad (like how some stores don't give you bags at all)

There also needs to be a bigger push into reduce and reuse. And I think a lot of this needs to be done at a higher level than the average consumer. Like forcing companies to go easy on how much packaging they use in their products, or like how they banned single use plastics. I think it'll be easier to get companies like Amazon or McDonalds to change how they operate, and I think it's easier to get the average joe on board since they won't have to do anything."

answers,ffqmfka,t1_ffqcnsh,1580138484.0,"I'm Canadian and my wife is American. It'll be different for every other country, but I moved to America. We went through the K1 fiance visa to get married in America. It's different if you're already married.

It's one form after another.

I think the first one was $800 USD.  I had to pay $350 for a mandatory medical appointment, and about $100 for a police background check. I had to schedule an interview with the American embassy and I think that was about $300 USD too, I think. There was even a $6 fee to enter the country. Then after we got married, we had to pay $1200 for more paperwork to allow me to stay in the country (my initial visa was technically temporary)

None of this includes travel expenses, as I had to travel for the medical appointment as well as the Embassy appointment. That was probably $2000 in hotels and plane tickets. Would have been cheaper if I had lived closer, but every single Canadian in this position HAS to travel to Montreal, pretty annoying considering the size of the country... Every single one of those steps required passport photos as well, which isn't super expensive but adds up if you're not printing them yourself.

I think the marriage certificate was like 50 bucks. And then there were wedding expenses, but those are optional. I think technically, you can just show up and get married to whoever you want. Nobody asked for my immigration documents when we got our marriage license. But I wouldn't try it, you'll probably piss off the customs people if you come in a tourist visa and tell them you wanna stay.

I think it's cheaper if you apply for the visa where you're already married, but I think it takes longer. (Or vice versa, I can't remember which is which)

It takes a long time too. It was about 9 months from submitting the initial paperwork to me finally being able to enter the country. And after that, it's still a couple months where you're waiting for your green card to become a permanent resident and they make you go through more interviews to be sure that your marriage isn't a sham.

It's a difficult and stressful process. I can't say I'd recommend it to anyone."
Bass,ffozqy1,t1_ffotc34,1580083718.0,"There's supposed to be a wire that goes from the electronics to underneath the bridge. That way, all of your strings are grounded and it will stop making noise when you touch the strings.

So if stops hissing when you touch the jack, but not when you touch the strings, that wire is probably missing or might be broken. Most basses should have one so it's as simple as resoldering it. But maybe if somebody took apart your bass at see point and didn't understand why there was a wire that led nowhere, they might have removed it. 

There are other reasons why a bass might make noise though:

Single cool pickups hum. That's why ""humbuckers"" are called that. There isn't really a fix for that, it's just how they are. But there are fancier single cool pickups that have multiple or hidden coils in them to prevent that. On a jazz bass, the hum will go away when you turn up both pick ups (they both hum in opposite ways so they cancel each other out)

Sometimes if your electronics cavities aren't shielded, they can pick up interference from the outside world. Basically, your bass acts as a radio antenna. They sell copper tape and even fancy paint that you can line the cavities with that will help stop that. It's an easy fix. That lining needs to be grounded as well, but it usually will be through your pots."
onguardforthee,ffotqh1,t3_euc734,1580081695.0,"My home town has really changed over the years and a lot of people I grew up with have gotten deep into drugs. It's definitely upsetting and most people you talk to on the street are pretty disappointed with the way things have gone. I remember there was a bit of an uproar when they installed a needle disposal outside of the LCBO, people weren't too happy about that.

But as upset as people were over that, nothing can compare to how devastated the entire town would get whenever some new kid would die of a drug overdose. ""Did you hear about Steve? He was such a good kid. It's so sad"". Heck, every year, the entire town does fundraisers to honor Steve's memory because of how much everybody liked him. Yet he died of a heroin overdose at 25. There were at least 3 people I went to school with who are now dead, and each one was the same.

Safe drug sites suck. They're icky and gross. But they're better than the alternative. I've seen what happens when kids do drugs and die, I've seen how that affects small communities and I gotta say, it's a thousand times worse than how they react to things like safe drug sites. People are gonna do drugs either way. But if you help them do it safely, you can give them a chance to turn their lives around instead of overdosing and throwing their entire life away."

truegaming,ffh82uu,t3_etj7pf,1579925782.0,"Fishing sucks. I've never once in my entire life ever been excited by fishing in a video game.

It's just not fun. Walk up to water, wait until the screen shakes, press a button, catch a fish. Rinse and repeat until you get the fish you want.

Thankfully it's avoidable in most games, but every so often it isn't and it drives me nuts. It's the only achievement I'm missing in Terraria, and it's made worse by the fact you can only do one fishing quest per day, and by how annoying it is to find bait. It's also the reason I've never built a Cell Phone in that game.

I don't know how you would fix it to be fun. Sometimes you get a minigame (like I'm Stardew Valley) but even those are lame. I think fishing is just one of those things that doesn't translate very well into video game form. It's already a very uneventful hobby in real life."

My understanding from being new to the DIY pedal world is that people are upset because he would rip off other pedals, and then he would deny doing so and claim that his stuff was 100% original. And I've heard he would also shit on the DIY community for building their own stuff from schematics and layouts that people would share online. Basically hating on people for doing what he did, except worse because he was making a serious profit on it.

So it wasn't the stealing so much as it was the blatant hypocrisy.

Bass,ffh0ntg,t1_ffgxw5x,1579919952.0,"I subscribe to a few musicians on YouTube and it really depends. I find a lot of them come across as YouTuber first and Musician second. It's kinda hard to explain, and I know it's super dumb to say this but it's like their music often doesn't come across as ""real"" music. That sounds really snobbish as well, I know I know...

Like, I like Rob Scallons stuff. He's put out a lot of great music over the years. Much of it is very jokey or meme-y. But he has lots of great original stuff too. But when I see his stuff on Spotify, it's all just the same stuff from YouTube. I'd love to see him release original stuff that's *not* on YouTube, stuff that doesn't have a video attached to it. Give me an album of entirely new content to search out, maybe join a band. I don't know.

Don't get me wrong, I'll totally turn on YouTube and watch the crap out of his videos and enjoy every second of it. But they'll always be videos first and music second, and I can't seem to enjoy them without the video attached to it.

There are also musicians that I enjoy that also post the occasional YouTube video. But they're ""legit"" musicians who just happen to post to YouTube sometimes too. Musicians first, YouTuber second?

I also think having music in album form makes a big difference to me. I'm more likely to enjoy an album than a single song. I don't know why my brain feels like this is more real, probably because I've organized my music by album for such a long time. Many YouTubers have albums too but they always feel like a collection of songs from YouTube. To my brain. It's a movie soundtrack and not a real music album.

I don't mean to shit on YouTubers, they're all great and there's a lot of awesome content out there that I totally love. There's definitely something psychological to it but I'm not sure exactly what it is."

It's easier to see with white light, it's good for extending the daylight hours after the sun has gone down.

I think a lot of people want what's best for their own country. People usually have good intentions. But I also think that a lot of those ""good intentions"" are based on ignorance and intolerance. 

My father-in-law thinks that Muslims are trying to tear down America from within. He saw 9/11 happen and assumes that all the brown people are out to get us. I'm sure he means well, he wants America to be safe, but that opinion is based on some serious bullshit and doesn't deserve to be respected. Not even a little bit.  And as they say, ""the road to hell is paved in good intentions"". Everybody has good intentions. I'm sure Hitler had good intentions too.

I recently immigrated to America. My wife's sister is an immigrant to this country as well. Hearing my in-laws go on about how ""immigrants are ruining this country"" hurts.

In a way I know they're not talking about me (I'm white), but at the same time, they kinda are, and it's hard to respect that. I'm an immigrant, if you talk shit about immigrants, you're talking shit about me. 

Some people have definitely fallen for Trump for less harmful reasons. He's a ""successful"" businessman and people are into that. I personally think that's a joke, I think they've been swindled, but hey why not.... But I also think that too many people into him for the wrong reasons, like my family I mentioned above. It's those who have ""drank the kool-aid"" that get on my nerves. Their opinions are trash, the reasoning behind their opinions is trash too. Some opinions aren't worth respecting. 

That being said, yeah don't call people names. I think back to that black man who converted all those KKK members. He didn't do it by fighting them, he did it by talking to them and befriending them. He didn't force anybody to respect black people, he got them to respect them on their own by sitting down with them and showing them the wrongness of their ways... It's an uphill battle, for sure, but I think that's the only way we're going to get through this whole Trump fiasco. It's a very delicate situation, for sure."
