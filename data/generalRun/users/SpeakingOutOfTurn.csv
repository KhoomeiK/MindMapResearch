I honestly don't know how to deal with it or fix it. I've started googling ""breadcrumbing"" but most of the articles deal with it on a relationship basis rather than friendship."
offmychest,ffv0hpd,t1_fftph7r,1580252888.0,"Came here to talk about this as a friendship thing. I have a couple long-term friends who do this constantly. Every time I say I'm done with them, they get back in touch with a standard ""omg haven't seen you in ages, let's have dinner"". And then we do, and it's great, but it's always on their terms. If I suggest a get-together, I'm either straight out ghosted or there's a last minute cancellation or excuse.

Frankly, it makes me feel worthless and really messes with my self esteem. 

There's a comment above which names this as breadcrumbing - just giving you enough to get by and keep the relationship going. i've never heard the term before, but it fits the behaviour pretty much spot on."

AskReddit,ff4ha1p,t3_erhu3x,1579563581.0,"i dreamt that i was a professor of physics specialising in time travel, a leader in my field. My team was on the point of building a functioning time machine, and I was in close consultation with other teams working on the same project across the world. I, along with everyone else in my field, had been invited to an international conference in Prague on time travel. Unbeknownst to all of us, the conference had been organised by eastern bloc parties who wanted to take us all captive to harness our expertise. and they had already built a prototype machine. We staged our escape, but people, good people, on our side were killed.

At this point, I woke up and went to the bathroom. While sitting there, I worked out what we needed to do - take control of the time machine, go back in time and fix the problem. I went back to bed, fell straight back into the dream at the point I'd left off, then proceeded to put my plan into action. 

It was disastrous - we captured the time machine and went back, but not only did the plan not work, the result was far far worse. More people dead etc etc.

I got up and went to the toilet again. And this time while sitting there, came up with a plan to fix the situation - we had to go back further to do it, so it was tricky, very tricky...went back to bed, fell straight into the dream again, stormed the machine yet again and went back in time. This time the plan was executed perfectly and the day was saved.

End of dream. I woke in the morning, remembered everything. I only wish I'd written it down at the time so as not to forget all the details."
AskReddit,ff43e09,t3_erjgv2,1579554666.0,"The thought process is that it desensitises the player to ever increasing levels of violence and normalises behaviour that would otherwise be considered socially unacceptable, for example stealing private property and victimising or stereotyping certain groups of people (prostitutes, homeless).

Our average rainfall for January is supposed to be 211 mm (heaviest year was 820 mm in 1974 after Cyclone Tracy). Up until today, we'd gotten less than 10% of that amount. So this really is a miracle.
