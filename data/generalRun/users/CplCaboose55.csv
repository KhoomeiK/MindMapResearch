AskReddit,fg7mym8,t1_fg5tuca,1580596436.0,"Curb your admiration pls, I have ADHD. It was only doable by temporarily abusing my own prescriptions.

Vyvanse causes me to lose my appetite (a common side effect, the drug is also sometimes used in treatments for bulimia nervosa for this reason) and I had to use 10 mg Adderall instant release supplements if I needed to be awake for longer than 16 hours.

The drugs commonly cause excessive sweating and dry mouth, but less common is incontinence. The way I feel it is that after I'm done peeing I'll either a) feel like I'm not done but can't force it without extreme concentration, or b) I'll feel like I'm done and about the time I zip up and start to buckle my belt I can feel it coming back. I have dripped a little in my underwear before. What's worse is that because of the sweating and dry mouth I have to drink ungodly amounts of water. 

Now combine that with urinary incontinence.

My point being that the frequency that I was taking my meds in combination with everything else created a physically and psychologically miserable experience that lasted for about 3 months.

Sure I could've given up at any time or I could've said ""fuck that radiation lab report"" and gone partying, but tbh the only reason I didn't just give up all together is because I have a neuropsychological disorder whose treatment is paid for by my insurance. For now.

However, I'm still mostly certain it'll end up being contained after a little while, similar to the ebola outbreak with relatively minimal spread to other countries. At least I hope so. The difference is the milder symptoms than ebola, it could slip under the radar easier than ebola.

AskReddit,ffcjlna,t3_est2a7,1579800848.0,"In my undergrad engineering program I had been an underperformer academically. I enjoyed what I was learning but the college/school environment didn't work for me. Too bureaucratic, too concerned with numbers to get state funding, too much emphasis on gross memorization rather than practical learning (granted, a handful of my professors saw the same issues and frequently told stories unrelated to coursework because it was good wisdom; these individuals also stressed the importance of labs and were my favorite professors).

My senior year, rather than fall into senioritis somewhere in my head a switch flipped. I believe because my wife and I (engaged at the time) moved into our own place and had much more responsibility. I worked my ass off in my final semester, working 30-40 hours a week and averaging about 33ish and I had to take 18 credit hours to graduate on time. Factoring in time for studying I was left with no more than an hour of free time most days.

I hadn't bothered to calculate how many classes I'd need to make A's in to raise my GPA to a 3.0 because I figured it would bum me out.

In spite of being so physically and mentally drained I managed to pull a 3.26 GPA for my last term. I tried so hard and got so far that I made my highest GPA term in my whole university career.

But in the end it didn't even matter because my cumulative GPA was still around a 2.8 or something (turned out I'd need 27 more credits making an A in each class to break 3.0).

Fortunately, I believe it actually worked in my favor as it shows motivation/drive, maturity and growth.
