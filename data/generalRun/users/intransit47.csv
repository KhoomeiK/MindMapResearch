All the while, the Mayor and members of the opposition party in the U.S. were accusing the Trump Administration of slow playing aid to the stricken Island.  They knew supplies had been sent including generators to help with power restoration.  Initially, monetary aid was withheld due to concerns of corruption when P.R. officials could not account for millions of dollars in aid.  The promised aid was later released when control was assured.  Now, all of a sudden, P.R. administrators have ""discovered"" these supplies after the locals searched the warehouses.

If this discussion never came up, but you are satisfied with her explanation about this hard drive material and you still want to hold the marriage together, then her past is just that, her past.

Sometimes, when a couple realizes they made a mistake, they can work things out and have a pretty good marriage after a bout of infidelity.  Other times, you might wonder why the hell you thought she would change and you'll be right back where you started with the same problems.  Then there are the children.  I think its a big mistake to stay together just for the sake of the children because sooner or later, you will resent the your decision.  So, make a decision that works for you, tell her what you have decided to do and stick with it and don't look back.  Of course, make sure that you make a time and space for your children to be part of your life.  As for your wife, let your ex-friend deal with her.
