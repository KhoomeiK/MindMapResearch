cats,ff6cby9,t1_ff6azg3,1579624092.0,"Sadly, I am OP and I'm still worried. I was worried about it before our house burned. I walked in one day and tested the fire alarm without knowing how to turn it off and panicked all the cats. The thing of it is, the place may already be against regulations, and if I got the fire marshal involved, the place might get shut down, and the cats would have nowhere else to go. The place is already underfunded and undermanned. Volunteers come and go at random times, so half the time, there isn't even anyone there if there *was* a fire. It's between a rock and a hard place."
cats,ff6b1bw,t1_ff3g7th,1579623264.0,That's really admirable. I keep wondering if I did the right thing. I know there were several things I could have done before and during to change how things went. I just have to make those choices in the future.
cats,ff6akmm,t1_ff3t4ti,1579622970.0,"My wife's oldest cat was about 13. I always knew she would be crushed when it died, and then she lost it at the same time as 3 others. I'm surprised she has done as well as she has."
cats,ff6aay5,t1_ff42zwk,1579622796.0,"Please do. Of course we never thought this was going to come up, but then it did."
cats,ff6a7rg,t1_ff43esz,1579622740.0,"That's terrible! Did you find them all at the same time, or did this just keep happening?"
cats,ff6a3cz,t1_ff46ot3,1579622660.0,"That's the plan. Even now, planning for our new house, we're going to have failsafes in place, like a barrier to keep the cats from hiding under the bed."
cats,ff69yai,t1_ff46tzb,1579622568.0,"We really appreciate it. My wife prefers to confide in her remaining cats, though. I'm sure you understand. Losing pets in a fire is the worst."
cats,ff69rdb,t1_ff4cg42,1579622441.0,I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you.
cats,ff69q22,t1_ff4ch32,1579622418.0,"This scares me so much. My wife volunteers at a cat house, with hundreds of cats in cages. It worries me so much when I think of a house fire..."
cats,ff699dg,t1_ff4dqwa,1579622120.0,"Oh wow, that's incredible. My wife would love that. I'll put one together."
cats,ff68tmv,t1_ff4jcts,1579621839.0,"We completely agree. I grew up in that house, lived there the bulk of 30 years. Now that it has burned down, I don't really miss it. I just want my wife and animals to be happy and safe."
cats,ff66nyt,t1_ff4t0bo,1579620413.0,"That's very kind. The animal shelter my wife volunteers at has donated a massive amount of cat food to us, and we have half as many cats to eat it. We appreciate the thoughtfulness, though."
cats,ff66564,t1_ff54wzi,1579620059.0,"Honestly, that has been a big comfort. The firemen got them out before they got burned at all except for one, so we didn't have to deal with mutilated corpses too much. They really did a great job."
cats,ff65fhn,t1_ff563pz,1579619569.0,"Thank you. At that age, I'm sure they saw tons of love. That's all you can hope for."
cats,ff65coc,t1_ff593zm,1579619514.0,"That's rough. At a year, you normally think they'll make it. We raise foster kittens on occasion. You learn to not grow too attached to the really little ones, but sometimes you can't help it."
cats,ff6589v,t1_ff5rbad,1579619430.0,"I imagine you learned a good lesson, though. The more you feel panic like this, the less likely you are to let something bad happen."
cats,ff6542r,t1_ff5pogi,1579619350.0,She's doing much better now that they're all accounted for. Thank you.
cats,ff55w8d,t1_ff538i8,1579581121.0,"That's the best thing to do, imo. Don't kill yourself thinking about it."
cats,ff503tl,t1_ff3qtei,1579576663.0,"I hate that this has to happen to many people. I guess that's how you get perspective, though."
cats,ff4zzu7,t1_ff3r4zz,1579576581.0,It's so fast. I wasn't expecting that.
cats,ff4zxmd,t1_ff3svd7,1579576536.0,"We aren't supposed to advertise or the post will get removed, but if you want to PM me or my wife (u/noodle_brain), we can get you that info. We're really squared away with friends and family, though, so please don't give unless you can. Take care of your fur babies :)"
cats,ff4zjtw,t1_ff4bksa,1579576253.0,Cool name!
cats,ff4zboa,t1_ff4blzr,1579576087.0,"Having a plan is important, but so is knowing your risk. I didn't think ours was high. We had swept our chimney in '18. Apparently, though, they can get cracks, and need to be inspected periodically. Didn't even know that was a thing."
cats,ff4z668,t1_ff4w7gj,1579575978.0,"I really like this :) We like to think of ourselves as kind, and get annoyed with self-involved people. I think at this point, she and I are two sides of the same coin."
cats,ff4yt7o,t1_ff4fha2,1579575725.0,"[Here's](https://photos.app.goo.gl/WBCaKDiUdYEXzmds9) a link to an album. The gray cat was my wife's oldest cat, around 13 (died). The white long hair is our newest, he's my little man (alive). The fluffy black one is our smartest (alive). The black siamese was our outdoors cat (died). The white flamepoint was our skiddsish weirdo (died). The thicc tabby is Samantha, our sassy lovebutt (alive). The big orange cat was our neighbors that came to us (alive). Couldn't find any pictures of our longhair that died under the bed, and the last is pictured."
cats,ff4vh0e,t1_ff4mlnp,1579573413.0,"Haha she's already fine, just hogging food."
cats,ff4vajf,t1_ff4myci,1579573288.0,"My wife works at a foster home that has a couple hundred. I panic every time I walk in, just imagining the place going up when no one is there."
cats,ff4v7h6,t1_ff4n154,1579573230.0,"Honestly, we would be lost without friends and family. I can only imagine. I get nervous just being in another country without a tether. It must seem like hell."
cats,ff4uul9,t1_ff4ret2,1579572985.0,She is my wife. I'm really happy to be married to someone that feels things like this so deeply. I sometimes wonder if I'm even capable of it.
cats,ff4u2qs,t1_ff4romr,1579572463.0,"We aren't supposed to advertise fundraisers, but if you hit up me or my wife (u/noodle_brain) for info, we can let you know. Please don't give unless you're in a good position to do so, our family and friends have been very kind."
cats,ff3tinv,t1_ff3n6ns,1579548521.0,"Wow, that's brutal. We have our remaining cats to console us. That must have been the worst."
cats,ff3ne85,t1_ff3m79z,1579544770.0,Just appreciate her everyday. That's really all you can do.
cats,ff3nc3l,t1_ff3lzw7,1579544733.0,"I think she was a bit rough from being outside, but the eye recovered after a day. She seemed a bit skinny, but we have a creek that runs through our back yard she must have been visiting. We should have put up a trail camera to see if she was ever coming back to the property."
cats,ff3n882,t1_ff3lzng,1579544667.0,"Oh, wow. Just remember the seven P's, as they say: Proper prior planning prevents piss-poor performance. I really hope it doesn't come up, though."
cats,ff3n4km,t1_ff3lmvr,1579544603.0,"This was after a couple minutes. Her initial face was priceless, she wasn't smiling at all, just crying at the relief, but this one was excellent, too."
cats,ff3mx3c,t1_ff3l3s7,1579544473.0,"We're happy, too. She's a character. She has a scratchy, smoker's voice. Had it even before the fire!"
cats,ff3mus6,t1_ff3l0sa,1579544434.0,"These cats were the big loss. The stuff was just stuff, we'll get more stuff, eventually. We're starting from scratch, and honestly the house was a big point of tension for various family reasons, so in some ways, losing it was a good thing! I'm really just sad for the cats that are alive and still shaken from what happened. At least the others didn't suffer too much."
cats,ff3h1xa,t1_ff3dys1,1579540867.0,"We woke to the CO detector going off. The fire alarm must have gotten fried by the fire in the attic. I saw light coming from up *in* the chimney, and tried to shut the glass doors to the fireplace to smother it. I couldn't do it quickly, and heard something fall in the room behind the fireplace. Ran in there to find part of the ceiling had fallen in with flames coming out of it. Grabbed a fire extinguisher, tried to put it out, no luck. I told my wife to get the cats and get out. I grabbed one on the way out and threw him in a chicken tractor we had out back, and then got back in and grabbed 2 more near the back door and threw them out. I made sure the storm door was locked open so they could get out. My wife got a carrier and grabbed our 3 foster babies while I was doing this part, she locked the front storm door. Our smartest cat managed to make it out on his own with singed fur, whiskers, and paw pads. Another got found passed out, the ambulance gave her oxygen. One of the ones I threw out ran away (pictured), and we recovered the other three. Three had hidden under the bed, as they usually do during anything scary. One with anxiety problems probably panicked and stayed put near the fire, but still died of smoke. He got scorched and buried after, though.

Edit: I urge people sincerely worried about this to give it a practice run every once in a while. We had no idea what we were doing and panicked. Fires move incredibly fast. It took maybe 3 minutes from when we woke up to the point that smoke was too thick to go in."
cats,ff3fzph,t1_ff3erbi,1579540271.0,"Wow, I'm really surprised. Were they small dogs? I would think they'd make it out quickly since they aren't as much of hiders. I'm really sorry to hear that."
cats,ff3fr31,t1_ff3e6do,1579540137.0,"No. As bad as we felt, an entire continent is going through similar things. It's really terrible. Thanks for the well-wishes."
cats,ff3cbe0,t1_ff39cwt,1579538331.0,"Until now, I've always poked fun at this particular cat for being dumb, but she's had a tough life.

She showed up on our porch 3ish years ago. We asked our neighbor about her, and she said that her uncle in TX was selling his farm, and they were going to shoot all the cats unless she wanted them. She saved this one and another, but I don't know how many died. Then our neighbor told us we could have her because she seemed ungrateful to live with them since she was showing up at our house (really it was just because they had an aggressive dog.) We ended up with the other cat of our neighbor's because they went to a wedding over a weekend and forgot to feed him, so we started feeding him. It seems like, even when they were home, they would set food out for him that the dog was eating, but she assured us he was getting fed. He weighed 7 pounds when we found him, and now, without being fat, ended up at 14 pounds. Our neighbor started hating us for ""stealing her cats,"" but obviously we aren't too butthurt about losing her friendship."
WTFgaragesale,ff393bj,t1_ff38ut0,1579536581.0,I would never go to this person's house.
cats,ff391d1,t1_ff38ytt,1579536547.0,"She seems ok, just shaken up. Thank you."
WTFgaragesale,ff37i8k,t3_erbml7,1579535533.0,Holy shit this is my town.
cats,ff36xxu,t1_ff36q72,1579535150.0,"All of *my* cats made it out, but my wife had a thirteen years old she had before we got married that she lost, along with one that would hang out with her around the farm. She caught the brunt of it."
cats,ff36o18,t1_ff345g5,1579534962.0,"It was. I was certain she had been found by someone that just wouldn't call the numbers on the flyers, but I guess I was wrong. She had made it back to the woods around our house when we found her."
cats,ff36ikt,t1_ff33hpx,1579534859.0,Thanks so much. We're much better now :-)
cats,ff36gza,t1_ff33fgl,1579534829.0,Thank you. I'm just glad it was smoke that killed them and not the fire. A much better way to go.
cats,ff36f1c,t1_ff339l2,1579534793.0,"Me too. I love our cats, but it was obvious that my wife wasn't going to be ok until she had closure."
cats,ff36cfk,t1_ff33702,1579534744.0,"Edit: my wife said it might get removed if we leave the info up, so if you want to donate, pm me or u/noodle_brain . We really are flush with kindness at this point though, so please don't give anything unless you can. My wife's Reddit name is noodle_brain , if anyone wants to see the house. Keep your chimneys in shape, and get your cats out first. Don't try to fight the fire, and look under your bed for hiders. That's my most important message."
cats,ff35xoz,t1_ff335bz,1579534458.0,"We're doing much better. We received tons of donations. One cat with some anxiety issues was hard to find. He was buried under insulation in one room, separate from the others. My wife was torn up looking for him and the lost one, for closure. Now that they're out, we can shut the door on that house (not literally.)"
