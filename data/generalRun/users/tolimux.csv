In Brussels some costs (mainly energy efficiency-related) are partly subsidised depending on your income, energy rating of the materials used etc. Others, such as changing sanitary fixtures, are only partly subsidised if the house is at least 30 years old.

More info about this on [www.homegrade.brussels](https://www.homegrade.brussels).

I note however that the subsidies require going through an official contractor/seller which most often means higher prices of products than you could find in e g  Germany. Also there is the different VAT rate if you buy stuff yourself or let the contractor buy it for you (the latter enjoying a lower tax rate).
