I think they’ll bring back Erica, Demetres, Adam and Kaela. The theme is “super-sized” or whatever so I think they’ll be like “THIS SPRING... WERE BRINGING BACK THE BIGGEST... BADDEST... AND TOUGHEST PLAYERS EVER”"

stfuretard,ffsa1ay,t1_ffs9uqq,1580176790.0,"It’s not a requirement, obviously. Nobody is saying that the only thing that makes them laugh is a dead person. But I think it’s stupid to claim that it can’t be funny, or that it doesn’t belong on the internet. If a joke is funny, it’s funny. Doesn’t matter wether or not it’s disrespectful, in my opinion."
stfuretard,ffs8nj4,t1_ffruy8u,1580175845.0,"Imma be real with you, this post is boomer af and I apologize for the format

But there’s a line between “shitting on the grave” and making jokes about the situation. I’m obviously not defending the “hurr durr GTA V helicopter crash funi haha” posts, but I’m tired of seeing people crying about “hEs DeAd!! We CaNt LaUgH” on every tweet and post I scroll past."
stfuretard,ffs8bsd,t1_ffs7nv2,1580175619.0,"Tbh an stfuretard post was probably the wrong format but I saw the other one and felt completely opposite to the message

I don’t think anyone should ever be able to dictate what is funny and what isn’t, and shitting all over people who make light of bad situations is stupid as hell. Are you at the funeral? Are you with the victim’s family? No? Then it’s fair game. There’s a place for dark humour and the internet IS that place.

It’s just really annoying to see people act like you’ve slaughtered a newborn puppy when you make a joke about a dead celebrity. I didn’t even say anything, but the backlash people get for it is legit ridiculous in my opinion."

LucidDreaming,ffiq9w9,t1_ffiprho,1579980031.0,"I remember a bunch of moments where I proved that I knew I was in a dream.

The first time I was throwing a party at my parents’ house with a bunch of people from high school. The toilet ended up outside. I confronted this girl who was the last person I saw in the bathroom and she said that she didn’t do anything.

Later on (after waking up once or twice), I met her again. To confirm what was going on, I asked, “did I or did I not have a conversation with you about the toilet earlier?” Instead of answering, she TURNED INTO THE FUCKING WALLPAPER. Like as soon as I recognized her she blended into the background. Just gave me a smirk and faded into the wall. What the hell.

I also tried to fall backwards, because I heard that you can stop yourself in mid air when you’re lucid dreaming. I tried it, and just as I was falling back I felt pressure on my back, as if someone was trying to hold me up. I kept trying and trying but I couldn’t get myself to fall.

There was a door knob that I kept trying to turn but my brain wouldn’t let me.

The last thing I tried to do was fly, so I tried flapping my arms and even just imagining myself flying, but no avail. The best I got was low-gravity sinking to the floor.

It was unreal. I’m struggling to describe it."

MontrealEnts,ff51y7s,t1_ff51pza,1579578027.0,"1) I’ve never tried any of the MOMs but from what I’ve heard it’s definitely better than the SQDC. If you’re just looking for bud then Oka isn’t really worth the drive.

2) There are a bunch of really good Smoked Meat places on the island, Schwartz’ Deli is a favourite. I’m also a Dunn’s fan. Greenspot is probably my favourite diner in the city. Also get a beaver tail!"
MontrealEnts,ff50eov,t3_ernzyv,1579576883.0,"1) it’s SQDC or an online service unless you have a medical card. Just be warned SQDC tends to be expensive and not all that great. There’s also only 3 or 4 locations on the island so you’ll have to travel unless you go to the one downtown. Most strains are only in 3.5, some are in 7 and only one or two are sold in 15g packages. No ounces.

If you want edibles, concentrates or ounces, you’ll have to go to Oka. In my experience the drive isn’t that bad but I’ve heard they’ve increased police presence in the area recently.

2) I’m pretty sure you’re not allowed to smoke anywhere in public. But the general sentiment from cops is that as long as you’re using your judgment, they won’t bother you. Basically just don’t smoke while you’re walking down the street and don’t blow clouds in people’s faces and you should be good.

3) I don’t know a whole lot of places to go but Crescent is definitely your first stop if you want to drink. There’s also Arcade 3000 in that same area if you’re into arcade games. There’s also 2 movie theatres downtown if you’d want to see something. You also can never go wrong with a stroll in the Old Port, it’s really pretty especially in the winter."
