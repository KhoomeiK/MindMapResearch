Nothing is stopping him from doing so! Of course the tax code should change but I hate when rich people are like “I should have to pay more in taxes” when there is nothing stopping them!"

I know y’all hate Trump but if you make retweeting something a crime, alot of people, both on the left and right, are going to be in trouble."
