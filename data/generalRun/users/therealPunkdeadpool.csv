The reason I say ""mass produce"" is because more than one of the same exact item were made. I get that you're a small business and wanted to do a cool promotion and that's great. I hope your customers enjoy it. But you don't own the rights to that art/IP (nor do you have a licensing agreement with the copyright holder, I presume) and I doubt the original creator(s) is even credited in your work.

Please explain to me how stealing someone's work to mass produce a promotional item for consumers is criticizing, reporting, teaching or researching the art in question?

All uses of a copyrighted material is deemed infringement unless there is expressed written consent from the creator/copyright holder. It's what is known as a licensing agreement. This isn't an artist making alters, it's a business who mass produced these for promotion. Whether they make a single cent off it isn't the issue. You can't just slap someone else's work onto something you are creating to be distributed to consumers. That's theft."

magicTCG,fecga30,t1_fecdzfd,1578973198.0,"Sure but like the other person said, you're not taking into account ALL the advantages you get from an extra turn. Not only are you drawing an extra card for 2 mana, but you're getting another untap step, upkeep, attack step, land drop, 2 more main phases, an extra planeswalker activation, and an extra end step. All of that together, (imo) far outweighs the benefits of 3 cards off the top (likely 2 spells and a land, on average) for 1 mana. Also keep in mind that you at the very least get the time walk mana back on top of the extra land drop. There's honestly no downside no matter when you take the extra turn, (although I don't advise it being your turn 2 play)."
magicTCG,fec3w1s,t1_fec3hi1,1578966276.0,Yeah I was gonna mention that as well. The advantage of a second consecutive turn far outweighs that of a draw 3.
