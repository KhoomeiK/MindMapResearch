vegan,ffar3jf,t1_ffachzx,1579742520.0,No because they're fermented by yeast not bacteria. Yeast extract has plenty of other B vitamins naturally but B12 is added.
Agronomy,ff910zz,t3_esa270,1579702134.0,"[ERA5](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5) is a model and models are always wrong, so it's not surprising that the values don't match up with a weather station at the same location. I doubt that there is much you can do about this iff ERA5 is the best source of historic data you can find. Analysing the differences between the weather station and ERA5 data would at least give you some indication of how reliable the ERA5 data might be for another location where you don't have a weather station."
Homebrewing,ff6zw21,t1_ff6tm0b,1579638316.0,Yeah I can imagine that - the ratios on that byo recipe are for a lot of potato and to be fair you do need a lot if you are going to get a sizeable proportion of your fermentables from the potatoes. My mash was already pretty gloopy at 1:1 potato:barley so using more would be tricky. I didn't get the point of draining and mashing the potatoes and then having to boil more water which is why I blitzed it and went straight onto mashing. I did have loads of trub (5l in 20l) after a day but it has slowly settled out. Maybe I've stumbled on the secret to cloudy neipa though...
Homebrewing,ff6kr9b,t1_ff61hjj,1579629299.0,Disappointing how? Was it related to the potatoes or something else? Hope to hear more either here or in a new post!
Homebrewing,ff5uia0,t3_dg1fx6,1579610702.0,"Did you give this a go in the end? I've got a batch in the fermenter right now - I boiled 3kg of potatoes in 5l of water, blitzed it all up and increased to 10l, and added 3kg of Golden Promise. Mashed at 68C for 1.5 hrs. Was a bit sticky but after a couple of sparges I collected normal quantity of wort. Smells more like beer than potatoes at the moment. Will keep you updated!"

AskProgramming,fegmtck,t3_ep1mve,1579097496.0,"This should be roughly what you need. You will need to work out what you want in the ""do stuff"" bit, depending on what you are trying to extract from the files. This will only work well if your excel files are just a big table of data i.e. not lots of seperate tables in the same sheet. If the excel sheets are messy then you can use [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to read the files instead, but it will take more work.

collapse,fealc87,t1_fe8r4jd,1578950046.0,">The problem with monoculture is that it inherently lacks genetic diversity

This isn't really the case. Monoculture just means growing one species of plant in an area, rather than a mix, allowing them to be grown optimally and harvested mechanically.  Admittedly I'm not sure about oranges, but the problem comes when crops have low genetic diversity and therefore pathogens can overcome their resistance and spread rapidly. There's no difference in this respect between a crop grown in monoculture or not. On a landscape scale, you can have lots of monocultures but if they are different varieties that are genetically diverse then they are relatively disease resistant. If we could use GM resistance freely, then you could grow crops that were essentially genetically identical but have different resistance genes which would then prevent the spread of disease."

Edit: looking at [their website,](https://flashforest.ca/) the first time they dropped the seeds from the drone was in 2019, so obviously no data on survival rates."
