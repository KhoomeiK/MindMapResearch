However, your setup serves its purpose, but a lot of your heating issue and sound issues are related to it. If you ever can upgrade, a lot of your sound issues, heating issues, and electricity usage should be resolved, or at the very least, heavily helped."
cyberpunkgame,fedv46o,t1_feduoha,1579020540.0,"Just a heads up,  Based on a 500 watt PSU, you're losing about $21 a month if you were running at 100% load on a Bronze vs a Platinum.

&#x200B;

As for your sound, that sucks. I know some PCs can get really loud. I run a silent rig build, so it's quiet, though silent rigs are a tad more expensive. At most, it's a quiet white noise which is kind of relaxing in itself. Also, I'd do some testing on your open case vs closed. Open case means there's no forced airflow. Usually an open case is a lot worst than a closed one. Generally, a closed case means air is forced in one way (intake), goes over your parts, and is sucked out via your other fans (usually out the back). This causes a strict airflow that allows for cooling. If you have an open case, this air flow ceases to exist since the air getting sucked in just goes ""wherever"" in open air. This can cause some serious heating issues. Yours may be different due to crammed space, though. Like I said, test both options."
cyberpunkgame,fedtc6o,t1_feds7dm,1579019456.0,"Aye. Based on a 500 watt PSU, you're losing about $21 a month if you were running at 100% load on a Bronze vs a Platinum.

I mean, if you're concerned about long-term usage for those who would leave it on for an extended period of time, how about this:

Perhaps there could be an optional timer where the game would go into an idle state or shutdown after X amount of time passes for those who might use it to sleep to (or even shut down the machine, if that's possible). I have this option on my TV. I load up a ""relaxing video"" on youtube, and my TV shuts off after X amount of minutes where X is increments of 15 minutes up to 2 hours."
cyberpunkgame,fedsb07,t1_feds0fn,1579018824.0,"I edited this in in case you missed it.

 A bronze rated PSU will waste around 18% when at 100% load. Meaning if you have a 600Watt bronze rated PSU running at 100% load, about 108 watts will turn to heat. 

Here's a good list of efficiency ratings:

cyberpunkgame,fedrjhe,t1_fedrd95,1579018351.0,"Ah yeah. Bronze is pretty low on efficiency. Not sure what your budget is but I'd suggest never going lower than gold. Gold and platinum have a really good efficiency rating. Essentially has more control over how much electricity is used up vs wasted. Granted, you CAN run bronze just fine. Just bear in mind it'll be using more electricity.

As for your electricity bills, if you're getting massive electricity bills for just play games, I would suggest looking into another PSU. There are some good PSU units out there you can buy that help with efficient power, essentially only using what's necessary but still enough to handle games. They are a bit pricier, but you save electricity in the long run so they are well worth it. You definitely shouldn't be having huge electricity bills from playing games."
