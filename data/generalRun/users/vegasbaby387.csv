They'll gladly use any crash to blame the other party, no matter when it happens, and most of their followers will believe them.

I don't think they care if there's any semblance of order at all in the long run, and climate change makes extracting as much personal wealth/property the most rational decision for them.  If they have the cash on hand, they can buy it all up at a discount.   Normal people can't even get loans at that point.

It's all about ME AND MINE.  This ""Government"" is dead.  Hasn't done anything since the affordable care act, and probably won't given the partisan gridlock has only strengthened.

Edit:

 But there’s a reason. There’s a reason. There’s a reason for this, there’s a reason education SUCKS, and it’s the same reason it will never, ever,  EVER be fixed.

It’s never going to get any better, don’t look for it, be happy with what you’ve got.

Because the owners, the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now, the BIG owners! The Wealthy… the REAL owners! The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.

Forget the politicians. They are irrelevant. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice! You have OWNERS! They OWN YOU. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought, and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls.

They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying,  lobbying, to get what they want.  Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they don’t want: 

They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. Thats against their interests.

Thats right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and think about how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that!

You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork. And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shitty jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they’re coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? They’ll get it. They’ll get it all from you sooner or later cause they own this fucking place! It's a big club, and you ain’t in it!  You, and I, are not in the big club.

By the way, it's the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head with their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table has tilted folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care! Good honest hard-working people; white collar, blue collar it doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on. Good honest hard-working people continue, these are people of modest means, continue to elect these rich cock suckers who don’t give a fuck about you….they don’t give a fuck about you… they don’t give a FUCK about you.

They don’t care about you at all… at all… AT ALL.  And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. Thats what the owners count on. The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick thats being jammed up their assholes everyday, because the owners of this country know the truth.

There's also a huge number of people who think the news is ""all fake"", so they don't ignore the disparity.  They just decide everything is a lie, if it doesn't support their preconceived biases.  In fact, we've got a whole lot of people claiming to be ready to shoot at the Government in order to stop the ""fake news"""

Maybe a lot of people really like hanging out in Thailand, so they go every year and hang out.  I just know people that don't go to simply hang out or enjoy the Temples, it's not the prime draw."
IdiotsInCars,febt6cw,t1_febt18k,1578962400.0,"It's people I work with.  They go there to meet Thai women and engage in sex tourism.  It's not my fault they do that, and I don't really mind what they do but it is very exploitative so I'm gonna point that out lol."
IdiotsInCars,febrk7a,t1_febra5b,1578961898.0,"Well, I meant foreign money in general, I don't actually think every tourist there is an American.  I was just speaking from an American perspective.  It's really exploitative, that's why guys with money go there looking for women who want to come home with them and marry them.  To escape life as a slave to Thai Capitalism."
IdiotsInCars,febqsc2,t1_febpta0,1578961641.0,"Well, nothing worth doing to most people anyway.  The whole nation's based on exploiting poor Thai people to get that sweet ~~American~~ foreign dough.  I know a lot of guys who go there exclusively for that purpose.

Those bartenders need a union or something, because Americanized drink prices + their wages = holy shit."

I'm still pro-Bernie, because Trump is obviously not going to use that NATO money for Americans... but I don't think I'm completely wrong either."
SandersForPresident,fe5s6pr,t1_fe5s0db,1578873788.0,"It makes sense to me they'd be okay with Bernie, too, because their goal has been to stop NATO and Bernie has always railed against American Imperialism."
