A friend of ours was going through a very dark period and pulled multiple angry and self-destructive stunts that cast a pall on our wedding, which was really hurtful because we were all really close. A few months later, I was willing to forgive the friend, but for my husband the hurt was too deep and he still doesn't want to have anything to do with her. It's a very personal decision and there's no right or wrong answer.
