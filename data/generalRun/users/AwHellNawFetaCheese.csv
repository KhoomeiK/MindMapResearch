NintendoSwitch,ff9dkb0,t1_ff8mxue,1579710669.0,nuances like that aren’t expressed in a review that says “ this game sucks 0/10”
NintendoSwitch,ff8guc4,t1_ff86fyl,1579677877.0,Those types of reviews are usually retaliatory for something unrelated to the game being reviewed.
FallenOrder,ff6tif0,t1_ff6t1zx,1579634564.0,Yes absolutely. How else would you complete all the achievements after the story is over?
relationships,ff4ro2w,t1_ff4eayy,1579570808.0,"I second this, it definitely feels good seeing people who did you wrong suffer but the human thing to do would be to refer to this top comment. 

If you’re a decent person and don’t derive your happiness from the suffering of others, be the bigger person. 

Don’t get me wrong, it is hilarious and your reaction was reasonable, but the real power play is not being perceived as bitter over it."

worldnews,fduk8bt,t1_fdtsyuc,1578734205.0,"This is just the kind of dumb shit that happens when you’re on the cusp of war. 

If the US hadn’t begun attacking Iranian targets then they wouldn’t have had to retaliate/ be on high alert presumably causing this jet to be mistakenly shot down. 

The US has shot down civilian aircraft accidentally before too and we faced zero repercussion for it. It’s just a horrible and unfortunate byproduct of stoking war-like hostilities.

That’s why yes it’s good that Soleimani is dead, but the dumbfucks didn’t consider the collateral damage and consequences attacking another nation would manifest."
worldnews,fdtq1jq,t1_fdto7j3,1578720435.0,The results were unintentional. I see your logic but you’re just splitting semantic hairs.
FallenOrder,fdsfxmf,t1_fdsaar5,1578701886.0,For me: Malicos is all about closing the distance and hyper aggressive attacking (his ranged moves are harder to react to) while 2nd Sister was more way defensive keeping distance so you force her into more telegraphed attacks.

movies,fdjclae,t1_fdj1oon,1578465362.0,"Nah it’s more the mix (dialog vs SFX vs music vs backgrounds) which you can’t change levels relative to. 

IIRC Nolan likes to mix his movies where it’s not the easiest to hear details for some reason. It’s like some avant garde creative choice. Don’t think I’ll be able to locate the source for that but pretty sure I read that in an interview."

The sync is important because the interfaces need to be sample accurate with each other to no introduce what Is called Jitter into the recorded files. (Sounds like clicks or noise.)
