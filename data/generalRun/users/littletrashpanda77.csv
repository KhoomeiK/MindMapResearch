badwomensanatomy,fdyzh60,t1_fdxrwf9,1578785163.0,"See this post makes me think of my friend when she gave birth after she called me crying saying they ""cut her without asking"" about giving her an episiotomy. They didn't even tell her they were going to do it.  She was crazy upset (i would be too! A huge violation. ) as if she was going to tear she wanted to naturally."
dysautonomia,fdyxqa5,t3_endv6o,1578784640.0,Your temple veins are probably bulging because of your jaw flexion.  The joint of your jaw works out alot when you chew and it will tighten the muscles around your ears and temples and that will cause the veins to pulse.  If you clench your teeth you can feel the muscle tension in your temples.
