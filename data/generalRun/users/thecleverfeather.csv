adderall,ff4cj21,t3_erg43m,1579560407.0,Addy with lexapro is good. Wellbutrin will make you more stimulated. More sexual. More panicy. I think it would exacerbate the intensity of the Addy. Would definitely avoid all other stimulants like nicotine and caffeine. I think Wellbutrin also makes you drunker quicker.

politics,fevaun2,t1_fev52fb,1579395253.0,Because bernie is polling higher and if he tags her as VP people might just vote for him to make sure he wins the primary. It would sway voters who are unsure between him and warren to just go for him because they could run together and think he has a higher chance of winning based off polls. Looks like a strategy and I don‚Äôt know why they announced it right now.  As far as whether that makes him look less sexist it could go either way. It could in one regard but it also looks like he‚Äôs doing it disingenuously because he‚Äôs responding to everything that happened. Just bad timing.

ElizabethWarren,fehgicm,t1_fehcqhf,1579116061.0,"They have been complaining that the moderators were biased in their questioning about his sexist comment. 

This was my response:

I think CNN would have been slammed more for favoring bernie in that situation because he is not a minority running for president. Obviously warren has a disadvantage because she‚Äôs a female and trying to pretend that people aren‚Äôt prejudiced is absurd. Sure we should choose the ‚Äúbest person for the job‚Äù but that‚Äôs been the male argument for years to keep power. Whether if it‚Äôs true or not.. the story about what bernie said.. warren made her point that the distinct difference between her and sanders is she‚Äôs a female, period. And there has never been a female president for obvious reasons.

Keep in mind I‚Äôm not a warren fan but I have respect for her now after last night.

He said, she said. We needed to hear directly from bernie his side of that story. I think he did fine.. not sure why everyone is so insecure about it.

Edit: additionally I think saying that ‚Äúthe best person for the job‚Äù should be hired masks the disadvantage women have in the workforce. Women have to work twice as hard because male coworkers don‚Äôt want to train them as fairly as they train other men. Women are often assigned less ‚Äúimportant‚Äù jobs such as being button pushers in a welding shop rather than a fabricator or a manager. Women are often not hired over men because they can be a reliability to certain companies because of sexual harassment. Additionally they are fired or bullied out of the business when they speak up. We are all a collection of our experiences and women fundamentally have a harder time getting experience EQUAL to men.  So yes the likelihood for a female to not have the same experience for the job over a man is very plausible because the system is set up that way. However I know that women are stronger because of this and can handle failure easier and get back up to fight. His argument that identity politics should be ignored really shows his lack of empathy for minorities or perhaps lack of knowledge.. to give him the benefit of the doubt."

If you retain information well then you probably don‚Äôt need it. The med helps people who have trouble in school or focusing at work. If you‚Äôre not struggling then don‚Äôt pursue it.
