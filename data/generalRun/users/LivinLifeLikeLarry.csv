camaro,ffiu6iv,t1_ffirsyu,1579982814.0,"The trick is don’t slam on the brakes bc if the cop can actually see you he’ll clearly be able to tell if you slam on them because the front of the vehicle will dive down. Gradually apply the brakes to start slowing down to where it just looks like normal braking. If the radar is already locked on you then odds are you’re probably already screwed. Also if you’re braking and you see the cop and are about to pass them, let off the brakes so you’re brake lights aren’t illuminated. Even if you’re still going a little over the speed limit, it will be harder for them to know if it was you or not if they hadn’t actually seen you with their own eyes. If you pass while on the brakes it’s kinda incriminating yourself because then they’ll know you were going fast and are trying to slow down before they can catch you."
