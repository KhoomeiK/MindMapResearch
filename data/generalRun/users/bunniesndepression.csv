AmItheAsshole,fc94m9w,t3_egqb3p,1577546952.0,"NTA. Rabbits are a HUGE responsibility, and in general cost more than cats or dogs. Their vet bills are more than double a cat or dog’s because they are “exotic” animals. Rabbits MUST be fixed ($400-600) or else they will develop life shortening, painful cancer + have tons of behavioral issues due to stressful hormones. Rabbits also need to be kept indoors. They are prey and do not do well outside. They need tons of room to run and play, as well as toys to keep them busy, just like a puppy. You cannot keep them in a cage. It’s extremely abusive to do so imagine keeping a Great Dane in a closet 24/7 because it can lay down, turn around and take two steps each way? It’s awful. Rabbits require 1/4 cup of high quality pellets(1x a day), 1-2 cups of fresh vegetable(1x a day), and fresh Timothy hay available 24/7. A rabbit is not a gift. Please take it and turn it over to you local
