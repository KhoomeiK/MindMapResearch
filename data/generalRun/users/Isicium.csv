but did they take it as badly as you feared?"

mentalillness,fdmx4g0,t3_em6h7k,1578569784.0,"if you need medication you have all the right in the world to get therapy!
who gave you the medication? your family doctor? usually it‘s the other was around (at least in my country): you well your family doctor you need help, then they send you to therapy and first they talk to you and THEN maybe you‘ll also get medications
(unless, of course, you have severe hallucinations or the like, then they might start with medications right away)

and about the self-harm ... that‘s not a symptom everybody experiences. some people who are getting serious help because they are very far from ok don‘t self-harm

don‘t worry - you have all right in the world to get therapy if you wish to do so!"
SuicideWatch,fdkecuj,t3_elqpgf,1578502076.0,"hey there ... I completely understand your struggle!
how do you feel about telling them half of the truth? I mean, you don‘t neee to tell them you‘re suicidal. maybe tell them you are feeling very low, depressed, you don‘t know what to do ... then, they can help you. and it might help you with the suicidal thoughts although you didn‘t tell them"
mentalhealth,fdbewfg,t1_fdakljp,1578256695.0,"no, you‘re not difficult ... I totally understand what you mean and why you‘re struggling with this! 
do you listen to music when you‘re down or even suicidal? for me, personally, it doesn‘t help much but I have heard from others that it can do a lot"
mentalhealth,fdagd6o,t3_ekfoxp,1578245754.0,"hey, I have been wondering the same for some time ... but since you‘ve told two people I guess this means talking helps you or at least you somehow get the desire to talk? so, do you have some people you can call when you feel so bad? just talking ... might not even take a long time
I understand your point about not going to the ER because - what for? but when you talk to someone and it helps you you are also not taking the place of people who are also waiting for treatment at the ER ... do you know what I mean?"

SuicideWatch,fd0m38s,t1_fd0gew7,1578120724.0,same here with me ... I hope you and OP will get another chance with someone even more amazing than the person who has just rejected you ... someone who is worth being with you. it is very hard to believe that now and probably the frustration and sadness is stronger ... but I am thinking about you two and I am wishing you all the best!
aww,fcwewna,t1_fcv9619,1578023867.0,"yes, that‘s what I meant ..."
aww,fcv8jq4,t1_fcv5x5h,1577996874.0,was thinking the same ... but probably OP didn‘t mean that both were born three days ago but maybe let‘s say both are a month old on the photo and back then when they were born it was three days apart ... do you know what I mean? I am still no expert and maybe it‘s still impossible but just thinking ...
mentalhealth,fcuuise,t3_eiutmq,1577988786.0,"hey there,
I am sorry you‘re feeling this way!!
I am not sure but it sounds like you need to process that recent event somehow that got you into it again ... is there any way you can address that? with anyone? or here with us?"
SuicideWatch,fcpggd7,t1_fcocpeo,1577862911.0,"are you able to formulate what kind of help you want? if yes, tell them they‘re currently not doing what you need. like this, they can try something else or send you to someone who can offer other kinds of help. it‘ll be totally fine for them if you tell them they‘re currently not helping you, it‘s their job and they have certainly already heard this from others.

if you just feel like what they‘re doing is not helping but you cannot formulate yourself what you need, I think you should tell them as well. then, it is possible that they will try to help you find out what exactly you need or they might immediately try something else. as a third option, it is possible that they will tell you to be a bit patient - and I think that could be a fair point as well. medication, for instance, doesn‘t solve your problems as soon as you start taking them. the positive effects might kick in after a few weeks only ... so, what I am trying to say, if right now you don‘t feel like this is helping you at all, maybe you need to continue a bit before drawing a definite conclusion

I know this all sounds simple and is probably not satisfying for you - but you need to be a bit patient in the beginning. and remember: the steps to improvement are very, very small, it takes time! 
and make sure to TALK to the professionals offering you help. they need to hear a lot from you to determine how to help you

stay strong!"
mentalillness,fcnkwno,t3_ei48i0,1577813520.0,congrats! stay strong and don‘t lose hope when they don‘t cause wonders after a few days - it might take several weeks for positive effects to kick in - just keep that in mind. all the best!

mentalhealth,fcl5imv,t3_ehryps,1577740255.0,I think this is a good idea!
SuicideWatch,fcl5b1e,t3_ehr472,1577740128.0,"hi Shannon!

I am very sorry to hear this - and that you‘re (so far) not feeling better after the attempt (I mean, some people do, that‘s why I‘m saying it)

what kind of support are you getting now that you‘re out of hospital?"
SuicideWatch,fcjpouc,t1_fcjjnhv,1577698360.0,"„no real good reason to do it“ ... I don‘t mean to be disrespectful at all, I understand that, for outsiders including yourself, the reasons might not have been visible and you could not feel it. but for him, it was just horrible and the only way he saw to get out of it and to make it stop was to kill himself - so, given all the pain he felt, he had a good reason. you cannot say he didn‘t have a good reason just because others could not see or feel it
if he was depressed and he didn‘t want to seek help, maybe his self-esteem was at such an extreme low that he thought he is not allowed to seek help because he us not worth it or a waste of time. if you‘re deep down in that shitty thinking, suicide is a „good“ reason to opt for to just end the suffering ... also when others don‘t understand it"
SuicideWatch,fcjphmy,t3_ehirbe,1577698080.0,"for me, it would be exactly the same thing like for you!"
SuicideWatch,fcjjvj0,t3_ehhswh,1577690511.0,"I am sorry you have also felt like this for such a long time ... so, you‘re mentioning events where it could have started. That means you think there were triggers for it?
I am just asking because I remember I have felt suicidal at 4 for probably the first time but it was in a situation which was totally all right, at home and my father giving me some fruit to eat ... and I have felt it ever since but there us absolute no freaking reason for me to feel that way!
sorry for asking about myself although it‘s your post .... but have you been actively or passively suicidal since childhood?"
mentalillness,fcf0d9l,t1_fcewyf4,1577625415.0,on what exactly? you are describing symptoms that make one assume there‘s a range of challenges you‘re facing or a variety of questions you‘d like to ask or different sorts of advice you need
mentalillness,fcenqb2,t1_fcdp1dc,1577622121.0,good ... and is there any specific help you‘re looking for here? like some advice you need right now or you think might be easierr discussed here than with a professional?
