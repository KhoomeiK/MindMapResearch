college,ffam3cx,t3_esffqp,1579739146.0,"I just met some people I hung out with a lot, one in the game room cause I'd be there often and one of a similar culture to mine, but most of my friends came from a club, anime club in case you're interested.

2 club meetings a week, every week for half a year and you have some good friends. Also, people you have multiple classes with.

Basically, if yoy hang out with them more, and you have something in common, you can become good friends with enough time."

HomeworkHelp,fe3o6ef,t3_ennyp5,1578851238.0,"Alright, so now that you have the white area, to get blue just solve for the 2 trapezoids, which is 18+22=40/2=20×3=60 and 2 of them so 120 cm2.

The central shape, if you draw a horizontal line from the tip of the triangle to the other end of the flag, you actually get 2 trapezoids that look like mirror reflections. Their dimensions are, if im not wrong, 14 for the long side and 12 for the short, since its half as tall, so instead of 14+10 its 14+12, halfway. Thats 26/2=13×1.5, its 1.5 because we split in in half lengthway, so =19.5, and 2 of them so 39 cm2.

Total blue area turns out 159 cm2,add the white area you get 259.8 cm2. Total area of rectangle is 22×15=330 cm2, so to get red subtract everything thats not red from total area, so 330-259.8=70.1 cm2.

Double check my maths just in case I got it wrong, and im not sure if the shortest side actually is 12, but check it in the answer guide. Hope this helps. My teachers were always fond of making shapes where we have to creatively break them down into actually possible problems."
