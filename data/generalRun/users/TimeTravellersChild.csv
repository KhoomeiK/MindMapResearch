offmychest,fezcz03,t3_equz9j,1579456036.0,"I was in your girlfriend’s situation a long time ago, and told my BF as well.  Getting raped is a mind-fuck like no other.

Here are some of the things that went through my mind at the time, in case it helps you process things (and I want to acknowledge that many of these thought processes are *clearly* inconsistent, illogical and wrong, but I couldn’t see that at the time):

- I worried whether BF would go all [Charles Bronson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bronson) on me and be hell-bent on getting revenge, or causing more damage because *he* felt bad - it wasn’t about him, and I didn’t want him co-opting what had happened and making it all about him

- I worried that I would be tainted in my BF’s eyes, and that he wouldn’t want to ever love or touch me again

- I worried that my father would be disappointed in me for failing to be virtuous

- I was sure that because I didn’t start with “no”, that the rest of what happened was my fault, and I deserved it because I was clearly a horrible person 

- I wanted to hide in a closet so no one could see me ever again - I was *sure* that people could tell by looking at me what had happened and also that I had very clearly brought it upon myself

- I believed that if I ever spoke about what had happened, I would be acknowledging my failure as a “good female”

- I believed that the man who raped me didn’t deserve to be punished because I didn’t start with *no*

- I believed that I was failing other women because I couldn’t bring myself to take legal action against the rapist

- I **knew** if I did try to take legal action against my rapist that it would like fail - there were no witnesses and it was he-said/she-said ... I couldn’t face that (and that was yet another failure)

- I cried because I knew I had to talk about what had happened, but talking about it would make it real, and would trigger my people to revile me or be disgusted by me, and I had no idea how to manage both the rape and the possibility of being ostracized - this was a huge mental disconnect that froze me completely up

I put a lot of really bad coping mechanisms in place to avoid dealing with the issue.  

I didn’t get therapy because I didn’t think I deserved it. 

I didn’t start trusting others or myself until decades afterwards because I didn’t know to get proper help in the beginning or anywhere else along the way.

Here’s what would have helped me:

- having my people say “OMG, what happened to you is worse than appalling - it’s criminal - and I am so sorry you were put through that” (acknowledging the reality of what had happened, expressing sorrow, and not converting it into *their* issue - much later, someone who loved me said “I’m so sorry for what was done to you”, and it was like a weight had been lifted from me

- being told that if I didn’t want to pursue legal action, I didn’t have to, and that that would be okay

- having BF say some version of “the only action I am going to take without your permission is getting you to therapy; the rest is your choice”

- getting therapy right away - even if my BF had just made an appointment for me and gone with me to set the scene for the therapist, and then left the room, that would have helped immensely... if he’d insisted that I go back again and again for as long as the therapist thought I needed the support (so I didn’t let my desire to prove I didn’t deserve help win out), that would have gone a long way to reminding me that some7who loves me thought I was worth rescuing

- learning how to identify and negate incorrect self-talk ([The Work, by Byron Katie](https://thework.com/) helped me immensely with that, along with the talk therapy 

- learning to use language properly so the blame and responsibility stayed where it belonged - I didn’t cause someone to rape me.... someone raped me.  I didn’t cause someone to lose control... Someone committed a crime against me.

I don’t know whether you can see your way past what was done to your girlfriend.  You should get therapy for this as well, so you can learn how to process your own feelings and thoughts.

If you can do it, simply spending time with her (not necessarily touching) might help her get past the incorrect belief that she is unworthy of love.

I send you love.

Please go straight to therapy for both of you. Don’t waste decades like I did trying to avoid it in the hopes it would just go away.

Sorry for the lengthy post."

- [Adverse childhood experiences](https://acestoohigh.com/got-your-ace-score/): new information about how childhood trauma affects our mental and physical health, and how to start putting some changes in place that might help

pics,few49t3,t1_fevvrml,1579405156.0,"Of course... main small bugs and crawlies are:

- silverfish occasionally in Vancouver 
- potato bugs occasionally throughout the country
- black flies and mosquitos in summer wherever there is permafrost 
- roaches in Toronto and Montreal
- daddy long leg spiders in most places
- fleas on all the large beasties
- ticks on all the damned deer
- no-see-ums in the summer in the wild
- leeches in way too many lakes
- Canada geese if you consider them vermin
- rats and mice, of course
- the odd garter or rattle snake

Those are the wee beasties who will annoy the shit out of you (and sometimes take chunks out of you).  They all have a fairly short season, and are generally very easily ignored.

While they’re all annoying, none are deadly, nor will any of them cause you any real problems on a regular basis (except the ticks with Lyme disease).

The big boys are the ones you want to watch out for... bears of all sorts, monster moose, elk, cougars and other big cats, mountain goats & sheep... and all the truly frightening things in the seas."
