Brady/Belichick don’t count in any of these arguments, they are the greatest QB/coach combo of all time if you have to mention them that’s an argument for Wentz.

Cam Newtown has always been overrated I don’t get your point bringing him up, he never had elite WRs but he’s not that great so what’s your point?

Dan Marino is probably a top 5 QB of all time what is your point?

But I’ve seen what he can do with good weapons in 2017 and an legit downfield weapon week 1. With Desean and another outside threat like the chiefs have no doubt in my mind he will shoot to the top of others lists. It’s easy to adjust QB rankings week by week or year by year you just go off of current stats and games apparently disregarding the surrounding cast, imo Wentz is legit elite and it will show assuming outside threats are healthy/brought in. QBs don’t win on their own, period, and outside of the Brady Belichick combo they don’t win with subpar or changing weapons every year unless we are talking an elite defense.
