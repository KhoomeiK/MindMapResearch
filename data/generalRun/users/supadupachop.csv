cats,fffd761,t1_fff95f8,1579881374.0,Thank you. I'll find a way to take him to a vet
cats,fff7yl4,t1_fff7mv2,1579877976.0,"That didn't occur to me. He has been acting skiddish and wierd, doesn't cuddle with me like he used to.  

My roommate told me the cat clawed him and that he wanted to throw the cat across the room. Is it possible he abused the cat you think?"
cats,fff7p5v,t1_fff6rdh,1579877797.0,Hmm. He's a little better taken care of and I had a roommate move in. Was working so much before his feeding schedule wasn't regular etc. Now he's fed on a consistent schedule and I've started giving him treats etc.
homeless,fff725a,t3_et4rze,1579877355.0,I wish I could afford this kind of thing to help homeless people too
