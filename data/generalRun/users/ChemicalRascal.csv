* They've received the first ""white copy"" from Panda (version with no art, basically) and they're happy with the felt, box thickness, and such. ""There are also a few things we want to work on"" -- tokens are maybe too thicc, Grimoire clips aren't discrete enough.

* ""The most likely projected delivery time at this point is late August 2020"". Worth reading this in full, but in short this appears to stem from art/design and rules delays. The update has more details and far more discussion, so maybe read it before jumpin' to conclusions.

* You can still update your shipping address via CrowdOx, their pledge manager: ""We'll notify you when the deadline is approaching for locking in your shipping address, which won't be for another few months at least given the stage of production we're at. If you have any issues with updating your address, please contact us at storyteller@bloodontheclocktower.com and we'll see what we can do.""

* Fewer rules updates over Christmas 'cuz Christmas be Christmas, only outstanding thing is clarifying timing re. drunkenness and poisoning.

* BOTC in Mexico!

* 2020 conventions presence expectations: PAX East and PAX Unplugged confirmed, UK Games Expo maybe-but-unconfirmed, ConCon (Sydney, March 28) yes. Origins and GenCon no, but other folks might be running BOTC anyway.

* Two Vancouver playthroughs going up on YouTube soon, and there's a playthrough up on Dicebreaker's channel as well."

> It's entirely about community adoption of that project, whether the project meets that community's standard of quality and whether the community as a whole should continue endorsing it.

See, I'm not inclined to agree -- that's not what the author of the post described. What the author described was alienation. Certainly, the author of `actix-web` _has_ been alienated from the community, and that surely is the result of actions from the community that alienated them.

People aren't allowed to build skyscrapers for fun, with a ""lol who cares this is a personal project"" attitude. But that's exactly what open source _is_ all about. If a library is someone's fun side project, then it's someone's fun side project. It's allowed to stay that way, because people aren't living in the code.

I get what it's like to be on the other side. My workplace uses a JS bundler/minifier that is underpinned by a library called ""NUglify"", the author of which effectively stopped bothering to update the library in about 2015, or thereabouts (they're still taking PRs, but not doing active work on the library themselves). So there are huuuuuuge swaths of modern JavaScript that we, as a business, cannot use. Like `let` and `const`.

And anyone who works with JavaScript on the daily would be able to tell you how much of a pain in the ass it is to not be able to use stuff like that.

And it sucks, but it's not NUglify's author's fault. If anything, it's on us for not looking into our tooling and contributing back up. But even if the author wasn't taking PRs at all, maybe they decided to eschew computers entirely and become a monk in Tibet or whatever -- it's not their fault.

Because open source isn't about holding people liable. It's about letting people do interesting things with software and sharing it. In turn, it's about letting people do what they please. If I want to write `actix-web` and make it particularly unsafe, not only can you _not_ stop me, you _shouldn't_ because that's not what open source is about. But if you really want `actix-web-safe`, you're free to do it yourself, because that _is_ what open source is about.

Today, the Rust community didn't evacuate people from an unsafe tower. They alienated a developer, and that's _all_ they did."

It doesn't motivate, and shouldn't motivate, _anything_ to do with ""clean code"" at all. Because the refactor in the example he gives is a _good_ refactor. It's the sort of deduplication and abstraction a dev _should_ aim to do.

And instead his take-away is that devs _shouldn't_ aim to do that. That's what he's also trying to promote, by writing the blog and using that example.

But again, the example is one that justifies the refactor. It's not merely textbook, it's the sort of thing I'd expect to see in Programming 101 courses, where a professor grabs someone's assignment submission and says ""ok so this all works, but let me show you why abstraction is good and duplicated code is bad"".

Again. He had a bad experience at work and took away the _entirely_ wrong lesson. And that's a problem, because he has a blog, and influence."

But he's also extremely arrogant, and bold enough to assert well-known best practices are wrong based on rather shaky grounds. And either way, he _is_ a young dude with his whole career ahead of him -- which is why it's unfortunate to see him close himself off to conventional wisdom now, rather than in that grey-bearded guru stage we all secretly hope to reach one day."

programming,fe17zmp,t1_fe0dgme,1578823528.0,"So... I think 2742 was being sarcastic here. A key point being that the author (and this is again more obvious on his twitter) _still_ thinks he knows better than everyone else, and takes such an authoritative stance on the issue.

Think about it in this context:

* The author believes he knows best, to the point that he just goes and fucks with someone else's unfinished feature (yes even though it was committed to `master`, I agree, hurrrrrrk);

* The author developed this belief based on the conventional wisdom taught in pretty much every decent CompSci/Software Engineering course out there, and the conventional wisdom that is very much supported by the dialogue within the industry;

* The author had a negative experience at work due to his actions;

* The author now states that he knows best, and the industry is wrong, to the point that he now crusades publicly on his blog and on Twitter against [what he refers to as a cult](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1216067406319312896). (Admittedly probably because alliteration but funny wordplay isn't an excuse to be a dingus.)

The author thinks very, very highly of himself. Which is unfortunate, because the author -- admittedly, like _my_-self -- is barely at the start of his career\*, not a grizzled veteran of the industry.

\* (You can identify people at the start of their careers by how have a Twitter account and get highly opinionated about coding practices. On top of being slim and having a full head of non-white hair.)"
programming,fe15la4,t1_fe0yg0c,1578822746.0,"No, that's not true. That's cop-out bullshit from people who like glib, smug answers and don't want to be held accountable for their shitty development practices.

Code that hits master should either be finished, or commented to indicate that it isn't. Development should ultimately aim to take the current state of any given functionality, and bring it in line with use-cases (or however one views the ""goals"" of the program), at which point that functionality is finished.

If you honestly feel that your code is never finished, and you're _constantly_ revisiting your code, you're either suffering under unclear, constantly shifting aims, goals, and use-cases (in which case you have my commiserations, comrade, and one way we will rise to defeat our managers)

_Or_

You're a shit dev and you need to step back and design your functionality before you write it."

I don't recall criticism for his role in BR'49 at the time, either -- kind of feels like the stories that came out around SSquad made people think he's a nutter and folks are going back and looking at his intensity in 49 in that new context.

Which sucks, because he was great in 49."

javascript,fdyschs,t1_fdwpdln,1578783072.0,"Alright, so, this is mostly based off my own path -- I cut my proverbial teeth at uni, so, uni courses are good, right? Flawless logic.

The best way, in my opinion, to learn data structures and algorithms is to learn C, and then learn how to implement those data structures and algorithms in C. The rationale being that C pretty much has nothing in the way of built in data structures, beyond literally structs and blocks of memory they call arrays, so if you want something you'll be implementing it yourself. In implementing it yourself, you're very much forced to understand how it works, and if you screw up the implementation it's not gonna work.

On the other hand, any language is usable if the user in question isn't exploiting built in implementations. (Like, if I ask you to implement a linked list and you just use a built in implementation, well, you haven't learnt how linked lists work.)

So, to do that I'd recommend either online courses or some sort of textbook. Something that takes the time to lay out how something works, explains to the viewer or reader how to think about something, guides through the concepts, and then has a selection of exercises for you to develop your own understanding.

I think Stanford has online courses for free, but I didn't go to Stanford so I can't personally vouch for them. On the other hand I would be utterly stunned if Stanford offered anything other than high quality courses."

Hash functions, being non reversable, are not a form of encryption. Hash functions are a one way mapping.

The inclusion of a sort of key does not make a process a form of encryption. What you're referring to, HMAC, is signing.

Using cryptographic hash functions and calling it encryption is like cracking an egg into a bowl and calling it a cake. Cakes involve eggs. Eggs are not cakes."
