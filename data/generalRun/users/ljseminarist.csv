Showerthoughts,ffjikjq,t1_ffjdfhb,1579999015.0,"There is plenty of opportunity now to self publish, including completely free online. What keeps most self published authors from the public is not some gatekeeper who tells the public: don't read that trash. There are enough contrarian types who would read anything to stick it to the man. What keeps them down is the lack of any notice, positive or negative. And if you don't get readers, you won't get more readers, you won't get feedback and your skill won't develop."
Showerthoughts,ffj96bb,t1_ffip1ys,1579993392.0,"Speaking of self-publishing authors, I don't think it's the pompous gatekeepers so much as the readers themselves who are the authors' undoing. If I get a book to read, I am investing time and possibly money into it - I will never just pick a random book out of hundred thousands, because I don't want to spend my life wading through random trash. I need someone's recommendation - not necessarily a critic or an editor, a trusted friend is enough. But the friend must have found this book somehow and he used the same process for his reading selection. That's how the Matthew Law works."
Showerthoughts,ffj8h3b,t1_ffip1ys,1579992953.0,"Nobody is born with a skill of a great writer, though some are born with the potential. Anything great takes a lot of learning. But you cannot learn to do anything well without feedback. Not baking, not arithmetic, not anything. It doesn't have to be some official person, but it has to be someone well-read, if you are talking about writing. And one person is not nearly enough, unless you want to please just this one reader. A writer needs an experienced reading public to improve his craft even more than he needs critics and editors. If you do something strictly by yourself your work will only please yourself."
Showerthoughts,ffi3fyr,t3_etmq7u,1579963963.0,"This will get buried (ever thought how many great, insightful comments get buried?) but: no. If you made an argument that there must have been millions of potentially talented people who never got a chance to develop their talents - you would be probably right. 

But nobody writes a masterpiece on their first, second or third try. Look at first productions of any great novelist - Tolstoy, Twain, Dickens - you can almost always see that the talent is there but it is never *great*. Because creating a literary masterpiece requires a lot of writing experience - and a ton of feedback. From editors, critics, readers, other writers etc. This is what an unpublished writer never gets."

He never said the words are pretentious themselves, just that they are used to dress up simple statements etc. Just like there are plenty of situations where lab coat is necessary and appropriate (i. e. in the lab or a hospital), but sometimes an actor wears one in a lip gloss commercial just to make it look like a doctor's recommendation."

VintageMenus,fehwce2,t1_fehonz6,1579125166.0,"It seems it was a hotel. At the time a lot of hotels included the meals into the price of your stay, and they were served at set times on a table d'hote principle - i. e. everybody would sit at long tables loaded with different foods and help themselves to whatever they liked or whatever they could grab before someone else grabbed it. Dickens in 'American Notes' and in 'Martin Chuzzlewit' left unflattering descriptions of hotel guests running to the dining room at mealtime and trying to eat as much as possible as fast as they could."

If midlevels get that ability, I can see them becoming practice owners of course, but to what purpose would they refuse to hire doctors if the reimbursement and salaries are the same? That won’t make business sense. “Look at my wonderful clinic that has no doctors” doesn’t sound like good advertisement."
mildlyinteresting,fefkxwd,t1_fefivxt,1579058524.0,Yes it is. The building is in Brighton (a Boston neighborhood). I only found mentions of the company in documents from the 1890’s. This is most probably the time the house was built - it is fairly typical for the late 19th century. The picture was taken today. Looks like they are gutting it.

medicine,feejcxs,t3_eodpsv,1579034930.0,Equalizing reimbursement will lead to equalizing salaries pretty fast. The very active NP/PA professional organizations will make sure of that. Then the playing field will be truly level. And the employers will have a choice of hiring an MD or an NP for the same job with the same salary. I think the consequences may be interesting.
medicine,feeicer,t1_feegjlv,1579034343.0,The patient committed a violent crime that hasn’t been solved (i. e. the patient has not been identified as the perpetrator and arrested for his crime). To solve the crime (identify and apprehend a violent criminal) the information you possess is needed. I think this gives us a permission to disclose such information.

aww,fea1baq,t1_fe2o45v,1578943296.0,"I don't see how this is supposed to work. Imagine that you made it into a law. Only ones allowed to breed dogs are registered, professional breeders. 

In 10 years the great majority of today's dogs are dead. We no longer have to worry about backyard or amateur breeding. The only source of new dogs are registered professional breeders. Professionals breed dogs for a living. They are only going to breed purebred dogs or designer crossbreeds that bring money (so mostly the breeds currently in fashion). No more mutts then. This, as far as I can see, has two consequences.

Puppies become much more expensive, because you can only buy a purebred/designer puppy from a licensed puppy farm. There will be fewer people who can afford a puppy. Now you can of course adopt a shelter dog, but the shelter population will be also drastically cut (isn't that the purpose of the law?). 

Genetic diversity of the dogs as a species in this country will be severely reduced. 

So fewer dogs in general, less affordable and less genetically diverse.

You must have read how the Kennel Club strict breed standards lead to development of unhealthy traits in purebred dogs (e. g. English bulldog), because breeders tried to produce puppies with exaggerated characteristics. If this kind of law was adopted 100 years ago, we would *only* have that kind of dogs, because it wasn't backyard breeders and amateurs responsible for this crisis - it was the professionals."
