Exactly, it's maddening how people can pretend that Reaganism wasn't widely popular in America, when it denied Democrats the White House 3 times in a row. That kind of hold over the electorate requires some kind of strategy.

We can see the situation in real-time in the UK, where conservatives are enjoying a 4 election victory streak, increasing their vote-share each time (unheard of for a governing party), but many are in denial that the country is not as left-wing as it is in their imagination."

Then 2 years after his election, he lost the house. So if you add it up, the actual time he could pass legislation (without input from Republicans) was brief and he invested all his political capital early on healthcare reform. Which was wise, considering how Clinton left it too late and failed."

It stems from white supremacists and neo-nazis, and you want to turn it into a neutral phrase like a pat on the back for being white. That's a fine aim, dude. People have done it with queer. But don't be surprised if the rest of the population still associates it with neo-nazis.

Anyway, the particular hashtag was started on 4chan as a troll to trap liberals into engaging. They didn't do it out of serious desire for having a ""it's ok to be white"" campaign, but it's supposed to create a confusion on the issue.

Basically, he was critical about the USSR and Cuba's role in the Angolan Civil War. He wanted the US to take tougher stances in defense of freedom and democracy in Africa, as he saw states throwing off the shackles of colonialism only to become client states of the Soviet Union by force. His main gripe at the time was that after Vietnam, the US Congress was becoming very isolationist, but that will have no bearing on the Soviet Union, which will continue to militarily intervene everywhere it wants and only be happy to see the US withdraw from the world.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fcp228f,t1_fcp1fh0,1577848082.0,"there is no ""core of the slogan"". Just like there is none for ""black pride"". They exist out of their specific historical contexts. There's no ""black pride"" rallies in Ethiopia. It exists due to its history in the West or other colonies (South Africa etc.)

Similarly, we must know the context of ""white pride"", and the ""core of the slogan"" to borrow your phrase, means something completely different. Much like Nazis had pride in being white and German, it was a pride of superiority. ""Black pride"" or ""gay pride"" etc comes from a clear historical situation where that identity was associated with shame, and it's a rejection of that shame, not an expression of superiority.

Also, you're wrong to say the Nazis took ""normal white symbols"". No such things exist, and they created this one. YOU'RE the one taking Nazi slogans and are upset people aren't going with your interpretation."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcp1a4e,t1_fcowsbo,1577847404.0,"Check the history.

**White Pride has never been anything other than a neo-nazi slogan**, expressing NOT that they are just as good as anyone else, but they are **better** merely from being white.
