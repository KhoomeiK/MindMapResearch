news,fft82zs,t1_fft07t4,1580211689.0,">Why do you think ""arrest"" will be the immediate response to failure of reporting? Why not fines?

First, it will almost certainly be an arrest. Gun laws generally have very excessive penalties in particular, and America in general tends to overpunish everything but the worst crimes (where we still punish heavier than most, but I'm a fan of it).

Fines are a big part of the problem. A $1000 fine for some people is going to change their vacation plans. A $1000 for other people could leave them homeless. Plenty of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, and no small number are so poor they rely on government services to make sure they have enough to eat.

Moreover, this targets those same Americans in specific. People with an alarm system, in a gated community with no economic diversity, with a high police:citizen ratio that is very responsive to members of that community are less likely to be victimized or then prosecuted than those in poorer neighborhoods.

It's basically the same idea behind not have a civics test required to vote. It sounds obviously reasonable, except it will certainly be racist, classist, and it excludes people from voting to reform educational systems that leave people unable to pass the test. 

If someone's house is robbed, it was probably not the first one hit by those offenders, so maybe we should turn that harsh gaze on the police, or the economic inequality, or the parents of the offenders, or the parole board who let them out, rather than the innocent person who was stolen from.

 

>Furthermore, there is a big difference between being raped and having a dangerous object stolen from  you that could be used to victimize others. 

What is the specific difference, particularly if the theft is a robbery (thus has the use of violence)? Both could lead to further victims if someone does not report.

Moreover, as I said to another person, if rape seems too ""extreme,"" make the same comparison for simple battery. Should it be illegal to be punched in the face and not report it within 24 hours? 

&#x200B;

>And before you make comparison to other stolen goods, let's remember that the only purpose  of weapons is to inflict harm on others.

This reasoning only applies if certain models of gun are taken. If a 20 gauge single shot shotgun with bird shot is taken, it could be used in the commission of a further crime, but it's not a great choice.

America needs fewer laws (for individuals. Businesses need more regulation), not more.

An unusual, extreme outlier vastly distorts the data. Using Mother Jones own data, total victims is not statistically significantly \[defined as failing a t-test if the AR=1 data set has a different mean than the AR=0\] affected by whether an AR was present, nor is injuries, and fatalities only is if we leave in the major outliers of Las Vegas and Orlando.

Unrank queue isn't a real queue, and everyone knows it.

You're complaining about team play, the entire point of team based games.

Knowing when you can safely 1v1 is a generically useful skill anyways. 10 solo player games have plenty of 1v1s interrupted, and you should specifically plan to prevent that, or to still benefit. Depending on your build, the map, etc. a slow burn 1v2 can put the enemy team off balance by reducing map pressure everywhere else. Once you rank high enough, you will have randoms show up to win fights against you. And at low ranks, duos suck at map position, so there's only a middle sliver where you're going to see unusual amounts of team play from duos, but it's good practice for high skill solo play anyways.

Again, wins increase MMR. If duo queue is an advantage, they will quickly be matched against stronger players until the advantage is nullified (or they soft cap MMR, but if they are so good that it's logistically impossible to find better opponents, they deserve their high rank)."
