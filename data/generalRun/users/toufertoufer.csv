Outlander,fdve76r,t1_fdvdtj9,1578746491.0,They leave out A LOT. I would be all for a reboot if it was made into a series instead of movies.
Outlander,fdvcxfa,t1_fdtug1q,1578746122.0,"Movies/TV can only appeal to two senses. Sight and hearing. Books invoke all of them as well as literally put you inside of the characters head so you can know their thoughts and feelings. It is impossible to put that onto a screen. Some movies/shows come close, but whenever a book is made into a script, something is always left out and it will never be as good as the book. My disappointment in the HP movie franchise taught me that lesson. Almost nothing surprises me when it comes to transforming a book into something we watch."
