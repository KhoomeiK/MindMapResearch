But yeah, I suppose I should thank you? For keeping the memory alive with stupid jokes on behalf of people born well after 1945? Because apparently Germany managed to whitewash WWII and people forgot who's done it? Like, are there people in the world who are like ""What was it? Nazi Mongolia? No, Nazi G... Guatemala?""

I've said before that Germany's humility and assuming of Nazi crimes [is important and perhaps the country's greatest virtue](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/eha429/germany_75000th_stolperstein_for_holocaust/fchyp08/?context=3), but (perhaps exactly for this reason), one should be respectful of both the somber nature of those events and of the way Germany treats them today. Instead of constantly being like ""Hey, German guy, tell your people to send experts on killing Jews! Get it? Cause your country **is** the one that **likes** to kill Jews!"".  
  
And the other reason is the exasperated redditor in me. Between jokes like yours, scolding comments and accusations, it is clear that a large portion of the world population believes that ""Germany *is* that country that *hates* Jews and *wants* to conquer the world!"" (notice the present tense). This contributes to an already incredibly simplified view of the world (I meant the ""polandball meme"" remark. You would be surprised of how many people's serious view of the world is actually the equivalent of polandball memes and personifications), which is just stupid."

Even better. At least if it was a triumvirate, the bickering could resemble some manner of democratic debate at times.  
  
Making it a city-state (because I know you said that's not what you propose, but then *what*? Again, I arrived to the city-state conclusion from the premise that the city *exists* and someone has to govern it, independent or not. Not much we can do about it) will only make the problem permanent.  
  
Letting the city be part of a country (or two) at least leaves the framework for improving the situation democratically. If the country(-ies) become more democratic in the future (no matter how far, as long as it happens at some point. With the alternative, that point is never. I have to give that to the Vatican model: it lasts), not only will the problems be resolved, but also, it will solve all the other problems the 1 million people living there, that do not have anything to do with random religions and sacred sites. Matters of democracy, economy and welfare.  
  
And I'm not concerned about how convoluted it is. It's only a concern because of the surrounding tension (which is enough to cause trouble on its own anyway). Without the tension and in a more democratic state, the whole French territory and Jordanian church things would become arcane quirks, like the City of London being semi-independent because Romans or Mount Athos not allowing women in because Ottomans. These quirks created in times of tension are only as relevant as the tension itself. When it's over, it's just a trivia fact."

All for free college that most of Europe has now anyway without all the oppression and communism and which, to be fair, was never that good in East Germany in the first place."
europe,ffd9tsz,t1_ffd65dq,1579816254.0,"Who said anything about a state. I'm not sure you understand what I mean, so I'll explain:  
  
When I said ""unless we abandon the city, that city needs to belong to *someone*"", that's what I meant. Someone needs to administer it. I don't care if it's a nation, or a mayor or an independent city, or a committee or a religious institution. It's still *someone*.  
  
And as long as that someone does not exist in a vacuum, it will be influenced.  
  
Say we do what you propose and make a common institution of all faiths. First question: *Which religions?*. Jerusalem is holy for Christianity, Islam and Judaism, but only Judaism can (and even then, only if you ignore a lot of people of different denominations) be considered a single religion. So we have a Jewish representative elected by a council of Rabbi (it's not how it works but let's say we organise a religion that is made so it is not centrally organised). All well and good. But what about the Muslim representative? Will it be chosen by Sunni or by Shia? Or will we have two, one for each? And what about Christians, will the representative be Catholic, Orthodox (who, unlike Catholics, don't have one pope, but instead are divided in many, many patriarchies. So will that Orthodox be Russian or Greek? Serbian or Romanian?), Nestorian, Coptic, etc...  
And if we choose to get around the problem by having a representative for each, we end up with a situation where the council is made of 25 Christians, 2 Muslims and one Jew. It'll be great...  
So there is no way of making a commission that establishes neutrality both between religious categories and between individual religions, and *even if we do*…  
Say we managed to heal the Great Schism as well as to decide once and for all who the successor of Muhammed is. Now both Christianity and Islam are united and we have 1 Jew, 1 Christian and 1 Muslim, each representing their religions. Remember when I said outside influence will happen. Expect a lot of situations where decisions are made by 2-1 for the Judeo-Christians, with support from Israel and the US against the Muslims supported by the Islamic world. Which is exactly the current situation, so great job doing nothing.  
  
Now, also, the differences between Vatican and Jerusalem.  
  
The Vatican is not *really* a holy place in and of itself. Nothing religious ever happened. It's only where one of the 5 patriarchies of the Roman Empire was established, which became the Papacy. The Vatican is the HQ of Catholicism. It is only important to the Pope because that's where the Pope lives. So I don't see how you see this as a solution for solving conflicts. Vatican never solved any conflict, because there is no conflict to be had when there is just one party.  
Vatican is not a *city*. It really is just the HQ of Catholicism and it's ""population"" are just the people working there in upper administration at a certain point in time. Look at a map of the Vatican, it's the Church, gardens and a wall around it all. Jerusalem is a big city, with important sites scattered all over. A Jerusalem city-state will have *a lot* of administrative, economic and political problems. It will have an economy, people doing business, *with other countries*. It will have a population which will need to be led.  
So while Vatican is just one party deciding very few, narrow questions of a religious matter, Jerusalem will be three parties deciding broad matters of a *political matter*. The amount of friction generated by this arrangement will be huge.  
  
Not to mention, you know, the idea of taking one million people, Israeli and Palestinian, who live and work in a *country* or other and suddenly putting them into a situation where they live in a bizarre, artificial, theocratic city-state. At least a country can (if it gets it's act together) allow them to lead themselves democratically.  
  
I think you took ""Vatican is a country"" a bit too seriously. There are many reasons why the Vatican is just a quirk in the system that is autonomous, and not an *actual* country, with an economy and politics and a big, diverse population."

The institution of slavery in Britain was first attacked on an Imperial level in [1807](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_Trade_Act_1807), a full 25 years before the slave revolts you mentioned. And it was passed as a law by a Quaker-EE coalition in Parliament. There was no violence or bloodshed and slave trade was done.  
  
The Magna Carta was not what made Britain a constitutional monarchy. At all. While it was the first act that limited the power of the king, it did so for the benefit of the nobles. So the same thing. Thanks for pointing out why the righteous violence you speak of is stupid: they are conflicts between kings and nobles, with no benefit for the common man. What made Britain constitutional was the increase in Parliamentary power far, far later (and again, without bloodshed).  
  
You pointed out ""the only time Britain had no king"". Yeah, *because it had an autocrat instead*. Again, this stupid idea of changing the carpet by burning the house down. Oliver Cromwell was *a terrible tyrant*, that stupid civil war and all its bloodshed did nothing good for Britain or humanity.  
  
And speaking of Cromwell, you talk about Ireland. Well, guess who started all the terrible things done to them?
  
And how sneaky of you to mention the violence that brought down the Bonaparte reigns. Yeah, I admit, violence worked then. Only problem: *the exact same stupid violence perverted the ideological meaning of the French Revolution and brought the Bonaparte reigns in the first place.*  
  
As for 1848, the Spring of Nations. Why don't you try [actually reading about each country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848). Now, you may notice that the countries in which the liberal ideas of 1848 were brought in with no major unrest (like Belgium) actually succeeded in implementing them, while the rest (like basically every single German state) immediately devolved back into either an army-state or a strong monarchy.  
  
And there is an even bigger problem: violence does not work most of the time anyway, but it works even less the later you go in history. While medieval countries can afford massive violence and destruction, because they are already poor and administratively basic, you can't have that in the modern age, where society is interconnected, complex and once you burn it down, it will take decades to rebuild (and almost never better than it was before) so let's see what happens when you pass 1900:  
  
- The Russian Revolution: brilliant idea, violence, terrible execution and possibly the second worst dictatorship ever.  
  
- Germany (you also kinda cheated a bit because you only cherry-picked revolutions whose ideals we can agree, but here is the problem when you say it's a good idea to burn down authority to create ""a better world"": some have a weird definition of it.): it was a period of terrible social upheaval and people wanted a better life, so they resorted to violence. By your judgement, this should lead to an utopia! Actual result: the worst dictatorship ever.  
  
- India: You conveniently forgot to mention India, where the violent revolution against Britain backfired horribly, whereas the non-violent revolution of Gandhi actually worked.  
  
- 1989: In 1989, Eastern Europe threw off the shackles of communism (boy, that Russian Revolution worked really great...). *All of them trough reform*. Which is the only country that had a violent revolution? Romania. Which is the only country where the communist party members continued to rule for 15 years? Romania. Whose president is trialled for crimes against humanity because it turns out the revolution was a sham? Romania.  
  
- The Middle East. The Arab spring was brilliant for nations that reformed... as for those who descended into violence... Syria...
