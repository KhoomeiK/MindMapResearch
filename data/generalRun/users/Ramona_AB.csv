fatlogic,felr767,t3_eppxr0,1579228951.0,"So, I just looked up first aid courses around my area. $117 out of pocket. IDK if this person is the teacher or just another student but either way, I will be annoyed. Pissed if she is the teacher, I have spent $117 (and only $95 back if unforeseen circumstances happen) on a first aid course, not your feelings on diets and fatness. Chances are I'm there because my job/study requires me to be certified. 

That is why people are staring at you. Your comment has nothing to with the course. If you are just another student, you are disrupting the course. If you are the teacher, you are going out of your way to NOT do your job and equally, if not moreso, disruptive."

fatlogic,fdj8h32,t3_ellmmw,1578461463.0,This seems more like she's using PCOS diagnosis as a timeframe. She's literally contributing the weight loss to swapping her coke out for water. There's no fatlogic here.

This doesn't excuse the comments, its still rude as hell."

Down side: I overdid it and botched my coleslaw attempt. Including forgetting the onions. 

Bright side: Everything I now make will be stuffed with vegetables. 

Down side: There is none to stuffing food with other food. 

Bright side: I have pasta shells. 

Down side: I have no idea how to do anything and will probably wing it.
