television,ffrtjcy,t1_ffrnvrq,1580165502.0,"Totally different thing, mate. 

When starting keto you are *literally* starving your brain of the energy source it’s *needs* to work. It isn’t until ketogenesis kicks in and starts producing acetone and other ketones that it can also use for energy that the symptoms go away. It’s not a sugar addiction thing, it’s a “brain needs energy source to work, energy source cut off until replacement produced” thing."
television,ffrsc1a,t1_ffr3h5e,1580164732.0,"Life is too complicated for everybody to educate themselves about everything. Placing the onus on every individual to find, analyse, and understand information about every aspect of life is totally unreasonable. Even just figuring out whether the source of the information you’ve just googled is unbiased is a often mammoth undertaking relying on being able to determine who’s paying for the website or study through subsidiaries and shell companies.

At some point we have to delegate the responsibility to others: people and organisations who can look into the issue so that the rest of us don’t have to. Whether Netflix likes it or not, they are such a delegate. They can *choose* what information they present to us knowing that, for most of us, we don’t have the time to become specialists on the topic to make a truly informed decision. They’ve chosen to produce and broadcast this “documentary” saying its not bullshit and also chosen NOT to produce documentary telling us all the ways in which it is bullshit. 

They’re not obligated to, of course, but in not doing so they’ve shown they want the appearance of “non-partial observer” when really they’re an active participant in the dissemination of dangerous disinformation."

television,ffrn0z4,t1_ffqxmmm,1580161426.0,"It’s not withdrawals, it’s your body running out of energy before ketogensis kicks in to replace glucogens with ketones and then your body starting to use those ketones for energy. Your brain might be saying “gimme sugar” but not because you’re addicted to it, it’s because it’s literally starving."
television,ffrlvgk,t1_ffqv601,1580160727.0,"That’s the thing, isn’t it. You can lose weight with calorie counting alone, without any specific diet, but people don’t do it because it’s *hard*. It requires a level of discipline and physical and psychological discomfort (at first), which is what many people choosing keto for rapid weight loss are trying to avoid. And if you start with calorie counting, you’ll likely gravitate towards low-carb and whole grain foods anyway because they give you “more bang” (fullness and nutritional benefit) for your buck."
television,ffrihl3,t1_ffqs03k,1580158668.0,"You could have lost the weight *just* with calorie counting in the first place. If you eat less calories than you burn, you’ll lose weight regardless of what your diet is made up of. 

The reason many people find it hard to reintroduce carbs and maintain weight by calorie counting is that they weren’t calorie counting before, they were carb counting (or maybe not, they could have been following meal plans or only eating certain foods where they didn’t have to think about it). Reintroducing carbs requires cutting back on the total amount of food eaten, something they probably didn’t train themselves to do while on the diet."

And it sounds like her therapist trained her to turn what *was* extremely taxing emotional labour into something less emotionally taxing."
AskReddit,ff4hemq,t1_ff2sg6n,1579563670.0,"Unfortunately it sounds like she needed a level of support from you that you couldn’t give when *she* needed it. Chances are she tried to be honest at the time but your stuff was just so much bigger than hers that she didn’t know how to say “can we just focus on me and my (relatively speaking) small problems for a bit?”

A few months ago I was in a bad place, feeling extremely alone and unwanted, and needed the support of a friend who I’m usually the one supporting [edit: they regularly attend formal counselling]. But when I just wanted them to listen to my stuff they would immediately go back to themselves and their problems, judging my coping mechanisms (preventing me from being completely honest with them), or giving poor advice. I was already struggling to cope with my situation (which they thought should be exciting and adventurous rather than stressful, uncertain, and isolating), I wasn’t exactly in the best frame of mind to have their childhood traumas dumped on top.

Cutting contact for a couple of months might not have been easiest for them, but it was easiest for me and I needed to be a bit selfish so I could cope and heal. Even the thought of explaining to them why I couldn’t talk to them was creating more stress than I could handle at the time."
