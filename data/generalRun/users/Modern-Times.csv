actuallesbians,ffk53dd,t3_eu2h9l,1580016137.0,I'm sorry I know that's tough. Try a dating app if you'd like to find a hookup or relationship. You'll find your girl (:

LesbianActually,ffj0d4n,t3_etumwr,1579987203.0,Hey! Id like friends too so feel free to msg me!
actuallesbians,fff7zgq,t1_fff1uts,1579877993.0,Do you have body dysmorphia? I'd suggest watching videos on that and body anxiety. Help from others can be uplifting
actuallesbians,fff7pc2,t3_et84yj,1579877800.0,If you don't have a gf or date then go with a friend or group! The only thing you don't want to do is pretend to like someone (or a guy) just for the dance. Be true to yourself. Take it easy and have fun!
actuallesbians,fff7i42,t3_eta55y,1579877662.0,"Check out r/sexworkers. Tryst is great, its a site for escorts to post their pics and info and its MADE by sex workers. It's nicely made and safe. Feel free to ask a question there. They are very nice. You can also go to the sub then search Australia in the search bar and look through the posts"
actuallesbians,ff7if7n,t3_errz4t,1579650283.0,"Ive used bumble to meet women. Today I downloded hinge, Zoe, lespark, taimi, and spicy. I plan on trying them all the next few weeks, and from the reviews it seems lespark and zoe are the best. Ive used her but there wasn't anyone in my area. 

Bumble for me is great. There are tons of women, only some are threesome lol, but there are a lot of lgbt women in my area so it's cool."
actuallesbians,ff7hyxa,t1_fesw5gs,1579649982.0,It's still lovely no worries!!! Was just looking to help a friend (: you are funny!!
actuallesbians,ff7hry2,t1_fesqyug,1579649853.0,"If you are planning on leaving I'd suggest checking out the narrcissitic parents sub. They have a lot of experience and advice for cutting off contact etc. Id also suggest going to an lgbt center or center for homelessness so they can set you up with subsidized housing in the future and possibly something immediately. Google ""moving away from narcissistic parents"" and ""shelter from abusive parents"" . I'm sorry you situation is so tough. Message me if you need to talk (:"

actuallesbians,ff6zoxa,t3_ert73p,1579638200.0,"This boy knows your a lesbian and is purposely manipulating you. He got close to you while he oursued your friend and now that you're unobtainable, he wants you. He didn't forget you're into women, he wants to be the exception. If he does not respect you as a person and your sexuality, I think you should reevaluate having him as a friend. People like that are toxic and exhausting to be around. 

Good luck with your coming out. You're awesome. Keep being you."
actuallesbians,ff6hxv5,t3_eru6s3,1579627580.0,"From what you wrote after you discussed your feelings she said she'd rather be friends and not do long distance, so you both understood there wouldn't be anything between you two. When she asked you to go shopping and you knew she was seeing someone else then you knew it was only as friends. I understand it hurts, especially if she has feelings for you as well, but if she is seeing someone, her talking about them and doing things for them is going to be a part of her friendship with you. Friends talk about their relationships. I know this is a tricky situation, but with everything discussed and you both knowing you are only going to be friends, you have to take a step back and evaluate the situation. Can you handle only being friends with her, or will it hurt too much? I understand feelings that aren't returned can be painful, but remember there is someone out there for you that can make you feel amazing. You have to decide if this friendship is healthy for you or if it will only cause you to be resentful and hurt. I hope you find your peace and move on smoothly, friend (:"
actuallesbians,ff66v74,t3_eruvw0,1579620546.0,"Enjoy it! If she doesn't know it's your first time, tell her. Its okay, we ALL have a first time. She will know to go slow and take it easy. 

Getting ready: Put on pump up music!!! Write a list of things you love about yourself, watch videos that make you laugh. This is all about lifting your mood and confidence!!

Shower beforehand, if you use soap on your labia make sure to rinse rinse rinse! You don't want soap getting in there. Rinse your bum hole as well just so everything is clean even if there is no touching there. Wash your hair if you'd like. Use a body scrub. Do what makes you feel best. Slather nice lotion all over so your skin is soft and feels good. 

When I'm with a partner, sometimes thinking of them as a friend rather than partner eases my anxiety and tension about my performance. If you're just getting to know each other, ask about her. Flirt. Touch her when you laugh, listen to music and dance together, watch funny videos together. Do things to make the two of you comfortable! Laughing with a partner always makes us both feel so good. 

If you'd like to, you can shower together. Rubbing soapy bubbles and hot water over each other can feel amazing and beautiful. You can ever splash each other and giggle (:

When you're ready to get to bed together, maybe lower the lights and put on a lamp, christmas lights, or candles. Get lube out if you have it. Play some soft music. Talk before you get started. Tell her its your first time and that you'd like to go slow. You could give each other massages. Touch slowly and gently with lotion or oil. Enjoy it. 

Have a nice time (:"
actuallesbians,ff63o4t,t3_erv1av,1579618332.0,"There are definitely lesbians who are into trans women! I'd say go for it! Not everyone will be, but that's ok, not everyone is into you or I, but for the special people who are into us, it will be amazing. Edit: I'm not trans, I am cis, but I think branching out of your comfort zone is wonderful!"
Dreams,ff3i197,t3_erbxvt,1579541472.0,"Ive had dreams like this. It's hard to wake up and realize they aren't real, but they give me hope and think that in the future I will meet my soul mate. I've had dreams that turned out to be true, the craziest one being that my sister across the country was pregnant and crying to come home. I called my mom and asked if my sister was pregnant bc my sister was in a place where she couldn't call me. She said no. Later that week I got the call, she was pregnant and coming home. So I like to see dreams as lessons. I often have dreams about doing gymnastics as a kid. It makes me realize how much I miss it and should get back into it. We will meet our loves in the future (: When you get date someone, only be with someone you felt the same beautiful and immense feelings for as in the dream. (:"
LesbianActually,fevos9q,t3_eqonb5,1579399745.0,There will always be other girls! Join a youth lgbt center or club in your city. Focus on yourself and write a list of reasons you love yourself and why you think you're a good friend/daughter etc! Once you're feeling more confident about yourself it'll be easy for things to move forward (:
