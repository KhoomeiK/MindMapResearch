spirituality,ffxl70b,t3_evs0iu,1580327383.0,it’s not that big of a thing but after getting three hours of sleep last night and feeling terrible those extra sauces that’ll make bland food bearable mean the world to me. be kind to the people around you and spread love. The smallest action makes all the difference.

ZeroWaste,ffxd00v,t1_ffxcb8r,1580322626.0,no that’s not it at all. I live in a small city that is spread apart and walking to the grocery store would take 2 hours each way in the blazing sun walking in the road. everything is a lot more spread apart in america making it impossible and debilitating to NOT have a car unless you’re living in a big city. this post was meant to inform please don’t shit negativity.

ZeroWaste,ffsqm5i,t1_ffsly8z,1580189030.0,out of the 8 million tons of plastic added to the ocean per year  .025 percent is plastic straws. you can say it’s helping a small amount but you still have about 8 million tons of plastic in the ocean. per year.

glutenfree,ffco596,t3_esss1l,1579803614.0,i had to go gluten and dairy free for allergy reasons as well. Sometimes i can get away with authentic sourdough but if you’re celiac i wouldn’t recommend it. Udi’s is the best i’ve found. If i’ve learned anything it’s make peace with the fact that you can’t eat these things anymore and that what you will find will be kind of bread or kind of dairy but not like the real thing. it sucks but your health will thank you in the long run. good luck.

dpdr,ff7n2e3,t3_es3xf1,1579653478.0,yes. i was falling asleep at 8 and waking up at 2am. my dp was terrible then even thought i was getting sleep. I went on lexapro and my sleep had improved exponentially. not only my sleep schedule but the quality of sleep i’m getting. try taking some melatonin tonight to help you sleep and look up a sub that has advice about sleep hygiene. It’s made worlds of a different for me.
selfimprovement,ff6x5je,t3_erzqsz,1579636710.0,"i’m 20F and in your boat rn. I used to be an adrenaline junkie not afraid of anything and now i get panic attacks when i go out. when i was really depressed in 9th grade it felt like i lost a part of myself and that i didn’t know who i was. I thought that i was just growing up but it was the anxiety and depression. for the first time in a really long time i’m starting to feel the fire of who i was before any of this happened and it’s been because i’ve been looking deep within myself and facing the weight and emotional trauma head on. i realized a lot of my actions were being impacted by emotional pain in my youth. you might want to do that next time you feel anxious or like you don’t want to go out. dig deeper on that feeling. feel all the parts of you that are hurt that you try to repress. cry if you need to but never shove it down and pretend like it didn’t happen. you make progress by making peace. I’m still on my journey to feeling normal again but this has helped me exponentially, well this and lexapro. Everything that you feel is necessary for your healing. Shower your fear and pain in love and acceptance. I promise how you feel is not your new normal. sending you all of my love xx"

dpdr,ff2tjc4,t1_ff2ru0n,1579523550.0,"i’m so sorry about your parents. I get how it could feel better to just get rid of your name and get a new one. keep in mind though that your weaknesses are your superpowers. they make you different and give you perspectives others don’t have. I think differently because I have ocd and adhd. As much as my ocd torments me it also lets me see things before they happen. Any possible barricade is thought of and expected. I can’t ever focus with my adhd but I also am driven on a motor to succeed and get the most out of life that i can. how we frame our shortcomings will dictate how we frame our lives, wether with handicaps or superpowers. If it doesn’t feel right to change your name then don’t. give it a new meaning, the heart on your sleeve. that no matter what happened to you, however it was weaponized against you you wear it proudly as a medal of what you have overcome."
dpdr,ff2rlo0,t3_erc4gq,1579521016.0,ask yourself what anxious association do you have around your name/identity. i know it’s hard but facing anxiety and stressors head on and digging deep down as to why you feel the way you do will help you understand and overcome it. I don’t want you to end up in a situation where changing your name doesn’t make anything better and you start to negatively thing about your new name the way you think about your current.
Dracula,fezi0l4,t1_fezfy8w,1579457573.0,idk it’s just how i read it. right at the beginning when dracula first meets him i think he grabs harkers face and harker looks kind of in awe
selfimprovement,fezhuar,t1_fez9wad,1579457500.0,this! i used to be able to drink coffee right before bed and fall asleep fine now if i drink any caffeine after 6pm i’ll be up all night.
selfimprovement,fezhczb,t3_eqz32v,1579457369.0,it is easy to get a caffeine addiction but i’ve noticed it’s not terribly hard to get rid of. I used it as a mild stimulant before i was diagnosed with adhd to help me focus. drinking around 6 shots of espresso a day. or 3 shots and 2 cold brews. I was very tired during that period in my life but i also didn’t need to take vyvanse. I stopped drinking caffeine entirely in college and now drink around two-ish cups of coffee a day or a triple latte. i don’t have a lot of history with addiction besides quitting smoking/juuling but quitting smoking was a huge endeavor and quitting caffeine was something that i didn’t even realize i was doing.
