ketorecipes,ffx9nwh,t1_ffx006j,1580320648.0,"These sound delicious. I saw these in a different store but they looked pretty expensive, frying shredded cheese is fast enough, but if you want to eat it cold then those sound really awesome. I’ve since moved to India and we don’t have anything remotely like that. Lots of processed cheese products though :/ 

Pro tip: sprinkle Parmesan in the pan before using mozzarella or cheddar, it adds another level of toastiness."
ShittyRestrictionFood,ffwp8ri,t1_ffwp5w3,1580307635.0,I’ve moved to India I don’t even think I can find bacon in the store here and I’m damn jealous.
ShittyRestrictionFood,ffwp231,t1_ffai0pn,1580307501.0,That sounds delicious it’s like a deviled egg without the egg lol
ketorecipes,ffwmhsr,t1_ffwm6c0,1580305529.0,"That sounds good. I think it would probably just get softer again and be a ton of cheese if you baked it. Maybe you could roll them up like manicotti or cannoli? I use zucchini strips or eggplant sometimes if I want to bake it, or even make it like that in a skillet but I’m lazy too and I’m fine with anything thrown together that is pizza/lasagna flavored. Like I would just put those steamed/sautéed veggies in tomato sauce, meat, and a bunch of cottage cheese and/or ricotta, and the cooked cheese, and parmesan in a bowl and eat it like that because it’s fast."

iamverysmart,ffwlxuz,t1_ffwkozv,1580305082.0,"You can also say “arm is to shoulder as leg is to hip”.  It’s just mixed and difficult to parse when she’s got it smushed into the middle of a much longer sentence, she really didn’t do herself any favors with her writing style that’s for sure."
iamverysmart,ffwj4uv,t1_ffwc4ab,1580302710.0,It’s meant to be: An arm is to a _____ as a leg is to a hip.  It’s like one of those standardized test questions. Also sometimes seen as: arm:shoulder / leg:hip
blackmagicfuckery,ffwhzxu,t1_ffvmtxs,1580301671.0,"I think any air trapped in there, whether oxygen or not will make it bouyant. There should be lots of tiny spaces to trap air bubbles and if it’s all plant material and no dirt it will likely just float anyway. There may be some other mud and debris but the bottommost layer will be vegetation which acts as a sort of raft."
ketorecipes,ffwhgyt,t1_ffw0g5t,1580301159.0,I usually just put some cheese down in the pan and let it get crispy then add sauce and maybe a little more cheese and toppings. It’s so excellent

BollyBlindsNGossip,ffm6yl5,t1_fflyzlz,1580049615.0,Same. I literally have a masters degree studying Bollywood because of SRK.
LuLaNo,ffm4l0q,t1_fflx5pv,1580048417.0,If that’s the case you should probably work on your hand flexibility. Honestly it shouldn’t take too long if you keep trying you can probably do it in a week or two. I couldn’t do the Vulcan hand sign and I guess it took me a day or two to be able to get my fingers to stay like that.
weddingshaming,fflalch,t1_fd8fd8r,1580037150.0,"Unfortunately she didn’t start the trend. I’m from Iowa and rednecks have been doing this shit for ages. I knew a girl who did this like 15 years ago and her husband wore a hunter orange vest. It’s.... a lot. The local store even has pink camouflage bridesmaids dresses, fabric, curtains. It’s out of control."

getdisciplined,ffig6ee,t1_ffibp7f,1579973096.0,It’s like when you’re just getting started and surrounded with useless shit/halfway to hoarding. I think the 27 is just meant to be novel so that counting becomes more the focus to take your attention off of the anxiety of cleaning.

I haven’t followed her for a long time but I still use some of her concepts. And also I now live in a good pace where having a maid is the norm so I’m pretty happy about that!"

indianpeoplefacebook,ffbn506,t1_ffb53j2,1579773698.0,"The problem is that this is not even written by the guy in the picture (he’s a minor celebrity) and also even Indians who don’t speak English well wouldn’t use grammar like this, it doesn’t make sense in the context of any Indian language either. It’s some racist dipshit who wants to make memes and sucks at it."
indianpeoplefacebook,ffbn25f,t1_ff9y2s0,1579773572.0,"Well it’s not even real. Indians generally speak much better English than this, but the grammar is not even close to what an Indian who has bad English skills might use. It’s some asshole using someone’s picture and trying to write something they think an Indian would say."
science,ffbja5v,t1_ffbetbx,1579767931.0,"I mean, before we had microscopes people thought it was more likely that germs mutated directly out of dead animal flesh, but that didn’t mean that it wasn’t actually bacteria. I mean, you’re making this assumption based on what we know from science, but this study says clearly that there’s plenty we don’t know. Sample size has nothing to say if we simply aren’t aware of the evidence that exists."

food,ff8h883,t1_ff8h58x,1579678374.0,"that might have looked nice, this just looks like fresh citrus in a tart shell, it could use something to make it seem more finished. Maybe a clear glaze or poaching the fruit could have been nice too, but it wouldn’t be fresh any more then. Edit for whoever deleted the comment about the glaze, absolutely yes they can look overdone. I never want a strawberry tart covered in gross corn syrup goo either. But a glaze can be a lot thinner and nicer looking too"

RBI,ff2y90j,t1_ff2e2h6,1579528445.0,"I mean.... I’ve seen them react the same way when someone was assaulted (actually I’ve seen them shrug their shoulders and do nothing about this on multiple occasions). I’ve also seen them do this when things get stolen (vehicles, expensive electronics) and they don’t do shit, even when you give them all the information. I was shocked the first couple of times and now I just know better than to expect the cops to do anything. Now just imagine if I was in a predominantly black neighborhood how much worse it would be for me. This is why people do not call the police."

IllegallySmolCats,feyjgql,t1_fexhhg7,1579446300.0,"Specific breeds have tendencies toward certain diseases and physical problems, this goes for all breeds of cats and dogs. A responsible breeder will choose which animals they breed very selectively for the best health and temperament of the kittens/puppies, take very good care of the adult cats and probably show them in cat shows, and they will be very choosy about who they give the animals to because they want them to be well cared for and not abandoned or overbred for “cute kittens” or irresponsibly bred with other breeds or without concern for health. The breeders like this do not consider all of these factors and usually overbreed the mother cats too while basically keeping them in pretty bad conditions and taking their kittens away too early, not treating them for any illnesses and spreading diseases and bad genetics into the population for hundreds of bucks per cat. It’s really unethical. If you’re interested, there are breed rescues for any breed of cat or dog. I had a rare breed cat that I found on findapet.com and he was a lovely cat but he had come from a cat mill and was sick as hell when I got him,"
