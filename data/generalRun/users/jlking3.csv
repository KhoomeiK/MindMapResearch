I don't apologize for being skeptical, and I don't mind being educated.

No one has yet addressed this one very specific issue I've mentioned several times: I consume a beverage that has absolutely zero calories, zero carbohydrates, zero fats, zero proteins, but am chastised and told that the drink is bad for me. I am told that it is bad for me because I believe it has a sweet taste, and therefore it will spike my blood sugar and contribute to Type II diabetes.

So far, in this discussion, I've learned that it will NOT spike my blood sugar in the same degree as a sugared soda will--while that seems like common sense, the alarmist nature of the people criticizing me made me wonder if something else were happening.

It seems too ""perfect:"" people claiming that certain beverages/food/etc. are bad, and then moving the goalposts regarding WHY it's bad and shouldn't be consumed. Soda is bad because sugar--so I removed sugar and then diet soda is bad because chemicals--so I choose a beverage without those chemicals: club soda and then it's bad because carbonation (and apparently still spikes blood sugar because the club soda has a somewhat sweet taste from the baking soda)--so I remove carbonation and baking soda and drink still tap water with lemon and then it's bad because the water has chloramines and the natural lemon juice will eat away your teeth--so I switch to plain distilled water which has zero chemicals whatsoever and that's bad because it leaches minerals from your body.

No matter what I choose to consume, *someone* has something bad to say about it, and whatever health issues I have are blamed on my ""bad choices"" about what to consume. So I am wrong no matter what, and I am told that I should feel bad because of my decisions.

I hate feeling wrong no matter what I do or don't do; it makes me feel like I can't trust myself or any decisions I make, and that makes me profoundly depressed."

That said, I'm still confused as to how all these carbohydrates (and supposedly calories) are created from the sheer belief that something non-caloric tastes sweet. It appears to defy basic physics that consuming zero-carb, zero-fat, zero-protein, zero-calorie water that one thinks tastes sweet would create simple sugar calories and the ensuing blood sugar spike.

If, instead, as it appears you are saying, all of those carbohydrates are created by the gut flora, and not our bodies cannibalizing themselves to make carb-like substances (if I'm correct, that cannibalization is ketosis, and from what I understand, ketones do not cause a blood sugar spike), then it seems plausible that if one took an antibiotic that killed that flora, the blood sugar could not spike. If blood sugar spikes when consuming an anti-biotic AND zero calorie substances that taste sweet, then we have something amazing happening: the creation of organic simple sugars from nothing more than water, carbon dioxide, and minerals. Maybe that holds a clue to how life developed and formed on the planet.

Take the drink that I consume: it's like seltzer, but tastes sweeter because of baking soda. Now, I've never considered baking soda to be an artificial sweetener, but this soda tastes sweet to me. It has no carbohydrates, no fats, no protein, no macros, just distilled water, carbon dioxide and baking soda. Yet these studies appear to suggest that my blood sugar can spike from consuming this. It raises a question: if I stopped believing it was sweet, would it stop spiking my blood sugar as much? Do I have that much control over how my gut flora behave that simply believing something causes it to change in such a dramatic way?

I'm genuinely interested because the implication is groundbreaking and would appear to call for a new paradigm and fundamental re-evaluation of physics, chemistry and biology that can accommodate this."

1200isplenty,fehx8ou,t1_fehncec,1579125676.0,"This surprises me: are you telling me that humans can manufacture their own blood sugar like magic just by thinking something tastes sweet? That Diet Coke is equally as effective as Coke Classic in reversing hypoglycemia because it tastes like it has a lot of sugar?

This is amazing and fascinating. What is the chemical process that takes place in the body for the sugar to be created? The carbohydrates have to come from somewhere; if none are being consumed, then they have to be cannibalized from within the body somehow: that is simple and basic physics. So how does the sensation of sweetness cause out bodies to create sugar where there is none and where is the sugar created and released?

Is the converse true? That if something contains a lot of sugar, but doesn't taste sweet, our bodies won't raise blood sugar? Because then the cure to diabetes could be as simple as making sure nothing *ever* tastes sweet (or maybe even removing the sense of taste altogether).

I drink a sparkling water that has no sweeteners whatsoever in it, but tastes sweeter than seltzer because of baking soda. Since it tastes sweet, I should experience a rise in my blood sugar equivalent to drinking a Sprite, according to this new theory.

Or is it that we're screwed and no matter what we choose to do, our blood sugar is going to go up and up and up and up?"

Please show me verifiable evidence of widespread IVF picketing that is as impassioned as the picketing that happens in front of Planned Parenthood. I do not believe IVF facilities get picketed as much as abortion clinics but you claim otherwise; I await the proof.

I gave you an opportunity to admit that while YOU care about IVF, most pro-life people do NOT picket IVF clinics like they do abortion clinics. You doubled down and basically said that THE ENTIRE PRO LIFE MOVEMENT considers IVF and abortion equally bad and continually picket all facilities, IVF and abortion alike, with the same zeal, zest, passion, and regularity. I await the proof. I doubt it will come. Your meager argument is a 20-plus-year old stem-cell debate. That doesn't equate to picketing abortion clinics. If you're not picketing IVF clinics now, then you tacitly APPROVE of them because you're focusing all your attention on abortion clinics, which murder only about 1/3 of the lives you care so much about. If you aren't picketing IVF clinics and shaming the women who go to them, then you're not focusing your efforts on saving the most lives--only punishing certain women for certain choices.

The fact that you tried to play the ""one true scotsman"" fallacy seems to indicate that either the pro-life movement is much smaller according to you than it seems to me because you won't accept most of the people who believe and assert themselves to be pro-life, or you are a fringe zealot who also makes sure to shame those who go into IVF clinics equally as much as those who go into abortion clinics.

That said, you obviously haven't spoken or dealt with the groups in South Florida who call themselves pro-life, who revere those who have killed doctors who perform abortions and hold them in high esteem, who think that the forced abortions at the border concentration camps would be (and maybe are) merely the proper justice for breaking the law and attempting to enter our country illegally--with additional political benefits that go beyond punishing the criminals.

Rest assured that those people are the ones who are standing in front of clinics holding signs and shouting bible verses in megaphones, doing their best to prevent certain women from murdering their children. I would suppose that you approve of that behavior and would consider them at first to be part of your pro-life team given that activity. They simply take the idea of abortion and apply it to the death penalty with regards to immigration. Many Republicans--Trump included--believe in the death penalty for illegal immigrants: in a meeting, he asked twice about shooting illegal immigrants. There are vigilante groups who gather at the border to shoot immigrants crossing as a practical form of sport shooting.
