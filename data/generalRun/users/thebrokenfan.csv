I wasn't taught that shit because I was in a fundamentalist Christian upbringing, sheltered from everything around me, it was always assumed I never needed to know these things. 
He ""protects"" me by being someone I could trust and tell if I was assaulted, that I could tell him immediately and know he would be behind me all the way and not need to fear him calling me a liar or doubting me."

I don't want it to end, I don't want to cry, and I don't want the one show that has helped me work through my own depression to be over. It upsets me that it's over more than I thought it would, I mean it's just a show and ultimately unimportant, but it's almost like a close friend of mine has died. I'm planning on getting my first tattoo with the quote ""it gets easier but you gotta do it every day"" because that scene has stuck with me and I have been holding onto it and living by them to keep me going forward. I don't want my friend, the one thing that gets me and how I feel, to be done! I know why it had to end, I know that all good things must conclude, but it hurts so much and I don't think I ever will be able to watch the last episodes."

MorbidReality,fgd6n0o,t1_fgcdryg,1580679505.0,"That's what I do with my grandfather, he's the lovable goof who would honk randomly and wave at nothing while driving to make his grandkids confused. Or would be an ass and honk at people to scare them while they were walking, still equally funny as honking at nothing to a 10yr old, even if an asshole move. 
He is the man who was strong and would help you and have your back, even if you were wrong, instead of condemning you. I love and miss him so much..... But I focus on the fact he would be proud of what I've done and how I live, he would be right here next to me if he could. And that's what help me go on. 
How he died and his travel towards that place is not something I think about now, it's not how he would want me to think."

I feel like people will connect ""only autistic people have panic attacks"" which isn't true at all. Perhaps she has autism and that makes sense, but I don't have autism yet I have panic attacks all the time. I just don't want people to assume that everyone who has panic attacks are autistic, could cause a lot of problems down the line. I feel like just saying "" watch how her service dog calms her down"" would of been much more accurate and a better word choice."

badwomensanatomy,fegzb1g,t1_fegslas,1579105848.0,"While yes I agree with you on most of your points, as poly myself with both a husband and  a partner the thought of a poly family would be great. Even legally speaking, because my partner of two years would have some rights at least if it came to my death for example or in the splitting of my assets. If I had children (which I'm not ever going to) I feel like having multiple people to help raise the child would both be easier on the parents but good for the child as well. 
However we can't have nice things in this world without people fucking it up for everyone, so while I would love to be ""married"" legally to both of my partners, I have to just sigh and recognize it will never happen and it is better more people are saved from being trapped and used as a sex slave in the excuse of ""poly family"" than for my convenience. 
I also argue against the thought of it being ""perverted"", I just love two men equally and just as deeply as I did one. What is so wrong with loving two people?"

But I work at a high volume city/county animal shelter and worked at a vet clinic,  I can tell you with 100% certainty that the bigger number of bites comes from the tiny little shits like weiner dogs and floofy things. The amount of times I've gotten bit is much higher with small dogs than with large, and those from large dogs about 1/2 were my fault and the other 1/2 was from fear and prior abuse the animal suffered which caused it to lash out unexpectedly. 

Big dogs like pitties get abused at higher rates as well, not as many people just chain up small dogs outside and leave them without human contact. Few people let their little dogs starve, or beat them, or abandon them surprisingly. It still happens of course but the number of walking skeletons I see that are pittie mixes is.... Large. It's amazing how long a dog can live without food, you would be surprised how many can bounce back from starvation."
