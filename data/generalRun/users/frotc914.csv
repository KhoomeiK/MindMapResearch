Hahahaha good one. The main problem with NPs is that you don't know what you don't know. The difference in level of training and education is not even close. As shown by the fact that any time they try to get a nurse to pass even the level 1 board exam for physicians, they can't.

All of those pro nursing studies are incredibly flawed. They select the parameters to get the results they want. So you'll see headlines like ""study shows same health outcomes for patients with nurses and physicians"" but they are only looking at, for example, people whose diabetes is already under control and all they need is a refill on their insulin.

media_criticism,fdrmon5,t1_fdrjlvx,1578686722.0,">it still doesn't justify saying it only happened because of one particular event

I mean causality is a slippery thing, but it kind of does. If the US hadn't done the strike, the plane wouldn't have been shot down. And sure, but for Iran being trigger happy, it also wouldn't be shot down. Those other things you mentioned did not cause the plane to go down in the same way, nor did they inevitably cause the drone strike. I notice similarly that you didn't go back enough in time to what caused the embassy protests, either."
media_criticism,fdrft8m,t1_fdr29mm,1578683948.0,"You can go back in time to give additional context ad infinitum. It's completely justified to discuss the Soleimani killing as being directly related to the downing of the plane because it was (very likely) the act that caused Iran to be on high alert at the time. 

There was a good explanation of what likely occurred posted on Reddit a few days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/embvsd/pentagon_officials_and_iraqi_intelligence_confirm/fdnpafp

Tl;Dr, tensions flare, responses to threats need to be more immediate, and checks and safeties are removed before a plane goes down

It's very reasonable to believe that, despite all those other contextual issues, without the drone strike, the plane wouldn't have been shot down. Not because of some fanciful butterfly effect, but because one caused the other."

cringe,fdqw4si,t1_fdqomwx,1578675638.0,"Democrat/liberal racism is almost completely caught up in classism/elitism. So much so that they are hard to parse. When you see white people ranting about not bussing kids in from underperforming schools to their nice schools, it's almost assuredly not because they are worried about rubbing elbows with black and brown people. There's definitely some racial prejudice mixed up in there, too, and this worldview can be found all over the centrist-right as well. But it's all a far cry from the out and out racists of the hard right."

You would if it came to it, and so would your pediatrician. Kids get held down/strapped down for medical care all the time."
