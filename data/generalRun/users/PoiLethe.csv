TalesFromRetail,fgjep4a,t1_fgjafo1,1580842473.0,"It's amazing to see where older peoples ignorance zones are for technology. Like I have some idea what areas I dont know about but when they have them, it's a black hole, a Mariana Trench of not knowing. My mom isnt so bad, but theres some things, that no matter what I tell her she never seems to pick up. Like the magic of right click, or press and hold on your phone. 

Shes finally got audible on her new phone. I've finally converted her. And now she was trying to listen to it in her car. Her Sync set up is honestly convoluted AF. My car is older than hers and it's way easier to use the buttons to tell it to play audio through bluetooth. Theres a few back and forths with buttons. Its obnoxious and I can never remember the specific order myself. I myself cant use the sync talk thing in my car and I dont use it often with my phone. So finally I took a video of me pressing buttons in order to pull up the bluetooth option. Then I had an idea. Something that didnt occur to *either* of us. Use the speak function to play bluetooth music. It's crazy she didnt think of it, she always used that function. And it worked.  But before all that, her logic for trying to make the audio work in her car, when it played fine on her phone, was that there must be some kind of car button or icon in the app itself that just transferred the audio to the car. Even though I had done the button thing in her car multiple times to listen to my own audio. You can teach an old dog new tricks, but it will take years for it to sink through their thick skulls."

I was an adult mooch at the time. I didnt work. My mom worked. My sister was in highschool. That month that thing rarely left my side. At some point I begged my dad to watch him because I just needed to mentally not have him in my personal mental bubble for a few hours. I think I even  told my dad ""is this what a baby is like?"". That just cemented for me that if I couldnt stand a puppy for a few weeks, I would never ever be able to tolerate a human baby. After that I moved away for a few years and then moved back, and he still thinks hes my puppy. 

More people should try adopting a puppy and treating it like it's a human baby. Aka never just existing in a house alone. That's step one in preparing for having a baby years ahead of ever having one. My guess is the reality is the difficulty is ten times worse."

So after a day or two if I didnt see him, I'd swing by there after work at like 11 or 12 at night and call out for him, or go in if old roomie was still awake, and say hi. If he came, I'd basically walk home with him. (I usually rode my bike) He would stray ahead or behind while I walked, and I think he genuinely enjoyed our midnight walks.

videos,fg765zq,t1_fg6x31s,1580584924.0,"That's a good way to look at it. My mom said she lived with a garden like this one when she was young. My grandparents lived through the depression, my grandma cleaned houses, my grandfather worked at a factory sewing clothes. They had 4 children, pretty spaced out. They had a huge flat lawn, two apple trees, and a small shed called the coop where the chickens and goat were. When I was a child they were well into their retirement with no animals,  and the garden was sometimes beans, but mostly cabbage, onions, and tomatoes. He had an electric fence around it all to keep the deer away. Except for the apple trees. The one tree that was producing mostly didnt make apples large enough or ripe enough to eat for humans. (But when it did, and someone could climb up to get it, it was amazing).

I like it, yea, but its getting formulaic as far as motivations and songs go. I kind of like Let it Go more, just because it gets more specific about the whys and intentions. 

I like how specific the old stuff is too. Bare Necessities, Cruella Deville,  Phony King of England, Oo-De-Lally, Once Upon a Dream where the prince speaks to her. And the instrumentals specifically...like I can imagine what's happening on screen when I hear it. Sure there a lot of similar bits movie to movie. But that's fun to me. Like similar animations from one to another (phony king of england dance is the same as when snow white dances for the dwarves). You can hear bits in 101 Dalmations that echo both Jungle Book and Sleeping Beauty. They all feel more connected through their art and their style rather than their story and concept just being cut and pasted into a new setting and new art/music. Those moments feel like true easter eggs. I also love the rebellious nature in the lyrics of The Magnificent Mad Madam Mim, or the unique style and voice singer of Snow White. I liked in Brave that what was basically her song, I Will Fly, wasnt one she sang, but one she acted. It represented her, but it wasnt yet at the point of ""I need to get the fuck out of here and establish myself"". It felt more in line with the tone of who she was, not what she wanted (little town, it's a quiet villigage...I'm not like oootherr girrrlls), as well as the vibe of the area/culture. That's something I liked about Pocahontas, but I'm sure something like Disney artistically interpreting a cultures music would be cringey now."
AskReddit,ffvqw1p,t1_ffsqocr,1580270740.0,"That's kind of the point. You know how Hollywood usually depicts highschool right? Well that's how Ladybird seems to think highschool works, how she sees or treats people. And all that gets subverted. Rich girl with a pool isnt that shallow or want to go to Juliard to be an interpretative dancer or something. She just wants to grow up and have a nice family. The bad boy actually is a douche. People are people, not stereotypes, for good or for bad. Highschool itself *doesnt* live up to the hype Hollywood and the folk who say ""these are the best years of your life"" say about it.

  Its just... so much more down to earth than its usually depicted. And that's the point. Its refreshing if only because the movies around it arent down to earth or depict highschool as it actually is, as more than a blip in teenagers lives, that it can be a struggle, that family life can be a struggle, even though you love them. That you may know yourself, but establishing yourself to other people is another thing, that trying to remember people are more than just a part in your story is how you find genuine connection. That they are more than how they chose to portray themselves too.

 And sometimes that just gets lost in other films. Or it's so black and white and preachy fable that it doesnt really...show the different shades of how you slip and fall into doing it yourself. You've somehow flanderized the people around you in your head, and then you talk to them again and suddenly you've realized you've done it."

Not that I've traveled, but I recently watched this anime Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu. I've finished it...but since it has a lot of history about the art of a certain kind of storytelling in Japan and its stuck with me. At this point it's just me looking up real life Rakugo performances on youtube and trying to remember bits and pieces of the stories, and it keeps the show alive for me.

Some places turn that area into a garage for their cars or just make that ground floor the ""second floor"" as in its extra space but not somewhere you'd store something important. Anyways I rented a room there and the landlady had built it previously as bedrooms for her son's and a bathroom down there as well (shower and toilet). So it's a ground level bathroom with a sewage tank in the yard beside the house. So you enter the bathroom and then theres one or two steps up and then all the plumbing is located there: shower, sink, toilet. Room for all the plumbing.

You worked at least 10 hours yesterday between those jobs, probably more. You get home, you make dinner, take a shower, just chill. You go to sleep. Next day you have off. You got plans. You are going to do the laundry that's been piling up all week, grocery shop, take care of a few errands, clean the house, get that oil change and the brakes checked. But your friend texts in the morning. Her kids sick and she has to take off work and asks if you can cover her shift. You dont have another day off this week. Do you lose sleep to get all your things taken care of to help out your friend? She doesnt have a lot of money either, do you give her the money you make from that day? Do you just pretend you didnt notice the text? Can you really afford to lose this time off to help someone else even if you like that person and want to help them?

It wouldnt be an issue for someone who could just hire someone else to take care of their laundry and grocery pick up etc, or a babysitter to watch their friends kid. And you wouldnt be working two jobs, so you'd already have way more time to take care of yourself after work. So what do you do? Put yourself first or your friend?"

I dont root for them, they ended up reaping what they sowed.  But I do understand the horror from both perspectives. The horror of someone living in your house that you didnt know about, the horror of a family maneuvering their way into your life by being hired on, of suddenly out of nowhere a murderous attack during a celebration in your home. But I mean...we've seen that horror movie. The ghost, the killers ""haunting"" a mostly innocent family. 

But in this movie you see it from the other side. There was no malevolent plan. Callous, yes. Out for themselves? Yes. They probably would have gotten discovered eventually. But the first parasitic family (the housekeeper and her husband) intervened and, as the daughter and mother said...it got way way way out of hand. Definjtely should have formed some kind of pact to support each other. But just like all three families in this movie, they were all callously only thinking of themselves. 

The Parks, the rich family? They were too...self absorbed I suppose. It wasnt fair to them...but I can see how it all built up. The fathers spent the most time together, talking. And you could see the resentment building in him after that night. The smell he could do nothing about, the rain that took his home merely inconvenienced their trip, that they probably would have taken off with the car with their son and not spared his daughter a second glance, that no one was helping his wife fight off a crazy person or rescuing his daughter, his son bleeding and maybe dead. Maybe even the fact that he didnt love his wife. All compounding into one moment where the father had no gratitude for what he had or empathy for the people he hired and saw everyday, and the dad thought he had nothing left to lose. Its a horror story on their end too. 

Living in that basement was the jail time. He didnt even have what the previous man had, he didnt have the people he loved looking out for him, at least not to his knowledge.

Anyways its not so clear cut, I think. I didnt want them to screw over the people who already worked there, or take so much advantage of the people they served. If there was a little more empathy and kindness all around it could have been avoided. But they all made decisions along the way that led to this. The rich dad assumed the worst of the people he hired previously, the mother chose drugs over properly vetting the people she was bringing into her home, or caring enough about those people, like the housekeeper having TB and being tossed out without any excuse, her daughter having a relationship with her older tutor, getting proper therapy for her son."
