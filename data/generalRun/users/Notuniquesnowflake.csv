If not for her, for the fact that it brings more attention to fires and inspires others to give.

Like it or not, she has more followers than you or I do, and this will bring way more attention to the fires than we ever could. And, this may be a little judgmental, but I have to assume a lot of the people who follow  Serena and other celebrities aren't as clued in to global news. So this is reaching a lot more people who might not be aware or otherwise care. It also encourages other celebrities to donate for the publicity. So how is this bad?

I appreciate your critical thinking, but I believe you are letting your cynicism (and maybe preconceived biases) get in the way of the greater good. Ask yourself, what good comes from criticizing celebrity donations like this? How does it help people and animals suffering in Australia?

A healthy amount of cynicism is a valuable asset. But if all you have is cynicism, you ain't got much.

If you really want to maximize help for those in need, put your ego aside, recognize good (even relatively small good), and use it as a provocation for others to do better. Make it a challenge. For example: ""Serena Williams showed she's World Class on and off the court by donating all of her winnings from the  ASB Classic to Australian relief efforts. The ball's in your court, Venus!"" Or, ""Serena Williams donated $41K to Australian brush fire relief. Federer, are you going to let a girl beat you?""

Encourage others to match or give more. Right now, by simply bitching that they're not giving enough, you're only discouraging others from giving. Thinking critically is not just pointing fingers at others, but also thinking of the logical impacts of your own actions."

There's some truth to this. There's absolutely nothing wrong with finding someone attractive or having fantasies. But OP never indicated there was.
