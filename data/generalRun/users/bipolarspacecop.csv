FTMMen,ff5ndc2,t3_ers1ck,1579601594.0,"My first time, and subsequent times after, have been really uneventful. I was so nervous about it when in reality... No one cares. And if they do, it's not their business. I was at a shopping centre and really needed to piss and felt wrong going to the women's. I got weird looks even before T and I'd been on it for a few months at the time so I felt confident enough to go.

I went in and headed straight for a stall. I avoided looking at anyone in there above the ankles because I didn't need to added anxiety of knowing if they were trying to clock me. I went to the bathroom, washed my hands, and left. That's literally all you need to do. I promise, it's nothing to be scared of. Just get in and get out. You'll get more comfortable with it the more you do it. I understand that the first few times can be pretty scary because you just don't know what will happen, but 99.9999% chance is that nothing will, and you'll be fine. You're a man and you have a right to go to the bathroom of your correct gender."

I a have a 3inch reelmagik so it's whole dick and balls with a flat back. it can easily look very unnatural on top my of mons pubis which is already big. It's also a bit heavy (relatively) but that can be a good thing since it corrects my walk. This foam concept is a cup so I think it would be better for big guys because it would fit around our parts better where as it'd look and feel pretty awkward on people who don't have as much fat in that area. I still like the concept and am interested in trying it out. I think if it was less of a cup and more flexible, like a flat insert, to fit around different body types would be a good idea. It would be easy to fit and pin in between the boxer pouch too so you wouldn't need to fuss with pouches or a harness. You could even just pin it to the waistband and have it against your body if they were machine washable. I'm gonna go research it. Surely there's something like that our there"

This is probably why “tough love” or shaming doesn’t work on us either. Rather than having the reflex to fight back and prove people wrong, it’s just reiterating to us how shitty we are.

There's also the possibility of situations where you plan to meet up with somebody for a date or hook-up online but they have other malicious plans. That one is a big worry for me and anyone else who's a gay trans man and the insane amount of straight guys and chasers on grindr. I kinda forgot about the possibility of being forcibly impregnated or infected with STDs against my will, which is another thing that can happen through meet ups and not just random assaults.

It really is terrifying. Just because it happens to women more, doesn't mean it never happens to men. We're expected to man up and get the medical treatment we need, and get over it so it just seems like it barely ever happens."

truscum,febzjtz,t1_fe9md63,1578964597.0,"Exactly. It's like how some of the fetish community is trying to link themselves to the LGBT community because of their nontraditional sexuality. A kink is not a personality trait. The only reason gay people have to come out is because we're expected to have partners of the opposite sex. Just like trans people come out to their loved ones because there will be changes to their daily life (and appearance) that they can't hide.

FTMMen,febx7b5,t1_fe7ve9x,1578963772.0,"This is my exact fear. I may not be the target of the same type of harassment women endure, but I'm still scared of not passing ""enough"" one day and getting assaulted for being trans or assumed to be gay (I am, but that's beside the point) like you were by the wrong person who's looking for a fight. Men still get robbed, assaulted, and raped whether they're cisgender or not. The attacker(/s) wouldn't know unless they saw our junk. Even worse, having them find out I'm trans may escalate the attack. I'm left alone more now that I pass which is great but there's still an underlying fear of it especially when walking alone at night. I do have extreme anxiety and OCD so I worry about unlikely but possible situations like this way more than I probably should. I'm glad that person feels safer now, but it was kind of a ridiculous way to word what he said the way he did. Men get assaulted or even killed during robberies all the time. We're less likely to be raped, but more likely to be beaten up for no reason other than some intoxicated idiot is bored and angry."

Like I can see it move when I flex it now when I clench my jaw. Which is often because I’m an anxious mess. Anyway, it reminded me of a post about a WWE(?) guy whos head got obviously bigger through the years. He is almost undeniably on some kind of steroids and it made me wonder why more trans guys aren’t on them. It almost feels like there’s no down side. I know it won’t make me taller but I know there’s quite a few of us that still feel too effeminate, weak, small, etc and I feel like something like HGH would help that?

I agree about wishing guys were more open about but I completely understand that it’s hard to be open about your insecurities and also know that if it gets popular, the possibility of abuse is higher just like plastic surgery. Putting a bandaid over a hole in the wall kind of thing. Bigorexia is real and I don’t want people hurting themselves but at the same time, legal controlled use could benefit a lot of guys.

I think the only thing that ever stopped me from starting steroids illegally before I knew coming out and HRT was a feasible option was the anger issues. I have enough as is and frankly I don’t want to know how I’d be during a roid rage episode."

As for why, I assume she started pulling as a teenager to deal with both Joya’s abuse and the sexual abuse by the football team.

I swear the juxtaposition of the main characters (allegedly) huge tits and small stature are mentioned every other page. I couldn’t even get through half of it. I loved Gone Girl and I was *obsessed* with Sharp Objects, both the book and the show. Dark Places, however, was unbelievably cringy."

a night.

I still think it can stop addiction in it’s tracks."
todayilearned,fcjjdzg,t1_fcjim4u,1577689914.0,"exactly. its a tiny hinderance but for many people. it’s enough.

we can’t stop suicide, but we can help lessen the anount if people who attempt and/ succeed. i think given this study and based on my personal experience with both suicidal ideation and addiction,i really do believe blister packs help. I know they don’t solve anything but they do help a lot. Specifically with prescription addiction."
todayilearned,fcjfjvm,t1_fcjeinm,1577685763.0,"Can you not give people ideas? The whole point isn’t that most people don’t know to do that. Yeah, the most desperate will do anything but this is just harmful. Also, if you had a razor, who would slash a blister pack rather than their own wrists, which is more effective? That’s just dumb.

It’s not hard. But I was talking about addiction and possible overdose and suicide as a result of addiction specifically. My kind of cases may be reduced significantly if people had blister packs rather than bottles of pills. I know myself enough to know that at my worst, If I had a whole bottle at my disposable, I wouldn’t be here writing this comment right now. They are very much useful in general. People in a crisis will do anything to get out of said crisis."
