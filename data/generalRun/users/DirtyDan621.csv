aspergers,ff54mne,t3_ermreq,1579580100.0,Dogs for sure they are adorable and love attention for the most part at least more than cats. I still like both though.
aspergers,fewe0e5,t3_eqkdbn,1579409011.0,Yes I love animals and prefer being around them than humans. Specifically dogs since they don't judge me.
ForeverAlone,felyknu,t3_epr003,1579234251.0,Not great looking and overweight. Also have Aspergers so my social skills are bad. I would say that prevents me from finding someone more than my looks.
ForeverAlone,felyg6d,t3_epsvr3,1579234154.0,Same this is honestly all I want at the moment.
MakeNewFriendsHere,fecudcg,t3_eo5oni,1578984974.0,I usually wait a while before asking or don't even ask. I find it uncomfortable when they at ask so earlier.
PrequelMemes,fe148cr,t3_enen2p,1578822280.0,A surprise to be sure but a welcome one
aww,fe02smm,t3_eniiwv,1578801646.0,Aw she's so cute üòç
ForeverAlone,fdrdqw4,t3_emt7m5,1578683047.0,Should be a separate sub for success stories. It makes me sad seeing them so I end up hiding the post.
creepyPMs,fdp22la,t3_elntk0,1578618150.0,Jesus this creep is way to open about sex and it's really creepy.
ForeverAlone,fdp11bo,t3_emines,1578617454.0,"Damn I'm sorry that happened to you :(. Being friendzoned is one of the worse things when it comes to trying to find a relationship. 

As a guy I would be really glad if a woman liked me back. I'm sorry he didn't feel the same way."
Cringetopia,fdo8wyc,t3_emdfz2,1578600922.0,r/dogfree does the same I couldn't believe some of the nasty comments about dogs.
MakeNewFriendsHere,fdncdqn,t3_em9f34,1578582761.0,I usually get barely any msgs cause I'm a guy it really sucks but I don't want horny dudes msg me either. Sadly that's happened a few times.
Needafriend,fdn1qts,t3_em36zq,1578574639.0,Defiantly true I barely get any responses pretty much any time I make a post just cause I'm a guy. Not that I want to be harassed by horny dudes but I would like to at least talk with others and make more friends.
MakeNewFriendsHere,fdedhn0,t3_ekr1fi,1578336640.0,I don't mind the only guys who do are just looking for relationships. I wouldn't mind being friends honestly.
ForeverAlone,fd9zvpa,t1_fd9yiyr,1578240039.0,Not really and not everything here is miserable. Honestly think a separate sub should be made for success stories. It doesn't make me think I will escape at all.
ForeverAlone,fd9xa0a,t3_ekeelx,1578239058.0,While he was rude I'm not a fan of success stories on the sub. I tend to hide the post because they make me sad and depressed knowing I will probably not escape.
ForeverAlone,fd6kjb8,t3_ek5v6a,1578192396.0,It makes me miserable and sad when I see success stories. I should feel happy but it's difficult when your not able get a date/girlfriend.
Cringetopia,fd45gv5,t3_ejvqyd,1578164578.0,This dude has a serious problem like wtf
ForeverAlone,fcyq5cn,t3_ejgor2,1578084806.0,I Would love to experience that so badly üò≠üò≠üò≠
MakeNewFriendsHere,fcx1w5n,t3_eixape,1578047541.0,Honestly worried this might happen to me in the future. I'm sorry this happened to you op.
MakeNewFriendsHere,fcwok7c,t3_ej3a7y,1578031710.0,"I feel really bad it sucks because I know what this is like besides the large amount of msgs women get on this sub. My last post literally got one reply and the person didn't want to be my friend because I didn't like his favorite food üôÑ. 

Anyway I have gotten creepy msgs before from other guys and I'm a straight guy. Not many I would say anywhere's from 6-8 but still I get worried I might encounter another. 

So I understand women on the sub have it way worse when it comes to creeps online I honestly can't imagine."
ForeverAlone,fcvuh2v,t3_ej3ntc,1578010376.0,No

ForeverAlone,fcoh3ld,t3_ei9v5x,1577832078.0,Usually it's not random but there wife or girlfriend. However in some cases it is. Sadly I wish I can get a NYE kiss as well :(
MakeNewFriendsHere,fclus8f,t3_ehnuk2,1577756973.0,Yeah I hate seeing when I make posts  and barely getting any msgs cause I'm a guy :(.
MakeNewFriendsHere,fck6om5,t3_ehcw8k,1577718104.0,"Most of the problems I have while trying to make friends here

1. Ghosting which pretty much happens almost every time I post. Very rare that someone continues to talk unless you msg on another platform

2. Some people can't really make conversation or ask the same things everyday. Been burnt out by this recently by this cause it happens way to often. I will admit I'm not good either at making conversation but I can usually come up with some random thing. 

3. Creepy people in pm's. Had way to many of these and I'm a guy. 

Overall I like the sub and I'm happy I made friends here but these aspects just the downside I guess."
ForeverAlone,fcju5dk,t3_ehi76w,1577704858.0,"1. Social Skills

2. Looks

3. Status/Money"

creepyPMs,fcc4vwt,t1_fcb7vbk,1577594443.0,Same maybe not frequently for me though. Also Aspie but even I know this is disgusting and gross. I would be super creeped out by it.
ForeverAlone,fcbh7m8,t3_egzrgi,1577586826.0,I don't really have friends in person just online :/. I'm more jealous of everyone I knew from high school and college since they all have a better life than I do.
ForeverAlone,fcastw3,t3_egvqm6,1577575922.0,I would still get rejected

ForeverAlone,fbx1t73,t1_fbwzokz,1577166054.0,They really don't honestly at least most women. It's just that guys make a bigger deal  about it then most women. It's a weird superior thing from what I observed.
