I'll give my closing argument. I'm not imagining this hypothetical person going on dates and making informed decisions. I'm thinking they're just scrolling through Tinder and looking for something wrong with everyone no matter what, like seeing a picture of like some person in a doofy shirt or dad shoes and being like, ""fuckboy, next!"". Then going on social media and whining about how terrible everyone is.

Is this person technically narcissistic? Probably not. But my calling them one is equally valid as them calling someone one on tinder. 

To be fair, I think that whole system is narcissistic-ish, but I still think it's ironic/cringy to see someone within the system calling someone else a narcissist."

 I have one new Craftsman ratchet that I got under warranty. It's awesome, but it's also $60. 

All the Craftsman screwdrivers I have are decent. Not as pricey as the ratchets, better than Pittsburgh.

Craftsman would probably be more comparable to the Icon line, though I haven't used any Icon ratchets, the screwdrivers I bought are really great, and were about $20.

So, I would consider switching from Craftsman to Icon because you're getting at least as good of tool if not better for about the same price. Pittsburgh would be a downgrade.

Craftsman was dogshit for a while, but it seems like they're trying to make the tools  a bit nicer, and Lowe's is using them as their higher-end brand.
