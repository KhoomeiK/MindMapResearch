Even if you give the police exculpatory information that clears you of guilt, you *cannot* use that testimony in court for your benefit.

I have not claimed that there is an agenda against women. You have claimed that there is an agenda against white men. I am asking you to back up that claim, and for some reason you have continually dodged the question. If you are not interested in answering the question, you can just say so and save us both some time.

I actually never said that he was a nazi, these tweets show him supporting and spreading white supremacist talking points and ideology. What is an example of something he could say that *would* convince you?

You're intentionally misrepresenting his positions as a bad-faith argument. These are not standard ""right-wing"" or ""libertarian"" beliefs or ideologies, they are extremist conspiracy theories rooted in white supremacy and xenophobia."

It's definitely more than just simply ""not being left wing."" Here are some examples:

* (reponding to a tweet saying ""be careful what you say or (((they))) will silence you"") [Then I already am silenced.](https://twitter.com/notch/status/1070773433045143557)

* [Because there is an agenda against white people.
This does not mean other groups are not oppressed.

There are, of course, many more problematic tweets than just these, including some hot takes on racial differences in IQ and the like. He's several leaps and bounds past simply ""not being left wing.""

EDIT: Getting mostly replies addressing the ""It's ok to be white"" tweet by folks that are hopefully unaware of the origin and intention behind that message. Allow me to clarify why this is included in this list. 

First, a quick history of the term and its usage as a meme. The term originated on 4chan's /pol/ board in late 2017 as an intentional tool to create outrage and sway public opinion towards alt-right, white supremacist philosophy. [Here is a screengrab of the original 4chan post that shows the true intentions of the message when it started.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/310/067/48f.jpg) This proves that the message is not simply ""It's OK to be white,"" but was intentionally spread by alt-right groups to attract new people to join them and their objectively, demonstrably racist philosphy. 

Second, a quick history of how it was spread by actual, self-declared neo-Nazis and white supremacists. [Here is an article published by The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi news site, just 4 days later enouraging readers to spread the message across college campuses and public spaces.](https://archive.is/ICFot#selection-807.0-810.0) Here is a quote from the article: ""**This can go on for infinity. These kikes will keep saying that if you think it is okay to be white, you are evil. They will be screaming that as they get shoved into cattle cars.**"" As well, the message appeared on David Dukes website which celebrated the message ""sweeping the nation,"" but I am unable to find an archive link to show this. There are numerous news reports about it, however. 

As I've shown above, the statement itself is designed to seem innocent but was intentionally spread by white supremacists to attract people to their movement and philosphy."
