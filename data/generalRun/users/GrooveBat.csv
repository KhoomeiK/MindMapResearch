dementia,ffeapu1,t3_eslt9y,1579841463.0,"Make sure you’re using a company that’s licensed and bonded and read their terms of service very carefully. We use a similar service for my dad and the caregivers have been wonderful. As someone said above, my dad doesn’t really understand that these are paid caregivers. He talks about them as the folks who take him around to places. I really believe that they’ve helped him have an easier time with this disease than many. They help alleviate the boredom, keep him stimulated, and know his moods."
AmItheAsshole,ffdwm7f,t1_ffdrxo4,1579830743.0,"Honestly? It is, but I've found it tremendously helpful anyway. Everyone has blind spots when it comes to the way they operate in the working world, and the advice opened my eyes to my own."
AmItheAsshole,ffdfxyc,t1_ffdbzjg,1579820053.0,"I honestly don’t get the hover thing. It’s not like you’re rubbing your vagina all over the seat. The important parts are squarely over the bowl, not touching anything. 

What really pisses me off (hee) are the people who are so fastidious that they layer and layer and layer toilet paper and seat covers all over the rim,, and then just leave it all for the next person to deal with."

cats,ff0qlk7,t3_er2h34,1579471405.0,"I think you should wait, honestly. It would be heartbreaking to get attached to a pet and have to give it up because your roommate couldn’t tolerate it. Or if it didn’t get along with Chester. I don’t think it’s selfish to want a new best friend, I totally understand. But it seems like it’s just the wrong time."

cats,fet9zxq,t3_eqkdm0,1579373159.0,"I’m sorry you’re going through this. I don’t have any real advice to give other than to commiserate. It’s always hard to know what to do when there is no clear-cut illness or crisis to respond to. Just keep showing her how much you love her. She clearly loves you.

And I am sure you did the best thing for your dog at the time. It’s always easy to second-guess. But whatever you did you did from love"
cats,fet8te2,t3_eqk9sa,1579372850.0,"I think as long as you provide for them in the event of something happening to you, then there’s nothing wrong with adopting a new pet. If you’re worried about companionship for your older cat you could also try fostering."

AmItheAsshole,fdtj46r,t1_fdt77r6,1578717493.0,"Well, you’re kind of proving my point. If you’re asking for a paternity test because you suspect you’re not the father, you’re admitting that you believe it’s possible your partner cheated on you.  He had the right to ask for it. But he doesn’t get to get all upset when she is hurt and insulted."
AmItheAsshole,fdssmig,t1_fdscxre,1578707416.0,So you’re saying that every guy whose partner gets pregnant would be irresponsible if he doesn’t take a paternity test? 100% of the time? Regardless of relationship status? Married or unmarried?
AmItheAsshole,fdsh8jt,t1_fdsc8xj,1578702700.0,Great strawman there.
AmItheAsshole,fdsb0tc,t1_fdsa8fu,1578698474.0,Asking for “evidence the baby is his” is the “exact opposite of trust.”
AmItheAsshole,fds9zec,t1_fdqs0mj,1578697772.0,"Here’s what he could’ve said instead: “Hey, not sure how you could get pregnant; let’s ask the doctor this could have happened.” But nope. His mind went straight to the cheating. NTA."
AmItheAsshole,fds9i0m,t1_fds8j7l,1578697447.0,You get a paternity test because you believe that your partner had sex with someone else and got pregnant by that other person. That’s the definition of cheating.
AmItheAsshole,fds806n,t1_fds5ar7,1578696434.0,"How does asking her for a paternity test *not* equal accusing her of cheating?? Or at a minimum imply she has had sex with someone else? Unless we are in an immaculate conception situation there is only one way to get pregnant. You can call it a safety measure if you want, but it’s a safety measure that originated in a lack of trust. Is he entitled to ask for it? Absolutely. But you can’t point to this vision of a deep and trusting relationship and not acknowledge that he is the one who did not trust her first."
suggestmeabook,fdph52g,t1_fdpbepu,1578628492.0,Nope. Not in the least.
cats,fdlj8e7,t1_fdli0yy,1578525226.0,"Maybe that’s why. This was my sister’s private vet and maybe they just weren’t set up to handle ferals.

cats,fdlhjoo,t3_em0ccg,1578524159.0,"I can’t answer this question, but just wanted to suggest that if you haven’t done so already make sure to check with the vet to confirm they can see feral kitties. My sister rescued what she thought was a stray and took it to her vet and they refused to even touch it. Not quite sure why; I’m sure someone else here can comment."
AskReddit,fdkfzsi,t1_fdk5f9h,1578503069.0,"Similar thing happened to me with Kevin Bacon, except I didn’t almost hug him. He was behind me in line at my health club (they were filming Mystic River in my city and all the stars worked out there) and when I finished checking in at the front desk I turned around and he was just standing there. He looked familiar so I smiled and said “Hey! How’s it going?” thinking we knew each other. 

He looked uncomfortable and mumbled something. I shrank off.

But is at least I can tell people I am one degree from Kevin Bacon."
suggestmeabook,fdkc25p,t1_fdjk70y,1578500706.0,Agree! I started listening to the audiobook on a long car trip and when I arrived at my destination I was so engrossed I downloaded the book so I could continue with the story.

I did ask her to put her foot down once. She complied, but it crept back up there again. That was when I complained. I wasn’t gonna deal with that shit for six hours. Plus she was so drunk I was afraid she would throw up on my head."
