weightwatchers,ffld7ad,t3_etzwoe,1580038049.0,"I don't track the honey I use to sweeten my tea, or my family's homemade applebutter. WW has helped me see what moderation ACTUALLY looks like and I make way better choices without hardly thinking about it anymore... and applebutter and honey were NOT my problem. I also track my food in a separate app to make sure that i'm eating ENOUGH calories, as I don't want to repress my metabolism (again!)."

bulletjournal,fcfmcaf,t3_eh207s,1577631640.0,"A lot of my anxiety comes from trying to hold old everything in my head all at once - not even just appointments, birthdays, and worries- just like... EVERYTHING. Bujo helps me process those things by writing them down, much the way that handwritten note taking in class is always better than taking notes on a laptop. I'm so glad it's worked for you, too!"
ffxiv,f13l6fi,t3_d7nc92,1569161864.0,"ohmigosh, this is so beautiful. As a creative I hate it when people tell me that I should make a business out of my art, so I won't do that to you, but I would 100% commission one of these from you if you ever chose to do something like that."
