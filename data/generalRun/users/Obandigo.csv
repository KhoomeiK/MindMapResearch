Brandt theorizes that the highly-reflective, chemical dense waters act like a glass door, fooling birds into thinking they’re flying through empty space (not long ago, a helicopter pilot tragically fell victim to the same illusion, and his crashed aircraft was rapidly corroded by the lake’s waters). During dry season, Brandt discovered, when the water recedes, the birds’ desiccated, chemically-preserved carcasses wash up along the coastline.

Of course they are posed. It still does not take away the Wow, science/art aspect of it

For the series of photos, titled “The Calcified” and featured in this month’s issue of New Scientist, Brandt posed the carcasses in life-like positions. “But the bodies themselves are exactly the way the birds were found,” he insists. “All I did was position them on the branches, feeding them through their stiff talons.”"

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David\_Kaczynski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kaczynski)

From Wikipedia

After the anonymous Unabomber demanded in 1995 that his manifesto, [*Industrial Society and Its Future*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Society_and_Its_Future), be published in a major newspaper as a condition for ceasing his mail-bomb campaign, [*The New York Times*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times) and [*The Washington Post*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post) published the manifesto, hoping somebody would recognize the writing style of the author.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kaczynski#cite_note-7)

David's wife, Linda Patrik, first suspected Theodore and urged  David to read the manifesto when it was published. David recognized  Ted's writing style, and the criminal defense lawyer the couple hired  notified authorities. On April 3, 1996, police arrested Ted in his rural  cabin in [Lincoln, Montana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln,_Montana). David had received assurance from the [FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI)  that his identity as the informant would be kept secret, but his name  was leaked to the media. In addition, he sought a guarantee from federal  prosecutors that Ted would receive appropriate psychiatric evaluation  and treatment. The [Justice Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice)'s subsequent active pursuit of the [death penalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_penalty) for Ted, and [Attorney General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General) [Janet Reno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Reno)'s initial refusal to accept a [plea bargain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain)  in exchange for a life sentence, was seen by Kaczynski and other  members of his family as a betrayal. Such a plea bargain was eventually  reached, and Ted was sentenced to serve life imprisonment with no  possibility of parole. Kaczynski has since said that the decision to  report his brother was painful but he felt morally compelled to do so.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kaczynski#cite_note-8)

David Kaczynski received a $1 million [reward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounty_(reward)) posted by the FBI for the Unabomber's capture. The reward was funded by a [Congressional appropriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_bill) for the [Department of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice) and was, at the time, one of the largest rewards issued in a domestic case. Kaczynski told the [Associated Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press)  that he planned to distribute the majority of the reward money to the  bombing victims and their families, adding that this ""might help us  resolve our grief over what happened.""[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kaczynski#cite_note-9)"
