opiates,ffb4izx,t1_ffb4fjb,1579751592.0,I’ll google Cold water extract. Would be nice to play with them without the Tylenol
opiates,ffb4fj7,t1_ffb4a1l,1579751521.0,Yea true. Scared to say anything because will look like drug seeking. Figured they would have atleast gave me some Percs. I get more relief from gabapentin than these actually.
quittingphenibut,ffa39w8,t1_ff8qikl,1579727019.0,Right on!!!!! That’s great to hear. I couldn’t imagine doing what a mom does cold turkey off anything lmao
kratom,ff6h1av,t3_ertm7m,1579627024.0,"Long term kratom user 13 years in between binges of other opiates. Tapering on phenibut also and so far so good and I don’t get bad wd from zs either. I have seen psychosis from phenibut and Xanax wd so don’t think it don’t exist I just don’t get. Best ways to lower kratom. 
1. Use some kratom u don’t normally get off on. If u don’t feel red or greens use those. Only use that kra for a dose a day at first and use your normal energy kra for morning dose. 
2. Larges doses of Imodium. Not like the crazy high heart murmur stories of hundreds a day but taking 6-8-10 at a time kills the restless body shit. 
3. Getting off kratom mid a little more complex than the regular opiates. Obviously not the initial physical shit but the mental part for me is actually harder from  kra than was for subs and fent. Good luck man, I used it to get off subs again and now up to 2oz a day of white maengda still chasing the bliss energy"
opiates,ff6djhj,t1_ff6dcnc,1579624852.0,"Good man. I also didn’t feel anything first few time and was like wtf are people talking about. But when it hit it hit hard and we were hooked. I’ve never taken a drug that tolerance increases so much and such a drastic stop of return in effects. Now
I’ve been tapering for 6 months because the wd is worse than benzo wd for me"
opiates,ff6d9kp,t1_ff5y7wp,1579624679.0,Fuck don’t use phenibut every day man. I’ve tapeeed down to 3gpd now and I miss opiate wd.

opiates,ff583hs,t1_ff57pf9,1579583010.0,"I’ve never wd from heroin but have from fent, and subs in jail couple times and sure it’s the same carnival. But man this phenibut is fukin crazy. It’s more like a Xanax wd but actually worse for me. It’s all psychotic shit. Major fukin panic attacks and false awakenings scare the fuck out of me. Blood pressure goes and stays 200/100. A lot of people are going to ER so it will be news someday. Hopefully not before I taper off"
opiates,ff57pr5,t1_ff57jmp,1579582672.0,Thanks man. The rest of your story sounds so familiar got me thinking I need to go get my ass back on subs again when this is all over.
opiates,ff57coi,t3_ero7z5,1579582352.0,Worse opiate wd for me is surely restless leg/body. But now I’m going thru phenibut wd and miss me some restless leg.

opiates,ff561nf,t3_erooik,1579581244.0,"Great fukin story man. Fuck I can relate. I’m getting my spine fused to skull in few weeks and honestly my mouth is watering for what they will give me. When I came in with a broken neck in November I guess when I was on ventilator my mom told my main doc, well he’s had a problem with opiates. I’m so pissed off now. Be a nightmare to have such a painful surgery and get some dick sprinkling hydros on me. Fuck that. But I need to be clean, but I’m gonna play for a few months"

opiates,ff40vgs,t3_erglia,1579553109.0,"I was on 8mg a day for 6 months when I could afford it. My doc was chewing patches. If I didn’t take subs for two full days I had the same result all the time. First half of patch felt wasted. It’s like that first half had to do all the heavy lifting to sweep that nasty shit out. But 2nd half I got off on and wanted to call people, clean the house, now the grass, start stupid fukin projects with a evil grin on my face."
quittingphenibut,ff3on3d,t3_eqzp5d,1579545536.0,"I remember that magic. Holy shit I thought I hit the lottery. But yea man it’s fukin gone. I’ve honestly never met a drug that has such high rewards for such a limited fukin time and then this time fukin consuming to get off. I was at 12-14gpd for 6/7 months and then halved it down to 6 and been tapering since. My tapers been pretty fast because I take a few baclofen a day 10mg and I’m assuming that’s helping a lot because I feel fine. Besides kratom ain’t hitting like it was. Fuck alllll this shits alike. Discover drug LIFE CHANGER-holy shit works fun holy shit finally no anxiety holy shit no stress holy shit don’t feel as good holy shit need a little more - holy shit run in low- omg fuck this is horrible - holy shit fuck this shit- ahhh shit take this shit - now I’m
Off that shit but stuck with this shit but it’s cheaper shit my life Is shit time to find some new shit to deal with all this shit.

quittingphenibut,ff3l3ky,t1_ff3kvjc,1579543345.0,"Kick ass man. Yea I cut 12gpd in half and felt way better overnight. Now if I try to take a little extra to chase the magic it just makes me anxious as fuck no magic. 
Good to hear rocket"
quittingphenibut,ff379xn,t1_fesia0b,1579535378.0,What a bitch get new doc If option. I understand protecting her ass and maybe not giving bac first visit so she can research phenibut but sounds like she don’t give a fuck. Weirdly enough the reason we jumped on this shit is because it helped so much with sub wd. Lmao

All of a sudden I had the worse restless body I’ve ever had. Worse than opiate wd, anything. It was a horrible couple days but I haven’t heard that from anyone else. But yea no magic. Guess it’s like any other drug. It’s gone"

kratom,feca3vy,t3_eo8hog,1578969381.0,"That’s all bullshit. Kratom does not block any effects of opiates. Because it is a sort of opiate. Use kratom as your main pain reliever and the oxys for break thru pain. They don’t drown each other out, that’s ignorant."

quittingphenibut,fe5be2r,t3_enqoca,1578867307.0,"live it up bro! We’re here for when u do wanna stop. Yes sir when it’s still working phenibut is in a league of its own. Fukin shits great. Just keep your doses on the low side. Taper when u want to quit. Hey man here’s some advice I wish I would have known and put to use. 
       Ok I’m not saying it’s ok to drive buzzed on alcohol. But realistically a lot of people do. Just remember where u used to be fine on 1,2,maybe even 3 beers when phenibuts in your body u might as well drink a 12 pack as far as how good u can drive. And it don’t really feel that much different but holy shit did I get myself into some shit with this. Be careful man.  Enjoy now because it will stop working. If it does don’t go all high or your doses trying to get that flow back, just take some off days."
