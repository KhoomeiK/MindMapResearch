Thank you for taking the time to explain; I was genuinely curious what you meant and never meant to question your good intentions. Your story sounds like a painful journey and I'm happy that you've been able to rise against your obstacles with strength. Wish you all the best in your life journey!"
spirituality,fegquzp,t1_fd7gxvv,1579100396.0,"Have you considered that you may possibly be an Empath? They soak up energies and emotions from others while giving their own good energy to ""energy vampires"". Just a thought.
Wish you the best with Ayahuasca and that you find some peace!"

When I lose I pet, I allow the sadness then focus on how I gave them the best life I could and how grateful that we shared a chapter of life together. And that there is another pet out there ready to share a wonderful chapter together when I'm ready.
Sending you love!"
