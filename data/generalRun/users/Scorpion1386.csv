NoFap,ffh9rfm,t1_ffh9l2h,1579927250.0,Probably a combination of a lot of things then. I no longer get strong regular erections and I feel desensitized to pleasure. I am also addicted to porn (my counter is outdated and I haven't bothered to update it).
NoFap,ffh822k,t1_ffh7xty,1579925763.0,I get all of these symptoms!! I associate them with being numbed out from porn for so many years.
NoFap,ffgy2cr,t1_ffgxuv8,1579918008.0,"It make sense. Also, do you get high anxiety?"
BackToCollege,ffgxxy3,t1_ffgxuiz,1579917916.0,"Awesome. I'm doing English 102 (Intro to Literature) next semester (three more days!). Do you have an idea of what you may want to do? I'm not sure yet, myself. Too early to tell."

college,fffryy0,t1_fffrvfd,1579890508.0,How much high level Math is required for UX design in front end development?
college,fffrbm5,t1_fekdykg,1579890106.0,Is this UX Design which you refer to?
BackToCollege,fffne3w,t1_fffmvu9,1579887694.0,Data analyst as well or is that more computer science?
SSDI,fffn64m,t3_etd442,1579887560.0,Such bullshit. I hope they don’t do this.
BackToCollege,fffle7w,t1_fffl7c2,1579886477.0,Thanks! I appreciate this. How much daily studying did you do for your Calculus subject in Math?
BackToCollege,fffk8jo,t1_fffjp74,1579885763.0,So economics is a mix of business and social sciences? Interesting. What are the prospects of an economics degree?
BackToCollege,fffiya1,t1_fffc7h5,1579884964.0,"This was helpful, thank you.

I do like some aspects of Math, just not all."
BackToCollege,fffi4st,t1_fffffbz,1579884467.0,What kinds of Math were required for economics? Did you enjoy it? Stats is required for Calculus?
BackToCollege,fff4uye,t1_fei468i,1579875747.0,How and where can I go for distance degrees??
NoFap,ffd1t6f,t1_ffd1rgx,1579811737.0,I get the same thing!!!

NoFap,ffbulhi,t1_ffbtrq2,1579783283.0,I see. Would you say that precum as a result of a text message is a relapse or not?
NoFap,ffbs9bz,t3_esijdu,1579780798.0,What school is this at? Why is it there? This is interesting!
NoFap,ffbrvpl,t1_ffbgepj,1579780350.0,Why is precum not an issue?
fireemblem,ffaduwk,t1_ffad06e,1579733256.0,"I see, gotcha. Do you know whether or not about a Fire Emblem Discord that I can visit to get more insight on Fates? Not sure if there is one available."
fireemblem,ffacdtu,t1_ffac92f,1579732223.0,"I see. Well, that sucks. I dunno how I can win, I'm not exactly good at Conquest. Is it worth pairing Azura up for pair up units or is Sing too useful to do that?"
fireemblem,ffabrwp,t1_ffabnqv,1579731821.0,"Well, I can't do it now at Chapter 11. It seems really difficult and there's no way to grind in Conquest. Maybe you're right, and I'll wait supposedly. Which Chapter is mid-game?"
fireemblem,ffa1f5t,t3_em9zs1,1579725948.0,Should I wait until towards the end of the game to do the Paralogue Chapters for Fates Conquest?
fireemblem,ff9pkv2,t1_ff9nmvu,1579718090.0,I see. This was helpful. Thank you. Are daggers the only weapons that inflict debuffs?
fireemblem,ff9igft,t1_ff9cal9,1579713707.0,"You're not being unhelpful at all. I'm just rather new to the mechanics of this game. Hidden weapons are bows, tomes, and daggers...right?"
fireemblem,ff8xeqr,t3_em9zs1,1579699205.0,How can I utilize Hidden Weapons to the best of their potential in Fire Emblem Fates Conquest?
BackToCollege,ff4ddyg,t1_ff3xp7k,1579560961.0,"That's some of the problem here. I can't figure out which General Education courses I want to do, because not all of them may transfer into the program I may eventually go into. Then I'll feel that unfortunately, I'll regret taking X course because it wasn't within my program of study.

I took a Freshman Comp class, History of Rock and Roll class, and a college Algebra II class. I'm in a Liberal Arts General Studies degree. Intro to Literature is something I took because it's generally safe to take for general education transfers into other programs. 

I'm being super cautious."
BackToCollege,ff3wbs3,t1_ff3rbxt,1579550267.0,"I don't know yet as to what field I'm considering right now. I don't know anyone in any field. 

I want to go to school to do something new and my class is 'Introduction to Literature'. I have no other undergraduate degree. It's at a community college. The class goes into many programs and I like English, not to mention that I want to be more social in a real life setting.

I'm doing this with the intent of doing something new with my redundant life, not to mention to foster a career from this along with making friends and or connections."

NoFap,festdtp,t1_fest3md,1579368853.0,Oh wow! I asked you this because I too flatlined immediately after binging on porn for years after one PMO session...so don’t feel alone.
NoFap,fessw86,t3_eqiczf,1579368690.0,When did you flatline? After your relapse?
fireemblem,fer2te1,t1_fer1zhs,1579349035.0,"Gotcha. Thank you. I used an Arms Scroll on Camilla. :-) 

Question, is there a limit to those stat boosting items? Like are there more to get or does Conquest only give you a select few to use?

I like this game, but I’m also trying to tough it out. Sorry if I seemed frustrated.

What levels do you recommend to promote a character with a Master Seal? Exclusively at level 20?"
fireemblem,fer0yae,t1_fer01sx,1579348374.0,Huh?

NoFap,fekfsa8,t1_fejqdf6,1579199127.0,I have a friend who I text non-sexually who gets me aroused just by talking through text. I just worry more about it being a relapse because my penis releases precum as a reaction. But I’ll take your word for it.
NoFap,fejpwip,t3_eop4y2,1579182810.0,Do you get erections when you text your girlfriend? Isn’t that a relapse?

BackToCollege,fejp8qv,t1_fejmlqt,1579182278.0,"Yup yup. I’m looking up careers in web development. Not sure yet if I want to do that, but it doesn’t sound too bad. Programming as a front end web developer seems interesting, but I have to see if I enjoy programming code first."

I'm going to that school to take an Introduction to Literature class (I also enjoy English and this course transfers into lots of other programs), and I'm doing career exploration in the meantime hence why I am asking about programming."

My class is also one that transfers into other degree programs. I don’t necessarily want to do a STEM career, unless I take a particular class that I enjoy that’s a part of that field.

I don’t want to be involved in a career where I dread going to work everyday. That’s what I am doing now (retail) and it sucks. 

I don’t want to go from a job I dislike to school for a job I dislike just for more money."
BackToCollege,fe3j6xd,t1_fe3f12y,1578849686.0,I see. I just really dislike it when STEM majors tend to advise to avoid college if Math isn’t a strength.
