SuicideWatch,fejop8i,t1_fejnr41,1579181828.0,"These are valid points. Psychosomatic symptoms are physiological — psychosomatic does not mean imagined or ""all in your head"", your mind has very real effects on your body. The involuntary muscle movements you mentioned are a very relevant point in particular — I triggered an episode wants playing a video game, a simple little Telegram game called Lumberjack, trying to beat my friends' high scores. I kept tensing up during the game so much, that it made my chest get tight and gave me a particularly bad episode, the effects of which lingard for days. (But hey, I knocked their high scores out of the water.)

Also, alcohol has some peculiar effects on me. I believe I am quite right to say that alcohol actually makes me a better person — and I'm very aware that that is not the normal effect it has. I think clearer, I'm more decisive, less inhibited but still clear thinking enough to be rational, less influenced by anxiety — and I tend to be more aware of and in tune with my surroundings. But I hadn't considered that this could make me more in tune with my body's own sensations — more aware of what I was already physically feeling."
SuicideWatch,feizecd,t1_feiwv2f,1579151566.0,"Well, I've done a lot of pushing through the pain. Especially when I was employed. One more reason why I doubt it was my heart — I soldiered through it for too long, pushed myself too hard when I absolutely shouldn't have, and I'm still breathing without any relevant medical intervention (apart from the occasional cautionary aspirin). And after taking about two and a half months to rest, there are some things that I am able to do now that I haven't been able to do for most of the past year,and I'm not getting the intense episodes that I was occasionally getting off and on — so there has been some net improvement without intervention. I overdid myself today to the point where I was really feeling the tightness in my chest — but after sleeping for 5 hours, I feel great.

Biggest reasons I doubt the costochondritis theory — even about one shot of alcohol and I'm feeling some tightness in my chest and arm. However, this could be explained as psychosomatic. Also, there are various sedentary but intense activities which often set it off — but these too could be psychosomatic, and I haven't had much of a problem with this since things started improving about a month ago. Also, sometimes I do get blood pressure spikes, and when I do I can definitely feel it in my chest and my left arm — but this could be primarily from anxiety. And, being autistic, my senses work weird, and sometimes autistic people can sense things that others cannot (real things, like our natural senses pick them up where other people's miss them). I suppose it's possible that could apply to heart rate and blood pressure. There's also the point that the first time I really had an issue was after a night of drinking — but I only had six drinks, and that could be coincidence.

But heart problems don't explain how I can stretch and pop my chest and get so much relief — like night and day difference, like flipping a switch and turning two-thirds of it off. They don't explain the various times that I experienced the problem more on the right that on the left. They don't explain the numbness in my ulnar nerves that almost always come with it. And they don't explain my unassisted improvement — or how I have persisted to function through so many episodes."
SuicideWatch,fei4uq7,t1_fehp76e,1579130319.0,"Actually, costochondritis has been suggested before by some of my friends online, and I've stumbled upon information about it myself and begun to suspect it. It seems to be the best explanation to fit all the facts I know, but I don't really have a way to test it conclusively, and there are at least a few things that don't 100% fit my understanding of it — but none of them so far off as to even come close to disproving it."
