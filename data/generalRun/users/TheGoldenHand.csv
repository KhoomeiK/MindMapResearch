AskHistorians,feorbvj,t3_eq0hsm,1579304399.0,"This subreddit has become more strict compared to half a decade ago, and the quality of content has only gone *up*. Anyone can post an answer here, that's one of the amazing things about this sub, but it has to withstand academic scrutiny.

Most complaints here have been answered so many times, over so many years, you can't help but feel sorry for the moderation team, that has to deal with a dozen new people not reading the rules every day. This sub is one of the most unique and high quality collection of crowd sourced history digests in the world."
