Also to add a bit of nuance. I don't know the details of how small banks worked at that time, but I think a lot of people in America right now are really raging against banks. Between the 2008 financial crash in the rampant debt that many Americans are in, there's a lot of animosity towards financial sector. 

Again I don't know the details of how a bank worked at that time, but in today's context, which is relevant to the people in this thread, today if I go rob a Bank of America yes technically I'm stealing from the people that investing money in Bank of America. Practically however that's not really how it works. If someone robs a bank the bank doesn't take a few dollars out of my checking account to cover that. That money is insured and even if it wasn't Bank of America has more money then most of us could ever dream of in the day that they charge everyone a dollar to cover some branch getting robbed is the day that people move to Wells Fargo or some other back."
