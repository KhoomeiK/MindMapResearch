So, presumably you can undergo the ritual as many times as your church agrees to allow you to do so before they get fed up of you breaking a supposedly sacred promise."
AskReddit,fetk8by,t1_feti3to,1579376274.0,This is some OTT pyschoanalysis with absolutely no basis in fact. They never once mentioned porn or suggested that they were addicted. All they said is that masturbation is less stressful than a relationship with another person and that's... pretty basic maths? Of course masturbation is less stressful than all the responsibilities and complications that come with managing a meaningful relationship.

AmItheAsshole,fet28ii,t1_fesu0ig,1579371151.0,She's offered to split the cost of a cremation or give her parents $1000 towards the cost. That's more of a shit than her sister deserved.
AmItheAsshole,fet1zr2,t1_fesxcal,1579371068.0,"She posted here to find out if she's an asshole for the decision she's made, not to have her mind changed. This is r/AITA, not r/changemyview"
AmItheAsshole,feryiwy,t1_fern11z,1579359637.0,"Nah, I think it's fair that people are allowed to engage in certain behaviours if they belong to specific demographic. For example, I would allow a man to be as handsy as he wanted with me *only* if he was gay, because his handsiness wouldn't carry any of the connotations that would come from a straight or bi man putting his hands all over his body.

So if I had a friend I was under the impression was gay, I would allow him to behave more freely with me, but if it later transpired that he was straight, those behaviours would be come off-limits. It's no different with language. OP doesn't have to allow straight people to call him slurs just because he is comfortable with a fellow member of the LGBT community doing so."
