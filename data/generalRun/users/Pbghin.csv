They were often the group that would be the first to charge a breach in a wall etc. It was super deadly, but an almost guaranteed promotion if you lived. During Napoleon's time, they would have to turn away people trying to volunteer for it because there would be too many trying to sign up."

bettafish,ff3lbkm,t3_erextz,1579543484.0,I recommend a Nerite snail. Their eggs don't hatch in fresh water and their antennae are pretty small. I had a mystery snail in a betta tank and there was real risk of antennae nipping. I also think they have a lower bio load than Mystery snails.

todayilearned,fe9deom,t1_fdswor5,1578936582.0,"I had mine in 5 gal tanks with lots of plants, filters and a heater. Their water parameters rarely changed and other than daily feeding, I didn't have to do anything with the tank. I did a water change about 1 every month, just because I felt like I should, but their water parameters were fine. If you have a good filter and live plants, it should be almost self sustaining. Again, easier with a larger tank."

todayilearned,fdsi2ml,t1_fdsg7rn,1578703153.0,"Japan has a problem with raccoons due to an anime/cartoon. In the movie, a kid adopts a North American Raccoon, and in the end, releases him into the wild. The Japanese then imported raccoons as pets, and when they turned out too wild to keep, they just emulated the movie and released them. The raccoons are now destroying ancient shrines and temples."
todayilearned,fdsesdz,t1_fdsdqhv,1578701061.0,"A bit of both. I got started setting up heavily planted tanks, so it's a bit like a diorama for me. the fish were at fist secondary. I just wanted something to help the aquatic plants, but now I'm more invested in the animals. I like Bettas as they will actually interact with you and each one will show off their own unique personality. I've had at most 4 at a time (currently at 2). My shrimp tank is purely for looks. They are pretty, and it's neat when they swim up to your hand, but they are low maintenance and the plants in the tank are pretty . The Bettas have as much personality as many other pets. Much more than other, smaller fish at least.

I had a female Betta that whenever you did something she would watch you fascinated, and you could see her get more excited the more you interacted with her or did things around her tank. She was very chill and I had several shrimp in her tank that she would just follow around and watch. I had another female that was the opposite. Feisty and wouldn't stand having anything else in her tank. Anything else that was in her tank was a target for eating. My boy Betta right now is in a large community tank. He swims out when you come by the tank and tries to show off. One of the other (much smaller) fish in the tank stole a worm out of his mouth and he swam back to me looking like he wanted me to do something about it. I will say, you won't get to see the personality of a Betta fish in anything less than a 5gal tank. Also the larger the tank, the less work it is to maintain."
todayilearned,fdsdqbx,t1_fdscpvo,1578700321.0,"I suspect he was exaggerating, but unfortunately probably not that far from the truth. They have a labyrinth organ which means they can breath air, but the amount of liquid in a wet paper towel would probably not be enough to ensure survival for transport, and they would actually need some air to breath.

I have seen bags with them that had perhaps 3-4 tablespoons of water though. Wholesalers of Bettas can be fucking cruel, especially as Bettas have a ton of personality if given the chance. My little guy will swim into my hand if i put in the tank."
todayilearned,fdscrjy,t1_fdscc5x,1578699657.0,The new aquarium store near my place I think is started by someone like that. Worked in larger chain and left to start his own place. Just got a warehouse in an industrial park and converted it to an aquarium. Put up a sign you could see from the freeway and that's how I found it. It seems to be doing well. I hope at least.

todayilearned,fdsbx9b,t1_fdsb14b,1578699076.0,"For fish, absolutely. The ""premium"" fish food is only about $2 more than the regular, and it'll last you years, no no one is getting rich off of the $4-$6 fish food sales. Once your tank is set up, you usually don't buy more things for it. It's just a game of waiting for fish to die and replacing them for the store. 

Fortunately the new aquarium store near my house looks very good, and the PetCo near my work actually seems to care for their fish (and know about aquarium care). I try to make it a point to only buy supplies from those places. The PetSmart on the the other hand..."

Fortunately a new aquarium store opened up and their betters are in actual tanks. When I need a new one, I know where to get him (or her if I'm thinking of getting a sorority)."
PlantedTank,fds47rq,t3_emp2yn,1578694014.0,"That's beautiful, but stay up to date with trimming. I HAD a beautiful tank, but the mosses overgrew everything so much that when I got around to trimming, it looked terrible with everything that was smothered dead, then because of the sudden shift in the amount of planted mass, I got an algae bloom. It is a tank I keep at work so I don't have too much time taking care of it, but dat moss growth Then the rotallia, then the pennywort, then the algae, then the moss again. Never ending. It's in a mostly good state now, thankfully."
