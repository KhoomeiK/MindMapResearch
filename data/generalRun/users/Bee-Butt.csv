I'm severely diabetic. I have zero symptoms until I literally pass out. I cannot tell when my sugar is too high, and by the time I can tell it's too low, I'm usually delirious. 

This moron has no idea how to diabetes."
fatlogic,ffhhhzi,t3_et4l56,1579935466.0,"Well what I mean by ""I want to lose weight"" is ""I want less fat around my organs because It's difficult to breathe now, my knees and hips ache and my chest and stomach are so heavy I can't lay on my back comfortably anymore"".

I gained 35lbs and I'm only 3 months into the pregnancy. Last time I gained nearly 60 and it was torture. Losing it felt like heaven. I don't know how anyone can be happy being overweight because when I am, I am phucking physically miserable and exhausted."
CautiousBB,ffhh3rm,t1_ffg36l9,1579934973.0,"I'm really sorry for your loss. It does seem unfair, but I also feel guilty because it was my own fault sort of. I am diabetic and I didn't know I was pregnant, I wasn't taking care of my sugar levels. If I had known, I would've taken better care of myself and he probably wouldn't be sick now."

CautiousBB,ffg1kgx,t1_ffej251,1579896464.0,Thank you. I'm hoping the only problem is the missing tailbone and that he doesn't have any heart defects or trisomies. The amnio is monday but it'll take days to get the results and it feels like it's taking years even though it's only friday
CautiousBB,ffg1e15,t1_fffdwzm,1579896353.0,My husband wants to abort if it turns out he has a trisomy. I honestly don't know what my opinion is. I can't get over the news that baby is sick in the first place. It doesn't seem real for me

PurplePillDebate,ffg09gc,t3_esyxem,1579895666.0,"We used to both work when we didn't have kids. I'm a stay at home mom now simply because we can't justify the cost of daycare if I work. It's not as comfy as a double income, but it's better than me working 40 hours a week and giving up 2/3rds of my check just to miss out on time with my baby. The small profit of me working just isn't worth it in our opinion. I guess it'd be different if I had a 50k job but I don't lol. He's not rich, EMTs don't make all that much, but we get on just the same."

PurplePillDebate,ffee1y6,t3_esqxms,1579844566.0,"I asked my aunt this question and she just laughed. I can only assume she feels amused that anyone would ask this. My uncle cheated on my aunt when she was hospitalized. He had my mom deliver the divorce papers to her in hosp because he cbf to do it himself. They paid for everything equally, so everything \*accounted for\* was split equally. He hid 10k+ in assets that couldn't be accounted for because he'd bought them with cash (withdrawn from the joint acct). Judge forced liquidation because uncle refused 50% and wanted the whole house to himself, so they were forced to sell it and split the money. Uncle hired a great lawyer to get him full custody. He got half custody with him being the main residence. As soon as the case was over, he dropped his kid off at aunt's apartment and never visited again. He just wanted out of child support, he had no interest of his child at all. Left the state so he could avoid being sued for child support. Aunt sued anyway and won, and now he owes back child support, but nobody can find him to enforce it. His kid obviously wants nothing to do with him now and hung up on him the single time he called. He also didn't support two households, he supported none. His new gf (now wife) paid all his bills off for him and took care of their household because he got fired for negligence for ramming into his boss' car twice in the same month. Last I heard he was a stay at home ""dad"" to 4 step kids (I use the term ""dad"" lightly)."

fatlogic,ffdyy05,t1_fdqb27a,1579832409.0,"Well, it's not about the kcal (""calories"") as in measurement of energy, it's about the nutrients those calories are composed of. Shit diet is shit health. Too many kcal is overweight, which has it's own set of health problems. Too few is underweight. But underweight people can still be full of shit."
AmItheAsshole,ffdyqxr,t1_fdprpfg,1579832267.0,"I am so sorry for your loss, hugs. But that really is a funny story. Now I'm tempted to do the same lol"
AmItheAsshole,fdpr6ch,t1_fdffzy3,1578637377.0,"It's an english slang word. The term is ""Muhajaba"" which is arabic. ""Hijabi"" is just what english-speakers call it. And yes, it's a term that muslims use to define a woman who regularly wears hijab. In Arabic, nicknames are a big thing.

It's a title for a woman who wears hijab, just like ""hajji"" is a title for someone who has successfully completed the Hajj trip. (You'll often hear ""Hajji"" put before an old man or woman's name, since it's usually older people who can afford to go).

And also how ""Umm-"" or ""Abu-"" is the prefix used on someone who has become a new mother or father. ex: ""Umm-amina"" means ""Mother of Amina"", and that will be her new nickname for life."

fatlogic,fdpqd9e,t1_fdobgr5,1578636535.0,"This is so interesting. I got T2 diabetes when I was technically underweight. Apparently my liver just absolutely refused to interact with insulin at all. I also had a shit diet for 10+ years before that, which my doc said contributed to it. My symptoms got better when I cut out the junk food (still on insulin though). Many junk-eaters are overweight, so I think it is absolutely safe to assume that an overweight person that fills their stomach with junk and high-sugar foods also has diabetes or insulin resistance. The chances are higher that they are sick rather than healthy."
AmItheAsshole,fdd7whe,t1_fdcx1b6,1578298809.0,"I always wear a black bandanna because it's the most comfy headwear I own lol. I have dozens of different colored hijabs that were gifted to me by various people, but I just like my soft little bandanna. My husband hates it because he says black is too manly and it makes me look like a biker when I wear it lmao"
AmItheAsshole,fdd6zy5,t3_eklilb,1578297593.0,"NTA. There's nothing wrong with asking her to wear pink. But if she doesn't own one, I'd suggest you buy it for her. Maybe being gifted something beautiful will convince her if she's on the fence.

I'm a hijabi and there is no religious law that says black is required, that is just an arabian tradition that lots of girls copy. Actually, there are hadith (religious books) that say bright colors are for women and men shouldn't wear bright red or yellow, or solid-colored garments, so that they aren't accidentally mistaken for women and treated as such lol. And technically girls are supposed to always have their hands painted with henna to further identify them as female. (I know some people disagree with gender roles, I'm just giving you this info in case some of the crazy fundies here try to convince you black is mandatory and that you're rude for asking)."

This. People with this extremist attitude couldn't care less about non-obese women's rights. Many even shame other big girls for not being big enough, as if they aren't human or worthy of respect. If LIzzo suddenly lost 50lbs, these same women using her as an example would start attacking her like sharks."
