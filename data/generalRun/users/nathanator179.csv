unpopularopinion,fetmirj,t3_eqg8ld,1579376868.0,"Realistically the best way to discuss politics isn't with a left or right spectrum but the political compass. It includes the left and right economics but also libertarian and authoritarian social aspects. For instance both Bernie Sanders and Stalin are left wing but Bernie Sanders is significantly more libertarian (in the traditional sense) than Stalin. Equally so, Hitler and George  W. Bush are right wing, but Hitler was significantly more authoritarian. It's an extremely good way of identifying your political stance."
