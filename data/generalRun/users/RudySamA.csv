firstimpression,feoj4sy,t3_eq233d,1579300834.0,"Jake is an average 21 year old who’s life all changed when he got into his first pick collage. There he meet a girl whom he’s to shy to talk. The girl gives him odd looks which he googles to see if they mean she’s interested. One night of googling however turned into a journey down the dark web that would forever alter his life. Feeling a bit confused about her funny stares Jake decided to download the tor browser and look for free information on the dark web. He typed in “signs my crush like me” . What he found was pretty much basic dark web stuff. Drugs, guns, hookers etc. One link was different though. The link read “she loves you and here’s why” . Seemingly amused Jake clicked the link which lead him to a strange website. Everything was red expect for a black heart emoji. He was baffled yet still intrigued. After he clicked the emoji a video began to play. The video was in what appeared to be 4K but not as well defined. He recognized the footage almost instantly. To his amazement it was one of his professors giving a lecture. The shot than panned to a lap and than quickly to a girl. What Jake was watching than paused and his skin began to crawl. It was his crush. She was giving the exact same look that he was googling. Jake than quickly destroyed his lap top and internet modem in fear that some hackers where stalking him. Shaken up he than began to clean up the broken peace’s of the modem and lap top. As he picked up the screen he noticed something that made him question everything he has ever come to know about reality. The screen was the same laptop in the video. As Jake started to put things together he realized that what he saw in video was the same exact memory that was burned into his brain. His heart started pounding as cold sweat dripped from his pours. He tried to sleep but couldn’t because there was no logical explanation to what had just happened. When the morning came he went to the campus coffee shop and told his buddy about what happened. His friend simply shrugged off Jake thinking he was trying to play a prank on him. At that moment Jake pulled out his phone and went on Reddit and started posting selfies on various sub Reddit’s asking of people tell him about his self, which later lead to this strange comment."

teenagers,fdb70eg,t3_ek3mdi,1578254454.0,It’s a very mature thing of you to come to realization with your vulnerabilities. The human brain does not fully develop until the age of 25 thus meaning any high use of drugs until that age can cause irreversible damage. Initially I attempted to spam this sub with goals of karma farming but I see the youth like yourself take this seriously. So I admit to my mistakes and will now make up for me ignorant ways. In conclusion as someone who once was on a similar path my only advice (if it matters to you) is to continue to explore your inner self without drugs. You’re a smart person who seems to understand the consequences of early age drug use and your efforts to stop are very admirable.
