mylittlepony,ff4xglm,t1_ff4wzrf,1579574784.0,"Throax was already not into what Changelings do since he was a baby. He met Spike later on, went through the whole reformation thing, and tried one of Starlights ideas with handling love. It was Starlight that convinced the Changelings to do the same as Throax, reforming all of them. Chrysalis was spiteful of Starlight making her hive turn against her, and by the time she went through with her revenge plan, the ponies had already befriended the Yaks and Dragons and made them allies."

mylittlepony,ff4332k,t1_ff42g50,1579554480.0,"Weather or not a leader takes an L doesn’t mean anything. During Cadence’s wedding, she traps Cadence in a cave while disguising herself as Cadence to marry Shining Armor. The love Shining Armor has for Cadence is enough to feed the Changelings. What makes her a good leader is her taking part in the attack on Ponyville, and her wanting to keep her hive safe from magic attacks.
