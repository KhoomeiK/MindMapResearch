Some of them feel like no time has passed at all, they’ve just woken from a dream and are convinced that nothing in the Feywild actually happened.  
Somebody’s sure they’ve travelled *backwards* in time, perhaps giving them the chance to undo something they regret or prevent a disaster.  
The others absolutely *know* they’ve lost days, weeks, or even months... however much is enough that they’re guaranteed to be too late for whatever important event is coming.  
And some poor bastard feels jet-lagged for the rest of their life, always out of sync with their own sleeping schedule."

MarvelStrikeForce,fduxmpz,t1_fdtkq2p,1578740621.0,"The meta changes with new characters, and unlocking new characters is done through to blitzes, campaigns, or legendary events. Blitzes are a horrible grind no matter how old your account is, but campaigns and legendary events require you to have certain other characters unlocked to even begin them. Because of that, an older account with a larger roster is probably worth more than a new account, no matter what early advantage you might have in your new arena shard."
