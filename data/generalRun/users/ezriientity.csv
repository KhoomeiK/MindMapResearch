I dreamed of a high building. About 70 stories high. The colors of the outside walls were pink and the windows were tinted blue. (It would look kinda ugly as a real life building to be honest. It had ordinary Roblox graphics, so that’s very dream-like.) The inside walls were purple, and some of it was white. Mermaids dominated that building that turns out to be some magic academy in the sea. Then my eyes slowly opened and I tried my best to fall asleep again. Ended up playing Roblox until 7am. Wow, so much for a 6 hour nap at 6pm on a Friday."

I’ve heard of girls who’d move on to many boyfriends. (Like breaking up with one and moving onto another.) I was concerned about losing my boyfriend that easily. I remember discovering porn and I would always look at the girl with huge tits. As well, I remember my parents shopping in the men’s section and I loved the clothes from there.

I was also bi-curious in 4th grade. I remember being in the locker room and seeing all my half-dressed classmates. In 5th grade, I kissed my best friend and I loved it. In 6th grade, I discovered I am lesbian. I had a lot of girl crushes and all the boys seemed disgusting."
