Drugs,fg09tmn,t1_ffyiaum,1580403294.0,"Happened to me one of the first times that I ever smoked and succeeded in getting violently stoned. Few fatty hits off of a blunt is enough to send any true novice into a spin, however at that phase in my life I was terribly underweight and really didn't eat much. Suffice to say the entire experience was terrifying because, aside from barely having hit the jazz cabbage prior to this, hadn't done any other drugs aside from perhaps a high amount of caffeine..? If that would even count? Lol

Fast forward a couple of years and the tables flip flopped when I was invited to smoke by an elementary/middle school friend. He and his girlfriend were sitting around with me hitting a joint, assuring me that all is well aside from them being giggly and stoned. Dude smokes a cigarette (marlboro red or some nasty shit), we walked into the living room and he starts having a fit, shaking on the floor. Girl got dude onto a couch to help him calm down but holy shit, that was terrifying from the opposite perspective. Looking back it was an extremely hot day...it's always hot here....

HYDRATE OR DIE-DRATE, friends."
