If you deploy him on ranged, every card you play with a Deathwish triggers automatically! Good for a monster deck IMO."

gwent,ff39qwb,t3_ere44i,1579537001.0,"Completely agree!

I'm fairly new to the game so I have only built 2 decks and I play exclusively with them. They are both Monster decks - one is very thrive/deathwish/consume heavy and the other is made up of vampires (with a couple of ogroids as I am yet to be able to make a deck with 25 vampire cards).

I'm slowly learning how the cards complement each other and how to play them accordingly, so I hope to be able to make lots of my own decks in future, across all factions. But it's a real sense of achievement winning a match with a deck you created from scratch!"

gwent,ff2vng3,t3_er7zj5,1579525912.0,"I do this - I actually didn't know until reading the comments that each card played means more XP, but I'll still keep passing with cards left if I've already won. IMO, you've won anyway so it's just overkill if you continue to batter your opponent. 

That being said, I understand people playing cards to fulfill contracts etc so wouldn't personally feel too aggrieved by it. Each to their own I guess!

When I used to play AI on TW3 however, that's a completely different story and I'd regularly employ shock and awe at the end of a round.

Once you get a little further into it though, bikes are very simple to just craft and the materials you need will always just be gained through natural play, so you don’t need to go gathering them or anything. You can make as many as you want :)"
