Also you do realize she wouldn't pursue legal actions because she refused to testify in court? And if someone is a rape victim, why would they settle for anything less than getting justice? You realize it goes both ways in terms of settlements, especially for something as egregious as rape.

And yeah we take offense to the slandering of Kobe's name because he was an inspiration to kids and adults across the globe. He showed us what level you could achieve through hard work and determination. He instilled in us the values of never giving up and never leaving anything on the court in whatever you do in life. He didn't want to be given success, he wanted to earn it. He didn't allow himself to be defined as just an athlete. He was tri-lingual, he was intelligent, he ran charities for the homeless, he coached youth basketball and opened a youth basketball academy, he championed women's sports and fought to give the sports and female athletes themselves the spotlight they deserve.

The dude impacted so many people's lives outside of just putting a ball into a hoop. This went beyond basketball for so many people and Kobe touched countless others off the court in ways that made their lives better and more fulfilled. All you have to do is go watch the reaction videos of people who knew the guy or fans that met him to understand his impact on them and society as a large.

Comparing him to Jake or Logan Paul does a great disservice to the memory of a man that was truly trying to make the world a better place for his daughters to grow up in. So yeah, I'm going to take offense because without Kobe and the inspiration he gave me I wouldn't be where I am today."
pics,ffqodww,t1_ffqktzi,1580139852.0,"Actually what piece of evidence convinces you he did it? Was it the fact she was bragging about having sex with Kobe at a party the same night the alleged rape occurred? Or was it the fact that the rape kit used on her underwear also found the semen of 5 other men? Oh wait, it must be the fact that she refused to testify in court and press felony charges, right? Just because he settled doesn't mean he did it. Moving past the incident as quickly as possible allows him and his family to heal as quickly as possible for his poor life choice to commit adultery. If you don't believe that, then why should anyone believe a rape victim would be satisfied with millions instead of or on top receiving justice by putting their rapist in prison? 

The fact is, the evidence was heavily starting to lean towards exoneration, but hey keep smearing a man's name when he was never convicted for him crime. Remember, innocent until proven guilty. He was never proven guilty."

hockey,ffq0s01,t1_ffpgsgd,1580114154.0,"I mean character assassination is pretty valid when the only evidence to support her claims is he said she said evidence.

I'm not about victim blaming, but the evidence was in Kobe's favor before the settlement. Also, people don't just settle because they're guilty. Some settle because they don't want to spend months or years in court (remember he'd need to travel to those court dates in Colorado when he already travels for a living) and just want to move on so your family can heal. You can say he's an alleged rapist, but you cannot say he's a rapist when the evidence wasn't even close to being as damning as what was presented in the OJ trial."
pics,ffq02lx,t1_ffputgm,1580113137.0,"Evidence pointed to that he didn't. Also sometimes you pay things to go away not because you're guilty, but because you don't want to have to deal with the legal proceedings over the months or even years in some cases and just having it go away allows you and your family to move on and attempt to heal.

Also if you bring up the apology as a ""confession"", that's just him feeling guilty and likely trying to repair his image. 

Anyone who claims he raped her didn't really follow the case closely at all and likely just wanted to justify their irrational hate for the guy just because he consistently beat your team in an arrogant way."

I moved out, got a Switch, got Witcher 3 and man, I keep going back to rocket league and smash even though I want to play witcher. I think the issue with witcher and rpgs in general is that they take time to get to the good stuff. Like the only way I want to play witcher is if I know I have a solid 3-4 hour block of time to play it without interruption. Smash and Rocket League I can pick up for an hour and put it back down feeling accomplished and that I did some fun stuff. That really isn't the case for most rpgs."
nfl,ffcyorn,t3_estzsw,1579810000.0,"I get this has been beaten to death, but like why can't we say you have to be a great regular season QB and also have a title? Like unless you're putting up Marino type numbers for your era, you really shouldn't get a pass for not winning.

If you win 2 titles and don't put up great regular season stats you probably shouldn't get a pass for the latter as well. They're both extremely important and I think it's not bad to have the bar set high for the HoF because having the bar high is what gives it its mystique. We don't want the Pro Football HoF to turn into the basketball HoF where the bar is set rather low for what is supposed to be a prestigious and exclusive honor. 

I get the argument for Eli being a HoF QB, I myself have been going back and forth about it, but I'm on the firm no side now because I believe letting Eli in sets a precedence that lowers the bar going forward. If we let Eli in, then we have to start talking about Nick Foles, who honestly looked overall more impressive in his super bowl run than Eli did (though Eli had more impressive individual plays) in either of his 2 runs. 

The fact is, I think Kurt Warner is the lowest the bar should go for a HoF QB. He was a better QB relative to his era and went to 3 superbowls and won 1. He was in the discussion of maybe not being HoF material and quite frankly it was warranted, but if someone who had a similar post season career and overall better regular season career was almost snubbed, then why should we let Eli in when he's had a less impressive career overall? 

Again I get the argument for Eli and quite frankly I've forgiven him for snubbing my chargers because salty Patriot tears essentially give me life, but his post season career just isn't impressive enough to overcome his rather mediocre regular season averages."

nfl,ff9p5sj,t3_es66hp,1579717781.0,"Damn this resonates with me as a chargers fan. Even when we have a bad season, the team was almost always considered one of the best teams to not make the playoffs (remember when we had a top 2 ranked defense and offense and still finished 8-8 because of our stupid special teams was giving up punt and kickoff returns like they were trying to tackle a make a wish kid?).

Rivers almost always made our team look better than it was and we would say ""oh we had a bad year because of injuries"" or ""Rivers couldn't get over the hump because the O-line was injured"", etc. I think because we didn't have a season where we were dog shit for the whole season (why do we almost always start off shitty then win like 6 to 7 of our last 9 games?) we believed we were always knocking on the door to winning it all and didn't need to make big changes.

I think honestly, Rivers was a great QB, but wasn't good enough to carry this team to the promise land. He could have in a better system like New England, but not in SD. He was good enough to diminish our weaknesses and fool us into thinking we were closer than we actually were, but not enough to overcome them."

Ranch is like Jason Garret, it can make something bad palletable, but it covers up the true potential of what is in front of you because ultimately whatever the dish is takes on the flavor of Ranch.

Ezekiel Elliott is a damn ultra spicy Buffalo wing and Jerry Jones neutralized its power and effectiveness by covering it in ranch (Having Jason Garret run an uninspiring pass heavy offense) instead of letting those spices shine and cause havoc on your taste buds (the defense). 

It took Jerry Jones nearly a decade to realize covering Ezekiel Elliott and the rest of the team in Ranch was wasting his team's potential; it's a new year and decade so take this opportunity to join Jerry and stop wasting the potential of what is in front of you by smothering it in Ranch."
Dodgers,fdhrfhy,t1_fdhowku,1578428713.0,"Yeah it could just be unfamiliarity with the opponent that factored into the slump. Also injuries might have played a factor too.

You also have to remember that Bellinger really cooled off that year as well, which probably came down to other teams figuring out he couldn't lay off of low and inside pitches (remember he was a rookie, so there wasn't a lot of film on him to begin the season).

I think there are just so many normal non-cheating variables that could explain the hot to cold hitting stretch. Plus we got hot again at the end of the season going into the playoffs too, so would that mean we were cheating again?

We were a really good team that year and were astronomically hot and then cooled off. It happens quite often in baseball and I think developing a conspiracy theory to explain something that almost happens every year for one or more teams in the league is a bit of a reach when there is a much simpler and highly more probable answer: We were a very good team that caught fire and came back down to earth a bit with a slump.

todayilearned,fd3oikb,t3_ejwxed,1578160297.0,"Shit, I'm not even a dad and I've changed a diaper (nephew's)... And let me tell you something, it was a horror story.

The year is 2016. I was just a young buck at the ripe age of 24. Sister and her husband needed to go to a friend's wedding and I figured this would be a good chance to add some cute photos of me with my niece and nephew to my Tinder profile (Is that exploiting my niece and nephew, maybe, but it worked. Don't hate the player, hate the game).

So here I am, playing hide and seek and tossing my niece and nephew onto couch like I'm Andre the Giant (like any good uncle would do) and getting them hopped up on chocolate (I'm the fun uncle) when all of a sudden my nephew says ""Uh oh. That's a bad one.""

Now here's the thing, I've never changed a diaper up to that point, but I'm like ""How bad can it be, he's not that big""... Oh what a sweet summer child I was back in 2016.

I lay him down and my niece fetches a fresh diaper. I take the soiled diaper off to uncover a fucking war zone. I let out a giant ""Oh My God!"" and my 6 year old niece runs in and shrieks at the carnage that has taken place in my nephew's diaper. She then yells ""It's never been this big before!!!""

I'm shook. It smells like a rotting corpse smothered in Gerbers baby food. I look at it and I swear it was staring back at me. And while this grown ass man shit lays barely contained in his diaper like a glass of water that is so full only the surface tension of water is keeping it from overflowing, my nephew just lays their cackling like Dr. Evil after feeding his victim to a tank full of sharks with lasers on their heads.

I'd like to say I calmed down, took a deep breath under my shirt (not going to inhale those shit fumes after all), and changed the diaper like an adult. In reality, I quickly wiped his smothered ass and dropped the wipe into the Mt. Everest of shit and ran outside with my niece screaming trying to find the trashcan and tossed that diaper in the can like it was a live grenade.

Of course after disposing of my nephew's home cooked wmd, my niece and I come back into the house where my nephew who is still butt naked is now up with a still somewhat shit covered ass and is about to sit on my sister's white couch. I dove over that couch like fucking Neo in the matrix and stop him by 6 inches from sitting down while avoiding touching the poop smears on his lower half.

We then proceeded to wipe him up and put a new diaper on him. He has the biggest shit eating grin on because he knows he won today, and honestly, I'm not surprised. This is the type of shit you'd expect from a kid that was born 2 weeks early on April 1st."
