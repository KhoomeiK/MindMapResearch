While the title is mostly a compilation of older Sonic games it had a 3D Sonic game unique to it. This was actually an early version of the engine used in Sonic Adventure. Additionally, some of the older games where changed a bit for Sonic Jam. This was also one of only 3 titles on the Saturn with 3D Sonic stuff (the other 2 where Sonic R and Fighters Megamix [which had a few characters from Sonic the Fighters/Sonic Championship])."

retrogaming,fee9bt3,t1_fe99yw2,1579029071.0,"When you say that, do you mean the SNES version of Turtles in Time or the Arcade version? I ask because the SNES version did have some changes to the game compared to the arcade original. The first two were pretty much standard for arcade ports/conversions of the time; downgraded graphics (less colors and frames of animation) and sound. The third was that the SNES version had an extra level using Mode 7. The fourth was that the move where you throw an enemy into the screen was reduced to 3 frames \*\*\* See Note 1 \*\*\*.

&#x200B;

The Hyperstone Heist wasn't a port/conversion of Turtles in Time; however, it did borrow a lot from the SNES version of the game. The sprites and art style are mostly taken from the SNES game. The story is pretty much a copy, paste, and edit from the SNES game as well. Finally, while the Genesis game had fewer levels compared to the SNES game, the Genesis game's levels were longer compared to the SNES game. This basically made both games about the same length.

&#x200B;

Note 1: This was because Mode 7 only scaled backgrounds, hence why the SNES version of DOOM used the Super FX 2 Chip. Compared to the original Super FX Chip, the Super FX 2 Chip could do about twice the polygons and added sprite scaling."
retrogaming,fee61bp,t1_fe74du6,1579027132.0,"It was only ever properly ported/converted to MS-DOS (and compatible computers/OS) and the Commodore 64. The versions on PS3 and XBOX were emulated ports (using either a fancy emulator or a modded/revised/updated version of the arcade ROMs). There was another version for iOS, Android, and Java ME; however, that was more of a re-imagining of the original than a port/conversion of it.

&#x200B;

Edit: I think the MS-DOS port was pretty rare as well, because I've seen copies the game go for $1,000 online (I'm not sure if it sold for that price or not). It should be noted that the MS-DOS port was sold as a Tandy game, but it MS-DOS compatible (I'm guessing the game might had been able to use the Tandy graphics or sound hardware or a special feature in Tandy DOS \[or maybe was sold through Radio Shack\]).

&#x200B;

I'm guessing the Commodore 64 port is rare as well. I think both versions were made and published by the same companies and the C64 version was released after the Commodore Amiga was released. I should mention the Commodore 64 was very popular in the U.K. and Germany (as well as the U.S. and Canada) and was even popular in the 16-bit era for awhile (as a budget computer and games machine)"

I'm guessing it was either named by somebody who didn't really know English or the name was translated poorly or was some kind something which didn't translate well into English (due to poor translating, directly translating the name, some kind of pun which didn't translate well or at all into English [likely due to words being similar in the original language, but not in English]).

dbz,fc9hbc9,t1_fc99rxn,1577552677.0,"Okay.

&#x200B;

On a side note, oddly, the 4th movie of the original Dragon Ball anime was the only time, in the anime, where Bulma's hair was colored purple like it was for a lot of early coloration of the character (although Bulma's hair was never really consistent, her hair kept changing from blue to green in the anime, she had her purple hair in The Path to Power, and the manga had her hair colored black, red, blue, green, and purple\]).
