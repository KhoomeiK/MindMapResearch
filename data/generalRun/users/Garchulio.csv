marvelstudios,ffitu82,t3_ett88j,1579982568.0,"This movie really only deserves to be rated by people who have seen a majority, if not all, of the MCU films.

It's hard to look at Endgame as a standalone film. Especially if you haven't seen the other films. Even if you have only seen Infinity War. Because of the way Tony discovers it, the whole time travel thing sounds like ""a bunch of bullshit"" if you haven't seen Ant-Man and the Wasp for context. Neither of them is in IW, so there's really no explanation of it until Scott shows up in EG.

I don't think it's fair to criticize things like pacing in Endgame due to how unique it is as a film. The same goes for IW. They are very much like Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 of the same event. Endgame starts slow because if it were a graphic novel (like the inspiration), the snap could very well be the mid-way point and it makes sense to slow things down after 2.5 hours of non-stop action.

There are a lot of callbacks in this movie, like when Black Panther calls Clint by his name, that seem corny without the knowledge of previous films, in this example Civil War. Tony playing paper football with Nebula is a drag if you haven't seen Guardians. Not to say people can't just enjoy things they find funny, but her winning that game had a lot more significance in the larger story.

So, as somebody who (like many of you) had seen everything leading up to EG, I would rate it 9.5/10 but wouldn't put it in my top 5 because it's not something I want to watch repeatedly. It's kind of off on its own. The prime example of an event film. I have watched the last hour multiple times since the Blu-Ray came out, though, because it's gorgeous."
marvelstudios,ffirn8j,t1_ffikkvw,1579980992.0,"People pretend Disney/Marvel tells writers and directors *exactly* how to make their movies. In reality, it's more like they have a few meetings where they bring up plot points in other films in development and how they want to connect the universe. For example, the Doctor Strange scene in Ragnarok. They probably met with Taika and asked him to include a meeting with Doc somehow so it would make sense for Bruce to be sent down to the Sanctum in Infinity War."

greenday,ff61mgn,t1_ff5abb3,1579616827.0,"There is zero complexity to any of the songs so far. Yeah, Green Day has a very simple song structure by nature, but this album is *literally* copy+paste. My Joan Jett remark was regarding them releasing a whole single that has barely any original writing in it, which is fine, really. But it takes up 3 minutes of the album, where the ""original"" singles only come it at like 90 seconds each.. 

I've made other comments acknowledging it, but I'll say it here, too: Just because there was a minimal effort put into the music doesn't mean they aren't having fun with them. They are very much playing around with their recording equipment making ""silly"" songs to have a good time because if they truly are fucking with WB on this last album, they may as well have some fun. That said, you can write/record a song without taking it too seriously, which they are clearly doing, but the quality of the song will greatly suffer when the finished product is a minute-and-a-half dance beat.

They might be putting a lot of work into, say, the melodies? I know they (or just Billie) don't want to do another 9-minute medley, but there is no reason they would cut this album at the bare minimum time required if they were really digging deep into the songwriting. If this was really meant to be the next big sound for them, they would have made longer songs and released as an alter-ego project like The Network or Foxboro Hottubs."

If you look at my older posts, you'll see I firmly believe in the conspiracy that they have another project that they will be releasing some time after their contract ends.

WreckingBallMains,ff3sf7b,t3_erdrwo,1579547845.0,"One of my strats is making sure I have all of my abilities ready to go because I use them all at the same time. Start off by swinging into (preferrably a crowd, but most importantly the healers or squishies) enemies and immediately piledrive onto them and activate your shields. The swing/piledrive combo can deal a ton of damage to squishies and your shields will let you empty some of your mag before heading back to your team for protection/heals. If you manage to swing/piledrive a healer or squishy, you can usually finish them off with like half of your magazine.

Remember that your shields give you more protection when there are more enemies around you so it's best to activate them after you piledrive the crowd.

So:

Start off with your team, or close enough that you can see them and cover them with some gunfire if you have to, swing into enemies, immediately piledrive, activate shields, try to finish somebody off for just a couple of seconds. By now you should have your hook back and you can use it to get away and start all over. If you still have a lot of health, you can even pretend to swing away but then come back for the cheap shot and swing into the enemies again. This is riskier if they are aggro on you, but if they are scattered enough, you can be really annoying. If you need health, remembering where health packs are is key because healers will have a bad time trying to heal you back to full health if you are low.

Careful playing against hard counters like Sombra or Mei because they can stop you in your tracks, but playing more conservativecan help. Like sticking with your team and using your hitscan until you hear Sombra hack somebody, then going in for the disruption and getting out of there before she can hack you."
