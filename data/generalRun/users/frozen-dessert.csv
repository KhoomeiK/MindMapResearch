Ex: When using Molino Caputo for focaccia it is easy to use 90% hydration but this T65, I think the name is Gruau D’Or, works best with 77%.

Breadit,ffnwxbd,t3_eucj5t,1580071806.0,"Yes the video is lame. I wish iMovie allowed me to rotate the photos while collating them in the video. I searched on the web and it apparently it is possible but on my phone it just doesn’t work. Apologies.

Anyways, following up a request from u/vgm106 here is a sequence of images of how my dough looks like and it how it looks baked.

I live in the Netherlands. It is always humid. Kitchen temperature is at max 23°C or a little lower.

Here is a description of what I do:

(This is roughly the “baguette a la ancienne” recipe from Bread Bakers Aprentice). 

I always put the water in the fridge before mixing. Mix water, yeast and salt all at once. Use pure salt, as iodine interferes with the fermentation. It gets mixed in under a minute in a kitchen aid. Then I let it rest in the fridge for ... a while. Like 1 to 3 hours. Then I stretch and fold between 3 and 6 times. 

Dough is then left in the fridge for at least an evening. It normally leaves the fridge before breakfast and I end up baking it for lunch in this Emily Henry baking clay tray for baguettes (it had a lid, so it helps holding the humidity in place.)

I normally use 77% water or 80%. Salt is around 1.7%. Water is normally at the temperature of the fridge 4°C. 

Hope that helps."

icecreamery,ff5iu3g,t3_eqpuq5,1579594869.0,"The freezing point depression of milk salts are included in standard calculations of it. 

If you take a look at the excel formulas presented in “Ice Cream” from Goff & Hartel, they use a constant value that you multiply against your total weight of “Milk Solids Not Fat”. (MSNF) That constant already aggregates the correct values for the salts and minerals normally present in milk. Or so they claim, I didn’t check their math. 

I once posted a Google Drive spreadsheet in this sub. Even my spreadsheet does the milk salts calculation. 

Also notice that the same book explains that the tables that everyone(?) uses to calculate FPD have deviations here and there. Those all look super small to me. There are links to articles there. Perhaps people in the industry would care about those things. I’m an amateur and I definitely don’t. Point being that making the calculations more accurate would require much more complicated formulas.

My kitchen oven is very small. Replacing that with a real normal sized oven would require, well, remodeling the kitchen.... I bake bread in a regular oven in garage, that one is old and damaged by too much use of steam. It doesn’t reliably get hotter than 230°C, most often it will be below that.

I have a few questions motivated by my quest for a pizza oven:

- I’d like to **avoid** those leopard spots often seen in Neapolitan pizza. Is it feasible to bake at 400/450°C and avoid those? (If I can’t avoid it, I might just not bother with an oven that reach these temperatures)

- [Ooni Koda](https://uk.ooni.com/products/ooni-koda)

Any comments on ease of use? Heat distribution being decent or not at any of these ovens? Would recommend (or not) any of these based on your usage of them?

....

 My own comments on these ovens...

Yes, I get it. The Ooni is a beauty. But I don’t have gas at home (would have to use a camping bottle) and we have awful weather where I live (Netherlands). So outside baking would be an exception. 

The Effeuno is probably a better oven than the Ferrari but it is very heavy and relatively difficult to move.

The Ferrari, well, it seems like a tried and true formula. It is light and it would be easier to tuck it away when not in use.

Any comments/insights/recommendations appreciated!"

1. (However annoying it might be to listen to this) honestly there many many many great things about pursuing a PhD. The freedom to explore. The vast amounts of time to tinker etc. But, yes, the pay is shitty. Are you surprised? You shouldn’t.

2. (For all I know) You are an expert at your field. You probably know more about ML than that person making 4x your salary. Please don’t let your vanity blind you to the fact that there are probably many *many* things that that person with the higher salary knows how to do well and about which you wouldn’t have a clue about where to start.

Bringing stuff to production is hard. (In general) That algorithmic piece that you spend so much time on is probably 5% (or less) of the total amount of work that it takes to bring the solution to production. Try to reading this paper (if you haven’t yet) https://research.google/pubs/pub43146/
