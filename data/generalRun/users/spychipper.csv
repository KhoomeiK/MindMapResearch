The house does have subpoena authority, but aside from the Sargent of Arms of the house no real law enforcement people to go grab someone and force them to obey the summons. They *could* try that, but it's not been done for a century and is something of a bad path to take. 

The other route, not taken, would have been to use the courts to enforce the subpoena. Disobeying a congressional subpoena is a federal crime. That would have resulted in a long drawn out legal dispute.

People forget that before Fox came along and shit all over every news org not owned by Fox in the interest of higher profits that news reporting was in the largest part trustworthy and serious journalism. The often over-hyped ""scandals"" that made many well known actual journalists leave the field? They were pushed most heavily by Fox as a competitive advantage.

They suddenly became personal failures of the reporter or anchor, who you could ""no longer trust!""
