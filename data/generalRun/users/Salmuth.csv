The issue is giving money to voters for their vote is literally buy votes. It's like contracting people to vote for you. Do you see how dangerous that is and why he had to stop his experiment? If this is allowed, tomorrow, Besos can present himself and propose X$ for every citizen that votes for him (make it look like an experiment like Yang's universal income).

I think no understanding the dangerousness of his experiment during a campaign and taking this risk was amateurish. He was talking about his experiment last summer for a few weeks before being told it was (kind of?) illegal (I believe Warren told him so, maybe others).

So announcing an experiment that could force you to drop out of the race, maybe pay fines or worse, all this without knowing the risks apparently, well I think it's amateurish.

This is where you are really far from me. I consider myself citizen of the world. I don't care about nations and borders. Nationalism (loving yourself (your nation/people/whatever) and loving the others less) is not something I can relate to. To me it's a very close minded and a closing mind concept. Sad.

You take the example of countries that didn't exploit or colonize other countries. They have close to zero immigration coming in. They are really irrelevant to the discussion about immigration we're having.

The funny part is that you focus on the ""self loathing filled with white guilt"" thing when really I tell you I studied immigration and multiculturalism. Stop with the emotion BS and check stats, economists and other empirical elements instead of trying to demean my point of view with the only subjective part of my argumentation. I guess that's what people do when they don't know what they talk about.


Edit (typos and this:)
About white guilt. Be sure I'm fine. I do not consider myself anywhere near who the colonizers were. I don't relate to them, but it's my legacy still. I mean I live in this legacy (the wealth of 'my country' partly comes from this Era). Being aware of contexts and inequalities and wanting some justice for ALL (not for me only, not for ""my people"" or ""my country"" only) doesn't necessarily mean I feel guilt at all.
White guilt to me is kind of an excuse for conservatives not to evolve from white nationalism, communitarism or what ever people hide behind.
So when I think about the past (slavery, colonialism...), it makes me sad because the story is, not because my ancestors were the badies."

Most of European immigration is very much skilled and educated.

Do you consider every single brown non Christian people to be rapists exactly? You're probably a Trump supporter aren't you?

Why do they come to Western countries? Because we colonize the shit out of the world, providing to those population access to our languages, easier travels and often already existing communities in the ex-colonizer countries.

White man exploited the world, I'm ok with the world benefitting from the best the western world has to offer. It's a fair deal for me.

About Muslims, I work with plenty of northern Africans. They're not all Muslim at all so stop thinking it's a muslim invasion. They (Muslims) represent such a marginal number in Europe despite decades of immigration it's time people stop with this... It's just another way to make the western world afraid of some chimera.

Stop watching Fox news. Check your facts. Every single argument you use is utterly wrong. Researchers will tell you how wrong you are if you don't pick the fox (or others) tainted version.

I have Christian friends, Muslim friends. It's just a matter of respect. If you respect them, you impose their respect. If one still doesn't, it's an individual issue, not a belief one.

So whatever the BS comes from religious people, hate is not the way to handle it. Religion is the cause of many arms but also many goods and it's hypocritical to only look at one face of religions.

Now I've heard of this sub as toxic, and this post sounds like an apology for hating on religions rather than saying ""it's not true"". I'm disappointed by the way this community responded (explaining why it's ok to hate is actually what I hate about religions).
