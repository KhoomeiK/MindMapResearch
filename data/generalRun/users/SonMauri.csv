Had you tried doing Interchange raids? You sometimes spawn as a Scav with a backpack in the middle of OLI... you can easily make 200k there looting hoses, motors or gas tanks.... As a PMC you can fill your backpack just wondering on the edges on the map and sometimes you can get some cool goodies buried on some ""hidden"" stash.

I'm wondering if the instantaneous dropping and equipment of items is subject to change in the future. I mean, loading/unloading a mag takes ages for realism sake yet moving a couple of mags from my vest to an armored vest equipped to a corpse, dropping mine and equipping his takes  3 seconds. If the game is going for a realistic approach shouldn't some actions take a certain amount of time? Also, the ""order"" of items should also be taken into account, for instance there's no way I can put a tactical rig without removing my backpack first.
