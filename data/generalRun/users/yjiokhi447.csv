SuicideWatch,fc5ehcn,t3_eg7ky5,1577455185.0,I'm sorry you feel that way. I can never truly understand your pain. I have felt this pain but probably not to your extent. Have you tried talking to any professionals about it?

a) they'll die soon anyway
b) they're all diabetic
c) they're old so they probably have an image of you when you visited them 5-6 years ago, which is when you were younger, dumber and smaller in general."

SuicideWatch,fblb7jw,t3_edt8bq,1576960607.0,"I'm sorry that they treated you like that.
