Letterboxd,ffehl5k,t3_et5yi3,1579848311.0,I always wondered about this and movies that haven’t come out yet with really high or low ratings.
bulletjournal,ffbe6ag,t3_esdpto,1579761476.0,this happens to me often and i’m on my third year tracking moods. It really helps going through my photos and text messages (sometimes me browser history) just to see where i was at. Usually if that doesn’t help and i don’t remember anything particularly outstanding i’d just track it as “average”.
bulletjournal,fezsnfc,t3_er0kdd,1579461139.0,stamps or stencil? I love this kinda stuff.
bostoncalling,fewatk7,t1_fetd8e6,1579407690.0,"I get what you mean, but as someone who’d travel in for this fest, I’d like any info sooner rather than later."
bulletjournal,fehs5l5,t3_ep4f4n,1579122799.0,did you already have all the materials she used or did you substitute for things you already had?

notebooks,fdiexn6,t3_ejzwi5,1578441364.0,"Don't know if you've found a solution to this yet, but I bought this book a few months ago and made my own cover for it. 

I mainly used [this tutorial](https://janecanblogdotcom.wordpress.com/2015/06/02/wrapped-books/) I found online which was really helpful. I used thick cardboard paper covered with a fabric I had at home from Michaels ([I posted it in a different subreddit-it's the last book](https://www.reddit.com/r/bujo/comments/djwple/my_rhodia_ran_out_of_pages_so_new_book_a_little/)), but you can use a variety of materials.

I also saved these two tutorials if those might help you: [1](https://www.handsoccupied.com/how-to-diy-the-perfect-book-cover/) & [2](https://www.tidbitsandtwine.com/diy-stamped-kraft-covered-books/)

The good this about the Stalogy is that it's a flexible cover so it's pretty easy to move in and out. (Also unrelated, but while I love the Stalogy, since the pages are pretty thin, I suggest being super careful while turning to not skip pages)"
SCBuildIt,fdi9tan,t1_fd237tv,1578438322.0,how often have you gotten that task? i've gotten it twice since the update and don't want to upgrade my cards and then get the task (which i know if kinda how the game works). i've been playing in metropolis league mainly.
oscarsdeathrace,fcj7vh1,t1_fc8im11,1577679481.0,somehow you've said exactly how I feel.
harrystyles,fb30nyh,t3_eb6t7h,1576461503.0,"I think the songs I like from the first album I really LOVE (I honestly think Sign of the Times might be one of my favorite songs ever). But also we've had two years to fall in love with the songs from the first album, vs. two days for this one.

There were a couple songs (Only Angel most specifically) that I didn't care for until I heard it live and now it's one of my favorites, so I assume the same will happen with this album. And while I enjoy the ""sound"" of the first one more, I think his song writing has gotten a lot better with this second album."
