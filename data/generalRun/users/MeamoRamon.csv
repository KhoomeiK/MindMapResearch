The longest I sat in a row was like 3 h. So even for my smaller pieces I had to come in twice. If I'd start a sleeve that would probably never get finished xD"

That blue light on top of the car is not for fun, it's for an emergency that they wanted to go to. 
The odds of another train coming at exactly the same time was pretty slim. Yes he should have be more careful and check the other side either way. But what it was a new colleague who still gets freaked out/nervous in emergency situations?
Everyone who works as police/fire fighter/paramedic knows how careful they have to drive with the emergency lights on, but accidents still happen."
