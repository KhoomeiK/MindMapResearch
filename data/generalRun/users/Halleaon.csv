skyrimmods,ff5j7j1,t1_ff5imiw,1579595391.0,"since it was originally an LE mod which i'm assuming you're porting over to sse itself, did you run the files through nif optimizer before or after testing it the first time? not all .nif files need to be converted for sse, so if one fails after being converted, i'd try that file in an unconverted format. Other than that you could try checking the files for compatability with nifscan. otherwise, no idea. good luck though. Personally, if it got to be too much of a pain, i'd probably go into the creation kit and just assign the actor a different outfit and call it good."
skyrimmods,ff5icbx,t3_erpdk3,1579594207.0,I had this happen with a recent mod myself and it turned out to be a bad .nif file in amongst the meshes from when the mod was converted from le to sse. I just ran the mesh folder in the mod through sse nif optemizer and replaced those files in my data folder to fix.
AskReddit,ff4qhu8,t3_erhu3x,1579570004.0,"Had a dream where the earth underwent another great war, only this time it was so bad even the non-humans made themselves known.

 There were three factions; the green faction full of people that believed the earth should be allowed to regrow it's forests and erase all trace of mankind except those that could live in harmony with the earth. the second group was the red faction, that was full of psychotic masochists out to kill everyone and everything that moved. and the black faction, that were mostly trying to just survive and had both humans and non-humans (vampires, demons and the rare werewolf)

In the dream I had been forced to undergo a trial in a alternate universe that had the ability to look upon all the infinite universes and see the outcomes of all choices through all time. I was supposed to be sent to one of the parallell worlds and survive for 3 days. 

I got dropped in the three-factioned version of earth in the remains of an underground building full of people that had been infected with some sort of parasite that took over their minds and made them act like raging people-eating psychos.

 I'm standing there, wondering wtf is going on and a group of people in the black faction run up and spray paint my side with black paint 'declaring' that I'm now part of their faction. (apparently that's how they induct new people, whether they want to be inducted or not). I get dragged out of the tunnels back to their base.

 I spend the next 2 days going on patrols with them 'under supervision' to get supplies and prove my worth and become tentative friends with this vampire guy who's pretty high ranking but is something of a loner (i get the impression in the dream that he either wants to seduce me or feed on me, possibly both so i keep him at a safe distance). on the third day he, i and the rest of my 'squadron' are sent into the tunnels for more supplies, we get to this hallway with a room at the end and there's 6 of the parasitic inside.

There's no way our group can fight them, we'd all die. the parasitic have superhuman strength and speed. So  i  yell for the others to get out of there, planning to sacrifice myself. the vampire guy throws me a look but nods and runs with them to get them out, and I stay to fight the parasitics. I fight them like some sort of badass,I  knock out all 6 after a long hand-to-hand combat type of battle and out of nowhere a big baddie, apparently the leader of the parasitics, who's the bald middle-aged guy with the persona of hannibal lector shows up, out of nowhere and grabs me, I can't get free and he's about to put one of those parasites in my head via the back of my neck and I wake up. 

Honestly, so curious was was going to happen next. I was pretty dissapointed when I woke up. It was getting to be like a really good dystopian action flick."

we didn't realize why until we saw the conductor hop out and waive at us with both arms. not knowing what was going on we hopped in our boat and headed across the lake. once we arrived we realized what was wrong. At the far end of the lake there was a cattle ranch. The cows had gotten out and were now wandering the tracks and blocking the train. Behind them was the trestle over the water they didn't want to cross and in front of them was the train, who's engine was loud and they didn't want to pass, we had some colorful beach towels in the boat so my dad, me and my twin sister jumped up to shore with our towels and proceeded to herd the cows pass the train engine back towards the farm.

apparently beach towels are more terrifying than a train engine. Eventually the train gets to move on and we spend the next hour or two herding cattle down the tracks to the farm. We had to stop half way and had a bit of trouble however as one of the cows had been hit by the train and had been dragged hundreds of feet down the tracks. It wasn't pretty, it smelled awful, and my sister became a vegeterian for the next year. Eventually we got the cows home minus the one fatality."

Anxiety,fcn5tw4,t3_ei0gsi,1577804049.0,"since always, some of my earliest memories are of being too shy to talk to people, even relatives. To be honest I think a lot of my anxiety came from being an identical twin, there was this dual need to be an considered an individual (because I never was) but at the same time not wanting to be judged, coupled with the fact I never got any social skills because why get social skills and interact with others if my best friend (aka my twin) is right there with me 24/7? it only really got terrible though after me and my twin moved to different places after high school and I no longer had that support there."
offmychest,fcn1t8k,t3_ehyc7q,1577800839.0,"I sympathize. A few years ago I had a cat that was seemingly healthy who one afternoon had some sort of episode where she suddenly stiffened up and fell over and couldn't move , i immediately drove her into the vet who chalked it up to arthritis saying she tweaked her back and would be fine. she was dead the next morning. It wasn't arthritis. She'd suffered a stroke."

We found him at our cabin where he'd fallen out of a nest after a storm, he was a juvenile and didn't have flight feathers yet and our cabin was on a boat access only lake ages away from the nearest town. The nearest wild bird rehab was even further and we had no phones (this is before cell phones were a thing) .

So the remaining 2 weeks we were up there we kept him in a shelter made of wood and chicken wire and every day me and my sister would go down to the lake and fish for small bass and bluegill and bring them up to him. We named him Cody.

 At the end of our time up there we took him with us back to town and called the nearest wildlife rescue. They took him in and for a number of years would take him around to the local gradeschools (he was very tame by this point since we'd had him for so long and so early) to teach them about raptors.

 eventually he got some sort of injury and they had to perform a surgery to fix it. He died under anesthesia. You don't realize how big they really are until you see one up close. Our cat was terrified of him."
