c128,ffi9pbb,t1_ffi94z6,1579968670.0,Hah! True. The text RPG my kids and I have been working on is definitely better in 80 column mode. :-)

AskReddit,ffi1cno,t3_etqdmc,1579962130.0,"Eat less, exercise more. Exercise can just be going for a walk every day, just a couple of miles. 

The most important part is eating less.  Use _My Fitness Pal_ or _Lose It_ to help with that.  You don’t have to starve yourself.  You can still enjoy food, just eat less of it. Chewing slowly (try to chew 20 times before swallowing each byte,) will also help you eat less. 

If you go out to eat, when you get halfway through your meal, get it wrapped up so you don’t keep picking at it."

Now, if only the floppy drive on this Toshiba T4850CT I just received wasn’t DOA!  The seller has at least agreed to ship me a replacement floppy drive and a larger hard drive. The tear down to get to the floppy drive on this laptop is going to be painful, according to the service manual.  **What do you mean this isn’t the “really old Toshiba 486 Laptops subreddit?”**"
c128,fet6y4x,t1_fet5wg3,1579372345.0,"Thank you for this response. Everyone in this subreddit is amazing. :-)

So, the 1084 I ordered has a CVBS/RGB switch. It has a round 8 pin input, in addition to video, Chroma and Luma. 

I’ve ordered this cable from eBay (thanks to /u/Timbit42, and hope it will “just work” for 80 column mode.

c128,fet2w2n,t1_fet1yyq,1579371314.0,"THANK YOU, /u/Timbit42! This looks like what I would need. I ordered one.  I will let you know if it works once I have the 1084 monitor and cable. :-) 

In the interim I’m hoping yellow/red//white will work for 40 column mode.

This is my new favorite subreddit. :-)"
c128,fesof0j,t1_fesmu4p,1579367402.0,"Well, I had not even heard of the 1080, until now. 

Anyway, that’s a piece of the of the puzzle I am still missing: what cable do I use to connect the c128 to the 1084 to get both 40 and 80 column mode (or at least 40 column)?

The back of the 1084 has several connectors and toggles.

The cables I have:

* 5 pin round din video cable that plugs in to the c128, and has yellow (video,) black (audio,) and I believe white and red are chroma/luma. Hooking yellow and black up to an LCD TV works. 
* 8 pin round din, which has s-video, in addition to red/white/yellow
* my c128 came with the 9 pin RBGI cable, and what I originally thought was a video cable looks like it is a serial cable (round 6-pin).

**So, what type of cable do I need to connect my c128 to the 1084?**

It looks like at least initially I can use the 5-pin I have, direct to the back of the monitor (yellow, red, white), and I’m assuming there is an audio input somewhere.  Then the RGBI would somehow need to go in to one of the round ports? Is there an adapter for that? Or is there a 9-pin 2 row to 9-pin round cable? I suppose I should do some google searching.

**UPDATE** /u/Timbit42 may have found the cable I will need on eBay. It goes from db9 to round 8pin. I’ve ordered one ($30, shipped) and should have it (and my 1084 monitor,) by next Saturday. I will report back whether it works or not, to help any future Commodore noobs.

**UPDATE** The eBay seller found an RGB cable and will include it with the monitor. So now I will have 2, I guess. :-)"
c128,fes8tz4,t1_fepwwv0,1579362635.0,"Thanks. I will likely be adding a 1902 to my collection, if I can find a good deal on one. 

Ok it’s not much of a collection, yet., but at least I’ve started collecting stuff. :-)"
c128,feryvb5,t1_ferhe8j,1579359768.0,"Hello! I did check, after I had already purchased the monitor, unfortunately. This particular 1084 has round connectors. 

This is the actual back. I don’t have the monitor yet, but the seller took a pic for me.

I’m hoping I can figure something out to get it to work. If not, I might also buy a 1902 at some point."
c128,fepp4w5,t1_fepol02,1579326668.0,"Nice. I will poke at it tomorrow. Right now I’m taking a break from writing the text RPG for my kids and messing around with the _commodore4ever_ v2.1 WiFi modem I got. 

Apparently, it doesn’t come with a disk to help you get set up, and, I currently don’t have a way to get a terminal program. Even if I can download a d64 image, I can’t do anything with it. I even have an old Windows PC running Vista with a 5.25 floppy drive... 

I also have a 2400 baud Aprotek Modem, but that also didn’t come with any disks. Yippy!"
c128,fepo7i2,t1_fepo2nz,1579325860.0,"But, the only other option would be to save with a new file name every time. I only want to save as a new file when I consider it warrants a new version number... :-P

What’s the corruption bug? Is there a way to check what ROM version I have?"
c128,fep6g7e,t1_feov21i,1579313196.0,"Thank you! I actually just ordered a 1084 on eBay after reading a bunch of stuff. At one point I freaked out and thought I goofed and bought a monitor not capable of 80 columns.  Then I saw this site:

http://www.vintagecomputer.net/browse_thread.cfm?id=719

Along with your informative post, I am happy I bought a 1084 again, and really looking forward to receiving it.  

Thank you for your response. Seriously, that’s the most useful thing I’ve read on the Internet today."
c128,fenztaw,t1_fenxhn6,1579293138.0,"Huh... ok. So, the cable is this one:

Currently I am getting video on to the TV via the yellow cable. This cable only has RCA connectors: Red, White, Yellow, and Black (no s-video).  I will try switching the cables around and see if I get audio. 

I also have a second cable on order (hasn’t arrived, yet,) which has 8 pins, and an actual s-video connector in addition to red/white/yellow. 

And, I also have a 1084 monitor on order. Need to have that 80 column mode... :-)

**Edit:** son of a gun, _black is audio._  I should have read the description more carefully.  I just assumed white or red would have been used for the mono audio.  DERP. 

**From the listing:**

> This will allow you to connect your Commodore 128 to your TV with AV inputs, or a 1702 Monitor using the front connection ports.

> Plug the cable into your Commodore 128
YELLOW end to VIDEO on your display device
BLACK end to AUDIO in your display device

Going to go plug in the black cable to the TV audio input and try the BASIC one line song POKE 54272

**UPDATE** yep... plugged the black one in to the audio plug and I have audio!"
c128,fenqna7,t3_d6ux89,1579289388.0,"Oh no! I’m 118 days too late! I only just got my C128 yesterday, and my kids and I wrote a mad-lib program since I don’t have any other peripherals or disks. :-P

Well, my 1571 just arrived 30 minutes ago at least, so I could save the mad-lib program to disk (left the c128 running overnight so we wouldn’t lose the program)."
c128,femp8pa,t1_fax2anp,1579265471.0,"I just received my C128 yesterday, but my 1571 didn’t arrive until today, and my SD card reader shipped from Ireland and won’t get here for weeks. I also have a 486 laptop, but my XM1541 parallel cable also shipped from Europe and is two weeks out, so I feel your pain. :-(

I just ordered a pre-assembled HAT with case and memory card, from GB. $25 GBP, plus $10.50 for shipping. And it even includes a case and SD card! Should take 10 days to get here.  Not bad at all.  All you need to do is plug it in to the Raspberry Pi 3B+. 

https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F254156872867

I’m likely going to return the 2 SD2IEC variants I ordered, when they arrive.  I wish I had seen this post before I ordered the SD2IEC. The Pi1541 seems like a much better solution, and you can daisy chain more serial devices, like the 1571."
