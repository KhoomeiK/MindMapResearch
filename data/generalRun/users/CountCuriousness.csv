If you heard from the news that ""the police had to defend themselves against armed terrorists seeking to kill authorities"" you don't think you, or most people, would be less likely to grab their guns and go rebel? Were more people incensed to go rebel and overthrow the government after Tiananmen square? 

But I don't expect serious answers from a pro-gun nut. I can't have a real discussion with you, because you can't reason a person out of a position that they weren't reasoned into. I've had this conversation multiple times. No arguments matter, because you just want to keep your guns, regardless of literally *anything*. Keeping tyrants in check, home defense, overall crime rates, nothing matters in the slightest, because you're - probably, I could be wrong, but I'm not - just a supremely hardcore hobbyist, and no amount of arguments will persuade you in the slightest.

Leave your emotions and warm feelings about your precious gunz at the door if you want to continue, please, because I don't give a shit about them."

Edit: I forgot, all you bitches think you're fucking Rambo and would be motivated to go rebel in case you heard about people getting killed by the state. You forget that you're probably unintelligent, and that you'd probably even be against the ""terrorists who opened fire against the honorable police"". I get the sense that you'd only rebel in a *VERY SPECIFIC* circumstance where the state is *SPECIFICALLY* suppressing the *ONE* right you care about, which is guns, and the rest just gets swept under the rug.

If you're truly caught in the shit spiral, or if you had magic prescience of your guaranteed-to-be-shitty-future , why would you though? If life has *nothing* but badness to offer you, it's not entirely unreasonable to spare yourself that.

I don't know, I think I'd feel a particular kind of bad if I was one of the ones whom it certainly didn't get better for. I'm not quite sure what alternative I'm offering - perhaps concrete advice or even personally offering your time, as you did - I just find ""it gets better"" to be a bit useless... advice?

Not to be a pessimistic asshole, and of course no one has access to said magical foresight, but if I had been promised that it'd get better and I ended up in the same shitty middle age life as I knew in my 20s I'd get, I think I'd be more likely to off myself than if no one had pretended it got better. No broken promises or shattered expectations, no rug pulled from under my feet, just life in all its unfathomable shittiness and my enduring.

Edit: Someone actually went into this:
>Suffice to say that at some air speed the lift force will be enough to counter the cow’s weight. A simple extrapolation of the lift force vs. wind speed diagram indicates that this will occur at ~1000 km/h. At that point the cow won’t be able to stop being lifted off the ground.

He's the teleprompter president, as in every time his supporters praise him for being ""presidential"" it's when he's reading a pre-written speech. He's openly talked multiple times about running a third time - something many rightwingers were *certain* Obama would do. He used congressionally approved military aid to make an international ally investigate a political opponent, and fucking got impeached over it, all while republicans are vehemently defending him (if a hypothetical president Clinton did this, you'd have never, EVER stopped talking about it). Fiscal responsibility and the national debt, which the conservatives crowed about for 8 years under Obama? He blew a hole in the deficit with unpaid for tax cuts. 

Not to mention he's enriching himself through his office by not separating himself from his personal business, he shut down the government over wall funding (he took responsibility for it while somehow trying to blame democrats), and he took a big shit on USA's reputation by pulling out of the Iran deal, showing the world for decades, maybe generations, that the USA cannot be trusted to keep its deals.
