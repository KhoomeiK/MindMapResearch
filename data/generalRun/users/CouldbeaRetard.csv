Outside of that, it has been stated many times throughout the franchise that only one 'gate can be open at a time within one locality. The size of this locality has not been stated but it is at least the area of a planet and it's orbit.

It is not clear if the 'gates need to be programmed to work between model or if it was simply a security protocol put in place to protect earth. It may be only that an intergalactic wormhole from anywhere in the Pegasus galaxy needs a control crystal for the permissions. Regardless of that, the Pegasus 'gates are shown to have no problem operating in the Milky Way without issue.

There hasn't been any indication that the setup in the Midway station would not be bound by the normal restriction of one active 'gate per locality."

I'm specifically talking about when, in the episode *48 Hours*, they shift the iris backwards to block the aperture of the 'gate. This works effectively like a coverstone and prevents anyone from dialling in and killing Teal'c."
Stargate,fere45t,t1_fer6kx7,1579352816.0,"You are looking at a much broader topic than I was commenting on. I was simply referring to when solid matter is physically blocking the majority of the aperture and making an initial connection.

Time and time again the Stargates are shown to be connecting in any fluid environment, be it gas or liquid.

In reference to whether that fluid would pass: My opinion has always been if there is a significant pressure difference on either side of the event horizon, with the higher pressure needing to be on the front. I believe this ""tricks"" the Stargate (software/firmware/crystalware whatever) programming into accepting an intent on travel.

The Shrine is a great example you bring up. I think the receding was more that the flood was moving away, but I agree that a large amount of water would be entering the wormhole and dissipating as energy on the shield.

As far as new ground, I'd be happy to accept that it became lodged in rock through a long history of land movement and compression. I'm not a geologist but I don't think a molten state is needed to create rock.

From memory, in *A Hundred Days* the SGC dialed back in the brief window where the surrounding rock was still molten and it solidified while the Stargate was active, leaving a space exactly the volume normally occupied by the event horizon."

If it's buried but has an empty space where the thin event horizon would occupy, you will be able to dial the gate, you will be able to pop out the other side, and you will splat against whatever is blocking the surface of the event horizon.

I'm asking when has there been an instance shown where two Stargates, of any kind, are active while being 100ft apart? As in turned on, open wormhole, at the same time?

Also you have misunderstood my second comment. In the final episode of SGA, a super-hive is in earth orbit with a Pegasus 'gate on board. While that 'gate is active, the Earth's Stargate cannot dial or receive a Stargate connection. Just like when the Asurans had an active Stargate satellite above Lantea, the Atlantis Stargate was effectively inoperable.

Stargate,fcqd1jf,t3_eifgnl,1577883589.0,"Season 9 was originally planned to be season 1 of a show called *Stargate Command* with Teal'c and Daniel being the main characters.

In an audio commentary someone mentions that there are extra costs involved in rebranding, and I think they wanted to retain their current audience, so it remained SG-1.

At a similar time I think Farscape was all closed up so Ben Browder joined the cast. Amanda Tapping could only phone it in after having a baby so they signed Claudia Black for the first half of the season to give her time to recover/spend time with her family. It is worth noting that Tapping seemed to have a better contract deal than anyone else; The reason she got on Atlantis (when maybe Daniel was more fitting) is because she was contractually engaged for an additional year. Black proved popular so she came back for S10.

RDA was done, so they needed a new General (Landry). They needed a new doctor to be the face of the fight against... some stuff soon, they got Michael Shanks' wife.

...but at least there's still Walter."

Brad Wright refuses to divulge his plans, if any, for the SGU story. Even other producers didn't know.

Season 6 of SGA was outlined in pre-production. It seemed fairly standard as far as ongoing season structure. I don't think an end was planned in the near future for the SGA story. Having said that, if season 6 did not get the greenlight then the outline for the two-part opener would be reworked as the plot of an SGA movie called ""Extinction"".

In the previously mentioned outline had Atlantis repositioned onto the moon for a new command centre for the Stargate Program. The character would unintentionally activate a security protocol that would self-destruct unless the City was returned to Pegasus. The comics (and I think the novels; I haven't got that far yet) take material from this concept."
