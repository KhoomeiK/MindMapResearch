You may doubt it but that's the reality. Opening up the green belt won't do anything, we already have mechanisms to open it up.

It's not as simple as supply and demand, it's about control of supply. If you have 100 people and 100 loafs of bread but 1 person owns the loaves while 99 starve, introducing 1000 loaves of bread without changing anything else won't mean the 99 eat. The 1 person that got the first 100 loaves will get 1000 the same way they got the first 100. You've not feed the 99 you just end up giving more bread to the 1 who monopolised it in the first place."

Sure they get a huge advance on the locals but then have to wait ages for anything worth assimilating to spring up. 

Unless they face a major external threat what's the point? 

They faced a major external threat in species 8472 and no advanced technology arrived.

I suspect that the Borg developed the temporal communication device for some other reason, perhaps to send cubes near black holes to study whilst keeping drones in contact with the collective, or to study all sorts of other temporal phenomena. Unlike most species the Borg need to maintain contact with every member as much as possible. A 0.00001% chance of running through a temporal incursion totally justifies equipping the collective with a means of staying in contact during it.

Ww know even a Borg sphere can go back in time and assimilate the past, yet we only have evidence of them trying this once to take out one unique threat.

It could even be defensive tech to combat effects of the Krenim or Sphere Builders etc. They know other species use time offensively. They have no need of time travel but don't want to be victims.

I suspect it's a defence mechanism.  Q advised Q(jr) ""never provoke the Borg"", which seems odd, the Q could wipe them from history surely, unless they had developed some sort of temporal defence that might make them more resilient than most beings.

Tl;Dr the Borg have a number of reasons why they might want to equip all or most drones with temporal communication devices, from exploring temporal to defending themselves from time based attacks from other powers."

UKPersonalFinance,fcmrw5b,t1_fcl75ew,1577789212.0,"I'll answer your point about about people not going to uni: because having more educated people in a society is just better.

That none uni person isn't living in isolation, they live a society and reap the benefits.

Some examples of these benefits: 

public services have many jobs that require degrees (even police do now) but the pay (being public sector) is terrible. The less we invest in higher education, the more the individual has to pay and pay back the lower the incentive to join a public service. 

Private services that are complex but pay poorly: most people generally think having vets and pharmacists is a good thing, but many will never pay off plan 2, this discourages people to go into these jobs. This means either prices will rise for consumers or these services will disappear in some areas (likely both).

All people generally benefit from a stronger economy: the UK wants to be a high value high skill economy, or at least have some high skill industries support others. These industries need lots of high skill people ie uni graduates the more of them the better these sectors will do, creating supply chain jobs and generating tax revenue for all.

Start ups: technical start ups find it easier if there's a high supply of high skill fresh graduates willing to take a risk on stuff. People in debt tend to be risk adverse (even if you don't have to pay it off it still has a psychological effect).

Finally let's flip the arguement: we all pay for education till the age of 18. Why? Why should I pay for their education, shouldn't they get a job and pay tuition for their A levels? If the price goes up they should get a loan. No one is really arguing for this but it's the same thing. 

We pay for education because it's not just the person in education getting the benefit. We all do"

I suspect that wakanda has had plenty of conflict but all of it being Wakanda people groups against other Wakandans (in the film I believe it opens with this being why the first black panther went to get the powers and unite them- but not seen it in years).
