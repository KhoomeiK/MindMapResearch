HumansBeingBros,fdwbv2z,t1_fdw90zh,1578757135.0,"All over the place! 90% of my friends are on the Internet, either because they moved far away or because I met them on the internet. I do have a RL friend who I met on the internet and it turns out she lived a few miles away! My husband was in the critical care unit of a hospital and I accidentally mentioned it by name in one of my updates because I was so distraught and exhausted. So she messaged me to let me know to edit and also to offer to come bring me food and take me to her house to shower and nap or something. We’ve been best friends for almost four years now! 
I’m mostly just really really fortunate in that most of the friends I have are amazing. There’s so many good people in this world. I mean, yes, lots of people suck. But I’ve met so many awesome ones."
HumansBeingBros,fdw8ew0,t1_fdw81rz,1578756136.0,Oh absolutely! My FIL has been in the same WOW guild for I think over 15 years and they are still super tight. My husband and I had to drop out when my husband first got sick but they still keep in touch via my FIL.
HumansBeingBros,fdw76eg,t1_fdw6i9e,1578755794.0,Lemme message you!
HumansBeingBros,fdw5nqp,t1_fdw58i0,1578755344.0,"Thank you! It’s really fun. That first time we were doing practice raids and coordinating via Discord voice chat so I got to hear his reaction and it was AMAZING.  TBH it’s actually quite selfish of me, I want that sweet sweet endorphin boost from making people happy."
wholesomememes,fdw55tr,t1_fdw379c,1578755192.0,"Lots more hugs! I’m shitty at relationship advice so I won’t offer anything that might steer you wrong. But I do believe in you and hope you find your person. If you ever need to talk to anyone, my inbox is always open!"
wholesomememes,fdw4uuf,t1_fdw2cpz,1578755081.0,"Lol I’m 32. Feel older though, I worked in a very physical profession and fucked myself up."
HumansBeingBros,fdw4pvz,t1_fdw2iix,1578755028.0,"I lucked into it, my best friend from college was like YOU NEED TO PLAY THIS GAME WITH US and it turned out that a good half of my college friend group was all part of the guild, and the other half was all awesome as well. We have one dude who is kind of racist but he’s actually showing a lot of personal growth now that I’m challenging him on it, and I’m proud of him for making the effort."
wholesomememes,fdw3c2o,t1_fdvwo38,1578754654.0,My husband at first thought it was funny to yell random numbers when I was counting stitches while knitting. Then I pretended to shank him with a steel DPN but misjudged and actually mildly stabbed him in the forearm. He admitted that he deserved it and from then on would pay attention and if he noticed me trying to count he’d pause the movie without even being asked.
wholesomememes,fdw2wcd,t1_fdvx90v,1578754505.0,"Big hugs, sweetie. Took my husband 43 years to find someone and he had fully given up by the time we met. He had decided that he was going to focus on friendships because his wheelchair, as far as he was concerned, ruined any chance of romance. But it worked out in the end! He struck up a conversation with me because of a video game shirt I was wearing, then we ran into each other at the comic book store several times, and it just went from there. It can be super rough, and I’m sorry that you’re discouraged. I’m rooting for you!"
wholesomememes,fdw27mt,t1_fdvy7c4,1578754236.0,"Before my hubby’s heart attack, he’d sit on the couch and I’d sit on the floor between his legs and he’d rub my shoulders when he wasn’t actively playing. But this was when I was in my early twenties and could get up off the floor without needing a crane and a first aid kit. 

He and his dad also hooked me up with WOW because their guild needed a healer, as tradition dictates. TBH, I was planning on playing anyway, but when I expressed interest and said I was gonna save up for a computer, they got all excited and my FIL gave me his old one and they bought me the game and expansions for Christmas. This was...Lich I think. I feel old. Literally stopped using my Northrend map mouse pad last month, it finally wore out."
HumansBeingBros,fdvzkjg,t1_fdvyq7r,1578753528.0,"My online gamer friends and I mostly know each other’s addresses because we send each other care packages and shit all the time. I’ve sent quite a few crocheted Quaggans to my GW2 guildies, for example. My GW2 guildies and I also like to play a game where if someone’s having a bad day we send pizza to their house. It was hilarious the first time I did it, my friend could not figure out where the magic pizza came from and who paid for it, despite just having gotten the scarf I had knitted him so he was aware I had his name and address."

patientgamers,fdemg8n,t3_ekzlv7,1578342121.0,"I’m in my mid thirties, but wasn’t able to get into gaming until late high school because that’s when we finally got electricity. I started with KOTOR and have been hooked on BioWare ever since!"
patientgamers,fdcqnxb,t3_ekn6tt,1578281632.0,That sounds really good! I’d never heard of this game before.
