depression,ffqvsk9,t3_eup4yb,1580144768.0,"Seeing a school counselor at college definitely helped me.. but I'm sure that depends on the counselor that you see.  In my case, he had a wonderful personality and helped me for a few sessions when my feelings were at their worst.  He did end up referring me to a professional therapist, who to be honest I don't think was as good but I'm sure the one at college had quite a large caseload.  The professional therapist, although I did not like him as much, did help me get through at least one of my major issues.  So ultimately the one at the college got me through a bad episode and put me on a course that resulted in an improvement for me.

As far as the approach, yes most of the time the counselor and therapist ""listen"" and that aspect can feel frustrating.  But at least for me it was more effective for me to talk to them, while they are sort of guiding me gently, as opposed to what I was doing before which was just thinking to myself and trying to do a self-reflection all the time.

I wouldn't worry about how the counselor/therapist sees you.  They've dealt with all sorts of personalities and there's probably very little you could say that would surprise them.  Good ones will be professional as they are getting paid to listen and help, not to be a friend."
depression,ffqu6d9,t3_eup9dt,1580143722.0,"Sorry to hear what you are going through..  As you are at a relatively young age at 13 and coming from an Asian family, your post has compelled me want to share some more of my life experiences and I hope you are able to find something in them that will help you get through this.

When I was growing up, felt like my dad never gave me a compliment.  Even when I was doing well in school, he would criticize me for doing things that I found enjoyable or relaxing.. things he considered to be nonsense.  While my mom was better and more gentle, she was more of a buffer and I felt even she provided little positive reinforcement.  And my parents weren't even that bad compared to some other Asian families.

I do believe that your parents love and want what's best for you, in their own way.  But they may have a narrow view of what success looks like and what path you need to take to get there.  So the result is a pressure being put on you to focus everything on school and restrict your interests, with little consideration about your happiness and emotional well-being.  And with your age, they think they know better what's best for you in all areas.

I think it can help if you are able to open up to at least one of your parents about how you are suffering and the pressure you are feeling.  I hope you are open to seeing a school counselor or a therapist if you have not already taken that step.  If you are considering talking to your parents, you may want to try put your thoughts into writing and/or discussing with a school counselor before talking to them.  This is to increase the chances that your parents will take it seriously, which may be a challenge if they view you as a child.  It did work for me to open up to them, and that I was seeing a therapist to help me through my challenges.  However, it was a lot easier for me because I was away at college at the time and I mailed them a letter rather than doing it face to face.  So I really feel for you.. you sound much more mature than I was at your age so I am hopeful."
depression,ffda5gq,t1_ffc6aw4,1579816445.0,"Yeah to be honest if you don't trust your therapist enough to open up about anything significant after 2 years then you're wasting your money.  Not sure if the trust concern is about confidentiality, that the information would somehow be used against you, or if you don't trust their competence.  Sorry I couldn't be of any help."
depression,ff9vl3g,t3_ese637,1579722456.0,"Don't know if it helps, but maybe take the view that your therapist is not a friend, but is a professional that you pay to listen to what you have to say.  The risk of abandonment would be if you were no longer able to pay her or if she ends up moving or changing careers, not because you spilled your guts.  A good therapist wants to help you, but as a professional that you pay for a service.  So she cannot abandon you as a friend or loved one, because she was never that to begin with."
depression,ff9tk5e,t3_eseu4f,1579720958.0,"Sorry can't relate to your perspective, but rather the other side.  I've always struggled with being ""just friends"" with the opposite gender.  For the very few I was able to be friends with, I always had to continually reflect and question my view of that person to ensure that I was being a friend for the right reasons.  In my case, it certainly helped if they were already in a strong relationship or otherwise had strong feelings for someone else.  It's just really hard if  you come across someone with a great personality that wants to spend time with you and who is bringing you joy.  There's just a natural desire for me to want intimacy with that person.  I wish I wasn't like that, but what can you do?"
depression,ff4739b,t3_erjo4s,1579556974.0,"I guess I would use my mobile device to keep myself distracted/entertained and isolate myself.  Even if I'm not in a position where you can put on headphones without being out of place, I can still engross myself with my smartphone.  It sends a bit of a signal that you aren't interested in socializing.  I guess if someone interrupted me because they wanted to talk, and I didn't, then I would be prepared ready to switch to the email app and say sorry I got this urgent email and need to review and respond to it."
depression,ff420tm,t1_fen3x2w,1579553823.0,"Sorry I missed this as it was not a response to my comment so I wasn't alerted.  I hope you find the path forward that is the best for you.  I did have a friend who went on meds after a suicide attempt.  In his case, he was manic depressive but I only saw that he was hyper and always seemed upbeat around me and others.  I was completely blindsighted when he called to tell me that he almost killed himself.  Only thing I could say to him at the time was to beg him not to do it again because I had no idea what to say or how to help him through it.

The meds changed his mood and at first I wasn't sure if it was good as he didn't seem to be happy to me.  But that's because I was used to seeing the manic side and I think the meds were making him more even keeled/calm.  And the most important thing to me is that he is still alive today, over 30 years later.  Anyway, I don't have a good recommendation for you on the meds for that I am sorry.  Don't know if you have already discussed how the meds are affecting you, good and bad, with your doctor/provider."
depression,ff3eatg,t3_erf6np,1579539330.0,"Sorry for what you are going through.. I hope others who have gone through something like that will respond.  Nobody should have to go through being guilted by the actions of both parents, much less one.  If nothing else, you need to understand that you are not to blame for their actions.  They are supposed to be the adults, but it sounds like that they have had serious problems being responsible parents.

Sounds like you love them very much, despite what they have done.  There's nothing wrong with that, but you also need to take care of yourself because it sounds like they aren't able to take care of you.  Sorry I don't have a better answer as far as what to do about your mother.  I would hope that she would not threaten to kill herself as a way of keeping you tethered.. in my opinion that's one of the worst things a parent could do."
depression,ff3cmzr,t3_erf8vu,1579538494.0,"I think you are on the right path, the main question is how to break it to them and make sure that they respect your request.

In the past, I had issues with my parents and with my life, where I needed to break off contact with them.  I was away at college, but they expected me to contact them weekly.  I wrote a letter to them revealing issues that I had with them and some of my other personal issues, and that I could not deal with them at the time and needed space for awhile.  I think it was important to let them know what I was dealing with, why interacting with them was making me feel worse, and finally that I was starting therapy.  In my mind, the letter was the best route because I could make sure I was clear in my communication and they could always re-read it to reinforce their understanding.  I also think it was good to let them know that I was getting help.

For the most part, they respected my wishes and the therapy did help me at least with the issues with my parents.  When I was ready, I resumed contact with them and my relationship with them is in a much better place today.

Good luck to you and I hope things work out."
depression,fen2ev2,t3_eq0p09,1579275460.0,"Not sure I quite get what effect the meds were having on you.. maybe you can clarify a bit if you're willing.  It sounds like you were feeling better, maybe in part because of the meds, and that it made you want to open up to people, but you got burned.  Maybe there is some middle ground where you can continue taking the meds if they're helping you, but without making yourself vulnerable to those people?"
depression,fekpazn,t1_fejexo2,1579204797.0,"I get it for sure.  And with the Internet, video streaming, social media..  you can get a taste of what's out there, but those experiences are relatively shallow and limited.  Not the same as being there in person.  Do you think significant advancements in virtual reality and communications would make a difference to you if they became available to you?"
depression,feh14hv,t3_eokrj7,1579106951.0,"Logically, yes I understand the belief of insignificance given the vastness of the world, the universe and then extended that to across all of time.  From a million foot perspective, looking at the world I could question the existence of any individual.  But my consciousness affords me to live my life with my own unique perspective where I am at the center, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

As far as what you are doing at work, there's nothing wrong with being a follower, as an employee in the workplace or a member of a group/community.  Leaders achieve nothing without followers.  Perhaps your current assignment ends up not making a real difference, but it's more likely than not that some things you have done or will be doing in the future will matter.  There's also the idea of the ripple effect, where even interactions/actions that seem insignificant at the time end up having a much broader impact than what you might think."
depression,fec3t5f,t1_fe9ux75,1578966242.0,"Since the therapist disclosed to the parents, I was assuming that u/Bruins-Fanbase is a minor where the right to confidentiality/privacy may not apply when it comes to disclosing to parents."
depression,fec2dlo,t1_feazn15,1578965653.0,"Unfortunate that you cannot talk about it with and get support from your siblings.  Cannot imagine how I would be today if I suffered that abuse and had the family broken up on top of having to move.  Really hope that you are able to recapture some of that happiness that you once had, in the future."
depression,febus2z,t1_feb0jhl,1578962976.0,"Do you have a primary care physician?  Maybe you can discuss with them and they might find it warranted to put in an order for a test such that it would be covered by insurance.  Don't know if you have family history or similar impairments or if you ever had an past injury/trauma that could have injured your brain.  Probably due to my own ignorance, but it just seems odd to me that they would recommend such an expensive test without some sort of cause/suspicion.

I had a relative who was in an accident that resulted in a brain hemmorrhage and it had an impact on vision (not anything with the eye itself but more due to the brain's processing), cognitive and emotion/mood.  They had neuropsych testing ordered as a result and it was covered by insurance."
depression,feaizaq,t3_eo9orb,1578949451.0,$2k is a lot to spend on something that your psychologist is not willing to deem as medically necessary so that insurance might cover it.  Have you been seeing your psychologist for a while?  Do they believe there's a good chance that you could have something else going on besides depression?
depression,feaaxg0,t1_fe9xgey,1578946437.0,"I've asked myself that..  there are a few things that I do enjoy, but I think the problem is that more often than not I prefer doing nothing over those few things that I can enjoy.   I end up either taking a nap or watching TV/movies/videos. Watching shows and sleeping requires no effort and I guess provides an escape from feeling bad. I would think if I was passionate about something, I would make the effort to go do it right?  Apologies for not being more specific with my situation/issues.  I'm not ready to reveal details, but thanks so much for the interest."
depression,fea7ibu,t3_eo8g81,1578945268.0,"Yeah I think it's hard when you basically cut off contact / awareness of someone in order to protect yourself and give you time to heal, but then you decide to ""check up"" on them after a long period and find that they have already moved on while you have been struggling so hard.  For me, the healing took years not months.  But ultimately I do believe what I went through made more mature and better equipped for being in a serious relationship."
depression,fea1rte,t3_eo84pf,1578943456.0,"I think the National Suicide Hotline has an online chat that would be harder to track than a phone line.  You can first ask them about their policies regarding tracking phone numbers over the online chat before calling them on the phone.

A shame about how the move affected your life.  I think I can relate to that to an extent.  My family moved when I was in the fourth grade and it had a big impact on changing my personality.  Before I was confident, outgoing and a bit brash.  After the move, I became reserved.  I lost my friends and popularity, and ended up feeling like an outcast."
depression,fe9uq7u,t3_eo81gp,1578941635.0,"Thanks for sharing.. it's great that you have multiple ways of countering your depression.  I think it would help me to find a hobby or something like that to be passionate about, but I have really struggled to find that passion."
depression,fe9scwj,t3_eo7usz,1578941028.0,"If your therapist is otherwise helping aside from disclosing to your parents, maybe he can get an agreement from your parents that lets you speak to him in confidence.  Hopefully your therapist is aware that your parents are being judgemental and that you need to be able to talk about your issues without your parents judging and getting angry at you.  If your parents don't want to hear about your struggles, then I would hope they would be willing to sign an agreement with your therapist to keep the sessions completely private."
depression,fe9pzur,t3_eo7wmm,1578940398.0,"I would talk to a counselor, your thesis advisor about your struggles.  I had one class where I struggled to complete a paper because of issues I have always had writing papers, and my depression at the time exacerbated it.  I ended up with an incomplete, but my professor allowed me to try to complete the final paper over the summer and even assigned an assistant to help me through this.  Unfortunately, my mental block was too severe, but not due to lack of effort on the part of the assistant and I did make progress on the paper with his help where I would have given up right away.  I just couldn't get past the finish line.  There's nothing to lose by asking for some help/advice.

For getting through smaller assignments and preparing for exams, I would try to find fellow students that are in the same class and form some sort of study group where you are able to work on the assignments together."
depression,fdrtbt8,t3_emwgqc,1578689474.0,"No great insight to give, but can totally relate to having to be careful about talking and being measured in what I do.  If I just speak my mind,  I end up saying something stupid.  If I do something on impulse, it ends poorly/backfiring.  So just end up keeping my mouth shut and second guessing myself all the time."
depression,fdrn7lk,t3_emvz2s,1578686820.0,"Here's my 2 cents..  it's your first appointment.  Don't feel pressured to spill all your guts at the start.  Just be honest within the scope of what you are comfortable revealing.  Just as they are getting a feel for you, you need to get a feel for them and what the sessions are going to be like.  You can open up more as you start to feel more comfortable.

I think they would only report you if they felt you were an imminent danger to yourself or others, or have admitted to some act that they are legally obligated to report.  You can even ask what their policy is as far as reporting to authorities or taking some action that goes beyond the sessions."
depression,fdqm7m7,t3_ems014,1578669993.0,Thanks for sharing your thoughts.  I think it's great how you are coping with your own challenges and I hope I can at least get to where you are.
depression,fdl7d89,t3_elxmdj,1578518291.0,"From my experiences, a therapist wants you to be comfortable talking.  They will not be lashing out at you.  Especially then, I did not like or feel comfortable starting a conversation.  The frustration I had with one of my therapists is that he would start by asking me what I wanted to talk about.  I guess I was expecting that maybe he would kind of propose a topic/issue to talk about.  Ultimately, you will need to be able to confide in them, but they will not pressure you.  They get paid during the appointment whether you choose to talk about something substantial, beat around the bush, or remain silent.  While you are talking, they may steer you to a certain topic but that will be in a gentle/subtle manner.  At least that's what I experienced."
depression,fdl3vdy,t3_ely5gj,1578516600.0,"Wow, was that your first appointment with them?  I would dump them and look for someone else who can actually help.  I mean sure there may not be a cure for depression, but that doesn't mean there's no recourse for you."
depression,fdl0mhn,t3_elxr3n,1578514952.0,"Don't have a good answer for you, but I think there are different types of friends.  There are those that can be good to hang out with, but they are not there for you when the going gets tough.  There are others that are not always around, but when things are really bad they will be there.  My preference is the latter type of friend rather than the former, but the latter is rarer and of course the holy grail is someone who is both.  However, even if it's the former, it can be a still be a friendship.  I just know that I cannot turn to them for certain things and it will be more of a superficial friendship.

Sorry about the betrayal, especially given the length of the relationships."
depression,fdktbc1,t1_fdjqntq,1578510714.0,"I hope you'll try another therapist.  I can relate to not wanting to be a burden to friends, and in this respect it's a positive that a therapist is not a friend.  You are paying them good money to help you work through some substantial issues, and as with any profession they are not all the same.  You can and should interview/screen them."
depression,fdkoho9,t1_fdka7z4,1578507842.0,"Is there a study group she can join or maybe you can help her form one?  It may help for her to study and work on assignments with people who are in the same boat.  Obviously this does not directly address the underlying issues, but it's a way of getting by and taking advantage of a common interest (getting decent grades)."
depression,fdkdp3u,t3_eluhor,1578501683.0,"Been years since I last saw a therapist, but I never got a suggestion of breathing, exercise and working (granted, I was a student back then).  Can relate to feeling like the therapist is mentally checked out or that they don't really care. Some have a personality/approach is more of a detached, objective mindset.  Or it could just be you had some that were burnt out.  For the therapist I had, although it felt like he was detached and 99% just listening, he did help me with one of my issues anyway and I think he was steering me toward focusing on that issue rather than trying to tackle all of my issues."
depression,fdkbpac,t3_eltl82,1578500489.0,"Not sure about dizziness, but for me I would say that I have felt like my brain was in some sort of fog making it hard for me to go about even some remedial tasks, process when someone is explaining something, much less accomplish things that require sustained focus.  So it could be a symptom of depression or it could be something else that would make your depression worse."
depression,fdk9lx2,t1_fdk20ww,1578499184.0,"It sounds like they don't understand you or that other person at all.  Like you said, they're gossiping about him and that kind of interest is skin deep.  You describe your handling in terms of being good at hiding it at work, but it sounds to me anyway that you are being professional about it."
depression,fdk7pc5,t3_elpxkm,1578497975.0,"Even if you feel that way, I don't think there's anything wrong with it.  Better to open up sometimes than to shut yourself off completely right?  If it helps to have anyone listen to your story and find someone who can at least empathize, then tell it."

I do sometimes feel that I don't care when I die, but I feel like that's because I have so few interests and so I don't know how to get an enjoyment out of life.

depression,fddwahk,t1_fddj318,1578325543.0,"I would agree that melatonin is worth a shot if you'd like to fall asleep earlier.  For me, it had a gentle natural-like effect rather than something that makes you really drowsy.  Initially had a side effect of a headache, but I just cut the pill in half and it was just as effective without giving me a headache.  I did not stick with melatonin mostly because I need that quiet alone time that comes with staying up later."
