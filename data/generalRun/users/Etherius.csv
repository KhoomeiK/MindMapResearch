If the central banks feel the economy is growing too quickly, they'll raise rates.  If they feel the economy is growing too slowly, they'll reduce rates.

In the 80s, for example, the US economy was in a bad period of high inflation and stagnant growth.  They shot interest rates north of 15% which all but halted borrowing.  It was tough medicine but it worked.

Sure, AFTER 20 years.  Assuming you hold that long and have a 30 year mortgage.

20 years is the tipping point when more than 50% of your payment is going into equity.

Let's say you borrow $200,000 @ 4.5%.

Your monthly payment is just over $1000.

In about 19.5 years you'll have paid off half the loan and spent $234,000.

By the end of the loan you'll have paid $364,000 for a $200,000 home.  If you're lucky, by then, the house is worth the amount you paid given current appreciation values.

And that of course doesn't factor in maintenance costs (all of which you are responsible for).

The only benefit is it functions as a savings account.

But if you can rent for an average 30% lower cost (not unreasonable, even in places like NJ) you can save $300/mo in something like the S&P.

>So what you're saying is you'd in theory let everyone in West Virginia die on the streets because you don't have to go there and look at it, and rather have a more selfish based economy? Alright. Not to mention the summed power of the people in a shared economy is higher than the summed power of the people in a selfish economy. There's only a very minor group that is better off in a selfish economy.

I don't want them dying in the streets, but I also don't want my money going toward a part of the country that has been known to push harmful agendas such as coal mining.

It's just a different culture and I don't like them very much.  I say let them fend for themselves.


>In the EU the Netherlands is actually one of the highest net contributors, contributing a lot to many eastern and some southern european countries. But we are better off in the Netherlands BECAUSE we support those countries, causing them to be better off, from which we in turn benefit.

You're sure you're well off because you send money to the east?

Sure it isn't because your country got fat off colonialism?  I mean the rich western EU nations almost all share a common history in that regard.  Either colonialism (Belgium, France, etc) or providing services to those who did.

You sure if I go looking I'm not gonna find a history of exploitation in, say, the Caribbean and Indian Oceans?  Or Africa?

Now I'm not saying your point that you're better off for sending money to Eastern Europe is wrong.  I'm saying to claim that as the origin of your wealth is just stupid."
