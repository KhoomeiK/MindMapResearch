wow,ff913uh,t1_ff90js9,1579702195.0,"I guess for the opening of the dark portal on the steps to hellfire peninsula, and for the sunwell patch to capture the island before the raid unlocked, yeah we teamed up, but consider; tempest keep, gruul's lair, serpentshrine cavern, magtheridon's lair, Karazhan, Zul'Aman, and finally Nagrand and Terokkar pvp targets for zone buffs. Not in any of those did we have any meaningful interaction with someone from the opposing faction. Only the horde involved maeiv to defeat illidan, which keeps it off the list."

I'd get a 200pc set of Faber Castell pencils,  maybe sign up for some studios to practice with other people, a work station lamp and a mounted magnifying glass to get close without leaning in, and if they count, expensive, comfortable headphones because mine suck and cause soreness in my ears after not too long."

Transmogrification,fefsfjg,t3_eogqlw,1579063813.0,I like the decision to show the bracers. Adds just enough green to balance out the head and shoulders. If only there were some boots that had green highlights as well.
