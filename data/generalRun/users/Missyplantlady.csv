cats,fdcuf6u,t3_eko9ok,1578284612.0,"1) scoop the box once a day. Reset it about once a week.

2) cats will adjust to your routine in about 3-6 months.

3) yes, they will find it

4) when I got my cat, playing helped it to be adjusted. The best way to bond is by playing with them and their toys. Let them come to you for pets. They are hunters naturally and it's fun for them 

5) depends on the cat. Rubbing, meowing etc is love

6) I would say give him open access and let him go at his own pace. He will probably hide and be skittish until it gets comfortable. You can help by wiping it's cheeks on a towel and spreading the scent on furniture at his level. Aka spreading his pheromones. You can also buy a pheromone spray.

7) tell him no and kick him off. He will learn.

8) not common

9) to not get injured when were playing and to reduce damage to furniture from scratching 

10) cats don't mind being alone. Just make sure he has access to toys

11) mine love their laser pointer. Get a lot of scratch pads or a cat tower if possible bc they love height. Give them window access. Watch nature documentaries with him. Balls, string, mice. Wands are great 

You'll do great! Enjoy your new bundle of joy!"
