In the last week of the NFL preseason, the team that scored the most points gets 1st pick, and least points gets last pick. Ties are broken by total passing yards. It's also a way to make NFL preseason exciting."

Edit: For build, don't be greedy. Just build full tank. Buy items that counter the enemy team composition. There is no one perfect build for every situation. Knowing what to build will come with time as you acquire game knowledge. (but if you play him mid, you might get away with a hextech protobelt, and then full tank for the rest of the items)"
