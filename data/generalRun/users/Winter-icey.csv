 For instance, sloths are actually three times faster in water than they are on land, says [Becky Cliffe](http://beckycliffe.com/becky-cliffe/), a zoologist and founder of the Costa Rica-based [Sloth Conservation Foundation](http://slothconservation.com/). What’s more, they float.

 Using a stroke that sort of looks like a doggy paddle/breaststroke combination, sloths can swim up to [three times faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMe2UvPS4vI) than they move on land. Their incredibly slow metabolism affords them another advantage here, as they can slow their heart rate down to less than a third of its normal rate, allowing it to hold its breath underwater for over 40 minutes."

 The **Sunda flying lemur** (*Galeopterus variegatus*) or **Sunda colugo**, also known as the **Malayan flying lemur** or **Malayan colugo**, is a species of [colugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colugo). Until recently, it was thought to be one of only two species of flying lemurs, the other being the [Philippine flying lemur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_flying_lemur), which is found only in the [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines). The Sunda flying lemur is found throughout Southeast Asia in [Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia), [Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand), [Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia), and [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore).[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunda_flying_lemur#cite_note-3)

Two closely related species of pudu, the northern and southern, are the smallest deer species on earth. They stand about 12 to 17 inches at the shoulder; at birth fawns are only about six inches high. And a [pudu fawn](https://nypost.com/2015/06/09/meet-the-worlds-smallest-and-most-adorable-deer-species/) is almost impossibly cute: part bunny, part Bambi, part plush toy.

The male pudu’s has short-spiked antlers that don’t branch. The deer live in South American temperate rainforests, and have suffered heavily from habitat loss.

 The animal isn't actually a tiny ocean-dwelling rabbit. The creature eliciting ""awwws"" around the world is a type of sea slug called *Jorunna parva*.

Most are less than an inch (2.5 centimeters) long and can be found throughout the Indo-Pacific Ocean from South Africa to the central Pacific. Though the most popular images of these animals show white animals with black spots, these sea slugs are usually yellow or orange.

 *Jorunna parva*'s fur-like coat is due to bunches of tiny rods, called caryophyllidia, that cover the animal's back. They're arranged around little knobs that are sometimes black, giving the sea bunny its speckled appearance.

 The rusty-spotted cat is the smallest wild cat in [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia) and rivals the [black-footed cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-footed_cat) as the world's smallest wild cat. It is 35 to 48 cm (14 to 19 in) in length, with a 15 to 30 cm (5.9 to 11.8 in) tail, and weighs only 0.9 to 1.6 kg (2.0 to 3.5 lb).

 Rusty-spotted Cats *Prionailurus rubiginosus* compete with Black-footed Cats *Felis nigripes* and the Kodkod *Leopardus* *guigna* as the world’s smallest wild cat species. They have been described by some as a smaller, ‘washed out’ version of the Leopard Cat *Prionailurus bengalensis.*"

The red panda is dwarfed by the black-and-white giant that shares its name. These pandas typically grow to the size of a house cat, though their big, bushy tails add an additional 18 inches. The pandas use their ringed tails as wraparound blankets in the chilly mountain heights."

At first, baby elephants don't really know what to do with their [trunks](https://www.thoughtco.com/about-elephants-trunks-129966). They swing them to and fro and sometimes even step on them. They will suck their trunk just as a human baby might suck its thumb.

By about 6 to 8 months, calves begin learning to use their trunks to eat and drink. By the time they are a year old, they can control their trunks pretty well and, like adult elephants, use their trunks for grasping, eating, drinking, bathing.

[https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/blogs/how-baby-elephants-drink-water](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/blogs/how-baby-elephants-drink-water)

Although it only takes newborn elephants a few hours to master standing and walking — vital skills for nursing — they need much more time to figure out how to use their trunks. The long appendages on their faces are valuable multipurpose tools, but without an instruction manual, it can be almost a year before baby elephants really understand how to use them.

 According to a paper, published in [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02088-w#Sec15), the feathers of the superb bird of paradise can absorb 99.95 percent of light when they face the light directly. This falls to 96.86 percent in indirect light, which is a similar absorption rate to [asphalt](http://web.archive.org/web/20070829153207/http://eetd.lbl.gov/HeatIsland/Pavements/Albedo/). To compare, blackbird feathers absorb between 95 and 97 percent of light.

How is this possible? Harvard University scientists have discovered that it comes down to the structure of the feathers, not the pigmentation.

The shiny black plumage seen in many birds of paradise is down to tiny unique structures not seen in any other bird, new research shows.

These microscopic black filaments cause the feathers to absorb up to 99.95 per cent of direct light to give a 'super black' look which makes them more attractive to the opposite sex."
