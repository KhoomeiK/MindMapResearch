What bothers me though, is that most of the culture encourages the use of porn and much of modern Feminism has convinced women that being promiscuous is empowering. 

Encourage women and to be promiscuous and encourage young men to look at hardcore porn and what do you have? Broken people with broken relationships. Multiply that by the millions and you end up with a broken society. Porn is rotting our society from the inside out. Suddenly being chaste doesn‚Äôt sound so bad."

I can say with confidence that none of the black population in Dallas probably even knew that statue existed, let alone felt offended by its presence. Most people didn‚Äôt know that statue even existed. In fact, the only people that were pushing for it to be removed were white people.  But it got broadcasted to all of Dallas that it was being taken down in the context of a cultural conversation around ‚ÄúRacism‚Äù or perceived Racism. 

To put it another way, I always ask the Social Justice types where these white-supremacist/alt-right people during not one, but *two* Obama administrations? How could these powerful, dangerous, influential, rich white men, that have somehow harbored Racist sentiments their entire lives, allow a black man be the face of their precious nation two times in a row? After all, these men are the ‚Äúgreatest threat to our democracy‚Äù (their words, not mine).

I guess I just wonder what will be removed from our cultural history next? After the statues, what else will be edited
out of the timeline of history? In 1984, there was an entire bureaucratic institution called ‚ÄúThe Ministry of Truth‚Äù that was designed to literally edited the definition of words and filter out books and knowledge on behalf of the general public to micro manage their perceptions of reality.

I just think Sargon, along with other IDW type thinkers, finds Identity Politics dangerous and sees Fascist tendencies in the Left. For example, I don't find homosexuality \*as such\* to be necessarily immoral, but the agents of its movement, or at least the Far Left agents that abide in the LGBTQ community, I find reprehensible. The type that push an ""oppressor vs oppressed"" narrative I think are the types of people Sargon has trouble with. I think he sees (and has experienced) a lot of internet censorship of people who happen to disagree with a lot of pop culture leftist narratives on things. He's a strong Free Speech advocate. Ironically, this will inevitably be labeled ""fascist"" by someone and their solution is for him to not have a platform to voice his views because of it.  

There are people that abide in what has been labeled ""alt-right"" that are atheist AND homosexual. Dave Rubin, for instance, repeatedly gets labeled an Alt-Right shill which is mindblowing considering his lifestyle and sexual orientation. When a  gay, atheist, Jew is somehow just  a pawn for Far Right Conservatism and not somehow who has his own, nuanced position on things, then I get disagreeable."

dankchristianmemes,fdklxjp,t1_fdkhyqv,1578506283.0,"I‚Äôve wondered that too. I suppose it does unless you view Adam is being a representation of all of mankind.

It‚Äôs not hard to imagine evolution working up to a point where Adam became the first actual homosapien and then the story of Creation sort of following from there. However the reason our Christian ancestors didn‚Äôt describe it as such was because they didn‚Äôt have the scientific language available to explain their understanding of reality, so it became encoded in mythological representations. 

I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre a fan of Jordan Peterson but his lecture on the Psychology of Redemption in Christianity (specifically when he references the Anthropologist, Lynn Is bell‚Äôs work on the relationship between snakes and the evolution of vision in our primate ancestors) and his unity of Phenomenology with Religion has helped me bridge a lot of the gaps of Christianity and Science. At least the gaps as I perceive them. Some see no problem with seeing a literal 6 day Creation. 

I also go off of theologians, even reformed ones who air closer to Christian fundamentalism than they do liberalism in their interpretations, generally hold to the view that Genesis was written in poetic song-like literary style, meaning it ought to be read accordingly. You wouldn‚Äôt Numbers or Leviticus if you‚Äôre looking for daily wisdom, you read the Proverbs for that. You wouldn‚Äôt read Ecclesiastes as something to draw doctrine out of, you read Romans for that.

The Bible is meant to be read ‚Äúliterarily‚Äù instead of ‚Äúliterally‚Äù. The library of books in the Bible are just that, a library of books containing different genres and literary themes/styles."

dankchristianmemes,fdjvv7s,t1_fdjh27t,1578489200.0,"Yeah as far as my meager understanding goes, I believe you are right, this was generally accepted among the Early Church Fathers and Followers. Ancient Christians understood metaphor back then, many people weren't formally educated and communicated big ideas through storytelling. Moses wrote Genesis as  a response to other, pagan, Gentile creation narratives that started with different first-principles. 

For example, in Babylonian mythology, humanity was birthed as a side-product of a war between two gods, which would've shaped it's believers perspective of themselves and their world around them. They were essentially born out of random, pitiless chaos (not much unlike the prevailing secular creation narrative).

But the Christian god creates with intention and design. And Evolution could just be a very powerful description of *how* exactly God created us. But it can't really answer the *why*.

I was taught in my church culture you couldn't be legitimate Christian and not read Genesis literally."

It‚Äôs politically incorrect to criticize factions like Islam because they‚Äôre widely regarded as an ‚Äúoppressed class‚Äù by Left Wing orgs. Which is absurd at every possible level. 

What‚Äôs more is yes, the SPLC is right to classify the KKK as a hate group. But that‚Äôs hardly a real legal contribution to our society. Like who on this sub is going argue with that?. That was something they rightly did back in the 60s.

They have labeled the ACP as being ‚Äúanti-LGBTQ‚Äù because of their stances regarding trans-child abuse. What am I supposed to think about the SPLC‚Äôs guiding principles?

If the ACP happened to be Buddhist, or Islamic, or whatever, I would still agree with their premises of what constitutes trans-child abuse because it's just self-evident.

You're picking out pedantic little infractions that don't perfectly fit with your subjective defintion of ""evidence"" and then are aghast when I call you mentally handicapped. Typically, when people deny what is self-evidently true, they are labeled mentally handicapped.

And then you equated my accusations of the SPLC with defending the KKK. Like, how can one reason with someone who can't understand the nuance as to why that's absurd?Those two things are not even remotely equivalent. For people that fancy themselves nuanced and sophisticated thinkers, you progressive types just utterly miss nuance when it's smacking you in the face."
