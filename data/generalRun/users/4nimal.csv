childfree,fey9kal,t3_eqs8lm,1579442557.0,"This sounds exactly like my old neighbor and her brats who used to live above me. Warn your landlord, bitch took the fridge when her lease ended."
AskReddit,fekwag7,t1_fek1x3r,1579208922.0,"WHAT. Damn, I didn't know you could do that. I have my ovaries and uterus, but not my fallopian tubes.

I'm assuming by keeping your ovaries, you avoided early menopause but still get to live without periods?"
bonnaroo,fed6r40,t1_fec9sis,1579001554.0,"Sure was. It was nothing but me, my vodka and my personal blunt. I had to pretend I was about to vomit on everyone just to get out of that crowd when it got dangerous. Girls were desperately trying to crowd surf out but it got so packed when everyone rushed the stage."
Cooking,feb229m,t3_eo386o,1578954733.0,"More of a lack of direction. I was working late at home one night, but had started a chicken stock the night before. I was talking my boyfriend through turning it into chicken and rice soup, from the other room. I had him start with a mirepoix, then adding the stock and chicken. I asked him to “add some rice.” He added half the bag. We ended up with about 20 cups of chicken rice."
bonnaroo,feb0o2t,t3_eo8gf5,1578954255.0,Also don’t bring a camelbak filled with vodka and crystal lite instead of water especially if you’re planning on being at the front of a daytime Danny Brown set. Best/worst day ever.
childfree,fe941uq,t1_fe8pum6,1578933980.0,"It’s super weird, but essentially it’s just a nerve reaction. In a laparoscopy they go in through your belly button and kind of inflate your abdomen. It takes a few days or so for the gas to dissolve(?). My doctor basically just said this irritates a major nerve. It feels like you threw out your shoulder for a few days, or worked it out insanely hard.

It was just really surprising that after being cut into three times, my uninjured shoulder was what made me cry lol."
childfree,fe7okks,t1_fe6ud9u,1578917418.0,"I had the same procedure in September. I had the surgery on a Wednesday and took 8 full work days off. It was pretty easy, much easier than having my tonsils removed as an adult. The shoulder pain from the laparoscopy hurt more than my incisions/abdomen."
childfree,fe7o3ae,t3_enzm8x,1578917303.0,"Sounds a lot like me and my dad! Part of me wonders if I would want kids, if I’d seen him actually pull his weight in raising us."
videos,fe68woz,t3_enueyb,1578884366.0,"Immediately recognized the Esquire and Ludlow ave. This was hilarious, and even cooler that it was produced locally to me."
WTF,fdwja1y,t3_en8f3k,1578759253.0,There’s a man in my neighborhood with an aging parrot. He takes it for walks on his shoulder. This is better.
dogs,fdwhoyf,t3_en21kr,1578758804.0,"Like other people have said, this looks like allergic dermatitis. Could have been from fleas, food, contact, whatever. In addition to the Benadryl, try to keep puppy from scratching (with an oatmeal type bath, moisturizers, the cone of shame, etc.) and gently keep the area clean."
dogs,fdw0ugc,t1_fdvz0m6,1578753859.0,Please be kind to yourself. It really sounds like you tried everything.
AskReddit,fdvyr6l,t1_fdua70a,1578753208.0,I loved it but felt the same way. It was less disturbing the second time around as I was hyper-focused on picking up clues.
cincinnati,fdr2lgl,t1_fdqyfoz,1578678680.0,I’m a white-as-hell American of Mexican heritage and even I know Mazunte isn’t traditional. It’s great mexi-cali food though.
TwoXChromosomes,fdjzio1,t3_elmfsz,1578492232.0,"Man, this just gave me flashbacks to the time I broke my ankle at recess in 6th grade. The school nurse gave me a frozen baby wipe (not even a bag of ice, the thing melted in seconds) and sent me back to class. By the time I got off the school bus my ankle was swollen like a balloon and black. No call to my parents or anything. The shittier thing is that my brother had broken his arm at the same school the year before. Same thing, no call, no ice, just back to class. If I’d been the adult in that situation I would have demanded that nurse be fired."
dogs,fcs1qwp,t1_fcraywr,1577910101.0,The anticipatory grief is REAL.
