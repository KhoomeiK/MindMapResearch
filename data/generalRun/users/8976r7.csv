AdamCarolla,fenxmgi,t1_fenc5pd,1579292331.0,"> Weird, you go on a rant about someone 'shaming' other people by actually shaming that person

That person had already made a comment in this thread talking about Lynette, after having shut up someone else for the same thing. 

>If you claim to be such a fan of Lynette's

LOL when the hell did I ever say or even imply that?

>you should have let people go over there, PAY, and see what she has to say, instead of ripping off Lynette.

No one was going to go over there to hear her bitch about motherhood. But now that people know she talks about Adam and what she says, maybe some here will be interested. But if they're not, what the fuck do I care?"

AdamCarolla,fel3s3o,t1_fel1gdn,1579213437.0,you did nothing wrong. that information is more likely to make an ACS listener sign up for FCOL's patreon when none of us would have an interest normally.
AdamCarolla,fekq2p8,t1_fekpz60,1579205258.0,why did you even say it? you called them a traitor. So ridiculous.
AdamCarolla,fekozay,t1_feizftp,1579204605.0,"no offense to Lynette, but Springsteen has hot 20 year olds lining up for him, I doubt he'd go for Lynette even if she threw herself at him."
AdamCarolla,feknoib,t3_ep94le,1579203835.0,"Someone who's a FCOL patron came in here and gave us a tiny bit of info about what Lynette was complaining about, and another FCOL listener replied and shamed her for it until she deleted the comment. Really fucking annoying, maybe if people are interested in Lynette's personal life they might become new FCOL listeners.

edit: here's their deleted comment ([from here](http://removeddit.com/r/AdamCarolla/comments/embk50/big_star_in_the_studio_yesterday/)) from when I asked if Lynette has said anything interesting about adam over the past few months:

>Yeah he needs to be a better husband and she’ll stand by him while he gets the help he needs to quit being resentful of his childhood.

&#x200B;

>Oh and she is insisting he resolves issues from his childhood that are affecting his ability to be a good parent or else she is sort of checked out of the relationship. I’ve heard her talk this way before though and change her tune, but she does want him to step up and she is somewhat at her wits end. He also refused to let her get movers when moving into the new house which ticked her off- because she was dealing w school and kids and Christmas and moving- and he wanted his “guys” to do it but she went behind his back and got movers anyway which is uncharacteristic of her. People always give her crap for not doing anything but sometimes I see her point to be honest. Being with Adam causes low grade depression from loneliness. Also she is very giving in a sense when it comes to intimacy and he isn’t as appreciative of her as he should be. He’s critical. But he loves her and means well but he is damaged and needs to work on himself.

&#x200B;

>He went to Monterey on her birthday and basically nobody recognized it. He realized it in an offhand way right before he left and then all he did was say happy birthday late at night when he returned. Sonny sent her a happy bday video from Matt deandria?s phone at 3:00. Natalia didn’t even realize it was her bday. They were going to therapist who was a fan of Adams and that didn’t work out so they switched to a life coach. He’s had to be held accountable for spending time with the kids on the kids’ terms

That person had already made a comment in this thread talking about Lynette, after having shut up someone else for the same thing. 

>If you claim to be such a fan of Lynette's

LOL when the hell did I ever say or even imply that?

>you should have let people go over there, PAY, and see what she has to say, instead of ripping off Lynette.

No one was going to go over there to hear her bitch about motherhood. But now that people know she talks about Adam and what she says, maybe some here will be interested. But if they're not, what the fuck do I care?"

AdamCarolla,feknoib,t3_ep94le,1579203835.0,"Someone who's a FCOL patron came in here and gave us a tiny bit of info about what Lynette was complaining about, and another FCOL listener replied and shamed her for it until she deleted the comment. Really fucking annoying, maybe if people are interested in Lynette's personal life they might become new FCOL listeners.

edit: here's their deleted comment ([from here](http://removeddit.com/r/AdamCarolla/comments/embk50/big_star_in_the_studio_yesterday/)) from when I asked if Lynette has said anything interesting about adam over the past few months:

>Yeah he needs to be a better husband and sheâ€™ll stand by him while he gets the help he needs to quit being resentful of his childhood.

&#x200B;

>Oh and she is insisting he resolves issues from his childhood that are affecting his ability to be a good parent or else she is sort of checked out of the relationship. Iâ€™ve heard her talk this way before though and change her tune, but she does want him to step up and she is somewhat at her wits end. He also refused to let her get movers when moving into the new house which ticked her off- because she was dealing w school and kids and Christmas and moving- and he wanted his â€œguysâ€ to do it but she went behind his back and got movers anyway which is uncharacteristic of her. People always give her crap for not doing anything but sometimes I see her point to be honest. Being with Adam causes low grade depression from loneliness. Also she is very giving in a sense when it comes to intimacy and he isnâ€™t as appreciative of her as he should be. Heâ€™s critical. But he loves her and means well but he is damaged and needs to work on himself.

&#x200B;

>He went to Monterey on her birthday and basically nobody recognized it. He realized it in an offhand way right before he left and then all he did was say happy birthday late at night when he returned. Sonny sent her a happy bday video from Matt deandria?s phone at 3:00. Natalia didnâ€™t even realize it was her bday. They were going to therapist who was a fan of Adams and that didnâ€™t work out so they switched to a life coach. Heâ€™s had to be held accountable for spending time with the kids on the kidsâ€™ terms
