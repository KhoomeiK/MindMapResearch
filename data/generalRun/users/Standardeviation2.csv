science,fgrawxt,t3_ezzreg,1581042382.0,"While I suspect that on average men probably do punch harder than women, there are a couple of factors i would be curious about. I coach boxing, and proper punching technique increases power exponentially. Now, if you take 100 people (50 guys and 50 ladies) who are untrained in any combat sport, I’d be willing to predict that the males by a significantly higher percentage grew up rough housing, had an older sibling, dad, or uncle that taught them how to punch, and probably had a higher number of school yard fights. That doesn’t mean they’re punching form is great, but it probably comes closer than the females who statistically speaking engaged in less of these behaviors.

Perhaps another way to test it would be to take 50 female boxers and 50 male boxers in the same weight class and test their punching power."

I’m within walking distance of fun night life. I’m within Uber distance of even more fun nightlife like cool bars, comedy clubs, luxury movie theaters, concert and sporting venues, casinos, etc. I’m within driving distance from the snow, the beach, amazing wineries, SF.

atheism,ffjbonx,t3_etibuk,1579994927.0,"What you’re describing proposes a literal interpretation, which indeed is the interpretation of many modern Christians. However, I find myself less interested in modern interpretation of ancient texts, and more interested in what ancient texts meant to ancient people. 

In that context, Adam and Eve is a cool story. Some Ancient thinker/author was trying to understand “What makes us human?” His conclusion seemed to be in part that it is our greater wisdom and self awareness when compared to other animals. So he told a story about how humans weren’t much different than other animals. In fact, animals were literally created to be his mates (although he wasn’t satisfied). But then, after he chooses woman as his mate, they end up eating from the tree of knowledge and become self-aware as evidenced by their immediate desire to cover themselves up, unlike non-aware animals.

It’s a neat little story to describe (among other things) humankind’s strange ability to be seemingly, uniquely self-aware. We don’t know if ancient people took it as literal truth, but they may not have. They likely understood it’s a story to help highlight a point about human existence."
