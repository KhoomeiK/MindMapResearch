AskReddit,fc2kozu,t3_efqzp6,1577365042.0,"Almost every xmas since two of my older siblings started messing up their lives with drugs/alcohol over 25 years ago. I feel guilty if we take family pictures and they are not there.  I appreciate what I have with my younger sibling, parents and my spouse but I become sad and shed tears every year thinking about them. One has been homeless for maybe 15 years. The other can't hold onto a job and loses his mind sometimes. Both have children that are also struggling. So every year I think of what Christmas could be if my siblings were healthy and gave their childrens the lives that they deserve. Our family did what we could for my siblings and nieces/nephews but it wasnt enough. When people ask the question what would you do if you won the lottery, i always say get my siblings treatment/rehab/therapy before anything else and help my nieces/nephews get clean (only one) and educated and therapy.  Since that will never happen, I think every Christmas will always be a little sad for me. Sometimes more sometimes less. And it's not only Christmas either, Thanksgiving, their birthdays, my birthday, vacations we take, the house we bought. My thoughts don't ruin these things completely. I just feel those feelings and forget about them somehow until the next thing brings up thoughts on my siblings like this Reddit question."
