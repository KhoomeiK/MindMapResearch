From a purely monetary perspective it's actually better to serve a niche kink community than it is to follow the trendy stuff for those reasons you laid out. As far as porn stuff is concerns it's actually a much better idea to put up a patreon and build a following in a particular community than to write in over-saturated genres.

I mean, one of my artist friends I knew prior to pursuing the hobby, and one of the people who helped me the most when I discovered my interest in it (by providing feedback and resources) is currently studying to make a career in my own field (IT security) because she's tired of being a starving artist.

dataisbeautiful,fehqgv6,t1_fehm1ov,1579121837.0,"Parts of Ontario get the same thing with lake effect, but the thing is system snow tends to be more intense hour-by-hour than most squall systems. If a monstrous storm system comes into a region and lasts for 24 hours or more, a squall just isn't going to be able to outdo that snowfall rate in most situations, meaning being by the lake probably isn't going to impact your record storms as much as other geography (like mountains) would.

If you looked at snowfall averages the lake effect is MUCH more noticeable as it tends to create consistent medium severity snowfalls as opposed to giant ones. Think of the difference between a rain forest and Florida. The rain forest very well might get higher averages, but Florida is going to get hit by hurricanes.

i.e. a similar map for snowfall averages:

AskReddit,fehai9d,t1_fegw2wt,1579112549.0,"As I said, I'm not going to bash on people for not being able to tolerate the vitriol. It's not like I'm flawless either, that's just how I try and frame online discussions in my mind. 

My perspective is that people I disagree with aren't going to stop making bad takes, so even though it's tiresome continuing to reply to the same topics, it's valuable since that comment chain might be the first time some random layperson is exposed to the topics I bring up. I was once vulnerable to that kind of toxic, reactionary rhetoric when I was an edgy teen.

In all honesty though, both a diplomatic and direct approach are important and useful in different scenarios. Sometimes people just need to be called out on their shit if they're doing active harm. In, say, an online gaming voice chat if somebody was making edgy racist jokes I'd probably just spout edgy jokes at their expense in response because literally anything else will just give them the reaction they're looking for. Believe it or not, I actually know somebody who stopped doing that shit because I managed to make him look like an idiot in one of those situations. He messaged me after whatever game we were playing and I spoke to him. The guy was just a 16 year old that didn't know any better. Sure, that's like 1/100000, but it does happen.

Anyway, never let this kind of stuff negatively impact your life. As much as changing peoples' minds is valuable and important, so is your own mental health. -shrugs- If you feel you're at your wits end, just lay off it for a bit, take a different approach. Nothing wrong with that."

AskReddit,feh17t2,t1_fegr9wt,1579107007.0,"Well the thing is you can only move people so far in one interaction. I don't expect to take somebody from being genuinely hateful towards a group of people to being open and accepting of them in one exchange, especially if it's strangers on the internet.   


Even my father, who I have a much more personal connection with and can talk to face to face, wasn't convinced to shift his political opinions the first time we talked, and that was on something much more surface level (economics). In many cases he would (and still does) say things that force me to walk away from the conversation. Yet over time when exposed to good arguments, he has changed some of his positions. People don't change their minds in the midst of debating a topic and will almost never admit it to the person they were debating with.   


Right off the bat, Formal Sam is approaching a much more hostile user than I was earlier. Honestly I think he approached it the best way he could (though I think if you're going to bring up medical or scientific consensus on anything you NEED to bring sources and links to stop them from handwaving it away with anecdotal ""experience"" - see ANY immigration debate ever) but like you said, there's certain situations where if you go into them you're going to get downvote brigaded and navigating those discussions efficaciously takes a lot of patience and composure.   


On the downvoting, personally I don't care if I'm downvoted. But I do care if the ""mob"", the average layperson, finds my arguments to be unconvincing. I also really care if I'm feeding into stereotypes because that makes it harder for others making good arguments to break past that. That's why I care as much as I do about meeting people where they're at. I've spoken to blatant transphobes as equals not because I tolerate their views but because I think they can do better. Sometimes telling them that I too am a cis person helps in that. Though in general I actually hate bringing my personal orientation into it because it really doesn't matter at all.  


Especially with stuff like trans issues, it's really important to structure arguments in a manner that will reach the layperson, because the people who are going to most adamantly argue against you are not going to change their minds in that exchange (though they might later). Rhetoric and optics matter a lot here. Staying calm is really, really important, not because the person you're talking to necessarily deserves civility (I'm not impugning people for getting angry about issues that are personal to them), but rather, they're important because the people that will see an online exchange are often much broader than just the person you're directly talking to... and on trans issues, there are negative stereotypes of advocates being confrontational. Even if somebody is justified in confronting somebody in an aggressive way, feeding into that stereotype can be bad and we should be conscious of that.   


Maybe it's easier for me to stay calm because trans issues don't really directly affect me the way they would a trans person. Maybe it's my personality (I'm borderline aspergers / spectrum). I don't know. But from my perspective I don't care about the exchange itself - I care about changing peoples' minds and how to most effectively go about that.   


I think he did well in this regard at times and poorly at others. Even though everything he said regarding attraction I 100% agree with, at times he played into the ""you guys are projecting your thoughts onto me"" narrative and he could have done away with that by linking one of the (many) studies that back up what he said and asked what exactly made his conversation partner different from the findings, as opposed to the sarcastic replies he indulged in at times. But I still think that he did a good job of summarizing why he held his positions towards the end, and if a layperson were to read that thread in its entirety they would likely come away with a more positive view of him out of the two."

AskReddit,fegp36s,t1_feg6x5y,1579099171.0,">Also LOVE how they'll downvote my point about being post-op, but they won't engage with it.

One of the dumbest parts of like/upvote/downvote systems is that people will react more to the tone of what you say as opposed to the content of what you say. If you look at both your comment and my own in this comment chain, we're essentially saying the same thing although you're more directly calling out the genital thing. I was more diplomatic because I find if I can disarm somebody (the reason I even brought up my own identity, in response to the guy I was replying to) I can make them question their preconceived ideas more readily, and hopefully get across a point.  


I think a lot of the sentiment that ""I would just know"" comes from insecurity and ignorance (not using this as a pejorative, just literally them not knowing much about trans people/issues), more than anything else. I'm not a mind reader, so I don't know if the dude I replied to fits that. But even so, it's always been weird to me how insecure with their sexuality most cis dudes seem to be. Most people who bring up their own preferences in these threads assume they know more than they do, and while it's not everybody that does, I think a significant portion of them are reflexively defending their ""straightness"".  


Finding out somebody is trans IS the turn off for most people. Yeah, that's a really shitty reason (and why people try to justify it with additional reasons), but that's what it is.   


Not being able to have kids is a good reason you wouldn't want to get into a long term relationship with somebody, but let's be fucking real here dudes, if you dated a girl and found out before you had sex that she was infertile I think that vast majority of us of would be cool with sleeping with her, even if it was a deal breaker for a long term relationship and I suspect that number would be a lot higher if they said they were trans, even if you physically couldn't tell *at all*. What's more, I think the chances of a girl getting assaulted for being infertile in that scenario are quite a bit lower.  


There's a difference between being attracted to somebody and being interested in a long term relationship with them. It's attraction that people reject, and that's curious to me."

It's true that it's unlikely you'll find yourself in that situation, but that's more to do with the fact that 99% of trans people who can pass recognize it's better for them to be up front about it from a practical and safety standpoint.

Detroit and Windsor are sister cities. Windsor is one of the safest cities on the continent. Detroit is one of the most dangerous.

The issue is that money needs to be funneled into the right places and those programs need to be properly administered, and if those conditions are met, yes it absolutely does lower crime rates. It's also important to note that no amount of spending will solve for the loss of economic opportunities in a city, which is undoubtedly why these cities (including Windsor) are struggling.

Male nurses and teachers in my experience have been in that role because they explicitly want to, whereas many people choose careers because they don't hate them or just picked a program by default. I.e. a lot of dudes go into IT because it's a safe bet and a natural bridge between gaming (a male dominated hobby for a bunch of dumb reasons) and college.

Which brings me to an example of the contrary - girls in IT. I work in cyber security and the male-female ratio is pretty insane. But most girls in the industry I know have much more motivation to learn and understand the tech than the average guy in the field.

My female coworker who knows at least if not more than I do, when speaking with vendors, is assumed to know less than me. I've been on those conference calls. It's absurd. We're both in the same role.

Having to deal with cultures that are implicitly hostile to your identity (even if not actively hostile) and still wanting to pursue that career takes a level of dedication.

I think male teaches like the one you had are still certainly possible today, for all those reasons. The real tragedy is the people who do love those fields but ultimately decide to go with a career that's easier (edit: in the social sense, not necessarily an easier job). 

Another friend of mine who I knew would love hacking/pen testing almost pursued nursing for this exact reason.

I introduced her to some basic resources on InfoSec and encouraged her to check them out. She's since dived headfirst into it and is self teaching. She's more motivated to get an ethical hacking position than anybody I've ever seen."
philosophy,fcctq7g,t1_fcbcnoi,1577602524.0,"To your point, we can still say somebody looks creepy and we're uncomfortable around them even if they are not engaging in off putting body language, as evidenced by the fact that the study is based on still images.

Indeed, somebody can appear creepy because they're in a poorly lit area. In certain contexts, this makes sense. Dark alleys etc. But if I'm, say, a janitor cleaning a hallway which has some burnt out lights people will perceive me as more creepy than if the lights were working. This is rather silly, but hard to avoid feeling.

Our senses can be valid but they can also be inaccurate. This study points out that somebody's appearance alone is not a good metric to judge their behavioural tendencies and these misperceptions are damaging in many cases. I don't think it's out of bounds to ask people in general to be more aware of when they are judging people disproportionately based solely on their appearance. That doesn't mean disregarding one's instincts to the point of putting ourselves in danger. I do think the phrasing of the point made could be better, though."

We don't remember details of images without conscious effort to study those details. Eventually this becomes more automatic but it requires training yourself to see things as they are. The lack of mechanical skills can compound the issues but having drawn many objects from vivid memories, only to check a reference and recognize glaring mistakes, it's more than a mechanical issue. I'm certainly at the point where I'm capable of reasonably recreating a decent sketch of something but drawing from memory is still beyond me unless I consciously study the subject for later. Our brains simply don't prioritize high fidelity memories of images over functional ones that take less brain power.

Lyrics, on the other hand, are fundamentally just strings of repeated words. They're easy to remember because we already frequently practice language construction automatically by using it day to day.

If you feel you remember music more vividly, find some music in a language you don't understand which you like. Try to remember the lyrics. You won't be able to. Maybe a few words. You'll likely remember the notes better than the lyrics as you're more familiar with musical notes.

If a monstrous storm system comes into a region and lasts for 24 hours or more, a squall just isn't going to be able to outdo that snowfall rate in most situations, meaning being by the lake probably isn't going to impact your record storms as much as other geography (like mountains) would.

If you looked at snowfall averages the lake effect is MUCH more noticeable as it tends to create consistent medium severity snowfalls as opposed to giant ones. Think of the difference between a rain forest and Florida. The rain forest very well might get higher averages, but Florida is going to get hit by hurricanes.

i.e. a similar map for snowfall averages:

My perspective is that people I disagree with aren't going to stop making bad takes, so even though it's tiresome continuing to reply to the same topics, it's valuable since that comment chain might be the first time some random layperson is exposed to the topics I bring up. I was once vulnerable to that kind of toxic, reactionary rhetoric when I was an edgy teen.

In all honesty though, both a diplomatic and direct approach are important and useful in different scenarios. Sometimes people just need to be called out on their shit if they're doing active harm. In, say, an online gaming voice chat if somebody was making edgy racist jokes I'd probably just spout edgy jokes at their expense in response because literally anything else will just give them the reaction they're looking for. Believe it or not, I actually know somebody who stopped doing that shit because I managed to make him look like an idiot in one of those situations. He messaged me after whatever game we were playing and I spoke to him. The guy was just a 16 year old that didn't know any better. Sure, that's like 1/100000, but it does happen.

I don't expect to take somebody from being genuinely hateful towards a group of people to being open and accepting of them in one exchange, especially if it's strangers on the internet.   


Even my father, who I have a much more personal connection with and can talk to face to face, wasn't convinced to shift his political opinions the first time we talked, and that was on something much more surface level (economics). In many cases he would (and still does) say things that force me to walk away from the conversation. Yet over time when exposed to good arguments, he has changed some of his positions. People don't change their minds in the midst of debating a topic and will almost never admit it to the person they were debating with.   


Right off the bat, Formal Sam is approaching a much more hostile user than I was earlier. Honestly I think he approached it the best way he could (though I think if you're going to bring up medical or scientific consensus on anything you NEED to bring sources and links to stop them from handwaving it away with anecdotal ""experience"" - see ANY immigration debate ever) but like you said, there's certain situations where if you go into them you're going to get downvote brigaded and navigating those discussions efficaciously takes a lot of patience and composure.   


On the downvoting, personally I don't care if I'm downvoted. But I do care if the ""mob"", the average layperson, finds my arguments to be unconvincing. I also really care if I'm feeding into stereotypes because that makes it harder for others making good arguments to break past that. That's why I care as much as I do about meeting people where they're at. I've spoken to blatant transphobes as equals not because I tolerate their views but because I think they can do better. Sometimes telling them that I too am a cis person helps in that. Though in general I actually hate bringing my personal orientation into it because it really doesn't matter at all.  


Especially with stuff like trans issues, it's really important to structure arguments in a manner that will reach the layperson, because the people who are going to most adamantly argue against you are not going to change their minds in that exchange (though they might later). Rhetoric and optics matter a lot here. Staying calm is really, really important, not because the person you're talking to necessarily deserves civility (I'm not impugning people for getting angry about issues that are personal to them), but rather, they're important because the people that will see an online exchange are often much broader than just the person you're directly talking to... and on trans issues, there are negative stereotypes of advocates being confrontational. Even if somebody is justified in confronting somebody in an aggressive way, feeding into that stereotype can be bad and we should be conscious of that.   


Maybe it's easier for me to stay calm because trans issues don't really directly affect me the way they would a trans person. Maybe it's my personality (I'm borderline aspergers / spectrum). I don't know. But from my perspective I don't care about the exchange itself - I care about changing peoples' minds and how to most effectively go about that.   


I think he did well in this regard at times and poorly at others. Even though everything he said regarding attraction I 100% agree with, at times he played into the ""you guys are projecting your thoughts onto me"" narrative and he could have done away with that by linking one of the (many) studies that back up what he said and asked what exactly made his conversation partner different from the findings, as opposed to the sarcastic replies he indulged in at times. But I still think that he did a good job of summarizing why he held his positions towards the end, and if a layperson were to read that thread in its entirety they would likely come away with a more positive view of him out of the two."

One of the dumbest parts of like/upvote/downvote systems is that people will react more to the tone of what you say as opposed to the content of what you say. If you look at both your comment and my own in this comment chain, we're essentially saying the same thing although you're more directly calling out the genital thing. I was more diplomatic because I find if I can disarm somebody (the reason I even brought up my own identity, in response to the guy I was replying to) I can make them question their preconceived ideas more readily, and hopefully get across a point.  


I think a lot of the sentiment that ""I would just know"" comes from insecurity and ignorance (not using this as a pejorative, just literally them not knowing much about trans people/issues), more than anything else. I'm not a mind reader, so I don't know if the dude I replied to fits that. But even so, it's always been weird to me how insecure with their sexuality most cis dudes seem to be. Most people who bring up their own preferences in these threads assume they know more than they do, and while it's not everybody that does, I think a significant portion of them are reflexively defending their ""straightness"".  


Finding out somebody is trans IS the turn off for most people. Yeah, that's a really shitty reason (and why people try to justify it with additional reasons), but that's what it is.   


Not being able to have kids is a good reason you wouldn't want to get into a long term relationship with somebody, but let's be fucking real here dudes, if you dated a girl and found out before you had sex that she was infertile I think that vast majority of us of would be cool with sleeping with her, even if it was a deal breaker for a long term relationship and I suspect that number would be a lot higher if they said they were trans, even if you physically couldn't tell *at all*. What's more, I think the chances of a girl getting assaulted for being infertile in that scenario are quite a bit lower.

Detroit and Windsor are sister cities. Windsor is one of the safest cities on the continent. Detroit is one of the most dangerous.

Needing more of your money IS the problem! /s

It's WAY more complicated than this: ""50 years of gov't spending and programs destroyed Detroit, Baltimore, Chicaco, etc etc etc.""

The issue is that money needs to be funneled into the right places and those programs need to be properly administered, and if those conditions are met, yes it absolutely does lower crime rates. It's also important to note that no amount of spending will solve for the loss of economic opportunities in a city, which is undoubtedly why these cities (including Windsor) are struggling. But that doesn't mean the programs caused the problem. They certainly didn't lol.

A lot of it is cultural too. There are police in other parts of the world which also have strong unions and do not have these same issues when a member is so blatantly abusing their position.

Which isn't to say the union doesn't play a part, but a much bigger part is played by the implicit biases the American institutions give to police embroiled in controversy. The union is a part of that, not the whole."

I didn't know. I knew he was in tech (since I kinda talked him into it after he had to switch careers), and that he did have a job in it, but didn't know where or what he did.

She was completely floored, knowing that we had still been texting / gaming together / etc. She asked what we even talked about. I showed her a bunch of memes we sent back and forth. Out of indignation, she asked my dad what his friend was doing to prove a point. My dad, being a dad, pretended not to know to get my mother riled up.

It was a pretty great Christmas dinner."

The lack of women in tech certainly exists, but they do make up around 20-25% in the broader field. In the more technical job roles the disparity gets worse (for a variety of reasons), which I imagine would cut into conference attendence, but every one I've been to has seemed to be around 1/10.

philosophy,fcdevl9,t1_fcdarf0,1577609389.0,"Well I think it's still possible. There is a stigma but it's not something that prevents people from being in those roles at all. My sister is an elementary school teacher and she has male coworkers that work in ECE. They just need to be willing to buck the stigma, which admittedly cuts into the amount of people doing it.

It's also worth mentioning that people who go into a career that's atypical for their gender tend to be the most passionate about that field. 

Male nurses and teachers in my experience have been in that role because they explicitly want to, whereas many people choose careers because they don't hate them or just picked a program by default. I.e. a lot of dudes go into IT because it's a safe bet and a natural bridge between gaming (a male dominated hobby for a bunch of dumb reasons) and college.

Which brings me to an example of the contrary - girls in IT. I work in cyber security and the male-female ratio is pretty insane. But most girls in the industry I know have much more motivation to learn and understand the tech than the average guy in the field.

My female coworker who knows at least if not more than I do, when speaking with vendors, is assumed to know less than me. I've been on those conference calls. It's absurd. We're both in the same role.

Having to deal with cultures that are implicitly hostile to your identity (even if not actively hostile) and still wanting to pursue that career takes a level of dedication.

I think male teaches like the one you had are still certainly possible today, for all those reasons. The real tragedy is the people who do love those fields but ultimately decide to go with a career that's easier (edit: in the social sense, not necessarily an easier job). 

Another friend of mine who I knew would love hacking/pen testing almost pursued nursing for this exact reason.

I introduced her to some basic resources on InfoSec and encouraged her to check them out. She's since dived headfirst into it and is self teaching. She's more motivated to get an ethical hacking position than anybody I've ever seen."
philosophy,fcctq7g,t1_fcbcnoi,1577602524.0,"To your point, we can still say somebody looks creepy and we're uncomfortable around them even if they are not engaging in off putting body language, as evidenced by the fact that the study is based on still images.

Indeed, somebody can appear creepy because they're in a poorly lit area. In certain contexts, this makes sense. Dark alleys etc. But if I'm, say, a janitor cleaning a hallway which has some burnt out lights people will perceive me as more creepy than if the lights were working. This is rather silly, but hard to avoid feeling.

Our senses can be valid but they can also be inaccurate. This study points out that somebody's appearance alone is not a good metric to judge their behavioural tendencies and these misperceptions are damaging in many cases. I don't think it's out of bounds to ask people in general to be more aware of when they are judging people disproportionately based solely on their appearance. That doesn't mean disregarding one's instincts to the point of putting ourselves in danger. I do think the phrasing of the point made could be better, though."

askscience,fc93f81,t1_fc8wh0s,1577546392.0,"I think your example is actually quite useful because it demonstrates how ""good"" a memory will be is highly contextual on how significant the sensory stimuli is to the brain.

askscience,fc73ger,t1_fc6p59d,1577496514.0,"Yes but it's likely both. Having gone through the process of learning to draw as an adult, it's both. We don't remember details of images without conscious effort to study those details. Eventually this becomes more automatic but it requires training yourself to see things as they are. The lack of mechanical skills can compound the issues but having drawn many objects from vivid memories, only to check a reference and recognize glaring mistakes, it's more than a mechanical issue. I'm certainly at the point where I'm capable of reasonably recreating a decent sketch of something but drawing from memory is still beyond me unless I consciously study the subject for later. Our brains simply don't prioritize high fidelity memories of images over functional ones that take less brain power.

Lyrics, on the other hand, are fundamentally just strings of repeated words. They're easy to remember because we already frequently practice language construction automatically by using it day to day.

If you feel you remember music more vividly, find some music in a language you don't understand which you like. Try to remember the lyrics. You won't be able to. Maybe a few words. You'll likely remember the notes better than the lyrics as you're more familiar with musical notes.

Just as with a bike drawing you'll probably get the wheels and seat, but not the frame."

TwoXChromosomes,fbzpif4,t1_fbyxcae,1577255229.0,"While I 100% agree with you I think there's something to be said for not setting unrealistic expectations for relationships or the people within them. I'm not saying you, or OP, are. That's very much a case by case thing. Just that we should make sure we're being fair and healthy to both our partners and ourselves.

My point is that people frequently look at I.e. sacrifices made for love and think that if somebody else in a similar situation really loves some other person then they would do that thing. Indeed, those sacrifices can be a huge part of it. But how much or what sacrifices are made is highly circumstantial and it's dangerous to expect certain particular actions. It's making the effort that matters.

My first serious relationship is a perfect example of this.

I loved this girl. A lot. It was a long distance relationship for over 2 years. I faced a similar situation as OP's brother. I chose not to sacrifice the life I had at home. I did so out of love.

Why? Well, if I had of moved we would have struggled financially. I stayed to finish school, because I wanted us to have a chance at a stable future. For others they might think ""to hell with it"" and indeed that's what she wanted me to do. That's fine. That's a legitimate take and maybe we could have made it work. But to say I didn't choose to do what I did for love would also be inaccurate. 

Purely looking at the situation from my perspective staying was a sacrifice. I wanted to build a future. I would have loved to run away with this girl. It's unfortunate that it also hurt her to do this, but I felt it important for the relationship to succeed long term.

Speaking with a more detached perspective now, neither of us was in the right necessarily. There's validity to both choices. I should also clarify that we didn't break up over this, she understood my perspective after we talked. But I bring it up because it's a perfect counter example to OP's brother who basically did uproot his life to be with his gf. Take your partners' situations into account and look for effort is all I'm saying. Don't think your relationship isn't as strong as somebody else only because they won't give up the same as somebody else - that's an unhealthy expectation. Maybe they have a reason and maybe they can't express the why. Give them a chance to.

Effort is what matters. Recognize that, is all I'm saying. Aaaaand if there's no effort, recognize that too. :)"
