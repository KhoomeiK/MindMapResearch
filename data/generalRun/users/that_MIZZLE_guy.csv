The other week I was at zeleno mill base, herd a dude creepin on me while I was up in a watch tower.

Could not see the guy anywhere, he was full stealth, I randomly looked down at the ground around the tower and BINGO, this guys name lights up like a neon sign, 2 tap, dead.

The only time you should see names is when you check pulse."

This is gamers for you.

Yeah, we get called lazy, or geeks/nerds, we might look funny, or choose to dress in super Mario and ""I'm a retro gamer"" apparel, and yeah, some of us still live at home.

But we are gamers.
We recognise other gamers.
We know our people.
And we damn sure got love for em!

We don't care about what car you drive, or whether you have beats by dre or $15 Amazon headphones!

OK so just for reference, this is a bit of short back story:  I am a happily married man with children and a regular life.

The Dream: I (sadly) drempt I had a totally different life!

I had different kids - a different wife, Rebecca - I had a dog - I lived in my dream house - my life was perfect!

And it just carried on, for what felt like forever. It felt like it was my real life. I remember taking my kids to their first day at school. And watching my daughters birth. And the dog - I hate dogs - yet here were all our family photos on top of my fireplace with buster the dog and Emily and Jason and their beautiful mum Rebecca.

It felt like years...

And then I woke up -

I woke up next to my wife miriam of 8 years and looked at her in shock. It was like I had just woken up in a strangers house, next to a complete stranger - and for a second I just froze.

She opened her beautiful green eyes and looked at me

""good morning babe""

A smile spread across her face.

And in that instant it all flooded back to me.
My wife, son and daughter, basically my real life.

And I cried...

I cried soo hard because I missed my family - I missed my dream family and it had become such a reality in my dream that waking up crushed me inside.

I love my real family - I always will.

It's just crazy, the things that the human brain can do, the things it can make you feel.

Like miss a family that never even existed except in the deep dark places in your mind..."

After 2 days of looking at octopus pictures we figured out it was a blue ring.

We had already put him in our big 6 foot ocean tank with our coral and eneminies. And there was no way I was reaching in there to get him back out.

He lived for a couple of months and ate all the clown fish."
