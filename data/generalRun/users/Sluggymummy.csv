weightlossafterbaby,ff9wb4e,t1_ff84zz4,1579722916.0,I second the gradual changes thing. Although they have to be somewhat intentional or else you slowly start to drop them again if you're not careful.
Tetris,ff9vyej,t3_es67y8,1579722695.0,"Good for you!

I hit 180k today, which is prob my 3rd best. :)"
1200isfineIGUESSugh,fewhdql,t3_eqoy2v,1579410608.0,"On the other hand, I found one restaurant's nutritional info online and apparently the salad was over 1200kcal. Like, I get that there's half an avocado in the salad, but I think the only way I'd get close to that is if I put on all the dressing.  Salads and dressings should be listed separate if that's the way they're served."
fatlogic,few2zzd,t1_fev2o11,1579404732.0,"Same. But I do get pretty annoyed at seeing people walking their dogs without leashes, especially big dogs. (Also my town has a bylaw for all dogs to be on leashes, so there's also that ""who do you think you are"" mild annoyance...)"
fatlogic,few0kca,t1_feusbqf,1579403753.0,"I doubt it, haha. Just a blessedly even fat distribution. 

Although, when I first put on new weight it goes straight to my stomach, making me look a little bit pregnant. But if I gain some more, it evens out...hips, thighs, a little bit everywhere. We happened to need to replace my wedding ring a few years ago and then when I lost 30 lbs, my ring became too big and now regularly almost slips off."

Showerthoughts,fetn89h,t3_eqi667,1579377111.0,"I made a fun one for my kids outside. It utilized the house, clothesline, trampoline, kiddie pool, mini slide, multiple pallets, and an IKEA tunnel. I think we had two secret entrances too."
fatlogic,fetf9ku,t1_fes9t6l,1579374858.0,He admits even in that article that after hitting 40 he takes stuff for sore joints.
fatlogic,fetdoha,t1_fesdtu6,1579374296.0,I wore a US size 10 at that height and weight.  I didn't have any blood pressure or joint issues though. I just felt too heavy to run or be active comfortably.  I felt much better and lighter in the 130-135 range (I never made it smaller).
intermittentfasting,fepp63p,t3_eq7kla,1579326699.0,Great job! What a huge difference!
fatlogic,fep494s,t3_eq5xqr,1579311791.0,"It *is* my fault I'm regaining the weight, haha. 
Baby #4 FTW!

(But starting at 135lbs has been way better than starting at 165lbs.)"
fatlogic,fep05k1,t1_fenza3s,1579309186.0,"Thanks. I didn't feel tiny, but I always took some comfort in knowing that I came across as small. (Maybe too much comfort since I didn't try to lose weight until I almost had health issues.)"

fatlogic,fen3d8u,t1_femw3nt,1579276069.0,That really was close to what I looked like at that height near that weight.
fatlogic,fen1o9x,t3_eq0je2,1579274985.0,"This actually isn't too far off from what I looked like at 5'3"" and 165lbs. My fat distribution was just spread a little more evenly.  But I was still called ""small"" by people who knew me and people would have told me I didn't need to lose weight.

Edit: no idea what my waist was though.

AskReddit,feky2u7,t1_fektkdr,1579209986.0,I was so not used to my baby's name with my first. He got called my parent's dog's name (which they got when I moved out) or my brother's name until I got used to his.
