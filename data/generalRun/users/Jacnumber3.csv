Showerthoughts,fewpbnx,t1_fev9pf9,1579417463.0,What in the absolute fuck have you been talking about in this entire thread? That dude explained what I meant literally 25 comments ago.
Showerthoughts,fev0q3g,t1_feuka5l,1579391848.0,This dude clearly didn’t. Yikes. I’m glad I wasn’t the only one losing it over what he’s saying. Lol
Showerthoughts,fev0hvc,t1_feuitbh,1579391795.0,"I’m saying that scripts rarely call for a character to laugh. Meanwhile, these scenes that are supposed to be comedic are ongoing while no one in the scene is laughing."

MichiganWolverines,felfo0n,t1_fekmcio,1579221063.0,"Well, I’m not going off irrelevant history. I’m going off the fact that Washington lost Peterson, Eason and the RB can’t remember his name. And they just had an 8 win season in the PAC 12. So.. just logic. It’s not even a “big game.”"
MichiganWolverines,fekkw0f,t1_fekemlm,1579202172.0,How can you possibly think we lose to Washington?
AbruptChaos,fdrcw6n,t1_fdpwn46,1578682662.0,Smith’s. No one has seen these? It protects against light which helps milk last longer
AmItheAsshole,fdqni9g,t3_emkhda,1578670829.0,"YTA. 
Not only in this instance, but from what I can infer, you seem like the complete asshole package and the asshole apple didn’t fall too far from the asshole tree. 
Is it possible to be the worst helicopter parent ever? I can’t put into words how unbelievably awful you are in this instance. The fact that you have to ask if you’re an asshole here is terrifying. Do you have any self awareness whatsoever?"
youseeingthisshit,fdodfpe,t3_ema1iu,1578603114.0,Just like America to swoop in and steal your resources and just enjoy them right in front of you because they know you can’t do shit about it.
youseeingthisshit,fdnzt89,t1_fdnlepr,1578596190.0,"Forgive me, is what she said as she grabbed her keys and stormed for the door. The light that shined through as she walked out is the last light that I’ve seen in months. I’ve stowed away inside my finished basement, with shag carpeting and full bathroom. That’s unrelated but I’m proud of it. 
  She left me and took the kids, the cat and the car. She’s vanished from my life much like I’ve vanished from society. Death is what has come of us now. At least to the perspective of the outside world. 
  So forgive me if I can’t forgive her, leaving me to rot in a perfectly suitable 1 bedroom basement with newly insulated walls and water pipes for the shower. Sure, it may have cost more money than I originally anticipated and I went way over budget. But, is that reason to abandon me here? Can you put a price limit on love? Apparently, is the answer. 
  Apparently, furnishing a basement with brand new recliners and smart appliances as well as waterfall shower heads and faucets is just a little more than the worth of my affection and devotion. Apparently, BRUSHED NICKEL IS MORE VALUABLE THAN MY LOYALTY CAN COMPENSATE FOR. 
  So no, I won’t forgive you. I will, however, enjoy steadily growing facial hair and not having to keep anyone updated on how my job search is going while not cleaning up the popcorn I drop in between the cracks of the recliner cushions because it hurts when I put my hand in such a tight hole. 
AND THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS WHAT SHE SAID"
