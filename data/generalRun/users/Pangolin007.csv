MoDaoZuShi,ffmuoju,t3_etc62z,1580059141.0,"Just finished the novel, and am confused on one point- Do we ever find out how Wei WuXian actually died? I thought throughout the novel it was hinting that he didn't die the way everyone thought he did, but we never find out what actually happened."
writing,ffjfc5x,t3_etxyl0,1579997057.0,"I agree, to a point. I think villains should be intriguing and possibly likeable for sure, but the hero shouldn't be so bland that the audience doesn't care if they win or lose. I don't think Darth Vader or The Joker are ""too cool"" to be villains. I think that Luke and Batman just weren't engaging enough (for some). If the audience is disappointed that the protagonist won, then the author has failed. If the audience can't remember who the antagonist is, then the author has failed. A story needs both a well-written protagonist and a well-written antagonist to survive.

Black Panther is a good example. Killmonger was evil, but understandable. He and T'Challa were well-balanced. Both stood out in their own ways and the story worked well because of it."
writing,ffje1yk,t3_etyiqe,1579996303.0,"Writing a unique story is mostly about the way you write it, not about whether the synopsis sounds similar to other stories. I've heard people claim that The Hunger Games ripped off Battle Royale, but despite sharing a similar premise, they tell different stories. It's perfectly fine to be inspired by other stories (I know I often am), just make sure that you aren't directly copying plot points and you should be fine."

AskReddit,fevhaxl,t1_feta3xp,1579397430.0,Okami is fantastic. The creators did such a great job building the world and the characters to be things I actually care about. And it’s so therapeutic to play!
AskReddit,fevgkch,t1_fetll9l,1579397128.0,"I got my DSi in 2008 and still love it. The only game my parents ever got me was Nintendogs, so now I’m just experiencing a ton of new games that are all relatively inexpensive (if you take a risk and buy them off of eBay). I recently got Pokémon platinum for $12 and I’m loving it."
AskReddit,fevg6ls,t1_fet3kiu,1579396962.0,"I played Brotherhood first and absolutely loved it, but none of the others really held my attention as much."
AskReddit,fevfkkc,t1_feudhre,1579396840.0,"I loved it but I thought they removed just slightly too much of the classic Zelda feel. My main gripes: no classic green clothes, no real dungeons, and the divine beasts were too easy and quick to defeat. Also, Epona. Overall, I thought the story was lacking. I wasn’t nearly as invested with any of the characters as I was in all of the other Zelda games. I think the fact that you could basically beat the game in any order worked against it. 

I guess I should say, I loved it, until I went back and played Skyward Sword for the first time. I’d bought Skyward Sword when it first came out and initially hated it and basically didn’t play it. It’s not perfect, but upon trying again, I really like it. And it makes me sad for what BotW could’ve been."

AskReddit,fevdpa5,t1_fetq984,1579396218.0,"Well, it’s usually the people in power who have ensured that the system works in such a way that people can gain power without having the world’s best interests in mind. 

For example, Trump. Now, some people support him, and I’m not going to argue with anyone who does. It’d be a waste of both of our time. Personally, I believe he’s leading my country in the wrong direction. The point is, Trump won the election and is now the President of the United States. The U.S., a democracy. Yet, he did not win the popular vote. More people voted against him, for Hillary Clinton, than voted for him. I don’t think Clinton was the best candidate either, but I do think she would’ve been better. 

So do we deserve to suffer because of the decisions of the minority?

And there have been good leaders in history. There are good leaders today. Collectively, humanity might not seem to want better, but is the world not a better place today than it was a hundred years ago?

I ended up writing a long rant and I dunno why."

I'm in a dorm this year but next year planning on moving to the school-owned apartments, which have a full kitchen (but you still have to get a meal plan). But, I'll be pretty busy, so maybe I'll just have to get a meal plan."
college,fes5kwb,t1_ferszr6,1579361646.0,"The thing is, next year, I'm planning on living in the school-owned apartment which has a full kitchen and fridge/freezer. Which makes it even more ridiculous that they force us to buy a meal plan anyway. I'd probably be buying my groceries from Giant or Costco.
