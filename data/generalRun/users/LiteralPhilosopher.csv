mildlyinteresting,ffia7bp,t1_ffhx7fk,1579969024.0,"> Paint grade pine is finger jointed because it doesnt matter if its jointed. Not necessarily cheap but more cost effective yes. It depends on the application. Stain grade pine has no joints because some stains are clear or semi transparent and seeing the joint would not look good. Clear pine has little to no knots. Knotty pine is knotty.

A finger joint is an easily visible style of joint, but it does carry the benefit of being able to be used with cheap, knotty wood. Other joint styles are more readily concealed. So if you're going to make something out of pine that's so cheap it's going to need to be painted anyway, you might as well use the finger joint for its strength. 

However, if you want to make a non-painted project, i.e. only using stain to treat the wood, you need two things: a better style of joint, and a higher grade of pine without knots (AKA 'clear pine').

It's actually worse than that, and it's what makes me sick about prosperity doctrine: it's ""If God loves you, he'll make you rich.""

Anyone who's taken the smallest bit of logic class can see that as an A -> B setup. Unfortunately, that leaves us able to do what's called ""denying the consequent"". It essentially is also saying that if you're not rich, *God doesn't love you.*
