* I have spent way too much time deciding who my favorite Villain is..when I should be doing my statistics homework.  If l had unlimited time I would probably change my answers several more times...except for Zoro , I will always choose Zoro, even if he can't find his way out of a paper bag, bless his heart."
OnePiece,ffaz44y,t3_esjvgz,1579747841.0,"My husband hates One Piece, mainly because he thinks that the characters act silly and he wants them to be serious.  He does enjoy other anime such as BNHA and Aggretsuko.  I actually enjoy the silliness because it helps make the sad parts a bit more bearable.  Of course One Piece isn't specifically geared to neither my husband nor myself as I am 48 and female and hubby is 57.  So what do we know...."
OnePiece,ffaxzpv,t3_esfmn7,1579747100.0,"I thought Luffy was telling us how awesome Nine Inch Nails is.....Seriously though....I love Luffy.  Thanks for sharing,"
OnePiece,fewgepf,t3_eqm3b4,1579410149.0,I prefer Zoro any way I can get him!!!! I adore Zoro!
OnePiece,fe08pbh,t3_en4zzs,1578806136.0,"My favorite when Zoro tells the crew that Luffy may be an idiot, but he is still their captain while explaining why Usopp just can’t come back to the crew without apologizing.  They aren’t just pretending to be pirates!!!!"
OnePiece,fdm84za,t3_elwqbg,1578542164.0,It has been a pretty crappy day.... but this just made it a thousand times better!  Thanks for sharing...
TheTempleOfOchako,fdj2i1f,t3_elf31y,1578456741.0,"Your wife already knows it looks great... seriously...I wish the post title said “look what my wife inked- very proud of her artistic ability.  I would so upvote that, but just can’t press that upvote because it feels so forced and pandering for upvotes. Still love the artwork though. Great job!"
OnePiece,fd74px5,t3_ek4tnu,1578199404.0,"Great job explaining why you like One Piece....I had a conversation with my husband tonight about why I love it- he can't understand why a 48 year old woman would be so obsessed with a manga or anime.....I am new to the party- almost a year now and am just now to Marineford.  and am reading the manga as I go along .  I too like how Luffy, a the main character, isn't all preachy and goody goody.  He truly cares about his friends.  The backstory that hit me the hardest was Chopper....but honestly I think I cried at them all.....and I can't even see baby Laboon making that sweet squeek noise without sobbing...."
OnePiece,fd71xts,t3_ek6an8,1578198437.0,"very nice!  I like the three color style....simple but classy.  Nice job, thanks for sharing."
