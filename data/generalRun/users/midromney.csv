Is this not true?"
nba,fff30rs,t1_ffdqjfm,1579874337.0,"From #2, theoretically, it should swing back in the East's favor because: mediocre Eastern teams that make the playoffs make extra money from more games that can then be used to spend more on better players.

I mean, this is the show that had ""When is man going to walk on the sun?"" and ""What if it was the best chicken mcnugget ever?"" and ""So how many of the spice girls turned you down before...?"" etc. What are the chances that I just happened to read a comment from someone stating their favorite Ali G moment is one that is neither funny nor interesting when there are so many other moments to choose from?"

Like, Ali G was a comedy show. You sure you don't want to choose something funny as your favorite instead of something that's barely mildly interesting?"

nba,feymx75,t1_few43ew,1579447739.0,Define experienced. Is it not the Warriors?
WoT,feyljbb,t1_feyf6x5,1579447208.0,"1. The black ajah doesn't follow the 3 oaths, so they're not really aes sedai. If they aren't really aes sedai, then they shouldn't have the power to depose a lawfully raised Amyrlin (Siuan). If Siuan was unlawfully deposed, then no new Amyrlin can be lawfully raised. Raising one using the black ajah only makes it more illegitimate.

2. Egwene's keeper was black ajah, too. And the rebels had murders in their camp as well. Your assertion that reds and unaligned sisters did the most good needs evidence. You're acting like having openly hostile forces fighting on the same side wouldn't have caused problems. Perrin knew this and caused the White Cloaks to ally themselves prior to the last battle. Rand knew this and forced the Seanchan to agree to fight alongside the aes sedai. Egwene knew this and reunited the tower.

Egwene was the only option because she was already head of the rebels, and Elaida was unfit to rule. Are you saying there was someone else?

3. Being beaten several times per day enough to require multiple healings per day is torture. Sorry I'm not as badass as you that I can ignore that.

4. Gotcha, an imaginary point."
WoT,feycqwl,t1_fexs1dl,1579443840.0,"1. Elaida was raised by the minimum number of sitters required, with at least 1 of those being black ajah; therefore, she was not raised lawfully.

2. Elaida's inability to maintain unity solely within the White Tower shows she was unfit to lead. Had Egwene ceded to her demands, stopped the rebellion, and reunified, Elaida would have just ruined the rest of the sisters, too. The White Tower needed to be whole in preparation for the last battle, so Egwene taking control of everyone was the only option.

3. Egwene is not the one most eager for war. She specifically stays in the White Tower to be tortured because she believes she can solve the rebellion without a war. You think she couldn't have escaped any time she wanted and commanded an attack?

4. Not sure what you're talking about regarding homoerotic stimuli."
nba,fewnkl8,t1_feweuml,1579415867.0,Pretty sure Livingston retired.
nba,fewmvir,t1_fewfnoq,1579415098.0,"Kawhi was already injured. Would Kawhi have been out for a while season if he wasn't playing while injured? Not sure you can blame that all in Zaza, and you definitely can't say it's intentional."
