Pathfinder is probably gonna be picked more now, that's true. But probably not as a replacement to Wraith. Wraith portal is just too important."
apexlegends,ffbbm19,t1_ffbb2j4,1579758671.0,Powerful abilities should not be spammable. It's a nerf any decent player can accept.

apexlegends,ff5jn4x,t3_erqrma,1579596004.0,Always be closing is good for preventing your random teammates being loot goblins.... At least in theory.
Games,ff5b749,t3_erehb2,1579585918.0,Many people seem to give praise. In my opinion it is just the same as Xenoverse and I was hoping for something different.
apexlegends,ff31ql3,t1_ff2ycgk,1579531379.0,That's a more about sniping possibilities. Map is more open.
apexlegends,ff2wj9t,t1_ff2uadr,1579526819.0,"There are no penalties for leaving outside of ranked. They probably should add this to pubs in a lighter format. 

Right now it's too often my team just wants to hotdrop, die and leave."
apexlegends,ff2watc,t1_ff2vy7k,1579526585.0,"That's something you have to always think about. If a fight takes too long it might be better to split. You also need to be aware of your positioning.

It is actually not that bad right now. In old map and old audio it was much worse."
Games,ff2ikkn,t3_eqzfxs,1579507709.0,"It was casual first with NES and first PCs. Once online gaming started going it quickly became an addiction. Showing off your progression and skill to people around the world was amazing.

Making friends along the way that you sometimes still play/talk with 15+ years later is pretty special."

apexlegends,fems8zt,t1_femq6ku,1579268141.0,I think it's very random. In both modes so far I got a win pretty quickly.
apexlegends,fejof0t,t1_fejnvau,1579181588.0,"Complete your dailys every day at least. 

It helps to party up with other ppl and get top 5 for big bonus exp.

So hot dropping will not work in your favor."

apexlegends,fed2ph0,t1_fed22as,1578995787.0,"Ranked progress will probably never be transferred as that would not be fair. 

And we talking EA here.. I doubt they will ever let you transfer skins.

So don't bet on it."
apexlegends,fecxjeo,t1_feb1ieb,1578988650.0,"Well a competitive scene should give some popularity boost and helps keep current player base strong.

They can fix bugs along the way. Nothing is really game breaking at the moment besides sometimes audio issues. 

Though it seems to take too long to fix anything. So I don't fully disagree with you."

apexlegends,fe6rr2s,t1_fe6rde8,1578902297.0,"Just hop into the game, it got a better training mode now. You can check and tryout all the items in there.

Coolest change is the golden backpack which will heal the person you revive for quite a bit."
apexlegends,fe6rof9,t1_fe6r784,1578902196.0,It's not a serious and historical correct game lol
apexlegends,fe6lgp7,t1_fe6ju7c,1578894871.0,It's just for Battlepass level. So it does not do anything when max
apexlegends,fe6lca1,t1_fe6kzyk,1578894741.0,What the heck you talking about? The army skin is one of the better skins in game
gaming,fe2x1m5,t3_enojcd,1578843780.0,"I've spend way too much time on GunZ when it came out. Felt proud of being one of the first flying around ""k-style"". I was even one of the highest level for a while in ijji-GunZ.. not that it ment anything... 

But the game / developers were just too flawed

* Hacking/Cheating was never really solved. People who bought in game items (spended real money) were not even punished when caught hacking. (Game host company Ijji was truely garbage)
* Lag/Ping was a huge issue. You had to lead your shots which was made bearable by using shotguns. But ppl in certain areas just got a huge adventage coz they had the same-ish high ping to everybody and got used to it. Others noticed this and tried to lag on purpose.
* Pay to win model was there. The premium meds just healed so much.. compare that with high pings and you became unkillable.

A good private server can get rid of some of those issues. But I doubt it will attract new players which results in empty servers."

apexlegends,fdntvi0,t1_fdnrm3r,1578592731.0,"They have a competitive scene planned and teams are practicing hard on current map. So at least for trios I highly doubt it.

But possible for event map or solos/duos."
apexlegends,fdmoi5i,t1_fdmj75n,1578558090.0,"I don't really see the correct answer yet so I'll give a try.

Hemlock is excellent for mid range as it can have barrel attachment and good damage per bullet. But you will lose against most other weapons close due it being short burst. It is a decent gun overall only.
But you might as well pickup a scout which is really strong in current meta.

Prowler is only for shorter range as it does not have barrel mod. The spray spread is too much for longer range. The DMG is good but like Hemlock it is too slow. You need the select fire but still it will feel inferior to R99. That's because R99 can even be used mid range with a good barrel mod. 

I suggest just to compare them in training ground to get a clear picture."
apexlegends,fdk11bd,t1_fdjzu3h,1578493390.0,"It got boring extremely fast for me. Specially when ppl started to just leave when dying. 

While winter express was surprisingly fun with only a minor complaint being the respawn times."
apexlegends,fdk0hsc,t1_fdjyi5m,1578492988.0,"Specially streamers and content creators often love facing ""noobs"". It makes them seem like pros when getting high averages.

Sadly the players who actually would benefit from sbmm just blindly agree with them and shout it's bad. 

There is no proper matchmaking yet but it's not even a huge issue. There are worse concerns right now like cheaters and leavers."
apexlegends,fdebt5p,t3_ekk60q,1578335590.0,Nvm the whole  SBMM  discussion. People always hot drop and leave instantly in pubs... its no longer fun

todayilearned,fddqavc,t1_fddionw,1578321112.0,Smaller countries like Belgium and the Netherlands got no space for more trees. Almost all the land is occupied already. And you can't really add more trees to existing forests.
todayilearned,fddq1nf,t3_ektb9t,1578320901.0,Some countries just don't got any space for more trees.
apexlegends,fddi1tf,t1_fddgxsq,1578313145.0,"Yeah I agree.

If they do, they have to compensate for the skins with crafting materials or RP."
apexlegends,fddhxch,t1_fddb0ax,1578313000.0,People are practicing hard in current map for announced tournaments. I highly doubt they will bring back the old map in the main game mode for a long while.

I was truely suprised how fast it melted people with some lucky shots. 

It has too much muzzle flash though, I think its only good as hip-fire close range."

apexlegends,fcz7dss,t1_fcz5mkx,1578095166.0,"This is extra annoying in the winter express event. As your weapons are refreshed every time.

Quickly swap to your hammer point p2020 to finish the kill? Nope you are dead coz waiting for the animations.

But in normal modes it is usually not an easy."

If still nobody home it will be delivered at a central drop off point, usually a store that partners with delivery company.

Or if it's not a signed package, it can be delivered to neighbors and they will leave a note where it is.

Does not sound that complicated and no more porch pirates."
