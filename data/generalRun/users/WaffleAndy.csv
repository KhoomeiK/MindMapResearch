puppy101,ff65yka,t3_erv96m,1579619936.0,"I have a similar issue where my puppy will get worked up and start jumping at me or my wife, and sometimes latch onto our sleeves and really rough tug and growl. Like she is mad that we didnt do something she wanted or go a direction she wanted to go.

We have seen 2 separate trainers. The first said to just ignore it, that didnt work, and I lost a jacket due to bite marks. 

The new trainer has said to just make a really loud noise like ""AH AH AH"" and that will kind of reset them out of confusion. Then you will have an opportunity to tell them sit, and then reward them for proper behavior. So far since we saw the new trainer Daisy has only done this once to me, and it worked fairly well."

dogs,feekbo5,t1_feeiodw,1579035487.0,"Yeah I give her ice cubes and frozen kings with some peanut butter. I think she still has some teeth to go!

She does one thing on walks where she will get irritated that we are walking (she sometimes wants to just stop and sniff and roll in the grass) and jump up and bite our sleeves and not let go. I think this is not a teething issue unfortunately, so still working to get that to stop. :("

FIFA,fcnzjv2,t1_fcntso7,1577821406.0,"Offside is based on the 2nd to last defender, not the last defender. And defender can be anyone on the team without the ball, even the forwards. It is just typically the GK who is the last defender, and is not typically the offsides line. If however the GK has a teammate behind him for whatever reason, the offside line would be drawn at the keeper. 

For 2v1s vs the last defender (the GK typically, but not always as described above), you can pass backwards but not forwards. In your video, number 15 (the guy who actually interfered with the ball) was offsides as he was in front of the guy who passed. The player who attempted the ""bicycle"" kick would have been onside, if number 15 had not been there."
