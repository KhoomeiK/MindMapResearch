interestingasfuck,ffnhg89,t3_eu7lul,1580066032.0,My border collie did this. These folks don't mess around. It is a very tense environment at these events.
AskMen,ffiiv0f,t1_ffh4t5n,1579974922.0,"Seriously, I agree back at you. It has such great potential if it would focus more on the craft and not the people behind the object. Cheers!"
pics,ffhwqye,t3_etm35y,1579957327.0,Yes he does.
AskMen,ffgpubg,t1_ffgl1qo,1579912010.0,"Five eps. I normally give a show three. I wanted to like it. If I have to watch an entire season for it to get me on the hook, then I don't have time for it. I gave Walking dead Four seasons. And the repair shop 6 eps. Time is precious, I'm not going to spend it on shows that don't hook me. Cheers!"
AskMen,ffg99uk,t3_etbhft,1579901218.0,"Ask him if he needs help with chores, or needs groceries. Everyday tasks are a bitch and a half when depressed after losing a loved one. People in this situation not know what they need. That's not where their mind is. Offer specific ways to help. If turned down, know they are grateful, and continue to be supportive to your friend. Cheers."
childfree,ffg7wwa,t3_etb8ad,1579900382.0,"Wow. That's sexist as hell. You have a uterus, so you should use it. You also got compared to a car, so that makes it degrading as well. Next time tell him, ""You have an asshole, be a shame not to have a dick in it.""


Edit: <a short rant>: I cannot stop thinking about this. If someone said this in front of me to my SO, I think I'd need to be restrained. This is an appalling bingo. 1,3,5,7,9 I can't even right now! OP, don't stand for that. Go to your Human Resources department. Folks like him just Cannot Understand Normal Thinking.  <rant over> Cheers everyone. Have a great day."
AskMen,ffg6vs3,t3_etcmuk,1579899739.0,"Disenchanted: lived up to the title. 

The Walking Dead: too repetitive. 

The Repair Shop: had too much focus on the customers' sob stories, and not enough on the actual repairs. Show me how you fixed the clock Steve!!"
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffg6bud,t1_fffqkkl,1579899398.0,"Yeah get that. Cheese for life. Also, I miss icecream. Coconut icecream is good, and has a place in my freezer. It's just not the same though."

NorthCarolina,ff8ulsh,t1_ff85za4,1579696629.0,Nope.
