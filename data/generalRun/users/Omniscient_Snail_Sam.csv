SubredditDrama,fgjjqtj,t1_fgjhqgd,1580845480.0,"He says the law in question would compel using preferred pronouns. It doesn't do that. These are both facts, not matters of opinion. Unless you're saying you like him *because* he lies, in which case, sure, that's up to your opinion, but it's kind of a shit opinion."
SubredditDrama,fgjfg74,t1_fgj9k8o,1580842919.0,">He was against being legally compelled to use the proper pronouns of a person

This was his explanation for why he objected a law that *didn't do that*. Being misinformed would be a possible explanation for the initial claim, but after how long he's maintained it, he is deeply stupid, lying, or both.

I mean, he also claims that the presence of double helices in ancient art means the artists had spiritual knowledge of DNA, so ""deeply stupid"" is kind of a given."
SubredditDrama,fgjeams,t1_fgj05ey,1580842236.0,Tables trees same thing to me.
DebateEvolution,fg8gs5i,t3_exgc92,1580619026.0,"Here, I'll change your mind:

Science inherently doesn't prove *anything* because any explanation of observed phenomena relies on unverifiable assumptions such as ""the world existed thirty seconds ago,"" ""my senses reflect a universe that exists outside my mind,"" and ""my memories are based on things I experienced in the past."" These are things we need to assume to function in the world, but you can't *prove* them.

Furthermore, there are infinite unfalsifiable explanations for observed phenomena, such as ""your muscles don't actually move you around; it's actually invisible elves, and when you go to investigate human movement, the tricksy elves show you fake evidence about muscles, just to mess with you.""

Thus, unlike in math, which is made by humans and subject to known, constructed rules, proof in science is inherently impossible. Instead of proofs, science develops theories, which are the explanations for phenomena that best fit observations while minimizing assumptions.

So rather than a proof, evolution is a theory, much like the theory of universal gravitation, or the germ theory of disease.

There are competing explanations for biodiversity, but when you try to fit them to observations of the real world, they always end up bringing in tricksy elves."
law,ffxdfi4,t1_ffuhhie,1580322878.0,"This case probably won't make it that far, and almost certainly isn't *intended* to. 

As an Alabamian, I think what people miss about Roy Moore is that fundamentally, the man is just a grifter who wants to make a large passive income. This stunt, just like the Ten Commandments stunt, is designed to make it look like he's fighting super hard for vaguely-defined Evangelical values, without actually requiring that he *do* much of anything.

This results in two things: Moore not having to do a real job, and tons of donations rolling in to his charitable foundation. This foundation's activities, as far as I can tell, consist of two things: occasionally writing an amicus brief or press release, and paying Moore and his family exorbitant salaries."

SubredditDrama,ffqqsz0,t1_ffq3ufd,1580141490.0,"Honestly, it amazes me that Anita Sarkeesian, out of all the possible feminists, became this icon of everything they fear, because a few years back when I went to watch her content I couldn't get through much of it because it was just super boring. Like, nothing against her, but from what I've seen she pretty much just points out the obvious. Which isn't to say that her work doesn't have value, because sometimes taking a step back and providing a broad overview can be helpful (and the reactions to her work do indicate that perhaps what I see as obvious is shocking to others).

To me, her work is like Raisin Bran. I'm not a fan, but it has its purpose. There are criticisms of it I'd agree with, but if you don't like Raisin Bran because it's too *spicy*, there might actually be something wrong with you.

That said, I do find it hilarious and satisfying that the bizarre overreactions to her work ended up propelling her into greater success."

law,ff9doj4,t1_ff68fa7,1579710749.0,"Not quite.

The X axis is the amount, and the height of a bar for a given amount is the percent of convictions who were reported as having *that* amount, not that amount or more.

In other words, once the higher sentence for 280 g was established, it's not that minorities started being disproportionally reported as having *at least* the amount that leads to a higher sentence. It's that they started being disproportionally reported as having *exactly* the amount that leads to a higher sentence."
law,ff6bc7r,t1_ff4nwiq,1579623457.0,"You know what, yeah, I can totally see that. The racial disparity would of course still need to be accounted for, but that would absolutely explain a large portion of why a spike would show up there at all."
law,ff4dq8y,t1_ff4cngw,1579561185.0,"If anything, I would expect the opposite. When claiming exactly 280g, the defense could argue ""scales aren't perfect, so it could have been a bit less,"" but if the findings showed that the suspect had 300g, that would leave far less doubt that the amount was at least 280.

And yeah, whatever the effects of this, it's hard to find an ""innocent"" explanation that accounts for the racial disparity."

Pathfinder2e,feahhzb,t3_enztwr,1578948834.0,This is great timing. I'm running Thistletop today and was planning on just using a reskinned hellhound. This is way more thematic. I'll probably bump up the save DC as a commenter suggested.
DebateEvolution,fdevy5n,t1_fdeq8fx,1578347725.0,"It makes perfect sense, assuming every organism is equally likely to reproduce.

But an organism with a beneficial mutation is more likely to reproduce, and an organism with a harmful mutation is less likely to reproduce (assuming we're using the reproductive fitness sense of ""beneficial"" and ""harmful"").

Thus, while harmful mutations almost certainly *are* more common than beneficial ones, harmful mutations don't propagate well because they reduce their chances of propagation, while beneficial mutations propagate well because they increase their chances of propagation.

Take progeria, for example. It's an autosomal dominant mutation that causes rapid aging. It's a devastating childhood disease.

In an error catastrophe scenario, these sorts of diseases become more and more common as people pass them on to their kids, and more and more of humanity is descended from people with the progeria allele.

This of course ignores that people with the progeria allele don't have kids, because they don't live to be that old.

Now, many harmful mutations have a lesser effect on fitness, but any level of reproductive differential makes a huge difference over many generations in a large population. This is something you can test for yourself in a statistical simulation."
