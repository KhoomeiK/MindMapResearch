Also the tie ins between overwork and anxiety is,,,not obvious,..

It seems far more likely that people have anxiety and are getting diagnosed, and that people don't realize how common it is to have some form of anxiety. Dependinging on the source material research estimates are that somewhere between 1 in 5 (US) and 1 in 20 (worldwide) people have an anxiety disorder. 

Further, artists are more likely to suffer from anxiety and related disorders.

Frankly, with groups this size you would statistically speaking expect to have at least one with anxiety disorder."

These games are being used to getting the squad ready for how they're supposed to play, making sure we have the backups ready for every position, which would (hopefully) put us in a situation where we can plug and play as needed instead of changing tactics depending on who happens to be available. That means get Minamino up to scratch as quick as possible, and games against lower tier teams is a gift for this. Actually getting a 2-2 will probably get another game we don't really care that much about for Minamino, fucking up our lead and leaving us with another game might actually end up benefitting us in the long term."

It gets him used to the game, the playstyle, and lets a few of his teammates get used to playing around him (at least now that he's playing with some of the other backups and not just the kids).     
Which is better than him not playing at all, and accomplishes a lot of what you'd want, if not everything (because players need rest).

> Minamino plays well in the midfield too - like he did at Salzburg, his Japanese club and the second half against Wolves.

We don't need another midfielder.

From what I understand the plan is for him to be Firmino's backup, which makes sense considering how toothless our attack tend to become when Firmino is out. We need a backup for his role in our system.    
So presumably the plan with Minamino is to have him as a false 9 to enable the wingers, who in that case are acting more like traditional strikers.   
In which case you want Origi on the wing, exactly because of his striker like qualities. And then it kinda makes sense to play him alongside the newly acquired false 9 you're planning on playing him with.

If you're not going to play him there, what was the point of getting him? We already have 2 players and then some for each position in the midfield."

Estimated age for promotion to lt.col (the rank above major) is 39, assuming you started as early as possible and went straight for officer rank.    

She's 38, meaning that even if she started at the earliest opportunity she wouldn't be ""due"" for another promotion for another year.   

But she didn't start as early as possible, she started at age 22 when she signed up as a specialist (not directly to officer training). She was later, after her tour, selected for Officer Candidate School and graduated that in 07.    
Her promotion to major came 2 years earlier than normal, going by service length.

His interviews are basically just getting the people there to talk about whatever it is they want to talk about, having a conversation. He did one with Tulsi Gabbard that was amazing (she's not entirely comfy at the start, and by the end she's dropping F-bombs and having a great time)."

Det er hovedsakelig lokapolitikere som er veldig i mot (på grunn av at det er deres egne godt betalte jobber som ryker).

Jeg driter i om han ombestemte seg i det han landet.

Forsåvidt så var han en aktiv deltaker i et helt år, uavhengig om han fant ut at han ville hjem etter første runde med noen som fikk skyte tilbake. Så det er mye tid der han var aktiv deltaker om han på det tidspunkt ville hjem eller ikke.

> Jeg er ingen forsvarer av IS, men denne saken er litt mer nyansert enn du vil ha det til. Jeg synes sju år er en passende straff alt tatt i betrakning.

Bare sånn at vi har dette helt klart.   
Det at han reiste ned og vervet seg til IS er nok til at jeg mener han burde ha vært dømt for landsforræderi og henrettet (eller i det minste gitt en forvaringsdom, sperret inne og kast nøkkelen). Da altså før vi snakker om aktiv deltakelse i noen av IS sine operasjoner.

Ikke bare var grusomhetene til IS godt dokumentert av norske myndigheter og media, deres egen propaganda var full av henrettelser og overgrep mot sivile.   
Mer sannsynlig så likte han dårlig at lykken snudde, han så nok for seg mer voldtekt av ungjenter og henrettelser av vantro og ikke så mye faktisk kriging.   
Ikke like morro når fienden kan skyte tilbake.

De har, begge to, vært aktive deltakere i en organisasjon som gjennomførte folkemord, massedrap, tortur, voldtekt, sexslaveri, og stort sett alle andre overgrep du kan forestille deg, mye av det gjort på så grusomt vis som overhodet mulig.    
Vi snakker om ungjenter som har blitt voldtatt fremfor familien og solgt inn i sexslaveri, kvinner som har blitt tvunget til å se på at barna deres får halsen skåret over, hele folkegrupper som har blitt utsatt for ekstreme overgrep.     
Det er ikke slik at dette er noe de ""kanskje"" kan ha vært involvert i, vi vet at de er skyldige som faen hele gjengen.

Det er ikke noe å reparere her, dette er ikke folk som vi kan fikse, og det er umoralsk å prøve. Vi kan like gjerne send en flokk diplomater til Syria for å personlig spytte ofrene i ansiktet.
