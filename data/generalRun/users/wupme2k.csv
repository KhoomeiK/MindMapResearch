> causes more wifi traffic/noiae for us all..

So what? People need it at their homes for mobile devices, stop bitching.

> Simple, right? Ur using a Laptop or ipad? Ok use wifi. Tv? Run a cable Fridge? Run a cable Desktop pc? Run a cable. Games console? Run a cable.

And yet you showed the reason why this would not reduce the amount of wifi networks. Also a lot of TVs don't even have an ethernet port. And don't get me started about costs to install network cables properly where there are none.
And installing them properly is something not even possible for people, and they don't want to have them visible.

So seriously, stop bitching."

Alcohol itself is not enough, you have to be rather stupid to begin with to do something like this.
Same goes for guys who piss drunk start annoying the crap out of girls. The Alcohol is not to blame here, its just showing their nature."
