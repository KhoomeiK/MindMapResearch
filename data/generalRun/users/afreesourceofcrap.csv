Anything that isn't an ""Oscar movie"" for lack of a better term won't get a look. Even outliers like Heath Ledger for his Joker wouldn't have happened if he hadn't died. His performance was great, but I doubt they would have even given the award if he didn't die.

For Picard he'll get the sci award nominations for sure. Hopefully they pick up several Saturn awards in different categories. But I'd be shocked if they get noms from the more mainstream awards."
