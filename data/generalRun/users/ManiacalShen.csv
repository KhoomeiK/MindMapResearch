You can tax and legislate around some sub-problems, though. For instance, some cities with AirBnB problems have put quotas on short term rentals.

With long term rentals, personally I think it's one thing to build or buy a whole apartment building and another to buy up a bunch of houses and condos to rent out so regular people can't buy anything. If that's a big problem in a city, they can explore taxing second residences, taxing vacant dwellings, some kind of licensing for landlords, etc. Small-time landlords also seem to cause a lot more problems for tenants, anecdotally; a management company that owns three high rises does NOT want the housing department's aggro."
