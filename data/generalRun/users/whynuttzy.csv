""Watch women's sports"" shouldn't be interpreted as a command, but as a suggestion. It's not about forcing someone to do something they don't enjoy. It's about challenging the mindset that women's sports are automatically less entertaining or less valuable. 

If even one person is watching TV and the WNBA comes on, and instead of instantly changing the channel, they decide to see if there's something there they might like watching, then the point has been made. Some really won't like it, but some might find it worthwhile.

Those who would have watched for Gigi might have started just because she's Kobe's child... but some might keep supporting the WNBA because they actually end up liking it."

nba,feu46uz,t1_feslieu,1579382978.0,"But that's legitimately the culture they built, though. They created a team that looks attractive to FAs. It's not just location (see: Knicks). They paid Kobe the big bucks when he was no longer a star caliber player, and their fanbase supports anyone who has ever played well for them (for example this year many lakers fans are still voting for BI in the all star game). They recruited well in the years they were bad, so they had assets to build a contender as soon as a superstar committed to them.
