If they killed someone, I think it would be because the character made it far in the game and was overwhelmed by paranoia an panic! They're punishment would probably happen like this:
Ultimate Toymaker is dropped into a giant gift box filled with plush Monokumas, who become sentient and start clawing at the Ultimate Toymaker. The gift boxes walls all fall and the Ultimate Toymaker+ monokumas spill out on the floor. The ultimate toymaker begins to make their escape and sees in the distance a childhood toy that would probably be important to them in the game,they begin to run with the Monokuma plushes chasing after them.  The gift box walls snap back up and a huge wooden wheel duck pops out, the wheel duck pursues the toymaker running over multiple Monokumas in the process. The punishment ends with the toymaker getting crushed by the wheel duck right before getting to the childhood toy which is followed by a surviving Monokuma plush placing a bow on what seems to be the now crushed wrist of the Ultimate toymaker.
Pretty neat dontcha' think!"
