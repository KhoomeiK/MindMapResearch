* the windows 10 settings pages are longer and lengthier and have no standard format (vs simple check lists with mouse over tips)
* double settings in windows 10 and legacy everywhere
* windows 10 loves to install ""new"" drivers for you and doesn't give you a choice unless you hack it or have the Pro version - why!? windows 7 let you decide
* dark patterns being employed from GWX and MS account linking - they make it sound like you need to do these things
* less QC (remember when a Windows 10 update deleted 900gb of files for some people during testing and they pushed the update live, ignoring their own forum?)
* Windows 7 start menu requires less mouse travel
* You could delay any update on Windows 10 because they trust the end user, and they didn't bundle them altogether to force you to get things
* Information density in general was prioritized

People always approach it from a ""it's new, it's free, and secure, so of course it's better!"" angle, but that misses the point. It's the experience of using it or having it shoved on them in the past that people don't like. It leaves a bad first impression, and some people come off as clueless. Of course people like free and secure things. Its' not about that.

I guarantee if Windows 8 and Windows 10 had modes that emulated them OUT OF THE BOX to a high degree, they would have been more successful (none of this third party stuff, you know your Uncle Bob who knows nothing about computers is not going to go down that rabbit hole, even if is are easy). Windows is such as a legacy product, any kind of change will met with resistance (even the Windows 95 OG start menu was met with resistance!) The only way to please everybody is to leave the old guard in it as an option instead of throwing it away and having everybody voluntarily stay behind."
