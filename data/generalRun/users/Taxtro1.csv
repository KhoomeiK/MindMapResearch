I could write an entire essay about what's wrong with that. People already bind themselves to things too much, create too much of an ""identity"" outside of their actual identity. You don't need a definition, because you are one concrete phenomenon in space-time. A living being that can be found at one time in one place, can be touched, seen, etc. Add the ""really"" and ""quick sentence"" and this becomes a truely horrible exercise. It creates nothing but pride, shame and emotional ties to things, which should be judged soberly."

Really it's just a question of ""freedom"" having a positive ring to it. Hence God's transgressions are to be justified by him supporting some sort of freedom that is entirely undetectable, while at the same time allowing for maximal oppression and bondage. The actual meaningful freedom, you can enjoy, is not supported by your God.

And that ignores the fact that you somehow have to perform the mental gymnastics that all suffering in the universe is somehow necessitates by ""free will"".

When your house is burnt down, your wife raped, your son killed, your daughter abducted, will you then speak about ""purpose"" and ""flow"" or any of those other meaningless excuses? In every second the suffering in nature surpasses your imagination. Yet you ignore it all, you spit on the victims of rape, you spit on the victims or murder, you spit on the victims or torture, you spit on the billions upon billions of animals, who have starved to death or have been eaten alive. You think their suffering is ok, because you think your life is less boring because of it? That is what religion does to you."

What is an ""argument"" in your mind, is really a response. When someone claims to follow the bible or that the bible has some sort of authority, he needs to be confronted with the problem of which version of the contents in the bible he beliefs and why it's authority or helpfulness as a guide is not lessened by the fact he himself had to pick and choose the ""correct"" version."
