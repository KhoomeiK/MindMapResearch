Here’s a tip for after your auditions: go to a school with a private teacher you like working with, and who plays in a way you want to emulate. Don’t go for the schools prestige or anything egoistic like that. This means you need to take lessons from your prospective professors beforehand. Trust me, if I hadn’t taken a lesson with Joey Tartell before I committed I would have stayed in Georgia and taken the in-state tuition instead of going to IU."

drumcorps,fedtb0a,t3_eof1up,1579019436.0,"I’m not totally against woodwinds in dci on principle, although it does make me cringe slightly. The biggest issue I have is the logistics, which seem insurmountable. Dci rehearsal and performance occurs in some of the most brutal and variable conditions, so upkeep of woodwinds would be insane. Also, you would never be able to hear them unless they only played while the brass weren’t, or they were each amplified individually. That being said, I can see a woodwind section as part of the pit, where those issues are more easily resolved, becoming a thing.

Also I don’t think this would become like high school marching band if they were allowed on the field. More like Blast, if anything. So there’s hope there."
