I loved how solidly they were all built back in the day, the heft, the quality. My 1945 delta lathe had the original engine from what I could tell, and if it ever went out.. I could just throw on a new motor. You can't do that with these new lathes.  At the same time, most older lathes can't turn wide pieces, about 6 inches was my max (and I do want to go wider.) I'm debating getting a new Laguna lathe and band saw and possibly a sawstop table saw. I loved my cast iron belt driven table saw but it scared the heck out of me. The power that thing had was incredible, the blade spun so fast it whistled. The big downside on some of these older tools is any lack of safety equipment. I recenlty broke my thumb on my jointer, and have trimmed a fingernail with the saw, so my wife likes new for the safety aspect, but I really worry about their longevity."
