And no, I have not witnessed any old men jerking off in the shop.  As stated, I have not been in the shop myself.  But yesterday I did see an old man in that mall picking his nose with furious and gleeful abandon in the food court.  He was nearly three knuckles deep, and either completely out of fucks, or so intent on mining his precious booger resource that he was oblivious to the horrified abandonment of tables around him as at least two families fled from the area in disgust. 

I was still trying to come up with the right word to describe the combination of awesome and revulsion this brazen nasal excavation embodied when he suddenly got up and left.  That was when I realized that the table he had been sitting at was now festooned all along its edge with glistening stalactites of gelatinous skegness.  I settled on ""quesijestic"" as the right word: a combination of queasy and majestic, with a hint of queso."

evolution,fff6j87,t1_ffemo5n,1579876976.0,"Okay, yes you're on the right lines here.

We do see random, unplanned variations of existing structures popping up every now and again.  Often, these variations are just allometric shifts on the scale of normal variability within a population - think Trump's freakishly tiny hands for example.  

Typically, these variations aren't enough of a detriment to hinder survival or reproduction, and the trait to tend towards that end of the spectrum is inherited by the tiny hands freak's offspring.  Over time, unless something occurs (such as natural selection, or a founding effect through a population isolation) to change the frequency of that allele in the larger population, eventually it gets swamped out and the variation returns more to the mid-line ""normal"" range of the population, maintaining an equilibrium of morphology within the species over time.

When selection does occur, it often selects against the outlying, extreme traits.  This also tends to maintain equilibrium in the population over time, and those new, novel traits are often bred out within a few generations.

But every now and again, those new traits do offer an advantage of some kind, or because a founding population has many individuals with that trait, it is over-represented in subsequent generations, and the trait becomes more common, even predominant in the population over time, and that becomes the trait that ends up becoming the midline that is preserved through equilibrium.

So it's unlikely that an entirely new or radically different structure would develop and be selected for, and end up continuing in the population, but small incremental changes do persist and through reproductive isolation from other population, that essentially how we get new species.

The evolution of the horse's hoof from the early *Eohippus* with four toes on its forefeet and three on the back to the modern form with just a single toe is a good case study in how these small variations in populations shift over time.

evolution,ffc5qrv,t1_ffbiju9,1579792161.0,"I don't think there's much evidence to support your unplanned variation origin for most structures.

In the case of vertebrate limbs, the pectoral girdle was likely a modification of existing gill arches (as is also the case of the jaws), while the pelvic girdle was a modification of the metapterygium found in cartilaginous fish and basal ray-finned fish, which supports the back fins and likely has a role in supporting intromission and reproductive structures.

None of these limb structures spring unbidden from nothing, mutating from protoplasmic stem cells into a proto-leg or proto-wing.  They are evolved through tiny inherited modifications of earlier structures.  Sometimes a novel mutation like a serial doubling of a segment might occur - resulting in multiple limbs that can then be modified (serial homology duplicating entire segments is likely an important driver in the early evolution of arthropods and annelids, and even chordates), but having a functional limb just show up out of nowhere isn't really something that can easily happen."

In captivity even the noise from the filter pumps used to keep their water clean has been so stressful to them that it has killed some animals.  Captive breeding is also difficult.  One pair was bred in 1943, and then no more successful breedings occurred until 1991.  Now there are a handful of facilities with the skill to create an environment welcoming enough that platypus can thrive and breed, but they are very rare.  There's only one facility, in San Diego that is outside Australia and has been successful at even keeping platypus alive.

There are quite a few birds, such as some ducks (eg. shovelers), spoonbills, sandpipers that target similar resources, but none have that electro-sensory ability.

In additional to their ecological singularity, their survival in Australia was aided by the dominance of marsupials in the rest of the continent.

worldbuilding,ff72ofx,t3_ery7uc,1579639913.0,"If you are looking at strictly ""plausible"" gas bag lift vehicles, remember that a hot-air balloon will need a huuuuge balloon to lift something the size of that ship.

The lifting force of a hot-air balloon depends largely on the difference in temperature between the gas bag and the surrounding air.  If the ship is up high in the sky, where it's nice and cold (say around 0 C), and the gas bag is kept nice and warm with Fire Crystals (say 100 C, hot enough to boil water), you would get about 3.5 Newtons of force for every cubic meter of hot air in the gas bag.

So for a ship with about 100 tons of mass in structure and cargo (which looks about right for that size of ship in the picture) would require about 890,000 Newtons of force to lift, and thus a gas bag of about 250,000 cubic meters (that's the size of about 44 Goodyear Blimps).

At an ambient temperature of around 20 C, you'll only get 2 Newtons of lift from each cubic meter of that gas bag, so your ship will drop to the ground unless you can get your weight down to only 56 tons, or gas bag temperature up to about 160 C.

Hydrogen would get you 11.76 Newtons per cubic meter.  So your gasbag would only need to be about 75, 700 cubic meters in size (13 Goodyear Blimps, or slightly smaller than the Royal Albert Hall), and wouldn't be as vulnerable to ambient temperature fluctuations.  It would of course be rather flammable itself, and hydrogen will leak through almost material that the gas bag could be made of short of modern polymers (most of which rely on fossil fuels)."

Canada did not, and is a constitutional monarchy with Queen Elizabeth II, the Queen of Canada as the nominal head of state.

I agree that monarchy is an outdated concept, and gets more ridiculous the closer you look at it.  As long as the royal family stays quiet and puts on a good show in Buckingham Palace, they can ride the gravy train of wealth, luxury, and no real jobs or responsibilities for the rest of their lives.  

Spotlighting the ridiculousness like Meghan and Harry are doing, as much as I understand and even applaud them for doing so, threatens to make everyone go. ""Hey, wait a minute.  Why the fuck are we still doing this in the 21st century?""

Doesn't matter where they were born, raised, or even if they speak the language, they are the royal family of Canada.

Now, to me, that means rather less than some fictional white-haired tart with a trio of dragons, but legally it currently stands that they are technically members of the royal family of Canada."

Due to the fact that Prince Edward was the father of Queen Victoria, it just happens that the British royal family and the Canadian royal family happen to be the same family.  Pretty convenient.  Considering that line of succession was chosen in 1930, it's possible they even picked it deliberately so that would be the case.

We had a program here called ""Barn Buddies"" that put ""unadoptable"" spayed/neutered feral cats in farms, or other workplaces with outdoor areas where they could thrive, but some access to shelter, food and water.  Cats that had no chance of being ""housecats"".

The one we got at our work place took about a week before she started insisted on coming inside, and then started mostly hanging out in our office, demanding pets.  Turns out she wasn't unadoptable.  She just really hated kennels and being in the shelter.  They wound up taking her back and finding her a proper home."
todayilearned,fehn6yy,t1_fehhz8y,1579119948.0,"I do wonder how much of the improvement is the ""high five"" trick itself, and how much is just the time spent socializing the cat as part of learning the trick.  Would just spending that much individual time with the cats have the same benefit and adoption boost without the specific training?

Also, presumably the cats that are already fairly friendly and socialized will be more likely to learn the trick, and those are the cats that are more likely to have been rehomed without assistance.  So is it worth putting that much time and effort for a slight increase in the chance of rehoming a cat that likely would have found another home anyhow, or is there something that can be done to increase the chances for the really shy and skittish or older cats that are less likely to be able to pick up this trick, and because of the program may be even less likely to find a new home because only the ""high five"" cats are getting adopted?

As for Canada, Canada has their own Royal Family, descending from Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (the fourth son of King George III), who lived in Canada between 1791 and 1800.
