Firstly, it's not guaranteed that they're anywhere near this vehicle. They often hang out in a cafe 3 blocks away for long periods of time. And secondly, every second counts in a fire emergency, which is why it's absolutely vital that firefighters hook the hose up ASAP.

guitarlessons,ff7yt66,t1_ff72kkz,1579661605.0,"Things get even more interesting and enlightening when you learn your chord inversions, i.e. playing the chord with notes other than the root in the bass. It's really helpful to know the notes of all of the basic major & minor chords and which chord tones those notes are. So a C major is C, E, G and you know that the E is the major 3rd and the D is the 5th. Knowing this opens up a whole world of chord possibilities on the neck. If you're up around the 7th fret and the song calls for a G major, for example, you know that you can play the inversion with the third (B) in the bass right there. Using inversions makes your playing sound 10x as interesting, it really sets apart the good players and leads to a truly thorough understanding of the neck. 

By the way, when learning and practicing chords and inversions, it's helpful to use 3 note ""shell voicings."" These are a style of chord common among jazz & big band guitarists, and they're usually voiced on the low E, D and G strings (muting the A). I might do a lesson showing the 3 inversions each of major and minor in the shell voicings. They really help you learn the note names of the chords and they also sound fantastic when you play them with a bit of crunch."

guitarlessons,ff6443x,t3_errglo,1579618646.0,"Yeah the good thing about the guitar neck in standard tuning is that once you appreciate its little ""quirk"" (i.e. there's a 4th between all the strings except the G and the B, which is a major 3rd), it's actually very easy to start seeing all of your music theory on it in the form of patterns and shapes. And being able to see all the intervals around any random root note is \*extremely\* important (perhaps one of the most important things you can learn on the guitar) because when you're comfortable with this, you can construct chords and scales on the spot, wherever you are on the neck, without having to necessarily learn a bunch of chord shapes by heart. 

Of course, the precursor to this is learning all of the note names on the neck, so you can at least name and find your root notes. This is also incredibly useful, and worth doing on EVERY string. Most people only learn the notes on the E and the A strings, but if you want complete neck freedom, you have to know your root notes everywhere). 

Also, don't fall into the trap of just learning intervals *above* roots notes. Learn how to see intervals *below* them as well. This is equally as useful. 

There are two main disadvantages with learning the guitar fretboard in terms of shapes, however:

1) It doesn't help when you have to communicate with other musicians who want to talk in terms of note names

2) When you use a different guitar tuning, all of the shapes and patterns are different

With this in mind, consider that it's actually very useful to learn *both* ways. Learn your guitar-specific patterns, but also take some time to learn the note spellings of your basic major and minor triads. It's not much of a big deal - you have 24 chords in total, and once you've learned them all, you'll instantly know your 3rds and 5ths from any note, expressed in note names. Also, learn the *cycle of fifths* by heart (really easy), because then you'll instantly know your fifths in terms of note names, and this is really useful."

aww,ff047mg,t1_ff00kfh,1579465014.0,That's only 47% true
aww,ff042k0,t1_fezof3a,1579464960.0,The road traffic fatality rate in Thailand is 3x higher than that of the US and TEN TIMES that of the UK. I guess nobody really does care!
aww,ff03xvh,t1_ff01thi,1579464910.0,"Yeah, and the road death rate in Thailand is 3 times higher than the US. Making the connection yet?"
aww,ff03acf,t1_fezi1g0,1579464754.0,"And according to WHO statistics, road accident fatalities in those countries are many times higher than they are here. It's not really about being a great motorcycle driver, it's what happens when he has to react to other things on the road. Truck drivers in these parts of the world, for example, tend to be pretty reckless and gung-ho, and people on motorcycles and scooters are being killed by them all the time."
aww,ff030fb,t3_eqvd88,1579464650.0,So fucking dangerous for the dogs. The chance of one of them falling off and being hit by a passing truck is very high. I wouldn't be surprised if one or more of them has already met that demise by now.
audioengineering,ff01vzl,t3_er0gaf,1579464332.0,"I would honestly just experiment. It all depends on the guitar, the mics, the amp, and what's required for the mix (do you need a stereo recording? Does the guitar need to keep out of the way of other instruments?). I don't mic cabs up, I use amp sims like Amplitube, and I experiment endlessly with the miking positions and the mics."
starterpacks,ff017gs,t3_eqvefs,1579464043.0,"Rule 6 is a bitch. I fail to see how this is outside the definition of a starter pack. I guess they should have cropped out the relevant parts of the drawing and presented them as separate images? Meanwhile, I see starter packs that break rule 8 (no lists or example packs) all the time without being removed."
aww,feztgil,t3_equk9l,1579461438.0,Does anyone else keep thinking there's an axe in front of that cat whenever they see this meme? I like to think he's stretching on his way home from a hard day of axing.
