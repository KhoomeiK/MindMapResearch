goats,ffpl1cf,t3_eugnoh,1580097649.0,"Is he weathered?  Wethers are more manageable for the most part in comparison to an intact male.  Goats are pack animals and do better and are happier at least in pairs of their own kind. You may want to get at least one more but I get wanting your horse a buddy. Goats are pretty easy to care for. A little good grain once a day and good hay, treats much like your horse. Keep up with hoof trimming. First and foremost, most flowering bushes and some non flowering like box woods are poisonous so be very careful with that since they are so curious. You can google for a list. I learned this the hard way years ago when 4 of mine got out and into boxwoods and azaleas. I lost 2 and the other 2 barely pulled though and they wouldn’t have if it weren’t for my vet. Good luck!  Any questions lmk I’ve been raising dwarfs and fainters for pets for 20 years."

DontFundMe,ffpb0wv,t3_euf3p8,1580090584.0,I just don’t know. The dog has a rabies tag it looks like. Also a nice harness. I hope it’s legit. It disturbs me how dishonest people are when I see it on social media. Sometimes you just don’t know what to believe.
HayDay,ffoub99,t3_eud6xl,1580081940.0,When I started I watched a lot of YouTube for tips. I sold a lot of apples and blackberries. Blackberries are 838 for 10 and apples are the fastest fruit makers of all trees.
BackYardChickens,ffnwqjk,t3_euajiw,1580071744.0,So sweet. Looks like a roo from here but check the rear end.
goats,ffnw5u0,t1_ffnrz10,1580071505.0,Gotcha!  Lol!  I bet she’s minty fresh!
FundieSnark,ffnm2c6,t3_eu8o4w,1580067690.0,Wonder how long he has to wait fir all the ladies to put their face on before they can leave for church or they must have to get up at like 4 in the morning lol!
goats,ffnilqi,t1_ffne6p5,1580066405.0,Oh good!  I was thinking mint or catnip but I didn’t know because I didn’t know they flowered. Years ago I had 4 goats get out and got into a box wood and an azalea. I tried for a week but lost 2 and 2 pulled through. That was before I knew. I sure wouldn’t want anybody to go what I went through!  She’s a cutie!
FundieSnark,ffmr2uz,t1_ffhk0jl,1580058013.0,Oh it was stuff about body parts (let me see your...) and bashing and cut downs and ‘what the hell has God done for you’ etc etc. I mean they did a good job carrying on like it wasn’t happening but you could tell they were seeing it by their eyes and the expression on their faces. Like when one was talking the others eyes were popping out lol.
youseeingthisshit,ffmad4o,t1_fflzj8h,1580051353.0,"Yes, my 78 yr old mother did this a year ago. Untreated uti turned into sepsis. She didn’t tell us she wasn’t feeling well and used her normal excuse of ‘it’ll go away be itself’, ‘I’ll feel better tomorrow’ etc etc. Got to the point she didn’t even know my dad or brother but she knew me. Didn’t know where she was. It was awful. I really thought that was it for her. Ambulance ride and 2 weeks in the hospital. She’s good today. Sepsis is no joke."
goats,fflxmcr,t3_eu1mkx,1580045472.0,"What is that plants name, do you know?  There’s so many flowering bushes (and also some non flowering bushes like boxwood) that are poisonous to goats and sheep. You can google for a list."
FundieSnark,ffk18kb,t3_etypvc,1580012709.0,My first thought is Cruella Deville!
Dolls,ffk16rw,t3_etzyyr,1580012665.0,My 7 yr old niece collects (along with hotwheels- daddy lol) them. I buy them for her all the time. I know she’s probably got 50. They are so adorable!
