>Computer and developer-board maker Pine64 has started shipping the first edition of its much-anticipated – at least in the open-source community – PinePhone, after pre-orders sold out. Dubbed ""Brave Heart"", the device is indeed designed only for the keener hobbyists. 

>Shipping at only $149.99, Brave Heart is a fully open-source smartphone running Linux, which the company claims was developed ""with the community for the community"", which means with developers and early adopters, and for developers and early adopters; and in this case, preferably for those who have extensive Linux experience.

>In a departure from Android and iOS, Pine's new project provides a platform for customers to develop Linux-on-phone projects. It does not come with a pre-installed OS, but supports all major Linux phone projects such as Ubuntu Touch, Sailfish OS and Plasma Mobile.

>Although buyers get to choose their OS, therefore, it will be up to them to upload the platform to the Pine Phone – meaning the device is not designed for the average Joe.
""The ""BraveHeart"" Edition PinePhone does not come with default OS build installed, user needs to install their owns favorite build. Most of the OS builds are still in beta stage,"" it notes: ""Only intend for these units to find their way into the hands of users with extensive Linux experience and an interest in Linux-on-phone.""

>The company has been selling single-board computers and notebook computers, initially to compete with Raspberry Pi, since 2016. The devices are designed for developers who are interested in free and open-source software (FOSS) to work on applications. ""Regardless of if you want to sequence DNA, build a robot or kill space invaders, wev've got you covered,"" says Pine64 on its website.

>Powered by the same signature quad-core ARM64 found in Pine's A64 single board computers, the new phone's specs are promising. Brave Heart has 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, a 5MP rear camera and a 2MP front one. There is also a headphone jack, a USB-C port and a Micro-SD slot.

>Keeping in line with the company's objectives, Pine64 also included strong privacy settings in the new device. Under the removable back, for example, are six dip switches that let users kill the modem, GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, microphone and cameras. 

>The device sets itself against Purism's Librem 5 smartphone, which started shipping last year albeit at the much higher price of $749. Contrary to Pine64's technology, Librem 5 comes with Pure OS and Ubuntu Touch; but it includes similar security features such as hardware kill switches for the camera, mic, WiFi, Bluetooth and modem. 

>Pine64 has called the Brave Heart device a ""milestone"" for the company and the phone has certainly generated a lot of enthusiasm among developers. Although the early version of the Pine Phone is only shipping to the select few, the company says a consumer-ready version will be available from Spring 2020. 

>The manufacturer is also working on an open-source Linux tablet with a detachable keyboard, as well as on a smartwatch, so watch this space for more."

The reasoning is simple. Psychopath is a very broad term. Typically this has come to be equated with ASPD which is an anti social personality disorder.

It's NOT required that someone with ASPD has a completely broken sense of empathy. There are however people who would be classified as having ASPD that have ZERO empathy and lack understanding of empathy in general. 

In the second case, those people will not suffer PTSD as they don't typically process trauma the same most people let alone most people with ASPD.

There's also a burning one that's similar. It's a ridiculous amount of burning damage. 10k/s easy. 

My Jug is the only one that eats these and doesn't instantly die so I know I wasn't truly ""instakilled"" but the damage output is pretty insane against a max capped Jug with 8-9 endurance charges and insane regen. 

He still dies, but.. not instantly. That damage output is too high if it's murdering a jugg like that. It may as well be a 1 shot skill."

Until he does a Chaos Degen AOE around him for 5k+ hp/second at MAX chaos res. 

I've survived it on my jugg but I figure most players see that as a ""1 shot"" because the damage output is so high. 

I've seen burning damage equally high."

Nicotine is helpful in noise gating in the brain and a common reason people with schizophrenia and similar disorders smoke."
AskReddit,fcisq7g,t3_eh8gs2,1577668909.0,"There's an entire subsection of medical literature in psychology dedicated to psychological issues surrounding smoking weed that gets ignored.

People who smoke at a young age are more likely to develop schizophrenia for example. That's over a pretty large sample and multiple studies now. 

Best brain development evidence says you probably shouldn't be smoking until you're in your early 20's. 21 is a fairly appropriate legal age. 

This is an unpopular opinion because the counter point is based in anecdote which a lot of people share such as ""Well I smoked since I was 14 and I'm fine"". That's not a scientific place to base an opinion."

Futurology,fc7e8hp,t1_fc0aymy,1577504817.0,"> LIDAR can't read signs though. It's only a depth map. That's Tesla's whole reason for bypassing LIDAR. If you have to build a vision system to make up for the few shortcomings LIDAR has, you're already most of the way to self-driving with cameras only anyways. You're better off just going for a camera-only approach from the start.

That's completely true. Eventually they gave in to having Radar sensors however. 

Camera only is cool but teaching something to use the data is a lot harder for depth perception than RADAR/LIDAR."
Futurology,fc07z0v,t1_fbzyiz1,1577282366.0,"> It’s nice to know that a car capable of self-driving can identify red and green traffic lights.

Red and Green traffic lights are completely different than what it's been learning.

It's been stuck learning tons of objects moving around in vector space and when that's ""Good"" or ""Bad"" and how to move and react to all of those things. 

None of those things look like traffic lights however. In fact, they're quite different. Traffic lights are just static objects like road signs. The car doesn't pay mind to them. It has had thousand of years (in it's mind) of learning that never involved traffic lights.

You can see all of this in demos of debug mode inside a Tesla.

Driving on a highway is pretty trivial compared to a lot of other obstacle avoidance that you have to do in the sub-second time frame on a street when you only have the sensor suite they're using. They don't have advanced LIDAR like Waamo for example."
