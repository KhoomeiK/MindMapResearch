fatlogic,ffubpky,t1_ffu1jes,1580238613.0,"If I misunderstood u/hedge-mustard's comment, my bad. I took it to mean that comfort eating when you're sad is an effective way of dealing with grief. I'm guilty of it myself, so I'm not judging anyone, but I personally try to avoid it and am always frustrated whenever I look back and see pounds that I gained comforting myself in this way. That's all i was saying."

loseit,ffgq7tc,t3_et78o3,1579912274.0,"Another one is that you can be “full” as in having your hunger sated, without being “full” as in so full of food that you literally cannot eat more. Just changing the point at which I stop eating made a huge difference in helping me manage my calorie intake."
intermittentfasting,fff9a7w,t1_fff7qmg,1579878879.0,"Thanks dude. I’m about 6’ tall and 35, so looking around, I’m already on the “fit” side of the 35 year-old-dad spectrum at 208. That said, your progress is amazing, and I hope to copy."
intermittentfasting,fff4xuu,t1_fff2yni,1579875806.0,"Dude, this is so good to read. I was up at 290+ and am down to 208. Goal is to head to the 180’s this year. Don’t care about visible abs, but would like to lose the gut all the way. Motivational!"
intermittentfasting,ffd3otw,t1_ffcj6od,1579812805.0,"For sure! It's all about consistency. If you're keeping to the diet, you're paying down your debt in the ""Calorie Bank,"" if you're overeating on a given day, you're just borrowing more money from the Calorie Bank. It's an interest free loan thankfully, but when you get used to borrowing something every day, rather than putting yourself on a payment plan, it's easy for that debt to balloon up on you. Good luck going forward, you've made tremendous progress already!"
intermittentfasting,ffc9668,t3_esn518,1579794393.0,"Really great progress! It’s so important to recognize incremental improvements, so good job husband for encouraging you to brag and get that positive feedback! For me, it allows me to get back on the wagon when I fall off, rather than waiting until I get back to my starting weight. 

I started at 293 officially (I was prob over 300, but never stepped on a scale) about 15 years ago. Prior to last year, my all time adult low was 229, and I had gone back as high as the 270’s. At the beginning of 2018, I was 240ish. Last summer I got as low as 194. I have mostly maintained but stopped at 194 due to loose skin concerns. I decided to maintain between 200-210 until January 2019, which I did mostly effectively. (Was 205 in early December before a death in the family that had me eating my feelings.)

Although I got up to 220 between Christmas and New Years, I was able to get “back on the wagon.” This AM, I was 209.5 and trending down. 

My numbers have been all over the map, but even at 220, which was classic depressed binge eating me, I was still down 73 lbs from my high. The first time I got to 220, I was ecstatic and looking at myself in the mirror non-stop. It was important for me to remember that and to remember why I was happy with what I’d achieved already. It was also encouraging to get back to work and achieve the other goals I’ve set for myself.

You got this!"

justneckbeardthings,ff1j856,t1_ff0naw2,1579480071.0,I’m not sure he could be more roasted than this comment thread has already accomplished.
fatlogic,fegytwi,t1_fedxpfv,1579105557.0,"Your first comment is exactly what people who talk this way are trying to suggest. The implication is always that some people are naturally fat, and therefore can’t help it. It’s about accountability. If it’s natural that some people are fat and some people are thin, fat people can’t be blamed for choices/eating that cause them to be overweight."

financialindependence,fedwaoi,t1_fedsgcw,1579021241.0,"Thanks. Walking is something that you can make a part of your daily routine and keep even after you stop dieting as strictly. It took my a long time to wrap my head around the idea that my version of a “normal” diet wasn’t going to allow me to lose weight and maintain it. I had gone on extreme diets and lost weight in the past, but I looked at dieting as a finite thing that I could “finish.” The reality is I was overweight because of the way I was eating, and if I returned to eating the way I had in the past, I would gain weight again. The theory behind intermittent fasting led me to my current schedule, which has been relatively easy to maintain with my office job. 

**I’m sedentary unless I exercise intentionally, so I don’t need as many calories as others to be a healthy adult.** 

It took me so long to come to terms with that, but now that I have, I no longer have nearly as much trouble eating appropriately for my age/activity level. It’s not “unfair” that I have to eat less than others to be the same size, it’s my lifestyle and what my body actually needs. I think if more people stopped comparing themselves to others and what others eat, they’d have an easier time coming to understand what’s appropriate for themselves. Sorry for sidetracking the thread, but exercise, diet, weight loss, and long term health have been a huge focus of mine for a little over a year, so I get excited when there’s a chance to discuss without me forcing it into a convo."
intermittentfasting,fedhhui,t3_eok64z,1579011648.0,Incredible gains. Congrats on your progress.
financialindependence,fedhe1c,t1_fed5sah,1579011570.0,"I eat breakfast, skip lunch, and eat a reasonable dinner most days. I also started walking at least 10k steps per day a little over a year ago. I went from about 240 down to 194 in 5-6 months and maintained in the 190s. Walking is a great backstop for calories, even if you eat a bit too much on a given day the walking burns some of the excess off. On days where you’re faithful to the diet, you lose more quickly than diet alone. It’s free to eat less and walk around outside, so no expensive meal plans or gym memberships. Had a physical last fall and was the healthiest I’ve ever been numbers-wise. The hardest part is not going back to what you think of as “normal” eating once you lose the weight. At least, that’s the hardest part for me."
fatlogic,fe8m7rf,t1_fe3rnzu,1578927827.0,"Part of it is that they’ve convinced themselves that the world had internalized “weight bias,” even within the scientific and medical communities. If you accept that predicate, then you can logically justify that you need to search out the “true” evidence that is being conducted by those without the societal fatphobia blinders on. Once you find such evidence, you can comfort yourself with the supposed knowledge that you don’t actually have to change how you live and eat, because really, it’s just discrimination against you, not that you’re actually living irresponsibly."
