Venezia is called venicia because i misspelled it (human error)

I felt San Marino was too small to include and that just the marker for the capital would cover the entire country. All though it might have been a mistake not including it.

Also thanks for all the tips 👍"

imaginarymaps,fekhbnb,t3_epnhoz,1579200044.0,"Thank god im finally finished 

Lore:

In this timeline Italy failed to unify. Sardinia Piedmont manages to stay with its territory for most of the century, avoiding any french invasions with its small alliances. Venice and Lombardy (Former Austrian territories in the region) managed to break away from Austria as hate for austria grew. Tuscany with the collapse of Austrian control in venice and Lombardy invaded the former austrian sphere members of modena, parma and Lucca and formed the Republic of Central Italy. The alliance between the Papacy and France broke down and The Kingdom of Napoli (formerly known as the Two Sicilies) decided to invade the Papacy with the Newly formed Republic of Central Italy. 

The lines which get interrupted at even intervals are borders between substates and/or puppets. For example the ones in the R.O.P are substate borders and the one between Austria and Bosnia is a puppet border"
