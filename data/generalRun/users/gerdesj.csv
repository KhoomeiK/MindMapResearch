Let's pitch Arthur as living around 600-700 AD as a good, honest British defender of these isles against those nasty old Saxons, Angles and Jutes who came over after those nice, civilising Roman types had buggered off.

Obviously, he was Welsh (which Welsh kingdom he might have run is left as an exercise to the reader) or perhaps from Cornwall or Devon - both were also British, or as I like to say: Welsh.  Cornwall is after all: West Wales.  

Oh hang on!  The whole place was Britons until the Saxons, Jutes, Angles, Vikings (bit later, not just Danes, complicated), oh and the Picts were farting around up north.  That's except for the bits that were not like that.

""On foot gallop"" seems a pretty concise translation.  ""Galloping on foot"" is more Anglic but perhaps ""On foot, they galloped"" or ""They galloped on feet"".  Those last two work quite nicely because it is quite hard to gallop without feet! (geddit, lol, etc).  Those two options can also be made to riff on ""on foot"" or ""on feet"", which have subtly different meanings.  ""Feat. galloping"" is a bit odd but adds a synonym joke and is quite edgy.

Dogs are pack animals and will follow the pack leader.  They are very versatile, that's why they are still here.  We (humans) are not too forgiving of species that do not conform.  My and the wife used to have a Collie and a Lab and both learnt to ""smile"" in a way that they meant ""I'm a pack animal and am conforming and doing what you do, because you are big dog"".  We did not ever attempt to make them do that.  They did it themselves because they saw that as pack behaviour.

* Wales has been in use for quite a few years in quite a few places (OK UK only) as a unit of measure to the point that el Reg has taken it on as a standard.
