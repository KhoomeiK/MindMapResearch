The cold never bothers me, but when it doesn't snow in winter, everything just looks grey anfld dull. With snow, all the buildings and mountains look beautiful and totally different from the summer view. We love to go hiking in winter, you won't get too hot and sweaty and there are no bugs or mosquitos like in summer. And the dog is always very clean after playing in snow, it's like a bath for her."
