Give them an inch they'll take a mile."
corgi,ff1iawb,t3_equjwy,1579479660.0,"They are so much fun and perfect for those who want the big dog love, but live in a small area.   
Can run, play and rough house with them like big dogs, but they don't mind chilling inside an apartment between walks."

Hahaha... Silly human can't catch a mouse."
corgi,fev69fz,t1_fetey16,1579393546.0,Where do you live? I treat my dog like my child sometimes even baby talk it. Never get any issues.
corgi,fetaa98,t1_fet9wgz,1579373263.0,Corgi shame? It's a cute kind of dog what's shameful about it?
corgi,fet4w1x,t3_eqg5k9,1579371806.0,"As a corgi owner I can tell you women in general seem to love corgis on average. To be fair I've seen guys do it too, women just seem to be more open about it. 

Something about that grin with the ears."

iamatotalpieceofshit,feci6eb,t1_fdmltvf,1578974506.0,"There is a man without residence with a dog in my town. He has fought off mean dogs (with owners) for that dog. He gives the dog half of all discovered and earned food. His only issue seems to be the dog will follow his bike over him. Probably from training. 

I have a dog and my first. Once I risked my fingers prying open another dog's mouth so he can escape. It would have ended my career and put me on the streets. But I did it anyway with all of this running in my mind. I learned how much I love him and that he has power over me.

I don't consider myself poor, but with my wife being unable to work and we can't afford to get her on disability it's a struggle. Through out Harrison (our dog) stands by loyally and healthily, with love and as fierce protection as he can give. (he's a corgi) 

Dogs seem to care more about experiencing the opportunities that present themselves. Such as 

""We are near the park, let's go to park. McDonald's is near by let's eat. You're home let's play."" 

They seem to understand when you are struggling or sick and change accordingly. 

Harrison normally gets outside 4+ times a day and it was reduced to two because I was so sick I had to brace myself on walls to give him those walks. He stopped running ahead of me. Kept looking up and stood near me. Then for the last 3 days refused to leave my side.

They are truly family and as family they are with us for the best and worse. People need to understand this when judging others.

Sorry for the long reply. It's just something I've learned over the past year. Wanted to share."
facepalm,fcz030y,t3_ejkpk4,1578090911.0,That assassination was more of an excuse for war than the cause of it from what I've read.
corgi,fctjz4x,t3_eik8ie,1577945980.0,Harrison will climb up on the back rest ever since the Cat taught him and now God isn't safe anywhere.
ChoosingBeggars,fbyp8dk,t1_fbx42ph,1577222718.0,"I don't understand paying for a premium ""like"". Am I missing something?"
