chevyspark,ffmbj0w,t3_eu6syd,1580051877.0,"Had the same synchro issue in my 14. Make sure to put it into first as your coming to a stop so it slides into gear. If it doesn't immediately go into reverse, move a inch foward in first then go back to reverse.

Once you learn to treat the box like that you'll have no problem.

Edit: as far as 4th, the only issue I ever had was slightly undershooting it cause I hit the armrest (before i removed it). If you having trouble going to 4th while rolling you may want to consider having the synchros replaced or having the transmission warrantied. That is of course, provided your in the correct engine/wheelspeed range for 4th, which would be over 40 mph.

Double edit: if it's not a gear meshing issue and more of a *there's a thing blocking my shifter entering the gate*, pull the boot off and see if the plastic little shifter bushing is in once piece. If you are more a ...heavy handed...the plastic bushing may be broken, preventing proper insertion."

chevyspark,ff5x6v1,t3_erpa5l,1579613230.0,"Maybe I'm misunderstanding how you're describing it, but it's perfectly normal for a **1.2** liter engine to push some decent RPM when accelerating. Granted, mine was a manual, but I always put it up to 4-5k through the lower gears when accelerating. It's better for the engine to rev out in lower gears than to try to push lower RPM in the higher gears."
