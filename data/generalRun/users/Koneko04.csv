I suggest ""matching"" his Christmas money with a $50 contribution to the Animal Humane Society or a local shelter in his name.  Tell him how proud you are of this thoughtfulness and kindness and hope he will like contributing to other needy dogs as well.

(FWIW your tale brought tears to my eyes because it is so sweet and reminds me of my son who was equally as loving and giving and has grown into an excellent caring man.)"

JUSTNOMIL,fczwlce,t3_ej7i7l,1578109857.0,"In response to your flair, I do think you are over-reacting a bit to be honest. In my opinion you do not need to cut her off or go no contact, however giving up the expectation that she will act motherly to you can gain you some distance so she does not push your buttons.

She might have given away the hat which was to be gifted to you with malicious intent or maybe she is just a dingbat with a short attention span.  In either case it was an asshole move but how much energy do you want to spend on being angry?

I suggest you consider the following: She is not your mother so you do not ""owe"" her mothers' day greetings. She is not your mother so figure that she will not give you Christmas gifts â€” then if something arrives from her, it will be a nice surprise.  She is not your mother so let your husband own figuring out budgeting for, shopping for and shipping presents to her.  Let him know that this is stressful for you so you are dropping the rope in terms of assuming responsibility for all this."

Joseph and pregnant Mary were sent to the stable to sleep that night because the inn was full.  It may not have been a separate building because the family might have sheltered their livestock in a segregated part of their building.

JustNoSO,fc0ycoc,t1_fbzy87r,1577303015.0,"> Do not shop for his family. They are his responsibility, drop the rope

Damn straight.  For many male partners, shopping is ""women's work"" and they think that it will miraculously happen.  Case in point: my ex.

I shopped (and wrapped, a hours' long chore tbh) gifts for my parents, him, our children, my siblings and their children. His side of the family, some of his sibs decided on a present for his parents and ""billed"" everyone; there was also a random gift draw so each sibling got someone else. Each sib provided an explicit gift list too. He literally had to write a check and buy one present.  Result: panic on the 23rd when he finally glommed onto the thought that he had not bought anything for his sib (not to mention me or the kids) which led to whining about what to get, where to go, blah blah blah. Then it was pathetic ""I don't know how to wrap presents"" to which I meanly responded, ""You're 30-odd years old, don't you think it's time to learn?""  Argh. What a useless tool."
