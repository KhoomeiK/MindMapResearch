news,fenm0i9,t1_fenl5yp,1579287557.0,">how does that mean that we should change the currently valid legal interpretation of a term of something that was enacted while there were people who understood the valid legal meaning of that term and voted for it on that basis?

Please indicate where in my comments I said that we should do this? 

I am criticizing the language of the referendum, which has led us to a situation where a significant number of voters now *feel* that their vote is being subverted by a court after the fact. 

It was an avoidable misstep that has diminished public faith in the referendum system. I'm *not* saying the Supreme Court should have ruled the other way."

> This amendment restores the voting rights of Floridians with felony convictions after they complete all terms of their sentence including parole or probation. The amendment would not apply to those convicted of murder or sexual offenses, who would continue to be permanently barred from voting unless the Governor and Cabinet vote to restore their voting rights on a case by case basis.

My point is that the average person probably doesn't understand that ""all the terms of their sentence"" includes fines and fees. The fact that the *lawyer* who wrote the thing believed it was clear doesn't seem super relevant to me."
news,fenc6r7,t1_fen39qf,1579281554.0,"100% this. I can guarantee the vast majority of people don't think of ""fines and miscellaneous fees"" as part of a sentence. They just think of jail and prison time.

This should have been on the original ballot question, not buried in legal BS and court wrangling"
boardgames,fejvhx4,t1_fejsqiu,1579186801.0,"In my experience people have over-valued the cards a bit in Viticulture. If you focus on getting tons of cards you're just gonna end up throwing a bunch of them away to hand size, which is pretty inefficient. And if other players are also drawing lots of cards, there will be a bottleneck on the action spaces where you play them"

Iran wants nuclear weapons for deterrence and leverage, same as any other country.

That's just propaganda for stupid people who want to believe Iran's entire government is being run by suicide bombers."

Destabilizing Iran would most likely lead to a violent civil war that spreads out across the Middle East, benefiting groups like ISIS that fill the power vacuum. What it will **NOT** do is lead to a more democratic, pro-Western government in Iran. 

You know what *was* a massive policy win for moderates in Iran? The nuclear deal that Trump threw in the trash. Every aspect of Trump's foreign policy is emboldening the extremists in Iran and reinforcing the narrative that they are at war with the US."
