I ended up selling mine because I needed the cash to buy a 200$ fuel pump for my ex-wife's car. SMH..."

worldnews,fep3do8,t1_fep1ws2,1579311229.0,"This is true and it makes sense because America's initial stance on both World Wars was of neutrality. So it makes sense that we didn't have the numbers that Europe and Russia had. Also, I took a history class in college last year (American) and our professor printed out that Russia was largely responsible for defeating the Germans especially after Germany invaded parts of it (USSR) before being spearheaded at the Battle of Stalingrad. Our greatest accomplishment was coming up with the atom bomb and dropping it on Japan (x2) to stop them from continuing the fight. 

I agree, many Americans don't know this and yes it is the education system."
