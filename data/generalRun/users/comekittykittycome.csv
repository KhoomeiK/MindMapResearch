AskReddit,ffmyq77,t3_eu6iol,1580060222.0,"So one day I wanted to explain my granny computers and the internets. As you can guess by my name, I like cats. A lot. So I thought, hitting the German word for cats into the searching machine will show us a bunch of cute fluff balls. I didn't care that her starting page were yahoo and not google. I'm pretty sure on Google would've been those little cats with their cute whiskers. But on yahoo we got a full face on two naked ladys with cat ears, doing their not really cattish behavior. Thanks yahoo."

Edit: to clarify, we needed to shave her hip as well and I tell you, its literally the same hair style we did to her. That's so crazy!"

AskReddit,ffcn59l,t1_ffboqd1,1579802994.0,"Prepare. We all wish you and your mom the best. But please, record her voice, make videos of here. I finally can't remember her voice and it shatters me. Just do it and when she's going to be okay, you'll still be happy having the records and videos and you can watch it together <3"
AskReddit,ffcmvg8,t3_esps5n,1579802828.0,Becoming an illness. Mom and granny died of cancer and I'm pretty sure I'll get similar tbh. I have an ED since yeaaaars now and due to depression I don't do sports anymore. I literally know how to treat my body good but I don't do it.
