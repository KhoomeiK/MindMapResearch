dankmemes,ffgn9pp,t1_ffgkq63,1579910202.0,I literally didn't do shit except downvote your racist remarks towards that other guy. Maybe try anger management.
dankmemes,ffgki73,t1_ffgjo6q,1579908328.0,"Cause he's got some issues, man."
AmItheAsshole,fffgzsc,t3_et5qoq,1579883757.0,"NAH - your body, your choice. But I can totally understand that your brother is hurt over this. You don't mind strangers you have never met raising your biological children as long as they pay you well for your eggs but aren't willing to let your brother have the happiness of raising a child he is related to. And that your brother's offer to pay you is something that seems to be something that might sway you is kinda iffy. Is it is an emotional issue for you then why does getting paid matter this much? Like I said, your choice, but damn does that suck for your brother. 
Also, no her brother is obviously not entitled to her eggs. Duh. This is not a sub about legality though, but about what would be the morally good thing to do."
AmItheAsshole,ffffn7a,t3_et7atk,1579882922.0,NTA - she was manipulating you. Good riddance.
AmItheAsshole,fffepip,t3_estcud,1579882337.0,"YTA - it sounds like you are talking about someone else's baby that you are helping to take care of out of the kindness of your heart and are getting frustrated. Dude, is this not YOUR child as well? You are not being a hero here helping your wife (stepping up your game as you called it), but just acting like any decent father should. Your poor wife. Get over yourself, you are not a child."
AmItheAsshole,ffevi68,t1_ffea6hu,1579867311.0,Thank you. This story makes no sense.
AmItheAsshole,ffevgc3,t3_et07oe,1579867253.0,"As a jew: This sounds made up. No jew would complain about halal slaughter being cruel as we do it in a very very similar fashion. And she is supposed to be conservative? Eh, doubt it. It sounds like you don't keep your kitchen kosher so she wouldn't be able to eat anything. What difference would it make if it was halal? None of this makes sense."
AmItheAsshole,ffdlxp4,t1_ffdl2j7,1579823682.0,"Completely agree, but ESH might be more appropriate in this case then, no?"
AmItheAsshole,ffdliis,t3_esz49b,1579823427.0,"INFO: step 1: ignoring it
Step 2: firing him

Wasn't there any space in between to just sit down and have a serious talk about his behaviour first?"
AmItheAsshole,ffdkmd6,t3_esy02s,1579822875.0,NTA - why isn't your husband supporting you and taking your business seriously? I'm mad.
AmItheAsshole,ffdk0rn,t3_eshf6s,1579822513.0,INFO: A PlayStation and a new guitar seems like a lot to spend on gifts for a 13 year old. Why didn't you and your ex wife just get him the guitar together and split the price? Wouldn't that be enough for one birthday?
AmItheAsshole,ffdjnt4,t1_ffa679b,1579822292.0,"Well, it is kind of an asshole move to tell him he can't buy his son a special gift that they can bond over with his own money because she'd rather have him spend the money on vacationing with her."
AmItheAsshole,ffdi5b9,t1_ffcrq58,1579821364.0,"I would rather step on a rusty nail than to sitz on the toilet seats at my uni directly. Let me rephrase that: I'd rather step on a rusty nail than to bring my genitalia into the proximity of piss, blood and shit."
AmItheAsshole,ffdg3t2,t3_essrci,1579820148.0,"You want to exclude your cousin from the wedding because you can't force her to wear a wig or dye her hair (which might stain even if it says it washes out, especially on lighter hair) just because she has natural ginger hair? Stop making her miserable over her natural hair colour. 

Concerning your edit: Congraz bridezilla you bullied her out of your wedding."
ChoosingBeggars,ffdeg97,t1_ffd80om,1579819156.0,"Why is it bad to say ""if you have anything else you wanna get rid off I'll take it, too. Just in case.""  Have you been kicked out before, living in a tiny apartment not being able to afford any furniture? Obviously asking you to drop it off is ridiculous but I feel like saying she'll be happy to take whatever is fine. We don't know what others have going on in their life."
