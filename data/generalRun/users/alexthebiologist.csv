medizzy,fgrwt6o,t1_fgqv9rr,1581060632.0,"Wait hold on, fecal matter on r/popping?"
MurderedByWords,fgrlcaj,t1_fgr0be5,1581049803.0,"Well yes, they should** but those 20 year olds get something out of being with younger girls (a power trip, easy sex, etc) that makes it worthwhile to them. I’m just saying you can’t blame teenage girls for not being interested in the average teenage boy (I know I sure wasn’t!)"
MurderedByWords,fgqm1cr,t1_fgqky6c,1581026780.0,"Oh I’m an adult now. I’m not supporting the phenomenon, just saying it makes sense why."
MurderedByWords,fgqj3cx,t1_fgqa0ip,1581025170.0,"I mean I get why it happens, being a high school girl trying to date can feel more like babysitting than a relationship."
GetMotivated,fgnn03z,t1_fgnc3qo,1580948408.0,Drives me crazy when people do that. ‘Sorry I let you down and was a shitty friend but #selfcare amirite?’
WhitePeopleTwitter,fgnm6js,t1_fgnfqk7,1580947862.0,"I asked the farmer I worked for if I could take a bucket of raw milk home to try and make homemade milk soap. He said no, he could get in huuuge legal trouble for it..and that was milk that wasn’t even going to be consumed! It really is a bit extreme."
AskReddit,fgkcm9n,t1_fgkcd5a,1580862450.0,"100%, I need a minimum of 2-3 days after he smokes before I’ll even look at it now"
AskReddit,fgkbxah,t1_fgjtkfh,1580861992.0,Sweat and sex fluids too! (Edit to clarify I don’t lick their pits lol..but the smell changes so seems reasonable)
AskReddit,fgkavtz,t1_fgjtpgt,1580861311.0,"I don’t think that was too controlling at all. You aren’t telling him what he can and can’t do, just what you will accept. Good for you for laying that out at the very beginning!"
AskReddit,fgkaoby,t1_fgjlid8,1580861176.0,"I’m the same, the habit is the main deal breaker. I’ve dated someone who smoked cigars occasionally, I just wouldn’t kiss him until he showered/teeth brushed and then wouldn’t have sex for a couple days after."
MurderedByWords,fgi6zke,t1_fghyys6,1580808830.0,And then they wonder why their entire workforce is sick and working at like 30%
MurderedByWords,fgi6r8t,t1_fghf88t,1580808466.0,You better believe it. I’ve worked a shift where I was so feverish I couldn’t stop shaking and kept spilling drinks. They still wouldn’t let me leave.
IdiotsInCars,fgeym8l,t1_fge66ti,1580715371.0,"If you’re not familiar with the rule and have never seen a sign on a vehicle in real life before, it’s not all that intuitive. When I was young I always thought it was either for use while the bus was driving or a detachable thing that the driver would get out and hold."
YouShouldKnow,fge2zkj,t1_fgdti0i,1580690181.0,"Im no expert but I’ve heard brown rice yes, white rice no"
YouShouldKnow,fge2ufk,t1_fgd3iz1,1580690091.0,I do the same with chia seeds
YouShouldKnow,fge2e7p,t1_fgd8ka8,1580689820.0,Doesn’t that interfere with your life? I would be miserable if I was pooping 3 times a day
offmychest,fg8k2yj,t1_fg79wl1,1580621992.0,"Any other flu season, if I saw someone in a mask I’d do my best to avoid them. Doesn’t matter the race, sick is sick."
offmychest,fg8j7pj,t1_fg77n4s,1580621182.0,"Yeah the masks that most people wear are to protect the people around the wearer, I’d be uncomfortable (though I’m polite enough not to make a fuss!) sitting beside someone of any race wearing a mask because I’d assume they’re sick."
unpopularopinion,fg7df21,t1_fg72p6g,1580589820.0,I respectfully disagree. I’m a woman and I want the fantasy. My logical brain does kick in and reminds me I won’t look like that in it but the marketing definitely works.
unpopularopinion,fg7d3e3,t1_fg7cb10,1580589602.0,All those kinds of stores are so bad at fittings. I was at La Senza once for some big sale and was given three measurements by three different salesgirls. Got three wildly different suggestions and not one was correct!
