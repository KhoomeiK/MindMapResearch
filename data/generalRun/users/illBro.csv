todayilearned,ffrf6fx,t1_ffr7sds,1580156856.0,You might not be but I'll say it. All cops are bad. They never ever do anything about the bad ones. So they're all complicit
todayilearned,ffrexbm,t1_ffrcrgo,1580156704.0,It's just wack AF because the police union seems to be the only one the government doesn't try to destroy
pics,ffr9t3f,t1_ffr84nv,1580153566.0,Yet when you say that about Catholics raping little boys they get super pissed but they will readily shit on all Muslims. Be consistent at least. If you're gonna blame a whole group for the actions of some you better do it for literally every group. Like you must assume all Sikhs are terrorists because of that group of Sikhs that highjacked a bunch of planes in like the 90s right?

RocketLeague,fff9aaq,t1_fff93bo,1579878880.0,What line. It's a video game which random internet strangers. Just mute and ignore. Responding is feeding the trolls. Or are you so old you don't know what feeding the trolls is.
RocketLeague,fff8qy6,t1_ffdtbqo,1579878521.0,Why do you know so much about them if you're not feeding the trolls. Sounds like you enjoy having something to be mad at so you keep talking to them instead of muting and moving on like normal people.
RocketLeague,ffdsvy3,t1_ffcy4s8,1579828093.0,It's about you choosing to interact with the toxic person instead of muting and ignoring them. You feed the trolls
RocketLeague,ffcxi0t,t1_ffcbfg0,1579809320.0,"Dude, have you tried muting toxic people instead if engaging with them. Why do you know so much about the person. Just mute them instead of finding out how old they are"
RocketLeague,ffc7iuf,t1_ffbl18d,1579793333.0,Dude have you tried getting a stronger mental and not feeding the trolls. When someone starts getting toxic you mute them. You don't feed into their bullshit.

So you're making a strawman and trying to change the subject all because you can't support the argument you copied. Pathetic"

news,ff4vrdm,t1_ff3b0ok,1579573612.0,Yeah but that's not what should happen. Minorities should have the same access to self defense as white people. We just need to actually follow the gun laws we have and probably have better ones
news,ff39t8f,t1_ff352km,1579537044.0,Yeah which is why nobody said shit when Reagan made strict gun laws in California cause black people were buying guns.
news,ff39djf,t1_ff389xo,1579536765.0,1 lol at you being enough of a loser to go through people's history. 2 I've just known enough gun owners to have a realistic view of them. I shot skeet competitively in college and currently still own a double barrel and a Glock. Still think gun laws should be more strict and we should actually enforce the ones we have. But all you have are personal attacks on me from my post history so clearly you can't formulate a real argument.

news,ff308dh,t1_ff2yl8v,1579530158.0,I have owned many guns and fired way more than the number I've owned. My life experience tells me that there's a disturbingly low amount of gun owners that use proper gun safety and a low but also disturbingly high amount of gun owners that are idiots/wackos that should not own a gun. The latter love going to gun rallies. I'm sure the media is overblowing it but it's not unrealistic

Before he was the leader of the birther movement he was known for being an elitist realestate scam artists that hosted a reality TV show. Last time I checked Republicans didn't really like those things but he was saying the brown man wasn't born here and was an illegitimate president so they liked that.
