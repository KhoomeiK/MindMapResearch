Any carbs that have no/very low glycemic impact don't matter to you. So fiber, in particular, you should never count as a carb. In fact, on European food labels they already have it showing 'net carbs' in that sense, since fiber is not counted in the carbs.

Sugar alcohols can have a glycemic impact. That's why some people count them, some people count half of them, and some people count them not at all. This depends on the person and on the specific type of sugar alcohol.

Don't cut her tuition for the spring semester. She has no time to find alternative funding and this is a  commitment you made to her. Unless you explicitly have an agreement about what your standards are for payment and she didn't meet them, you're an ass. Pulling the finding might also push her further into this group, because they'll be the ones she goes to and they'll just blame your atheism. I really doubt that taking away her funding will change her mind.

Think of this the other way: you're very christian and she became an atheist and stopped going to church. She started supporting gay marriage. Turning her away would likely spur her on towards her new group and further away from you. Taking away financing last minute would still make you an ass (unless you had an explicit agreement that she go to church, for example).

Also, electrolytes. Follow what the FAQs say to make sure you're getting enough salt, potassium, and magnesium.

Calories in calories out is king for weight loss. A lot of people find that the appetite suppressing quality of keto is enough to get them into a deficit and losing weight, but that's not always the case. Don't force yourself into a deficit right away, but after 2 weeks if the scale isn't moving you'll need to track.
