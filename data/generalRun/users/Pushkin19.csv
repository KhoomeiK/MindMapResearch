aww,fddz8u4,t3_eknjt0,1578327557.0,"Love this! I found one on a beach, slightly larger, covered in sand. Arms all spread out it did not quite cover my palm. Seemed to have been there a while but very alive. Picked it up and it started moving and flashing red. I tried to rush back down the beach to show my husband but it bit my palm and got a way. I was glad it was healthy enough to defend itself but  I waned a photo! The mark was on my hand a long time!"
