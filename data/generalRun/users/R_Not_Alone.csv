Such a weird scary moment in a light family show.   I can’t remember if there was a life sized doll in the chair, or a skeleton with a wig (probably confusing it with Psycho)


Also there’s an episode of The Real Ghostbusters where there’s some old dude lying in his old times 4 post curtained bed, he’s Babbling some crazy shit and then he starts to fucking melt.  Scared the shit out of me.


And the weirdest one is this;  when I was growing up my parents seemed to be weirdly protective of some things.  They always warned me when someone was going to die on screen, and gave me the option to leave the room.   We’re watching Little Shop of Horrors, the musical with Rick Moranis and Steve Martin, and when it comes time for Steve Martins character to die from laughing to death, they warn me, so I leave.   It took years to get comfortable watching that scene, my brain kept thinking it was something more grotesque than what it was.

Bonus story:   8 year old me goes to see Tim Burtons Batman.  During the fight in the bell tower the film reel gets overheated and melts.   The audience is sitting there patiently waiting for the projectionist to fix it and load the next reel when all of a sudden BANG, the image comes back on, the joker spits bloody fake teeth onto the ground and looks at the camera with a bloody smile.

And then your reply to them comes off in such a bratty manner, like “fine I’ll give a description, but only to you since you complained”.

What you should do when promoting your book in the future is really sell it.   Give a good description of what it is, give us a reason to click on that link to check out this new book.  Not just a link, you already tagged it as self promotion so promote it.

Now hear me out.   I have seen Rob Zombie in concert nearly 10 times.   His live show is quite a spectacle and a lot of fun, BUT he can come across as a very lazy vocalist, he skips a lot of lyrics, seems to get winded, can sometimes manage to be off key,  basically sometimes he just does not sound the best, but he’s also a very active frontman, running around the stage, climbing through the audience, jumping up and down, he puts a lot of physical exertion into his shows, so it makes sense.   And when you’re in the pit joining in on all the activity you barely notice.   It wasn’t really until I got his live cd where it really stood out, then one show I got seat tickets rather than floor and it was like “oof” listening to him.

Also, as much as I love John5, the fact that he plays the same dang solo during Thunder Kiss ‘65, got old real fast.   During the song Zombie gives John5 several minutes to solo it out and it’s always the same, the man is a talented guitar player and it would be cool to hear some of his more signature guitar sounds."

3 cups milk
2 1/2 cups water
1/2 tsp fine sea salt (#1146)
4- 4 1/2 cups macaroni pasta (#1332)
2 Tbsp unsalted butter
1 tsp Dijon mustard
1 1/2 cups evaporated milk
2 cups cheddar cheese (#1866)
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper (#1029)
dash of paprika (#1697)
Tabasco for serving


Instructions:

1.  In a large, heavy bottomed pot, such as a cast iron Dutch oven, combine the milk, water and salt. Bring to a boil, then tip in the pasta, stirring slowly with a wooden spoon.

2.  Cook the pasta in the milk, partially covered with a lid, over medium-high heat until al dente, about 9-10 minutes; it should be slightly underdone when you bite into it. Do not drain!

3.  Reduce the heat to medium-low. Stirring constantly, add the butter, dijon and evaporated milk to the pot. Slowly sprinkle in the cheese, a handful at a time, and stir until melted. The sauce will thicken as the cheese melts and the pasta finishes cooking.

4.   Remove the pot from the heat. Season with pepper and paprika. Taste the mac & cheese and shake in a little extra salt, if desired. Cool slightly, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened and coats the pasta. Serve at once."
