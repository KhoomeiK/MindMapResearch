It's not that HKers are doing something obvious and fun and clear to work. HKers aren't doing anything heroic either. They are only doing what they can to survive and not become XinJiang. When the regime finally falls, whether thanks to HKers or just sheer time, the whole race will finally have a chance to move forward. 

To me, right now, HK represents the only progressive element of the Chinese. You're being very realistic thinking there's almost no chance. I understand that. But to me, HK represents 1% chance to move forward vs 0% the CCP way."

This virus can spread to someone, and this someone have can no symptoms for two weeks, taking it with them spreading to countless others. If they stop everyone in the biggest potential area for two weeks and identify who is sick who is healthy, and then let the healthy travel, they can have a good change of not spreading it to 1.4b and then to 7b people.

This wasn't mishandled. Those people were murdered. 

It seems a lot of people don't understand Chinese New Year as it is celebrated in CCP China. (IIRC) Most people don't live in the same city as their families: people live in dorms for months and go home to their kids and parents once or twice a year. Folks work Saturday and IF they are ""in the system"" for first tier jobs, get Sunday Saturday off so it's rarely enough time to make the trip back home and back. People get 10 days holiday during Chinese New Year. So **everybody** I'm talking the majority of 1,300,000,000 people are going home this time of year. 

And we have just in Wuhan millions of people being told they can't go home for the biggest holiday of the year. 

They fucked up so big. 

Last time for SARS predominantly it was Hong Kongers dying paying the price. We had our medical staff knowing they could well die working around the clock with no information to contain the epidemic and saved all 7m souls in our home. A number of our heroes gave their lives, not unlike Chernobyl FireMen.
