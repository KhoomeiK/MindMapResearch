You can’t post a comment like that and not be an incel. It’s just an excuse"
pointlesslygendered,ffmbir6,t1_ffjxev0,1580051872.0,"This!!! I remember always getting these weird little stuffed animal dress up toys as a kid, can’t remember where, though. My parents just assumed that I wanted them, until I discovered dinosaurs.

Studying paleontology atm. Will never understand gendering things like Pokémon and dinosaurs. Loved Pokémon too!"

AnimalsBeingJerks,ffg096s,t1_ffe1xge,1579895661.0,"Don’t see why my comment got so many downvotes. I’ll definitely try to get you guys the video, since she’s Heccin great, but it’s not guaranteed, since I’m not spending my time following around my kitty with a camera.

If I do get a video, though, I’ll definitely post it here. I have another picture of her doing this, but that would just be spamming. Reddit isn’t the best place for multiple pictures, so lemme check if I’d be allowed to link her instagram (yes, I know, fellow redditors— insta bad, Reddit good— but she’s too great to not share!)"

She’s eight and insanely smart, plus she’s been my little gaming buddy for as long as I’ve had her. Could it be the same kind of thing on how dogs grab your stuff to gain attention?

Won’t post it here since the video has my face in it, but I even taught this cat how to do a buddy ‘secret handshake’, and she seems to have a basic understanding of vibrant colors, as whenever one comes onto my PC, she whacks at where it is on the monitor."
AnimalsBeingJerks,ffe34jh,t1_ffe1xge,1579835459.0,"Definitely one of my bucket list to get. I usually game with dimmer lights, so it won’t be too good, but I’ve definitely got get this.

This cat is, like, human smart. I think she learned by rolling over the keyboard a bunch or smth. She sometimes misses the mark, so I think it’s just a general area thing."

There are many factors, and sadly, they’re mostly just due to the fact that a woman wouldn’t be able to do the act without a ton of drunken harassment ruining the show."

pointlesslygendered,ffbhuvc,t1_ff7uxmv,1579766002.0,"Nah, this is clearly since men don’t have birthdays. As we all know, they are artificially grown in a lab and prokaryotic organisms, capable of only muscles, alcohol, and judging women.

pointlesslygendered,ffbhlky,t3_esgrsw,1579765660.0,Most of the people in the comments of the original post seem to agree with this too. It will always baffle me on how some people believe that they’re funny or not based on what’s between their legs
dankmemes,ffbhie7,t1_ff9lm9p,1579765543.0,"Woman here, and oh boy is that just pointlessly gendered. In all honesty, unless you’re just with some boring people, or too young, that doesn’t sound accurate at all.

I haven’t met one girl who says anything like that, myself included. If you’re one of those people who believes that genitals define whether or not you’re a funny person, then please, take a step back and think about how ridiculous that sounds."

I’m much better now, though, thankfully. However, I do wonder how these people survive getting something as little as allergies/a stuffy nose. Are they just permanent mouth-breathers?"

I honestly don’t think that anyone on that subreddit has ever had an actual conversation with a woman. Their argument is mainly just ‘Women are stupid and destroying the world because they won’t have sex with me’ and all that r/niceguys jazz."

Last anecdote, but this one relates to this meme in particular— In my neighborhood, whenever it would snow, we’d have a giant snowball fight of boys vs girls. However, one year, the boys chose the side with all of the snow, thinking that it would be an easy win.

Those children got frikin pummeled with sheets of ice until everyone got freezy fingers and went inside, it was hilarious. We pretended like the ice sheets were lightsabers and didn’t really think much of it, cuz in our lil kid minds, it’s just water. Made a huge mess, but it was worth it."
