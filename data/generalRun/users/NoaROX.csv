I wouldn't expect say every Nazi to have left their post, but surely more than we saw. I think the hyperbolised ideology they lived by is what this possible."
pics,ffu8hn3,t1_ffu6ez2,1580236706.0,"There was early oppurtunity to leave before conscription went full whack, the night of the long knives was a good warning and the general anti semitism running rampant in the country was something that went unchecked. Still, I see why people would find it hard just to flee, especially during poor times. But remember the army of Germany actually wasn't allegiant to Hitler for a long time, they were essentially their own entity and some soldiers held attempted coups. The second that the army turned allegiances to the Nazis and conscription in the masses began would be another good sign to just leave at the first chance.


 The invasion of territory was another good sign. The atrocities that a great deal witnessed first hand was another red flag. I find it hard to say I would have acted differently in all honesty, cowardice affects us all. That doesn't exempt them from judgement, blaming the times and saying ""everyone did it"" doesnt hold up, you are responsible for what you do. Nobody else. The fact more soldiers didn't just ditch their duties and join other rebels is abismal. 


I respect that some soldiers *were* just fighting for their territory and believed what Goebbels' propaganda machine fed them, that doesn't mean they weren't instrumental to atrocities, even if not intentionally. Also, a lot of children were forced into Hitler Youth and raised to be idealised soldiers, with the Aryan image about citizens being shared. Still, many rebelled actively against the cause, those that didn't were definitely a minority and should be held accountable for actions in later life. Its a crying shame so few nazis were actually sentenced."

I am sure there was a strong deliberation process in this case but from the offset it appears unusual and becomes more so when you read into it.

But still, yes there's always room for doubt. However just as they don't discredit Cosby, they also don't discredit themselves. Innocent until proven guilty applies to both, neither can be determined as lying yet, neither has been proven wrong. So you can only make the statement that Cosby has not been found guilty but not that the accusers are definetly lying because of a lack of evidence. A man was given prison for murder and they never even found the body. Its important not to discredit either party and also admit that a lot of people does make it more likely, 'spotlight' is a coined phrase, it is not legal precedent.

He made a lot of the drums which are ICONIC to the biggest songs. Novoselic came up with a lot of the heavy bass which makes up the Nirvana sound. Him bouncing as a guy at on stage is as important to the nirvana legacy as sid vicious hardly playing was to sex pistols, the guy barely played, was off his face and I don't think he even made it to studio album. 

Yet he's been martyred in the eyes of fans for years. Grohls addition of vocals and writing with cobain as well as his wild performance also made up an important part of what nirvana was. I don't believe at all nirvana would be nirvana without cobain, probably it could be without the others but who knows, maybe not?
