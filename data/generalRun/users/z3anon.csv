ProgrammerHumor,feo46o8,t1_feo1tt7,1579294919.0,"Talking out thought process is how I do my best work, so I think I'm ok there assuming I'm providing the answers they're looking for. During most interviews I seem to get to a place that all parties involved are on friendly terms.

No social media, apart from a Facebook profile that was rarely used even in it's prime a decade ago, so not much content, plus it lists my nickname as the actual name since it was before Facebook required identification so I doubt anyone would really be able to find it. Otherwise the only ""social media"" I use is my LinkedIn profile for professional networking and to expand upon my resume by listing projects, references, etc. on my profile, which is why I list it in my resume header for employer's convenience. I've never really been one to make public social media posts much at all, let alone any that might be inappropriate."

ProgrammerHumor,fenveub,t1_fentc9t,1579291485.0,"I've gotten interviews without issue, yet even when the interview seems to go quite well I haven't had any offers. I've taken business courses in college that have drilled in good interview practices and had my mock interviews reviewed by my peers. It all seems to go well, up to the point most people might get an offer, but there it gets cut off without explanation apart from that they hired someone else with more experience, but these are all entry-level positions.

I'm genuinely getting concerned I somehow got blacklisted in a geological area that I've only lived in for 4 months. My wife had her job set up for her here prior to graduation, and I've been applying for jobs here since then as well, but I've had no luck."

LateStageCapitalism,fej7sfp,t3_epa4vz,1579160519.0,"It's ridiculous that companies are allowed to operate when they break major world laws. There should repercussions or even country-wide bans against companies that do this sort of thing. Unfortunately, unless major governments grow a set of balls and actually stops alotting companies more legal rights than individuals, nothing will change."
ShittyLifeProTips,fej7355,t3_epb5se,1579159628.0,"I've had too many interviews that went well for me to hear back from none of them. I'm applying for shit I'm either completely qualified for, or overqualified for, and yet they're listing senior-level positions requiring 10 years or more of experience under entry-level postings. If job listings faced as much absolute judgement and dismissal as applications do, then  maybe the job market wouldn't be a constant shitshow."
