AskReddit,ffgjhw7,t1_ffgewed,1579907664.0,Lmao what? I literally don’t know one single woman who doesn’t have a job and just lives with a dude.
chicago,ffgj1ed,t1_ffco2wj,1579907363.0,Weird I also go to the med district area and cannot stand taking the brown. It’s so goddamn slow. Feels like we go 5 mph the entire time
chicago,ffghmlg,t1_ffg1h9i,1579906433.0,Meh idk. I ride the red to blue every day to and from work and I’ve definitely noticed an uptick. Three times this week! I never remember even thinking about it in previous years.
OldSchoolCool,fff0zo3,t1_ffez5hr,1579872687.0,You think a man who was imprisoned for years  with PTSD could realistically take care of the kids better than their mom who continued taking care of them alone for years? You think he wanted to? Also see top comment for a note from the eldest son who defends his mother and begs strangers not to try and formulate their own biased and wrong opinions on what happened.
dogs,ffc1i54,t1_ffbzsvz,1579789159.0,"Yes!! We ended up calling the emergency vet and another vet in the area ASAP when it was apparent his foot was swole af. They didn’t seem concerned about it at all and basically said it’s normal and to wait until the next day. Though I was def panicking all night. We ended up loosening the bandages ourselves and it went down some, and took him into the original vet the moment it opened. They redid the bandages to include his foot, so it wouldn’t be a tourniquet. And got daily bandage changes after that. He’s since got his stitches out and is cancer free!!!! Woot!!"
dogs,ffbz3t4,t1_ffbpwnm,1579787294.0,"Dogs will often cry for 12-24 hours after anesthesia. Hope you pup is okay! My dog also just had surgery and the way they wrapped his bandages made his paw swell up HUGE. And despite Tuesday being their surgical day, they are totally closed Wednesday’s. WHAT SENSE DOES THAT MAKE??"
dogs,ff8yt6a,t3_esc0uv,1579700377.0,My bully mix requires antibiotics. It’s normally allergic infection that turns into staph infection. You can’t cure topically
chicago,ff8y86f,t1_ff7v0kw,1579699902.0,Meh. The entire country of Canada sold out after a single day
WeHateMovies,ff871vu,t3_es5o1e,1579667828.0,Am I an idiot? I don’t get what you mean by either way lmao
