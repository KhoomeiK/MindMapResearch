JUSTNOMIL,fdepha7,t3_ekxpw3,1578343895.0,"I think you made your point. Let it go until they do it to you again. Then when they show up, with a smile and gentle good humor, tell them what you did and why you did it. Then offer that for everyone's peace of mind that the ""drop-ins"" will no longer happen to either household. Then offer to call for a pizza to celebrate the new deal! Everyone wins and hoefully fragile ego's will be preserved. Maybe I'm being naive here, but I hope not. I think you guys did well!"
RATS,fdcjr9b,t1_fdc0hue,1578276628.0,You are going to give him such a happy life. Happy Ratting!

Cooking,fcv8cf1,t3_ej0y2g,1577996754.0,"My weeknight go-to is  Spaghetti alla puttanesca (""whores pasta"" because only someone whoring around all day would dare make such a ""shortcut"" pasta dish. That is reason enough to make it). Its quick and very good, lots of layers of flavor and comes together in minutes. I also keep a selection of meat rubs around then its just a quick decision of a protein, pat down with the rub and bake or saute. This gives you endless variety quite easily. Pair everything with a simple salad and you are good to go. Puttanesa is an epic leftover lunch, by the way. I read everyone else's response and will employ quite a few. Great question, OP."

Foil covered cookie sheet. Bake for 10 min in a 400 degree oven then start broiling a minute or two at a time. Store in airtight container."

In the pantry, the junk drawer, the mailbox, the vegetable drawer in the fridge... just everywhere. Say nothing, act natural. Have some fun with this while taking the power away."
