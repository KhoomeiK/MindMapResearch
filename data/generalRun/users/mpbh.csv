Best Aerial - Attack from Edge of Area

Best Long Shot - Lurk Outside Area

Best Tackling - Stay Back

Best Tackling - Stay Back

All Others - Go Forward

Since you're in the lower english leagues, I'd recommend filtering to free agents (I think it's called 'Unattached' in the contract filter). I'd recommend adding a column for Alltime Appearances to find the free agents who got minutes in the past, that will help you sort out the dregs.

What's on takeout *is* the whole dataset. It's the raw data, the emails, the pictures, the browsing history, the location data, etc. This is what they use to tag you for ads. You can see how they tag you [in your personalized ad settings.](https://adssettings.google.com/u/0/authenticated)

There is not some hidden mystery dataset. The ads you see are a combination of your ad tags and pieces of your takeout data (e.g. people with xyz tags who have searched for 'product type' in the past month)

Google is far from the only company tracking you (look into LiveRamp formerly known as Acxiom who were inches away from leaking the names, addresses, and email addresses of 1.6 billion people, which would be the largest PI breach in history). The difference between Google and these other companies is we trade our data and eyeballs to Google in exchange for their amazing free services, and Google actually takes security very seriously.

All of these third parties are tracking you at no benefit to you, they are opaque to the data they have about you, and they don't have the best engineers in the world safeguarding your data. 

By the way, [Acxiom claimed to have 1,500 data points on 500 million people in *2012*](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/technology/acxiom-the-quiet-giant-of-consumer-database-marketing.html), and most people have never heard of them or their security breach. At least Google is under heavy public scrutiny.
