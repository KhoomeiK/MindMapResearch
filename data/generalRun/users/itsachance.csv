OldSchoolCool,ffdvfxn,t1_ffcihl7,1579829913.0,Super weird you mentioned them because only a week ago I was listening to them and decided to look into some videos on YouTube of their more recent performances.
OldSchoolCool,ffca069,t1_ezw34ej,1579794919.0,"A successful parent is an engaged parent. Not money, not prestige, not gifts. Engaged. Trusted. Kind. Consistent."
OldSchoolCool,ffc9dbr,t1_ezv8l57,1579794518.0,"Yeah, right?"
OldSchoolCool,ffc92r7,t1_ezv9woh,1579794332.0,I have a very similar upbringing as what you're describing. Your acknowledgement of it and your awareness will make it different for your children and I'm happy for you for that!
OldSchoolCool,ffc8wti,t1_ezv7lw8,1579794227.0,"Wow -this really warms my heart. He was the father I wish I had and the father I wish my children had.  When men are this involved with their children -it seriously has a very good ripple effect on the world. I'm so so happy for you that you benefitted from it and your children and their children and so on- will also benefit greatly.  He is a true hero with success of the kind that matters the very most!!! Loving support, kindness and loyalty to his family and service to the world. I will remember him!"
OldSchoolCool,ffc8i3e,t1_ezwd9bf,1579793962.0,"It threw me off a little bit- but when it was followed up by the Alzheimer bit I understood it. Seemed to be phrased right, and creatively, because of the situation."
OldSchoolCool,ffc86n4,t1_ezux6hf,1579793757.0,"Just to piggyback on your comment- I have no idea of your age or anything- but I am the parent of young adults. They're going through a particularly self centered stage of really not spending any time with either of us parents or even some of their siblings.  I just pray and hope that nothing happens to me and they regret that. I know it sounds self serving and I don't mean it that way- but family time is important.  Well, that is if its safe and respectful to be around them. 
As I age I just see the quickness of it all and how everything can change in an instant."
OldSchoolCool,ffc7kuy,t1_ezv2w9g,1579793370.0,Yes. You are very lucky I cannot say I had to same upbringing.

OldSchoolCool,ffc6ac0,t1_ew20ysj,1579792528.0,"One time in an AA meeting I heard a person talk about being at school when they were child and their sibling died while they were at school that day ( I don't know the circumstances ). When they came home from school there was no photos of the sibling,  all of the child's things were gone and the family did not talk about it! Can you imagine?"

OldSchoolCool,ffc3u1l,t3_enkrux,1579790865.0,I've just listened to a Podcast interview with him and I was quite impressed. His spiritual backgound in the Baha'i faith has really made him into quite a caring person and I just really appreciated knowing that.
