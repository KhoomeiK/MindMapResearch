InteriorDesign,fezuqe1,t1_feziawn,1579461910.0,"But this is actually a really specific assumption you have both made regarding what I am referring to (and also regarding my own lack of knowledge about the career) and I am talking about the negativity all over, not always on those kinds of low effort, blank-room-give-me-advice posts. I’m talking about people who don’t even ask for advice being chewed out. One I saw was like “i’m really proud of this I did, what do you think?” And all the responses were “the lighting is horrible” or whatever. Or one that asked which of three specific options worked best as a combination and some of the comments were “none of them, the whole thing doesn’t work” I mean there is just no need to comment like that.

Also how sad that some people feel like if they aren’t getting paid they have to ‘cut to the chase’. Or justify being a douche by saying “people were a douche to me too!” There is never any excuse for being rude and negative in my mind. However, it feels a bit like you aren’t really bothered or see any issue so i mean. I guess this is a moot point. As such, have a great day and i wish you well."

Ok though, here’s the thing. Switzerland is verrryyyy expensive for kind of everything. In 2009 I headed there, and the minimum I could draw out of an ATM was the equivalent of £77 (131 CAD). My friend toured there with her band and said she ordered two coffees and a pizza and it came to £40. My advice would be to head to a little supermarket and do a little food shop, potentially finding air bnbs with a little kitchen if poss. That should hopefully save you a little cash.

travel,fdd2odj,t1_fdcwc3e,1578292350.0,"Island-wise avoid Phi Phi then. Depending on how much travelling you want to do I would either recommend going to Railay which isn’t actually an island but is beautiful, relaxing, and beachy but fun too with lots of bars, climbing, and a great cave (nearest airport Krabi, then it’s a car and little 15min boat journey away), Yao Yai is another option, this one much more quiet and depending on where you stay either more resorty or more authentic than Railay (nearest airport Krabi, then a drive and like a 1hr and a bit speedboat ride) or finally Koh Tao which is a great diving island, very small very lovely though more of a trek to get to. I personally would spend the extra cash and fly in to koh samui than take the drive then two hour speed boat; instead of doing what we did which was go by land/sea from phi phi. This took a full 12hrs ish. 

I would also like to point out depending on what time of year you go I would also certainly rule some of these out. If you go in August then I would suggest the bad weather and choppy seas will mean that Railay and Koh Yao Yai should be ruled out. Head straight to Samui and Koh Tao you will not regret it. December then rule out Tao and go for maybe the other two. 
Hope this helps.

Recap:
Railay-beach, climbing, chill, lots of bars, caves, fun monkey friends, super lush greenery

Yao yai-quieter, less touristy, some hotels on this beautiful island are more resorts so you don’t have to leave and therefore are less authentic but if you just stayed in a regular hotel you would be more authentic, cute water buffalo, amazing variety of butterflies, very lush and tropical less bars. 

Koh Tao- diving, less beachy, beautiful, more remote, harder to get to, head here in july/August as it will be sunny and calm (most of the time). Accessed via..

koh samui-loud, busy, very beachy, very fun, white sands and shallow waters, loads of food including night markets, beware horrible animal for tourist practices (drugged tigers, monkeys stolen from mamas, drugged snakes etc)"

SkincareAddiction,fd8suju,t3_ek8gs1,1578222975.0,"Perioral dermatitis help

Hi,

I hope this question is allowed here. I believe that I have perioral dermatitis. It is not diagnosed but this condition i have had for nearly ten years on and off. I am 34f. I have only been to the doctor once and he didn’t have a clue what he was talking about, didn’t even look at my skin and just heard the word ‘redness’ and prescribed me something rosacea which I definitely don’t have. At that time I didn’t know it may have been perioral dermatitis but after years of research and misery i think this is what I have and I was hoping for skincare routine help without having to book for a dermatitis (prices start at £200 for a consultation!) 

I can go into why I think I have this condition and my symptoms if anyone deems it necessary.

   My skin is extremely dry generally. As such I only wash my face on an evening and I use a gentle creamy wash called garnier skin active rose soothing and cleansing milk. I don’t believe that this is a trigger because I have used it for four years now. I initially thought my issue was dry skin and when this flares up periodically my first instinct was always to scrub it. Whoops! I have ised Kiehl’s midnight recovery cream by my nose for around a year which has no discernible effect and I have recently tried using weleda skin food to moisturise around my nose but could this be trigger? I also read somewhere that using vaseline on dry skin can trap moisture in and help but now I see that products with parrafin and petroleum in might worsen this. 

I am a female and wear makeup but not every day though I do of course instinctively cover mostly the worst and most red areas which obviously now seems like a bad idea?! Foundations I use are: benefit oxygen wow, armani luminous silk, charlotte tilbury magic foundation or just garnier skin active bb cream (age defying, am old). 
 
Can anyone help with specific products I can use to help? Or specific friendly foundations or moisturisers? Or should I just lay off damn well everything for a few weeks? I am a high school teacher so teenagers would be ruthless if i wore no makeup for a while! I am in the UK. 

Thanks so much in anticipation."

   I personally think three days in Bangkok is fine, but all of the other places you listed are v different and most involve flying. What are you hoping for in your thai trip? Authenticity? Quiet and relaxing? Adventure? Busy and thriving? Night markets? Food? Sea and sun? Natural or historical wonder? 

I would even choose where you stay in each place really carefully too. For example we stayed in three different hotels in Chiang Mai (!!) and would say go inside the city walls and less glam than out of the city walls for more of a luxury place (as an example, it might be that Chiang Mai is not for you, I myself probably wouldn’t go back). Bangkok is going to need a lot of research in the different areas and what you sre after too to choose where you stay.

Anyhow let me know what kind of thing you’re after from your trip and I will we be able to tell you more.

Art,fcmtan8,t1_fcmshv6,1577791213.0,Hey thanks. A biro pen is just a pen. Like a bic. One you would usually write with.
selfimprovement,fcmsa4e,t3_ehu2xt,1577789774.0,"My dude you have lots of great advice on here and I would hopefully like to add to that. Negativity and negatively framing things is very difficult to get out of, it’s usually learned behaviour. For me, it comes from my family who could be given a giant diamond and ask why the diamond wasn’t bigger and uhhhh what will they use that for? Hehe. 
   Ok you have done the hardest thing which is recognise it! Next stop, three more things to keep at. 

1) that old trope; if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all. It’s a slow process but it works. Catch yourself in the thinking act, and stop yourself saying it (easier said than done but keep at it!) sometimes if i find myself thinking negatively _about_ someone I force myself to say something positive about them out loud and for others to hear. I have also changed how i view others but that is another fopic I won’t go into here! 

2) someone else has already suggested this, a positive journal. At the end of every day think of three positive things that happened that day no matter how overall shitty the day was and write them down. If you keep at it consistently soon you will start thinking “ooh that could be one of my three things later!” And eventually you will notice the positive things more than the negatives. It really works. 

3) challenge yourself to get out of your comfort zone. Many negative thinkers stay exactly where they are because tjey are too afraid to try anything new because’knowing my luck it will go wrong’. I read a naff quote once but it really inspired me and hopefully will you too “don’t live the same year 70-odd times in a row and call it a life”. My life really turned around (with the help of my husband) when i really made myself do stuff. Join classes, apply for that position you want, I walked on a glass bridge, I took up surfing, i flew long haul which was something i was always talking myself out of. Even silly little things like ordering something you have never tried before off a menu. Things that go wrong are experiences and you have to look at them that way. 

This summer my husband and I were stuck in a storm on a speedboat in the middle of the ocean and we were laughing our heads off. At that point I knew I had changed! What an experience that was! 

Good luck and let me know how you go, it might take years but I bet you’ll get there because you sound like you’re interested in being the best you can be."
