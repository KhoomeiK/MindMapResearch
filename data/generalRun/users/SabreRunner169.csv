askwomenadvice,ff1fx9u,t1_ff0pj56,1579478597.0,"Think of it this way.  You only have x number hours in a day to focus on anything.  Spend those hours focusing on self improvement, and being the best version of you possible. All the while be polite and friendly to everyone you meet. Just try to impress you, not them

You will be amazed at the people you will attract into you life.  You wonâ€™t be isolating anyone"

askwomenadvice,feyhpwb,t3_eqwfsh,1579445737.0,"You just described my dating life.

Here's what I did.

I accepted the brutal facts that I'm just not an attractive person.  Tough to accept, but it was true.  So then I changed my focus 100% to me, and self-improvement.  It actually felt liberating because  I quit trying to impress the opposite sex.  I learned a second language, I focused on some fitness goals, and my career.  Even became interested in art and poetry.  In short, I ended up feeling attractive, but knew it was just in my eyes.  I learned to love me.  When I looked in the mirror, I liked what I saw

And now, people comment about my body and how good it looks.  They ""check me out"" when I walk into a room.  They talk to me about how smart I am and how people look up to me.  And now, for some reason, people find me attractive.

I hope this makes sense.  I can give more details if it helps"
