There’s no reason they can’t be playing 2+ hours after this release.."

I couldn’t be more excited!! 

*It felt like champagne to start out a Saturday night type vibes if that makes sense.* Like I’m somehow on a yacht too ? Haha in the best of ways.  *disclaimer never been on a yacht but it felt all upbeat proper 

It sounds different enough to be fresh and new, but similar enough to be familiar. I think it’s a perfect middle ground.  I think I’ll always prefer more guitar oriented styles, but if you look at the complete catalog there is plenty of that to choose from. I don’t want to zoom in on one album for someone, but take the holistic approach. 

Also, when you consider live shows can only be so long, you start to see an immense amount of possibilities when 4-5 per album are played. 

I can tell you there were a couple instant classics for me.. and that’s usually pretty hard to do on a 1st listen for myself!  I can only imagine each song growing on me more and more too.

TameImpala,fg4p5d5,t1_fg4mmtj,1580508003.0,"A rough quote from my professor in Audio engineering school..

“Somewhere there is someone out there with a tape recorder and a $5 guitar writing the biggest hits yet to be heard.  Simultaneously -  there’s a team of award winning engineers and producers working in a multi-million dollar studio with unlimited budgets and will record songs that will never get any play or recognition. No matter what you learn here- just remember - it all comes down to the song. That’s the magic. That’s the focus. Everything else will fall into place after” 

Aka it doesn’t matter the quality of the stream if the song is amazing! You can still hear a song. That doesn’t mean it won’t be Better in HD, but it certainly allows the listener to make a judgement call."

Although these are much longer falls, Dettifoss is much wider and by pure volume - it is the strongest fall in Europe (off head) 

These are just wee little ones in comparison of volume ha"

For anyone reading - The fact is - you don’t know.  It depends on who’s having a good or bad day that day.  It depends on if it’s a local or a federal agency conducting said raid.  All things out of anyone’s controls or knowing.  It is still a grey area. 

Being an idiot would be blindly assuming you’re invincible without knowing the possible outcomes of every scenario. I’m not mentioning a legal disp. This was a reply to an illegal disp. = it is highly likely to get targeted for a raid.  I didn’t even assume charges would be filed.  I assume the possibility, even if 0.001% chance, is still possible for an arrest/detainment with release.  This is to make educated decisions - not fear monger. As an adult, you can say a 0.0001% chance is fine by me. Great, at least you’re not blind sided if it does happen. 

*We should be lifting each other up, and giving knowledge about these things to look out for one another -  not dismantling someone’s opinion you don’t agree with and calling them names. Come on.*

They might detain and question and release you. Depending on how this is done, you may end up with a record with release.  How are they to know if you’re not someone working there on the other side of counter?  Someone having a bad, day, with federal authority, might just lasso everyone together and work backwards to unravel the puzzle. Aka it might be easier to take everyone in and figure it out later. They have the right to do it depending on the agency.

You can go 5mph over speed limit - you’ll likely never get a ticket, but don’t be fooled it doesn’t happen every day to someone causing a major headache. Stay safe people. 


TL:DR - let’s build each other up, not tear down. An illegal disp is highly targeted for a raid. Be educated and make sure you’re ok with any risks, even if highly unlikely, that may arise for shopping at one."

It’ll drop charges probably, but the arrest record will stay with you a very long time + cost of lawyers"
