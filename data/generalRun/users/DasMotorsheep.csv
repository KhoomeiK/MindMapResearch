AskReddit,ffu8dzx,t3_ev5zdg,1580236647.0,"A few days ago because I miss the Canary Islands so much.  I love my life as it is now, but it hurts to not be able to go just back and see those cliffs, smell the smells, hear the sounds...

Forget the village in Germany I grew up in. I didn't choose that. Forget the suburb where I had my first apartment and stayed there for over 10 years. It was just a place to live.

But this magical little island that I emigrated to? After just five years, it's in my bones. But it grew too small when my relationship blew up. I had to go. And now my life doesn't really allow me to return. I'm hoping to grab a vacation this year, though."

edit:

that's great timing, too. Now you'll never forget your son's birthday, because you can just look at your Reddit account."
analog,ffu7i49,t1_ffs6clm,1580236118.0,"I do think it's kind of meant to show an angelic model in a real life situation. Like, not convincingly, the pose is not realistic enough for that, but artistically."
analog,ffu7ew9,t1_ffs1kce,1580236065.0,"Nah, just French, I'd say. They like a voyeurist touch on their photos.   


The towels aren't fresh and perfectly arranged, either. So it's a posed photo in a ""snapshot"" environment, made to look like a snapshot.  I think it's cool."

Sorry, have no critque to offer, know nothing about photography. Just handing out a heart for the revolution. I have a couple of friends who grew up in Lebanon but left the country, all women, they're amazing people.. some of them went back home for the protests."

AskReddit,fft1wjj,t1_ffrpvjf,1580202639.0,I didn't know you could turn your relatives into yams. This opens up a whole new perspective.
pics,ffroctc,t1_ffrkw3b,1580162232.0,I think it's a humorous reference to the missing fingers.

Yeah I think when something's on your to-do list for this life, it's gonna happen no matter what. Been saying this since a friend who didn't get a driving license because he was a stoner and didn't want to be tempted to drive stoned died in a car crash - the same year in which he turned old enough to get a license.

Went and stalked your facebook, found the pics from the ER, too. And you even managed to get your household prepared for your absence before getting into that ambulance. God damn you're made of steel. I mean, obviously not, otherwise you'd have bent the saw as much as your fingers, but I guess you know what I mean.

But then again, that's moms for you. Moms break down when they can afford to, not when they feel like it. Pretty humbling to witness for me as a man, time and time again, but in a good way."

tifu,ffqnfdz,t3_eum1lj,1580139184.0,"> another 6 very awkward weeks with very little eye contact made between myself and the father in law. We’ve now moved in to our new home so I’m hoping we can keep the grandparent visits to a minimum for awhile. 

Let it be heard that prudishness ruins families."
