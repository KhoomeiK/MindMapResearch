But your clippers look like they could use a good wash. The handles are discolored. I use 99% isopropyl alcohol and it works like a dream. This prevents mold/disease/etc from being spread to your finished plant so it doesn't ruin all your hard work.

Edit: lol at the downvote. That's cool if y'all don't want to have a clean environment for your cannabis. But it doesn't make me wrong."

microgrowery,ffjn1gv,t1_ffj6q49,1580002032.0,I thought Moroccans were doing the hot water/wine bottle method long before Americans? And iirc Frenchie Cannoli was the one to bring it to popularity in America.

mycology,ffj8lai,t1_ffj73en,1579993027.0,"I cannot thank you enough for this. I've been really into soil ecology, and mushrooms just seemed a natural next step for my next growing project. This gives me a great place to get started in setting up the system I have in mind. I love micro controlling environments (you can see my indoor garden in my post history) and I'm guessing fungi can be grown in a similar manner. Do you happen to know if I can grow multiple species in the same environment (given they have similar humidity/temp/light requirements), or if I would have to build multiple enclosures for the different types?"
