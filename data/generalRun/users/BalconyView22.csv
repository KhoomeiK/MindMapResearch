CrossStitch,ff7pnw7,t1_ff5mp6z,1579655307.0,"It's a shame. Men need stress relief, too, and I find stitching relaxing (of course, I'm a woman, so that's acceptable!). Men can also appreciate art and beauty, believe it or not. I guess there will always be men who look down on other men who sew, or dance, or write poetry. Hopefully, most people are more enlightened than that."
CrossStitch,ff7okue,t1_ff5bggq,1579654544.0,I remember him being liked by everyone. Even Howard Cosell. I think his size and football popularity went a long way toward people accepting his choice of hobby. If Rosey does it then it must be ok for men to do it.
CrossStitch,ff7o1u9,t1_ff51xl9,1579654171.0,"I don't grid my fabric so I don't have any opinions on working on that. I was taught to start a cross stitch piece in the center of the fabric, as were most of us ""old stitchers"". This assures that you are perfectly centered. It also gives you the flexibility to work in all directions. There are You Tube videos and written tutorials on how to do this, if you look for them. I always start in the center."

CrossStitch,ff50q42,t3_ernp4m,1579577117.0,I think it might work if you're doing a full coverage piece. A tip for next time - I always start in the center to avoid this. I wish I could think of another suggestion to help you now. Good luck and let us know how it goes.

CrappyDesign,ff4yuyy,t1_ff40nv7,1579575759.0,"The raised edge should be in the back. To insert it correctly, you need to tilt the front up slightly, push it back, then lower the front. This is pretty standard for ovens. Go to your nearest store and ask them to show you. That would be much easier than trying to have someone give you a written explanation. Please do that because your oven is not safe the way you're doing it.

Edit - the rack goes between the grooves. The part that sticks up in the back it what holds it into place. Once you see how it's done, you will be able to pull the rack out holding a 20 lb turkey!"

Autoimmune,ff1s3a5,t1_fezlih1,1579484936.0,That is the response most people with autoimmune diseases will experience. I don't know why I've been so lucky. Maybe because I was a nurse. Maybe because I raised 4 kids. I may have developed some immunities. I was certainly not saying anyone should purposely expose themselves to infection. Just that you don't know how your body will respond when you're newly diagnosed. I'm so sorry you're one of those people who are highly susceptible to illness. We feel bad enough already without adding recurrent sickness to the list.

I understand your reason for wanting to use an even number of strands. The loop method has become popular, although it wasn't really a ""thing"" when I was younger. We just caught the tail under our first 3 or 4 stitches, which is how I always start. Practice it sometime on scrap fabric so you'll be able to determine your number of strands based on how it looks.

I guess the answer is that we all need to recognize that life is hard regardless of how you choose to live it, but it's not all bad.

It's still a popular way to stitch and you can find it on cross stitch sites. You did a really nice job stitching it. Did you like it?

CrossStitch,fe5xir1,t1_fe5ehp3,1578877151.0,"Generally, each piece should be washed and ironed before framing. Even if you're careful with dirt and food, oils from your hands can show up later as a stain. There are many websites and videos that discuss washing embroidery safely. I hand wash with a drop of mild detergent in cool water. Gently squeeze the soapy water through the fabric, don't wring or scrub. Rinse well in cool water, again, gently squeezing the fabric until completely rinsed. Dry flat on a clean towel. To iron, place face down on a terry cloth towel and cover with a piece of fabric to avoid catching your stitches with the iron (a pillow case works well)."
