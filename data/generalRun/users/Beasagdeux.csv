Alot of soldiers are young... really young.  Enlist at 17 or 18.  Many had a sucky childhood often in poverty.  They get married young and quickly for a million different reasons but often include  A. if you are getting transferred then that's the only way this person can come with you.  or B. your headed into a war zone and want 'family' due to the uncertainty of what's going to happen.

I guess.. the more 'personal' something was.. the more likely I was to get rid of it.   So I've got a clock on the wall in the kitchen I've had for 40 years that I got from my first BF.  I didn't keep it because he gave it to me.. but because I liked the clock.     


All the little love notes we generated during those years?  Those hit the trash before I married the first time.  Because I didn't want to go into that relationship with all that baggage.    


I generally kept a couple pictures, especially if they were travel pics, but dumped the bulk of them.   I guess that's less of a thing now with digital pictures and they are all over IG anyway.    


No one is an island and everyone has history.  But try to pick and choose a few items to save.   
 Perhaps try to look at things from your current/future SO's standpoint.  Hard to believe you are ready for a new relationship if you are saving every little scrap of paper that you ever got from your EX.   Who wants to put themselves out there for a person that hasn't moved forward?"

By the time of the surgery I was having my period 3 weeks out of the month.. with a 5 or 6 days of it bleeding so badly I would go through a superpad every 30 mins.   Nothing from the doctors except  'gee that's too bad' and take more NSAIDS.    


A dozen doctors.  Ultrasounds.  etc.    they can't find anything wrong just few fibroid tumors.  But a couple of them are pretty big so I finally convince a surgeon to do a hysterectomy.  


He does the surgery.  Pathology comes back adenomyosis.  Surgeon literally apologizes because he thought I was just being a bitch but 'gee there was actually something wrong'.     


This after I told each and every doctor that my mother had had adenomyosis (also discovered post-op by the pathologist).  And them blowing me off saying it wasn't genetic.    


I mentioned it to a ultrasound tech a couple years ago and she was like.. ""yeah now we know what to look for"" but in 2001 it was seriously under diagnosed."
