dogs,ffhcwgm,t1_ffhblzx,1579930261.0,oh my gosh i know. i’ve been moved to tears a few times hearing my little leo cry. it’s heartbreaking. but it gets easier and he’ll adjust i promise !
dogs,ffhba91,t3_etmfbg,1579928659.0,i had the same issue with my puppy. we started to play games with him in the crate. we’d throw his toy in and make him go get it. we’d put little pieces of food in for him to go eat. make sure you’re associating the crate with fun. it’s going to take time for him to adjust to it and the first few nights are really rough. let him cry it out even though it’s heart breaking and your ears are hurting. you don’t want to him to think that every time he cries he’s rewarded by being let out of his crate. i highly suggest giving him a kong toy with some peanut butter when he’s in the crate so he has something to play with and occupy himself. short increments throughout the day should help him get used to it. i also recommend putting something like a sweater or shirt that you’ve worn in there so he can smell you. it’s definitely rough but he’ll get used to it ! good luck !
puppy101,fepswk6,t3_eqc6ic,1579330152.0,they sell treats made by the kong brand for kong’s. you can get them at petco. you can also use dog bones !
dogs,fepss00,t3_eqckz8,1579330032.0,i had this issue with my dog too. i started picking her food bowl up while it was in front of her to get her used to me touching her food. if we need to take something away from her we’ll trade with her by giving her a toy and taking the item away from her. i’ve also learned to hold her collar and kind of nudge her from the item. as for ur wound just soap and water and then some bacitracin. if it’s deep i would definitely see a doctor.
Dogtraining,fe3y3jr,t1_fdymzfa,1578853933.0,i’ve had issues with my dogs jumping on people too. they’ve never nipped but the jumping was broken by us leashing them whenever someone came in the house. we made them sit while we held the leash. the jumping isn’t necessarily aggressive. it can be over excitement from not enough stimulation. kong toys are really great for that ! you can also try dog puzzle toys which can help mentally tire him out which will make it easier to deal w him
Dogtraining,fdylvzw,t3_ene4t9,1578781234.0,"the first issue is locking him up when people come over. by doing this you’re showing him that there’s danger. try to leash your dog when friends come over and start by meeting outside and giving him a treat and have friends give him a treat as well before moving inside. as for the issue with him being aggressive towards you, crating when you leave may be a good option. before you take him out give him a small treat. then take him straight to the backyard to relieve himself and have another family member inside give him a treat when he comes in. with some proper care and training you can fix this issue ! long walks are also a must to relieve pent up energy and anxiety and this helps your dog to bond with you. please don’t put him down because of this. if you need help please leave more comments/questions."
puppy101,fdt4ke6,t3_en18pl,1578711834.0,my dogs and puppy get hiccups all the time. completely normal :)
puppy101,fdt4b9b,t3_en1gk9,1578711736.0,it’s most likely just swollen from the surgery.  most dogs have the instinct to know that they are injured and will be careful. does your dog have a cone on? if not i definitely recommend getting one to keep the dog from the incisions bc if she’s licking it at all it can get infected. it should be okay for the weekend but call on monday to get her in to your vets office so they can check it out to make sure it hasn’t gotten infected.
dogs,fdrq3nt,t1_fdmm3jn,1578688053.0,of course ! this happens to my cat all the time ! he gets scabs and then they fall off and the hair comes out. he should be alright !
