ABoringDystopia,ffc2j8f,t1_ffb1ijn,1579789926.0,"So an actual explanation, in some cases it's a pointless fee that's added on for no other reason to make money (like with some online ticket services you'll pay one regardless of how you get your tickets, it's all a convince). In a case like this a convenience fee is an additional fee charged for using a card (credit/debit) to pay instead of a check or linking a bank account to pay. A convenience fee can range from a couple of dollars (the cost of processing the card) to hundreds (for stupid reasons).

It's legal in that there's nothing preventing it, in many cases there will be fine print that says ""by choosing this option you agreed to pay a nonrefundable processing fee of $$$"" and make it a ""legal contract""."

Do not feel that way, if anyone is making you feel that way tell them to fuck off, if it is you please understand that that's an anti-bi sentiment and you should have no reason to feel like being with someone who you love is taking the easy way out simply because the person is of a different sex.

Accidental shaming done with. That feeling of being invisible is a very common thing with the bi community because while it makes up 60%+ of the LGBT community it's a sexuality that doesn't outwardly show. I get it, when you're in a same sex people seem to fawn over you for it, and if you're used to it the absence can feel like you've lost something once it's gone.

If I read your post correctly you said that you were in a same sex relationship prior, and now feel like you're no longer part of LGBT because you're not outwardly part of it. I'd recommend doing other things to try and show your pride outwardly (pins, t-shirts, flags, etc).

Also I don't know what type of guys you've hooked up with and watch porn with, but personal aesthetic choices may also play a role in this (I'm more attracted to androgenous guys than any other type) and it may just be you haven't seen a girl that fits into your current favored aesthetic.

bisexual,fdnj1ji,t1_fdn5q04,1578586838.0,">I think it’s because it has less of a stigma than saying you are bisexual. But, I could be wrong.

I'm curious where the stigma for bi came from, and how much of it came from within the GBLT community, since there really has been a long running problem of bi erasure from both sides (the two monosexuals). I really do see there seems to be this idea spreading that bi's are only about the genitals. NO, I don't like Derrik because he has a penis, I'm attracted to Derrik because he's a cool guy who is attractive.

The one thing that I've heard about the bi/pan divide is that pan is ∞gender attraction where bi is 2 thorugh ∞^(-1) . Additionally Pan seems to have an emphasis on non-binary, which I think is a bit absurd as I see it as the moral equivalent of saying men and women then screaming non-binary.

>  I use bi because it’s a term that’s been around forever

Now here's the interesting thing of it all, Bi is the accepted umbrella for bi,pan,poly,omni,and multi, and that's generally accepted. So I think the way that's gender theory is moving it is that Bi is the broad term (orange) that is used for simplicity by some, while pan,omni,poly,multi are more specific (tangerine,marigold,cantaloupe,yam)."
