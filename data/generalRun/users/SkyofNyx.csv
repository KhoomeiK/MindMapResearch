offmychest,fcu1ctp,t3_eiw4tl,1577969242.0,"Hey-ya!

Honestly i'm a failure at life too, and that's okay; at least it's okay for me because although I suck at everything for the most part... if I don't suck i'm mediocre at best (school, people, etc.), I say fuck it and look for the joy in life. If it ain't there I create it. 

Today, I legit spent the whole day holed up in my room; I was a bit depressed and bored for a bit, which I realized is my own goddamn fault which just made it worst... but I decided to spend my time creating. A pen and paper can really be my best friend at times, even though my creations suck! X'D

Basically, wanted you to know you are not alone. And am hoping that makes things a little better."

running,fc50lc5,t3_eg5pcq,1577436950.0,"I'm no expert but I think doing some sort of exercise in water would def. help with the longevity of your joints. Also maybe long walks, and frequent movement (if not already doing that)? If you are able, go to a dietitian and/or trainer for help (def. give dietitian priority though, as long as you listen to your body and do training that you a comfortable with I think you would be fine on the actual exercise part of it...)."
offmychest,fc4ren7,t3_eg4xsd,1577425649.0,Merry Christmas!
offmychest,fc0803s,t3_efb7t8,1577282401.0,"Thank you. It's my first Christmas alone, but I still made a day of it :) 

Was a tad upset that my immediate family did not face-time me again today (I called this morning, and didn't get to talk to everyone), when they said they would... but understandable since this christmas was a family reunion; and my extended fam is crazy-  and huge, so probably got busy... or drunk... probably both."
