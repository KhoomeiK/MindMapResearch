Edit: change heavier to denser to please nitpickers. In a common sense talk, when people say heavier/lighter, it’s often about specific weight. I.e : wood is lighter than water so it float, helium is lighter than air so it rise. Hot air is lighter so it rise. Even in flying technical talks, people also use “lighter than air” to point to balloons, blimps, and heavier than air to point to.... (you get the point).  So saying heavier here clearly transfer the message, nitpicking is just ... silly."
