houston,ffe4etw,t3_esysah,1579836412.0,"tl;dr: Soto Ready Mix wanted to build a concrete mixing plant in middle of Acres Homes. They’ve wanted to for years, but the residents kept pushing back. Today, the company withdrew its application for permit.


They really thought putting the flippin mixing plant smack dab in the middle of a neighborhood wouldn’t catch any attention. Just because they could, doesn’t mean they should."

That intersection needs a curb in the middle to prevent this, with a u-turn made available further down. The impatience and attention span of today’s drivers, combined with larger vehicles and blind spots, makes unprotected 4-ways like this not worth the trouble."

Pedantic here. It means there’s no orders for more. What they have is all that is coming to them.

There’s nothing stopping Costco from placing an order for more, say, the week after these are gone. Maybe the blanket PO (no pun intended) expired with the vendor and they’ll re-negotiate quantities and pricing."

Surely they can have the machine snap it into place. They can run under a wheel to push it onto the mandrel, or move the first boob down a spot and modify the first one to seat it.

On the back end, move them through some fork that pops them off."
