LegendsOfRuneterra,ffsj5yn,t3_etg2yj,1580182986.0,is there an easy way to see what your missing from an imported deck?   i chould find a way short of just reemoving red lines till i had a count of how many of each type I was short.     Looking at some budget  decks to try while i wrap my head around deck building in this game.
LegendsOfRuneterra,ffsiv1t,t3_euuf71,1580182770.0,"all ccgs have some amount of pay to win.   i have only but a handful of hours into the game but I am liking the system MUCH more then most digital CCGS  

1.  Lots of freebies for playing AI to complete quests and not  getting curb stomped using the starters.,

2. Decent stater pack I droped  $20 bucks in to say ok Riot i'll bite and get the pack..  Not sure on when i will buy wildcards we will see.    

3.  No melt down 20 cards to make 1 of same rarity bullcrap.    

4.  Buy able wildcards are a great idea when you just need a few more specific cards for your design but a weekly limit to keep people from just buying everything. while not having to buy a ton of packs to home you get what you need or melt down enough crap to get what you need.

5. Wild card prices are NOT INSANE there is no $50 rare cards.    Champ cards are the most expence at 6 bucks each and a deck is only going to have a hand full of them."
