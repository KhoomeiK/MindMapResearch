1. Incredibly relaxed in position
2. No wasted movement
3. Incredibly accurate
4. Which allows him to put all his power into his strikes

He's one of the few fighters that does in the ring exactly what he does in training.  We usually have great form and technique while working the bag, but then get all weird when fighting a human.  His secret is he treats his opponents like a bag and hits first and then stays in control of the flow that he started."

AskReddit,ffcjs9v,t3_esr647,1579800960.0,Cleaning rooms.  Marine Corps inspections for several years makes you excellent at it.  But doing it right is a lot of work.
aww,ffcjhgj,t1_ffchjjr,1579800778.0,"I think 2 to 3 feet at most?  I found this -  This squat, heavy-bodied snake reaches a maximum length of **3 feet** (**90 cm**), but 2 feet (60 cm) is more typical. 

That's what I was thinking.  Usually 2 feet.  3 feet would be a monster one.  If it's 3 feet long, I'd be wary that it's something else and not as friendly."
aww,ffbomu9,t1_ffb1r6d,1579775955.0,"Yep!  Just be careful of copperheads and rattlesnakes at the same time.  Carry a stick with you.  The first thing you'll notice is the upturned nose and it will flatten out it's neck when messed with.  They also will rattle its tail against dry leaves, which sounds a lot like a rattlesnake."
gadgets,ffaplsk,t3_esf62j,1579741515.0,Thank god.  These giant phones are for people who just sit around and don't actually do anything.  I don't want a stupid ipad or laptop in my pocket while I'm riding my bike or going for a jog.
