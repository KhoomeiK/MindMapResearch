Eloping,fd2v0ov,t3_ejorbk,1578151855.0,"My mom was abusive growing up and I have since cut her out of my life. Kind of one of our big reasons for eloping. But I did invite her to dress shopping and it was actually one of the very few times in my life that we got along and she was supportive.

If your dad has always been your greatest support, why not invite him too? No need for tradition. My advice would be to bring both of them so they can be a part of the process in some way, even if you want to elope. Maybe even go out to lunch afterward."

bipolar,fctowmp,t1_fctnt3u,1577952098.0,"Thank you, I think that's true honestly. I think they can pick up on how much I love them. Every time I meet someone with a dog who ""just doesn't like people/strangers,"" the dog likes me. It was a source of pride for me for a long time that maybe I wasn't as bad of a person as I thought I was. I hope he's doing well and being loved in his new home."
bipolar,fctnkqj,t3_eiry15,1577950310.0,"This looks EXACTLY like a dog I rescued, not adopted like actually got off the streets and brought to a shelter. I was homeless at the time and couldn't have a dog, but we were on a long drive at a gas station in the middle of nowhere and this dog was running around with fleas and he looked hungry and he was such a good dog and I asked around to everyone if they knew who he belonged to and the gas station person said he was a stray and just wandered around. I told my boyfriend at the time that I wasn't going to get in the car and go home without the dog. I was going to get him food and water and bring him to a really great shelter where I live, which I did. I was volunteering there a few weeks later and saw he had been adopted by a family that looked great. I had named him Rusty and they kept the name which made me happy.

Looking back I think I was trying to offer this dog something that I couldn't offer myself at the time. Thanks for sharing a photo, it brought up a very pleasant memory for me. Your pup is adorable and has beautiful eyes, you're very lucky."

People were drawn to me when I went out in public, not just that guy. It feels self-centered saying that? But it's not like I am that way normally. Normally I can walk around and have most people not notice me. I prefer it that way. I don't like this. I don't want strangers in gas stations drawn to me while stressing out all the people I actually care about."

JUSTNOFAMILY,fcof2l1,t1_fclmrqw,1577830686.0,"I bought $50 of art supplies the other day. Basic sketching pencils and acrylic paints. Nothing like the set up I used to have with a studio and easel and oil paints (I miss you oil paint!). But I'm starting over. I was looking over my sketchbooks from high school and was amazed by how talented I was. I still have the last painting I ever did, it's unfinished. I'm not sure if I should start with a new one or try to finish the last one. I do own a guitar, it's signed by one of my favorite musicians but I would play it anyway instead of keeping it on a shelf. I know they wouldn't want me to do that. They'd want me to make art. Even if it's bad.

Listening to music has been my re-entry into my artistic side. I have learned 4 instruments, have made art in so many ways, I literally have a degree in graphic design. I haven't made art in years, in any way shape or form. I don't even fucking doodle anymore. I need it."

I've been doing a lot of personal inventory and realizing that when I was younger I was probably a narcissist. I was not a good person. My husband showed me what real love was and changed my life forever. I always tell him how he saved me and I owe him my life and he thinks I'm just trying to be sweet. He really did save my life.

My grandma I love is on my dad's side. There are many things he is better at than me. Better golfer, better cook. Can out drink me. Has more money than me.

But when it comes to a nasty blowup? Making a scene? Being dramatic? I will out do him every single time. Nothing would stop me from being there. If he wants to make a scene, I will give him a scene to remember. If there is one thing that the abuse permanently changed about me, it isn't pain or trauma. I am one dramatic motherfucker. He cares what everyone thinks about him and doesn't like being embarrassed. I don't give a fuck and nothing embarrasses me. I like to think if I went to the funeral, he'd be the one afraid of me.

And then my brain was like DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY? like i responded to so many people sharing so many stories. this was fucking abuse, no one other word for it. 

I feel no guilt with their consequences. My earliest memories are of me telling them that if they didn't stop treating me this way and talking to me this then I would grow up and never talk to them again. They didn't care then, they didn't care when I went limited contact, they didn't care when I'd go months or years no contact and come back. They never gave a single fuck. I don't want to be harassed or contacted, but sometimes I kind of wish they would cause it would mean they at least care at all? Even in a negative way? I'm literally nothing to them. Neither of them responded to what I said. Nothing. I guess I shouldn't have expected a response since it was so angry and heated. But still. If someone I loved sent me a message saying they were that hurt and broken and fucked up, I would AT LEAST apologize. That's my downfall every time. Expecting them to act like a normal fucking person. It will never happen. I feel a lot better already. I can't wait to enjoy it. 2020!!!!!! Thank you <3"

I learned the other day that that same intimacy can come from a family member. I had a complete and total breakdown in front of my cousin-in-law and his girlfriend. We were good friends but he had never seen me at my lowest. My hysterical, screaming, sobbing, pleading with god to make it stop, lowest. I stepped outside to get fresh air and just sat down on the patio and kept sobbing. Someone came outside and sat down next to me and held me in the most intimate, tender, and loving way. I sobbed into their shoulder as they held me and stroked my face and hair and pushed their face into my neck. It was so loving. When I finally looked up, it wasn't my husband. It was his cousin. My family. No romantic or sexual feelings. We are family. I had never been held like that by anyone who wasn't my husband. When I would look up to yell and scream out something else traumatic that was on my mind he would let go a little, but when I stopped talking and started crying again he would keep holding me tight. Eventually his girlfriend grabbed my hand, he grabbed the other. They both held out their other free hand to my husband and we all held hands in a circle in this moment of silence where I knew that every person there was there for ME. They wanted me to be ok. They wanted to see me happy. When we finally all let go, he looked at me and said ""I am going to go buy you a pizza. Do you like cheese? I'll be right back. Go get in bed and get cozy."" so my husband and I went upstairs and collapsed from the exhaustion of dealing with this day after day. Cousin came back with pizza, we ate pizza in bed and laughed and reminisced. When he got up to leave I told him he was my favorite cousin and he told me I was his favorite cousin-in-law. Not only am I loved by so many, I am literally loved by a family member as much as my husband, my soulmate, loves me. In a totally platonic, family way. I never knew that was possible. 

Not only have I found my person, he comes with a huge family of 100+ people who are equally as kind, funny, caring, supportive, and fun. Why did I spend all this fucking time wishing my parents loved me when they are terrible people? I am not just cutting ties, I am fucking upgrading!!!!!!!!!"

JUSTNOFAMILY,fcl22g4,t1_fckzrhw,1577738117.0,"Both of my parents have narcissistic personality disorder. They are divorced and my entire life have accused the other one of being the true narcissist. Plot twist, they both are! My dad is classic textbook charming and fun narcissist and my mom is the covert insecure narcissist, constantly self-deprecating so you will reassure them how great they are. They were married for 10 years but have been complaining about the marriage for 20. At a certain point, when do you let go? Like either you guys move on from your divorce TWENTY YEARS AGO or i'm fucking leaving. I mean, you were literally abusive my entire life so I'm leaving no matter what, but maybe I could help you resolve at least ONE of the many, many, many fucked up things about you guys before I go.

I am already surprised at how much I can do. I had NO idea how much trauma was killing me every day. I am feeling so creative and wanting to exercise and be better to my husband and friends and family (inlaws/my better family). I worked on the self-love first, then cut them out. I think it was easier that way for me. I already loved myself and knew I didn't fucking need them for anything anymore when I cut them off. I don't have the doubt or fear when I stopped talking to them briefly when I hated myself.

I feel you on feeling nothing. When my mom's dad died I didn't feel a thing. We weren't estranged, I just feel like he was a really shitty person who never made an effort to acknowledge that I was even in his house for a week at a time, let alone be a grandfather. How the fuck are you a grandfather of a 7 and 5 year old if the only, the ONLYYYYYYY toys in your entire fucking house are for your cat. Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, you name it, dude was a shitty person. For my 12th birthday he bought me a book about how xenophobia isn't a bad thing. My grandparents I actually like redid their entire basement when my cousins and I were young so we had a huge toy room, then when we got older, they put it back to normal.

I'm really looking forward to milestones. The first year of no contact with both of them. Sounds really exciting honestly. I don't miss them, I don't wish they loved me, I'm fucking glad they didn't, because the people who love me now love me better than they ever fucking could."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fcl1ai7,t1_fckyf99,1577737642.0,"How does everyone else know that the world LITERALLY changes colors???? I thought I was fucking crazy but every person who has been through this has said the same thing. I'm an artist who went to school for graphic design, if someone had told me I'd see color better I would have done this years ago lmao.

I feel like I am mostly past the painful times. I got everything out. It's all unpacked. Now where to put all this emotion and memories? You are right that the world is super fucking confusing. My entire fucking life is a lie. I have no idea who I really am. What I really want. What I can really offer. How people really feel about me. I'm 25 years old and I'm literally learning all of this for the first time. It is so fucking confusing!!!!!!!! Every day I'm just constantly amazed. The most random things don't trigger trauma anymore, they trigger these PROFOUND life realizations where I'm like ""Ohhhh.... So THAT'S why I've always done that."" or ""I knew my parents didn't talk like that, I didn't realize I had picked it up from watching this show.""

It's so weird how EASY it is to understand why I'm feeling the way I'm feeling and what I'm *actually* upset about. We ordered pizza delivery yesterday, but I put the wrong phone number in the contact form. The driver couldn't find our house, couldn't get a hold of us, so he just left. I kept standing outside in the cold thinking maybe if I waited long enough, they would come around the block. Maybe they would come back with the food. My husband said ""Honey, let's go inside. They're not coming back."" And it hit me that I didn't give a fuck about the pizzas. I wasn't even that hungry. I was realizing my parents are never, ever going to fucking apologize or change or even ACKNOWLEDGE that they did anything wrong. 

**Am I the only one who the last straw was something so small?** It wasn't being hit, it wasn't being homeless, it wasn't any of the horrible things they've said to me that I can't even repeat here. It was something so casual. My dad said he sent me a thousand dollars and sent my husband $400. This is what he fucking does. He is an abusive evil piece of shit, but he is an abusive evil piece of shit who happens to be a millionaire. He thinks he can buy whatever he wants, including a place in my life. ""Some people are so poor, all they have is money."" My husband thanked him from both of us, I haven't been talking to him, though I hadn't gone no contact yet. Just avoiding him. So we checked my bank account, surprise, didn't send a thousand dollars. Didn't even send a single dollar. 

I don't give a fuck about the money, not at all. I hate it. I despise it. I grew up in one of the wealthiest areas in California. My friends lived in mansions that were literally $25 million. Everyone was fucking fake and miserable. Just horrible. I hated every second of it. My husband is from a small suburb of St. Louis that is very ...let's say ""affordable"" to live in. I love it. There is a strong sense of community. People care about local elections. They talk to their neighbors instead of literally hiding behind gated communities.

I don't care about the money. I care that even when I have him blocked on facebook and I'm ignoring his messages, he weasels his way into my life and finds a way to hurt me. Why send a message SAYING you sent a thousand dollars if you really didn't? So I asked my husband to message him and say ""Why would you say you sent her a gift when you didn't?""

My dad explains that he sent me $1,000 of MY OWN MONEY THAT HE STOLE FROM ME IN NOVEMBER, so that's what he's counting as a Christmas present. Also the $400 he sent my husband? Not from him, my grandma sent it to us and he took credit for it because my grandma doesn't know how to send money online. He sends at least 10 texts, screenshots, explanations, just goes on and on and on. The man could talk forever about fucking money. I don't give a fuck. I just thought you wanted to send me a gift and finding out you only wanted to trick me and hurt me fucking hurts.

My husband is a very thoughtful and articulate man. He prides himself on saying exactly what he means in a very tactful way (the opposite of me basically.) So he takes a few minutes to type out this message to my dad saying basically ""It's shitty to take credit for a gift that isn't yours, or claim it's a gift to give her her own money back that you took. She doesn't care about the money, she just wants you to love her like a father. I know you are very disappointed in her, you've made that very clear. But she is still your daughter and she still deserves for you to show at least a little love to her, even if you don't want to. She deserves it.""

My dad sent back ""**I don't know what you're talking about.** If she wants to talk to me, she can call me tomorrow."" I saw it over his shoulder and immediately my blood started to boil. My husband quickly shot back ""She doesn't want to talk to you."" and my dad just said ""Ok""

I went ballistic. Absolutely insane. I think I very nearly lost my sanity permanently in that moment. I grabbed the phone said ""Hey it's squigglybean, turns out I do want to talk."" and said everything I had been waiting to say for 25 years and I will never speak to him again.

Fucking ""I don't know what you're talking about"" WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR 25 YEARS YOU STUPID MOTHER FUCKER. and just the ""ok."" my parents are the king and queen of ""ok."" Never did I think a two-letter word could be used so maliciously. It's honestly a little impressive. I type out pages and pages of the most hateful things I've ever said in my life but he will still hurt me more with two letters. Motherfucker. I'm an aries, I don't like to lose. That's why I no longer want to play a game where the objective is to be as mean as humanly possible and destroy as many lives in the process while still making strangers and neighbors think you're the nicest/coolest person ever."

My husband (boyfriend of 2 months at the time) would sneak me into the house every night because they said ""we aren't comfortable with your girlfriend moving in"" (now that i'm an adult i understand where they were coming from.) He literally stole from them to feed me. Like stole hundreds of dollars to buy me food and medicine and clothes. They would punish him and scream at him because he was being the most disrespectful and sneaky and awful he had ever been to them, just a horrible kid. Literally robbing his parents to provide for me. But he was doing it to be the absolute best support system for me. He loved me so much and felt so sorry that I had a bad relationship with my parents, he was willing to give up his wonderful relationship with his to keep me safe and happy. It took several years for them to reconnect and even longer for them to accept that I wasn't going anywhere. Sorry, your daughter-in-law is an ex-hobo! Stuck with me :)

It is only a very, very small resentment. I know she was trying to do the best she could. I just think she could have done better if she opened her mind up a little bit. I am a good person. I am a good daughter-in-law. She loves me very much and I love her very much. But I think most people would hesitate if their son brought home a homeless, bipolar, traumatized, tattooed, pierced girl with a foul mouth who cries a lot.

But when I was 17, she kicked me out of the house for the night and I decided I wouldn't come back. I was homeless for several months. Slept in cars, outside in parks in dangerous neighborhoods, on the side of a house hidden by trees, and my least favorite, on the concrete floor of my husband's parent's basement with cockroaches crawling over me. I turned 18 while homeless. Don't remember what I did, but I can guarantee you I ate a fucking $1 McDonald's cheeseburger for my birthday dinner. It was what I ate every day. Every one suggests ramen or like rice but I am fucking homeless, I don't even have a car. I don't have running water or a microwave or anything. I was dating a guy who would end up being my husband, he barely knew me at the time, we had just met. But he took care of me and supported me and fed me. 

Not to mention my earliest memory of being a toddler with one of those giant plastic ""exploration play things"" that are supposed to teach you colors and shapes and just how to explore with your hands. I was maybe 3 or 4 and I don't know what made her so angry, but my mom picked it up and threw it at me. 4 years old.

I was maybe 6 years old? Young enough to still be showering with my lil sister who was 4 and it wasn't weird yet. The shower door was a giant glass door. My mom was pissed off and she slammed the door and both glass doors shattered all around us. I was terrified, we had to lay down towels to get out of the shower safely but ALL I FUCKING CARED ABOUT was that my dog didn't have glass in her paw. Even at that young age I had already internalized that I had somehow deserved this, but the dog definitely didn't. Fucking sucks. Like how can you tell someone that story and not have them pity you? I don't want pity. I want a fucking drink. It's 1pm and I've been up all night and I just want a drink. 

The idea that not only did this trauma ruin my life, ruin my self-esteem, made me hate myself, put an awful ""inner critic"" in my thoughts, but yeah it's also going to give me chronic pain conditions and kill me quicker. Kind of like the bipolar that is supposedly both genetic and triggered by stress or trauma, so thanks for that one too mom & dad!"

This was my first Christmas no contact at all. No matter how limited or even not at all our communication was, I always said Merry Christmas. Every fucking year. I always said it first. This year I said nothing. They said nothing. I mean fucking nothing to them and always have. It hurt. I almost started crying when I was watching my husband and his parents and brother make breakfast on Christmas morning like a real family. Presents that morning were hard. My MIL always gets the MOST thoughtful and heartfelt gifts. One year my birth mother got me a Dr. Who license plate cover. I had never seen Dr. Who and I didn't own a fucking car. So the thoughtful gifts remind me of what I never had, even if I have it now, my brain is still hardwired in my DNA and biology to crave the people who made me. We went to his mom's side of the family and it was nice. I felt a little better. People were really sweet.

And then we went to his dad's side. Wooooooo. This is my family I love the most. They are the craziest, most loving, most fun people you will EVER fucking meet. They love so hard it's insane. We were running a little late, so when we walked in the door, everyone there cheered like we were Mick Jagger walking into the house. There was no tree. There were no decorations. There was only enough food to keep you from leaving or getting too drunk. We exchanged small gifts very quickly for less than 10 minutes, and then spent hours and hours just drinking and smoking and laughing and telling stories and reconnecting and sharing our struggles and offering support. We told his cousin that we had been struggling to organize our house. The next morning him and his girlfriend came over and literally Marie Kondo'd our house. Then they bought us pizza. I mean, like the best family you could ever ask for. I finally told everyone that I don't just ""not get along with my parents"" that they are literally abusive. It was the first time I had used that word to people who weren't close friends. It felt so validating and made it real. People were so concerned and supportive.

I don't want to come off as bragging at all. I know not everyone has this. Not every one can just replace your biological family with a better one. But I spent 25 years hoping and dreaming and praying for that moment and when it finally came it was even better than I ever thought it could be. That is partially what gave me the strength to do this. I wouldn't be alone if I did it."

Carried my entire fucking life in a duffel bag. Didn't have a toothbrush, didn't have a hairbrush, didn't have any medicine. I slept outside, in cars, on the sides of houses, and my least favorite, the concrete floor of my husband's parent's house in the coal room, where I felt cockroaches climbing over me. She still told me my mom loved me and ""I'm sure you guys can work it out."" She doesn't get it. She doesn't understand when I tell her. That's why I told my husband this is his problem now.

I was in such a fog from PTSD that I literally don't remember two months of my life. Only tiny bits and pieces. 8 fucking weeks, and all I have are tiny bits and pieces. I remember going to Olive Garden. I remember making my mother-in-law cry as she begged me not to hurt myself, to take care of myself because so many people loved me, my husband loves me, she loves me, the whole family loves me. I could hear that she was talking. Logically I could understand the words she was saying. But they just didn't process. It felt like she was so far away. She was like a foot in front of me, it felt like several miles. I hated myself more than I've ever hated myself in my entire fucking life. My husband told me that if a stranger or a cashier tried to make light conversation with me, I would start talking about how I was worthless and didn't deserve anything and how much I hated myself. It's so embarrassing to think that not only I did that, but I don't remember. What I do remember I was literally about to kill myself every waking moment of every single day. I tried, several times. Day after day, I tried every single day to kill myself for a week straight. THANK FUCKING GOD IT DIDN'T WORK. I told myself the day after Christmas I was going to take every dollar I got for Christmas and get a gun and finally end it for real. Every person in my life was reaching out and telling me how much they loved me and needed me around and how nothing would ever be the same without me and it meant absolutely fucking nothing to me. My husband would sob and sob and break down and beg me not to leave him on this planet alone and I felt nothing. Nothing but fucking hatred for myself. It was all that I felt, day after miserable fucking day. Deep, intense, miserable hatred. My husband called my therapist and told him what was going on. My therapist missed his family Christmas party to come in on literally Christmas Eve and give me the most intense therapy session I've ever had. Normally he is a very chill guy, laid back, we just kind of chat about stuff. This time he was leaning forward, in my face telling me I had to love myself or I was going to die. You could literally hear the desperation in his voice. This man was my high school's emotional guidance counselor. He basically raised me from 13-18. It was one thing to see that my friends and family were worried and scared for me. To see my therapist, this person who has known me for 12 years and seen me at my lowest lows, to see HIM scared and worried for me made me fucking snap out of it. I went home and confronted that ""inner critic"" in my head. The inner monologue in my head that feels like my parents have moved into my brain. The voice that said foul, evil, hateful, violent things to me every day. Repeating every message my parents had ever tried to convey. I lost it. I was literally screaming at nothing, an empty apartment, talking to this ""voice in my head"" that's actually my own thoughts, telling it to fuck off, I don't need this anymore, I'm a good person, I deserve better, I deserve happiness, I deserve to be loved. Fuck off, this isn't who I am, this isn't who I want to be. Finally I imagined myself talking to my parents and I told them they had no right to linger in my head when I was the one who left THEM, not the other way around. I left and I went my own way. I built my own life. I made my own home. I came up with my own traditions. I have my own family heirlooms now. I screamed fuck you, leave me alone. And then I was quiet. And my brain was quiet. The ""inner critic"" felt like it was gone. It was the absolute, most bat-shit insane I've ever felt in my life. I have bipolar and I've done some fucked up shit, this was by far the craziest I've ever felt. I now call it my ""Smeagol"" moment (if you've seen lord of the rings).

After that, all of this trauma started bubbling up. That was Christmas Eve, the 24th. It's the 30th now and every second I've been awake has been spent unpacking trauma or learning something new about my life, why I did the things I did, who were the real influences on my life (plot twist, it's Billie Joe Armstrong), healing, loving myself, spreading the most love and joy and happiness I've ever felt in my life. Every where I go I make people cry tears of happiness. Strangers. It's the weirdest fucking thing that has EVER happened to me. Ever. It's so strange and new and uncomfortable and comfortable at the same time. I look in the mirror and I think I look beautiful. I'm telling my husband things that I have never told a single soul. Things I thought I would take to my grave. I'm telling people I love how I truly feel about them on a deep and personal and intimate level that makes everyone around me deeply uncomfortable but also happy and I can't stop. I can't stop talking. 25 years of repressed emotions and memories and understanding and it's all coming out IN ONE FUCKING WEEK. I swear to god, if the stress didn't kill me, how overwhelming this all has been just might.

Please never think that I am somehow stronger or more confident or love myself more than you could. There is nothing special about me. I am just another person from another broken home. I had never met anyone who felt as hopeless as I did. My husband has been told by AT LEAST 20 different people during our relationship that he needed to leave because I was broken beyond saving. He couldn't fix me. FUBAR. Well I'm still fucking here. I'm still breathing. None of this shit killed me. I am stronger. I love myself so fucking much I could burst into tears at any given moment of the day. I am healing. I am unpacking a lifetime worth of trauma and I only found it by hitting the absolute rock bottom of my life. If you want to skip all the bullshit and memory loss and suicide attempts and making everyone in your life constantly cry and worry about you here are the things my therapist told me to do. 

1. Spread love to everyone. Everyone you meet. Give an infinite amount of love. It is already inside you.
2. Eventually that love is going to trickle down or come back to yourself.
3. Exercise for 30 minutes a day. Any more might help you get fitter, but 30 minutes of walking is all you need for the best endorphin rush.
4. Make art.
5. You deserve love too.

Here's my own advice. Picture yourself talking to your family/parents/whoever has hurt you. Picture saying everything you've ever wanted to say to them. Don't picture their reaction. Just focus on what it looks like when you say it to them. What it feels like when you imagine saying it. Repeat the phrase ""There's only now, there's only here, give into love or live in fear, no other past, no other way, no day but today."" Over and over and over and over again until you start to feel better. I literally sang it every where I went. Loudly. People stared at me. I didn't care. One girl thought I was going to murder her because I was walking behind her and singing loudly. She literally took off running in the other direction. I still didn't care. I went to a concert of my favorite band and for the first time in my life I actually lived the phrase ""dance like no one is watching"" and I sang my fucking heart out until the people around me were annoyed, and I didn't care. I was going to take up as much space as I needed. Keep talking. Keep talking until you have nothing to say. Whether you are talking to a therapist, a friend, a loved one, a pet, a stuffed animal, reddit, yourself, a blog, a journal, it doesn't matter. Take what you feel inside and put it outside yourself by saying it out loud. Keep singing loudly every where you go. Love everyone around you, everyone you meet, like they are your new best friend. Tip well at restaurants. As much as you can. A comical amount. An amount that makes your husband scoff and walk off without you because he thinks it's too much money. It's not. If you make the server cry and hug you, you're doing great. Tell yourself you have NOTHING BUT LOVE for yourself and everyone around you. Nothing but love and acceptance and honesty and non-judgment for everyone around you. Build yourself up to your absolute highest point. The most you've ever loved yourself.

Then realize that nothing they can ever do will make it worth it to stay in their lives. Nothing. They could have offered me millions of dollars for 5 more minutes of their time. It wouldn't have changed anything. Take the time to write a message to them explaining EXACTLY how you feel. Exactly how hurt you are, exactly how fucked up you are, and how they are to blame. It will be angry. It will be mean. It will be hurtful. That's ok. You already had those feelings inside you. You're letting them out for the first time and it's going to be super overwhelming but also feel really good. Send the message. Block the number. Block every number. Block them on every social media. Block them in every way shape or form you can, and never, ever fucking look back.

tl;dr: save yourself the struggle and additional trauma and cut them out before it gets worse. love is the answer. sorry it's such a goddamn cheesy answer. i didn't decide it. i would have gone with something cooler."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fcko783,t1_fckjzf5,1577729589.0,"I feel the same. The only regret I have is that I didn't do it as soon as I could. I could have figured out a way to make it work.

Thank you. I have the most wonderful therapist. I met him when I was 13. He was the emotional guidance support counselor at my school. We had such a reputation for troubled and depressed kids that we had a regular counselor for like bullying and teacher issues, a college counselor for applications, and then basically a therapist on staff. I spent most days in his office crying about my mom. He has seen and witnessed the entire process. He tells me that I'm wonderful and special and that it's a treat to talk to me when I come in. He gives me hugs and tells me he loves me. He adores my husband. When my mom sent him an email asking if she could come in and discuss with him ""what she thought my issues were"" he told me and asked what I wanted him to do. He said he could either ignore it completely or he could straight up tell her how inappropriate it was and how that's not how he does therapy nor will it ever be. I asked him to ignore it. She doesn't need to know how much other people love me. She doesn't get to witness that or be a part of it. He's really been such a huge father figure for me. It always sounds weird when I type it out, but you can't really have a ""normal"" therapy relationship with someone who basically raised you from 13-18 in his office every day. I cannot WAIT to tell him I finally did it. I know he will be so proud of me. He's been encouraging me to do this for years. He always told me my day would come and that I just had to be patient even though it was horrible and he wished he could make it stop. In a way, I think he did. I know I did it myself, but I couldn't have done it without him. So many people I couldn't have done this without. Even people I've never met nor will I ever meet. Musicians, Carrie Fisher, Tolkien. I wish there was some way I could ever repay everyone, but there's just too many.

There I go with the word vomit. Can't help myself. It's all spilling out. I'm not taking one single piece of this emotional baggage with me into 2020. Leaving it all in the past where it belongs. A new decade. The idea of 10 years without them in my life sounds so great."

My grandpa(inlaw) was wonderful. I had been dating my husband for less than a month and he invited me to the family Easter. We dyed eggs together. It became our thing. Every year, dying eggs. If we forgot that year he'd ask me why we didn't dye eggs. If we did, he'd ask why we didn't do more. He called me ""my girl."" Every time my husband and I would visit him he'd say ""There's my girl!"" and give me a huge hug. One time we took him to a doctor's appointment about an hour away from his house. When we finally brought him home, he grabbed my hand and told me it was ""nice to have a womanly touch on the trip."" One year it was his birthday and I wanted to give him something, but I had just moved out of my mom's house, eating ramen for every meal kind of broke. I found an old piece of scrap paper from a notebook, folded it up, and quickly wrote happy birthday on it with a highlighter. I wrote something kind but not super sweet on the inside. When he passed away, my MIL told me he had kept the card with him ever since, even when he moved into assisted living. He kept in next to a photo of my husband and I along with his other grandchildren. My husband jokes that he liked me more (which is crazy, he loved EVERYONE in his family this much). He was the first person to show me what a real family could be like. I am grateful for so many memories and photos with him. 

Thank you. It's not just support through my family and reddit and therapy. I have listened to every song, watched every movie, and read every quote that ever helped me survive this shit. It felt like a good way to honor how much they saved me before I met my husband and real family (inlaws)."

I had all this love inside me that I was desperately trying to give to my parents who didn't want it. Now that I'm giving it to other people and myself, it's so fucking overwhelming to everyone. I'm messaging friends from high school telling them my favorite memories, the things they did that mattered so much to me that I couldn't explain at the time. THIS IS THE LOVE MY PARENTS DIDN'T WANT. When I was 11 years old my dad brought me and my best friend out to LA to visit. We were staying in a crazy expensive resort, there were a lot of celebrities there, none that I knew of at 11, like older classic people like Donnie Osmond. He told us to be on our absolute best behavior because we were in a fancy place (and also because the only thing he cares about in this entire world is what rich people think of him). So naturally what does my friend do? Cannonball into the pool, splashing some girls who were tanning, and starts screaming ""I LOVE BUKKAKE!!!!!!!"" over and over again at the top of her lungs. She didn't know what it meant, she had an older brother and she heard it from him talking with his friends. She just thought it was a funny word. He couldn't do SHIT to her, because she was someone else's kid. I've never seem him so humiliated and angry and not been able to do a single thing about it. I told her that was one of my favorite memories. She was able to hurt him in a way I could never without being slapped in the face. And we laughed about it the rest of the trip which made him angrier and angrier. I told her that many people, like myself, run out of fucks to give, but she was born without them. 

""Bathed in Technicolor"" ""new and wondrous"" ""born again"" ""like a fairy tale"" these are not exaggerations, this is LITERALLY how I feel. The world actually has more color in it. I know I sound like I'm on drugs or I've lost my mind but I swear to god, everything is more bright and vibrant. I smell things better. I feel things better. Food tastes better. Everything is fucking better. I get the feeling you've done this before :) I told my husband that the peace and love I felt in my heart felt like heaven on earth. I also told him that while watching a baby deer take it's first steps is precious and wonderful, it's a little disconcerting when it's an adult woman learning how to be a human being at the age of 25. There's a Carrie Fisher quote I like that's something like ""My version of Heaven may be different from most people's, but I swear, when it's quiet, sometimes I can hear the angels singing.""

If anyone thinks these comments are long, just know that my poor, sweet, loving husband has listened to me talk for every waking second of every day for at least two weeks. I mean, literally nonstop. Tonight when I finally cut ties and was free, I talked nonstop, NONSTOP, for 7 hours. He listened the entire time. He tells me every day he is happy to be here and happy to listen and tells me not to stop letting it out. If I talked to my mom for 7 minutes straight she would tell me to shut the fuck up, that no one cared what I had to say. This man is listening to me talk for 7 hours straight, non-stop. I feel so bad for him honestly. I've been trying to secretly plan a weekend getaway for him to go visit his cousins/best friends in Nashville just the boys. He needs a fucking break. I'm taking him to get a pedicure too. Love that I married a man who likes pedicures more than sports. Life is so fucking good. I keep thinking about more stuff that will never happen now that they're gone. I'll never have to spend another father's day sitting on my phone while my dad watches golf all day and doesn't say a word to me. I'll never have to explain any mistakes to them. I'll never have to hear them shit talk each other!!! 20 fucking years you've been divorced!!! Stop fucking talking about it and move the fuck on!!! Jesus."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fckjh8g,t1_fckgxxg,1577726678.0,Yeah I've been trying to come up with a solution for years but I've got nothing. It's been the thing that has kept me in contact with my mom for a long time. I love him. He's a great guy. Very sweet. But he's not worth dying over. And this shit was killing me.
JUSTNOFAMILY,fckgz7j,t1_fcke9fs,1577725112.0,"Last December after a week of my parents telling me I wasn't really sick, I needed to stop being lazy and go to work, I needed to be responsible and an adult ""for once in my life"", I went to urgent care anyway. I thought I had the worst flu of my life. As soon as I was examined at urgent care, I was rushed into the emergency room, given Fentanyl, told that my gallbladder was so inflamed that it was pushing on my liver and my liver was failing. I needed emergency surgery as soon as possible. No doctor or nurse said it out loud, but it felt like I was going to die. I have never seen hospital staff move so quickly. My mom came to visit me in the hospital and take care of me, because of course she did! People were there to watch and comment on what a great mother I had. She was able to post about taking care of me to her friends. For the first time in years, I actually needed her for something. When I was recovering, she asked the doctor what could have caused this so severely. Normally the surgery I had is something you can schedule months in advance and prepare for. She wanted to know why it was so bad that my liver was failing. Guess what it was? Stress! She told me I ""obviously"" had inherited my dad's anxiety and immune system, because hers was perfect. She never gets sick! She hasn't been sick in 10 years! It just gets so fucking old you can't stand it. Like I just had emergency surgery and you're bragging to all the nurses about how *you* never get sick because you're so great. 

Honestly the absolute worst part, and I should have included this in my original post, was that even after I had moved out and gone limited contact, I still had their voice in my head. Constantly criticizing, constantly belittling me, putting me down, calling me names, telling me I'm worthless and no one loved me. I felt so hopeless that even if I cut them out of my life forever, they would always still be here in my head. I read that it was a common thing for people in my situation so I felt less crazy and knew I wasn't ""hearing voices"" or anything. But it still wouldn't stop. It got louder and louder, more hateful, angrier. Until one day, this week actually, that I fucking snapped. Out loud I started screaming back to this inner critic in my head, telling it was wrong, it had always been wrong, that I knew better, I saw through it's bullshit, that it could go fuck itself because I didn't need it anymore. I imagined myself talking directly to my parents and said out loud, to no one, in my empty house, that they had no right to linger in my head and make me feel like I was abandoned and unloved because I LEFT THEM, they didn't leave me. And then it was quiet. That was a week ago and I haven't had that inner critic in my head ever since. The way I talk to myself inside my head is so much more loving and positive and caring than it has ever been. I felt like a literal crazy person. I have bipolar and have been out of my mind before, but this was the craziest I had ever felt. (What causes bipolar they think? Genetic predisposition and it's triggered by stress/trauma. Thanks mom & dad! Of all the terrible gifts you've given me over the years, this is the worst) Screaming at no one, just a voice in my head, out loud in my empty apartment. I still feel crazy when I think about it. But it fucking worked. Now they're gone, the inner critic is gone, I love myself for the first time in my life and things feel hopeful. Suddenly all the other problems in my life are starting to fall into place. My marriage is stronger than I even thought it could be. My friendships are more meaningful. I'm deep cleaning my house. I'm exercising every day. I don't apologize for being myself or taking up space. I went to see my favorite band play (local band, I'm lucky enough to be friends with the guy and genuinely think he is my favorite musician) and sang my fucking heart out and danced like a crazy person and didn't give a shit what anyone thought of me. The woman in front of me was having a full-blown meltdown about it. Furious, shit-talking me to her husband, shooting me dirty looks. Exactly what my mom would have done. I ignored her, smiled back when she glared at me, and kept doing my thing. The next day the singer/guy I'm friends with sent me a message saying he saw me ""singing my heart out"" and that it was a really great feeling and that we should hang out again soon. Like how many people can get that message from the lead singer of their favorite band after a great concert? I feel blessed in so many ways, I'm so grateful for life and everything I get to experience now with PEACE AND FREEDOM AND LOVE.

Sorry this is even longer lol. It just feels so fucking good that they are gone forever, I am no longer ashamed to talk about the things they said and did or how absolutely insane I went trying to heal from it. The past two weeks I have been healing and dealing with trauma, but the 6 weeks before that? Literally no memory. None at all. It's like I missed a month and a half of my life. My husband keeps telling me about stuff that happened and I don't remember it all. He said I walked around like a zombie and never smiled once except these really creepy laughs when I was crying and I was the most miserable and angry he had ever seen me. Like scaring strangers and making people on the street uncomfortable when they saw me I looked so fucked up and broken. I feel so much better now and it's finally over, but jesus fucking christ, I had to hit literal, actual rock bottom before I was willing to make a change in my life. I hope someone reads this and decides to cut their family out before it gets to this point. No one deserves this. I certainly didn't.

UGH IT FEELS SO GOOD TO ADMIT THIS STUFF. I am so sorry for word vomiting all over this comment section everyone."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fckeqj4,t1_fck945h,1577723683.0,"There are only two people brave or ignorant enough to say that to me at this point. My mom's brother, my uncle, is autistic. He is very sweet and kind, the only person in my family who has ever called me. Sends me a card every year for every holiday since I was born. Now he sends my husband birthday cards too. He has told me my whole life to ""Listen to your mother."" He loves her so much, she treats him like shit and complains what a burden and inconvenience he is all the time. I could never explain it to him in a way he could understand. He is pretty independent with most stuff but just doesn't understand emotions. I've decided I have to go no contact with him as well, but I can't bring myself to tell him I'm never going to talk to him again. He loves me so damn much, he doesn't deserve this, it would break his heart and shatter him. I think it will be less painful for him to just assume I'm too busy to return his calls or send a thank you note. That breaks my heart. I'd rather it be me than him, I think I'm used to it by now.

The other person however, is my mother-in-law. She is the most amazing and loving mother anyone could ask for, she cannot understand or fathom how any mother could be as bad as I say she is. She constantly compares my situation to hers growing up with her father, who was a grumpy smart ass sometimes, but one of the kindest and most wonderful people I have ever known. He was the first person in my husband's family to treat me like actual family, before my husband. He was the one who insisted I be invited to family holidays even though we hadn't been dating a year, because I didn't want to spend them with my biological family. When other people in the family said I was too broken, too damaged, that I was ""too fucked up"" to marry my husband, he defended me and stood up for me and said that I was a good person who would find my way eventually. I didn't find out any of this until he had passed away. I hope he knows somehow how grateful I am for him. Anyways, the point is that he was a wonderful person who loved his children so deeply but occasionally pushed their buttons and drove them crazy with his demands about his wheelchair not being comfortable enough. Not comparable to abuse so severe you develop diseases from the stress. 

I told my husband that he is going to sit them down and explain to them in the harshest of terms that they are not just bad parents, they are not just ""showing love in their own way"", and that not everyone needs to love and take care of their parents. Not all parents deserve it. They were literally abusive, it will not be tolerated, and I will not tolerate being told I'm making the wrong decision. I told them to tell them that if they didn't respect that, it wouldn't be me who was screaming at them, it would be their son. And if all that doesn't make them understand, I told him to tell his mother about how my horrible bitch of a mother called my grandpa-in-law a ""rapist pedophile"" because of a photo with me and him on Christmas morning where his pants were too tight and you could see his crotch. To me it was a loving and memorable photo with my grandpa on Christmas morning, who had loved me for years, who had dressed up like Santa every year for the kids to the point that my husband literally believed his grandpa was the real Santa Clause. I was surrounded by family that not only loved me but wanted me there, beautiful homecooked meals, presents that were thoughtful and heartfelt for once in my life. But to my mom he was a rapist pedophile because he had tight pants on. I hate her so fucking much.

Ugh, I'm so sorry everyone these comments are so long. You really don't have to read all of them or respond to them at all if they're overwhelming long or annoying. I just need to get this out of my head and out in the world. Fuck them. Fuck them both. I'm better off without them."
ChoosingBeggars,fckdhdj,t1_fckcyr0,1577722873.0,I'm honestly not sure. You could be right. I don't know. What I do know is that this post is two weeks old and I'm done talking about Mother Teresa and Columbus and Gandhi and Nelson Mandela for the rest of my life after how many comments this got.
JUSTNOFAMILY,fckda7m,t1_fck71os,1577722748.0,"Thank you!!! They really, truly, don't know what a good thing feels like.

My parents are divorced and they despise each other. I mean, passionately hate each other to the point that it's been 20 years since they divorced, my dad remarried 10 years ago, and they still talk about the other person every. single. fucking. day. It's exhausting to be around that much toxicity even WITHOUT THE ABUSE. But my whole life I've wondered how could these two people who have absolutely nothing in common, who hate each other's guts, end up married? For 10 years? And have two children? I know now. The one thing they have in common is that they are bitter, evil, hateful, angry people. When they met, my dad was engaged to his high school sweetheart. My grandparents say she was lovely. My mom was dating the son of a CEO with a private plane who would personally fly her to romantic restaurants and showered her with love and affection. They left both of those people to be fucking miserable and angry and hateful together. Congratulations on your bad decision guys, you ruined my life for 25 years! My proudest accomplishment as a human is knowing that my husband loves me more than either of them have ever been loved in their life. There are a lot of people who have loved me and supported me more than my own parents, and I don't mean friends and family. I literally think of the cashier at my 7-Eleven as a father figure, he literally actually cares about me more than my parents do. I have a neighbor who is totally insane and a drug addict and believes in witchcraft, a character straight out of a wacky sitcom, and she loves me a billion times more than my parents ever did. It's not normal if strangers show you more affection and support than your parents!!!! Who knew??

Thank you for the hug. For most of my life I have hated being touched by others, with the exception of my husband. Now I want to hug and hold and high-five every person I meet."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fckcm8z,t1_fck37yx,1577722315.0,"Speaking very bluntly. If they are even half as toxic as my parents are, you will 10000000000000000% be better off without them. There is nothing they can offer you or can ever offer you that will be worth staying. My parents still have really valuable belongings of mine. They can keep them. My mom still has my cat I rescued. She can keep him. She always treated the animals a thousand times better than she treated me anyways. I will probably lose contact with both sides of my extended family and I mostly don't care. I love my grandma very much and don't want to lose her. As soon as I told my parents I was done, I sent her an email asking for her forgiveness, explaining that I had to do this to survive, telling her that I love her and want her in my life regardless of if her son is, but that I understand if she loves him too much to do that. I also have an uncle who is very autistic but very, very sweet. The kindest guy. He has sent me a card every year since I was born for my birthday, Easter, Christmas, Thanksgiving, my anniversary, when I got engaged, when I got married. Everything. He is the only family member I have whoever called me. He loves my mom so much, she's his baby sister. Every time I've seen him or talked on the phone he says ""Listen to your mother."" It hurts to know there is absolutely no way I can explain it to him and have him understand. So I have to go no contact with him as well. It breaks my fucking heart that he will continue to send cards every year and call, even if I don't answer. He sends cards to all his siblings and they never send one back or pick up the phone. He is always defending my mom and telling me to love and respect her, but she is so horrible to him. Always complaining that he is a huge burden and an inconvenience. One time he said something very emotional and sweet to me, which is unlike him. I know it probably took a lot for him to say. I tried to tell my mom how sweet I thought it was and she shot back ""Why don't you just fucking marry him then?"" What the fuck is wrong with her???? We are talking about my uncle related to me by blood and I haven't heard anyone say that since I was in 1st grade. What the fuck.

My point is. Even losing all of those things, even if they offered me billions of dollars, nothing would ever be worth it. Leave as soon as you possibly can. Cut all ties and never look back. I tried fucking everything. I tried reasoning with them. I tried having professionals explain it to them. I tried family therapy (mom left after the second session when the therapist pointed out she was being a tad passive-aggressive) I tried being the most loving, respectful, submissive, quiet, passive daughter I could ever possibly fucking be. I tried limited contact. I tried grey rock. I tried going no contact and coming back hoping it would be different this time. None of it fucking worked. This is the only option. I wish I had known that years ago and saved myself the trouble. I have been trying to run away for as long as I could remember. I asked my mom why I never got one of those little electronic cars for kids? I asked for one every year. They gave me all the other material bullshit I asked for but didn't really want. She laughed and said ""If we had bought you one, you would have ran away! Hahahaha!"" Like what is funny about the fact I've been non-stop constantly trying to run away from the time I was 5 till I actually moved out at 17? I have to stop asking these questions. I'm questioning it like ""How could a human being do this?"" and they are not human.

I'm sorry this message is so long. If you got this far, thank you. I've been awake for 24 hours because of how much adrenaline I have from sending those messages. 

**TL;DR:** Cut them out. You won't regret it. If you're going to do it, I highly recommend telling them over email or text EXACTLY how you feel about it. Don't sugar coat or tone down a single word. Speak honestly and truthfully about your life and your feelings, even if those feelings are pure hatred. That felt better than cutting them out did. Fuck em."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fckbcse,t1_fck3pay,1577721475.0,"Thank you. I had always read that and never loved myself enough to believe I was those things.

Even if he was really going to give me millions of dollars, it wouldn't be fucking worth it even a little bit.

I had this moment looking in the mirror about a week ago where for the FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I looked at myself and was like ""....I'm not ugly? I'm actually decently above average. I'm not a model but my face is very proportionate and I have pretty eyes. How have I literally never noticed what my own eyes look like?"" And I wasn't even happy or relieved I was just so confused. I literally thought I was horribly unattractive and ugly and just everything negative my entire life and it's not true? They told me I was ugly and looked like a homeless hag but I'm kind of pretty. They told me I was impossible or too difficult to love. Then why am I the only one in a happy marriage surrounded by friends and family and you guys are alone? They told me I was a horrible person. But I'm the one trying to make every person I meet happier than they were before they talked to me, trying to tip every server as much money as I have just to make their day, I'm the one trying to take action in my community for causes I care about. My mom told me I'm lazy and will never do anything with my life. Coming from the woman who has not had a job in fucking 25 years who only ""cooked"" frozen dinners and paid people to clean the house for her. I do all that shit on my own. The list goes on and on. There's a line in a Green Day song where the lyric is ""And I leave behind this hurricane of fucking lies."" That's how I fucking feel. I feel like my entire life as been a fucking lie and I'm suddenly seeing everything with brand new eyes for the first time and the world is a much better and kinder and more loving place than I ever believed it to be."

A few weeks ago when I was getting ready to do this, I had several legal documents drafted that made sure they were not only physically and emotionally and financially not in my life, they are legally not connected to me. I wrote a fucking will!!!! I'm 25 and don't even have a house or really any money to worry about. But I wanted to make sure that I died suddenly or unexpectedly before they did, I would be cremated and the ashes would be given to my husband so even if I was fucking dead they couldn't visit me.

Freedom feels so good. I don't know if you've ever seen LOTR (i'm a huge fan), but at the climax of the end of the music there's this scene where Frodo says it's done, it's over and Sam agrees. They lay down and Frodo smiles for the first time in most of the movie and says he can see the shire again, he can see the fireworks, he can smell the grass and taste the strawberries. I always knew I would have that moment whenever I watched the movies, and as soon as it was over and I could breathe again, I pulled that scene up on youtube and felt like it was me. 

There is also a specific song that I heard when I was in 5th grade. I told myself, that's how I'm gonna feel when I finally get the fuck out of here. I listened to that song tonight and it was so special for me.

My boyfriend of 2 weeks became my emergency contact when I was 17, he's now my husband. My mom used to pull that ""wellness check"" bullshit all the time when I first moved out. I'm very polite with the police, apologize for wasting their time, and explain the situation and it's never been an issue, only an inconvenience. She stopped doing it a long time ago. It would feel good if she tried some shit like that again, at least I would know what I said made her feel SOMETHING. Knowing that I can say all of this to her and cut her out of my life after warning her for 20 fucking years ""If you don't stop treating me and talking to me like this, I'm going to grow up and never talk to you again""? And she still doesn't feel a single emotion? It's not human."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fck95fh,t1_fcjtmsb,1577719943.0,"Honestly the healing came first. I went limited contact, lost my mind, isolated myself from everyone around me, hit absolute rock bottom and only then was I able to deal with and understand and heal from the trauma. I had a wonderful Christmas with my real family (inlaws), spent the next few days spreading as much love as I possibly could to every person around me. I tipped a waitress 50% on a $40 check and she cried and we literally held each other and cried together. I cleaned up nazi graffiti in my town. I messaged every friend I have ever had and told them that I still care about them and miss them, told them to say hello to their family and have a merry christmas. I ended every conversation I had with ""much love"". I repeated the line from rent (cheesy, I know) ""There's only now, there's only here, give in to love or live in fear, no other past, no other way, no day but today"" literally every where I went. Out loud. I sang it loudly as I walked around. I got tons of dirty and concerned looks and scared the shit out of a few people but I didn't care. I kept going until I knew I was a good and loving person. My husband sent a polite text trying to explain to my dad that all I wanted was for him to be a normal father and love me and that the way he had treated me over the years wasn't acceptable and it needed to stop. He responded with ""I don't know what you're talking about."" I absolutely lost it. Went ballistic. Took the phone and sent the most brutally honest and raw and emotional and angry and hateful message I could possibly think of to even scratch the surface of how they have made me feel. I told them to never contact me or my family again and blocked them. I also changed their names in my husband's phone to ""Satan"" and ""Miserable Hag."" It was petty but it felt good. 

I'm sorry this message is so long. This all happened around 2 in the morning, it's 9:30 now and I still haven't slept because I have so much adrenaline in me right now. 

If your parents are half as toxic as mine, I can promise you that in the long run, nothing they can offer you or provide for you will ever be worth the treatment. Nothing. My dad is extremely wealthy, lives in California, drives sports cars, just the most stereotypical evil rich douchebag you can think of, and he has always controlled me and manipulated me to stay in his life with this idea that ""Well when I die, I'm leaving you and your sister all of my money."" He would have never done it. But even if he did, even millions of dollars would not fucking be worth this. Losing my entire extended family on both sides isn't worth staying. Losing my important valuables that they never returned to me isn't worth staying. Fucking nothing. Ugh. AHHHHHHHHHHH. Fuck. I hate them so much.

Thank you for being happy for me. I'm happy for you too because I know one day you will feel this. My husband was falling asleep and I woke him up and made him a cup of coffee because I knew it was the most important moment of my life and I didn't want him to miss it. MUCH LOVE. Nothing but love. ""Lead with love"" as my therapist says. I wish you the happiest new year. Leave behind everything that makes you feel horrible inside."

Along with PTSD, I have developed so many medical problems I can't even count, and every time the doctor tells me it's caused by or made worse by stress.

It just hurts when you have to physically hold something in your hands that is proof another person either doesn't know you or doesn't care enough to think about you. One year my mom got me a Dr. Who license plate cover for a car. I have never watched Dr. Who and I didn't own a car at the time lmao. I can laugh about it now but it sucked at the time.
bipolar,fc5qbav,t3_egb2sh,1577463655.0,"I'm so sorry this happened to you, but very grateful it wasn't worse. I really think there needs to be a different type of first responder for mental health crisis. Even when police have taken me to the hospital, you have to listen to their bullshit first. ""We all struggle, everybody gets sad sometimes."" Excuse me while my eyes roll out the back of my head. Merry Christmas to you, glad you're back on your meds."
ChoosingBeggars,fc5q0hj,t3_efx2s2,1577463485.0,"I don't know how to do the cool ""remind me"" thing, but I need to know how this ends and if the photos are deleted. If my photographer had threatened to delete my wedding photos for any reason, I would have robbed a bank to make him happy."
90DayFiance,fc5pdg5,t3_eg91ot,1577463136.0,"I had read at least 50 posts about the she-shed before I watched the clip and I was still blown away. I've hated a lot of people on this show, but I think I could tolerate being around them for an hour or two. I wouldn't last 5 minutes with Tania."
90DayFiance,fc5p4vw,t3_eg5ok6,1577463003.0,I can't get over how she still has his last name. Everyone I've talked to who has been divorced says you can ask to have your name changed in the actual divorce papers with minimal effort.
90DayFiance,fc5ozkk,t3_eg61lz,1577462922.0,He knows more about pretty much everything compared to Tania
ChoosingBeggars,fc5mtm0,t3_eg409r,1577461717.0,Sometimes it hurts when you get a shitty gift because you feel like the person doesn't know you at all. My dad that I rarely saw as a kid got me a Jonas Brothers CD for Christmas one year. Felt shitty that he only saw me as a teenage girl and didn't really know anything about me or what I actually liked.
90DayFiance,fc5mn6s,t3_eg67x6,1577461593.0,I both read the title and haven't been watching the new season and I still thought it was Syngin.
StardewValley,fc5mieh,t3_eg570s,1577461499.0,This would make a great tattoo. The warmth makes it feel more like Stardew even with only the parsnips.
StardewValley,fc5lzkh,t3_eg3ypp,1577461128.0,"Wow this is incredible. I could never think of this idea myself, but I think I could make my own (lesser-quality but still cool) version of this with mine and my husband's character. Man, it is way too early to be thinking about next year's Christmas presents lol"

bipolar,fc2zrpt,t1_fbznezl,1577378197.0,"I had thought the same. I thought I was sending obvious signs that I was in desperate need of help. It wasn't until I hit actual rock bottom that anyone seemed to notice. I called my therapist after listening to music by my heroes, reading Carrie Fisher quotes, and seeing Rent (no day but today). It's going to get better!!!!!!!"
bipolar,fc2zkmv,t1_fc0feee,1577378065.0,"Rent is great. Bring tissues. Also maybe avoid it if addiction is triggering. I hadn't seen it in years, and there were a lot of scenes that ""hit differently"" as the youths say because I had seen it in real life before."
bipolar,fbzeur0,t1_fbx7enk,1577244357.0,"Thank you. Not today, Satan, not tomorrow, not ever. Unless it's Lucifer from the TV show, in which case I'm with him 100%. I watched Rent the other day and it was the catalyst for seeking help and fighting for my life. No other road, no other way, no day but today."
