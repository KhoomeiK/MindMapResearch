https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/22/new-details-ukraine-impeachment-trump-republican-lawmakers-opposed-withholding-ukraine-aid/

And FYI:


Trump said:
“By the way, in terms of the money, it got there two or three weeks ahead of schedule, long before it was supposed to be there.”

President Trump was wrong in asserting that his decision last year to suspend military assistance to Ukraine — a key component in his impeachment and upcoming trial — did not interfere with the schedule for delivering the aid.


The 2019 federal fiscal year ended on Sept. 30, the date by which all appropriated aid to Ukraine was supposed to be disbursed. But because of the freeze ordered by Mr. Trump, not all of the aid was spent before the deadline.


Congress had appropriated $391 million in military assistance to Ukraine — $250 million from the Pentagon and $141 million from the State Department — meant to be spent by the end of September. Though the Pentagon announced its plans to provide the aid in June, White House officials blocked its release in July. It remained frozen until mid-September, when Mr. Trump relented after pressure from lawmakers and administration officials.

With just two weeks left in the fiscal year, the Pentagon was unable to fully disburse the funds. According to testimony from Mark Sandy, an official in the Office of Management and Budget, about $35 million was left unspent. Congress then extended the deadline to the 2020 fiscal year to allow for the disbursement of the remaining aid.

“Had that provision not been included, then any unobligated funds as of Sept. 30 would have expired,” Mr. Sandy said.

[source](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/us/politics/trump-ukraine-aid-fact-check.html) 

The Government Accountability Office also said it was illegal for Trump to withhold the aid."

Libertarian,ffx13ec,t1_ffwte4m,1580315484.0,"It is not misleading or hyperbolic to say his decision was not supported at the time. No one supported it. Find me one person who supported it at the time for any reason other than Trump wanted it. One.

And again, you are saying “well, she got her promotion right on schedule after she went public with her boss’ threat that she needed to sleep with him first! No harm, no foul, right? She got the promotion!!”

Again, you are arguing in bad faith."
Libertarian,ffwqkcb,t1_ffvtwwo,1580308594.0,"The aid was withheld just prior to his call with Zelensky and at the direction of Trump. And the aid was released when news of the hold became public and thus he was exposed. Those are not the actions of an innocent man. Moreover, many Republicans asked why the aid was withheld in letters to OMB and expressed their concerns about the impact to our national security. When the aid was released, Graham said he didn’t know why but that it was.

The chain of events speaks to underhanded dealings done 100% by Trump. His decision was not supported by anyone in the administration, OMB, Congress, anyone at the time. No one could even explain why because only a handful knew the true reason. 

So, no, I will not accept a Senate acquittal. This is clear abuse of power.

Let me add... if Trump had withheld the aid to force Ukraine to do something appropriate, that would be different. But Trump wanted Ukraine to announce an investigation into events that began in 2014 (Hunter joined Burisma board) when Trump actually approved aid in 2017 and gave the javelins in 2018. And Ukraine had met all the criteria put on them in 2019 to get the aid. There was NO REASON to hold the aid. NONE!!!!! Except Trump wanted something for personal gain."

Your wife or your sister or your daughter comes to you and says her boss will give her a promotion but she has to sleep with him. Do you say to her, “well, it’s not a crime so who cares?”

It’s called abuse of power. That’s what “high crimes and misdemeanors” means! A high crime is abusing your office /position of power for personal gain. You have to be in a position of power over the victim to commit it, either the boss over his employee or the president over a country at war who needs the help we said we would provide."

The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that executive privilege and congressional oversight each are a consequence of the doctrine of the separation of powers, derived from the supremacy of each branch in its own area of Constitutional activity.

So guess what that means? You must allow for congressional oversight equally with executive privilege.

And the Supreme Court has ruled that executive privilege is not valid when covering up crimes.

Trump did commit crimes. Extortion is a crime.

If my boss says he will give me a promotion if I have sex with him, I refuse, and then he gives me the promotion, that is still a crime."

The justices ruled 9-0 that a president's right to privacy in his communications must be balanced against the authority of Congress to investigate and oversee the executive branch.

The U.S. v. Nixon ruling is also widely understood to mean that executive privilege cannot be used to cover up wrongdoing.

We know Trump stopped the aid to Ukraine. We have multiple people saying Trump ordered Giuliani to demanded Ukraine announce specific investigations to get the aid flowing. We know Giuliani was working for Trump directly. 

We have Bolton, Kelly, and others have said the same. Trump says he’s innocent and people who used to work for him say he’s not. That should be enough for you to say that we need to see communications or have these folks testify, is it not?"

You guys don’t seem to understand what you are allowing to happen, which is an undermining of the foundation of our democracy. Trump is claiming executive privilege on all documents and conversations that involved him in any way. That means any evidence is second hand at best. 

If I robbed a bank and no one who was there is allowed to testify and I can suppress all tapes, block all witnesses from testifying, etc., then I’m going to get away with it again and again.
