No one should care about your name and there are even a good portion of players who only show the first letter of a players first and last name. You should be fine."

MonsterHunterWorld,fepdf7f,t1_feoq1a9,1579317777.0,"I will agree that there’s an aesthetic they aren’t following when it comes to heavy armors however i feel like that shouldn’t really ruin the enjoyment of getting armor. I also think is what happens when a popular eastern game series comes to a western audience. People who were fans before have not cared since their first game. People who are newer seem to however. 

I guarantee every future game will follow this type of armor design. If you don’t like it then I honestly can’t tell you to stop playing since the game is pretty good. But if you’re letting a minute detail in armor design sour your enjoyment of a game then maybe you’re playing for the wrong reason. Or you could you try playing as a male as their armor sets cover a majority of their bodies also."
MonsterHunterWorld,femw1kg,t3_epx7ry,1579271104.0,"I mean I don’t know what to tell you, it’s been a part of MH since the first game. I feel like they just like to be creative and didn’t really take consideration to approach a look based on realism. I never got why they went for shorts on most female armors but it’s whatever.

I personally think it’s cute and if you do not like it then that is why layered armors exist. It’s not a fix  to anything and maybe you like the rest of that particular armor but the game is going to have a lot of designs where a good portion of skin is showing. Not that MH has been known for realistic armor designs or anything."

DarkSouls2,fccgzdv,t3_egyruw,1577598277.0,"I used to love DS2 the most out of the whole franchise when i was younger.

Going back into it and playing the Sotfs version of it i can’t really see what the fascination i had for it was when i was younger. The enemy placement is ridiculous in some areas (the bonfire in Tseldora has enemies literally five ft away) the level geography makes little to no sense and there are a lot of troll elements in the level design like pharos locks that half the time do not give you anything of import. Alot of the bosses are also kind of lackluster in that you fight a boss fairly early in the game and he just becomes a regular miniboss after in multiple areas. 

However i will say i love the aesthetics of some of the levels especially majula and later levels, they set the atmosphere in some of the areas and the last DLC was phenomenal in design and mechanics. DS II also has my favorite Weapons in the entire series that i was extremely disappointed in not seeing in 3.

At the end of the day DS2 isn’t bad, it just has bad parts in it that people have held onto for years and it has made the game deemed the “weakest” in the community.

If you enjoy it then enjoy it, what matters most is that you’re having fun and not letting people ruin it for you."
