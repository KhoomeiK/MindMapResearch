it's not just 'writing it off', that's exactly what it is. he has a persona and plays into it, he has always done this.

you're seriously reaching if you think he's stating that domestic abuse is ok and he supports it. if you were even remotely interested in his music previously, as you said you were, then you would be aware of this and what I'm saying would seem obvious. 

if you do think that he was honestly advocating for domestic abuse, then I just feel bad for you and you need to do some serious thinking."

yes, I can. so as soon as he talks about actual events in his music, it's not okay?

it's a persona that he's created, and people that are familiar with his music know that all of the aggressive rapping is just playing the character.

you think he wrote that and went ""yep, this is definitely how I feel""? if you do, then the problem lies with you."

My point is, if you're bragging to people about being top diamond when it 'meant something' because it was small.. that's not really saying much. Considering masters was hovering around 8% of the playerbase. So all your saying is that you couldn't get into masters when it was huge.
