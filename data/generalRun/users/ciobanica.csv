 No, that's my point, you didn't criticise the film for it, your argument was about how Rey shouldn't be able to do said thing, not that doing those things makes the films not be in line with the OT (which is a valid criticism of both the PT and the ST). 

> You're explicitly stating that she tapped into some zen light side energy boost which isn't a thing.

 She's literally being driven back and then gets a look on her face: 

 *Wait, she actually even says ""The Force!"" right before:* https://youtu.be/rWF0f183tSA?t=104 
 
 Oh, and ANH has *""Trust teh Force, Luke!""*, which clearly implies listening to your ""Force Sense!"" does give you a boost. 

 But yeah, i'm moving goalposts by going by what's in the film itself (which is even called ""The Force ***Awakens***""... ). 

> lightly enhance reflexes

 Maybe i'm misremembering, but isn't it stated Anakin is the only known human that could pod-race, because human reflexes just aren't good enough? 

 And wasn't it because he could slightly anticipate things with the Force (which is also how they deflect blaster fire with lightsabers, as i recall)."

 It's all micro-organism anyway... :P 

 Also, Anakin certainly didn't use teh dark side to win pod-races, and the pilot a fighter plane by mistake to take out a whole droid army.
