Birds sing) would lure sailors to their doom crashing ships into the rocky land, but the sirens themselves weren't aquatic in any way.

Most reported it as man sized.  However, there was a test done where people were asked to drive down a road that had been set up with some vaguely Mothman shaped cutouts with road reflectors for eyes.  They knew before they went what sort of thing they would see because they were asked to estimate the sizes of each.  Estimates of more than double the correct size were common.  Now imagine how badly they might get it if flew at them unexpectedly out of the night, ESPECIALLY if they'd already heard the rumors around town about the ""Man-sizes Moth creature"".

boardgames,ffcimhh,t3_est4w7,1579800259.0,"If you have the Essential Edition that has most of the best parts of the original Tuscany expansion already included.

Base Essential Edition is a really good game.  Adding the expanded board makes it my FAVORITE game.  I always recommend using the Tuscany board if you have it but nothing else for a first play.  In long term I rarely use the special workers or building cards even now.  Every time I add them in, almost nobody uses them.  That may just be my group though YMMV.

The Tuscany board ups the complexity a little because you have 4 seasons instead of 2, but not that much really.  The two big things Tuscany board does that I think are serious improvements are the trade space and the turn order system.  

The trade space let's you dump extra stuff for other stuff you need or points.  Greatly helps potential RNG issues with card draw and makes everything you have potentially useful no matter what.

The turn order system in the base game is just a token that rotates each round and everyone picks turn order clockwise from that token.  I've definitely seen games won or lost based on where that token happened to be on the final round.  It's probably my biggest complaint with the base game (which I still think is overall quite good).  The Tuscany system is tweaked a couple ways and instead of rotating around the board each player picks their start position for the next round immediately after they pass at the end of the current round.  So you always have some measure of control over where you get turn order."

This rule is from when I was a Junior.  They did all sorts of various competitions between the classes and of course the Seniors always won nearly everything.  Well, during the food drive the Juniors concocted a plan to win the event.  Instead of bringing in food we would collect money and a handful of people would hold it all until near the end.  It would look like we were losing because our totals would be low but then on the last day they'd bring in a huge supply and we'd surprisr them with the win.  They wouldn't know how well we were actually doing until it was too late to do anything about it.

I wasn't one of the money people but a couple of them were friends of mine.  The plan was to buy as much food as they could with the money they'd collected, so naturally they bought Ramen Noodles because it's the cheapest thing in the store.  I dodn't know how much money they had, but I think they must have gotten special order shipments in.  On the last day of the drive when I came in there was a roomful of PALLETS of noodles stacked five feet high.  I was completely blown away.  It was an insane amount of Ramen.

AskReddit,fdnqd25,t1_fdmwnte,1578590838.0,"Cracked was so so good once.  Sad to see it become such a useless dumpster fire of ad cancer.

One of my most mind blowing moments was when I was reading a hilarious Cracked article and went to check the author and discovered it was Seanbaby.  I had stumbled across his primitive website way back around 2000ish and had had it bookmarked for years because it was so funny but nobody knew who he was.  To have him pop up as a writer on a completely unrelated website was a pretty cool internet moment for me."
AskReddit,fdnpt66,t3_em7trd,1578590583.0,"Seanbaby.com 

I have no idea how I found it back around 2000ish but I spent so much time reading and watching the content on their and it was some of the funniest shit ever.

The site [still exists](http://www.seanbaby.com/) but it looks completely different from what it used to.  A lot of it is links to his Cracked articles (from back when Cracked was funny and usable, but still years after I had first stumbled across his early site) and stuff like that.  However, a lot of his early content is still there just in a different format if you go looking.  It's still worth a look if you have some time to kill.

I still make Punchmaster references to this day."
AskReddit,fdl6uea,t1_fdjzsbv,1578518040.0,I think most kids probably think this at some point.  It actaully mostly makes sense at kid level thinking.  The idea of digging a secret tunnel to escape captivity is a trope that even kids are familiar with.  A fancy tunnel with a train in it doesn't seem like that much of a stretch and kids don't really grasp how far it is and the logistics that would be required to build an actual railroad in secret.

AskReddit,fdl3cfv,t1_fdk7qt0,1578516353.0,"I like to assume lead chain because that's dumb enough to be plausible with how dumb everything else is.

Also in the ""dumb melting"" category there's the scene where someone has to go into the tunnel that's too hot to survive and like turn off a valve or something, I forget exactly.  Guy goes in carrying a wrench, and then the wrench in dramatic fashion melts in his hand as he's walking to illustrate for us just how hot it is.  But he doesn't need the wrench for anything.  He isn't concerned when it melts and doesn't need it or an alternative to complete the task.  So why did he bring it in the first place?  Just to dramatically melt apparently."
AskReddit,fdl15re,t1_fdk9h19,1578515238.0,"So, is Face/Off plausible as something we could actually do right now? No, not at all, but they do actually address a couple of your points.

There's a hand-wavy scene when the procedure is being explained where they say something like ""we'll resculpt your body"" and imply some sort of plastic surgery procedure and there's a picture on a monitor where one torso morphs into the other.  Not super detailed but they do at least mention it.

When the face swapping part is explained they show a plastic mask and briefly explain how it works. The inside of the mask is molded to the person's skull, the outside is molded to replicate the other person's skull.  So when the face is swapped it's applied to a facial bone structure that matches the original.

At the end of the day though I don't think it's really fair to criticize the movie based on the plausibility of the procedure.  The premise of the movie is that they can swap bodies effectively.  They could have done some sort of ""mind transfer"" procedure or whatever kind of sci-fi techno babble but they opted for ""futuristic plastic surgery"".

You should just accept that it works for the same reason you should just accept that Jom Carrey's son can force him not to lie for a day in Liar Liar.  That's my take anyway."

Did they maybe appear on the plane wherever it is now? If so what if it was full though?  What about people who were on planes that crashed? There had to have been at least a couple of those during the snap.

Unemployment is now 50%.  Nobody was holding those jobs open for five years and a lot of companies are probably out of business.

Huge housing crisis.  Lots of people's homes probably are either occupied by others or are gone now.
