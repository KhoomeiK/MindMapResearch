Diablo,fcge6yy,t3_egww73,1577639065.0,"I think its because of the cpu not the gpu, I compared my gpu to yours, and yours is overall 1% faster, and i have no trouble staying above 100fps even in giant explosions and such. If you have a cpu that ain't so good with single core games then it should be that, because Diablo 3 only utilizes 1 core, and then 1 thread for some minor things. 

&#x200B;

Ill leave my specs, info and such below if you want to compare.

I'm playing on maxed out graphics and run a steady 100+ fps at all times. (i have had once or twice where the entire screen exploded cause of some AOE ability that had me at like 50fps for about half a second)

Montior: 27"" 144hz Acer KG271a

GPU: Radeon VII

CPU: AMD Ryzen 2600 3.4 GHZ

16Gb DDR3 RAM, and game is on SSD not a normal HHD

I usually have a lot of things open in the back, but only because it doesn't affect my fps nor gameplay. 

I always have discord, steam, and 1 tab of reddit open. While playing D3 i listen to music, so either i got a youtube playlist/music complation or spotify open aswell."
