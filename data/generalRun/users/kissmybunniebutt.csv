I've done some digging on my own, and while there seems to me a connections between Bipolar Disorder and increased rates of cardiovascular disease and diabetes and such - all studies link both the effects of the disorder itself (namely mania and suicidal ideation) **and** the medication used to treat the disorder with these increased rates. A lot of medication used to treat bipolar disorder raises your risk factor for many of these illnesses.

And if you choose to move forward with few or no medication, *you are still valid*. It is your decision. Listen to your friends and family, listen to your therapists and doctors, but you are a sentient being that can decide for yourself. Not everyone's journey is the same, and that's totally cool."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ff6au8w,t3_eru9eo,1579623141.0,"CHAPTER 1: The Time I Wrote a Short Essay on Reddit (because I just had to, ya know?)  


I was a late bloomer. I came up with my 'master plan' at around 28, much later than my friends. Went to school, got straight As, and this dream kept me moving. But...due to complications I did not see coming, I had to accept that my master plan was not going to work out. 

Cue a legit slow mental breakdown. I quit school, got a high paying job in the city, commuted 2 hours a day because *this was my life now.* I wanted to be successful. That's what you're supposed to do, right? But inside, I was so...destroyed. I tried so hard only to have it torn out from under me. I was flailing, hopeless, grasping at smoke. I slowly grew more numb and disinterested and boom, one way ticket to the psych ward.   


That was two years ago. I got a job after checking myself out of said psych ward but still didn't feel much. So I quit. I've been writing ever since. Just writing. I don't have a job, no income to speak of (outside of the occasional painting sold or costume sewn). I am lucky that my partner and my family support me and don't want me to end up back where I was. I am so lucky. I know that. I do. But damn if I don't regularly feel like a massive fucking failure. My peers all have houses, kids, careers...vacations abroad where they take really vibrant saturated pictures of themselves in front of palm trees or skylines while I'm at my computer, folded in half, clacking away.  


There's a moral here somewhere - I can feel it. Basically, we're not all okay with where we are or where we're expected to go. Some of us aren't okay. And that's okay. We live in a world that requires certain things to be considered ""successful"" or ""giving it your all"". But those things are not the same for everyone, and trying to force outliers into that mold is not only impossible, it's downright damaging. I will never have a fancy house because that's not my measure of success at all. People will either pity me or envy me (""oh, she's such a free spirit"", they like to say), but that will have no effect on me. It can't anymore.  

I have achieved things, like self awareness and a rather melancholy optimism (is that a thing? It is now). *And so have you.* We're here, we're aware, we're still chugging along like that little engine on an impossible hill. Real conversations, posts on the internet delving into our own minds, delicious cups of tea and oversize grandpa sweaters that make us so happy we could cry...why aren't those the pinnacle? That's fucking success.   


The train is still moving, you haven't missed it. Sometimes it slows down, sometimes it speeds up, but you're always present. And girl, you're not a loser, you're my sister! We're all sisters, moving along together, each one of us wondering if we're headed in the right direction. Keep reaching out to us if you need us...we hear you.

So your characters has schizophrenia, but is undiagnosed and she is unaware of it (I'm assuming, considering the reader doesn't know and it's told from her perspective). Schizophrenia is usually not linked to trauma unless there is an already present predisposition for the disorder (genetics, brain chemistry, etc).  Trauma can potentially trigger it, specifically bouts of psychosis, but that's not generally seen as a 'cause'. Trauma can definitely lead to some mood or personality disorders (borderline, for instance, is linked to childhood trauma a lot, but even that isn't necessarily always true. That opens up the bag of cPTSD and how that manifests versus true personality disorders, and how to distinguish the two...and on and on). If you're going to use mental illness as a driving reason behind a characters actions, make sure you know the big picture of what that illness entails.   


Are you trying to do a beautiful mind kind of thing, where she has visual hallucinations, perhaps of people don't exist? Cause if that's the case, first of all - as I said, do real in depth research into schizophrenia as it's not what people usually think it is. It's not just seeing or hearing things that aren't there. There are other serious and noteworthy symptoms of the disorder. Disordered speech, paranoia, general disinterest in normal things such as personal hygiene...etc. And second, if visual hallucinations are your angle, there are your important side characters right there. The ones...dun dun duh, in her mind.

My major issue with your original statement was that it made it seem as though only western countries have moved towards protecting children from exploitation. As if age of consent was a purely western invention.   


For instance, age of consent was 13 in [Spain](https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-1973-1715) up until 2015, while the age of consent in [Namibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_Africa) was set at 16 as early as 1980. The [Japanese Child Welfare Act](http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail_main?id=11&vm=2) of 1947 clearly defines a child as anyone under the age of 18. While the age of consent depends on the situation (marriage, parental consent, etc), their legal identity is regarded as a child. And many prefectures within Japan have strict ages of consent (like US states have varied ages of consent by state). The entire world moved towards protecting children, not just the west. Did they influence each other? Sure, of course. That's globalization. But it was still a global movement.

I grew up in the arts world (writers, actors, dancers, oh my), and I learned quickly never to assume someone's sexuality. You absolutely never know until you know. And gender was never cut and dry for me. My...formative years were before the internet really took hold, and the understanding of gender and expression wasn't really quantified to the general public yet. But, among the rabble of starry eyed creative types, the spectrum of gender and sexuality was always a part of life.   


Long story short - there is a chance people will react negatively to anything you do that doesn't conform to arbitrary accepted standards. But there are always, always people that will not only embrace you, but celebrate you for your true self. I lost quite a few friends in the transition between middle and high school because I didn't slide into traditional femininity and toss aside my weird. And yeah, it sucked at the time. But there were plenty of kids exactly like me ready to take me in and help me flourish. You don't want friends that try to confine you, you want friends that try to empower you. And as long as nothing you do is with malice or whatever, they should never try to stop you.  


And there are plenty of girls who love a 'pretty' guy. Look at Kpop, man. Those dudes are more beautiful than I will ever be. Just rock it with as much confidence as you can muster. And lastly, if you try it and it's too much, don't be ashamed of retracting it! You're allowed to experiment, and sometimes experiments fail. And that's totally cool.

Yes, I do think tea is somewhat gendered. I sat and thought about it for a while, and I think a part of it comes down to this weird obsession American people have with average, ""red blooded American boys"" not liking...well, complex flavors. Steak, beer, potatoes, black coffee. Those are manly things. Subtlty in food is somehow considered feminine, I guess?

Like mixed drinks at a bar or a flavored latte at a coffee shop. I've been with guys that order these sweet treats without batting and eye, but someone always makes a comment. Strangers or friends, there's a moment of ""woh, are you gay?"" or something. It's like indulging in something delicious makes you weak?

Obviously that's not true or universal. It's just a generalized middle America view, but it definitely exists! I personally don't like to drink sweet things at all, and have been told quite a bit I have a ""man's palate"".

If you go to Italy and order a macchiato, it will be very different from a latte because a macchiato is still an original macchiato in most places. That's all I'm saying.
