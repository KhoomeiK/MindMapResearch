My point still stands about the UK though (mainly England) as it's the worst I've ever experienced based on service and value for money."

AskReddit,fedi4ml,t1_fed5otc,1579012116.0,"I've been through this also, although my kid's mother falsely accused me of all sorts of things so  I wouldn't have access. I took her to court (representing myself as I had no money) and totally wiped the floor with her and her legal representative, yet STILL had to have supervised access for a few months because, well..I'm a man.

All I will say is that now my kid is older, he knows exactly what's up and I now see him anytime I want. The system is fucked and there is genuinely no equality for fathers in our situation but I hope it gets better for you man and I'm sure it will.

Wishing you luck."

GetMotivated,fd2ajxz,t1_fd294om,1578144304.0,"I am one of those thousands, even millions of artists putting the effort in, year after year, and trust me, it takes a lot of work. Of course you need a bit of luck for the right person to believe in you and also, you need to be marketable, especially to the people who tend to actually pay for music - mostly young, impressionable teenagers. 
Lizzo got lucky with all of that and if she's happy to make blood-curdlingly-cringey music to gain success then good on her.

I'll just stick to writing songs that about 50 people in the world actually 'dig'!"

It will pass, though, like everything does, and in my experience, that person is almost definitely not worth the heartache. The pedestal always tumbles and in the end, 'what's for you will not go by you' as they say where I'm from."
