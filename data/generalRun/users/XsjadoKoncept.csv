He probably shouldn't present his net worth this way, granted, but his entire business/life/image is built on this grandiose idea of himself that he sells, even as president.

And this is a strange kind of honesty - can you imagine any other major political figure admitting openly that his statement of net worth was guessed in this fashion, even if it were true? No, they'd form statements with lawyers to weasel their way out of answering or find/create evidence to back up their claims, or blame some associate for misrepresenting figures to them. The only time they'd take responsibility would be if cornered with no other option - but not Trump, he might be a braggart, but he's always honest about it, and that it's simply who he is.

Look at his Twitter feed, it's a stream of consciousness like none before him - he straight up admits that they care about Saudi Arabia because they spend billions on US defence and weapons sales. He's kept every promise, for better or worse, and despite probably giving his poor PR teams a series of heart attacks and severe anxiety, he says what he really thinks all the time.

Love him or hate him, you have to appreciate that honesty - and as far as lying goes, would you prefer someone who likes to claim everything he does is the greatest ever, or someone who lies about being part Native American, or being under sniper fire, or simply what his agenda is in the first place? He just wants to go down in history as a great man, and I'd take that over someone who serves interest groups you don't even know exist, with goals you'll never be told, because they were promise money and power in return - Trump already has the money and power, it's funny they are trying to impeach him on a quid pro quo when his main drawcard is that he has no need for such things and can't be bought.

And tell me, even if you disagree with everything he is, and every one of his policies - who else could ruffle the feathers of the corrupt establishment like he has? In their deranged hatred of him, many are just straight up incriminating themselves, it's hilarious..."

If you were serious about him only living and being charged with mental illness because he's White, you should see the list of Black crazies doing similar things and having ""mental illness"" outcomes - if they weren't sad cases they'd be funny - from believing the president owes them trillions of dollars personally, believing they are Jesus reborn, tonnes of ""destiny"" based crazies, and sometimes the boring old vanilla lizard people / Jews are 'X' conspiracies. I believe there was a study commissioned somewhere to find out why there were so many African-Americans affected in this way.

Some documents were released, but from memory most was contained in a leak a few years ago.

That being said, there is something to the idea that Blacks are mistreated by cops - recent statistics shows the opposite is true, and that fear off reprisal has meant that Black offenders suffer less escalation, but in the past there were studies that show our ""lizard brain"" reacts differently to other races, and our fear response is heightened - this works both ways, White cops on black offenders, and Black cops on white offenders - but with most cops being White and offenders massively overrepresented by Blacks the result is a higher total number of White-cop-on-Black-Suspect over-escalation resulting in injury/death.

We need to keep increasing our understanding - rather than yelling ""racist"" at each other, admit we still have monkey in us and tend towards in-group/out-group tribalistic bias that can't be managed until it's acknowledged.

It's not as simple as Whites being racists or Blacks being criminals - and pretending that when bad things happen it's just racist White cops prevents real progress being made in a sensitive area.

You can take that ""no true Scotsman"" bullshit and put it somewhere dark and moist - just because this candidate isn't a perfect idealistic choice, your suggestion for an American in this position is to not vote for the lesser evil, and end up with something far worse so that you can benefit personally?

Mexico doesn't send them directly, you are correct - but as both myself, the article, and Hillary says - the Mexican government was providing documentation on how to avoid being caught and deported as an illegal with felonies against your name. There was more to this, and more direct measures taken to push some cartel members North of the border, but Google hides all this stuff now so I'll need some time to dig it up.

And you're absolutely right that Trump most definitely exaggerated the issue, but there is an issue and exaggeration is the Trump way - he uses hyperbole constantly to achieve his goals, and while I'm not a fan of it, and it makes me cringe to watch at times, it's effective - and if it works to keep Americans safe then it's worth doing - stopping the multiple levels of exploitation that arise with ongoing illegal immigration.

This is something dear to me as my ex was held hostage as a legal immigrant, nobody treats immigrants worse than other immigrants who see their vulnerable countrymen as a target for exploitation, creating huge networks of crime and exploitation that fund cartels and modern day mobs - in my years working for my country's version of the FBI I remember seeing documents that some of these criminal networks built around exploitation of illegals are so large that they contribute to the campaigns of politicians friendly to keeping the status quo). Direct crime is the least of the problems that come with illegal immigration

That annoying bravado and showmanship has been getting stuff done, and as much as I want someone like Ron Paul in that spot because of his ideals and dedication to the concepts of personal freedom, someone like that would have been eaten alive by the corrupt, self-serving and self-preserving ""swamp"" - Trump's brashness is the only thing that seems to work against them, and it's worked so well you have them doing stupid stuff in their tantrums, like admitting to using a billion dollars in aid to cover up corruption, the whole impeachment debacle, etc - and if we are really lucky they'll keep going until they find themselves all in jail - then maybe we can use that clean slate to swap out Trump for a candidate who cares about principles and restoring the statesmanship that has long been lost."

“Mexico is such an important problem on our doorstep. … the Mexican government’s policies are pushing migration north across our border! … There isn’t any sensible approach except to do what we need to do simultaneously: secure our borders, technology, personnel, physical barriers if necessary at some places… If they’ve committed transgressions of whatever kind, they should be obviously deported. “

And after all this, I'm a libertarian, I'm not a ""Trump Supporter"" or a ""Republican"" (or even American for that matter), but I'll be honest and say that if I was American I'd vote for Trump in 2020 because it's gonna be him vs an Old Socialist fraud who imagines himself a Grand Commissar benevolently deciding the fates of the ""[little] people"", or an absolutely batshit insane woman who lied about her heritage and pretty much everything else to virtue signal and judge people from a higher pedestal than even the socialist (while having no understanding at all of the social and economic systems she'd destroy while crippling the country), or finally a corrupt old creep who's mental decline in the public sphere would be heartbreaking if he wasn't being used by a ruling elite as a result of his own twisted ambitions for power.

The mind-reader guy was already developing something like this, and if Peter was unable to access the stage 2 of the abilities he copied, it would go a long way to nerfing him in relation to everyone else, while still keeping him quite powerful.

Without this ability, the genetic memory would be extremely limited, with extremely old queens being the only ones who's memories are kept, but with it, you could keep stacking the memories of the greatest of the Gua'old with each new generation - just have a top System Lord father a new Queen, then have another System Lord father a newer queen with the that queen, rinse and repeat, and you can birth a super queen with a hundred thousand years of genetic memory - imagine remembering leading both sides of a major war, with maybe the memories of a few top generals thrown in...
