However, it’s usually because they are a virgin, are too shy around girls their own age, and/or really want an older mother figure. I end up coaching them and giving them a pep talk or something. I get quite upset with people my age who, in my opinion, take advantage of innocence and actually go to bed with young people.

science,fctiwl3,t1_fctfnrk,1577944837.0,"Yeah, your best bet is to literally take hundreds of photos until you have some “good ones” where you look like a very likable person with a smile on your face. Clean, decently dressed, look like a fun, positive person. Maybe have your friends take photos while you do activities, I did that for a guy friend once. Write a bio, not too long, but try to give it some personality if you can. Then, practice written small talk with new people, maybe on discord or something, I don’t know. The guys who are used to getting a lot of matches know how to open and close a conversation without any of the awkward spots, since they do it all the time. That should land you matches if you’re at least like a 6/10. Otherwise, probably better to meet girls in real life I suppose, by joining a club or something. But always remember, even when girls are getting like 300 matches, the vast majority are thirsty weirdos (often prone to whining, anger, and/or an obsession with the word “hehe” and blushing emote). If you can successfully demonstrate that you’re normal, you’ll come out ahead. And also, I knew a guy who was a literal chick magnet in person, who made a profile with no written bio and one awkward photo of his face, and he got like two non-bot matches lol.

In Iowa, I was able to build a social group of over 50 guys and girls using tinder. This time around, I moved to a new area on the west coast and didn’t want to start a new social group. Turns out, if you don’t have a group to invite them out to, guys try to trick you into dates :/

science,fctedoa,t1_fct6gxp,1577940589.0,"Yeah some guys deliberately look for cougars, creeps me out that the older women will go for that. At age 35, I used tinder to recruit for a social group and searched 23-40 to match the age of our members. I definitely got *way* more matches of younger guys. Guys in their 30s are almost in mid-life crisis mode, and often won’t even look at girls in their 30s. They tell themselves they can date 5-10 years younger. It’s all really weird."
science,fctdy5k,t1_fct44o2,1577940210.0,"Most guys I know skew their searches to younger women only. Even when they only get two matches, and both ghost them. Something about being too proud to date a girl that’s not younger than them. That’s anecdotal, though. 
But if she lived in Iowa, it’s definitely way too easy to get over 1000 matches in a few days if you decide to be “open-minded” and swipe on everyone. (Then get your tinder account suspended because it glitches out and some guys report you as a bot...after getting massive amounts of hatemail for apparently not replying to messages fast enough...not that this happened to me or anything)

Edit: As someone pointed out below, many younger guys definitely have a habit of searching for cougars. So, it’s unlikely that she was searching younger. In my experience at age 35, my guy friends at that age searched 29 and younger, and I rarely got same-age matches."

Then when you match with them, they accuse you of being a bot, or get rude because you didn’t reply to their constant messages within 2 hours. You’re their only match so they are obsessive, send “good morning” texts, and spam you with messages and creepy emotes. I even went on there saying I was just looking for *platonic* friends since I moved to a new area, made sure the guys understood (no sex no dating), and they were still tricking me into dates, sending winky faces, and even asking me to come over and have me meet their family.

Keep looking at the photos of yourself that you look good in. Stop looking at your current self and panicking. The messages you send to your subconscious mind are critical. It can sabotage you (like when you felt guilty about the candy bowl, when you lost your friends, etc) or it can put you on autopilot to success (like when you were having fun looking up new recipes and optimistic). Your mind is literally the key. Use goals, tracking, accountability, etc, and also use the stuff that leads pro athletes to success - affirmations (“I am healthy and I eat healthy food” fools the dumb-side of your brain), ‘thin’ photos (the old ones you were looking at), visualizations (i.e. visiting your family for the holidays and surprising them with how good you look), etc. You *cannot* just push through with willpower, no one can. Re-program your subconscious with these daily mental exercises so that it will help you succeed. 
If you want a great one-stop resource for fat loss, I recommend Burn the Fat Feed the Muscle by Tom Venuto. The only topics it doesn’t cover in detail are stretching (easy to look up on the internet) and intermittent fasting (if you decide to try that). Good luck, I hope you succeed!"

Measles, on the other hand, is one of the most stable viruses in existence. What you are missing is that you have to understand an issue in detail and not just assume that one article about chickens is related to pro-vaccine people who don’t want their kid to get measles. You accuse pro-vaxxers of cherry-picking scientific data when you are actually the one doing this.

Buddha was not a god, he was basically a psychologist, philosopher, and motivational speaker who was alive over 2500 years ago. He originally had disciples of his teachings (they had to memorize everything because they had no means to write until hundreds of years after his death), but what he said resonated with so many people that they kept it alive until the present day. It became a religion later on, with people praying for a new buddha and other unnecessary embellishments. However, the lessons from that historical figure could help a lot of depressed and lost people today, and the sanghas do in fact help a lot of people. Their form of organized religion is a healthy community (except for incense burning), with positive energy and supporting each other. Not like christianity today, with the “I’m better than you for loving god and going to church” attitude you see so often. Although, some christian/catholic churches still do a lot of positive activism for the community. Just something to think about. I hugely recommend Thich Nhat Hanh’s books."

(1) Got my mind on track with books by Thich Nhat Hanh, then
(2) Used the goals/affirmations chapter from Burn the Fat Feed the Muscle by Tom Venuto to get my cravings and mindset on track.
Top athletes use affirmations and visualizations for a reason, and this book goes through it in enough detail that you can literally “re-program” your subconscious to want carrots instead of junk food. Fuck willpower, this was sooo much easier.
Good luck dude!"

The book is worth the price just for the chapter on goal-setting and affirmations (to get your mind on track - critical!), but it also goes into detail on bodybuilding methods for shedding fat. These guys know how to dial in ridiculously low body fat percentiles, using healthy whole food diets. It’s long, but it’s the last book you’ll ever need on weight loss. Good luck!"

Then I “programmed” my subconscious mind with affirmations, tracking, and visualizations. I finally figured, if top athletes do this stuff then I can too. Our minds are the biggest obstacle to success, really the only obstacle.  Amazing results, especially with everything you went through! Very inspiring, thank you for sharing"
