cogsci,ff4px43,t3_eri7cm,1579569603.0,"This is cool. Apparently, from my understanding of this, the magnesium ions enter through the sodium gated channels via quantum tunneling, and in the process actually lower the action potential of the neuronal cell membrane in the process. It appears that this may be usable for mood stabilization in bipolar disorder, though this potential lowering effect. Nifty that we are finally applying quantum effects to explain neurological effects, instead of the ""because electricity"" explanation we have had for a century."
