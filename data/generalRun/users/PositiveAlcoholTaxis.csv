Reversing is a challenge not helped by you forcing your way past as soon as a gap opens between the front of the truck and the wall/otherside of the road/lamppost we were trying not to hit. But it's the same as riding a motorbike. Some people help you out, a lot pay no attention, and a small group go out of their way to be arseholes."
