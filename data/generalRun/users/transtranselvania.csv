Where Fred might not get it is if he got the last spot available in order of who signed up but the person after him was named Guillaume Leblanc. 

I’d imagine they had that policy because once a French Canadian kid in got passed over for a spot by an entire class with absolutely no francophone connections in their family. The whole class weren’t kids with French last names there was one kid with a Québécois parent and me with my Grandmother from Quebec City but Scottish as hell relatives on the other three grandparents sides of the family."

Most men’s clothing is also women’s clothing these days, 100 years ago it’d be weird for a woman to wear pants but now it’s not at all out of the ordinary to see a woman at the grocery store wearing jeans and a flannel but it’s really uncommon to see a fella wearing a skirt in the dairy aisle. It’s also not uncommon to see women at the beach in board shorts and a t-shirt, how many men have you seen at the beach in a bikini? Women wearing men’s clothes is just wearing clothes, men wearing women’s clothes is “cross dressing”.


Plenty of people make snap judgments about men in men’s clothes too, dress too fancy? Must be gay. Cargo shorts and a wrinkled shirt? Must be a slob. John Deere hat and a flannel?

Usually I’m in a crew with the other young people but occasional in get thrown in with a bunch of the old fellas and they think I’ll find their sexist jokes funny just because I’m a guy but they’re usually just gross and not humorous on the plus side because no one cares if you call someone out I can just say something like “Fuck off robert you dirty old bastard.” and it gives the older guys that don’t like the jokes either an out to call him an idiot too. These old guys actually get reprimanded for that shit now too it’s great and for the full on harassment I’ve seen some firings.

AskReddit,fdnccnc,t1_fdn2ewl,1578582742.0,There’s a separate sink so that when other people in the kitchen need to wash their hands they’re not getting in the dishwashers way.
AskReddit,fdnbw2f,t1_fdmk3p0,1578582448.0,I’m curious about correctly too because some people think correctly means do it in whatever  way that works but others think it means there’s only one right way to do things and it’s the way I do it. The second option are the kind of people who would tell you you’re wiping the counter wrong by wiping right to left instead of left to right.
AskReddit,fdnausx,t1_fdnaag9,1578581777.0,"I’m honestly just concerned for the kid to be honest. I had female friends who were raised like that too and it’s really weird, the second the sun went down their mothers would say be extra careful walking home so you don’t get raped even though it was only dark out because it’s winter, it’s 4:30 and rush hour next to a busy road. One is more likely to get raped by someone they know in their own bed than next to a busy road at rush hour"
AskReddit,fdn9uud,t1_fdmryro,1578581094.0,It’s honestly so weird that’s how kids just don’t learn there friends parents names for years and only know them as “so and so’s mum.”
SelfAwarewolves,fdn8jnf,t1_fdn7yo6,1578580156.0,My thinking was more compared to groups like Al-qaeda they haven’t been around very long coupled with me not really remembering people making isis jokes until the 2010s and also forgetting that it’s now 2020 and 2004 was longer ago than it feels.
SelfAwarewolves,fdn7hnx,t1_fdn6wbi,1578579385.0,Yeah they’ve been around that long but the average person didn’t learn who they were until 2014 when they stepped their game up and took over some cities in Iraq like Mosul.
AskReddit,fdn6pg7,t1_fdmt4ey,1578578786.0,"When I taught swimming lessons in high school the pool had a policy of not letting the male lifeguards teach the infant and toddler lessons because it made the parents uncomfortable but occasionally I’d have to cover one if somebody was sick. The amount of four year old girls who’s mothers who would pull me aside and say their kid was scared of men so it might be a hard lesson was ridiculous.

One mother even explained to me why her daughter was “scared” of men and it boiled down to: One time an uncle accidentally startled the kid and ever since the mother had been telling the kid and other people within earshot of the kid that she’s scared of men. That kid was legit terrified of being in the shallow end with me and 8 others kids with forty parents watching so she watched the whole lesson from 20 feet away."
