datingoverthirty,fda56f7,t3_ekezl2,1578241814.0,If youâ€™re not getting the intimacy you desire such as more communication I highly doubt having sex with him will create it. At this point in your relationship with him it will only delay it. Seems heâ€™s just playing along just to get laid and will likely fade even more once he does.
offmychest,fd72rb2,t3_ek5sy4,1578198706.0,Just curious as to why youâ€™re not waiting for him to propose?! Either way this is really cute and wish you the best!
