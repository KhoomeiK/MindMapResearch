pharmacy,ffewqqm,t3_et2vir,1579868670.0,"I've been a tech since 1999, all of it retail except 3 years as a IV room tech.  I have anxiety from my PTSD, but I experience a lot of extra anxiety from my job.  The chain I currently work for has jumped on the trend of only one pharmacist open to close and barely enough technicians to cover every station, half  the time not even enough. We are grumpy as staff, customers are cranky, and it's just all around terrible.  I pretty much cry in my car after work daily.  On top of that, everyone at work has gotten the flu or their kids have, so lots of call outs, myself included a few weeks ago.   I've called out a few times because my anxiety and depression was so overwhelming I couldn't function to get out of bed.  100% open to changing jobs..but 20 years with one skillset ..not many options in the pay range I'm in."
