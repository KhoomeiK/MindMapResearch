YouShouldKnow,fdjlki0,t1_fdjjq06,1578476696.0,"Recently they have been really supportive of the conservative party in home affairs and given little space for opposition party's to be on the platform. They failed to report correctly on obvious mistakes by the conservatives. One example the boris Johnson remembrance day situation where he laid the reef wrong and the bbc got called out for ""mistakenly"" useing old footage of him putting a different reef down from a few years ago. I'm sure their foreign affairs have  issues but I stopped following the bbc years ago so cant give recent examples."
