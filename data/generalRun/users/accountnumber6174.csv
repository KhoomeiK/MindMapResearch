HumansBeingBros,ff36unk,t3_erdhfm,1579535086.0,"Man, this takes me back.

As a kid, I had a few of those dirt-cheap clay piggy banks in which I used to collect coins. Stores still pay you in coins a lot those days, and within a few months, it'll be full and heavy. It's about the size of a teapot. So I'd take it to my Mom, and we'll both break it, it's the only way to open them.

All these coins were from the change I got from buying sweets and candy on my way home from school.

Anyway, then we'd count them, more like, line them up cylindrically - 5s go in one cylindrical set, 2s in another, and so on... we had maybe 5 to 6 denominations. Then we'd tally them up and later, Mom will give me a tenner note, I felt so rich holding a crisp note in my hands. The rest, I let her keep with a promise of getting me a toy another day, which I'd have forgotten by then.

Life continued like that for a while."
memes,ff3120e,t1_ff2wycr,1579530831.0,"Not exactly.

It's a little bit of both, Reddit alone has countless threads discussing this and the psychological play still wins. Plenty of other articles have also addressed the ""pocketing bills"" tale, which, though probable back then, don't hold water nowadays since we pay via cards and other virtual payments now, yet, this .99 tag is still heavily in use because it works.

Also,  contrary to some beliefs that it helps in Tax benefit as the '99' figure isn't counted for Tax Evaluation, it's not true, it has already been accounted for.

In the end, the .99 cent/penny is nothing but still a marketing strategy."

So I looked it up a bit and seems like, during this trying time, the then-Viceroy Lord Lytton is believed to have exported 325 million kilograms of wheat to England while the Indian population was under the ravages of the deadly famine. Conditions had become so abysmal that people resorted to selling their children in exchange for food, and some resorted to cannibalism. Meanwhile, Queen Victoria had been crowned Empress of India, and a grand celebration was underway, with over 60,000 guests and exquisite food and wine.
