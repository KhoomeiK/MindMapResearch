It's detrimental to use shampoo every single day because it removes the natural oils from your hair and scalp which are beneficial.  Unless, of course, you have excess amounts of oil then what you are doing is actually normal.

Shampoo is a product just like all the other crap we buy that we think we need because commercials tell us we need them.  Unless there's some reason for you to use shampoo, then don't buy into the advertising schemes and don't listen to the haters telling you ""it's a little weird"".

YouShouldKnow,fg4lhda,t1_fg2a4ei,1580505747.0,Incorrect.  That's not how wages in the US work for hourly employees.  One hour worked = at least the state minimum hourly wage and this will be visible on the pay stub.  No such thing as an employer making a case that he/she should pay *less* than the hourly minimum wage because of profit margins.

YouShouldKnow,fg4kqv1,t3_ewgcdm,1580505296.0,"Incorrect.  It is not ""typical"" and the times you hear about it are rare or flat out bs.  There is a federal law that says no employee can make any less than $7.25 and hour and every state has a minimum wage as well.  If an employee signs a contract with an employer (or otherwise agrees) to allow tips to compensate wages they have made that choice.  Which personally, I see that as a very bad choice and would tell people to avoid employment there but sometimes, some people just can't get a job elsewhere and need the income."

Just slightly enough that you don't feel or notice anything slowing you down while driving but enough that it's actually making a bit of contact, enough to produce a smell.

You would notice the smell as you were driving and came to a stop like at a red light.  Whatever wheel this was happening to would be noticeably hot but wouldn't necessarily produce smoke.  This reminds me of a time I changed my own brakes and forgot to remove this piece of plastic that was kinda glued to the outside of the pads.  It's not that I forgot, it's just I didn't know it was there, it looked more like a design.  Anyway it was plastic so it started to melt and it was noticeably smoking when I was at a light.

Some of them.

Most of them you cannot talk to though.  They have mental problems and that's not my fault.  By the way, what about all the veterans not living on the streets?  The problem is our government defunded the mental health institutions during Regan's presidency and guess where all those people had to go that were being helped by nurses and were receiving medical attention and medication and had a place to stay.  That's right, the streets.

At the end of the day it's whatever right?  Homeless are homeless and it's unfortunate they're out there but when they trash the american river that's what makes me furious.  Discovery park has seen multiple cases of e. Coli in the water from all that trash, urine, fecal matter, and needles being dumped into the rivers.

I saw some rangers evict some tents that were set up along the bike trail but they didn't go further into the brush to remove the ones you can't see from the road.
