If you're going for the one you mentioned in your post initially I would say that that's a decent one. If you can spring for the mortise then go for it, but I know that my recommendation and what a wallet says are 2 different things lol,so no I wouldn't be too concerned w doing the non mortice version.

Edit: now mind you this is all the opinion of a stranger on the internet. I know that, personally, my advise is good, but I encourage you to do some more research. Talk w a locksmith shop, if you can find some lock hardware distributors and ask them as well bc they deal directly w manufacturers and locksmiths who sell these so they get multiple opinions too."
Locksmith,fek02hb,t1_fejwb69,1579189716.0,"Yeah, Ive been a locksmith working the retail side for about 10 years going back before Baldwin got bought out by kwikset and went to crap. Baldwin used to be incredible quality, solid brass everything, highest possible quality manufacturing, etc. They were the Tiffany and Co. of lockets, but then Kwikest bought them out and within a matter of months rolled their (kwiksets) ""high end line"" (sold at home depot) into Baldwins line to make them fancier. They kept the high end but doubled the price and if I remember right I feel like they were slowly phasing it out for their bs.

Emtek was an alternative to Baldwin more like the Kay Jewellers or Jared's of lockets for instance. Still great quality but not as high end as Baldwin. I had no concerns selling a customer Emtek bc Ive used them often. With them ita all about the price tier. If you pay for a 50 dollar lockset you'll get 50 dollar quality. You pay 500 for a lockset you get 500 dollar quality. As far as pocket door hardware I feel the same way. Emtek makes solid equipment and, if it's installed correctly, will last for years."
Locksmith,fejo8a2,t1_feib2wr,1579181427.0,"Be. Careful. With. Baldwin.

They are owned by Kwikset and the one you find at Home Depot is basically fancy crud. If you're gunna go Baldwin expect to start looking at handlesets around 300 and go up from there. Anything under that gets iffy and anything around the 100 dollar mark is crap.


If you want a handleset that will last and you don't have to worry about ""is this good quality"" I would recommend Emtek. Made by Assa Abloy and they make some of the best door hardware consistently

Edit: Emtek makes pocket door hardware too that again is of some consistently good quality imo"
