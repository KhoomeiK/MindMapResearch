That's not a good sign as to the authenticity of this video.  But let's give them the benefit of the doubt.

> However, how can they name colors that they've not seen before correctly?

These glasses don't make you see colours you've never seen before.  That would be physically impossible: if your visual system (eyes + brain) cannot see a specific colour, then anything completely in front of that visual system cannot change that.  That would be like changing the contents of a book by giving it a different cover - obviously that doesn't make sense.

So instead these are colours the boy has already seen and learned.  The glasses just make them ""pop"" more.  You may have actually experienced something similar yourself when wearing sunglasses.  If you compare clouds with and without sunglasses you may notice they seem to have more depth or look more defined with sunglasses than without.

I imagine it's somewhat like increasing the saturation on a TV or monitor, except it's only on the red-green channel.  And to be honest it's very hard to imagine what people with CVD see.  Software simulation can only get you so far."
