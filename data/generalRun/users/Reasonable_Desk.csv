As in, I took the source you gave me, read more than just the portion you read, and shot it back at you. If you're going to use that wikipedia article to talk about how the Nordic Nations don't have a minimum wage, but use UBI. That was the wikipedia page you cited a while ago. I know it's hard to keep up with because you're following and attacking me in multiple threads to obscure what is being said but it's still in your comment history and my inbox. 

SO, either wikipedia is a reliable source and you're going to use it to say Nordic Countries don't have a minimum wage. (fine) Or it's a flawed source, and you're going to refute the very source you provided earlier thus proving it's unreliability and why it shouldn't have been used in the first place.

MurderedByWords,fgl2oza,t1_fgjque2,1580880149.0,"Why do I think people without 4 year or longer degrees aren't experts? Oh, that's easy. Let's look at your source on minimum wage:  


Note that all the countries with the highest minimum wage are considered some of the best countries in the EU to live in. England, Ireland, France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain. But wait, what's this?! A bunch of Nordic countries don't have ANY minimum wage? Well, if you bothered to look at the next section of your own source, you'd see that's because they did away with minimum wage entirely... In favor of a Universal Basic Income. Which is a system that ensures all citizens are paid a certain amount of money regardless of their working status. Which is, say it with me now, a socialist program.    


So why did you miss such a crucial piece of information? Do you stop reading after something says what you want? Do you not ask questions about why other countries don't have a minimum wage? Or are you, like very many "" conservative thinkers ""... a liar? I don't know. And I can't say. All I can say is, your very own source proves you wrong, and I find that hilarious.

Ok great, the Nazi's "" controlled the means of production "" . ( That's communism, not socialism by the way not that you know the difference) Too bad communism advocates ALL workers control production, not just a handful. But again, not like you know. They were still an autocracy dedicated to the few ( Nazis ) who took power away from the people, systematically oppressed out groups ( Jews, Homosexuals, any political opponent, non-""Aryans"") and glorified in groups. That's a small list and it's too late in the day for me to bother further. Point is, they leaned left as well as blind men can see.
