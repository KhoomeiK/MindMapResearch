But there is some code I couldn't understand. Would you kindly explain this part?

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: pi-temp-headless
      namespace: pi-temp
    spec:
      clusterIP: None
      selector:
        app: pi-temp-agent
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: pi-temp-public
      namespace: pi-temp
    spec:
      selector:
        app: pi-temp-agent
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
          targetPort: 5000
      type: LoadBalancer

I am not sure what exactly happens here. As the result, it seems the service `pi-temp-public` forwards requests to `pi-temp-headless`, but I cannot find the documents of having service-to-service request forward setup like this. The closest thing I got is this: [Connect a Front End to a Back End Using a Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/connecting-frontend-backend/), which has another layer of pods acting as transparent proxies.

The `LoadBalancer` is set to select pods labeled `app: pi-temp-agent`, how is it possible for it to select on the headless service rather than one of the pods with exact same label?"

China,ffchk4v,t3_esu1rj,1579799609.0,"TBH, everyone that is contacting Chinese personnel coming back from China should have taken the same level of precaution as she is.

The first outbreak was reported last week but the incubation period is identified to be around 2 weeks. Most people who left the city are still in the time frame where no symptom show up even they are infected. Those who left before the lock down are now all over eastern Asia, multiple countries including Taiwan and Japan, patients are identified being infected by the virus. Now Seattle has one, it is the matter of time for other place to go off...

FYI...There are Chinese people leaving the country heading straight to the US for their children.  Good luck in the Tri-State area near Flushing"
