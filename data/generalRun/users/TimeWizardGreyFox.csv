They cheap out on much thinner stock than a good saw blade should be (they use advertising bate like ""laser cut thin kerf"" to sell the thinner material as a feature where as it's most certainly detrimental) and I've found they are just over priced for the ""name"" much like Freud which is also trash tier when it comes to anything that cuts. If you can buy it at home depot, it's going to be garbage.

I've found the craftex blue tornado blades from busybee to be decent by comparison, they have a thicker blade, hold square without any vibrations, and have a great smooth cut for much longer, Cheaper as well.

Fuck Diablo basically, try experimenting with other blades and you'll certainly find far better options than anything they supply.

I'd consider these blades to be the lower end of quality that are still worth purchasing as they will get the job done well and they don't over advertise on gimmicks and nonsense that are detrimental to a good cut.

Non stick perma coating? that will be gone after the first few cuts burns it off due to rubbing against the stock you are cutting. Ti Co carbide? it's literally just their own branded carbide, nothing new or special.

rant over, I hate Diablo blades. Sorry.

Edit: Biggest gripe against the diablo blades would be trying to make adjustment cuts where you don't have stock on both sides of the blade, That blade will freely travel to the outside of the cut leaving you with anything but square."

with Cast materials you start by melting the metal down and it's injected into a mold, as the metal cools and contracts it builds up points of stress, Annealing can help alleviate some of those stress points through heating to specific temps and then allowing the parts to cool at a much slower rate which allows the crystal structure to bond properly without breakages making it easier to bend.  If the part was heat treated instead of annealed, you would have a much stiffer but also more brittle part which will be more inclined to cracking. 

Aluminum pans will likely be cold formed or drop forged in some way which would be avoiding the stresses induced when melting a metal down and reforming it that way.

I use them a lot for my business but am slowly working towards larger cheaper orders with other companies so I can stop relying on Mcmaster with low quantity orders which just eat away at profits at this point.

todayilearned,fcp11xa,t1_fcp0aep,1577847211.0,"I'm not saying the research can't be moral and I never made the claim that some objections are wrong so all objects are wrong, you really don't need to put words in my mouth.   
All I'm saying is that the needs of the few shouldn't outweigh the needs of the many. Take anti vaxers as an example, they have moral obligations to their children to keep them unvaccinated where as the rest of us sane humans see them as outright retards with a direct affect on the rest of us as a whole.  
Ethics boards are all well and good, but there is also certain things deemed unethical by that board which may be one of those ""taboo"" fields which may lead to vast breakthroughs which wouldn't require what was deemed unethical anymore. Pushing boundaries can sometimes be necessary is all I'm really saying. Nothing to do with Nazis... jesus christ."

rosin,fcn89bs,t1_fcloq6u,1577805831.0,"on the electric pump side of things it could be anywhere from $300-2000+ depending on how much you want to spend in the end. I'd have to take a look at the cheaper side of things but I know bva and enerpac electric hydraulic pumps start in the $1.2k range.  
AS far as my presses go if you are in the US I don't supply the hydraulics as you'll be able to order them state side for much cheaper than I can offer after accounting for customs and shipping fees.   
my sets are designed around BVA's low profile cylinder packages which can be ordered here for the cheapest pricing you'll likely find online. (this is the manual pump package, can also be pieced together without the pump)

my presses start at $1200 usd on the 4x4 unit without the tilting locking base for drip tech or hydraulics and go upwards of $1950 on my largest 5x9 unit without the tilting locking base, custom sizing and options are also available as I make everything in house."

AskReddit,fcn5m61,t1_fcn2cq3,1577803891.0,really depends on what you are picking up and from whom. I can get some decent shorts 5-6' at  $6 / bdft with the more standard lengths of 8' + in the $9-10/ bdft. This bedroom set was actually picked up recently to replace all the furniture in my room which I lost to a house fire so I was set on finding something that will last and I can easily repair/refinish when needed. Belonged to an old man who has since passed on so it's likely haunted as well which is pretty neat.

If however you go to a local cabinet shop your margins are generally much better and quality goes up substantially to the point the amount you pay makes sense given how long the furniture will last."
woodworking,fclzb36,t1_fclyhr6,1577760175.0,"apparently he does the engraving using a cnc mill, not a laser engraver. As for the burnt wood portion, the laser can make a secondary light power pass to clean up the surface residue left over from the high power passes, not sure how much work needs to be done off the machine tho. You can see the end results in the video I posted where he mentions some post process cleanup but I'm not sure if he's referring to work done on a computer and translated to a laser as his wording is a bit ambiguous."

I do make some presses which may be suitable for yourself. They normally  use manual hydraulic pumps but they are two stage pumps to make for quicker advancing of the ram, can also order electric hydraulic pumps in place of the manual pump but things get a bit pricier going that route."
