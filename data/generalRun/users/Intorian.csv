dogswithjobs,feon78r,t1_feku4a0,1579302534.0,Hey! can I DM you a few questions? I have a friend whos applying for a CCI dog so Im kinda curious.
dogswithjobs,feomnty,t3_epznw7,1579302269.0,"Hey there! This may be better fit for r/aww and not r/dogswithjobs due to no job serious or silly being present. I understand your dog is an ESA, however ESAs (Emotional Support Animals) are not working dogs, they're pets with a small bit of extra privilages (No pet housing and on planes)."
dogswithjobs,fe0glbz,t1_fdxttrb,1578813113.0,"Service Dog handler/trainer here to give my input! 
 
Service Dogs are tasked trained to migrate someones disabilities or disability, to qualify for a Service Dog your disabilities must prevent one or more major life activity. A example being unable to go into public due to being blind, unable to go outside due to PTSD, and much more. If your disability doesnt prevent quiality of life you most likely do not qualify for a SD. Another thing is that its highly suggest to talk to your doctors to see if they agree a Service Dog may be fitting for you.

However beyond that, I am concerned of your dogs age. She in my eyes, is far to old to work. It'd be unfair on your dog to work her at a very elderly age. Most SDs I know retire around 6/7 years. Your dog does have tasks from what Im reading and at most could be only a at home Service Dog. (Basically a SD but no PA rights if that makes sense.) 

Highly suggest you go to r/service_dogs for more info."

dogswithjobs,fdg7e1j,t1_fdf8rpx,1578383091.0,"Any breed of dog can be violent, its a matter of genetics and how the owner handles the dog, along side experinces the dog may have had. Mals are GREAT working dogs in general, they can also be great pets to the right people. Myself, I plan on getting on from a good breeder. PD dogs serve quite a lot of purposes, some can find people which is tracking, there are Narco dogs who scent for illegal drugs or even weapons, some assist with patrols and taking down dangrous people."

dogswithjobs,fd3yeb0,t1_fd3a7ce,1578162730.0,"You've also can see many injuries from regular collars, harnesses, gentle leaders. Blame the users who abuse the tool, not the tool itself, and keep bashing others out of here."
dogswithjobs,fd3xug2,t3_ejpilr,1578162577.0,"Okay guys. Knock it off with the anti-prong stuff. We get it, not everyone likes prongs, ecollars ect. However if used correctly and fit properly there is NO problem. ANY tool can be used wrongfully even your beloved gentle leader. In the end of the day, your dog, your choice. Dont want to use a prong? Fine, your choice. Want to use a prong? Fine, your choice again. This is a WORKING DOG sub, expect to see prongs, ecollars, slip collars, muzzles to be used! My own fully trained Service Dog has both a ecollar and prong, both wonderful commucations tools for us. So if you want to bash anyone for the tools, go on and go at me, not some random user."
peopleofwalmart,fczs3w1,t1_fbjy5id,1578107676.0,"Not a muzzle, those are gentle leaders. Huge diffrence..Also Service Dogs dont have licenses, along as most states do have it illegal to knowingly falsafy a pet as a Service Dog but its not really enforced."

dogswithjobs,fcx6t33,t1_fctqqhr,1578053594.0,"There is no problem with a legit ESA actually proscribed to people for mental issues. While I do not really agree on ESAs on planes unless VERY well behaved or possibly CGC passed as sadly there is a lot of ill behaved ESAs legit and fake, but there are also a lot of ill behaved real service dogs.  My SD and I ran into some before and sadly they're often program dogs. (nothing against program dogs, there are plenty of great ones, but  Im a fully OTed handler so ðŸ˜…)

This person isnt really doing anything wrong, from the looks of it too, her ESA may be legit. They're arent going out of there way and trying to cause trouble for SD handlers."
dogswithjobs,fcx6bxb,t3_ej2rcr,1578053044.0,"Love seeing legit small dog teams! Would honestly love to teach my PSD/MA dog this but think it'd interfer with her 'cover' and 'around' command and task ðŸ˜… worth a shot though! 

Remember everyone, ANY breed of dog can be a Service Dog but not every dog will make it as one, as well as a PSD or Psychiatric Service DogÂ are legit Service Dogs and NOT for emotional support."
CatsAreAssholes,fcoxlih,t3_eibw6t,1577844371.0,Poor cat shouldnt be held that way..Nor manhandled.
dogswithjobs,fc823hy,t1_fc81qf9,1577524860.0,"Again, have the ADA with you. Also you don't sue them, all you do is [Report them](https://www.ada.gov/criminaljustice/cj_complaint.html) and the rest is handled the via the justice system. Fight for your rights. Service Dogs take up two years to train, they're highly trained dogs for disabilities, not pet, not ESAs. Also your vest says ESA, so a lot of that makes sense since ESAs have no access rights.."
dogswithjobs,fc812ro,t1_fc80p86,1577524050.0,"Seriously dude. Dont use a ID, federal law trumps state. I also seriously doubt any ID is required as no states require them. IDs are a major issue, you'd be causing many others who may go to where you go access issues because they know the law and know that its stupid to waste money on a scan that helps no one but the user. One handler/trainer to another, stop. We're all trying to get you to understand it seems."
dogswithjobs,fc7zrp2,t1_fc7yxex,1577523019.0,"No. They're not useful, they're anything but useful. They cause other legit teams MAJOR issues when people start demanding a peice of paper or card someone got online so Fido can go ""with them everywhere"".  They have no legal standing at all."
dogswithjobs,fc7zlbo,t1_fc7xz03,1577522881.0,"While its true most Service Dogs knows vest means work, Service Dogs should also be able to work without them either way and its still completely optional to have them wearing any show they're a service dog or not. Also trust me, the public will still try to pet, call and more to youe SD lol. They rarely actuall read the vests. For denial of access they're breaking federal law by not allowing your SD access, vest or not and you can fight it or report it to HUD. Highly suggest having the ADA website ready or ADA cards for encounters like these."
dogswithjobs,fc7izp6,t1_fc6dxy1,1577508926.0," IDs are 100% scams if from online  just as a heads up as well as [ADA law ](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html#exc) states service dogs DO NOT have to wear anything that states them as a Service Dog, as well as IDs are not within rights of the ADA and do not prove your dog as a Service Dog, they just cause issue for legit teams."
dogswithjobs,fc7goen,t1_fc7g24g,1577506881.0,"Honestly quite a bit of my Service Dogs tasks dont require handler focus, its not really a requirment for 100% focus. My Service Dog for example, only checks in with me beyond a few focused tasks like disruption and alert. , Beyond that, shes focused on our surroundings. A few tasks are: getting help, item retrevial, front or back blocking, finding exits, finding a person, finding the car, corner checking, patrols."
dogswithjobs,fc4crbx,t1_fc4c23h,1577412908.0,"While discouraged, not impossible. I know quite a few SD/TD combo teams from smaller programs, and for the training, it all depends on what the dog is being trained for Service Dog wise generally speaking. In all honesty, this topic was major conterversy in the SD community lol.  Just becuase major programs dont do it by their own choice doesnt mean anyone else cant. In the end of the day, there is nothing stating a Service Dog cannot become a possible Therpy dog. Only thing they're forbidden to be are  generally Personal Protection Dogs, Police Dogs, Military Working Dogs."
dogswithjobs,fc3vzyd,t1_fbzvblc,1577400053.0,"Actually they're not. It all depends on the Therapy Dog program,  most do not accept Service Dogs, but some do."
dogswithjobs,fc3vrhd,t1_fc09dnc,1577399879.0," Please note, hes not a legit ESA unless he's been proscribed by someone consistantly treating your mom for any mental illnesses she may have. Anything online for ESAs or Service Dogs is a scam."
HumansBeingBros,fbwdr2u,t1_fbvl0d9,1577147243.0,"There is also a huge play on genetrics but how how they were trained or treated. The best treated dog can end up aggressive becuase of genetrics. Pointers will point, borders will herd, mals will work. Its how they are genetrically. Bully breeds are genetically prone to some type of aggression, some less likely, some more. Its also to mention, not every blocky head dog is a Pitbull. The only real Pit is the APBT which is a game breed."
