television,fenw9yq,t1_fenf977,1579291771.0,This is a good take. Critical thinking and basic budgeting need to be taught at the high school level like a motherfucker
books,fenoshl,t3_eq3kyq,1579288737.0,"*The Once and Future King* by T. H. White. Towards the end of the first section there’s a scene where Wart’s been left behind while Ector and Kay go off to the tournament and is sad, lonely, and sulking in the kitchen. Merlin tells him the best thing to do when you’re sad or lonely is learn something. I was going through a particularly sad and lonely time in my life, fresh out of college and fresh out of the closet, and that part really helped me. I still revisit it from time to time when I need a little boost."

SelfAwarewolves,fehvmet,t3_ep7nq0,1579124761.0,Yes cause in utero fetuses who can’t survive outside the womb are just as deadly as guns. Somehow I’d forgotten all of those mass fetusings we’ve been having problems with for the past thirty fucking years

moviescirclejerk,fee8mlc,t1_fee64c8,1579028655.0,In all honesty is solidly made and Joaquin is electric in it. For me *Joker*’s greatest sin is it really isn’t very surprising. Basically once all the characters are established you pretty much know what’s gonna happen. But it’s not bad. I certainly expected to cringe much much more than I did while watching it

I realize Cash had his at a refuge but a lot of farmers thought ostrich and emu were going to be the next big meat for whatever reason. Growing up in Alabama in the 90s you’d still hear about wild ones running about and wreaking havoc, I had a history teacher w a farm who would regularly have to shoot ostriches or emus (it’s been 20 yrs, not sure which now) that were attacking his cattle."

If it's something you're interested in the book *Room to Dream,* co written by Lynch and Kristine McKenna, goes in to quite a bit of detail regarding his general approach to sound design, as well as how he works with Angelo Badalamenti on the scores for his stuff (it's got Lynch's take on the composition of [the Laura Palmer theme, as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-eqgr_gn4k))."

SequelMemes,fd47ndd,t1_fd42wv5,1578165109.0,"I mean for a while there Luke had an active Jedi temple and the Resistance’s leader has had Jedi training, I don’t find it far fetched. They also say “may the force be with you” pretty frequently.

It seems more and more in new canon that people directly involved w the new republic/resistance and/or people from more developed planets have a better knowledge of at least the Jedi compared to people from more rural planets, which makes a certain amount of sense given like there were only like, what, 10k Jedi at the time of the prequels?"
