bigseo,ff7qghy,t3_es0mi1,1579655867.0,"Does time on page matter? Long articles of bullshit keep the page time higher.  Or does google supposedly count words? I hate it tho. Can’t read any damn articles on iPhone updates without a bs history of the last 4 updates before I get a relevant line. I skip straight to the bottom now  

If people do this and bounce faster does that hurt more than the gain of #of words?"
bigseo,ff7q7mr,t1_ff79o96,1579655693.0,I don’t think that’s the case. They need volume of words and that’s how they do it. Same with tech sites. Look at any article like “iOS 13.3 changes” and you will be given 6 paragraphs of total shit before you get 3 lines of relevance.
todayilearned,ff6urk1,t3_ersaty,1579635297.0,Plenty of people are bored during Michael bay movies. Explosions != guaranteed excitement. I think it’s totally reasonable to be bored at exploding things. Disinterest != depression. People who are depressed absolutely should get treatment and help. But i think these generalizations make people think they might be depressed when they are totally fine and may make things worse.

Zoho,ff30tst,t1_ff2zr4y,1579530650.0,"It could be but your monthly will be $175/mo. If you use the tools well the you will get value from it. It all depends on what tools you are using tho. Campaigns, CRM, analytics,wiki, desk, survey, assist... those
All are very useful and are better than free options for sure. Those apps would make up the price, the other apps you may be able to get free stuff for similar effectiveness. I prefer gmail/gsuite for email so I don’t put sheets/writer or Zoho mail in there because I would use something else. If your books aren’t too complex Zoho books would save you $30/mo Over QuickBooks. 

Again just all depends on what tools you use."
