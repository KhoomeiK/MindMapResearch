My experience taught me that there can be little time to grieve while handling funeral arrangements, figuring out estates assets, dealing with extended family, meeting religious obligations, handling paper work and so on. Knowing the following will free you up to focus on your Dad when the time comes:

- Know where all the important documents are
- Know what funeral arrangements have been paid for (if at all) and where all related documents are (some funeral homes will deny pre-paid service if you can't prove it was paid for)
- Know what kind of services he will want
- Ask your father if he needs to update any beneficiaries (my mother wanted this done while she was dying and it was incredibly stressful to get the proper paperwork, find an unrelated witness, have her sign, and fax the paperwork while she was still conscious and *hope* there were no mistakes)
- Ask for a copy of his trust if he has one and know who will administer the estate once he is incapacitated or passes
- Know who his lawyer, CPA and financial adviser is if he has any
- Ask how much privacy he'll want when he's in the hospital (if he ends up there) and enforce his wishes. My sisters and I asked this too late and my mother's last days where a tiring circus of endless visitors.

You'll cry when it happens, but the full weight of his passing may hit you much later. I didn't cry when my mother died. I didn't cry when dealing with relatives or settling funerals arrangements. I didn't cry during the nine days of rosary, masses said on her behalf or the time leading up to the funeral. I shed a few tears when my mother was buried but went on with my day after.

It wasn't until a stranger said hi to me on the street several weeks later did I break down in tears. No one would ever say ""hi"" to her again. She was gone. I sobbed in the arms of a stranger. I didn't understand it, but I couldn't stop it either and the kind stranger just held me.

This was beyond stupid, that someone would be desperate to strip me of my minority identity because I did not think the way they wanted me to.

One thing that I've learned from these encounters is that **they don't see their actions as racist**. On the contrary, they appear to qualify a racial slur as being on par with calling someone stupid if certain conditions are met, such as a Mexican saying they aren't a Democrat. All of a sudden, I'm not worth respecting and am fair game when it comes to racial slurs, because it's not *really* racist if I'm not on their team.

During fall and winter, **Pilea peperomioides fall into dormancy and stop growing**. This is absolutely normal. Dormancy is triggered by a temperature drop in the weather and the plant comes out of it when temperatures warm. Come spring, the plant will continue to grow.

There is no rush with the Pilea P. pups. You can leave them there to grow below the Mama plant or seperate them into separate pots at any time. 

If you don't repot annually, use liquid fertilizer (10-10-10 is fine) during spring and summer (its growing seasons) once a month. Just make sure to water the soil an hour before applying liquid fertilizer. Also make sure to dilute the fertilizer as directed. If you want to repot the lot into something bigger, you can do it now, it's not necessary to wait untilspring. I like using a 50/50 soil blend of cactus soil and regular potting soil for indoor Pilea p. plants. I use E.B. Stone for my soil and avoid Miracle Gro.

It's normal for the lower leaves to cycle out. As the plant grows bigger, this will slow down.

Do not water on a set schedule as its watering needs will change with the seasons. Water only when the soil is dry, leaf stems just begin to droop and the leaves a touch soft. Personally, I like using the soaking method, but watering from the top is fine too. Make sure the pot has drainage and that it never sits in it's own water run-off for more than a day. Terracotta (avoid ones made in China--the quality is low an encourages mold growth) and clay pots (with drainage) work best.

Strong, indirect light next to source window or direct morning light. Rotate the 90° every few days to keep growth even, or don't. A cascading, Pilea P. is incredibly beautiful.

A family friend placed herself in a similar situation with a recently adopted Golden Lab. Her and her three sons went balls to the wall with touch and physical affection without giving the dog space to acclimate to its new surroundings. They didn't allow the dog to familiarize itself with the new family and the dog didn't know where it fit in with the hierarchy of the family because they let it do what ever it wanted. 

The friend figured everything was going well and was posting daily on social media about the new dog, but every fucking photo the dog looked uncomfortable.

I called her and asked if she could maybe give the dog some space before being so familiar with the pooch, but she (understandably) got upset. I essentially questioned her judgement and she shot back at me that she had a Golden Lab before and that it was an excellent dog. I remembered that dog. It was a nightmare in public and destructive at home, but she at least knew that dog since she raised it from a pup. She did not know this dog.

Surprise surprise, a week later, the dog bit her, bit all three kids and viciously attacked two co-workers (yes, dumb-ass took the dog to work after it bit everyone at home) after telling them the dog was friendly.  

She posted about the experience on social media and how unfortunate it was that the dog wasn't what it portrayed itself to be, completely overlooking her own careless stupidity in handling an unfamiliar dog.

They use software that will aggregate all the best policies that best fit your criteria and requirements. Their experience can also lead you in the right direction or help you avoid policies you don't need. And, as always, shop around before settling on a company or agent. 

Places like Farmers, All State and the like sell proprietary products only and should be avoided since they will only sell you on company policies which are likely not the best policies out in the market. 

The earlier you can get yourself long term care, the better. Getting it too late in life can result in refusal of coverage or insane premiums.

It's common for a plant this size to drop leaves more frequently than older plants as long as it's the oldest leaves. Do not remove dying leaves, but allow the plant to pull nutrients from it and drop it on its own.

As long as you water the plant only when the soil is dry, leaf stems *just* begin to droop and the leaves are a tad soft to the touch, it'll be fine. Never let it sit in water run-off for more than a day (at most). Cactus soil is ideal (since it's a succulent), but for dry, indoor environments, a 50/50 soil blend of cactus soil and regular potting soil (avoid Miracle Gro) is best.

Lots of strong indirect light close to the source window or direct morning sun is also recommended.

dogs,fdl1shw,t1_fdg2qdu,1578515566.0,">I own a pit bull and I would never ever in a million years let a child walk him. He's almost 100lbs...

**I just saw a kid 10 year old get pulled down to the ground yesterday by a 20 pound dog** trying to make it's way to another dog. Partner had to run over and help because the dog it was pulling towards was an elderly, aggressive Golden Retriever we were familiar with (we run our pittie at the park every day and know the regulars). Parents of the kid were on the other side of the park. They got an earful from us. That Golden Retriever is not just dog aggressive, but aggressive towards strangers. I just don't understand how some people can be so fucking careless with their kids lives."
dogs,fdl0gb9,t1_fdgeus6,1578514864.0,"My pittie has been attacked twice by a Boxer and a mixed breed boxer. He was almost blinded in one eye by a chihuahua that lunged and bit his lower lid. I won't even get into the encounter with a giant poodle (was never so afraid of a dog in my life).

In all instances he was hurt and bleeding, vomiting from the stress. In all instances he hurt no one or dog. In the aftermath, I held resentment towards the breeds, but after calming down, I knew it wasn't the breeds involved, it was the shitty owners. Careless, reckless assholes who put my dog and I in an awful position. I had to kick an attacking dog off my dog to save it on a walk (owner kept insisting it was playing and did nothing until I intervened until I did). My partner had to pull a large attacking dog off our dog and threaten to kill it JUST to get the owner to *finally* clip her dog and drag it out of the dog park. That chihuahua was off leash when it ran up to my dog and bit its lid. The owner said it was nothing, I told her I'd take her ass to court if it blinded my dog (lives on the other side of the block) and that I'd punt her dog if I ever saw it loose around my dog again. 

I called the cops on the first guy. I use to see him and his dog walk without a leash, not anymore. Lady at the dog park booked it before the cops arrived. Lady with the chihuahua scoops up her untrained dog and crosses the street when she sees me now. I do not believe in breed regulations, but I do believe all potential dog owners should take classes on local dog laws, dog training,  etiquette, and dog breeds. I also believe shelters should work harder to steer adopters towards appropriate dogs that would better suite the person. Like, an apartment city dweller who will be gone for 12 hours each work day with little to no play time has no business owning a Husky (a acquaintance just did this and is now returning her ""dream dog"" because she wanted what she wanted, not what would fit her lifestyle best).

Education is the best tool out there, not fear.

I'm sorry you had to suffer through an attack. It's awful and the guilt of ""what could I had done to avoid this"" will plague you for weeks, but the stupid owner is at fault here, not the dog. Call the non-emergency line for the police and report what happened and how the owner not only put you and both dogs in danger, but put their children in harm's way as well.

Good luck."

AskReddit,fdjmhxv,t1_fdj3mh1,1578478035.0,"You don't combat it, you talk to them rationally. Dont play the blame-game and don't bullshit them, just talk calmly to them so they can hear you out,  but they deserve the same courtesy; hear them out too. Also, ask yourself--in an objective manner--what your part has been in all this.

I don't know what caused them to do this and I'm unsure you'll give an account that will honestly reflect what's happened, but in the instance where I've done this myself, my kids had been given a dozen chances prior to rectify the offending matter, knowing what consequences would occur if they didn't. 

If there is something more going on and parents won't consider group therapy, reach out to a school counselor. They will make time for you when ever you feel like talking, but always maintain honesty throughout. 

When my kids asked me what they could do to prevent me from taking phones, games, tablets, and laptops away I was dumbstruck. 

""Just listen to me the first time around. Don't push the generous curfew (as long as they had good grades, chores and homework were done, they could be out as late as midnight). Don't lie about projects and homework.  Don't sass me then turn around and ask me for money (this never worked out for them). Don't tell me I do nothing for you while I'm making your dinner and have your laundry going. Don't be ungrateful for what you have and tell me it's not enough.""

They scoffed. It couldn't be that simple! But Occam's Razor rings true--the simplest solution is usually the right one. The older one ended up taking what was said to heart. He was 16 when he stopped the shenanigans. The younger one took a while longer because he was younger, but he got there. Speaking calmly and rationally, maintaining good grades and helping out around the house got them what they wanted and kept them out of trouble at home"

NEVER pull off dying leaves. Let the plant take all the nutrients it can from the leaf and allow the leaf to drop on its own.

Fertilize a few times during the growing season (spring and summer), but if you repot annually, it is not needed then. When using liquid fertilizer, dilute properly (as directed on the bottle) and water the plant an hour prior to adding the diluted fertilizer. Never apply fertilizer to dry soil, else you'll risk fertilizer burns on the roots and leaves. Repotting is recommended during spring, but if you feel compelled, the plant can be repotted any time of the year.

All that aside, keep doing what you're doing. Good job!"
