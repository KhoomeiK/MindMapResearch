One fine afternoon, after renewals were all processed, my night security who lives on site was in the office BSing with me as we watched ESPN. Suddenly we heard very loud POP POP POP and, ill advisedly, we head out of the lobby to see what’s going on. This is when we see a fella running down the hill from
The chicken place holding his belly. As he got closer you could see the blood. He made it about halfway across the property before he collapsed. Security guy was already on the phone with 911. At this time we hear an engine rev and tires squeal. We turn to see a black sedan with dark tinted windows race into the parking lot heading the wrong way. It stops. Two guys get out, pick up the first fella, throw him in the back, and drove off tires squealing. Never saw a cop or ambulance at all. Guess they figured he was taken care of. We just went about our day."
