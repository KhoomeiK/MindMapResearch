creepyencounters,ffpaet1,t1_ffp9nuq,1580090154.0,"I didn't ask for suggestions or advice... I'm only hear to share my story. I didn't take a picture because A) I didn't want to risk provoking the guy further, and B) I was ON my phone texting and than calling my parents. I get trying to be helpful, and that's fine, but you can be helpful without being condescending. Without coming off like I'm to blame for being creeped on. Implying that my extremely tame story is made up (because...why? 80 karma?). I've seen the exact same attitude on other people's posts, and it's not actually helpful to anyone. The advice can be, but not the belittlement."
