We all buy the same game and we all play together because none of us have the time to get good.  Right now we're all playing COD:MW.  The coop is a lot of fun for us.  And no one gets pissy when someone goes AFK because the kids are hungry or the dog needs to go out."

We've all had big jobs where a few engines fuck up water pressure for any surrounding residents.  62 deck guns operating at once is quite the engineering achievement.

I wonder if it's only designed to run a few at a time over an extended period.  And it only runs a short time when they test them all at once."

Firefighting,fffawk5,t3_etacyl,1579879922.0,"One of absolute favorite things about being a firefighter is meeting literally any other firefighter from anywhere in the world and knowing they get it.

The mixture of joy, terror, and adrenaline as you race to the incident.  And then once you've broken the plain from safety into  personal danger the abrupt change to, ""All right you son of a bitch.  I'm coming for you."" and a relentless focus.

And then the weird humor that follows as you head to rehab and the property owner thanks you destroying their personal property.
