Here is the problem as I see it

1. You want to profit off of not-for-profit fundraising

2. You don’t want church fundraisers to have alcohol for that reason

3 The members of your community don’t have a problem with it

You need to ask yourself if it’s worth the risk. You said yourself “the cops don’t care I have to explain liquor regulations to them constantly” sounds like your less then popular with them. I say stay in your lane and make more money, tangling with churches and schools is going to cost you a lot more the long run. This post does not make it sound like your part of the community.

Some 3$ razor sharp dexter pairing knives from restaurant depot. Take a great edge 

The two wooden handled pairing knives were part of a lau kingdom 60 dollar from amazon.

8” Mac chefs knife, it’s super thin and light, stays crazy sharp

Another Chinese knife that turned out to be a real good value is the 20 dollar clear, it’s heavy, good workhorse

The rest of that lau kingdom set that pulls backup/guest duty now.
