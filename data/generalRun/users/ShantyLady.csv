AskReddit,ffn4ned,t3_eu6iol,1580062044.0,"Back when I had LimeWire, I wanted to find a song that I had heard on the radio. So I typed it in, and found several results that could be the song. Now, for those who don't know, LimeWire was a Russian roulette of files. You could have several results available, but one could be the original song, one could be a techno core remix of said song, or you could get a completely random video file instead.

So now that I've got my files downloaded, I decided to check them out. The first file is the song that I want. Great! The second file is a quirky remix that I didn't mind to I kept that too. I click on the third and...

It's of a chick, at her computer, with some 90's techno in the background. She's naked, and masturbating to the beat of the song.

TEALDEER: I wanted a to find a song on LimeWire and got off instead."

polyamory,ffc6868,t3_ess7p9,1579792487.0,"I'm of the belief that you can have multiple ways of loving, including romantic, sexual, or platonic. One does not take priority over another. This may be because I have a big heart for people, but if I was in a relationship with someone and I couldn't provide what they're looking for, but still wanted to be with me, I'd be okay with letting them go and find that missing piece. Communication is everything to me.
