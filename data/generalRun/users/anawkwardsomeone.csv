friends_tv_show,fgk2317,t3_eyxw7g,1580855890.0,"For me, it’s the one with the ball. It’s very uneventful and not very memorable. But to me it’s what the show is all about: six young adults adulting and being friends. The fact that they called in sick from work to throw around a ball is just so damn cute and makes me wish I had friends like that with which I could be stupid like that."

AvPD,ffwlh3d,t3_evl0ij,1580304705.0,"I have been there. At my last job people would look at me like I was an alien every time I would open my mouth. Or they would stare at me blankly and stay silent for a few seconds after I’ve finished my sentence like what I just said wasn’t enough or clear. I know how it feels and how much it sucks.

But you have to remember that we tend to make things in our head into a bigger deal than it is. A good trick is to just assume in your head that everyone goes through similar stuff. Everyone is afraid of being excluded or miss-judged. But the tiniest “bump” can seem extremely negative in our heads.

Since I see that you quit, remember this for your next job: they can’t fire you for “being too quiet”. It’s just not a valid reason, so no supervisor will fire you just for that. As long as you’re doing your job, you’re safe."
lonely,ffutau0,t3_ev4urh,1580248937.0,This is all the stuff I’m going through right now. I used to be very social and happy as a kid. College messed me up.
Instagramreality,ffurp8c,t3_ev5wvp,1580248075.0,"I hate that “Billie Eilish edgy teen stoned eyes” pose. It looks so boring to me and it’s so over-done. 

The pic on the right looks like an actual human. So much more character in it, so much more uniqueness."
