1. Because some doctors don’t know how any of this works. 

You’re likely correct. The insurance is denying coverage at the moment. The pharmacy is the middle man and tells the doctor that the insurance isn’t covering it. 

2. The insurance is denying coverage right now, but it is “in process” because the doctor can usually do paperwork to get the medication approved. 

They need to prove that it is truly medically necessary over the medication that the insurance would normally cover. Then the insurance can approve or deny it. Then someone can let the pharmacy know and they can reprocess it."

The only real mistake they made imo was unrealistic expectations. They should have just told you it would be an hour wait and then bumped the med to the top anyway.

I have hormonal acne and was on spironolactone when I first got my IUD. I’m now off of it and my acne has come back but not *nearly* as bad as it used to be. So I’m not sure if it’s just from getting off spiro, or the IUD, or both."

pharmacy,fekm5yl,t3_epezcr,1579202932.0,"Sounds like a bad environment.

I work at three letter and yeah the patients can be awful...but at least coworkers and pharmacists usually back me up or at least sympathize. Why was your boss angry with you?"

This is America. Protesting and freedom of speech and whatnot are in the Bill of Rights, etc. etc. 

Megaphones and shouting? Wear headphones. Or you’ll probably just get used to it. It becomes background noise. 

They’re blocking the sidewalk? Say excuse me and try to get through. If they don’t let you then just keep walking through them.

Edit:

Why would you need to loop around an area to not talk to someone? Just don’t talk to them. You should be walking briskly enough that they feel a breeze when you go by and they’ll barely be able to even get a word out. Just walk."
PharmacyTechnician,fek4hfe,t3_epkvpe,1579192420.0,"9/10 times it’s the wrong coupon

1. Has to be for your pharmacy. Often patients select the cheapest one and I have to point out that that is the price if they use the coupon at Walmart, Costco, etc. 

2. Has to be for the correct drug. They may have typed in albuterol inhaler and accidentally selected the generic ventolin instead of generic proair. 

3. Strength of the med can matter too when it’s not something like an inhaler. Sometimes the system defaults. If I type in Wellbutrin XL it defaults to Bupropion XL 300mg. Price might be different for the 150mg. 

4. Has to be the correct quantity. If patient is getting 3 inhalers and they typed in that they’re getting 1, the price will be off.

If everything is input correctly then the coupon usually shows the right price or pretty close to it.

Edit:

But if it’s still wrong then I just tell them that prices can change and maybe the coupon hasn’t been updated on their website yet."

pharmacy,feitd3e,t3_epdf5u,1579146696.0,"Well for one, how will they know which car is yours? But park under a street light or well lit area if you can. 

I don’t work in the best area but it’s also not the worst. We’ve had really long wait times lately too. Honestly I’ve just started expediting things and filling them right away. Fast. Patient is at the drive thru and med is in QP? Fill it while they’re sitting there. Tell pharmacist pt is in drive thru and they can do QV2 fast. Done. 

Yeah your other stuff might go red, but the patient in front of you is the one you need to focus on and is the one that could get angry. If they’re nice (and especially if it’s just a maintenance med) I tell them there’s a wait. Unfortunate that the bad apples get better treatment, but it keeps everything a little more calm."

SkincareAddiction,fefae0n,t1_fef7z9f,1579051940.0,"Yeah I’d maybe try some stuff for psoriasis and see how it goes. These are 2 products that I like...

[Gold Bond Psoriasis Cream](https://goldbondultimate.com/product/multi-symptom-psoriasis-relief/) 

[MG217 Ointment](https://www.mg217.com/products/psoriasis/medicated-coal-tar-ointment/) - careful, this one can stain stuff and has a bit of a smell. I saw that they have a gel too which might be better than the ointment. 

The key to (mild or moderate) psoriasis is alternating products. I go back and forth between those 2. Give it at least a week or so to see improvements. 

They have these at CVS, Walgreens, etc. and probably Amazon and so on as well."

Beach water always helped my psoriasis. This doesn’t look quite as flaky/dry as psoriasis though.

What has the derm said? Have they mentioned what they think it might be? Have you gotten a second opinion?

Have you tried any over the counter stuff for eczema or psoriasis? Not just moisturizers. Either something with salicylic acid (psoriasis), coal tar (psoriasis), or colloidal oatmeal (eczema)."

Or come in on a day you’re not working. If you get hired straight to the pharmacy that’s what you have to do. I had to come in, clock in, do 1 module, and leave sometimes."
