Your version of poor is not everyone's version of poor. You've already failed at trying to actually understand what life could be like for someone less privileged than yourself. Where are you that education is free? Do you mean secondary school, or primary? Did you know that some children get recruited *during school hours*, when they are <12 years old to sell their bodies, or commit crimes for cash? And that some of these children take them up on their offers because they wouldn't have access to food otherwise? Recess was cancelled indefinitely at certain schools in my city because so many children were being approached to join gangs and commit crimes during regular school hours. Did you know that some children are injected with drugs without their consent before they are sold off to other people for sex? Do you think that children who grow up this way turn into well rounded adults? Children who get syringes filled with narcotics as christmas gifts, and are taught how to scam doctors for drugs on the weekend rather than play recreational sports? Who do you choose to punish? The adults who do this to their children, when this was what was done to them? Do you think taking these children away from their families, and having them grow up in foster care is helping them all? It's not. The evidence proves it's not. We don't need to punish the poor. We need to support them, and help them out of cycle of abuse that is causing them to live this way. People don't know what they don't know. They need help, and understanding. There are too many people like you who want to hurt those who are already suffering, and this is why things don't get better."
Political_Revolution,ffha7z9,t1_ffgyux3,1579927668.0,"People will just downvote you, but do you understand why the poor tend to have more children? Do you think it's purely for welfare cheques? Or can you understand that there is a major lack of education and resources to support this demographic of people to prevent unwanted pregnancies. That maybe religion in lower class communities plays a major part in their decision making process, in that abortion is more than frowned upon. Or that a lot of the women who become pregnant are drug users, or prostitutes, or both, who are so fucked up in life that you can't punish them away from their decisions. Their whole lives are a form of punishment. If you can look at the truly poor, and downtrodden and honestly not feel sorry for them, then you're part of the problem, and I highly recommend you start making an effort to expose yourself to those who are far, far less privileged than yourself."

As for coming from dysfunction, I think most of us do, but awareness is really important, and at least you have that. There is no shortage of good information available to help guide you, but you have to be wary of the bad information out there too. subs like this one are here to offer evidence based, positive parenting. We're here because we're looking to provide our children with the most well rounded childhood, that is supported by science. Being a good parent is harder than just being a parent, but what makes a good parent is still subjective, and our kids will still likely turn out alright even if you're not perfect, but the goal is for our kids to become amazing adults because of their childhood, not despite it. And the work is hard. And pretty well constant. And your relationship with your husband will suffer at times because of it. But the highs are pretty damn high.

We kept my youngest in our room until she was sleeping through the night, which took a full 12m, so that alone was not great, then when we finally got them in the same room, it took a month of them waking each other up at random times to finally get a routine figured out. My oldest, who never used to come to our room, was now coming to sleep in our bed every single night (lasted a solid 8 months), and if we put him back to his bed, we’d inevitably wake up our other child, who could take up to 2hrs go put back down. Not worth it. We try to stagger bedtimes, but if for some reason the younger one stays up late, we either have to keep the older one up later, or put them to bed in our room so they don’t keep each other up. They also wake each other up in the mornings, which overall isn’t a huge deal, but it does suck to be woken up by someone else rather than waking naturally.

It's definitely partially on your parents, you're not wrong for feeling that way, that's their job. To provide you with routine and structure, to help you succeed. Maybe you would have rebelled anyway, but knowing that you had the supports there if you wanted them could have made a difference. We're responsible for our own actions, yes, but anyone who doesn't think their parents play a huge part in how they turn into adults is fooling themselves, and is potentially setting themselves up to fail their kids in the same way.

You might be surprised at how quickly she moves on without it, but maybe she’ll really fight you.

AskReddit,fdnxt6c,t1_fdnlxtf,1578595029.0,"Some stuff is common ground, though. Like at the park, every kid has to share the slide, some household toys are like that too, but if you want your favourite stuffy, or toy to not be played with, then definitely put it away before company comes over. I don't force sharing (and it's my biggest bother from other parents at play groups, that causes all the kids to scream and cry), but I'm one of the few parents I've encountered."
nursing,fdne24y,t1_fdn6ypk,1578583818.0,"You preceptor should support you, not throw you to the wolves. This job is hard enough to not learn good practices, and organizational skills. You 100% shouldn't be expected to be at her level, and there is nothing wrong with that. Don't feel like you're not keeping up. I do recommend taking the time to figure out how you want to organize your day. If things aren't happening immediatley (everyone is safe, stable, and important meds aren't due at exactly the minute report is finished), I will take a few minutes to write out my day sheet. Some people go by hours of the day, I like to go by room, and write down what needs to be done for the day with dashes to check mark once completed. There should be time to organize yourself to some extent most days. If every day is so crazy you can't even do that, you need a new job."
beyondthebump,fdn6hmx,t1_fdkt9fk,1578578618.0,"You can’t spoil a baby by holding them, some just need to be held more, they physically need the touch/connection. My first was easier to sleep train, my second was much, much harder. Look into different methods, but think of this, any baby will cry when something changes. It’s their only way to communicate, so expect tears when you’re changing the routine, or doing something they don’t like, but provide them with live and support through the thing they don’t like, don’t just leave them to fend for themselves."
nursing,fdn5bfq,t1_fdn39ig,1578577700.0,"Can you ask to try precepting under someone else for a shift or two, to get a taste of how other people go about their day? Learning from more than one person will allow you to pick and choose what systems you like best. I recently trained in the OR on my maternal ward, and each person sets up their tools differently, so I’m always looking to see what i think I’d like better. 

Your preceptor sounds lazy to be honest. It can take up to a year in some places to truly get the hang of things. You don’t want to burn bridges,  but you’re unlikely to keep this job, or be successful at it, if you start out on such a bad foot. You won’t feel confident, and you won’t like the work you’re doing, because of it."
nursing,fdmf7gw,t3_em4at2,1578547906.0,"How do you organize yourself when you get on shift? Do you have time to make a schedule for the day, or write out the important things you need to get done? Is your preceptor helping, or just expecting you to do it all? Do you not know how to organize your time, is this your problem? Are you unsure how to prioritize, or is there just too much to do without help?"

Sometimes their protests need to be met with love and understanding for how difficult it can be for them. This mantra has you at the centre of your child's care, not your child's needs/wants. Treat your child the way you would want to be treated in their shoes."

These parents are obviously only showing OP conditional love, where they have to work for/win their affection.
