NintendoSwitch,fck4hvh,t1_fcjtyla,1577716340.0,"Awesome, thanks for the heads up! I stopped at FF8. Is it upscaled? (Does it have graphical improvements over the original, or is it a straight port?"
NintendoSwitch,fck49aa,t1_fcjwpf7,1577716138.0,"No I haven't. Still have Shrines and Korok Seeds to find, plus the Calamity Ganon fight, etc. I saw reviews of the DLC and determined that it wasn't worth it. However, I purchased a little plastic box with all the BOTW Amiibo NFC tags from Amazon for $20, so perhaps my judgement is skewed. Perhaps I WILL purchase the DLC...

PS- Yes, all the Amiibo NFC tags work, just not sure it was worth it. I thought I'd get a LOT more Arrows, but it turns out you hardly get any. And I'm tired of doing the Arrow glitch (running in circles getting shot at, save, load, repeat)."
NintendoSwitch,fcjolgt,t1_fcjo6r1,1577696801.0,"Thanks, I'll have to give it another shot. Got it on Steam over a year ago, but only played it for 15-20 minutes. REALLY excited for Baldur's Gate 3 from Larian!"
NintendoSwitch,fcjn0eh,t1_fcjmqkp,1577694583.0,"Thought about it, yes. But seeing as how I played BG1 and BG2 to absolute *DEATH* on PC, I may pass. Plus I just don't think anything but keyboard and mouse are acceptable considering the game design. Annnddd... gotta save $$ for BALDUR'S GATE 3 WOOOO!!!!
But thanks, once I get my retirement money I just might! Simply because they're my absolute favorite games of all time!"

Thanks for your recommendation, but I already have Divinity 2 on PC! Only played it for 10 minutes, I really should give it another shot. But I'm SUPER excited for Larian to finish Baldur's Gate 3!! 

On a side note, I may add Ni No Kuni: White Witch to my list..."
NintendoSwitch,fcjiyx6,t1_fcjiq3u,1577689418.0,"Hmm, ok it's considered. Eventually I'll purchase all of these. Basically just trying to determine the first one. I have no prior experience with Fire Emblem, so there's no nostalgia factor. However, it seems like it may have tactical game play like Shining Force or Final Fantasy Tactics. Maybe it will jump ahead of Witcher 3 and Diablo 3."
NintendoSwitch,fcji2ck,t1_fcjhs2s,1577688405.0,"Thanks, man! That's what I'm thinking also. As an old guy who played all the early games, including the first in the 80's... I think the nostalgia I'd get would help it surpass the other options."

Volkswagen,fc7my39,t3_egmi2e,1577512781.0,Actually it could be a *BRAKE* wear indicator rubbing on the rotor. This is basically advanced warning that you may need to replace the pads soon. Rust or moisture is usually more of a scraping or grinding noise that quickly goes away. A higher pitched squealing or squeaking is probably the aforementioned metal tab aka brake wear indicator.
