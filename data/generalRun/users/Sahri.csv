AskReddit,fgg2004,t1_fgfc592,1580752512.0,"I don't get why everyone is shitting so much on facebook and complain about the people and their content there.
Why do you add people/groups you despise and then complain about it? 

Only add the people you like/want to see stuff from and all is good. No shitty content if you keep shitty people at bay."
AskReddit,fgg1oho,t1_fgfuott,1580752310.0,"You still don't have to add any people you don't want to add, so still making it a nice and chill place.
If you keep adding people/ join groups you despise, it's your own fault what content you see there."
