nycrail,ffj5sh9,t3_etvhgr,1579991117.0,"It's definitely manageable from a financial perspective. The money that the subway system generated for the mta gets siphoned off to be used elsewhere anyway, it doesn't get reinvested in the system. Making it free would actually do away with some of the corruption in politics, instead of using it to bail out a ski resort upstate for a warm summer.  The New York Times did an interesting piece on it. https://youtu.be/COLMODzYX7U"
nycrail,ffj5ai8,t1_ffj0c98,1579990760.0,Maybe we could get rid of the corrupt policies that actually siphon money away from the subway system. Sounds like a pipe dream though.
nycrail,ffj57kf,t1_ffizqun,1579990700.0,"There are already homeless in the subway. It's super easy to hop turnstiles and even if they pay, it takes very little time to get $2.75 from panhandling if you want in the subway. I don't see there being much of an impact on this front."
todayilearned,ffj4vls,t3_etre48,1579990456.0,I could go for the deducted point for missed free throws. That would make the game interesting. Maybe try to foul the players that suck at free throws.

PremierLeague,fefqkl3,t1_fee0yzt,1579062370.0,There are a lot of championship teams I'd like to watch but I can never find a live stream in the US. Usually do NBCSN for premier league and TNT for champions league.
PremierLeague,fefqb7d,t3_eolj4q,1579062170.0,"When I first started watching in 2014 a few friends and I started a very casual fantasy league. We didn't know any of the players or teams very well. But when you know which players you want to do well it makes you care about which teams you want to watch and who you want to do well. Makes it more fun that way, then after a while you start to like some teams more than others. I had Skrtl from Liverpool on my team. I watched him, as a defender, get a head injury, wrapped his head, decided to keep playing, then score a goal (which I thought was a big deal, being a defender) but scored it with a header, with an injured, bandaged up head. Been a Liverpool fan since. 

As a side note, I tried getting into the New York Red Bulls, being from New York, and they're alright to watch. But with the structure of the MLS league I just really can't get into MLS. Hopefully one day they'll make a lot of necessary changes to the league."

nextfuckinglevel,fdra1ig,t1_fdqfvma,1578681576.0,It looks like someone holding a much smaller crane-looking thing that isn't even attached to that heavy machinery. The camera angle definitely makes it possible. Like a forced perspective thing.
todayilearned,fdqryqu,t1_fdqlhg0,1578673602.0,"As a doctor, I dread hearing that call on a plane for a doctor. If you're having a heart attack on a plane, there's not much I can do other than give you an aspirin. We're largely useless without our equipment, imaging, blood work, ekg's, etc. Personally I'd feel comfortable with a paramedic handling my care in that situation.

todayilearned,fdg7ioo,t1_fdg5f0d,1578383254.0,But who said anything about continents? We're talking about islands. I'd argue even a man made canal changes whether a landmass is an island or not.
todayilearned,fdg7fbv,t1_fdfq8wh,1578383138.0,"Since the Suez canal you could call Africa it's own landmass now, so you could make an argument that afroeurasia isn't an island."

Sometimes pharmaceutical-funded research invents a new drug and gets to name the generic form of it as well as the brand name. Take idarucizumab for example, very difficult to say correctly or even remember, but its brand name Praxbind™ is easy to remember, especially since that's what it does, bind to the drug Pradaxa™ (another brand name sold by the same company)."
