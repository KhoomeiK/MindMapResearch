Pumped water electricity storage is only about 75% efficient, maybe more with newer, better equipment. So that means you go to all that effort and expense to generate electricity, and if no one needs it you waste a quarter of it storing it until they do. 

Another method of electricity storage is a giant,  municipal sized battery. I think there's only a few of these in existence, they're very expensive and one the size of a building will only run a small city for like 10 minutes. 

A smaller scale method that is used in some server farms is a flywheel. A big, heavy wheel is kept spinning at all times. If power goes out, the wheel will start converting its kinetic energy into electricity. It'll only last 5 minutes or so, but that's more than enough time for the backup generators to kick on.
