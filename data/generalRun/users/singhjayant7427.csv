https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51224504

Wuhan has a hospital bed density of 6.5 beds per 1000 while Taiwan has a bed density of 6.9 and this is also higher than a lot of developed countries.

And a country's response to an outbreak is not a dick measuring contest you piece of shit."
dankmemes,ffpr3o4,t1_ffpgnwy,1580102730.0,"Lol What's wrong with banning fake news and propaganda? You do realise there's no truth to the Western narrative of a massacre...

Unarmed student protestors simply can't burn down tanks. Also, tanks trying to massacre civilians don't stop for a man, allow him to jump on, and then let him run away.

Soldiers were literally burnt alive in tanks and the ones who got out were beaten to death. Interesting why the soldiers wouldn't shoot if they were given orders for a massacre. But don't you worry about all these things, keep believing the massacre narrative with no evidence because the Western media tells you to and obviously they would never lie."
dankmemes,ffpoudc,t1_ffpd9q5,1580100665.0,"The fuck are you talking about? Wuhan already has lots of hospitals, however, it seems like given the seriousness of this particular disease, the government decided it is safer to have a separate temporary hospital that can be specially equipped to handle this disease.

This also avoids potentially exposing other patients (who may already have a weak immune system) to this disease."

PropagandaPosters,femgywm,t1_femehp4,1579255006.0,German prisoners after the war were used by the Allies as slaves to rebuild the damage they had done. But US used German prisoners as slaves when they didn't even cause any damage to US infrastructure in the first place.
WinStupidPrizes,femdzpa,t1_fely43b,1579250599.0,"Yup. Sending young, impressionable people into places filled with criminals is the easiest way to create more criminals."
artificial,fem4nje,t3_epmu8t,1579239624.0,"Forget everything else, I'd say you primary focus during the course should be a REALLY good book that focuses on math (Because the math is same for all the new research, they just find new ways to apply it)

I recommend Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop (personally I like this one better) and keep looking for new papers in your field. Maybe sift through them when you have the time and once a week try to understand and summarise the best ones. I like this approach for keeping up with the current SOA"

And I'm not throwing a bitchfit, YOU said I was high or something for no reason and then failed to back it up."
