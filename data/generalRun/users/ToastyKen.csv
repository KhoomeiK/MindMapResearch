comedynecromancy,ffscbif,t1_ffs1ufw,1580178313.0,Yup! https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Ornithopter
comedynecromancy,ffrjpao,t1_ffqt872,1580159410.0,"Every time we visit knowyourmeme, we're basically looking for an explanation of a joke. The fact that that site exists shows that this is a pretty common thing.

I think it's because another part of humor is that it forms ingroups. So when we hear a joke we don't get, we have a desire to understand it. Even if that doesn't make it funny that time, it means we'll be in on the joke next time!"
comedynecromancy,ffqprxa,t1_ffqkqon,1580140795.0,It mostly just means I read Dune. :p
comedynecromancy,ffq1voa,t1_ffq1mb9,1580115814.0,You'll start noticing it everywhere! It's both a blessing and a curse. :p
comedynecromancy,ffq1ud7,t1_ffq1mb9,1580115760.0,"Thanks. Typo.

(For the record I fixed it, but had ""van"" instead of ""von"".)"
todayilearned,ffq0qjr,t1_ffpzsud,1580114095.0,Yeah.... except... that's not how languages work. :p
todayilearned,ffq0pdi,t1_ffq0iki,1580114048.0,That sounds like a pretty powerful spell.
comedynecromancy,ffpzzkp,t1_ffph8l4,1580113020.0,Onion Boy sounds like it's a headline from the Weekly World News.
comedynecromancy,ffpzvuw,t1_ffph8l4,1580112876.0,"There's a rule of humor that the twist/punchline should be at the end. Now whenever I hear a joke where the punchline isn't at the end, I mentally rewrite it, and it almost always makes it better.

I think that's the case here. The punchline is the pun of applying antivirus software to a person. The aha moment is what makes it funny. When the ornithopter spoils the antivax connection from the start, the punchline at the end has less impact because it's more expected.

Humor is somewhat subjective, but I think that's why most people would prefer this version, even if a few prefer the ottovonbismarck."
celestegame,ffkpsrd,t1_ffjvnx2,1580026776.0,"Interestingly, this interpretation (that every death is just a premonition) is actually canon in the game Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, which is also about mental health."

Yeah I left out mention of what you can get with a decent antenna these days, but that is really gonna vary from place to place. (I have really crappy reception at my place for instance.)"

television,ff4sv9h,t1_ff4i70a,1579571637.0,"I don't think Hulu tends to sell seasons, but you'd have to buy them yes. I've found that buying the few shows I care about is still way cheaper than getting basic cable.

Also, to take The Sinner as an example, the first two seasons are on Netflix, so if you're catching up, old seasons are available for streaming. It's only the latest season you'd have to pay extra for."
television,ff4hzud,t1_ff48qz2,1579564078.0,"Good point, though since digital cable typcially isn't 4K, I adjusted the price to Standard HD for $13, as that seems like a reasonable comparison."
television,ff4hpyt,t1_ff47qmx,1579563891.0,"A lot of broadcast TV shows are also streamed on Hulu next day. As for basic cable shows or other broadcast shows, you can typically buy seasons on iTunes, Google Play, or Amazon, and new episodes also typically release next day."
