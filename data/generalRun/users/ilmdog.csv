Advice,ffdu82o,t3_et01eb,1579829048.0,I think you need to pick one place to live and develop community and then get a dog. You don’t need a bf or family of your own to be happy but you do need community / friends.

helpme,ff58l4r,t1_ff585mu,1579583455.0,"No problem!! It can be difficult to see sometimes but it is true! We all really do enjoy being part of a community.. it is important you branch out and don’t disconnect yourself from everybody because those negative things you’re believing about yourself are not true. They are self limiting very detrimental thoughts that are trying to take over your life and your emotions. You HAVE to reject those sad poor thoughts about yourself, they’re lies. Maybe it’s a spiritual attack.. but ultimately you need to seek out the truth which is very good news. God loves you above all others, no matter who comes and goes in your life, Jesus is the rock who can deliver you from these painful ways."
helpme,ff585p3,t1_ff57py2,1579583064.0,Also kindness goes a very long way. I’m not saying you are perfect for one another but you should follow your gut on these things. Maybe you’re not a match right now because your emotional needs are being neglected?
helpme,ff581at,t1_ff57py2,1579582956.0,"Think of someone who you appreciate but they aren’t someone who is famous or super talented, they’re just someone you love. Maybe it’s your friend or your grandma.. it may be someone you see everyday, but you appreciate them and they help you out too. Remember that you are that person to somebody too. You live in a community of mankind and we all support one another and help each other. You aren’t alone, you have needs and so do others. The people who love you also derive enjoyment from your company and support... even just your presence can be reassuring and appreciated. You need to realize you have intrinsic value."

I’m learning so much and enjoying the accuracy of losing weight as a science. No removing certain foods which have carbs for example and still okay to lose weight, it’s so exciting to me that it feels possible now without deep drastic sacrifice or killer workout regimes."
