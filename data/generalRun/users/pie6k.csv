Thanks for your feedback.

I want to add an option to select calendars pretty soon. I also think about options in calendar events list like 'convert events to tasks' where you can quickly select a few of them and have to-do's created. I also thought that if you do so and check some tasks, it'd modify your original event in the calendar, so it'll have check emoji added at the beginning of event's title. Do you think it'd be useful for you?

About the dates in the upcoming view, I've also noticed it. I'll investigate and try to fix it. (right now if you swipe a bit right/left where the dates are supposed to be they'll show up again)

And about habits. Well, it's a bug. There was some bug related to the scheduler that makes it break when the start and end of the week are in different years. I've already fixed it and waiting for review in the app store. The update should be there today or tomorrow.

After the update, you'll see scheduled habits in your list, in upcoming and in today (if it's scheduled for today).

Also, I'm planning to release the iPad and Mac version, but to be realistic - it'll happen probably in 2 to 4 months"

productivity,fcrkwnb,t1_fcrjpes,1577903153.0,Wow! Seems like the app icons is \*very\* similar to mine.
productivity,fcrfzb4,t1_fcrdtvw,1577901320.0,Wow! Thanks so much!
productivity,fcrd0r7,t1_fcrcpiq,1577900179.0,Thanks for feedback! TBH I was so burned out after coding it that it was really hard for me to motivate myself to create good promotion materials. I will for sure create some video for the app store soon :)
productivity,fcrcp45,t1_fcrcj5n,1577900056.0,ðŸŽ‰ let me know if you'll have any suggestions
productivity,fcrbpdb,t1_fcr9hh2,1577899651.0,Android version will be released pretty soon if I'll see people actually use it :)

I'd be really happy to talk with you a bit more about what you need and what kind of app would be great for you. Let me know if I can PM you. 

Also, if you'd have any feedback about the app, let me know ;)"
productivity,fcr9kuo,t3_ei2z0k,1577898755.0,"Hi,

I was using Things 3 for few years, and I've decided to create my own app

It's called  [Timpler](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/timpler-to-do-list-planner/id1432739728) and I've released it yesterday.

&#x200B;

What's different:

I really liked Things, but it was missing few things for me:

\- being able to see task suggestions for every day. I tend to create a lot of to-dos, add them to lists and never again check them. I wanted to avoid it

\- being able to create habits without fixed dates. eg. I want to focus more on reading, but I don't want to schedule it manually every time. Timpler has a system that tries to find the best day for your habits and adds it there as normal todo to your day. It checks how buys are you given day etc.

&#x200B;

It's iOS only for now. I'm excited about it and I really want to hear some feedback :)

[App Store Link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/timpler-to-do-list-planner/id1432739728)

Good luck!"

It supports both to-do's, has habits auto-scheduling feature and shows task suggestions for every day.

ps. I'm the author of this app :)"
