AmItheAsshole,ffetj12,t3_eszh6e,1579864829.0,"ESH - She sucks for being a liar and not planning ahead for the blatantly obvious, upcoming drug test; seriously, who couldn't have seen that one coming? You suck because rather than helping and supporting you went all ""I told you so"" and threw a tantrum; she knows she messed up, no need to rub salt in the wound. And the company sucks because they test for weed; seriously, does anyone still think that a bit of weed will cause poor job performance in this day and age?"

AmItheAsshole,febsnyy,t3_eo7iie,1578962237.0,"NTA - She tried to sell your dog behind your back??? Who the fuck does that? Pack her shit up, put it on the porch and post an ad selling her kid.


Seriously though, if she's willing to sell your dog behind your back, think about what else she'd be willing to do behind your back. Do you really trust her enough to live with her, knowing that she is capable of doing that? I'd put as much distance between me and her as possible."

metacanada,fe8p6ir,t1_fe57x51,1578928814.0,"1. It turns out that Pickering Nuclear had nothing to do with the alert, it was an error on the part of the Provincial Emergency Operations  Centre.


2. Helicopters are absolutely part of the nuclear emergency response teams training exercises at both Pickering and Darlington. I would guess that the same goes for the Bruce.

3. A temporary class 4 power loss isn't something that would normally be a newsworthy event. It didn't interrupt the supply to the grid.

4. Information about plant licensing and operations is available to the public through the regulatory body, the CNSC. You don't have to believe what the media, OPG or some random internet stranger tells you. You can go directly to them and ask for the info."
AmItheAsshole,fe7afyp,t3_enuzuk,1578912048.0,"NTA - She was going to force you to raise another mans child and pass it off as your own. For this she deserves a cash payout? Nope.

Applying a sticker to the glass generally requires cleaning it immediately before application; there isn't even a dirty rag close by, much less a bottle of cleaner."

I went in 1992 and was just getting on to newsgroups and using anonymous telnet to get to different sites around the world - all text based. in 94 I started using a funny little operating system called Linux on a 486 computer with 4MB of ram.
