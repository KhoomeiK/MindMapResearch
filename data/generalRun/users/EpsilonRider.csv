AskReddit,ffjg6g1,t1_ffiiw5v,1579997563.0,"> Express remorse 

I hate that part. Sometimes I know I *really* fucked up and I take personal time to deal with it. Sometimes I don't have the opportunity to immediately apologize in person, and it's hard to express remorse through text or a phone call. I feel gross sometimes because I feel like I have to think of a way for them to feel like they can ""see"" my remorse when I've had enough time to put myself together. It feels wrong because it feels like I have to emotionally manipulate them even though I know ""expressing remorse"" is important to them."

# FAQ

## What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

## Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a post to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.

## Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and commenting privileges in jeopardy.

## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me ~~a private message explaining what I got wrong~~. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right."

They'll often, in person anyways, point out what's it like in the struggle and that they're one of the realest people out there for going through it. Online though, they'll often use the phrase to shutdown a statistic or a study by putting their own anecdotal experience above it. People who do want to share their experience or help others understand the struggle won't say ""You don't/won't understand this or that."" They'll just up and say something like ""In my experience going through X..."" They'll only ever use that original phrase at the end when they begin to realize it may not be reaching them."

I can imagine it just like I can imagine how awful you'd have to be to murder you're ex or rob an old lady even given their circumstances. Just because I've never been homeless doesn't mean I don't understand how awful it is to be starving while publicly panhandling. Someone talking about their experiences will also help me understand. Especially when different people handle things differently.

It's a myth that you need to draw a line for chickens. You just need to flip them on their backs til they relax. It's also a myth that you need to rub their bellies or tickle them for sharks, alligators, and even chickens. It's theorized that being on their backs is such an unnatural position.

AskReddit,fdrxftn,t1_fdrhwu5,1578691218.0,"Common sense would be to simply give specific brands when someone asks what products you're referring to. Like reading the labels on the products you're using, something that doesn't require being a specialist. If you don't know since many complimentary products don't have the brand bolded. Most people would just say ""Oh I don't know, I just get all mine from the high end hotels I stay at"".  Your answer though honest, was uninformative and vague as to *what* products you use. Instead you provided the how and where you obtained said products. 

Also a bit still on point, many hotels (even high end hotels) don't actually provide that great of a hygiene product. They provide it for the most broad of people for obvious reasons. People can have a large spectrum of dry, oily, rough, or sensitive skin. Personally, most hotels provide me a harsh soap and a light lotion. That's even from getting the pleasure of once staying at a Four Seasons and once at a Ritz-Carlton which is where I discovered where the true levels of high-end hotels began lol. So the what products, and why they're better were important questions that were completely unanswered."

Then exhale your lungs and you should still be blowing the smoke out that was sitting in your lungs. As long as it was actually in your lungs, it'll enter your bloodstream.

AskReddit,fdpuj55,t1_fdpj6w9,1578641040.0,">They either invest, buyback stock (still an investment of sorts) or invest in other companies.

(Long wall of text so I wanna preface that I'm not an economist so don't take my shit as scholarly lol. Just bits of what I remember in college and the news I've kept up with.)

Idealistically yes, but realistically it's hard to tell what they'll really do. The *how* each company decides what to invest in is difficult to predict. They may begin to invest and grow their investments in a lot of other companies and ventures one year. Then a new executive or even a new company acquires them and they're headed in a totally different direction now. Or just an unexpected market turn happens and they have to reevaluate whether it's an investment worth keeping. 

Also, currently buybacks have been criticized particularly when their stocks don't appear to be undervalued. A move many claim benefits the executives such as when they sell stock soon after announcing a buyback program. I've also heard claims of it being a move to increase earnings per share so that executives can reach incentive compensations (although I doubt EPS is ever the sole metric for unlocking bonuses.). 

The other forms of investments aren't so heavily criticized because they're more direct assets for the growth of the company. Buybacks are criticized because they use the extra free cash flow for the effects of a buyback, regardless of reasons, instead of investing in their bottom employees such as raising their wages or benefits. However it could be argued that they could always raise their bottom employees' wages instead of doing X with their profits. It's just that buybacks have recently been seen to be used for short-term goals and directly benefit executives rather than the company as a whole."
AskReddit,fdpinpi,t1_fdpdf06,1578629655.0,"We're basically saying as long as everyone does what they're supposed to do, then things will be fine. Companies arguably have more power in this situation though since they're the ones that have to pass *on* the benefits. Realistically, it's hard to predict what any company will do in their respective industry since they all generally respond to what the market can bear.

Wages generally do increase but it increases from the top down slowly. People making minimum wage or close to minimum wage generally won't be making anymore than they already were. There isn't really a short supply of them. A ""bottom up"" growth, like raising minimum wage to a whopping $15/hr kinda has it in reverse with its own set of risks. Non-minimum wage jobs would adjust their pay accordingly. More people would have more money to spend into the economy as well as potentially afford more housing. It's affects on how much businesses of every industry will bear is, idk personally pretty wild and unpredictable."
AskReddit,fdpd3e1,t1_fdpa8f8,1578625584.0,"I think a lot of people are frustrated because that type lf trickle-down-effect requires relying on companies on reinvesting those profits. They could easily get scared and just hold on to those profits to ride out a  potential downturn. They could also decide for whatever reason not to reinvest for a period. It's their profits, they can really do what they want. Also more jobs and more growth doesn't necessarily equate to higher wages. So people living paycheck to paycheck will continue to live in very similar situations regardless if their upper echelon are benefiting from higher profits. I do agree focusing on the people living paycheck to paycheck isn't indicative of a strong economy."

It's a bit mixed but the few articles I've read it does seem to point at an isolationist policy aimed at slowing China's growth. If the Trump administration wanted China to stop Chinese companies from trying to take intellectual property. They should've outlined their demands and implemented policies aimed at any previous and potential future companies stealing American tech. If they wanted a more fair trade agreement, they should've brought them to the negotiating table. If I remember right, what seems to have happened was that the Trump administration right off the bat threatened tariffs, and immediately implemented them. That, to me at least, seems like trade wasn't necessarily the priority."
