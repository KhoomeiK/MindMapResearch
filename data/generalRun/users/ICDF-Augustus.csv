pussypassdenied,fgg1rnq,t1_fgg0amb,1580752365.0,"Maybe beating white kids would reduce civil violence.  But it CERTAINLY hasn’t worked for black kids.

Seems like it’s the message behind the beatings, that shapes kids.

Stereotypically, a ghetto black youth who grows into a thug was probably beaten as a child.

Also, stereotypically, an Asian kid who grows into a maestro piano player, or an engineer was probably beaten as a kid.

The difference?  Asian parents stereotypically think that their kids need to excel in certain things (like music and science), while ghetto Black parents stereotypically think their kids need to excel at dominance, and manipulation."
