depression,ffj0q1w,t3_etkvgj,1579987462.0,"yeah, it hurts.  whether your nose if ugly or not it hurts.  looking at the truth can hurt and now u get to take into account the opinion of your friend. it may or may not be true even though it is his opinion.  u said it hurts being the one person no one likes but does NO one like u? does your friend like u even though there are things about u he doesn't like?  I don't like a lot of things about my best friend but I like HER (her being, her soul) anyway and love her.  it's okay u cant take it better because it hurts to hear, but u can get better and stronger; I know because I read it's possible and because little by little I get stronger and able to bear uncomfortable information and evaluate its significance to me.  u can message me if u want to talk further or would like a support buddy.......all the best"
