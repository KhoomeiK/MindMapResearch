mazda6,fgrjjz5,t3_f041ib,1581048437.0,"It means your engine is out of time. Considering your oil light is coming on it’s experiencing low oil pressure. The lack of oil pressure has resulted in your timing being effected (your timing chain is tensioned using your oil pressure, your variable valve actuator is oil pressure controlled, etc etc)

Let the dealer look at it but if you want you can check your oil level beforehand, if it’s low fill it to level and clear code and see if the code comes back. If it comes back the lack of pressure was enough to cause damage internally. If the light stays off you caught it early. If your oil level is already full there’s nothing else you can really do except bring it in.

Considering you’re hearing knocking already though there’s likely already damage present.

Then you just need to find out why it lost oil pressure.

Also it could be something else failed causing your oil pressure loss (or your timing going out), not just the level or condition of your oil, I’m just describing the basics of the code."

As a rule the microwave just needs to list it’s max wattage for safety issues as far as power pull on circuits etc.

The instructions on our microwaveable stuff then give directions based on a standard rating (say 1200 watts) and based on your microwave you adjust the directions as needed.
