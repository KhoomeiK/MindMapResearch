tattoo,ffofir9,t1_ffmdbol,1580077162.0,It’s so interesting hearing difference in pain tolerance - shoulder is by far the least painful place I’ve been tattooed and thought it was worse closer to my neck! I found my shoulder very easy to sit through
chicago,ffg32d0,t1_ffg2bbi,1579897392.0,"That makes sense. I was curious since it’s address based and related to parking enforcement as well. I wonder how they city tracks those things

edit: I definitely think this is useful and will try it out come April!"
chicago,ffg16qg,t3_ete5ei,1579896230.0,"Is there a possibility that this would also be able to track the one-off parking restrictions or out of schedule cleanings? Eg, closures for construction or schedule changes around holidays posted on the white signs tied to trees"
CrossStitch,ffeg2pp,t1_ffdzte2,1579846639.0,"I use a soluble pen to mark the center of fabric. Sometimes i use a ruler but usually i will just cold it and eyeball the middle. While working, most (all?) people move the fabric around in the hoop as you go so the section you’re working on is easiest to see and get to. This post is a finished for display so she’s centered it up, but I never worry about centering while I’m working."

Healthyhooha,ffcalcc,t1_ffca480,1579795285.0,I referred to your question about progesterone
myfavoritemurder,ffc5z8s,t3_es4nwn,1579792321.0,"I do the same aimless driving sometimes, particularly now that I have a hybrid and don’t feel too guilty about burning up gas. The Dollop is great for amusing background noise or focused listening, and they’re friends with Karen and Georgia. Patton Oswald was recently on their 400 episode about Ronald Reagan which was amazing. The /r/thedollop has a lot of posts about people’s favorite episodes. They cover some true crime, but all stories are about American history and include some amazing little-known stories/characters."
Healthyhooha,ffc4567,t1_ffc2cfq,1579791079.0,"If you think your hormone levels are off a doctor can run tests and give you advice or prescribe hormonal birth control to regulate your period. It’s not a good idea to self-diagnose; as another commenter mentioned it’s possible to have too much tension that’s exacerbated by kegels, which a pelvic floor specialist can diagnose"
Healthyhooha,ffc1ltc,t1_ffbwxns,1579789236.0,"I don’t see how a hormonal change would result in a different feel of muscles and tissue. I agree with others that a pelvic floor PT is the right way to go to figure out if there is a medical issue/solution 

It also sounds like you’re feeling your partner is withdrawing from sex because of this. Hopefully you’re able to talk to him about it and understand if he has any concerns to figure out how you can both be satisfied"
Healthyhooha,ffbj12p,t1_ffarhwr,1579767583.0,"PSA: It definitely  ***is*** possible to get a false negative. *I don’t think that’s the case here*, but a person may take a pregnancy test at some point between sex and HCG being detectable. 

I agree that waiting until a week after expected start of her period is the best path for OP."
Healthyhooha,ffbi0by,t3_esnqyi,1579766201.0,"I’d think that as long as they’ve been kept dry they should be fine. Hygiene products aren’t sterile and don’t expire. My family with 3 sisters always had a FHP drawer and I’m certain we used things over a year or two old occasionally, but 10 years seems less certain that no dampness has ever gotten in. Maybe advise them to check that anything looks discolored or wrinkled (like paper that gets wet and dries) gets tossed straightaway, along with the whole box."
