Educate yourself as much as possible as to the link between gut health and vaginal health, you could for example have a food intolerance or allergy that is messing up your stomach culture which in turn is upsetting the very fine balance in your vagina.

There are lots of causes of thrush, you may be ingesting too much sugar, you may need to change the type of underwear you use, you may need to sleep without undies! For some women the pill throws them out of balance, too much dairy can cause issues for others, your tampons or pads may have something in them that your body doesn’t like, you may be douching which isn’t necessary. So many reasons and even more. I used to get it regularly after having kids but had never had it prior; hormones cause all sorts of changes and your cycle is still settling. 
Again, don’t feel bad, you won’t be judged poorly if you go back to the doctor.

Its not a spectator sport and it shouldn’t even be considered a given by anyone else that their presence is permitted.

Your husband was completely and utterly out of line and that he was kicked out is 110% is own stupid fault. Make this very, very clear to him and that you will never again tolerate such disloyalty from him. I know you’re probably exhausted and emotional this early in, but stand firm in this.

AmItheAsshole,feol1jc,t3_eq2sz1,1579301608.0,"Seems to me that Jessica perfectly understands her older sister’s boundaries and so tries not to ever ask her for help. 

Occasionally helping out isn’t going to become an obligation as long as everyone remembers the rules, it’s just what you do when you live or work together. I’m certain that if Jenny were stranded somewhere because of a broken down car or similar, Jessica would probably help collect her, or do you think she would say “No, not my car, not my problem - you have feet, work it out” to her sister? All Jenny had to say with the pick up request was “I’ll do it, but please don’t make it a habit.”

Whether Jenny pays anything towards living costs or not is not the issue, her mother is supporting her just like Jessica is supporting her own daughter.

Even if a Jenny doesn’t like or want children herself, even if she didn’t make the mistake of getting pregnant in her teens and doesn’t condone the choice, even if she’s a student and has studies to focus on, even if as a woman it shouldn’t be expected that her ovaries make her automatically maternal and therefore it’s taken for granted that she wants to be involved in child care, the 3 year old is still a human being who needs to be treated with respect and dignity, not ignored and left hungry, that’s just nasty. I always treated my kids like little adults, they’ve grown up to be pretty level headed, responsible people and it’s likely the child already knows not to bother the aunt unless there’s no option. 

I think OP was perfectly right to tell Jenny she was being TA, because apparently she doesn’t know how to be an adult. She’s sharing a family home and unfortunately is occasionally going to have to interact with smaller family members; she can treat it as an opportunity to practice working with people she doesn’t like but still have to be polite and respectful with.

We had a lady guest check in a couple of days ago and her over the top friendliness and excitement to be staying in what is essentially a three star hotel had me turning to my co-worker with raised eyebrows as she walked away and the moment the lift doors closed behind her we both suggested she would be making money on the side during her stay. We’ll see how things pan out because even though she had a credit card and ID, I just have that feeling things are going to go pear shaped."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fdith49,t1_fdgu2pq,1578450669.0,I read that they ordered it but does that mean they actually paid for it? They may have lied and put it on a room; wouldn’t be the first time staff have opened a tab for in-house guests but then discovered later when they went to transfer the account over that no one was in that room number - drives me crazy when staff where I work don’t follow proper procedure.
AmItheAsshole,fdis9ks,t3_eld14g,1578449903.0,"Oh this gets my goat, NTA and for the love of God if your dog isn’t socialised don’t take it to an area where dogs are allowed to socialise. Frustrates me no end the number of times I’ve been told this by other dog owners; so, what...I’m supposed to take a ticket and wait my turn? 

I get that their dog needs exercise but if that’s the case, they need to up their ownership and purchase the necessary muzzles and extra training required to allow their dog to exist in public. It’s not fair that their dog can’t have the normal freedoms, no, but I also shouldn’t have to be scared that my dog is going to be attacked over and over again due to owners not accepting the limitations they have with their dog and being a responsible dog owner.

My placid, sweet natured female Doberman has now been viciously attacked at least three times while out walking in public or at dog parks, the last time was the worst and her throat was punctured. She’s fine now but I purchased the widest leather collar with spikes on it that I could, and she now wears it all the time, but I could have lost her any of these times. It’s a testimony to her excellent nature that none of these occasions have damaged her personality and she’s still as sweet, gentle and playful with all puppies and dogs."
