I’m so sorry that’s how you found out. I wish there was a reliable way to warn future women about guys like this."
domesticviolence,ffbgrrw,t3_esobo7,1579764598.0,"Hi there, it’s normal to feel this way. You are not crazy. Give the domestic violence hotline a call so you can talk with someone qualified.
Those feelings will go away. You miss him because you love him. Love is not rational so your love doesn’t realise his abuse the same way your conscious mind does. It’s okay to feel the way you feel, no judgement. It gets better with time and therapy. Hang in there."

CPTSD,fem5zoo,t1_felq90g,1579240964.0,"Yes can also attest to this: reparenting yourself gets easier over time. It doesn’t feel so ridiculous as it did in the beginning.

AlAnon,fem5sqb,t3_epusgn,1579240767.0,"For me it was because it felt like his lack of effort was a testament to how little he actually cared about me and that fucking hurt.

It also brings up memories of playing for people I loved that ended up hurting me. Idk a lot of complex weirdness involving my guitar. I haven’t played in a least six months and even just looking at in my room feels like I’m looking at a case full of shitty feelings that’s just waiting for me to open it up.

AlAnon,fekndfh,t1_feka593,1579203649.0,Thank you. That is well put and good for you for putting yourself first.  I'm still working on accepting the guilt I feel for making myself a priority. It's nice to hear that there's hope/it gets better.
AdultChildren,fekao9z,t3_eplbca,1579196095.0,"Hey I feel kind of similar sometimes. Like deep down I want to be the person that says yes when someone asks to hang out or joins in conversations at work. I think what keeps me from doing that is, ultimately, fear of rejection/judgement/feeling like an outsider. I would surmise that this improves as I work the steps and come to understand why these fears have such power over me. I’ve realised how much better I feel after social interaction so I’ve been trying to make that a priority even though it’s uncomfortable. I’m sorry you’re going through this!"
AlAnon,fek94pr,t1_fejg656,1579195187.0,"I think most do, or at least use alcohol to cover up feelings from past traumas/anxiety/depression etc. I’m happy you’re out of yours!

Someone on reddit recommended the book Self Compassion by Kristin Neff and it has helped me a lot navigating these post relationship complexities."
AlAnon,fej4gzd,t1_fej1khz,1579156553.0,"That resonates with me.  Especially feeling the sense of responsibility over their safety if the relationship were to end.  I still love my Q deeply, but his addiction to alcohol made that love more complicated and the relationship volatile.  I actually feel fairly confident saying I would not have left him if he hadn't gotten physically violent with me (that made the choice easy).  But having had the space and time to look back on our relationship, I've been having a what the fuck were you putting yourself through moment.  I was the person clinging to all the positive he got sober stories, while my Q was showing me with his actions that was not his future.  I'm sorry you're going through this."
AlAnon,fej441a,t1_feim8lo,1579156165.0,"Interesting perspective, and one that I think really gets to the core of Alanon's principles.  Thank you for sharing.  My hope for myself is to get to a place where I'm no longer attracted to alcoholics/addicts/hot-messes because that attraction in turn makes me miserable. Or at least that's what it feels like!"
AlAnon,fej3z2h,t1_feigms7,1579156019.0,"Yes, you put it into words perfectly! My Q/exbf is in jail for domestic violence against me.  It sucks to say, but if he hadn't gotten physically violent I would've stayed and kept enduring the emotional abuse.  Being in love made me also in love with the man I believed he could be.  Plus he would always feed me some bullshit about how you can't appreciate the good times (ahead) if you don't know bad. I hoped so hard that he was ""the one"" because I wanted him to be. Even now that it's over and he's going to prison, I still have love for him and idealize the relationship.  Then I look in my journal from those days and see that I wasn't happy most days I journaled.  People that are good at manipulating you are so good, that you end up questioning whether you are the manipulator.

&#x200B;

I'm so sorry you had to go through that.  It does feel validating that someone else feels the same.  I was starting to feel guilty for being so judgmental.  I know everyone's situation is different, but after seeing the truth of my reality I can't help but feel like romantic relationships with alcoholics are not worth it."
AlAnon,fej3jl5,t1_fei6re1,1579155559.0,Great perspective! I think it stems from my desire to rescue others--wishing I could save them from the pain of getting to a place separation is the only option.  Thank you!
AlAnon,fej3ecr,t1_feib1st,1579155402.0,Thank you for such a thoughtful response.  That part about hope really resonated with me. I forgot how much I love/hate hope--I seem to have a mostly endless supply when I'm in love so that's very relatable.  Thank you for reminding me to take some time for myself if I'm feeling like I can't hold space for others.

selfimprovement,feewce5,t1_feerd99,1579042624.0,"Yo you are cute and I would say I have very typical taste. So I won't be accepting anymore of these ""ugly"" excuses.  After seeing your photo, I have no doubt that when you can get through these social anxiety issues, having successful dates/meeting potential partners won't be an issue.  Honestly, I was expecting you to be ugly and you're far from it."
selfimprovement,feeqd2s,t1_feectri,1579038985.0,"No offense taken.  And I'm not here to tell you everything is going to be sunshine and rainbows and you'll have sex all the time.   Nor am I going to tell you that sex is overrated and not worth the hype (my opinion), because it's clearly very important to you and I'm not going to invalidate your priorities. What I can tell you with absolute certainty is being attractive really only gets you as far as first impressions.  Personally, someone's personality, sense of humor, intelligence, and hobbies are what makes someone attractive. 

To get real: maybe you are hideously ugly and look like an ogre.  That sucks a lot because your appearance is out of your control for the most part. But there's probably an equally ogre-like-faced girl out there for you that will be stoked to have you as their partner.  Focus on the parts of yourself that you can change.  Idk dude I'm also just trying to make it in this weird, shitty, materialistic world trying to find happiness for myself. All I can say is your appearance does not have anything to do with your worth."
selfimprovement,feebmf5,t1_feeazfh,1579030414.0,"Those are all valid reasons to be concerned. Try not thinking so far into the future. It just takes one gregarious girl to ask you out, and trust me they exist. Focus on yourself. People are attracted to people that have a positive sense of self and that will come with introspection and work. 

Side point: I’m a 25f and you’re doing just fine talking to me! I used to be pretty socially awkward until I developed my sense of self. College is a weird time where everyone is kind of trying to figure out who they are. That can be really fun or really scary. I’m sorry it’s been the latter."
selfimprovement,fee9yq1,t1_fee9ojd,1579029444.0,"Why do you think you never will?

There’s a well supported theory that anxiety can stem from lack of self compassion—feeling like you’re just waiting around for the next bad thing to happen because you deserve it. I would guess that once you can feel more at peace with yourself some of that social anxiety may dissipate."
selfimprovement,fee7qmf,t1_fee6wk1,1579028133.0,"Sweet! Rock climbing is great! Any physical exercise is good because it can use up some extra adrenaline (mediates anxiety).  
I can imagine how thinking about being a virgin at old age feels embarrassing and terrifying.  Developing some tools of self compassion will help manifest feelings of confidence and happiness.  Try not to make your happiness contingent on your virginity status."
selfimprovement,fee6o9i,t1_fee65oo,1579027508.0,"Well it might do something and it might not, but you won’t know until you try.  Sometimes you just have to force yourself to do things during depression. Do I want to stay in bed all day and do nothing so I can punish myself later for being unproductive? Yes. But instead I force myself to do something. I usually don’t enjoy it, but I just keep telling myself that it will get better. 

Believing that nothing will help is your first obstacle. SOMETHING will help, you just have to find it and believe in it. Even if you’re faking the belief at first, choose something."

I was soooo fucking angry and felt like my freedom to choose was still being taken away from me. It took me a couple weeks to realise and be honest with myself: I would not have made that report on my own. That first call felt like too much responsibility, but once the cops called me and asked questions I had to confront reality. Now I am grateful that my dad took the weight of that decision off me. Yes it would have been empowering and great if I had made it on my own—but I wouldn’t have.

That being said, I raised a guide dog puppy for my first year of school and let me tell you it was a great way to go. I got all the benefits of dog ownership without the fiscal responsibility. I had a support group of other puppy raisers—people I could ask for advice or who could watch my puppy if I just needed a break (they understood).  Being affiliated with Guide Dogs for the Blind also meant I could take my puppy with me to class and made finding pet friendly housing much easier.

The bottom line is: we are not sure of the mechanism between grain free diets and DCM. There is a correlation between low taurine levels and DCM, but as we know correlation does not equal causation.  That being said, I think the switch to Purina pro plan is a good choice. However, given the age of your pup and lack of symptoms (I’m assuming this because you didn’t mention it) I wouldn’t rush into diagnostics unless money is of no concern.  There are lot of veterinarians looking into this phenomenon so hopefully we will get answers soon.  I’ve seen some really good comments on this with good sources.
