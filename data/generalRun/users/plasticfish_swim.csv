IdiotsInCars,ff5qw75,t1_ff4wgwb,1579606648.0,"Dont believe everything you read on the news.  There is no way this jeep caused this and didnt itself also become destroyed.  The jeep stopped but unfortunately not quick enough to avoid tapping a crash that already happened.  

Been to a lot of crashes and that would be more in line with what happened here."
IdiotsInCars,ff5qifj,t3_ermgbz,1579606147.0,"Been to may crashes.  The picture and ""news"" story doesnt match what we can see.

That red car could have plowed into the bus (possibly texting and driving) and subsequently the jeep also hit the red car and bus (possibly also texting and driving) but a significantly less speed.  Significantly less speed since it seems next to no encroachment into at least the engine compartment. 

Nope.  If you hit a car so hard as to ram it into the busses ass (and no doubt it lifts the bus!) Your jeep is totally destroyed too."

Paramedics,ff257dm,t3_er6c7x,1579494133.0,"I hear ya bro.  Also pees me off when those ""advocating"" for their patient push to keep them on their stretcher during peak busy times when clearly these patients can go to a waiting room and wait with the other CTAS 4s and 5s.   These offload delays are super problematic.  

Embarrsingly lazy."

""The government has no place to presume consent and that people should choose for themselves"".  

So if found unconscious the government can presume consent and that this person wants medical help to stay alive. Unless like with most countries you have opt-out with a signed ""do not resuscitate"".  

Seems good for one situation but highly unethical for another.  Where is that line drawn?"
Sudbury,fehvbq0,t3_ep5xb3,1579124590.0,I've been twice to LTB and both times were quick  Ie less than a month.  Been a couple of years since last time.  Times have changed I guess.
funny,fegku54,t3_eovmiy,1579095886.0,Eats like a horse.
Paramedics,fegk1w1,t3_eos283,1579095128.0,"First step is to agree on an official definition of community paramedic as not all are doing the same job.  

Some community paramedics are fully integrated into the hospital ER, diagnostics, palliative pain control,  etc etc., performing complex labs in home and with access to patient chart allowing them to interact with members of all the teams the patient is involved with in their care.  They receive additional intendive training initially over and above being advanced care paramedics and continue with CME yearly.  Clearly a beneficial valuable service reducing ER congestion and bed use.  Bang for buck for sure.   A step up from ACP

Some community paramedics simply do just cursory assessments blood pressure, spo2.  Not sure exactly what would be the point.  Can be filled by light duty medics.  A step down from PCP. 

Of course there is everything in between.  I suppose lower skilled community paramedics could do ecg and glucose but again, to what end since none of this is formally included within a patient master chart to effect a doc intervention.  So really kind of a waste of money."

PoliticalHumor,fegb9nh,t1_feflrum,1579086006.0,"Well first you can apologize.  You can call your elected officials and make your opinion known and help elect a true leader.

PoliticalHumor,fegb00o,t1_fefvcjw,1579085639.0,"Nah.   What Trump did was provoke. The provoking wasn't necessary to protect you.

AskReddit,fee4upp,t1_fedck0n,1579026428.0,"You know something, Canada generally speaking like Americans but this month unfortunately, your ass of a President is indirectly responsible for the death of 63 of my fellow citizens!  And it's not necessarily him I'm pissed off with because he is way to narcissistic to accept responsibility.   It's the American elected and the voters I'm extremely disappointed with this month.  I hope to hell you contact your elected rep and blast the hell out of them for what sickhead did yo us your loyal and friendly neihhbours."
PoliticalHumor,fee0rx7,t3_eoktxs,1579023994.0,"Yes and because of his narcissism and will to distract from his problems 63 Canadians died when their plane and 107 others on board was shot down!

When I say ""scientific data"" I am only ever referring to that data which has used universally accepted testing methods which is complete with a hypothesis, data charts, results, a conclusion, written down, evaluated etc.  

What I am absolutely not referring too as ""scientific data"" is subjective statements from people at a coffee shop or sidewalk, assumptions, ads on TV or You Tube, limited past experiences, coincidences etc."

WTF,fcf7dq1,t1_fcec92x,1577627290.0,"I would think your ""chiro"" is not a registered physio therapist.  

I think most people who are sent to a chiropractor are those where the medical doctor is fed up with trying to appease the patient who refuses to follow doctor's prescribed treatments.  These same patients are hopefully never returning to the doctor's busy practice."

educationalgifs,fc96v0k,t1_fc8zyv7,1577547968.0,"Good response.  

I suppose the elephant in the room (there are a few) is the very high cost to society with this service.  If no interior attack then no danger.  No danger means less expensive fire departments.  

Fire departments take up 30-50% of budgets.  Those firefighters get paid really really well for someone  who can do the job with high school education and in house training.  Fires are decreasing ten fold yearly.  If we could cut that service in half then my property taxes could be either dropped or frozen for many many years."
educationalgifs,fc8hgck,t3_egem46,1577534987.0,"Ok cant get this out of my mind.  Not a firefighter here but why do we need to risk firefighter lives for this?  Am I wrong but if this is happening to your home are the occupants not dead?  This method of extinguishing a fire seems primitive.  

I would think great engineering minds by now would have come up with more advanced systems to extinguish fires.  I think of things like a remote system where one individual can mechanically introduce a high pressure, high volume spear like device through walls to cool down a room and apply water.  Seems simple enough."
