IPhoneApps,ffdvleg,t3_et0rxg,1579830018.0,Not sure you can do both things right at the same time. I created ZenJournal and I consider it the simplest and best way to journal. You can also use hashtags while you journal to track your habits. I also would recommend this very elegant habit tracking app called Avocation.
AskReddit,fd9xirx,t3_eke3zp,1578239174.0,OneNote. If not asking for syncing. ZenJournal on Android. Also try private Twitter account or slack channel or telegram group.
selfimprovement,fd55rnf,t3_ek1osu,1578174459.0,"I created ZenJournal for this. Note-taking apps could be too generic to be productive for journaling. With that said, you may also try a private twitter account, slack channel or telegram group."
apple,fcxhqqq,t1_fcxhk30,1578063229.0,You are absolutely correct! More font options will also be provided.
apple,fcxam72,t1_fcxafut,1578057497.0,Thanks for the feedback. More customization will be coming.
minimalism,fcwh5xr,t1_fcwa4ld,1578025509.0,"Thank you! Although I launched yesterday on ProductHunt and failed spectacularly (only 9 PH referrals üòÇ), but feedback like this fuels me. Cheers to you and new habits!"
apple,fcvot87,t1_fcugow1,1578006736.0,The font size is about the same as twitter. Also it does support dynamic font size from iOS so it adjust with system font size. Currently at 15 point and 22 line height. Let me know if that‚Äôs still too small for you. üôè
minimalism,fcvnwcj,t1_fcvkaym,1578006161.0,Awesome. Hope you like it! üôè
minimalism,fcu54nd,t1_fctkfrr,1577972782.0,That‚Äôs priceless feedback! üôè Makes me so very happy knowing this is doing exactly what I intended: to provide a stress-free journaling experience. I have a list of small updates from feedback here. Don‚Äôt hesitate to let me know if there are ways to improve it. My only wish is more people get to try it. This is a niche category with way too much noise and bloat...
minimalism,fctcpc8,t1_fctcckl,1577939143.0,Yes. That‚Äôs a known bug. Will probably be fixed with the next update. Or the one after. Thanks for noticing that means more than a few people do write longer logs.
minimalism,fctcl1c,t1_fctbwh1,1577939041.0,Yes. Features sometimes distract the core experience. I‚Äôll only add features that help enhance the core. :)
minimalism,fctavob,t1_fctamie,1577937610.0,"That makes sense. That feature sounds reasonable. 

Yes. The missing editing feature was half to limit the feature scope half because I thought paper journals don‚Äôt allow you to edit. But I‚Äôve seen enough requests that I‚Äôm probably going to add it at some point. You can copy by long press a log and click share, then the share sheet will have a copy option. Hope that helps."
minimalism,fctabuv,t1_fct5309,1577937161.0,Thank you for the shoutout. Hope it will help you as it helped me the last year and half.
minimalism,fcta8s5,t1_fcta0dk,1577937091.0,That‚Äôs really weird. Did you forget to tap the add button to save the log? Were you writing a really long log? I‚Äôd encourage micro logs and more frequent saves. The app is probably killed in the background with the log gone if you didn‚Äôt save. Sorry about that... maybe I should add a feature to save the currently editing log.
minimalism,fcsiu9e,t1_fcq2849,1577917335.0,Sorry. Which link is not working?
minimalism,fcox429,t1_fcowjr8,1577843975.0,Good to hear! Yes PM is open.
minimalism,fcohend,t1_fcogtw5,1577832286.0,Thanks for the ‚ù§Ô∏è. Will keep iterate on this. Please help spread the word!
minimalism,fcogha6,t1_fcof1pd,1577831651.0,"Exactly, it makes sense for a note-taking app. Not so much for a journaling app where nothing should distract you from your thoughts flowing."
minimalism,fcoal4o,t1_fcoaarw,1577827559.0,üôè thanks.
minimalism,fco0khv,t1_fcnywbj,1577821917.0,"The first item is definitely a bug. It scrolls but the problem is it pushed the input way down behind the keyboard. 

Edit is one of the missing pieces for sure. Glad you found the long-way walk-around. My original reason was paper journal doesn‚Äôt allow you to edit. But now I‚Äôve seen enough requests that I‚Äôm going to implement it at some point. 

Thanks for the readability comment. I‚Äôll adjust it more and maybe even open it up to customize at some point. Empty line as separator is definitely a recommended pattern too if you don‚Äôt want to wait for five minutes for an auto-timestamp separation."
minimalism,fcnvxt2,t1_fcnvk6r,1577819511.0,"True. That‚Äôs why I think data portability is very important for such apps. ZenJournal is very portable because you can export it as a JSON file which is just a list of entries with the log and timestamp, then edit, merge, encrypt it as you want."
minimalism,fcnv0e0,t1_fcnuf4y,1577818968.0,üòáthank you for giving it a try! It currently does not have as many text formatting options as Agenda but I‚Äôve found pure text can do a lot.
minimalism,fcns78j,t1_fcnr8an,1577817414.0,"To use one point of data: I‚Äôve used this app consistently for a year and half. The biggest gap is only about three weeks, while previously i‚Äôve never stuck with any other apps for more than 3 days. When you make the effort atomically small, you are more likely to stick with the habit. 

I use it to log random thoughts exactly as you described. Hope this one lasts for you too."
getdisciplined,fcndckj,t3_ei264k,1577809304.0,"I do! Not sure i used it for self-improvement per se but it did clear my mental clutter fairly well. 

I just dump these private thoughts, ideas, todos and reflections into this app that I created called ZenJournal*.

I think it‚Äôs pretty important to have such an outlet. Every time I saw #deleteTwitter or #deleteFacebook trending, I remind myself it‚Äôs not the sin of social networks where our context-heavy content are publicly displayed, permanently searchable, and carefully curated, but our responsibility to strike the balance. 

*https://thezenjournal.com is the fastest and easiest way to log, search, hide, and read your journal, free for iOS and android."
TestFlight,fcgo62d,t3_edjdqt,1577642315.0,"Thank you everyone for your input. I've got some valuable feedback thanks to you. Special shoutout to u/splashyfame for the most extensive bug reports and ideas! üôè

The app is now released but I'll keep pushing builds into the same test group so keep your feedback coming."
IWantToLearn,fcg782l,t1_fcg6eh8,1577637101.0,"Yes. To most people. Unless you just enjoy the practice of coding itself, which is part of it. But it will be much more motivating if you are at the same time solving a real world problem. Even a small pain or practice problem like I created a journal app and so many todo lists app are created this way."
apple,fcg082i,t1_fcfz754,1577635318.0,"This is the first time I‚Äôve received such request. There is a walk-around to export and modify the exported text JSON file, and restore again. I‚Äôve also thought about providing an easy way to import all your tweets."
IWantToLearn,fcfz31j,t3_eh5w1q,1577635060.0,"Don‚Äôt worry about math. Unless you are doing some specific tasks of programming like framework development or low level graphics work you don‚Äôt need math at all to build a reddit prototype or twitter mobile app for example. I‚Äôd also recommend picking a language that will be useful for a project that you want to build. Like don‚Äôt just studying java or c++ because you think that‚Äôs coding. Try to have a project in mind, and then try to learn technologies that could be used for that project."
apple,fcfr13v,t1_fcd2q90,1577632877.0,Thanks for the shoutout. Please consider leaving a review to spread the word. üôè
apple,fcfqqqz,t1_fcdqaoy,1577632802.0,That‚Äôs a good suggestion. Maybe turn discreet mode on app launch if lock mode is turned on. Thank you!
apple,fcc4bal,t1_fcc3lc3,1577594255.0,Thank you so much! Take your time.
apple,fcbi2tx,t1_fcbhlef,1577587130.0,Thanks for the suggestion about the grammar! Not native speaker so I bet there are ways to improve. Would you be willing to help and DM me about the sentences that‚Äôs hard to read? üôè
getdisciplined,fcaqbw2,t1_fc9urbh,1577574480.0,Which device are you on? Is there a chance you can record your session and send me a video via DM? üôè
apple,fcahiy4,t1_fcafiaz,1577569350.0,Thank you for the kind words!
apple,fcahga4,t1_fcacye1,1577569316.0,Yes iCloud is on the list because it's security is pretty good with it's tenent system.
apple,fcah9dy,t1_fcafx0i,1577569220.0,"Yes. This app is intentionally offline with no data leaving your device. I also have plans to add on device at rest encryption, but currently as long as your device is locked no one can connect and see your logs."
apple,fca84lg,t1_fca7siz,1577564501.0,Thanks for the shout-out.
getdisciplined,fc9cngd,t1_fc9cbe9,1577550591.0,I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you. You don‚Äôt have to save as soon as you add it will automatically save. I‚Äôve never seen that happen to be honest. Are you on android or iOS?
getdisciplined,fc9405u,t3_egozb5,1577546667.0,"Thanks for sharing! Your experience resonates very well with James Clear‚Äôs Atomic Habits: https://jamesclear.com/small-habits

I created a free micro journal app that tries to make journaling as close to pen and pencil logs as possible by reducing friction and distraction. People here might find it useful: https://thezenjournal.com"
simpleliving,fbz3fil,t1_fbz280o,1577233901.0,"Thank you! üòÉ Yes I've tried that and a dozen other apps. Feature bloat is definitely a common symptom among this category.  Why make journaling so stressful? Other common triggers: notifications, weird questions, always need a title..."
