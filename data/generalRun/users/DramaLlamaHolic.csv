politics,ffduflj,t1_ffd6hk1,1579829196.0,"I work for a poli sci department and this made my heart sing. 

The thing is everyone makes a joke about “useless” poli sci degrees, but they don’t see our students. 

Our. Students. Kick. Ass. 

They are the best part of my job and every single day they are the pick-me-up when I’m feeling overwhelmed by how goddamned depressing everything is. 

They do it with their community involvement, their commitment to what is good and right and true, their commitment to understanding those with different perspectives and finding a way to work together with their opposition for the common good. 

Our students give me hope because of what they do everyday and what they go on to do. They. Do. The. Coolest. Stuff. Off the top of my head - there’s one who created an micro loan organization that funds women in different countries in Africa. Another student examines issues of hunger and homelessness and has conducted research that’s being used to remedy some shitty past legislation. A group of our students traveled internationally to participate on a panel at a renowned conference and advocate for indigenous people. 

There’s so many more examples. So many, you guys. 

They amaze me all the more for their drive to be a part of our department. Our institution is a state school and we aren’t exactly rolling in the big bucks. Although I wish we had more money to fund them - scholarships, grants, whatever... it doesn’t always happen. And they make it happen. 

I realize this reads as a kind of love letter to our students, and I suppose it is in some regards, but dammit if I ever let some boomer tell me that the world is going to hell in a hand basket, or someone jokes about the value of these wonderful, incredible humans’ degree in poli sci. They clearly haven’t met our students."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffb7xpd,t3_esns9n,1579754422.0,"Ladies, I’ve had four IUD’s and they are THE BEST. Nothing to think about before sex, less hormones than the pill or even the ring, and they last for years. 

Yes, getting them placed sucks, but what I would highly, highly, highly recommend (and have done in the past) is COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE YOU GET IT PLACED. 

Let them know that you’re scared and or that you are super sensitive to pain. When I did this, my doc gave me a script for Xanax for the anxiety for the morning of the procedure. And I was also able to request semi-sedation for the procedure itself.

It. Was. A. Game. Changer. 

I know not everyone may have access to doctors who are able to provide semi sedation, but there are also other options such as a nerve blocking shot (yes, it pinches but then it’s fine). 

One of the things that this has taught me that was a really good lesson and I hope all ladies know is that communicating with your doctors and advocating for yourself is so important. There are often methods that doctors may have but not necessarily offer right away because they don’t know that you feel some sort of way. It’s soooo helpful to let it out and be up front about it. So often women “grin and bear it” because we’re taught to repress negative emotions, but you may not have to be in pain!

So ladies, stand in your power and talk to your doctor. Tip them off early if you can, but make sure you keep communicating."

When I last made Swiss meringue buttercream, It was beautiful at first but I left it overnight and the next day, it had just about... melted? The icing still looked pretty but there was a puddle of something around the base. It was sticky but I wasn’t sure what it was or why it had done that. 

Also, sometimes when I’m piping, (Swiss meringue cuz it’s my favorite buttercream) the icing looks kinda melts as it comes out. I thought maybe I was pressing too hard. I try to reduce the amount of sugar I put in the frosting so it’s not overly sweet. Could this be why it’s a bit blobby?

Thank you!!!"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fep7qx5,t1_feo8gf8,1579314025.0,I love mine. Some people get heavier periods if they have the copper/non-hormonal iuds but I have the hormone one (mirena/liletta) and theyre awesome.  I have wayyyyy lighter periods if I get a period at all and never have to worry about taking anything or anything. Just make sure to have them changed promptly at 5 years.
