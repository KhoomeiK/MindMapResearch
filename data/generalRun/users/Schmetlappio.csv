If you have two brain cells to rub together you’re probably aware that nobody’s going to ever realistically get a closeup of a rock being skipped directly into their camera/face at close range. It’s so indescribably obvious I don’t think you could ever realistically call it an attempt at deception."
aww,ffi9kd3,t1_ffhntpz,1579968573.0,"Ah, yeah I’m aware of the “must fit in carrier” rule, but the only context I’ve ever been able to find for it is that they have to fit under your seat, which theoretically wouldn’t apply if you bought their ticket. That’s the main thing I wondered."

That and the gate attendant is simply just not going to let you take the dog onto the jet bridge. They’d make you gate check the carrier."
