The general idea is that the MAP is the lowest price you can display the item for to the general public. However, a subscription that causes the prices to change means that the general public isnt seeing that when they log onto the site. The same is true for sites that offer reduced pricing when you sign into a profile, or sites that discount the price when you go to checkout. Some places will even just say ""add to cart for price,"" and not display a normal price. Because the price isnt ""advertised"" as being under map, it's not a violation. 

Same is true for your dealer. He cant tag something as being under map, but he can tell you ""hey, how about I knock $50 off the price,"" when you're humming and hawing about buying it, even if that puts him under map. Fuck, he can discount it for everyone if he wants, as long as it isn't openly priced as being under map.

California keeps an approved ""Pistol Roster"" for all semi auto pistols and double action revolvers. In order to get a pistol on the roster, the manufacturer must submit the pistol to the state, along with a fee. The pistol must pass a series of safety tests and have several safety features, though im not certain what they are. the manufacturer must also pay an anual renewal fee to keep the pistol on the roster.

on top of this, the roster is model specific. So while one gun may be on it, another that differs just by virtue of being a different color may not be. and to further complicate things, a few years back california issued a new requirement, microstamping, on the list of safety features. Microstamping is the process of the firing pin stamping the serial number of the gun on the primer during firing. It is also, for all intents and purposes, a thoroughly fictional technology.

because of this, new pistols simply can't be added to the roster.

luckily, california keeps the roster public. It looks like Beretta has several Model 92 pistols on their, including a couple Brig models.

weekendgunnit,fe8xm5i,t1_fe6pinc,1578932092.0,"TLDR; we (or rather I) aren't pro-military, but rather supportive of individuals who recognize our civil rights, some of whom are in the military.

I dont presume to speak for the group, but this is how I personally see it.

If I understand correctly, the US Military is meant to uphold and protect the Constitution and the citizens of the United States, rather than the Government. Thus it would stand to reason that the Military would support a lawful insurrection based on the violation of civil rights by the government.

This is evident upon reading the US Uniformed Service Oath of Office.

>I, [name], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.

That said, the military is made of people and people are complicated. The military is not a single minded organization, and so each member will have to make their own determination as to whether or not their allegiance is owed to the insurectionists or the government. I'm sure a certain number of folks will simply defer to the judgement of their superiors, because making decisions about morality and shit is hard. In the end, the military will almost certainly splinter into at least two factions, a loyalist and rebel faction, with perhaps a few independent splinter cells here and there.

The issue really comes when the war ends. If the side that wins still has a significant and functional military standing, that military will almost certainly try to seize power. Ideally, it will simply provide an authority to the people while a constitutional convention occurs and a true government is agreed upon, and then it will hand over power to that authority when the time comes. However it's much more often in cases like these that the military will retain power, lead by some kind of Governor-General, until its ousted by another coup, likely lead by one of the GGs underlings.

It's for this reason that violent rebellion is should be the last resort when it comes to altering one's government. It often perpetuates a cycle of violence that is nigh but impossible to break. So when an insurrection is first built, it's imperative that the leadership be comprised of men who are both moral enough to give up their power when the time comes, but strong and charismatic enough to convince their subordinates that this is the correct course of action."

The only use it would ever have is as a complete last ditch gun when you're fighting off the zombies/commies/rape dwarves/whatever and youre down to your last shot and they're breaking down the door, and you need something to make sure you dont have to live through what comes next, cuz quite honestly, I barely trust it to do one shot."
