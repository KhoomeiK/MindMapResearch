Of course it started out just being a pragmatic way of not dying, but it evolved and became part of our culture. The problem is that nobody else apparently developed past that furst stage.

Once we discovered FTL-Propulsion in the 23rd Century the discovery of alien life soon followes. But not just a single species. There was a whole ass United Galatic Empire. And after initial vetting we were soon invited to the galatic senate. Straight foward really. We elected out senators and send them on their way. With a envoy of doctors, secruity, and most importantly cooks. Going after old diplomatic customs the senators invited to dinners and word soon spread. Political favours were traded for a single dinner of human food. And from there on out the word spread from politicians to the rich and fron the rich to the common souls. 

At first only some brave beings made it to the outer edges of the milky way. Of course humanity was prepared for visits from aliens. But the expected scientist and researchers never came. To out suprise people only came for the food. Over the span of a couple of years we had a throughput of a billion beings a day.

The buisness savy soon started opening change restaurants on the inner galactic planets and making a fortune with cheap fast food. And in the following centuries we turned from general industrialist to just a solely culnirary species.
And became rich in the process."
