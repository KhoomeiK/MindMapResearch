> Gehrig played well in limited action, hitting .500 and picking up five RBIs in 12 at-bats. The most memorable event from that brief stint came during a game against the Detroit Tigers. Gehrig had hit a two-run single to right field, but turned too far while rounding first and got caught off the base. This led to an extended rundown in which Ty Cobb sprinted in from center field while Gehrig was caught in the pickle and tagged out the young slugger. Cobb swore at Gehrig as he tagged him.  

> Gehrig was, for the most part, a dignified player who rarely raised any kind of a ruckus on the field, but now Cobb had made him furious. He cursed at Cobb as he walked off the field and continued screaming at the Georgia Peach from the steps of the Yankees dugout. The umpire warned Gehrig to pipe down, but he kept at Cobb. After another warning that went unheeded, the ump ejected Gehrig from the game, which only fanned the flames of his anger. When the game ended, still steaming from the altercation, Gehrig went after Cobb in the tunnel between the dugout and the clubhouse, and, despite teammate Babe Ruth’s best efforts to contain him, Gehrig got loose and hurled a punch at the meanest man in baseball history. Unfortunately for Gehrig, he fanned on the haymaker, stumbled forward, landed on his head on the hard concrete floor and was temporarily knocked out.

> When he awoke, he said only one thing: “Did I win?” He hadn’t, but then again, few men ever got the best of Ty Cobb.

**Edit:** In another account, when Gehrig was unconscious on the ground, Cobb started kicking him, prompting Ruth to step in and slug him."

During the battle, if you killed a notable enemy, you would take his head to claim your kill. As you can imagine, by the second or third head you might have to stop taking heads. Kani didn't want to stop fighting, so he didn't bother taking heads. After the battle, some less honorable samurai would take heads off fallen enemies and claim them as their own kills, proudly displaying them in the camp. Kani would then open the head's mouth and reveal that it had been stuffed with bamboo grass from his bamboo sashimono! 

He also wielded a naginata, long pole-arm like weapon. Late in life, he was riding a horse and asked another soldier to carry his naginata for him. Another samurai mocked him for not carrying his own weapon. The 70-year-old Kani dismounted, beheaded the samurai, and got back on his horse... but after that he carried his own naginata."

It goes into a lot of cool ideas, like how it likely happens with planets orbiting red dwarf stars; there would never be a sunrise or a sunset, just perpetual sun on one side, night on the other, and twilight in between; liquid water might only exist in the border, being too hot on the sunny side and too cold on the other; what the wind might be like; and so on!"
worldbuilding,ff4xde7,t3_ernzku,1579574722.0,"If this is a fantasy setting, you could just say the gods make it so. Maybe your world has four principal gods who were at war, and as a truce divided it into four parts. 

Four parts lends itself well to the four basic elements (air, earth, fire, water), the four seasons, four primary colors (red, yellow, blue, and then black, white, or gray?), and so on."
worldbuilding,ff4wxat,t1_ff4wkyt,1579574416.0,"Not OC, but look up tidal locking. The idea is one side of the planet always faces the sun and the other always faces away from it; the sun side is too hot to support (most) life and the dark side is too cold. There’s a band on the border between the two sides in perpetual twilight that’s “just right.”"

Other businessmen as either a practical joke or in an attempt to ruin him would give him “tips,” like trying to sell wool mittens in the tropics, and then through some odd coincidence the “useless” items were highly in demand and sold at profit — in the case of the mittens, Asian merchants bought them to export to Siberia.
