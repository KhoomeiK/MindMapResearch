bipolar,fe3jlu9,t3_ennldo,1578849828.0,"Had an anxiety attack in public today. Probably freaked out my friend I was with as I was really irritable with it I thought I was getting all hypomanic out of no where. Kinda embarassing. I got home and thought 'well fuck her, I'm sick of apologising for being mentally ill'. 

Really bumbed about it. I got BP meds maybe 8 weeks ago and have been feeling really calm and happy since then. This just came out of nowhere today. Self caring with some dumb youtube and blankets. Might make a healthy meal later."

Hopefully my point comes across here. Don't know how else to word it."

stopdrinking,fboeekp,t3_edzj85,1577009645.0,It embarasses me how exremely undignified drinking made me. Its like becoming a toddler again whilst believing you have leveled up to a god. Ive seen it a million times in others when working in bars and pubs. Just never recognised it in my own drunken idiocy (obviously). So glad i dont have to cringe about that anymore. Iwndwyt
