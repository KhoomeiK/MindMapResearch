uberdrivers,ffjqbkp,t3_etxjcz,1580004240.0,"This is a pax trying to schedule a pick-up at the Honolulu Airport only they don't know how. Accept, edumacate them and collect the wait time money for them being a noob."
uberdrivers,fet05up,t3_eqceeb,1579370591.0,"You can, but that means you're discounting your service level every time you accept an X trip. It makes the rider feel real good and you look stupid."
uberdrivers,fe057jh,t1_fe037ep,1578803354.0,Keep hoping.
uberdrivers,fdzrn9p,t3_enc9aq,1578794190.0,"You are inside of a geofence when you get near the airport, but not in the queue until you are in the waiting lot.

Be a smart driver and drop at the airport then get out. It's a time waster to wait there."
uberdrivers,fdzr4bz,t1_fdxo1h7,1578793878.0,The riders wait out the surge.
facepalm,fdzqm4w,t1_fdwfdi2,1578793540.0,You should try applying to the US government for a job. Then you'll see stuff like that. They ask for a PhD and start you out at $15-$16 an hour.
facepalm,fdzpvtx,t3_encovo,1578793084.0,"Wouldn't it be nice for them to not have to live in ancient palaces with horrifics histories under the scrutiny of the press, public and the other family members all the time and getting all those hand-me-down from your sister-in-law. Poor thing."
uberdrivers,fdzp5re,t3_engg1u,1578792705.0,Go ahead and be a limo driver if you want to. They do all of that stuff and more.
uberdrivers,fdzox85,t3_enfzq8,1578792586.0,"There are a few things to consider when changing from X to XL/Select.

1. There is a steep learning curve on where the XL/Select rides come from.
2. Your vehicle has to be on the approved list for both XL and Select as well as be 5 years old or newer, so in that respect, it's not like Uber X at all. You just can't drive any 6 seater you want to.
3. The only way around spending so much for gas ( at one point I was filling up my tank daily to earn the kind of money I was looking for and that eats into your profits) is driving a hybrid or electric vehicle, and the 6 seaters are few and far between.

If you really want your trips to be viable, go get your limo license and drive a limo that someone else owns and split the profit with them."
uberdrivers,fdzmdor,t3_engg2b,1578791670.0,She kicked your car? I hope you took a photo of ANY damage and turned it into Uber for reimbursement.
uberdrivers,fdzli4a,t3_enfptv,1578791355.0,"1. Don't turn off your app, just wait.
2. It can surge all it wants, the rider is going to wait it out and you'll get a base ride out of the surge zone.
3. Opportunity locations are ones that are on blast to every driver in the area because there is a high demand. It's how Uber kills a surge zone by getting more drivers into an area."
uberdrivers,fdzjjm9,t3_en4a3p,1578790836.0,Where can I poop? That was the thing I was always thinking about driving around LA when the app took me out of my area and to LAX all the dang time.
uberdrivers,fdn1ezl,t1_fdmdngp,1578574333.0,"Pool is so irritating. For me, it was like being the ringmaster of a circus. I'd announce the clown we were picking up and the next clown to get dropped off just so no one complained."
uberdrivers,fdmzuin,t3_em6tlp,1578572803.0,"Oh, been there, done that. I was driving my dad's Dodge Ram truck home from work in the rain after inheriting it and had a tire blow out. I never had to change a truck tire before (and no manuals in the glovebox to read how to do it)  so I had to call AAA and watch them do it so next time I could at least feel like I knew what I was doing. I absolutely know how to do it on a normal sedan, but not this truck! No next time though because I sold that truck shortly after buying a new set of tires."

uberdrivers,fdjr0hk,t3_ele1wl,1578484194.0,"I had a backseat drunk screamer who refused to put on his seatbelt one night. It was downtown, so I pull over near the police station and said, ""This ride is over. You're welcome to order another Uber, but because you refuse to treat me with respect and follow the law, we are done for tonight, so get out. And if you've got a problem with that the police station is right over there (pointing to the police station)"". It was intense. Cussing and door slamming. Reported him and still got the paid."
uberdrivers,fdjpv7w,t3_elieos,1578482749.0,"I accepted a trip on the Lyft app working my way back home from the airport. Unfamiliar with the pickup location and parked, I called the pax immediately to get a landmark because their pindrop didn't match the address. Then I moved the car and Lyft cancels the trip because I guess good customer service is not allowed. You have to put your vehicle in motion within something like 2 minutes after accepting a trip. I called Lyft and complained about their tactics."
