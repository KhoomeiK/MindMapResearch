Also you don’t get extra for each child, so some of them have 3 kids but still get the 2000 married couple with kid bonus.

No one I was with had this issue and I’ve never had it before in imax. There were parts where I had to close my eyes because it looked like a knock off dvd from a handheld camera. I thought it was intentional because the protagonist had hurt his eyes so you were seeing it with his vision, but this isn’t the case. I’m so disappointed because everyone I was with was raving about it but it was unwatchable. I’ve seen a couple of comments with the same problem but not really that many so now I feel insane. I have perfect vision and it was back to perfect as soon as I walked out the cinema."

So you end up with people who think women grow a human and maybe have a few issues like feeling sick, but it’s all ok.

For instance my bf’s family are all pretty well off but the grandparents grew up poor in ireland. The whole family treats food like they’re not going to see another meal. They drink horlicks before bed for “vitamins” and it says on the tub that it was used by arctic explorers to sustain themselves.

She then waited outside for the club to close and then ran back inside up the fire exit. The one remaining bouncer had to call another bouncer from the bar next door because she was going so insane. He had hold of her gently to try not to hurt her but she was basically running up the wall with him still having hold of her. Eventually she got put outside again but she wouldn’t leave the street and was rampaging up and down screaming and kicking things. No one could go home because she was outside waiting to attack everyone. Eventually the little shift manager who was young and new at the job had to call the police. He got in so much shit for it.

They are less “in your face fantasy” which sometimes puts off new readers who maybe aren’t used to such obscure weird humour. (I’m basing this on comments from my friends who said shit like “I tried reading but it was so weird”). Then I would recommend starting from the beginning and any you don’t like just skip, his books span lots of different genres all within the same world. My favs are: all the night watch books except Thud (don’t know why), Mort, and The Last Continent."

Going out for midweek drinks (often with your boss and entire team) is pretty standard, and being hungover at work in the UK isn’t something anyone would bat an eyelid at. But we probably have a binge drinking problem in the whole of the UK anyway."

You can’t wear one on a football strip because political messages are banned or something so it ends up in a scandal every year with people screeching “they should pay the fine! Where’s the poppy?!” My parents will ask where my poppy is if I’ve forgotten to move it over on coats, clearly taken in by all the boomer memes about how younger people refuse to wear them (not true). My village cracks out the flags (who knows where they live the rest of the year) and the war memorial finally has flags on the poles. Oddly the rest of the year the three flag poles are empty which would possibly confuse Americans."

I think the person in authority will just go “it’s bad because gays” and they won’t stop and think about how this is absurd, because if they thought about absurdity they wouldn’t still have the same faith. They would have gotten as far as Adam and Eve being kicked out of Eden and laughed."

I know a lot of NI people and even their ancient catholic grandparents aren’t really bothered or are supportive as times have changed. I know someone who votes DUP, is anti abortion, anti gay rights, and doesn’t even drink on Christmas because alcohol is a sin but they’re laughed at by everyone and seem out of the ordinary. In short: I imagine so but I have never heard of anyone except the family who are laughed at for being too extreme. Everyone I know was embarrassed at how their country looked because it’s getting to the stage where the only countries that still don’t have gay marriage aren’t really ones you want to be similar to."
