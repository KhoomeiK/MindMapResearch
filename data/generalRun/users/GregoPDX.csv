This is absolutely wrong.  With respect to the temperature in the house, the furnace has no concept of it and simply pumps out heat when it is told to do so by the thermostat.

The coaches knew it was against the rules and brought the girls in on athletic deferrals in sports (crew/rowing) that they didn't participate in.  Do you really think USC would've agreed to let them in for nothing?  Because none of the money Loughlin and Mossimo paid went to the USC coffers - it went to individuals either running the scam or used as payoffs to facilitate the scam.  It's *the* actual narrative.  Loughlin and Mossimo's defense even says this, they just say their clients 'didn't know' they weren't donating to the school.

news,fennstt,t1_fen2lc1,1579288391.0,"USC actually was not complicit.

Loughlin and Giannulli's daughters were very poor students and without help wouldn't normally get into USC since it is such a competitive school.  Being rich, they could always simply make a large donation directly to the school and USC could let them in - USC is a private college and can admit whomever they want.  Loughlin and Giannulli (Giannulli is am alum) must've tried that route because from the article there was correspondence with USC regarding helping them to facilitate that.

However, that is not what happened.  Loughlin and Giannulli decided to not go the regular, legal route to get their poor student children in (one that contributes to the school itself), but get their kid in using a 3rd party that has gamed the system by bribing some coaches and other staff to accept their kids as athletes.  It saved them some money but it is ultimately illegal.  A couple employees of USC taking bribes and breaking school rules does not make the entirety of the university 'complicit'.  The employees were essentially stealing donations from the university, why would the university be complicit in that?

television,fcv7aek,t3_ej0ae0,1577996122.0,"Do you like Aaron Sorkin?  *Sports Night*, *West Wing*?  It's a serious question because this is Sorkin unleashed.  He really is in full revisionist form in this show, picking apart past real-life news stories and trying to push an agenda of how he thinks network news should be.  He's not necessarily wrong, it's just overall it can get preachy - real preachy.

The characters are interesting and flawed as usual with his stuff.  I personally liked the series but think it sets a bad tone from the first scene with the 'what makes America great' rant.  Sorkin also loves having two characters who are clearly meant for each other, in individually crappy relationships, constantly having near misses at a relationship until later in the series.  His dialogue style isn't for everyone, although I personally enjoy it (he wrote *The Social Network*, as an example that most people have seen)."

For those that don't get the reference, Kevin Smith picketed his own movie, *Dogma*, with that slogan on a sign.  He was in a group of religious folks, most likely Catholics, who had never seen the movie so had no idea what it was about other than what they were told by religious propaganda.

There was similar protests over *The Last Temptation of Christ* because it shows Jesus in a married relationship.  Which, if you've seen the movie, is the entire point - Jesus is tempted with a vision of what his life could/would be if he chose not to sacrifice himself but does so willingly."

In my hometown, the big aluminum mill shut down with talk it was going to reopen ‘soon’.  With a mix of unemployment and what the mill was covering, people were getting almost their full paycheck to just be available to sometimes come in to make sure the mill was able to be turned back to running again.

The smart ones retrained with their free time, others not so much.  They just fucked around because they couldn’t or wouldn’t see the writing on the wall.  It was literally just like the ant and grasshopper fable.  The mill never reopened, just like almost all the aluminum mills in the US."

Personally, I love the movie *Death to Smoochy*.  It’s not everyone’s cup of tea and if someone says they don’t like it and it unrelatable that should just be taken at face value.  You never should need to beat someone over the head because they do or don’t like something, and it makes it worse if you pull the ‘you just didn’t get it’ card.
