WTF,ffpy1t4,t1_ffpf2c6,1580110402.0,Use water and something sterile! Straight tap water will add bacteria to your already probably really sore ear.

AskReddit,ffh7scw,t1_ffh7qhc,1579925536.0,I am below average in ability in basketball but I'm okay because I want to meet folks and get some exercise.
AskReddit,ffh7qhc,t1_ffh6plv,1579925493.0,"I also got a friend group out if thin air by posting on Nextdoor that I was looking for folks to play soccer or basketball with... The response was wonderful. Meet some great guys that way. We're starting our own team! 

First game is this Sunday, and we never met each other before the post :-)

Just gotta put yourself out there Brosef!"
AskReddit,ffh7jug,t1_ffh6plv,1579925336.0,"Nice. Might try some community events that get you out of the house.

The biggest challenge is finding lots of opportunities to make friends of all kinds. The more you're outside of the house the more likely you are to casually meet someone. 

Helps to have a routine of sorts or a longer commitment, otherwise you might miss someone. And being generous with your time and attention will always attract interesting people. And doesn't cost you much.

It makes getting back to video games much sweeter too. You'll miss it, but then get jump back in like you never left. 

Video games aren't going anywhere. They'll always be great."
AskReddit,ffh2nmb,t1_ffgprvw,1579921465.0,Might be you?

Sports?"
AskReddit,ffh2i6m,t1_ffgd284,1579921349.0,Sounds like a therapist can help with that.
AskReddit,ffh2fzr,t1_ffgrwk0,1579921302.0,"I feel you guy. And I see you... Metaphorically, of course. Not a weirdo.

Just can't give up. Schedule some stuff for yourself to do, pay up front so it's hard to back out. Make it something fun you never got anyone to go with you before. But just promise to try and enjoy yourself. 

Be open to random conversations. Keep your phone in your pocket. Maybe offer to take someone you know might not be able to afford but you'd enjoy their company.

Good luck homie! Keep on keeping on!"
AskReddit,ffh26db,t1_ffgi7wo,1579921099.0,"You could try to invite the both of them out. Getting to know her helps you know him, and makes her less worried about a bad influence on her husband.

And like OP said, you might make yourself vulnerable and say I was just hoping we could kick it because I could really use someone to talk to.

And sometimes you just got to keep it moving... No hard feelings.

Good luck mate."
AskReddit,ffh1yjc,t1_ffge1sf,1579920934.0,What do you like to do for fun?
AskReddit,ffh1q1m,t1_ffguw46,1579920757.0,"You just have to be tasteful and genuine about it.

For my women colleagues, who are my friends I should note, when they come dressed a little nicer than usual I can tell by their shoes. 

""Ohh nice! You've got your Fierce Boots on. Looking sharp!""

You can compliment hair as well, but again, be genuine. 

Compliment them while showing appreciation for something. ""Hey I just wanted to let you know before I forget, you really nailed in that meeting. I'm always impressed by how prepared and confident you sound. Great job.""

Be. Genuine. And, don't wait for reciprocation. That's not the point of a compliment. 

It's just about being thoughtful, that's all. 

MeToo has exposed people who only see women as sex objects as incapable of change and capable of conspiracy and criminal activity.

Giving people thoughtful compliments is not related."

todayilearned,fefcldl,t1_fee2uuv,1579053392.0,"First, good on you mate for trying to become a better person. Seriously. Thank you.

Second, I think OP's sentiment is more likely an appreciation of people like yourself, not that people like yourself are somehow more appreciative than those that have never had an inherented bias."
todayilearned,fefbpe3,t3_eoqy6j,1579052806.0,"Dude was a patriot for real. Just goes to show you that even then we didn't do enough to support former soldiers after returning from war, saying he died poor while petitioning Congress for support for three years prior to dying.

His origin story alone is the stuff of legends and tall tales."
todayilearned,fef9jls,t1_fef5xdq,1579051381.0,"Right. How is this possible? What did he say about the matter? Did he remember anything that happened? Was he meditating?

It's shocking I had to scroll this far for the thread asking ""HOW DID HE DO THIS?"""
