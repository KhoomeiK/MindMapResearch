FUCK AYN RYND AND HER CUNTIST OBJECTIVISM. I LOVE PROGRESSIVE TAXATION. PLEASE. THOUGH. PROVE TO ME THAT LABOR IS MORE IMPORTANT TO THE MODERN ECONOMY THAN CAPITAL. I AWAIT YOUR RESPONSE, SO I CAN SHARE MORE\*conventional economic wisdom\* FOR EXAMPLE, THAT WHICH DISPROVED \~austrian economics\~ of Jevons and Walras. The fact of the matter is, MARGINAL PRODUCTS EXIST. AND LABOR IS LESS VALUABLE THAN CAPITAL, PERIOD. It is NOT MY FAULT that you are entirely FUNGIBLE \*(look it up it's a fantastic word that you clearly don't understand)\* and it is NOT MY FAULT that capital plays an outsized role compared to labor in the modern economy. If you believed that labor>capital, you would oppose, for example, UBI. But, I doubt you do for the reasons outlined (you might argue against it on principle. But, I would imagine that you are a staunch proponent thereof.

PoliticalHumor,fdyj21r,t1_fdyh040,1578780307.0,"I said nothing about stock market lmao i said capital stocks- stockpiles/levels of capital. I'm not arguing about smith on taxation im arguing about smith on capital; you saying that labor is more productive than capital is asinine. China has the largest labor pool in the world, india the second largest. You can infer what I'm arguing here (but i doubt you're smart enough to do that, so I'll spell it out) China India Africa LOTS of people Europe America fewer people. China india smaller economies; US Europe bigger economies. You're making my argument for me. You're calling me a child, and you're strawmanning my arguments on smith. But you're not refuting that capital has a higher marginal product than labor :) Lastly, you don't have a grasp on economics .

enjoy a quote from the paper, if you don't read all of it:

"" Capital deepening, then, also generally leads to an increase in the growth rate of total output. Capital deepening is also thought to be a major factor—if not a prerequisite—of economic development in emerging markets.""

Youre ALSO WRONG on smith on taxation, apparently. Wow you need to study some economics before you try to argue it.

PoliticalHumor,fdygbfh,t1_fdyfpk6,1578779521.0,"And yet which has the greater impact- labor or capital. Have you taken an economics class? or are you just forming your own discipline right now? The laborers are entirely fungible. but without the capital stocks the world would not look like it does now. What is the difference between the malthusian model and the more modern economic models, anyways? Oh right, it's capital. Read some Ricardo or Smith and what they say on capital and its role in productivity. People born before America existed clearly understand how the economy works better than you"
PoliticalHumor,fdyehj6,t1_fdycwi2,1578778887.0,"You're being obtuse and misrepresenting Lincoln's statement. In 1865 the US already had accumulated SUBSTANTIAL capital stocks, which were continuing to accumulate. Oh, and the labor market was DRASTICALLY shifted around that time, wasn't it. And yet, look at where we are. The quote is

""Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration.""

He would be correct that labor is needed to create capital. But, he is also arguing that labor is more important than capital- and he is markedly wrong there. You cannot argue one part of the quote and neglect the heart of his statement, which, again, is incorrect"
PoliticalHumor,fdycf40,t1_fdyapct,1578778289.0,"That's just a stupid argument. Sure labor is required to build capital. But capital accumulates, labor is accretive. More labor decreases marginal product of labor; capital grows productivity exponentially."
