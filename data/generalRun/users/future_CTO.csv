If you can say without getting in trouble, will The Monitor, Harbinger or Oliver Queen as the green arrow return at any point during the conclusion of Crisis on Infinite Earths?"
college,fdmbyjy,t3_elzg04,1578545096.0,"Go to your Universities counseling center, should be free for students as long as you turned in the required paper work and meet any other requirements they may have. Btw, I'm sorry your parents don't believe you have anxiety. For my parents seeing was believing... they saw me missing school and experiencing panic attacks and other horrible symptoms and took me too the doctors when I was younger. Try to Explain to your parents that your having physical symptoms also, hopefully that will help"
DCTV,fdmb1ob,t3_elyvxn,1578544361.0,Cannot wait!
college,fdbgoq5,t3_ekfbwy,1578257176.0,Definitely tell them.  Also check with your schools resources for students. The counseling center or something like it will be able to point you in the right direction for community resources.
college,fcy1mh4,t3_ej8whr,1578073472.0,"As others have said express your gratitude for the scholarship, but after talking about career/school topics, you can also talk about personal interests as well. Not too personal though, keep it PG with topics like sports, news, movies, etc. Good luck and congrats."
math,fcy0ssj,t3_ejh6el,1578073182.0,"I think they are to wordy because they are often written like English textbooks, when they should include more visual examples without skipping steps. I also think they are too expensive, but that a completely different topic lol"

ITCareerQuestions,fcxwfdn,t3_ejbt30,1578071415.0,"I'm an IT student who has FAILED plenty. I started off as Compute science major and I failed my first upper level math class in community college.  I retook it online the next semester, passed with a C. After graduation I had an IT related internship at a prestigious university. I was excited and really wanted to make a good impression with my managers and coworkers.  I failed big time. I worked there for THREE DAYS and had to quit because of health issues. I was so upset and depressed about this. I thought I was the biggest failure ever. But nevertheless, I got myself together and transferred to a four year school. Upon transferring to a four year school health issues caught up with me again and I missed a lot of time in school, this caused me to fail a required computer science course. I failed the course not once but TWICE. (well I passed with a D the first time, but my school doesn't allow D's in major classes) At this point, I thought I was a second time failure, I was on academic warning and also getting kicked out of my major. I sulked for a few months... but I eventually got myself together. I changed my major to IT this pass fall semester and buckled down.  I managed my health issues, scheduled my study times and had a great semester, even making the deans list. Sorry for the long story about my life... I just wanted to make the point that we shouldn't be afraid to mess up or fail. What counts is the comeback. What you do after you fail is what matters. Stay on top of your online coursework, message/email your professors and you'll do just fine! Goodluck!"
