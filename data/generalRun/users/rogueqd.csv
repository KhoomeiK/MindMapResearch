minimalism,fftbzj7,t1_fft2c6b,1580215910.0,"You're borderline quoting me out of context there. Also, I actually love rain, so some people do. :)

So how often do you actually go out in heavy rain? I know Scotland is cold, but apart from that I'm just guessing about the amount of rain."
minimalism,ffs64ln,t1_ffs0zjc,1580174083.0,"If you already have them then there's little benefit in discarding them, but when you buy a new coat try to find multi-purpose ones. Maybe you could use formal ones as everyday ones as well? Is it possible to not have the two heavy rain coats and just not go out in heavy rain? Maybe use your spring dry coat when it is very cold but dry and just put a jumper underneath?

In the end minimalism is having no more than what is needed. If you really do need a different coat for every weather condition listed, then maybe minimalism for you is only having one coat for each type of weather."

I also cut out all snacks/chocolate/etc. No exercise required. Although I am exercising now since I lost the weight.
