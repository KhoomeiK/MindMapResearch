depression,fe19nl8,t3_enfyh1,1578824096.0,"This really hits me hard. All my past friends whom I have been the closest to, it really makes me think that I am just a burden to them. Yesterday I just flat out removed Messenger on my phone to control myself, I tend to voice out my problems to them and I feel that they're growing tired on all of it."

depression,fdnu3ss,t3_cml6ni,1578592862.0,"Had a good conversation with a stranger, it delayed my sleep a little longer but I'm now. I have to stay on my habit of waking up early, just a little thing but it makes my day much more fulfilling & I feel I achieved something that I planned for."
depression,fdnojy1,t1_fdnksux,1578589987.0,"I'm going to be honest with you, I'm just 16. I experienced that last year so I was 15 back then. And I gotta say it's true for the most part that when you're a kid you develop your own coping mechanism. (I don't consider myself a kid anymore, most of the people that knew me always see me as a person who's always serious, that kid who's always topper, the kid you can't talk to, I wasn't able to resonate with most of them because of this). First instinct of mine is that I think I just need to go out there. Because I felt at that time I was rushing to prepare myself for College, learning a lot of I.T. I don't go out often just stare at my computer screen for the rest of my day, even though I was just about to graduate Junior High, and add to that it was the time I seriously suffered from identity crisis namely my sexuality.

Thinking about it, I've gone a long way since."
depression,fdni226,t3_emaxm4,1578586246.0,"Huge respect for you there for fighting this long. When I first dipped into depression just last year, it felt like I may never come out of the darkness. These days, I can handle myself much better, often self care like going outside for a while, walking to an unfamiliar road just to see buildings and new people, not listening to a sad song while I'm in a vulnerable mood, things like that.

I'm proud that I didn't gave in to my thoughts of suicide that I even used to countdown when to hang myself, I am proud that I managed to stopped my drinking that just worsened my mental status that time. This year I'm looking forward for a new start and there is definitely an end to this kind of endless tunnel. :)"

DataHoarder,fdmnmsz,t1_fdmlfbi,1578556989.0,"I'm sorry I think I didn't include enough details, I WAS a data hoarder already back then, even before I discovered Reddit & this sub. I used to download all the videos I already watched in youtube to my local drive and used Spotify as a list to grab all the latest music I can also in youtube. But that was like 2 years ago I think.  


It's just that this recent happenings made me think what if it will happen, it made me go back my old habits."
ForeverAlone,fdgeq2a,t3_el8qk3,1578393324.0,"In the same boat right now, I had this new crush but I won't be telling how I feel towards him anymore, seeing how my last friendship (and the only Best Friend I had at that time) ended so badly."
LGBTeens,fd8zjbg,t3_ekasma,1578225887.0,"Find an interest club or something like that. If you're 16 then you must be in SHS already so your classmates and you are likely to have in common. 

Being gay isn't going to throw a friend if they are really your friend, goodluck out thereðŸ˜Š"
SubsYouFellFor,fd840en,t3_ek9mmr,1578213634.0,"Good one! ðŸ˜‚ 

Unrelated to the joke but you can actually unlock a luggage without destroying the pin code lock. Get your flashlight, shine it under the lock and move one wheel until you can see a hole beneath them, repeat for the two remaining wheels until all of the holes line up. Once that done, now move by one digit all of them then try to unlock, eventually you'll be able to slide the lock then just set a new one. 

they are not so secure as some thought they are, so padlock the zipper for additional protection. ðŸ™‚"

Philippines,fd2b3kl,t3_ejljfx,1578144583.0,"I discovered the Cliqq was just a website, not really an app. Cause one time I saw Firefox in it unmaximize, it runs Lubuntu as it's OS (Linux) so most probably it's a cheap pc meant to just run in kiosk."
depression,fcwibje,t3_ej1l29,1578026382.0,"Being INFP I can really relate to some you said. Even if you have a really good intentions of fixing the damn corrupted system, at the end of the day you realized you can't, you are just a single person voting. Being in this personality of just 4% also makes me feel much more depressed than I am, everyday is a struggle knowing that there isn't much people that can understand and feel sympathy, concern and comfort the way I do it to others. 

Ironic, when someone's depressed, I am the first one to comfort them, even if they don't tell me but when I am the one. No one comes, even if they know, it just proves that I'd have to be strong on my own. I am stuck on give it all up & keep moving."

SuicideWatch,fcu7sgl,t1_fcu3zqv,1577974587.0,"I wish life was like that, a game where you reach a certain part of a level, then you die you know what these characters are, their life. Like if I would encounter a person that knows the me that died, I would ask them the past me was a good person to them.  I would try it all over again a certain decision that I mde would make a big difference to my life, maybe it is better and this time I don't have to kill myself and start all over again."
