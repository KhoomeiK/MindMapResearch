>The problem is what they leave behind — tons of garbage and human waste that have earned the natural wonder the distinction as the “world’s highest garbage dump.”

>The issue was underscored on Wednesday, when the government of Nepal announced that 24,200 pounds of garbage were pulled off the mountain during a 45-day cleanup expedition, according to the Times of India. Bigyan Dev Pandey, a spokesman for the Nepal Army, told the paper that the tens of thousands of pounds of trash included “empty oxygen cylinders, plastic bottles, cans, batteries, food wrappings, fecal matter and kitchen waste.”

>Four human bodies also were recovered as part of the expedition, according to the Associated Press.

>“Overall, the past 10 years have seen a lot of changes in the mountains, and they all have been for the negative environmentally in terms of long term survivability of the glaciers,” All told the AP this week.

>Specifically, All and his team noted the dark color of the snow around Everest — a result of pollution.

>“What that means is there are little pieces of pollution that the snow is forming around, so the snow is actually trapping the pollution and pulling it down,” he explained.

Now, they do require people to take trash with them, but it's only a certain amount, and compared to what humans are capable of producing, to say nothing of actual human waste, it's no surprise that there's so much up there. They removed that 24,000 pounds last year but there's no doubt there is and will be more.

As for bodies, I know some simply can't be retrieved. I imagine removal is based on accessibility and safety (for the people retrieving them). I'm not sure about specific bodies."
