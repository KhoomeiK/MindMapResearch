Have fun with that."
educationalgifs,fegunrb,t1_fecdup5,1579102923.0,"Except that is a list of organizations who support that statement, not evidence to support it.  Again, the AHA was bribed to support that statement by P&G.  There is not substantial evidence to support the idea that saturated fat is harmful.  For every study that claims to support that, there's another that claims to contradict it."
educationalgifs,fea8n8q,t1_fea10va,1578945662.0,">They did not.

Yes, lots of people did.  There was overwhelming evidence that the introduction of trans fats in the 1910s caused a huge increase in a number of dietary diseases, and many doctors and scientists warned about this.  But procter and gamble had a lot of money, and bought a lot of advertising saying that saturated fat is bad for you and margarine and shortening are good.  They even bribed organizations like the american heart association to endorse margarine despite the overwhelming evidence that it causes heart disease."

The study does, but the increase in IQ does not.  Welcome to the point.

>and other studies have measured or calculated IQ scores going back to the 19th century.

We don't have measured IQs from the 19th century.  Guessing is not evidence."

Read your link.

>The rise in IQ has been observed throughout the 20th century

We didn't even observe throughout the 20th century.  Again, read your link, the effect has been observed since the 1940s, and has reversed in many areas since then.  There is no speculation about before that."

natureismetal,fdb4blq,t1_fd96g0g,1578253615.0,">Global IQ continually and steadily rises, and has done for over a century. It is called the Flynn Effect.

Maybe you should read your link first before posting nonsense.  The Flynn effect only goes back to the late 40s, is only in some countries not globally, and has been going the other direction in several countries."
