Not one of those links discussed restaurant dishwashers.

I have over a decade in the restaurant industry (US).  The industrial dishwashers drain out the bottom straight into the floor drain *multiple times* per load, and NEVER recycle water.  They use high pressure spray of water at least 200*F and three (3) chemicals for cleaning and sanitizing, draining between and after each.  They come out too hot to touch. And at no point does that water that drains out recycle back into the washer."

Racism is racism no matter who it is directed at, no matter who is doing the directing.  When you separate and make judgements based on people’s race, that is racism.  What you are referring to is institutionalized discrimination, and yes it is a major issue, but do not make the mistake of incorporating it into your definition of racism, because then you yourself become part of the problem."

AmItheAsshole,fey54op,t1_fesfsmb,1579440916.0,"Feeding someone a completely normal meal that they enjoy is not comparable to the “food bully” shit you’re talking about.  It’s not tongue or raw meat or anything dangerous or disgusting, it’s fucking mushrooms which she couldn’t even tell were in there. She needs to drop the victim act, and you need to stop calling people bullies and start calling them out for their dangerous serving habits. If something is not handled properly that’s one things, it’s dangerous and should not be consumed; if someone enjoys a meal and later finds out something they have *chosen* to avoid was in there, they need to take a step out of their own ass and realize maybe they should stop making people pander to them so they feel special and important.

Throwing around the wood bully cheapens it, not everyone who disagrees with you is a bully. The people you’re referring to here aren’t bullies, they’re *dangerously negligent* in the food handling and if they make someone sick can be charged in most developed countries, that’s not bullying that’s criminal."
AmItheAsshole,fey32o4,t1_fesfk8s,1579440114.0,"Obviously she doesn’t mind them that much if she didn’t even know they were in there until *someone else* asked, it’s not like he fed her something she’s allergic to or snuck meat into a vegan’s food. A lot of people overdramatize their “hatred” of foods for attention, and people are allowed to get sick of tiptoeing around their self-imposed dietary restrictions; If she wasn’t able to eat the meal b/c of them that’d be one thing but she didn’t even notice!
