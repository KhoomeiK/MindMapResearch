Uppababy is ridiculously expensive, but when you think about the per-use price, it’s not that bad considering they can last for many years and children. The Minu is nothing short of awesome engineering and I’ll probably sell my Vista soon to get one for my 2 year old. The stroller in this video is a Vista which is the tank of Uppababy strollers."

Once you’ve watched most of the major dozen or so several times over, you begin to notice that they frequently use the same shots, spliced together to tell drastically different stories. Two animals getting frisky with each other, for instance, will be courting in one documentary, but having a territorial dispute in another."
news,fgi2glx,t1_fgi1xvc,1580802464.0,"Dude, what? This is all so bizarre. I’ve never had someone tell me where I haven’t been before. Do you believe that you can see people’s past based on their cell phone service? 

I graduated from the U of U. I lived in Utah for 6 years and travel there at least once a quarter for business. I lived in Boulder for 2. I’ve been an avid skier and snowboarder for my whole life. I own a cabin in Brighton, UT and have dozens of friends with cabins up and down the wasatch, Unitas and Rockies. 

This has gone so far beyond weird. Sorry your cell service has sucked and mine hasn’t, but.. I’m going to draw a line under this very strange conversation now. Have a good night."
news,fgi1uq4,t1_fgi19hc,1580801711.0,"So, based on your post history, you seem to be nearly homeless, unemployed, possibly living in your car and struggling to connect with people due to being on the spectrum. I’m seriously not going to bully you about that. It sounds like a shitty situation and I’m sorry you’re going through that. I hope things get better for you soon. But this is one of those moments where a person not on the spectrum can help guide you through a clearly rather obsessive processing difficulty you’re experiencing. 

But really. Seriously. Listen carefully here: 
I promise you that my excellent new cell phone and brand new car that can drive it’s own self, for fucks’s sake, has never dropped below 3G on any road to the vast majority of major and many minor ski resort in UT or CO within the last few years. 

I promise you that my awesome technology gets service. I’m sorry that you have not had the privilege of experiencing the same. I know I am incredibly lucky to have cool gadgets that can connect with ease. But normal people don’t lie about such weird things, and it’s not normal to basically hound someone into telling you that they’re lying when they’re not. 

I’m not lying. That would be a really weird thing to do for literally no reason. Let it go."
