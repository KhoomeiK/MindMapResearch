socialanxiety,fdj9ckh,t1_fdi8tu4,1578462232.0,"For most of my life, I experienced social anxiety (avoidance, feeling weird and awkward around others, people pleaser, feeling like I’m boring, feeling like I’m missing out on life, comparing myself to others, eye contact, feeling panicky in social situations)

Thanks to tapping, I’ve been able to reduce SA to the point that it’s no longer a real problem in my life. I now feel calm and relaxed in social situations and just feel more confident and comfortable. It’s awesome!

In regards to the time it took me:

Basically, one night I had a breakthrough tapping session with myself that greatly reduced the majority of my social anxiety. It was as if i flipped a switch in regards to how instant it felt. Out of all the things I tried, EFT tapping was the only one that worked.

With that said, I was introduced to tapping over five years ago and only recently saw huge results. 

But that’s only because I wasn’t doing it effectively. 

I recommend checking out that website and the recorded live webinars. There’s a lot more to it than just tapping on your body’s meridian points and repeating phrases. Your Social anxiety is most likely very complex and you are probably subconsciously resistant to letting it go."
