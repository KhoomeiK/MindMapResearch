TeamfightTactics,ffcr2yp,t1_ffcoqtk,1579805501.0,"Had a rather bad start and inted before a carousel to get a spat (which I did in the carousel after the one I inted for). Got the 6 berzerker trait in stage 4 and started to break the lose streak. Then I rolled a 2\* Olaf and started win streaking. Haven't lost HP until 3 players were left and the final battle was against a 4 Cloud, 4 Blademaster comp. The other player also had a Zephyr, so I had to reposition Olaf each round. That I hit 3\* Olaf was quite lucky and probably the key to win. Honestly, I even lost a round in the final battle although Olaf wasn't hit by Zephyr, so it was closer than you'd think when you see a 3\* version of him.

Overall the team was solid so I think Poison Zerkers are still S-Tier."

TeamfightTactics,ffc6u1h,t3_esui87,1579792888.0,"For those wondering why I had 9 units in the end, the last carousel had a FoN. Tried to roll for a Glacial Lux to round up the insane highroll of this game.

The screen was taken before the carousel as you can see."
TeamfightTactics,ff99uky,t1_ff9604p,1579708144.0,"No that's not the point of the post. The point is that many players blame luck to be in charge 100% when they lose. ""Didn't roll the units I wanted, fuck RNG!!""

Meanwhile 2-3 players run comps that utilize these units and thus the chance to roll them is very low (maybe even non existent based on how many copies of them are already bought).

While the game is based on luck, it's also based on calculations. If you perfectly utilize what you get, you'd be challenger #1 in no time although the game is based on luck. That's because when you calculate the chances (and have in mind what's strong and what's weak), the chance that you're going to win is higher than if you just head into one comp, completely blind (no scouting, no thoughts about what items you're able to craft, etc.) and pray that it works."
civ,ff994hi,t1_ff92iwe,1579707688.0,"Then they'd need to get rid of the whole era system, as you said what would be the middle age of china? Either that or every civ would have their own eras based on their own timeline but still uses a combined tech tree. Tho that would be too complicated.

I understand your point now that you've mentioned the eurocentrism but I don't think they'd be able to shorten the current era system by a lot.

Whatever they do, smoother transitions between the eras would still be nice."
civ,ff8mddk,t1_ff6n96y,1579685691.0,"Then limit the era system to each civ. Tho if you want their historical accurate eras that also means that the devs would have to form the future of some civs that never reached later eras and each civ would have it's own tech tree.

If you limit the eras to each civ based on their history then it wouldn't make sense that the aztecs build infantry at some point, as some tribes nowadays still hunt with spears they probably wouldn't be way more advanced either. Even if they'd advance who says that they'd also have infantry at some point? They may know how to craft guns but that doesn't mean that their units would be the same because they may wouldn't be part of world war one/two, which the infantry is part of. Who'd say that their infantry counterpart would be as effective?

Imo if you limit the era system to each civ AND take into account the historical accuracy, the game would be hella unbalanced.

If you only limit the era system to each civ without limiting it to the historical accuracy, you could still add more eras to grant smoother transitions."

A great AI should be able to compete with you the whole time without having any modifiers, a great AI should be able to somewhat play like a human. Other games were able to accomplish this without modifiers and only the best are able to beat them, so there's definitely a change needed. You can't just deny that the modifiers are a cheap way of making the AI ""better"" and thus are ok because they are hard to develop. These modifiers wouldn't be needed when the AI was coded better.

I say this one more time, it's great for you if you're able to beat the AI with the biggest modifiers but that doesn't mean that these modifiers aren't ridiculous and should be replaced with better coding.

If you still keep saying that they aren't because it's hard to develop AI and good players can still beat them then I see no point in continuing this discussion."

You usually add Thresh and Naut but those two aren't enough frontline, could add Malph on lvl 9 but even then your frontline melts usually (assuming that others are lvl 8/9 and their comps aren't weak). In addition to Mystic being an origin that isn't too hard to add to your comps, 6 mages don't have much to offer. Unless you're highrolling like there is no tomorrow.

Early 6 mage can be powerful in mid game but I'd rather transition into 4 Warden later on."

TeamfightTactics,fcmorde,t1_fclvq11,1577784729.0,"Aside Woodland Druid they're still one of the strongest pivot comps. You can use them and pivot into many variations of Glacial, Poison, Crystal, Inferno, Berzerker, Ranger, etc. They aren't really able to compete in late game anymore but they never should anyway. Tho if you highroll you can still keep them late, for example if you roll a crystal Lux for 4 Crystal and have glacial as well. At least I've seen some really strong comps utilizing even preds in late. I really don't know why you think that preds were nerfed too hard, the only thing that has been nerfed is hyperroll posion preds but tbh that was needed, like the eggroll nerf."
