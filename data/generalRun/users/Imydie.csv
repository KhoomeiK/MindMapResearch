However some ways  to reduce the amount of babies being forced into the world  (so that every kid that’s born will actually have stable loving parents)  would be that every parent that want to have kids must go through rigorous tests to prove they Can be a stable, caring parent. We can make it mandatory to have a license in order to have kids. 

Some other laws we could enforce are 1 child/2child policies, can only be eligible to procreate if ur financially stable, etc."

Honestly, looking through this thread makes me lose hope for humanity. No one is condemning the selfish mother for forcing this child into this horrible life. Everyone is making joyful happy comments as if this kid isn’t going to have an extremely, extremely hard life.

For some time he will need help? No, unless he magically grows limbs, he will need help until the day he dies, that’s a fact. 

Put yourself in his shoes for one minute. I’m assuming u have all 4 working limbs so the closest thing would be, if u got into a horrible accident tomorrow & suddenly became a quadriplegic (can’t use all four of your limbs) how would u view your life? Most people (I’m pretty sure u would as well) would contemplate suicide, you’d want to end the pain.
