FloridaMan,feszfh0,t1_fesxoco,1579370447.0,"I’m sorry man. I really wasn’t trying to fight. You took a shot at my intelligence (which now that I reread was warranted, I didn’t realize at the time) so I backed myself up. I apologize for using the wrong term. And I’m sorry if I sounded condescending, but I felt like you were attacking me (I still do). It seems you are more mad about my comment and reddit and Republicans, which is fine, I knew that wouldn’t be a popular comment here. I don’t contend that I am almighty in any way, I merely wanted to point out that I study this stuff so I’m not clueless and I didn’t just “hear adults talking about it”. I simply made a typo in my initial comment. I’m not sure what “fake, made up bullshit” I was using since I meant confirmation bias, as you said. 

I hope you *do* agree that confirmation is rampant in our society. That is all I was trying to say"
FloridaMan,fesuca3,t1_fesreiu,1579369074.0,"Thank you. I never meant to start a shouting match here, I’m just passionate about free thinking and I encourage people to do it whenever possible. And believe me, I wouldn’t defend almost any congress members out there. As I said, most of them are as corrupt as can be, so I agree."
FloridaMan,fesiift,t1_feshiiz,1579365550.0,"I’m sorry, I did not reread my initial comment. I meant to write self-confirmation bias (including the word “self” to make it more obvious what I was talking about). Did not mean to write conforming, and I didn’t realize that was what you were critiquing.  My bad on that part. You win. You are correct that the initial term I used was incorrect. 

However, I do wish that you wouldn’t resort to name calling when discussing a misunderstanding. 

As for dropping out of school? No, no I don’t think I will."

AskReddit,ferqzbm,t1_fepbi9b,1579357342.0,"Number 2 all the way. Half the stuff I see in the internet is a big ol net of self confirming bias where a bubble of freakishly likeminded individuals share anecdotes about why they are so right and everyone else is wrong. Those are the people that like to compound downvote comments that aren’t even controversial. Have some self respect people, form your own opinions."

I’m not advocating for either side of this silly twitter jab battle, but I want to point out that self-conforming bias is a VERY real thing and it’s unbelievable how much that can be used to persuade you. Try your best to read everything with an actually open mind and you will be surprised"
