kansascity,ffx0bg9,t3_evnxxs,1580315004.0,I was scared and careful all last week.. thought today would be no problem. Now waiting for a tow truck with a shredded tire.
gameofthrones,ffwk9t4,t1_ffwjs9n,1580303707.0,Also I would imagine after her brain hemmorages that she also could have meant it literally.. like I knew you'd notice if I'm acting funny and call 911.
leaf,ffunca5,t3_ev6vlj,1580245584.0,"I keep seeing conflicting stuff about the warranty..
I have a 2015 SL.. it has not lost any bars yet but is around 35k miles..

If I lost 4 bars by 2023 would they replace the battery?
I know the 8 year/4 bars was a thing back in 2011 but I had thought it changed."
OutOfTheLoop,fftbc5u,t1_ffs6zvy,1580215286.0,"That's a bit disappointing.. 
I wonder what justification he has for not supporting her?"
awesome,fftahr2,t1_ffsvsae,1580214429.0,They are so cute (to me) and yet when you look at each individual piece.. the eyes.. the claws.. they should be fucking terrifying.
gaming,ffsna00,t1_ffscod7,1580186095.0,My first thought was someone like a neo-nazi taking this as justification that they are right.. since everyone is against them.
dogs,ffpdlid,t1_ffoybwo,1580092394.0,"Ugh, technically mine are often nightmares too.
I dream that I ""forgot"" about my previous dog somewhere instead of putting her down, find she is still alive but has been alone or abandoned all this time.. then find out she is still sick and has probably been suffering too.

So I'm glad I haven't had THAT dream about my boy..  but .. maybe I'm kind of messed up.. even though they are often nightmares, they still make me feel like I ""saw"" them, and that's nice?"
dogs,ffpdawk,t1_ffp3id7,1580092182.0,"Oh sorry, you did not upset me! :)
I was just trying to clarify that I don't think there is some deep spiritual meaning to dreams or anything."
dogs,ffo1s33,t1_ffnz5rm,1580073281.0,"Aw I am so sorry :( 

I miss petting/playing with an animal, but I do feel heart-achey when I think about another dog using his crate or his backyard.."
dogs,ffo13tj,t1_ffo0206,1580073048.0,"Yeah.. I don't normally tend to try to find meaning in my dreams - I often have epic fantasy story dreams about other worlds and people I don't know, and that doesn't seem to correlate to anything in my life.. it's just a quirky thing my brain does. 

And I would never want to think that my dreaming about lost people coming back means they aren't at peace somehow.. that would be sad.. 
But it's just weird to me, for the dreams to NOT be there. Since they always have been before. 

Heck, I dreamed about him often when he was alive."
geek,fflskqx,t1_ffk8jaf,1580043610.0,"I once did a study and presentation for preschool teachers about gender issues in early childhood and legos were one of my examples of how toys have transitioned from being genderless and open ended, sparking creativity,  into role specific and imagination stifling :( 

It hurts kids development in multiple ways, not just the gender stereotyping."
gifs,ff6v8s3,t3_erunww,1579635582.0,It looks like the legos are moving around on their own and she is just filming them while they film.
offbeat,ff50r4o,t1_ff4wwdh,1579577138.0,"Some of these freaks think the dogs ""consent"" and share romantic love with them.
I guess thinking a dog is sentient enough to have a consensual relationship with you is not necessarily at odds with vegan ideals. 

Fuckin sick though."
Dogtraining,fepn9ts,t1_fepfz0a,1579325065.0,"Ugh!
That makes me so mad. Some selfish person made your dog (and you) suffer and cost a TON of money and time that goes into training those amazing animals."
Dogtraining,feo66o0,t1_fenu9bn,1579295653.0,"What scares me most about these people who are using ""service animal"" labels to get their untrained pet into restricted places.. is that its putting actual service animals and their people at risk.

Not only is that dog behaving rudely to people, he will behave rudely to actual service animals he encounters.. who are actually in work mode, and therefore not ""allowed"" to correct the interloper. 
Service dogs could be attacked by these animals. And then people (especially the blind) who are relying on them are left vulnerable."
AskReddit,fenrryv,t3_eq1wzh,1579289824.0,"Suddenly be at ideal weight (healthily, not from cancer or something) and have a million dollars so I can freely take care of my family."
todayilearned,feem6wo,t1_feejfu5,1579036575.0,"It's just the high level of fascination this generation has which seems odd, I think.
Yeah we got slime out of coin machines, and bought gak or floam in the toy aisle..  but it was always like an impulse buy that you play with for five minutes and would end up in the trash within a few days. 
I don't remember anyone bragging about their slime collection and it never would have gone on a christmas list heh."
Dogtraining,fee9hxx,t1_fedipep,1579029171.0,That's amazing.
Dogtraining,fedhzi8,t3_eohzth,1579012014.0,"No sound? 

I'm curious how you released them. Did you say their name before or after the release word?  

I love how that last dog (tan and black) started to go and then caught itself realizing the command was for someone else."
AskReddit,feb6xui,t3_eo83cx,1578955979.0,"If the trans person is pre-op, they should definitely always disclose beforehand.. it'd be cruel to both parties not too. 

But if post op, it completely depends on the situation. Just follow the same ground rules as a cis person.

One night stand? No, you should not be ""required"" to reveal something you've changed about yourself and do not identify with any longer. A cis person wouldn't tell everyone they meet about their nose job. 

But if you're going for a serious relationship.. well yeah you should reveal for the sake of the foundation of trust, and because your party gets to decide their own deal breakers. 
 Again, that also applies to cis people with fertility issues or anything genetic that could have an effect on your life choices together."
movies,fe8fp79,t1_fe6r0ub,1578925658.0,"I LOVE Robert Downey Jr but I feel like he was a poor choice for this particular role. I also loved the original 1967 movie, and it seems they are going for a completely different feel on this one.. so there is no nostalgia factor to draw on. 
From the previews his characterization looks too similar to RJD's sherlock. Which again I enjoyed, but this is supposed to be different. 
It's hard to pin down what I'm trying to say but everything about it looks/feels wrong for what Dr Doolittle is."
interestingasfuck,fe3381s,t1_fe2u9d5,1578845503.0,You realize the orangutan probably came over BECAUSE of her?
AdviceAnimals,fdwky8y,t1_fdw4uqy,1578759801.0,"Yeah I'm always confused by people who ""fall"" into affairs or ""cant control"" themselves. 
I had a rough patch with my bf and sometimes met other interesting people who gave me a brief thought of ""it might be better with someone like him"".  You can't control those random thoughts. But you can absolutely control what you do with them. I never went beyond a passing thought.

I can't even cheat in my dreams. Everytime a random dream with a fictional romantic interest starts heading that way I'm suddenly lucid and going ""wait, hold up, where is my bf.. """
dogs,fdwiqrx,t1_fdw674f,1578759062.0,"Right? As someone who just recently had to let go of their 14 year old dog..  ugh.  How could they. 
I missed his younger days but I would have given anything to have another year with him old."
personalfinance,fdqiswt,t1_fdqh2af,1578667711.0,"I had so many family members that kept dogs around like this.. fat, blind, insulin dependent, have to be carried outside .. just because you have the money to keep them alive doesn't mean you should.

&#x200B;

Both times I've had to let a dog go, I would have gladly done anything to keep them.. except leave them miserable."
gifs,fdnl5d9,t3_em1rs9,1578588089.0,Is that a basset hound? I dont think I've ever seen a black one
WTF,fdlli1i,t3_elxsia,1578526724.0,I.. want this..
AskReddit,fdfmyxg,t3_el2az5,1578365434.0,"Um.. I watched 'You'.
I don't know how to feel here. I mean, I would defintely not cry about sexing up Penn Badgley. 
But then I have to be the absolutely most perfect girlfriend or he's gonna kill me. And even if I'm perfect he's probably going to kill people around me for various reasons. 
Is that worth 600k?  Shit. 

Last show before that was Anne with an E. I like red heads but I'm gonna have to bow out on the 17 yr old girl aspect."
AskReddit,fddpxe3,t3_ekt5n3,1578320805.0,"I am not sure. I have this nightmare all the time.. in my nightmare, I try to call and say I am on my way.. but then I either ""fall asleep"" again or something else prevents me from getting there, and I keep realizing I am later and later.. 

God I hope it never actually happens."
entertainment,fcv9yf9,t1_fcv79wk,1577997717.0,"On the other hand.. its social media that is finally stopping people like Weinstein. He has been a predator for ages, but it cannot be swept under the rug anymore."
Dogtraining,fcuswz0,t3_eizae5,1577987863.0,"I also support the idea that it sounds like it could be back or hip pain.

My big dog had arthritis and started refusing to sit around 8 or 9 as well, though he did not have the issues with going outside. 
He was very well trained and eager to please but I noticed him trying to briefly 'squat' instead of actually sitting, and then it progressed to him giving me a pleading look instead of sitting.  At that time in his life he did not limp, he still liked to jump and run, the reluctant sitting was the very first noticeable sign I had."
AskReddit,fcoqpgz,t3_ei4bkv,1577839011.0,"Oh gosh, what did we watch last night..
Mrs Maisel.. and ..I wanted to watch Lost in Space but we didn't  have time. 
Oh, we wat had V Wars instead. V Wars was last. 

I would have been golden with the Lost in Space crew, damnit.
I'm not sure about the V Wars guy. Only like 3 or 4 episodes in but he does not seem to be saving anyone.

Might have been better off stopping at Mrs Maisel."
Unexpected,fc6gujz,t1_fc5zbuo,1577480261.0,"Just fyi.. I got spanked when I was little, and even slapped for something when I was a teen. 
But I never, ever felt terrified just hearing my parents call my name. 

Even if they called my name in an ""angry"" tone, it would never be my first instinct to cringe like a dog expecting to be kicked.  It would never be my assumption that I was going to be hit when I didn't even know what I had done.  
I would have responded to a situation like this one with bewilderment and some curiousity. Not fear. 

My parents loved me, and also disciplined me fairly, and I was never afraid of them.
This boy is scared."
