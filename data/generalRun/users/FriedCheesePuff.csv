Exactly. That's why we see rape as worse. Because for a long time it wasn't seen as something ""wrong."" People are still fearful of telling people about it because some people react harshly towards that person and think of the victim as weak. People are assholes.

""Girls require protecting""

Somewhat yes... mostly women are seen as objects and accessories for men rather than getting certain human rights. Men didnt see rape as a problem for a while because it was happening to women and didnt quite frankly care enough to do something or ""protect"" the women."

No one is pushing it on children. That's not what OP has a problem with. They think that because someone is under 21 and dont have the full legal rights of an adult, they shouldn't be able to make a decision about their lives. So a kid can die for their country before they can drink a beer? So they have to live with potentially crippling dysphoria, depression, bullying, and/or anxiety for anywhere from age 5 to age 21? Kids should be able to make life changing decision that are made for the sake of their happiness and well being."

I didnt hit 100 lbs until puberty in sophomore year. I want to cut certain things out of my diet, but at the same time I'm an athlete with a high metabolism, so I need to eat a lot. I also have ADHD so I tend to eat fast food a lot bc it's quick and I wont forget about it or get bored in 10 minutes. I want to cut fastfood out, I want to cut sodas out, and I want to cut spicy food out. Only one of those is reasonable with my lifestyle. 

I've had GERD for the past 10 years, and no one decided to tell me until a year ago. I could have cut a lot out of my diet when I was 13 or 14 and gotten used to that lifestyle by now. But now I'm a college student with zero free time or will to change. 

I tell people I want to diet and cut foods out, and they look at me like I'm insane."

Just do whatever makes you happy. If being more feminine one day makes you happy? Do it. If being more masculine then next makes you happy? Do it.
