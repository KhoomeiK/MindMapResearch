In doing so he re-ignited a dying industry and has led an entire political movement.

You just need to be smart and NEVER admit that you know why they pulled you over or provide any details that they do not directly ask, but there is no reason to get all defensive and standoffish if they simply ask something like ""where are you headed?"" 

A few years ago I was going 16mph over the speed limit which is considered reckless driving in my state. State police officer pulled me over and asked if I knew why. I said no (of course I knew why). He said I was going 66 in a 50. I said I am very sorry. He asked where I was headed and I explained to him that I was on my way to class to take my final exam and was worried I about being late (which was true). He asked what I was studying, I told him my aspirations, he said ""Good for you. I am going to write you a warning so that you have something to show your professor why you were late."" So I basically went from getting several points on my driving record to getting an excused late pass just by being nice and upfront with him.

cringe,fgkkq3b,t1_fgft19i,1580867822.0,"> What do you think happens to wealth nowadays? Do you think people are actually being paid what their labor is actually worth

Wage/salary is a mutual agreement among employer and employee. It has little to do with what their labor is actually worth because that is almost impossible to measure. However, employees are free to seek a higher paying job if they feel that they are being paid too little. Thousands of companies each year fail because they cannot find good enough employees because they do not offer their employees enough money. Thus, companies are bound to the will of their employees just as they are bound to the wills of the consumers.

> After a point, the consumers are bound to the price points of producers, because a top percentage of the population can choose to drive up prices, while the vast majority of the population cannot pay them.

This is false and shows that you do not understand the basic principles of how prices work. A producer will sell more good at a lower price and less goods at a higher price. The top percentage of a population does not ""choose to drive up prices"". You are intentionally ignoring that there will still always be a larger percentage of a population that will drive prices down. A producer of, lets say, toilet paper cannot charge $50 per roll just because everyone wants/needs it and 1% of the population can afford that price. They will fail as a business because another company will provide toilet paper at a price that 99% of the population can afford. Once again, producers are bound to the collective will of the consumer.

> A socialist government redistributes wealth to make society more equitable

""Equitable"" sounds nice and is a buzz word that politicians often tell to the economically illiterate in order to win their votes. The implication is that ""equitable"" = fairness, when in practice it is the opposite that is true. In capitalism, fairness is implicit. A producer provides a good or service, and the consumer pays a price that they agree to (if the consumer cannot afford the price that the producer offers, then the producer loses that persons business). That is completely fair. In the case of the consumer, you pay for what you get. In the case of the producer, you earn based on the desirability of the product that you produce. The more desirable of a product that a producer can provide at an agreeable price, the more money that the producer earns. This wealth that is CREATED by the ingenuity of the producer. 

THIS is redistribution of wealth the fair way. Every time I buy something I am redistributing some of my wealth towards a product that I desire more than that amount of my wealth. Even with things that I don't necessarily get excited about buying like home insurance, I am doing so because I value that insurance more than I value the dollars that I spend on it. 

The socialist way is to confiscate wealth from those who create it and then distribute it to those who don't. This is not equity. This is robbery. It is tyranny. It is unjust."

The producers are bound to the will of the consumers, otherwise they cannot profit. 

Socialism on the other hand, the government takes from the producers and tries to create services that the government believes will serve the will of the people. It is not voluntary. You go to jail if you do not comply, or suffer much worse consequences that we have seen throughout history. And the government has no way of knowing what the collective will of the people is because no price system is in place to tell them the demand for a particular good/service.

From what I can gather, it sounds like you live in a multi-unit complex and have at least one roomate that could only get into the locked room from your window (correct me if I am wrong). With that said, there is probably not really much that you can do legally. At least not anything that will be worth it. If you owned the room then that would be a different story, but it sounds like you are leasing the whole space and that one room has been designated as yours outside of the lease. Unless you have it written down somewhere that the bedroom is your own personal real property then there is really not much of a case that you can make.

McDonald's has stepped their game up big time in the past five years while Subway is doing the opposite. The only thing Subway has going for it is that they have so many locations, and McDonald's is king when it comes to managing thousands of locations. They could buy Subway for cheap and turn it around quickly by giving it some better marketing/branding and make the restaurants and food actually look appealing."

The reason he is such a good goal scorer is because he is a sharp shooter and puts so much energy and strength into getting the puck to the net. [This graph is my favorite](https://i.imgur.com/dWl255W.jpg). He is so damn good at shooting, but that doesn't really work in a 1 on 1 shootout situation."

Even the rednecks in my southern town that have never been into hockey were going nuts about it. Caps being my local team, Oshie was the only player signed in recent memory that I can remember where everyone knew him before he got here. He was “the shootout guy”. 

Of course, Gary Bettman made it his mission to ruin Olympic hockey the next time around, pissing off every player and fan in the process."

It is very very unlikely to happen because 67% of senators would have to vote against him, and a majority of senators are currently in his party. The vocal minority says that there is plenty of evidence to remove him from office, but a few people from Democratic Party and the entire Republican Party have voted against impeachment."

InterdimensionalCable,fevk6s9,t1_fetrxhm,1579398347.0,"So I read through the entire thread and it is a blatantly obvious hit piece that basically only says that WK is a libertarian who likes to hang out with other libertarians so therefore he is bad. It goes as far as to say that WK had a friend that was once in a band, and that that band was once praised by a white supremacist. How that has anything to do with WK's views on race is beyond me. 

BTW, you completely lied about the only actual white supremacist mentioned in your post, Richard Spencer. WK has not defended Richard Spencer repeatedly. All WK did was publish an article in a magazine where Spencer was at one time an editor. That doesn't make WK a white supremacist. 

I don't even really like WK's music, but I despise it when people lie like this to try and make everyone with left of center views as some kind of awful person."
