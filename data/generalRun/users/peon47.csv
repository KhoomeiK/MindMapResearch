My players really liked it. I went into gross detail about the flies covered its face, so thick it ended up looking like the Tar alien that killed Tasha Yar."

Most of the time, it's improvising in real time as your players don't kill the assassin sent to kill them, but instead catch them and cast zone of truth to find out who he works for so you have to desperately scramble to make up NPC names on the fly."
DndAdventureWriter,fgtvzfc,t3_f0ggye,1581110129.0,"You need a setting and NPCs. 

Maybe your story is about an evil cult that wants to resurrect Tiamat.

The setting is the world, and the history of how Tiamat died. SDIT: It also includes events caused by nature like incoming meteors or earthquakes. Stuff that is beyond anyone's control.

The NPCs need qualities and goals. This guy is lazy (quality) and wants to run a quiet tavern (goal). This guy is evil and smart and merciless (quality) and wants to resurrect Tiamat (goal). This dead dragon god is evil (quality) as me wants to be resurrected amd destroy the world (goal). These can be as detailed as you want. Major NPCs should have a lot of qualities and detailed nuanced goals.

What you do **not** write is events. They happen ""organically"" from the setting and NPC and PC actions. 

You don't write ""the cult kidnaps the mayor's daughter"". You write ""the cult need a sacrifice so their goal is to kidnap the mayor's daughter"". Then they will succeed or not based on their qualities - how competent they are - and the players' actions.

A well-written campaign is one where the players can derail any part of it and it's still a fun and interesting experience no matter where it ends up."

politics,fgs0v8t,t1_fgr360p,1581065839.0,Which is a huge mistake for them. Any debate about whether to recall Romney is just going to be a debate about whether he was right to vote to convict Trump or not. They're just going to re-litigate the impeachment trial all over again and extend it in the court of public opinion and the media.
AskReddit,fgrc356,t1_fgrbafn,1581043174.0,"You said ""sixty"". I've watched the Obama footage and the word ""sixty"" never crossed his lips.

But fine. I'll give you a one time pass and address the point you were trying to make as if you weren't deliberately misrepresenting the facts.

In April of 2016, President Trump referred to the 9/11 attacks as the 7-eleven attacks. When called out on it, his supporters pointed out that Obama once said 57 instead of 47. So that one is used up now. You burned the one-time mis-speak that we allow presidents. You can't use Obama's one-time gaffe to excuse Trump's monthly word salad.

If you try and find a second Obama gaffe, I guarantee you I can list three more Trump ones for each one without even having to google.

Trump is a moron.

You replied to me with something completely unrelated.

And my ""nonpartisan ass""? So you're going from whataboutism to ad hominem attacks. My ass, partisan or non- is also unrelated to the fact that one of Romney's major policy initiatives would have significantly enriched one of his cronies to no other purpose. The Navy has *less* ships now than it did a hundred years ago, but those ships are each fifty times more powerful than anything even dreamed of back then. The U.S. Navy is stronger now than it ever was.
