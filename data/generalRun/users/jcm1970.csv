If the concern is that Russia or China or some other superpower could eventually place a weapon in space that orbits directly above the USA 24/7, then I think it's a reasonable response to militarize space for our protection.  The other side of that coin is that we could simply establish a treaty to keep space a completely neutral zone, like Antarctica.

She's just a kid being fed bullshit by other people who are full of shit.  It's too bad for her, because yes people are going to be annoyed by her - as I kinda am.  Shame on the people who are pushing her to be the voice of the many.  She doesn't speak for the people who can actually effect a change today.  She speaks for a generation who may hopefully remember every day how they can effect change in the future - teenagers.  And in all honesty, I don't give a shit about the thoughts of some pimple faced kid who says he/she wants to be an eco warrior from the desk of their comfy warm home, using their manufactured computer and internet, while they microwave hotpockets and drink mountain dew.  I'd be alot more willing to entertain the ideas of someone who lives off grid, grows their own food and has a carbon footprint that I produce in a few days.  People who are enjoying all of the luxuries of the modern world while bitching about how they got those luxuries need to shut the fuck up and simply do their own part without bitching, complaining and telling everyone else about it.  She's probably a great kid.  She needs to concentrate on her education, though.  Not mine."
worldnews,ffrjzxl,t1_ffr93di,1580159589.0,"Ya she has a plan.  We should all go solar and that can happen immediately - with funding from the corporations and shareholders that the GT fan club loves to hate.  I say it can happen immediately because all we have to do is build shit tons of solar panel production factories in every major town all over the world.  Obviously local production is a must so that we don't have to ship them in from China, load them onto trains, and then ship them via semi truck.  Should be easy to plunk down a factory...  And we can build them out of sticks - wait no, that's wood.  We don't want to contribute to deforestation.  We can 3D print them - wait no, that's plastic (petroleum product).  We'll just stick with traditional concrete and metal.  That's alot of rebar, but fuck it.  We can just plop down rebar factories everywhere because as long as we're dropping solar panels all over it won't be an issue.  Since we'll be starting a trend to disrupt the global supply chain, we may as well take it further and stop importing clothing and food and basic necessities.  You can sew, right?  I mean I've been making my own toothpaste for years, so I don't stores or trade.  I'll just go out into the backyard of my neighborhood where I can't raise chickens and grow turnips while my wife does the laundry in a bucket.  I mean, considering my wife's job is in shipping and mine is working with chemicals, we'll both be unemployed and have to give up our home, but fuck it - if GT thinks it's the best plan, let's all get on board.  Who cares that half of the world's population will die from starvation within a month.  They be sitting in the dark with no news of the outside world any.  We don't need any electricity that's not solar.  We don't have to ship shit.  We don't need anything that keeps us alive today since very, very few of us wouldn't know how to survive living like people did 200 years ago.  As long as GT demands compliance so she can satisfy dumbasses who think the world is on fire, it sounds like a good plan to me."
worldnews,ffqxp2n,t1_ffquarv,1580145988.0,"I'll add some context for you:

1.  The world isn't on fire, so don't be a dramatic little girl about it.
2.  Look in the pic, it's full of people wearing hats and gloves and jackets that probably weren't produced in their home countries, which means those items they bought are part of the global supply chain which uses shit tons of dirty energy.  Don't let that bother you, though since it doesn't fit into your narrative about how brilliant she is and how she's the most amazing eco-warrior on the planet.  That big sign she's holding sure does look a lot like a piece of wood or some other thick material that's also been completely painted over.  Is today's paint made with natural products?  NOPE!  If that's a piece of wood, it's plywood, which involves a heavy amount of manufacturing using trees, chemical glue, steam pressing (energy intensive) and shipping.  Don't let that bother you, though.  What is she doing for food while she's in Davos?  Is she living off the land, eating bugs and drinking rainwater?  Or is she enjoying the fact that we have a market that delivers food to hungry people all over the world?

television,ffigbjp,t1_ffietmv,1579973192.0,"But...   do you think Luka would have stepped out to give his own name and start that little game if those people hadn’t begun hunting for him?  He said it in the letter he wrote when he said how fun it was to watch people chase him and come up with nothing because he was always one step ahead.  He wasn’t though - not always. They got a step ahead of him. This is clear and undeniable.  
LEA’s failed to act until a person was killed.  They didn’t care about cats.  This is also clear.  Back to the main point though, there’s no reason at all to believe that if the internet gang hadn’t started their search that he would have started posting more identifying material or anything that would have led to him revealing himself.  It was his narcissism/ego that led to his downfall and I firmly believe that however petty it was in the beginning for BM and John to feed his ego and make him a priority in their lives, they still knew who he was, what he was up to, and what was going to happen well before the police.  Would he have escalated without their involvement?  I feel he would have.  Did he make a major fuck up by leaving his ID and other info in a bag near the crime scene?  Indeed he did.  But considering his ego, he may have done that on purpose because of the cat/mouse game he was playing.  That may not have been an accident at all.  So that takes me back to his desire to leave a trail and encourage people to follow - which is exactly what the internet gang did.  I just think their actions played a significantly more valuable role than people want to admit."
television,ffiaftu,t1_ffg0wll,1579969187.0,"I really don't understand how you can feel they did literally nothing.  Unless what you mean by literally nothing, you mean, lure the guy out of to show himself as a real person, contact the Canadian police and Interpol, and provide a pretty decent amount of evidence to help convict the guy.  Granted, the police found a garbage bag full of shit leading to Luka, the internet group already knew his name and already knew he was escalating and already contact several LEA's, and were completely ignored.  So I'm kinda puzzled by what you mean.  I also think if one single LEA person would have confronted this kid earlier on, an innocent mans life might have been saved.  We'll never know.  In my opinion though, it's dismissive of you to say the internet gang didn't do shit.  They identified a killer well before he actually killed a person.  How did you possibly miss that?  Or did you not really watch the show for comprehension?"

He was playing with the internet gang because he thought he was completely anonymous.  Because he was giving up so much information to them, he became findable.  The point of the show was not - look who found the guy.  The point was - the internet is not your safe space where you can be anyone you want and hide forever."

I'll tell you what everyone of them told me about dealing with the po.  They said they would cut the vine just as other described - remove a large chunk.  Then they would wait a year to come back and deal with the vines.  One year...!!  You can spray them with Glyphosate, but that's not going to dry the sap out of the entire vine.  Killing the vine doesn't dry the vine.  The vine dries over time.  If you're going to tackle it, get you one of those painters suits and gear up like you're going into a hazmat scene, rip that shit out, bag it and curb it, then walk away.  Don't burn anything and don't touch yourself until you've washed your hands and tools thoroughly in soapy water with a little bleach.

Could have been the same story on a host of shows and it wouldn't have changed anything.  In my opinion, S2 was a little weak.  In S3, the mystery was driven by the characters projections, so to us viewers the big reveal was a let down because there was no big mystery.  So in a nutshell, that's why we all like S1 the best.

Also Google - downside of overseeding with Rye, and see if that's something you want to endeavor in.  This is a great example of opinion over good information.  Opinion: You should overseed because I like my lawn to be green throughout Winter.  Good information:  Rye robs your soil of nutrients that Bermuda needs to bounce back in Spring and even though your lawn is supposed to be dormant in Winter, I think you should force your lawn to not be dormant because I like a green lawn and I don't care that as a noob you have no idea what the downsides are of forcing an unnatural process onto your lawn and how it will affect it's growth and health in the coming months.

TalesFromTheCustomer,feceqtv,t3_eoebz9,1578972168.0,"This is what I don’t understand:  Your third party food delivery person, ride share driver, whatever person whose job is a ‘gig’, is a person who couldn’t get a fucking job at Wally mart or Burger McWendy’s - most likely because they are careless, undependable, and lacking the basic skills to not only hold down a job, but actually perform the simple tasks to get a simple job done.  So why the fuck is anyone expecting a positive experience in dealing with these people?  Their job is to get from point A to point B. If you get that much out of the exchange, that really should be the max limit of your expectation."

The reason most prosecutors don’t want to charge the accuser in a situation like this is because they’ll catch a lot of shit from people who will say it discourages people to report their rapist. I get the argument, but it dismisses the instance where someone reports something that can’t be proven versus reporting outright lies, so it’s bullshit.  You’ll never catch me in Bell County. Fucked up police and judiciary there."

Any woman who makes up rape stories to harm another, is a piece of shit that casts doubt on EVERY other rape case being investigated and some that have even led to conviction.  As terrible, are the ones the decry rape because they just didn't like who they willingly fucked.  (See some Weinstien accusers for reference)  It's tragic that some women don't take this shit more seriously.  Imagine a situation where this girl who made this shit up has a sister that really does get raped 2 months later and the police roll in and go - 'Ya no thanks, not wasting our time.'"

Guy is in jail for something like 9 months before guy's mother realizes she has a selfie on her phone that shows guy being 70 miles away at the time girl claims she was attacked.  Prosecutor was ready to try and put him away for the max, because her word.

There is another brand available at Lowe's that is what a lot of commercial companies use.  I forget the name but it starts with Bel or Bal or something, iirc."
