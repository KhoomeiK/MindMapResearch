So what if so and so decided to skip 4 or 5 vacations because it would require flying. The reality is that the plane they would have taken will fly regardless who's on it. It doesn't matter if their seat didn't sell. It doesn't matter if 95% of the seats didn't sell. 

I saw a picture the other day on another sub of someone sitting on a plane all by themselves. They were the only occupied seat and the plane still flew. I personally have flown on a flight with only 4 other people on board.

What we need is Boeing to put their research and development into different use. Stop building bigger and more consumptive of natural resources and start evolving the technology we do have to run on safer more sustainable fuel sources. Flight is never going to go away.

That put us on the radar. Then one day a ""buddy"" of ours got pulled over with weed and instead of taking the possession charge decided to take a snitch deal (we had no idea of any of this at the time). With no one to snitch on, one day he asked my roommate if he could toss him a few bucks for a bowl to smoke later and my roommate was just like ""yeah man whatever"" and gave him like .3 for a few bucks.
