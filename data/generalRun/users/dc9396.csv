cactus,ffhfs2l,t1_ffga95q,1579933390.0,"Definitely a Mammillaria gracilis fragilis. A very common cactus, very easy to recognize. Yours is very young and may change a little with light intensity and age."
denvernuggets,ffg8w29,t3_eter0h,1579900982.0,I am from New Mexico. I watched the Lobos (college basketball) growing up because there was no NBA team. I am also a Broncos fan because my family is from Colorado. I started watching the nuggets around Melo was getting in the playoffs. I stopped watch as muchafter Melo left because I didn’t like the NBA as much as college. I started following again because I like Jokic. I’ve been to a couple games now. Great times but not as good as a close game in the Pit!
cactus,ffeefwk,t1_ffeakuo,1579844948.0,A repot in the spring might give it a growth spurt. Be careful pieces fall off easy.
cactus,ffeaeqo,t1_ffe9r3g,1579841194.0,Flowers don’t last but a few days. This is still a small plants so not as much energy from multiple blooms yet. They will get rings of flowers when mature.
cactus,ffe9j1o,t3_eszgsx,1579840436.0,It looks likes it’s reverting back to completely green in its newer growth.
cactus,ffe9c2v,t3_eszwql,1579840277.0,Too young to tell it seems to me. Looks heathy though.
cactus,ffe99f4,t3_et2zgg,1579840215.0,It all depends on what cactus it is. Personally I don’t like when it’s little things like say a saguaro grows in New Mexico. I know it’s not the exact same thing but depictions like that happen a lot. A little research into a exact species goes a long way.
succulents,ff3cwmj,t1_ff2sr4v,1579538631.0,If it is actively growing. Even if it is inside the short day lengths can make it go dormant. Once dormant my cactus pretty much get ignored from nov-mar. No water or anything just sit on a shelf.
succulents,ff2i2n3,t3_er6i4j,1579507073.0,"You want to water during their growing period. This cactus gets summer rain, so if it’s actively growing and has a good temperature it can get a lot of water. Now during the winter it can go months with very little."
cactus,fewks2n,t3_eqaypm,1579412926.0,It’s funny they have that on the morning glory seeds too.
cactus,fewkpec,t1_fepw9lz,1579412858.0,Why run 14 hrs a day? I have my indoor cactus under lights on a sunrise to sunset timer. Once mine go into winter dormancy I wouldn’t want them to have that much light.
plants,fem7h4b,t3_epvc16,1579242508.0,One of my first too.
Albuquerque,feltx8z,t1_fell56q,1579230843.0,The junk mail is delivered to the post office in big pallets. So even if you don’t get it it will still be printed. The post office gets paid to deliver them and they need the revenue.
cactus,fecagtd,t3_eoco3a,1578969577.0,How cold does it get?
haworthia,fds2ivt,t1_fdrmimg,1578693337.0,Definitely especially with some of the fast growing and pupping varieties. I’m so glad because the price is so low. I really like my obtusa variegate
haworthia,fdps39u,t1_fdpqs0b,1578638327.0,maughanii.com
cactus,fdogzo7,t3_emfvsy,1578604956.0,"It is a cacti, it would take a lot to make it too dry. My cacti go all winter with getting watered once, some shrink in half and get wrinkled much more than this."
haworthia,fdo3dch,t3_emejuu,1578598145.0,I actually order one of the Byakuya and the Milky Way from her eBay store a few days she posted the lucky bags. I order one silver and nishiki lucky bag.
plants,fdlhv38,t1_fdleby8,1578524353.0,They look like that in winter. Check them out in spring they should stand up.
plants,fdke6qt,t3_elv2ff,1578501975.0,Perhaps Euphorbia rigida. What location is it in? If it’s a cold area I would say that’s what it is.
succulents,fdk740q,t3_elu5c5,1578497587.0,"Haworthia are grown for their small size, especially the slow growing ones. Gasteria as well."
succulents,fdfp1tw,t3_el57fn,1578366803.0,I think is some kinda of Gasteraloe. It’s not a Haworthia.
haworthia,fdc2k9j,t3_ekk1ql,1578265844.0,"The small size and wide variety of leaf shapes and colors. Echeveria tend to get overgrown and only look good for a while when potted for me. When I have echeverias they always get lanky over winter. Since my Haworthia grow during the winter it’s a better fit.  I like the look of echies but basically gave up grow them in my conditions. Also since most cacti grow it the summer, my Haworthia and mesembs give me something to enjoy in the winter too."
aww,fda8og3,t3_ekdkos,1578243063.0,This is me and my cat after I go to work for 8 hours.
cats,fd7d0h3,t3_ek8nbx,1578202566.0,It’s a dominance thing. Basically the cats is saying it owns the territory by leaving the poop uncovered.
cats,fd7burh,t3_ek89ia,1578202103.0,Yes keep them separate. When I had cats that I successfully introduced it took a whole year to even been in the same room without fighting. My current is a queen and keeps me from getting more because it would be so hard.
cats,fd79zeq,t3_ek7p7u,1578201381.0,I got drops from wal mart and pick off ones I find on their ears. I use a light and a tweezers and try to keep them inside.
plants,fd3bso1,t3_ejyz5y,1578156739.0,Pothos are really hardy. I would give a drink and see.
cats,fcz9c37,t3_ejo4w9,1578096290.0,My cat has asthma so I can’t get insurance because of a pre-existing condition. I got the carecredit card and it’s works. My vet usually gives me 6 month no interest and I pay it off before. I even used it for a expensive heart test.
matureplants,fcwf5ub,t3_eiupzh,1578024050.0,"Those are agave, great find."
cats,fcueqjy,t1_fcub30t,1577979193.0,"Why would a box with a hood help? Cats like to mark their territory with their feces and like it in the open. Hooded litter boxes are not recommended by expects, especially if there’s a litter problem."
haworthia,fct1l83,t3_eirfq4,1577930506.0,"I use akadama, it is a fired clay from Japan, and I think that is what you are seeing. It is expensive but really good medium to grow in. I think most people start out with a quick draining cactus and succulent soil and then get more expensive soil later. Make sure you have completely dry roots before watering again and you should be good."
cats,fcp0afo,t3_eicncl,1577846562.0,It doesn’t sound like what happened when my cat had a UTI. My cat showed signs of pain the night before and the morning I had to rush him to the vet. It may be that you need to a litter box in the spare bedroom. Cats like marking territory by using the litter so that maybe what’s going on.
cactus,fcp01n3,t3_eicoot,1577846358.0,It’s symbiotic. The ants are attracted to sap at the areoles. Also opuntia are easier to identify by the flower
haworthia,fcnyzxz,t1_fcnqe4i,1577821143.0,The two examples look to have much wider leaves. Is that a trait of age of of the var. I think mine is the same but the thinner leaves threw me off.
haworthia,fcnbmdu,t1_fcmdlid,1577808156.0,"I have one also but it’s different from attenuata, I believe. It’s not hard leafed and the leaves are more grass like and very smooth except for the tubercules."
cats,fcmc5os,t3_ehy7oo,1577770165.0,I just started use equine pine bedding for litter. It has been great no litter and it is way cheaper. I saw a video on YouTube.
cactus,fc68cys,t3_ege23m,1577474618.0,If you want to have separate plants you can or just bump them up to a bigger pot.
cactus,fc63uhy,t3_ege23m,1577471656.0,It looks like four cut stems of Neoraimondia rooted in the pot.
succulents,fc63n4d,t3_ege663,1577471524.0,Haworthia fasciata  ‘Concolor’
succulents,fc63ems,t3_ege9v4,1577471372.0,Mine gets lots of light and can go so long without water. It never looks thirsty I just water every couple weeks.
haworthia,fad2sex,t1_facws15,1575953566.0,This is a hybrid of pumila and marginata. I got mine from a nursery in Colorado Springs that had a tray full of them. I don’t believe marginata has any pearls on them.
