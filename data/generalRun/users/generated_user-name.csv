Before (you shouldn’t be president) , during (get this guy out of here), after ,(he’s a citizen, lock him up.) lock Obama up for all I care, he droned civilians in other countries. What I’m saying is NOW, our President isn’t fit to be president.

Fuck your semantics anyway, you know the point I’m getting at. It’s something he needs to be charged with **and** convicted of.
