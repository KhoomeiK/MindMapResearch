I'm good now, though. 

One of my bigger regrets was how casual I was about my own drug use back when I was 20 and he was 18. I can't help but acknowledge that while he got into this much worse situation and everyone follows their own path blah blah, I definitely glamorized the scene and disregarded a lot of warnings and reassured him that hey, it's cool, *you and I* aren't *those* kinds of people.
