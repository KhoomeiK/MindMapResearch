kotakuinaction2,ffvnqhr,t3_ev9qod,1580268463.0,"Good grief, I hate this so much. I need to rant

I'm a long time fan that skipped a couple generations, mostly due to never bothering with a 3DS. I decided to get myself up to speed around the time that the Switch launched and remembered why I loved the series so much originally. Even with the more mediocre entries in the series, I still had a blast and loved carrying over my entire PC across generations.

I picked up SwSh, because I thought they'd put out a fun product even with some of the complaints people had. I bought the balance argument for the National Dex removal, and thought surely they'd take a consumer friendly approach with Home after all the bad press they've had so far.

But the end product is incredibly frustrating. I don't notice the issues while playing, but they sit with me as soon as I'm done. I've had fun for the 100 hours I've spent in this game, but the issues become more noticeable as time goes on. Story needed expanding, raids get repetitive, customization is worse, and extra content is non-existent. The terrible Gyarados animations get worse every time you see them. Raiding and breeding can be fun for a time, sure — but completing your Dex isn't as enjoyable as Let's Go and battling is more broken than ever. Battling for free on Pokemon Showdown (without the same canned animations) is a way more enjoyable experience. And now I'm expected to dump $50 more into this? The temptation to keep going is there, since so much has already been sunk into this.

I feel like a battered wife at this point, and I'm *this close* to getting rid of it all. Imagine where I could've been had I spent my 100 hours like a responsible adult..."

Completely agree.

No reason for OnePlus to use different back and search icons in their apps when every other app on my phone is consistent with these icons. And for some reason, the in display fingerprint sensor refuses to fire up whenever I try to open a notification directly from the lock screen.

Oxygen OS has a lot of great features, but I'm not convinced that it's more *polished* than what Google offers. I've been on it for almost 4 years now, and this stuff still drives me nuts."

The 8 Plus I've been considering is about $350 as well, but I'd assume it would get about 3 years of updates max since it's older. So it's less about longevity and more about maintenance of the software."

(Or in FE 3H for that matter, I'm interested in that too)

Then again, I am a huge Pokemon fan. I'm perfectly fine with RPGs and turn based combat, it's just easier to swallow any grinding there when it still feels like it's working towards a larger goal. Like I can take the Pokemon I spent hours breeding for online. Thankfully, Sword and Shield have made that way way less of an issue."

Anyone is more than welcome to give living there a try though. I'd love to hear a westerner's firsthand perspective on living there.

>China was happy to use Google's Android and Qualcomm devices for the last decade, but the US government stopped free trade.

The US has begun to step in because China has not stayed the same in the last decade. China has become more authoritarian and more invasive than ever before, and they certainly won't allow Western companies to stay the same if they want to keep doing business with them.

>Google can choose to ""cave"" to the demands of the Chinese people if it chooses to, it shouldn't be a choice made by the US government.

A powerful corporation that has an unmatched collection of data on US citizens should not cave to the demands of an oppressive communist regime, no. As a European or American citizen, the insane policies of China should have no bearing on your life whatsoever. This directly impacts American citizens, so it's perfectly understandable why the US government would step in."
