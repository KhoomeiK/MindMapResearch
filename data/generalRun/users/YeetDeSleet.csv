Yeah, there’s problems with medical insurance here. But the US’ pharmaceutical companies have also been the ones responsible for innovating and *creating* the medicine that so many people see as a human right.

HistoryMemes,fek0mqw,t1_fejcsyc,1579190065.0,"Tolkien wouldn’t have defined what you’re talking about as allegory. He would’ve called it applicable history.

I much prefer history – true or feigned– with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse applicability with allegory, but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author”

Allegory, to Tolkien, is pandering by forcing a deeper meaning into a story. Applicability is using a well crafted fictional history to learn lessons.

You wouldn’t look at a book on medieval history and say “Wow, look at all these allegories to modern politics”, because that’s not how history books work. You might, however, say “Wow, I can apply knowledge from this book to today”.
