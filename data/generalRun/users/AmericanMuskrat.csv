legaladviceofftopic,ffhd3do,t1_ffhc1r1,1579930454.0,"I was living here for a few years before the gate got installed and do a yearly lease.   I wouldn't leave over a gate anyways though, costs a lot of money to move, far more than a $100 key fob, and the one nice thing about my shitty apartments is this old construction is a hell of a lot more soundproof than the newer complexes.   That's worth a lot to me."

legaladviceofftopic,ffha3i2,t1_ffh9be1,1579927554.0,"A new management company put it up after we had already lived here a while, I was against it and told them but they don't care about my opinion.  Nearly all places have gates now, actually can't think of one that doesn't have them.   


Guess it makes people feel more secure, although if they had half a brain they'd look at the line of cars getting in the gate anyways and realize anyone that wants to come in is getting in anyways.


Another crappy thing about gates, and I told them this, is that they break all the time.   People get locked out at 3am and emergency maintenance needs to be called.   Or people lift them off their tracks.   Or ram it with their cars.   They're so pointless and stupid.


God forbid we ever have a fire either, they locked up the other exits.   I told them that was a fire hazard and reported it to the fire marshal.   Still nobody cares."

Personally I love tobacco.   I don't want to quit so I don't.   Maybe one day I'll have to but I'll cross that bridge when I get to it."

legaladviceofftopic,ffh8svf,t3_ethn3e,1579926400.0,"Sounds like my apartment, except ours wants $100 for the fob and isn't evicting people over it.


In Texas, my county anyways, what I've found is that it doesn't matter what the law is, judges side with apartment complexes over tenants, and there's always *something* they can evict you for in that 9 page lease.   It'd make more sense to just pay $50 than to face an eviction.


Maybe it's different in your area."
legaladviceofftopic,ffh7ze4,t1_ffh13zs,1579925702.0,"My apartment does this too with the fobs.   It's not hard to get in the gates, you just need to wait a little bit until someone else opens it.   Which makes it ridiculous to even have a gate in the first place.   It's just security theater."

CA_Kitchen,ffh5jl6,t3_etj5z6,1579923703.0,"It depends.   For liquid stuff to add just heat without much added flavor I'll use Louisiana Hananero sauce, it's just habaneros and vinegar.   For food I can't add liquids to I tend to use cayenne pepper for the same thing.


If I want to taste peppers and add some heat I generally add serrano or jalapeno.   Birds eye chilis are not much hotter imo than the serranos I grow (which are on the hot side for serranos) although I don't notice much flavor from bird's eye.   I do have 4 or 5 birds eye pepper plants growing indoors right now, video is over at r/Cagardening.   


If I just want pepper taste with no heat I'll use paprika or bell peppers, which is just the dried and fresh version of the same thing.   Blew my mind when I figured out that's what paprika was.


You should grow some peppers if you can't get them, they're really easy plants to grow."

I have I think 5 different diagnoses.   Patellar formella syndrome, arthritis, fibromyalgia, ...   maybe it was 3.   5 sounds more impressive though.


Anyways I think they're all wrong and it's an issue with the meniscus and the lateral ligaments.


And that's just for a simple impact injury."
