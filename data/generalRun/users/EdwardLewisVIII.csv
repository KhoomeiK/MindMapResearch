PoliticalHumor,ffjcs8p,t1_ffj9hui,1579995568.0,What a load of horseshit. Trump supporters have a lot of damn gall talking about political discourse.
PoliticalHumor,ffj8tt7,t3_etx8s1,1579993176.0,"Your mom rocks! Now just wait for all the ones who love to toss out the term ""snowflake"" to be all whiny and bitchy about this. Haha."

AskReddit,ffbt1mq,t1_ffbr0uv,1579781690.0,Great movie with a fantastic premise. I've always wanted to watch it in order.
unpopularopinion,ffb53qx,t1_ffb0e25,1579752029.0,"Socially responsive (truly democratic) capitalism is fantastic. It leverages the inherent favor of those who are great at making money to benefit everyone in society. 

The problem is the wealthy weild more power to persuade those making laws (i.e. the rules of the game) to favor them and ignore the greater good. 

It would have to be written into a country's constitution to make taxation truly progressive and unavoidable."
PoliticalHumor,ffb3a4a,t1_ffayabh,1579750687.0,"Seriously. He's 100% for equality, inclusivity, and helping the poor. He loves gays, immigrants....

AskReddit,ff9v2lp,t1_ff9fa6q,1579722101.0,"Exactly. In true democratic capitalism it would be. But in the US we have oligarchic capitalism so the corporation with the most/best lobbyists wins. The fear of overly ""socialistic"" distribution has made the bulk of people line up behind the very people keeping the bulk of the population benefiting fully from a robust economy."
Showerthoughts,ff9bbro,t1_ff9a674,1579709069.0,Did anyone drug test that bear? I think not.

facepalm,ff99kbf,t1_ff9837v,1579707966.0,I'd bet cash money that if you actually applied for it as a vanity plate it would get denied.

ShitAmericansSay,ff92h3f,t3_esbi1y,1579703216.0,"This isn't about Christianity, this is one of the Fox brainwashed where literally everything is either an attack on the mythical American Values or it is righteously American."

baseball,ff88tg9,t1_ff88681,1579669358.0,"Good point. I learned the key to being a comedian isn't being funny. There's millions of people that are funny. It's getting up in front of a tough group and bombing then getting up and doing it again the next day. And the next, and the next. 

Having that tough audience family makes sense that he had good stuff."
baseball,ff881ev,t1_fenf5rh,1579668671.0,At some point it had to just not be funny.

Braves,ff87ilb,t1_fes80gh,1579668221.0,It's the old Keynesian vs Classical argument. In the short run he's getting a paycheck he deserves. In the long run he's dead.
Braves,ff87b5v,t1_fepmu6m,1579668047.0,Because the South doesn't have mosquitoes. Or similar.

AskReddit,ff29o6g,t1_ff25pox,1579497944.0,Clint Howard is ubiquitous yet anonymous. For the most part. Which is the perfect alien cover.
