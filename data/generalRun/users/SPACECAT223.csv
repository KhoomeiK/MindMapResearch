You’re not the only one out here consuming media. So I mean some people like it. 

It’s nice to see black video game characters, lead characters and what not. 

The only thing I agree with you on is stereotypes. So it’s refreshing when I don’t see my people shucking and jiving everywhere and actually being themselves outside of their stereotypes.

If it’s not a big deal to you then more power to you. 

But to some people they want to see more than white males on the screen and that’s perfectly justifiable. 

It’s not like Hollywood is running outah roles for white ppl.

Always remember that what might not seem like a big deal to you, might seem like a huge deal to others.
