Glasgow doesn’t have a jamaica street for no reason, scots held positions of power and authority in the empire. It was no accident. The descendents of slaves don’t have names like lewis and harris by accident. If you are a Scottish protestant you’ll be well aware of what the black watch did in ulster, Scotland was not an innocent bystander in the expansion of the empire, it was an important part of it.
