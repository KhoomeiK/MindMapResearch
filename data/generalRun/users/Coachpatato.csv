todayilearned,ffj5mtf,t1_ffj1kp0,1579991003.0,That's Reddit.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fffpioy,t1_fff9bfv,1579888992.0,Checked the post history. Def white
mildlyinfuriating,fffm7su,t1_fff0z93,1579886975.0,Can't argue with that.

mildlyinfuriating,ffeyzgb,t1_ffeymjl,1579870889.0,Lol what? That's crazy. So he has like cold plates?
nba,ffdpkud,t1_ffdovvx,1579825925.0,Man do I love the raptors now?
nba,ffc5a7w,t1_ffc4emw,1579791853.0,"Are you sure about that? I'm seeing that you need a minimum of three years. The three years results in $21,360 per year. This is also much worse for older players. 

MLB requires 43 days, NBA is also 3 seasons but a lot more money than the NFL, NHL requires 160 games.

The NBA also matches up to 140% on your 401(k)"
nba,ffbx1de,t1_ffb00xy,1579785547.0,Think you have to play two or three years first
nba,ffbvukx,t1_ffbaslj,1579784475.0,It was a few years ago.
manga,ffavgb3,t1_ffamovz,1579745418.0,I like this better than solo leveling right now but mainly because SL got kind of stale. This also is hilarious so it doesn't matter that the MC is overpowered. Its pretty much a Korean isekai OPM.
CFB,ff9cq6m,t1_ff9au6w,1579710058.0,Because usually the only way you can lose in that situation is through turnovers. It's not worth it to turn the ball over once of twice and have to bring your starters back in.
falcons,ff8ys1z,t3_es61eg,1579700352.0,I mean the Patriots went 1-3 in the preseason last year and usually lose most of their games. The browns and lions both went 4-0 in the preseason before they went 0-16. I don't think preseason victories have much correspondence to regular season.
nba,ff643mh,t1_ff5vjhr,1579618637.0,I mean not even. I'm a millennial and remember it.

nba,fepkd3b,t1_feph76s,1579322763.0,Yeah i figured he had 22-25 pts or something and then look at the score and got 31
pussypassdenied,fep850p,t1_fep7nur,1579314281.0,"I think you're projecting or reading more into than is there. I don't think he's framing the conversation around attractiveness or skill, just that its not a common situation regardless. 

I mean no girls are offering me sex for engineering service and I think that is the same for most jobs."
pussypassdenied,fep79sq,t1_fep5nbx,1579313724.0,What the hell are you talking about? He's just saying most people don't have women offering sexual favors for their services.

BlackPeopleTwitter,feksill,t1_feks82d,1579206693.0,I'm still not really sure of your point. I'm just saying that just because someone is poor does not mean they're lazy. I think there are plenty of poor hard working people.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fekqsj7,t1_fekpebg,1579205685.0,Not everyone has the luxury of being able to put their effort into something that makes decent money. Do you think all poor people are lazy?
BlackPeopleTwitter,fekn8yc,t1_fekh3xk,1579203576.0,And even if you're not a homemaker just because you're broke does not mean you're lazy.
AtlantaHawks,fekccdl,t1_fekb390,1579197083.0,I think it makes sense that we were just trying to do right by him.
AtlantaHawks,fekanj0,t1_fek9tcn,1579196083.0,He asked to be traded.
nba,fehk2b4,t1_fehenps,1579118143.0,You're right. What was I thinking
movies,fegzxv1,t1_fegyaov,1579106237.0,"I thought it was great. That's exactly it, it was a bunch of chekov guns not firing. 

I can definitely see how someone would think it was boring but I just thought it was fun having this characters interact, drive around LA, have a good time, and nothing super bad happens. Sure it's not the most riveting plot especially compared to Tarentinos other movies, but I thought it was fun and really enjoyed it."
movies,fegxbgw,t1_fegvc1d,1579104615.0,"I loved it because it had the setups for all these movie situations we've seen a 100 times and none of them play out as expected: I thought Bead Pitt would get a starting role and endanger his friendship with leo, I though Leo's alcoholism would cause his life to come crashing down around him (or drown in his pool), I thought the acid dipped cigarette was going to accidentally be smoked by Leo or his wife, I thought something terrible was going to happen during Pitt and Leo's last big night on the town and others. It built up thses expectations and just kind of undercut them. I thought it was really fun."
nba,fegpcd3,t1_feghc3n,1579099348.0,Yeah he always says he was inspired by Nash in like every interview
nba,fegpb12,t1_fefhvx3,1579099323.0,Trae is really one of Nash's kids. He loves Steve Nash
nba,fefm3hq,t1_fefhp73,1579059261.0,Maybe because Ayton was drafted first?

Kanye,fe4vao7,t1_fe41l8h,1578863127.0,"I mean if anything that dude should be happy. She's willing to tell a white lie to make a good impression and try to keep the conversation going. She wouldn't do that if she wasn't interested in him,"
Atlanta,fe39z4s,t1_fe1sk24,1578847345.0,It's not that deep. I wouldn't do it in my coupe but my girlfriend's Jeep handled it no problem.
hearthstone,fe2u6ar,t1_fe2rgao,1578842887.0,The comment was directed towards the Chinese government not the Chinese people. I don't believe the comment is really racist at all and I'm surprised you're this offended by it.

todayilearned,fdppu7g,t1_fdpotc2,1578635995.0,Yeah I just wish It went more places. I pretty much only use it for games or the airport
comics,fdpovec,t1_fdpmbv0,1578635030.0,There's no point. They don't want to be educated apparently. You were as polite and informative as you could be.

nba,fdnq0b4,t1_fdmcq9j,1578590674.0,That was also 40 years ago. Language changes.
nba,fdnpth6,t1_fdneemr,1578590587.0,It's definitely racially charged in a sports context. Whether that's valid or not is another question but it is.
nottheonion,fdnnw4b,t1_fdnnebt,1578589670.0,I don't think people are saying they should be prohibited from having them just that it's stupid. I also imagine the type of person who would want to participate in a straight pride parade are generally not the most tolerant people
indieheads,fdn577d,t1_fdn3ng0,1578577606.0,I wasn't aware of that but it makes sense. Seems like most billionaires can't really fail when they're starting due to the support system around them. I think that also builds animosity.
indieheads,fdn51et,t1_fdn0jzc,1578577477.0,"I'm sure he could but he's not. The biggest issues also come from SpaceX which is private. 

I'm not as anti-billionaire as a lot of Reddit but I do think it's kind of gross to hoard that much wealth like some kind of dragon in a fantasy novel. I think at it's core the idea of someone having more money than they could spend in a lifetime while so many people struggle generates the animosity."
marvelstudios,fdme7n1,t1_fdmcqoi,1578547016.0,Yeah I think so. The most recent chapter came out 20 days ago and they come out once a month. I don't think its popular in Japan though.
indieheads,fdmcqrb,t1_fdmbrek,1578545748.0,I believe that the idea is that you can't become a billionaire without stepping on and crushing a lot of working class people. Elon is an example because of all the labor issues you see at SpaceX.

I don't think it makes any sense to think people just Uber in, take pictures, and Uber out to New York City."
nottheonion,fdl1txj,t1_fdky6e2,1578515587.0,But the stairs are in the Bronx? That's the whole crux of the conversation.

nfl,fdj6xgb,t1_fdiag4v,1578460164.0,Lol I thought that 19-19 thing was so weird too and mentioned it to my friends. I mean there are about 50 things more interesting to say at that point than it being 19-19
Feic,fdha9wm,t1_fdh8r43,1578418757.0,That there is a value to education more than just correlating it to dollars. The world would be a worse and more boring place if everyone only majored in STEM and this is coming from a mechanical engineer
Feic,fdh6ejd,t1_fdgmjay,1578416367.0,Ah yeah. That's why Socrates taught welding.
indieheads,fdgyvjf,t1_fdgy2k1,1578411667.0,I think it's kind of a chicken and egg thing though right? She was there when that Instagram style shit was coming out and it was kind of Lana-y from the start.
