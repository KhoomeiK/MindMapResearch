Minoxbeards,feg7icl,t3_eot1et,1579080686.0,"Shaving effects nothing. As long as you're using a good razor that is sharp, you'll be cutting the hairs off rather than yanking them out. The latter is bad.

Minox needs to get to your skin in order to be properly absorbed, so the less facial hair the better. Not to mention easier, it'll dry in 30 mins or so whilst clean shaven."

Minoxbeards,fcx66fh,t1_fcx0zt1,1578052869.0,"Ah right I see what you're asking.

As always, this is just my opinion and my own best guess. But I'd think that using aloe vera anywhere on the body is fine.

Hell, does it even hinder facial hair growth if used on the face? My guess is probably not.

But since I'm on this journey, my view is that I may as well follow protocol (which is all guess work btw lol) and avoid dht blockers on my face. But again, as mentioned above its my own opinion that it won't hinder much, if anything at all."
Minoxbeards,fcx074e,t3_ejby8w,1578045326.0,"Aloe Vera is a DHT blocker apparently.

I don't use anything with that in it in my face because I don't know any better so I follow guidance as best I can."

Here's a future tip. I always walk out the barbers with a slightly different cut. More or less the same style I rock, but different. I'm sure this is purely down to my sucky ability to explain what I want.

A few months ago I got the perfect cut I was happy with. Went straight home, and took a picture of my whole head using the '3D panorama' facility (you hold down the picture button and scroll around your head). Now I walk in and show them this picture. They scroll the image left and right a few times which shows them a 3D picture of my whole head, and know immediately what I want.

Wish I'd done this years ago, saves so much grief."

I would like to be able to do what you do, but even if I did have the intellect and skills you possess I do not think I could do it. I'd be too heartbroken during the lows.

Thanks for being you dude.

In addition to this, I cannot further stress enough how important pet insurance is. Particularly in the UK, ensure you get coverage that is for the *life* of your loved one, whereby your allowance per illness resets every year. As opposed to that allowance for said illness having to last for the rest of their life.

Yes, the former is far more costly - I pay around £1k per year for my yorkie, but I wouldn't ever dream of being without it should the worst happen."

Minoxbeards,fc2ge7c,t3_efsgoc,1577358748.0,"It does kind of look like new hair is appearing, however it does look like the hairs are differing lengths so could you grow hair there before?

Ultimately, in the grand scheme of things you haven't been on minox for very long so I wouldn't expect many changes in that time.
Also, the picture quality isn't that good so it may be you have loads of vellus hairs growing that we can't see clearly.

As always, stay consistent and play the long game. Looking good regardless!"
Minoxbeards,fc0mk8b,t1_fbzcx4t,1577294601.0,"Hey. It stills grows there but it's still very much vellus. I don't think it'll ever turn terminal - after all, I don't apply minox there directly.
I just get it shaved off with a straight razor when I get my hair cut. No issues."
