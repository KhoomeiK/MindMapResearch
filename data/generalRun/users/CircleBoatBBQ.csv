From Live Science:


A person's core body temperature usually hovers around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). Hypothermia occurs when core body temperature dips to around 95 F (35 C) or lower. 


Surprisingly, people can experience hypothermia in relatively cool, but not freezing, air temperatures — around 30 to 50 F (minus 1 to 10 C) — particularly if they are wet, such as from rain, sweat or submersion in cold water, according to the National Weather Service. The body loses heat about 25 times faster in water than in air, Michael Sawka, chief of the Thermal & Mountain Medicine Division at the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), told Live Science in a 2010 interview.

Some people believe life is a simulation, some people think we are all one living being and we must care for all, some think they are literally (literally literally) currently in Hell. 


We never truly know just what type of human anyone is, as in we don’t know if our dad is 100% convinced that he is the only real human, or entity, living in a video game of some sort. And after many years he has decided that he could be bad or end the game at any time, but he genuinely enjoys playing the game, and has grown to love his kids and family just like we as humans can have a deep sentiment/love of items like our cars/houses/robot friends/avatars. Hell my little BB8 robot greets me when I get home or randomly wakes up and blinks and bops around and I love him like I love when cats do goofy dumb stuff that makes me laugh.


My point is, we have no idea if he quite possibly thinks he is in some sort of game and he is earning XP in the form of Dollars. When you are on that level of society where money is just there, it doesn’t hold the true power over your head like it does for the majority of humans in existence, it becomes more of a game rather than survival like most of us experience. He truly could believe he is a god in his own world, no matter what his actions are he keeps moving on and up, and to him everyone on the world may just be artificial or ""NPCs"" for all we know.

A gas powered one would definitely be doable. A 50-80cc atv can carry an adult no problem, but might struggle with a plow. 

I suggest also looking up “linear actuators” online. They are just a servo that makes a pole go in and out basically, so they are easy to hook up to a heavier duty steering setup. You could even use one as a more reliable throttle servo since that is important safety wise. 

For brakes, that would be a different issue that I haven’t researched heavily because I switched to electric on my projects quite a while ago. I would definitely suggest some sort of “dead man” system though for the throttle and brakes, example: your radio loses signal and the system automatically kills the engine and applies full brakes. 


The stuff I’m suggesting is definitely a bit pricey, but with those search terms I know you can find similar items or used/junk yard/ebay items that will bring the cost down dramatically"

The throttle and brake should be easy like you said. For my robots I use Dimension Engineering Sabertooth motor controllers. I use the Sabertooth 2x12 for smaller stuff and a 2x60 for my ride on vehicles. I’m able to drive 3 people on the robot and it doesn’t even trip the fan for temps. It also has Regenerative braking which acts like a brake with lighter applications 

You can run any battery chemistry and a simple RC radio system will connect right up. You can also use it for tank type steering with 2 motors or standard setup where it just supplies power evenly to one or two motors. And a regular rc remote will work for either one. 

There might be something cheaper in rc grade, but if you’re plowing snow, I would recommend these. I rode my robot through 1.5 feet of snow and it just “plowed” a path right through it. 

I’ve also used them to make boats.
