Senior year in high school I (17M at the time) was in the musical and asked this girl I liked to give me a ride home after rehearsal, and suggested ""oh and we can grab a bite to eat first."" (Very transparent, but I was too shy to ask her on a direct date out of the blue.)

We were getting ready to leave rehearsal and one of our guy friends was like ""oh you guys are getting food, can I come??"" Both she and I knew this was a ""date"" (we clearly liked each other but had been dancing around it), but since it wasn't an official date we felt weird saying no. Why wouldn't two friends allow their third friend to come along?

So we went out to eat (literally Panda Express, nothing fancy) and while we were eating, our friend slowly realized and said ""oh, am I interrupting something?"" I think she and I both said no, but the friend picked up on it. He made a dumb excuse about why we had to drop him off back at campus immediately.

Why can't the solution to these problems you're talking about be family planning instead of abstinence or near-abstinence? Seems like a more realistic solution to convince people to actually do, doesn't it?
* Fatherlessness is for sure bad, I agree with you there. Are unplanned pregnancies more likely to yield fatherless children? Are fatherless children more likely to be poor? More likely to commit crimes? Yes, yes and yes. But your original comment painted them as near-certainties, which I don't believe they are. Especially if you're combining multiple of those characteristics.
   * Moreover, why are you focusing the blame for fatherlessness on the woman for sleeping around rather than on the father for abandoning his family?
* I just think it's funny when people pull out the ""My taxes pay your salary"" thing to cops and gov't workers. Maybe your taxes pay for part of one cop's salary. But how many things can you claim your taxes alone pay for? People act like they're single-handedly carrying the burden of funding the entire government.

unpopularopinion,ff45px2,t1_ff363lf,1579556122.0,"I think everyone knows the best way to avoid STDs is abstinence (not just until marriage, but life-long celibacy).

I'm assuming most people's issue is that she's promoting it as a solution which takes away the fun of premarital sex. It's like saying ""The best way to avoid dying in a car crash is never riding in a car."" Everyone would say, ""Okay, duh. But I'm not going to live my life that way.""

And as the Ella Dawson person in the first link points out, from a macro point of view, promoting abstinence without education on safe sex is not the best way to prevent STDs. It's presenting abstinence as an *option* but at the same time realizing that people are going to have sex even if you tell them not to and teaching people (namely teens) how to have sex but avoid STDs and unwanted pregnancies.

Imagine if every car safety expert taught us ""just don't get in a car, problem solved"" and no airbags or other safety features were included in cars and no one ever taught anyone to drive in a safe way (but driving is still perfectly legal). It would be a blood bath on the roads.

unpopularopinion,ff43w8p,t3_er65w8,1579554977.0,"I don't think they're inherently more aggressive, I just think they're stronger so it's a bigger deal whenever they become aggressive. Plus, because they're strong, more people train them to fight, so there are a lot of aggressive ones out there.

In my experience, small dogs (looking at you chihuahuas) are the most aggressive, but when a chihuahua tries to bite your ankle it's either unsuccessful because it's so small and weak or it doesn't hurt so who cares. When a pit bull does, it fucking hurts.

Plus, even if it was just as bad as getting bit by a lab or something, there's a confirmation bias and people are more likely to report it: ""People say pit bulls are dangerous. One just bit me. That stereotype must be right. I have to report this menace."" A lab bites you: ""It really hurt, but he didn't mean to. He was just playing.""

I know multiple people with pit bulls and the owners are scared to death of small dogs because owners will let them off their leashes and the small dog will attack the pit. If the pit defends itself, it's going to fucking win and then be labeled as dangerous, maybe even put down. The only time the pit bulls I know have hurt (very mildly) anyone is when they're playing but just don't know they're own strength.

Then with assholes who are going to train dogs to fight, they're obviously going to look for the strongest dog breeds. Even if it's not fighting, it might be people trying to have a guard dog or make them look tough so they encourage aggression. If the dogs run away or get abandoned and end up in a shelter, there's often no way of knowing the dog's past. They don't come with carfax. You don't know if he'd been incentivized to attack other dogs all his life or that when his last owner approached him in a certain way, it meant he was going to be beaten.

I think like all dogs they can be domesticated and raised to be gentle and awesome. I've seen it multiple times. But their last owner might have raised them wrong and fucked them up causing them to unlearn a lot of bad habits. Then the good ones might either go overboard while playing because they're so strong or when -- like most every dog -- they have a rare slip-up, it means the fucking electric chair because ""pit bulls are bad"" and this lone instance obviously proves it. That could also easily sway statistics too because incidents with a pit bull are more likely to be reported whereas with another dog it might be swept under the rug."

Not to mention that if somehow all of these scenarios become true and he is a murderer that he defies astronomical odds and kills YOUR kid.

I'm very nonconfrontational, so I'd probably agree with the top commenter and say avoid talking about it.

I'm 26. Started becoming non-Christian at 16 and I'd say was fully non-Christian by 19. I mainly try to avoid the subject with my parents which can be tough. I've even lied about having gone to church (I live in a different town) a few times just to get them off my back and avoid the ""why aren't you going to church?"" conversation. The times it became unavoidable was when I told them I was moving in with my gf and when I told them I didn't want my wedding in a few months to be super religious. Before that, I was able to conceal things like premarital sex and making fun of Christians to my friends, but these were public things that were against what they believed. Basically, it's been a few really hard conversations where I've tried to walk the tight rope of saying that I want to do something that they believe isn't God's will for me without flat out saying ""I don't give a shit about God's will.""

Thankfully, they're pretty understanding for parents in this situation. The last conversation I had with them about this stuff was ""Here's what we'd hope you'd want to do but you're an adult and can do what you want and we'll love you either way."" I'm pretty lucky, because I've seen plenty of stories of parents that would not have that reaction. So, basically I think we might finally be in a place where they're getting the hints that I don't believe what they do anymore without us having to have a full-on talk about it. I'm still nervous to confront them in a lot of ways. When I visit on a weekend, I still go to church with them on Sunday because I can't bring myself to say ""I'd rather go anywhere else but there.""

I'm not saying what I've done is the best way to go about things, but that's my experience and how my parents reacted to it. Good luck!"
exchristian,fedx353,t3_enxp6k,1579021724.0,"The first time I had (premarital) sex, I felt pretty weird afterwards. I was 18 and was on a gradual exit from Christianity that had started at 16. I decided I was fine with premarital sex as long as I was in love, which I very much was (we're still together 8 years later and about to get married). But after having sex, I had so many of the talking points swirling around my head about how virginity is something you can never get back, how my marriage will be tarnished because I didn't save myself, how I'm basically a different person now because I'm not a virgin. It really somewhat ruined what should have been a purely beautiful experience.

After a short period of guilt, I came to my senses and shook it off. I honestly felt strange to realize that I was the same person as before. That touching genitals doesn't make you an inherently different person.

The funny thing is we'd had oral sex and all sorts of other sinful things dozens of times before having intercourse and I never really felt guilt over that. The church puts so much emphasis on intercourse that so many Christian teens I knew rationalized to say ""Well, a blowjob or eating her out is fine. I'll still be a virgin until I'm married."""
exchristian,fedw5gt,t3_enromh,1579021155.0,"If you abstain from premarital sex only because external forces around you have to keep you from doing it, are you really living a godly life? It's like Christian colleges not allowing the other gender in dorms. Why not allow adults to make their own decision to follow God's will rather than force them too?"

TwoXChromosomes,fedte5w,t3_eoip7f,1579019490.0,"Growing up (as a male) in the Christian church and Christian schools the emphasis was always on the girls to dress modestly to not ""tempt"" or ""distract"" the boys. They say the same thing talking about grown-ass men in church.

Even though it's the males who would be actually committing the sin (lust), they put the burden on the females to remove any and all obstacles for the males. It's a real ""she was asking for it"" culture that would never be applied to another sin that didn't involve subjugating women. No one says ""Well the store should have a security guard if they didn't want you to steal"" or ""well he should get his life together if he doesn't want people to gossip about him."" You're just expected not to steal and not to gossip."

Just start it out of the office so she feels safe and unharassed and you don't get fired. If she's not into you, she can turn down the date"
