My oldest has ADHD and ODD plus developmental delays. We started seeing him in 2015, and she has improved dramatically. The clinic also has the PCPs that work under him. So it is also their pediatrician as well. There is a waiting list, but it is worth every minute. (337) 261-6655. They recently moved their office near the corner of Congress and Ambassador. Good luck, and pm me if you need any more info."

If the sample was on a public forum by itself I can see it being unknowingly. I'm not tech savvy (hence the long winded question) but wouldn't it take some effort to separate the audio from video? Or at least be trouble enough to know that you are sourcing it from someone who is monetized? (I also am not sure how monetizing works). Again, just asking."
