nextfuckinglevel,fff624s,t3_et89nk,1579876629.0,I just realized I can actually do this. I have the Moto Z3 Play with the projector attachment and an off-brand go-pro with live feed.
apexlegends,ffe36h6,t3_esxd55,1579835498.0,Literally every thermal in any other game. Why wasn't this implemented after the first time being suggested?

awfuleverything,ff9j3za,t1_ff9isuh,1579714099.0,I can't watch movies unless I see them in the theater or rent a disc
awfuleverything,ff9i842,t1_ff8tvpu,1579713571.0,"Actually slightly accurate. This is an online service, so you are wrong, but if you mistook it as a business like Redbox or Family Video, you would be 100% correct. Thankfully, disc rental businesses don't do this^(yet)."
