Sometimes it's better to wait a few weeks until you really know the personality.  I named my kitten Dali because her face reminded me of Salvador Dali.  Then she got used to that name and I discovered she will watch TV for hours if a Pixar movie is on, and I wished I had waited and named her Pixar or Pixie."

You can see them here: [https://pulaski-so-ar.zuercherportal.com/#/inmates](https://pulaski-so-ar.zuercherportal.com/#/inmates)

When you first go there, they are not sorted by date.  You have to click ""Arrest date"" twice to see them sorted by most recent.

Side note:  I'm a web developer at the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette and we are working right now on a way to get the arrests from Pulaski County to show on our [Right2Know page.](https://www.arkansasonline.com/right2know/)  Check there in a week and you should be able to see them there. (Hopefully)"

I am disturbed by a couple of things in that one. 

1. Part of the title is ""soft elephant""
2. There's a note to let you know they're made in ASIAN SIZE and you should choose 1-2 size larger than your normal size.
3. The second photo.
4. The trouble the man will have when he needs to pee.  Which brings me to [this other option.](https://www.amazon.com/Mens-Underwear-Briefs-Knickers-Underpants/dp/B07T5JPRWR/ref=pd_sbs_193_1/145-1026373-9129509?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07KXXP69Z&pd_rd_r=2abc8190-f0ba-4361-a747-fda546d920c4&pd_rd_w=OGFtX&pd_rd_wg=zDEED&pf_rd_p=bdd201df-734f-454e-883c-73b0d8ccd4c3&pf_rd_r=XDMXQ4VWZAWBSAE9A9R3&psc=1&refRID=XDMXQ4VWZAWBSAE9A9R3) Which has even more disturbing photos because what the hell is he doing with his hand.

When my spouse passed, someone gave me a small piece of advice right after it happened, and it turned out to be very true and I'll never forget it.  She said ""in the first couple of weeks, people are going to say some really stupid things to you that are going to really piss you off.  Just remember that it's only because they don't know WHAT to say and it makes them feel awkward, and they haven't lost their other half yet, so they don't know.  Try not to let it bother you, they already feel stupid for saying it.""

I know you may be thinking, what possible thing could someone say that could be stupid enough to piss me off when they're just trying to give condolences?   Just watch.

Rough days/weeks/months are ahead of you, OP.  Your life will never be the same, but it will be bearable again, and hopefully it will even be good again.

pics,fehn2yi,t1_feh40bj,1579119883.0,"This exactly!!!  The only thing I had when my spouse passed 5 years ago was two voicemail messages.  Someone reminded me to save them.  I knew I would not have that phone forever and there was no way to send the voice message from that phone, so I just used a voice recorder app from another phone and recorded them while they were playing on speaker from the original phone.  That app let me send the recordings as a file, so I sent them to my google drive and also saved them on a usb drive.  

5 years doesn't seem like long enough to forget what someone sounds like, but it really is.  I listen to it about once a year and I'm like... oh yeah... that was his voice!!"
