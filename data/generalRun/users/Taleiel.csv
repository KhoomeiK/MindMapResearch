WarhammerCompetitive,ffxsdiy,t1_fft48ru,1580331473.0,I'll keep these updates coming as I get games in. So far I'm considering dropping the corsairs out of the list and splitting the 30 man darkshards into 3x10 for more reliability while freeing up enough points to add a Lord Ordinator for the crossbows.

WarhammerCompetitive,ffqk1te,t1_ffpudna,1580136731.0,"A stonehorns is Bravery 9.  With the Kharibdyss, Horrorghast, Pall of Doom and dark riders ( easy to do) that drops to bravery 1.

The crypt flayers then do an average of 2D6-3 mortal wounds each model when they scream which won't kill it on average but will do maybe 10 damage after the shrug.   

Alternatively vitriolic spray plus 80 corsair swings or 60 crossbow shots still mathmatically kill it in one go.

I don't think I'd have too much trouble against BCR personally and if you brought say a 4 man mournfang unit they're only bravery 6.  Fully debuffed that's bravery -4 so killing 1 model means the rest die, and a unit of flayers would be doing 2D6+2 MW per model per scream. Again wiping it outright."

For those unaware the idea behind the bat bomb was to drop a large cage of bats with delayed detonation incendiary devices strapped to them. The bats would then scatter after the panic of the drop and would roost in attics and warehouses and similar structures which would simultaneously detonate a few hours later starting mass fires over a much larger area then could be achieved by a single bomb"

WarhammerCompetitive,fdqyb1j,t1_fdqsj98,1578676671.0,"~~Yes~~ and no. ~~You can deepstrike turn 1 but you have to land in your own deployment zone which unless you went second and the enemy rushed forwards or youre playing on one of those awkward half map deployment zones is not where you want your scions to land~~.

The strength of the drop force is turn one pressure and alpha striking. You can't get the triple command squad and prime to do that. I always run a command squad and a squad of 7 scions (2 plas, 1 Plas pistol, and 4 hotshot) and a prime with command rod to give them being it down. I've never felt they haven't been ""punchy enough"" and often nuke a priority target fairly well."

astramilitarum,fdp7lpi,t3_ef67c0,1578621872.0,"Id swap one unit of crusaders for ogryn/bullgryn. It's the acts of faith that make the crusaders good and only one unit can do it.

Second, as someone who runs a primarily Militarum Tempestus army. Drop the scion squads to the small 5 man size and make sure to bring the Plas pistol on the Tempestor.  The reasoning is flexibility of Deepstrike. I've fit little 5 man squads in tiny pockets where the enemy didn't QUITE screen 9"" out. Every surplus model makes it harder to land where you want and the plasma pistol while unable to generate the extra shot due to short range is one more potential deal Primaris on the drop.  If you're thinking ablative wounds, T3 and 5+ save means they disintegrate when fired at anyways so it won't matter, mine are often overkilled by 5+ wounds.

Also, add one more Tempestor Prime preferably with a plasma pistol to drop in with the ""odd man out"" squad for take aim.   While you CAN make the other Tempestor have 3 orders having two seperate teams helps when you need to snipe objectives or hit something like two backfield unsupported exocrines in opposite corners of the deployment."
