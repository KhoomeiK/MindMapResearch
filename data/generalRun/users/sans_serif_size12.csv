I live in a dorm that’s meant to be a safe place for people who identify within the LGBT+ spectrum and allies. There’s a huge emphasis on “found family” and community bonds. And that sense of community helps us when things get difficult. I make fun of all the self-care nights they have, but I recognize that sometimes different things help people start talking. Sometimes you get someone to start talking by sharing a beer with them. Sometimes it’s in the middle of putting panda face masks on. Either way, you’re talking. That’s what counts. 

I saw it written in a post earlier that it’s not so much that men don’t talk about their emotions, but it’s that they don’t have anyone to talk to. And that’s just so sad to me. I’m so sorry you feel alone. Having a “found family” both through here and in other places has made a life or death difference for me. I hope you all find your “found family”.

Edit: Also compliments. A compliment makes a bad day feel significantly less worse. I looked like shit during finals week once and someone said they thought my shirt was rad. It was awesome. I’ve found that complimenting someone on something they can change (ie their talents, wardrobe choices, that sorta thing) usually gets met with a positive response versus “hey nice ass.” Though complimenting someone’s nose or eyes also seems pretty okay."

AmItheAsshole,felw89h,t1_felvfo4,1579232489.0,"Totally get that.

Me still being in school/ having to pay back a lot of loans at the same time would’ve put a hold on that, and it was talk we eventually had when we were both at a better place. 

The “project” I was pursuing was a masters degree, but the program I wanted to apply to is notoriously competitive and expensive. That conversation led me to other resources and helped me realize I could turn the experience I’d gotten in pursuit of my original project into a teaching credential. That way I could still study in field I was interested and educated in while working a sustainable job.

But I remember we had that talk while we were both emotional and tired from school/work things, so I shut down and didn’t want to talk about it for a while. When you do have this talk, make sure you’re both in a state of mine where you can talk about a heavy topic like this. Best of luck!"

relationship_advice,feli0fd,t3_epqtbk,1579222642.0,"I think you genuinely want what’s best for your daughter, but this isn’t the best way. I am a solid believer that not everyone needs to go to fancy four-year college to live a good and relatively stable life. That being said, everyone *does* need some form of education or training, so they can take care of themselves sustainably. This can be vocational studies, community college, or maybe it is the fancy four year college. How does she feel? What are her interests? Things she’s passions the about? Those things can be turned into something that can feed you. 

Modeling isn’t a sustainable career, and not the environment a 16 year old should be around. Talk to your daughter about her future. Teach her about finances and career planning. And 16 is the perfect time to start. 

I’m the child of immigrant parents. They grew up poor and I grew up poor, and their biggest wish for me was that I’d live comfortably and give my children a better future. The best thing they ever did for me was give me the knowledge I needed to do that for myself. The best thing you can do for your daughter isn’t to become her modeling agent or manager, but to help her navigate her future so she can live a comfortable life.

Edit: Really trying to empathize that second paragraph. This isn’t an environment 16 year olds should be in. Shitty people prey on underage girls. Especially in industries like modeling. A 16 year old should be in school, doing things high schoolers do. I know in another post you mentioned she has a hard time in school. This is the time to get her help. Public schools usually have a counselor or some kind that can help you find free/affordable mental health care."

ChoosingBeggars,fe1p9vq,t1_fdwy3pc,1578829251.0,"Don’t normally reply but this piqued my interest because I was born in the Philippines and the relatives that aren’t nurses are school teachers over there and even well-to-do schools aren’t comparable to US schools. 

While children being a parents’ retirement is still fairly common practice (my mom half-jokes about it a lot), family planning and birth control methods in the Philippines are not socially acceptable, due in no small part to the Catholic Church. Two of my uncles got married way before they were ready because they had children out of wedlock and they were pressured into it. And this wasn’t uncommon. And maybe it was just my parents’ province (Pangasinan and Nueva Vizcaya) but the Catholic Church offers help with a lot of strings attached. Mom is Methodist and Dad was Catholic, and I’ve heard and witnessed some shit when it came to religion back home. Many politicians use religion to justify their terrible actions. Part of the reason why the current president is popular is because he brands himself as free of the church’s influence.

Also with how community and family-focused our culture is, the sons aren’t necessarily the ones to take care of older family members. Most of the time it’ll be the eldest child regardless of gender, but it’s honestly whoever can afford to support them. Sometimes that’s the oldest son who works at a call center, sometimes it’s the youngest daughter living overseas. Hell sometimes, it’s the daughter-in-law on the sole basis of being the highest educated. It’s considered a great shame if you don’t care for your parents, even if you’re married and living with your spouse’s family. 

Then again, YMMV because of how diverse the Philippines is. Different ethnic groups have different practices, and even my parents’ experiences growing up are wildly different, and they didn’t grow up that geographically far from each other."
