Players shouldn't know, and definitely shouldn't act on information their characters wouldn't know. Plus your modifications seem reasonable, not meanspirited at all, and something that could be guessed at by... you know, imagining a skeleton?

That the Might Nein have shown up here when they have a chance of defeating her is honestly more credit towards sheer luck and coincidence.

Thoreau is entirely 100% in his right mind to be terrified and cautious of this being. He'd die in one hit, and Hags delight in things much much worse than death."

Plus the whole source of tieflings can be a mess. Are they from an ancient fallen empire? Or did their parents recently make a deal? Did someone do the nasty with a fiend? Was someone cursed? Is it consistent, diluted, or can it skip generations?

Puzzle for a door, themed with time or prophecies. You have six slates, which are square pyramid shaped, and six pyramidal indentations in the wall. The six square bases of the pyramids are what matters, they each have a scene carved on them, and the players must determine the correct order of the scenes.

I had, for example- a hero killing an evil king, a land suffering, a man stabbing a sleeping king, a hero being crowned, a bountiful land, a king leading an army in battle. Stuff with recurring elements, maybe based on a story for your world.   

The trick is that there's not a correct order- the six pyramid pieces don't go in the wall, but instead go together to form a cube, without any real start or end."

So I conspired with one player to flesh out two characters and discuss them with the party before it began. One was his genuine character, but the other, this druid, was named, fleshed out how he joined the crew, who he got along with the works, all my information he fed to the group.

First session, first minute, and this character they've looked forward to playing with has poisoned them in their sleep and thrown them off into the sands below, as well the conspiring player's real character, a bard.

Now, I do love me some strong NPC stat blocks, but it's easy to use them in ways that make sense- to show players that other people have adventured, trained, studied, and this might be them in the future, whether in campaign or epilogue. The story is about the party because they're strong, the story is about the party because they take on the challenges. 

Had a bandit lord who was a level 20 fighter- he'd been an adventurer, a royal bodyguard when he retired, and then got mind controlled, committed regicide, and deserted to drink his life away. An airship captain was similar, but he'd helped raid the city of the gods previously and had a big name. A king was a high level warlock because he had led a raid into a city of the gods and gained Wishes along the way, granting him authority and power. An elvish cult had strong members because A. All the weaker members had been scared off, and B. the elves had been practising for centuries.

Sarcasm over, I like drawing and describing elves with beards. Goatees and moustaches suit condescending jerk elves. If people on reddit wanna pick elvish beards as a hill to die on, well, roll initiative I guess :P"
dndstories,fdnhgv4,t3_em75tr,1578585897.0,"Yeah. What were you expecting? ""Oh man I really loved that heroic fantasy game where we lost our legs at low level fighting some shark and woke up in a dungeon with nothing""?   
 Take a session 0 and decide what kind of game you're playing. Is is hardcore dark souls, is it fantastic rule of cool stuff, is it maiming every combat or crazy shenanigans? Honestly, it's kinder to let player characters die than it is to cripple them and expect the player to enjoy the slowest or most ineffective scarred heaps."
Bossfight,fdk5ulr,t3_elrarj,1578496756.0,"Ah neat, which one's Mittens? What's the other ones names?"
OnePiece,fdjv0qf,t3_eljmu5,1578488413.0,"Nah. There's a symmetry to the story, with the timeskip being the seam.      

The Strawhat's aren't skipping steps. What good was going to the arctic? How did going to the antarctic help Roger? The steps are four red poneglyph coordinates, and go there. That's what Luffy's doing. 

Skipping steps would be Rayleigh telling them everything, back in the bar, back before the timeskip. That's the fast route, the easy route. 

What did Roger do? Blaze around reading poneglyphs. What is Luffy doing? Hunting down poneglyphs AND FREEING PEOPLE. Did Roger help Wano? Did Roger help Tom? Did Roger bring Brook to Laboon? 

Strength isn't everything. Luffy leaves a better world behind him than Roger did in his day."
DnD,fdd8ump,t3_ekq027,1578300150.0,"That's fair enough, I really love the Outsider from Dishonored, though arguments could be made that arming people for your own entertainment is evil, he's mainly neutral. I love that he has a goblin minion haha, enjoy!"
FairyGardens,fdbz6re,t3_ekk9j3,1578264133.0,"So hope this is alright here, not a realist style, but wanted to design a bunch of different fairies for a story I'm working on. In the story they're all a family, with eleven siblings, and finally their old man in the bottom right.

Was all going well until I got to the trash knight in the bottom left, he kinda breaks the theme a bit!"
DnD,fdbcifu,t3_ekftzt,1578255997.0,"**Thief**: *The Doctor:* A Thief with the Healer feat, this man of sharp wit and anatomical knowledge derides magical healing and instead aids others through skill, precision and intellect, pushing the field of medicine forwards through good deeds.   

**Inquisitive:** *The Noble:*  A noble born youth seeking adventure, they learned to sneak and pick locks from avoiding servants and pinching sweets from their kitchens. Courtly life and intrigue taught them how to look for deceit and schemes."

OnePiece,fd2pw3y,t1_fczodqw,1578150496.0,"Also Katakuri was very very diverse with his fruit. Be easy to imagine another man being a weakling like Mr 3 with that, or a crazy chef, but Katakuri's brain and brawn made that fruit obscene."
OnePiece,fcz5auq,t3_ejg7wt,1578093960.0,"I feel like the Shadow Fruit was used in a specific.... ""build"" by Moria. Like he'd been in the New World, heard of Big Mom, maybe seen some Homies, got wrecked by Kaido, and tried to copy them.   

I like the idea that a different ShadowMan would act like Shikamaru or make shadow blades or stuff and never discover Shadow + Body = Zombie. Plus Moria is well known to be a lazy bum so he would be the type to not discover more direct uses of his power, in favour of an easy route."
DnD,fcvqm33,t3_ej5ygz,1578007887.0,"Well, I can only speak as a loyal Githyanki, but I see no problem with this. It is well known that those limbo loving losers are completely Flawed, and it is good to hear that these strange coastal wizards agree."
