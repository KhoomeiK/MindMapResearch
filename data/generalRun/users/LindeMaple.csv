Over here, we used to have Gov statistics everyone had to fill out; ""luxury"" was defined by how many washroom and bedrooms there were in the residence.  And for apartments over here, I have only seen ""luxury"" defined by whether or not the unit has a dishwasher and or a washer/dryer inside, a concierge, and a pool and sauna accessible to all tenants.  We have rental magazines where the developer defines in.  There are only about three major companies that own all of the rentals anyway.

But if the luxuary part had an expiration - like after 10 years the building it is no longer considered luxury if it still has low occupancy, then I think things would move along.

But then I don't know why spam would be in their traditional dishes either then.  I guess its whatever is cheap, as well.  Also I do think things are different now in term of exports.
