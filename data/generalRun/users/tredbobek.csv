I would say that we don't really need lower STK (shots-to-kill), since in PS people mostly use rifles. Smaller caliber automatic weapons also have higher STK in PS. High power weapons (DMRs and higher caliber MGs) also kill in 1-2 shots.

Bushes are cool (because of the slow down and proper visual cover), but I hate them, but that's because maps have a bunch of them (welcome to western europe) and people camp in them with rifles.

When they removed the dead-dead from Squad, one of their main reason was ""it's confusing for new players"", since you just got back to the spawn screen. PS solved this by seeing a You are dead screen before jumping back to the spawn screen. Easy."

True, you can't buy them directly, but you have to either play more (which then increases the chances that you buy something, cosmetics or season pass), or buy boosters. So indirectly it's making them money. If alpha packs gave better rewards, it might even motivate players more.

Your family is a bad example, since family members do something in order to make you happy, just because they love you (and that's just one problem with the example, I'm tired to list other errors).
