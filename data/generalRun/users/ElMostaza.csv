I noticed this when I was home for Christmas break, so I built a platform right in front of the tank, with a nice ramp to help her up and a heated pad to warm her old bones. Every night she would climb up and meow until I poured out a little pile of catnip. She was too old to really play with it, so she'd rub her nose in it until her face was covered and her eyes were wide, then trip out watching the pretty colors until she drifted off to sleep.

Those weeks ended up being my last moments with her, and I still get sad when I visit home and see the fish tank.

It's definitely worth mentioning in some very specific situations, but those are far rarer than the number of times these ""helpful"" explanations are posted.
