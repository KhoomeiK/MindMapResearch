DMAcademy,fffsanm,t1_fffrg9b,1579890709.0,"Okay. So basically, you need someone for every job:
-Someone to recieve/interpret the word from Bahamut (Oracle, High Priest, Shaman, Prophet)
-Someone to teach the word of Bahamut (Priest, Pastor, Reverend)
-Someone to use the words of Bahamut (Cleric/Paladin)
-Someone to take care of the church and its people (Acolyte, Monk, Student)

Certain faiths might have more jobs or split jobs into two. For example, Bahamut might have a group of people who watch for injustice. They might even have a seat in the local governance."
DnD,fffrsol,t3_etdps8,1579890402.0,"If I'm playing:""Actually this is the rule, but ultimately it's up to the DM.""

If I'm DMing and I think the rule bend adds to the game: ""Actually this is the rule, but that's stupid and you can go ahead.""

If I'm DMing and I think the rule bend takes away from the game: ""Unfortunately, that's not how the rule works. You can rethink your move."""
DMAcademy,fffqynx,t3_ete0mg,1579889887.0,"This is a question for the DM. If you are the DM, then it's your choice as little information is given about him in official 5e material. Think about your setting and how religion exists within it. Bahamut is a lawful good, lesser diety so there is probably a good amount of order in the small sects that worship him. I personally would rank it more like a temple than something like a pope-bishop-pastor type deal. 

Each temple has a High  Priest/Priestess. Then come the people devoted to them would be healers and priests. Then the acolytes would serve them. Clerics & Paladins would probably run parallel to them since they have a direct connection to the deity, but not the same duties."

DnD,fekr23m,t3_epod0k,1579205840.0,"This is how I always explain it to new players. The basis of D&D is essentially the following:

""This is a game that follows a simple pattern. I (The DM) explain a scene or event. You tell me what you want to do. I tell you what you need to roll to make it happen. You roll. I tell you the results. Repeat. You have abilities according to the class/race/background you are. They are unique to you. Everything on your character sheet is a tool/ability for you to use to solve problems. Creativity is encouraged.There are two 'phases'. Sometimes we take turns, usually when we're fighting something. But most of the time it's just an open discussion. I'll let you know which phase we're in.""

There are specific rules for everything but the DM has access to these rules if he doesn't have them memorized. Any DM worth his salt will be able to guide you through the game just on the above information as you learn the game through playing."
DnD,fego8ro,t3_ep2s39,1579098566.0,"Playing The Game:
These are the big 3 for playing the game.
-Players Handbook contains basically all you need to play.
-Monster Manual gives you hundreds of monsters to populate the world.
-Dungeon Masters Guide gives you tips, magic items, and guidelines. Useful but not necessary.

Auxiliary Official Books:
These books are made by Wizards of the Coast
-Xanathars Guide to Everything gives you extra class options and spells. Basically Players Handbook 2.
-Volo's Guide to Monsters gives you extra races to play and a bunch more monsters to pit against players.
-Mordenkainens Tome of Foes details the conflicts of D&D and is good for lore/inspiration. Also more monsters.

Official Adventures:
-Starter Set/Essentials Kit gives you everything you need to play for the first few levels. Then you can keep the same characters and bring them to the other adventures. It's really your choice. There is a bunch.

Settings:
The below are all settings for your game.
-Guildmasters Guide to Ravnica
-Eberron: Rising From the Last War

Finally, I highly recommend Kobold Press. Their Tome of Beast gives a bunch of cool monsters and their Midgard setting is super fun and full of flavor and detail."
chemistry,fef6ek5,t1_fef6b93,1579049267.0,Good job. This made my day.
DMAcademy,fczr29y,t3_ejqfdk,1578107162.0,"If I can give some advice, it looks like you have a couple of seperate problems.

1. Encounter Creation. How DnD is made is that the characters must make it through a certain number of encounters of varying difficulty between each long rest, with 1-3 short rests inbetween. This is typically 6-8 medium/hard encounters but this isn't always the case. The difficulty of an encounter is determined by the total CR of the monsters, but CR is misleading and not that good of a tool. Instead, just make a cool encounter that doesn't seem OP or super easy and adjust HP on the fly if things get hairy. Encounter building from a mechanical sense is all about forcing players to use resources (spell slots, hp, items) before the big boss. But more importantly its about fun. The best encounters are challenging, have multiple objectives, show off lore, and are important to the players.

2. Running the Encounter. You need to know the rules. It's fine to rely on the Players Handbook but eventually you need to be able to make split second rules decisions. And you need to know when its okay to break the rules. Also, when it comes to running your enemies try to get into the head of the enemies. Cultists are fanatical and will do whatever best pleases their god/demon, even at risk of their own life. 

3. Time Management. There are a couple of quick rules that make combat quicker:
-The players should be expected to know how their abilities work coming to the session. Try your best to ask questions before the session, not during
-Think about what you're gonna do during other players turn, not during your own. If your thinking for more than 30 seconds, you might get skipped.
-No phones or distractions. Pay attention. Things go quicker this way anyway.

If you have any questions, I'll be here."
worldbuilding,fcz39n5,t1_fcz0qlm,1578092783.0,"I suppose that you could simplify it by limiting it to air and simple decrease the volume of air in a certain area (by moving it somewhere else and increasing the volume there) so that the surface of the mass we are trying to change is exposed to the level of pressure we want. And vice versa. That way all matter and energy is conserved. But that would essentially just be very complex and specific air bending or you could just view it as teleportation of air molecules. 

The temperature would actually remain constant. That's the whole point of manipulating the triple point. 

I think for the purposes of the narrative though, it would be best to just say they can control pressure and the change is offset by an equal but opposite change in the area surrounding the user. Let movie magic be movie magic."
DnD,fcyy1h8,t3_ejmcdf,1578089595.0,"The best thing I ever did was create an overarching plan for my villain. I introduced the character early on as a possible threat but not an immediate one. She was scouting out the tower of the players and introduced herself. Then she sent an invisible stalker to get information on the party. I wrote down every spell, ability, and iten that he knew the players had. I also had the invisible stalker fight the players and run away as a test of their strength. Then I started putting in hints that the local townsfalk in a nearby town they cared about were being watched. Finally in one big climax (right after a big sidequest where they took down a big creature) I hit them with a raid on the town. They chose to run away and then there was this awesome 2 hours or so where they were finding survivors and friends and planning a counter attack. They split up into teams to free certain individuals from a prison and to take on the gaurds. It ended in a final battle where they met the bbeg. When they finally thought they had her they found that she seemed unhurt by her attacks. Guess what: she was wearing the invisible stalker like armor and had people hiding in the second floor. It was a very intense fight and I still hear my players talk about it."
worldbuilding,fcxvi2a,t3_ejhwns,1578071098.0,"Pressure.

Daimonds and gemstones and earth are all created via pressure over long periods of time.

Temperature is not the only factor when determining the state of matter of an element or compound. By increasing the pressure around water you can form ice. So if your character can control air pressure they essentially have free reign over the state of matter. 

Liquids will evaporate at low pressures and freeze at high pressures. Carbon will turn into coal at high pressures. I'm sure there's all kinds of terrible scientific consequences of this to explore."
selfimprovement,fcvj3ob,t3_eixloq,1578003173.0,"I have recently turned to a new philosophy after finally admitting to friends and family how I feel about myself. I have no self worth and often become depressed because I live in paranoia that everyone dislikes me as much as I dislike myself. 

It's as simple as this: Everyday you're gonna wake up and think about the things you've done or haven't done the day before. So do the things today that will make the you of tomorrow proud of the you of today. Sometimes this means doing the dishes as soon as you get home. Sometimes this means engaging in conversation instead of being on your phone. Sometimes this means calling a loved one or doing something that scares you.

I've found that it doesn't make me particularly happy, and it even sucks when I'm doing the hard things. But I don't hate myself either. I like the person I am and it forces me to focus on my own self perception rather than the perception of others. It's just what has been working for me. 

Everyone struggles with self worth and vulnerability. It's wired in our brain to avoid vulnerability. My personal method is to think of all the things that would be left unsaid if I were to die tomorrow. And then I say them. 

Good luck my friend."
selfimprovement,fclbycs,t1_fclbd9j,1577744290.0,"I write a lot so they're probably written down somewhere. But mostly it's just in my head. I don't usually think about my ""values"". Those are more just things that I think are important. I could probably think of others if given more time.

A note on Stoicism: I think it's a great philosophy but I've really been big on balance recently. I truly believe that every religion, philosophy, and person is worth listening to and taking the merits from, but you can't actually get anywhere by listening to just one. 

Thank you for the compliment and the oppurtunity to talk about things that are important to me."
