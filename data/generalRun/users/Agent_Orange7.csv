SandersForPresident,fgu99l1,t1_fgu6ng0,1581115341.0,"Names do not necessarily reflect ideologies (National Socialist German Workers' Party, for example). [Social Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy) is a capitalist driven economy where key industries are nationalized by a democratic government to establish a strong welfare state with significant government market intervention. The goal is to have a capitalist driven economy with a strong government that protects the poor and working class.

[Democratic Socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialism) is a socialist system in which the means of production are primarily or completely controlled by society as a whole. The economy is directed by a democratically controlled government and the socialist system is established by democratic means (as opposed to revolutionary socialism in which the socialist system is established by a general uprising of the working class). Democratic Socialism is not primarily market driven. While in Social Democracy the nationalized industries are the exception while most of the economy is privately controlled, in Democratic Socialism the private industries are the exception in a primarily nationalized economy.

Now those parties in those different countries can call themselves whatever they want, what matter are their policies. Policies in Western Europe are overwhelmingly SocDem, not DemSoc. There are definitely plenty of Democratic Socialists there, but the economies of Western Europe are still primarily market driven.

While the two systems are definitely similar, they are not synonymous. SocDems and DemSocs can definitely work together, and many DemSocs see Social Democracy as a key stepping stone to Democratic Socialism. But they are not the same."

patientgamers,fgqg0z8,t3_ezq5bc,1581023474.0,"I love the way combat was done in dark souls. The controls can be clunky but the concept is incredible. The combination of clearly telegraphed attacks that do massive damage, the ability to negate those attacks completely with well timed blocking or dodging, my own attacks doing high damage, being locked into an animation after starting it, and having to manage a limited stamina pool results in a very satisfying high skill combat system. It’s not like other games where I am just constantly backpedaling away from enemies swinging at them while trying to keep clear of their attacks.

When I get killed, it’s usually because I made a mistake that I can learn from in the future. And when I combine all of this to defeat a strong enemy or boss, it’s an incredible feeling.

liberalgunowners,fgmyzwb,t3_ez1cx4,1580934625.0,"There are two types of rights, positive rights and negative rights. A positive right means the government is obligated to secure that right for you, a negative right means that the government cannot interfere with you exercising that right.

For example, if I have a negative right to life, it means that the government is not permitted to kill me. But they still don't have to lift a finger to protect my life. If I have a positive right to life, then the government is obligated to do what is in its power to protect my life. In American legal doctrine, there really aren't all that many positive rights. The major rights we talk about (free religion, free speech, free press, right to bear arms, etc.) are generally considered negative rights. You could say the right to due process is by its nature a positive right, as the government has to provide that due process in order to deprive you of life, liberty, or property.

Now I support universal healthcare because I think it is critical in improving the quality of life of the average american, which would be one of the primary purposes of government. I don't know if I would argue for a positive right to healthcare. We have to be very careful about choosing positive rights as they put an active burden on government. They require government to perform an action while a negative right requires government to *not* perform an action. Some people do argue for a positive right to healthcare, but that's a different discussion.

What basically no one argues for is a positive right to guns. I strongly support a negative right to bear arms as an absolutely essential right. A positive right to bear arms you would have to make a very strong argument for, as it does put a burden on government."
