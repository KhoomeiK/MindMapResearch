AskReddit,ff870os,t3_es5sb8,1579667800.0,"The knowledge I’d never finish watching Firefly. You’re thinking, “Cthuluhoop, how the fuck hadn’t you finished Firefly? It’s 13 episodes!” But my depression was so deep I couldn’t bring myself to watch it. And at the same time I was (and am) such a geek I couldn’t die with it unwatched. Somehow, it kept me from attempting. 

I got out of it a few years later, when I moved, got better friends, stopped doing things I didn’t want to do, and took up things I loved. I’m no longer depressed, and I want to live more than ever. I’ve also finished Firefly, several times over. But I still haven’t watched Serenity yet. Just in case."

movies,ferp80v,t3_eqgbz3,1579356779.0,"Romance films. I’m asexual, so watching 2 hours of people wanting to bone doesn’t appeal to me. Plus, I hate the hackneyed plots they always do like misunderstandings that could be fixed if they ever talked. That’s not to say I don’t like any romance in films, as it can be done well, but in general I avoid rom-coms and rom-drams and other romance stuff.
