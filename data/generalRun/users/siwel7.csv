Humans have no predetermined path or nature. We have no reason to exist. So in a meaningless world, how can you be useless? You're just useless in a world without use.



Anyway, what are you even *useless* to or for? I'm just saying this because if this becomes your ""mantra"" (aka negative feedback loop) then this *idea*—subjectively defined (even if true)—will repeat itself over and over, impacting your state. These are the power of our words, which impact our thoughts and then shape our reality.
And that's from just an idea you've created in your mind.


Throughout my life I've known ""useless"" people who have no ambition to do anything with their lives at all (i.e. smoking weed all day and not working) change their ways and do things that are ""meaningful"" for them but aren't what I would want for my life. For instance, people have a kid and so their perspective shifts from themselves and moreso looking after the baby—a sacrifice of one's freedom to give one's life meaning? Maybe that's a bit cynical.


I've known people who seem *incredibly* rich and you wouldn't believe the amount of debt/stress/family/relationship issues that go on behind the scenes. This is true in all people, yes, but appearances (what you'd call useless) are not always how they appear.


Maybe clinical depression is causing you to *feel* useless, or something has happened which is now causing you to *feel* this way, but, as above in my opinion, you're not useless."

R.I.P."
TooAfraidToAsk,fcjwacm,t1_fcjk4al,1577707821.0,"I feel your sentiments very deeply... Just feeling like cheap, replaceable labour. But what's the alternative? Well, you could start your *own* business and have people work for *you* instead of literally slaving your life away to make *someone else* money, but personally I'm not smart/creative enough to do that, plus I'm not a people person.



The next option — where I live, at least — is to remain on social security for the rest of my life. It doesn't pay well, but it's manageable on a budget. Problem is that I've been down that road... And doing nothing sucks. So I'm stuck in this place where I don't want to work (who does, right?), but I really don't want to do nothing.



It's so very hard to find your passion (especially one that will support you financially) in life, and even if you do it will most likely lead to diminishing returns: e.g., a lot of my friends *loved* cars, so they became mechanics and now they loathe them.



Don't be fooled by fake smiles and the social media crap—a lot of these people have serious issues behind closed doors (relationships/marriages falling apart, drug addictions, mental illnesses, etc). I think that they've just accepted something that you and I both seem to struggle with and tolerate it with their own coping mechanisms. Who knows. I can only speak for myself.



But yes, this entire experience of existence seems absurd, especially in the current capitalistic world we find ourselves enslaved into."

Speaking from an older point of view (and just from my own experience), a lot of these things tend to become less scary as time goes by. Of course the fears still remain, but life experiences tend to put things into perspective (i.e., if this doesn't work out then it isn't the end of the world.)



Giving up hope for a better past was definitely the hardest thing for me to overcome, but I did it; I no longer care for the time I've wasted partying and money spent on drugs. It's not something that's going to haunt me on my death bed.



What I think matters most is family and friends. Close relationships. I guess that's all we leave behind—the memories we've weaved into other's conception of us... [Check this out](http://www.deathreference.com/Py-Se/Sartre-Jean-Paul.html)"
