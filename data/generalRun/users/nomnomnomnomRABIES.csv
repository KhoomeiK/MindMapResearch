I thought that was odd so I clicked on your link and you have mis-characterised what it says. In short the only figures from the department of housing and urban development in that article are homelessness levels, not projected costs of ""ending homelessness"".

Which is not surprising because you are full of shit. If bezos decided he wanted to buy all the toasters in the world, he could on paper afford to, but in practise it would just increase the demand for toasters and raise their price until he couldnt afford to buy more. Similarly you can't just say "" this many people, need this many houses at current price total is blah- oh look bezos could afford that"" if bezos actually wanted to buy all those houses their price would skyrocket- just like shares do before a takeover.


So it's not that simple and you are full of it. And for the record I'd quite like Bernie to be the next president because he has actual sensible suggestions to address these problems so dont make out like I'm some hard right trump lover just because I'm pointing out you are full of shit."
