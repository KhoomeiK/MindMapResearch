I almost did it, but after the interview when I found out the cost, I said forget it! Crooks smh, I can’t afford it. Gonna stick w/ normal volunteering. Also they made my friend “work” on Thanksgiving night. They are trying to treat them like doctors. Thing is, they aren’t doctors obviously, not yet."

I got physically assaulted (some homeless guy walked right up to me and slapped my stomach). I know it can happen anywhere though. It just made me really hate waiting for the bus for a long time. I’m sure u and other people think UCR is great for it, and I respect that, it’s just in my case, I haven’t been very lucky. Thank you and you too"

I find that going to coffee shops really helps me study for a few hrs at a time w/o stopping. For bio, I make handwritten flash cards from the textbook reading, w/ drawings and all, I find it really helps me. (Gpa 3.81 cause of a B- in an English university requirement writing class 1st quarter freshman year, ik ik I cry; my other grades are A’s tho)"
ucr,fewtyss,t1_fewl16w,1579419458.0,"Hi, I’m just wondering, how is the best way to email a professor about research? I want to ask one of my old bio 5a professors from last quarter. I got an A in the class and he seems to have ongoing research that I find really interesting (he talked about it in class a bit) I’m nervous about emailing him tho, I didn’t go to office hours for him cause it was during one of my labs and I didn’t need help at the time with anything. (I don’t wanna sound pushy or like an annoyance tho)"
ucr,fewp7um,t1_fewjc4x,1579417413.0,"No, not by rank, but by location, where there is better public transportation (subway, more frequent buses to go to further regions), and more jobs/positions, places available for students. Basically a bigger city in my opinion. Now please, this is just my opinion, I understand it’s different for everybody, but in my case, it really is not working out (other than for actual studying/gpa). Of course I don’t mean by rank of the school, actually maybe lower tier is better in some ways, less competition. 
-example: I could not take a job I originally applied as a student assistant/ shadowing for a GI doctor further from campus because the transportation was like more than an hour each way and was not able to fit it in my schedule w/ classes/studying which really sucked (and I can’t afford Uber/Lyft)"
ucr,few8gto,t3_eqqdwp,1579406874.0,"Ok I’m a sophomore so maybe take this with a grain of salt but honestly, it isn’t that good for being premed so far. COPE requires paying $200-300 for “volunteering” (they don’t call them that). Everything I’ve done so far concerning ECs is when I go back home. I volunteer at Cedars-Sinai (the program is similar, and doesn’t cost extra money). My phlebotomy license, I got it back home in the summer. At UCR I cant seem to find anything that sticks. My gpa is high, but it’s cause I spend most of my time studying, I don’t go to parties or do much social stuff outside of my close friend group. I’m trying to do non-clinical volunteering as well, and get a phlebotomy job but it’s really hard here due to transportation limits and not having a car. (I might’ve found a volunteering phlebotomy opportunity tho). I haven’t done research yet but I did apply to a few paid research jobs and didn’t get them (I got so close tho!). I’m gonna try and ask one of my professors about being a lab volunteer, but other than that idk. I am a sophomore tho so don’t take what I say to heart anyway"
premed,feky5rc,t3_epm2qt,1579210034.0,"At my hospital, I’m stationed in an individual unit (big hospital), and go on rounds to check on patients to see if they need anything (water, charger from giftshop, etc) and answer call lights. I get to shadow the nurses as well which is really cool but it depends if the nurses are nice or not, some can be really rude sometimes, but I’m always courteous to them, maybe they’re just having a bad day, I understand that. Sometimes I do end up having not as much to do but it depends on the day I guess."
