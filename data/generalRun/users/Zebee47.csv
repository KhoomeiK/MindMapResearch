college,ff44a9c,t3_erf1yl,1579555215.0,"It definitely is different. Went to a full on uni and was in the dorm earlier in life and now going to CC.

The CC is so big that after 2 years I've never seen the same person twice in one of my classes. Never seen the same person twice walking around outside of classes and only saw the same instructor outside of class once. It sucks because it would be nice to see a familiar face and someone to chat with but every time after the last class they're gone forever.

Also the difference is at CC you go to go to class and that's it, where as at uni you have a lot of students actually living their lives on campus. For a uni student their school is part of their identity, for CC it's more of just a class. For a CC student you probably care less if you had to go to another CC down the street  for whatever reason than if a uni student had to transfer.

As for motivation, you need to start treating school as a job. Make a set schedule to study. Treat this time as seriously as if it's another class scheduled for that block of time.

It's been okay. I first went from 2000-2008. There's been a lot of changes. The kids are nicer but also seem softer. The course  work is easier. It's obviously less rigorous than before. I think it's due to the large number of people now enrolling, lowered standards so they can get more paying customers. The way they run courses has changed as well. There's less lecturing and a larger emphasis on some type of group work. This might range anywhere from having ""discuss with your neighbor"" moments to full blown groups that last all term.

Kinda the same thing with CGI. 90's film is indeed pretty great. Even mid to late 80's. Film makers have decades of tools to use shooting with what they had.

One Pro more unique to Portland is the area around it is geographically diverse and beautiful. You can get to forests, mountains, and the cost from here.

One Con is the laws being passed. My most recent annoyance is the straw and plastic utensils ban.  You go to panda express to get a plate of whatever, sit down....and have to go all the counter and wait and ask for utensils because they can't just give it to you and I think some they tell them they can't even offer it.  You need to ask.  So if you get a McFlurry/Blizzard at the drive through along with some other stuff and get back on the road you'll discover you don't have a spoon and you're fucked. Also the ban on plastic bags and they charge for paper bags. I don't care so much I have to pay for bags it's just that they give the fucking talk still when I don't have a bag on me. I'll have 20 things to take with me and they give me their whole spiel about charging whatever cents and I'm like dude I'm not going to carry 20 fucking things to my car in my arms just do it so I can get out of here.

It's kinda funny because whenever I do come across cash smaller than a $20 now it's sort of like useless paper to me almost. I actually throw it into my junk drawer until I get enough to buy something bigger to use it up or make it worth my time depositing. Having some $1's or a $10 is sort of like having a half used gift card with $4 on it."

Things ranging from gorgeous young women doing poses to doing normal things that humans do but looking good doing it. Their pictures were pretty much what you would expect to find on an attractive persons social media page.

If you're anything like me you hate getting your picture taken and really don't have many pictures to put up and any that you do have sucks. Not saying they'll make you look like a model or anything but I'm thinking they wouldn't be a terrible idea to get some decent pictures  that don't look too forced. They'll hopefully know all the little details people pick up on like that stuff going on with your microwave someone else picked up on because yeah I'm a guy and don't think that was weird."
datingoverthirty,fdoi2we,t3_emcmil,1578605584.0," I think of it like cold calling people to sell a product.  You are the product. Your own picture and profile is your products marketing. If you don't put time into it then you have a shitty marketing. Other womens profiles are potential clients. You can definitely stilil find clients to land a sale for your product but it's going to take a LOT of cold calling and you might have to resort to less desirable clients because your product is all they can afford.

Your opening conversation is your ""pitch"". Your resulting conversation is you making a sale. 

&#x200B;

Some guys are amazing products. They will be handsome, rich, smart, and funny. Their marketing is outstanding because they have a picture of a rich and handsome man and a smart and funny profile. At this point their pitch can be absolute garbage and they'll still get lots of sales. Apple doesn't even need to cold call. They can just walk out on the street throwing rocks at cars and when people come out to scream at them, sell them a set of airpods at a 10% discount. 

Most of us are average products. It takes a lot of time to improve our product. You need to maximize your marketing and your pitch to maximize the number and quality of clients.  Or you can maximize the number of pitches you make by cold calling to get any clients you can."

recruitinghell,fdkxaza,t1_fdin0rh,1578513072.0,">My goal is to eventually be a direct employee of the government or a corporation.

I know exactly what you mean, this is like the top goal of where I'm at now and other people that work in my company. And stop to think about how fucking sad that is. That's basically saying your goal is to have a job. What you said is what people 30 years ago would have considered as having a job. But no, we invented a fucked up purgatory that's better than not having a job but worse than having a job."
recruitinghell,fdkwdvy,t3_elfuo0,1578512534.0,"Been working for 8 years I think in a similar role. I work for a company that contracts out services and they put me at locations where they have contracts. Been at the same place for the last 5.

To be completely fair the contracting company does add some value over hiring people themselves. They can straight up kick you to the street any moment they feel like it with zero headache. I'm sure if you dig you find a few more but this is the one I remind myself every day.

But yeah it sucks. I get paid a LOT less than OPs friend. Raises don't exist.  I mean they DO but they're always under a dollar. You act grateful if it kept up with inflation.  Promotions don't exist.  We've tried to just have our titles bumped up so it at least looks like our careers were progressing some but that didn't go anywhere. The client likes to dangle the idea of getting hired full time above your head but you know it ain't fucking happening. Then you have a friend that just totally clicks with them and they're at the rights place at the right time and they get hired, you act super happy for them but jesus christ does it sting. One day they were your buddy, they were bitching about the company and you were trying to keep them quiet so you guys don't get in trouble.  The next their paycheck increases at least by twice as much and the friendship kinda changes at first pretty quick and in a lot of cases goes away eventually. That's how it is with a lot of the full time employees working with contractors. At first they don't know you're a contractor and when they find out they might say something like ""Oh I had no idea."" but their eyes say something more like ""Oh, you're one of them."" You get this more from people that weren't a contractor themselves. But they know they need to keep their distance. Maybe for legal reasons. Or to help guard their own company. But really it feels like you're a long term visitor at someone else's house even though you might have been there longer than the rest of the family.

I consider myself lucky though. In my first few years there were companies that institutionalized the practice of making damn sure the contractors were below the FTEs. Totally for legal reasons. It's very easy to get fed up and leave those places. This location isn't like that which is why it was much easier to get complacent. But I'm good enough at my job to have a lot of free time to think and all I want now more than anything is to grow personally and professionally and leave."

I'm not a fan at all of long classes. I've taken a few 5 hour classes and they were virtually pointless after the first 2 or 3 hours because your brain is simply numb by that point. 2 hours is the perfect balance of being long and serious but not too long that you're asking too much. 3 hours is fine if the instructor provides a break and isn't super dry."

Back in the day you'd have a forum and it will be full of people from all over. It didn't lean left nor right. Car, photography, fishing, it didn't really matter because it had so many users from so many places that you were bound to have different views. You stayed on topic because you all mutually liked that particular subject the forum was about. There was no up voting or down voting, if you disagreed with someone you'd quote them and respond. Others would get involved and even if minds were changed or not you'd get all the information out there for others to make up their mind. Here if you're disagreed with, you're fucking buried and nobody sees it. If 60% thinks one thing and 40% thinks the other, the 40% will get accused of trolling or brigading.

That's just the tip of the iceberg. I'm sure everyone here are decent in person but jesus fucking christ on here all they ever want to do is 1-up each other. They do it so fucking much that they don't even read half of what they're responding to and they look like idiots. I had someone fucking QUOTE me saying I'm not concerned about something, as in it was quoted in their own response, and responded asking why I'm concerned. And you know what? This person that responded to me was a fucking mod of that sub. I'm not fucking joking. These are the dipshits deciding if your posts should stay or go...they're not even fucking reading most of them.

NFA,fdhnyyt,t1_fdhku69,1578426669.0,"I'm actually more irked at the whole downvoting system on this site which is why I said something about it. Mostly that they removed showing the breakdown of up and down votes. It's manipulative. If you have 1000 upvotes and 1100 downvotes on a post you see that it's fairly split. Showing the total makes it look like there's consensus with 100 downvotes and the post hidden. It's why every single sub is super polarized. 

Also people downvote for the wrong reasons. Go look at threads asking for an opinion and seeing people get downvoted for giving their opinion. If you disagree with an opinion then reply. I've always reserved down voting to people trying to derail threads or are blatantly being an ass. 

With my post in particular it reminded me of times when I see someone asking a question and them getting shot down for not googling it. If you googled it 90% of what you get are people asking the same question and people shooting them down to google it. And the other 10% is the answer but presented in such a way that's too technical for lower level people. It's usually for things like programming. But I've been collecting for 20 years now and I was caught by a silly misunderstanding.  Coming across this issue before hand would have saved me about 40 days waiting.  It's hard getting into something like firearms when you don't know anyone else already into it so all the information you can get from places like these is invaluable."
