If you truly are passionate about others understanding and utilizing fundamentals of brewing - great! I propose taking that passion and offering tools and guidance to others that are similarly interested instead of denigrating the fun and exploration that others are having by trying a different direction. 

Your opinion as stated does nothing to elevate your perspective and only serves to act as a gate keeping mechanism of what ""real"" brewers do. Not helpful or kind."

Get real experience in a high quality GxP environment and the shortcomings are blindingly obvious as to why there is a replication crisis in many areas of science.

The current graduate training, publication expectations, and funding decisions are the primary root causes of the above.

todayilearned,fdbppd1,t1_fdbkjjo,1578259918.0,"I have become so disappointed in the literature since starting grad school. But I see how and why it happens. How many papers are published by grad students with terrible oversight and support from their PIs, where training can honestly be considered a joke (labs in top tier schools where I know committee members and PIs who have not read thesis of their students, through out the entire graduate students career, they get their work published through 'peer review' - which can often times be completed by other grad students by PIs who shoulder the work onto their students - again without oversight or training.) it's a sad farce and I love science yet hate the machine that it is. I will rejoin industry and never look back.

Working in the biopharm industry I have a strong respect for validation and oversight. It is laughable how few (<10-20% by my admittedly pessimistic view) of academic labs could hope to approach industrial standards of reliability and reproducibility."

Police are the 6th most common cause of death for you men in America. They literally just shot up/killed a hostage and surrounding civilians in broad daylight and bumper to bumper traffic in florida. People who testified against the police are murdered outside their homes in Texas.
