HomeNetworking,fcfr5k8,t1_fcflcff,1577632923.0,"Thanks washu_k, I really appreciate your advice and time. I've been roaming the internet in my search for ""the best"" router but whenever I think I find a good option with glowing reviews, I find counter comments completely burning it to the ground. (*worst router ever!*) :)

I suspect Ubiquiti will be a bit over my head. I was actually looking at the R7800. It seems to be pretty universally loved on SNB and elsewhere for its stable firmware, 3rd party FW options, range, etc. Then again, most reviews are a few years old, so I'm wondering if this router still holds up in 2020.

I found an [open box version of the R7800](https://www.ebay.com/itm/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-X4S-AC2600-4x4-Gigabit-Gaming-Router-R7800-New-Open-Box/223613108911) on ebay for $96 which seems like a good deal. Do you think that, despite lacking a 3rd band, it might still be a good replacement for my current tri-band (but unstable) R8000, at least until the AX spec is finalized? Or would it be a waste of money?"
Coffee,fcbm4qy,t1_fcar3t4,1577588445.0,"I also have the Smart Grinder Pro, which I paired with a Bambino Plus that I got at BB&B with a 20% coupon (YMMV). I've been pretty happy so far!"
HomeNetworking,fcaltaw,t1_fc6osrn,1577571787.0,"Thanks u/washu_k. I've factory reset my R8000 to give it another go and seemed to have gotten it back online, so I'm using that for now, although I've started to notice connection drops on some of my devices again...

The Eero Pro looks (and sounds) like a nice device, but I'm frankly a little hesitant to buy a router owned by Amazon. Are there any other good SQM QoS routers you would recommend?

Thanks again, much appreciated!"
HomeNetworking,fc6o6w6,t1_fc6lcp2,1577485275.0,"Oof, did not expect this answer. Much appreciated, u/washu_k. Looks like I'll be returning it. And I might just look for another R8000 for the time being (unless there's another model you would recommend?). Thanks again!

Edit: Interestingly the $399 RAX120 seems to also only have 2 bands, whereas the $549 RAX200 does have 3 bands. Moot point I guess as I will definitely stay away from AX routers until the spec is finalized."
