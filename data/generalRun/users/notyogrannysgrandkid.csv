CFB,ffkq7gv,t1_ffj2tc7,1580026972.0,"When I was a freshman with enough credits to *technically* be considered a sophomore at Boise State, I walked uninvited into Chris Peterson’s office and told him how disappointed I was that he was leaving our school, which would never have any realistic shot at a national title game, and selling out to go to some West Coast school with even later kickoff times and the second-worst possible conference membership for those aspiring to College Football Playoff selection.

Coach Pete didn’t throw me out of his office. He listened to me as if I were the most important person alive. It probably helped that I was wearing my “I beat Coach Pete!” t-shirt from the previous year’s 5K, so he was intimidated by me.

He pulled a chunk of blue turf out of his desk drawer. “Lee Corso stood on this when Gameday came here for our 2010 home opener against Oregon State,” he said, “I keep this as a reminder that we actually peaked the year before that, and that it’s never going to happen for us again. 2006 was a wild ride, 09 was almost as great, but facts are facts: I’m still not over the loss to Nevada in 2010 and losing at home to TCU the year after in the exact same fashion may have permanently damaged my mental health and recruiting abilities.”

We kept sending one another dubious articles about Bronco Stadium expansion plans over the next few years, complete with poorly-rendered 3D architectural concept images. We even shared our mutual disgust at the sale of the naming rights to a grocery store.

In 2019, when he’d finally had enough of Seattle and coaching in general, he sent me a letter on actual paper written in cut out magazine words. It simply read, “haha you loser, I bet you’re still stepping around goose turds all over the BSU campus. I’M GOING SAILING ON LAKE WASHINGTON, BITCH. I’M RETIRED.”

I was just some nobody kid on an in-state tuition academic scholarship who tried to say I was sorry to see him go and I was unsure about the future of our O-line.

Say what you will about his glory days in Boise and his one great season in Washington- he clearly needed a mental health break."

AskReddit,fdjfy0o,t3_elaebq,1578469117.0,"When I was a middle school counselor, I had a kid who was a pathological liar. What confused me and really drove home the pathology of his lies was that he had no motive to tell them other than for attention/praise. They were completely ridiculous things, too, that wouldn’t stand up to even the weakest of examination.

Several examples:

He had played Pop Warner football the year before (6th grade), but tackled another kid so hard he was hospitalized for a concussion. The kid died an hour later in the hospital, so he is now banned from all organized football for life unless he moves to Canada, where they don’t recognize American lifetime bans.

After the Mandalay Bay Las Vegas shooting, he told me his uncle was one of the people killed. I had just met him, and believed him at first. This was in Hawaii, and everyone in Hawaii has at least one relative on vacation or living in Las Vegas at any given time. I asked his uncle’s name, he said it was Richard Something. This one I actually looked into. It took all of 5 minutes to learn that nobody named Richard Something had been killed. I asked him about it, and he said, “nobody reports on when Hawaiians die, because they’re racist on the mainland.”

He once told me his family were mostly Bloods, but they wouldn’t let him join because they were worried he might want to become a Crip one day (because...??) and didn’t want him giving away Blood secrets. Because if you know anything about the LA gang scene, it’s that they’re alive and well in Kaneohe, HI, and that young male members frequently want to change their allegiance.

I eventually had to stop seeing him as a client because I honestly felt like it was a waste of my time. But someone so comfortable with brazenly lying for no real gain cannot be headed toward a bright future. Especially if he’s a Blood aspiring to join the Crips because his football career will never happen."
AskReddit,fdjfc6f,t3_eld4mi,1578468404.0,"Not my story, sadly, but my mom’s. She liked to go to the elementary school about once a month to have lunch with me and my siblings and then stay to volunteer in the classroom for the afternoon. The 4 of us were spaced out such that there was at least one of us in that school for 19 years straight, 1995-2014. By the time my little brother was in 5th grade, that whole school knew her really well.

One day she went to eat lunch with my little brother. They were enforcing “no talking” in the cafeteria that day because apparently the children had been too loud the day before. My mom was quietly conversing with my brother and one of his friends, when a lunch aide came and told the 2 kids that they had to go sit at the Bad Manners Table for talking and asked my mom to respect the No Talking rule. She said, “I think  I’d rather talk to my son,” and followed him to the Bad Manners Table. 

After lunch, she was called into the principal’s office for talking back to the lunch aide. That’s right, my mom had to go see the principal, who explained how important it was for kids to see good examples of adults following the rules and using good manners. My mom shot back, “Well next time you go to lunch with your friends and sit there in complete silence, let me know, and then I’ll be happy to do the same in your cafeteria.”"
