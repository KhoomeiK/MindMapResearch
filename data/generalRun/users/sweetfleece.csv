AmItheAsshole,fdxk9y0,t3_en0d6t,1578769596.0,NTA - but you’re both annoying. What kind of grown ass adults even give a shit about working on their birthday?  Most people do it without whining.  Also maybe she was actually sick when she called in? Or otherwise couldn’t work?

fatlogic,fc7bjnz,t3_eggqix,1577502680.0,">went to the doctor and diagnoses and show I’m perfect

The doctor couldn’t figure out what was wrong, that does not mean they were calling you “perfect”.  This guy wasn’t fat logicky, but it shows how people misinterpret what their doctor is telling them.

Having ok blood work does not mean you are the pinnacle of health."
MurderedByWords,fbuigyo,t1_fbuaq7q,1577114968.0,Fake and boring. All the posts there are just begging for validation and praise. “AITA for trying to cheer my friend up after they had a bad day?”
