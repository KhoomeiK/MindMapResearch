worldnews,ff337u2,t1_ff315zt,1579532516.0,"Without going too far into definitions, at the very least Wiki-ing ""mixed economies"" or ""Nordic model"" will bring up the capitalist argument:

>The Nordic model is underpinned by a mixed-market **capitalist** economic system that features high degrees of private ownership,[29] with the exception of Norway which includes a large number of state-owned enterprises and state ownership in publicly listed firms.[30]

.

>A mixed economy is variously defined as an economic system blending elements of market economies with elements of planned economies, free markets with state interventionism, or private enterprise with public enterprise.[1] There is no single definition of a mixed economy.[2] One definition is about a mixture of markets with state interventionism, referring to **capitalist** market economies with strong regulatory oversight, interventionist policies and governmental provision of public services. Another definition is political in nature and strictly refers to an economy containing a mixture of private enterprise with public enterprise.[3]

Long story short is that you are absolutely, unequivocally wrong. Not that I'm trying to be a douche, I'm just telling you the academic fact. If you want me to try and explain it a little bit... the things you mentioned here:

>steep scaling income taxes, high product taxations, high income taxes, high VAT, regulations on a dairy product pricing, governmental, large income redistributions

are all mixed economy strategies operating under a capitalist economy.

Here's an excerpt from ""Market socialism"" that will probably explain better:

>Market socialism is distinguished from the concept of the mixed economy because models of market socialism are complete and self-regulating systems, unlike the mixed economy.[5] Market socialism also contrasts with social democratic policies implemented within capitalist market economies. **While social democracy aims to achieve greater economic stability and equality through policy measures such as taxes, subsidies and social welfare programs**, market socialism aims to achieve similar goals through changing patterns of enterprise ownership and management.[6]

So what this is basically saying is that government intervention in the free market is social democracy, while market socialism would have to entail social ownership of the means of production. For example, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia."

politics,fegs0sm,t1_fegrwz6,1579101190.0,"III. STAND UP TO ABUSE OF POWER BY PRESCRIPTION DRUG CORPORATIONS

Too many Americans cannot afford their prescription drugs, and prescription drug corporations are profiteering off of the pocketbooks of sick individuals. The Biden Plan will put a stop to runaway drug prices and the profiteering of the drug industry by:

Repealing the outrageous exception allowing drug corporations to avoid negotiating with Medicare over drug prices. Because Medicare covers so many Americans, it has significant leverage to negotiate lower prices for its beneficiaries. And it does so for hospitals and other providers participating in the program, but not drug manufacturers. Drug manufacturers not facing any competition, therefore, can charge whatever price they choose to set. There’s no justification for this except the power of prescription drug lobbying. The Biden Plan will repeal the existing law explicitly barring Medicare from negotiating lower prices with drug corporations.
Limiting launch prices for drugs that face no competition and are being abusively priced by manufacturers. Through his work on the Cancer Moonshot, Biden understands that the future of pharmacological interventions is not traditional chemical drugs but specialized biotech drugs that will have little to no competition to keep prices in check. Without competition, we need a new approach for keeping the prices of these drugs down. For these cases where new specialty drugs without competition are being launched, under the Biden Plan the Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish an independent review board to assess their value. The board will recommend a reasonable price, based on the average price in other countries (a process called external reference pricing) or, if the drug is entering the U.S. market first, based on an evaluation by the independent board members. This reasonable price will be the rate Medicare and the public option will pay. In addition, the Biden Plan will allow private plans participating in the individual marketplace to access a similar rate.
Limiting price increases for all brand, biotech, and abusively priced generic drugs to inflation. As a condition of participation in the Medicare program and public option, all brand, biotech, and abusively priced generic drugs will be prohibited from increasing their prices more than the general inflation rate. The Biden Plan will also impose a tax penalty on drug manufacturers that increase the costs of their brand, biotech, or abusively priced generic over the general inflation rate.
Allowing consumers to buy prescription drugs from other countries. To create more competition for U.S. drug corporations, the Biden Plan will allow consumers to import prescription drugs from other countries, as long as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has certified that those drugs are safe.
Terminating pharmaceutical corporations’ tax break for advertisement spending. Drug corporations spent an estimated $6 billion in 2016 alone on prescription drug advertisements to increase their sales, a more than four-fold increase from just $1.3 billion in 1997. The American Medical Association has even expressed “concerns among physicians about the negative impact of commercially driven promotions, and the role that marketing costs play in fueling escalating drug prices.” Currently, drug corporations may count spending on these ads as a deduction to reduce the amount of taxes they owe. But taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for these ads. As president, Biden will end this tax deduction for all prescription drug ads, as proposed by Senator Jeanne Shaheen.
Improving the supply of quality generics. Generics help reduce health care spending, but brand drug corporations have succeeded in preserving a number of strategies to help them delay the entrance of a generic into the market even after the patent has expired. The Biden Plan supports numerous proposals to accelerate the development of safe generics, such as Senator Patrick Leahy’s proposal to make sure generic manufacturers have access to a sample.

Germany does, in fact, fund its public plan through premiums and not taxes.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK298834/

>Funding through insurance premiums: Health care is financed mostly from the premiums paid by insured employees and their employers. Tax revenue surpluses also contribute. To give you an idea of what this means: State-funded health care systems like those in Great Britain or Sweden draw on tax revenue. In market-oriented systems such as that in the United States, many people have to carry the costs of treatment and loss of earnings due to illness themselves, or have to get private health insurance.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Germany

>In the Public system the premium is set by the Federal Ministry of Health based on a fixed set of covered services as described in the German Social Law (Sozialgesetzbuch – SGB), which limits those services to ""economically viable, sufficient, necessary and meaningful services""
is not dependent on an individual's health condition, but a percentage (currently 15.5%, 7.3% of which is covered by the employer) of salaried income under €54,450 per year (in 2019).[23]

Third, yes the US OOP is higher by absolute value, I know that.

>**For example, Senator Sanders's campaign plan included roughly $11 trillion of tax increases, which could fund more than one-third of Medicare for All.**

>While any new revenue would in part be replacing current premiums, identifying pay-fors still remains a challenge. Enacting this type of Medicare for All would mean increasing federal spending by about 60 percent (excluding interest), and financing a $30 trillion program would require the equivalent of tripling payroll taxes or more than doubling all other taxes.

>Supporters of Medicare for All should work to identify new revenue, premiums, and/or spending cuts to finance new federal costs or else scale back their proposal if they are unable to identify sufficient funding.

The reason why there isn't an according reduction in the total national healthcare expenditures is due to 1. an increase in coverage from 91.5% to ~100% of the population, 2. an increase in the breadth of coverage to include long-term care, dental, vision, and many other luxuries, 3. an increase in hospital visits.

First, the limiting factor for chips isn't competitiveness but production volume. TSMC has 50% of the market share as of 2019 (add another 8% for Vanguard and UMC). Samsung has 20% and GlobalFoundries has 8.5%. If Taiwan goes TSMC isn't going to run in China, and most likely Samsung is not going to sell to China either. In fact probably no one will and ASML certainly ain't going to build any EUVs for China hence pretty much crippling any chances at production of sub-10nm chips. The rest of the world isn't going to make up for that 42% market share either; a foundry takes 3-5 years to make minimum and that's assuming there are no bottlenecks like, again, ASML.

Secondly, as someone who absolutely despises Trump, I have to say the trade war is very successful in crippling the Chinese internal economy. I just quit the Chinese market due getting squeezed out from the trade war. If you see some of the financials companies are bearing right now it'd make a lot of sense.
