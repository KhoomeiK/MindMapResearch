Psychonaut,fc7509j,t1_fc6v9mw,1577497693.0,"Something that has helped me since I've had my ED (egodeath) is the kundalini energy, It woke up inside me when I stretched my broken shoulder (during an intense trip) from a injury I had when I was a child, since then (almost three years ago) I've had a hard time to adapt to the society and coming back working, But I'm slowly starting to understand it and control it with meditation, exercising and change in diet, but still I feel ashamed to seek help."

Psychonaut,fc5zi78,t3_egbnxc,1577469045.0,"I know I need help but I feel ashamed due to childhood trauma, physical and emotional abuse, depression, suicidal thoughts etc. 
Psychedelics has helped me more than any person ever have. It might sound egoistic and lonely, but those who ""helped"" me when I was a teenager didn't understand the depth of my feelings what I've been through during the time as a child, and some of them has only asked stupid questions or said something like ""You overthink or don't worry about it"" bla bla bla.. 

I will probably delete this later because I feel ashamed of even mentioning it."
