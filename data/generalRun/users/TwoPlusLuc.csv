OCPoetry,ffht6fm,t3_etn7lb,1579952627.0,"My interpretation: a young man is sung to sleep by some lullaby. In his dreams he wishes to be with some girl, though the memory of her is vague and dimly lit (with shy candle fire), because she left him a time ago, probably because she died. But he has to wake up eventually, and then he won't be with her again. So when that time comes, he wants to die, so he can be with her forever in the timeless meadows.

It's a lovely sonnet. Very gentle and soothing. It's a clear scene being described, but not overly obvious what exactly is meant. I like it a lot, and the only thing I would change is removing the candle in ""shy candle light"", solely for the rhythm. Well done my friend :)

Edit: I just realized it's not a sonnet xD"

OCPoetry,fexus5o,t3_eqltvf,1579436723.0,"I love juxtapositions and parallelisms, and this one's got a lotta good ones.

""A glass half full is a glass half empty"" is simply amazing. Good rhythm, good placement, fits perfectly with the theme of the poem. Just like ""spilt wine is spilt wine"". Well done.

As many other people have pointed out already, the allegory is a good match with the rest of the poem, so well done there too.

I personally wouldn't use ""loved me *for a second*"", I think there are more elegant words to use, like ""you even loved me for a moment"", or ""you even loved me, briefly""."
OCPoetry,fexcmcd,t3_eqpc4f,1579428704.0,"I thought this was fucking brilliant. With just 4 examples you made a complete image of someone wasting away behind the screens. Every example a different part of the escapism of the subject.

The line: ""as my queen size....of a single pawn"" was also an amazing metonymia. 

The ""clicks"" did add to the poem for me. It's a way to indicate the end of a particular example, and for me it also indicated that some time had passed. The regularity of the click meant that all these examples weren't just a one time thing, but a habit. 

Personally, I wouldn't use the name of a politician/public figure unless you specifically need that person for the poem to work, somehow. Using names takes away the timelessness of the poem, and immediately connects it to the mentioned person, so I would just say ""the president"" or something similar instead of Donald Trump."

# FAQ

# What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your post and Reddit account has decreased by one.

# Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a post to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,

# Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making posts like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

# I don't believe my post deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

# How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right."
