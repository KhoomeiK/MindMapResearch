Coffee,ffmegm4,t3_eu6rv1,1580053353.0,"You would first have to research the process used for producing instant coffee, then try to replicate it your own way.

Here is a shortened version of the process for reference: https://www-thekitchn-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.thekitchn.com/food-science-how-is-instant-co-69158?amp_js_v=a2&amp_gsa=1&amp=1&usqp=mq331AQCKAE%3D#aoh=15800532443182&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thekitchn.com%2Ffood-science-how-is-instant-co-69158"
Proteinshakes,ffmdr8o,t1_ffmaq1k,1580053074.0,I hope the latter is true!
Proteinshakes,ffk1lbv,t1_ffk1io8,1580013016.0,"I use a cup of milk, two tbsp heavy whipping, a small scoop of vanilla protein powder, and a cup of blueberries for the vanilla berry. It's my best yet."
Proteinshakes,ffk1io8,t3_dans2m,1580012950.0,"Chocolate mint, vanilla berry, chocolate pb.
I saw a recipe for a lemon pie protein shake online."
Proteinshakes,ffk1dx0,t3_etjfn4,1580012836.0,I always thought those were actually vanilla pieces. They're in all of my vanilla powders and they haven't killed me or tasted bad!
Proteinshakes,ffk1ayb,t3_el0myx,1580012765.0,I tend to use an automated blender. And a tbsp of heavy whipping cream. Makes a creamy and delicious shake if you have access to these.
caloriecount,ffj7dxa,t3_ets0dh,1579992244.0,"Something that won't fill you up for long is protein shakes. Especially if you add a few tablespoons of heavy whipping cream to the mix. Use a blender for best quality. I use protein powders, but look up recipes. They are great and good for gain."
Coffee,fff1mhe,t3_et7fvh,1579873215.0,"Zojirushi stays hot for 8 hours. I personally make myself a hot french press before work and it lasts all 8 hours. The lid has a lock and a great seal. It is lightweight but very durable, and the mouth shape is perfect. It is amazing overall, 100% reccomend. It's the whole package. Kept my coffee tasting good for my whole shift. Also, it's a great price and is slim enough to fit in my coat pocket."
