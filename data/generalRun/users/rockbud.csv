My bro was being fucked with by a bully in the bus. I was a junior and he was a freshman. This bully was bigger than me. I rode the bus for a week until he did it again. I went in swinging. Even his friends helped push me. I'm not even sure if I won or not.  Bus driver pulled into the police station.

Throwing waves of enemies I already fought isn't worth extra money. Looking at you Borderlands.

Some of the best DLC I have seen was in Far Cry 5. Had almost complete new games. A Vietnam one, Mars one and zombie movie one. All with new maps, guns and assets. Also Assassin's Creed tends to have some good DLC. The Jack the Ripper DLC was refreshing along with the ones for Odyssey that offered a lot of gameplay."
