It's called ""negging"" and it's how  mouth breathing man-babies think dating works. Will it work on some people? Maybe, but you're not going to find a healthy relationship from it.

Maybe she's into you, maybe she isn't. Be straight with her and be confident, and let her know in no uncertain terms you're romantically interested by asking her on a date. Make a joke, tell her hey, you don't need protection with me around. That might be what she was angling for. It might not. If she just wants to remain friends, so be it, have the maturity to move on. If staying friends will cause you pain, let her know and (amicably) cease contact. It's a pointless waste of emotional energy to hold a flame for someone who is not interested in you, for both of you. If it makes it easier, it doesn't have to be final. Give each other space, stop taking overtime in her city, spend some time meeting new people and you will heal in time.

Negging and ""The Game"" might work on some women, for insecure dude-bros who just want casual sex and don't have any real confidence to approach the women they are interested. 

If you genuinely have feelings for someone, well you're poisoning that relationship before it even begins, turning it into a competitive sport rather than a healthy partnership. Best case scenario is she responds to your 'negging' and you end up together. Great, now it turns out she is either needy, shallow and jealous, or just willing to play hurtful games that now there is a precedent for, and will certainly be used against you in future. None of those situations make for a great relationship. One of the worst case scenarios is she doesn't respond at all, and maybe is even delighted that you're taking an interest in other women. That will hurt a lot more than outright rejection, trust me. If you're flirting with other women, you've potentially dragged them into your childish emotional games too. It's a cowards game.

Just be a man, ask her out, if she says no: suck it up and move on, proud in your own maturity and personal growth."

For fellow piano players, another trick I've had success with is using a backwards piano. Not reversing piano samples (though that can create interesting stuff too) but a patch on my keyboard where the keyboard is mirrored, so E is C and C is E, high notes are at the bottom etc.

I've had fun with that both trying to play stuff I know reversed, and more interestingly playing stuff I know well enough from muscle memory as if it was forwards, so the melody is completely different while the rhythm remains the same. Plus just improvising that way makes you realise how specialized your left and right hands are, so now your right hand is holding the steady pulse/chords and the left is trying to come out with melodies.

There's some weirdness goin on with the plant pots where they appear to be lit from the back side, when they should really only be getting global illumination. Perhaps the material is too reflective.

Textures need a lot of work I'm afraid. 

The ground texture appears to be 10 to 20 times too big. Those massive slate chunks would not be fun to walk on, and the little twigs in between look like giant splinters of pallet wood. Either scale down the texture or find a better texture. If you scale down, you run the risk of having visible repeating patterns of stones, but you could break that up with a pathway, grass, and different textures such as gravel or sand.

The wood texture as well is too big and oriented incorrectly, both on the deck and on the white fence. In the top rail it looks like lots of tiny blocks of wood glued together. This isn't an efficient way to build a deck, you would have long horizontal planks of the same thickness as the rail and spindles. 

I would use one long single plank texture (no grooves) for the top rail with the grain going horizontally, with the same thing for the spindles but going vertically. As for the patterned part in the center and end, you will need to change direction again for the horizontal and vertical pieces.
I would recommend splitting it into separate elements and unwrapping UVs on each part, bringing those into a photo editing program and fitting the textures to that as a guide.

The deck itself, again, has the grain and joins going the wrong direction, so it too looks like lego. Unwrap, follow any joins that are already present in the geometry. The ball caps don't need any joins in them, they would be turned as a single block of wood in real life, so texture them accordingly.

The fence has the same problem, texture needs rotating 90 degrees, but the joins will likely be out of place, so either use a more generic, less detailed wood texture, or better still texture each plank separately.

Remember to think in terms of how things are built in real life. With these objects, no offence, but it looks like they have just had a single ""Wood"" material slapped on them and left at that, with no further thought to whether it is correct.

Personally, the chairs, the way they are designed, they would snap like twigs if they were made of wood. Plastic or metal would be a better material to use (and would add contrast), but they could also be wicker around a metal frame, in which case texture them accordingly. That would be a lot of work to make the wicker effect look correct, so personally I would go with an easy brushed metal texture.

That's a lot of criticism, but don't be disheartened, this is a very good start, but the textures really let this picture down and ruing the realism. Read up on some UV mapping guides or videos, look at some photo references, maybe even watch a video of a deck being built to get your mind in the right space, and you can make this scene extremely realistic, you're already half way there."

You can get by just 'feeling the groove' so to speak, perhaps not in classical but most popular music over the last century is practically built on this fact. It will improve your timing to count whenever you can but it's not essential. I play and write progressive rock/metal which you think would require precise counting, and in some cases it does, but for me counting long passages of 13/8 is just impractical (especially with the multi syllabic 7, 11, and 13). If I was to count it I'd break it down to 1234 123 123 123, or whatever subdivision fits the groove, but it takes way less brain power to just feel ""Taka Taka Takata Takata Takata"" and it's much much faster. I can rattle that off easily at 200+ bpm, even out loud if I needed to."

I'll chop up some spring onions or a leek, and fry and egg to go on top. Probably costs less than £1 and is very filling and tasty. Takes about 5 mins including prep to make as well.

I mean they did though. They did a magic trick. They've done a few over the years actually.  Unless you mean people thought that an actual supernatural event occurred, in which case I would put that number closer to 0.99% and most of those will be toddlers. Pretty much anybody these days knows that magic tricks are exactly that, tricks, illusions, ""fake"". Especially anybody watching a show by Penn and Teller where they routinely explain how certain tricks work (usually only to double down and perform a far more impressive trick that they don't explain). The fun is seeing something inexplicable, maybe even trying to figure out how it was done. No one goes into a magic show expecting to see actual sorcery, even people who believe in actual magic."

With real pianos it's basically just on or off, with no in between, so I think they used a plugin. Pianoteque for example has a Mute slider under the Action tab which controls how much the strings are dampened. 

Automate that (or similar dampening control in your plugin) and add a low pass filter that gradually opens and closes over a long period, some hefty reverb, and you should get a similar sound."
