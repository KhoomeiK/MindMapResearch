Homebuilding,fffo44k,t3_esk89n,1579888131.0,Personally seems high to me. I'm in North Carolina and we our builder has quoted $160k for a 1300 sq ft house.
Homebuilding,ff9y05y,t3_esdmbh,1579723946.0,We sold our house a couple of months ago and were made to replace ours outlets with them. Fried my damn router. My microwave didn't care much for it either.
fatlogic,ff9k9od,t3_esd9hw,1579714786.0,"Is there any subreddit where people share their MFP or Cronometer logs and have people give inPut?

Oh and does anyone get constipated when they up their protein intake?"
fatlogic,ff91s44,t1_ff81dzx,1579702704.0,I watched and there is some definite exaggerations. She moved around some but most of the extraneous dancing seemed to come from her backup dancers.
fatlogic,ff5wzeu,t3_ermqnt,1579613039.0,"Sort of off topic but I didn't really get into fashion until I started to lose weight. I used to go and just take pictures of me trying on clothes because I could fit into so many more brands, A bit vain maybe but it was so much fun and I was just so proud of myself."
fatlogic,ff3s1ij,t3_erfoyd,1579547610.0,Only 40% of calories burned in a workout? Well no wonder some people think it's impossible to lose weight and keep it off if they think they can eat back all the calories they burned.
fatlogic,ff3rwh8,t1_ff3eb4p,1579547526.0,The 1500 calories is before the exercising adds 40% more calories to her allowed intake. So if she burned 300 calories in exercise she would get 120 calories extra to eat.
fatlogic,ff3ro8c,t1_ff3dlrk,1579547387.0,"She mentions the ""Fuck it Diet"" book which talks about the Minnesota starvation experiment where the men were put on 1570 calorie diet.

I think that's where she gets the idea that much calories is basically famine."
fatlogic,fez56f8,t3_eqyzqn,1579453958.0,I am sure there are some people that feel that way but not the vast majority.
fatlogic,fenf3dm,t1_fenead4,1579283323.0,"Yeah I sort have that. My range is 140-145. Usually when I get to 145 that's when I lock things down. I just can't get it together this time around though and been hovering around 148-150. 

This week I have been really on top of things though and am now at 144 but the weekend is coming up and that's when good intentions go to shit."
fatlogic,fencdp1,t3_eq1ksj,1579281672.0,"I have a confession, I haven't been my current weight listed for about 7 months now. It's only up anywhere between 5-10 lbs but enough to bother me. The thing is I have gained back this much weight before but I always got myself back to 140 pretty easily. I call 140 my ""happy weight"" and I have always gotten back to that weight within weeks. Like I said though it's been going on 7 months now.

Part of me is like just accept that maybe 140 isn't my happy weight any more, that I am only a few lbs over that weight. But then what's not to say that once I accept that, down the line I will accept 5 more lbs on top of that and so forth. HAES & FA people that say 95% if people who lose weight will regain it all back is what keeps me determined to not let that be.

ETA Sorry if this is an incoherent mess or a bit rambling, there is some kind of disconnect between my well thought out thoughts and writing them down/saying them out load."
fatlogic,femyyeb,t1_fem6sxw,1579273174.0,"They don't believe in food addiction. The ONLY reason people think they are ""addicted"" is because of restriction (or even the thought of restricting)."
fatlogic,fe9slxe,t1_fe9p8vt,1578941109.0,"Her whole IG page is like this with differing, but still obnoxious as fuck, color palettes."
fatlogic,fe9s6sh,t1_fe93zws,1578940984.0,"I saw a more recent one on an eating disorder website, It was talking about how 95% of dieters fail and gain the weight back. The source they chose to back up this claim is for a small study of about 200 people who went on a liquid diet, sort of like you would see with SlimFast. Like no shit people put on a mostly liquid diet would end up gaining back the weight lost."
fatlogic,fe9rec4,t1_fe940x4,1578940849.0,"To this specific IGer, yes. To her all ""The Thins"" needs to sit down and shut up."
fatlogic,fdrr71f,t3_emwphp,1578688448.0,"And of course this is coming from a thin women,"
fatlogic,fd9ue3y,t1_fd9ovex,1578238170.0,I swear I saw some medical office on IG talking about being HAES friendly
fatlogic,fd98g5u,t1_fd97k9b,1578229896.0,I know. I mean sweet Jesus diet (as in the actual definition of diet) is a very important part in maintaining good blood pressure.
fatlogic,fclrf7p,t1_fclqtt7,1577754647.0,"She is uber popular on IG. Pretty much a public figure for the HAES community.  I'm  sure most people on here know her, her stuff is constantly posted on here. Thought those kind of people's names where allowed to be visable on here"
fatlogic,fcljck8,t3_ehu11u,1577749138.0,Dear Mods and any narcs Kristina Bruce is a uber popular HAES instagramer and is often featured on here so I didn't blur out the name.
fatlogic,fclj1vr,t1_fclijyc,1577748943.0,Watching The Office right now haha.
