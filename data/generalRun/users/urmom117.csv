worldnews,fdu2es5,t1_fdu0syg,1578726311.0,It's a pretty good time for the USA to point at iran and show the world that iran is a country that Is dangerous to the rest of the world. It justifies the US killing of their general it makes them look like shit. So actually for the US and current administration it is a very good look. If you hate trump that you will blame him and if you dont than you think it proves his point. Either way objectively it let's the world know that there are still unhinged dangerous countries in the world and that iran can not be trusted under any circumstance

aww,fdth0pe,t1_fdt7k4y,1578716633.0,i mean the fact that multiple dozen people were charged with starting actual bush fires with proof means there are hundreds more people like that. imagine if austrailia had the mindset of reddit and everything was because of climate change and it was everyone's fault. these people need to be held accountable and scouted for. not blame donald trump or whatever makes you sound cool to your reddit friends

IM FULLY AWARE THAT THE US HAS FUCKED COUNTRIES OVER STOP TRYING TO CONVINCE ME THAT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IS THE SAME AS IRAN. yes some people in iran see us as terrorists but did you not see the parades of people celebrating the death of their general? what about their perspective? what about the tens of thousands he killed? what about the west perspective? you know the place where you fucking live? no one said its perfect here but being an apologist for iran in order to maintain fuck trump persona and america bad mentality makes your opinion very weak and flip floppy. every side has a perspective. but pretending you see every side and every perspective just makes you look like a hyper centralist with no concrete opinion other than fuck america and fuck trump but doesnt bring up any other countries atrocities.  your opinion lacks nuance and is just a bunch of shit takes of foreign policy strung together with a hazy point at the end
PublicFreakout,fdlz0l0,t1_fdlyohl,1578535880.0,If you can't see the difference between pence and a life long terrorist than you are hopeless. Pence had nothing to do with SA.

LMAO i saw a video today of her telling iran that we would kill every person in their country to defend our troops. after which she said even though thats terrible to say. sometimes defence is a good offense. but i guess not if trump made the decision because he couldnt possibly make a good choice.
PublicFreakout,fdlxjmn,t1_fdlwkxf,1578534883.0,"Jesus christ I said we are talking about iran. I dont need a lecture in the atrocities the us has committed or is committing.

It may be bad it may be good but go pretend you or reddit is some authority on geopolitics and american intervention abroad is laughable at best. So back to iran which is all I was ever talking about if you want to compare pence to a literall murderer and terrorist go ahead. I dont remember pence killing civilians since the 70s with his own hands but I'm sure reddit will lecture me about it. You forgot something . Pence is from your fucking country. Why do you feel the need to equate him with an iranian general? Why the fuck should we talk about pence dying? Because of some abstract relation that you came up with? There is no equivalent in Iran's military and political structure or culture. Stop drawing lines that dont exist just because you can call pence the same as a terrorist . They attacked our embassy and killed our troops. We are justified to retaliate. If your only response to that is ""well in the 70's"" shut the fuck up. We are dealing with the threat now. I was born in the 90s. Decisions need to be made. Our people need to be avenged or protected. I dont know why it's so difficult for you without talking about CIA black budget shit .

worldnews,fdledxq,t1_fdldnv3,1578522232.0,i criticize trump for many things. it has nothing to do with not wanting people to critisize him. he is very stupid on twitter and with other things. the problem is that people are just labeling america the aggressor when it isnt true. just because trump is president everything that america does or he does is now justification for iran retaliation or at the very least escalation or a bad move. im willing to bet iran is at the negotiating table very soon and from a very weakened state.  trump pulled troops out and the left criticized him for leaving the kurds. we get attacked and trump responds and we are terrorists. its just hypocritical and really undermined the unity we could have as a country

it is not just speculation. tiny holes all over an aircraft over iran airspace after literally falling out of the sky in flames with a brand new aircraft and SR pilot. is extremely suspicious. to the point of it never happening in the history of the 747. so yes its not confirmed . but its far from an alex jones conspiracy"

worldnews,fdlbz13,t1_fdlb4xq,1578520769.0,thanks for your expertise.  they literally just said they are looking for peace and will negotiate. sanctions are literally a bargaining tool and nothing else. do you really think the US is trying to starve iran? iran has no money to make a nuke their currency is worthless. they will be at the negotiating table very soon in a much weaker place than they were a week ago. in the eyes of the world iran is lower than ever and they know it. its funny you believe Iranian propaganda about their nuke program but wont believe in your own countries ability to negotiate.

worldnews,fdl4bzu,t1_fdl49wi,1578516823.0,uh oh promoting violence. isnt that against the rules? BYE
worldnews,fdl46dm,t1_fdl429a,1578516749.0,mods he called me a fascist ban him for personal attack!!! his hormone blockers have made him irrational! ive been attacked by the alt right!
worldnews,fdl3zjg,t1_fdl3n13,1578516656.0,[https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1214157958633811968](https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1214157958633811968) is this you? im sorry your transition didnt go as planned
worldnews,fdl3sug,t1_fdl2kl7,1578516568.0,Yes I forgot you know the reason for everything trump has done because that's just how intelligent you really are. It's amazing. And like the commenter below that literally means nothing and trying to excuse an attack on americans is disgusting and you should be ashamed for downplaying and even borderline supporting Iran's decision to try and kill our soldiers. Pathetic
worldnews,fdl3jsq,t1_fdl3e6d,1578516453.0,I've been attacked ! He called me a nazi! Mods ban him ban him ! He thinks orange man bad!! . You are obviously a very mentally unstable and underdeveloped person and I hope someone in your life gets you the help you need. I feel sorry for you
worldnews,fdl3au9,t1_fdl2hk7,1578516331.0,Awww little baby had his feelings hurt by the bad man who called out his stupidity. Aww call mommy you've been attacked! Lmaoooo the true face of the left
worldnews,fdl2edv,t1_fdl22p5,1578515894.0,Ban from what? Losing brain cells from you? I appreciate it
worldnews,fdl1vo8,t1_fdl1o8p,1578515613.0,Ummmmmmmmm iran attacked a US embassy which is american soil they killed an American citizen and murdered thousands of their own people. Let me guess. Their general terrorist life is worth more to you than American innocent life. And the lives of all that he killed before he was taken out. Imagine being as stupid as this but calling other people stupid.  Your 2 brain cells are showing
worldnews,fdl1h01,t1_fdl19ig,1578515400.0,im not a trump supporter. just because i agree with his no escalation? lmao imagine being mad at trump for NOT going to war. reddit echo chamber at it again. the more time i spend on here the lower the people who talk to me's IQ are you are scraping the bottom of the IQ barrel.
worldnews,fdl16qk,t1_fdl10ry,1578515252.0,says guy who gave zero evidence or argument and linked to an unconfirmed article. lmao imagine telling someone they know nothing while giving zero of your own information. ignorance is bliss i suppose. go back to r/politics dumb fuck
worldnews,fdl0wne,t1_fdl0rto,1578515102.0,I never claimed to be a source. You did. I never shared a source. You did. I gave my opinion and the opinion of most others. Never claimed otherwise. Surprised you can even talk with Iran's cock so far down your throat
worldnews,fdl0oim,t1_fdl09cp,1578514982.0,"I never claimed that the ""west"" officially thinks one way or the other. You did. Most experts and even Ukrainian sources are highly suspect of this. I said it's an opinion. Again if the 747 blew itself up and crashed immediately severing all communication it would be the first time in history. If you can't handle that than I'm sure there is a safe space somewhere on reddit for you to go to"
worldnews,fdl06l8,t1_fdl01w7,1578514721.0,One paragraph from unknown source does not mean anything
worldnews,fdkwzzm,t1_fdkwucl,1578512895.0,ah yes i forgot when trump was president in 1970. and withdrawing from a deal we felt was unfair does not excuse terrorist acts by iran. stop sucking irans cock because orange man bad it makes you look stupid as fuck
worldnews,fdkwqsn,t1_fdkwj1h,1578512744.0,"hmmm so if trump doesnt like a deal we are in. which arguably it was a bad deal, that makes him at fault for iran killing US troops ,thousands of its own citizens, attacking a US embassy and taking british sailors hostage and shooting down 2 drones over international airspace. right seems like perfect logic."
