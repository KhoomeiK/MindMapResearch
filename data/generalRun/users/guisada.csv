AskReddit,fevmy38,t3_eqpghs,1579399192.0,I'm a male. I'd take the quiet life for sure. I love solitude. I love low key and quiet. I'm really pretty introverted. I have to force myself to be more outgoing during work hours but as soon as I'm away from work I just want low key quiet. I don't have the need for attention or a crazy active lifestyle. Honestly I think depression plays a large part in it.
