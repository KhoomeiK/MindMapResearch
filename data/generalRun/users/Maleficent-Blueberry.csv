selfimprovement,fent8il,t3_eq0f17,1579290460.0,I think a lot of us are too critical of ourselves sometimes - like you said - trying to perfect everything when in reality it’s impossible. I read an article recently where a lady spoke about how she would have piano lessons - she wasn’t great and didn’t improve greatly but she didn’t stop learning. She continued because she enjoyed learning and having the joy of creating music. I found it interesting as a lot of us would probably give up but I liked how she explained that she didn’t mind being bad at playing piano as it was something she enjoyed.
Mindfulness,fds4uru,t3_eite10,1578694392.0,Thank you for posting about this book. I downloaded the audio book a few days ago and it’s been particularly helpful with putting things into perspective. I can imagine with how the audio book reads it would be difficult to read as written text but seems good as an audio - being able to hear the question/answers as conversation.
Mindfulness,fdho2de,t1_fdb2unk,1578426725.0,Thank you.
Anxiety,fdhaekh,t3_el9qr2,1578418829.0,I get numb hands when I’m really anxious. Recently (as a result of the anxiety) I’ve started getting pains in my hands...to the point I’m having to massage them to make them feel okay. Not to mention leg pain as well. I guess when it gets bad it pops up in your body too.
Mindfulness,fdg8va1,t1_fdg7ytw,1578384990.0,This is what I’m trying to do. Back to work this week after the holidays so trying to focus on work and myself. Gotta find a balance so I don’t get overwhelmed I think. Thank you for your supportive messages. Appreciate it x

Mindfulness,fdemd0r,t1_fdehbn8,1578342069.0,Thank you for your message. It can be very hard to look at the positives right now but I am trying. Thanks.
Dreams,fdef2mv,t3_ebl4r7,1578337629.0,So I’m going through a bit of a hard time at the moment. Dealing with a break up which I’m finding really hard to come to terms with. I’ve not been enjoying sleep recently as I’ve been having lots of lucid/vivid dreams that have left me feeling unsettled. Last night/early this morning I dreamt that I could hear the song - the circle of life - from the lion king. I woke up not long after and had the song playing in my head still. I can’t remember the dream itself but the song was definitely playing. When I woke I felt a sense of calmness. How can this be interpreted?

depression,fda4th9,t1_fd84e80,1578241678.0,Not great to be honest. Just trying to push through each day. Thank you for your message.
Anxiety,fcvu9ul,t3_ej6i84,1578010248.0,I was the same when I took my driving test...several times. My anxiety would really act up. What I would recommend is just to imagine it’s like a normal driving lesson. Drive how you would in your lessons. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself. Maybe do some guided meditation before leaving.
depression,fcish75,t1_fcib3u3,1577668746.0,I did. After giving him some time...he came back to say that he was ending our relationship. Hope things are okay with you xx
