Excluding the 25p, it's a max of $30.40 payable in <£1 coins, making my hypothetical fine's count 226 rather than 256. Still a good hour's work for the sour lump usually found behind the counter."

>1p - for any amount not exceeding 20p **(up to 20 coins)**

>5p - for any amount not exceeding £5 **(up to 100 coins)**

>20p - for any amount not exceeding £10 **(up to 50 coins)**

>£1 - for any amount **(£10 min but break-even at £50, 10-??? coins)**

I've sorted out which combination add the most heft and counting effort, assuming you can't mix coins within each bracket of maximum accepted amounts (20p, £5, £10) . Bold added for fee brackets to provide maximum annoyance/£ of fee. Shame about the slump between £10-50 in the counts.

Now, if you can mix coins, then it's just a matter of subtracting down to round numbers for the next largest denomination while using the most lower-denomination coins, first with 1, 5, 10 and 20p coins, then 25p and finally £1 coins once your total fine exceeds £40.40, the maximum possible with those <£1 coins.

For example, let's say you've got a randomly-sized BS fine of £38.61. 

If paying with the fewest coins possible (using £20, £10, and £5 notes), that's only three £1 coins, two 25p, one 10p and a lone 1p. **Only 7 coins**, far too easy and lightweight.

You'll want to pay like so: 11p in 1p, £5 in 5p, £5 in 10p, £10 in 20p, £10 in 25p, and £8.5 in 50p coins. Total count: **256 coins**. Much better.

I'll have to see if there are such laws here, it'd be nice to serve back a fraction of the frustration for ticket-happy operators in as generous a portion as I can in that situation.

Edit: Realized I had the maths wrong for the total possible mixed amount, adjusted."

That's it. No one's gonna be exceeding the max allowable COR, and the good manufacturers are pretty much equally close for distance given that. Forgiveness, feel, sound and aesthetics are all important on a personal level, but they don't necessarily gain any yards in a head-to-head comparison when swung by a reasonably skilled player that's striking near the sweet spot consistently anyway.

The odd part is that Mizuno doesn't make putters for or in north america - only for japan. They partnered up with Bettinardi for a while to make some for the US market and there are some even older older styles that might've made it here, but none seem to match this one.

It's a really unsettling thing to realize for a while - my first car was so easy to get into (and the door lock so crappy/prone to freezing up) that I eventually just carried a ~3"" L-shaped piece of wire on a keyring in my wallet, the right size to pull up on the lock button arm with from between the glass and rubber - figured that one out when I had the inside panel off once and saw the lock mechanism. But, that was a beater worth roughly 3 months of gas for it, not a GT lol.

With my current car (98 volvo coupe, some work done), I've locked my keys in the trunk with both windows cracked open and the sunroof set to vent. No luck at all. It turns off the door locks, windows, sunroof and trunk release when it's locked and the hood latch cant be reached like yours. Once in the car though, I know enough to drive away with only a flat screwdriver and a small file without damaging anything that can't be put back in 2 minutes.

>It does have to be those 2 specific pins or it doesn't work.

That's exactly it, the other 2 pins are the trigger circuit and would need power across them to turn on the relay like normal, but it seems that they left the motor's circuit always live and stuck that relay in a really poor location - if it was inside the car that method wouldn't work. If you wanted to fix that permanently you could remove/snip the wires for the relay from the fusebox, solder on some extensions, go through an existing grommet if you can, add spade connectors and stick the relay under the dash in the cabin with a ziptie and some foam. You would lose a pretty handy ass-saver, but it's not an awful tradeoff."

Yeah that was it sorry, you're otherwise right though it works - he pulls out and bridges a relay and not a fuse (the little colored ones are fuses, big blocks are relays). It's basically a switch for whatever circuit it's on, and connecting the right 2 pins of one does make it work (on any relay, it skips it basically), and it looks like it doesn't even disable it when the car is locked, like my 1998 car does.

You're just replacing a specifically-thin wire with a paperclip-thickness one, it physically can't power a circuit and pop a trunk because the resistance across the fuse changed. 

You'd need to bridge 12V power from battery/an always-on circuit from another fuse to the signal wire (momentarily) of the trunk circuit, somewhere between the motor/its circuit and any control modules/buttons or relays it uses to trigger it. Signal wires like that don't have fuses, much less in the engine bay.

UltralightCanada,fcck3fk,t1_fcc9r9d,1577599304.0,"Probably comes down to your own sweatyness levels and tolerance for colder/wetter travel. I sweat a fair bit so my feet did feel damp in bags, but still definitely not as wet/dirty as they'd be without them. They are also slick as ice, so your feet will slip around in the shoe which can get uncomfortable after a while, another point for gore-tex there. Please report back after the tests for how you liked the gore-tex units, my reading on them made me more curious than I was."
UltralightCanada,fcbwlao,t1_fcatuwi,1577591773.0,"It works well above zero, but for near-freezing temps I've added a third pair to switch to at lunch so my feet don't spend too long wet/cold (at <=5 degrees depending on weather), and put the worn ones on the outside of my pack if there's enough water to get the sludgey mud rinsed off then. But, I've also fallen over in the mud with that setup, had to wash the socks in a river and deal with little bits of grit in there for a long day, your luck might vary.

Haven't tried goretex socks, but I have used breadbags for work boots before. Worked brilliantly to keep dry with 2 exceptions - sweat buildup if exerting yourself, and if any water got splashed or made its way in the best I could hope for was that just the top of the sock got wet. I can see goretex having a bit of breathe-ability (but probably not a lot if it's wet/dirty on the outside of the membrane), but also being possibly prone to abrasion/pinhole failure from any grit between the shoe and sock, though I see some pretty good reviews for them on MEC for people in rough-enough conditions. Otherwise, I'm thinking something like a thin 2/3mm neoprene sock would be the strongest solution for cold/very wet/flooded trail, with a thin wool or poly sock underneath. Again, haven't owned a pair yet (don't know why frankly) but I've worked with some guys who had thicker neoprene socks for wet outdoor work in winter and swore by them."

UltralightCanada,fcast0b,t1_fcapct2,1577575909.0,"That sounds like it'll be fine, the temps being low enough to wear long sleeves if needed is a nice bonus. The altra gaiters (trail runner?) look like they'll do fine for keeping 90% of it out (some might push in on the sides with an unlucky step and need picking out), though as another poster mentioned you're probably gonna be hiking in wet socks a lot, and with high humidity/colder temps they'll be slow to dry. 

Personally, I just make sure they're wool and trudge on until camp where I'll switch, rinse the worn ones off if needed (some of the swampy lowland water smells... interesting), roll them into a pack towel/wring out a few times, and hang them to dry off (read: stay a bit damp) till morning where wearing them before setting off gets the rest.. until I hit the first puddle in 15 min or so. That second pair for me is a dedicated sleeping pair, at least for extra-dirty conditions."
UltralightCanada,fcaocjp,t3_egx6n5,1577573282.0,"Yup, you'll want the ursack or bear can - black bears aplenty in all 3 locations. Either is fine (there's no requirement as far as I know, hangs in a basic drybag/small barrel are the most common I see hiking mainly a little south of 2 of those except killarney), but given the season and trails I'll near guarantee you'll encounter them in some way.

Depending on the timing of the spring melt, you might see a few mosquitoes (even blackflies in may, nowhere near the late june-aug hellscape), but mainly I think you'll encounter some very wet, muddy conditions in parts. I'd personally add some small gaiters to keep the crap out for when a solid-looking section of trail is actually completely waterlogged and mud 6"" deep... which is a fair bit early in the season, IME."

CampingGear,fc4r6lj,t3_efyv5h,1577425427.0,"If you can plan your trips out around the weather, that can do just fine with a light tarp strung over it for shade/light rain.

I sometimes use my car camping tent like that - no fly, large-ish silnylon tarp over a ridgeline/wide-A a foot or 2 above the tent. The fly has awful ventilation and is a sauna in summer, but the inner is excellent with a non-fly tarp. Makes it usable in summer temps, and if you pull the tarp down so it's touching the poles it can handle light rain if it's not windy."
Hammocks,fc0nnrd,t3_efivs7,1577295364.0,"Get a better carabiner, besides that that one has now lost at least 2/3rds of its strength and is a bit sketchy to use. That metal is too soft, and a higher-quality harder one wouldn't grind away like that. Any coating you put on is gonna be worn through in seconds since all the force goes to a tiny area.

Using some nylon/poly strap would work (if thinner, since it's mounted to tightly rounded things) but would probably drop your hammock down a few inches for the added ladder-lock/other removable fastener."
