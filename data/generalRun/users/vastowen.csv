AskReddit,ff4trp9,t1_ff3voa3,1579572255.0,"I have two reoccurring dreams, since my childhood. Well.. Reoccurring nightmares. I have one every few years. One of them is me and my dad defending our home (wherever that may be at the time) from nondescript people in black cars. Usually my dad gets shot and I woke up, but the last couple times we put up a good fight first. The second dream is about my mom and me as a child. As a kid my mom was always laid up for some reason or another, in bed or on the couch. I dreamed that there were all kinds of animals and insects besieging our house, but the animals couldn't get up on our (raised) porch. There were swarms of insects always flying around, into the house etc. Anyway, the dream is I have to go get something important from the storage shed and bring it to Mom. The storage shed is, naturally, about a hundred feet or so from the porch. The animals besieging us I best remember is hippos, rhinos and tigers for some reason. Scary shit"
