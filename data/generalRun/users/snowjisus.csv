bjj,ferzoqn,t1_ferug4j,1579359955.0,"Thank you so much for thoughtful response! I will plan accordingly and keep tabs on how I am feeling performance-wise along the way. Helpful advice on not doing a water cut too!

For the past six months have done 4 hrs of bjj, 4 hrs of Muay Thai, and 2 hrs of strength / cardio training per week. At 36 though, it’s been wearing on me so have cut out Muay Thai and reduced strength training to 1 hr per week.

I mostly use kettlebells (swings and Turkish get ups), body weight (pull ups and push ups), and cardio (rowing machine, stair climber). Do you think that is sufficient for maintaining my muscle/strength while losing weight?"
aww,fere3lq,t1_feqxd8x,1579352810.0,Wow I didn’t see it until you said it but spot on!

instantkarma,fdwj3i5,t1_fdwhj0r,1578759188.0,I thought this qualifies as instant karma since she is getting immediately caught and called out on not putting her cart away. Mind clarifying?
Instantregret,fdngcpo,t1_fdnefc2,1578585220.0,Agree. The way he was talking and moving even before he got hit definitely suggests he was drunk.
