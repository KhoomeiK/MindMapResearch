This solution is in an unfinished ceiling, so to do to a finished ceiling will require some drywall patching around the hole. As other users have pointed out, if appropriate bolts are used, vertical mounting could be done, but for that mounting bracket in the OP the screw holes are too small for an appropriate bolt"
howto,fcoptou,t3_eibabm,1577838368.0,"This is how I've mounted similar in my basement. Mind you, this exact solution is over-engineered, and requires access to your ceiling members. If the mounting screws used aren't intended for a load-bearing vertical mount, then hanging all the weight by threads is likely to rip those screwholes right open. This solution uses angle iron and framing bolts. There are certainly more appropriate solutions for a finished ceiling, but I have no experience in mounting a load-bearing object onto a finished ceiling."

Then news broke that the sig 320 isn't drop safe, I traded for a Glock and then it became second nature to carry chambered, with no safety to speak of. I think it's important to stress how innefective an unloaded weapon is, but also to give time (and training) for the nerves to wear off as they get comfortable with it."

 But seriously, I try to set milestones on my calendar, breaking down the project into smaller steps and trying to get them done incrementally. I put the next due milestone on the top of my to-do list every single day, and for some projects, I just tell friends/family about it, and ask them to nuisance me about my progress. Can't say it's the best system, honestly I'm only any good at long-term planning that has to do with work, very difficult to find motivation without a paystub attached"
