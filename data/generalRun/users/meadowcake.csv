I mean have you seen him shirtless??? Not to mention he’s tall as fuck. Also the way he carries himself- he’s not arrogant or disrespectful, he doesn’t need to overcompensate for anything- he just oozes raw power and sex without even thinking to show it off, it’s his natural self. He comes off as intelligent and gentle yet there’s this mysterious undercurrent of a primal and unpredictable aggression that comes through in his acting... need I go on? Do you get the point yet? Men have no idea what women really want. I don’t think even Adam Driver himself is aware of it."

It's easy to forget when you're wrapped up in your own pity party but please don't take your listener's needs for granted indefinitely. They may say it's fine because they worry about burdening you, but emotional labor should never be one sided, nor should it be expected to be a free and inexhaustible service no matter how brave a face your supporter puts on for you. It's important to ask for help when you need it, but please offer to pay it forward if not back when you're able."
