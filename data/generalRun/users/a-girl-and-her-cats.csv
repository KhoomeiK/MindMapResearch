cats,ff5nnrf,t3_ernmx4,1579602034.0,"What an adorable sweetie pie. I'm so sorry for your loss. 

Losing special animal persons in our lives will always be painful. I do hope that, if there is such a thing as Heaven or a peaceful afterlife, it will be where we can meet up with them again after they left us on Earth.

I wish you and your family all the best in your recovery."
suggestmeabook,ff5nfyw,t3_erei0j,1579601704.0,"I second many of the titles that have been mentioned in this thread. Another short story collection that is absolutely wonderful is *The Things They Carried* by Tim O'Brien. Also, the short story ""Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?"" by Joyce Carol Oates is a masterpiece."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fek0xdp,t3_ephs02,1579190245.0,What beautiful antlers!
cats,fek0qnz,t3_epi5jh,1579190131.0,Little gold nugget indeed! What a cutie! <3
suggestmeabook,fejkge3,t1_fejii30,1579177889.0,You're welcome! I'll add other titles if I remember any.
suggestmeabook,fega0mk,t3_eoy5pm,1579084263.0,"I  love historical fiction too! Historical fiction books that I consider as favorites are Markus Zusak's *The Book Thief* and Anthony Doerr's *All The Light We Cannot See*. They're both set in Europe (Germany and France) during the Second World War.

Another really good historical fiction book is *When The Emperor Was Divine* by Julie Otsuka, which touches upon an Asian-American family's experience in American internment camps during the Second World War. I also second the recommendation of Madeline Miller's *Circe* and *Song of Achilles*.

I hope at least one of these sound interesting to you!"

AskReddit,feg9hu9,t1_feejp5c,1579083523.0,Exactly. Only one of the many reasons why I'd call her.
AskReddit,feg9gsl,t1_fedlv9j,1579083482.0,I second that! Elle Woods!

AskReddit,fdq6rob,t1_fdmwf5f,1578657299.0,"Same! I liked to roleplay in the RP Forums, and still do. But I hate how work gets in the way of that more often than not."
suggestmeabook,fdjompw,t1_fdi44y6,1578481091.0,"YASS! Margaret Atwood's writing is amazing! The first book I've read by her is *The Penelopiad*, before I read *A Handmaid's Tale* and *The Testaments.* I also find her poetry (from what I have read, anyway) intriguing.

I'm currently reading her collection of essays ""In Other Worlds: SF and the Human Imagination"" and I love the way she explores the issues and her relationship with the science-fiction genre."
AskReddit,fdjo3rj,t3_ell2h8,1578480355.0,"My parents weren't helicopter parents but my brother and sister-in-law seem to be exhibiting helicopter parent symptoms on my two-year-old nephew (like they have never left him alone with anyone, not even my parents). I just hope that, once my nephew starts school they'll be able to step back and not smother him so much."
AskReddit,fdjnnrm,t3_elbejj,1578479729.0,"My dad's favorite saying seems to be ""Beggars can't be choosers!""

Yes. Of course. Someone being in a vulnerable position of any kind gives you a great excuse to dangle that reminder over their heads, exploit them, and/or take advantage of them, doesn't it? \[/sarcasm\]"
