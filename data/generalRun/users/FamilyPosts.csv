But some veggies eat a pretty poor diet...crappy processed food, sugar, etc...(I speak from experience). Maybe you'd like to have more blood tests done (metabolic panel, B vitamins esp B12) or others that a DR might recommend. There's a ton of info online about a healthy diet/ lots of leafy greens and a colorful variety of fruits/veggies with a close eye on making sure you are getting proper protein and other nutrients etc."
dogs,ff3o3ja,t1_ff3fbyh,1579545198.0,Monthly fungicide treatments until there was no evidence of disease. Under anasthesia. We went to a teaching vet hospital. Please note that this is rare. I hope your dog has something easier to treat. Good luck!
dogs,ff3dphd,t3_erfj7s,1579539031.0,Don't want to alarm you if not needed. I have only anecdotal information to share. Our Border Collie mix had nasal aspergilosis. It was misdiagnosed by several vets who even put him under anasthesia and scoped. It wasn't caught until we saw a specialist. We were told it happens most frequently to breeds with longer snouts. A foxtail can be the culprit.

 If you have any agility training classes near you maybe check them out and talk to the more experienced trainers.

dogs,ff16pkz,t3_eqzsq8,1579475771.0,Do you have a no kill shelter where you live? That's a last ditch option. Some vets will help if you have no money and ask nicely. Call as many as you can until you find someone willing to help. Don't wait.
dogs,ff103oy,t3_eqzs33,1579473952.0,All good suggestions here. Sleeping bag? I would be worried and would be checking on her through the night. It might help her to know she isn't alone. It's illegal in my state to leave a dog without food/water.
dogs,ff0xl2p,t3_er0r8j,1579473299.0,If she gives it the 'eye' it could be instinctual and hard to break in a herding dog. Put it away when she's there? Or bring her somewhere to see if she'd enjoy being trained to do actual herding (big commitment).
dogs,ff0tmkm,t3_er09c4,1579472169.0,"aah, it seems like fate. Any decent shelter would have tested a dog for aggressive behavior by now, resource guarding, is good with kids, dogs, cats etc . When I call our local shelter they have a run down of each animal and their temperament. I agree with whoever said bring your dog and meet in a large area. If you have the shelter dog's scent on you share it with your dog beforehand. Possible multiple escapes might mean (also) that this dog is an escape artist that needs extra watching."
dogs,fdl6jzd,t3_elmrg3,1578517904.0,I'm sitting here with tears streaming down my face. rest in peace sweet Apollo. We lost Buddy 2 weeks ago to cancer. I've been watching videos of people being nice to dogs and crying. Every time someone speaks about him I cry. We washed his bedding and lit candles near his photo display and talk about him...remembering his habits and things from the past. Still in shock a bit...look into the room where he liked to sleep and still expect he's there...or have a sudden feeling that he needs something. I see other dogs but still just want him. Time will heal.
AskDocs,fdaffvl,t3_ekcqos,1578245491.0,I ave no medical background beside my own experience as a patient. Do you trust her primary doctor or would you like someone who is more of an advocate? Do you (or someone in your family) accompany her to all appointments? The primary should be overseeing her case and making referrals that lead to improving her health. Are you near a large medical center? Do you have adequate insurance to go to other doctors? I hope the best for your mom.
