RocketLeague,ffijlmn,t1_ffie1rf,1579975422.0,"Seems to me it would make sense to only allow groups to play other groups of the same size. A group of 2 can queue for doubles, but not 3s, so on and so forth.

I've played a little over 400 matches, and I've never had a team of 3 solo queues beat a team of 3 in a group. They're grouped for a reason.

Solos always play solos, and groups always play groups. I think that makes a lot more sense and wouldn't affect queue wait times all that much. It would also affect people's decision to group in positive ways."
