assassinscreed,fd7xcgj,t3_ek49tz,1578211415.0,I doubt it will ever come or if it does a good amount of time because I think it would be so similar to odyssey because Roman myth came from Greek myth but also I think they might try to pack to much into a certain amount of time because we see that the events of odyssey happen very close to the events of origins

I know break point was a pile of hot garbage and I not sure about far cry 5 . But no it would not take an 180 they have more than enough tools to make a award winning game and they could do it with some hard work and no cutting corners ( which they do have a problem with that they want to fix with a patch) especially with the new series of consoles coming out they could make the graphics even better than they already are .
