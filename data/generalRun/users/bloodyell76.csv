LetsTalkMusic,ffggctq,t3_et9tnc,1579905611.0,"I work concerts as a job. And I feel I should point out that the people who *aren't* playing live are the minority. Tonight's act will be all live, next week's act will be all live, and in fact the next gig I'll be doing that I know *won't* be all live will be Hatsune Miku... which is understandable since Miku is *literally a computer program*. That one is months away still. It's really the realm of pop stars whose concerts involve a lot of timecoded audio, video, lighting, and other effects, and often complicated choreography performed by the singer themselves. Since doing a lot of those dance moves *and* singing on key (or even at all) is impossible, you'll often get a recording.

But again, they're actually the minority. I'd say less than 5% of the bands I work with use backing tracks. And frequently it's not a major element of the music, just extra elements to flesh out the sound of the live band. So while I prefer things to be as live as possible, even if it means not sounding like the album (in fact *because* it won't sound like the album) it is thankfully not often a problem."
marvelstudios,ffg5ebc,t3_etg6ba,1579898826.0,"People joining a cast, unless they're announced as specific characters, means nothing. They *could* be playing these characters... or other characters. Or new characters. It's as flimsy as the youtube video I saw recently that basically hung the whole idea on the fact that Baron Zemo is in it.

I will say one thing though, that same video did have a couple other points, related to Black Widow and the MCU overall. point one is that there is now no Avengers as any kind of coherent unit. But the need, or at least the apparent need for such a team has not gone away. And so ""Thunderbolt"" Ross just might decide to form a team that's accountable to the government. My opinion is that USAgent would make a lot of sense as a new ""Captain America"" (possibly literally at first) fronting this team.

TLDR: Thunderbolts is definitely a possibility, and would make sense narratively with what we know. But actors joining the cast of a show confirms nothing, regardless of how well they might fit a particular character."

musictheory,ffel0n8,t1_ffekmre,1579852499.0,mostly I'm thinking back to jazz fest instances where *every* song from some quartets is Head- sax solo- piano solo- bass solo- drum solo all playing chord and scale figures as fast as they can (well except for the drummer) with the only exceptions being where the piano takes the first solo rather than the sax.... it started to make me wonder why they bothered playing different songs when all tunes sounded the same in their hands.
marvelstudios,ffektc4,t1_ffeiwii,1579852239.0,"agreed. ""possible Mordo plot"" was always in the 75%+ likelihood range. I cannot bring myself to consider ""extremely likely plot focus"" to be a ""spoiler""."
LetsTalkMusic,ffekj5p,t3_esxn0x,1579851874.0,"Yes... but my opinion of what might be a given band's ""best"" album might not be the general consensus opinion.

So let's take Tom Petty. Not really a fan, but definitely understand why his fans like him. My favourite tune is ""Good Enough"" from Mojo. Which is not an album generally considered his best, and not a song on any hits collections. On the other hand, nothing from his top 3 ""best"" albums has sparked even a slight interest in me.

So there's the trouble: The ""best"" album might not be your favourite. The most popular songs might not be songs *you* like. I'll mention her another example: Prince. Did not like him in the 80's, and it wasn't until I heard some of the *very* funky stuff he did with the second version of the New Power Generation that I finally got into his music. This was some of his commercially *least* successful work, but IMO some of his best.

Music,fem9fqs,t3_epwmk6,1579244688.0,I'm trying to work out why you think anyone cares.
Music,fem99nj,t3_epwunw,1579244492.0,"Since ""tango"" is a genre, and Piazolla is *the* name in tango, it's less ""classical"" and much, much more ""tango""."
facepalm,fem7fwz,t3_epv59d,1579242472.0,It's starting to become the case where reposting this *yet again* is a facepalm.
WeAreTheMusicMakers,fem1ycf,t3_epvbd0,1579237111.0,"""Daft Punk"" should have been the clue. Daft Punk love themselves some vocoder, and if this isn't exactly that, then neither is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYIAfiVGluk).


Wait apparently Imogen Heap didn't use an actual vocoder. But that's the general area to be looking."

marvelstudios,fej6f0h,t3_epbcud,1579158794.0,"I'd bring back Serinda Swan, if she's available. Wasn't her fault. Have Medusa's hair look right, explain it as having grown back ""wilder"". And continue as normal.

The thing is, most people didn't see the Inhumans show, and many were like me and couldn't finish more than an episode or two. There's not really a bad taste, because we had the good sense to either not take a bite, or spit it out right away.

It helps that the Inhumans were never the best ""starring"" property. They were this weird element that existed outside the ""main"" marvel characters, showing up to add spice now and then. This can be the way they are used in the MCU."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,fej5eh0,t3_epcjol,1579157587.0,"If you don't really care about which drums, and play a fender strat with stock pickups in standard tuning, and the bass player uses a stock fender jazz... you'll be good. The farther you get from the ""standard"" setup, the more problems you'll have. Or the more you'll learn to work with whatever you get."
marvelstudios,fej44c3,t3_epcw3c,1579156173.0,"If I cared, I'd go by release date. 

Since I don't, I go by ""whichever I feel like watching right now"""
AdviceAnimals,feirhsi,t1_fehywj8,1579145367.0,"Ren and Stimpy was never, for even a fraction of a second intended for kids.. I personally never though Cow and Chicken was, either. HAven't seen enough of the others to comment, except for Animaniacs, but that was staying true to the original Warner cartoons, really. Those were made for an adult audience in a time when being overtly sexual was simply not a thing."

vancouver,feij141,t3_epbr6e,1579139657.0,Looks like mine does. Only I’d recommend getting a cover. Icy snow can get all sorts of places you don’t want it to.
WeAreTheMusicMakers,feiiv40,t3_epbsle,1579139548.0,"Some artists don’t want you to do covers.  You unfortunately don’t have much  unless it’s a full cover, none of the original track and have paid the mechanical license. The copyright is all in the hands of the artist and their label, and if they say no, then the answer is NO."
