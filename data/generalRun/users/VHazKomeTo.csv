socialanxiety,ffg1xwd,t1_ffg0vy8,1579896697.0,"It'feels good to know that there are people out there WHO feel the same and you can relate to them, too much pretentious success stories actually make things worst because you feel you're alone in this problem and other people don't have it that bad"

socialanxiety,ffca7pv,t1_ffc5atz,1579795051.0,I think it's better to face the reality then pretend it's not real. You need to accept that the issue exists and so something about it. No shame on admitting

MGTOW,fedrzw1,t3_eol0on,1579018635.0,"Omg Islam and Christianity is so right about Women. But only now we are realising this. You see how they attack religions saying that they oppress Women? Not at all. They are kept in place. Men are placed as protectors over women. They aren't kept in check you get movements like Feminism, totally pointless. Being a religious person is so liberating. You bow down to one true GOD AND it saves you from 1000 prostration towards other things including women."

JordanPeterson,fdmj0lz,t3_em4faj,1578551664.0,I think he was kidding since he wouldn't make such a statement on twitter fully knowing how popular Jordan Peterson is. Also he said the rumors are true so maybe some of his students made a joke so he decided to play along.
