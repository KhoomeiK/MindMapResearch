depression,ffyz31e,t1_ffywvy8,1580358902.0,"Hey! That’s great! And it’s very normal to feel depressed after getting sober. That will definitely go away. Have you thought about going to an AA or NA meeting? A lot of my sober friends started going because they were depressed, and because some of their older friends did understand their sobriety. There’s a whole lotta people out there who know what you’re going through."
AskReddit,ffyx0ux,t3_evyt4l,1580357287.0,My mom said she’d rather have a baby than a root canal.
cats,ffywkfm,t3_evyufv,1580356948.0,"My cat would rip the plastic and swallow it. You know what cats love? A sock stuffed with catnip. Get an old sock, stuff it with cotton and nip, tie the top so the nip doesn’t get out."

depression,ffyvcqg,t3_evyww8,1580356072.0,"The right drugs. My depression was chronic and longterm. I tried therapy and always gave up after a year. And  then start again with someone else. The obvious drugs didn’t help. I was doing all the other things I was supposed to do like work out and socialize. I finally found a smart psych who looked very closely at the meds I’d taken and how I felt, and he put me on 2 things and eventually added a third. I feel great now. 

All that said—work out. Socialize. Take showers and keep your place clean. Do the basic self care stuff. It’s important."
nyc,ffx0k2v,t1_ffvykbv,1580315153.0,I never said that. I was making a point about a potential ideological stand of Bloomberg publications. They are likely to side with landlords and against rent regulations because that's the standard capitalist stance.
nyc,ffvt4cr,t1_ffuclew,1580272487.0,"Bloomberg is a capitalist publication, and Bloomberg the person is a Democrat right now, but has also been a Republican, like when he was mayor of NYC."
SuicideWatch,ffvg4kw,t3_evcfgo,1580263322.0,"How old is she? If she's over 18, it doesn't matter what her mother thinks about therapy. If she's under 18, maybe she can talk to the school guidance counselor about resources for her to see a therapist. There's a lot going on here and I think professional help would be best. If you can help her find a therapist, that would be helpful. Do you get to see her much? Hang out with her, or text with her, let her talk, be supportive. Make sure she knows how much she means to you."

blackcats,ffv7kho,t3_ev7w06,1580257572.0,This happened to my cat. He’s fine. It was so weird. His back legs were mostly paralyzed and we rushed him to the emergency vet. They never quite figured out what happened but they think it was a spinal fluid clot. He got painkillers and in a week he was walking again. I hope for the same for your cat.
AskReddit,ffpihx8,t1_ffp4jl2,1580095846.0,"A lot of people don't understand depression at all. The majority of people you speak to think depression is sadness or grief. If you have the money or good insurance, seek therapy. If you live in a major city or a college town, there may be local support groups where people \_will\_ understand you."
AskReddit,ffpi67d,t3_eucq64,1580095634.0,"Do not bother with an expensive private school. You will get the same shitty job as someone from Middlebury or Brown (where my two co-workers went). College is not worth that amount of debt. Go to a state school.

If you can afford it, go away to school and live in the dorms. You'll have friends for life. 

If you can afford it, don't work all through college. Work summers if you have to work. You'll be working the rest of your life anyway.

The majority of office work sucks your soul. Train to do the highest paying thing you can stand and save your money for vacations. I'm a designer, which is what I wanted to do, and I seriously wish I'd studied corporate law instead. Office work is terrible, but I have chronic illnesses and need health insurance. If you don't live in the US you can ignore this advice.

Ask that person out. The worst that will happen is that they'll say no.

If you have no understanding of planning, or if you're so depressed you can't plan, get help. I did not, and I regret it. If you can't imagine a future, there's probably something wrong.

If you're a teen and you're depressed, that's normal. If you're a teen and you're suicidal--not normal. Get help. 

Brush your teeth twice a day. Wash your clothes. Be kind. Do things that make you happy as often as you can."
AskReddit,ffjgm1h,t1_ffjd1q0,1579997816.0,Yup. Pro tip: don’t be the kid that “forces” your parents to interact. My father treated me terribly.
AskReddit,ffjepvm,t1_ffjbdzi,1579996697.0,"Brain zaps feel like a little jolt of electricity in your head. It’s not painful, but you can tell it shouldn’t be happening. Sometimes I would physically twitch during a zap. I had them the whole time I was on cymbalta."

We were talking about it recently and she mentioned that all the letters have different colors associated with them. And my father hears this and is like “of course they do.” A long discussion ensues about different color/letter associations. I asked my father why he never mentioned this and he laughed and said “I thought it was normal!”"
SuicideWatch,ff1en8y,t3_er49km,1579478234.0,I can’t even imagine what you go through. It must be hard. I hope you get past this time and meet some people who accept and appreciate you.
SuicideWatch,ff1dy5h,t3_er49sm,1579477953.0,"I wonder why she shared this with you. Do you feel you can trust her enough with your feelings to tell her how angry it made you and why? I think it could be a good conversation with the right therapist. 

I can relate. I was very depressed as a teen and didn’t do cool kid things."
AskReddit,ff1caju,t3_er4awh,1579477438.0,"I never liked the taste of meat, so that was easy. I liked eggs but chickens are treated pretty badly. But I did dairy for a long time, buying milk and cheese from local farms at the farmers market. But then I saw an episode of the incredible dr. Pol (US show about a veterinarian) and he was called to a farm to help a cow give birth. The calf was STUCK and he pulled it out with a chain attached to a pickup truck. The same thing happened to the cow last time she gave birth, but they were going to keep inseminating her because cows don’t give milk unless they’re nursing. I noped out of dairy then."
nyc,fev1z1f,t3_eqmlxj,1579392178.0,Contact kittykind at inquiries@kittykind.org We’ve taken “aggressive” cats before. They won’t be able to take her right away. They’ll ask that she have all her shots up to date and that she’s tested for fiv and FeLV. Meanwhile you can try comfort zone or zylkene to help calm her. Sorry you’re getting so much hate here.
cats,fecfrsx,t1_feah55o,1578972857.0,"I had to bring my cat to the vet, and since it was an emergency I had to see the _other_ vet, who is more of a dog guy. He said my cat was, “kinda cute, for a cat.” We still laugh about it. He owns the practice so i can’t complain about him to anyone."

The publishers don’t make that much. The market is driven by volume. It’s possible that just the number of books and readers make the genre lucrative, but beyond that it seems a little spurious."

I didn’t think it could possibly have a negative effect. I went back to my normal after stopping. I still take a multi that has B. That’s ok for me."

It took a ridiculous amount of work to find the right psychiatrist and therapists.  I also did DBT—dialectical behavior therapy. For me, the combo of good meds, regular therapy and Dbt got me out.

All my energy went to survival and trying to get better with meds and therapy (and diet and exercise and sun and otc supplements). I never thought I’d be normal. Now that I’m not suicidal I’m angry at everything I don’t have, like a partner, kids, and a satisfying job. But still, I have a job and a place to live and some friends."

When I was a kid, there was a made for TV movie called The UFO Incident, and Barney was played by JAMES EARL MUTHAFUCKIN JONES. I thought he was kind of over the top with his screaming until I heard Barney's original hypnotism tapes. I HIGHLY recommend the book written by their hypnotist, John Fuller, The Interrupted Journey.
