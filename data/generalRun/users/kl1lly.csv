cricut,felunjs,t1_felo0lm,1579231362.0,"I learned how to do it from Pinterest! I buy my canvases from either Walmart, the dollar store, or this particular one was from Michael’s. You remove the canvas from the wood-using an xacto blade makes it really simple-and then once you’re done putting the design on your canvas put the wood frame on top of the canvas and then staple it. It’s kind of hard to explain via text but if you search on Pinterest or google you will see how easy it is"
cricut,felu6v6,t1_felhj9u,1579231032.0,Thanks so much for your response! That is really amazing the success that you have had. I have 2 young children too- I recently became a SAHM because my work schedule was 12hr shifts at a hospital and I also have bipolar disorder so I empathize with you on how difficult it is to have to leave the house for work. How do you decide price wise what you will charge? I have only done one commission project and it was 5 wine glasses that took me probably 3 hours start to finish and I only charged $25 because I didn’t really know what a fair price was
cricut,felgtht,t1_feksj5l,1579221835.0,My husband is really wanting me to sell but I am afraid to turn my hobby into “work” do you ever get stressed out about it?
cricut,felgplz,t1_fel9tvg,1579221765.0,You got it!
cricut,fekp0v7,t1_feki6c2,1579204630.0,If it makes you feel better I have a few that I have left unpainted and I still think they look pretty good!
cricut,fekc325,t1_fekc00i,1579196930.0,Literally a 50 cent acrylic paint from Walmart lol I think it was called melted chocolate
nursing,fejoykd,t3_epc47p,1579182047.0,That’s exactly how it was at the hospital I worked at too. You’d call down to housekeeping and they wouldn’t bring something up for at least an hour and by that time you had already just wiped it up with a washcloth. Ridiculous
bipolar,fei8fg3,t1_fehydv4,1579132597.0,Exactly this
bipolar2,fe4dyz3,t3_enrslz,1578858293.0,Damn that is the best way to describe how I feel
bipolar,fdl267c,t3_eluqjk,1578515771.0,Amazing work!
bipolar,fdcdzx3,t1_fdb53my,1578272582.0,Angel food cake with vanilla frosting and blueberries. It’s my husbands favorite usually I just make cupcakes but today I had this vision of frosting all of it and just doing blueberries on the side instead of on top :)
WhitePeopleTwitter,fbwmobt,t3_eeou8u,1577153950.0,I hate myself for laughing
