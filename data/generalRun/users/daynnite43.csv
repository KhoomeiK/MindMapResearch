socialanxiety,ffb5tmo,t3_esnqgc,1579752575.0,School and Work is literally the reason I have social anxiety so yeah.
socialanxiety,ffau3hm,t1_ffakj3r,1579744519.0,"Are they going to be shipping the item to you or are you picking it up? If it was me I would just say “ great, I would like to buy the item off of you can I get your PayPal info so I can send you the money?” Then send them the money and they will most likely tell you how they will get the item to you."
socialanxiety,ffai9r9,t3_esk98p,1579736373.0,What did they respond with?
HealthAnxiety,feto3qk,t3_eqiht0,1579377468.0,A CT scan is the equivalent of getting on an airplane and traveling across a large country. You’re fine
HealthAnxiety,fetnjqj,t3_eql5q8,1579377242.0,Yes I’ve had this before and know exactly what you’re talking about. Trust me it’s not MS. I’m not sure why it does this. I usually feel it when I’m more anxious or if I’ve been sitting down for a while and my muscles are tight. I also get rain drop feelings on my upper back every once in a while whenever my neck muscles are tight.
socialanxiety,feqvb7o,t3_eqctrk,1579346447.0,I’m in the exact same boat as you. You’re not alone
unpopularopinion,fepn30w,t3_eqca3u,1579324907.0,America is pretty damn patriotic. But we are living in a time where most people are afraid to show their patriotism publicly in fear of being called a racist trump supporter.
unpopularopinion,fejfu4j,t3_ephjgx,1579172193.0,"I disagree, I highly doubt that anyone would go through the trouble of trying to become the president of the United States for the sole purpose of just trying to prove a point."
unpopularopinion,feg885r,t3_eoz9wk,1579081704.0,So many chads in this comment section
exmormon,fef7g2r,t3_eolppj,1579049972.0,"The culture in Utah County is an absolute joke. It’s a shame BYU is located here and most people are Mormon because it’s one of the most beautiful places in the country. Why couldn’t they have put BYU in the Nevada desert or something lol. But if you are even slightly less active in the church you will 100 percent feel like an outcast and feel like your doing something wrong. It’s truly one of the most depressing places in America for both non mormons and honestly it’s even depressing for mormons since all they care about is the checklist, get married, go to church just so your neighbors don’t judge you, have kids immediately. It’s truly a joke of a place because of the culture. I would love to live in Salt Lake city or st George, it’s much better."
depression,fe75zrm,t3_eo1usb,1578910523.0,"People were making fun of you for having a job? That’s crazy. There is literally nothing wrong with having a part time job. I’m your same age and have a part time job, I have plenty of friends who do as well. Seriously don’t listen to anyone making fun of you, because they are wrong. There’s people out there who don’t have jobs at all and the fact that you do with anxiety and depression is incredible.Keep doing you."
unpopularopinion,fdyevyv,t3_end15e,1578778981.0,I don’t even get matches with my best picture
loseweight,fdlw0cq,t3_elx4pz,1578533844.0,I’m your exact same height and my goal is to be 150 pounds. That’s actually a healthy weight to be and is not considered overweight
UtahJazz,fdfohyw,t3_el2ekz,1578366437.0,These refs are so dog shit
