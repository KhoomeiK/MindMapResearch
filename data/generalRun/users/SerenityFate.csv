offmychest,fei1fda,t1_fehvd5c,1579128189.0,"From the sounds of it, OP seems to have been or condition herself to stand up for her wife. It maybe just a defense mechanism at this point and slightly automatic. From what I gathered from her post, she's been constantly going to bat for her wife. Not that it's an excuse to be abusive in the comments or anything. I just wanted to provide a different perspective."
offmychest,fei0ud2,t3_ep5d4a,1579127833.0,All the hugs darlin' I'm sorry that your wife has treated you this way. You deserve better.

Cooking,feelw42,t1_fedx3zj,1579036402.0,For things I use frequently for baking (flour sugar etc) I go store brand or off brand. Unless the name brand is on sale and cheaper. The store brand butter at one of my local shops is a dollar cheaper.

Another one of mom's boyfriends would punish us for talking to much by having us stand with our arms straight up for hours."

AskWomen,fdf2549,t3_ekvi2h,1578351583.0,"I have a unique first name. Personally, I love it, even though most people don't say it right. Hell, when I was little I even used to mispronounced it. I wouldn't change it. Even though I've been told to put my middle name (very common) on applications and my resume. Which I don't, because fuck that garbage."

However, there's some really good posts to help with situations and helping your wife see why this isn't a good thing. When you offer something out of your own feel will it shouldn't come with strings attached. That isn't how gift giving works."

AmItheAsshole,fbe9l42,t1_fbdycfx,1576781276.0,Then you should have pulled her aside and talked about the boundary stomping she did.... That would have been the adult thing to do.
AmItheAsshole,fbe9ddq,t3_ecu3p4,1576781140.0,"ESH 

Your friend shouldn't have been teasing you and it sounds like she overstepped a boundary. You should have pulled her aside and talked to her about it. Instead you fucking tell her medical history to the whole table while also slut shamming her..."
DDLGconfess,fbcn7z4,t1_fbcjsqh,1576728068.0,Silly Kitty is another one he calls me. Though I understand the not overlapping bit. Honey Bear is another cute one.
Cooking,fbcgmc0,t3_ecl0w7,1576723422.0,"Aww this warmed my heart. My ex went to school for cooking and he wouldn't help me make the food better. Instead he'd make me feel bad about it.
