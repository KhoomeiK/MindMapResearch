summonerschool,ffvk0rg,t1_ffvhttk,1580265933.0,But also could put you in a position to get ganked if it’s later than early game. You’re right though.
summonerschool,ffvgyqb,t1_ffv83ni,1580263878.0,Yo HMU with that disc link please :) in my DM
summonerschool,ffvgnt0,t1_ffvfs57,1580263676.0,"Don’t think til after the cannon dies. Or if it can’t be salvaged, notice this early and hard shove so it will bounce, then Aggro their minions on their side so that the next wave will push to you and you can refreeze. This is 2-3 waves in advance planning. And takes about 1:15 to happen."
summonerschool,ffrdjzj,t1_ffql56u,1580155875.0,"But if you play in low elo like you’re in high elo you’ll just die. For instance in your scenario you gank bot, waste time get nothing out of it. You assume enemy jungle has taken your top side. So you invade their bot side because yours is cleared and your top is assumed gone. You die to the silver jungle farming raptors because he didn’t go top."
Draven,ff7ci9e,t3_es08ep,1579646359.0,"Only reason he is weak is because his q mechanic takes twice as long as a regular auto attack. You hit someone with 1 spinning ace and they can auto you twice while you’re running to the drop zone and it’s a huge dps loss compared to every single other ad until you have enough attack speed to weave 1 other auto while that one is airborne. 

Draven feels best after zerker greaves but by then the lane is decided."
summonerschool,ff3rr6w,t1_ff2pp2p,1579547436.0,"This is exactly what I’m trying to practice as I play teamfight heavy tops that shine in mid game skirmishes and make game changing late game plays. (Gnar, Kennen). I need to keep these things in mind especially setting my wave up with the knowledge I have and with some plan in mind."
summonerschool,fevnewh,t1_fevncjo,1579399323.0,"If your bot lane plays their champ like a melee champ, then they are not the win condition."
summonerschool,fevg3vt,t1_fev19sd,1579396951.0,This season especially solo exp is worth so much and any tp play probably gives up at least 2.5 waves of xp.
summonerschool,fetpb5b,t1_feto3m2,1579377945.0,Haha that’s awesome. I definitely do stuff that one minute I’m like hey this is bad and the next I’m like what could go wrong?
summonerschool,fetp0d3,t3_eqc3hs,1579377831.0,"I think you have the tools and are just thinking about it too hard. You have scenarios and you have plans for all of them. You need to just do the same thing every game. Nobody can hold your hand and do it unless you’re live with a coach during the game. 

When you go in game, identify your champs team and see what they each want to do (like you’ve already done) then act on it in a way that will strengthen those strengths as a jungler. Enable your teams goals in every way. That’s the easy answer. How you do it specifically changes lane to lane and game to game. Also your execution changes and may be wrong initially but you had the right idea. That just takes volume and data over time. For instance,  most lanes want to either scale to 1v1, scale to 5v5, fight early and often, or take out numbered fights (pick). Figure out which your team champs want to do first. Then what the enemies want. How are they matched up? How do you enable one while disabling another? You either gank for them, ward for them, or pressure the opposite side so the other jungle will play according to that. 

These are generic but this is what must be done. Late reply but hopefully helps."
summonerschool,fetmbjt,t1_fes5r6k,1579376829.0,Only if bot is your win condition. You can tp bot and get a double kill and your lane opponent gets plates and can now 1v1 you when you get back and you lost your lead and your monkey bot lane won’t carry late. Just know why you’re tping is my point.
summonerschool,fetk0i9,t1_ferl5pg,1579376191.0,How long would you think it’d take to instill those commands into said plat player so that they become diamond auto pilot?
summonerschool,fetjai7,t1_fesqz1c,1579376034.0,I know that exact feeling and sometimes I wonder if I give it off to 1 tier under me. I doubt it. Definitely silvers but I don’t produce that to golds. It’s unfortunate. I want the power Hahahaha. It’s like witchcraft when even if they’re 2 kills down they still have so much pressure and you’re still scared to trade into them lol.
summonerschool,fet8kt0,t1_fesa546,1579372777.0,"I run into it a lot in gold and last season went on a 20 game win streak where I SPECIFICALLY focused on wave management and it was crazy easy. I think gold players know wave management and can easily catch a freeze or so fast pushes but to choose in their mind “alright this next wave is slow pushing to me, I’m going to freeze while my jungler is on the opposite side of the map then when he paths down he can gank and I’m also safe from his jungler” “ okay now their jungler is top side I can hard shove and apply pressure under their tower”. Those types of active wave management decisions are absent in gold/plat. Because once you start doing that you won’t stay in gold/plat long."
summonerschool,fet6drj,t1_fesmq9d,1579372189.0,Wait you don’t decay in plat anymore??
summonerschool,fesexyv,t1_feqxfi1,1579364493.0,I mean blind like first pick before they pick their top lane champ.
facepalm,fep6ygv,t1_feozyf6,1579313522.0,They’d shut a worker’s compensation claim down so fast if she left the premises and got injured doing things unrelated to her job duties.
summonerschool,feop52g,t1_fehs5hn,1579303402.0,"I think over time your pool is really good and covers a lot of bases for situational picks based on teamcomp. Noct worth keeping because he’s not extremely difficult to grasp once you do get his kit down. I’d blind/first pick Olaf, Zac if tank needed, Elise for ap if enemy has weak laners, noct for split push/dive the ad threat."
summonerschool,feook3l,t3_ek2v5f,1579303107.0,"Switched from bot to top this preseason and really trying to settle on a solid champ pool of blind pickable top champs. I have picked these mostly from my adc background so any suggestions or swaps will be taken into account. 

Gnar: big aoe teamfight and fair split push when ahead also ranges comfort

Kennen: much the same as Gnar but group way more than split. Kinda the ap version of that for those ad heavy comps

Camille: I’ve been practicing Camille exclusively all preseason with around 30 games played and am still learning but she’s super enjoyable. She fills the late game duelist/diver and forget the team split push role 

Thoughts are appreciated!"
summonerschool,feo8izq,t1_feo8ch7,1579296579.0,Nah I was exaggerating. But there are definitely champs I could play and easily get higher than my peak mmr. I just abhor those champions and don’t value winning over fun in that respect.
