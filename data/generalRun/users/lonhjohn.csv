But yeah, a lot of people get no hand outs, regardless of their childhood, and have to make it work so I’m not with putting yourself on a pedestal."

Just like some with a way worse childhood than myself can be on top of the world, some people with a perfect childhood could have absolutely nothing to show for it. Maybe they just suck as people."
