relationship_advice,ff88f5y,t1_ff882px,1579669006.0,"Sometimes victim blaming is valid. If a person antagonizes someone with a gun and says “what’re you gonna do, shoot me?” Then start fighting with the person with a gun, and that person gets shot, I’m going to tell the gun shot victim that they’re a fucking idiot. That’s victim blaming, but it’s not wrong to say the victim is an idiot. 

The BF said that he is done with it happening, meaning it’s happened more than once. If your actions constantly lead to you being a victim, a normal person would stop doing the things that make them a victim. But instead all she says “he doesn’t understand why I dress provocatively” while saying nothing to explain *why* she dresses provocatively. Her dressing provocatively is obviously making her a victim, and a normal person would take actions to not become a victim.
