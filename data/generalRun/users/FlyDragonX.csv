walkaway,ffa4v7t,t3_esbwzk,1579727923.0,"Good, it's idiotic to think a guy who identifies as a female is actually a female, he may identify as such but is in-fact, not, never was, and as much as they might think they are or want to be, will never be. The fact this is a thing we need to explain says a lot about the world we live in and how disillusioned people are about our reality.

Unexpected,feosb0c,t1_feoihr8,1579304743.0,"I'm happy you feel like this, shows how cool Irish folk are. 

The truth of the matter is: 

If *a white person* did this in a reversed role, say like an Indian person, parading around, speaking in the accent. They would a)lose their job-- b)be labelled a racist-- c) probably make it in the news! 

My blurb, *no need to read any further*: I do get it though it's meant to be fun and funny, and I thought it was actually cute. It's just a harsh reverse racist world we live in now (I know, very first world problem). You can't have an opinion on racism if you're a white person, if you do... You're racist. I don't mean to sound cynical either, it's just the way things are. You argue any point and you are shut up with a ""you don't understand cause you're white / white privilege"" stamp and now your words are worth spit and everyone is so goddamn happy about it, fyi when this happens... It's reverse racism. Is it as bad as actual racism? Of course not, but it should be noted, just because someone is white DOESN'T MAKE THEM RACIST! Thank you and have a nice day."
