hiphopheads,ffb8l1i,t1_ffaew0x,1579755103.0,Met riff about 5-6 years ago at a random house in a Midwestern college town. It was very strange. I was hammered so I don't remember what we talked about.
thesopranos,ff8b38f,t1_ff7qzj2,1579671483.0,That scene is so funny to me for some reason.
Bass,ff8960n,t1_ff6zuz5,1579669674.0,Yee haw
LetsTalkMusic,ff58mt0,t1_ff4b4q3,1579583497.0,"Agree completely. I liked the King of Limbs when it came out and it's only grown on me since then. It's a top four Radiohead album for me. Codex and Separator are about as good as any songs they've put out.

The B side from that era *Supercollider* is also really good."
nba,ff54pf2,t1_ff5094t,1579580164.0,I've seen people get dunked on worse in pick up games.
TheWayWeWere,ff4j2zo,t1_ff4fk2p,1579564820.0,"Yup, relative to a McDonald's in the lower 48 at the same time these prices are probably all very high."
clevelandcavs,ff47ebu,t3_ergw72,1579557165.0,"Surprisingly little tbh. Looking at his stats he had stretches where he was effective for us, but at the time it rarely felt like he was making a major impact"
AskReddit,fewm1n5,t1_fewlaxl,1579414198.0,"Fuck me. Five years ago, I was doing 2-4 page assignments for like $15-$20 an assignment. Closest to a bonus I ever got was when my buddy's professor pulled him aside and told him he was one of the best writers in the class, which meant I was one of the best writers in the class because I had down pretty much all his homework."
OSUOnlineCS,fevwyhs,t3_eqq3fd,1579402512.0,"Well, the week 2 assignment didn't have anything that was particularly tricky to implement, but it was more time consuming than about the first five  or six weeks of 161 combined. This week's assignment looks to be about the same.

That said, if someone's previous programming experience was more or less limited to 161, I could see these assignments posing a real challenge."
indieheads,fev29ky,t1_fere1g8,1579392267.0,Yes. Underrated classic in my opinion.
nbadiscussion,fenxej3,t3_eq38h1,1579292204.0,"Ignoring the actual question, there are some really interesting takeaways from that chart, OP

Kevin Garnett was an absurdly impactful player. In his prime he excelled at almost every facet of the game.

AI's supporting cast in 2001 was not as terrible as people like to say.  It was lacking in scorers, but very strong defensively and on the boards.

The Warriors 2016 net rating with Curry off the court is surprisingly low."
madmen,fej58ep,t1_feczs14,1579157398.0,Lol I just watched that scene. I had totally forgotten about it. So good.
ModestMouse,feiircq,t3_ep9pwz,1579139479.0,"I don't know.

 But I've been told, you'll never die and you'll never grow old."
todayilearned,fehqb6f,t1_fehhqoq,1579121747.0,Takes 4 to 6 weeks for complete red blood cell replacement after a donation. For me the effects are acutely noticeable for the week and less noticeable for a week or two after that.
todayilearned,fehgpr9,t1_fegt7ei,1579116181.0,"Same. It's kind of a moral conundrum for me actually. I've donated about 16 times so far and I like being able to help people in need, but I'm also a very active person and everytime I donate my strength and endurance take a hit for a couple weeks as my red blood cell count recovers, which makes me want to donate more infrequently, but then I feel a little guilty about holding out."
todayilearned,fehfaq9,t1_fegu1yc,1579115352.0,"Same. It's kind of a moral conundrum for me actually.

nbadiscussion,fefh8sl,t3_eoqhuu,1579056275.0,Awesome. Thank you.
linguistics,fedxglr,t1_fedljfr,1579021949.0,"Actually the article states that Italian pronunciation is simpler than English, but its grammar is more complex, leading to the simplified speaking."
nbadiscussion,fecv6th,t1_feccutj,1578985906.0,"To be fair, Landry Fields probably would've had a real nice career if it hadn't been for injuries."
hiphopheads,febrfzn,t1_feahaho,1578961875.0,"I think Pinata definitely had higher highs (Thuggin, Deeper, Knicks and Shame are so so good), but Bandana is a little more consistent from start to finish. I'd still rank Pinata higher though."
cscareerquestions,fe0gi6w,t1_fe0bo2y,1578813069.0,"This is a little harsh, but I gotta echo this sentiment. Why would you ask for your boss's permission? That seems bizarrely servile to me. What you do in your own time is none of your manager's business."
clevelandcavs,fdzwlcs,t3_engnn1,1578797550.0,I do not like watching Sexton play.
nba,fdyceio,t1_fdwvhfo,1578778287.0,Having your feet aligned isn't necessarily a good thing; in fact it's often a bad thing. Many great shooters shoot with their shooting hand side rotated slightly forward and that foot ahead of the other.
cycling,fdwl6l4,t1_fduq23l,1578759843.0,"Can I ask about the plate removal? I got a plate and five screws put in for a broken collarbone about two years ago. My surgeon said I likely wouldn't need the plate removed, but it's been giving me some pain lately. What was recovery time like?"
cscareerquestions,fdtc3kd,t1_fdt5713,1578714648.0,That's his point. Someone with a math degree is going to have a much easier time landing a software job than someone with an unrelated degree.
indieheads,fdriagn,t1_fdremgw,1578684925.0,"Starlings of the Slipstream is one of my favorite Pavement songs, and Twin Falls is one of my favorite built to spill songs also. You have cool taste."
indieheads,fdri2bb,t1_fdqudlg,1578684792.0,This but unironically. Also listening to the albums So by Peter Gabriel and  Graceland by Paul Simon make me wish I could've been a yuppie living in NYC in the mid- late 80s
OSUOnlineCS,fdqoay4,t3_emqcny,1578671329.0,I went over. I got in
AskHistorians,fdqncsz,t1_fdqky5j,1578670734.0,Did the Chaski have any kind of system for codifying or remembering their messages? It seems unlikely that anything other than the simplest message could pass through the dozens of runners required to cover 1100 miles in 5 days without becoming completely garbled.
cscareerquestions,fdodat2,t1_fdnokkn,1578603049.0,">Depends on what type of caviar you inject into your veins on a daily basis.

Lol thank you. This sub is absurd when it comes to financial advice. There are people in every city in America who are living on incomes well under six figures. Someone else asked in this thread how is he living comfortably now on a 80k salary with $1700 month in rent. Easily is the correct answer to that one."
Sneakers,fdnfzht,t1_fdmzu3p,1578584996.0,"Yeah I love my blazers and they are comfortable once on, but they are an absolute pain in the ass to put on."

madmen,fdkfars,t1_fdkdmqu,1578502648.0,"Can you name one specific policy or action that has been ""brilliant for the economy?""

His economic policies have been ineffectual, but not overtly harmful.

His foreign policy has been pretty good by the standard of post WWII presidents (which is not saying much).

His stance on climate change and general public deportment have been disgusting."
ModestMouse,fdjapq5,t1_fdj3087,1578463485.0,"For the longest time I thought it was about buying meth, but I think it's actually just about Urban sprawl."
Bass,fdj8d7g,t1_fdj6wk8,1578461368.0,You can also play the first guitar part on a bass. There's actually a lot of modest mouse guitar parts that can be played on a bass.
clevelandcavs,fdit5dj,t3_eljn2i,1578450464.0,I hope what we just saw was Sexton totally disregarding Beilein's play.
90sHipHop,fdfvu4n,t1_fdemaae,1578371577.0,It really might be. I can't think of a single beat that gets me more hype. Shout out to Ski Beatz.
ModestMouse,fdccktz,t3_ekhjro,1578271637.0,"The Moon & Antarctica gets me emotional too. It's Isaac's best album from a lyrical standpoint, in my opinion."
cscareerquestions,fdamk7j,t1_fdabkjp,1578247755.0,"Yes, exercise! Exercise can do wonders for mental health in addition to making you feel better physically. OP, you phrase it like you don't have time for exercise, but I can guarantee that's BS. Just 45 minutes a day can make a huge difference. Even if you just start with something simple like walking around the neighborhood at a brisk pace."
starbucks,fd7y8z3,t1_fcjzo3s,1578211800.0,What's the cost of living in Brunei like? How much do you typically spend a month on housing and food?
Stims,fcwjk63,t1_fcwg612,1578027359.0,"What you're trying to say here is that you love the song Strofoam Boots/ It's All Nice on Ice, Alright by Modest Mouse. I do too"
90sHipHop,fcw0hq1,t1_fcvvisx,1578014313.0,Haven't listened enough to rank.
90sHipHop,fcvv1m0,t1_fcu8qhi,1578010742.0,Yeah a lot of disrespect for MM here.
90sHipHop,fcvuqh8,t3_eiw7q7,1578010542.0,"Fuck this is hard. Okay.

1. Midnight Marauders
2. Ready to Die
3. Illmatic
4. Enter the Wu Tang
5. The Infamous
6. Reasonable Doubt
7. Liquid Swords
8. Cuban Linx

Having The Infamous at 5 feels like it's way too low, but the first 4 are basically untouchable."
hiphopheads,fcpubba,t3_eidad2,1577872289.0,This actually goes real hard
hiphopheads,fcptuy6,t3_ei6jr7,1577872009.0,Wow never knew about this when it first got released..I would've been very into it back then.
nba,fcp5uk5,t1_fcp16o5,1577851448.0,"I don't like shitting on other people's homes, and I can't comment on what living there is like, but after multiple cross country road trips, Indiana is easily my second least favorite state to drive through behind Nebraska. Nothing pleasant to me about driving across that state."
indieheads,fcnrwu7,t1_fcnqd71,1577817267.0,Second half is definitely stronger
indieheads,fcnojf2,t1_fcnfxsa,1577815425.0,"I feel like people underrate King of Limbs because they have such a high expectation of Radiohead albums. When you discography is filled with multiple 9/10 (or better albums) people expect borderline perfection. TKOL rules. At least 4 very high quality songs, and no songs that'd I'd consider outright bad."
indieheads,fcnoasz,t1_fcn6963,1577815288.0,"Glad to see King Krule on the list but how are they gonna leave the Ooz off? Top five album of the decade for me.

Very good list otherwise."
madmen,fcmdwdp,t1_fcm1v1j,1577771760.0,"He was an unstable stalker and an antisocial weirdo. He wasn't all bad, because I think he did have a genuine desire to help the girl and he was disgusted by the pimp and the Johns, but he is not someone to admire or emulate."
LetsTalkMusic,fclxpxz,t1_fclwsnu,1577759034.0,"Yeah it's brilliant, catchy pop music. To pretend it's objectively mediocre is just obnoxious."
Browns,fchnrbm,t1_fchnked,1577652158.0,Just when I thought I was out!
nba,fcc9kp3,t1_fcc4upz,1577595901.0,"No, I am fortunate to still have my father around. That must have been very painful and upsetting for Kerr."
nba,fcbtzpr,t1_fcbt593,1577590958.0,Certainly. Everyone deals with tragedies differently and we can rarely go wrong by being empathetic.
nba,fcbk0oa,t1_fcbjczj,1577587766.0,"I mean that may seems a little brusque, but essentially that's the truth. I'm not dismissing the pain of it, but what am I going to do? Spend the rest of my days bemoaning my misfortunes? Of course not, and I doubt Kerr does either. Sorry for your loss. Hopefully things get easier with time."
nba,fcbicrm,t1_fcbdpoh,1577587225.0,"I mean there are millions of people of people who have lost a parent to an untimely death. Life goes on. I lost my mom when I was in highschool, and despite not making millions of dollars doing something I love for a living, I consider myself very blessed in the grand scheme of things.

Edit: you go about in pity for yourself while all the while a great wind carries you across the sky."

hiphopheads,fc3tfv4,t1_fc369a9,1577398184.0,Dude I loved that song when it dropped. We used to play it all the time in the kitchen I worked in senior year of college. Great memories.
fantasyfootball,fc3czfi,t1_fc2x390,1577387059.0,"Dude I really wanted OJ in the draft. I was so pissed when he got taken the pick before my pick came up in one of the middle rounds and  I had to settle for grabbing Andrews. Looking back, I almost definitely don't end up winning my league if I don't get Andrews."

IAmA,fbzir59,t1_fbz20ke,1577248068.0,"Awesome. I was going to ask if you're a fan of Pharaoh Sanders. His music is some of the most spiritual jazz in my opinion.

Have you heard the album power of Soul by Idris Muhammad? I've been digging that one a lot lately.

Merry Christmas."
cscareerquestions,fbx4po0,t1_fbwftp4,1577169261.0,"Your uncle isn't really that special lol. That's probably how the majority of cocaine users are. You'd be surprised by how many respectable, successful people you've met over the course of your life have done cocaine a few times."
