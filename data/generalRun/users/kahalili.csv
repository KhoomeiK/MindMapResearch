feemagers,feytwy1,t1_fex7ooj,1579450461.0,"Lmfao nope. I wouldn’t have minded conservative, I understand that people have different beliefs. But trump? No. Idc your reasoning, if you support him then you’re enabling his bullshit. You may have had a reason but it resulted in a nutty president who may be a traitor, who wouldn’t denounce the support of the kkk, who allowed a man who may or may not have been a sexual predator but still was unable to keep his cool on the Supreme Court court (and now has a bias in these situations), who looks like a joke to other world leaders, who tried to cyberbully a 16 year old girl bc he doesn’t want to fix climate change despite the first lady’s platform being anti bullying. It resulted in a president who may have just started a war, who ushered in an era of racism, who sees no problem with all of the gun violence we’re suffering from, who calls Mexicans gangsters and rapists and tries to waste money on a wall, who enforced policies that result in kids being in cages, who cut taxes for the rich and left the rest of us to keep struggling, who left the Paris agreement bc hed rather make money then try to save the planet, and bans people from certain countries from entering our country *when we’re not even at war yet*, and who flat out *abandoned our allies*.

If you said MAGA in 2016 and then in 2019 I see you again and you’re still on team trump then I want nothing to do with you. It’s beyond a difference in political beliefs at this point. It’s not like supporting McCain vs Obama or Romney Vs Obama. This isn’t republican vs Democrat or conservative vs liberal. Donald Trump is a completely different level here and supporting him says a lot about your moral values, and I don’t want anything to do with anyone who values or even accepts Trumps choices.

tumblr,fee9v4e,t1_fedtzps,1579029385.0,"I wonder this.

I think we will be around, I think natural disasters and shit will increase in frequency but the majority of us will adjust to slightly different weather patterns and move on with our lives. Some places on the coast will probably be gone, and there will likely be health problems due to heavy air pollution (some friends from Singapore said they get ~~Smaug~~ smog there, like he said it the way someone would talk about seeing fog. Wild.). So yeah, life may be a bit more dangerous but I don’t think it’ll be apocalyptic, we’ll just keep on keeping on. But I know nothing about environmental science (disclaimer lol).

tumblr,fee956q,t3_eomozy,1579028962.0,"Big mood honestly 

My dream is to get a good paying job ASAP and get married and live in a nice 2 bedroom house with my husband. Double income no kids. We travel while we can. We own 3 cats. I can afford to not get the cheapest food I can find from Publix. In this dream i get rich and retire before I’m 40 so I can actually have time to see the world before it all goes to shit and don’t spend a majority of my life working a spilled 9-5 job 5 days a week. 

50 years from now I imagine everything mostly looks the same. Our TVs are gonna have the same type of improvement that like regular to Blu-ray had. We’ll have (sort of) self driving cars that can also be regularly driven but like they’ll work as well as Siri does (Eg saying “Siri how do you spell Girardelli” and Siri responding “got it, plotting the quickest route to the deli”). Fires like the stuff in the amazon and Australia will keep happening. Hurricanes keep wildin’. water levels are up. I think we’ll have gotten to mars but idk if we’ll have colonized it (probably not). I don’t think we’ll have found other life outside our planet yet. Our tech won’t be that different, we’ll probably have the iPhone 60 or some shit, it’s the size of a Mac but folds down to the size of an iPod shuffle and you can click it into your Apple Watch, idk. Basically nothing new, just tiny little additions. From my doesnt-know-shit-about-econ, born-in-2000 perspective the thing that happened to the housing market in like ‘07 will happen to college. There will be a social media related degree for bloggers/influencers. Facebook will sell my information to the octopuses that took over the government back in ‘21. They’ll be able to watch us through our phones/laptops/etc 1984 style.

Last sem they wanted me to sign up for not only an intro to my major class but also an intro to the school class. They taught the same things?? They’re one credit classes? One was even pass fail so it barely affected my GPA (honestly the both barely affected it. Neither are required courses or even fulfill any required credits for me). I tried to drop one and told them about it first and both of them tried to FaceTime me at the same time to tell me about how it I drop one I’d be taking 13h instead of 14h (12 is a full time student). They were lecturing me about how I was becoming lazy, that I’m not at college just to slack off and party, if I wanna be lazy with my classses then I should come home and go to the community college 5 minutes from my house, etc. I just kept the class and wasted an hour a week + time for the stupid group projects (make a map of campus that a first year would like! Discuss problems first years face!! Listen to this lady lecture you about meditation at 9 in the morning!!!!) and later learned about saying “ok” and then just not doing it.

I signed up for the 5.99/month Spotify student deal before I left home because I *love* music and my pirating app wasn’t working anymore and had to deal with them using that all summer as evidence about how i dont know how to handle my own money, why I should give my mom the $600 in cash I’d been saving from bdays, xmas, tutoring etc so she could put it in a savings account for me, why I can’t go to six flags fright fest with my friends once over the summer, etc.

They used to be able to see my assignments in HS and would discuss my “plans for finishing this weeks homework” over dinner with me. They’d text me that I hadn’t submitted the math worksheet due in 2 days yet. They’d ask my why I hadn’t already submitted the project due the next week. They’d read the teachers notes on my essays and then talk ab those over dinner (they were really anal about *always* having dinner together and would lecture me when I got dinner shifts at the restaurant. Jokes on you mom and dad I told my boss I prefer closing shifts). They’d *email my teachers about my grades without telling me*

AskReddit,fdkyudz,t1_fdjx5f3,1578513980.0,"Bro money is the *key*.

Start working when you can, I worked as a waitress. Tell your parents you want a joint checking account so you can practice financial independence. Save up *every fuckin cent* you make. I don’t know how but my friends have worked (tutoring and babysitting, one even at a movie theater) since like the summer before junior year but they spend so hard that their account is always at 0. Don’t do that. Save it. When you go home for breaks, work. I worked 5 days a week over my winter break and squirreled that all away.

Take notes in your consumer management class btw because I didn’t at the time bc it wasn’t honors and my arrogant ass thought it was below me and was only taking it bc it was required. Now I’m out here googling what the fuck an APR is and why it matters.

Once you enroll in college you can see student deals ig? Idk how many cards do that but Discover has a student card which is what I used. Signed up for that, went paperless so it doesn’t send much mail home. Made a discover savings account too, they have pretty solid customer service so I kinda threw a ton of questions at the poor lady. (Citi’s customer service sucks ASS btw. I got transferred like 4 times and still dealt with bots. Even tried using the gold members line bc my parents are gold members ). 

Told my mom I have a savings account and I’m transferring my money there so it can gain interest (so she doesn’t call the cops or something when she notices the money no longer in the checking account) and then did that (but I left a few hundred bucks in the checking account because I thought you can have fees for having to little in your accounts? Again, something I need to google and should’ve just learned in consumer ec). I think I got a little lucky here that she let this happen, I really expected her to try and tell me to put it back or tried to contact Citibank about putting it back or something but afaik she hasnt

And then I studied my ass off all the time so I could go somewhere really good bc that’s how I’d get out of the state. Like don’t get me wrong I have an eighth of an idea what I’m doing so I’m not expert here. But that’s what I did.

I’m still depending on them for half of college :/ so I’m saving as much money as possible. Go for those pirated textbooks and 99¢ folders and shit lol.

Got a C on an in class essay once my junior year (for context I’m a *straight a studwnt* like my academic history is proof that I don’t just fuck around in my English class) and got grounded. 

I struggled in APUSH a bit bc I’m more math oriented than history oriented and the class had a first semester curve bc qpparently a lot of people struggle but my mom went like 5 emails to my teacher without even asking.

Otherwise to give them access to my grades I have to give em full access to my student account (bc afaik the only way I can check my grades is thru our student portal, canvas just doesn’t calculate half of them and I’d *love* to see their reaction to the “0%” canvas said I had in chem lab last semester despite my portal having me at a 92.)

AskReddit,fdjru9y,t1_fdjdcik,1578485162.0,It’s the same here but theyll still get angry and accuse me of hiding shit
AskReddit,fdj88hl,t1_fdj7zt0,1578461255.0,"They say they’ll pay as much as they have college savings for (~2 years) and I’ll pay the rest (tho my mom threatened to stop paying for it a lot when I was back home. Like once she held it over my head bc I didn’t wanna enter another piano competition. But I legit do not know if that’s empty or not, sometimes I can’t tell with her and Im too scared to call her bluff on this)

They really like my school though because it’s supposed to be the 3rd in the country for my major so they we definitely down to let me go. Probably would’ve been instate if not for this one. I got into a *lot* out of state but they weren’t as well known for my major so unless one gave me a ton of money (they didn’t) I would’ve gone to my states flagship"
AskReddit,fdj6l78,t1_fdj5abw,1578459886.0,Thanks for the advice dude! Tryina be careful with money now bc I’m trying to save up everything I’ve been making when I’m at home for when I inevitably have to start paying for myself (which is either when the college savings from my parents runs out or if they take it away if they catch me acting out [tHey threaten that a lot but I legit cannot tell if they’re legit]). For now it’s mostly groceries and the occasional activity with friends
AskReddit,fdj6e5e,t1_fdj6blx,1578459725.0,Only works if they can’t lecture your ear off and/or take away your car privileges so you can’t escape their lectures tho
AskReddit,fdj2j3y,t1_fdio3ws,1578456763.0,"Idk if I’m quite an adult bc I’m 19 and still in college ^(and does that reeeally count?) but yeah, I just ignore them. They say “do this”, I say “ok” and then do whatever the fuck I want.

They gotta drive 13 hours to get to me. They ain’t paying for a plane flight. What are they gonna do, call me? I can just not answer it. 

They said “share your location with us” and I said “no” and it was *amazing*. They said “give me your password so we can check your grades” and I was like “ahaha nope can’t it’s location based whoops sorry” (it’s not).

They say don’t go out and I just tell them I’m not going to frat parties, meanwhile I’m going like 3 hours away for two nights for a weekend trip with a whole ass frat. I tell them I wake up and 9 everyday and go to sleep at 11:30, that I eat 3x a day, I have 4 friends that they trust that I always say I’m hanging out with, I have a separate insta account that they can follow so they don’t see what I’m doing, I pay for my own subscriptions so they can’t see what I have, I have my own credit card so they can’t police what I buy. I don’t tell them when it’s time to register for classes so they can’t tell me what to sign up for (made that mistake last semester). I don’t tell them what finals I have when so they can’t police my studying every hour. I’ve got 4 cream sodas in my fridge right now- my mom would flip if she found out I drink soda lmao

So basically ignore them and hide things I guess. Probably not the best habits but you know what I’m enjoying being able to step outside for a moment without being asked “where are you going” or being able to talk ab someone i ait next to without being asked about their family and their grades. Went for a walk on campus at 6 yesterday. On my own. No one yelled at me for it

[edit] they’re not cut off y’all, I still communicate with them but I just hide a lot so they think my college existence is the exact same as my high school existence. And I also don’t answer every single call/text from them immediately lol. But I call home and say hi on weekends and keep them somewhat updated on what I’m doing

[edit 2.0] and no I’m not fully financially independent yet. Working on it. I’m paying for half of college. I’m high key too scared to try and discuss boundaries while they can still hold half of my tuition over my head"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdfubb7,t1_fdf7f7b,1578370412.0,"wow ok maybe I shouldn’t get BC then...

I don’t really know if I’ve had depression bc i never got it checked out but I am definitely prone to going through rough patches here and there and for the past couple of years I’ve mostly been fine. But like I don’t watch shows like 13 reasons why anymore bc it kinda spirals me and I steered clear of schools with high suicide rates/where people were generally depressed (eg uchicago) bc i *know* getting involved there will just fuck me up.

First year of college, I mean it’s not like I was getting some but I was considering just getting on it now so I wouldn’t have to mention it to my fam right before I was getting it on. Buuut I’d rather just deal with periods and use condoms I guess bc those rough periods leave me with negative productivity and my GPA *canNOT* handle that rn"

Like, maybe he just wanted to impress you or make you feel special? (That does not excuse it but dude teenagers be immature, it’s how it goes. If that’s what it is it’s up to you whether you’re willing to forgive that or not [youre under no obligation to tho])"

But in her case like, it actually is within her limitations? Wdy want from me man

Shoutout to the people who are like “substitute tomatoes with lettuce, chicken with pork, I want veggies but no broccoli and extra bean sprouts, extra lime, no fish sauce, extra sweet chili and can they put the teriyaki sauce on the side? ^(like ill do that for them but still, guys c’mon)"

We get a tofu ham, it’s tofu but it’s made to be a ham subsitute” and she was still pissed).

Like it actually was tofu tho. We get tofu ham, like fake ham made outta tofu. I told her that. My manager told her that. She gave us 1 Star like ok lady I’ve been here for a month idk what to tell you"

Also I hate how hard it is to listen to music when u run. I don’t like the thudding I hear when I run with headphones :/"
