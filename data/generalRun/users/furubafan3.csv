witchcraft,ffb73iv,t3_erpwlk,1579753568.0,"Sounds like you do chaos witchcraft! That sort of thing takes a more logical approach and sources from scientific research! As a kid, I was taught under my wiccan aunt, and grew up to mix it with Buddhist philosophy. (Becaise my parents are buddhist) Now I study independently and take a more scientific/psychological approach. In my personal opinion, ""spells"" are another term for prayer. Both involve setting your intentions out into the world, and willing it into existence."

Grounding grounding grounding! Mediation, mindfulness and deep cleansing work is the way to go. Start researching shadow work. Trauma suppresses your inner child, and can cause maladaptive behaviors. These habits aren't bad, but necessary given the environment you grew up. However, they don't work in the ""real world""

I journal regularly as a form of working meditation, and try to move my body at least once a day. To really tune in spiritually, knowing your physical body, via keeping good hygiene, eating healthy, and drinking enough water helps. Your most important tool is your physical vessel. Check out Taoist and Zen philosophy.

For ADHD, you just need to move to get your wiggles out! I focus best when I'm moving, so I fidget, I pace, I wear my body out, so my brain can focus!

As far as crystals are concerned, I'm fond of hematite for cleansing/grounding."

hoarding,ff94e2h,t3_erz15r,1579704567.0,"Most definitely. My father is a hoarder. I stayed with him for winter break and turned into an insomniac. Being in such cramped quarters with my very hyper little brother, and emotionally repressed sibster made me feel like a mentos in cola. Usually when I settle in, I carve out a small sanctuary for myself, but it's a magnet for the rest of my family to live in. As an introvert is wore me down significantly. It took me a week back at my own apartment to reset my sleep schedule."

I've settled on the title of witch, and still follow basic Buddhist principles I grew up with. (I'm asian) I was also a tween during the 90's in Massachusetts, where everyone and their mother was wiccan. I dont identify a wiccan anymore, but I'm still into spiritual shit.

I totally still read tarot cards, read up on astrology, and meditate. Also have a lot of ancestral dreams and use them to help me better connect with my loving family members."
