facepalm,fghcs8z,t1_fgh9p3u,1580781953.0,">I'm not talking about how it was made. No one refers to 0F in the context of that brine solution anymore. That's how it was created, not how it's used now.

Fair enough.

>Also, 50 is in no way ""ideal."" It's just a percentage of a range. Humidity isn't most comfortable at 50% either, especially depending on the accompanying temperature.

My entire point is that describing Fahrenheit scale between 0 and 100 as human habitable or whatever is misleading. With humidity we're talking about an actual percentage of a well defined parameter, without making a direct implication to human habitability.

>As for precision, it's not about estimating how you feel in that moment. A lot of weather channels use 2 significant figures (even when temperatures get to triple digits), as one (but not the only) example.

This is fine, but I don't see how this makes it any better than Celsius?"
facepalm,fgh5s41,t1_fgfzkjo,1580777358.0,"I never understood this argument. First of all, the Fahrenheit scale wasn't made up this way, 0 was created as the freezing point of a specific solution of brine he used in some of his experiments. Second, phrasing it the way you did is misleading, as someone unfamiliar with the scale (i.e. most humans on the planet) may interpret it as ""humans feel best at 50F"", which is definitely not true.

The other argument is always that it's more precise. Now, what practical purpose does this serve? If you ask me what the temperature is outside, and I tell you it's 70F, would it make you do anything different than if I said it was 71? Also, if you're just making an estimate, humans are not great at precise measurements of temperatures. No human on the planet will be able to tell whether air or water or whatever feels 75 or 76, they will just say ""it's in the 70s""."
technology,fftc8ko,t1_fftau54,1580216145.0,It seems like neither of us knows the exact number. I'd wager they don't. But I absolutely think marketing guys or managers in those same departments do.
technology,fft9mh0,t1_ffrjl98,1580213507.0,"Your very last sentence I agree with, but everything else - not really. I firmly believe that the self made ultra rich that are few and far between (and by self made I don't consider whether they managed it morally and/or legally or not). The vast majority of them were simply born that way. Some of them do work their asses off to keep it that way, but for most of them the system keeps them rich, it's hard to become poor even if they try with all the protections they have.

Also, you mentioned something about PhD's. Do you think research scientists with all of their PhD's make a lot of money? They really, seriously, don't. Like at all. PhD is probably the best example of how working your ass off does not really bring financial success at all. Some fields are better than others, sure, but even those are far from MBAs or professional degrees or certificates in some areas. And nothing, absolutely nothing comes even close to simply being born to rich parents."

personalfinance,feomkql,t1_fen24v4,1579302218.0,"To add on the other poster's reply - you can be a non-resident alien for immigration purposes, but a resident for tax purposes. After 5 years of presence in the US (you can check online, there is a thing called 'substantial presence test' or something like that), you become a resident alien for tax purposes. This happens regardless of your immigration status/type of visa. From that moment on, for tax purposes you're treated the same as a US citizen or a green card holder. In terms of whether a software supports your residency status, you have to check whether it supports the exact form you're supposed to file (in case you only have 1 income source it's most likely 1040NR)."
facepalm,fejp4ea,t1_fejdoac,1579182180.0,"I'm not sure how many flat earthers are religious, and if that is really what motivates them. I've never met a flat earther, but I know many religious people, and actually most of them are very reasonable and do not deny science. Another problem I have with your explanation is that earth being round is not exactly a recent scientific discovery that in any way contradicts religion. In fact, it's much older than the bible itself."
facepalm,feivuyn,t1_feit9xo,1579148618.0,"Yes, I'm aware of everything that's been happening lately (ok, probably not everything), and flat earth still seems absolutely ridiculous, even with everything in mind. I feel like most conspiracy theories have this ""they lie to us"" aspect, and in most cases you can clearly see where it comes from - someone profits from it.

For example, climate change has sadly become a political issue, but you could tell how someone who wants to profit could benefit from convincing their base that the climate change is a lie told by their opponents, and give them one more reason to hate those opponents and thereby keep the polarized public opinion. Earth being 6000 years old - you can see how that comes as a consequence of confusion over a wrong interpretation of a book that many blindly believe in because again - someone profits from it.

However, with flat earth - I can absolutely not understand the motivation behind it. Like - why would you believe in this? Is there a celebrity that you adore that promotes it? If so - why? Who can gain anything from this? I just can't wrap my head around this."

I just want to add - this is not due to any lack of quality in the main story. But ultimately I just wouldn't say a game is bad because it's worse than The Witcher. That game is an absolute masterpiece, one of the all time best, just comparing anything to The Witcher is already giving it extremely high praise. Oh, and if you haven't noticed, I fucking loved The Witcher."

Yes, that's the name, I forgot it, sorry.

>My area did away with this for all customers about 3 or 4 years ago.  They require converter boxes for all channels.

Well that sucks, sorry about that.

>Even when it did work you had no guide data and the channels would move around several times a month.

This is the beauty actually - Roku TV deals with it beautifully. The system autodetects all the channels and creates a full guide, and IMO their guide is awesome, same as all guides but beautifully designed and I like how it perfectly matches the UI design of the entire system. All around - I prefer it to any other TV guide I've seen. To be fair, I almost never watch live TV and if my ISP does away with ClearQAM I won't get any subscription to replace it.

>Antenna was easier and had better picture quality.

I'd have to disagree here. This is extremely easy (assuming you have a coax splitter and 2 short cables, it comes down to attaching a cable into a socket a couple of times), and the picture quality is whatever your ISP broadcasts, I think most of the channels are full HD, and I never had any issues, with antennas it can get spotty."
cordcutters,fe87buo,t3_envzvb,1578923391.0,"Noone mentioned this, but depending on which ISP you have, you could just get a coax splitter, have one cable going out of it connected to the cable modem (assuming you have cable internet), and the other directly into your Roku TV. If your ISP doesn't scramble the basic channels (many of them don't), you'll get them for free. It's mainly going to be just local channels, and basic national ones like CBS, NBC, ABC, PBS..."
