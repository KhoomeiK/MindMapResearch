And I'm sure you're gonna come back with something along the lines of ""but Cuba is a poor, miserable, repressive dictatorship!"" And first off, if you live in America you are absolutely living in a glass house throwing stones because the majority of the *American* population is poor, miserable, and generally disenfranchised and disengaged from their political system.

Second off, the fact that in spite of the United State's best efforts to undermine Cuba with assassination attempts of its leaders, botched invasions, and strict economic sanctions and embargos, the country *still* manages to exist and is even home to some of the best doctors in the entire world, who often provide humanitarian aid to other countries. But I guess none of that counts as working ""in real life"".

The kicker here is that *this isn't even really communism.* It's a weird chimera of state capitalism and a strong social safety net, just like pretty much every other ""communist"" country that has ever existed.

And I'm sure you're gonna come back with something along the lines of ""well, communism has led to the death of a gazillion fo-fillion people and that's *bad*"" And yeah, communism has led to a lot of death both from governmental oppression and starvation, definitely. But people who spout this talking point are weirdly silent about how many people *capitalism* kills every year due to withholding access to housing, medical care, and food from people who need it not because of a lack of resources but because the market has decided they are not worth keeping alive. Not to mention the wars that are started in the interest of increasing profit or maintaining influence and power in an area. Shit, the entire Iraq War (which is still happening) was a smash and grab for oil and arms contracts and every death that resulted from that should be attributed to capitalism.

Of course, this attitude helps to justify letting people suffer from lack of access to resources that help meet their basic needs. That is, it's a lot easier to say ""hey, numbers don't lie we can't afford to give you health care"" instead of ""we don't want to give you health care."""

And there *way more* racist ones.

I never hear about how illegal Canadian immigrants are bringing crime or are rapists. I wonder why they would be talking about illegal Mexican immigrants in that way...what could be different?

Also, to your point that you made to someone else in this thread:

>I'm just saying that for some reason our legal immigration policy is accused of being racist while even more restrictive immigration policies are not

You know what country has *super strict* immigration policies? Japan. You know what country is *super racist*? [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_issues_in_Japan). 

So this isn't by any stretch an issue that is unique to the US. For fucks sake, the UK is trying to leave the EU because they want stricter immigration policies because... you guessed it, there are a bunch of racist people in Britain that don't like the free travel that the EU allows. Certainly there needs to be a more in-depth statistical analysis but if I were a betting man I'd put my money on there being a direct relationship between ""strict immigration policies"" and racism."

Think a little harder about it then.

There's a reason the president was complaining about people from ""shithole countries"" wanting to come to America, but not people from Norway or Scandinavia.

There's a reason why we hear all about securing the southern border and building a wall, but literally *nothing* about securing the northern border. Surely all these people concerned about securing our borders and keeping illegal immigrants out would want to secure *all of our borders.* Especially when you consider that the [US-Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada%E2%80%93United_States_border) border (3987 mi) is about double the size of the [US-Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico%E2%80%93United_States_border) (1954 mi) border, not even taking into account the border Canada shares with Alaska (another 1538 mi). 

I wonder what else they could be thinking when they're talking about ""illegal immigration""..."

This is such a dumb fucking take for several reasons.

1: If *everyone* goes for a ""profitable"" degree, those degrees will no longer be ""profitable"" due to increased supply of those degree holders.

2: Some degrees and skill sets are necessary for a functioning society and are not ""profitable"", such as teaching.

3: There is inherent value in expanding all facets of humanity's knowledge and the idea of only seeking ""profitable"" knowledge is destructively short-sighted."
