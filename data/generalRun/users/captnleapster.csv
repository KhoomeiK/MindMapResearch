Parentingfails,ffi4ldi,t1_ffi1nav,1579964913.0,"All good, just came across odd as I was just waking up lol
I don’t disagree with your comments on parenting in general. That lady is just a terror - things like calling the cops on neighbors because they left their garage door open all day and it’s against the HOA guidelines.
Or calling the pet control services because someone’s dog pooped in her yard (even though they picked it up) because she felt like the dog wasn’t listening to their owner. Just super silly stuff."
Parentingfails,ffhwq4d,t1_ffhaa5f,1579957301.0,"Not sure how this reply fits to Susan being a horrible person. I’m not referring strictly to that post, she lives in my neighborhood and is a terror to everyone in here. Also not sure what made you want to reply 26 days later."
science,ffdaup4,t1_ffcruwa,1579816884.0,"It’s never brought up that law abiding citizens aren’t the ones who are committing these crimes. Gun owners who follow the proper laws and protocols aren’t the issue and those are the ones that get penalized by stronger legislation.
I’m not against better legislation across the board to help work towards a solution for everyone but there are pieces of this puzzle that never get addressed or brought up.

The fact that criminals will continue to be criminals should be one of the main points in this issue and they will find a way to get weapons no matter what the laws state. We need a better way to handle that problem.

A secondary issue is looking at mental health; happy healthy working individuals don’t have a desire to go shoot up public spaces. Upset and angry people that feel disenfranchised are the ones who do the crimes.

Criminals that plan to shoot up a public space target places where other people don’t have gun or weapons to defend themselves making easy targets. If more people were properly trained and carried, there would be less temptation to attempt mass shootings due to an instant response vs waiting for police to arrive."
WorldOfTanksBlitz,ffb07gr,t1_ffazrv9,1579748577.0,I already said you can PM If you wanted to discuss it further.
WorldOfTanksBlitz,ffazplt,t1_ffayplz,1579748241.0,"Telling someone to fact check some thing implies someone is wrong or incorrect and that you know better. If you’ve done your research you wouldn’t say to fact check something that is facts. 
No one mentioned any specific news organization but if you want to know NBC was one of the first to speak on the current issue in Mexico not fox.
And now you got rude/childish and said to step on a lego?"
WorldOfTanksBlitz,ffayo34,t1_ffay7wh,1579747545.0,"You realize you dropped the “fact check” cliche first when you needed to do the same lol

Sorry you are so easily offended because you repeated the same line that’s repeated on the news over and over. If you just look up recent news you’d know that Mexico is having serious issues on their borders right now with South American migrants. This isn’t new but it finally is hitting more mainstream news networks.

Also if you don’t feel the need to speak about it here, you don’t have to reply but you do. Just educate yourself first if you care about the issue a lot instead of throwing out silly comments."
WorldOfTanksBlitz,ffaxpd4,t1_ffawwns,1579746912.0,"No they made a stink about it being an “insult” and then turned around and spent millions on additional troops to protect the border on their side.

Their population is tired of the drug cartels and human trafficking issues that get pushed from South America through their country into the USA.

You should really look deeper into the situation and not just repeat sound bytes you hear.
Issues stem all the way from Argentina and Venezuela due to the regimes destroying the economy and promises of better life in America, then families get stuck in Mexico with no work and young males get drafted into the cartels.

There’s a whole lot to it than trump saying “let’s build a wall”."
WorldOfTanksBlitz,ffawlaj,t1_ffasnn0,1579746172.0,"I have and since you just said that you might want to as well. Takes a bit of digging, you won’t see it in the slam piece articles but if you go look at the actual government budgets and docs you’ll find the facts. It’s all public record.

investing,femdy9i,t1_fem3xb2,1579250542.0,Ya it’s much more heavily filtered and really seems to side with the most currently dated info being the most relevant which in some cases it’s not the best info at all.

Also once space force is more public that will increase the number drastically. Based on some of the acknowledgement of anti gravity craft being used by the military there’s a strong chance many more have gone to space than we know about.

personalfinance,fedv1dl,t1_fedrgf9,1579020494.0,Yes I follow your math now. For some reason it just wasn’t computing for me but 100% got it now that I’m more awake lol
personalfinance,fedaark,t1_feca4t4,1579005502.0,"Thank you, that kind of summed up what I was trying to figure out. I understand what you are saying that they will only match the first 6% total.
Since they match 50% on the first 2% invested I wasn’t sure if this would apply to both accounts so to have 2% in each seemed like a good idea then anything after would be matched at 33% up to a total of 6%.

So my following question would be whether it was better to put more in the Roth or the traditional which would have a 33% match."
personalfinance,feda3fw,t1_fecrudz,1579005298.0,"Sorry maybe I mis worded it but the company will match 50% of the first 2% invested, then 33% of the next 4% invested maxing out at 6% total. Anything beyond 6% does not get a match. 
Does that explain it better?"
personalfinance,fec3v7b,t1_febyqm4,1578966266.0,"Sorry trying to understand how you got to 8.33%. Is that a “hidden” 2.33% that’s built it to every 401k that occurs prior to the employer match?
Based on the info they sent it seemed like 6% was the cap on their matching and anything beyond was not matched.

Just trying to make sure I understand this correctly."
personalfinance,feai0ot,t1_feaec08,1578948979.0,"Not trying to hi-jack OPs thread but I have been trying to figure out this same situation for my wife's 401k plan as well. She makes around 66k/yr not including some misc overtime.

They offer a 50% match on the first 2% and 33% match for the next 4%. Currently she is putting 6% into her Traditional 401k. Would the matching apply and be worth doing 6% for both the Traditional 401k and the Roth 401k or this a question for the employer?If they do match, it would seem best to put 6% into both account types correct?If they only match on the Traditional or 6% in total, would the 66/33 ratio Traditional/Roth be the best method to move forward? Essentially 4% in traditional and 2% in Roth?"
books,fe6dg9o,t3_enub8m,1578887684.0,"Depends what you are reading. Also clubbing is a bit over rated, as you get older women will want a guy with an IQ not an STD or an alcoholic.

Learning an instrument is a great hobby for many reasons, might be worth adding to the mix if you find one you enjoy.

Sports are fun and a great social activity, if you play them for the social aspect and fitness well worth it; if you play them with the dream of going pro- it’s a big coin toss depending on many factors and luck.

Overall reading can take you very far if you’re learning skills; socializing in the right atmosphere will help a lot as well so you can work on both IQ and EQ."
Futurology,fe6cvnz,t1_fe6cgv1,1578887238.0,"Sadly it’d devolve into neighbor vs neighbor, people wouldn’t even know who to go try to fight but at a certain point the food and water would run low and it’d be every man for himself.

There is no clear target of who to blame on this subject, you can’t round up every business owner - then everyone loses their jobs and business?
