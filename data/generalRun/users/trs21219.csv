While one could definitely argue that fracking done wrong can damage the environment. Getting our power sources off of coal plants is probably a bigger concern than the dangers of fracking. Currently [30% of the power in the US is coal based](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/power-plants/) (as of these 2017 numbers). Natural gas burns way cleaner, especially with the [zero emission type plants](https://qz.com/1292891/net-powers-has-successfully-fired-up-its-zero-emissions-fossil-fuel-power-plant/) that have been constructed recently.

I'm completely fine with states apportioning their EC votes based on popular vote in that state. That would make states like CA more important for Republicans, and states like Texas more for Dems as they would actually get some EC votes out of it.

The difference is that the people of those states should decide how they want their votes for the EC to be tallied. If you're trying to abolish the EC that would require a constitutional amendment which isn't going to happen as states have to ratify.

What is stopping those states from passing laws and measure they want at the state level? Nothing. Smaller states can't get stuff passed at the national level without support from larger, and larger have a hard time without the smaller. Thats pretty balanced to me.

Minority of population, but majority of the states. That's an important distinction.

No one in any city is building tons of low income housing. It's a myth. Low income housing is fought on every block because it drives down home values of properties around it and raises crime.

The real supply of low income housing comes when new higher end stuff is built, which allows people to upgrade/move from their current residence, freeing more behind them as others do the same. Property owners of the older housing stock have trouble filling the space and drop prices.

There is one exception to this. When a city doesn't have enough higher end housing or when they refuse to let it be built. That keeps people where they are and drives up prices across the board.

>2-Developers get heavily subsidised.

While this is generally not a good thing long term, it can incentivize developers to build quicker (look at Manchester now) which helps solve #1

Again related to #1. It shouldn't be long term, but short term this can really pay off for a city as the influx of high income professionals that pay taxes vs them moving somewhere a little further out like Short Pump if there were not high end housing available.

She was apparently asked multiple times to remove her mask and she refused. When others in the crowd were asked by certain officers they complied. Most officers did not ask though because they didnt care. They were cold too. I don't know the details of why they asked her to remove hers, but they did and she refused multiple times.

To be fair there, 2A protestors generally view police with respect and that feeling can be felt by the officers so it becomes mutual. BLM isn't exactly known for that, and you could imagine how an officer is going to give someone less leeway when they are screaming how much of a murderous thug they are for keeping the peace at a protest.

Did anyone in the crowd threaten them? I'm guessing not. In fact I'm guessing that they were very on edge before the rally even took place because of the rhetoric used by the Governor and the media claiming it was some kind of white nationalist rally. Hell even the Vice article you just cited here makes those claims.

There were many people of color in the crowd and I haven't seen a single report of them being discriminated against. In fact they have been celebrated in our community. Guns are for everyone of every race, creed, religion, sexual orientation, etc.

>At the end of the day though I feel hopeful. Common sense gun laws still  passed, nothing violent happened this time, and the more extreme  elements I saw at the rally will hopefully one day be left behind by the  modern conservative/gun movement.

You know, I'm hopeful as well. That people will realize that this was all just drummed up politics to make people look bad. Obviously the FBI identified threats from 6 people they were already watching and I'm glad they did. But you can't label 25,000+ people as white nationalists based on people that were talking about attacking them.

VCDL has been holding those rallies for 18 years (always armed) and there hasn't been any arrests or incidents, ever. This time was obviously bigger and required more planning, security etc but that was to protest some of the craziest proposed bills in the country.

I'm talking about bills like [HB961](http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&typ=bil&val=hb961) which would ban \~70% of all semi autos as it's currently written.

Half of these bills won't increase gun safety or prevent any shootings at all. Hell just today they denied a bunch of bills that were focused on increasing penalties for people violating protective orders with a gun or committing other felonies with a firearm. All because they were proposed by Republicans.

They cite the VA Beach shooting as a reason to pass them but that guy used a handgun, bought a gun legally and passed every background check. How is banning rifles gonna stop something like that?"

Yes, I have my CCW permit in multiple states (referred to as a CPL or Concealed Pistol License here in VA).  

As far as I know, the background check for the CCW is the exact same as the one done when you buy a gun through a dealer. It goes through the same state agency and references the same databases. 

In my experience, the 45+ days I had to wait for my CPL to arrive here in Richmond was just the local government taking their time processing it. Back in PA (where I'm originally from) CCWs are processed in 15 minutes while you wait. 

While I highly encourage anyone who is going to own/carry to take training classes as much as they can, I'm against making them mandatory to exercise a constitutional right (similar to a poll tax or a literacy test to vote). To me it is just another barrier to entry that costs a considerable sum ($200+). It would also cause delays if say you were a woman being stalked by an ex and wanted a CCW permit to protect yourself."

Basically, it removes due process.

Regarding things like the proposed Assault Weapons Ban (HB 961): 8 people were killed with any rifle (even hunting rifles) last year in VA. 8. That's a rounding error when it comes to any gun crime statistic. The majority are killed by stolen handguns. 

I'd propose instead of an AWB which will have almost zero impact on real crime, we instead actually prosecute the people who are caught with illegal guns (instead of letting them plea bargain out for a slap on the wrist), and that we incentivize gun owners even more to get a safe (through tax breaks, etc)."
