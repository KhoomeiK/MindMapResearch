addiction,ff3h4ra,t1_ff3ceny,1579540914.0,Sometimes I don't even know what day it is. It's 9 am and haven't slept. Probably will in the afternoon. I'm a greasy bum. Literally. This is no way to live. Might as well never been born.

addiction,ff3g1l7,t1_ff1cquh,1579540301.0,"Wow, be very careful with it. It's great that they're working for you. I also take them for Anxiety. But I've weened off big time with the help of Clonazepam. Just look out for WD's. They can be brutal. Worse than Benzos. Don't take my word for it. I was on very high doses, though. Up to 1,200 mg daily. I'm down to 300 now. But I also take 2 mg Clonazepam."

depression,ff37902,t3_er2si8,1579535360.0,"I just realized the only thing I had going for me, that I thought I excelled at, IT, was just a lie. Everyone is Tech Savvy now. Which is great for them. But leaves me out in the dust. I've fallen behind big time. Don't know wtf I'm going to do with my life. And I'm not getting any younger. I'm 33 and just getting by. Doing anything to get me by, like Layne Staley (R.I.P.) would say. Hope you make it. And heal."

60 is a medium to strong dose of Prozac. I was on 80 mg but I have OCD. Any updates? Did you start taking it again? How are you doing today?"
AskReddit,ff34cr3,t1_ff0wd9e,1579533357.0,"Desensitization. ""Generic"" porn doesn't cut it anymore, so people move on to other types to get their fix. Similar to drugs. It can have pretty bad consequences. Be careful with that shit. Not much of a porn fan, but the drug part I unfortunately know about."

And make you feel guilty and unsure of yourself. Don't fall in their trap. Ignoring them is the best defense against them."
