I‚Äôve treated for depression and anxiety, which only stimulated my mania, which actually helped to set the diagnosis after years. I am still good at suppressing my mania/covering it up with extensive studying/hard workouts/ night time painting and other things which make me exhausted. This also helps sleep better, helping to push mania off the sight. 
Take care friend :) and also, you should go and confirm the diagnosis with a specialist!"

I used to have terrible insomnia, when i was up to 3 days straight, i was abusing clonazepam then too, coz i just wanted to sleep :( 
I am originally from eastern europe, but now in Australia. Healthcare is damn good here, but pricy. 

So, when i was 18, i moved from my family to university 2k km away from them. I sstarted renting apartments, which i sometimes shared with random people and sometimes with friends. These 8 following souls started there. For example, first one appeared when i needed him the most, he helped me around a lot, but appeared only when i called by name when i was sick to do something or lazy. I kinda new later that he was not really real and that i probs just was doing all that myself. He was cool, but inconsistent. 

The other one got to known in a scary way. I was sharing apartment in a multi-storey house so we had a lift. I used to smoke in between two stairways (my apartment and the lift was 1 stairway up), and before i lit my cig, the lift came up to the level i was. The door opened and closed, repeated twice. I thought it were neighbours but the lift left again. I was about to lit the cig again when the lift arrived to our floor again. It was opening and closing again several times. I waited and it came back. By the time i heard the doors close, i ran upstairs to my apartment door, and got inside before the doors opened again. I shut it and spent the night awake in the kitchen, because the lift was going till 5 in the morning, always returning to our floor level and opening for several times. It wasn‚Äôt my most terrifying experience, but i shat my pants that night. 

I also hallucinated a dog several times. Fun is that i had a physical impact from an invisible for my friends dog, who were around when it happened. I have many other paranormal stories, which i also was certain they are true bcoz i had some superstitious friends who believed me? Like these ‚Äúcreepy possessed lift‚Äù one. 

Regarding voices, i did hear them a lot a while ago. There were people in my head, then i was like tuning on some random radio of strangers discussing something at public and private places. 

I honestly don‚Äôt even know  what i am doing and why i am loading you with all these unnecessary stupid details. I am so so sorry üôÉ unmedicated world was much more interesting lol. 

Do you ever feel you could never eeven go thru all the small important things you want, but then realise it is impossible and not really important and nothing really would change from it?"

I don‚Äôt have insurance, and i am not a resident of country i am in rn. 
My relationship...it is not that abusive. He does not understand and probably accept that i am sick and how the sickness works. My psych said it is the kind of personality, call it ‚Äúengineer‚Äù or ‚Äúbusinessman‚Äù way of thinking. Anything emotional freaks him out and he doesn‚Äôt know what to do or what to say. I am not defending him, it is what i was told after similar things. The funny thing is that goes off me like that verrry rarely and when he is overstressed himself. I am also standing up for myself when it is unfair to me like that, but it gives me anxiety attack and all-body-shaky-shaky. 
Psychosis? I thought that it seems like it is starting. But am i (hypo)manic? Can i be manic if my sleeping time decreased insignificantly: from 11-12 hours to 8-9. This is still plenty, right? Bad bad psychosis started with sleep deprivation for me, but 8-9h a day is barely deprivation to me. Right?? And i analysed myself too many times to know that i kinda always had mild hallucinations from time to time, but before i believed i had interdimentional powers and could communicate with parallel worlds. I also believed there are 8 souls that follow me whereever i go and if i go to bad places, they stick with me forever. So i still believe in that a little bit, but after i was put on seroquel, they are quiet. 

I take 600mg seroquel, 400 mg valproate acid, 1-2 mg clonazepam. 

Again, thank you for the talking to me. I felt desperate."

Unfortunately for me, i can‚Äôt drink alcohol at all. I don‚Äôt know what feels like to be drunk. My experience is a number of blackouts from a small drink/half a normal drink, at public places. It‚Äôs probably the opposite end of alcohol reaction of yours, but as extreme?  Again, i am not a drinker, but maybe mixing alcohol with some soft drinks would reduce their negative health effect and make it easier to take control over the habit? If you are interested in that, of course. 

I haven‚Äôt watched House, sorry. Idk if you watched it, or it could be even triggering, but i loved the ‚ÄúFilth‚Äù with James McAvoy. It doesn‚Äôt have a happy end, so if you are unstable it might be very unpleasant to watch. But it may be even not your cup of tea. It is about a mental illness, and man, it feels very much home.

bipolar,fcwydxf,t1_fcwnr2s,1578042959.0,"Hmmm you started with, what you call a problem, which to me is certainly more of the opposite. You reckon you‚Äôd enjoy being religious, or it‚Äôd help with let‚Äôs say alcohol issue? I honestly have never been religious and I confronted my family on that reason. Not to oppose anyone‚Äôs opinion, but i thank that the will to not drink/do drugs/or just not being a dick should be in place despite presence or absence of religion. 
I mean, if you want to quit drinking, would it require one imaginary, non-caring, egoistic phantom to exist? 

I am glad to hear though, that you got friends who understand and support, family. This so crucial in the healing process. As well as supporting, it‚Äôs important there is no pressure on you. 

Ugh, i agree with you on contradictions! So true!! I am somewhat stable currently and wanted to start cutting on my seroquel, but oh boy i am scared it triggers manic behaviour. It is so hard to remind myself that this might be not my permanent condition and everything can change in a nutshell. As i become happier, I can‚Äôt restrain myself from thinking that episodes will come back and from reminding my family i can go off the wheels any moment. This sucks. 

What kind of drink you prefer? I am more into weed. I am in WA, btw, not far from Perth :) are you close to the fires?"

C‚Äômon, it‚Äôs not pathetic at all. We all do this, we all needs this. Knowing, that there are people that struggle and, most importantly, win against similar issues i go thru, help as much as therapy for me.  when i was diagnosed bipolar by 4th doctor and finally accepted it, it‚Äôs been a rough time. Then i found this sub and spent nights and days reading it thru posts and replies and i was astonished how common my problems were in this community. 

Do you drink throughout the day? Sorry for asking, pure curiosity. Alcohol might interact with meds, if you are taking any, and rarely the interaction is positive. Could that be the issue for extra challenges for you?"

I absolutely understand and can relate to your situation with the work and unpleasant thoughts on myself/life/etc., but i can assure you it is not always like that. I have f_cked up with several jobs i had, and literally ghosted all of them after working there reasonable amount of time (from 1 month to 1 year). Once i went full manic and psychotic, and it ruined my career. I struggled for 5 months with mania and then fell in depression for another 5, and of course i just bailed. I also was very young and i had no idea i was bipolar. I was then first diagnosed, but i shook the idea off. Haven‚Äôt been medicated or treated for last 5 years of knowing that i might be bipolar, and i am now on meds since July. I also went thru cycle of mania/depression since then as meds were kicking in.
This is where i want to emphasise, that healing and becoming happier is possible and real! I believe that right medication and environment can do wonders. It is just 3-4 weeks when woke up being ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or something like that. And it felt weird for a while. This sub has helped me when i needed support, it gave me support I couldn‚Äôt ask irl. Since then i am here almost everyday, it matters to me. 

It is not our fault that we happen to be with chemical imbalance in the brain. We are not what we do at being manic or depressed."

I understand, that I don‚Äôt know you personally, but i just the way you type gives away that you are genuinely nice. 
If anyone needs forgiveness or whatever act of kindness from You, it is YOU! This may sound too much, but i truly stand by this. You deserve it!"
