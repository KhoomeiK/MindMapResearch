india,ffpvzr3,t1_ffpvt7b,1580107862.0,So you are friends with Muslims too. Ask them about what is ghazwa-e-hind? They will tell you that it is written in the hadiths but not all hadiths are considered authentic that's why they don't follow that concept. Same is the case with smritis. There are many smritis written by many rishis of ancient time. But they don't represent Hinduism and are not accepted by various schools of Hinduism.
india,ffpvtqg,t1_ffpvick,1580107667.0,"Treating women in a Conservative fashion is the problem of Indian people. This does not mean that Hinduism is bad. Currently, I am reading Bhagwat Geeta and suddenly someone online comes and says all Hindus follow manusmriti and Hinduism is bad. How would I feel? You are targeting a religion based on your experience of their followers. And that too who have conservative thoughts. But still, let me tell me manusmriti isn't part of our Vedic system. And it is not followed by Hindus is the modern time. Today's Hindus don't even read the Vedas or Geeta let alone manusmriti."

wholesomereddit,ffpue2f,t1_ffpuc17,1580106081.0,So if a large number of people are protesting in shaheen bagh. That means something. And what are the results of that protest going to be?

wholesomereddit,ffpu73b,t1_ffpu43s,1580105867.0,So a Reddit community can do something this big? Nah I don't think so. All Muslim women are on the streets. Why?
Chodi,ffpu2er,t1_ffptulv,1580105725.0,"Lol bro. There are many people as same as us in the cities who don't need a reservation. And there are many brahmins who are poor living in villages. Make it on the economical basis na. Why are you justifying it. You say they are poor but want reservation on the basis of caste. Don't say that. Say we want to uplift the poor, be it from any caste and we want to provide them reservation. That would be far more productive."

Chodi,ffps2lh,t1_ffprn1t,1580103668.0,"Specific? If you have some friends in different universities ask them who generally fails and drops out and also ask them why they dropped out? Was it financial conditions or they just failed in their examinations? Mind you I never said about financial conditions. I said I want a reservation for them and even in college their fees is very much affordable. They drop out because they fail. And the education system didn't fail them. They got the same education as us in the same fucking classroom and the same teacher. Still, they fail. If you are so blind to see this I can't help you. Reservation on the basis of caste is really creating a problem. And let it continue further, you are going to see this eventually. Recently someone on bakchodi posted about how he got so high marks but couldn't get post-graduation college because he is a brahmin male. Now he is planning to go abroad to study. That's the failure of our country. That's a loss to our country. But you are too blind to see both sides of the situation. I recognise the problems of poor people but you can't ignore the problems this is creating for us."
india,ffprddr,t3_euj71n,1580102988.0,Check my post history. My friend although isn't any party supporter. But he really loved when 370 was gone. Their path to resettlement is also in making. Hope for the best.
wholesomereddit,ffpr8yh,t1_ffpqf8r,1580102873.0,Hope so. Lol
Chodi,ffpr88a,t1_ffpqmr0,1580102853.0,"No, I don't assume I am entitled to something. I got my seat in university by my hard work. I had 40,000 AIR and got my state university and another guy had 3,40,000 and he was also in the same batch. But he couldn't clear the first year and dropped out. This is also the main problem with the reservation. They assume they are entitled to a seat by studying so little. No wonder most of them drop out of engineering and medical colleges. See these problems also.   

And you are assuming all sc/st are poor people who don't have money for coaching and schooling. I am all in for giving quota to those poor people. But if someone is living in urban areas, getting equal treatment, have more money than us, why is he entitled to get a reservation? 

Don't you think those people who are sc/st and have good financial conditions should leave their reservation so that the actual poor guy can get it?

Heck, they are even protesting to get a reservation in promotion. Wtf is this shit?"
