depression,ff8bikt,t3_es3msr,1579671898.0,Been there. Past suicide attempts have ruined a couple of really good pieces of music for me.
ptsd,fesfyhy,t3_eqia8u,1579364776.0,Not really no. I tried this medicine (prazosin) that’s supposed to help w nightmares but stopped taking it because it made my blood pressure too low.
ptsd,fesd8s5,t3_eqdymd,1579364060.0,Another one with the same energy for me is when I get an email from my boss saying “come find me in my office.”
gradadmissions,fdsubwj,t1_fdssnvh,1578708044.0,"I don’t mean dressy like you’d wear it to a gala. I mean a shoe that’s nicer than a sneaker but comfortable to walk in. For example, I have a pair of flats that I wear to conferences (and funerals lol) for that purpose. 

I’m not sure what dress clogs are, but so long as they’re nicer than a sneaker and comfortable I think it’s probably fine.

Edit: wait, or did you mean dress clogs are a unicorn shoe? I might have misunderstood"
gradadmissions,fdssgzp,t3_emx8kf,1578707360.0,"I’d recommend wearing shoes that are dressy but comfortable, like a nicer pair of flats that you’ve already broken in. Idk what interviews are like in your field, but when I interviewed I did a lot of walking all over campus and my feet hurt a lot by the end of the day. 

Overall make sure you’re comfortable in what you have on. Looking professional is important but it’s more important that you can communicate well with your interviewer, which is hard to do if you’re itchy, hot, in pain, etc."
depression,fdspoxf,t1_fdsotn6,1578706335.0,"Exactly. The way I see it, it could go three ways:
1. Turns out it’s a tumor. We treat the tumor, and by treating the tumor we’ve cured a lot of my mental/physical health problems. Problem solved, best case scenario 
2. Turns out it’s a tumor and it can’t be treated. I die. Problem solved, second best case scenario 
3. Turns out it’s not a tumor and I’m just an unlucky person with a lot of health problems. Everything is the same as before, worst case scenario"
depression,fdsobp7,t3_emnl5m,1578705839.0,Here’s a fun anecdote: I recently learned that a lot of my mental and physical health issues could be caused by a particular tumor. I’m in the process of finding out if it’s a tumor or not. And I’m actually rooting for the tumor tbh.
schizophrenia,fdm5k3g,t3_elwlkl,1578540325.0,Yes. It’s my retirement plan actually
dating_advice,fdhp2w0,t1_fdhosez,1578427325.0,I’m married but thanks for the tip lol
ptsd,fdhojlf,t3_ele5s6,1578427009.0,"Yeah I’m in grad school now and I kinda hate the other students tbh. I know it’s not their fault for being healthy happy and high-achieving, but couldn’t they just be worthless underachievers for a change?"
dating_advice,fdho8rx,t3_eleoxp,1578426830.0,"I’m the unhappy person in this scenario

Edit: ok I am unhappy but I was mostly joking. I do have depression but I’m still worthwhile person."
