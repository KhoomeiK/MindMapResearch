First, people will take the bus more for short trips.  Three stops say.  Distances they could have walked, but if the bus is free, why not take it.  

Second, it's not a small amount of money for some people.  The cheapest busses near me are $2.50, so that's $5/day, or over $100/month.  Some busses are more expensive -- anything that goes across a bridge is at least double that, so now we're talking at least $200/month.  At that price you're not saving much money over owning a car.

I agree that 2-3 busses an hour aren't enough, but it's not bad if you live near the route and have an app that tells you when they're coming.

I avoid busses for health reasons as much as monetary ones -- I like cycling and I don't like being stuck in confined places with sick people.  Prices won't fix that."

First because it's victim blaming.

> It's just a necklace and it's not like saying women shouldn't wear this if they dont want to be assaulted.  Completely different.

This is like something Trump would say.  It is EXACTLY like telling a woman she shouldn't wear something to be assaulted.  You're literally telling her not to wear something so she won't be called nasty things.

Second because it's a point of pride.  If people tell me not to do something that I have every right to do, I'm certainly going to continue doing it.

Third, it's also a point of pride about her religion.  As a Jewish person it feels like there are many places where open hatred of Judaism is tolerated, and there are several Scandinavian cities that fit the bill.  I suspect she is just as upset about the antisemitism she is witnessing as she is shocked about the behavior she is being subject to.

> Also, what other solutions do you guys offer? There isn't any.

How about support your friend and stand up for her when people assault her for no reason?

Some variants may be ""beneficial"" for one trait while ""detrimental"" to other traits.  And who cares if something is ""beneficial"" anyway?

Any complex trait that racist people are probably going to care about (musculature, intelligence, height, whatever) is made up of the aggregated effects of millions of variants.  Take height as an example.  Googling quickly, the top 697 variants explain 21% of height variation but the top 9500 variants only explain 29% of height variation, and a total of ~80% of height variation is due to genetics.  Overall we can estimate that there are millions of variants that each contribute a very small amount (less than a mm each) to the height of an individual, and most of these variants cannot even be identified with current methods.  The fact that one such variant might be more or less common in an African population says very little about the overall height distribution.

[Edit: To be clear, variants differ in terms of population frequencies.  Some variants may be more or less common in African and non-African populations.  Any individual in Africa might or might not have a variant that is common or uncommon in Europe.]

I understand why you would want to understand this, but I'm saying that it's probably a losing proposition.  A racist person gets to pick and choose their own data and definitions for when it suits them and the field is so complex that it's going to be difficult to argue with them tit for tat.  They also get to define what ""race"" means to them, what ""inferior/superior"" means to them, and they get to continue altering their definitions until they come across something that can't be disproven immediately.

Rather than trying to learn about individual variants, I think it makes more sense to take a step back and understand the overall problems with racist logic in the first place."

I'm a computational geneticist.  These sites are pretty good if you're interested in geneology or ancestry.  As far as actual medical advice, you can use them for screening but it's best to get re-tested by a medical professional if you have any actual medical concerns (the error rate is very very small but nonzero, which doesn't matter for relatedness but might matter for simple diseases).

There are privacy concerns.  Right now it's illegal for insurance companies to discriminate on the basis of DNA -- congress passed GINA in 2008 with bipartisan support (only one person in the House or Senate voted against it).  However, the Republicans are fucking crazy so who knows how long that's going to last, and there was at least one recent attempt (HR 1313) to screw us.

The other privacy concern, as you've implied, is that if I have data from your parents or lots of your other relatives then I can guess at your genetics pretty accurately.

You might also be concerned that some of your family members might find out they're not related to who they think they are (if someone in your family tree slept around then you'll all find out).

If it makes you feel better, there are a few populations that have been genetically tested very thoroughly.  I think something like half the population of Iceland has been genotyped, and the family trees are so well known that the other half can be predicted pretty accurately.

I don't keep track of minor issues that I come across -- more on that later.

> More precisely, how do you falsify a cluster analysis or a statement that effectively amounts to ""whoa isn't this cluster of genes really neat and biologically relevant""?

Hot take: a lot of people don't trust cluster analyses for this reason.  However, you could say the same thing about a lot of other assays.  Say I do a GWAS and I publish my manhattan plot and my qq plot and I find a few hits for bipolar disorder.  What then?  It isn't valueless work, it just requires someone else to take a next step.

>How do you prove that somone p-hacked parameters and methods in order to come to a conclusion, when the conclusion itself is ambiguously stated?

Yeah there's a growing push to make everything publicly available.  Data, code, analysis notebooks, etc.  I'm for this.  It's too easy to screw up deliberately or by accident, and there's no reason to wall off published work.

People do find fraud by p-hacking, I'm not sure about bioinformatics in particular though.  My favorite is Brian Wansink.  But you need to read papers critically when you look at them and there's a lot of crap out there.

Going into further depth, it's easier to talk about bioinformatics methods than analyses.  Say you want to publish a method.  You submit it to a journal.  The reviewers hopefully try out the method before it gets published.  As a reviewer I've rejected papers that claimed to have a working method but didn't.  Then maybe it gets published and people try to use it.  I've used new methods many times, and they rarely run without error the first time I try them.  So I email the author, they always get back to me (so far), sometimes they fix it.  Then if it actually runs, I test it myself on null and/or simulated data.  Sometimes I get weird results.  If I do then I don't use it, and I talk about it with the author and my coworkers and collaborators.  If nobody uses a method because the results are weird then that's another filter.  If lots of people use it then it becomes successful and more widely checked.

bioinformatics,fc4yg57,t1_fc2uqta,1577433909.0,"A cluster is a group of say 1,000 CPUs that you can ask to run tasks for you.  For example, you might ask each CPU to run the same simulation with different initial conditions.  Many universities have one.  AWS (amazon web service) is another example of one.  None of us do everything on our own PCs.

What I suggest is to first get access to a cluster and figure out what kind of machines it runs.  Then get a machine that runs the same or similar operating system.  If it's linux or unix-based, then a Mac or Linux box might work.  It can be useful to run things locally to debug and then put them on the cluster to do the real work.

Also your boss should pay for your work computer or at least give you access to one."

> The end goals of academia is solely publications and grants -- no exaggeration

I disagree with this for several reasons.  Grants and publications are the bare minimum but they're not the end goals.

First, I'm not sure how to define ""end goal"".  These are some of the ways in which people are judged, but they're not the only way.  Departments hire PIs that fit well into their existing research structure and have compelling research plans.  That's not necessarily the most highly published person.

Second, people usually get into the field to work on problems they think are important or interesting.  A PI might focus on trying to cure cancer, or developing CRISPR-Cas9.  What was the industry failure that led two academic research groups to develop CRISPR-Cas9 but not one Merck or Amgen?  Grants and publications aren't unimportant, but they're not the reason why you might focus on a given subject or work on a given project.

Projects that end successfully and are deemed to be important by the community tend to result in good publications.

If you don't get grants and don't have publications then yeah that's a problem -- but like I said, those things are just the bare minimum and yeah, some people struggle to get them.

> The end goals of industry are to have a working product that people actually want to buy

No the goal is to maximize short-term (say 5-10 year) profit.  That could be achieved through firing people or raising drug prices rather than investing in research.

> Academia in bioinformatics does not need to demonstrate a working product or societal value

I don't know why you think this is any more true than industry...

> Theranos is the exception that proves the robustness of industry -- they were eventually caught. Where are the theranos stories from Academia? Do you think academic theranos's don't exist?

Are you asking for examples of academic misconduct?  There's a wikipedia article here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scientific_misconduct_incidents  If you want Theranos level behavior, maybe try these guys: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SchÃ¶n_scandal, https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/health/dr-piero-anversa-harvard-retraction.html.  

These guys were found out because people tried to replicate their work and couldn't.  I've come across several cases of fraud in academia.  They don't make headlines because they're not the business models of multi-billion dollar companies."
bioinformatics,fc4u1gi,t1_fc3uuxh,1577428414.0,"Define highly paid?  Let's go with 6-figures as a decent salary for an academic?

A couple days ago I downloaded the salaries and job titles from the University of California (all UCs) from 2018.  I forget where I found the document (titled ""university-of-california-2018.csv"") but it's publicly available online (I just googled for it).  Here are the column titles: Employee Name, Job Title, Base Pay, Overtime Pay, Other Pay, Benefits, Total Pay, Total Pay & Benefits, Year, Notes, Agency, Status.

There are 63 people with the job title of ""Bioinformatics Progr[ammer?] 4"", of whom almost all have 6 figure pay + benefits (40ish have a 6-figure base salary).  For ""Bioinformatics Progr[ammer?] 3"", roughly 2/3 make 6-figures.  The top level is level 5.  You can get a level 3 or 4 position straight out of grad school.

There are 5 managers listed, the median total pay + benefits is $180K.

Senior statisticians (there are 38) make an average of about 6-figures.

There are other data-related jobs I'm leaving out in the interest of time and effort, but most of them have 6-figure salaries at higher levels and manager jobs are typically in the $200K range (but maybe that counts as a PI?).

Of course I get that industry positions pay more than that."
AskAcademia,fc4f0pp,t3_efworv,1577414763.0,"Surprising amount of toxicity in the responses here.

I think you should do what you want, just be upfront about it.  

-Funding the F student shouldn't hurt the M student.

-Deciding not to fund the F student because the M student started at the same time might feel weird.

-Funding both of them if you decide to do that will still help female students (I think it disproportionally helps underrepresented groups to fund everyone better)

I can't tell you what I would do without knowing your funding situation better.  If we're talking $1500/semester or something then I'd probably just fund both of them.  If we're talking grad student salaries then maybe you need to think about it."
AskAcademia,fc4eh1c,t1_fc465j2,1577414316.0,It's not necessarily a zero-sum situation though.  Funding everyone better probably helps underrepresented groups more than everyone else.

tennis,fc3kvix,t1_fc2jkks,1577392083.0,He worked hard in his prime until he hit #1.  Then he got tired of working.  I wouldn't say it was a total waste.  Kyrgios plays hard some matches but he's never had such a sustained period of effort.  Rios' play style was also a lot more brutal.
bioinformatics,fc3e0a3,t3_efy6sd,1577387711.0,"Yeah I started that other thread.  Bioinformatics and computational genetics and related fields sort of get lumped together.  I don't really work on pipelines.  I do push data through pipelines but mostly I do basic research.

For me what it boils down to is that I get to work on more interesting exploratory problems (as far as I can tell) that have fewer applications for some sort of end product.  But really I'm talking more about the difference between research and development rather than the difference between industry and academia.  There are some real industry research positions but I think they're pretty rare."

bioinformatics,fc16lx8,t1_fc140ik,1577309737.0,"Yeah I agree.  I think there are opportunities on either side.  On the one hand, a wet-lab person or an MD with a weak (but not non-existent) computational background could learn how to actually analyze data.  On the other hand, a bioinformatician could learn about this specific disease subfield before going out and establishing their own research group.  We're not the bioinformatics department so we're not going to spend all our time working on methods, but there might be space for methods research as a side project.  This is again an advertising issue.  Thanks for pointing it out!"
bioinformatics,fc10o0s,t1_fc0xflg,1577304895.0,"1. It's probably a bigger gap than that!

2. Yeah it depends on your end goal.  If you're trying to become a data scientist then I agree you shouldn't go this route.  I'm not convinced that bioinformatics is more interesting in industry than academia but YMMV.

3. Well that depends on a lot of other factors and the background of the candidate, but I agree that tenure is tough to obtain and not even desirable for a lot of people.

Glad things are working out for you :)"
