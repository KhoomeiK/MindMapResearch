college,ffiovdr,t1_ffijo8i,1579979049.0,You have paperwork to that effect - that they acknowledged and waived it?
college,ffijjbi,t1_ffii2iw,1579975379.0,"So, is a new requirement or one that they missed?"
college,ffihttd,t3_ettraj,1579974214.0,Are they truly adding a new requirement or did they miss that you had not fulfilled a pre existing requirement?
college,ffihkk4,t1_ffi5w61,1579974042.0,"Not really.  You can always ask, but it would be an atypical arrangement."
college,ffhxdpa,t1_ffht0h6,1579958064.0,"It’s virtually always teaching assistant or research assistant work, and it will always be in the department in which you’re studying. The assistantships are funded at the department level, so one department (finance) would never pay you to work in another (engineering)."
boatbuilding,ffgbjpl,t3_env7v1,1579902614.0,"I split the difference on my canoe - epoxy fillets and fiberglass tape on the hull joints, inside and out; PL Premium anywhere else I needed sticky - gunwales, breasthooks, seat frames.

I did not epoxy over the whole hull.  On the outside of the hull I put multiple coats of exterior paint and then polyurethane on top of that.  Poly only on the interior of the hull.

Finished it right at the end of the season and only got it out twice, then I used it for the entirety of this past season.  Still looks good and ready to go come warm weather again.  I have no idea how many seasons I'll actually get out of it."
college,ffg5cvq,t3_eta0ey,1579898802.0,"r/College is about the college experience, but not so much about applying to college.  High schoolers or others looking for advice about the process or specific schools are encouraged to try r/ApplyingToCollege or r/collegecompare.  We think you'll get more and more meaningful responses in those kinds of subs.  Good luck!"

college,ffg53ig,t3_etaphu,1579898644.0,"Many university graduate programs offer tuition waivers and stipends to graduate students regardless of their citizenship.  Typically these are Ph.D. programs, but sometimes master's programs.  You just apply for admission and funding.  Look for programs that interest you, then reach out to the director of graduate admissions to ask questions about funding opportunities."

college,ffg4g49,t3_etfiqs,1579898247.0,You've got to at least give them the opportunity to buy you out or find someone acceptable to them.  You can't force a roommate on other people.
college,fffcwc1,t3_etc36o,1579881185.0,"We're glad you want to contribute to r/college, but there are some things we try to avoid, and your post was removed because it falls into one of those areas. 

Examples include but are not limited to:

We do hope you'll post again in the future with a good discussion-oriented topic."
college,fff5mju,t1_ffegkre,1579876311.0,"When it's a high karma redditor, I give it a second and third thought.  The karma isn't remotely a pass, but it is a reason to give pause.

In all cases banned redditors are able to message the mods, and maybe 1/3 of the time they do (and one or two never freaking stop).  On occassion we do un-ban people after conversation.  

We, perhaps unsurprisingly, never unban people who are apoplectic and just go off on us.  We rarely unban people who are just sorry and promise never to do it again.  We usually unban people who convince us that they truly did not advocate or engage in piracy with whatever they posted.

My guess is that I end up unbanning 5% of the people I ban; I can't speak for the other mods.  I never unban someone that another mod banned, though I do sometimes get involved in the modmail conversation if I have an opinion.

This same process, by the way, applies to removed posts as well.  When I'm not on mobile I always add a removal reason (stupid mobile doesn't have the option).  Sometimes post authors message us, and we sometimes re-approve the post.  Far and away the posts we most frequently reapprove are those removed by our Automod rules.  Again, the mod who removed is typically the mod who re-approves, though any of us will happily overrule Automod.  Just a couple of us actively maintain the Automod rules, but nothing is really controversial."
