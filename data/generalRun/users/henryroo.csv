>Never occurred to me it was strabismus that allowed me to 'switch my eyes'

I have a very distinct memory of suddenly realizing that I could switch my eyes when I was 20 years old, having never previously been able to pick one in any way other than physically blocking my dominant eye with my hand. Brains are weird and I'm sure everyone experiences this type of condition differently, but it's interesting to think about what types of experiences we all have in common."

>Me: ""HEA""

>Worker: Please read all the letters

>Me, after looking back in: I only see 3 letters

>Worker: there are 5 letters, please read all the letters

I put my face back in there and thought about it for a few seconds, then realized what was up and switched to my right eye for the last few letters. I passed, but the worker looked at me like I was one of the dumber people she'd met LOL"
worldnews,ffpoole,t1_ffpcrs2,1580100526.0,"> I cringe just thinking about that whole situation and that innocent man who killed himself over it.

He committed suicide a month before the bombing occurred. Pretty ironic that you're in here spreading misinformation while talking about how embarrassing it is when that happens on Reddit."
