They’ve ruined the word gender so unfortunately you have to make it clear now that homoSEXuals are attracted to the same sex, and biSEXuals are attracted to both sexes. Society is starting to move backwards and apparently conversion therapy for gay people is cool in 2020. It’s super depressing."

LGBDropTheT,ffjdm8d,t1_ffj0jov,1579996053.0,"That’s what gets me the most, especially with the straight ones. They literally chose any “oppression” they face, and they aren’t even oppressed! Not being able to creep on women in a locker room or have gay men fuck you because you’re a woman is not oppression. I literally can’t think of a thing that they face which I would qualify as true oppression."
itsafetish,ffilovx,t3_ett5sn,1579976865.0,"Newsflash dude, people aren’t taking you seriously anymore because you’re a (probably 45 year old) dude in a dress and poorly done makeup. The rest of these things, if true, are because you are pumping your body full of drugs and hormones that it wasn’t meant to handle. I guess I’m glad that he finally accepted that he was gay though, even though there seems to be a ton of self hatred there."

It doesn’t hurt that bad.” While I was bleeding everywhere and writhing in pain.

They’re political all over our work chat and, of course, they’re always right about everything and anyone who disagrees is a bigot and on the wrong side of history.

TumblrInAction,ff7e9x7,t1_ff6e0iv,1579647544.0,"Right. The person that you’re responding to seems to think that believing you are something, actually makes you that thing. I can pretend that I’m a vampire all that I want, it doesn’t actually make me a vampire. I heard the whole gEnDeR iS a SoCiAl CoNsTrUcT argument in college too, which is just dumb. They’re pretty much saying that you are what you attempt to poorly mimic. I don’t know what a vampire, Tiger, man, whatever feels like and any way that I would try to LARP as one would be factually incorrect since I have zero knowledge of what it feels like to be those things. Gender and sex are the same. They changed the meaning of the word gender around the time that pervert doctor, John Money attempted to turn that child into a girl after a botched surgery."
TumblrlnAction,ff7c35r,t1_fcq9ozc,1579646056.0,"Because they are effecting women when they take our scholarships, our places in professional and collegiate sports, increase women’s crime statistics, infiltrate women’s prisons and rape them in there, creep on us in bathrooms and locker rooms, change the biological language that we use to describe our bodies (a vagina is not a front hole, for gods sake), attempt to bully and force lesbians and gay men into sleeping with them, get women’s rape crisis shelters defunded and then nail dead rats to the door, get women jailed or fired for “misgendering” (yes, this happened in the UK), permanently alter the lives of children by putting them on hormones and Lupron when they aren’t even old enough to drink, along with a host of other things. No one had a problem when it wasn’t impacting others. Now it is, and now we do. Idgaf what someone does if it doesn’t impact me. Check out r/thisneverhappens for some examples of this. Every single thing that I mentioned has actually happened to women because of this nonsense. You all are on the wrong side of history. We’re done."

Normal people are not that narcissistic and weird. It’s so obvious that myth was made up by a TIM and they all jumped on it. I also find it hilarious that they claim to be women while acting so much like men, though it backs up that they only think of us as hollow, brainless sex shells. GTFO of here with that shit."
itsafetish,ff3hfdj,t3_ere8a4,1579541099.0,"As completely disgusting as this is, I am slightly comforted by the fact that no actual woman was raped since she would have been immediately able to tell what his wound was by sight, taste and smell. Unless he was raping Hellen Keller with a nasal blockage, this never happened and is just a disgusting fantasy of this pervert. It’s terrifying that these people walk among us, but at least their extreme body mods make it easy to recognize and stay away from them."

TumblrInAction,fez241l,t1_fewvat8,1579453131.0,"They aren’t women!!! It is biologically impossible. I’m not going to tell lies because someone is incapable of accepting who they are. These are men with a mental illness/ fetish/ internalized homophobia who are forcing women to accept them in their sports, rape shelters, bathrooms, prisons, changing rooms and other private places where women do not want men for very good safety reasons. These men are stealing women’s records and scholarships. I will not call them women because they are men, and they should be ashamed of themselves for appropriating the female sex and removing our right to sex segregated spaces. Woman is not a costume."
TumblrInAction,fewrfbr,t1_fewpb49,1579418377.0,"“Transwomen” are men and are not systematically oppressed around the world for their biological sex. While of course I care about men as humans, why on earth would I care about them in regards to inequalities that they literally never face? Do men go through any of the things that I listed above? No, they do not. I’m lucky that I live in a country where women have a lot of freedoms, but that is not the case for many women around the world. You sound like someone who cares way more about the feelings of men in dresses than about women being honor killed for being born as biological, actual women. Stop it, dude."
TumblrInAction,few83ge,t1_fevr9wa,1579406722.0,"There is no such thing as a female brain. That is tired sexist malarkey. Men can not be women nor do they have any idea what it’s like to be something that they are not. Women in many countries around the world are not aborted for their sex, forced into mensuration huts that many die in, forced into arranged marriages, forced to keep their rapists babies, forced into modesty/ subservient roles, treated like property, and many other horrors because they “identify as women.” This happens because they are biologically of the female sex. Kindly shut the fuck up with your backwards bigoted ideas that imply that women choose their oppression. They do not. Men with a mental illness/ fetish/ internalized homophobia are NOT women. Gtfo of here with that bullshit."

TumblrInAction,feutorn,t1_fetvfzc,1579389783.0,"You typically don’t. At least not to any that I’ve ever been to, and I’ve been to around four so far. The hosts provide the food and, at some point, the parents and the guests find out the sex of the baby together, usually in some color coded fashion (pink for a girl or blue for a boy). I’ve seen this done in three ways so far. Once the father had a baseball pitched to him, and when he hit it, it exploded into pink smoke. Once the parents opened the ribbon on a white box, and pink and blue balloons came out (fraternal twins). Twice, the parents had a white (or other neutral colored) iced cake and when they cut into it, the cake inside was pink or blue. Personally, I think it’s cute and fun. I don’t know why people get so salty about it.

Edit: nobody knows the sex because when the doctor learns it, rather than tell the parents, he writes it down and seals it in envelope. The parents then take the envelope to a cake shop (or wherever) to have the surprise reveal made.

AmItheAsshole,fesri8y,t1_fesi3m3,1579368253.0,"Right? I can’t believe the number of people on this thread responding with “NTA.” What ever happened to just being a nice person and neighborly? I’ve found probably four lost pets in my life and had chips scanned/ taken them in until the owners could come get them, which was never very long. I would never accept money for doing the right thing and returning someone’s family to them. Have these people never had a pet get out?

All of those roles reversed work well.Race is sometimes, but rarely, relevant. (Im obsessed with Stephen King’s dark tower series. He described Clint Eastwood pretty much, for Rowland. Idris Elba was an amazing Rowland. Too bad the movie blew). The rare occasion that I can think of in which it matters is if it’s historically or culturally relevant. But can we not have men playing women? That’s currently really relevant. Women are still oppressed in so many areas, in so many countries. Gay men and women are still largely oppressed in the same way, often way worse. That’s just not chill. Also, in the example described it’s still essentially rape culture. Lesbians are attracted to adult human females. Gay men are attracted to adult human males. I’m straight but I can’t stand this narrative that we pick our sexuality. They have to stop doing this.
