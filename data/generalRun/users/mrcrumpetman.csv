offmychest,fe90k70,t3_eo4j99,1578932884.0,"Thank you for this! Also just curious, how did you find your therapist and are you paying out of pocket for their service? Im in the US and I tried seeing a therapist but it cost 200$ just for 1 appointment because my insurance doesnt cover much at all. Just wondering if anyone knows of a good cheapish service."
cats,fdpthdg,t3_emfwb6,1578639838.0,My cat used to pant and meow. Maybe try putting him in a carrier with a blanket over it so he cant see out. I found if i catch him off guard and he doesnt see where hes going hes totally chill the entire ride. Until the thermometer goes into his butt of course.
cats,fdpqv2g,t3_emk5c9,1578637054.0,Do you have more pics of your kitten? Such a cutie! I used to have a siamese growing up. They are such smart lil talkers.

I’m out in nocal so even just the expense of leaving is tough. I’ve been also contemplating if moving to a smaller town would make owning my own business easier. My main dream is to open a cafe that has a small shop inside that sells an assortment of readable printed items. Dm me if you’re up to chatting more, I’d love to pick your brain!"
