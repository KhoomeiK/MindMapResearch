The ridiculous abuse that goes on for ambulances is insane. One lady had knee pain. Ok, make an appointment to see your MD not call 911. Another call was seriously for pinky pain. I think most in my area call bc they don’t have a vehicle and the ambulance is their damn taxi. They can’t pay the bill though. Our ambulances are all volunteers as is our fire department. In my area if you are in serious need of an ambulance you will wait or die. House catches on fire...you will watch it burn to the ground. By the time firemen get there you are already at 25-30 minutes of burn time. My husband was stung and went into anaphylactic shock from sting. We waited 14 minutes for ambulance. He was barely breathing when they arrived. I couldn’t do anything bc he had collapsed. County living  means you will die(or just barely be hanging on)or watch everything burn before help gets to you. Good times. I bought a fire hose so, we can hook it up to hydrant and at least have a chance until firemen get here."
NewParents,ff7psnu,t3_es3nca,1579655401.0,"It doesn’t get better as they age either. When they are older you sit up waiting to hear the pitter patter of their big feet so that you can breathe a sigh of relief that they are home safe. I loose my mind worrying more now, that they are older. It was simpler when I could put them to bed at 8 pm in their crib and no they were safe. Parenting never is easier. 5 kids ages 22,20,16,13 and 6. The 6 year old is kicking my old ass. I love them all like crazy!"

Since they are poodles, shaving the hair around the ass is another must. Washing the paws is a  task we do too. You ever see how much mud and crap a dogs paw can harbor? Someone on here said I have a sad life bc I spend too much time worrying about my dogs having a clean ass. Living with6 floofs is never sad."

memes,fdna1ds,t3_em9zv3,1578581219.0,"Are you kidding me? I’m a landlord and we are constantly working on our rentals. You see, people don’t care about anything unless they own it. I’ve re-done houses so many times only to have tenants trash the entire place. Carpet after one year is black with filth. What the hell do people do? Garbage filling rooms. Basements full of dog shit bc the tenant was hiding puppies in the basement and never took them outside. How about all the time I spend at the courthouse filing eviction paperwork? You think being a landlord isn’t working? Maybe, you should give it a try. Put your sweat and tears into a house and then watch it be destroyed bc tenants don’t care. Spend hours in court trying to get the rent money owed to you bc of peoples like you with this shitty attitude that they are owed something for free. Just amazing. Who is paying me when renters don’t? Nobody but you know what? The bank still expects a payment from me. Wow...you’re warped."
