It’s either a sideline or his only source of income. I don’t think the bus drivers would be too pleased or allow a guy with a box of dirty scrap metal to hop on their bus. Also defeats the purpose of scrapping. That said, the truck would not pass a safety inspection, if sold and would need to be fixed before being certified road worthy.

My son, RIP, bought a truck with holes in the floorboard.  He had to have a new floor welded in, but it wasn’t expensive and it passed inspection.  But it’s hard to judge a person’s situation from a photo and a police blurb."

I think I’d rather pay my insurance and have peace of mind because none of us know when or how an accident will happen."
