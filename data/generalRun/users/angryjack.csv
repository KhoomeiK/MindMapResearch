The timing of your story is perfect for what I witnessed today. I was standing outside a restaurant this afternoon waiting for my date to arrive, and a young mother was bent over putting her toddler into a stroller. Two young guys, early twenties, walked out very quickly and one of them made an inappropriate comment about the woman's backside and gestured like he was going to grab her. She was trying to move aside and heard and seen what he was about to do.

She too, understandably, started yelling at the guy and he turned and sort-of lunged at her. I stepped in-between them and told him to move on. He leaned in and said, what you gonna do about it. I said we'll let the police decide that after I fk you up. By then her husband was walking out seeing his wife upset, and the guy just looked at us and said fu, called me a mf and they both walked away. The husband and the young woman both thanked me over and over.

My point is, I agree, there are a lot of shit-wad people out there and the level of disrespect is getting way out of control.

re: ""Women showing nipples is also frowned upon."" It's been my experience that it's frowned upon by other women.  I've heard conversations between friends... One woman asking another, are you wearing a bra because your nipple are pointing out.  I suppose there may be a few guys that would be offended by this, but I'd say, regarding the majority, it's highly unlikely.

re: Breastfeeding in public... I wholeheartedly have to agree with you and everyone I personally know would too. No one person I know has a problem with this. Although, the few times I've walked upon a woman breastfeeding and inadvertently made eye contact with... I've been the one who gets the dirty frown.

 *""That's literally talking about making fun of someone's body because they're uncomfortable about you very obviously being aroused. ""*

You've taken this out of context.  I never suggested making fun of somebody because that person was uncomfortable. I only suggested, if you're being bullied, attack the bully's own odd charactoristics.

A few years back I was at a restaurant with a buddy. He suddenly became sad and I said, what's up? He told me the girls at the table behind me were laughing at him. I turned and they were all looking at him kinda laughing. I told my buddy, watch this.  I pointed to the one in the center and told her she had a chunk of food stuck in her tooth. She freaked out and all her friends laughed at her. Harmless... End of problem.

BTW, I believe you got it all wrong about ""*his teacher*"" as well. Or quote it next time, please. Just to be more clear.

Plus the fact that you're assuming a guy, especially at this age,  has to be turned on, rather aroused, to get a boner tells me even further, you don't have a clue what you're talking about. You're clearly insensitive and selfish toward what goes on with a boy's body as he transforms into a young man.

Do you think when most every guy wakes up in the morning, with a ""*boner*"", he's thinking about... I'll use your example, ""*his teacher*""?

Look, I understand you seem to be offended by what you called a ""*dick print*"". So funny! I had never heard this before. I kid not, this is so freaking funny. But seriously, you are obviously very offended by this. I can only imagine why you are so sensitive.

I couldn't hold it any longer.

So I unloaded in one of the urinals, as far as I know, unseen. An older man came in as I was exiting and saw my crap in the urinal. He asked, what disgusting idiot took a crap there? I shrugged and ran out to the two older boys.

A while later, those boys got out and said they needed to take a piss. They both came back laughing and told me that someone took a humungous poop in the pisser. I just laughed with them and kept swimming.

I later went back to take a pee and someone was coming out of one of the crapper stalls. It looked just like a wall to me, but I thought, ooooh, that's where they are. Very embarrassing.
