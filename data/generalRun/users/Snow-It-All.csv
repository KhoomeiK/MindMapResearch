Also, your point is well taken, and I  updated my post as it was specifically about credit card skimmers. My point is that it will protect your PIN, as gas station pumps will ask you for your zip code when you choose the credit card option.

If your credit card has been hacked, most credit cards will allow you to refute the charge. If your debit card is hacked, game over, as you say.

It is a life hack as it can protect you by using the credit feature instead of the debit feature to protect yourself.

OP choose your uncle to walk you down the aisle. You have wanted this since you were a child. This is your dream wedding not your mom's. So what if your step father is hurt. How many times has he hurt you?

Clearly your uncle is an important figure in your life. Keep him in it. And by the way you did NOT cause any trouble in the family. Your stepfather and mother did.
