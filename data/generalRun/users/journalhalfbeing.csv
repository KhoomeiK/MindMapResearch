ChoosingBeggars,fdx6s6g,t3_en6it8,1578765898.0,"I hope you aren't considering doing this! The people who would be so entitled to even ask for or expect such a thing are the exact same type of people who would be ungrateful, selfish and impossible to please on the day. You don't owe these people anything, and to me, you'd be doing yourself a huge disservice to bend over backwards for people who are unlikely to appreciate your efforts"

AskReddit,fcpa4yi,t3_eic8yl,1577855810.0,"Yes. I had a cousin who died in an accident at 16 years old in 2012 and I'd love to be able to change that. 
I also wasted years on not knowing what I wanted to do with my life, didn't work as hard as I should at uni, didn't travel far while I had no financial commitments and didn't save for a house. I wish I could have done better.
I'm in an amazing relationship and it's the same one I was in in 2011, so I'm not leaving that behind, but us getting our dog who we love so much was all to chance, and I wouldn't be able to replicate it if I tried."
bridezillas,fcmuc5m,t3_ehn8mq,1577792662.0,Yes just cut your losses now. It will only cost you more money and your sanity to continue. Some people show their bratty true colours once a wedding is involved

AmItheAsshole,fcmsz8i,t3_ehw713,1577790770.0,"That's so childish. And people always say you never know love until you have a child, you created them from nothing and youre their everything. You're allowed to love your child more than anything. Your wife may need some professional help with her feelings if she has a reaction like this"
funny,fcjt5jf,t3_ehid96,1577703410.0,This made me really happy
AskReddit,fcjmr0p,t3_ehg5ac,1577694225.0,"When my sister and I were younger (I was around 8 and she about 5), we were walking in our neighbourhood when a man pulled up in a car next to us and asked us to come help us find his dog. My little sister agreed and went to go towards his car, but I stopped her and said it didnt feel right. We went home, and I didnt realise until I was older that I realised how suspect it could have been. Who needs a tiny child to help them look for their dog? It could have been innocent but I had such a bad feeling when interacting with him."

AskReddit,fc04apm,t3_efbygd,1577277894.0,"The fact that prescription medicines are constantly advertised on tv, what's the point of advertising these things to a vast majority who don't need it? If you do need it chances are a Dr will recommend and prescribe it to you.

Also coffee is so bad compared to what I'm used to. If that was all I was offered I'd think i didn't like coffee at all"
AskReddit,fbwuntn,t3_eetf7i,1577159903.0,"There used to be a house in my cousins street owned by this old-ish couple, and as kids she used to take me there to just go in their house and ask for lollies from these strangers at any time of any day. I got really weird vibes from them and the whole thing but I went anyway and risked it for the treats"
