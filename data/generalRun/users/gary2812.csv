Also, it's the actor's skill that can sell the character. Before watching the Captain America: First Avenger, I didn't think him to be a good choice for Steve Evans either (especially due to the Human Torch from FF).

Tom Cruise has the ability to bring action to life with his ability to pull off some really good stunts.
