creepy,ffotup0,t1_ffnw5y4,1580081746.0,Thank you! I said this further up in the thread. I'm wondering if some kind of divination directed her there. She's balancing the knife and looking unsure. I was watching her mouth for an incantation but didn't see anything spoken. I think this is what's going on. Might be spooky out of context but it seems to me she's just trying to help or warn someone.
creepy,ffotf8o,t1_ffmz4ev,1580081547.0,"The knife kinda looks daggerish to me, which could be an athame. Could be some sort of divination or something led her to this spot, and she's unsure of whether to inform the people or not. The way she's holding and balancing it makes me wonder. 

I'm not discounting the dimentia idea, but I just noticed another possibility."
PS4,ffmb0w9,t1_ffjhwk8,1580051653.0,"Everyone likes ape escape. I don't understand why they don't do something with the franchise. It was one of their big ones back when, and I consider the apes mascots for Playstation still."
aww,ffljcuv,t1_ffkq9kd,1580040346.0,"My all black kitty stayed really small too, but she's gotten fat in her senior years. I'd describe mine as feral. I'm the only person she allows to pet her or even get close to her.

BTW she's about 14 years old and still jumping around like a kitten."
NintendoSwitch,ffk08kq,t3_etwkr1,1580011855.0,"I love hollow knight and I love fan art for it. I am really disappointed by the lack of hollow knight merchandise so the fan art almost makes up for it.

I've never wanted a figure from a game so badly. I don't even collect pops and I'd buy a pop of every character in the game if they made them."
LimitedPrintGames,ffjzz3m,t1_ffj9543,1580011635.0,"It's still limited. Look at OP. There are a lot more of these people out there than there are keeping track of things and pre-ordering every release. The customer base VS the pool of switch owners is still tiny.

I don't know much about retail store run numbers but I'd be willing to bet only the very lowest retail print games rival the highest limited run print games.

We're in a bubble of our own community. If you asked 20 people walking into gamestop on any given day if they've heard of limited run games how many do you think would know? 4? How many have bought several releases and keep up with new stuff? I would bet not even 1.

Not arguing or getting upset here like some of these guys lol, just saying my bit."

PS4,ffenyde,t1_ffeapre,1579856599.0,"I'm sure metroid will be jaw dropping too but anything multiplat like doom or Witcher I'm never gonna play on Nintendo, even with release day parity. None of this matters anyway because it's all personal preference."
aww,ffe8xc0,t1_ffe0ipw,1579839938.0,Better go watch all 9 seasons again except the ones without Mulder!
PS4,ffe87wy,t1_ffe47a2,1579839363.0,"The reason it's in quotes is because I couldn't think of a better way to phrase it. Sitting down to play uncharted or God of war is different than going to play Mario or Kirby.

I can't even tell if you're trolling. I think weebs hate COD so you're mixing your insults here bud."

creepy,ffdkfui,t1_ffdh5se,1579822767.0,Similar experience helping a best friend of mine. I didn't go snooping but I didn't have to. Answered some questions I had casual interest in but if I could unsee it I probably would. Never mentioned it and they were so happy I fixed the computer I don't think they even considered it.
PS4,ffdjrew,t1_ffddxep,1579822354.0,"I've been gaming on Nintendo platforms since the NES. Also had every console since PS1. If you were to ask me, I'm a Playstation gamer. I love Nintendo and their exclusives but Playstation is where I do any kind of ""serious"" gaming.

It's great to have options but I'm admittedly a bit of a Playstation fan boy. If I said I didn't cheer and clap and laugh at their game sharing promo video I'd be a liar."

Anyone know when this might go into effect?"
LimitedPrintGames,ffcnq15,t3_esud00,1579803353.0,Adventure island is a favorite series of mine I may grab this. I retired my vita but I guess I could pull it out once again. I want papers please too so hopefully soon.

aww,ff9zcdu,t1_ff8velx,1579724733.0,"Kids turn into real buttheads when they hit a certain age. I had a super sweet tmnt, then pokemon themed bedroom. I hit maybe 12 or so and decided it was all too childish for me and painted the room and blah blah. Luckily my mom saved all my old curtains and bedsheets in a bin. I had some really awesome stuff I disregarded for the sake of looking more adult.

If this kid ever grows out of it, nail up some cheap paneling. Don't ever paint over this. Then when he's older and realizes that it's entirely adult to appreciate some ""childish"" things, this will be his favorite room a second time!"
aww,ff9uj49,t1_ff9ubul,1579721672.0,I got the first upvote on this according to my app. I feel so damn special now. I know it's not live updated but it counts to me.

PS4,ff5gtvv,t1_ff4p56e,1579592253.0,Fair enough. I enjoy it sometimes - I love hollow knight and dead cells but for whatever reason I felt like I was progressing way too slowly. It very well could have just been my mood at the time. There's a place for everything and I may have just been feeling impatient.
PS4,ff3ygsg,t1_ff3a265,1579551604.0,I really liked the original but I was too lazy to play it properly. There was a way to cheese it where you could turbo level up and get end game equips very very early. I did that and just ran around as an ultra powerful maniac. I guess it probably took some of the fun and suspense out but I love playing stuff super over powered like that haha.
creepy,ff3y06m,t1_ff2uss1,1579551317.0,They are bankrolling it but I seem to remember some famous names attached to it too. I'm not into anime or Manga but I love his stuff so I follow it when I can.
creepy,ff3xucp,t1_ff31mhi,1579551218.0,"Uzumaki was most definitely my favorite. It comes in 3 volumes, but I suggest the collected ones Amazon has. They're nice hardcover sets, and tend to be similarly priced to the individual volumes or even cheaper. After that just choose what you like best - some are collected short stories, others like Tomi are long and connected. I personally prefer the shorter ones but he hasn't put anything out that is disappointing imo.

Amazon has all of it. Enjoy!"
creepy,ff1zz22,t1_ff0ps28,1579490163.0,I heard that Uzumaki is getting an anime adaptation that is supposed to be made by people who will do it justice. Idk I only got into it recently.

heavyvinyl,fey51p9,t3_eqvja5,1579440879.0,"One of my favorite things I've ever done is to roll up a big one, walk down to the empty state park near my house at like 2 am in February, -10 F... YOB in headphones, lay down on a picnic table and watch a meteor shower over the big frozen lake.

Shit was wild af. When I took out the headphones I could hear owls all over the woods talking to each other too."

aww,femyloe,t1_femxtkg,1579272935.0,"That's the real issue with it. They can hang up deer crossing signs every 30 feet and your grandma can tell you to watch out for deer every day but the reality is they are hard to see, they are quick to run and if there's snow on the road you're in a lose lose situation.

You can be as careful as possible and still hit them."
aww,femrad6,t1_femoepu,1579267332.0,"I live where it's well populated with deer. You're more likely to pet one with your car than your hand.

hometheater,femqomo,t1_femha0v,1579266803.0,Oh shit I didn't even think of my phone. I'm an idiot. I was thinking of all kinds of stuff like a memory stick with an LED and if it lit up they're powered haha... Ugh I guess that's what I get for posting at 4 am. Thanks..
heavyvinyl,femei2h,t3_epwe2z,1579251325.0,Yeah they really go above and beyond with the packaging. So much fun to look at these. I've been tempted to buy a second set just to actually use the posters haha. I considered tracking down the artist to see if there were any prints or originals available.
NintendoSwitch,felu4jc,t1_fel9kvn,1579230987.0,"Viva pinata is so good. I was so bummed when I got a one and couldn't get the achievements again since the list didn't stack. I would have gotten every single one again.

I got mine in for the ps4 easily breezily but I was working part time and had the entire day to get there. Now I'm stuck here from noon est to 9 est so I'm scared!"
