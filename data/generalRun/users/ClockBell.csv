The LA County District Attorney's Office, which refused to hand over to Swiss authorities the testimony of its own former ADA and prosecutor of the case?

In the derby for example we played with a sort of ""3.5 defence"", with Spinazzola playing almost like a winger in the attacking phase and Santon staying back to make a 3-man defensive line with the two CBs. It worked quite well in completely neutering Lazio's deadly counterattacks and Santon had a good performance.

Well, the reason for this is that too many people with serious disabilities that actually need a service animal would end up being rejected and discriminated against by all kinds of businesses if they had to announce the presence of their animal in advance. It makes sense to protect the basic living needs of the disabled person, because let's be honest, many hosts would have absolutely no problem doing so. (edit: not trying to state or even imply that anyone in this thread is that kind of person.)

The real issue is with Airbnb equating service animals with the unregulated and untrained emotional support animals, which as far as I understand is more than what's required by US law. The worst part is that Airbnb applies this policy globally, even in places where emotional support animals aren't even legally recognized.

As far as communicating with a condo manager, I would just be honest with them especially since you've got a new place already lined up.

Chances are the manager is more interested in collecting evidence to punish or evict the host, so they might be even okay with letting you complete your stay in exchange for information.

The problem with asking this IMO isn't potentially offending a legal host, but rather the risk of being lied to by an illegal one.

If the tax you're seeing is listed in the fees box [like this](https://i.imgur.com/40ef2b5.png), then it's probably a good sign because it's Airbnb itself that it's charging this, meaning there's some kind of legal framework in place that allows them to operate in that particular market. Even if it doesn't completely guarantee that the listing itself is legal, it's still a good step.

On Airbnb the latter train of thought seems to be the prevalent one (essentially reviewing for location accuracy rather than location quality), however on many other websites it's often the former. I understand why hosts don't like being rated over over something the can't really control. That being said, as a guest one of the reasons why I often end up using booking.com rather than Airbnb is that I can enable the 8/10 location filter and be confident any place I book will be in a good place without wasting too much time analyzing every listing.

AirBnB,fffvzbk,t1_ffe6lvx,1579893002.0,You literally had to clean up dog piss and you still didn't leave a review? Damn you're kind.
AirBnB,fffp6vz,t1_ffernh6,1579888788.0,True. Goes without saying that all current metrics would need to be adjusted accordingly. Having a 4.2 is probably bottom 10-20th percentile? It just shows how ridiculous ratings are now.
AirBnB,ffecst3,t1_ffddl5x,1579843363.0,"The only way I can see to do this is to actually get all guests to review their stays more critically. Make it actually possible to distinguish between mediocre and great hosts. If everything is a 5 star place with only 5 star ratings, then of course the outlier 3-4 star review will be a massive deviation.

That being said, would hosts themselves be okay with receiving more critical reviews, even if it would allow good hosts to stand out more? I doubt it."
AirBnB,ffctwg2,t1_ffbcljt,1579807172.0,The fact that he's a super host with a 4.9 rating is the worst part in my opinion. It just goes to show how systematically useless and broken those things are on Airbnb.
AirBnB,ffagk2x,t1_ffa4eix,1579735241.0,"I mean, guests can also turn off and unplug cameras too for that matter. It doesn't change the fact that neither of those things are allowed inside bedrooms or bathrooms.

Do whatever you want, but I'm not sure why you'd want to risk it when I believe hosts have gotten in trouble over this kind of thing in the past."
AirBnB,ff8mflp,t3_erz3hb,1579685788.0,"I understand indoor cameras for private or shared room stays, but I'll definitely never want to book an entire property with cameras inside. Frankly I don't even think they should be allowed on Airbnb. If I book an entire place I should have the expectation of privacy throughout it. I shouldn't have to worry about walking around naked because some creep host might be monitoring me 24/7."
AirBnB,ff8lw2h,t1_ff8608h,1579684945.0,"They're still recording devices, which are absolutely not allowed in bedrooms even if you disclose them. Super sketchy tbh."
AirBnB,ff42qod,t3_eqtiyq,1579554266.0,"Best way to find places that explicitly advertise themselves as LGBT friendly might be to just use a search engine. For example:

    ""tokyo"" ""lgbt"" site:airbnb.com/rooms

returns [117 results on Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22tokyo%22+%22lgbt%22+site:airbnb.com/rooms), although there might be several duplicates. Hopefully you can find something good there.

You can also replace ""rooms"" with ""experiences"" in the url to have a look at Airbnb experiences. Or you can just head to Ni-chome on your own since I imagine that's what the vast majority of those tours will entail anyway."
soccer,ferc13v,t1_fer2n3x,1579352235.0,He kinda lucked out with Zaniolo though. The main goal of the Nainggolan deal was actually Pastore. We basically flipped the 25m we got from Inter over to PSG on the same day.

AirBnB,fej9d8m,t3_epb3v5,1579162607.0,"I'm from Rome. Without spending much time going through the listing, the catch is that the location itself isn't that great. Piazza Vittorio is a funny place. It's surrounded by these historic buildings, yet it can be quite dirty and smelly. There are also a good amount of homeless people, but it's far from being actually dangerous. The only real danger as tourist in Rome you have to worry about are pickpockets and bag snatchers, especially on public transit.

That being said, logistically I think it's a great location for a tourist. It's very central and within walking distance to S. Maria Maggiore, the Colosseum, San Giovanni etc. and everything in between. Right next to the metro too to reach areas further away."
soccer,fdy0pzt,t3_enc5n4,1578774839.0,I don't want to hear Inter fans complain about anything again this season. Ridiculous for VAR to ignore that rugby tackle. Should've been sent off too.
