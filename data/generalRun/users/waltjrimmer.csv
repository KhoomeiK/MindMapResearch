2. he's trying to distract from the impeachment trial because someone has told him that his survival of the impeachment process could very well depend in part on popularity (we want our senators to be impartial, but truthfully, if they think voting one way or another will keep them in office, they very well might swing their vote).

I agree in the spirit of why people think this, but don't agree entirely. However, the US's entirely profit based education system with no useful public alternative is a disastrous standard that has left large parts of our nation crippled behind an education creep, a class divide, and mounting debt. It needs to be overhauled carefully and with great expertise, but it needs to be overhauled none the less. In my opinion. Which probably isn't worth a damn.

There are, of course, alternatives for some people. Trade schools and jobs, certain types of apprenticeships still exist, things you don't need extra education for, and free (but usually non-degree path) online classes.

So, first, easy keyword search tells me US debt surpassed $1trillion in 1981, almost four decades ago.

Trillions will have been used for a while, although uncommonly, not only talking about money, but 10^12 and other large scientific notation numbers would have been used for, wait for it, science! Simply for example, the unit mole, 6.02214076×10^23 , came about in the 19^th century, so that's more than ten decades ago and not referring to government budgets.

Alright, you may be thinking, ""I said outside of certain fields, you pedantic prick,"" and that's fair. The long form didn't even have a name for every number. (It was only recently that an organized system was developed and most find it more cumbersome than using scientific notation, so its main use is in things like incremental games.) But it had a name for every number that was important to use. And trillion was one of those.

That indicates that, even if it's not incredibly common, at the time that long form names for numbers were developed, there was some incentive to name that number. Later other large numbers would be named, like the googol, which fit oddly into either scale. I remember years ago, before these games were becoming popular, looking up the names of large numbers and there were big gaps in the list because names weren't commonly used, only the most important ones had names and the rest were referred to by scientific notation. But! Trillion is very old.

As for your argument that short is simpler and more distinct, that's arguably not true. You're coming from a lifetime of using short form, so it's more familiar to you and using long form would be a jump in thinking, you'd have to actively make sure you're using the right scale instead of taking it for granted, and occasionally you'd need to convert things until you got used to the new scale. But if you had grown up with long form, you'd be saying the same thing about short form. And unless you're shortening the words, they're not really less distinct. And even shortening them, you can do something like million=m, milliard=^(d)m.

I say all this as a short form user. I grew up that way, most of the people around me use short form, I use short form. But I do that because it's just more common, not because it's better. Long form makes more sense, especially when you actually look at the words. This isn't a hill I'm willing to die on or anything, it's not even something I'm really big on like the fact more English speaking countries should switch to SI units instead of mixing-and-matching like the US, UK, and Canada do (I don't know about other English speaking countries)."

dndmemes,fdcml3f,t1_fdc1lji,1578278650.0,"I often play paladins of various kinds. I usually don't think, ""It's my way or the highway."" In fact, due to an experience long ago where I kind of became ""The main character"" in a D&D game nowadays I'm so deferential sometimes no one realizes I said I wanted to do something and unless I think it's important I won't correct them and just go with what everyone else is doing.

But the paladin, my character, will sometimes be that way depending on the background I give them and all that. Part of what I enjoy about paladins is that they're often idealists who see things in three shades: Evil which must be destroyed, Good which must be revered, and Neutral which, depending on the paladin, must be fought over to bring to Good and prevent falling into Evil, is just a more passive version of Evil, is only weakness, is the innocence of the world at large, or is just how things usually are if not tainted by Evil or blessed by Good.

When actually living out life, they'll be faced with more and more situations that fracture that vision of the world, sometimes it gets entirely shattered. How they experience it, how I have them react, it helps to build them as a full character. Sometimes I don't fill out the backstory all the way until I play them. The one that became ""the main character"" that one time was like that, I created their backstory about 3/4th of the way through the game after I realized he was hiding behind his beliefs and refusing to acknowledge when they were challenged because he was basically trying to make up for something he never could by doing what he thought was unquestionable good."
AskReddit,fdclfk8,t1_fdc03hj,1578277822.0,"My prediction for years has been the show will end with his complete and total retirement from Hollywoo. His problems have almost all stemmed from the fact that he can't stop chasing his dream of being something more. But his vision of something more is so misguided that instead of being motivating, it's debilitating. To have any chance at stability and survival, he has to quit all of it. Not in a moment of panic or stress, he has to actually make that decision, stick to it. Not abandon all his friends, but explain what he's doing and why and leave. Sell the house, quit the business, move out and do something different.

And maybe the mid-season finale was hinting at that. But it was also showing he didn't have his life in order, he didn't take the proper steps, and his past will still haunt him. He'll never escape the choices he made before, and I'm hoping that the show ends showing that the point isn't to escape them but to learn from them and try to do better as you go forward.

I'm also wondering if they're going to really end the show. They had one of the earliest Netflix publishing contracts and it's one of the only shows that could ever be syndicated from Netflix to cable television. I don't know how many rights they still hold to the show itself. They said Netflix cancelled them, this wasn't where they were intending to end it. I don't think it's a bad place to end it, but I've wondered if they'll seek to make a film, basically one big final episode, to tie everything together and finish the story more to how they wanted it ended."

todayilearned,fcjef05,t1_fcj8scv,1577684670.0,"The real answer is we don't know.

Since we're only able to talk to people who live, no one knows what it's like to really die. We know that almost dying is very painful for almost everyone. And we know that it's often frightening. Most who try to die are hit with the instinct to live when it's too late, causing what they believe to be their final moments to be agonizing.

Even decapitation may not be instant death. We aren't certain what goes on in the brain. It may shut down consciousness in an attempt to protect itself from the shock. Or it may go into hyper-drive those final few seconds before it just stops working. There are leading theories, but those theories are not the strongest because our data is lacking. It's not really ethical to hook up someone to an EEG and then chop their head off to read the scans.

The most likely way to die as instantly as possible is to have your brain stem destroyed. Some attempt this with gunshot wounds, but they're notoriously prone to failure. Some have even survived point-blank gunshot wounds to the head. And doing that leaves a horrific image and a lot of work for those who must find you, report the death, clean it up, and so forth. It's a terrible way to go and not at all peaceful. And on top of that, as stated, unreliable.

It's funny to say, but any way you choose to die comes with the risk that you'll survive. The risk may be small. But it's always there. And most ways that are likely to be quick and painless are not at all peaceful or reliable.

I've put a lot of thought and some research into this because I've never felt right being alive. I've never gone a day without knowing it would have been better without me in it. But the way things are, there is no peaceful way to die. Not really. Even if you found a peaceful method, suicide is so taboo that you can't really say goodbye to everyone. You're violently ripping yourself out of others' lives because this isn't a thing that you're allowed to openly plan and explain. Unnatural death, and often times natural death, is just plain violent and messy."

It turned my stool dried-blood black. Just straight up, this is the kind of shit you'd imagine goths would poop out, it was so dark. I saw it and went, ""Well. Guess I'm dying. Nothing to do about it, though."" Because I didn't have insurance and live in the US. It was only when it started going away and coming back that I finally pieced together the pattern and figured out what specific food was causing that coloration. No, I don't remember what it was. Yeah, I might buy it again and go through this all over.

It may simply come down to taking some away is easier than adding more on. If you go through four (or eight or whatever) stages of aging, maybe designing each one individually creates too much error. Going straight to the oldest one and then taking some off leaves most of the makeup the same while de-aging from the previous shot.
