You should have at least had her contact her boyfriend to come at least be with her. Girl- girl buddy code in the city at all times, regardless of you not being in the mood. Her safety is at risk, and that would be on you for leaving her."

exmormon,ff5kjpy,t1_ff5k5mj,1579597304.0,"I definitely think about that too, and it’s heartbreaking to think about the possibility that we are completely meaningless. Hopefully those thoughts can fuel your passion to “live life to its fullest” (as much as I fucking hate cliches) while you are here. The possibilities are endless. Maybe after this life people like us are rewarded for becoming our own good and gracious people rather than sheep following organized religion... kinda twisted, I’ve never thought about that until right now."
exmormon,ff5k1o9,t3_errvum,1579596577.0,"I found faith in my own morals. Just like you said, the church shaped you into a good man. I no longer stress about praying to God or a god. I feel peace in knowing that a higher power must be satisfied that I have good morals, empathy, and compassion. I think the WoW is bullshit, and I know that every single human being on earth sins one way or another. Of this world, my tattoos, my espresso machine, and my weed are not what’s stopping me from eternal salvation or whatever awaits me after this life. And if it is, at least I am satisfied with my character on this earth."

AmItheAsshole,fepoml8,t1_fepmrrh,1579326222.0,I’d like to note that OP is male
AmItheAsshole,fenbso8,t1_fenbe9y,1579281314.0,Amen!! Your feelings are valid. Actually I’ll also correct myself in my first comment: I called the local police on him first and he got a small $45 ticket for parking in the fire lane and he continued after that. Then I called the tow truck and he had to pay about $400 to get his car back and NOW he doesn’t park there anymore. You have to learn a lesson somehow.... 3 years later he still doesn’t know it was me lmao
AmItheAsshole,fenb87b,t3_eq31gs,1579280964.0,NTA those people know they are breaking the rules of the complex. I hate that they pick and choose who gets towed like that. I once called the tow truck on my own bro-in-law because he regularly parked in the fire lane outside his apartment (shared with my partner) and it drove me insane because there were plenty of parking spots available he was just lazy and wanted the closest place. This of course set me off because of safety reasons but overall for thinking he’s exempt from laws/rules.
AmItheAsshole,fenarwk,t3_eq31kx,1579280680.0,"NAH she wouldn’t know if it weren’t for you telling her. It’s awkward and hard, but it needs to be said to continue having a healthy sex life. You should be able to enjoy giving oral (if that pleases you). And honesty and communication are crucial in a healthy relationship as well."

Is there a specific age specified in the Life Handbook that we are supposed to forget all of our insecurities, new and old, and be nothing but happy?

You ever do that thing where you lie to yourself and say you will get gas in the morning/tomorrow before whatever obligation you have? 
Well I typically start work at 4 am. This particular day I was starting at 5 am and of course, I had still forgotten to give myself time in the morning to fill up my tank. So I’m already rushed, it’s black outside and my eyes are still swollen from sleeping, just generally not in a great morning mood. 

At 4:30 am at the gas station, I noticed I was alone, besides a homeless man standing a couple hundred feet away from me across this parking lot. I hear him holler at me “spare change?” and as much as I wanted to ignore his plea this early, I reminded myself that he is human too and you shouldn’t ignore the less fortunate. I told him “no, I’m sorry”. He then approached me and ask for a cigarette, to which I replied “sorry I do not smoke”. He asked again for cash, no I’m sorry. 

Then he whipped it out and gave me a little helicopter twirl with his flaccid old man dick. I wasn’t in the mood to think of anything witty so I just said “fuck you man” and got in my car and left. He left it out of his pants until after I drove away. Casually called the police station. 

Lucky for him, that wasn’t the first penis I’ve seen. I came out more annoyed than any other emotion, it was too early to deal with that shit. 

I hope you don’t have any lasting trauma (or any at all) from your experience. I feel so bad that you had to endure that at a young age! Sick fuck he is. Unsolicited penis in any form is no fun"

AmItheAsshole,fe5bxnm,t3_enudt2,1578867469.0,"NTA. What she said is straight up racist and not okay. You could have said “fucker” or “bitch” and your friends would still be mad at you. I’ve only heard someone talk about “Asians eating dogs” one time in my life and it was a homeless man saying it to a group of Asian tourists and I got fired up, wanted to kick his ass and apologize to the tourists. I’m sorry that she got laughs out of it, but she sucks."
depression,fdp5ljy,t1_fdp5dwm,1578620534.0,"Also I’m sorry that you are going through this. My depression affect mine and my boyfriends relationship so much and I know exactly where she is coming from. I feel guilty for staying with my boyfriend sometimes (a lot of time) because like she said, he doesn’t deserve it. It’s not what he signed up for but I’m not strong enough to end things, so know that it was very hard for her as well. I wish you guys luck."
depression,fdp5dwm,t3_emikra,1578620391.0,"She needs a friend in this time. Continue to be her friend with no pressure but make sure she knows that you care, her feelings and emotions (or lack there of) are valid, and that you will always be there to listen when she needs to let something out."

depression,fde0sen,t3_ekwbox,1578328595.0,"You’re not alone here. I am currently in the process of finally making steps to pulling myself out of the lowest low period that I have experienced so far and I found myself not wanting to “get better” for about 5 months. I had  accepted that I was alive but was not living and had no will to live but no courage to end it. I even quit my job thinking that would give me some relief and take some pain away it didn’t do anything but make me useless and drain my savings (bringing me even more down) for those months. I’ve struggled with depression my whole life but this was my worst funk yet. I don’t know what it was to make me finally want to feel again, but I’m working on it.

Might I recommend if you haven’t spoken to someone about this yet, a family member or an adult in your life that you can trust, someone can help you get in contact with a therapist.

However, I once had a good friend completely ghost me. I still give him the benefit of the doubt and say he is doing the same thing as you. Honestly it hurts and I would have much rather he come to me and let me know the reason for our disappearing friendship vs just cutting me out so I didn’t have to go crazy over it. So if you do it that way, YTA"
