hondagrom,ff5v26w,t3_errm1c,1579611245.0,What’s the point of lowering and stretching it? Make t less rideable?
bikesgonewild,ff4kqp8,t1_ff4kmem,1579565980.0,Lmao okay that’s what I was thinking. Can you actually paint those without affecting the heat transfer?

Conservative,ff2ys7d,t1_ff1942u,1579528923.0,No no no. Democratic guy here who supports the bill and abortion but doesn’t like abortion. It’s rarely a simple thing like that.

ConvenientCop,fe8jwh0,t1_fe872s2,1578926968.0,"Oh yeah no doubt, I have an aftermarket can but it’s still not too loud so I don’t feel too bad about it. If my bike was straight piped or louder I definitely wouldn’t though."
