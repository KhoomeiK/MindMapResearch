Honestly, it's fucking annoying. Masturbating often leaves me with a tired/depressed feeling, while letting the frustration grow gives me wicked head and neck pains.

I'm not. If I find someone in my home who isn't supposed to be there and doesn't respond to my commands, he's getting shot because I will assume he's not alone and I might be attacked by others.
