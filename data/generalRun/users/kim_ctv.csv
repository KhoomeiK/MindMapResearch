Chudleigh trained him to take her for walks around their property twice a day. I was a junior in college when they got her. She was a little void with teeth, but a very adorable void with teeth.

She got *big*, a svelt 100 ish lbs and very well mannered. Except when my youngest cousin was a kid and Chudleigh got over excited by her and her brothers running around, so Chudleigh tackled her and gave her kisses. Apparently all you could see was flailing limbs and a blur of a tail. She was also very confused when my grandma rescued some baby ducks (through a bird rescue) and those ducks resided in the pack and play that she stayed in, instead of a kennel. You could practically grass her think, ""But that's MY bed. Why are those weird things doing on there? Mom??"".

She was always very sociable when people were over. When I came to visit (I live in the Midwest and my extended family are all out east), she would be very happy to see me. The family would all come over for a day and she'd make sure she greeted everyone. If you yelled at her for being too social, Grandma wouldn't like that and would yell at you.

I couldn't make it out last summer because of financial reasons. She was put down yesterday because she either had a tumor on her bladder or something like that. It was my grandparents' plan that if anything happened to them, I'd take care of Chudleigh as I'd continue her spoiled lifestyle and make sure she was well taken care of because she had bad allergies.

Give your pups an extra hug for me tonight."

ferrets,ffv6bps,t1_ffv4tvk,1580256721.0,"Look into Feliway. It's this pheromone product that helps cats relax. It mimics the pheromone that cat moms release when the kittens are nursing. They come in sprays, collars, and plug-ins.

Guess who always needs to go outside when you ask him? I've tried not giving him a treat after, but he gives me a sad seal look that Labs have perfected."
