selfimprovement,ff57sng,t3_erfaax,1579582742.0,"I’ve been in your shoes for a few years, let me put it this way. What’s cool now ie wearing the coolest, driving the coolest etc isn’t what’s going to be cool when you’re 25+. Having a respectable job is what’s cool at 25+

I went from spoiled kid to looser in the span of 3 years and now I’m build in my career back to where I’m doing something I like that makes great money. Don’t wait until it’s too late. This is a classic example of cool kids in high school being dead beat losers 4 years later. Same kind of concept applies here"

UnpopularFacts,fcvss7y,t1_fcvdmsc,1578009286.0,"I work in the same industry, finance requires insane hours on a long timeline if you want to reach the very top too and hit VP/MD level later so yes very little time socializing

I would recommend learning game and how to approach women as if you’re working in banking it’s likely you’re in a larger city as well where that kind of thing is more common"
UnpopularFacts,fcvavey,t1_fcvassv,1577998257.0,"Top 10-20 if you want to marry a doctor, lawyer, banker etc that is also attractive and has options. You get the idea"
UnpopularFacts,fcv9tmh,t3_ej3gb4,1577997637.0,"The truth behind this lies in luck of the draw.  If you’re born as a woman in the top 10-20% of attractiveness you’re more than likely good to go

If you’re not an attractive woman there’s little to nothing you can do to improve your dating situation. Where as if you’re a man you can do much more to improve your situation, status, personality, occupation, health, physique etc"
dailygratitude,fcbzkze,t3_egrbts,1577592734.0,"I’ve been waking up early for this as well, one of the best parts of the day to set the pace"
productivity,fcbxq9h,t3_egurms,1577592144.0,"It’s been a year of many changes so here we go:

The Bible

Waking up at 530 - your brain works better earlier on- get 7-8 hours of sleep and go to bed earlier

Exercising 5-6 days a week, running mostly, weight 3 times a week

Meditation- mid day reset of stress levels

Good diet- lean protein and vegetables, fruit

Environment- moved to the city I’ve always wanted to live in, big difference in happiness and opportunity

Travel - save money through the year and spend it on experiences

Education- studying post grad and working on a business to increase knowledge and income. Financial literacy on saving and investing

Books on business, working hard and inspiration as follows

Can’t hurt me - David Goggins

Mindset - Carol dweck 

The compound effect - Dan Hardy

No excuses - Brian Tracy

Stillness is the key - Ryan holiday"
Bible,fcamtsr,t3_egsnwd,1577572374.0,"Excellent plan, I’m doing the same starting with the New Testament first then old

There are approximately 1200 pages in the ESV Reformation study bible so 5- 10 pages a day should have it cleared by September

I’m already halfway through Mathew now so the earlier you start to build the habit the better"

fatFIRE,fc2ycyy,t1_fc2y6te,1577377281.0,"I work in AM and am writing my CFA, will go on to do an MBA after. I wouldn’t be doing this if I didn’t like it because what kind of life is that? 

I agree IB can yield a lot of burnout as it’s monotonous and generally just trading hours logged for money. Mind you there’s someone out there who’s having a blast doing it and climbing the ladder"
fatFIRE,fc2y1se,t1_fc2x0z2,1577377058.0,"I work in banking too and am my 20’s. Mind you not on the MD level as that’s very high up. I work fairly long hours (not IB long) and study for a post grad finance designation when I get home

The people who reach the top and stay there generally enjoy what they’re doing, I enjoy what I’m doing, I didn’t always though, I learned to enjoy the process of learning and working on my craft, trick of the mind but it works for me

Of course exercise and good nutrition are staples that keep me in check as well whenever a stressful period comes around"
fatFIRE,fc2wx4i,t1_fc20kiy,1577376211.0,My condolences. Truth is you need to be doing what you like. That way you can still work a lot and there isn’t a ton of stress hormone pumping through your system
fatFIRE,fc2wnyf,t3_efogdh,1577376020.0,"I work in banking too, congrats on making MD, that is a great accomplishment. In all honesty time and nourishment is really what heal burnout. I would recommend seeing a doctor for a checkup as well. 

With an MD salary I would say you have reached your fatFIRE goals so that is a plus"
Splintercell,fc1kqb9,t3_efgupf,1577321685.0,I’d be fine with another game at this point. A movie would flop the market isn’t big enough and there’s not a mainstream global audience for it. As much as I love the game not everyone resonates with it
CFA,fbyp71l,t3_eedcrv,1577222690.0,"Yep, I find my mind the absolute sharpest within the first few hours of waking. Wake up at 5/5:30 read/study for 2 hours then hit the gym, home, shower. breakfast, then off to work"
productivity,fbxmiuo,t3_eepsi4,1577193946.0,I am rekindling old habits in this last week because the trap of waiting till Jan 1st is exactly why many never keep their resolutions. Jan 1st is just another day
