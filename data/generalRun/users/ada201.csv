If you really want to quit and make your life better you'll do it. If you can't then you just gotta try harder. There's literally nothing forcing you to play games other than yourself, and yeah the worst part is not knowing what to do instead, but you gotta work through it.

But as someone who saw a counsellor for the whole of year 12, skipped school because of stress/depression, got terrible marks, had to drop a subject, and literally came home and cried to his parents some days I can safely say that it can get better. I realise now I was pretty much creating problems in my head that didn't exist (which is pretty much what depression/anxiety is) and spent the whole of year 12 wanting to die. I can't offer much advice on how to fix your situation because it's probably different to mine (if you want more detail I can share tho), but there is hope for everyone.

This delusion that gaming was my sole purpose in life dragged for many years until I literally had the revelation that I was NOTHING. I was just a consumer, literally only existed to eat, fap, and play games. 

Of course when I played games it seemed like the best thing in the world. And it seems like that because it's so safe. When your living in the virtual world nothing can hurt you. There's no danger. But I can assure you - the delusion does not last forever, and that is the problem. You could argue a heroin addict is justified in his drug abuse because he is enjoying life and no one should tell him otherwise, but the delusion only ends in death or withdrawals.

For me personally, as someone in the exact same situation as you, I decided to quit because I realised there's so much more I can do with my time rather than game. Ultimately gaming is just passing the time. And if you enjoy it that's great but for me it's not fun anymore because I know I'm just timewasting.

I'm on day 4 now of no games, which is the longest I've spent in ages. I've got back into playing the piano, writing music, climbing, and going to the gym, I also taught myself how to do cryptic crosswords. Why have I done these? Because quitting  gaming is fucking boring and I'll find anything to do to stop being bored, which leads to taking up new hobbies. Now I have things that develop me as a person, that I can share with other people, and really I can just finally grow up instead of being a nerd stuck in his room all day (no offense to anyone).

So to wrap up, if you're content with gaming then that's fine. You'll know when it's time to stop.

First of all I'm not gonna say put the phone away, I know how hard it is. But introduce some goals into your day. For example, yesterday my goals were to learn the first sheet of a new piano song (haven't played in months, was fun to get back into it, I'm quite advanced though so it's enjoyable), read the end of my book (Brave New World, had 1 chapter left), and go to the gym, and lastly to watch a movie - Fight Club (I never watch movies because gaming is a lot more fun for me). Overall this was like 5 hours out of my day, I'm on break so it's doable but scale it if your working or something.

I'm not one to preach about productivity but I have to say actually achieving goals feels great. The last thing you should do is sit around on your phone and wait for something to change."
