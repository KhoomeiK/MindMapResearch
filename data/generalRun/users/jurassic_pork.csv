Games,ff5hu5l,t1_ff4zklr,1579593541.0,"Easiest way to get this achievement:  

- Have a teleporter.
- Find an enemy ship without a medbay (or disable the medbay), and with 4 crew members.  
- Use your boarding party to almost but not actually kill each crew member.  
- Send over the boarding drone (it only has to make the final hit to get the kill, it doesn't have to do any other damage)."
Games,ff5h064,t1_ff56zzh,1579592465.0,"Teleporter still works vs the final boss, but with some caveats:  
- On harder difficulty the ion and beam are still separate rooms and can easily be boarded, but missiles and lasers are now attached to the ship.  
- You need a way to trap crew in a room (crystal crew, lockdown bomb, stun, hacking, mind control, or disabling the med bay)  
- Using Lanius borders and then destroying the oxygen system and draining all of the oxygen in that room is highly effective, and the AI basically bugs out, especially in phase 1 where you can punch through doors and drain the next room over without having to leave the oxygenless room. Tip: keep one crew member alive, or the ship will turn into an AI ship, will turn on a Zoltan shield, and will auto repair systems.  
- Starting a fire in a key room with the fire beam or fire bombs, and then using Rockmen to fight in that room, while not taking fire damage while the crew is, and you are preventing the crew from repairing, while flame from spreading is highly effective (especially vs a down medbay, or the missile room).  
- Do your boarding before phase 3, or be sure that you have a Zoltan shield bypass."

Prioritize manning first piloting, then engines, then weapons, then shields. That dodge chance bonus vs missiles especially (but also flak/lasers) means spending less scrap on repairs, and taking out enemy weapons quicker for the same reasons, while shield recharge is less valuable than dodge (still some value against combat drones or asteroids, but less than dodge). For this same reason, it's usually always worth pumping scrap into an extra point into engines first thing, so you can temporarily drain oxygen when a volley comes in, to increase your dodge.

SPOILERS: Clone bay neutralizes the risk (if you fail, you don't get rewards but you also don't lose a crew), while in order the following items offer  low/medium/high reward blue options: boarding drone, antipersonnel drone, bio-beam. Slug-A 'Man of War' starts with a bio-beam and *loves* running into giant alien spiders, but if you ever find yourself with a bio-beam on the Kestrel you can also rake in the scrap vs giant alien spiders or taking out enemy crews without destroying their ships.  
The bio-beam (along with fire bomb, or teleporter) also unlocks a blue option for a quest marker in the 'unencrypted communications' event that ends with a ton of scrap and a free weapon if you can take out the crew at the quest location without destroying their ship (and you will take a massive 15 hull damage if you attempt this and accidentally blow up the ship)."

sysadmin,ff41nlf,t1_ff3i2gc,1579553593.0,"As much as I like the platform, there are a few big key issues with Palo Alto, compared to other vendors:  
- Missing a native application and server aware Layer7 Load Balancer component (like FortiNet, so you have to go third-party).  
- Missing a native Mail Transfer Agent (like Check Point, so you have to go third-party).  
- With PAN-OS 9.1 they have introduced some SDWAN (hub-spoke, currently missing full-mesh, requires Panorama and an SDWAN license), but they are not a full-fledged edge/transit router if your environment is overly complex, or if you want to turn on say anything more than rudimentary IP SLA type features (so you have to go third-party).  
- Implement a decent patch process, MFA, IP restrictions, and separate admin VLANs, because there are constant exploits being found on the management UI (similar to various other vendors, and just good practice).  
- Panorama jumps from 25 devices to 100 devices to 1000 devices, with a crazy licensing cost attached, and they are now actually verifying this unlike in the past. If you have 101 devices you need to manage, that's a steep increase.  
- The way they rate their throughput and utilization is somewhat misleading.. 'You'll get x throughput, until you turn on y features, then it cuts in half' vs 'This product is guaranteed to have a minimum throughput of x'.

All that being said, I have helped several billion dollar companies replace PIX, ASA, PFSense, SonicWall, Check Point, FortiNet, and even Meraki with Palo Alto."

With a few exceptions: pre-sales, and escalation.  

- Until the ink dries, and the sale has been made, if there is a contract on the line, then 'free' billable hours (within reason) are just the cost of doing business, especially if the client doesn't yet have a support contract.  
Most reputable companies will send out both a sales drone (Sales Rep, Sales/Pre-Sales Engineer) to make the sales pitch or to go over the licensing terms / tiers / pricing, and a technical engineer (Systems Engineer / Technical Account Manager / etc) to speak geek and go over the detailed minutia of configuration. This is not always the case, but it is quite often. Grab both of their business cards, and hit up the appropriate resource directly (and CC the other).

You get less rewards on average for accepting a surrender, and you don't get the chance at a second reward from the second ship if it's a pirate attacking another ship, *but* you do see what the offer is before rejecting or accepting it - as long as the ship can't charge their engines. So, while you are expected on average to get less value in the offered reward, it can still include really nice weapons, augments, or drones.

You get the same reward for killing the crew if the enemy ship has 1 hull hp, or full hp, so you always want to at least see the offer as long as you aren't risking them jumping away. There's a risk / reward -  you get nothing if they jump away (and sometimes the enemy jump time doubles), and most ships will start charging when they get down to 1/3 HP, so you will want to take out the engines or piloting before attempting this gambit. If you really need fuel or a new weapon, it might make sense to take the sure thing offer v. gambling on a more valuable reward that might not include fuel, and almost certainly won't have a weapon."
GameDeals,fc38mli,t1_fc36hrq,1577384102.0,"Yeah, the Mantis B is also great once you get your first weapon or Zoltan shield bypass + clonebay, but automated ships or Lanius are a hard counter at the start.  

I really like the Lanius A or B for boarding: don't go for the medbay, go for the oxygen room, and if they have L2+ doors, you can smash doors open while staying in a safe oxygen depleted room, otherwise you can just walk back and forth between a room with oxygen and a room without, abusing the enemy AI.  

My least favorite ships are the rock ships, but a fire weapon and some rock borders is quite powerful.

For new players:  
Blue options (usually but not always), or killing the crew without blowing up the enemy ship, can offer a lot better rewards. Two Zoltans in a shield room will negate ion damage, and four Zoltan in a shield room is incredibly powerful even during the end boss (ions can't take shields below level 2). Higher level teleporters can let you get two new free crew members off of slave ships with a blue event, or killing all of the crew can give you the option to pick between engi/rock/mantis. Even with boarding parties, it is worth damaging a ship enough after taking out the engines / piloting to receive a surrender offer - the offer might be a weapons pre-ignitor / burst laser mark II / repair drone. With a drone recovery arm, if you jump before a repair drone has disappeared, you repair for free. Defense Drone MK I is far superior to Defense Drone MK II, as it doesn't waste time trying to shoot down lasers and ignoring missiles - it only targets missiles / Flak / Asteroids; it's worth selling a MK2 to pickup a MK1 defense drone. Many ships have useless augments that you can sell for some quick starting cash.

Minor Spoilers:  
Going to the Zoltan Homeworld sector is the only way to get a Zoltan shield on a non Zoltan ship in the base game (not available in any stores), but if you do then you can temporarily negate many boarding parties / drones / missiles."
