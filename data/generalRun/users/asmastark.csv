But the Chinese take it one step further. They literally TORTURE cats and dogs by skinning them alive and boiling them alive. Beating and cuting them before the final kill all because they think it makes the meat taste better.

Soo many people have been trying to save the poor dogs and cats that are  ""bred for eating as you say"" 
This is the difference and I would please ask you to stop spouting this rightous BS that they are allowed to eat whatever beecause we eat meat as well. in the end they don't just eat them they fucking do some medieval disgusting uncivilised things."
