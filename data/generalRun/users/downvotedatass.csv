So lines barely holding the components if the flower in place run and tied to the screen are actually being cut with the knife. Maybe...
politics,fbza2zq,t1_fbyda35,1577239860.0,"I like reading these and trying to translate them with counters as if I were talking to someone that isn't old and affected by Alzheimer's but also started with a mentally handicapped baseline. So here it goes: I never understood the craze over wind turbine energy, I've done extensive research into it and the cost of production isn't feasible. (this isnt true) The production of the components is almost entirely made in China and Germany which doesn't help the US economy (this isn't true) The manufacturing of these components requires burning fossil fuels and creates it's own carbon footprint and there is a planet we live on (this is true mainly because we are still dependent on fossil fuels for energy and earth exists). Atmospheric pollution is bad no matter where it comes from  (this is true). Wind turbines kill many bald eagles (this is false)(there is also no bald eagle death count for discontinuing a wind turbine).It is right for them to shut down turbines for that reason (they do not) If you want to see a bunch of dead birds go to a wind turbine site (unlikely to find that there at all and definitely not a lifetime of dead birds).
