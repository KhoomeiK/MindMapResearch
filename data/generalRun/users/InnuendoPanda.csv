So it could make sense that ""-1"" is like a second edition/run."
pokemon,ffc85d8,t1_ffc80ww,1579793734.0,I feel like this is something I read with versions all the way back to Red/Blue where they fixed some spelling errors or something and you could tell which version you had by the code.
pokemon,ffc7f6s,t3_estrrs,1579793269.0,"I could be entirely wrong about this - but it could be the version of the game on that cartridge? Years ago I remember reading something about ""if your game has this stamp it is the original release, if it has this stamp it's a 2nd run/updated version"" (kinda like how books are printed in editions).  


Could it be that?"
AskReddit,ff9ns0k,t1_ff8oi2s,1579716858.0,I sometimes listen to a radio show in the morning on my way to work. When they go to commercial or songs I flip to my Spotify. For the past 3-ish months that radio station has been playing one of 2 same songs every single day at the same time. I don't know how they get active listeners at this point. It gets to the point that you full out hate the songs because they over play them so much.
gaybros,ff6y8yr,t1_ff6xi4x,1579637351.0,"I would seriously consider finding a therapist that is gay/gay-friendly.
I have to go into the city to see mine, but I just couldn't find one in my suburb that I felt comfortable go to with gay relationship issues. I was recommended to mine through a chain of friends and he's really helped me. I've felt completely comfortable talking to him over an older straight woman."
gaybros,ff6xc2w,t3_erwy7e,1579636816.0,"My previous relationship was 6 years and ended around 2 years ago leaving me single in my early 30s. I will be honest - I had to go to therapy to work a lot of stuff out. But then again, I was also in an EXTREMELY manipulative and controlling relationship. I found it really, really hard to believe that anyone was actually into me and was super suspicious of many guys because of how messed up that relationship left me.

I took my time though, I did use the apps. But I have always been more of a conversation-before-sex type of guy. Ended up getting burned a few times while dating guys, but then started talking more and more to a guy I had met on one of the apps and became friendly with. We started going on actual dates and now he's my boyfriend and he's probably the best one I've ever had (so far).

Dating this time around wasn't as easy for me then as it was in my 20s. I ran into a lot of ""I just can never find a guy that wants to date me"" types and... well... after meeting them and/or hanging out a few times it was often clear why they were single. You'll probably notice that you're going to meet more guys with long-term things in mind than you did when you were younger.

Give it time. Don't rush. Make new friends. Figure out what, if any, type of friendship you'd like to maintain with your ex. Things won't turn around over night - give it time and you'll grow and get better! If you need it, don't be afraid to go talk to a therapist to help you get your mind back on track."
todayilearned,ff6azyi,t1_ff5fo00,1579623241.0,I used to walk to and from elementary school. Now the schools around me won't even let a kid off the bus unless someone pre-approved is there waiting for the kid. It's ridiculous.
