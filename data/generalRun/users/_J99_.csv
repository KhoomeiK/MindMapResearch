depression,feluhdt,t3_epm2ch,1579231241.0,"It must hurt, but honestly consider yourself lucky. His thought process on the illness of depression is honestly quite monstrous to say the least. Depression isn’t some made up thing, it’s a scientifically proven mental illness. And depressed people shouldn’t be locked away because they are suffering. That’s like us locking away cancer patients because their condition hurts their families. It’s monstrous and immoral. Your ex clearly didn’t understand the illness and how mental illness victims feel. Locking them away and giving them no love is plain evil. We are people to. If you got married to him then the relationship probably would have been mostly suffering."
depression,feb8sft,t3_eo1usb,1578956465.0,"I’m so sorry to hear that. I don’t think anyone should make fun of you at all. A) you said your in the health field and it’s a decent job so if your making enough money who cares if it’s only part time. B) anxiety and depression is honestly so hard to deal with simultaneously with a job, I’ve been down that road. You should honestly talk to your boyfriend and tell him how your anxiety and depression really affects you and how his jokes hurt your feelings. I’m sure he’ll understand and probably explain that to his parents as well. And youre still working hard despite what’s going on in your head and have goals to improve. I think youre doing fine for 22 years old"
depression,fde9aqs,t3_ekw6rp,1578334006.0,"I’m on the same road. It’s as if I know what to do but don’t do it. I perceive it as a fear of change or a fear of working hard to feel better and not feeling better after anyway. It honestly feels like I’m self sabotaging sometimes. But I wouldn’t beat yourself up about it though, helping yourself is very difficult. You have to fight the urge to sink into depression. It’s honestly painful to do sometimes. It’s 100% understandable why you feel this way. However, If you do the things to help yourself sometimes, that’s progress. Even doing it once is progress. Getting out of bed when you want to sleep all day is progress. Change is within your reach and is possible, you’ve proven that. But it’s def work. Its hard to help yourself. Very hard. You just gotta keep pushing, take small baby steps if necessary. That’s what I’m trying to do. I hope things get better for you soon."
depression,fde8don,t3_ekwp82,1578333425.0,"I know the feeling. It’s like you feel empty without the depression, like there is no thoughts anymore. You’re not insane for having those feelings. I eventually managed to break my addiction to depression, I hope you can to."
depression,fde5bgc,t3_ekwyjj,1578331509.0,"I know that feeling all to well. It honestly hurts inside a lot. But if you are diagnosed with mental illness there is no worth involved, it’s just how it is. Feeling unworthy of the illness can make it harder to work on fixing it. Stay strong if u can, I hope things get better :)"
depression,fd5hf5p,t1_fd1djaq,1578177677.0,"Where I live, they make you take a blood test and based on the blood test the doctors get a batch of meds that could possibly react well with your body. They then test one med at a time in varying dosages until you find one that works for you. Some of the meds may react well, some may do nothing, some may react bad. Once they narrow it down to the batch that could possibly work I believe it’s pretty much trial and error"

depression,fd0v46x,t3_ejtnln,1578124168.0,"I understand your pain. I had a friend die very young (although not to suicide) and it made me feel guilty about my own suicidal thoughts and attempts. The sadness and guilt can feel so overbearing that it makes you feel that much more suicidal. The disassociation from reality feels unbearable. I dont think you should feel guilty. Itâ€™s perfectly understandable why you feel the way you do. You lost a friend, almost lost your grandmother, and have all these issues in your own life on top of it. Life can be very painful sometimes. And for those with depression (like many of us on this page) it can be painful in our heads almost all the time. I think all we can really do is push on for the ones we lost and keep pushing for the betterment of ourselves to. So currently Iâ€™m soldiering on and trying to help myself get better. Iâ€™m not sure if this will work for you so try digging deep in yourself and finding something that can help you push through. Just know you arenâ€™t alone in the pain, many people on this page stand with you. I pray things get better for you."
depression,fcx0mmk,t1_fcx0c3d,1578045895.0,"Thanks, and same for you bro. If you need to talk or anything just send me a message ðŸ‘"
depression,fcx0irn,t1_fcwwoy0,1578045753.0,"I completely understand where youâ€™re coming from. Iâ€™ve been through something similar. You feel like a burden to people you care about and you feel taking yourself out of their lives will make their lives better (atleast thatâ€™s what I got from your post, please correct me if Iâ€™m wrong). Firstly, I bet youâ€™re a really nice guy and not a burden. Secondly, you donâ€™t have to block them or distance yourself. If they are your friends and they care about you then it will probably hurt them to be blocked. Maybe you can try talking to them about your issues and maybe they can help you. Pushing them away wonâ€™t benefit you or them. They arenâ€™t wasting their kindness because they want to be kind to you. They care about you. And just because they are kind to you doesnâ€™t mean they are using up kindness. I think kindness is kinda infinite thing and u can be kind to as many people as you choose. And You donâ€™t have to tell them everything thatâ€™s  going on if you donâ€™t want to, but you donâ€™t have to block them either. I would unblock them and explain briefly what caused the situation of blocking them and if you want to talk to them more about it then talk more. But blocking them and distancing only makes both groups sad. I doubt your friends see you as a ticking bomb. We all have things about ourselves that can use some work, including your friends. Anxiety can be helped. Iâ€™ve been through a lot of situations with anxiety and depression. And through several medications, hospitalization, suicide attempts, etc. ive learned they donâ€™t have to dominate your life. You can help yourself, itâ€™s hard work but it is possible. Iâ€™m still working on myself and Iâ€™m not in a good place rn tbh, but I have seen some progress. Either way I hope things get better for you man, my prayers r out to youðŸ™"
depression,fcx03z5,t1_fcwzu2w,1578045209.0,Thanks for the reply man. Iâ€™ll try talking to strangers and see if that works bc talking to friends and family can be complicated sometimes lmao. Thanks for the kind words and suggestions :)
depression,fcwzs0c,t1_fcwzlxz,1578044775.0,"No problem man, letâ€™s hope things get better for the both of usðŸ™"
depression,fcwzhmr,t1_fcwzbag,1578044394.0,"I understand. A lot of people just donâ€™t know the right way to react to depression and just think people use it as a crutch. Many people donâ€™t realize itâ€™s an actual mental illness that literally takes lives. I hope your parents one day open their eyes to this and maybe try to make amends to how they treated you. I would suggest trying your best to pull through and do things you enjoy doing (if you have any, I know depression can sap joy out of everything sometimes) until you are in a place where you can get the help you need. I hope things get better for you manðŸ™"
depression,fcwyzzz,t1_fcwy5dh,1578043748.0,"I completely understand. Honestly your situation sounds a lot like how mine was a while ago. My friends were supportive to me, but donâ€™t understand depression because they donâ€™t have it. I feel inferior still when talking about my issues with them. My parents r also a main reason for how I am (but in my honest belief I feel they didnâ€™t do it on purpose, but thatâ€™s in my situation). They donâ€™t understand and were very judgemental at first. Iâ€™m 18 now and when this was all going down I was like 13-16 so I couldnâ€™t support myself either. What happened in my case was once my mom found out about my self harm thatâ€™s when my family realized the depression was no joke and tried to help. Maybe explaining to them how depression effects you can open their eyes to whatâ€™s going on. Then once you talk more with them you can tell them how you feel they contributed to your depression and see if there are ways to make amends and solve the issue. I donâ€™t think it would hurt to try talking with them, but thatâ€™s my opinion on the matter. Either way I hope things get better for you manðŸ™"
depression,fcwysds,t3_ejcsmb,1578043469.0,"Iâ€™m on anti-depressants currently and honestly I have mixed feelings about them. To answer your first question, you get them from your psychiatrist through prescription after speaking with your main doctor (atleast thatâ€™s how it works where I live). To how they make me feel is mixed answers. It all depends on how your body reacts to certain meds. For some people one med can work as a miracle drug and make dealing with depression so much more manageable. Even then the boost may not last forever. In other cases a med can literally fuck you up and cause rage episodes. Some cases you may not feel a thing in certain meds and feel something from others. Iâ€™ve been on many ends of the stick when it comes to meds and from my experience it all seems like trial and error. I would think there is obv research on how meds react to blood types, illnesses, and body types; but at the same time idk if the effect of the med is 100% guaranteed and how people react is heavily unique. Iâ€™m not a doctor so this can all easily be wrong but this is how it felt for me in my experience with anti depressants. I donâ€™t regret trying meds bc the meds Iâ€™m currently on have helped me quite a bit (even if it was a pain in the fucking ass to find out which med worked for me)"
depression,fcwy93s,t3_ejcss8,1578042787.0,"Taking that leap of faith to end it all is a very hard thing to do. Your body physically wonâ€™t let you sometimes. Iâ€™ve attempted the leap of faith but never succeeded. Please try and find a way to not want to take that leap. I know that is WAY easier said than done, but please try. Depression can make you have tunnel vision and see only what it wants you to see. Look deep inside yourself and see how people would react if you took your life. If that doesnâ€™t work try finding external help such as therapy. In all honesty it takes A LOT of work to learn how to cope with depression. Iâ€™ve been hospitalized twice, been on several meds, have years of therapy under my belt and Iâ€™m still not in a good place. But just know it is possible to help yourself. It is possible to feel better. And also just know you arenâ€™t alone in this cruel world, almost everyone on this page is here standing with you. I pray things get better for you man"
depression,fcwy12i,t3_ejctdx,1578042506.0,"I know the feeling man. Iâ€™ve done attempts to end it all, all obv failures. Since then tho I have been trying to get better. I have been self harm sober and suicide attempt free for a while now. I would suggest try looking deep into yourself and find people who truly care for you in your life. Think how they would feel if you were to end your life. If that doesnâ€™t work then try talking to somebody about what your feeling. A trusted friend, trusted family member, therapist, etc. I know it sounds cheesy suggesting â€œTalk about your feelings and you will feel betterâ€, but in all honesty it can help. By no means does it rid you of your issues and by no means does it solve the problems within your mind, but it can help a little to hear somebody validate the things your going through"
depression,fcwxrp3,t3_ejctvl,1578042169.0,"Yeah opening up to your family about self harm can be very difficult. In my case my mother found out without me telling her and freaked out badly. If I were able to rewrite that I would maybe try going into the discussion cautiously. Maybe approach your parents and be like â€œHey mom/dad, I have something really important to tell you. Itâ€™s about the depression issues I have been telling you guys about. I have been harming myself. I want to find help and I donâ€™t want to leave you guys in the dark about itâ€. However Iâ€™m not sure what your relationship is with your parents so obv I would suggest finding a way to tell ur parents about the situation without freaking them out in a matter that fits for you"
depression,fconfw9,t3_ei19sk,1577836622.0,"Iâ€™m alone on NYE to, always am. Just know itâ€™s just a day and the future can bring better NYEs. Hopefully next year brightens up for everybody whoâ€™s not feeling to good inside"
depression,fclhwkp,t3_ehtsut,1577748181.0,"I feel you man, social life in general is difficult when you have depression. Iâ€™ve been depressed for a long time and have been in and out of hospitalization. And during that time Iâ€™ve really struggled socially. Iâ€™m not sure what is going on with you and your friends, but in my case they all kinda alienated me because they had their own lives. My friends got gfs, jobs, had college shit to do, moved schools, etc. So I donâ€™t see or talk to people often. Iâ€™m off and on suicidal tendencies but never had the courage to go all the way. Ive been trying to feel better about my life, but I just canâ€™t yet. When inside the pit of depression, it may seem like youâ€™re all alone and helpless in life, but you arenâ€™t alone. Many people are in the pit of depression. Millions of people, including me, are in the same sorta struggle and we support you. I hope you start feeling better soon, my prayers out to you manðŸ™"
depression,fcl89fu,t3_eh9up7,1577741952.0,"Iâ€™m in the same situation. Iâ€™ve been in the circle of wanting to take my life, but realizing I canâ€™t for years. I want to end my life, but my mother and father would be devastated. Although I donâ€™t want to live another worthless, lonely, pathetic, and sad year; I feel I have to for my familyâ€™s sake. Ive tried to make life feel bearable since I canâ€™t remove myself. Iâ€™ve tried hanging out with the people I do like in life. I play video games which is something I still feel some enjoyment towards. Depression makes it real hard to do things so you really gotta push. Have you tried therapy? Although I havenâ€™t felt much better since starting, therapy can maybe help you. The only thing we can really do is try our best to feel better because we canâ€™t remove ourselves from life without hurting those close to us."
depression,fchigbb,t3_ehalru,1577650740.0,"That sucks, Iâ€™m sure heâ€™s not trying to hurt you because he did block the girl but still it must hurt. He probably just doesnâ€™t understand how much it bothers you. Maybe you can try having a serious convo with him about it so he understands"
depression,fchdk57,t3_egzqgq,1577649530.0,"Iâ€™m so sorry to hear youâ€™re suffering. Just know you arenâ€™t alone, I also have been falling down close to relapse. I already had to move most the knives in my house. Ive relapsed before and I was able to bounce back, I hope you can do the same. Try drawing on yourself instead of cutting, thatâ€™s always worked for me. Helping yourself is a very hard thing to do, but we gotta keep pushing. No matter how hard it is."
depression,fc5skdl,t3_eg9dzt,1577464919.0,I feel the same way man. I try to ignore my thoughts but every second I think about my internal craving for love and companionship. It makes me more miserable than I already am. Iâ€™m not someone a person would love. I feel so repulsive inside.
depression,fb9ofp9,t1_fb9o68m,1576644336.0,"Agreed, itâ€™s just so hard to work through the depression sometimes. But I guess we have to keep pushing and try our best to be our ideal selves"
