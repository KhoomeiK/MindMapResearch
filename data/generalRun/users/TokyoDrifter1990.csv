i don't want to be an armchair psychologist, but i get the feeling that lying, stealing, and violent visions stem from the bullying you went through. so focusing on that might streamline your therapy.

in fact, i will advise you to tackle one issue at a time. from the list, the things that strike out to me were:
- bullying, grade 3 to 8
- habitual lying
- cut-off bonds with people close to you
- night time demonic visions

these things may also be related. as i said, take your time talking to your therapist, and learn to slowly build trust with him/her. it seems to me you find it hard to control lying, so it's best to take things slow. even being completely honest about just one thing per session is a step forward."
