I walk out of my class that's before lunch, and start walking to the lunch line, but I don't recognize anyone. I feel weird but assume I just haven't seen my friends yet. I get my lunch the lunch ladies are different. I go to sit down and my friends aren't there, and I still don't recognize anyone. I go to my next class, and it's not my class, and I finally realize that I had gone to second lunch somehow. 

But here's where it gets weird. My school had a policy where if you skipped class, they called your parents, no exceptions. I would have had to miss the class right after my lunch to go to second lunch, so they should have called my parents, but they didn't. I never mentioned this to anyone so I don't know if I really missed the class or not.
