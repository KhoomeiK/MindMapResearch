nosework,ff9ki5a,t3_esd9fn,1579714926.0,"Rocket and I had our first go at NW1 this past weekend in Spartanburg, SC. No title for us (I made a really dumb handling error, which I'll explain later), but I am overall really pleased with how it went.  
  
First of all it was really awesome to see how many people were able to run FEO (for exhibition only)! FEO is a wonderful opportunity to get some trial experience without the pressure of running for record. If you think you'd like to trial soon but you aren't sure if you're ready, keep an eye on the trials around you to see if any are accepting FEO entries (usually it means the trial didn't fill).  
  
The trial site was a fairground...it's a pretty common type of trial venue, because there's plenty of exterior space available for flow/parking and you can usually rent buildings individually as needed. If you have a reactive dog team, a fairground trial is a safe bet for having plenty of elbow room. The weather was chilly, upper 30s Fahrenheit, and it rained in the afternoon.  
  
Our first search of the day was Exteriors. The area was huge for a NW1...it was a covered picnic area next to a building and an adjoining concrete pad. The concrete pad was empty except for a trash can on the far end, and the picnic area had 3 tables arranged in the middle with the rest pushed off to the edge. Since there is only one hide in a NW1 search, my plan was to hold Rocket a bit at threshold but let her take the lead otherwise. I didn't see a reason to try and waste time patterning the tables (this will become a theme later lol). In classic Puppy Spaz fashion, she took off for the trashcan at the back of the search area, and then I guided her back to the tables where she caught the hide on the farthest one from the startline. 41 seconds...not bad!  
  
Second was vehicles, which was INDOORS! I've never done an indoor vehicle search before, but I have heard of them in Elite trials and element specialty trials. It kinda changes things up because there is so much less airflow inside a fully enclosed space. Again I decided to let Rocket take the lead here, but I worked her on a 6ft leash to limit her range a bit. She caught odor on the back of one of the vehicles really quickly, but didn't seem to pinpoint it to a specific source. After I let her work it a little too long, I decided to walk her around the other 2 vehicles just to make sure...nope, definitely on that first vehicle. At this point I SHOULD have walked her completely around that one, but instead I let her latch back onto the rear bumper and overwork it until we heard the 30-second warning. The hide turned out to be on the front of the vehicle, and the odor was just collecting on the back from the door opening and closing. Duh. I did Rocket dirty, and this cost us our title. She got jackpotted at the hide and seemed to forgive me for my bad handling.  
  
The third search was interiors, in some kind of small animal exhibition room. There were a couple of random objects in the room...2 chairs, a retail cart of some kind, and a mop bucket. Based on experience I figured it was probably on one of those things and finally got smart enough to pattern the room...lo and behold it was on the mop bucket. 17 seconds later we were out of there.   
  
Last search of the day was containers, 14 ORT boxes set up in 2 rows. This was a pretty straightforward search, but Rocket tends to search containers counterclockwise and it was in one of the last boxes on the left. She also got stuck a little bit on some odor blowing onto the first few boxes. Still a pretty solid search, 19 seconds.  
  
Overall I was very pleased with Rocket's performance. She is very environmentally stable and her odor obedience is fantastic for her tender age. My greatest lesson from this trial was not to be afraid to step in and handle her more, especially if she's stuck. A few seconds lost patterning the wrong stuff is certainly better than missing the hide entirely, and it's a skill we'll need for higher levels anyway.  
We're set to try again March 21st, and I have every confidence she'll do great."

k9sports,ff33t3u,t3_erd89i,1579532962.0,"Rocket and I tried NW1 on Saturday. We didn't title because I made a really dumb handling error on vehicles (*wow, she's really working the back of this vehicle, better stand around pickin' my nose instead of maybe checking the FRONT OF THE DAMN THING*), but Rocket was definitely more than prepared to be there. She worked odor diligently and accurately, ignored a lot of weird/novel environmental stuff, and actually stayed pretty chill in staging. We're set to try again March 21st and I'm sure we'll get it (as long as I bring MY brain to the trial this time).  
  
This weekend she gets her real birthday present, some dock time! She jumped into a fountain at a rest stop yesterday, so I'm sure she'll be pleased as punch to get an actual swim in."

dogs,fee48oq,t3_eolqbc,1579026068.0,"I spent some time pondering and troubleshooting Bruno's broken treat-taking behavior this past week, and noted that he has no problems taking food from me in the context of nosework, or when he's begging for a bite of my dinner lol. I don't want to poison nosework for him (it's basically the only structured activity he likes to do anymore), so I tried exploiting the begging context...which actually kinda worked? I made a big show out of pretending to eat a big piece of fish on our walk the other day and he came over like ""ooo gimme that"". He was also willing to take more of it during the walk without me pretending to eat it first. Hopefully a little change in context will help overwrite whatever negative stuff he's built up around treat-taking.  
  
In sporty news, Rocket and I got recruited for a flyball team at agility class yesterday. Flyball was not on my radar at all, so now I have to decide if it fits into Rocket's already ridiculous social calendar. I really need to sit down and decide what her sport focus is going to be, but she's not making the decision very easy!  
I also got a huge compliment on my toy play last night, and I'm still giddy about it."

I don't even know if I can really call it an agility class because it's really more of a generic dog sports foundations class...think TEAM1 mixed with a tricks/shaping class mixed with a play class. I would have loved to have taken this sooner, but the waitlist is aaaaaages long since it's super popular and people tend to repeat with puppies until they can pass the final exam.  
  
I am also both excited and not excited that Rocket's NW1 is this weekend. I'm excited because she's more than ready and is going to kill it, but I'm not excited for her to be a year old already. Where's my baby?"

k9sports,fdn31c5,t3_em2nz5,1578575799.0,"I train year-round. It doesn't get below -10°C here toooo often, but I am regularly out in subzero temps in the wintertime. There are a few scent theory things I like to keep in mind when it's chilly out:  
  
* Odor cones are going to be much smaller when it's cold. Your dog may have to do more detail work to catch a hide that would be easily findable in the summertime. It's a good time to work on patterning and detailing strategies, and maybe not such a good time to work on hides that have smaller odor cones on a good day (e.g. crack hides).  
* Snow hangs onto odor bigtime. Don't be surprised if your dog scans the heck out of the snow looking for odor that has fallen there. A hide buried in snow may be very challenging to find without detail work.  
* I don't work outside if it's below -20°C. Essential oils have a freezing point too, and odor won't propagate much at all if it's frozen. Plus it's just miserable to be goofing around in super cold weather.  
* Give your dog some time to transition from outside to inside and vice versa. It takes a minute or two for the olfactory system to recalibrate to a change in temperature/humidity. Also if your house is anything like mine in the winter, make sure your dog stays hydrated because heating a home dries the air out bigtime.  
* There's plenty to do inside if you don't want to be out in the cold...brush up on your indication (if you have one), work elevation on a wall, work converging odor problems in a small room, play around with the airflow when the heat's on, do confidence-building with easy searches. You don't need lots of room or a novel area to work on scent work."
dogs,fdkrvgn,t3_elc0og,1578509860.0,"I want to get back into obedience with my GSD again...he was suuuper close to ring-ready for Rally before he got sick. Unfortunately I am an idiot and am noticing that I poisoned a bunch of training-related things while he was sick, so we have quite the hole to dig out of. So far I can tell that I've poisoned both a verbal yes and a click, any sort of engagement in the basement or driveway, taking more than one treat from my hand, and an assortment of treats.  
  
I'm in the process of crafting a plan to get out of this hole, but it's definitely going to take a lot of time and lowered expectations. I'm considering taking a basic obedience class with him again, to see if a fresh start in a new location helps. I'll keep you posted :)"
