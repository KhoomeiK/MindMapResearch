offmychest,ff4ohx8,t3_erg32o,1579568613.0,"I'm dealing with a similar situation myself right now. I told a close friend of mine yesterday that I like her and, unfortunately, she has feelings for someone else. 

I personally don't want to have to cut contact with her to get over these feelings, because she's the one I always go to when I'm feeling down and like I can't do anything right. She's always so supportive and I value my friendship with her immensely.

I guess only time will tell what will happen."
offmychest,ff44snr,t1_ff2g1yg,1579555539.0,That’s what I did. And she said she likes someone else
DestinyTheGame,fep3zik,t3_ensfrd,1579311616.0,"I haven't done an lfg raid in quite a while (or any raids recently, but that's because of a lack of desire to play destiny lately). But I've certainly had my fair share of toxic lfg raids and don't really have any desire to try those ever again."
destiny2,fe5qrjp,t1_fe2v9k7,1578873164.0,"Helmet: Bumblebee

Gloves: Nessus Mirage (yes, it's a gree, uncommon rarity shader)

Chest: Crimson Valor

Boots: Cerulean Divide (to my knowledge, you can only get the split colors with the tangled web boots)

Class item: Safety First"
destiny2,fe5q6qb,t1_fe3u1am,1578873011.0,"They're the tangled web boots with the cerulean divide shader. You can get a different color on each leg with some other shaders too, but they have to be these boots"
destiny2,fe5pn0n,t1_fe2ikhd,1578872677.0,"Nah, those are still too good for him"
destiny2,fe2gn7z,t1_fe0lnmp,1578838121.0,"Skittles are too good for my titan. At best, he’d get some bargain brand rainbow candy"
destiny2,fe2gk7o,t1_fe0nvnt,1578838083.0,I never considered it like that
destiny2,fe2giz9,t1_fe2aata,1578838065.0,All the more ridiculous for my titan then
destiny2,fe2geql,t1_fe0nybk,1578838046.0,That is what happens when you eat them
destiny2,fe2g50d,t1_fe0m4qj,1578838014.0,"Thank you, thank you. That was the intention"
destiny2,fe2g0xu,t1_fe1mch1,1578837976.0,It seems my look won’t be complete until I have some gloves that can have 2 different colors
DestinyTheGame,fe0usln,t3_en6lg5,1578818917.0,"I personally thought that destiny peaked with forsaken. There was so much to do and had one of the best raids in the entirety of destiny. I also enjoyed shadowkeep a lot, but to a lesser extent. I understand that the annual pass dlcs will always be smaller, since they are cheaper than the full expansions every year.

But I agree that it feels like there's so little to do for vets of the game right now. Even the sundial feels like a watered down version of menagerie.

I'm gonna get the ritual weapons and maybe, MAYBE, get the seasonal title. The game just doesn't hold the same attraction as it used to for me."
memes,fe0svja,t1_fdzkuk7,1578818224.0,Universal nice
destiny2,fe0nnq2,t3_enk6bh,1578816468.0,"Nice! I've only gotten a couple myself, but they were exciting to get for sure. Congrats!"
destiny2,fe0m0m5,t3_enk9dw,1578815847.0,I'm glad you're clearly enjoying destiny more than I am right now. I just reached 55
DnD,f3vnf0o,t1_f3trqa2,1571180149.0,I've been thinking about getting some dice of my own. This seems like a good opportunity to try for.
