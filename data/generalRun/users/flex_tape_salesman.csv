GamersRiseUp,febcgud,t1_feaknfc,1578957463.0,True and depending on how the jokes are made it can make you come off as a lot less patronising which is something a lot of people do by treating them like useless fucks

PoliticalDiscussion,fea6do0,t1_fea3otx,1578944877.0,Beto was mened too much by trump supporters and it definitely hurt his campaign while booker went more under the radar and its hard to know if that helped him or hurt him

PoliticalCompassMemes,fea3xjw,t1_fea0zn2,1578944114.0,"Some of the questions are pretty dumb and it's way too short. Religion for example shouldn't have any questions considering you can be in any quadrant and be either religious or non religious. A good example of the innacuracy is the question ""Do you think that the rich are taxed too highly?"" everyone I know is either in favour of flat or progressive income tax rate but for the rich to pay a smaller percentage than the rest is almost unheard of. The question doesn't properly separate left and right wing views"

ForeverAlone,fe4t922,t3_eniciz,1578862584.0,Maybe you could start volunteering. I've heard a lot of people say that it helps break out of that or even just a part time job where you have to interact with customers or even just a few other workers and try to fit either of them around your life. People aren't just going to fall into your life and you have to work hard but to lose the feeling of loneliness is one of the greatest feelings you can get. A few years back I had no friends because I went to a new school and I was shy but I slowly started to get friends and now I'm doing well and the feeling of people acknowledging my existence and liking me is great
ForeverAlone,fe4qiqc,t3_enl77m,1578861897.0,You talking about liking her is the part that suggests you should probably stop being friends with him. It would be annoying if you had kept it to yourself but thats just fucked up

unpopularopinion,fdokdqi,t1_fdojv5y,1578606909.0,It depends on the people who are voting. Most days theres multiple posts against the fat pride movement which will get massive amounts of upvotes and while not always the most popular they're not unpopular. The subs intention was never to get overly political and when it got really popular it started to get more political.
fightporn,fdojwho,t1_fdoeq2v,1578606634.0,Alcohol changes people differently. Plenty of shy people become very sociable when drunk and it can be the same with this but obviously it's impossible to say.
