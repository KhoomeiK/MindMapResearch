trees,fev8uu2,t3_eqp2lu,1579394485.0,"A blunt might be too much for you if its your first time, but that's just a suggestion. As for smoke elimination, if you can't go out and buy something special, you can cut the bottom off of a bottle, put about 3 fabric softener sheets in with like one or two napkins, not to block it completely. Then you wanna take an old sock, preferably clean, and just put it over the cut off end. Then blow your smoke through the bottle mouth. You'll still see some smoke come out but it'll be less smoky and smell like you're doing laundry."

NatureIsFuckingLit,feka42f,t3_epirt1,1579195766.0,It started out so pleasant. I was rooting for that stretch when he just had his arms out. But then he did that thing. I changed my mind.
