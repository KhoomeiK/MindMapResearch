Damnthatsinteresting,fdna9pe,t1_fdlxooc,1578581377.0,"Yes! Actually what you're talking about is how your body is reacting to the environmental changes occuring that prelude storms.  

Moisture. First, you notice the freshness of the air (mainly if you're not in a major town/city). You can somehow even smell it better, and that's just cause the atmosphere is getting slowly saturated with more moisture which makes smells travel more efficiently.  

Ozone. The air around you starts forming Ozone (O3) through the electrical discharge that's occuring in the atmosphere too. Basically making particles in the air ionized which will help cause lightning/thunder. 

Atmospheric pressure also changes obviously, since as far as I know that's the main cause for wind or air movement in general? 

Hope this gives you some more insight on that ""nice feeling"" we get right before the storm"

Damnthatsinteresting,fdna9pe,t1_fdlxooc,1578581377.0,"Yes! Actually what you're talking about is how your body is reacting to the environmental changes occuring that prelude storms.  

Moisture. First, you notice the freshness of the air (mainly if you're not in a major town/city). You can somehow even smell it better, and that's just cause the atmosphere is getting slowly saturated with more moisture which makes smells travel more efficiently.  

Ozone. The air around you starts forming Ozone (O3) through the electrical discharge that's occuring in the atmosphere too. Basically making particles in the air ionized which will help cause lightning/thunder. 

Atmospheric pressure also changes obviously, since as far as I know that's the main cause for wind or air movement in general? 

Hope this gives you some more insight on that ""nice feeling"" we get right before the storm"

It was nice zooming past the unfortunate pileup of shitty slow drivers plaguing most of my ride. I bet he didn't care once he saw me almost get rear/side-ended by an old lady trying to get in my lane too quickly (reckon I was in her blindspot but holy shit I saw a car pull up into my rear view so close instantly and it shook me). 

I slowed down eventually once we started reaching a major town since I knew there were radars along there."

privacy,fd6otdw,t1_fd69u5r,1578193922.0,"Oh I totally understand you! The crypto-ecosystem went on a shitshow in 2017 and that was mainly due to the fact that a lot of new projects were developed and released under Ethereum's network. People soon started relating cryptocurrencies and the projects they represent as assets that they can trade and use to get-rich-quick kind of scheme.
Obviously this worked for a lot, but it also dragged a lot down the hellhole. People need to realize that this is a whole new economic market, and no one should treat it as a main source of investment.
I personally was lucky to still make some profits out of it, but I'm mainly in it now just to look out for some projects that might be interesting to me personally that I might benefit from or use sometime eventually if Ethereum (or any other decentralized application platform) manages to sustain and establish web 3.0
