Anne,ff8ek5c,t3_es7sa8,1579675143.0,"I know the ending was rushed and not really to how the writers truly intended, but the way I interpret it is that Ka'kwet didn't get such a happy ending because that was the reality of most Indian children that were taken away and put back into reservations...at least in the US, anyways."
bulletjournal,fem9r89,t1_felq2b3,1579245072.0,"Like the other person said, I'm pretty sure it's the Uniqlo one. I was going to link you but idk if that's against the rules, so search up ""WOMEN WOOL-BLEND MINI SKIRT"" color 37 Brown."

ZeroWaste,fdhawrv,t1_fdfygk0,1578419100.0,"I put it through a blender with a grinder attachment and sprinkle it over my worm bin so that my worms can use it as grit. Eggshells also help balance the pH of their enviroment, so that's a plus!"
bookclub,fdfxzl3,t3_el4bzf,1578373350.0,"I was surprised to see how I liked the book. I really like that it's slow-paced. I think that adds to the isolated feel of the community, where everything feels still and overall unchanging (despite the occasional new building or the slow re-introduction of technology).

Also-- damn, the descriptions of food in the context of the situation of the book makes the food feel much nicer and scarcer. The author never goes in detail, but it makes me want to try moose meat or eat some jam."
notebooks,fdfbbaj,t1_fdesmtb,1578357660.0,"Same, I tried out A&O as my journal for last year. Stuck with it for this year, too. My absolute favorite! I suppose everyone looks for different things out of their journal though."
knitting,fdclbvd,t1_fdck87x,1578277750.0,I need to learn how to knit for this reason. There's a crop-top sweater I recently bought that I would love to copy with minor edits and better yarn. I plan to learn after I finish crocheting a baby blanket for my dog!
Vermiculture,fdcj9d7,t3_ekkfun,1578276271.0,"They should settle down soon but it's weird. My first batch of worms were chill but my second batch of red wrigglers were way the hell more antsy. A lot of them died playing Dora the Explorer, even though I did the same setup for them. But yeah, my second batch of earthworms did pretty much the same as you've described when I got them."
knitting,fdci9k1,t3_eklcd5,1578275572.0,I like your version better than the sample picture of the cardigan pattern
bulletjournal,fdbdwgc,t3_ekggrs,1578256452.0,"That's pretty cool! I love the color scale you have for each one, too. Very aesthetically pleasing"
Anne,fdb2ph3,t3_ekfzqi,1578253098.0,Didn't they release a statement that it won't come back? Would be really cool if the show did renew though. Whose mind do fans need to change--do we know?
