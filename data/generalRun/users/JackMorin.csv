AskReddit,ffpfmne,t3_eu0agw,1580093854.0,"Employers are hoping to test your level of honesty. If you respond that you don’t have any weaknesses they will regard you as a “know all” who will be untrainable. All of us have our flaws and surely you should have one too. Your weakness may not even be something negative. Below are some of the acceptable weaknesses:

1. I’m a perfectionist and believe in doing things right the first time. I’m disappointed when I have to redo things because not only is it a waste of time but it also has an impact on productivity.
2. I’m a workaholic. At times I neglect my health by not visiting restrooms frequently. I’m driven to reach and exceed targets and that makes me forget about everything else.
3. People regard me as antisocial because I refuse to participate in office gossip. I’m an excellent team member but walk away from my team as soon as the discussion leaves the work environment.
4. I dislike it when fellow employees distract me from my work with casual chats. Breaks are there for casual chats and time to work is not intended for unrelated discussions.
5. I’m a private person and prefer not to discuss my personal life with colleagues.
6. I’m afraid of public speaking especially to crowds but I joined Toastmasters in an effort to improve my skills. I’m currently enrolled.
7. I’m afraid of driving in peak traffic. Therefore I leave home st the crack of dawn to arrive at work before starting time. I realize that this position requires driving at different times. For that reason, I started practicing to drive in peak traffic during my breaks and off days to overcome that fear.
8. I’m addicted to coffee which increases my restroom visits but also increases my productivity because caffeine hypes me up.
9. I’m only fluent in one language but I’m currently attending Spanish lessons or I intend enrolling for Spanish classes.
10. I don’t make friends easily but get on well with almost everyone (colleagues)
11. I’m not comfortable taking risks. I realize that I have to work on taking calculated risks because without risks there will be no profits. You have to spend money to make money.
12. I’m a procrastinator: leaving things for the last minute. Tomorrow is promised to no one and anything can happen which may prevent you from completing tasks. Therefore I’m learning to create a sense of urgency. In case I become ill I will still meet deadlines. I used to wait until the last minute before scheduling appointments for the coming week but I realize that advance planning helps me to be proactive and allows me time to segment according to priorities.
13. I don’t have much patience when working in a team. I’m incredibly self-sufficient, therefore it is difficult to rely on coworkers to complete my work. I prefer working independently but I’m working on improving in that area. I enrolled in team-building workshops.
14. I struggle with organization. My messy desk never interfered with my performance but could possibly hinder my effectiveness. My inbox is cluttered and could be better organized. I’m working to declutter my workstation as well as my inbox.
15. I am timid when giving constructive criticism to coworkers. I fear to hurt their feelings and withhold my honest opinion. I realize that it is not what you say but how you say it. Constructive criticism is essential to build team member's abilities.
16. My blunt, honest feedback leads to efficiency because my subordinates appreciate honesty. It wasn’t always like that in the past.
17. I’m not great at analyzing data or numbers but I realize that this flaw can prevent me from understanding how content is performing online. To overcome this I received my Google Analytics certificate and use the assistance of SEO data analysts.
18. I’m a perfectionist who pays attention to detail and often used to triple check spreadsheets looking for mistakes and proofread all my emails to ensure that it is free from errors when I send it out. I’ve since learned the importance of time management and budget my time according to areas of importance.
19. Sometimes I take on more tasks than necessary because I believe that I can trust my own work but I realize by delegating some of my less important tasks I could concentrate on tasks that really required my input.
20. Although I’m computer literate, I’m unfamiliar with the latest software. I found Youtube websites that clearly demonstrated the use of these programs and I’m currently upgrading in those areas by using these websites
21. My own personal weakness is that I treat my employer's business as if it was my own. I cannot stand to see how fraudsters could steal from my employer without getting arrested. I was working in the fraud department where I arranged to go with the fraud investigators in search of fraudsters. Our presence caused a backlog and the liquor shop owner told us to leave because he was losing business. My employer explained to me that my employer was insured against all types of losses. We were employed in the fraud department to reduce losses not eliminate it."
AskReddit,ffpfemt,t3_euawng,1580093694.0,"Okay, so our culture has this “courtship” thing that men do to make the lady their girlfriend. Well, there are some people who do not practice it anymore but that, I think, is still relevant.

There are different time periods on how long a guy should court her. It always depends to the girl when will she ever say “Yes” and make him her boyfriend.

I like this guy a lot. He ended up confessing his feelings to me first (which was so magical and unexpected to me). We talked continuosly for some time, then he ghosted me for a week (SO FRUSTRATING!!! GOD). But, when I went to the university to finish some requirements, he then told me that he has been thinking a lot about it and finally was fully decided to pursue and court me whatever or however it takes.

I don’t just let any guy court me. It is a very serious thing to in my side. But, I let him ’cause I really like him and he had some big chances.

But, after two weeks, he just told me he’s not doing it anymore. He had this fear of commitment and said he was not ready. Yeah, fine. Whatever. I hate you, Duard."
AskReddit,ffkovlz,t3_etr4no,1580026336.0,"”A gentleman is a Gentle Man.” - Daniel Hinnebusch

Simple, yet profound. This suggestion was given to me, at the time unattached, by a kindred spirit that I considered good…good to his wife, good to all women and men, the kind of quality, honest person that guys want to befriend and women want as a brother or a mate.

I told this to a man that I considered rough around the edges, and he thought I was speaking of a man in a three-piece suit, a “pretty boy,” as he was fond of referring to other men that he felt fluffed and folded and cared about appearances, style vs. substance, in his view.

No, that isn’t what I meant, “gents and ladies.”

I meant, gentle to women, children, all individuals. Someone who doesn’t discriminate against people, isn’t prejudiced, isn’t petty, who shows traits of patience, integrity, honest speech seasoned with hope. Someone who considers the needs of his own progeny, even above his own.

Basically, I think no woman or man fits all this but it is nice to strive for and is laid out for people but not everyone likes or believes in the source so much of society is still searching for a “magic” recipe when it is so simple, we can humble ourselves like children to learn it.

Practicing loving-kindness is indeed a practice and a learned trait, rather than innate."

But, it so happens that many things that happen in movies *never, ever* happen in real life. How many times have you been sitting down watching a film and realize to yourself—Nah, this would *never* go down in real life?

From conversations to accidents and events, there are so many times we watch movies and feel as though it’s way too dramatized and fake. Recently, Reddit users began to share their takes on things movies totally spice up that you’d never see off the big screen.  


1.  Leaving the house without even touching the breakfast mom made. My mom would fucking kill me.   

2.  if a girl is arguing with you in real life and you kiss her to shut her up she will most likely not appreciate it.   

3. Phone call: “turn on the tv” tv:   
“exactly the correct station at the beginning of the news story the person called about”  

4.  When you get out of bed after having sex and your underwear is still on.

AskReddit,ffi738t,t3_etcyd6,1579966816.0,"Depression has long been linked to suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts. Learning how to recognize depression, spotting when it gets worse, and finding the right resources can literally mean the difference between life and death.

There was a time when depression was seen as something people just had to “get over.” There was a stigma attached that said those with depression simply needed to “toughen up.” But in recent years, that erroneous attitude has been replaced with much more understanding.

“I think the biggest change I’ve seen over the years is more public information about depression and suicide and more treatment options,” Tedder said. “Though medication is not the only treatment option for depression, there are a lot more choices of antidepressants that produce effective results with fewer side effects.”"

Intriguingly, the gender suicide gap widens during puberty, possibly resulting from pressure associated with gender role socialization, since when exposed to similar pressures, eg. in the military, men and women commit suicide at similar rates"
AskReddit,ffen984,t3_esr647,1579855563.0,"I’m good with numbers but I HATE calculating anything related to my personal finances.

I passed the first few actuarial exams (years ago when the SOA used a different professional development scheme) and worked for 5 years in reserves. I loved the intensity of the work and I was very good at it. I only quit that career because my family asked me to.

But, as much as I loved analyzing, forecasting and troubleshooting over a billion dollars worth of my company’s business, I couldn’t stand doing my own.

Maybe I needed to mentally devote myself so completely to the work that I instinctively didn’t want anything else in life to compete with it? But over 10 years later, I still resent balancing my checkbook and doing my taxes.

Maybe I need to feel like I’m helping someone in order for the work to feel like it has a “real” purpose.

AskReddit,ff8m8p5,t3_es53p0,1579685486.0,"In our college, there was this guy. He always kept to himself, never made any efforts to mingle with people or even initiate small talk. He would reply if you went to him and asked something. But that’s it.

In my 1st year, most of us had labeled him as an introvert and boring. Since he didn’t participate in the daily gossips and preferred to enjoy on his own, even people didn’t bother to approach him.

Can you guess what happened after 4 years?

He was the most sought after guy. He would get 5–10 calls daily from different groups to join them. He still preferred to spend his time alone when he wanted to, and the rest of the time he could just go anywhere and be part of any activity. Four years and his label had changed from ‘boring’ to ‘cool’.

Turns out, he was indeed the coolest guy you could come across. He always had something interesting to offer, could make fool out of someone without even changing his expression and was so damn good at everything he did. The best part is, I never saw him worry about anything except girls. Yes, there was a proposal that made him bathe in his sweat.

Point is, you can’t label someone without even knowing them. And even if you get to know someone well enough, it doesn’t mean everyone else will share your thoughts. What’s boring to you, could be extremely entertaining to me.

So if someone is boring to you, that’s just your perception, not a generalization. In the end, you brand someone as boring according to your interests at any given point of time. Remember, people, change with time and so does your perception."
