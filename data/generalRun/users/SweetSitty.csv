relationship_advice,fgusneg,t3_f0kyk4,1581128519.0,"I think it's doable, as long as there is an end date established. When my husband and I started dating it was long distance for the first year, but we knew it was only for a year. We were both in school in different states, and planned to be together after the school year (we started dating in the summer). I don't know if I could have managed if there were no date planned to be living closer"

dogs,fgt59wm,t3_f0bfuw,1581099335.0,"Rather than looking for a breed, I recommend seeking a very chill dog. Found my pup at a shelter and noticed he had a remarkably calm manner. Not aggressive, not barking, just came over and leaned against me. In that moment I knew he was the one for me. Hyperactive dogs are a lot of fun, but they can be a challenge, especially for a first time pet owner. Good luck finding your new best friend!"
dogs,fgt4fnf,t3_f0d6u2,1581098833.0,"Adopted my pup when he was about 2 y/o and he had no idea how to be a pet. It's taken a long time, but after 4 years he is acting more and more like a pup. He now plays fetch, will ask to go for a walk, and just about a month ago started coming up for cuddles. I nearly cried the first time he crawled in my lap to ask for a tummy rub. It's never too late, but you may need to be patient."
Marriage,fgt3x4v,t3_f0d7l4,1581098524.0,"I slept with my daughter until she was 6 months old (initially for convenience for nighttime feeding, then continued until we moved to a place where she had her own room).  It was so hard for me to let her sleep alone, but both of us slept so much better.  Your daughter is going to be starting preschool/kindergarten soon, and should have healthy sleeping patterns to be ready to learn. Setting bedtime routines are very important and pay off so much in many areas. If nothing else, setting boundaries is a healthy and necessary part of parenting. You and your wife need to get on the same page, though. Best of luck."
relationship_advice,fgt2w2q,t3_f0db7j,1581097912.0,"Sounds like she's either not putting the cup in correctly or she has an especially heavy flow.  When I first started using cups, it took some practice to insert it correctly, and it would sometimes overflow because it wasn't put in right. See if she can add an overnight pad when she sleeps."

relationship_advice,fgrs2nv,t3_f0612k,1581055588.0,"I can definitely relate to having mood swings that make you want to lash out at people. What has helped me is to work on being aware of when I'm feeling stressed so I can make an extra effort to watch my words. It's also helped to tell them at the start of the conversation that you're feeling a bit stressed and will try to not speak harshly. (preemptively apologizing works for me as speaking it out loud makes me more aware of how I speak and I usually don't end up needing to apologise). 

It's also helped to work with a friend on giving you a signal for when you're starting to be rude. Discuss when you're calm (of course) and decide on a phrase or action to remind you to snap out of it. 

But the best advice I can give you is to seek out help to work through the trauma of an abusive relationship. Therapists are a good but expensive option. However, there are many support groups that should be free where you can process the experience with others who can really understand what you went through."

If you want to reign in your fantasies, yes you should quit. Porn addiction is like any addiction in that it can start off seemingly very innocent but can escalate if you aren't careful."
CasualConversation,fgqbvpl,t1_fgqaxrd,1581021422.0,It definitely depends on the person. It also depends on the phone. You don't need a smartphone for emergencies or texts from work.

relationship_advice,fgq1noz,t3_ezwwzi,1581016176.0,"My husband and I were long distance the first year we dated. It was hard, but we are fortunate to live in a time of video chatting. We would talk every night to catch up, sometimes video and sometimes just a call. Texted throughout the day (not a lot because we were both working, but just little notes of encouragement and affection). We also visited each other as often as we could. I was in California and he was in Missouri, so visits we're about every other month. It's hard, but very doable."
CasualConversation,fgp6jet,t3_ezrwrd,1580998105.0,"Tea. Get some now. When you have your cup, breathe it in for a while before you drink. Drink it slowly, but drink it all before it gets cold. 

Take your breaks somewhere where you can be alone and not have to talk to anyone and rest. 

It's okay to move slowly, just try to keep moving when you need to. 

Hope you feel better soon."
relationship_advice,fgolt9v,t3_ezorvx,1580975093.0,"Waiting is hard, but it looks like that's what you need to be doing right now. The best advice I can give you is to try not to focus too much on it. I know a lot of your friends are probably getting engaged and married right now, but their timing is not yours.  When you do feel the need to focus on the future, try to channel it into what you can do now to make a better future (graduate school with contacts in your field, get a good job, save up for a house, etc). Best of luck."

relationship_advice,fgnumsy,t3_ezkjx5,1580953266.0,"Being serious typically means you are thinking the relationship will last long enough to make plans for your future together.  If you've been together for 2 years and he doesn't think you're serious enough to go meet your parents, you should take him at his word. Dump his ass and find a good man."

CasualConversation,fgnol80,t3_ezjgbs,1580949456.0,"This sucks.  I'm sorry. When I've been in this situation, (as a teacher) I try to go over what options they have: use words, tell a teacher, walk away, etc. I'm assuming you've talked with the teacher as well as the other kid's parents?  If not, please do so. Most parents don't want their kid to be a bullying asshole (unless they are also a bullying asshole). I've had success with time play where you act out a bad situation with two toys. It helps them experiment with what to say/how to react. Good luck."

relationship_advice,fgnac6a,t3_ezhg16,1580940716.0,"Chances are, you won't find any one person who is all of this. Sorry. 

I'm a romantic at heart, but this is a lot of hope and expectation to put in a person who will undoubtedly fail at some point. Good news is that you can definitely find someone who feels like a missing part of the puzzle that you didn't even realize was missing. They will probably look and act very different from what you are imagining, but if you keep your eyes and heart open you may well find them. Happy searching."
relationship_advice,fgmu7hd,t3_ezeoxv,1580932144.0,"This sounds like a ""him"" problem. You got along well and for awhile you felt attracted to him. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Unless you participated in having an emotional affair by flirting through words or ""innocent"" touches, I think you can absolve yourself from guilt. He's doing the right thing in cutting off contact with you because he can't control his thoughts, but it sounds like you did nothing wrong."
relationship_advice,fgmrg8k,t1_fgmhenc,1580930543.0,"Being lonely is hard. Trust me, I understand. What helped me was to stop fixating on it. Yeah, it's nice to have a partner, but I'd rather be single than in a bad relationship. Meanwhile, there are so many opportunities for non-romantic relationships to fill the void. Companionship is what's important. 

As to your original question, don't worry about what people may think about you not dating. If they're going to judge you, they're probably superficial idiots that you're better off not being around. I hope you find good companionship soon."
relationship_advice,fgmfyts,t3_ezctx3,1580923757.0,"Never having been in a relationship before is not in itself a red flag. Your attitude towards it can make it one, however. If you're a nice guy who just hasn't found a good fit yet, there's no problem. If it's lured you to incel logic where you blame women for not dating you, then it's a red flag. I was in the same boat where I'd never been on a second date because I had high standards and didn't care if that meant I was single longer. My husband is the only one I've been serious with, and it's worked out well for us."

relationship_advice,fgizkxv,t3_eys3xe,1580834145.0,"I'm sorry you're in a hard situation. In other comments you said going home would be difficult and getting a work visa is not an option. You said school is also not going well because of the recent stress. Marrying him is not an option either. I'm not sure which countries you're referring to as home and current, but would you be able to apply for another country?  Start looking for jobs abroad that you are qualified for. I can tell you aren't a native English speaker, but you are fluent enough and you might be able to get a job as an English teacher. Asia is always hiring. Even though they prefer native speakers you might be able to find something in a rural area."
