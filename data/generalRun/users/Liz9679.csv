NM I googled it:  From her RHOBH Bio,  Marisa is old friends with Kyle. The two first met when Marisa joined Hilton and Hyland real estate agency, where Kyle’s husband Mauricio used to work, and Marisa still does. Marisa is married to movie producer Dean Zanuck, who produced the feature films *Road to Perdition* starring Tom Hanks and *Get Low*, starring Robert Duvall, Sissy Spaceck and Bill Murray. Dean is part of Hollywood royalty. His father was Richard Zanuck, Oscar winning producer of *Driving Miss Daisy,* who also produced *Jaws*, *Cocoon*, and more recently, *Sweeny Todd*, *Alice in Wonderland* and *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*, all starring Johnny Depp. Dean’s grandfather was Darryl Zanuck, who was one of the founders of the studio we now know as Twentieth Century-Fox and was the winner of 3 Academy Awards. Marisa and Dean live in Beverly Hills and have two children together, son Jack (10) and daughter Darryl (7)."
