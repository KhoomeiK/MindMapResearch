MMA,ffk2s5i,t3_eu1j4l,1580014036.0,"Kudos of Blaydes. JDS did better than I thought he would stuffing the takedown, so good in fact that Blaydes didn’t even get 1. And Blaydes still got it done, Damnnn."
politics,ffjmb6k,t3_etwqwb,1580001541.0,"Honestly I think Donald Trump was right, he could shoot someone in the middle of the street and get away with it. For whatever reason, when Bill Clinton got a blowjob, that was enough to have the public outraged, today, no matter how much negative press Donald Trump gets, people just accept it."
AskReddit,ffibgh3,t1_ffhmkyc,1579969889.0,What about reloading punches? Asking for a friend.
MMA,ffgyr70,t1_ffgc2fp,1579918520.0,How about this fun fact. This is Cruz second time coming back after a 3 year long lay off. The first time he starched Mizugaki in 1 minute.

AskReddit,ffdjv6x,t3_esps5n,1579822419.0,That’s what I hate about extacy. I realize I’ll probably never feel as good as when I did trying extacy for the first time.
MMA,ffdikag,t3_ese965,1579821620.0,I think the Gaethje fight is the safest fight and the fight he should take next. Masvidal is without doubt the fight that would do the biggest ppv numbers other than Conor vs Khabib but since Khabib is fighting Ferguson and will be out until after Ramadan he should fight Gaethje. It keeps Conor busy and there’s less risk or Conor getting KO’d which could potentially set him back for the Khabib rematch.

worldnews,ffczk8q,t3_esta6e,1579810489.0,Greta has the confidence to stand centre stage and fight for what’s right despite all the criticism. That’s worth more than any degree.
