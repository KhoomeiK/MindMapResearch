That was an foreseeable accident and could have been avoided pretty easy.

Edit: I still feel sorry for your beard, may he rest in peace."
assholedesign,ffkr9tb,t1_ffiwk7e,1580027490.0,"Could go wrong, depending on the law where you life.

In Germany kids who are under 7 years old are not able to buy anything on their own.
But they are allowed to be a messenger for an adult person who wants to buy something. For example: Timmy (6) wants to buy chocolate with his money. That's not possible the ""contract"" would be void. But when Dad says to Timmy ""go and buy me some chocolate with this money"" he is allowed to do so and the contract is effective.
I could imagine that this would work with opening this seal too."

Wellthatsucks,ffknfuw,t3_etz7i6,1580025643.0,It's telling you that you have your own fortune in your hand and that you don't need any crappy advice from a cookie. You already rocking it!

SuicideWatch,fffr8ci,t1_fffq9y5,1579890050.0,"Not really. Internship is called Praktikum here. The law behind it is different. But I guess it is similar to an American internship, yes.
Would be a bit lot to explain everything and I believe that my English knowledge wouldn't be enough to explain it exactly.

When I dare to say something rude to them, especially if others can hear, I can loose my job.
Everybody would be ready to be a witness against me but nobody would be a witness for me.
So I'm really in a bad position here.

Edit: I want to add that my employee is normally very strict with rude behavior under their ""Azubis"" (Auszubildender, that's how you call a person that is in an ""internship"") but they need proof."
trashy,fffqpxo,t1_fffmj3g,1579889738.0,Can't be. You didn't even knew was vegan is when you were born. So how could you have already chose a special diet for yourself?

SuicideWatch,fffhmxk,t1_fffhaud,1579884159.0,"No. Because I mentioned a teacher?

I'm in a job training. I'm employed by a company who teaches me everything I need to know to work in this field.

I'm actually already working there but for the three next years I have to visit a school from time to time to learn the theory behind it. My employee teaches me the practical knowledge. It's called Ausbildung."
SuicideWatch,fffh7ch,t1_fffg9tk,1579883887.0,"When I was sick and someone said that I am sick someone else said ""oh thanks God she is not coming today"" and everybody laughed. (someone told me, I can trust this person as she gets bullied too and we are telling each other what they are saying about us)

Or another situation where a girl said that I'm stupid and the whole class laughed.

They also call me Martina because they know I do not like it when someone calls me by that name.
Because I mentioned it to a teacher who always calls me Martina instead of my real name (they are similar)

Edit: I really feel like I am the asshole here.
""when everybody you meet is an asshole, you are the asshole.""
Must be true then I guess."
SuicideWatch,fffgext,t1_fffdsu7,1579883397.0,"I don't think that this will help.
I have no proof (it's a he said, she said situation) and what they say isn't that awful that they would fire them anyway. So all that would happen is that they would have a ""talking to"" which makes it even worse, based on my experience."

OopsDidntMeanTo,ffefqs7,t3_et3pjg,1579846286.0,"Toxic community. At least this one dude.

I like my douchebags who are always saying ""good game"" after a match even when you got your ass whooped. It's about the fun, not about tearing each other down. At least give some helpful advice instead of just being an ass."
NeckbeardNests,ffefltu,t1_ffebxjc,1579846141.0,"That's called Parkinsons law.
A task will always take exactly the time you take to get it done.
Because when you set a timer you work with a bit of positive stress so you are faster. When you have endless time you are more chill so you will take up more time.

Sorry just wanted to chare some recently learned useless knowledge"
gatekeeping,ffc7xll,t1_ffbtcig,1579793597.0,"Sorry, English ist not my first language. I tried to look up the words ""cubed"", ""ground"" and ""pulped"" but the translation doesn't work with the context. So I'm not sure what it actually means. Would you mind to describe it?"

wholesomememes,ffbdsh8,t1_ffa8jli,1579761044.0,"Same here.
I only do it for like a few month now but it gets better everyday.
But it also comes from the fact that I left a toxic sorrounding and have a better perspective now. Got a job and currently paying my debt step by step. There is always a light at the end of the tunnel, it's just hard to see while you are in the tunnel."
ATBGE,ffb7kcl,t1_ff9a5nl,1579754024.0,"No I'm not above the people on the spectrum. It's just rude to assume that someone is on the spectrum just because you do not get along well with him or her. (I'm a girl BTW)
Also that's just not your cup of tea, do you want a stranger to ask you about your health? I don't believe so.

And could you pls stop trying to diagnose me with autism? Reading some symptoms doesn't make you capable of diagnosing somebody over the internet with something complex like autism. It's rude and disrespectful. And I know for sure that I don't have autism. Why is not your beer so fuck off."
gatekeeping,ffb77kf,t1_ffa79mw,1579753669.0,"Nah. I'm sure that I heard a couple songs of them but only while my father was driving me somewhere as a kid.

ATBGE,ff99czz,t1_ff91oj4,1579707840.0,"No. And I find it rude to ask that.

I just tend to take everything seriously, not because of autism, I'm just like that.

Sorry that I bothered you."
blursedimages,ff9904i,t1_ff96z4g,1579707612.0,"Wait I'm confused.
Sleeves are the things where I put my arm in, to wear a pullover, right?
So I'm assuming you talking about that it would be a better picture, if the children would wear something that covers the shoulders, at least.
Why? No really, why would it be better?"
trashy,ff8tn2j,t3_es98t8,1579695652.0,Just imagine being that racist that you would rather die than getting touched by a black person. What a cunt.
