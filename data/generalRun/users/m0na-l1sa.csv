sydney,ff2davp,t3_er5nix,1579501518.0,Apply to agencies that manage temps. They can advise you on your resume and many companies hire through agencies rather than direct.

ADHD,fe65o4x,t3_enx7fm,1578882353.0,I know the feeling of just turning off the alarms and not doing what they arr reminding you to do. There are medicine-specific apps that will alert a friend/relative if you don‚Äôt take the meds on time. Or switch up the alarm sounds so you have to read the alarm description. You can do it!

sydney,fbzz3yf,t3_efdnnq,1577269668.0,"We opened our gifts around 9. I got some books and some other trinkets. Have already started on the new Jack Reacher book. We followed that with pancakes and fresh fruit. We lazed about and prepped a late lunch which we ate at 3. A pork roast and a beef roast with roast vegetables. The beef roast had a rub of mustard, fig balsamic and anchovy which was delicious. My husband made the roasts while I prepared the veg. He also made a reduction of beetroot juice from a jar of baby beets which was a revelation. And onions in that fig balsamic. An hour later we had an Aldi Christmas pudding with custard. Dinner was just toasted sourdough a short while back. There is a banana bread in the oven for tomorrow and I am back to reading. Overall a splendid relaxed day."
