They work a lot like components in frameworks like Vue, React, Angular, but they are native to the browser and so are faster / more interoperable.  For instance, you can use a Web Component in any other framework, but not the other way around.

They have been slow to adopt by major browsers.  Well that's not even true, Chrome and Firefox have been strong with them for a while, and now Edge is too.  IE is the only one that doesn't support them.  But that's not even an issue, because you can use a *polyfill* to support IE anyway, and anyway its market share is bottoming out."

WebComponents are way worth it. They simplify so many levels of development that we've collectively learned antipatterns to overcome.  So it looks like there's not much benefit, but really you don't see the pile of work that's been built up to support building older stuff.

Most people love SASS, for instance.  Not really that useful with WebComponents.  Before you're trying to manage super complex CSS setups, now it's pretty damned simple.  I mean, people still use SASS, but the benefits are much less.

WebComponents add some complexity.  But they remove way more complexity that you've gotten used to.  You just have to get into a different mindset."

Making jokes about race, that mocks or derides those people for being that race, is an expression of racism.  The humor is derived from the expectation that they are inferior.

If you're making fun of stereotypes, which you might be, then that's all well and good as long as the people involved are actually involved.  But to do it in a public forum, especially at a time when racism is so blatant and open, then at best you are failing to read the room.  At worst, you are falling into the hands of those that are actually racist.
