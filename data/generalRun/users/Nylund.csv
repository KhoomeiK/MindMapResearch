It’s more than just that.

There is a Queen of Country A who has “powers” over the government of Country A.

And there is a Queen of Country B who has “powers” over the government of Country B. 

(In theory, everything these governments do requires the permission of their country’s Queen. In practice, both queens pretty much always say yes.)

The powers these queens have are pretty much identical in each of their respective countries.

These two countries are independent. The government of Country A has no say over the citizens of Country B, and the government Country B has no say over the citizens of Country A. 

Country A has the Queen of Country A on their money. 

Country B has the Queen of Country B on their money. 

They are entirely separate and independent countries with separate crowns.

It just gets confusing when for historical reasons, the same person wears both grounds. 

And in this case, not just A and B, but also C, D, E, F, G...and many others.

So for historical reasons, and because she lives in Country A, everyone just calls her “Queen of A.”

Country B does not (and would not) put someone else’s Queen on their money to honor that other Queen. They put *their own Queen* on their own money. 

She is very much just as much a “real” Queen as the Queen of B as she is a “real” Queen in Country A where she also happens to be Queen of A. 

That is, if the UK got rid of the monarchy, she would still be The Queen of Canada, and still be the Head of State in Canada, and still be on Canadian money since she’s the Queen of Canada separately and distinctly from her position as Queen of England.

This is a topic I tried to read up on a while back and I only ended up becoming more confused.  It comes up from time to time when the UK changes it’s rules of Succession. 

It seems like right now all the Commonwealth countries agree that they all must have the same succession rules to ensure that all will always share the same monarch. 

> The relationship between the Commonwealth realms is such that any change to the rules of succession to their respective crowns requires the unanimous consent of all the realms.

But other things I’ve read make it sound like it could be possible for that to change.

(I think there was some issue over this in Canada back when the succession rules still had some anti-Catholic rules.  I think there were some who argued that the Crowns were inherently indivisible.)

But if they are all the same now, wouldn’t it require Royal Assent for any of them to change it? It’d seem to me it could only be split  if the Monarch agrees to it. 

Where there does seem to be some differences is in the realm of regency. That’s about who acts as the monarch if the monarch is incapacitated, a child, or absent and someone else has to function as the Regent.  In that case, it seems like it could get a little odd and it’s less clear if whomever the UK chooses as Regent would also have regency powers in the other countries.  They’d all still have the same Monarch, but not so clear if they’re all still obliged to have the same regent. 

But I’m hardly an expert, just some dude who tried to read up on all this a few years back, cuz I thought it’d be funny if they broke apart all the crowns and were like, “ok, Andrew gets Canada, Charles gets the UK, Harry gets Bermuda...”"

nottheonion,fffax72,t1_ffelnpe,1579879933.0,"It’s not really a great analogy. The issue how would investors and the stock market react. That’s a game that involves reputation and sentiment.

Financial markets didn’t know who to trust. The banks rightly understood that taking money screams “we’re in trouble” and some banks felt they could weather it, and thought if they refuse, it’ll signal they’re not in trouble. 

The idea was if there existed some clear signal to differentiate who was fine and who was in trouble, investors would pull money out of the troubled ones and put it into the good ones.

Basically, they thought if they refused help and their competitor didn’t, everyone would pull money out of their competitor and give it to them. They’d get money. Just not from the govt. and in a way that would kill off their competitor. 

Plus, taking the govt money came with strings regarding bonuses, compensation, etc. and they didn’t want the govt having a say in how much of a bonus they gave themselves.  And these dudes are very self-centered. Their arrogance regarding their own strategy and their desire for big bonuses was overriding common sense. 

They thought they’d get money either way. But one way involves their competitor dying, and the other involves the competitor being saved *and* the government dictating rules to them regarding their compensation packages. The stronger banks genuinely preferred the former. 

They were likely wrong that they were fine. But these are cocky Wall St bastards who have no shortage of arrogance.

But the govt didn’t want *any* to go under for fear it’d set off a reaction where they *all* go under and the whole financial system collapses. 

Basically they said, “you think you’re fine, but you’re not, and your plan to try to get all your competitor’s money, clients, and investors by acting like your fine while they signal they’re in trouble, is gonna be the death of all of you. It’s a dumb plan, so we’re not going to let you even try it.”

And so the govt really did make everyone accept money to avoid allowing any bank the chance to signal “we’re good and our competitors are fucked, so take your money from them and give it to us.”  

And since that signal didn’t happen, that game didn’t happen and the collapse was contained (at least from the banks’ perspective). And because of that JP Morgan really was fine and went around saying, “see? We didn’t need it! Our plan would have worked!”

But if they’d gotten their way, and successfully refused, it could’ve gone very different. Their plan may have been disastrous for them. Weak ones failing could have created a domino effect that was larger than they thought, and probably would have doomed them too. 

Reality is kind of nuanced and involves comparing scenarios that actually happened to unknown scenarios that might have happened otherwise. It can be true that they genuinely didn’t want it, and that they “proved” they didn’t need it, while also being true that they probably did actually need it, were dumb for thinking they didn’t, and would have been royally screwed had they successfully refused it.

So it’s not a lie to say they didn’t want the money. They really didn’t. But it’s also probably not true to say they didn’t need it. They probably would have been fucked if they successfully refused.  But because a domino of failures didn’t happen, they can say, “see? We didn’t need it,” and there’s no real way to refute it since we can only speculate what might have otherwise happened.

And, probably an unpopular opinion here on Reddit, but as much as it sucked to bail out those bastards, it was probably the least bad option at the time.  The credit markets that many large companies rely on to make payroll and vendor payments may very well have been days away from collapse and the Fed’s mechanisms all function through the financial sector. there was no way to work around that fact in the tiny window of time before big dominos would start to fall. 

It sucks that we saved the monsters who cause it, but there probably weren’t better options during those specific days of early October, 2008.  The years before, and the years since? There’s plenty to get mad about. 

I guess one could argue that while the total and complete collapse of a the financial system would have been very bad, that something better could have arisen from the rubble eventually. But I kind of feel like that’s like suggesting we fix the NIMBY housing issues in SF by bombing the city.  Maybe that’s true in the long run!

One side is saying, “I’m basing my opinion on what I’ve experienced,” and another side is saying, “there’s a lot you don’t see, and you should base your opinion on that.”

The latter can be right and true, but I also get why a person would their opinion on their experiences. 

People tend to put more weight on their own first hand experiences more than they do on the experiences they *don’t* have.

opinions are always riddled with personal anecdotes because it’s those *personal experiences* that shape their views. It’s hard to get people to break out of that. It’s a very tricky thing to convince people to put *less weight* on the things they personally experience and *more weight* on things they haven’t, but are told by others are true, especially without sounding dismissive of those experiences people lived through. No one likes having *their personal life experiences* dismissed by others. 

People who have been treated badly by cops probably won’t like cops. Former cops telling them that the vast majority of cops are good probably won’t help. 

People raped at frat parties probably won’t like frats.  Former frat members telling them that the vast majority of fraternity members are good probably won’t help. 

That’s how people work. Now, those are organizations with memberships, so not great analogies. It’s not like the “good” homeless can kick a “bad apple” out of their groups.

Probably the best way to convince someone is to convince them to open themselves up to new experiences. Someone who has a bad experience with the homeless probably won’t change their mind unless they have new and different experiences. Convince them to volunteer at a shelter or work a soup kitchen. That may work. That may create a new set of experiences that may change their opinion on the larger group."
ABoringDystopia,ffavoxd,t1_ffa5arg,1579745575.0,"I think there is a way to square the circle of this disagreement. 

The estimates I’ve seen put the percentage of homeless people with severe mental illness in America somewhere around 25% (plus or minus about 5%, depending on the study).

That is disproportionately higher than the general population (by quite a bit), but also allows for the “vast majority” (75%) to *not* have a severe mental illness. 

Both statements can be true. 

So if you’re homeless and hanging out with other homeless, you probably know to avoid certain people and the “vast majority” are fine, and you probably learn which of the 25% that are severely mentally ill are harmless (which is probably most).

But if you’re regularly in a part of town with a high homeless population, that 25% is high enough that you’ll have some [encounters](https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/SF-Embarcadero-attack-Victim-testifies-man-14447376.php) that make you nervous. The 8 people you walk past without incident won’t really stick in you’re head,  but the two with severe mental illness will. 

For example, in my neighborhood there’s been a few instances recently where a homeless panhandler has been begging outside of storefronts and threatening to stab people with a used needle who refused to give him money. The people have all described him as pretty nuts.

The other day, a guy was panhandling in front of a store in the area where this has been happening and he asked me for money when I walked into the store. I had no cash, said “sorry, no cash,” and went inside. Happens all the time. It doesn’t really phase me. 

But as I was in there, he kept tapping on the window and pointing at me, making “crazy person” faces (for lack of a better term) and odd hand motions that I couldn’t interpret, but some looked a bit like stabbing motions. I started wondering to myself  “shit, is that the stabby needle guy?!” 

Purely in terms of probability, probably not. That’s what I told myself. But it wasn’t *unreasonable* to think it could be that guy. He seemed to be checking enough boxes that the probability wasn’t close enough to zero for me to *not* be wary. 

I mean, only 10 to 15% of smokers get lung cancer, so the “vast majority” don’t get lung cancer, but it’s still disproportionately higher than non-smokers by enough to give me pause.

Pointing being, it seems reasonable that a disproportionately high enough rate can be high enough to give one pause while it still being true that the “vast majority” are fine."
technology,ffa12aj,t1_ff9nj1t,1579725740.0,"My impression from reading that is that the best analogy would probably be things like the state mandated energy efficiency and low-income bill payment assistance programs operated by investor owned utilities and overseen by Public Utility Commissions. 

Maybe I’m incorrect in assuming just because states like [Massachusetts ](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/massachusetts-approves-eversource-rate-increase-to-help-boost-ev-storage-i/512261/) , [Vermont](https://puc.vermont.gov/energy-efficiency-utility-program/energy-efficiency-charge-rates)  and California recover costs of those programs via rate increases to customers that this would operate in the same way.  That’s just what strikes me as most likely for the parts of the plan regarding service changes and access expansion.   

When the govt mandates companies fund certain initiatives to benefit society, it must also provide for a cost recovery mechanism and some rate of return on those funding those investments. You can read [here](https://aceee.org/incentivizing-utility-led-efficiency-programs-program-cost-recovery-0) about methods used in the world of state mandated energy efficiency programs. 

For low-income subsidies, it tends to be a mix of federal funds (via the Low Income Heating and Assistance Program) and ratepayer finds (Aka, costs passed onto consumers).  It differs dramatically by state. 

But I very well could be wrong for how it would be implemented or funded. If you’re well-versed in the workings of Public Utility Commissions and the regulatory workings of Investor Owned Utilities, I genuinely ask you to share any insights from that world.

And surely there’s got to be some ACEEE people on this thread, or people who work on rate cases with the CA PUC, MA’s DPU, etc. etc."
technology,ff9nqxu,t1_ff976uv,1579716841.0,"It sounds like the intention is to treat them like how we treat investor owned utility  (IOU) companies. 

 IOUs are often required to to have service guarantees, subsidies for low-income groups, and energy-saving initiatives. That’s probably the best analogies for what I see in this plan.

How the costs are paid for is called a “cost recovery mechanism.”

There are numerous methods.

One is to treat it like any other cost and have it factored into the rate charged to the consumer.

The other is to add a line-item charge to the utility bill. They usually give them names like Public Service Charge, Social Benefit Charge, System Benefit Charge, Public Purpose Surcharge, etc.

But, if it’s going to function like how we treat public utilities, the short answer is the costs get passed on to the customers."
technology,ff9kdys,t3_escmro,1579714857.0,"My opinion based on years working with publicly regulated utilities:  this will likely internet more expensive for most people.

The way public utilities work is that they are private companies who have the terms of their services and their prices approved by governments. 

To ensure a public company remains in business, the government sets prices in a way that guarantees a certain level of profits (e.g., 3%).

The gov’t will list the requirement of services. The company says how much that will cost. Then prices are set to cover those costs plus a small profit margin.

I see a lot of things in here which will raises costs. Subsidies for low income, removal of data and speed caps, service expansions, etc.

These costs will be recovered by prices charged to customers, or more specifically in the case of subsidies for low-income households, costs will be recovered by rate increases to the non-low-income customers.   The threshold for utilities is often like 150 to 200% of the federal poverty line (but is sometimes also based on things like the local area’s median income). 

Basically, non-low-income group pay for the low income group. The issue is that “non-low-income” generally see costs go up, and this group isn’t just well-to-do people, but also the working class who are not poor enough to be considered “poor.”

For example, a recent project I worked on raised subsidies for people earning less than $10k a year, and was paid for by increases in charges to people making more than $25k a year. 

With utilities, it varies by state, but if you look at your bill, it may have this charge itemized, often with a description like “Social Benefit Charge (SBC)”.

Basically, the line between the “have-nots” who benefit and and the “haves” who pay for those benefits tends to be a lot lower than people think. 

To give lots of benefits to the worst off without drastic increases to others, you tend to need a pretty strict definition of low-income. 

Another common side effect is that because of this, the govt (and consumer advocate groups) tend to limit company spending on innovation (or even sometimes just maintenance) as a means of cost control (because they realize many of the “haves” don’t actually have that much, and don’t want to force the higher prices on them). 

For example, it’s really common for utility companies to have customer information and billing systems that are 20-30 years old from the days of Windows 95 because regulators don’t want to pass on the costs of upgrades to customers because of they’re already passing on costs of things the govt has deemed more important, like subsidies for those under the poverty line. 

I’m not trying to poo-poo the idea. Rather, people should realize that there are trade-offs. 

My best guess is that this would be good for households in rural areas and households who are currently eligible for programs like TANF, SNAP, etc., but will likely mean higher prices for everyone else, and may hinder future upgrades and maintenance to current systems and networks."

There, one or two drinks were totally considered completely fine. Definitely under the legal limit. You’re golden. 

Unfortunately, people always had a way to convince themselves that they were at the equivalent of just a drink or two whenever it came time to drive.

Everyone suddenly became an expert on how much alcohol was in every drink, what that meant for your weight, and how much of it has already been processed by the liver. People had shit like [this chart](https://alcohol.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj10421/f/bacs_copy.jpg) memorizes for their weight (and some actually kept things like this in their wallet).

They over estimated time, underestimated how many drinks they’d had or the amount of alcohol in each drink.

1955 is a handy year because, give or take a few bucks, you can multiply by 10 to adjust for inflation.

So that $27  power drill is about $270 in today’s money. 

Minimum wage was 75 cents an hour in 1955.  Accounting for both income and sales tax, it’d probably take over 40 hours of minimum wage work to buy that power drill. 

Here’s a Speedway [ad](https://i.pinimg.com/1200x/bd/1c/c1/bd1cc12246acec22c63108c03b342298.jpg) from a similar era.  Not sure if exact year, so I can’t adjust for price exactly, but it’s probably about $200 for the “cheap” drill and $400 for the higher end one in today’s money. 

Same story.

I’d wager that if Craftsman switched to a strategy of making “built to last” power tools line where $200 got you the “cheap” model and $400 got you the “good” model, they’d struggle. Some pros may buy them, but your average suburban Dad who just wants a drill in the garage for the occasional task probably would still opt for your typical $70-150 Home Depot drill.

Or, to make another point:

I think the average American owns like 20 pairs of shoes.  For that money, you could have two to three “built to last” pairs like your great-grandparent.

(Oh God...someone is gonna reply with that Pratchett/Vimes quote about boots, aren’t they?)

Perhaps things like housing, education, and healthcare have gotten more expensive people don’t *have* the disposable income to spend that much on a drill anymore. Maybe some larger economic forces are driving us to buy “cheap” stuff.

But I genuinely think a lot of people would prefer to have a walk in closet of cheap shit from H&M or Uniqlo than a small number of better made items. 

And I think people prefer their $70 power drill, with all its cheap plastic parts. They don’t want to spend 40 hours worth of salary on a power drill."

worldnews,feortw5,t1_feo5d4d,1579304547.0,"Ok, here:

> Finnish mental health legislation takes a medical approach to compulsory measures, emphasising the need for treatment of psychiatric patients over civil liberties concerns. Consequently no non-medical professionals are involved in the decision of involuntary admission - although a court has to reinforce the decision at a later time - and no distinction is made in legislation between admission and treatment. On the other hand, diagnostic criteria for detention are strict, thereby assuring that only patients with severe illness are subjected to coercive measures, which are needed for their well-being. Finland has the highest rates of detention per 100 000 inhabi- tants, about 214 compared with 93 in the UK and 11 in Italy (Salize et al, 2002; Zinkler & Priebe, 2002). A high percentage of compulsory admission relative to all psychiatric admissions (21.6%) has also been described by Salize et al (2002). 

So 214 per 100k in Finland vs 11 per 100k in Italy. Of that, 20 percent are involuntary.  So that’s 40 per 100k that are involuntary.  That means the *involuntary* rates are 4 times Italy’s total rates. 

And it’s worth noting:

> no non-medical professionals are involved in the decision of involuntary admission

Compare that to the [US](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_treatment#United_States) and all the details about courts, judges, legal burden of proof requirements, etc.

It’s very much the case that Finland has a much larger percentage of its population in mental institutes and that the percentage of these that are involuntary are also high (and done with relative ease) compares to other western countries. 

And if these same rates existed in the US, it would amount to hundreds of thousands of people being institutionalized and many tens of thousands being there involuntarily, and without involving courts, judges, lawyers, and burdens of proof as is typical in the US.  

And I do believe that dealing with the mentally ill in such a manner probably makes it easier to deal with issues like homelessness."
worldnews,feokahd,t1_feo5d4d,1579301383.0,"And again, I’m not disparaging Finland. It’s more a comment about the US. For example, [In Philadelphia ](https://www.inquirer.com/news/maurice-louis-mental-health-mercy-fitzgerald-west-philadelphia-shooting-20191109.html)  there was recently a situation exactly like you describe, family members noticing someone in the family was having mental issues and was a danger to themself or their family.  They were sent home and the person later murdered his family. 

In Finland, that person would probably could have been involuntarily committed. But in the US, the rules protecting personal freedom are stronger. The evidence for imminent threat has to be much stronger, and in some places may require a court order.  

I’m not saying Finland does anything unreasonable. (Although their stated goal to lessen their rates of institutionalization suggest maybe Finland thinks it does).

I’m actually critiquing the US and how inadequate it’s current mental health system is.

I’m also making the point that one consequence of this is that America’s homeless problem overlaps with its untreated  mental health crisis. As a result our homeless population is different and requires different set of solutions. 

I was being a bit flippant about Finland’s institutionalization rates.  sorry if that upset you.  I didn’t mean it as a slight in Finland. It was more about how deinstitutionalization is all the rage in Europe and my suspicions that they’re underestimating the ways those high rates of institutionalization make some of their other social goals and policies easier to implement. 

I do believe that adding an additional 150k plus capacity to America’s mental health institutions (bringing it up to the *equivalent* of Finland’s rates), easing involuntarily institutionalization rules, and expanding community-based outpatient services would *probably* make a dent in the 600k homeless population in the US, while also making our homelessness problem one that could be dealt with through policies that are more economic and financial in focus. 

And likewise, I think if Finland were to lower their institutionalization rates to something on par with the US, they’d probably find that some of their other policies (like the one in question here) may become less effective."

transit,fe6ocx2,t3_el01z4,1578898028.0,"It sounds a bit like my year in Dallas using the bus. I’d previously done a mix of driving and biking (depending on weather) but an accident and surgery meant I couldn’t bike or drive.  (For the 10 years prior I’d lived carless in other cities with good public transit.)

It turned out there was a bus route that went pretty much straight from my front door to across the street from my work. Awesome!

Buses were infrequent. They also were often late, or blew past stops.  If no bus came, or I was running a few minutes behind, my eta at work or home could change by an hour.  

Bus was very bouncy. Not a smooth ride at all. 

Standing outside waiting for the bus in 100+ heat wasn’t fun.

It was much slower than driving or biking since the route was a bit circuitous and since it also stopped and waited at the light rail station (DART) for a bit.

If the bus was really messed up that day, my backup plan was DART. That involved fairly long walks on both ends, which was rough in the Texas summers. 

Once I was healed up, I went back to driving and bicycling. 

The best part was my route was dominated by cleaning ladies and they gossiped a lot and talked shit about all the rich people they worked for and I loved chatting with them and hearing their stories."
todayilearned,fe6mkj4,t1_fdou2am,1578896044.0,"For the most part, those streetcar systems converted to bus-based systems.  Pick a city, look at its old street car maps, and compare it to the modern bus route map, and often times the buses are still running the same routes (plus new ones.)

And the streetcars shares the road with cars, just like buses, so, just like the buses that replaced them, they couldn’t avoid traffic either. But back then, the reaction wasn’t that cars were in the way of trolleys, but that the slow trolleys were in the way of cars. 

Also, In many cities they’d been built in the center lanes and thus often meant walking across a lane of moving traffic to get between the curb and the trolley. 

If you watch this [movie](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=duZDzQTZ1vQ) about SF in 1940 and skip to about 1:53, look for the women in hats getting off the streetcar to see what I mean.  Or [this one](https://youtu.be/xfSq2HMhB-w)  Milwaukee. Go to 3:30 and watch how the woman has to walk in front of an oncoming car to board.  I think the footage helps clarify the appeal of curbside bus boarding people had at the time. (If you keep watching that Milwaukee one, it also includes some footage of the buses)

Main historical takeaway, if we ever redo it, we need dedicated right-of-ways and better boarding and de-boarding that they had back then.

School assignments are a test of personal knowledge. If you leave things blank, you’ll get marked down. No biggie. 

In the real world tasks aren’t tests. They serve real functions and purposes. They are things that need to be completed. If you’re struggling, ask for help. But make sure things get finished. “I ran out of time” or “I didn’t know how to do it,” may apply to exams, but not to jobs. Shit has to actually get 100 percent finished. 

Similarly, if a boss asks for a “first draft,” what they want is something more akin to what a student would call a final draft.

If there are any “history of transit” nerds out there, I think the Public Service Corporation of New Jersey is a nice case study.

The Public Service family included the Public Service Gas and Electric Company (PSEG, which still exists), Public Service Railway (the old trolley line) and Public Service Transportation (the bus lines) which started in 1917.  These latter two falling under Public Service Coordinated Transport, which eventually came under government control when bought by NJ Transit. 

It’s a good example of how power and transportation used to be quite linked, the financial dynamics of bus vs rail, and the transition of private transportation companies to state run transit systems.

Another fun one is LA and [Henry E. Huntington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_E._Huntington), namesake of Huntington Beach in Southern California. He owned the [LA streetcar system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Railway)  and [electric railway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Electric). He was also [major player ](https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/lw2707.htm) in the electricity game (his company would become part of The modern day electric company, SCE). 

It’s a great example of how real estate, electric rail, and electric generation were all intertwined.  There’s also quite a few interesting tales regarding labor unions and immigrant labor in that history, but that’s a story for a different day. (Basically, dude hated unions and there were many union [strikes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919_Streetcar_Strike_of_Los_Angeles)  and riots, including ones where they flipped streetcars.)

I moved to Philly so now I’m learning about the [history](https://hsp.org/blogs/fondly-pennsylvania/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-philadelphia-rapid-transit-company)  of their streetcar system.  They also had their share of riots and strikes (including one when the streetcar company [hired black workers)](https://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/streetcars/) to skilled positions in 1944, and FDR had to send in the military to end the strike. 

What’s sort of interesting in Philly is that unlike Los Angeles, GM/Firestone/Big Oil continued running streetcars after they purchased the system.  The last bit of “push to bus-based system” happened later after the govt (SEPTA) was in charge. The previous link talks a bit about the depot fire that destroyed dozens of streetcars and the role that played in the ending of some of the old surface street car lines. It remains a city of multiple systems stitched together where there’s still issues involving [transferring ](https://www.inquirer.com/news/septa-philadelphia-transfer-fees-bus-subway-trolley-ridership-20190702.html) from one to the other. 

It’s also funny there as there’s still old unused tracks on some streets and as long as they remain, SEPTA is still under those old streetcar rules that make it responsible for paving the road between the tracks and on 18 inches on each side. But were they able to afford to rip them out and repave, all future maintenance costs would fall onto the Dept. of Transportation. Funny how nearly half a century after the end of those lines, road maintenance is still dictated by those old regulations. 

A point I like to make about NYC: We all think of the bus/subway system there as the MTA, and I really like reading about the pre-MTA days when on the subway front there was the [BMT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn%E2%80%93Manhattan_Transit_Corporation) (and its predecessors the Brooklyn City Railroad and Brooklyn Rapid Transit), [IRT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interborough_Rapid_Transit_Company), and [IND](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Subway_System) (I think many know about them. Signs still exist and the different rail widths still exist with different cars for different lines). But there were so many other transit companies as well. There was the [Second Ave Railroad Corp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Avenue_Railroad), [New York Railways Corp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Avenue_Railroad), the [The Ave B and Broadway Transit Company](https://metro.fandom.com/wiki/Avenue_B_%26_East_Broadway_Transit_Company) which was one of the bus companies to take over a failed street car line (the Drydock, East Broadway, and Battery Railroad company).  There was the [Manhattan Bridge Three scent Line](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Bridge_Three_Cent_Line). The list goes on and on! And I think understanding the dynamics of those private companies, their bankruptcies, mergers and acquisitions, and bus conversions is crucial to understanding how and why streetcar systems were dismantled across the country (especially during the Great Depression).

Point being, I think the *real* history is fascinating and educational and it makes me sad (and annoyed) when I see comments on Reddit where people act like “Who Framed Roger Rabbit” was a documentary.

It’s so commonly reduced to “we once had great systems in every city until GM destroyed them all,” but the reality is much more complex, where the lines between good guys and bad guys gets a lot more gray with race riots, union busting, government kickbacks and corruption. 

And reasons why can get boggled down in unsexy details like the way capital depreciation rates play a role in the fare-setting mechanisms of private corporations under the regulatory authority of Public Utility commissions and how something like unexpected inflation and deflation can reek havoc on the appropriateness of those fares as well as and the wages that were previously locked in by collective bargaining agreements with the unions. 

It’s so much easier to blame GM. It’s a nice and simple story with a clear bad guy.  But I consider it a great disservice to perpetuate the simple myth. There’s a lot we can learn from history and it’s best not to forget what actually happened.

EDIT:

It’s also a bit interesting to me that the romanticized systems of the past were almost all private companies (albeit heavily regulated) whereas the modern ones people complain about are government run.

But when I read comments, it seems like many are under the impression that those old systems were government-run public transit, and it was private companies that ruined them, when the reality is more complex. 

Or others seems to think those old systems were beloved, when in reality many of the companies that ran them were quite hated by the public and viewed with the same distrust as the Robber Barrens. They were viewed as evil corporate monopolies empowered by corrupt governments. 

This [article](https://offbeatoregon.com/1601b.jitneys-vs-streetcars.273.html)  on the Jitney Craze touches on that sentiment. 

Here’s [an article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.stltoday.com/news/local/illinois/look-back-bloody-streetcar-strike-in-wins-working-class-support/article_ca886618-1f12-5be6-bb04-aff64fa1130d.amp.html) about a streetcar riot in St Louis. 

And here’s a [cartoon](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EIx9NmkXsAEAJP6.jpg) that depicts how some felt about the way these energy and streetcar companies were coming to control cities.

Were these private systems the Golden Days? Were they evil companies? Was the government good by regulating fares and forcing routes on companies despite them being unprofitable? Or is that what did them in? Were these sensical natural monopolies that rightly deserved govt protection or was the govt protecting them from new and innovative competitors offering better service? Did things get better or worse when government took them over?

The answers to these are complex and don’t always fit neatly into the political ideologies of today.  That’s another thing that makes the myth so appealing.  It fits the narrative. 

As long as evil GM is the story, people talk about how GM ruined the great trolley system of LA, They don’t have to think much about how that sides them with the union-hating Robber Barren railroad magnate that owned the privately-owned electric rail monopoly they now romanticize.  They don’t have to think about how it was a scheme to increase the value of his land-holdings or the way his family dumped it on GM and Firestone once the land was sold and it became a money-losing burden for them and their 1% way of life."

If that article is a pain, [Vox has a decent article on it. ](https://www.vox.com/2015/5/7/8562007/streetcar-history-demise) 

The reality is street cars fell out of the public’s favor. They were slow, noisy, and considered old fashioned.  And the tracks and electric substations they required made them expensive systems to built, expand, and maintain.

Also many people don’t realize these were run by private corporations and weren’t public transit agencies like we have now. And in many cities they weren’t built just to be transportation systems. It was often a three-piece scheme. Buy up cheap land, build electric power stations. Build electric rails connecting cheap land to city center. Sell land for profit. Sell electricity to purchasers of land. (The history of electric companies is often tied to trolley companies, which were often owned by the same company, and both were regulated by the same Public Utility commission.)

Sometimes trolley companies were even run at a loss, as it was the real estate sales that made the real money. But once the land was sold and there was no more land money to make, the transit systems often became a burden to the corporate owners.

As crazy as it sounds to modern ears, buses, when they came on the scene, were considered the new cool, cheaper, faster, more comfortable, and more flexible.  You weren’t limited by tracks, didn’t have to build electric generation systems, etc. And you could get on them at the curb instead of having to go to the middle of the street (like streetcars), which in the days before street lights where common place, was something people liked. 

The first time was the Jitney Bus craze of 1914/15, (most of the links in this comment talk about it.) Streetcar companies pretty much lobbied those out of existence, but by the 30s, newer more advanced buses started showing up. 

The rich residents of Fifth Ave in NYC forbid streetcars and demanded buses. Mayor LaGuardia campaigned on modernizing transit by replacing trolleys with buses. [nice brief article on NYC’s switch to buses](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/dead-sailing-ships-goodbye-trolleys-1936-article-1.2903124) 

This article about the [Oakland Trolley system](http://www.oaklandhistorymurals.com/oaklands-electric-street-cars.html) has a really nice write up that capture this general dynamic. 

All over, street car companies were going bankrupt. 

The real GM/Firestone/US oil conspiracy was that they tried to monopolize this switch to buses. They wanted to make sure these new bus-base transit systems would be using *thier* buses and *their* tires, and running on *their* fuel. So they went around and bought up the bankrupt street car systems to convert them to bus based systems. But the switch to buses was already happening everywhere, across the world (eg, London replaces their trolleys with those famous double decker red buses), and would have happened regardless. 

This got twisted in the 70s by some anti-car people, and movies like Who Framed Roger Rabbit cemented the twisted version in people’s minds.

But the reality is that GM didn’t try to *kill* public transit. They tried to *monopolize* it.  The bus-based transit systems also eventually struggled financially and eventually fell into govt control in cities across the country. The bus systems of LA, NYC, and Philly are all descended from those GM/Firestone owner bus transit systems. 

But now buses are out of favor. So much so that cities that use nothing but buses as their form of public transit are often described as *not having any public transit.* They aren’t even acknowledged. But go find an old trolley route map and compare it to the current bus route map. The systems are still there. They just made the choice to go with a cheaper and more flexible coach on wheels instead if a coach in tracks. (I like this [picture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Los_Angeles_Railway_Yellow_Car_and_coaches_map_%28cover%29%2C_1942.jpg/220px-Los_Angeles_Railway_Yellow_Car_and_coaches_map_%28cover%29%2C_1942.jpg)  for the way it highlights how buses could be viewed as just a more flexible streetcar freed from its tracks).

There’s some legit criticisms (eg., often run on fossil fuels, but some cities like SF and Philly do run some electric [trolleybuses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolleybus)  ) and some other that are also problems, but not really inherent to buses. For example, getting stuck in traffic. (This was a problem they streetcars also had as the govt required them to share the roads with cars, as they still do in places like Toronto, and Girard Ave in Philly.) Here, the main issue is a dedicated right of way (some cities like Ottawa have some bus-only transit way roads to get around this.)

Track-based systems do seem like they’re much better anchors for real estate development (a fact known to and exploited by trolley makers as explained earlier.) 

There’s this old [footage](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8YRbMMqj0qw)  from San Francisco filmed from a trolley going down market. You should watch it. It’s neat and historical. But notice some things. Notice where in the streets where the trolleys are. Notice where people waiting to board are standing. Notice how fast they are compared to walking, the cars, and the horses. Notice the lack of stop lights, stop signs, and crosswalks. As romantic as the footage is, imagine what happens as the cars get faster and more numerous. 

Here’s a [pic](https://www.spur.org/sites/default/files/blog_post_imgs/AAB-6306.jpg)  imagine trying to board and exit those! 

Actually, go to 1:50 in this footage from [1940](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=duZDzQTZ1vQ) and watch for a moment. Pay attention to the ladies in the hats getting off the streetcars around 1:56. You start to understand the appeal of curbside buses!

Or read [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sfgate.com/bayarea/nativeson/amp/Old-days-in-S-F-were-good-but-better-3204669.php) which tries to explain how the reality of the old streetcar system in SF wasn’t as romantic as we imagine. 

And none this is meant to say we shouldn’t try now. We should!  But I see a lot of bad history on this topic and I think, if we are to revamp public transit, we owe it to ourselves to understand *why* those old systems failed and went bankrupt, and understanding that involves more than just the fable that it was all due to big bad GM. 

A bit of a tangent:

I also think public transit in America will continue to suffer unless we sort out our mental health care crisis. We (correctly) shut down our inhumane insane asylums, but never came up with a good alternative, and, as a result, many of our mentally ill have joined the ranks of the homeless. For whatever reasons (warmth, panhandling opportunities) our public transit system is a magnet for homeless people with untreated mental issues. Many have become adept at developing that urban skill set for how to deal with the mentally unbalanced aggressive pan-handler, but many more have decided they’d prefer to keep their tax dollars for themselves and transport themselves in a way where they can simply avoid having to deal with the problem."

Most cities had streetcar systems in the early part of the 20th century.   They were slow, loud, and since they often ran down the center of the street, you had to wade into traffic to catch them.

They were privately owned and operated, but under heavy regulation (like a power company), and often were forced by the govt to cover costs like street paving.

Automobiles brought two issues. One, people could drive themselves and two, bus companies started popping up, which offered faster, less bouncy, and cheaper curbside service.

In the earliest days of buses, they were not terrible official and operated a bit like Uber ride share and there was something known as the [jitney bus craze](https://oldautonews.com/the-jitney-bus/). People loved them and abandoned trolleys in droves. The private companies that ran the trolleys heavily lobbied the govt and they basically regulated jitney buses out of existence, but buses would continue to be a pain in the ass for trolley companies, especially as they became increasingly cheaper, faster, and more comfortable. 

trolley systems were expensive as he to run. You had to lay track and built electric substations to power them.  You were responsible for paying for roads to be paved. But a bus...you just built it, and it drove to wherever you wanted it to go. 

All the trolley companies started going bankrupt. It was clear buses were the future of public transportation. (Mayors like La Guardia in NYC used to campaign on removing the slow old fashioned street cars with a promise to replace them with those new cool things called buses.) this was a popular thing at the time. Residents of Fifth Ave actually lobbies to ban street cars (because of their noise) on their fancy street and demanded buses.

This was basically happening world wide. It happened in cities far far away from the reaches of GM. Trolleys were done. Buses were cool. 

London tore up their trolley lines. Their famous red double-decker buses became an iconic part of the city. 

GM, Firestone, and Standard Oil decided that they wanted to be the companies that profited off this new world of buses, so they went around and bought the bankrupt private trolley companies to gain the rights of all their transportation routes (and their customers). They ripped up the trolley lines and replaces them with bus lines, where they could. They couldn’t always. For example, they continued to operate the trolley lines in Philly. It was only when a fire at a depot destroyed dozens of trolleys in the 70s that the broke-ass city finally caved as they only had enough money to replace them with a cheaper bus system. 

To modern ears it sounds bad, but for me, [this picture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Los_Angeles_Railway_Yellow_Car_and_coaches_map_%28cover%29%2C_1942.jpg/220px-Los_Angeles_Railway_Yellow_Car_and_coaches_map_%28cover%29%2C_1942.jpg)  kinda shows how this change probably didn’t seem all that drastic.  It’s two similar “coach” vehicles. One requires tracks and electric substations. One doesn’t. It’s routes can change as cities change. It’s faster, and the new wheels made it a softer ride than the metal on metals wheels of the trolley. It was seen as a sensical upgrade to an outdated transportation system. 

The the goal of GM, standard oil, and Firestone wasn’t so much to kill public transportation in US cities, but to be the ones that *owned* public transit in the new age of buses (as they would obviously profit as the builder of the bus and wheels, and the seller of the fuel they used.)

“White flight” out of the cities in the 50s and 60s did a number on the bus, trolley, and subway transportation businesses as people moved to the burbs and adopted car lifestyles, and eventually pretty much every private bus company also started to go bankrupt (as did the subway companies), and governments (often state agencies since cities were broke) took over control of the subway and bus systems from their private owners and operators. That is when transportation became truly *public* transit as governments took over the job from for-profit companies. 

It should also be noted that prior to these public acquisitions of private transportation companies, in many cities these trolley, bus, and subway systems were run my multiple separate private companies and to get across town you may have to pay multiple fares to multiple companies who competed with each other for ridership. 

So there indeed was a giant conspiracy by GM, Firestone, and Standard Oil, but it wasn’t to kill public transit. It was to own a s control it. It was in the 1970s when a follower of Ralph Nader (who hated cars) twisted the history to turn it into the modern conspiracy theory. Movies like Who Framed Roger Rabbit further cemented that version into the public’s imagination.

As for this particular episode, I plan on trying to read up on it later. This during the era of GM’s ownership of the trolleys and electric railways and they were still in the bus conversion process. Despite that one sentence on Wikipedia, my bet is that their opposition to the monorail wasn’t so much about a desire to be pro-car. They owned the public transit system and were heavily investing in it. It was about wanting the public transit system they owned to be based on buses they built, not trains and monorails built by someone else. 

As an aside, the origins of Public Transit in LA was always a bit nefarious. It wasn’t really about transportation.  It was mostly a real estate thing. A rich guy went around buying up tons of cheap land far away from the city. He’d then build electric railways to them. This brought both a way to get them to the city and also a nearby source of electricity. He sold the land at great profit, and also provided (and sold) them their electricity (the current electricity company in southern California is also descendent from one of his companies. The history of trolleys and electric companies are very intertwined as electric trolleys were one of the major factors that led to the creation of electric generation companies, and they were often jointly owned by the same parent company). 

He actually operated the trolleys and electric trains at a loss, as they were more a gimmick to get people to buy the land. Once his cheap landholdings were sold, and especially when anti-trust forced the electrical supply companies to become separate from the electric trolley company, the trolley system became a money-losing burden.  After he died, his heirs were more than happy to sell off that lemon to GM/Firestone/Standard Oil, who hoped to make it profitable again by converting it to a lower cost bus system."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fdlo882,t1_fdjvm94,1578528533.0,Yup. There was a teacher in my wife’s high school like that. Years later he raped a 14 year old student. But the kids always knew shit was off with that dude.

We walked out and about half a block down the street I’m suddenly tackled by a very pissed off waiter. 

That guy had just pocketed my cash and unbeknownst to me, we’d just walked out on an unpaid bill.

I was so embarrassed and angry."
unpopularopinion,fdklds1,t1_fdkgntj,1578505954.0,"I think you and I would probably agree on a lot. I mean, I too chose a high tax US state, and also primarily because of jobs. For family reasons we’d like to move back to Canada, but it’s career suicide, at least in our fields.  We can have a better life in the US. But it also seems a bit more precarious as jobs are so interlinked with health insurance, paid time off, etc.  Lose that good job and a lot can change pretty quickly. 

Overall, I think a “decent” life is available across a wider income spectrum in Canada, whereas in the US, you have to do pretty well to get to point where things truly seem good. But I also think there’s more opportunity in the US. 

America is more extreme. More upside, but also more downside.  In Canada it’s easier to be ok, but harder to do very well.

At least that’s the conclusion I’ve come to from my couple of decades of adult life bouncing back and forth between the two."
unpopularopinion,fdkc72l,t1_fdk69wn,1578500790.0,"I’ve also lived in both Canada and the US (and in numerous cities/states/provinces).

You’re correct. High tax states end up being close to Canadian rates, but usually Canada is still couple percentage points higher, especially when you factor in stuff like sales tax. 

But I think you get more from your taxes in Canada. There’s the big stuff like health care, parental leave, cheaper universities, etc. but also small stuff like lots of nice little parks with free skating rinks, public art, and things like that. 

My personal opinion is that Canada also provides better help/services to the neediest. Stuff like public housing in Canada is better than public housing in the US. I know people in public housing in Canada. They’re not the *nicest* places, but they’re fine. My wife’s grandmother lived in public housing. It was small, modest, and drab, but it was safe and clean. But public housing in my high tax US city is horrific. It’s mold and rats and roaches and filled with drugs and crime. It’s third world shit. 

from a more selfish middle-class and above perspective, I feel like you rarely experience any benefits as a result of higher taxes in a high tax state vs a low tax state.  You personally don’t get more by paying more. The extra you pay is mostly to help the poor, not for more universal/general public goods type stuff. 

But the differentials in the quantity and quality in the help the poor get in a high tax vs low tax state don’t seem to reflect the spending differentials. Like, you get taxed way more, but outcomes are often not noticeably better. (There are exceptions, like health insurance coverage rates in Texas are significantly lower.) but overall, there’s a lot of “where the fuck is that money going?!” feeling in the high tax parts of the US. At least, for me. 

Overall, I like high tax Canada and low tax America. High tax America is a bit like the worst of both worlds.  You’re paying almost as much you would Canada, but not getting nearly as much in return (in terms of personal benefits, universal/public goods, and quality of help for the poor)."

politics,fdi8egr,t1_fdhx0fp,1578437582.0,"The gist of it is that “women and POC” basically means “not white men.” 

Men are a bit under 50% of voters and *white men* specifically make up about 34% of voters. 

So for all voters, 34% are white men and 66% are “women and/or POC” (Aka not white men).

You’d need pretty extreme skews to have “white men” be a bigger group than “not white men,” but not even Trump’s skews are *that* extreme.

(He ended up with 45.6% of his voters being white men and 54.4% being “women and people of color,” so it was pretty darn skewed, so perhaps *obvious* was too strong a word. My apologies if that word choice didn’t sit well with you.)

Anyway, just a tangent. Sort of a “having fun with cross tabs” thing I saw online a while back about voter demographics that popped into my head. It has absolutely no bearing on your original comment.

(I don’t want to sound dismissive or like I’m discouraging anyone from voting, but sadly, yeah...that group is too small to make much of a difference...)"

AskReddit,fdh6p9r,t1_fdgvqb9,1578416554.0,"How exactly one counts varies by which version of Christianity you’re talking about, whether you’re starting/ending days at midnight vs the more traditional sunset, whether you’re talking Christmastide or Twelvetide, and when you start counting and when you end. 

Like, in some traditions you start the season at sundown on Christmas Eve, others, at midnight, some at sundown on Christmas. Some have day 1 as Christmas. Some start the twelve days on the 26th. So for some “Twelfth Night” is the feast at sundown on Epiphany Eve (Jan 5 ) and goes through the morning of the 6th. But for those that say Day 1 is the day *after* Christmas, the twelfth night is on the Epiphany (Jan 6).

But the gist of all of them is that you have Christmas and the Epiphany, and “all those days in between” are part of the Christmas season, and worrying about when day 1 begins and if you’re counting midnight to midnight vs sundown to sundown, and whether the twelve days includes the epiphany or are the 12 days leading up to the Epiphany, with the Epiphany itself being Day One of Epiphanytide, are all kind of pedantic details particular to the various sects of Christianity. 

What you should really be thinking about is how we used get many many many days in a row to drink our asses off, feast, and party and now we don’t. (Of course, we also fasted extensively before hand, cuz all that merriment isn’t good for the ol’ waistline.)

(As an aside, the Brits say “Happy Christmas” rather than Merry, because “merry” came to be associated with drunken debauchery, and that became uncouth amongst the upper class who wanted to downplay the disreputable aspects of the holiday.  Also, the Puritans in America also banned Christmas because it was such a debauched and drunken train wreck of a holiday.)"
