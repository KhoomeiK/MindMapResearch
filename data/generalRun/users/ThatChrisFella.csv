He replies, ""huh? I'm Calm Greg.""

PS4,fekz7vk,t1_fejuv9n,1579210670.0,"Limitations:

When we get online multiplayer, It'll have a max of 4 players with a possibility of that increasing to 8. So if you're making online multiplayer, you'll have to fake some players with bots

You can only use one camera at a time. This means no real time reflections, no transmitting different areas of a scene on a tv screen that the player walks past. Reflections can be faked fairly easily depending on the location of the mirror and you can switch between cameras to show other stuff.

Each scene can have a max of 10 doorway gadgets. Doorways are gadgets that link your scenes to other scenes, so for example if your character is in a building, you could put a doorway gadget at the main entrance to transport them to a scene set on the street. You could put another at the back entrance and link that to a scene set in a spooky alley. 10 is a pretty high number to be fair, but it does restrict menus and hub areas to a degree.

No importing media. This is less important but it also means no ""real people"" games, where a video of real people replaces an in-game cutscene, or those games where you watch recordings and analyze facial expressions.

Having only one camera transmit at a time also means no native splitscreen. This can be faked by some fancy wizardry, but it's a lot harder to fake for realistic looking fps games


I think that's it. For the most part the biggest are time and imagination."

In the most intense one, I was in this map that was based on a fake town with the trapper as the killer. Like imagine if someone made a replica of your town and everything was brand new but without any people in it.

It was 1st person but when I worked on gens it would switch to 3rd.

Eventually we got the last gen done and it was time to leave, except the exit gate opened up into a long and twisting tunnel inside some sort of power plant. 

I started running through the tunnel but suddenly I heard the killer music and heaps of zombies were crawling off the machines and dropping down around me.

The government also recently put over $100k into his own church as a community project. It'll get new security systems and lights and other fun stuff. 

Some may argue the usefulness of the second one for people in Sydney at least, but in a time of crisis that $200k total from it and the counselor could have went somewhere more meaningful.
