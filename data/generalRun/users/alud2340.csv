Nurse,fegxbw3,t1_fegwpau,1579104623.0,One is given to just about every cohort with the one I got. I’m not sure how many exist tbh.
Nurse,fegvjyg,t3_ep3ksz,1579103494.0,"Interview process is pretty straightforward. You go on a brief tour and then sit down with faculty. Mine was pretty laid back. It was conversational and they mostly just wanted to learn more about me and my background. Could depend on the interviewer however.

The program emphasizes clinical experience and prepares you well for any avenue of nursing. The program is pretty expensive. In retrospect, If hadn’t gotten a scholarship I don’t think it would have been worth it. An accelerated BSN would have sufficed. The program does prepare you to be a CNL so you might want to research that new role. Not many hospitals even know it exists yet. It’s essentially a leader at the bedside that translates best-practice to the point of care.

Rush is a great medical center (magnet status and all that) and generally treats their nurses well and treat their own well in advancement and returning to school. If you wish to pursue NP, you have a great chance of getting into their programs as an alumnus and they have 100% reimbursement if you are a full-time Rush RN.

TLDR: interview was relaxed and conversational. It’s a very expensive program but worth it if you have the means."

At any point in my life, different episodes and scenes resonate strongly with me depending on what’s going on in my life. After my dad died, JDs dad’s death and Cox’s fatherly moments with JD hit me hard. After a bad breakup, all the lovey and breakup scenes were tough. Of course the same goes for happy moments."
