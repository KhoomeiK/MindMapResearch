I implore the club to listen to what he has to say, take on board his experience and any ideas around the club structure and processes of training and coaching.  He has been there, seen it, done it, at the absolute top top of the European league."

Everton,fdgfkr8,t3_ekx80l,1578394511.0,"How bad  could it be to bring in some of the youth players?  Or get some of the players we have on loan back to bolster the squad.  

Sigs and Snide are obviously not up to it, either in terms of mentality, effort or style.. they both have ability just they choose not to show it which is a shame.  

I read that Beningime was on the market which I would say is terrible news.  

But I still believe there is a fundamental flaw in how we bring players through, still looking for the next Rooney to blow the world away, better to have 3 or 4 Players with the above average ability and the right mentality than one more Rooney.

If you look at the team that beat us on Sunday, they had three or four senior players with average ability but good attitude (none were serial first team starters)  at the spine of the team."
