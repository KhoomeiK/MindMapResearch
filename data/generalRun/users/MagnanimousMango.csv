TooAfraidToAsk,fffwpxd,t1_fffshno,1579893469.0,"Upvotes on Reddit mean duck all in terms of assessing the quality of posts. I commented the other day simply stating that I went to school from 9am-3pm (from jk-g12) which got something 1k upvotes. My initial 2 comments to you both reiterated that I understood the point you were making and thought you were providing generally good advice. You were quite clearly the one who began to be condescending. You act like I must lectured on basic hygiene because I do not understand it or practice it; does that have anything to do with the initial point about putting on a condom and it’s effects on birth control due to sperm counts in precum? Not I’m any way. But it’s where you decided to go because you assumed that me disagreeing with you meant that I was inept, dirty, stupid, or had some other negative quality. It’s all good man. But I’d suggest this is your issue, not mine"
TooAfraidToAsk,fffq3ms,t1_fffjoaa,1579889353.0,"Lol. Come on. You’re being purposefully obtuse and contrary. If I have sex, get up and take off the condom/throw it away, and then lay back down I will have orders of magnitude more sperm on my hands and penis (and thus bedding) than someone will have in their precum from when they went to originally put on the condom/ flipped it over if it was the wrong way. That’s probably true even if I go to the bathroom and give my duck/hands a quick wash. That is because THERE IS NO SPERM IN PRECUM unless the man recently ejaculated or is very close to ejaculating. And that is not when you want to be applying the condom on a penis anyways. Stating that fact is not me using condoms incorrectly, spraying semen all over the place when taking it off, practicing bad hygiene, or any other false narrative you want to present. 

There is a difference between saying that you should try to use condoms correctly/embody good hygiene practices, and saying that if you don’t do everything perfectly then the effectiveness of using a condom for birth control is effectively nil. And that’s what your original comment seemed to suggest (and I wanted to provide clarification of). Of course you want to use best practices when it comes to sex! Of course good hygiene is important! Educate yourself and do the best you can. I agree 100% with all of that. But not doing things perfectly doesn’t totally negate the effectiveness of condoms as a means of birth control... 

I hope you have a good day too. And not in a passive aggressive way lol"
TooAfraidToAsk,fffeeeo,t1_ffexafs,1579882141.0,"I’m a 30 year old man so Id say it’s probably a pretty safe assumption that I’ve put on/removed a condom a time or 2 more than you. 

We can argue this all we want. But realistically, this is a subreddit for people wanting to ask a question they would otherwise be too afraid to ask. The specific question of this thread is how easy it is to get pregnant. And in that context, your assertion that turning over a condom after going to roll it down the wrong way means that it is now essentially ineffective is wrong. The effectiveness on a condom as a form of birth control in that situation is minimal at worst. So I attempted to provide some nuance and clarification. If you don’t want to accept that, and instead say ‘but what about stds and having sex back to back and all that’, then fine. But people who are looking at this thread for clarification on birth control will interpret that the wrong way. So I felt that it was important for them to know what’s actually going on. 

Access to affordable birth control is not prevalent in many areas of the world. I’m happy that it is for you. But that doesn’t mean that your experiences are reflective of many peoples situations."
TooAfraidToAsk,fff947e,t1_ffevnb7,1579878767.0,"Thanks. I live in Canada so have no issues with access, but that’s a nice offer. You’re a good man"
TooAfraidToAsk,fff8vrr,t1_ffev26s,1579878610.0,"Yup. I get that. This is a subreddit for people to ask questions about things they normally wouldn’t ask, and this specific thread is about how easy it is to get pregnant. The person I was replying to stated that if you go to roll down the condom the wrong way first go it becomes essentially ineffective due to a bit of precum on the wrong side. I was trying to explain that in terms of pregnancy that isn’t really true; the condom will be generally be just as effective (precum doesn’t have sperm). I didn’t want people to draw the wrong conclusions from her statement. STDs and all that are of course related, but not part of the original question. Nuance never really seems to be appreciated on reddit however"
TooAfraidToAsk,ffegdog,t1_ffedz1m,1579846965.0,"Condoms are expensive. Their availability is also limited in many places around the world. There is social stigmas which also make people uncomfortable in trying get them even if they can. 

Yes of course toss it and grab a new one if you’ve got loads in your nightstand and tried to roll it on the wrong way. But that’s honestly not going to be an option for everyone. That’s just the reality of life"
TooAfraidToAsk,ffefq2q,t1_ffedxms,1579846265.0,"I hear you. Proper condom use is very important. And that’s why I said it’s good advice. But even peeing after ejaculating will flush the residual sperm from the urethra. Having sex back to back (without peeing in between) probably means you haven’t left the bed yet, and so will almost certainly have more residual sperm on hands or bedding or the penis (from cumming in the old condom) than on the new condom itself due to improper use in putting it on. 

If people are coming from a background of having no sex Ed, or limited access to condoms, I thought that it was important to clarify what flipping the condom actually means in practice. And in reality they probably have an extremely low risk of pregnancy. Is that a risk some people are willing to take? Understandably not. But is it a huge risk statistically speaking (especially if access to condoms is limited). Also probably not"
TooAfraidToAsk,ffeczot,t1_ffdwzas,1579843544.0,"I get what you’re saying. And honestly, it’s good advice. You want people to be careful and understand the risks. But saying that reversing the condom (if it doesn’t roll down) makes it almost ineffective is a big stretch to my mind. 

Precum has no sperm in it. None. The risk is that it flushes trace amounts of sperm already in the penis out with it. That will only be present in the penis if someone relatively recently ejaculated. It is therefore extremely likely that the condom will be effective- whether or not someone puts it on correctly first try. We are talking about small amounts of precum which itself (at worst) contains trace amount of sperm. It’s theoretically possible to get pregnant that way, but it’s not going to happen often at all"
insanepeoplefacebook,ffdvk6w,t1_ffdoeak,1579829995.0,"I believe that this is how it works in Canada as well. I looked into it years back as I was 17 dating someone in their early 20s (and didn’t want them to get in trouble). If I recall correctly, age of consent is 16 but adults must be no more than 5 years older. It seems like in practice they pretty much never prosecute for rape if the youngest party is over 16 years of age however."
