Okay, you say, let's just orbit at ~30km/s too, and we're done!  But we claimed the net forces are zero, so you're moving in a straight line, but the Earth isn't. This approach gives no solutions that are stable as time passes, you have to get more subtle than that and match the turn rate the Earth is making. You have to think in a rotating frame.

That is not what Lagrange points are. Look at them: ones on the outside of the Earth and sun. The gravity forces are in the same direction pointing in.  They can't possible balance.

Lagrange points exist in a rotating reference frame only. The transformation from static to rotating adds force called the centrifugal force that points directly out from the point of rotation. It is this 3rd force that gives rise to Lagrange points aka critical points aka the net force there is zero.
