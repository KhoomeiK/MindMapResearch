My favorite part was probably the poor guy whose pony got hit in the crossfire running outside, lol. I like your dialogue, and it flows well IMO. None of the introduced characters felt wasted. The premise is also pretty cool, but horror westerns are pretty much my fetish.

The only advice I want to give is to expand on Jacob's personality in the second half of the script. I know he's scared and confused about the whole situation and encounter with the zombie/vampire, but I don't think going completely mute is the answer. The whole 'frozen in fear' thing has always been pretty frustrating to me.

Screenwriting,fef1e47,t3_eoquz0,1579045893.0,"I'd recommend writing the dream sequence to reflect the real world events of the story, rather than the other way around. More on the dream sequence, it is far too long and over-complicated, and the 'dream within a dream' aspect doesn't help very much. The story doesn't feel to me as if it's moving forward at all. 27 pages of bickering and extended metaphor isn't very fun for a reader to go through. I don't feel like I was able to stew long enough on any one character's perception in any deep way before being dunked on by strange dream elements and metaphor.

I would go back and write another outline of the story. And if it still feels confusing to you, it probably is. If you want to keep the script more or less the same, you need to go back through it and correct some grammar/spelling errors. You have a conflict here, but it feels weighed down by pseudo-art house weirdness."

The lead characters have so much depth and natural chemistry that I didn’t consider it a bad thing when the humor took a temporary backseat near the 1 hour mark.
