soccer,fdgqkvq,t1_fdgpc70,1578405725.0,"There's a deep inheritance of football fans going back generations. Our fathers have taught us to support this big club like their fathers have done. That's why you have small kids being fans of Sporting despite them not winning the championship for 18 or 19 years.

They also teach us to be blind fans, no matter what. Some get extreme views even, join organized supporters, become thugs, thieves, drug dealers, even sometimes rapists or murderers.

But mostly is cafe talk. Everyone tries to embarrass everyone else. Your club is the best no matter what. Benfica is number one in titles and Porto spins it to say they have more international titles and Sporting spins it to say they have more titles in all sports.

Everyone attacks each other week in week out; referee is a Benfica or Porto fan, there was an investigation due to alleged corruption, etc etc.

We can't go our weeks without complaining to referees even if they did nothing wrong. We can't accept our team sometimes is shit and so we blame whatever is in reach. We have a terrible mentality and it only hurts our club, the players, the team. I wish we could overcome that. But it's not easy since it seems everyone is fueled by hate."

The use of cash is very limited, I agree. And that's exactly my point. It shouldn't. At this point would be even better to turn to crypto than use dollars or Euros digitally. Fuck banks. I want cash to be available everywhere for my privacy. Having a track of all my transactions is a nightmare."
