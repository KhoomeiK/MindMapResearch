todayilearned,fedp44g,t1_fedmeb0,1579016832.0,"Even those ones include some small building kit with it. If it’s an individual minifigure, it’s not sold, but given as a gift with purchase, so I assume that changes things"
todayilearned,fedp0h3,t1_fed9dbc,1579016766.0,Exactly! The keychains are fine because they’re an accessory and not a toy technically
todayilearned,fedoytb,t1_fed4j8i,1579016738.0,Yup keychains are not the same as the actual minifigures

2healthbars,fdle772,t1_fdldsgt,1578522117.0,"Considering you can normally buy the little Nutellas for like .50, and there are maybe like 12-15 in there, it only about £10 worth of product. You’re basically paying for the big glass jar"
2healthbars,fdldtqo,t1_fdl39dg,1578521891.0,It’s glass! So a bit better

AskReddit,fde4kdb,t1_fde4c1l,1578331033.0,Yeah exactly. There’s no reason for them to stand for 4-8 hours. Sitting makes way more sense.
space,fddaut2,t3_ekk6cw,1578303123.0,Stupid question but how do you accurately combine thousands of images?
AskReddit,fdd9fde,t3_ekdrs6,1578300988.0,"For me, if you can’t find anything joyful in your life, going back to the things that made you happy and joyful as a kid helps. You liked Lego a lot? Build a set and remember how excited you would be as a kid when new sets came out, etc. You were a huge Star Wars fan? Watch a SW movie, or read a comic. You used to like to draw? Pull out the pencils. 

Kids are really good at finding things they enjoy and just doing them. If you can’t find anything in your life now, look back and see what worked before when you were younger."

FallenOrder,fcu2r9g,t1_fctzo6i,1577970741.0,"True, but at least it takes some time to 100% it, makes the game last longer lol"
FallenOrder,fctv4s0,t1_fcttrkl,1577961126.0,"Yes to me it’s perfect. An ideal level of difficulty that doesn’t feel bad, and honestly so detailed. Everything I could want in a Star Wars game"

CasualConversation,fctr4d4,t3_eipy4z,1577955180.0,"I did the same thing last year around this time after going through a really rough time. Social media just made it worse. I downloaded reddit and used that for mindless browsing instead, best decision I ever made!!"
