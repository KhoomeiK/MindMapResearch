bipolar,ff4x5a0,t1_ff0vc4b,1579574566.0,200mg but I suspect there is a need for a boost.
bipolar,fegy6we,t1_fdw4yhd,1579105160.0,For sure!  Let me get a better picture for you.  Too much glare on this shot.
bipolar,fdwwcl6,t1_fdvr6de,1578762927.0,"Thank you.  The response to this piece literally saved my life last night so I can't begin to thank you, and everyone else who commented, enough."
bipolar,fdw0j0d,t1_fdvq8kp,1578753718.0,"Maybe someday.  For now, your comment is support enough."
bipolar,fdw03xx,t1_fdvw51s,1578753604.0,"That is the highest compliment I could ever hope to receive.  Bacon, Giacometti, and Soutine are my gods."
bipolar,fdtggfd,t1_fdt3wwb,1578716411.0,Thank you.  Seeing all the great work on here really inspired me to pick up a brush again.
bipolar,fdtd40u,t1_fdt47gn,1578715051.0,"I haven't in years.  I also haven't ""finished"" a piece in years either  After my last show I started feeling like I'd never make a living doing art, so I went super hard into my corporate gig.  I didn't realize until just recently how I was just cranking out the same crap and was completely ignoring why I do this in the first place.  So while I'm not opposed to selling, I don't really have much to sell just yet."
BipolarReddit,fco3m8t,t1_fcf6k81,1577823443.0,"I did have some loss of coordination, but that may just because I'm clumsy."
BipolarReddit,fco3bxj,t1_fck8c7w,1577823287.0,"It is so much smoother of a ride with the added bonus of not forgetting my second dose.  I found out just how much better it worked for me when I ran out and went back to the regular for a few days and had a hypomanic episode.  There were definitely triggers that contributed, but I hadn't had an episode like that when I was on the XR."
bipolar,fckxn71,t1_fc72unw,1577735393.0,"That's exactly how it felt!   I felt understood, something that rarely happens."
BipolarReddit,fcc1j9h,t3_egvgfv,1577593361.0,Have you asked about an extended release version?  I switched months ago and it changed my life.
BipolarSOs,fcbrkjh,t1_fcabmsv,1577590183.0,Also BP1 and figuring out the exact same thing with my wife.  Any advice for me?  I'm fighting the urge to just shut her out entirely.
BipolarReddit,fcbipi9,t3_egu1uo,1577587342.0,"I've honestly been wanting to do something more to raise awareness in the workplace but have no idea how to go about it without putting my future job opportunities at risk.  I made the mistake of telling my boss about my disorder and our dynamic changed dramatically.  It's like he lost all faith in me despite the fact that I'm pretty fucking great at what I do.   I don't think there is any malice in his actions towards me, just ignorance.  So while I'd love to do something, I also love stable income and not being looked at like I'm crazy.  Maybe I need to just say ""fuck it"" and dive into advocacy."
bipolar,fc9vkau,t1_fc79smx,1577558844.0,"I'm fortunate enough to be in the same boat.  Aside from the hunger, I haven't had any of the side effects mentioned."
bipolar,fc9ukl2,t3_egs9vk,1577558439.0,This is beautiful.  What size is it?
bipolar,fc7bb9p,t1_fc6s0a9,1577502496.0,"Don't give up hope.  Despite everything, we just hit our 11 year anniversary.  The boundaries we've set and reinvestment in ourselves has given me a renewed sense of appreciation for my wife.  That's why I'm on here looking for answers on how we can both take care of our mental issues without one of us getting put out.

I too thought I was fully functional when I almost bailed. In hindsight, a fight we had triggered an episode.  I was actually probably hypomanic before the fight and the fight cranked up the volume.  I even said at the time it was a ""mindful"" decision, something I'd been thinking about for a while - which is true, although my doubts were 100% in my inability to give her the level of support I thought she needed and that she would be better off without me - but that was the first time I had seriously thought of leaving in over a year.  We were honestly in a relatively healthy point in our relationship and I don't think I even meant divorce at first, just time apart, but my mouth kept going.  I can't put her through that again and know if I do, that's it.  

If you need someone to talk to or need some perspective, don't hesitate to send a PM."
