In the US two things will prevent it from being the same. First, if the signal sequences the first part that illuminates would have to meet the requirement for a turn signal by itself, as in its placement, size, intensity, etc. That first thin line doesn't qualify. Second, most lights other than the third brake light and reverse lights can't be on moving body work unless there's a redundant light on a fixed piece of body work. Here it looks like the thin line and first segment are on the hatch while the outer two segments are on the fender. Taking the first requirement into account that means they can't just have the first segment illuminate unless there's a redundant signal elsewhere. The other solution is doing it like Audi where the outermost segment on the fender lights first as the sequence starts.

About the redundant turn signals, I think they don't have to actually stick another one on the bumper like a lot of crossovers with similar designs. If the outer segments switch to regular signals when you open the hatch I think they would qualify."
