copywriting,ffqn020,t1_ffqa65f,1580138886.0,"Hey. Fellow ad copywriter here. It seems like the majority of the individuals posting and responding here are more SEO- or article-type copywriters. (You referred to it as direct copywriting.)  In the 6 months or so following this subreddit, I think you're the first I've seen to specify they're an advertising copywriter. 

I got into this career from a pretty unconventional path (graduated with design/advertising degree, minored in copywriting, decided to switch to copy after graduation) so I've always worked alongside designers. Can't imagine NOT working with designers. But that seems to be the minority here.  
So, is there something I'm missing? Is there a whole other copywriting world other than advertising? Is it technically called direct copywriting?"

NoStupidQuestions,ffgpmog,t1_ffgj4yq,1579911861.0,"This. 

You’ll always have some form of “just get to graduation.” Maybe it will be “just get accepted to college.” Or “just get that first job” etc. It never stops. 

But learning to make it through those tough times is what will have value. Then it doesn’t matter what the outside world is doing. You just gotta do you."

relationship_advice,fexjw3k,t3_eqr15p,1579432179.0,"When I (30f) was 22/23 and my husband I were just dating, we had a neighbor family that had a jam-packed house. Like 8 people (including a baby) in the same two-bedroom layout that my husband and I shared alone. There was a 10/12 year old girl that was always outside that started helping me garden when I was out. It was obvious she could use someone to talk to, and could use some space. (Plus I enjoyed her company and help with the garden.) Eventually, she started coming over to our apartment to hang out. We played games or did crafts. When I’d come home, she’d run up to me and give me a big hug. It was lovely. I think my husband thought it was a bit odd at first but never said anything and eventually came to understand my nature and the nature of our relationship. If your partner can’t come to understand, accept or even put up with your way of living in this instance, take a harder look at other places in your life together—is this happening elsewhere as well?"
IAmA,fexczvw,t1_feua3wv,1579428899.0,"Can confirm. Last week, my husband called me from a Honda dealership. (He’s generally very soft spoken and a big, loveable teddy bear.) He’d found the car he wanted to buy, liked the price, then asked me to drive out (about 30 mins) to give my blessing. Again, he was perfectly content with the price and didn’t feel the need to haggle but the salesman must’ve taken his calling me to look at it as a negotiation. By the time I made it there, they’d dropped the price by 2k and upped his trade-in by 2k. Sometimes, being a non-aggressive car buyer can work, too! 

Also, Congratulations, and best of luck! I am due in May with our first born. Husband was trading in his bachelor V6 Accord coupe for his dad-mobile Pilot. :)"

It’s funny...I had completely forgotten the context of the video. Couldn’t have told you what the kid looked like, etc. All of my memories are just my partner saying it now.

Edit: Also it’s the middle of the night here so I woke him up with the “rawwwwwwr” in the video. Of course had to then play it another time to make sure I heard the much quieter “murnin’.” Sorry not sorry."
