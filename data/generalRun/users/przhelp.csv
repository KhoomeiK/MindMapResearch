These teams can move on from a player whenever they want. I know we hold a lot of pride in our association with certain teams and we like to project how that association makes us feel onto the players, but these guys are putting their bodies on the line. 

They are under no obligation to play for less money if they don't want to. There is no reason why we should hold the players to the standard of loyalty, but not the teams.

And Greg didn't get a raise with his last contract, in the sense that his contract was renegotiated. He simply got an extension with some monetary incentives. So, he DID play his last contract. He just wanted more years, because its very dangerous to play football and its stupid to play on the final year of a deal with no security past that.

You're right, he isn't worth the money he was owed. And if he ends up taking less than the Panthers offered to renegotiate for, then that's pretty petty. But I highly doubt that ends up being the case. In any case, he's making the same rational decision we all make. Loyalty has value, but its value isn't infinite."
