Checking out local bars (easiest place to socialize)

And 

Started going to a gym that has group classes 


Really just anywhere you can socialize. When I first started getting out more, my social anxiety went through the roof. But eventually you start to adapt and get used to going new places. 

It's pretty scary for me to go somewhere where I dont know anyone, but I kept at it. 

I found out that if I showed up to a place enough times I’d make friends. 


Worst case scenario you just end up getting a good workout or just talking to a bartender but they’re always cool so that’s no loss!"

Imagine you have a 30 minute lunch break and you drive to go get food. You’re rushing the whole time so you don’t really get a break.

Have a meal replacement shake and you really only spend about a minute or two drinking it down. You get to enjoy your breaks more.
