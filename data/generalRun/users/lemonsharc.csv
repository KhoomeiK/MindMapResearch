Finches,fert1xr,t3_eq8ydd,1579358071.0,"Unfortunately since it is unhealthy and downright dangerous for finches to lay eggs often, I think it might be hard to find enough eggs for your snake. When you take away finches eggs, they lay another clutch, and it could kill the mom of you do it too soon. Also, it isn’t really the season for finches in the large outdoor aviaries to be laying eggs, which would be your best bet. You can try putting an ad out on Craigslist, or going to a big bird store, or a pet store that sells finches, and asking for the number of their finch provider, who may have eggs that they would allow you to purchase. A quick question though, why did you purchase the snake without a set food source?"
