AnimalsBeingBros,fcvhibu,t1_fcvhayt,1578002202.0,Thanks. Soon will be getting her out of pain. That is the worst part is seeing her in pain daily.
AnimalsBeingBros,fcvhcrj,t1_fcvg5ie,1578002110.0,Yes we had her right leg done and recovered but unfortunately big dog equal big bill. So we have to pay that one off first before we can get her in for the next one. We started a go fund page for our close friends and family to give to that instead of any Christmas gifts or birthday gifts. So we are getting close. About another grand and we can get in debt all over again. Love of dogs is real.
AnimalsBeingBros,fcvgyi1,t1_fcvgmq6,1578001875.0,We are almost there. I can’t handle having her in pain any longer. It’s so torturous.
AnimalsBeingBros,fcvgsiz,t1_fcvbsnw,1578001778.0,Thank you I’m going to need it.
AnimalsBeingBros,fcvgqj7,t1_fcveclh,1578001745.0,Thank you. Yes when we finally get her in to do it I will be sleeping with her on the mattress on the floor. That’s what we did the first one. So this one will be on the other leg.
AnimalsBeingBros,fcvgd33,t1_fcvbzec,1578001522.0,"My husband works from home and he is with her but we are going to a clinic that is income based. But since she is so big the bill is pretty high. We afforded to do the worst of the two. 

Now we have been paying that one off meanwhile trying to raise funds to get her other one done. So all in good time. She has been so patient. She is a really good girl. She is only 3 yrs so I want her to have some what if a puppy life."
AnimalsBeingBros,fcvba3x,t1_fcvb428,1577998496.0,Thanks. Paws up.
AnimalsBeingBros,fcvb94v,t1_fcva7m5,1577998480.0,Thanks. She is my only priority. I hate seeing her in pain. So work until I can’t anymore.
aww,fcpep1x,t1_fcp5kz6,1577860753.0,Thank you. I’m much better. We will be adopting at some point in the future.
AnimalsBeingBros,fcnwne0,t1_fcnerdr,1577819929.0,I am ok. Thank you for asking. That is really kind of you. This pic was actually taken couple years ago now. My husband gave her to me after we got news that we couldn’t have babies ourselves. It totally worked. Got me out of the funk I was in. We will be adopting in the future. Thank you for asking. I hope you have a rocking new year.

nonononoyes,fcn4s7x,t1_fcmkpf6,1577803257.0,Yeah definitely 200 cats are worth hoping on the hood. Actually I would do it probably for any animal.
aww,fcn4nnc,t1_fcmqg54,1577803156.0,Thanks I do because of her.
aww,fcn4mej,t1_fcn04hx,1577803131.0,Some else said that too on a different pic I have posted. I didn’t even know who she was. I had to look her up. She is very pretty. So thanks. Happy New Year’s Eve.
nonononoyes,fcmj6ri,t3_ehz7aa,1577777442.0,The only way I would risk my life for my car is if a child or dog are in the car. Otherwise peace out car.
aww,fcmg62w,t1_fcmeoor,1577774027.0,Thanks for asking. This picture was taken when I was dealing with the news of not being able to have children. My husband got her for me to help us deal. It totally worked.
aww,fcmg1t8,t1_fcmf46y,1577773905.0,I totally agree with you.
AnimalsBeingBros,fcma046,t1_fcm9nag,1577768296.0,Oh I’m sorry you have the flu. Pups are really the best cure to any and all ailments.
AnimalsBeingBros,fcm873x,t1_fcm7l2x,1577766815.0,"Thank you. Wow that’s really cool. Yes, she definitely made me feel human again. She got me out of my funk and back to being happy."

aww,fcm5566,t1_fcm4mlr,1577764496.0,They do thankfully.
AnimalsBeingBros,fcm343c,t1_fcm2cm9,1577762987.0,I hope so. Because she was a life saver for me.
secretsanta,fcg564e,t3_efpa9h,1577636570.0,Yayy. That means they couldn’t resist the treats. Did you get the 3 rd gift? It says it was delivered. That’s the one I’m most excited for you to get.
boop,fc7k8ho,t1_fc7f6kl,1577510104.0,No worries. She is always our only priority so she gets all the love all the time. We call her Diva.
PetTheDamnDog,fc6iouh,t1_fc6gia4,1577481508.0,I definitely boop it all the time.
PetTheDamnDog,fc6fvtn,t1_fc6dcrw,1577479608.0,Thank you. She is very kind.
PetTheDamnDog,fc6494t,t1_fc5jze8,1577471919.0,I do cuddle her to much I think that is why she is a diva now.
PetTheDamnDog,fc5cqj2,t1_fc5blh4,1577453515.0,She loves to show her little front reef.!
PetTheDamnDog,fc5clhg,t1_fc521iq,1577453374.0,She is a diva but also she gets plenty of pets. I’m thinking that’s why she made a scene. I wouldn’t pet her for the billionth time that day. Lol
PetTheDamnDog,fc5cj0f,t3_eg5eje,1577453302.0,Yeah I sure can.
PetTheDamnDog,fc5chld,t1_fc50phw,1577453262.0,She is only 3 years. She has lived a kind of slow life style for a puppy with two torn ACLs. So she loves to communicate and get lots of attention.
PetTheDamnDog,fc5cex3,t1_fc4z16x,1577453186.0,She got lots of pats after the video.
PetTheDamnDog,fc5ce2m,t1_fc4xkoj,1577453161.0,Thanks. She is kind of royalty in the Corso world. Her dad is ICCF grand champion Prince. They used his 18 year old frozen semen. He helped revive the breed back in the 80s
AnimalsBeingBros,fc5c889,t1_fc4vulp,1577452991.0,No. She was neglected so we rescued her and she is not one to want to glide so he just sits with her for a while.
PetTheDamnDog,fc4o12c,t1_fc4n91m,1577422442.0,She got lots of pets.
PetTheDamnDog,fc4krtz,t1_fc4jrdi,1577419565.0,She is such a diva.
pics,fc30w64,t1_fc2lgt4,1577378913.0,Adopting does exist. But very expensive. Also I am very happy with my pets.
pics,fc30pw3,t1_fc2juzi,1577378804.0,It’s not supposed to be a sad story. I am just happy that I have some dang cute pets in my life.
AnimalsBeingBros,fc309pk,t1_fc2fdbe,1577378513.0,It’s weird to me as well. Things that are naturally wild shouldn’t really be kept in cage. But my cage is big enough for them to glide at lease and I let them play out too.
funny,fc28hhf,t3_efrxk3,1577345451.0,Wins best sign award.

pics,fc26awg,t1_fc23qx9,1577342352.0,I got the news a few years ago. So I’ve had time to feel the emotions. I hope you guys have some options. Support groups can be helpful. It allows you to see that other couples are also in the same situation. I wish you guys the beat of luck.
pics,fc25ux6,t1_fc23d44,1577341764.0,She is super sweet too.
pics,fc25sew,t1_fc24kpw,1577341671.0,You’re right it should be. It probably will be just not in time for me. Lol. Dang it.
pics,fc25qm9,t1_fc23hql,1577341608.0,Thanks. That should be something that is doable within the next couple of years. Just probably too late for me. Haha.

pics,fc1vd8n,t1_fc1tlgz,1577330893.0,Haha. The middle one I am boarding and she is 14 so she is really sweet and easy. The big one is only 3 but she has a torn ACL so she lays down a lot. We are working on getting it fixed. The chihuahua is 10 years old so he is pretty easy too. Makes the picture taking process pretty easy too.

pics,fc1tmsu,t1_fc1skbj,1577329340.0,Thank you. I love her big floppy ears. Cropping ears I feel makes them look a little intimidating so I like to keep them. They are kind of a rare breed. But she is a really sweet baby.
pics,fc1thu9,t1_fc1sfkl,1577329214.0,"Thanks. Yes, and as soon as my situation of finances get back on track adoption will be happening. :)"
pics,fc1tejt,t1_fc1sdgq,1577329130.0,I try. I really do.

pics,fc1rt2t,t1_fc1rfi9,1577327698.0,We have joined some support groups that are very informative and helpful. It’s crazy how states differ in guidelines and requirements.

pics,fc1r1ef,t1_fc1q5q3,1577326992.0,Thank you. I know much of a roller coaster it can be. Honestly I kinda just take it in strides and work a whole lot to help my pets live their best life. But when the time comes and finances are back adoption will be happening. Are you going to adopt? Or just the fur babies.
pics,fc1ptou,t1_fc1obo9,1577325911.0,Hahaha. Cheers to that. Merry Christmas.
pics,fc1prjd,t1_fc1pldw,1577325859.0,Thank you. I love them. She is actually an Italian mastiff. But because her ears aren’t cropped she gets that she looks like a lab pit mix. But she is way bigger than a lab in person.
AnimalsBeingBros,fc1pncw,t1_fc1pfyw,1577325752.0,From someone that thought they would be fun pets then didn’t research how to care for them. So they were being given away on CL so I rescued them.
pics,fc1pifo,t1_fc1p2jp,1577325630.0,Yes. The middle pup is a boarding pup. I do that for extra cash. But when an animal comes into my home they are treated like a family member. Merry Christmas!
pics,fc1p5hi,t1_fc1opm7,1577325303.0,Thank you. Cheers to you. My pets are the my world. Merry Christmas.
pics,fc1p1cl,t1_fc1nya1,1577325200.0,I love kids and yes I do want kids. Yes we have looked into adoption. Unfortunately most agencies guidelines and cost are very high. Even working two full time jobs it’s close. So saving and saving more.
