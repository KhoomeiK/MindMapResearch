AskReddit,ffk1u91,t3_eu20x4,1580013227.0,"For me at least

1) Colors look more saturated

2) It feels like you're surrounded by a bubble

3) Time doesn't seem linear. Hours would go by like minutes and minutes could take hours.

4) I got uneasy when I was alone. I did it with some one else and anytime I went, alone, to get or do something, I could feel ""the bubble"" crashing in. The only way I can describe it is that it felt like I was the only person, floating in an endless void, despite there being people 10ft behind me. And as soon as I returned the feeling disappeared. This only happened a couple times and i tried to stay accompanied to avoid it.

5) My favorite part is that sill things seem to move. The clouds would seem to wisp away and when I looked at a picture of a lake, I could see the ripples moving as if it were a video.
