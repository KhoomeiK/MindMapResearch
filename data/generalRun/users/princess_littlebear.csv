Also it's worked really well for me before. It basically erased my anxiety. What others are in its class? I'm actually taking yoga this semester so I'm hoping that will teach me to get into the right headspace for meditation.

My doctor prescribed it when I had regular bipolar and kept me on it when he ""upgraded"" me to SZA. I've been on it without an antipsychotic and I was fine. I didn't even know this was an issue, I thought the issue was that it can cause mania in bipolar patients because it's an antidepressant."

I am still very symptomatic but I am in treatment and I'm doing my best. I dropped out of college twice, so it's taken me a little longer than usual. For me, there isn't really ""overcoming"" the illness. it's more like coping with it. I have good days and bad days (weeks, months). My illnesses will never go away and I've come to terms with that.

It's a miracle I'm able to function in university. Basically I just wanted to say that, while I don't agree with the tone the original comment had, they are right in that sometimes no matter how hard you try, your mental illness just doesn't get better. It makes me feel weird when people say ""all you have to do is take your meds and exercise and eat right and you'll be fine"". It's much more complicated than that and you also have to be very lucky for it to work that way. But definitely don't shut up about it lol it seems to be very motivating for some people."

schizophrenia,fcw2k45,t3_ej0yj5,1578015667.0,"I don't really tell people unless I feel they deserve to know. When I was dating, I told this one guy right away because I was stupid... but thankfully he understood. Although we didn't work out romantically, we are still friends and hang out from time to time when our schedules match up. I really appreciate him for that, as he is one of my only friends. When I met my current boyfriend, I didn't tell him until things started to get serious, which was about a month into talking. He took it very well. He didn't judge me or anything or make assumptions... and we'll have been together for a year on the 5th. He is sensitive towards my needs and takes care of me. We are there for each other. 

I did tell one of my teachers because I had her for multiple classes and I ended up flunking the first one and was hospitalized shortly after the end of the semester. She understood and cheered me on as I went to earn As in her other classes. She would tell me I was doing a great job and that she was proud of me. I also plan to discuss my illnesses with another teacher I am going to have again for my senior capstone. He has OCD and I wanted to talk to him about having mental illness while working and generally being productive and living a ""normal"" life. 

I do not tell people I am talking with casually, like people I meet in classes who are acquaintances but I never see outside of class.  I don't really see the point as these people generally only talk to me because I am a warm body, have notes or have done the homework or filled out the study guides, not because they want to be my friend or see something of value in my personality. I mean, they notice something off about me, because I am pretty symptomatic. So they'll say something like ""hey are you ok?"" or ""why are you acting like that haha"" or ""you seem like you're still processing what just happened"". 

I wouldn't say to never tell anyone ever. I would say, be selective in who you tell. Some people are kind and just and would never do anything to hurt you on purpose. Tell these people. I would be wary about the rest... often times they ask questions out of morbid curiosity and then they;ll turn on you once they get the answer.
