Gun owners tend to be among the most responsible people in the nation. I mean, everyone cleaned up after themselves when the rally was over - have you ever seen that happen with a BLM, gun control, or third-wave feminism rally or march? After a democratic (and sometimes Republican) candidate holds a rally? 99% of the time, the protests that the far-left has result is a ton of litter, and more often than not in property damage, violence, vandalism, arrests, and and theft."

The conveyed image does say it all. The one was violent and chaotic, the other was peaceful and patriotic. Maybe the caliber of people has something to do with it? Just saying, look at what actually happened in each of those situations; the gun rights rally had tens of thousands of armed people and not a single shot was fired, nor piece of property damaged. Only one arrest was made and it was because of a mask - the woman was soon released from custody. While the other side, those ""marches"" were anything but peaceful. ***That*** says it all.
