Knowing who the president is will do her no favors, and it’s not like she would even talk to anyone about it if she can’t remember. On the flip side, you found something that breaks through her senile state and makes her happy. That’s important. 

It’s probably extremely upsetting for your father to be confronted with how it doesn’t matter who his mother thinks the president is, though (for the brief time she remembers you told her). He probably wants to believe those things would make a difference to her life. He sounds like he’s in denial about the severity of her condition.
