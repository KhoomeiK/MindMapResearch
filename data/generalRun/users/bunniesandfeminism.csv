fragrance,ffhwuxy,t3_etqgdj,1579957456.0,"Look, I like Old Spice on a man, but it doesn't smell anything like Creed Aventus so I don't see how they're comparable. We're here because we're hobbyists and enjoy trying many different things."

NaturalBeauty,ffhwp0v,t3_etl0s1,1579957266.0,Ilia! Their liquid foundation and stick blushes are awesome.
AmItheAsshole,ffdaxob,t3_espjiy,1579816939.0,"NTA, it's your decision and there's nothing wrong with being honest! I understand her feelings though. Parents deeply look forward to becoming grandparents, and it can be very hard to accept that it may not happen, which is why she obviously was hoping all these years that you'd change your mind. You're still in the right though."
AmItheAsshole,ffda9uv,t3_essrci,1579816517.0,This is one of the most clear cut cases of YTA I've ever seen. The selfishness! The fact that you value looks (and not even your own!!!) over personal relationships is something you need to give serious thought to. Your behavior is grossly unacceptable.
fragrance,ffcn8qq,t3_esjq6n,1579803054.0,"I really don't like Black Orchid. It does not work with my body chemistry, it smells almost sour on me when I wear it."
fragrance,ffcmqo5,t1_ff7qf3p,1579802748.0,Have you tried Chanel 19? Jo Malone wood sage and sea salt?
fragrance,ffcmj9c,t3_er95y2,1579802620.0,"Suggest a feminine or unisex cherry based fragrance! Real cherry, not candy cherry. I already have TF Lost Cherry and Guerlain La Petite Robe Noire. Bonus points if it's affordable."
fragrance,ffckw3f,t3_dx75yn,1579801629.0,"I watch his videos because I find his ridiculous personality entertaining, but he does not come across as particularly knowledgeable or passionate about fragrance for the sake of fragrance. The main focus of his content is fundamentally about how to smell sexy. As a woman who couldn't care less about compliments and isn't looking to project sexiness at all times (hello, I spend the majority of my waking hours at work, plus my husband doesn't care which fragrance I wear), I frequently get annoyed that he treats women like it's their job to be young and sexy and smell edible, but I also understand that his target audience is probably a young person looking for a partner. That being said, he made a claim recently that women's fragrances aren't that interesting, and like, if you're favorite women's fragrance is Juicy Couture Gold Couture, maybe you don't know what you're talking about?

I'm really not a snob. I think you can find great fragrances at every price point, and there's nothing wrong with liking Juicy Couture Gold Couture. I just think he's not driven by creativity and artistry in fragrance, he's driven by sex appeal, and that limits his usefulness as a voice in this community."
fragrance,ffc8ulk,t1_ff88hu2,1579794186.0,"If you're interested specifically in Guerlain, I think you'd like La Petite Robe Noire. I recently bought a small bottle from FragranceX for under $30."

fragrance,ff95ldu,t3_es7obx,1579705380.0,"Fragrance is very much an aromatherapy thing for me! I always choose something according to the mood I want to create, so yes, of course I have fragrances that I reach for when I need a confidence boost. TF Black Orchid is my boss bitch pick."

thebachelor,ff650ix,t1_ff4yhzm,1579619282.0,This is the one I truly can't get over. Fiasco isn't exactly an SAT word.
thebachelor,ff64uun,t3_erpp0m,1579619171.0,I honestly can't get over this. Between the butchering of lingerie and whatever the hell a finasco is... I just can't. These girls are DUMB.

fatlogic,ff4nsu0,t1_ff432k9,1579568119.0,"In this context, it is, because it has no meaning. Self care is actually taking care of yourself, which if this person was doing that they would not need to turn to food to numb the pain. 
Look, I like to eat too, but food will not file my taxes, nurture my personal relationships, or advance my career. Those are actual self care things."
fatlogic,ff3bjug,t3_eqlpqk,1579537945.0,"Wow, the privilege. Imagine having such an easy life that the worst thing that happens to you is seeing something on social media that you don't like."
fatlogic,ff3ara3,t3_er9ovn,1579537550.0,Self care is treating your emotional health needs so that you don't have to turn to ice cream to fix your problems. Ice cream is literally my favorite food and I eat a small amount almost every day. It's not a medical treatment.
