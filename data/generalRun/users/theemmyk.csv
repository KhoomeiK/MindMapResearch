Adam Shacknai, the brother of Zahau's boyfriend, called 911 later that morning at 6:48 a.m. to report Zahau was hanging nude from a second-story balcony at the mansion. She was gagged with her hands and feet bound.

Officials said the voicemail was the trigger that led Zahau to hang herself off the courtyard balcony of the historic mansion, owned by her boyfriend, pharmaceuticals tycoon Jonah Shacknai, 54.

Two days earlier, Jonah Shacknai's 6-year-old son, Max, had suffered grave injuries from a fall off the stairs while under Zahau's care.
