sleep,fcf2qkx,t3_eh47al,1577626073.0,"I used to sleep through alarms all the time, my dad tried to say it was a mind thing but I just couldn’t do it (age 12ish). Even slept through a hurricane (rare here). Then he said “ok of you get up at this early alarm tmrw you will get to pick out a puppy” and boom I woke up. So essentially the dread of school kept me asleep but when I actually wanted something I could wake up. ((Also yeah I got a puppy but she unfortunately had parvo, survived, then later died from seizures related to the parvo.))

Ok anyway I got distracted - the way this has helped in my teen/adult life was I set a normal, chill alarm and then like 10 minutes later a highly annoying, super loud ringing, ding-ding bell type alarm on the other side of the room. It does NOT shut off without human interaction. At first I slept until the constant ringing gave me a headache and I had to get up to turn it off.
After a few times of that mess I started waking up with the beep beep alarm to keep from hearing the agonizing alarm and following headache. Now I generally wake up 10-20 minutes before the beep beep alarm but that took a couple of years and overall patience/practice. I do still set both alarms every night but rarely have to use either. (Beep beep alarm recently became a Fitbit silent alarm and agonizing alarm became my phones alarm).

Consistent bed and wake times help a lot. I usually wake up at 5:30 am on the weekends and holidays. I don’t go back to sleep but get up, feed animals, do laundry or something and later take a nap.

There are also smart alarm apps but I’m waiting to implement until I update my Fitbit because I don’t trust the apps that require sleeping with the actual phone in the bed (I have pets and a spouse so I feel like it will get confused? Especially with the cat coming and going, knocking things over, etc)"

It’s different for everyone not knowing your current habits. I actually sleep very deeply after a large meal but it goes against everything everyone says - I think it has to do with (low) blood sugar. Last night I had a cup of camomile tea and my deep sleep decreased to 15% ::shrugs::"
