""  . . . There are some dogs that definitely have warning signs of potential aggression. Whether it’s because of how an owner previously treated them, or because they never got corrected when minor aggression started to show up (and as a result, started trying to get away with more and more dominance). 

There are two major categories of aggression: dominance and fear. There are other reasons of course, but these are the big ones. 

A lot of dominance issues can be trained out, and fear can be worked through with trust and careful handling."""

Dogtraining,fez4gdc,t1_feyua8i,1579453751.0,"Jocular had a great answer. I just wanna add that treats can get them in an excited state, and some dogs don't want to be pet when there's food out, all they want is to get more food. When your dog or a strange dog is chilling, and you want to pet them, try doing 5 second pets then back off, and the dog will let you know if they want more. 

Shy or easily overwhelmed or small dogs really respond great to this. It's easy to pet them too much or too hard, leaving them uncomfortable and overstimulated. Backing off every once in a while shows them what to expect from you. Also announcing ""pets"" or ""dogpetting time!"" can give them an extra heads up, and you can use the phrase around strangers so the dog knows it's about to be pet."

Personally I would ignore this vague blog post that gives generic advice. And it's extremely unlikely for anyone to go from low activity level to ""excessive,"" because DOMS just will not let a beginner do that.
