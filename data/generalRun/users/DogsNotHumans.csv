unpopularopinion,ffinyql,t3_etskrk,1579978430.0,"You’re not wrong. I have a teenage daughter and as much as I freaking hate how unfair it is, we talk about her safety in social/public situations a lot. She shouldn’t have to worry or change her behaviour, it enrages me that I have to put this on her, but bottom line, I want her safe and unhurt more than anything else. 

I think the change in discourse around putting sexual assault prevention onto both potential victims and potential predators is a really important one, though. I grew up in a time when the discussion was solely centered on victim responsibility for prevention, so when the shift towards discourse on predatory behaviour started, it really hit home to me about what had always been missing."

She was initially sentenced to life in prison for first degree murder. After the facts of her life with him were publicized and the verdict appealed, it was changed to 6 months. 

Jane Stafford was a game changer for abused women in my country. But this was the early 80’s, not ancient history. She was my mom’s age, so that means we are exactly 1 generation removed from the norm of a man beating the shit out of a woman on the regular while everyone around them, including the police, looked the other way."
FragileMaleRedditor,ffhdwhs,t3_etltnl,1579931299.0,I hate this shit.  I unfortunately can believe it’s a woman (fee-male!) because there are those who have swallowed the kool-aid along with their internalized misogyny and made it their mission to be “that oh-so-cool girl”.  I’m both saddened and angered by them.
FragileMaleRedditor,ffhdpu9,t1_ffha5gh,1579931098.0,I remember that. A bunch of anti-choicers used it as a reason to get all antsy again like it was god themself declaring it.
