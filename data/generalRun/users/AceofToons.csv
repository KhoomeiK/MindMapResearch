It's complicated because we have 8 years of age difference between us, so I am financially independent and have my own place, she's moved in with me and is still hunting for a job, so while she has escaped from them, somewhat, it is important that she gets some financial support from them until she gets work again so I guess we'll see what the future holds"

I will keep that line in mind, her parents and I butted heads pretty hard (her step-dad is really inappropriate to her and her mom called her stupid the day I first met them) when her mom called me demanding I send my girlfriend home (after she had been at my place for a few days feeling pretty insulted) I stood up to her and ended up laying into her for calling my girlfriend stupid. So I kind of avoid them lol but I also know that I am capable of standing up to them haha

It's all about muscle memory

one tip I can give is to train your head voice, put a straw between your lips and focus on making a ooooooo sound come out of the end of the straw, feel for the vibrations in your lips, teeth, and cheek and jaw bones vs the ones when you speak with your current speaking voice"

Honestly you don't understand what it's like to live with the conditions she has and I believe that you overreacted. Having them it's very easy to feel trapped and backed into a corner and overwhelmed and when one is feeling that way one can find themselves seeing limited options, even if there weren't limited options

Why did you reduce her to a binary gender? This is so dehumanizing that it makes me wonder if we are not hearing the full story. Plus living with those conditions, life gets ahead of you so easily.
