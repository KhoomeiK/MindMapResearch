educationalgifs,ffg9q84,t1_fffj4og,1579901498.0,"I think the problem is there's way too many people who just don't give a shit about any of it, if it's not happening in their life time it's not important, if it doesn't affect them it's not important. They just care about their own little insignificant lives, and money, and sex, and satisfying whatever emotion our primal brain demands today.  

And there's also people who believe in a god, but the idea of basing our lives, culture, and future off of some magical man in the sky that we've never seen is ridiculous. We should be basing them off of what we know and what works and what we've seen. 

I think education is the key (not saying I'm some highly educated super smart intellectual) generally people who are more educated about the world and have to worry less about food and shelter will. I think schools are outdated, they need to be better at keeping kids interested in school and learning and prioritize teaching them how to be adults and have them chose to learn about what they are interested rather than try to fill their brains with shit they have absolutely no interest in. I believe what Andrew Yang is proposing could be a key, giving everyone enough to provide them with food and shelter as their basic human rights, give them a sense of security and independence would result in people having way more options and being more relaxed about their survival. Which can give people opportunities to be better educated and maybe look at the bigger picture. I think we're a decade away before any country even attempts a UBI system but if it works it can be absolutely massive for our society. Not just for the US but globally, if we reach a status where food and shelter are your basic human rights crime rate would plummet and education would be a much higher priority for people."

It's a ridiculous format where many great teams can get eliminated early because they had a bad draw as we saw with Fnatic and RNG, even Splyce fans would agree that RNG is a better team yet they couldn't get out of groups.

I would personally love to see the group stage transition into a double elimination tournament that everyone is involved in, the teams who do badly in groups just get placed lower into the bracket, get rid of the mini wildcard tournament nobody really watches and extend worlds by like 2-3 weeks. I think that's do-able and it would be great, we'd get so many awesome games that the current format doesn't and it would remove most of the RNG from the format."

So in this case someone is painting woman as  evil and you defend them for saying it."
ImGoingToHellForThis,fd0upvb,t1_fcz318p,1578124015.0,Making up unrealistic situations based on your own insecurities doesn't give you the right to shit on woman or people in general. So when you do it it makes you an incel.
ImGoingToHellForThis,fd0uceo,t1_fczixib,1578123869.0,Explain what else do you call someone who makes up unrealistic scenarios to shit on woman ?
ImGoingToHellForThis,fd0u9rg,t1_fczj562,1578123841.0,You're literally creating unrealistic scenarios to give yourself an excuse to shit on women. Then anyone who calls you out on it is immediately a white knight. The level of projection you're showing and the high levels of insecurity. You're the stereotypical incel. You can deny reality all you want but you are an incel.
ImGoingToHellForThis,fcz0sa2,t1_fcywdpt,1578091364.0,Hope all the irony hits you in the head knocks you out and wakes you up from being an incel.
ImGoingToHellForThis,fcyuedz,t1_fcysz82,1578087293.0,"Which defuses the whole point because now you're complaining about a minority of cases, and how exactly are they mostly woman ? But go on flap your incel wings shoo out of here."
ImGoingToHellForThis,fcyu7o3,t1_fcxhati,1578087179.0,Not by definition incels are commonly stereotyped for hating women. In fact most of the time someone calls someone an incel it's because of their anti-woman comments.
ImGoingToHellForThis,fcyu2p4,t1_fcxi3to,1578087093.0,Found the incel.
ImGoingToHellForThis,fcytckq,t1_fcxlki5,1578086648.0,"You can always spot the incel by their 4chanish vocabulary and overwhelming insecurity that they desperately try to cover up by insults.  

From some basic common sense I would say making fun of someone for a genetic condition is a pretty dick move. And I think most people would agree with this statement. I know you do because otherwise you'd be contradicting yourself. So to make fun of someone who has gotten hair transplants that would make you a pretty shitty person. 

So if a women does it that would make her a terrible person. If most women do it that would mean most women are evil which seems to be what you're implying. So what kind of evidence or experience do you have that women are more likely to make fun of someone with hair transplant ? Are you able to read minds by chance ? You've had plenty of conversations with real women and you've brought up this topic and you've read their minds and know exactly what they think ? Do you realize how ridiculous this is and how baseless your claim is which i dunno sound pretty autistic to me."
ImGoingToHellForThis,fcysfvu,t1_fcxlnfc,1578086093.0,"Ah yes lets use the exact definition of an incel to sound really smart.

The term incel is associated not just with the inability to find a relationship but the bashing and hating of woman. Usually by creating unrealistic scenarios where women are evil and are mean to them."
ImGoingToHellForThis,fcyrvqu,t1_fcxmbm6,1578085764.0,lol you keep making these arbitrary scenarios that make absolutely no fucking sense.
ImGoingToHellForThis,fcyrlr5,t1_fcxmofz,1578085606.0,I would say it's common sense and that's a pretty valid argument. Sure is there some shitty people out there who would do that but what exactly makes you think they're more likely to be a woman over a man ? I don't think being a shitty person has a gender if you have any sources or experiences that make you believe woman are evil lets go over it. But most normal healthy minded adults find it pretty mean to make fun of someone for being bald.
ImGoingToHellForThis,fcyr0uq,t1_fcxo0iv,1578085289.0,Actually getting  out there and talking to real people.
ImGoingToHellForThis,fcyqy89,t1_fcxolyr,1578085247.0,There's dudes out there who play the dungeon master in dungeons and dragons and buy overpriced starwars toys while having a perfectly healthy love life. Not just girls but people in general don't care if you have dorky hobbies they'll judge you on who you are as a person. Like sure you have that one super insecure person that wants to shit on others to feel better about themselves but most of them do it on the internet making circlejerk threads.

ImGoingToHellForThis,fcxfmry,t1_fcxa8je,1578061677.0,Any conversation I've ever heard or had that involved someone getting hair transplant never resulted in that person being made fun of. It's usually a conversation about how good hair transplant has gotten and how real it looks or how expensive it is. This is just the insecure thoughts of someone balding and thinking of getting hair transplant  it's not based on reality nobody reacts like that.
ImGoingToHellForThis,fcxfd2t,t1_fcxcyvr,1578061472.0,Didn't think I'd see an upvoted incel comment.
leagueoflegends,fcwu90t,t1_fcvtr11,1578037851.0,"A lot of the pros actually reach a really high elo in their first year of playing the game. And an ex pro especially coming from a game that shares many similar mechanics and the fact that he knows the drill of grinding and how to play video games at a really high level. Reaching challenger in a year is very realistic in fact even 6 months is possible depending on how hard he grinds.

Big reason why many pros might be struggling to stay in challenger is cause they spend most of their day scrimming/watching vods. Compared to someone who just plays soloQ 16 hours a day they're gonna take those top challenger spots over the pros."

Your example is so arbitrary, what if the one Braum died for also died shortly after like in this clip, then for no good reason the game is a 5v3 because the protective support tried to do his job."

That's a naive way to look at things, as long as the person is over 18 and consents the relationship is legal, gross yes but legal and understandable since younger people are usually more attractive than other 50  year olds.

But Lia clearly is not in a normal state of mind and this guy is taking advantage of her which is basically rape. Or there's a power dynamic, one of the few things we can tell Lia enjoys besides drugs is making music so he could be telling her to let him do stuff in order to use his studio."
