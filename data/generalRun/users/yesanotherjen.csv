Now, that doesn't mean there aren't some health implications to being that heavy (even at low body fat) but it's a different type of risk."
SiberianCats,fekvo4e,t3_ep8clh,1579208553.0,"By the time fur arrives, it may not have the same amount of protein on it as a live cat. Plus, every single cat is different so you may not react to one but will to another. The best thing would be to visit a cattery and meet the kitties and see how you do. I would also pay for the additional cost of a kitten who has been tested and shown to have particularly low levels of Fel d 1. 

But keep in mind, you can do all the ""right"" things and still end up reacting to your cat. Things have improved quite a bit, but my husband was sneezing and congested constantly when we got our kitten a couple of months ago. I wouldn't get a cat if you have zero tolerance for any kind of reaction."
fatlogic,fdyjw45,t1_fdxkspk,1578780602.0,"It says that 68% wear a size 14 or up, though. If that's correct, the average woman would NOT be an 8-12."
SiberianCats,fdxopoo,t3_enbm9l,1578771286.0,He definitely looks like a Maine Coon! Super cute!
RagenChastain,fdclrz5,t1_fdc7anh,1578278070.0,They're not male.
fatlogic,fd537vt,t1_fcz50t7,1578173768.0,"I think a lot of people use ""thin"" to mean anything in the ""not fat"" category. I am 5'10"" and 170 (female) and look fairly fit (I teach yoga and fitness for a living) but am not thin. There's obviously also a huge difference in how weight appears from person to person based on body type, body composition, etc."
SiberianCats,fbn268g,t3_edyapd,1576991743.0,No experience with them but we live in Seattle and got our sweet kitty from Angel of Siberia (Auburn) and have been super happy with the experience (and the kitten lol). Angela responded right away to any questions and when we went to her house (immaculate) she gave us as much time as we wanted to pick out our new family member. You could tell right away the kittens are handled regularly and were extremely comfortable meeting and being held by strangers. Ginger had a super easy transition to her new house and has been just a little bundle of fun and energy. :-)
