I had to be hospitalized as an inpatient for a month early 2018, because I really could not take care of myself. I did improve some, but there is still so much this miserable disorder has taken from me.

I have not been able to physically go to school in two years now, and at this point I'll probably still be working on highschool as a young adult, which is something scary, it makes me feel like I'm so far behind everyone else, and I'll never catch up.

The basic concept of contamination OCD is that I get obsessive thoughts about becoming dirty and my stupid brain makes me go through unreasonable rituals (or compulsions). For a couple examples: washing my hands wayyy longer than I should, bringing Lysol & wet ones type wipes outside every time (generally 1/2 times a week) that I'm out, which I use where I feel necessary. I especially use a lot of the latter, like when opening the car door, and pretty much almost whenever I start to feel anxious. 

Not to mention I spend on average multiple hours in the bathroom each day, wasting so much goddamn time there. I've been able to see some friends recently, but I still feel so far away... basically everyone I know has is 1-2 school years farther than me by now, and I just hate feeling like who I am now makes everyone uncomfortable and sad.
 

I guess the fact I'll never be able to just, truly relax, and live like anyone else is terrifying to me."
polandball,ffc2u29,t1_ffac6jz,1579790148.0,"I mean, in a large amount of languages it's been Holland used so long that it's the more common translation for The Netherlands, really. In French pretty much everyone says ""Hollande"" & calls the Dutch people ""Hollandais/Hollandaise"". But there also the term ""Pays Bas"", or low lands in English, basically the more technical term for Netherlands.

The Spanish situation is the same thing, Paises Bajos & Hollanda.

I like it because it's a superhero-ish time travelling show about a buncha screwups on wacky adventures, and doesn't take itself too seriously, plus the writers do seem to take feedback!"
