BlackPeopleTwitter,ffglhxh,t1_fffjly7,1579908999.0,"I can definitely see finding it a cringey song if you're assuming that the singer/listener thinks of themselves as some kind of bad ass for it, but as just a unique track focused on someone completely off their rocker it's kind of neat (it's not really that much of a ""song"" though).  I find it interesting to listen to something told from that unique perspective - a violent and unstable person struggling with the back-and-forth of both loving and hating someone and the ensuing breakdown it causes.  Obviously you don't have to agree with me, though.

I also think a lot of the time we find songs ""cringey"" because we're projecting a certain personality onto whoever we envision as liking/singing the song, and we find *that* cringey - even when there are plenty of likely non-cringey things we could think of instead."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffgkic2,t1_fffysrw,1579908330.0,"I think part of it depends on what lens you’re viewing it from. I think a lot of songs many people think are “cringey” have more to do with projecting a cringey perspective (often their own past perspective) towards a song onto the song itself. And lots of people, especially kids, have pretty cringey perspectives on things.

I’d guess that a lot of younger people thought of Eminem songs as “bad ass” when they were little. The violent and crude lyrics were a way to rebel against the sort of behavior their parents/society expected from them. It made them cool. It’s a pretty cringe way to look at it, and if listening to “Kim” makes you think of/remember that sort of mentality you’ll probably find the song cringey too.

Personally, I find “Kim” an interesting song to listen because its told from the perspective of a violent and unstable person. The extremes of that love/hate duality and intensity of that breakdown are fun to explore. Not because it’s “so much more real than that cookie cutter pop shit” or whatever.

You can do the same thing for plenty of songs/genres. Hearing some emo song and imagining an angsty teen finding the lyrics “deep” and feeling special/bad ass because those random songwriters “understand” them and “know what it’s like” is a lot more cringey than just a normal functional guy thinking it’s a neat song. Some people might find some Disney songs “cringe” because they envision an adult who’s obsessed with Disney in a desperate attempt to hold onto their childhood or something, rather than a pretty cool person that just thinks it’s a catchy song.  Envisioning an overly proud redneck for country music.  So on.

It's still subjective of course, just saying I think that's a common reason for finding music cringey."

I feel like most environments will have men being either somewhat sexist or being supportive, and women being competitive/negative towards or supportive of one another.  I can definitely think of stories I've heard of each of the four combinations of those.

Also, the assertiveness thing is a two way street.  The idea of women being concerned about being bitchy/catty doesn't come from nowhere, it's because many people (men and women) *do* think of women as bitchy/catty for being assertive.  Likewise, many people *do* \- usually subconsciously - take women less seriously and will interrupt them more readily.

Showerthoughts,ff6szfs,t1_ff65fv2,1579634254.0,"Didn’t go to Harvard specifically, but most of the top private schools cover the entire cost of attendance (including room & board, or even expected costs for books and travel) based on where you live with family incomes around $60,000 or less - higher for some. The problems they face don’t usually stem from affordability, but from severe imposter syndrome and having to navigate that environment on their own.

Kids from the nicer high schools have impressive opportunities to give them amazing resumes, they have parents, counselors, family friends, etc. who have had immense success to make it seem very normal and achievable for them. They have an idea for how to get that research opportunity they want or how to snag that top internship. Poorer kids don’t have those opportunities, so even if they’re smarter/more capable they don’t have the research experience and don’t really understand what they have to do. Their richer peers seem much further ahead and at ease in their new environment. Doesn’t help when you can’t relate to people talking about their vacations around the world, casually go out to eat at that nice restaurant for someone’s birthday, or afford to participate in activities like Greek life.

This is just speculation from a small sample size - not something I've seen discussed by others/in studies - but I also think the poorer kids are more likely to be negatively affected by homesickness.  Maybe a mix of being more likely to come from families that are strongly rooted to a certain area (e.g., your home is part of your identity/family history, rather than where you incidentally live because of your job) and often being closer to their parents since there's a need to provide financial support, and their emotional support was probably key in them being able to go to a top school as a poor kid.

Financially, the group at the largest disadvantage is those from upper middle class folks - the point where the extra money is still going more into living a more comfortable life (nicer house, cars for each kid, nice annual family vacations, etc.) than into savings.  They tend to overestimate how much those families can comfortably put into their child's education.  HCOL hurts too since most formulas don't seem to adequately account for just how much higher the cost is in places like SF or LA."

unpopularopinion,ff41d82,t1_ff3ju5i,1579553415.0,"While I’m sure you’re right that some feminists are like that, pretty much every feminist I know will very readily acknowledge ways that men are disadvantaged. From my experience people usually get frustrated when men try to use that to sort of invalidate women’s issues or turn it into a dick swinging contest of whose situation is worse. A woman complains about how little maternity leave she has and a man says “At least you get something, we’re lucky to even get two weeks.” Or a woman complains about some form of workplace discrimination and a man brings up diversity quotas to trivialize her experience.

Just… what is the point of that? It’s not a competition. We both have problems; we should be able to talk about our problems without downplaying those of others.

ProgrammerHumor,ff3gaxo,t1_ff2v5gv,1579540446.0,"COL just varies too drastically to say - I'm sure it's similar in the UK for comparing cities like London to Manchester to Cardiff.

In a very HCOL area it’s a good-but-not-great lifestyle. You shouldn’t have to worry about paying the bills, but you probably still want a roommate to offset housing costs and you’ll want to be mindful of how you use your discretionary funds. Not something you’d want to support a family on.

In a LCOL it could be enough to not really have to worry about money. You can afford a nice car and house without much concern, and you can even have a nice life for a spouse/kids on that income alone if you’re mindful of your spending. If you’re single, while there's obviously a limit to how much you can spend you’d have to be making pretty terrible decisions to reach it - without an absurd lifestyle/very expensive hobbies you probably don't have to think about money at all."

Also, I find it interesting that you're pointing out Shubham as the person that isn't conventionally attractive.  Joey leans heavily into the Italian-American, Jersey Shore stereotype which is very hit-and-miss - lots of people *hate* that style.  Chris doesn't look bad, by any means, but doesn't really draw attention for his attractiveness.  Shubham seems like the exact sort of person I'd expect someone into really smart, nerdy guys to be drawn to.  He's got a great face and smile.  Adam, and to a lesser extent Bill, are the only guys I would generally expect the majority of women to be attracted to because they don't lean too far into archetypes of attractiveness that people have very split feelings on.

And again, the people she felt most comfortable confiding to were Chris, Sammie, and Rebecca.  She seemed to like Bill - likely because they came on the show together.  Don't remember her really interacting with Ed or Adam much either, even though they're also very conventionally attractive.

> And in turn, why is anyone obligated to like her or want to keep her around? Every one of her reactions (including the aftershow) implied that she was outraged that people didnt like her enough to rank her higher.

They're not. But I don't see where you think she had that impression. I'm sure she wishes she stayed on longer, I'm sure everyone who got blocked wants that.  Never got the feeling of her being *pissed off* though."
TheCircleTV,feoc03r,t1_feo04ed,1579297960.0,"I think the actual quote (took this from a different post) was:

> Where I'm from showing emotion is a sign of weakness and it's like to be able to wear your heart on your sleeve and genuinely be able to do that will it resonate more as me being a woman than it would being a man. Guys are always told not to show their emotion. Why can't we?

I don't read that as Seaburn saying he’s emotional. I read that as an acknowledgement of how he wanted to play, and that it's a play style that would probably seem more natural coming from a woman than from a man.  It does not imply *why* he wanted to play that way.

> He also did absolutely nothing to combat the idea that men shouldn't show emotions. In fact he specifically went in as a woman to play to the stereotype and it worked, thus implying that he was right that men who do show their emotions would fail to win at the game.

 *Acknowledging* the stereotype is not the same thing as *justifying* the stereotype.  If I don’t think men should show emotions, just seeing an emotional man may not cause me to question that (remember we’re talking about *should* here, not *can*). Realizing that an emotional woman, which I accepted, was actually a man is probably more likely to make me question why the gender makes a difference.  Even if I don’t hold that active belief - as seems to be the case with the cast - it can still draw attention to the potential for unconscious bias and/or that it *is* a genuine problem that exists even if I’m not part of that problem. On that same note, it seemed like Karyn likely would’ve been well-liked playing herself from the start with this group of people, but people still got it when she said she wanted to show that you can't judge a book by its cover."
AskMen,feo68ap,t1_fel62ya,1579295681.0,"What in the world is this?

> How common this is. Most men will have encountered it from at least one woman in their lifetime.

Again, this seems speculative.  From my experience, many men open up *solely* to the women in their lives which almost directly contradicts your claim.  Not saying you're necessarily wrong, you just don't seem to have a solid basis to make such a strong assertion.

> Unless the deal breaker is the vulnerability. If this was a rare occurrence you might have a point, but clearly it isn't rare.

This doesn't quite follow.  We usually learn a lot about someone when they open up to us - so it makes sense that we would learn about a lot of dealbreakers more when someone is opening up.  On the flipside, women may not seem opening up as a noteworthy event and wouldn't think to attribute a break up to that - or maybe men are less likely to have certain types of dealbreakers than women.

However, I also never implied that breaking up with a man for being vulnerable isn't a thing that happens (which it seems like you think I'm saying?).  That point was just me noting that it's erroneous to assume that a breakup shortly after opening up is a breakup *because* of opening up.  

> Is it? That's literally the basis of civilisation. It's a basic animal instinct.

That doesn't mean it's a good thing.  The ""animal instinct"" part is me seeing this person and thinking ""Oh, he's probably a superhero.""  The ""human"" part is recognizing that's not an assumption I have to/should make and that it's more respectful to try to take steps to confirm he's a superhero before I operate on the assumption that he is one (assuming these aren't extreme circumstances where my safety is at risk or something like that).

And one last time:  I am not denying that this happens and is a bad thing.  I am not denying that women can perpetuate/enforce ideas of toxic masculinity.  I will readily speak out against toxic masculinity regardless of the gender of whoever is perpetuating it.  I am cautioning that your take on the severity/commonality of this behavior seems overly strong, and that using this as an excuse to make negative assumptions about women as a whole (which feels like it's the case) is a bad thing."
TheCircleTV,feo16i0,t1_fenxqzi,1579293659.0,"I do think she was wrong for initially assuming that Joey kicked her off because of her weight. But if she’s experienced getting burned in the past by people like Joey because of her weight, it’s reasonable that her instant response to him kicking her off would be a self-conscious one. And she ultimately did hear him out, and she very clearly asserts her belief that Joey is a great person.  

Also, when did she ever accuse people of only liking Sammie because she’s beautiful? She does say that Sammie’s beautiful, but I don’t remember anything about her saying that was the only thing she had going for her. In fact, she obviously likes Sammie a lot. It’s why she’s one of the people she confided in first. In fact, it seems like Sean chose Sammie \*because\* she was a beautiful woman, and the risk thing was really one of the only things she could possibly say to justify why she should stay over her.

In addition, most people on the show don’t have strong relationships with everyone. There are various times throughout the show where we hear people say that they’re ranking someone low because they just haven’t interacted with them much. Hell, Joey’s been clear that he’s had very few interactions with Rebecca, even though they’ve been on the show together from the very beginning.

First off: What makes you say it’s not even a substantial portion of women, but the *majority*? It’s very wrong for anyone to treat their partners as a representative sample of society. For another example, people who have been abused by someone in the past are more likely to be abused by another person in the future than the average person. They could be part of a community that enables abuse, or maybe they could be attracted to traits that are correlated with abuse. Your anecdotal experience should not be used to make such a strong assertion about society as a whole. Maybe it applies to your town/city and/or people in similar social groups, but your anecdotal experience certainly can't be broadly applied to people completely different than you.

Second: As the person you were replying to sort of note, you have to know if the woman is leaving just for opening up or if there’s more to it. It could be that they were non-committal and it made the relationship seem more serious than they were prepared for. It could be that “opening up” revealed that they were hung up on an ex, cheated, had anger problems, etc. that many people don’t want in a partner. Even if they opened up about something that shouldn’t be a problem at all, breaking up with someone over a dumb dealbreaker and breaking up because they were emotionally vulnerable aren’t the same thing. Especially in a context where we’re only exposed to one side of the story it’s difficult to make a generalization.

Third: Even if we do accept your statement as true, and these women really are breaking up due to finding emotional vulnerability unattractive, it’s one thing to acknowledge a societal trend and another to use that to make assumptions about a person. If I was forced to make a bet about that sixth guy on appearance alone? Sure, I’d probably guess he was a superhero. But if I needed to know he was a superhero, I’d ask. If I couldn’t directly ask, I’d try to gauge it in other ways. I’d see if he talks about saving people or look for him to use a superpower."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fehn8mo,t1_fehctqy,1579119975.0,">I never said every department uses the limit, but they certainly can if they want! 

 I mean, seriously?  

Someone makes a statement saying “The police prefer C and lower students.” You don’t think that is a generalization that implies the statement is true of the majority, or at the very least a very substantial portion, of police forces?

You affirm their statement by saying “Yep. Police departments actually have an IQ cut-off limit!” You affirm the previous generalized statement, and even further it with your own generalized statement with no qualifiers.

If you really sincerely think the natural interpretation of your statement is “a non-zero number of police departments have IQ cut-offs”, that’s incredibly dense.

I could say “Black people are criminals” and argue about how I’m right because *some* black people are criminals when someone calls me out, but it’s pretty clear that the typical message/interpretation of that statement without further context is a generalized one.  It should be entirely fair and justified for someone to consider it a racist statement and/or consider me an idiot if I persist that I was right and my generalized statement for a specific use was totally reasonable.

You certainly *could* be right that this cut-off is used by more places.  But it's also possible that high IQ people tend to be less drawn to police work for various other reasons.  Not to mention, it's strange to focus on intelligence here anyways - the vast majority of news stories we're exposed to about cops behavior is focused on being racist, aggressive, trigger-happy, etc.  Not dumb - I don't doubt there's a correlation due to the societal reasons that tend to result in people adopting these views/behaviors, but there's certainly no shortage of aggressive smart people out there, too.  So your support for that claim is still flimsy at best.

Ultimately, it would've been far better to just state the facts by mentioning that at least one police department has been known to reject someone for scoring too well, which was upheld in court since it was deemed to not be discrimination because it was applied to everyone  (IIRC).  You could mention that it's possible many others do as well since proxy IQ tests are a common practice when assessing potential candidates (or whatever the fact of the matter is).

I think the sentiment behind thr first one is obvious even if you don't agree with it so I'll focus on the second.

A minimum wage effectively serves to define what the lowest-skilled jobs are worth - it becomes a baseline from which to decide what to pay your employees.  So if a low-skilled job has a real value higher than minimum wage, they still get paid minimum wage because it's treated as a reasonable baseline (this isn't just the absolute lowest level of jobs, but also jobs slightly higher where employers likely still assess the pay based on how much higher it should be than minimum wage).

I don't know if that's been studied or not, but a comparable example that I think has been studied is speed limits.  I think one state experimented with removing speed limits and found that it reduced accident rates, partially because drivers based their speed on what seemed reasonable rather than in relation to the speed limit (though I think part if it wad also a reduction in road rage towards driving below the speed limit).

This isn't something in well-versed in so I could be misremembering, and you can obviously argue against this idea, but I do think it's a common reasoning for arguing against minimum wage."
Cringetopia,fdrnio4,t1_fdrmktl,1578687007.0,"I’m very pro-choice, but I don’t really think there’s a meaningful distinction between what she actually said and “thanking her abortion” - if we assume that she was referring to abortion, which is likely since something like birth control isn’t really a controversial issue. From my perspective, focusing on choice in the phrasing just makes the statement seem less harsh and more appealing to moderates who likely support the idea of abortion but still think it should be treated as something that’s necessarily very tragic.

In the context of someone choosing to have an abortion primarily due to not wanting to have a child at the time, there isn’t any real difference between saying “I’m thankful for my abortion” and “I’m thankful for my right to choose to have an abortion.” It’s a more general statement, but when you’re discussing actually employing that choice I think they’re equivalent.

She believes this abortion was critical to her being able to find success as an actress, and to lead the life she wanted to live; in other words, she has her abortion to thank for her success and so she did. That’s perfectly fine. I don’t think that should have to be sugarcoated.

I doubt many people think we should dismiss any Asian fusion restaurants (which is most restaurants with Asian food) because the founder couldn’t have actually come from each of the countries represented in the menu. It also wouldn’t make sense if we decided to make an exception if they’re from one of the countries represented or claimed that it’s okay because they’re “close enough”. I don’t think I have to explain why that would be problematic.

Which then brings up the question of what the problem *actually* is. Making fun of other cultures is a problem. Denying inspiration from other cultures is a problem.

But just realizing “Wow, that pattern is beautiful!” and creating a piece of art that utilizes it (or something similar) and selling it at your next convention? Especially if you explain where the inspiration came from? That isn’t really disrespectful at all - in fact, it’s probably more of a good thing since it can bring an awareness and appreciation for that culture to more people.  I'm hesitant to claim that a larger company doing it on a broader scale for more profit inherently changes that; large company might be more likely to engage in other predatory practices but there's nothing inherent here that comes to mind.

Even the point of something that is especially important/sacred, which I used to be very adamant about, seems flawed when I think more about it. Say I’m traveling and experience/engage in a tradition of the local people that I find really beautiful and impactful. If it’s something that I think would be enriching to experience more regularly, would that be a bad thing? If some aspect of the tradition is something I am unable to replicate should that preclude me from doing it? If there’s an aspect I change slightly to make it more meaningful/impactful to me, would that be bad even if it goes against the original tradition?

At least to me, I struggle to see those things as necessarily problematic. It’s something that happens a lot on smaller scales (e.g., one family adopting a Christmas tradition important to another family but not exactly), and I don’t think the larger scale necessarily changes it. The important part, to me, is to be respectful when you are engaging with that tradition in its original context.

While my personal views towards sharing culture is very open, though, I still would generally advocate for prioritizing the desires of the community in question - unfortunately, this can be difficult for larger communities that don’t really have a single source of authority or likely have people with varying opinions.  

Anyway, just thought I’d provide another perspective on this issue."

(1) ignoring the role of disease in the Taino dying, making it sound like the decimation of their population was almost entirely on Columbus and his crew slaughtering them

(2) a disproportionate focus on private prisons when they make up a pretty small percentage of US prisons, making them seem like the primary contributing factor in various issues with the US prison system

(3) ignoring trademark and fair use when discussing IP law.

The comic explicitly says ""So I already know what some people are going to say :  'It's not true, I take care of half the chores at home.'  In that case, just as well!  (But try and confirm it with your partner).  If things are like that in your home, it still doesn't change the problem: statistically, women are still the ones managing household tasks.  According to the French Institute of Statistics, women are still devoting 2.5 times more hours to chores than men.""

It doesn't say #yesallmen.  It doesn't say men don't do anything.  It doesn't say men are incompetent at doing things.  It says that, statistically, women tend to (1) do more chores than men and (2) a lot more managing of chores, even when the division of the chores themselves is equal.  If you find such a simple assertion sexist when it takes less than a minute to find a study for it and is presented in a form that takes special care to acknowledge that it doesn't necessarily apply to all men, credits this phenomenon to socialization and not ""men are bad,"" doesn't make any claim that men don't have problems of their own... I don't know what to think.  It feels like you would have to be coming into this with an extremely hostile view from the outset in order to come away with that.

There can be sexism towards women, even prevalent sexism, without asserting most men are terrible people.  There can be sexism towards women and also towards men.  There can be issues that are problematic for both men and women, but in very different ways.  Acknowledging women's problems doesn't take away from the importance of men's problems.  I'm really having trouble seeing why this is something you'd feel attacked by."
AmItheAsshole,fdl5o34,t1_fdknuh1,1578517472.0,"But no one ever said “men are purely at fault.” No one said that there aren’t relationships with the dynamic reversed, and the comic even *explicitly* acknowledges that it doesn't necessarily apply to all men.

However, it is something that is far more common with men than women. The natural reasoning for this is that outdated gender roles have been carried over from previous generations, or generations where women were usually stay-at-home mothers. That men still tend to be socialized to take far less initiative in household chores, scheduling doctor’s appointments, figuring out the shopping lists, etc. and carry that with them.

Acknowledging this common reasoning is important for a few reasons.

Most simply, people usually find it easier to change/improve a behavior if they understand it. It’s part of why figuring out the reasons for your behavior is a big part of therapy. If there’s a very common reason for a behavior, it’s worthwhile to talk about it so that can be done more easily.

Telling a relatable and specific story is more likely to get people to realize “Shit, that’s what it’s like for me” than something more abstract. Trying to make sure your children don’t adopt a mindset is easier if you have an idea of where the mindset comes from. Saying “Yeah, this is a common behavior because of how we grow up - it doesn’t automatically make you a bad person” is also better than not talking about that and having everyone assume you’re lazy/selfish for not taking your fair share of the mental load.  

And to be honest, I think it’s good for us to stay aware that feminism still is important and needed even when there’s a lot more equality than in the past (especially on the surface level). Sort of like all lives matter vs black lives matter.  Police brutality is important for everyone, of course, but it’s also important to acknowledge that it’s an especial problem for black people and a symptom of broader societal problems; that racism is still a problem even if the law is equal and we’ve had a black president."
unpopularopinion,fdkfbj8,t1_fdjvb31,1578502661.0,"It feels disingenuous to pretend that complaints about homelessness are non-issues because on a state-wide level it's not as severe as others.  Like, DC is all just one city.  If you're counting that, you'd have to be an idiot to not know that takes the top spot.  When people talk about homelessness, they're talking about places SF, LA, and San Diego.  Not Sacramento or Bakersfield.

Also your poverty source is a bit off.  The census has multiple measures of poverty.  Yours is based on the ""official one"" used for federal programs and such, which generally isn't well-regarded by actual researchers on poverty.  It's an income3x the amount your family needed to eat in the 1950s adjusted for inflation and nothing else.  

The supplementary source provided by the census, which takes all forms of income/assistance into account, takes housing costs into account, lots of different stuff.  By that measure, it's just a hair below DC (18.2% vs 18.1%) and even substantially higher than the next states (Louisiana at 16.5%, Florida at 16.2%, Mississippi at 15.8%, New Mexico at 14.4%) - the national average is 13.1%.

I won't look into your other stats, based on the high correlation to most of those with education (and the one that literally is education lol) I would guess that they're accurate and that focusing on cities would still have lots of other options ahead of them.

Not to say you can't judge movie adaptations in their own right - but I think many people are just assuming that since people like the musical, if people don't like the movie it's because the movie did a lot of things uniquely wrong.

tifu,fdhji1g,t1_fd5ypkw,1578423968.0,"What in the world do you think I'm saying?  I explicitly indicated this was not okay.  I explicitly indicated that this was a violation of trust.

What I *am* saying is that scales of ""badness"" exist, and our actions do not exist in a vacuum.

If my SO shared a terrible picture of me I asked him to delete, I would be far less upset than if he shared a nude.  Neither is okay, both are violations are trust.  They are not equivalent; it is ""less bad"" to share the terrible picture, but bad none-the-less.  Feelings on this will vary by individual; my supposition though is that, on average, women will feel a greater violation of trust from their nudes being shared than men.  The reason for that supposition pertains to my next point:

The ""badness"" of sharing nudes does not solely stem from the action itself - it also stems from its side effects.  In the case of women, sharing nudes generally contributes to the objectification of women and toxic masculinity, it perpetuates the mindsets responsible for rape culture.  That's not exactly a secret/non-obvious, and it's a big fucking deal.  Sharing nudes of men has far less severe side effects (though I imagine it still does have some unique side effects of its own), hence my assertion that it is more problematic to share nudes of women than men:  while they are equally bad in a vacuum, in real life nudes of women contributes far more to a far more worrisome societal issue.

ETA:  For a different issue we can focus on minority representation in movies.  It's not inherently more of a problem to change a black character to a white one than vice versa.  It's not inherently a problem for a minority character to be in a secondary role or to fit some stereotype.  These are problems because they contribute to a broader trend of minorities being seen as caricatures instead of proper people, of viewing ""white"" as the default, of ignoring the unique and interesting experiences of minority groups because of fear it won't appeal to the majority, etc.  That is, a major component of the problem with the action is the broader societal issues that it contributes to."
tifu,fdhhdip,t1_fd5gico,1578422678.0,"Late response, I know.

I would be a lot less bothered if my SO shared a terrible picture of me I asked him to delete than if they shared a nude of me.  Both are pictures of me being shared without my consent.  Neither is an okay thing to do.  Pretending they are equivalent is nonsensical.

As a generalization, the broader societal context surrounding sexuality and how it pertains to nude photos tends to make it less problematic for male nudes to be shared without consent than for women.  Sharing nude photos of women has strong byproducts that contribute to the objectification of women and toxic masculinity.  Sharing nude photos of men has far less severe byproducts.  If we were in a vacuum where these byproducts did not exist then sure, they'd be equally bad.  But we don't."

unpopularopinion,fdhap6g,t1_fdgk75l,1578418985.0,"I had a much longer reply but: in my opinion, it boils down to security in your own unique culture and identity.

Blacks and Native Americans, reasonably, don’t have a ton of that. They have a strong and recent history of that being entirely taken away from them, and I can get a lot of people being a bit on-edge and protective of others partaking in their culture. It can still feel like the problematic assimilation practices of recent generations, just assimilation by the white guys taking your culture instead of forcing you to take theirs.

From my understanding, Asians in America generally don’t have that history (not that there wasn’t oppression, just less cultural oppression specifically), but they’re also a smaller group that’s often forgotten about on a national level, and the culture tends to fade quickly. So that could lead to the recent descendants of immigrants feeling insecure in that aspect of their identity and thus becoming more sensitive when it’s used by someone else.

It’s not something I’ve noticed very much with Hispanics. Compared to Asians, Hispanic immigrants often do more to preserve their culture and have a long history of their culture mixing well with the US.  They are also a much larger group and fairly well-represented in the national conscience. So it makes sense that there’s generally less concern about cultural appropriation amongst them.

The white people you're talking about, of course, are just trying to help - they’re operating on broad/vague ideas, not their personal experience. That gives them a more incomplete understanding of the issue and probably makes them more likely to go overboard in what they imagine cultural appropriation is and why/when it’s a problem.  But there are still plenty of minorities as well who are operating more on ideas of how they're told they're supposed to feel than trying to really develop their own feelings on a situation and acting on that.  The fact that so many people really love critcizing and getting outraged at others doesn't help either, doesn't exactly encourage people to try to become understanding or look for gray areas/nuance in situations."

The reverse scenario has a pretty much non-zero chance of happening, so the presumed scenario is one of purely violating trust in the name of showing off.

Even if we change the guys' scenario to also be one of just violating trust (e.g., the pictures were of SOs, nothing weird/desperate about it) the implication is still different. A lot of the offense comes from the objectification. Since the vast majority of women don't really give a fuck about dick pics and it'd be bizarre to treat men as something to conquer (given the ease of getting sex if that's all they're after), that isn't nearly as much of a concern.

Violating trust and putting something private on display without consent isn't cool, but the nature of society generally makes it a considerably worse thing to do to women than men."
todayilearned,fctkcdr,t1_fctc45p,1577946383.0,"Seriously? You can't imagine how country size complicates things?

Let's use a simple example: which software my company uses for a given task.

If I'm creating a new company, this is fairly straightforward. I just need to decide which option provides the best balance of affordability with value added (functionality, ease of use, etc).

If I already have a small company and decide to change this because the current one isn't working, I have to go through that process again. I'll also likely have to rewrite some things that are dependent on that software in some way and set a couple days aside when things are slow to ensure that everyone is trained on the new software. 

If I have a large company, things are more complicated. I can't single-handedly ensure everything is rewritten and everyone retrained. I'm going to have to disseminate this need to other people and trust them to handle it. As a large company, I also likely have a much larger number of things that need to be redone on the new system. I also might be less familiar with the various ways the current software is used, which might make it more difficult for md to make a good choice for the new software. The time needed to appropriately disseminate this information down many chains of command, to make the changes necessary to preexisting procedures/docs/whatever, and ensure that everyone successfully gets retrained as well is pretty substantial.

Basically, even for many fairly simple procedures/protocols, the difficulty of implementing a system increases with both the size it is being introduced at and the scale/complexity/work needed to change whatever that new system is replacing.

The American health care system is at a huge disadvantage in both of these areas. Let's assume we have no issues passing for it. Insurance is complicated; thousands and thousands of jobs are dependent on our insurance system, whether the jobs of people working for health insurance companies, medical billers/coders, people who teach/write curriculum for billers/coders, etc. Many of the numerous different electronic programs used by healthcare facilities are likely making assumptions based on the current insurance system and will need to be rewritten. Many employers have their good healthcare benefits as a major draw, and it will take considerable time/effort to maintain their status as a desirable workplace if that's taken out of the equation, the government being one of the most noteworthy such examples. And that's just off the top of my head as someone uneducated in the matter, I'm sure there's plenty more. And that's ignoring tons of issues relating to the money required, like the additional need for the US to add controls for costs, potential higher costs due to higher obesity rates, continuing to incentivize healthcare research (particularly if we have lower costs that would reduce profits), etc. And given how long it takes things to get through Congress and get implemented, it probably wouldn't be trivial to make changes if we realize some aspect isn't working.

All of that doesn't mean we can't/shouldn't make changes, but it is more difficult for us to implement that sort of system than it was for the other countries that have it. At least I'd heavily caution thinking we can rush it by doing the same thing as another country and have this all done in a single term, as nice as that would be."

The reason is genuinely professionalism.  I can't confidently say why, but I believe it has to do with the perception of their job solely being to serve and tend to you combined with the mobility involved. Standing makes them seem more engaged and faster - and is probably actually at least somewhat true for cashiering.

Reception work has a few differences.  First, people are generally expecting to wait at a place with reception, and/or have a set appointment time. So speed just isn't that essential.  If anything, it could give off the wrong impression of rushing people in/out than actually taking the time to address whatever they're there for. In addition, there's les reaching around involved - it seems more normal to sit when you're just barely moving. And reception has a more involved job than just tending to someone in front of them, so we can more readily see thre desk as needed for those posts of their job. And I'm sure pat off it is also that we are used to seeing cashiers stand - which draws attention to when they're sitting, and makes it seem like ""Oh, they're tired and need a break"" and reinforces the idea of them being less quick and engaged.

It is true that there's more concern over what ""looks good"" than what's actually comfortable and most healthy for the staff.  And that's probably because they're too replaceable for them to care.

Also, the assertiveness thing is a two way street.  The idea of women being concerned about being bitchy/catty doesn't come from nowhere, it's because many people (men and women) *do* think of women as bitchy/catty for being assertive.  Likewise, many people *do* \- usually subconsciously - take women less seriously and will interrupt them more readily.

The problems they face donâ€™t usually stem from affordability, but from severe imposter syndrome and having to navigate that environment on their own.

Kids from the nicer high schools have impressive opportunities to give them amazing resumes, they have parents, counselors, family friends, etc. who have had immense success to make it seem very normal and achievable for them. They have an idea for how to get that research opportunity they want or how to snag that top internship. Poorer kids donâ€™t have those opportunities, so even if theyâ€™re smarter/more capable they donâ€™t have the research experience and donâ€™t really understand what they have to do. Their richer peers seem much further ahead and at ease in their new environment. Doesnâ€™t help when you canâ€™t relate to people talking about their vacations around the world, casually go out to eat at that nice restaurant for someoneâ€™s birthday, or afford to participate in activities like Greek life.

This is just speculation from a small sample size - not something I've seen discussed by others/in studies - but I also think the poorer kids are more likely to be negatively affected by homesickness.  Maybe a mix of being more likely to come from families that are strongly rooted to a certain area (e.g., your home is part of your identity/family history, rather than where you incidentally live because of your job) and often being closer to their parents since there's a need to provide financial support, and their emotional support was probably key in them being able to go to a top school as a poor kid.

Financially, the group at the largest disadvantage is those from upper middle class folks - the point where the extra money is still going more into living a more comfortable life (nicer house, cars for each kid, nice annual family vacations, etc.) than into savings.  They tend to overestimate how much those families can comfortably put into their child's education.

Also, I find it interesting that you're pointing out Shubham as the person that isn't conventionally attractive.  Joey leans heavily into the Italian-American, Jersey Shore stereotype which is very hit-and-miss - lots of people *hate* that style.  Chris doesn't look bad, by any means, but doesn't really draw attention for his attractiveness.  Shubham seems like the exact sort of person I'd expect someone into really smart, nerdy guys to be drawn to.  He's got a great face and smile.  Adam, and to a lesser extent Bill, are the only guys I would generally expect the majority of women to be attracted to because they don't lean too far into archetypes of attractiveness that people have very split feelings on.

And again, the people she felt most comfortable confiding to were Chris, Sammie, and Rebecca.  She seemed to like Bill - likely because they came on the show together.  Don't remember her really interacting with Ed or Adam much either, even though they're also very conventionally attractive.

TheCircleTV,feoc03r,t1_feo04ed,1579297960.0,"I think the actual quote (took this from a different post) was:

I don't read that as Seaburn saying heâ€™s emotional. I read that as an acknowledgement of how he wanted to play, and that it's a play style that would probably seem more natural coming from a woman than from a man.  It does not imply *why* he wanted to play that way.

> He also did absolutely nothing to combat the idea that men shouldn't show emotions. In fact he specifically went in as a woman to play to the stereotype and it worked, thus implying that he was right that men who do show their emotions would fail to win at the game.

 *Acknowledging* the stereotype is not the same thing as *justifying* the stereotype.  If I donâ€™t think men should show emotions, just seeing an emotional man may not cause me to question that (remember weâ€™re talking about *should* here, not *can*). Realizing that an emotional woman, which I accepted, was actually a man is probably more likely to make me question why the gender makes a difference.  Even if I donâ€™t hold that active belief - as seems to be the case with the cast - it can still draw attention to the potential for unconscious bias and/or that it *is* a genuine problem that exists even if Iâ€™m not part of that problem.

Again, this seems speculative.  From my experience, many men open up *solely* to the women in their lives which almost directly contradicts your claim.  Not saying you're necessarily wrong, you just don't seem to have a solid basis to make such a strong assertion.

> Unless the deal breaker is the vulnerability. If this was a rare occurrence you might have a point, but clearly it isn't rare.

This doesn't quite follow.  We usually learn a lot about someone when they open up to us - so it makes sense that we would learn about a lot of dealbreakers more when someone is opening up.  On the flipside, women may not seem opening up as a noteworthy event and wouldn't think to attribute a break up to that - or maybe men are less likely to have certain types of dealbreakers than women.

However, I also never implied that breaking up with a man for being vulnerable isn't a thing that happens (which it seems like you think I'm saying?).  That point was just me noting that it's erroneous to assume that a breakup shortly after opening up is a breakup *because* of opening up.  

> Is it? That's literally the basis of civilisation. It's a basic animal instinct.

That doesn't mean it's a good thing.  The ""animal instinct"" part is me seeing this person and thinking ""Oh, he's probably a superhero.""  The ""human"" part is recognizing that's not an assumption I have to/should make and that it's more respectful to try to take steps to confirm he's a superhero before I operate on the assumption that he is one (assuming these aren't extreme circumstances where my safety is at risk or something like that).

And one last time:  I am not denying that this happens and is a bad thing.  I am not denying that women can perpetuate/enforce ideas of toxic masculinity.  I will readily speak out against toxic masculinity regardless of the gender of whoever is perpetuating it.  I am cautioning that your take on the severity/commonality of this behavior seems overly strong, and that using this as an excuse to make negative assumptions about women as a whole (which feels like it's the case) is a bad thing."

And she ultimately did hear him out, and she very clearly asserts her belief that Joey is a great person.  

Also, when did she ever accuse people of only liking Sammie because sheâ€™s beautiful? She does say that Sammieâ€™s beautiful, but I donâ€™t remember anything about her saying that was the only thing she had going for her. In fact, she obviously likes Sammie a lot. Itâ€™s why sheâ€™s one of the people she confided in first. In fact, it seems like Sean chose Sammie \*because\* she was a beautiful woman, and the risk thing was really one of the only things she could possibly say to justify why she should stay over her.

In addition, most people on the show donâ€™t have strong relationships with everyone.

First off: What makes you say itâ€™s not even a substantial portion of women, but the *majority*? Itâ€™s very wrong for anyone to treat their partners as a representative sample of society. For another example, people who have been abused by someone in the past are more likely to be abused by another person in the future than the average person. They could be part of a community that enables abuse, or maybe they could be attracted to traits that are correlated with abuse. Your anecdotal experience should not be used to make such a strong assertion about society as a whole. Maybe it applies to your town/city and/or people in similar social groups, but your anecdotal experience certainly can't be broadly applied to people completely different than you.

Second: As the person you were replying to sort of note, you have to know if the woman is leaving just for opening up or if thereâ€™s more to it. It could be that they were non-committal and it made the relationship seem more serious than they were prepared for. It could be that â€œopening upâ€ revealed that they were hung up on an ex, cheated, had anger problems, etc. that many people donâ€™t want in a partner. Even if they opened up about something that shouldnâ€™t be a problem at all, breaking up with someone over a dumb dealbreaker and breaking up because they were emotionally vulnerable arenâ€™t the same thing. Especially in a context where weâ€™re only exposed to one side of the story itâ€™s difficult to make a generalization.

Third: Even if we do accept your statement as true, and these women really are breaking up due to finding emotional vulnerability unattractive, itâ€™s one thing to acknowledge a societal trend and another to use that to make assumptions about a person. If I was forced to make a bet about that sixth guy on appearance alone? Sure, Iâ€™d probably guess he was a superhero. But if I needed to know he was a superhero, Iâ€™d ask. If I couldnâ€™t directly ask, Iâ€™d try to gauge it in other ways. Iâ€™d see if he talks about saving people or look for him to use a superpower."

 I mean, seriously?  

Someone makes a statement saying â€œThe police prefer C and lower students.â€ You donâ€™t think that is a generalization that implies the statement is true of the majority, or at the very least a very substantial portion, of police forces?

You affirm their statement by saying â€œYep. Police departments actually have an IQ cut-off limit!â€ You affirm the previous generalized statement, and even further it with your own generalized statement with no qualifiers.

If you really sincerely think the natural interpretation of your statement is â€œa non-zero number of police departments have IQ cut-offsâ€, thatâ€™s incredibly dense.

I could say â€œBlack people are criminalsâ€ and argue about how Iâ€™m right because *some* black people are criminals when someone calls me out, but itâ€™s pretty clear that the typical message/interpretation of that statement without further context is a generalized one.  It should be entirely fair and justified for someone to consider it a racist statement and/or consider me an idiot if I persist that I was right and my generalized statement for a specific use was totally reasonable.

You certainly *could* be right that this cut-off is used by more places.  But it's also possible that high IQ people tend to be less drawn to police work for various other reasons.  Not to mention, it's strange to focus on intelligence here anyways - the vast majority of news stories we're exposed to about cops behavior is focused on being racist, aggressive, trigger-happy, etc.  Not dumb - I don't doubt there's a correlation due to the societal reasons that tend to result in people adopting these views/behaviors, but there's certainly no shortage of aggressive smart people out there, too.  So your support for that claim is still flimsy at best.

Ultimately, it would've been far better to just state the facts by mentioning that at least one police department has been known to reject someone for scoring too well, which was upheld in court since it was deemed to not be discrimination because it was applied to everyone  (IIRC).  You could mention that it's possible many others do as well since proxy IQ tests are a common practice when assessing potential candidates (or whatever the fact of the matter is).

He definitely sucks based on how he's told the story.  We don't have her perspective though - maybe she's been taken to her breaking point because he consistently doesn't pay attention to her, maybe he's made creepy comments about teenagers in the past, maybe she tried to open up about how hurt she was by his lack of caring and he just said ""but the game!""

I think the sentiment behind thr first one is obvious even if you don't agree with it so I'll focus on the second.

A minimum wage effectively serves to define what the lowest-skilled jobs are worth - it becomes a baseline from which to decide what to pay your employees.  So if a low-skilled job has a real value higher than minimum wage, they still get paid minimum wage because it's treated as a reasonable baseline (this isn't just the absolute lowest level of jobs, but also jobs slightly higher where employers likely still assess the pay based on how much higher it should be than minimum wage).

I don't know if that's been studied or not, but a comparable example that I think has been studied is speed limits.  I think one state experimented with removing speed limits and found that it reduced accident rates, partially because drivers based their speed on what seemed reasonable rather than in relation to the speed limit (though I think part if it wad also a reduction in road rage towards driving below the speed limit).

This isn't something in well-versed in so I could be misremembering, and you can obviously argue against this idea, but I do think it's a common reasoning for arguing against minimum wage."

From my perspective, focusing on choice in the phrasing just makes the statement seem less harsh and more appealing to moderates who likely support the idea of abortion but still think it should be treated as something thatâ€™s necessarily very tragic.

In the context of someone choosing to have an abortion primarily due to not wanting to have a child at the time, there isnâ€™t any real difference between saying â€œIâ€™m thankful for my abortionâ€ and â€œIâ€™m thankful for my right to choose to have an abortion.â€ Itâ€™s a more general statement, but when youâ€™re discussing actually employing that choice I think theyâ€™re equivalent.

She believes this abortion was critical to her being able to find success as an actress, and to lead the life she wanted to live; in other words, she has her abortion to thank for her success and so she did. Thatâ€™s perfectly fine. I donâ€™t think that should have to be sugarcoated.

(As a side note I know her statement doesnâ€™t directly reference abortion, but itâ€™s highly probable since itâ€™s still a controversial political issue, not something generally settled like birth control - so for the purposes of this comment Iâ€™m assuming that she was in fact referencing an abortion)."

I mean, lots of composers have created songs heavily inspired by folk music from various traditions, often not their own - which naturally theyâ€™re generally going to profit from. Iâ€™ve never heard of anyone thinking of this as problematic, but I struggle to see any functional difference.

I doubt many people think we should dismiss any Asian fusion restaurants (which is most restaurants with Asian food) because the founder couldnâ€™t have actually come from each of the countries represented in the menu. It also wouldnâ€™t make sense if we decided to make an exception if theyâ€™re from one of the countries represented or claimed that itâ€™s okay because theyâ€™re â€œclose enoughâ€. I donâ€™t think I have to explain why that would be problematic.

Which then brings up the question of what the problem *actually* is. Making fun of other cultures is a problem. Denying inspiration from other cultures is a problem.

But just realizing â€œWow, that pattern is beautiful!â€ and creating a piece of art that utilizes it (or something similar) and selling it at your next convention? Especially if you explain where the inspiration came from? That isnâ€™t really disrespectful at all - in fact, itâ€™s probably more of a good thing since it can bring an awareness and appreciation for that culture to more people.  I'm hesitant to claim that a larger company doing it on a broader scale for more profit inherently changes that; large company might be more likely to engage in other predatory practices but there's nothing inherent here that comes to mind.

Even the point of something that is especially important/sacred, which I used to be very adamant about, seems flawed when I think more about it. Say Iâ€™m traveling and experience/engage in a tradition of the local people that I find really beautiful and impactful. If itâ€™s something that I think would be enriching to experience more regularly, would that be a bad thing? If some aspect of the tradition is something I am unable to replicate should that preclude me from doing it? If thereâ€™s an aspect I change slightly to make it more meaningful/impactful to me, would that be bad even if it goes against the original tradition?

At least to me, I struggle to see those things as necessarily problematic. Itâ€™s something that happens a lot on smaller scales (e.g., one family adopting a Christmas tradition important to another family but not exactly), and I donâ€™t think the larger scale necessarily changes it. The important part, to me, is to be respectful when you are engaging with that tradition in its original context.

In particular he tends to boil problems down to singular causes when there are usually tons of other contributing factors that are as if not more important than the main one he talks about.

IIRC some things that were off to me, all of which can be easily looked into, were:

(1) ignoring the role of disease in the Taino dying, making it sound like the decimation of their population was almost entirely on Columbus and his crew slaughtering them

(2) a disproportionate focus on private prisons when they make up a pretty small percentage of US prisons, making them seem like the primary contributing factor in various issues with the US prison system

(3) ignoring trademark and fair use when discussing IP law. It makes it sound like drawing any picture/writing fanfic is illegal, and that without that copyright extension we'd be able to sell our own Mickey Mouse movies without a second thought, which isn't true.

The comic explicitly says ""So I already know what some people are going to say :  'It's not true, I take care of half the chores at home.'  In that case, just as well!  (But try and confirm it with your partner).  If things are like that in your home, it still doesn't change the problem: statistically, women are still the ones managing household tasks.  According to the French Institute of Statistics, women are still devoting 2.5 times more hours to chores than men.""

It doesn't say #yesallmen.  It doesn't say men don't do anything.  It doesn't say men are incompetent at doing things.  It says that, statistically, women tend to (1) do more chores than men and (2) a lot more managing of chores, even when the division of the chores themselves is equal.  If you find such a simple assertion sexist when it takes less than a minute to find a study for it and is presented in a form that takes special care to acknowledge that it doesn't necessarily apply to all men, credits this phenomenon to socialization and not ""men are bad,"" doesn't make any claim that men don't have problems of their own... I don't know what to think.  It feels like you would have to be coming into this with an extremely hostile view from the outset in order to come away with that.

There can be sexism towards women, even prevalent sexism, without asserting most men are terrible people.  There can be sexism towards women and also towards men.  There can be issues that are problematic for both men and women, but in very different ways.  Acknowledging women's problems doesn't take away from the importance of men's problems.  I'm really having trouble seeing why this is something you'd feel attacked by."
AmItheAsshole,fdl5o34,t1_fdknuh1,1578517472.0,"But no one ever said â€œmen are purely at fault.â€ No one said that there arenâ€™t relationships with the dynamic reversed, and the comic even *explicitly* acknowledges that it doesn't necessarily apply to all men.

However, it is something that is far more common with men than women. The natural reasoning for this is that outdated gender roles have been carried over from previous generations, or generations where women were usually stay-at-home mothers. That men still tend to be socialized to take far less initiative in household chores, scheduling doctorâ€™s appointments, figuring out the shopping lists, etc. and carry that with them.

Acknowledging this common reasoning is important for a few reasons.

Most simply, people usually find it easier to change/improve a behavior if they understand it. Itâ€™s part of why figuring out the reasons for your behavior is a big part of therapy. If thereâ€™s a very common reason for a behavior, itâ€™s worthwhile to talk about it so that can be done more easily.

Telling a relatable and specific story is more likely to get people to realize â€œShit, thatâ€™s what itâ€™s like for meâ€ than something more abstract. Trying to make sure your children donâ€™t adopt a mindset is easier if you have an idea of where the mindset comes from. Saying â€œYeah, this is a common behavior because of how we grow up - it doesnâ€™t automatically make you a bad personâ€ is also better than not talking about that and having everyone assume youâ€™re lazy/selfish for not taking your fair share of the mental load.  

And to be honest, I think itâ€™s good for us to stay aware that feminism still is important and needed even when thereâ€™s a lot more equality than in the past (especially on the surface level). Sort of like all lives matter vs black lives matter.  Police brutality is important for everyone, of course, but itâ€™s also important to acknowledge that itâ€™s an especial problem for black people and a symptom of broader societal problems; that racism is still a problem even if the law is equal and weâ€™ve had a black president."
unpopularopinion,fdkfbj8,t1_fdjvb31,1578502661.0,"It feels disingenuous to pretend that complaints about homelessness are non-issues because on a state-wide level it's not as severe as others.  Like, DC is all just one city.  If you're counting that, you'd have to be an idiot to not know that takes the top spot.  When people talk about homelessness, they're talking about places SF, LA, and San Diego.  Not Sacramento or Bakersfield.

Also your poverty source is a bit off.  The census has multiple measures of poverty.  Yours is based on the ""official one"" used for federal programs and such, which generally isn't well-regarded by actual researchers on poverty.  It's an income3x the amount your family needed to eat in the 1950s adjusted for inflation and nothing else.  

The supplementary source provided by the census, which takes all forms of income/assistance into account, takes housing costs into account, lots of different stuff.  By that measure, it's just a hair below DC (18.2% vs 18.1%) and even substantially higher than the next states (Louisiana at 16.5%, Florida at 16.2%, Mississippi at 15.8%, New Mexico at 14.4%) - the national average is 13.1%.

I won't look into your other stats, based on the high correlation to most of those with education (and the one that literally is education lol) I would guess that they're accurate and that focusing on cities would still have lots of other options ahead of them.

Ultimately, I would imagine that the cities of CA are relatively harder to do well in than in many other areas because of the importance of having an education to get a good enough job to make do with the cost-of-living.  If you do have that, it's more about personal preference."

I've just been annoyed seeing a lot of people infer that certain things about the Cats movie was bad because they did a bad job adapting it, when many of the complaints made are things that can't reasonably be changed without incredibly huge and fundamental changes to the source material.  Not to say you can't judge movie adaptations in their own right - but I think many people are just assuming that since people like the musical, if people don't like the movie it's because the movie did a lot of things uniquely wrong.

tifu,fdhji1g,t1_fd5ypkw,1578423968.0,"What in the world do you think I'm saying?  I explicitly indicated this was not okay.  I explicitly indicated that this was a violation of trust.

What I *am* saying is that scales of ""badness"" exist, and our actions do not exist in a vacuum.

If my SO shared a terrible picture of me I asked him to delete, I would be far less upset than if he shared a nude.  Neither is okay, both are violations are trust.  They are not equivalent; it is ""less bad"" to share the terrible picture, but bad none-the-less.  Feelings on this will vary by individual; my supposition though is that, on average, women will feel a greater violation of trust from their nudes being shared than men.  The reason for that supposition pertains to my next point:

The ""badness"" of sharing nudes does not solely stem from the action itself - it also stems from its side effects.  In the case of women, sharing nudes generally contributes to the objectification of women and toxic masculinity, it perpetuates the mindsets responsible for rape culture.  That's not exactly a secret/non-obvious, and it's a big fucking deal.  Sharing nudes of men has far less severe side effects (though I imagine it still does have some unique side effects of its own), hence my assertion that it is more problematic to share nudes of women than men:  while they are equally bad in a vacuum, in real life nudes of women contributes far more to a far more worrisome societal issue.

ETA:  For a different issue we can focus on minority representation in movies.  It's not inherently more of a problem to change a black character to a white one than vice versa.  It's not inherently a problem for a minority character to be in a secondary role or to fit some stereotype.  These are problems because they contribute to a broader trend of minorities being seen as caricatures instead of proper people, of viewing ""white"" as the default, of ignoring the unique and interesting experiences of minority groups because of fear it won't appeal to the majority, etc.  That is, a major component of the problem with the action is the broader societal issues that it contributes to."

I would be a lot less bothered if my SO shared a terrible picture of me I asked him to delete than if they shared a nude of me.  Both are pictures of me being shared without my consent.  Neither is an okay thing to do.  Pretending they are equivalent is nonsensical.

As a generalization, the broader societal context surrounding sexuality and how it pertains to nude photos tends to make it less problematic for male nudes to be shared without consent than for women.  Sharing nude photos of women has strong byproducts that contribute to the objectification of women and toxic masculinity.  Sharing nude photos of men has far less severe byproducts.  If we were in a vacuum where these byproducts did not exist then sure, they'd be equally bad.  But we don't."

unpopularopinion,fdhap6g,t1_fdgk75l,1578418985.0,"I had a much longer reply but: in my opinion, it boils down to security in your own unique culture and identity.

Blacks and Native Americans, reasonably, donâ€™t have a ton of that. They have a strong and recent history of that being entirely taken away from them, and I can get a lot of people being a bit on-edge and protective of others partaking in their culture. It can still feel like the problematic assimilation practices of recent generations, just assimilation by the white guys taking your culture instead of forcing you to take theirs.

From my understanding, Asians in America generally donâ€™t have that history (not that there wasnâ€™t oppression, just less cultural oppression specifically), but theyâ€™re also a smaller group thatâ€™s often forgotten about on a national level, and the culture tends to fade quickly. So that could lead to the recent descendants of immigrants feeling insecure in that aspect of their identity and thus becoming more sensitive when itâ€™s used by someone else.

Itâ€™s not something Iâ€™ve noticed very much with Hispanics. Compared to Asians, Hispanic immigrants often do more to preserve their culture and have a long history of their culture mixing well with the US.  They are also a much larger group and fairly well-represented in the national conscience. So it makes sense that thereâ€™s generally less concern about cultural appropriation amongst them.

The white people you're talking about, of course, are just trying to help - theyâ€™re operating on broad/vague ideas, not their personal experience. That gives them a more incomplete understanding of the issue and probably makes them more likely to go overboard in what they imagine cultural appropriation is and why/when itâ€™s a problem.  But there are still plenty of minorities as well who are operating more on ideas of how they're told they're supposed to feel than trying to really develop their own feelings on a situation and acting on that.  The fact that so many people really love critcizing and getting outraged at others doesn't help either, doesn't exactly encourage people to try to become understanding or look for gray areas/nuance in situations."

The reverse scenario has a pretty much non-zero chance of happening, so the presumed scenario is one of purely violating trust in the name of showing off.

Even if we change the guys' scenario to also be one of just violating trust (e.g., the pictures were of SOs, nothing weird/desperate about it) the implication is still different. A lot of the offense comes from the objectification. Since the vast majority of women don't really give a fuck about dick pics and it'd be bizarre to treat men as something to conquer (given the ease of getting sex if that's all they're after), that isn't nearly as much of a concern.

Violating trust and putting something private on display without consent isn't cool, but the nature of society generally makes it a considerably worse thing to do to women than men."
todayilearned,fctkcdr,t1_fctc45p,1577946383.0,"Seriously? You can't imagine how country size complicates things?

Let's use a simple example: which software my company uses for a given task.

If I'm creating a new company, this is fairly straightforward. I just need to decide which option provides the best balance of affordability with value added (functionality, ease of use, etc).

If I already have a small company and decide to change this because the current one isn't working, I have to go through that process again. I'll also likely have to rewrite some things that are dependent on that software in some way and set a couple days aside when things are slow to ensure that everyone is trained on the new software. 

If I have a large company, things are more complicated. I can't single-handedly ensure everything is rewritten and everyone retrained. I'm going to have to disseminate this need to other people and trust them to handle it. As a large company, I also likely have a much larger number of things that need to be redone on the new system. I also might be less familiar with the various ways the current software is used, which might make it more difficult for md to make a good choice for the new software. The time needed to appropriately disseminate this information down many chains of command, to make the changes necessary to preexisting procedures/docs/whatever, and ensure that everyone successfully gets retrained as well is pretty substantial.

Basically, even for many fairly simple procedures/protocols, the difficulty of implementing a system increases with both the size it is being introduced at and the scale/complexity/work needed to change whatever that new system is replacing.

The American health care system is at a huge disadvantage in both of these areas. Let's assume we have no issues passing for it. Insurance is complicated; thousands and thousands of jobs are dependent on our insurance system, whether the jobs of people working for health insurance companies, medical billers/coders, people who teach/write curriculum for billers/coders, etc. Many of the numerous different electronic programs used by healthcare facilities are likely making assumptions based on the current insurance system and will need to be rewritten. Many employers have their good healthcare benefits as a major draw, and it will take considerable time/effort to maintain their status as a desirable workplace if that's taken out of the equation, the government being one of the most noteworthy such examples. And that's just off the top of my head as someone uneducated in the matter, I'm sure there's plenty more. And that's ignoring tons of issues relating to the money required, like the additional need for the US to add controls for costs, potential higher costs due to higher obesity rates, continuing to incentivize healthcare research (particularly if we have lower costs that would reduce profits), etc. And given how long it takes things to get through Congress and get implemented, it probably wouldn't be trivial to make changes if we realize some aspect isn't working.

All of that doesn't mean we can't/shouldn't make changes, but it is more difficult for us to implement that sort of system than it was for the other countries that have it. At least I'd heavily caution thinking we can rush it by doing the same thing as another country and have this all done in a single term, as nice as that would be."

They felt disillusioned by the ""snakes in the grass"" of conventional politics and wanted something different from that. They felt like they were normal, decent people being vilified just because they're white (bonus points if they're Christian or a man) and it seemed out of hand.

Their distrust towards politicians, and particularly Demicrats, leads to them readily giving their side the benefit of the doubt but not the other side. Throw in most of their news being biased and they generally assume that Trump is doing a solid job. That the Democrats' wants are opposed to theirs, that they are untrustworthy, and they are motivated primarily for selfish reasons. So the assumption is that they are exaggerating the bad, and there's more to the story or things we don't understand.

They aren't terribly interested in taking measures to make sure they really know the whole story. 
They might pick 1-2 preferred sources and just trust those, and iterate on a combination of that and gut feelings.

The reason is genuinely professionalism.  I can't confidently say why, but I believe it has to do with the perception of their job solely being to serve and tend to you combined with the mobility involved. Standing makes them seem more engaged and faster - and is probably actually at least somewhat true for cashiering.

Reception work has a few differences.  First, people are generally expecting to wait at a place with reception, and/or have a set appointment time. So speed just isn't that essential.  If anything, it could give off the wrong impression of rushing people in/out than actually taking the time to address whatever they're there for. In addition, there's les reaching around involved - it seems more normal to sit when you're just barely moving. And reception has a more involved job than just tending to someone in front of them, so we can more readily see thre desk as needed for those posts of their job. And I'm sure pat off it is also that we are used to seeing cashiers stand - which draws attention to when they're sitting, and makes it seem like ""Oh, they're tired and need a break"" and reinforces the idea of them being less quick and engaged.

It is true that there's more concern over what ""looks good"" than what's actually comfortable and most healthy for the staff.  And that's probably because they're too replaceable for them to care.
