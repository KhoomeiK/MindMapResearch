tolkienfans,ff69e4z,t1_ff647zd,1579622204.0,"I said in my previous comment that she would think it would be a precious heirloom to add glory to her house. She was already highly insecure about the nobility of Rohan, and it was partly through this that Wormtongue brought her despair. 

> ""Think you that Wormtongue had poison only for Théoden's ears? *‘Dotard! What is the house of Eorl but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek, and their brats roll on the floor among their dogs?’* Have you not heard those words before? Saruman spoke them, the teacher of Wormtongue. Though I do not doubt that Wormtongue at home wrapped their meaning in terms more cunning. My lord, if your sister's love for you, and her will still bent to her duty, had not restrained her lips; you might have heard even such things as these escape them. But who knows what she spoke to the darkness, alone, in the bitter watches of the night, when all her life seemed shrinking, and the walls of her bower closing in about her, a hutch to trammel some wild thing in?""

If Grima can play on such feelings then the Ring could too. She would perceive it less of an item of wealth and more as some proud status icon, a symbol of escape from the ""reek"" she perceived around her.

This would not be too dissimilar to Isildur's motivation to take the Ring. He didn't do it out of desire for power, but justified it as a ""weregild"" and envisaged it as ""an heirloom of the North Kingdom"".

Incidentally, for Smeagol I don't think it was just greed of gold that played on his mind, but also envy at someone else having treasure instead of him. Of course it's interesting that later when he knows more of the Ring's true nature his desire of it is more framed around its power to make him ""Gollum the Great""."

tolkienfans,ff630ze,t1_ff62pty,1579617867.0,"So their discussion was moot? They had no free will to reverse their actions at that stage?

I personally don't agree with that idea. I think their choice to go after the Silmarils at that stage was their final fall, the last point at which redemption was open to them. A bit like when Sauron was offered the chance to repent after the War of Wrath, or when Gollum is called a sneak by Sam on the stairs to Cirith Ungol. Tolkien likes to build in these poignant ""last chance before the fall"" moments for his villainous characters."
tolkienfans,ff62ch5,t1_ff5h3jx,1579617367.0,"Your quote ignores the whole section where Eowyn stands up proudly against the Witch-King, uncowed by his gaze or his taunts. She laughs in his face. The only other person we see stand up to the Witch-King is Gandalf (and arguably Aragorn, though Aragorn makes it clear he is deathly afraid of the ringwraiths). Everyone else is reduced to terror and usually complete inaction by the mere presence of a Nazgul. The Witch-King physically crushed her, but not spiritually.

I'm not sure if the Ring would have betrayed her like it did Isildur because I think once corrupted she would actually be a good tool for the Ring. She would be much more willing to use it in warfare, bringing herself into contact with its master who would crush her and take back his possession. That's what the Ring 'wanted', to the extent that the Ring has a will at all."
tolkienfans,ff61knm,t1_ff5z2cf,1579616790.0,"> A couple of other things would probably have to be true. To begin with, she'd have to know about the One Ring and the potential for wielding power that it offered.

Smeagol didn't know about that but still fell quickly to the Ring's temptation. I don't think knowledge of it in that way is necessary for corruption. Just sight of it or close contact with it seems to be enough. It could easily worm her way into her mind as a precious thing to add glory to the heirlooms of Edoras, to add dignity where she saw it was lacking. It would grow in her mind as such an important thing that she would be compelled to act, seeing whoever held it as being a traitor to her house who was deliberately trying to keep her weak and impoverished in status.

She's certainly no Smeagol, of course, so I don't see her murdering for it. Not right away, anyway.

Having said that, I also think she demonstrated extreme personal devotion in the story, very willing to sacrifice or risk herself for others. She knows pity, and helps Merry out in letting him ride with her. It's hard to imagine her betraying Frodo in the way Boromir did. But of course Boromir himself showed somewhat of these traits too..."
tolkienfans,ff60hp4,t1_ff58edh,1579615964.0,"> True, some did, though again it very strongly depends on their disposition towards the lords of the west, whether they remained faithful or 'turned' black. Many of the sons of Elros turned away, but crucially some did not, and Aragorn and Faramir are of their lineage.

I think it's down to faith and humility. Some of the Numenorean kings were able to accept death as a part of their fate. Many others fought death instead, and so became corrupted. Hobbits are a very humble folk that accept their lot in life, for the most part. Sandyman doubtless would have been ensnared by the Ring, of course.

Eowyn I think would fail because she lacked true faith and humility. She fell into despair seeing her house brought low, and was prideful about what her life should really be. Aragorn had an effect on her not unlike the Ring itself, giving her the temptation of a more noble life. I think the Ring would have given her visions of being a noble Queen that brings Rohan up to the stature of Gondor - nay, even greater than that decayed kingdom! She would have fallen easily. Aye, and the proud men that tried to cage her before would learn to know a woman's wrath..."

tolkienfans,ff2xfa8,t3_erd61a,1579527686.0,"Oaths are things of power in Tolkien's world. Oathbreakers tend to get punished for it (like the dead men of Dunharrow, or some of the characters in Turin's story, or Gollum in his oaths about the Ring). Elrond advises against swearing oaths at the outsetting of the Fellowship, as he believes they can be dangerous. Possibly something to do with what happened to his adopted father, or what was done to all his kin...

However there is no sign that people are truly forced to obey oaths - more it seems that the oaths chase them. Otherwise we wouldn't have oathbreakers! And certainly not all of the behaviour of the Sons of Feanor was mandated by the oath. They were fine to let the Silmarils rest in Morgoth's crown, but not in Doriath? Kidnapping Luthien was not necessary to fulfill the oath, nor was burning the ships at Losgar or even stealing the ships in the first place. So we cannot excuse all the actions of the Feanorians as a result of the oath.

Though perhaps there is some psychological dimension to this. They feel compelled to obey the oath, and in doing so start down the route of ""the ends justifies the means"" to achieve it, until morally they become completely lost. Yet to go down this murky moral path is still a choice of free will, and we see clearly different of the sons behave differently in this respect.

In the end we see a debate between Maglor and Maedhros on whether they should obey the oath or not - Maglor wanted to break it and Maedhros refused. The breaking would have called the Everlasting Darkness upon them. We don't really know what that means, but it sounds unpleasant. So they decided they didn't want to risk that, and would rather defy the Valar again and get further blood on their hands. This was a bad choice on their part, and mostly clearly still a choice."

Silmarillionmemes,fehx73a,t1_feh1z79,1579125650.0,"> The trouble starts when production decides to lean into identity politics to make it controversial and get more press.

I think it's the opposite that happens. There is outcry about lack of diversity all the time, and producers want to stop that from the start. In some cases they throw in some token appeasement, in others they do a proper job of integrating diverse characters in a cohesive way.

Given the money involved here I'm going to assume the latter will be what is aimed for. But of course the proof will be in the pudding."
Silmarillionmemes,fehwf1t,t1_feh408g,1579125207.0,"> another simple fact that not every story needs to check all the boxes of ""representation"" to be a good story

That was true in Tolkien's days, but these days it's just not culturally accepted. You may disagree with that, but it's the truth of things.

Of course that doesn't excuse badly done inserts. Tauriel was awful, and the movies would have been better without her. But the same could be said of so many of the changes and additions.

What I find weird is how they made Eowyn a far weaker character in the LotR movies, when she's a strong woman with feminist ideals in the book. Tolkien does have good women characters to draw on for the right adaptation. If we don't see Erendis in Numenor I'll be disappointed."
Silmarillionmemes,fehw16d,t1_fehl4ek,1579124993.0,"If you read letters 169 and 211 it's clear he still has the idea of Middle-Earth being Northern Europe and the whole setting being a pre-history. He admits it doesn't really work and would be a lot of effort to make it work, but it is still very much the concept.

Tolkien's like of allegory was more on the order of ""Gondor = Italy"" or ""The Ring = nuclear weapons"", which he never intended. It doesn't mean he shirked all links to the real world, just the sort of very direct links people tried to interpret from his works.

Plus he wrote Leaf by Niggle, which is 100% an allegorical story :P"

tolkienfans,fe2jko7,t3_ennssf,1578839146.0,Anyone else get the feeling that the more Tolkien wrote about Galadriel the more he fell in love with the character and wanted to give her higher and higher status? She goes from random Noldor princess to the inspiration of the Silmarils with her own special exodus permission from Manwe and centuries of tutelage from Melian. I can't help but think a properly written Silmarillion would have Galadriel playing a much bigger role throughout.
