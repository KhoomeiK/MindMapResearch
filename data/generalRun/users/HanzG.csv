Im certainly no expert, but it seems the Crown works as a corporation, not as a State entity or department.  They (Royal Family) own the land legally. You (Britains) cant take it back, it's not yours.  The Crown also gives 85% of their profits to the British treasury.  They also drive roughly 4x their 'cost' back into the British economy in tourism alone.  Personally I think they're a benefit to Britian, even if they have no real power."
