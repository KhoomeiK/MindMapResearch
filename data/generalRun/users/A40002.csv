All a sports team is a bunch of people that are randomly places together and forces to socialize. Everyone has a mutual interest in making it work cause the better you get along the stronger the team. Every season, every year, you are forced to meet new people and make it work, learning how to socialize and overcome anxieties and conflict. Outside of sports these same skills that you've now practiced are used in every work environment and social situation in life. And unlike video games, you got to things in person and face to face. That means overcoming with nerves and anxiety and learning body language and signals that are non verbal. You fat neckbeards that laugh and call it sportball and kicking a ball from here to there miss the point of teams. As a side benefit you stay fit and healthy which makes you look good in clothes, and ups your confidence which then boosts how you present yourself.

Ask a person who lost weight and is now fit if they liked themselves more before or after. Other people shouldn't feel bad for how they feel or for treating you differently after you look different. This whole ""it was me all along"" bullshit, no it was people and thats ok. People like good looking people, shocking, I know. You do too. Grit your teeth, lose the weight and stop being fat. Most importantly, stop telling yourself it's for any other reason than simply being more attractive to yourself and other people. Sure it's healthier too but you want the confidence to look good in clothes and to be sexy, well that come from people treating you different cause you're not a whale."

Given the choice between a saturated market and an unknown market, the saturated one saves you all the up front work (defining a market, is there demand? Will the business model work? Is it scalable?). The biggest mistake people make is not try because they think there's already too many competitors. It's way easier to enter a proven market and focus on doing something different or unique to find your niche and grow."

This whole ""it was me all along"" bullshit, no it was people and thats ok. People like good looking people, shocking, I know. You do too. Grit your teeth, lose the weight and stop being fat. Most importantly, stop telling yourself it's for any other reason than simply being more attractive to yourself and other people.

Is it scalable?). The biggest mistake people make is not try because they think there's already too many competitors.
