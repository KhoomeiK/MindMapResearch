Those tiny little wires will add ESR, inductance and plain old resistance to the output stage of the step down regulator that powers the chip. Yes, it was probably working, but there is a reason that special capacitors are used for switch mode power supplies like this and adding new ones with tiny little wires like this is the wrong way to do it.

interestingasfuck,feovd3f,t3_epyyfk,1579306217.0,"This is because the LED display is ""multiplexed"".

The LED display will have 3 cathodes, (negative lines) per digit. Then there would be anodes (positive lines) for the digit segments, top line, left line, right line, middle line etc. (or anodes and multiple cathodes, it depends entirely on the designer but the principle is the same).

To save CPU lines and electricity, the little cpu on board would send one of those anodes negative, and then set the postive lines to display a digit. 2 for example in this case. It waits a little time, then sets that first digit cathode back to open, and then set the second cathode to negative, and then the cpu would set the lines to the anodes for the 4, it would then repeat the process for the 9.

So at any time time only ONE of the digits are actually on, 8, 4 or the 2. This is a more efficient way of lighting displays like this. The human eye is too slow to respond to the other digits being off as its refreshed so quickly.

The two dot flashing is a seperate line thats controlled directly, as you can see its blurry so is on for the full time."

Set sharing on the agents name for the admin staff so they can see the agents files so they can do the reports and paperwork etc. Staff admin get the email ""new user has shared their folder with you"".
Open in office.com, click on folder, click on sync. 

It should be as simple as that. But no, on admin staff PCs, onedrive constantly pegging 1 cpu core, constantly syncing, like it never ever stops.  So many times i see onedrive at ""syncing 9 files, 4.2gb of 4.3gb"" but it never changes, it sits there for hours and hours.

Quit onedrive, reload, fixes the issue instantly. What's worse is that the admin staff are using the online storage option which doesnt even download the damn files until the admin staff has to open/work with it, yet still onedrive is stuck constantly at syncing.

The only half reliable onedrive install is the one on the server used to maintain a local file history and concurrent backup that prevents agents who leave ""unhappy"" from destroying their local data. Even if they do, the local server keeps a cache and volume shadow copy helps as well."

I think i may have narrowed it down though, seems as there have been a few instances of complete file and paths exceeding 255 characters. Since in onedrive, anything thats not a alphanumeric code is stored as extended codes. For example ""Property 1 - Report"" is stored as ""property%201%20-%20Report""

A few folders of that business exceed the 255 limit pretty quickly and word just looses its shit, so im guessing onedrive is also have issues with it.

Damnthatsinteresting,feg4ref,t1_feg446p,1579076872.0,"The number of kids dying from NOT being vaccinated is also very low in the grand scheme of things, however when you go from one year with zero deaths, then the next year hundreds, thats a pretty significant issue that is directly as a result of this anti-vaxx movement.  The fact that most children survive measles with or without vaccinations is a moot point, as the problem is if an unvaccinated child never contracts measles as a child, that's seen as a ""Win"" by the anti vaxxers, but the REAL problem is that if that individual who has grown up then contracts measles, it can be very very deadly, causing sterility, brain damage from fever or even death.

What really sucks is that if said unvaccinated adult contracts measles from an unvaccinated child, you have two points of failure. Two sets of parents who have failed in being parents and taking every step to protect their offspring.

Thats just sad.

What's even worse, is that if there WAS a chance for vaccinations to cause autism in 1 of a million cases, would you want an alive autistic child? or a dead one....

Anti-vaxxers are choosing death. And thats where i think anti-vaxxers should be convicted of child neglect."
Damnthatsinteresting,feg3wy3,t1_feg3ja1,1579075791.0,"Not at all. That's because there is no survivorship scenario with vaccines. There are no deaths or injuries apart from a tiny percent of a percentage. 

There is a survivorship scenario WITHOUT vaccines, as the number of deaths that are attributed to lack of vaccination, especially recently in the case of measles, along with the proven false studies have people seeing their child survive measles without the vaccine as ""Evidence its not needed""

A lot of children DO die without vaccines, but none die that HAVE had that vaccination. Thats classic survivorship bias. ""my child survived, so that means vaccines are bad"" which is the same as saying ""i survived an accident without a seatbelt, thats proof that seatbelts are not needed"". It also works the other way, when a vaccinated child or adult gets the disease anyway, ""oh theres proof the vaccination doesnt work""
No, it just didn't work for that one person. Its exactly the same as dying in a car accident, even wearing a seatbelt. When you hear of deaths in car accidents you dont immediately go ""oh well thats evidence that seatbelts, airbags, safety features, abs and traction control don't work.""


YOU survived measles, or a car accident. Thats the ""Filter"" or survivorship bias. Instead of the entire pool of data, you are using one data point. Litereally ""ONE"" data point as a judgment for the entire pool.

The real kicker is that if vaccines caused autism there would be a LOT of adults with autism right now as everyone who is alive right now has been given plenty of different vaccines over the years. Survivorship bias would have been uncovered when 1 out of 10 people alive today would have been diagnosed with autism.

For example a few years before i went through kapooka they used to allow the range target control sections (the people who pulled the targets down, marked the shots, recorded, and then put the little yellow stickers back on the targets) to go downrange with live ammo until it was their turn to go back the mound and do their shoot.

A recruit, while down at the targets loaded his steyr with live magazine, put it into his mouth and shot himself. Any opportunity or occasion where recuits could get injured or killed even accidently was monitored and controlled heavily. Obviously after that event, no one was allowed to go downrange with live ammo anymore. No watching a live grenade go off even at a distance as catching a stray piece of shrapnel in the eye even at 200 meters was just too dangerous. 

Leaving the range was a big affair, with everyone's weapons, magazines, and webbing all double checked by the section corporal and the range safety officer. Once again due to someone taking a single live round back to the dorms and shooting themselves. Not only that but accidently mixing a live round with blank ammo was a recipe for disaster. To blank fire an steyr, a blanking pin was screwed into the end of the barrel, so firing into that with a bullet would be disastrous to both the firer, and anyone close by. 

Range safety was one of those things that no one ever fucked with, there was never any punitive or odd punishments, no horrific ""Boot"" treatment. If you found a live round and handed it in, it wasn't a big deal, you were thanked, and nothing ever happened. They treated us hard and harshly, but some shit was deadly serious, and ordance was the big one.

The austeyr has an underbarrel grenade launcher attachment and we never ever got a chance to use those, and we also never got a chance to fire the 9mm pistol, though that wasn't a big deal as the joke was it was more accurate to throw the pistol at an enemy then it was to shoot him. Apparently they were pretty horrific accuracy wise."

Basic training/boot camp is hell on you. On purpose of course. The aim is to get as much muscle memory, instinctive responses and fitness. Put it this way, due to the amount of physical work we did, the mess allocated 4 standard meals for all recruits. You were up at the crack of dawn, with your bottom sheet over your left shoulder. You had 15 minutes to shave, get dressed, make your bed and be standing outside your dorm room in camo. If someone didn't make it in time, the section leaders would go back in, tear everyones beds up and you had to do it again. 

Sometimes that did that just for kicks.  You wouldn't get to sleep till 10pm, at night it was weapons drills, cleaning weapons, your room, shining boots or brass, cleaning the dorms, or even the platoon HQ if it was your section's turn. You didn't get to sleep until HQ was shiny. If it was uncomfortable or hard, there is a chance you had to do it.  Wierd punishments were the standard. If you fucked up, often your section had was punished and you had to do nothing at all, which was way worse then if you fucked up and you had to the punishment.

Drop and give me 50, pretty common. Yelling ""YES CORPORAL"" until you lost your voice sucked until you got the hang of yelling. Dress inspections, getting all dressed up in your parade uniform, checking brass for scratches, making sure your dress boots were shiny, all part of it. It was brutal, hard and the aim was to break you out of your habits and ""remold"" you as an obedient fighting soldier in 13 weeks. 

I remember the very first day getting of the bus, and getting all your clothing and equipment issued, and then number 2 head shave for all the men, and pretty specific haircuts for the women. Some recruits would rock up with fucking golf clubs as they thought they would get some opportunity for R and R.. haha. R&R only ever happened after the first 6 weeks when you got your first leave into the city. In my case it was ""wagga wagga"" a hell hole of a town in the middle of nowhere. You would go crazy first up, get your cash, and waste the entire lot on booze or partying or even hookers, and then get carried back into the base. It was a fucking wild time. 

But yea, you ran on little sleep, coffee, and being yelled at. Not a lot of thinking happened when you were bordering on passing out half the time.  So you threw your grenade, watch it land next to a tyre or a target and your brain goes ""ooo i wonder how much damage it will do"" so you just look at it. I got yanked down the first time as well. 

Range control was in a tower about 50 meters back with a thick layer of bulletproof plastic/glass on the front, and i remember looking at that and seeing pockmarks. 

And grenades dont go ""boom"". its more of a ""CRACK"". Very little smoke from what i could see."
interestingasfuck,fdsigwa,t1_fdqd2u6,1578703370.0,"They aren't heavy but there is a specific way to throw one as its a ""process"" to pull the pin, check the pin, check the hole in the grenade top, look at the target, throw, etc. Its all done to form muscle memory. Thats what 99 percent of being a soldier is.. repeat repeat repeat until its instinctive. When i was in the army the weapons we had were F88 steyrs. I haven't seen/touched one for nearly 17 years now but im pretty sure i could still pick one up and do the weapon drills. Load, unload, safe, etc etc."
interestingasfuck,fdsiced,t1_fdqecrc,1578703303.0,"But thats not how to throw a grenade. You aim is to land the grenade as close as possible to the target, so you have to be looking at it when it lands. THEN look away and get to cover."
interestingasfuck,fdsi8dp,t1_fdqh26u,1578703242.0,"Yea they arent exactly ""locked"" into place. Whenever i see a movie/tv show with grenades being held up by the pin or looped using the pin rings i shudder. They are tight, but yea... no thanks."
interestingasfuck,fdsi5l1,t1_fdqhp7j,1578703199.0,"This is correct, there is actually a specific way to throw a grenade, and its to do with checking the hole. You pull the pin, and then have to look through the hole to make sure none of the pin has broken off inside. Its also where the spoon has to sit in your hand so it doesnt flick out, the spoon is palmwards."
interestingasfuck,fdsi1fj,t1_fdqi1xt,1578703135.0,"Yes we did, But its whole new ball game holding live ammunition/armaments. All us 18-19 year olds were still kinda half phased out at about half way through basic training. (13 weeks)"
interestingasfuck,fdshy2j,t1_fdqo24q,1578703085.0,"We had one guy try to break his arm by jamming it into his top bunk and then jumping off.

Had a girl try to drown herself. We had a few odd ones in our platoon.

The oddest was our bombardier. Two corporal chevrons right?

Don't ever dare call a bombardier a corporal.

""IM A BOMBARDIAR, NOT A CORPORAL! 10 LAPS IN THE PARADE GROUND NOW""

Ahh basic training."
interestingasfuck,fdshs94,t1_fdqrk0v,1578702997.0,"Its just reflex. You are drilled to keep your eye on the target, and weapon drills are always ""be aware"", ya know, whats around the target, whats BEHIND the target. 

So you are throwing something that is trying to kill a target, so you look at it to see how close you get. Then the instructor grabs your webbing and pulls you away because you know.. fucking grenade."

interestingasfuck,fdqbtv7,t1_fdqbp83,1578662379.0,"Its a bit heavier then anything you would expect to throw. I mean it's not hard, but you have this tendency to look at what you are throwing at to make sure the grenade landed where you wanted it to land, and you then look to see what damage it could do, its instinctive. Throwing something and then not looking where it landed is pretty hard to do. 

Go outside a throw a heavy rock at something, but then dont look where it lands."
