todayilearned,ffvnd6g,t1_ffvbl34,1580268209.0,"Hey thank you, this is all really interesting and helpful. Thanks for the kind words about the miscarriage. It happened the same day my parents (married for 35 years) split up. It was rough.

Since it's pretty uncommon it's been hard for me to find any good references, journals or articles about it that makes sense to me and my particular situation. Neither have many people in the medical field been able to answer my questions in a satisfactory manner when I go to a general practitioner. 

SO is the same for all three pregnancies. I wasn't sure about whether or not the risk factor increase with subsequent pregnancies for ABO incompatibility so I really appreciate knowing that. I'll sleep a little easier tonight and have one less thing to stress out about for my first prenatal exam. Bubs and I thank you! I'm definitely curious now to do further research into blood types going back further in the family."
todayilearned,ffv9j0n,t1_ffv3h2e,1580258889.0,"This is the best explanation I've received yet, thank you. I now completely understand which feels great. So much was going on during that time that there wasn't a lot of time for in depth understanding of some things as we triaged all the medical decisions to be made and info to sift thru."
todayilearned,ffv2fg6,t1_ffutyb9,1580254122.0,Thank you! So is this something the RhoGam shot I got should have helped with? They told me it was something similar but different.
todayilearned,ffv20d3,t1_ffutnn7,1580253854.0,"My daughter was my first live birth, I had a miscarriage at 14 weeks 3 years before she was born.

I have never received a blood transfusion. My SO is A+. Thank you, I really appreciate your input. I have no medical team ATM but will talk to the OB when I go in for my first prenatal. Any info & questions I have prepared beforehand will surely be helpful!"
povertyfinance,ffurz78,t3_ev70qe,1580248236.0,"Nice! I use the app Evernote for things like this and I looove it. (Hope it's ok to make a recommendation, the app has probably saved me thousands of dollars over my lifetime by helping me be more organized and being a quick reference guide to everything in my life that I choose to write down.)"
todayilearned,ffuq59o,t1_ffu6lan,1580247186.0,"Thanks for your offer to answer questions!

I am Rh negative and O-. My daughter is A+ when she was born (water broke at 28w and was airlifted to hospital, managed to stay pregnant until 30w5d). We were told we had a rare blood type disoder called ABO incompatibility.

She ended up needing a transfusion of O- blood to survive the jaundice from my blood attacking hers. We were in the hospital in NICU a long way from home for over 40 days. 

I was so busy just coping and getting through the whole thing that I still haven't quite figured out exactly what happened and why.

Why did my blood attack my daughter's? Since there is no shot like Rhogam to prevent this, do I need to be concerned about future pregnancies causing the same issue? Kind of like Rh incompatibility? 

Do I need to know / watch out for anything for my A+ preemie daughter related to blood transfusionsand blood products in the future? 

If she were to donate blood as an adult is there anything we would want to disclose about her blood, or any way it could affect someone else differently than standard A+ blood?

I just found out I'm pregnant again and  I probably need to think about this and understand a bit more about my weird blood type and how it might affect future pregnancies this time. 

Do all O- pregnant women with A+ babies have a risk of ABO incompatibility? Are there any other rare blood type incompatibility disorders like Rh- and ABO that happen?

Thanks!"

This one also left out a bunch of dirty dishes  on a shelf in the common room...apparently thinking I'm going to wash them for her every day? Even though she has her own dishwashing sink and supplies?

I went ahead and allowed them to keep the reservation if they paid our pet fee, even though I could have canceled and kept the funds since they broke the house rules. 

I have a feeling however that this is going to be one of those ""no good deed goes unpunished"" experiences. Getting ready for a long 3 days and nights."

It literally takes 5 min to call and cancel with no penalty to anyone if the host has already stated it in the notes. The host offered in good faith to reschedule. If the host cancels, it wil negatively impact them if they have to cancel, and might lose money. It has literally no impact on the guest to cancel if they've stated they will do a full refund, or if the guest cancels 7 days or more beforehand.
