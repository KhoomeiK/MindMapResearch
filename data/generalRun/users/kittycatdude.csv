Of course my teacher casually said ""what, you got a little radio in your head or something?"" And that triggered me. Cheater cheater pumpkin eater."

Rochester,ffiw4fh,t1_ffirtqh,1579984132.0,"I did when I was in 1st grade, in 1995, when Midtown was still open. And damn, even as a 1st grader, that damn monorail was so small and cramped. I'll never forget it."
AskReddit,ffivjey,t1_ffi1w7r,1579983732.0,"I personally love the very end of Lisa's First Word when Maggie takes out her pacifier after Homer puts her to sleep and she says her first word, ""Daddy"" before falling asleep. 

Absolutely NOTHING beats the first 8 seasons. That show could really pull on the heartstrings when you least expected it. And Homer clearly loved his children but ... he's Homer."
AskReddit,ffiv8c3,t3_etqf2g,1579983536.0,"The series finale of Middle. I remember sobbing at the very end because I watched it from day 1 and it was the perfect ending. The thing that really got me was when Axl, Sue and Brick were sitting in the car the night before Axl left to live in Denver, talking about how it's hard to say goodbye, and the 3 of them fell asleep in the car together. Also, the very end when it showed all the rooms in their house as Frankie narrates . . . ""We never won the lottery or redid the wallpaper or fixed the hole in the wall or got a new washing machine but for everything we had, we felt very fortunate."" 

A very underrated gem of a show."

AskReddit,ffhw6as,t1_fffnbhb,1579956648.0,Lol reminds me of the Spongebob movie when they sneak into that Thug Tug bar. But in this case it was a speakeasy casino.
AskReddit,ffh2c3k,t3_etjlsy,1579921220.0,"Every year on my birthday my mom makes me Duncan Hines marble cake. With homemade vanilla frosting. So delicious. Store-bought cake on my birthday just doesn’t cut it. But sometimes I’ll make an exception. 

The taste of the frosting and the slightly bitter taste of the food coloring mixed in always reminds me of my birthday, and the fact that summer is right around the corner."
MensRights,ffgbhj5,t1_ffg9h9r,1579902583.0,Yeah it’s honesty disgusting. They don’t care as long as she’s super attractive
MensRights,ffflrbq,t1_fferv3m,1579886700.0,"Yeah I don’t understand how it’s even worth it anymore. I feel like I’m always hearing about another wedding, like every other week. My cousin went to 10 weddings a couple years ago. I guess most guys are just incredibly desperate."
Rochester,fffl8h5,t1_ffe5on2,1579886378.0,"I remember a couple years ago, the answer to the final Jeopardy was Eeyore from Pooh. And Alex pretty much gave it away by doing an Eeyore impression. I think another time, the question was “this A.A. Milne character is the only female character in the series of stories” which is obviously Kanga. But some people may not remember that Milne is Pooh’s author.

I actually guessed Susan B. Anthony as well."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fff6gma,t3_esvoln,1579876923.0,"Not sure how relevant this is but when gay marriage became legal all over the USA, I used the rainbow flag filter on my FB profile and a former friend of mine put the crossed out rainbow flag symbol as a comment and made all these homophobic religious comments. His brother actually called him out for being an asshole and the comments got deleted thankfully but I would’ve preferred an apology to my face instead of a half assed “sorry for the comments” reply. But it is better than nothing I suppose. 

But I still don’t talk to him anymore, for other reasons."
