schizophrenia,ff0fnbr,t3_er0sx1,1579468435.0,Some depression is very treatment resistant. It’s not your fault. Look into Ketamine infusion therapy if you can. It is gaining attention for treating resistant depression. I have heard wonderful feedback about it.
depression,feyfcm7,t1_fews0ls,1579444759.0,I knew I was in trouble when the thought of a future scared me more than dying.
depression,feyf2ou,t1_fewh0fm,1579444635.0,"I feel this majorly. I was going to kill myself after my birthday in October. I made the mistake of confiding in family about how I felt. They convinced me to get a med change and see a new Dr. since I was unhappy with current treatment. Then I got in a car accident. Wasn’t hurt, but car was totaled. Then turned 26 and lost health coverage I had from my dad’s job (who I really don’t even have contact with.) So I have no car and am detoxing off meds and my family is all too ready to let me know what a bother it is to take me to work while I save for a new car. It’s about to put me over the edge."
depression,feydp2i,t3_eqndfm,1579444202.0,"Yes but it gets me in trouble. That’s the beginning. If I nurse that demon, it will grow. If I can fight off the urge to go back to sleep and hide in the beginning, it doesn’t get as bad. Preventative measures work best for me. Once I’m in a pit, climbing out is exhausting and their is no telling how long I’ll be down. I’ve lost months because I chose escapism. The fear and memory of how bad it has gotten in the past is usually motivation enough to just get up and deal with things....and then smoke afterward ;)
I’m trying to be the person I needed other people to be for me. I’m trying not to disappoint or hurt myself. I’m trying to be my own best friend."
drugstoreMUA,fevb5el,t3_eqcl9h,1579395314.0,I agree. But normally Ulta is cheaper by a dollar or two and you can collect points for money off. I prefer going there and using the app to track my points to pair with sales.
Hair,fevan5e,t1_fetibk9,1579395174.0,"When I would put extensions in, they go in layers. So the effect looks very blended. Picture natural hair between rows of extensions. If you layer enough it ends up looking like your hair is blended together in subtle layers."
depression,feva5qt,t3_eqc4g7,1579395000.0,I’ll always talk. I’m the lonely-in-a-crowded-room type and feel alienated and alone quite often. Here to talk to anyone who I don’t have to fake happy to. I’ll be here <3

femalehairadvice,fev6x9o,t3_eqgyih,1579393813.0,"Yes, possibly even better. Beware of showering in hot water and shampooing too often to avoid fast fade out ðŸŒˆ"
depression,fep3u20,t1_feni7g7,1579311523.0,Love Dope Lemon.
femalehairadvice,fenc3q8,t3_epu4e2,1579281501.0,"I say go for it. Youâ€™d look beautiful and it would likely encourage you to try other new things as well. Itâ€™s very feisty looking. I kind of thought this was already a before and after of you and was ready to congratulate you before reading the whole post! 
Iâ€™ve had a pixie before and they require some maintenance, the neck hair grows in pretty fast. And when you want to transition to a longer style, I advise keeping the back short while you grow the front first to take it into an asymmetrical bob. I wish I had known that because mine looked like a bad mullet while it grew out XD. 
But in conclusion, itâ€™s a yes from me dawg."
depression,fekbcl6,t1_feibdax,1579196493.0,Wow thanks so much <3 that hit me for some reason
femalehairadvice,fe3i6nz,t3_enogrx,1578849465.0,Beautiful no matter what. Bangs draw attention away from your eyes in the pic tho. So it just depends on what features you prefer to highlight.
Ghoststories,fbws3xt,t3_eenl0g,1577157960.0,"It makes sense it began happening after a divorce because shadow people often do. They are drawn to children experiencing difficult family situations and dysfunction.
I had a hat man as a child and also had an abusive Dad in my childhood home. Hat man followed me into adulthood but recently left- I think it was a year or two ago a medium confirmed he was gone. Likely because I began to heal from the past and burn some bridges."
