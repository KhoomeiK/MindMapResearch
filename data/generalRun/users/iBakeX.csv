2. You're racist.
3. My father has actually lost his house to the fires... So... Thanks.
4. You're an asshole.
5. I'm sorry, I was working, I actually wasn't reading your bs, or down voting you, I didn't have time. Does that hurt? Someone not paying attention to you? Because they have better things to do? Does it remind you of your childhood? Look at this doll, point to the place on the doll where mummy touched you.
6. Stop inviting me to chat. It's the last thing I would do even if I wasn't busy.
7. Stop forcing your opinion on others.
8. The irony of calling someone or their actions childish when you don't know them. (Sounds immature to me)
9. How angry did you get about being down voted, you brought that up, like a lot. If you don't like it when you're being down voted when you're an ass, go back to Facebook.
10. Boomer suits you.
11. Judgmental much? If you actually think you're better than anyone, take a hard look at yourself.
12. And this one is just my perspective. Take it or leave it. I think you have some stability issues and I think you need to seek help.

It's not the best idea to get yourself beat up on when you have depression. But that's the kind of mindset people with depression have.
It's hard to break out of that train of thought, Fortunately for me, I've never needed to see the validation of my inner thoughts during my darker parts of my life?

At the same time, depression isn't just mindset, it's trying to get that 200 pound gorilla of depression that stifles your breathing off your chest, its that energy vampire that makes it hard to physically go out and do anything because it is actually hard, it's the guilt knowing you should see your friends and family because there's ""nothing stopping you"" even though it feels like the gorilla and that vampire are physically holding you back.

That's why cbt isn't suggested as much as medication is... Because it's hard to move forward, while your own energy is stopping you.
