AskReddit,fgs2bgk,t3_f07em9,1581067924.0,Ok it’s not a movie but I can’t count the number of times I had to pause When They See Us to cry for a few minutes. And I mean sobbing. Not just a few tears.

AskReddit,fgruqf1,t3_f06nuy,1581058293.0,Probably one of my travel stories. Got busted in the hostel so we went to a frisbee golf course by the lake. Almost got caught again so we hid behind one of the buildings. Ended up being a really good time
AskReddit,fgruk9d,t1_fgrtyfs,1581058114.0,"I would definitely start with the prolonged (but not staring!!) eye contact, and if possible get a seat close to her. Give a little smile, look away, look back, see if she’s reciprocating. If all systems go and she seems to be into it, go for a lighthearted joke. Someone already said it but “do you come here often?” Is the perfect amount of cheese.  Just be cool and confident. Go with the flow. If she doesn’t seem to be into it, back off. Public transport can be really shitty for women sometimes."

AskWomen,fgru0z5,t3_f04miw,1581057555.0,"I’ve met way more people through dating apps, but it’s usually casual, or if I’m being honest just doesn’t end well. I find meeting people in real life yields similar results but that’s probably on me a little bit because I meet most people at bars where I’m drunk and usually have one thing on my mind. I would like to meet people organically but honestly it’s kind of hard"
AskWomen,fgrtu4b,t3_f057rq,1581057355.0,"Always remember that if you don’t want to wear makeup, you don’t have to. There are other things you can do such a skin care, getting your eyebrows shaped, and eyelash tints/extensions. If it is something you do want to get into then just start at square one. I started with tinted bb cream and light eye makeup, then moved to foundation and a lil bit of contour and lil bit more eye makeup"

AskReddit,fgophiw,t3_ezewgo,1580980133.0,"I was a really temperamental kid. I was angry all the time and threw tantrums regularly. I don’t even know why I did it, but when I was probably about 7 my dad did something to piss me off so I took the best and one of few pictures of my dad and I and cut it up.
