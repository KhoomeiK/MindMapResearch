Speaking from experience, though I ACTED much mature than I really was, I truly was a kid and I missed a lot and I had to confront the problems it caused to me mentally later on through therapy.

Just because you acknowledge someone is a kid doesn't mean that you are being condescending or ""don't get it"". Plenty of kids are very smart and very mature. They're still kids, though and it's important not to forget that. I'm saying that as a person who works with kids too.

In my experience kids who get angry at being referred to as a kid(Not condescended to mind you, but simple recognized as a child) usually aren't that mature. Might I indulge them? Sure, I might tell them that they're very grown or not refer to them as such in their presence if they were truly bothered by it. But are they still a kid? The answer is yes."

worldnews,feip21e,t1_feikx4h,1579143698.0,"?? I don't understand your point. The civil war was waged nearly 200 years ago over the ability to own slaves.

Not only that, but the southern United States have not made any sort of effort to assert themselves as independent or seccede from the United States since the end of the civil was war. 

Additionally, as I stated before, Taiwan has their own government, leaders, currency, language, and culture. They pretty much ARE already independent aside from China refusing to acknowledge it. 

This situation would be like if the States magically made a law that Canada was part of the United states and then asserted to everyone on an international level that Canada is part of the United States despite Canada having it's own government and currency and functioning entirely separate from the American government.

todayilearned,fdqfv4g,t1_fdqeh1t,1578665619.0,"I live in Japan. Native English speaker. I really do find it weird how being perfectly fluent in English is a baseline requirement in the states. Especially since living in a foreign country and trying every day to study, learning another language doesn't come easily in the slightest. It's something I didn't pay mind to much when I was younger but now I have a totally different opinion on. 

My experiences in Japan range pretty wildly. I've have had people get exasperated and annoyed when I couldn't keep up with native level conversation. I've had people turn me away and say ""no English!"" even when I was clearly speaking in Japanese. I've had people merely nervous to speak to me because they didn't know if I could speak Japanese or not. I've had people simply try to accommodate me and converse with me as normal as possible, and of course, I've had the people who applaud and go ""AMAZING!"" as soon as I utter ""konnichiwa"". 

I would say either extreme has it's draw backs and strong points. The annoyed people make me really wish to study more so that I can understand more and maybe avoid annoying more people in the future. The people who are quick to go ""oh, AMAZING!"" are encouraging and I appreciate the good place that they are coming from but it does ultimately come off as patronizing after a while, and again, it makes me wish to study more. 

Then again, idk if there will ever be a point where I'm not othered because I'm clearly some random white girl living in the country side so I will always be different. But maybe one day there will be a point where people aren't constantly drawing attention to my lack of or abundance of language ability. 

That's the only good thing I can think of for America in that sense. If you can speak English, people don't constantly draw attention to the fact that you can, in fact, speak English.
