JUSTNOMIL,fgm6wme,t1_fgm5jhe,1580919096.0,Completely cutting someone off over a small amount of bad behavior seems like overkill. You have to tell people why you're upset and give them room to change. Silently stewing until you blow up and cut all ties is not healthy behavior.
JUSTNOMIL,fgm4mvf,t3_ezbaag,1580917906.0,"She was bluffing, she didn't think your hubs would let her leave. Her crying was trying to manipulate him into begging her to stay. 

Might be best to wait a week or so before contacting her. You and hubs should sit down and discuss what you want to say to her. Write a list of bullet points to use when having the convo. 

From your posts, it seems like she's overstepped, but nothing that she can't recover from with good behavior. Just make it clear to her that you both love her, and want your child to have a good relationship with grandma, but she does not get to overrule mom and dad."

JUSTNOMIL,fglvobx,t3_ez9zrn,1580912051.0,"Well done! I'd reserve judgement until she straightens up her behavior. Instant forgiveness is not available.

By the way, a [hair tourniquet](https://www.healthline.com/health/hair-tourniquet) is a thing. It's not super common, but a piece of hair can get wrapped around a finger/toe/penis and cause issues. It's one of those things that just being aware it's possible makes it less likely to happen, because you'll know to check for it if the baby is fussing."
