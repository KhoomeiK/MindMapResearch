>! Wow, this book made me angry on an almost Lolita-esque scale.

Admittedly, I did enjoy the first 10%. But then I quickly realised that it was pretentious twaddle, sloppily written with two of the most unlikeable characters I've ever come across in a book. Clare, in particular, is just a slightly-more-literary Bella Swan. A completely codependent waste of space. <spoiler>Who also happens to fuck <b>her best friend's husband</b> not once, but twice! What a vile human being.</spoiler>

Incredibly pretentious, with its constant name-dropping of cool & obscure bands, German poetry, French whatever ... but with all of this supposed intelligence, it was commented twice that Henry's mother looked Italian, but was actually Jewish. It's a religion, not a nationality. Good God.

And honestly, the parts with Henry meeting the younger Clare are downright creepy, and reeked of Lolita. But hey, it's ok that a thirty-eight year old is cavorting with a six/twelve/thirteen year old, and it's fine for a forty-three year old to have sex with an eighteen year old because at some point, they end up married! And this is a great love story! <b>NO.</b> Just no. No!

I understand the love for this book and its ""great love story"" as much as I understand the love for Twilight and its ""great love story"", which is to say, not at all. I gave zero fucks what happened to anyone in this book.!<

I hope the spoiler tags worked, I’m on mobile and haven’t tried them before. There are only vague spoilers in there but just in case.

I just copied the review so it has the GR html too ... sorry about that!"

suggestmeabook,fgfu6ls,t1_fgft8fm,1580747691.0,"It’s not irrational - it’s perfectly justified! I still hate The Alchemist more, but this is a very close second, and the only book that has ever made me this angry, even now, years later."
suggestmeabook,fgfsk4z,t3_ey686w,1580746659.0,"The Alchemist. I’m not usually a judgemental person, but when I see someone recommend that book, I judge. Absolute trash."
suggestmeabook,fgfsh5y,t1_fgflmn8,1580746607.0,I envy you. I wish I hadn’t finished it!
suggestmeabook,fgfs5sa,t1_fgfpixc,1580746400.0,I just replied to another comment naming this book and mentioned that I get angry just thinking about it. I hate this book with a passion. Vile. I wish I could read that blog piece!!
suggestmeabook,fgfrhf4,t1_fgfd3gk,1580745962.0,"Yes! I have a violent hatred for this book. The characters were truly awful, and their relationship was problematic at best. Ooh I get fired up just thinking about it."
llama,fg7u65a,t3_exdvnp,1580601541.0,Adorable!!
