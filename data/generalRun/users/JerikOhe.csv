bestof,ff9h565,t1_ff9bond,1579712910.0,Thats a whole interesting subject on its own. Was birth control common? How hard was it to get and stay pregnant long enough to show? Did people actually drink abortion concoctions that were basically poison?

writing,ff7fggk,t3_es106q,1579648325.0,"I've seen it done a few times in a litrpg book. When it works, its funny. When it doesn't, it feels lame. On a whim I added a joke about my character being chased and entering an elevator, trying to find a hatch to get out of the elevator, and being disappointed that tv/movies had let him down that its not a real thing (in my setting anyway). Whether it will make the final draft is up in the air and depends on the final pacing of the scene."

Mostly death and 0 kills. Good game

I'm not saying going back to buttons is the answer and I don't know what the next input method will be, but holy crap i cant wait for it to get here."
