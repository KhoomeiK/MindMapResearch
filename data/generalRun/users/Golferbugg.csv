You wouldn't believe the kinds of misdiagnoses and mistreatments that happen.  Also, a yearly physical or the like is unlikely to catch something like this.  The best you can (and should) expect is a referral to an optometrist or ophthalmologist for an exam for any concerns.  We recommend minimum yearly eye exams for all people, including infants, even if there aren't any problems or concerns btw."
todayilearned,fdpn6n3,t1_fdou46b,1578633450.0,"Optometrist here. Just for clarification, the difference in refractive error between the eyes is called anisometropia.  A little bit is normal and fine.  When there's a large difference (4+ diopters), you also get what's called aniseikonia, which is a significant difference in the image size each eye perceives through glasses due to the fact that lenses for farsightedness also magnify objects while lenses for nearsightedness minify. So even if each eye is clear (no ""lazy eye""), it can be hard for the eyes to work together.  At 27, my guess is you don't actually have a cataract(s), but they suggested what's called a clear lens exchange which could fix the aniso and is essentially the same procedure as cataract surgery.  A good alternative for a lot of people is contacts because you get MUCH less aniseikonia.  All that said, surgery or contacts won't directly/retroactively fix any amblyopia (aka ""lazy eye"", aka your best-corrected vision is reduced even with glasses/contacts) because even though anisometropia can cause amblyopia, the damage is in the brain-not the eye itself- and the older you get the more permanent it is.  You can have both amblyopia and aniseikonia of course, but with significant amblyopia, any aniseikonia is usually not that important because you're only really using the better eye anyway. Also, having any surgery on your good eye is at least a little bit risky so it's usually not worth it if you're just fixing theoretical aniso but the patient still has the amblyopia.  Therefore, I usually recommend clear lens exchange only for patients with significant anisometropia/aniseikonia but without concurrent amblyopia and who aren't good candidates for contacts."

LifeProTips,fcmanzt,t1_fckpt9k,1577768864.0,"I'm an optometrist. We bill medical insurances all the time, though i'm not in a hospital setting.  I don't see how paying cash could ever be beneficial over insurance. As far as I know, the billed price legally has to be the same regardless of whether it's private pay or filed to insurance.  
Generally, the clinic sets their fees for each service at (or very slightly above) the maximum allowable fee that the insurances they accept dictate.  That amount is billed to insurance, and the insurance company says ""we're paying you the agreed upon amount only (which is the same or slightly less than your usual and customary fee), and you can't charge our client the difference bc they're in the club"".  If you just pay out of pocket, you have to pay the full usual and customary fee. Adjusting the fee depending on insurance or lack thereof is illegal.  You also don't get the benefit of what you pay going toward meeting your deductible, which could help you later in the year.   Now, I've heard of doctors using different, rarely used examination codes with a lower fee for cash patients for the same type of exam, though I think this is technically also illegal and would only apply to the exam itself, not any ordered testing or procedures.

Edit:  Before the ACA, you could be charged more in the future if your insurance company knew you had preexisting conditions, so that might be a situation where just paying cash would be beneficial in a sense.  Fortunately, that's not a problem anymore...for now."
