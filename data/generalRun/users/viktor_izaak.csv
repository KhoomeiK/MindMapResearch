adultsurvivors,fdhoezz,t3_elf65n,1578426932.0,"While this is valid  don't feel obligated to self loath.  Many people are truly affected to the core about this type of situation. If you are not like that, I would just accept what happen and move forward.  

For a bonus, I would still open the conversation with him and make sure he is not doing it to anyone else.  If he is push him on getting help."

abuse,fcajq4k,t3_egugfv,1577570514.0,"It seems the ""kid"" is emotionally unavailable. You wouldn't want to take a step back and just be a friend? Depending on where you are emotionally and in life, I would evaluate if this is something to pursue as he has been ""caught"" at an age where he was highly impressionable. Though I would try to help him in opening his eyes knowing this will be a nasty uphill battle.


Side note, public shaming can do the trick too if you know who he is."
