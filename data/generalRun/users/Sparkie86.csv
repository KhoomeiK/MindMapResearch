You can get 3 lbs of bacon ends and pieces for about 10 bucks. You can break it down into 5-6 packages. Each package will season up a pot of beans and make them very, very tasty and enjoyable to eat.

Additionally, you can use those packages to make carbonara as well. With 1 LB of pasta it comes out to about 5 dollars and you can get 2-4 meals depending on your appetite. I'm a fat ass so I only get 2 :).

In the first couple pages of the code, a ""qualified individual"" is defined as someone who has knowledge, experience and training to install and safely install and perform work on electrical systems and everything that goes with it.

There are licensed electricians that work on all of the equipment at our aircraft facilities here in Kansas. They are all union. I've worked on packaging machines, pumping systems, plastics systems.

The work of electricians encompasses much, much more than just ""wiring buildings"". Also, substations are their own breed, and it isn't necessarily electricians doing the work there, but often linemen. There is overlap in that particular field.

SuicideWatch,fet3ax2,t1_fes9oec,1579371395.0,"I agree with you here. OP is 17 years old, which could almost be old enough to leave the house. Right now, you don't want to fight with them. So don't fight with them. Accept that they always seem to be critical of you and judge you. You can't change their behavior.

Learning to accept that you can't change how someone feels or thinks of you is just a part of life. Some people won't like you. Some people will have these opinions of you that will never change. Sometimes it just isn't your fault.

There could easily be more to this story, and there likely is, but I understand where you are coming from. My family started heavily judging me when I was about 18 because I failed to live up to their expectations of me. What I did was leave home at 17, and ended up telling my family to go to hell and didn't speak with them for around 2 years over it.

We did make up after that time, and I did manage to earn their respect. I still remember that moment. I saw my aunt at a cafe, and she said she loved me and then started lecturing me. I told her, ""The reason I don't come around any more is because you always bitch at me for stuff and lecture me. It is easier to not come around than to deal with your shit."" That put a stop to that from my entire family. Except my cousins and grandfather who never placed that judgement on me in the first place.

Another place where this lesson comes into play is at jobs. Sometimes you work for assholes. You can't help it, you need the job. Sometimes you work with assholes. You can't help it, you need the job. So you know what you do? You grit your teeth, you swallow your pride, and you deal with it. You also start looking for another job. You know why? Because being miserable and having an income is better than being miserable because you don't have an income.

Then, you start thinking about your exit plan. How you are going to find another job. You don't bad mouth your current job to your new employer, just as you don't bad mouth your parents to everyone. In both cases that relationship is what it is.

TLDR; Be assertive. You don't have to ""debate"" to do that. You don't have to ""argue"" to do that. You just have to express your displeasure, then move on. If it does no good to express your displeasure and move on, and whoever keeps harping on it, then you agree, as above, and move on. Keep your eyes on the road ahead and formulate an exit plan to get away from toxic behavior. NO ONE has the right to make you feel like shit. NO ONE has the right to make you miserable. YOU have the right to exclude that from your life. That being said, you also have to accept those consequences. Rarely is it worthwhile to put up with someone that makes you miserable indefinitely. This is a universal truth of life."

They put the effort into forming a clear and coherent vision of the project, and then inspire others to jump on that bandwagon in order to focus the collective energies of the community. In this way, they have managed to begin identifying areas that need improvement, and tackling them in a thoughtful manner, so as to create as few new problems as possible.

What I see in posts from the KDE community, particularly involving Plasma is a very shrewd application of the principal of Kaizen - continuous improvement."

PLC,fcbrfa6,t1_fcbjyzy,1577590138.0,"If I'm not mistaken, air being compressible makes it non-linear, making it much more difficult to control. You need something a bit more advanced than a basic PID, so unless you figure in that non-linearity, you will never get it working like you intend. That being said, I really hope I'm wrong on that one, as I'm no expert by any means."
PLC,fcbfh83,t3_egwg8p,1577586214.0,"Out of curiosity here, does the compressibility of air have any effect on this process?"
PLC,fcahv2b,t3_egtzc4,1577569512.0,"You pretty much have it right. You make a memory structure that mirrors your IO, such as an integer per IO slot. Each bit there corresponds to an IO state. You then use subroutines like so:

1. Copy each input to memory
2. Run logic on inputs
3. Copy outputs to memory

I also recommend putting a bit on each rung to disable the copying of the input or writing of the output. This allows you to test regardless of the state of the physical IO."

usenet,fc4lt9l,t1_fc2t9b0,1577420469.0,This is your problem. You are using external usb media. Those file IO operations are probably causing your issues. Use sata hard drives and perhaps use a pci network adapter.
