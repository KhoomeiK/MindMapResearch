Did you like any of your prerequisites more than others? Math, english, etc.

There's so many options, why did you want to be a doctor? Why is it the only one you thought of? You could literally go into your college website and look at all your options. Maybe you'd prefer healthcare management, if that aligns with your life goals.

Maybe take an extra semester and look at exploratory classes to find out what you prefer based on what you liked in the past. If not then just go with a safe option that your at least okay at and move on from there, for example finance or accounting if your good with numbers. Many people don't end up doing what they majored in college. 

You can also try online tests that can give you ideas of what you'd like based on your answers to certain questions. I did https://www.onetonline.org/help/onet/mynextmove."

The people around you that look passionate are most likely not, they just know how to pretend so they can get promoted or not fired. I did this for years, still do. I suggest you leave your work at work and start building a life you want outside of work. If you want a new challenge look for one in your hobbies or non work life. Stop making your hobbies about money and look for something that will give you satisfaction upon completion or just in the act of doing said activity."

Instead of having multiple chairs all over you can have this as an end table or something like that, then when you have guests over that you cannot accomodate on your current furniture you can pull this out and they can sit.

FinancialPlanning,ffbokei,t3_esmwy8,1579775855.0,"Sorry this is so long.

You should definitely have a job before you move out. Is public transportation an option? A bike? Walking? I did this for my first job 45 min one way, but it was a city. Or a scooter? I have one now, all I needed was my regular license and insurance to register it although this varies depending on your  state, you may not need to register one at all. Or if you have a bike you can put a motor on it although I would check local laws to make sure it's legal.

So it sounds like your getting your own apartment and then getting a roomate. I suggest you rent a room instead and avoid signing a lease, usually rooms will be a month to month agreement. This will allow you to get comfortable paying rent and stuff outside your current home without committing to a long term lease. Renting a room usually includes all utilities so you may not have to worry about that. Also, less furniture you have to buy to fill up your space, as the part mentioned will most likely already be furnished.

Look into lowering the cell phone bill, that seems high. 

I would raise food up to 250.

Include a clothing category, even if it's just saving 10 a month because you don't want to be in a bind if you need to buy a pair of shoes or a coat.

Car. If your father is paying for the car then your set, but you'd have to talk to him about that as car payments can vary wildly. I recommend you push towards getting a fully paid off used car. Your future self will thank you. You will need insurance and a rainy day fund. Insurance is usually for the entire year or 6 months, and you can pay in full or monthly. In Texas for my car I paid 60 a month and when I moved back to NY it more than doubled to 130 a month. This will vary depending what state you are in and the vehicle that is insured and you. You NEED a rainy day fund for your car to use for oil changes, if your car breaks down, if you need new tires, registration, general maintenance, etc. I would budget this as part of your car category so you don't redistribute later on to cover other expenses.

Ideally you would want 3 to 6 months expenses saved to move out that you wouldn't touch except for emergencies. So if you can swing that awesome. If not you would want what is asked of you when you sign and an additional month in your savings. Usually to rent an apartment you will be required to pay first month, last month, and security deposit which is usually 1 month, up front when signing. If you rent a room, it's usually  the first month and 1 month security deposit, up front. Many people live month to month  on expenses which seems to be how you budgeted yourself out, but I don't recommend this.

I would budget 500/1000 to furnish your bedroom/apartment, respectively, although you can definitely do it on much less if you get things second hand or just don't buy expensive things, unless you know the specific things you want then you can just go online, research, and make a list with a price next to it. For example you can get a desk for about 40 on amazon. You can get a bed frame for under 80 and a foam mattress for under 200. Or you can go on sites like Letgo and get the stuff secondhand for a much better price, but if you do just remember to get it for less than half of the original price and that its in good condition because if not then you may as well buy a new one and save yourself the hassle. I always feel kind of proud about this part because I got everything that is currently in my room right now for about 60 (a bed, a tall bookshelf, and two ikea pax wardrobe, and all in almost brand new condition). I just put in less than sixty and the muscle to move it. Getting a secondhand bed is kinda iffy so be very careful, mine was a unique situation, where it was literally brand new, plastic still on, out of the box. Also, can you not take your current furniture with you?

Make sure to read your lease or agreement before you sign. Depending what state/city you live in there are certain requirements and things you should be aware of that may affect you long term, for example in yonkers ny, if you pay late the lessee can only charge 50 or 5% of monthly rent as late fee and if they raise your rent they can only do it by a certain amount or they have to give you like 1 to 3 months to move out. That's where I'm from but it can be completely different where you are, so just read the agreement and do some basic local research so you know what you are getting yourself into. 

You are missing your future from your bugdet.

What are your plans, where do you want to be a year from now, 5 years? Do you want to continue school or get a certificate and move up at work, or go into a line of work where you don't need all that? You should budget out future expenses. Your budget should ideally look like 50/30/20 of your net income (after taxes and health insurance), 50% for needs, 30% for wants, 20% savings, future, and debt. Of course you'll find other percentage breakdowns online but this is roughly it. I try to aim for 40/30/30, but i live in ny. You should find a tracker such as ynab or a free one to track your expenses, you can actually just do this on an Excel sheet too. Go to r/personalfinance and read up on the faq. I also found r/ynab a really great way to help me learn about budgeting and what to expect such as saving up for those big purchases that only come once a year, holidays, birthdays, etc. You don't have to buy the product I just found the subreddit and website helpful. Also when looking towards your future you may be interested in r/financialindependence. I only add that because I wish I had been introduced to it at your age."
childfree,ffbjhw1,t3_esjl9w,1579768228.0,"How big are the rooms? Size of bedroom1, bedroom 2 and living room?

Is one of the rooms large? She can put up a fake wall and make a third room out of the larger room. Or make the living room a third bedroom or part of the living room. I guess you'd need to know the size but if she can find a 7x7 space or larger somewhere and put up a fake wall she should be able to accomodate. So for example if the larger bedroom is 14x14 you can just split it. Also it doesn't have to be even, the space can be 6×10 or 6×9 or something like that. Honestly, if I were you I'd pay for the fake wall before even considering taking one of those kids into my home. This is actually done quite often in bigger cities to accomodate extra roommates to lower the per person rent.

baking pans, my mother was a proffessional baker and she has so many pans so when I want to bake I'll make two of whatever (cake, brownie, lasagna), one to keep and one to return with the pan;

I also borrow from other places like the library. Why pay $15 for dvd I will likely watch maybe 1 or 2 a year, when I can borrow it from and save money in the process. Also do this with books I will read only once. If I love the book and will reread several times, I'll buy it."

nutrition,f82rrwm,t1_f81mpdx,1574196965.0,"White Chicken Chili Recipe 
https://addapinch.com/white-chicken-chili-recipe/

I found this year's ago so I've changed it a bit. 

White Bean Chicken Chili

4 Skinless, Boneless Chicken Breasts
4 Cups Chicken Stock
1 (15-oz) can white beans with liquids from beans
1 Clove Garlic Minced (I changed it to 2 tsp minced garlic because I buy it minced)
1 medium yellow onion, diced
1 cup green tomatilllo salsa, aka salsa verde
2 Limes, juice only
2 teaspoon dried oregano,
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt (although now I just do it to taste, don't measure)

Add chicken and chicken stock to pot. Cook chicken thoroughly, about 15 minutes. 
Set flame on low and remove chicken, shred chicken, small. Add chicken back to pot. Add white beans. Add all other ingredients. Simmer for 10 minutes. Taste test at 5 minutes, adjust if needed, and then I try a spoonful at 10 min, when it's done.

I'm sure my changes have changed the calories but this has helped me lose 50 lbs, so I don't think it changes much, or maybe it's made it better. I've noticed my local supermarket has huge chicken breasts so depending on the size (and sometimes if I want it more soupy) I'll use 2 or 3 chicken breasts. Also depending on the week I will add another can of beans, like if I know I will be doing more physical activity or if I get sick of eggs for a little and want to switch them out for a protein shake 2 or 3 days a week. I hate beans but I love this chilli and it keeps me full so I can avoid snacks and sweets."
