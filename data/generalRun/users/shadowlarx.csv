Greenlantern,ffg0hb7,t1_fffy9jz,1579895799.0,"Kyle had a ring in Rebirth because he was still the primary Lantern at the time as Hal was still the Spectre, Guy was still Warrior and John was with the JLA. As for him being Ion in SCW, as I explained, he became Ion in the pages of Infinite Crisis and I do recommend reading it but not because Kyle became Ion. That is a relatively minor plot point, all things considered. In fact, without giving away too much regarding the plot of the Green Lantern story going forward, Kyle became Ion in Infinite Crisis mostly to set up what happens to Ion in SCW and what that means for Kyle and the Corps going forward. What that means exactly is explored through the rest of SCW so I’ll say no more until you’ve finished that tale."
Greenlantern,fffrqmd,t3_etbbhm,1579890366.0,"Kyle became Ion (again) during the events of Infinite Crisis. You don’t really need to know the how or why so much for the GLC story going forward but you do need to remember the name Ion going forward, for reasons that will shortly be revealed in SCW and which will be expanded on in the events leading up to Blackest Night and through Brightest Day and beyond."
Arrowverse,ff9udaf,t3_es5cpq,1579721544.0,"I love LoT. Arrow can get a little dramatic. The Flash, while originally the ‘fun’ opposite of Arrow, can get a little mopey. Supergirl leans a little to hard into the politics. Batwoman, too soon to tell. But Legends, while it started slow, became a lot of fun. Last season, especially, was just pure fun and zaniness. Only on Legends, for example, can you see Biff Tannen serenade a Minotaur or see Ray playing Jenga with Vandal Savage. When the other Arrowverse shows get a little dark and gritty and brooding, you know that you can always count on the crew of the Waverider to make things fun again."

Arrowverse,ff4zofh,t1_ff4nhu6,1579576347.0,"[Here](https://www.dccomics.com/comics/batman-‘66-meets-the-green-hornet-2014/batman-‘66-meets-the-green-hornet-1) is a link to DC’s very own website with info on this crossover. You will note that the cover image features both the DC Comics logo AND the Dynamite logo. I will also direct you to the description information on the page, specifically the part that reads “Co-published with Dynamite Entertainment “."
Arrowverse,ff4nvnu,t1_ff4mz61,1579568175.0,"u/EmeraldJonah is correct. Green Hornet is currently licensed by Dynamite Entertainment. As for the film, it was released by Columbia Pictures. If it were a DC Comics release, it would have been released by Warner Bros. as Warner owns DC Comics. As for the crossover comics, those were a joint publication between DC and Dynamite, which is not uncommon in the comic book industry. Aside from those books, the only other connection between the Green Hornet and DC was a crossover between the Batman and Green Hornet TV series, which was possible as both aired on ABC at the time.

In short, Green Hornet is not, nor has he ever been, a DC Comics character and/or property."

Greenlantern,feyq53w,t3_epeafg,1579449165.0,I think his story arc throughout Johns’ run on the comic shows how much love he gets. Guy was mostly treated as a joke in the early days but the last several years have shown Guy go through some real character growth. He’s a much more interesting character now.
