Come on guys, we've seen the me too movement and all the sexual assault prevelations that have happened in the past 10ish years. Jenna WITHOUT A DOUBT used the most ""rapey"" rhetoric i have heard in awhile. The amount of gaslighting that took place in this stream was appaling. This woman may not be a bad person at all, I have no idea, I have no fucking idea who she is. But the idea that she wasn't out of line with her rhetoric and didn't use extremely aggressive wording and logic is fucking BACKWARDS AS HELL. 

She moved goal posts (an argumentative fallacy, ~~google it~~ defined below) when they began talking about the situation, detailing her own past and trying to make the argument about that instead of what happened. She THEN went on to discuss how he was ""in her bed"" and hes ""not a little bitch"" (ad hominem, another argumentative fallacy, ~~look it up~~ also defined below). Holy hell who watches this woman? You could literally write a novel on how backwards her logic is from start to finish, maliciously using every rhetorical trick in the book to try and convince others of her own fucked up point of view. The only reason anyone took any of her disgusting rhetoric seriously was becasuse she was a woman. Objectively, this shit wouldn't fly anywhere and we all know it. Gross. 

I can't believe her genuinely and obviously wrong behavior was such a back and fourth argument on stream, solely because of her status, sex, and use of the english language.

edit: spelling

Edit2: some people are triggered at me saying look it up I guess that’s offensive. Some coming at me for not defining it and some for using “buzzwords”. This was literally a DEBATE they were having. They were making ARGUMENTS. Using argumentative jargon has never been more appropriate and its actually more fucked up when you call phrases like these buzzwords because it contributes to a more regressive conversatiuon with more grey areas. It boils down the conversation to that of two middle schoolers or some shit where ""like"" is every other word. The lack of wording in an argument is limiting af and its why nobody sees anyone elses point of view anymore. Nobody wants structure when they argue anymore because then there is a clear winner and loser. One person is wrong and one person is right and there are clear rules that can be broken. but if you just use regressive bs and talk like an idiot well you might not win the argument but guess what? you probably wont lose either because nobody knows up from down and left from right. This is literally how a movement like Goop, Gwenyth Paltrows Psuedo science bullshit where she tells people ""walking barefoot will cure depression"" is started. You dumb the conversation down a bit, make everything the same color and Voila! nobody can tell the difference anymore. Suddenly anything no matter how ridiculous is fair game. In the current political climate this happens literally all the time with your friends, family, and co workers. 

 Let me define these words and phrases that I apparently just learned this morning 

**Moving goalposts:** a slightly informal phrase that describes when you change the goal of an argument mid way through the debate. She did this when destiny asked her to discuss the situation and she made it about her past (and the destiny came off like a dick saying “that’s great” about Jennas past sexual assault when he was trying to get the point of his argument). Kinda fucked up..

**Ad hominem:** when you attack the name not the argument. when she said he is “not a little bitch” she’s making the argument about personality types and how people feel rather than the argument points itself. She did this often. She says ""Do you want me to bring him in here?"" about the male in question as if she was going to like put him on the spot cuz hes ""not a little bitch"" and she also said ""Destiny youre just a little bitch"" etc. 

none of this was mentioned on stream or in the thread so I thought to bring them up because there is literally nothing more appropriate. people never get anywhere in arguments because they don’t actually critically and concretely categorize people’s rhetoric into specific terms and phrases which is legit how you make sense of bullshit like this. Without actual jargon you just go in circles which is why ""debates"" on twitch in general are such jokes. But yeah, I must be so addicted to the ""buzzwords"" cuz thats all they are to some apparently."

In anything you do, the **journey** is what gives you the qualities that you take away and apply to other things. If I did painting, I would try super hard to make a beautiful picture. If i learned another language, I would try super hard to have complex conversations like I would in english. 

The point is that we need to be more positive about how we spend our time. I'm trying to say that like anything else its ""fun"" to try to be good and imrpove. Yeah I probably will take up those things in my life, but I dont really understand the point youre trying to make here."

OverwatchUniversity,fdyxao9,t1_fdynx7n,1578784503.0,"For me, being good in video games makes me believe I can do other things in my life. When I problem solve in a game, cirtically think, coordinate and keep a streaight mental, at the end of the day those skills are priceless and transferrable to everything else in life. I like to take things from competitive video games like that, because then it doesn't feel like a void waste at all you know? When you improve at a skill, see real results, and very clearly see the steps you need to take towards the path to success, those qualities start to transcend that of just a video game and you start to do these things in your life. I've only been playing OW for six months and I solo qd to diamond by utilizing and executing these things I was talking about. I spent **a lot** of time playing the game to solo q to diamond. Like 200 hours porbably. I dont look at it as a waste at all. I wanted something completely out of the blue (to be ""good"" at OW) and took the steps neccesary to improve.  Holy shit is that validating when you problem solve and it actually works. Problem solving. This is the esence of existence for a programmer like me and when you keep practicing it over and over again you start to belive in your ability to do it in everything. Video games really hammered that home for me, and now im super confident whenever I face an unknown problem in my life. Sounds dumb maybe but I really believe in this.
