I knew a group that rescued dogs and taught them how to be PTSD dogs- so for instance, a French bull dog who nudges his owner every time someone walks behind him so that he doesn’t freak out. A Chihuahua used to detect seizures.
I have a friend who has a pit bull as a service dog. I am looking into trainers for my girl to get her to be a proper service dog for me (help me through panic attacks, guide me to a wall, stand on my feet to force me to focus).

I don’t have her out now because she’s not a proper service dog. I would 100% call out another person for lying about something like that. It’s not right.

I don’t think she realizes, if you will, how thirsty she is sometimes. 
Maybe something to try?"
