Munich,ff79lxm,t1_ff75qay,1579643948.0,"I think when people learn another languages, they have to be open to understand another languages and different cultures, so they’re more open up, maybe?

I’m getting use to it day by day, really. I’m still talkative among my people but I’m now more quiet when I’m around my classmates. I feel like people at my office are kinda more open, maybe life experiences... but yeaa still not so easy I have to say.

Btw, when I was at some events from my faculty, people are totally different when they drink..they are surprisingly kinda friendly haha"

Btw, it might sound nerdy but I really like playing board games and whenever I have time, I like to invite people and play games together. Maybe we can do that too? Haha"
Munich,ff6a7p0,t3_er9vdh,1579622738.0,"Ok, I moved to live here last year as a language student, so most of my good friends here are not Münchner nor Germans.

I used to live and work very internationally before. I met lots of different people in a day and I like backpacking when I had offs... I never had a problem finding ‘friends’ or talking to random people before until I finished my language class and started with the uni.

What I observe so far is that... people here really treat their friends and others differently. If you don’t belong in their groups (yet), they kinda don’t want to have a conversation with you. Somehow I tried to start some convos or participating in what people are talking about...well, it’s still hard to blend in. Seriously, almost 4 months gone and only 30 people in the class, they still don’t know each other’s names.

In where I come from, people tend to be more friendly, very open for conversations from new friends and like to offer helps without having to ask for... and also at where I worked before, like said that the working environment is very international but it wasn’t like this here... that’s why I was disappointed quite a few times before, but now it’s getting better. I complain less and less.. haha

Sometimes I tell myself that.. people are different and maybe now I’m surrounded by 18-22 y.o. kids who just graduated from school and still a bit ‘closed’...maybe?

But ofc, there are some nice ones and they even told me themselves that it’s kinda hard to find such a friend here."
