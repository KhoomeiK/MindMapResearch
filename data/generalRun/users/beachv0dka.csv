If you’ll notice there are a few scars toward the top of the fingers... 
I got this tattoo placed here so it can cover one of the scars in specific - the one that almost hit a vein.
Now, instead of looking in the mirror & seeing the darkness that used to overcome me, I see the one thing that continues to bring me light every day.

thank you porter, for life."

dedicated a whole L trip to porter robinson & i don’t think we have ever cried harder watching that music video"
DPH,ffrcoqp,t1_ffrbssk,1580155330.0,"at least you got some good thing out of it though. 

& no i never plan on trying this, i just really like hearing drug experiences & the subreddit as a whole"
DPH,ffr9jha,t3_euqwta,1580153399.0,"the good thing about losing tolerance / no longer being in a withdrawal phase, is that it makes it harder to go back because you’re no longer accustomed to the withdrawal symptoms the day after.

i will use nicotine as an example as i was disgustingly addicted to it.. seriously it was just disgusting. 
it has currently been 3 weeks since i have stopped so technically it’s out of my system & there’s no more withdrawals. a few days ago, i got tipsy & my friend gave me a hit of their juul. i immediately just didn’t like it anymore since i got anxiety & my lungs were like what the fuck. when you first start smoking nicotine, although you get a rush, there’s nausea & anxiety. but once you gain that (very quickly growing) tolerance, you’re just chasing a high that doesn’t have the negative side effects - it specifically just feels like a “release”... i hope this makes sense. 
that is scientifically proven - the part where when you start there’s less enjoyable “highs” until you’re tolerance/addiction takes over.

i know nicotine isn’t related to dph, but the analogy does relate to it (& just about any drug) 

i hope you quit dph completely, sending strength your way xx"
DPH,ffr6fq9,t3_euo4hi,1580151470.0,"this is the first post i’ve seen where the dph trio actually sounds like a good fucking time.. LOL.

Or the time someone said they were driving with their friend on dph(don’t do that) & that apparently they were chasing penguins. 

glad to hear some experiences aren’t miserable (i don’t do / never tried dph)"
festivals,ffldje4,t1_ffkj0ew,1580038230.0,"i literally said that i was wrong, i was going off information i was told a few weeks ago lol."
festivals,ffk8g9d,t1_ffjx5y6,1580018673.0,"i kinda assumed that after having this convo but the one festival that i know has the reputation of saying “fuck the venue, let’s blow the money on artists” is moonrise LOL. Hijinx seems to be more successful in that sense for sure. Even though it was a small lineup & an inside venue, they killed it. I guess even though there’s a lot of people, it has the feel of a small festival. 

I apologize for assuming that it was small & giving false info haha! but hopefully y’all consider checking it out since it’s not an overrated / extremely mainstream festie"
