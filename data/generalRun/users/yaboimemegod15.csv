depression,femamae,t1_fem9p2h,1579246155.0,"I'm not really that type I dont think. I can accept it but I'm not happy with it, if that makes sense. I try to embrace it but it doesnt help me unfortunately. Unless I'm doing something wrong which is def a possibility"

luciomains,fdva3ze,t3_emu3jq,1578745220.0,"I recommend having the jump on L2, boop on L1, and crossfade on X. I think this is the best setup but you can keep your current one if you want. The only tip I have is to practice wallriding in custom games, practice makes perfect :)"

OWConsole,fckgm8a,t1_fck4z6r,1577724882.0,Medals dont but stats dont tell the whole story. You're not gonna rank up by caring about stats
OWConsole,fcijfuw,t3_eh6l9u,1577663564.0,Stats dont rlly mean much tbh
Overwatch,fcij7sh,t1_fce7bva,1577663450.0,Never said that ppl always hit shots. Its easy to hit at least 80% of shots as ana. Her shots have a huge hitbox on teammates so it's not hard. Other heroes dont have that huge hitbox on their bullets. Cover is obviously ideal but you cant always move to cover. You clearly either dont play ana at all or are low ranked.
Overwatch,fce4i62,t1_fccuk49,1577616867.0,"If you play ana you shouldn't have difficulty healing anyone besides maybe tracer. If you're at low health you dont always have time to get to cover, so you have to move in a way that makes it hard for the enemy to hit you"
