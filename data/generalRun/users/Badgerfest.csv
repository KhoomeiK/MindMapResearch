For exercise walking is a good start, just extend the distance a bit each time.  If you can walk 3 miles comfortably then try a walk-jog-run session.  Walk for 2 minutes, not for 1 minute, run for 1 minute.  Extend the running and jogging intervals until you can comfortably cover 3 miles.  From there you can increase distances or intensity and will feel  ore comfortable joining group runs or even a running club.  An activity tracker and heart rate monitor will give you an accurate calorie consumption - this can be linked to your food diary app.

As well as aerobic  exercise you should do some conditioning to build muscle mass and improve control and flexibility. If you can't afford a gym membership see if you can afford a session with a personal trainer - they can teach you some simple exercises to condition your body and show you how to increase intensity as your fitness improves.  If you don't want to spend money on equipment then there are loads of body weight exercises you can do.  I would recommend a set of press up bars though to reduce pressure on your wrists.

Finally if you're embarking on a proper fitness program then don't forget rest days to let your body recover."
