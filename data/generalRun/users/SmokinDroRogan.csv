To play devil's advocate, however: some of these countries are hundreds and hundreds of years behind the rest. The people are indoctrinated with a way of life and religion. They become what they're born into. USA is a melting pot of cultures. We do not have a single, predominant culture like other countries. When you're born with one culture, you're inclined to accept it and become it. Thank fuck for the internet because it's awakening people in these archaic cultures/countries and allowing them to evolve. The ideals of the West aren't for everyone, so I'm not advocating for ethnocentrism, but some of the ideals of these countries are objectively repressive and detrimental to life."

Panicking makes you way more likely to accidentally inhale liquids when trying to force it down, and make other awful choices. Just breathe through your nose, realize you can do that so you'll be okay, try taking a sip of a literal drop or two of water, visualize it going down. When all else fails, I do my best to induce vomiting and force it out. I know that's not the best idea, but as a former bulimic, I've got pretty good control over it.

My sister has been in the hospital for 6 weeks with extensive brain damage and feeding tubes, so I can empathize with what you had to see and endure.
