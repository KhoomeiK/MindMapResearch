What you're saying is true, and the Foxconn thing had to do a lot with how much they paid the families of the suicide victims (way more than other factories). People don't know that Foxconn is pretty much the best of those places to work in. People don't go to Foxconn as a last resort, they want to go there, spend 2 years working and come out with enough money to do other things. That's the Chinese mentality.
