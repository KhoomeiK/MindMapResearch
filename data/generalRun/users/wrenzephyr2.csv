This would help break up the material so it’s a little more eye catching, and also in your set you could slowly untie the lace for an added tease."

corgi,ff5o1dl,t3_erspy9,1579602609.0,"One thought that worries me is I’m scared she won’t like me. I know it’s part of my social anxiety, but I still get this nagging concern that she won’t like me or being around me. Plus I’m very affectionate and cuddly and I don’t want to stress her out.

I’ve dreamt of getting a corgi since my childhood doggo passed away, but I’ve always waited because I wanted to be sure and stable enough to give them a great life. I work freelance, so I’m always home, I’m very mellow, my roommates of 5 years joke they can count the times I’ve gotten angry on one hand...  

I’ve already gotten to visit her once, and I almost cried holding her because I was so quick to love her (I’m tearing up now thinking of it). I’d love for us to be best friends and partners and I want to do whatever I can to give her a long, healthy, happy life. So, I guess this was just sort of a ‘letting it out into the universe’ to help ease my mind. Any tips you can give would also be appreciated, and I promise to take plenty of pictures of my little Puca Mochaccino once I bring her home.

Thank you!"

But I’m sorry, it’s not a slur. It’s certainly something used by jerks and bullies to put you down, but it’s not the Rubenesque n-word."
