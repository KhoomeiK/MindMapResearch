IsItBullshit,ffb1gr0,t3_eslelr,1579749427.0,"I tried out Swagbucks, would not recommend. I didn’t qualify for a lot of the bigger value surveys and in order to make an significant amount of money, you would need to be on the website almost 24/7. Overall, I would say it isn’t worth it."
cats,ff88k9r,t3_es4qjf,1579669133.0,"I adopted my cat at 6 months old, too! (She is now almost 2!) Be prepared for her playfulness!"

cats,ff396x3,t3_era09b,1579536646.0,I love the jacket! Where did you get it?
cats,ff38tgw,t3_ere8ga,1579536404.0,That is horrible. I am so sorry that happened to your family. I can’t only imagine the loss you and your wife must be feeling. Sending love your way!
relationship_advice,ff24aaw,t3_er7657,1579493408.0,"It is usually better for both parties to not remain friends once a relationship has ended, especially if there are no children involved. (I know she mentioned she has a 3-year-old, but he is not the product of your relationship with her.) I would recommend being honest with her and letting her know that you don’t think you can be her friends after the kind of relationship you two had."
relationship_advice,ff22ki2,t3_er7g3p,1579492080.0,"Unfortunately, it is quite possible that he is cheating, or at least thinking about, cheating.

However, your relationship will not last if there is no trust. If you are still suspicious of him after any cheating accusations have cleared, you will never be happy with him.

Seriously consider if you want to save the relationship, and if you do, consider couples counseling."
relationship_advice,ff1zvzy,t1_ff1vdwe,1579490101.0,"Because breaking up with someone isn’t always as easy as it sounds. I know how she is feeling, I’m in that boat right now. But I read that if you don’t want to be in a relationship anymore, you should NOT try and get your partner to break up with you by acting differently. So, since it seems this girl had lost interest in you, and you’re still together, you should break it off. In the grand scheme of things, 7 months isn’t too long anyway. You’ll be better off for it!"
relationship_advice,ff1zcny,t3_er646i,1579489712.0,This is normal! As long as you don’t get upset or start resenting her not spending all her time with you - which it seems like you are not doing any of those - it is not toxic! :)
relationship_advice,ff1yagx,t3_er6kye,1579488962.0,"I’m in this situation right now. I’m 22, and I’ve fallen out of love with my partner that I’ve been with since high school and no longer want to be with him. I’ve known this for months and have been riding it out for several months now until he was in a better mental state.

Since you are younger than me, my advice would be to respectively tell her that you don’t feel the same way about her anymore and that she deserves to be with someone who loves her as much as she loves them. Then, don’t talk to her on any medium for a long time."
aww,ff1v9tp,t3_er28zp,1579486957.0,That dog is adorable!!
IsItBullshit,fewjz9c,t1_fewjedg,1579412242.0,"It makes sense that different people burn different amounts of calories. It is all dependent on the individual’s fitness level and current metabolism. However, the slowing of your metabolism sometimes brought on by weight loss can be altered if you engage in strength training in addition to aerobic exercise. If you have more muscle tissue or more active muscle tissue, your body will need to provide more energy to it and keep your metabolism closer to the starting level.

Losing weight at a slower rate (i.e. 1-2 pounds per week max) can also help with minimizing metabolism changes."
IsItBullshit,fewi64y,t1_fewacke,1579411018.0,How does the endocrine system work then in relation to weight loss? I’d like to know more about how it doesn’t boil down to “calories in vs. calories out.”
relationship_advice,felt7mt,t3_epu5mi,1579230339.0,"This is definitely not okay. Despite what he says, all his actions convey that he does not care about you. You need to tell him that he can’t invite you over to visit just to ignore you. I think it might be best to break up with him unless something changes with his behavior."
cats,felo5cl,t3_epog3s,1579226849.0,What a beautiful cat you have there! :)
