dogswitheyebrows,ff61la0,t3_erebg3,1579616803.0,My pup does this all the time and it always makes me smile.
wholesomememes,ff61cjv,t3_errvsf,1579616620.0,I'm the same. I am not attracted to hard bodies or small frames. Pudge is perfect.
AmItheAsshole,ff61058,t3_erskit,1579616357.0,NTA. Seems pretty obvious that you can do what you want on your own property. They're being ridiculous to expect you to conform to their wishes.

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,ff5zfut,t3_ermp27,1579615117.0,"Nope. You handled it fine. He got exactly what he asked for, you tried to get specific and he didnt want to. His problem for sure."
TalesFromYourServer,ff5z74u,t1_ff5l3la,1579614919.0,"This. Parents dont always consider this and it's very frustrating for busy restaurants in the middle of a rush. 

At a fast food place I worked at, unsupervised kids would try to go behind the counter to explore. NO. We all wear specific shoes for a reason at work, and your dear angel wants to throw things in the fryer, not ok."
TalesFromYourServer,ff5yvna,t1_ff5jj4y,1579614662.0,Same. If they had excellent manners I'd even offer a free treat!
TalesFromYourServer,ff5yjtc,t3_erqzdl,1579614390.0,"I agree SO MUCH with this. I dont care that it's your little bundle of joy. Your child constantly interrupting the order to tell me ""I WANT CHICKEN NUGGETS"" isnt cute. 

Your child screaming about ice cream isnt getting it any faster than the children quietly waiting.

Your child being hungry is not an excuse for them to be a public nuisance, and when they interrupt people trying to do their jobs, it isnt cute."
AskReddit,ff5y537,t3_ero8mj,1579614045.0,She'd be horrified but intrigued at the same time. I was very sheltered back then.
JUSTNOMIL,ff3t3xy,t3_er7wmp,1579548271.0,"I just recently made a post elsewhere that can relate to this. You cant force anyone to love anyone else, including family, and especially if that relative is toxic.

One commenter said I can never truly love anyone if that's how I feel. Another called me a narcissist.  About 100 other commentors agreed with me.

I watched my dad try to please his mother for years and years, and she just would tell him what an awful son he was, and saw the pain in his face and heard it in his voice. She of course hated my mom for taking him away. Did not care when she passed. My other Grandma, my most beloved and wonderful older female relative, will forever have my deepest love and admiration, even after Alzheimers has robbed her of herself."

JusticeServed,ff3ntdf,t3_er7e96,1579545026.0,"Omg. I love this judge so much just from this one video. There's too many vindictive, spiteful parents in this world who dont even care the affect their actions have on their children."
