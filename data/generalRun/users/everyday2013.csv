dogs,fehgm5c,t3_ep5jpm,1579116123.0,"A few years ago, my old cat ""P"" was deteriorating and he was put to sleep a day too late -- he was in pain and I regret not having it done sooner.  A couple years later, his sister ""O"" was deteriorating and she was put to sleep possibly a week too soon, but I have no regrets there.  I would have liked extra time with her, and she would have had some good moments, but I didn't want her to suffer and it was obvious that she would pass soon but not in an easy way.  Hope this helps you decide."
