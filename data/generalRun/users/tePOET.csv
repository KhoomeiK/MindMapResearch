worldnews,ffz46qj,t3_ew0lgh,1580363388.0,Uh... didn't read article but pretty sure they made one yesterday. At least broke it down and started developing vaccine. Which happened... yesterday. OMFG AntiVaxxers are shitting themselves.
depression,ffz413n,t3_ew0lhe,1580363236.0,"Life is a journey, not a destination. If you're thinking to live towards a happy ending you're kidding yourself. And I'm not talking down to you at all.

YouShouldKnow,ffz3lgv,t1_ffz273y,1580362828.0,Are halogen monsters a type of curtain? I have not heard of the term. I know what blackout curtains are. But I just put posterboard on my windows. Take them off if I want the light. And vice versa.

unpopularopinion,ffytqws,t1_ffysxki,1580354918.0,You missed my point. It's not their problem. It's being dickish towards the people who buy the product. *That* is the problem.
YouShouldKnow,ffytksn,t1_ffysyg2,1580354797.0,I'm not sure. Might be CFL? I don't know what that means. But they are a spiral shaped bulb. Almost looks like an ice cream swirl. And they give off a harsh whitish light. Supposed to last a long time for a lot less energy cost. I have them in my kitchen... but I mostly use a lamp there as well. But one of those bulbs lasted 5 years. Only put the lamp there 2 years ago. But the light from them is awful. I mean it's bright and such... but a cold brightness if you get what I mean.
YouShouldKnow,ffysehu,t1_ffys4fw,1580353975.0,I agree. But not everybody can paint the walls and such. The lighting suggestion is something anyone can do. And to add further... fuck those spiral energy bulbs. That is depression in a tube lol.
unpopularopinion,ffyrzqn,t1_ffyqzis,1580353693.0,Oh hey... just thinking in an abstract manner... what if you buy a certain brand of cereal. And that's 12 ozs in the box. You just buy it because you like it. You keep buying it but don't realize the company took the 12 ozs down to 10. Same sized box. Same price. You buy it out of habit. Don't realize the difference. That is the problem. And what companies do.

If I made a post about a subject I was passionate about, and truly believed in, and someone just says fuck you you're wrong, without IMO having researched enough to understand why I said what I said, I consider that to be a reasonable reply. Some people are deadset on how they feel no matter the facts. So YMMV but that's not always invalid."
