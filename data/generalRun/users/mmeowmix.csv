Not sure if a barber will do this sort of thing, probably better luck with a hairdresser. Not the cheapest salon, either, if you can afford it. Good luck!"

greenday,fdovmvd,t1_fdohbuf,1578613904.0,"""Salad days"" is a Shakespearean idiomatic expression meaning a youthful time, accompanied by the inexperience, enthusiasm, idealism, innocence, or indiscretion that one associates with a young person. A more modern use, especially in the United States, refers to a heyday, a period when somebody was at the peak of their abilities—not necessarily in that person's youth. The quote ""salad days"" is from the Shakespearean play Antony and Cleopatra and is spoken in Act 1, Scene 5, by Cleopatra.
