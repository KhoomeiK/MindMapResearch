AdviceAnimals,ffacd67,t1_ffa5ane,1579732211.0,Actually I totally agree with you on that.  I just think so called Christians do a great job of besmirching everything Jesus stood for thus alienating even more people than if they had followed his teachings and life a little more accurately.
AdviceAnimals,ff9v9i9,t3_esbl5t,1579722238.0,I don’t blame you.  Most Christians don’t actually act anything like a real Christian.
explainlikeimfive,ff6xsaq,t1_ff64443,1579637083.0,But wouldn’t it just be advantageous for the body to have evolved to be performing at that maximum on the regular.  Then you’d have a new and even better adrenaline maximum thus ensuring that you are and always will be the apex being.  Your explanation makes sense based on the idea that humans are at a fixed point of evolution that is as good as it can ever get.  If we were to assume that humans are still evolving to be ever better then your explanation is only partially correct as we should be ever better and maintaining this higher level of performance because it ensures better survival.

AdviceAnimals,fdy3iv4,t1_fdxljv3,1578775687.0,"Yeah I thought about that actually but left it as effect.  Honestly, it could be interchangeable so I should have put “effect/affect”."
AdviceAnimals,fdvs41b,t3_en3eg3,1578750929.0,In general it’s a good idea to take a step back and really think about the long term consequences of your actions.  Who will it effect?  How will it make them feel?  Really play out that timeline where you decide to do this.

news,fc6q28k,t1_fc6naxn,1577486608.0,"Oh I’m not a big fan of college in general anymore, regardless if it’s community or big university.  The whole education industry has just gotten a bit out of hand and the thought process around higher education is ridiculous nowadays.  At one time going to college made sense but I believe that at some point people should come to the realization that a college education is really not as amazing as the education industrial complex has made it seem to be.  Go through high school, be studious, work hard, but don’t feel like the only way your going to be successful is by going 100k or more into debt for a piece of paper.  And absolutely don’t believe that that will guarantee you any kind of happiness."
