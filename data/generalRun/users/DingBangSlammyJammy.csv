Sometimes if I'm too lazy to line up a clean rendezvous for an orbit rescue I'll just get close enough to gain control of the vessel and have the Kerbal jump! Use RCS to slow your descent back to Kerbin then pop your parachute!

buildapc,ff7ew57,t3_ertrte,1579647952.0,"Which direction should I go for a CPU? I want to upgrade my gaming PC. Current rig is an overclocked i5 4670k and a 660TI but I'm buying a 2070 or 2080 soon.

The 9600k seems cheap and I could probably give it a hefty over-clock. Or I could go 9700k but it appears i7 no longer has hyperthreading? I don't think I want to go as far as a 9900k. Is Ryzen good enough that I should consider it?

I want to play and stream Kerbal Space Program 2 at max when it's out in the future as well as catch up on current gen games."

I'm using panther engines on my SSTO to get off the ground before I use a couple swivels to finish the ascent into space.

Is there better engines than Panther for take off? Also, instead of swivels should I tech to the vector or aerospike? Or should I go all the way to RAPIER?

I'm designing this SSTO to go into Kerbin orbit to clean up space junk and tow it back down.

Silly question: If my SSTO has two stages; one for runway liftoff and second for rockets to push me into space, is it still an SSTO?"

Me being a little kid said ""But I want the bigger one!"" so the game operator told my parents if they buy another round he'll give me the bigger one so they did. Then he pulls out another tiny stuffed red dog and hands it to me.

My parents protested ""Hey you said you'd give him the bigger one!"" The game operator holds them both up to compare and one was barely the next size up. ""See, it's bigger!""

Guitar,fc0qnvr,t3_efintl,1577297307.0,"I own a 2015 double cut. It is definitely a quirky guitar and you have to be OK with that!

The neck wide and it's noticeable. Widest neck on an electric I've ever played in my life. 

I was going to change the tuners but it's my only guitar like that. As a novelty, the G Force tuners are pretty cool. I think Gibson went wrong by going all the way and putting them on every model. If they only did 1 model with the tuners then I don't think they would have got as much hate. Regardless, they tuners feel gritty when tuning manually so I only do it automatically. It's easy to bend out of tune sometimes. I've had that issue with all Gibsons though.

There's a recall on the nut so you can get a replacement one of those. 

I also replaced the pickups with some Fralins.

Over-all, I love my 2015 and it plays AMAZING after a setup. The only thing that can be an actual deal breaker is the neck width if you're not comfortable with that. Everything else is OK or can be addressed.
