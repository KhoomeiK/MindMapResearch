religion,fefpr0o,t3_eomhvw,1579061751.0,"conceptually, these are abhramic relegions. practically, it's general tendency to see muslims as more rigid towards their relegion and hence more extreme, so others want to keep a distance. In my personal opinion, it's good to keep distance from people who are incapable of questiining their beliefs but people tend to generalize this wrongly to all muslims."

depression,fbxu1vc,t3_eez1m0,1577200508.0,"I faced this situation few years ago and decided to cut off all the dick heads from my life, it was hard to live alone at first but i managed. found 2,3 trustworthy friends later in life, never been more satisfied with my friends circle. I don't mean that i cut myself off from social life, just started thinking critically about who i consider friend and found that no one was really a friend at that time. Now that i have 2,3 good friends, i realize that it was not my fault earlier, those people were not capable of making deep friendships. i feel it's practically not possible for people like me, who look for deep connection in any of our relationship, to find more than 3-4 friends and 3-4 is being optimistic. Having one friend is more than most people have. 
TLDR: Most people are dickheads incapable of making deep connections and have a lot of friends, it's lucky to find even one good friend."
