I had trouble forming thoughts and I felt like I could barely work up the energy to move myself - and that was at 160 lbs. I can’t imagine how bad it would be at an even higher weight. I finally broke down and went on insulin once it got bad enough (we’re talking almost hospitalized, intervention levels of bad) and it was like waking up for the first time in months. Once my blood was stable, I was able to tackle the lifestyle changes, lose 40 lbs, and get off insulin and meds. 

I always wonder how many people find weight loss to be this impossible task because they’re marinading all their systems in sugar and feeling the physical and cognitive effects of that."
fatlogic,ff57lay,t1_ff3zpnu,1579582562.0,"I maintain on 2100 at 5’2, but I run 5-6 days a week (min 50 mins) along with strength and crosstraining. And I still have to be careful because calories can add up pretty quickly after a hard workout. The odd day where I’m stuck at my desk and don’t work out drops me down to 1600."
fatlogic,feoxias,t1_feowo61,1579307530.0,"I get tickets to a dinner theatre buffet every year, and I always plan if for the evening after one of my longest training runs. There’s nothing quite like knocking out 32km in the morning, getting cleaned up, and splurging on a buffet and drinks while watching a show."

explainlikeimfive,fdmb5cx,t1_fdlugjc,1578544441.0,"It’s interesting to see how it varies. I’ve tracked my food and activity closely for years, enough to have some pretty accurate numbers to go off of. As a short lady, I get about 500 calories per hour with steady running. A half marathon won’t cover the burger and fries I want to eat after. A full marathon gets me up to my husband’s maintenance calories (about 3600 for the day). Not that I don’t eat the burger after a race."
fatlogic,fcvgq5x,t1_fcv2lcd,1578001739.0,"That was really illustrated to me when I went through a rough patch and gained 20 lbs. I kept running and following the same training plans, but my half marathon time went from just over two hours to 2:15 and slower. The effort felt the same, but at a much slower pace (and it was worse at longer distances. My heaviest marathon was a full hour slower than my PB and felt awful). After a couple years of hanging out there, I dropped the weight and got back to sub-2:00 half. I love running at any weight, and I still pushed hard when I was heavier, but it’s much more rewarding at a healthy weight."
CalgaryFlames,fcjfuec,t3_ehhiu1,1577686056.0,"This was the first game I’ve been to in a couple years, and it was a frustrating one to watch. Nothing seemed to connect, and the whole team just looked off. But - I got to give a standing ovation to Kipper, which meant a lot since I was way too poor to ever see a game in person during his prime playing days."
Calgary,f9v5tj9,t3_e72sya,1575663647.0,"Gorgeous! I walked through Devonian Gardens yesterday for the first time in years, and I was telling a co-worker after that I loved the glass art."
