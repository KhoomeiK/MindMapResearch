MapPorn,ffi2rio,t1_ffhwv2i,1579963388.0,"Yes of course but our monoculture forests aren't that great. Neatly ordered trees of a specific species that are allowed to grow for a bit then a vast section is just cut down leaving a barren field that then get's replanted with the same type of tree.

Forestry is certainly important but I wish we had a few more areas that were left alone and allowed to become wild with a diverse set of trees, particularly in the south."
