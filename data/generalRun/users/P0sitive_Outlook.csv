One thing you can do, if you have the money and space, is to certainly buy the Commader precons and Challenger Decks and play them right out of the box, and also consider mixing all the cards up so you can have a go at building your own decks.

Sealed Cube is what i'd suggest. It's what my playgroup does when there're only four of us and we want to play a Round Robin (each of us plays a round against each other player, for a total of three rounds). We'll do this by either taking six fifteen-card packs each, or randomly distributing six lots of Rares, eighteen (6x3) lots of Uncommons and sixty (6x10) Commons for each player. We'll each have six packs or six packs' worth of cards. Then we'll each build a deck using those 90 (or 84) cards - usually the best 23 cards with an addition of seventeen Lands (or a ratio of 24:16 if the deck's cards tend to be of a lower converted mana cost).

TLDR: check out Sealed. Then make a Sealed Cube."

Then a slightly *larger* bullock approached, barged the other one out of the way, and gave me this long look down his nose. :D I reached out and he backed away, so i treated him like i treat horses which i want to stroke - i ignored him entirely and kept looking at the other bullocks around him. Then he sniffed my hand and i was like ""Do it or don't"" and stroked his face.

Kinda tense. With horses, i'm always worried they'll push me. I once got pushed over by a horse and stepped into stinging nettles while wearing shorts. With the bullock, i was more confident because it was a large wooden gate and not a thin metal or low wooden fence. Would recommend.

I think the world's becoming more and more understanding of the complex needs of people and pets with psychological, neurological and physical differences, and more invested in these people's/pets' achievements despite their difficulties."

He was alone for like two months when we decided he needed a buddy, so we got him a fish-friend. I can't remember what we named the second fish, but after a few weeks they grew to be the same size and colour and we could no longer tell them apart. So we re-named the second fish David.

David and David. The goldfish."

That's what i see a few thousand of each day at work, and there's basically nowhere for it to go but landfill and incineration. Nylon sacks are great because they last for a very long time, but your *Bag for Life* will be useless once one of the straps weakens. And in the trash it'll go.

My cousin works in construction and he showed me this traffic cone base he'd destroyed with a digger. The base was largely black but it contained tiny nylon threads, plastic beads and all these weird pieces which were shiny like foil. Composite plastic is the only viable end-of-life for most recyclable plastic. The great thing is that in a lot of developing countries they're using this plastic aggregate to insulate houses. Beats the hell out of burning it, right?"

It became so difficult challenging him on what he said that we just all went to FNM and let the more regular players talk him out of his bad habits. He *still* argued.

Just... find out what he wants out of the game, and play to that for a bit. That's all i can suggest in the long-run."
