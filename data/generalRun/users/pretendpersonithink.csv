Woke up with pain in my shoulder a few days ago but went to the gym anyway, thinking it would ease off and I'd slept on it funny, not thinking that doing OHP was probably not wise. Several days later and it's still sore. No more lifting for me until it feels better which sucks."

The puppies (assuming you are picking up an 8 week old) won't have had much socialisation, but I would ask what the seller has done in regard to socialisation. A reputable breeder will care about the pups as more than just a money making scheme."
AskUK,fe3rcvi,t3_enol3t,1578852083.0,"I'd really recommend brushing up on study skills, and most importantly, learning how to study at university. The Palgrave books are quite helpful and you may be able to find them at your local library or on Amazon. Having that down will save you some unnecessary headaches come essay/ assignment time. That helped me so much for my undergrad. 

Language learning would also be a good idea, especially if you are doing a degree in international relations, maybe choose a language that will assist you with that? 

There are courses available online (for free) on the likes of futurelearn, openlearn, coursera etc) and you don't need to just look at courses that are related to the one that you will be doing but get a broad understanding of other subjects may help you with the degree and also get study practice. 

Volunteering, as others have said, also looks good and should feel good for you too. Even if it isn't related to your degree there will be transferable skills. 

Also, think about what you want to achieve. Write down a list, and think about why you want to do it. You will find something there. Choose one (or two depending on what it is) and set a plan for how to move towards that goal between now and October."

I tried this last night but I cut up an old pair of tights (pantyhose, whatever you call them where you live) and stuffed it. One of them was with stuffing and a squeaker from old toys, the other had a mix of plastic that was to be put in the bin (for the sound) and the old toys fabric. Stuffed that into the tights, and then knotted, then wrapped the tights back over the toy and repeated until there was no tights left.

He loved it. He still got through it a bit but it takes a lot longer and he was actually stopping himself from completely destroying it when he almost got through one layer he would turn it over and try again.

One of those things was ignoring people because he LOVES attention and thinks that everyone is there to give him attention (which people do because he is adorable). The amount of people trying to pet him despite me obviously training him was ridiculous. Only one person asked that entire day and I thanked him for asking. One woman didn't listen to me, pet him anyway then he starting jumping up at her and said that she doesn't mind. It was honestly like people had never seen a dog before."

As he has gotten older I have started leaving him in the room while I do other things. Started small like filling up the water bowl and then moved up. He is more content with staying in the room by himself and will go ahead and play with his toys. Sometimes he tries to follow but more and more he is just staying where he is and continues playing.

Plates everywhere, just thrown around the floor and left them there when they left the gym, lifting belts on the floor in the walkways, put the bars at the highest point of the rack which I can't reach and I had to get someone to help me get them down, one rack had two barbells though only used one, guy actually working out was doing barbell rows while standing on a bench for no reason that I could see...
