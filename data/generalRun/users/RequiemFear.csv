That makes him qualified enough, to me. Facebook (the company and the platform) is aids, but that doesn't mean employees of Facebook should be blacklisted. If the argument is that he's getting the visiting scholarship while maintaining his role at Facebook, then maybe you have an argument.

AskReddit,ffsytiy,t1_ffsobfs,1580198263.0,"That one is far more up for debate than the others. It's undeniable that ~4m Ukrainians died as a result of the famine of 1933-34. But genocide relies entirely on intent, and the intent of the Soviet government, especially Stalin, during that crisis is debated by historians to this day.

As a more meta point, this topic really raises the question of whether genocide is a useful, or even applicable, term. Is there something intrinsically worse about millions dying due to malice, rather than incompetence? At what point does mass murder become genocide? Can genocide be applied when the intent is never enunciated?"

First off, Buchanan isn't a historian, he's a politician and media personality that likes to think of himself as an intellectual, but isn't.  Frankly speaking, if he isn't including new primary documents or novel interpretations on already assessed primary documents, there's no historiographical value in his work. Second, Germany was always going to attempt an eastward expansion under Hitler, the foundations for this were made clear in Mein Kampf. Third, ignoring the racial ideology of the Nazis is the only way you can come to the conclusion that Hitler wouldn't have done what he did in regards to racial extermination. Fourth, not guaranteeing Poland's security wouldn't have prevented the war, only delaying it. If that guarantee did not happen, the Molotov-Ribentrop Pact likely wouldn't have happened, which in turn would likely mean war between Germany and the USSR. Regardless of how that would have turned out, it would inevitably bring the French and the British in; if Germany steamrolled into the USSR, they would be in possession of key strategic and industrial locations that would be too much for the British, at least; If the Soviets steamrolled into Germany, it wouldn't take long for the Western democracies to get involved, because commies n sheit. If it became a slogfest with neither scoring major victories, the destabilising effect it would have would eventually draw the West in.

It's a pure fantasy of Buchanan's that WWII could have been avoided in some way. Also, his interpretation of the Holocaust is very much on the Functionalist side, which isn't based on much evidence. No serious historian would come to the conclusions that Buchanan has."
