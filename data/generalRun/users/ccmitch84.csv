AskReddit,fggeik1,t3_ey1dmx,1580760194.0,"A friend of mine I had met through work (who later left for a different job but kept in touch) seemingly fell off the planet. She had been having trouble with some people harassing her after getting a hold of her phone number in the past. She had changed numbers once already for that reason, had lost my number & gotten in touch on facebook. The second time she disappeared I figured the same had happened & tried to get in touch with her on facebook only to find someone had hacked it & she was no longer using her account. Some time later, I start trying to scour the internet trying to see if I can find a phone number, since I could only remember the area she lived in & not the exact house (although just showing up at her house would have felt weird, anyway). That's when I find the news story about someone coming into her house and slashing her throat. Her boyfriend didn't know my number, so he never reached out to let me know. According to the story, she had had a party at her house, and someone claimed they had been raped. I don't know if they had reported it or gotten checked out or anything, as the news story didn't give any such details. The story only said they had held her accountable for their rape since they were at HER house when it happened, so they showed up one day with a couple friends to stab her to death."

Anyway, we go to play bingo a lot, and a couple of times she has invited another friend of hers, which I was cool with. This time, I invited the only other person who I'm very good friends with & it brought that green eyed monster out. She invited as many people as she could, to fill up our table to push my other friend out of the group. I thought it would be rude to bail on the one other person I'd invited just because she had tried to leave them out, so this time around I ended up sitting at the table with my other friend while she sat at the table with all the people she invited.
