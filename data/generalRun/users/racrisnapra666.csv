I love being alone. I love doing things alone. I know for a fact that doing things alone makes me better. But I kinda worry that this will somehow lead me towards a life of loneliness. 

And one day, I'll be there, in some dimly lit hospital, dying with no one there around me. At least no one that I know as my own."

KeanuBeingAwesome,ff5jnxn,t1_ff5j9fm,1579596034.0,"No, but you misinterpreted what I said. 

Ratings make a movie good or bad. Genre is the style of movie. 

Keanu makes different types of movies. John Wick movies are called action genre of movies. But he also makes movies like Always Be My Maybe which are from the Romantic-Comedy genre (and which I hate down from my guts). 

So, when I said ""genre"", I meant the style of the movie. Not if the movie was ""good"" or ""bad"". 

Now, do you get what I wanted to say?"

In essence, he would be proud to see the all the pain and suffering that he went through (and will go through) will turn out to be the catalysts in helping him lead a better life."
