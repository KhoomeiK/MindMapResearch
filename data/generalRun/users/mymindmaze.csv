It talks about how religions work, how you can train yourself to be the best version of yourself, how small things you do in the present can influence the future. I am re-reading it now."
selfimprovement,fdgco5c,t1_fdedtbk,1578390338.0,Have you been doing this for a long time? How do you keep yourself motivated to track so many things? I usually do it in the first week and then just get sick of it and drop it.
selfimprovement,fddrpnx,t3_ekiluo,1578322236.0," May I suggest that you are trying to make friends with the wrong people? Growing up, the truth is that there will be less and less people you will REALLY like and you need to intentionally seek them out. What I mean is that people who randomly appear in your life just because they study at the same university or they have the same job at you might be way less interesting to you then people who do things that you like to do. So think about your passions: do you like going to concerts? Do you like animals? Do you like drawing? Do you like going to the gym? Do you like hiking? Computer games? Just think about what activities make you happy and then find specific groups for that. [M](https://meetup.com/)eetup can be a great resource, depending on the country you are in. There are also Facebook groups, other different forums and groups, both online and offline. It might just be about finding your crowd.  
A final piece of advice, think about whom you admire and why. Do you know about someone that is proactive? Kind? Helping others? Having big goals and hustling to get there? Make friends with them and get them to help you do the same. Change your mindset from trying to find the bad things in people to finding what's to admire about them. Good luck, it WILL get better in time!"

How often do you weight yourself? how precisely do you monitor activity levels and what do you use for that?"
AskEurope,fddh6si,t3_ekox8o,1578312111.0,Romania doesn't have one. Belgium has a quite limited one in which just certain bottles get you money back and there are few collection points for it.
aspergers,fddgfoc,t3_ekn1bn,1578311169.0,"I am neurotypical and this question really got me thinking, so I practised it with my boyfriend to see how I do it. The answer is I just look at the face in general, not one eye specifically or one facial feature. If my eyes were a camera lens, it means that it would be quite zoomed out rather than zoomed in on a specific point in the face. The center of the area I am looking at is the bridge of the nose. It's kind of like a comparison with a painting. If I were looking at a painting the size of an A4 piece of paper, it's small enough that I can take it all in from a regular conversational distance. I can look at specific aspects of that painting, but I don't HAVE to. That's how I see people's faces too. I think that any part from the top half of the face, middle axis works (be it forhead, space between eyes, nose). I would find it strange if someone obviously switched between eyes while talking to me."

Accutane,fb40upl,t1_fascrol,1576498697.0,"I am not sure how to answer that. I started off the same as now: I weight about 57 kg and take one 10mg pill per day. The doctor said that she tries the lowest dosage that works. After one month, she upped it to a 20mg pill per day, kept me there for 6 months (I think) then for the last month I was taking only a 20mg pill every 2nd day. So in total 8 months of treatment, out of which 2 (beginning and end) at 10mg a day, and 6 months at 20mg a day. I have no idea how to calculate cumulative dose. Also, isn't the dr going to get annoyed at me for suggesting him not to give me minimum dosage?"
