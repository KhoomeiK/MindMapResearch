PublicFreakout,ffp2vdk,t1_ffon7u6,1580085124.0,"> Nitpicking about terms when that is not really key to what happened here is just trying to muddy the waters. 

The term is precisely what's at stake here, language is important.  When somebody commits actual racism, I want to use that word, and we all hear and understand the signal with no noise for the heinous behavior it is.  When you dilute it, you add noise and lose signal.  Then at some point, you are racist for not holding the door open long enough for somebody 20 paces behind you, because they are 1/16 Cherokee and other such nonsense woke regressive cultural values that we've reached. 

> ""Racism"" is a variable term because ""race"" is as well.

I think we'll fundamentally disagree on this because I hold the definition that we've used since the word started seeing use - treating somebody in a different way (typically one with negative externalities), based on their race.  What about ""race"" is variable?  I also think we're due for a new word that best describes this sort of behavior... bigoted is probably the most fitting though.  So is she racist?  Maybe, but it's not inherently racist to say ""Could you speak English while you're here!""  Ignorant, bigoted, chauvinistic, all fitting words.

> Do you honestly think this would have happened if the people were Swedes speaking Swedish?

Honestly, it's entirely possible with this woman, she doesn't seem with it.  But as with xenophobia or ignorance, if she had a better awareness of Swedish culture, or could even recognize it as Swedish language (as opposed to Sami or Norwegian?), then you can't really compare that to somebody speaking Mandarin or Cantonese.  A better A-B test would be two tall white guys speaking some nordic language, they get off, and a brown skinned woman wearing a Hijab starts speaking the same langauge, and she waits to tell this woman off, that's pretty damning indication of racism, perhaps even sexism, as a primary motivator."

beer,ffp0zaf,t1_ffjypqk,1580084102.0,"Yes and no.  The ""preservative"" aspect merely the prevention of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) spoilage, i.e. souring spontaneously.  This happens because of the alpha acid isomerization, which directly contribute to the higher IBUs, and bacteria don't do well in this environment.  

However, hop cones are the flower of the female bine.  You like fragrant, juicy IPAs... the bouquet of flavors and aromas from these delicate cone-flowers added late in the brewing/fermenting process, the same as your godmother Ethyl likes fresh cut flowers in her foyer.  You can think about those flavors and aromas withering and fading just as the cut flowers - they are volatile, and beer is a living (usually) agricultural product that continues its chemistry long after brewing, fermenting and packaging.  Hops are some of the first characteristics to fade, even though the LAB-preventing qualities stay.
