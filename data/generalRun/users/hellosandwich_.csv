Thank you for saying this ðŸ˜”"
college,feg2p9n,t1_feefcsk,1579074307.0,"Thank you for replying. I was quite hesitant to post this because I thought I was overreacting and blowing things out of proportion.. The certificate is basically a paper that lists the specific date from when you started and ended your internship as well as it lists all of the tasks and projects you've completed. 

My school doesn't have a ombudsperson, so unfortunately everything's 1:1. 

I thought about talking about this with another professor, however I'm not sure who is her friend and who isn't. For example the other day, I greeted a professor I had in the first semester (he is a french prof) and we had a light convo which included him mentioning how many good things he's heard about me from my prof. I haven't seen him in *years*. And there were other instances where I saw how big her network of friends is. 

However, it's really nice that you mention it, as a professor, because I did think about doing this, despite my previous point. After all, and I may be wrong but even if a prof is friends with her, that doesn't erase the fact that they can give me a solid advice. I just need to be careful with who I choose. 

Yes, I did ask her to write it. Her immediate reaction was ""why do you need it? are you going somewhere?"" and when I said that I don't have anything particular in mind right now so she just acted like it never happened. I'm also kind of... scared to mention a deadline simply because she gets moody very often and this may sound off to her? For instance, I remember her brushing off some major mistake interns had done but then on another instance she almost flipped a table when one of them didn't edit the report the way she wanted him to. 

I will make sure to sent her an additional email after I speak to her in person, however, she straight up ignores my emails, even the ones that described as 'urgent' (I have to go to her office and ask her in person ""hey was the X thing I sent the way you wanted? and then she'll open the email in front me"") .

Honestly? I'm scared to do the step number four because (even though you are right and this should the answer), in a way it states that ""hey choose the people you give the task to, more appropriately"" because honestly I don't even think we have a team for that in uni? We do have a technical support, but they don't photoshop other people's photos... Also I think I made things more difficult because I did edit some photos for hers already ,how's she gonna take the rejection now..? 

Chair department... Again, the are colleagues and thus I'm afraid she doesnâ€™t have time to micromanage PIs and my request seems kind of silly I guess. In this situation, I feel like even if I get the recommendation letter with her help, my prof is going to do way more damage anyway. 

I didn't know I could still put this in my experience section on resume since I don't have a RL. Honestly speaking I'm slowly coming into terms with the fact that I'll have to either be the slave for her till i graduate (another year) or I'll just straight up leave cause I'm too fed up with her. Of course, I'll follow all your steps, but there's little hope left.

Thank you for your advice."

The most annoying thing is when I have to do the stuff the other interns had to take care of. I rarely see them because we are in different groups but if you, as a professors know (she has complained many times about their incompetence) how bad they are at they job, just.. hire new interns? fire them? i don't know, just do something"

I didn't have a specific internship program in mind then (neither do now) so that's why she just forgot about it within two seconds. 

Also, now that I remember, I asked about RL a week before was the end of my internship about it (she even started typing on her computer!) but the next time I went to her office there was no mention about any finished certificates or RLs. 

Thank you for your tips, I will def talk about this more with the post-docs."

I never fully realized this, but you are so right. I learned everything I could there. It just.. stings because I spent a year doing work there for nothing. I'm in my senior year so it's gonna look quite worrisome that I ""did nothing"" during my last three semesters.."
college,fef603i,t1_fedyo8k,1579048997.0,"> however, you participated in the internship so that you can have a letter of recommendation for opportunities elsewhere 

the thing is. I've mentioned this once to her, just like you said. The first thing she asked was: ""WHERE?"" (where was I going to do my internship after her). To be honest, I didn't have a specific place in my mind back then (and neither do now) so I guess that's not a valid argument for her? Also, as I writing this reply to you I realized that not only does she want to know everything but that she also makes the decisions for me: ""so you don't have anything important right now, therefore you don't need it""."
college,fef5nam,t1_fecjhwa,1579048754.0,"Lucky you!

I don't know if there are 'official' policies regarding  student-professor interactions, but her I think she found a loophole nonetheless. She always asks more for a favour rather than an actual request. A big reason why I made this post was because I was afraid I was overreacting.

college,fef1gak,t1_fec56p2,1579045936.0,">Her plea even sounded somewhat insincere

This is definitely the case. It became a habit of hers to end her task emails with a non-existent deadline. For instance, we had a conference and I was in change of catering (...). I was assigned to prepare the papers, mainly financial management, ""two days before catering company's deadline"". It sounds easy but I had to do with lots of emails regarding the coordination either the company itself or the logistics team. Anyways, I finish everything, send her the papers via email because her signature is needed, in order for me to get the confirmation from the logistic department and wrap up the whole thing. I wait 1,2.. 4 days. Then I go to her office during office hours. I ask her if she saw the ""very urgent thing"" she wanted me to do. She didn't reply. She just *smiled* at me.

>Maybe she is a lady who has no intention of being malevolent but needs to better separate her personal outside needs from her professional relationships

This is her as well. I learned from the other two assistants (one phd, one master's student  who quite literally do everything themselves) that she just sticks her nose everywhere. For instance, he had to postpone a trip with his fiance because the prof decided that he ""didn't have to do anything serious that weekend"" and decided to assign to him prof-reading a 300 page book. So, having things like this in perspective makes me feel 'lucky'

>if the dean is needed then at that point you might have to accept that you will not get a recommendation letter

definitely thought about this, especially since, like another redditor said, it's like reporting a local cop to local police. In theory the dean should be objective but in reality, they are still colleagues.. Hope she understand tho and I won't have to go this far. Thank you for your advice."
college,feey63r,t1_fedwyca,1579043792.0,"> This just sounds manipulative 

You are right. I understand that I am being manipulated, however I don't know how to escape this situation.  

About her visiting my classes, I just find it plain... rude? Weird? Especially, since it doesn't end there. 

There were a few times where I tried to tell her in person that the X thing (which wasn't in my range of responsibilities) would be difficult for me complete. She immediately asked me why and I said that I want to study on that day. She asks me which subject I want to study... I tell her.... She asks me which prof teaches it. Like ??? I really have a feeling that she just wants to know and control everything that just plain isn't her business, however she herself fails to control and manage the things she is responsible for (e.g. deadlines, documents) which later creates even more pressure for us (assistant profs, me) in order to make up for her mistake."
college,fec4ics,t1_febwr37,1578966532.0,">  She's holding your certificate over your heard to get what she wants. 

I'll try one more time to talk with her and this time I'll be more stern. I doubt the dean will do anything tho, I mean the internal conflict would be unavoidable and I doubt the dean would like to mess up her relationship with another fellow prof..."
college,fec42di,t1_febtikj,1578966349.0,"I'll try to find some of the students who were in her lab and ask them but so far, I know that she's isn't planning on giving to the current interns the certificates /R.L cause they suck at doing their job (at least that's what she and her assistant prof told me..). And I know this is not my cause cause there were never any complains about my work so I guess she is okay with it. 

I haven't thought of asking other interns about this tho, thank you"
college,fec2h47,t1_febxgxk,1578965698.0,"> DOCUMENT all the nonessential things that she is having you waste your time on in case you need to go higher up. 

I have everything in my email however there are few things here that worry me:

1. her emails most times sound more like a plea? for instance, ""dear \_\_\_, please if you can, do the \[thing that I shouldn't be doing\] because of the \[bunch of nonsense reasons\]. It is very important xoxo"". *Technically*, she isn't make me do it. She's just *asking*. But at the same time I cannot say no because this stuff is so URGENT and """"""""only *I* can save the world"""""". 
2. I doubt that the fact that she's wasting my time is a strong reasoning for dean. I mean her (the dean's) explanation can be that not everyone can be satisfied with their internship and that sometimes we all, one way or another, waste our time. 
3. I know she isn't in favour of the prof, however considering that my professor was the one who established the lab from scratch and that she's very protective of it, I doubt that the dean is going to stick his nose in there. I also don't know if deans can interfere with such matters in the first place. Usually, every profs who have their own lab/project are only economically supervised. 

I really like your tho wording, I will try to state my words like this, thank you. I also think that sending it via email is going to be more sufficient, cause at this point I am not sure what I was more: my recommendation letter or her just to stop bombarding me with useless tasks"
college,febt3b6,t1_febqut9,1578962363.0,"Isn't a report a bit too much? 

She's also the type of ""jealous"" professors, so I can't even imagine how she's going to react if the head of the department approaches her about me.
