He's one of the early dominoes in making sure that the knowledge made it to the west but it wasn't his goal. His goal was to preserve it and use it for his people. It then made it's way west to Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire and then at the fall of Constantinople moved west, when the Empire fully collapsed was when the bulk was gained.

Texas doesn't matter to Democrats and California doesn't matter to Republicans. Which causes them to stratify even more.

A straight vote gets people caring about everyone rather then Florida and Ohio.

Clinton was a Republican boogey-woman. Everyone who could vote against her, did. She still got the popular vote by 3 million.

Trump is going to lose votes, people detest him, moderate voters never liked him and those moderates that voted against Clinton will vote against him now or not show.

Since Bill Clinton it's always been Democrats who decide who is president by either voting or not voting. Republicans (for the most part) all vote, every time.

So the Republican playbook will be to drive voting down, make it harder, make it more confusing. If 1 out of 100 vote the wrong way, statistically Republicans lose fewer votes then Democrats. If they disenroll 5% of voters Democrats lose more votes then Republicans, if the polls are hard to get to Urban voters that rely on transit won't vote, all rural voters have cars.

Democrats need a good turn out, everyone who can vote should and they should verify every few weeks that they aren't disenrolled. They'll try in blue states as well to make it look like it's close and less of a blow out. Everyone should vote even if you know it's a deep blue county in a deep blue state.

comicbooks,ff9g7m3,t1_ff91y9n,1579712340.0,"'Mystery Box' is an interesting way to construct a story. Build up the mystery and mystique of the story before knowing the pay-off.

Old mystery writers did it the opposite way. This is the murderer, now let's work backwards to conceal him leaving enough clues that the reader will believe the detective followed the path to him. So they'd know the beginning and the end of the story, the murder and the murderer but the path too was constructed last. It leaves satisfying conclusions that are logically tied together.

I used to like JJ. Abbrams, I thought his story telling had style but he always had build without finish and the finish is what makes a piece of work, a masterpiece. I thought he'd evolve but he hasn't. he builds his murder, he runs his detective through the maze and then he decides who the murderer is when he hits his page count. 

It's arbitrary and unsatisfying despite all the great build up, it undermines everything if you can't stick the ending. 

I wish they could have gotten a Nolan-esque director for 'Dark' or a great horror director. I'm actually disappointed at this announcement despite loving JLA: Dark."

1. The Smithsonian Institute Global Volcanism Program has verified that Volcanic activity over the last 2 centuries has not gone up. Has probably been fairly consistent for the last several thousand years.

2. Volcano eruptions tend to cause cooling. Ash gets into the atmosphere and reflects sun light back into space.

3. Also the earth's core is as cold as it's ever been and has been cooling since the planet stopped accruing substantial mass. For it to heat up we'd have to get more mass and space dust isn't enough to offset the loss of hydrogen and helium to space at about 90 tonnes per year.

4. Think about sun light, we're warmer in the day time significantly and warmer in summer significantly. Sunlight has more to do with heat then anything else. The core is hot but it's not hot enough to stop us losing all our heat on the surface to space if the sun wasn't there to constantly replenish us.

It's a different message when you have a white english/scot bourgeoisie rich boy from a titled family licensed by the brit government to go kill people for it that tend to be from other places or created by other white male brits in the government and he doesn't have too much of a problem with it. 

I think Bond needs to stay white and British to maintain that commentary. Idris would kill it as Bond though, it just changes the tone.

I do think Idris being 006 introduced in a Bond movie and being a commentary on racism, imperialism and hegemony in the modern era would be a better spin and then winging him off into another series of movies that you could continually cast black men in as it goes on. Idris Elba has that same gravitas that he could define a role and it would live on past him.

Get 3 or 4 movies in and then start a 00 something else with the first female agent licensed to kill and have it be a commentary on how she's expected and refuses to do things that the men aren't expected to do, misogyny and sexism that has filtered down from the beginning. Have her start in one place with the expectation that she will be a new kind of Double 0 and then after a movie or two have the system grind her down into just being as cold as her male counterparts because the system doesn't care and the inhumanity of being a killer is always dehumanizing, there is no better way. All ways lead to being a sociopath for a government.

I think making Bond colored or female also loses the commentary that could be had with new agents due to the history new Bond actors are being bogged down with. Bond has to be a certain way or it's not Bond, at which point you can't bring Idris Elba or Emilia Clarke into the role and have them truly define it. Everyone who has played Bond has tried to define it slightly but kept it in the shadow of Sean Connery's performance.

I'm sure I would love Elba in a Bond movie, I've liked him in everything else. I just think it's an opportunity to do something spectacular and expand the Bond Universe."

comicbooks,ff9g7m3,t1_ff91y9n,1579712340.0,"'Mystery Box' is an interesting way to construct a story. Build up the mystery and mystique of the story before knowing the pay-off.

Old mystery writers did it the opposite way. This is the murderer, now let's work backwards to conceal him leaving enough clues that the reader will believe the detective followed the path to him. So they'd know the beginning and the end of the story, the murder and the murderer but the path too was constructed last. It leaves satisfying conclusions that are logically tied together.

I used to like JJ. Abbrams, I thought his story telling had style but he always had build without finish and the finish is what makes a piece of work, a masterpiece. I thought he'd evolve but he hasn't. he builds his murder, he runs his detective through the maze and then he decides who the murderer is when he hits his page count. 

It's arbitrary and unsatisfying despite all the great build up, it undermines everything if you can't stick the ending.

1. The Smithsonian Institute Global Volcanism Program has verified that Volcanic activity over the last 2 centuries has not gone up. Has probably been fairly consistent for the last several thousand years.

2. Volcano eruptions tend to cause cooling. Ash gets into the atmosphere and reflects sun light back into space.

3. Also the earth's core is as cold as it's ever been and has been cooling since the planet stopped accruing substantial mass. For it to heat up we'd have to get more mass and space dust isn't enough to offset the loss of hydrogen and helium to space at about 90 tonnes per year.

4. Think about sun light, we're warmer in the day time significantly and warmer in summer significantly. Sunlight has more to do with heat then anything else. The core is hot but it's not hot enough to stop us losing all our heat on the surface to space if the sun wasn't there to constantly replenish us.

I think Bond needs to stay white and British to maintain that commentary. Idris would kill it as Bond though, it just changes the tone.

I do think Idris being 006 introduced in a Bond movie and being a commentary on racism, imperialism and hegemony in the modern era would be a better spin and then winging him off into another series of movies that you could continually cast black men in as it goes on. Idris Elba has that same gravitas that he could define a role and it would live on past him.

Get 3 or 4 movies in and then start a 00 something else with the first female agent licensed to kill and have it be a commentary on how she's expected and refuses to do things that the men aren't expected to do, misogyny and sexism that has filtered down from the beginning. Have her start in one place with the expectation that she will be a new kind of Double 0 and then after a movie or two have the system grind her down into just being as cold as her male counterparts because the system doesn't care and the inhumanity of being a killer is always dehumanizing, there is no better way. All ways lead to being a sociopath for a government.

I think making Bond colored or female also loses the commentary that could be had with new agents due to the history new Bond actors are being bogged down with. Bond has to be a certain way or it's not Bond, at which point you can't bring Idris Elba or Emilia Clarke into the role and have them truly define it. Everyone who has played Bond has tried to define it slightly but kept it in the shadow of Sean Connery's performance.

I'm sure I would love Elba in a Bond movie, I've liked him in everything else. I just think it's an opportunity to do something spectacular and expand the Bond Universe."

Thatâ€™s obviously insane and unrealistic but itâ€™s not like working on the engine where too many people will cause more problems then having to few. So certain aspects are scalable up and others obviously arenâ€™t.

They could even crowd source Pokemon creation and have 10s of thousands of them made and only to be hampered by the ability to quality control and balance them.  Which much if QA can be crowd sourced also."

movies,fdpid33,t1_fdpdz9x,1578629428.0,"Pull the band-aid off quick and do all 4 main Lanterns, Jordan, Gardner, Stewart and Raynor.

Have them standing over 3 dead lanterns and the first word of the movie is ""Sinestro?"" from Raynor. Second sentence from Stewart is, ""How'd he take three?""

Then make it a movie where their hunting down clues and leads, tracking down Sinestro. Trying to get him. Third act of the movie drops them into Qward surrounded by 5600 Sinestro Corps members and the resolution is them barely getting away. The last word is Jordan screaming through his ring to all the Corps ""Sinestro has an army.""

2nd movie opens up with a D-Day scene as 6 human Lanterns, add Jessica and Simon, try to fight their way into a city being systematically destroyed by Yellow Lanterns. Have the death count be huge and mention the population of the planet is above 99% deceased. Have the planet be Ryut. Half way through the movie turn it into a horror movie as Atrocitus rises and calls the rage of 2800 Red Lanterns to his home world chosen from those who lost the most in the Yellow/Green War. Have the Yellow and Green team up to try and escape and call a detente.

Third movie starts with Atrocitus having most of his Corp destroyed from the Green and the Yellow. Trying to bring back his people he creates the black ring and summons Necron and the Black Lanterns start raising the dead.

So when this is proposed and cost is brought up, cut everything and replace the bad guys with clouds or beams of light shooting into the sky that knocking out the one villain will solve the problem."

GameFreak have lined themselves up to have  a Season Pass for Summer and Fall this year 2020 Season, which sets them up for another Season Pass for 2021 Winter and Spring or early Spring and early Summer and then lead into the next game in November.

This gives them the ability to have us pay another $30 for 200 more Pokemon that are already pre-made, add a handful more of Galar Legendaries, add another Sword of Justice or two and they get a full games worth of money out of 4 small DLCs and get it upfront."

PoGo mon aren't built in the data to the same level as mainline Mon so there may be a wall for PoGo Mon. I could be wrong and they could translate them, randomly or based on percentages or some such but that's 'go getting' and GameFreak aren't known for that."
pokemon,fdnvmz8,t1_fdntwyh,1578593762.0,"No, not free, I expected it to be part of the game last November part of the retail price. 

They shaved off Pokemon that should have and in the past would have been part of the base game to up the content in this expansion. The new legendaries, bulbasaur and squirtle, the 200 other Pokemon. They should have been in the base game. The only thing that should be introduced monster wise in the expansions are a bunch of new Gigantamax and maybe a mythical or two.

I definitely didn't want a third game. I like the DLC idea but it has to feel like a full game that is being added on to. BoTW felt like a full game so the expansion was extra icing on top."
pokemon,fdnu5wi,t1_fdnkp4u,1578592897.0,"We always got a legendary group in the first game. That they kept it behind a $40 pay wall with other new Pokemon is kind of crappy. Also the reason they held back Bulbasaur and Squirtle. 2 of the 3 most popular starters.

I'm not a fan of this splitting the Pokemon up so you can sell them at different times in the same gen.

I am glad to see 200 more Pokemon coming into the game that can just be transferred. I like the art and everything I've seen. I just wish it didn't feel like it should have been in the base game."

Problem is if it was on the 3DS, it would be two $40 games also. That's what Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon basically were but you started with a new save.

I'm going to get the pass because it does look decent but I'm definitely not blown away.

I think this is a sign the most we can expect is a port of Diamond and Pearl though. I don't think we're getting remakes. I think we'll get 2 season passes out of Galar and then move onto a new region."

Epstein was a power broker, he connected with thousands of people at all kinds of levels and to all kinds of degrees.

We can't make an assumption about individuals without evidence, no matter how close the relationship is. There are always close friends and family that are completely flummoxed and taken aback by the crimes of someone they thought they knew and hung around regularly.

Epstein used his island to abuse girls and show his friends a good time with them. There are some reports he also used it for business and with individuals where nothing happened.

There needs to be an investigation and evidence needs to be collected and acted on. If Trump or Clinton knew anything and it can be proven they should be punished, if they participated they should die in jail."

'6 Underground' was just popcorn fluff. A bad movie is memorable, as is a good movie. Harmless, okay movies will be forgotten and 6 Underground is the definition of 'okay'.

It's the equivalent of those forgettable 90s action movies with Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Van Damme and Seagal without the 90s kitsch and nostalgia to hold it up, pretending to be Fast and Furious without the character comfort to hold it together. A bare minimum plot to get us between some interesting set pieces. For instance the chase at the beginning and the fight on the boat were enjoyable set pieces that will be forgotten due to the mediocrity surrounding them.
