todayilearned,fdxhp9o,t1_fdx8u7c,1578768801.0,"No that's not the point at all though, the dude just wanted an answer on why teflon and scotchgard are bad and got a non answer telling him to look up a bunch of other things with a single line at the end of the reply saying that dupont has been poisoning us for years. How could one not deride that? All abilities to just look up scotchgard and teflon aside, failing to answer a question then ending with something that at surface level sounds bizarre or fringe does not lend credibility."

todayilearned,fd6nus7,t1_fd5xv17,1578193583.0,That gives me an odd mental image of a young couple who are frequent ikea customers because they upon assembling furniture have voracious sex on it and break it same day.

todayilearned,fcpmeqf,t1_fcplr37,1577867466.0,"Hmm, well I suppose you could rig a flamethrower up so that it lights when you shoot a wick with an incendiary round rube goldberg style, but for lighting asses on fire I'd suggest a typical cattle brand or hairspray and a lighter."

aviation,fck2luf,t1_fcjma8d,1577714707.0,Ah my bad I thought you were referring to the 737s which don't make 15+ hour flights. You may want to look at the Boom XB1 although I'm skeptical as to whether it'll leave the design phase.
aviation,fcjd33c,t1_fcjaq0k,1577683488.0,Because if they made them faster then they'd have to worry about supersonic designs and the transsonic range of speed exponentially increasing development cost to only have them go the same speeds they are now on continental flights because sonic booms over land = bad.
flying,fcg9mz8,t1_fcanbc6,1577637857.0,Well obviously if you've had bang for breakfast and lunch you'll have a felony for dinner.
