>Production of Wiss razors ended in the latter part of 1923. Wiss razors  with tangs made by Wade Butcher and other European (e.g. German)  manufacturers appear on eBay. Apparently after production stopped they  continued to fill orders for razors with tangs made by others. Razors no  longer appeared on the 1924 price list. The 1925 catalog lists razors  on the cover, but they are not shown within. The market for straight  razors collapsed after WWI.

I also read through your Antarctica post  - you wrote that you actually were able to spend nights inside significantly more than you had estimated. Did you manage to contribute to the small villages or tiny huts you were graciously allowed to stay in? Or is it a one-way thing, where you simply accepted their hospitality in the middle of the antarctic."

tinnitus,ffv5n07,t3_evarva,1580256247.0,"I believe my tinnitus, which I've had as long as I can remember, is due to pressure changes in airplanes (especially landings). I had a runny nose constantly as a kid and I think the pressure and the mucus resulted in a lot of ear infections. I remember lying in bed and hearing the thump thump thump of my heartbeat in my infected ears. I don't hear my heartbeat any more but tinnitus is an ongoing problem. I also believe I have some hyperacusis, and I startle very easily from loud noises - I often note I am the only person nearby who's like WTF WAS THAT.

CPTSD,ffur7la,t3_ev81rd,1580247793.0,"Pete Walker says that emotional abandonment  can be worse than physical abuse:

>The fact that verbal and emotional abuse can be traumatic is lost on many childhood trauma victims, though it is rarely lost on recovering victims of cult brainwashing who are prone to developing Cptsd.  
>  
>Many survivors of verbal and emotional abuse never learn to validate its soul-damaging effects. They never accurately assign current time suffering to it. Attempts to acknowledged it are typically blindsided with thoughts that it was nothing compared to kids who were repeatedly beaten - who 'had it so much worse.'  As a child, I minimized my father's frequent face-slapping by comparing it to my friend's father who used to punch him.  
>  
>Much later, however, I finally realized that for me, and for many of my clients, verbal and emotional abuse damaged us much more than our physical abuse.  
>  
>Ongoing assault with critical words systematically destroys our self-esteem and replaces it with a toxic inner critic that incessantly judges us as defective. Even worse, words that are emotionally poisoned with contempt infuse the child with fear and toxic shame. Fear and shame condition him to refrain from asking for attention, from expressing himself in ways that draw attention Before long , he learns to refrain from seeking any kind of help or connection at all."
