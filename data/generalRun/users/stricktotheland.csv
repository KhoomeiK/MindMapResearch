Congrats. Ive been on for 7 so since 2012.

Did you not use r/all? Im being serious, you could have 3 seperate posts on the front page of r/all for large portions of the day, and it was almost guaranteed a post at all time of day. You'd either have to block it out or not use r/all to be hidden from it, at least until the reddit admins changed the algorithm.

And unless your subscribed to a sub the content will not go on  your front page. Stuff from funny never gets to my front page, that doesnt make it not one of the largest subs on reddit."
CanadaPolitics,fedi79x,t1_fedg96n,1579012169.0,"I was talking more as a platform for the campaign. TD was at the top of r/all multiple times a day, and even had multiple posts on the front page of r/all (edited because people cant read in context). The reddit admins had to change the way r/all worked because they (TD) would sticky posts that they wanted to get to r/all, to have multiple posts on r/all. They had train posts making it to r/all in the order they were supposed to go (like 3/4 posts, all one letter, for example MAGA, each letter being a seperste post). They had a large presence on reddit last time, they will have a large presence again.

Edit: I also wouldnt say it was a flash in the pan, it lasted well into his presidency, and has only been off of r/all because the sub got quarantined."
todayilearned,fedhnyb,t1_fecsnw3,1579011774.0,"Sorry, I took your words to mean more than you did. And I agree, the earth has been ever changing. Dinosaurs once ruled the earth, and they all died with a meteor, almost instantly. Even after the meteor, life survived and grew into what it is today, and many specied came and went in the mean time. Whales for example, started out on land and evolved into the creatures they are today. But, yes, we do not need to hasten our own demise. 

If we die out, while our plastic legacy will remain for a long time after we are gone, does it matter? We have computers and space ships, and no other species that came before us, and perhaps none that come after, will ever achieve that. The dinosaurs in their millions of years never evolved into anything with any technological advancement. Wouldnt it be such a big waste to just die out?  I know the planet will still be here for a few billion more years, before getting swallowed by the sun, but if all that comes from the human race is a legacy of plastic it just seems like a large waste of potential."

todayilearned,fecpbwf,t1_feckrty,1578979849.0,"Yes I know trees dont last forever. Some types of trees need forest fires to germinate. There are almost no American Chestnut trees anymore because of a fungus. But when trees die, others often grow in their place.

To act as though man has a small impact on the world because it changes by itself is ignorant. We massacred the bison, and are the cause of many animals extinction either directly, or indirectly through introduction of non-native species. Look at Lake Chad and the Aral Sea, shrinking because of the re-routing of rivers for irrigation purposes.

Now we cant say for sure that the Aral Sea would not have dried up in 10000 years, but we can say it would not have dried up as fast as it did, if not for human intervention. Without humans the Aral would still be there."

For the people who do not want to do any cutting, whom he addressed, it would make much more sense to just not do any cutting, at all, and allow the forests to grow naturally. Not grow and cut them down later, nor selective cut and then cut them down later. Just let them grow."

The only good thing right now is that TD had been quarantined, so they cant directly spew their hatred onto r/all.

todayilearned,fecc6wn,t1_feca7r1,1578970541.0,"Thats interesting. I was always under the impression that old growth was more diverse. I suppose its with my familiarity with thr irish stika forests, although I imagine that is more the difference between farms are replants.

That said, my point still stands. Old growth forests are important, and for people who dont want to cut down the trees in the first place, it would be better to leave them be. They do absorb more carbon than younger forests, and are more suitable for some species of animals that require certain conditions to thrive that new growth cannot provide.

I just saw your edit, can you expand a bit? Are you saying that the old growth prevents sunlight, or the new growth does?"
todayilearned,fec8gma,t1_fec7blc,1578968479.0,"Doesn't this mindset only work if you are going to cut down the trees for timber? So if you are of the mindset of ""dont cut the trees down at all"" its all bullshit bause you dont want to cut the trees down in the first place?

Like I understand for lumber its good but dont we need some old growth forests, with all the diversity they provide, rather than just lumber forests?"

Ruffalo is mid forties (52 now) but his character didnt start with him, it started with Edward Norton. At the time of Hulk (2008) Ed was 39 years old, which does put him in the age range that you listed. However, at the beginning of the movie he had been hiding out in Brazil for five years, which puts him back to age 34. If we take Ruffalo's age in 2008, as he has been the sole actor since the Avengers movie, he would have been 41. Minus 5 years brings him to 36. 

Not a super big deal, 34/36 isnt much younger than 38 and he's a super genius in a comic book movie."
