PoliticalCompassMemes,ffmfgzm,t1_ffkms6l,1580053871.0,Thank you for helping I just didn’t know which quadrant my view would fit into
PoliticalCompassMemes,ffk5vbz,t1_ffk4e1k,1580016873.0,"Welp, I guess I’ve just hung around people that judge my views a lot, this place seems very chill and more makes fun and plays with other views and their own instead of insulting them (r/politics) honestly my views are weird. I want everyone to have rights and minor governmental control. I feel like people should generally help others and I guess that’s more of idealism than anything. I feel like most places the government can be corrupt and that when that happens it’s the people’s jobs to help. (Honestly did not think I’d be expressing some of my views today)"
PoliticalCompassMemes,ffk4n1k,t1_ffk4e1k,1580015713.0,"Never said I don’t like looking at things like that, but yeah you’re right kinda backwards isn’t it. Guess I don’t have many view than huh. Welp time to take 50 more tests, maybe it’s just describing certain view to people."
PoliticalCompassMemes,ffk1ilh,t1_ffk1854,1580012948.0,"Thanks, but I’ll have to refuse, I’m one of those people who don’t like to say most of my political views whether they’re radical or normal. I’m grateful for the offer though."

Gamingcirclejerk,ffb0bqr,t1_ffa0f1i,1579748657.0,"I’m honestly loving the game when it doesn’t explode at peak hours. A nice change of pace from Pokémon, it has charm and the devs are updating since they’re an indie studio releasing an early access game. I’m excited to where it goes"

unpopularopinion,ff83clf,t1_ff7dheh,1579664893.0,Yeah like I had a bad experience with a church once but I’m not going to go judge every Christian out there because some are legitimately nice people
unpopularopinion,ff836zt,t1_ff6w29i,1579664776.0,"Exactly, I’ve had a bad time with a church in the past but it’s not like I’m mad at Christians for that one experience"
unpopularopinion,ff82x1d,t1_ff6qm71,1579664571.0,"I mean it all depends right, my church said it was ok to be intolerant to others if god wills it, never taught sex Ed since it was “evil”, gay marriage not real, and a whole bunch of other stuff. My view of the faith has downgraded since I was there and that was what I grew up. All depends where you were taught and how"

destiny2,ff799vi,t3_erz762,1579643713.0,I’m just a little disappointed that bastion was announced in like a weak and people were expecting a secret like that of outbreak to the sheer scale of the COT
destiny2,ff3skmj,t1_ff3r3sg,1579547939.0,"I know and I have, it isn’t like I’ve stopped playing destiny completely just that it feels more of a chore now with all these FOMO things like the activities, I feel rushed with it all. Having said that I can still have fun with friends in it and I can totally see why people still play it, guess my taste has changed a little bit is all"
destiny2,ff3qqbb,t1_ff3hgfs,1579546809.0,"I took breaks, but I mean burnout as in I don’t have as much fun doing destiny things, I find it more as a chore so I’m taking a break right now and whenever something like a new cool exotic comes out I hop back on, but to see these underwhelming things it just cements my position on destiny right now"
destiny2,ff36i5d,t1_ff352qy,1579534851.0,But all that for a mediocre gun kinda makes the burnout even more unbearable

woof_irl,ff1stpk,t1_ff0i3cp,1579485399.0,Yeah I know but my dog always needs a leashes and I don’t have a fence so it’s be neat to see my dog run with me and fight dragons would be epic

unpopularopinion,feiwtrr,t3_ep9up9,1579149385.0,I’m mean at least it isn’t worse for you
Whatcouldgowrong,feiw62k,t1_fehhrax,1579148856.0,"Yeah dogs are usually chill if you know them, but if it’s a random dog please always ask the owner if they can or would bite and even the owner might not know or be dumb as a rock so just watch the body language and if you hear growling or see a snarl, back up. Really that simple and I don’t understand how people thinks it’s ok to get so close to a dog they don’t know"

nextfuckinglevel,fcwhj09,t1_fcw5sqc,1578025777.0,Ah yes because he totally didn’t do anything with his kids while doing this. He decided to abandon them until he finished his masterpiece of a play place only he could use. The children meant nothing to him anymore. He definitely didn’t do this for his children oh no.  He wanted to play inside his little fort the the children could not have.
