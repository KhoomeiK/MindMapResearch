EndlessFrontier,ff88pp4,t3_es25m7,1579669266.0,"No, the post was clear. The answer lies in the guide that was linked. Read through that and you won't have to ask some of the simple questions. It will also explain how to prioritize things so you don't waste your resources, like you kinda did by T3ing all of your units."
MagicArena,fejo58g,t1_fejb2e2,1579181353.0,Run away together instead of Opt. I call next shower.
MDT,fe8zhfz,t3_eo646l,1578932570.0,Do you have your rules set up correctly on your deployment share? You need to have domain joining disabled when performing captures (there may be some other settings too).

EndlessFrontier,fcvpaoa,t1_fcvmo5y,1578007043.0,"I meant specifically dungeon materials. I just got 8* t1, and am unable to Max level them because of dungeon materials. Maybe it's only a couple days worth, was more than 100 levels short."
MagicArena,fcv58xd,t3_ej26bs,1577994914.0,"I had enough gems when ELD was released as F2P, but spent them on some sealed instead. It doesn't hurt to wait a while to buy the pass, was not going to open packs until after I was done drafting anyways. I have close to 8k gems at this point, so I can get a good start on THB before draft opens :D"
EndlessFrontier,fcujfgy,t3_eiynmu,1577982371.0,Make sure you start saving up materials. It takes a lot to level them up to max.
facepalm,fckilgd,t1_fckd0g0,1577726132.0,Ha ha!
facepalm,fckihau,t1_fckbesl,1577726060.0,"Maybe, but they wouldn't be the ones calling 911."
facepalm,fc5vi0y,t1_fc5evzb,1577466788.0,Jokes are funny.
