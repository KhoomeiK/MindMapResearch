AskReddit,fed02j7,t1_fecb667,1578991949.0,"Actually, if you check the numbers for
median house price as multiple of median income.

2019:
315000/64000 = 4.9

1970:
24000/10000 = 2.4

Average mortgage rate is ~4% now compared to ~8% in 1970. For a 30 year mortgage, that's about 1.54x as much money for the same amount borrowed.

If we adjust 1970 for mortgage rates:
2.4 * 1.54  = 3.69

4.9/3.69 = 1.32

So when you adjust for everything, houses are about 30% more expensive now than they were in 1970. That *is* more, but what you will hear on Reddit makes it sound waaaaay worse than it is.

Edit: Same math at 1980 comes out to a house price of 7.1x median income, **worse** than today by a significant amount."

I'm a huge fan of statistics, but if our laws and rules were based fully on statistics, we could justify a lot of pretty heinous, racist, sexist things.

There is zero racial profiling going on here, so this entire paragraph is irrelevant. Product X is getting stolen more than product Y. Therefore product X is getting locked up while product Y isn't. The store is simply doing math. This isn't stopping black people at the door. Hell, the person making the decision probably doesn't even know what the products are, just a bunch of UPCs. You're the one profiling.

>Maybe someone with a darker complexion doesn't like to be reminded that they are statistically considered more likely to commit crimes when they are shopping.

Then convince people to stop stealing shit. I love how none of you place any blame on the actual thiefs here, just the store for not pretending It's not happening. It's not the store's job to ignore reality because you find it distasteful.

>As for your second point, you are making assumptions again. Corporations make these kinds of stumbles all of the time. It is impossible to foresee the consequences of every seemingly benign decision. However, once awareness is raised, they may have to reanalyze this one.

No, it's not. In fact it's not even a point we disagree on, and that is the reason I am ""stubbornly"" refusing to engage you on it. I'm not arguing what the medical facts are. I'm arguing that medical facts are fundamentally a useless criteria in this scenario.

The difference between it and other medical conditions is **how likely it is to affect the other person's decision to consent**. The reason I don't disclose that I have a heart condition with every potential partner is not because it's not medically relevant, but because the odds of that materially affecting their decision are extremely low. Nobody cares. As for HIV though, *lots* of people care. If I was HIV+, the odds of if affecting their decision is statistically several orders of magnitude higher.

Now the bar of how common a preference has to be before it can said to ""be reasonable likely to affect someone's decision to consent"" and voluntary disclosure should be expected is absolutely up for debate. But *that* is what the nature of the bar is not one of medical relevance, or any other criteria."

For someone not venturing out into the mountains, I would think a set of all-seasons for Seattle weather would be more than sufficient. I wouldn't fault anyone for buying winter tires though, because hey, it's your money at the end of the day. Studded tires however actually damage the roads in addition to being unnecessary."
AskReddit,fech3v8,t1_fecef5o,1578973775.0,"**It does not matter if it will hurt them or not.** You keep harping on this point, but it is completely and utterly irrelevant. If you have a reasonable cause to believe that information you have not disclosed would cause the other person to withdraw their consent, you have a moral imperative to disclose that information, especially if they ask, but even if they do not. When people say ""consent"", in practice they mean ""*informed* consent"". Deliberately withholding information you can reasonably expect would affect their decision (HIV+ status absolutely falls into this category, even if you think people are stupid for doing so), means that you do not actually have consent. Of course the burden is on the HIV+ person to disclose. It *has* to be, because they are the only one initially party to the relevant information.

* You agree that people can have whatever preferences they want.
* You agree that those preferences do not have to conform to medical necessity
* You agree that people don't have the right to override the preferences of their partner
* But then you say that they shouldn't have to disclose because it's not medically necessary. This is inconsistent with your own argument.

TL;DR; The question of withholding information is not whether or not it is medically relevant, or any qualitative or objective valuation of the information. It is simply a matter of whether you can reasonably expect disclosure of that information to affect the other party's decision to consent. That's it."

AskReddit,fdrvp8x,t1_fdrpv68,1578690419.0,"Virus scanners use databases of specific byte patterns you aren't going to memorize, and heuristics you aren't going to replicate with your eyeballs and a hex editor (and often don't work very well regardless) Honestly, I'm pretty throughly convinced you just have no idea what you are talking about at this point, so w/e. It's not ""very obvious"" what a program does just by looking at the hex, and the fact that you say it is tells me you have very little knowledge of how machine code actually works."
AskReddit,fdrnk0m,t1_fdrmiqf,1578687029.0,"Oxygen, potentially. Water it turns out is *really* useful for life though, which is why most scientists looking for life are starting by looking for water. For example, the fact that it exists as a solid liquid and gas at relatively close temperatures to each other, and the fact that it is a near universal solvent. Still it's not ""necessarily"" required, but it would be difficult to replace to put it lightly. As for things like temperatures, again it's ""possible"" but it makes things difficult (in part due to the water thing). Then there are still other factors like a proper atmosphere. Without the ozone layer, radiation would likely have prevented life from ever really getting off the ground.

TL;DR; No one thing is strictly a deal breaker, but there are a lot of boxes to check, maybe not in the exact way we check them on Earth, but in some way, and the vast majority of planets don't check them all."

AskReddit,fdrm55z,t3_emw5fb,1578686411.0,Because there are tons of factors that need to be just right for life (as we know it at least) to form on a planet. Min and Max temperatures within a certain range. Liquid water.  A certain level of general habitability (e.g. constant acid rain like on Venus is not conducive to life). Atmospheric and core composition. Gravity. The odds of all of these things lining up just right after infinitesimally small. Even one of our planets making the cut is a miracle in and if itself.
AskReddit,fdrj6cr,t1_fdrhy6t,1578685204.0,"Really though? The idea that the average person can tell what a program does via looking at it in a hex editor is laughable. Even looking at the actual source code it's really hard to tell what any program of a reasonable size is doing unless you know the language, are spending days to weeks looking through it all, and it's well commented. Expecting the average laymen to tell via looking at raw binary for an instruction set they probably don't even know the name of, let alone understand? Short of the ""virus"" using the exact string ""now hack all their stuff, lolz"" in the source somewhere, that's not going to tell you anything without a CS degree and more time on your hands than anyone that's not a security professional is going to spend on analysis. 

And security professionals aren't going to start with a hex editor either. They are going to use specialised tools to decompile the program or at least show it in actual assembly.

Also, an exe not having text does not mean it is ""encrypted"". It just means that the program isn't dealing with ASCII (or some other encoding your hex editor understands) string literals."
