MoviesAnywhere,ff4m6bg,t3_ent7p5,1579566973.0,"I have 160 movies available on every platform I use plus a few that I don't use. Thanks to Google Play/YouTube Movies being a partner, my movies are available on almost every device I've ever used. The other 25 or so movies I have available on Vudu would be absolutely great to have on MA but the 160 I do have are so much more than I would have been able to watch before. Vudu simply doesn't work on every device. But one of Google Play/YouTube, iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, FNow works on 99% of all devices, regardless of their age.

3 years ago, I had 8 movies I could only watch through Google Play, 4 I could only watch on iTunes, and 20-30 that I could only watch on Vudu or one of the other dead or dying UV retailers (I started building on Best Buy CinemaNow so thank God for fucking UV and Vudu.) Now I have 160 that I can watch on any of those services, 0 I can only watch on iTunes, 2 I can only watch on Google Play (but they were free and I don't care), and 25 or so that I can only watch on Vudu. (Also to be fair, one of the iTunes ones was the 2009 Star Trek which I re-bought and activated with Vudu so I can technically watch it on both but not because of MA)

Maybe it won't be that long of course but it is certainly weird for a team with a history of having a detached fanbase that doesn't care about their on-field product to turn a contending team into a seller, despite obviously having the funds to continue to be competitive. (I know there are plenty of actual Cubs fans who love the sport but living in Chicago when the Cubs were bad, I knew a lot of people who only went to Wrigley Field as an excuse to get day drunk).

> * Contrary to the Arrow 2040 flashback, Mar Novu is killed, though i dont know if this is explained or not, by Harbinger/Lyla, under the control of Anti Monitor (this happens in the Supergirl episode)

TRUE

> * On The Spectre's order Supergirl and Flash travel to different earths, to gather heroes, there are Titan's cameos and also an Ezra Miller Flash cameo, among others

MOSTLY FALSE. The premise is wrong, as Spectre hadn't appeared yet. Flash did not travel to different earths. Supergirl went to one Earth. The Titans cameo was reused footage. But there was the Ezra cameo. 

 > * Supergirl and Flash bring A LOT of heroes back, including a fully suited Batman Beyond (who comes from Kevin Conroy's old Bruce earth) as well as a year 3 Batman

FALSE. Conroy's Bruce isn't even from a Batman Beyond Earth 

> * Kingdom Come Superman is a tank, he's initially untrustworthy of the heroes and casually beats CW superman, Welling Superman and Supergirl all at the same time, though he is convinced to calm down

FALSE. He isn't initially untrustworthy of anybody. Only fights because of Luthor. Only fights CW Superman, as Welling and Supergirl aren't even there. And it's an even match. 


 > * Throughout the Supergirl, Batwoman and Flash episodes there's a dilemma that only 5 Earth's can be saved and there's a huge debate as to which earths should be the ones merged to be saved

FALSE. Just outright didn't happen. 

> * Supergirl and The Flash both die at the end of the Flash portion

FALSE

> * Oliver does not die, he instead becomes the new monitor

FALSE

> * The final battle is a battle between Mar Novu and Kingdom Come superman, Darkseid as well as Monitor Oliver

FALSE Lmao what Darkseid?

ScottishPeopleTwitter,fe0bahw,t1_fe06vr9,1578808528.0,"William would have been an infant king and Andrew would have been Prince Regent, i.e. he'd have the responsibilities of king until William became old enough to take the crown.

I think you understood it right but said it wrong. If each first born is A, then AAA (first born of the first born of the first born, i.e. William) and AAB (second born of the first born of the first born, i.e. Harry) both beat AB (second born of the first born i.e. Andrew.)

So then it would be alphabetical

1. A is Charles
2. AA is William
3. AAA is George
4. AAB is Charlotte
5. AAC is Louis
6. AB is Harry
7. ABA is Archie
8. B is Andrew
9. BA is Andrew's daughter Beatrice
10. BB is Andrew's second daughter Eugenie
11. C is Prince Edward
12. CA is Edward's son James
13. CB is Edward's daughter Louise
14. D is Princess Anne

Etc. Etc."
ScottishPeopleTwitter,fdzwfda,t1_fdzucie,1578797430.0,"It's a recursive thing. Basically the firstborn is first in line. Then his first born. Then his first born, and so on. If anybody has no children, then the second born follows the first born, then the third born, etc. If there are no more children, then the previous second born is next, etc.

So Charles is Elizabeth's firstborn, so he's first in line.

Andrew is Elizabeth's second born, so when he was born, he was second in line.

William is Charles' first born, so when he was born, he became second and Andrew became third.

Harry is Charles' second born, so when he was born, he became third and Andrew became fourth.

George is William's first born, so when he was born, he became third, Harry became fourth and Andrew became fifth

Charlotte is William's second born, so when she was born, she became fourth, Harry became fifth, and Andrew became sixth.

And then Louis is William's third, making Harry sixth in line and Andrew eighth (because Harry's first born Archie is one behind Harry)

So for Harry to become king, Elizabeth, Charles, William, and all three of William's kids would have to die. Though he would be in charge of the kids if they survived and the other three died, at least until George was old enough to take on the throne."
