There were a few better variants (eg Stanton 980LZS, which was a low output version) which were revisions of the 881S/XSV3000, but it was Stanton’s best cartridge for a few years, and was still available until the mid-2000’s. It had a slightly flatter frequency response than the Pickering XSV3000 according to Pickering/Stanton insiders, but was basically a slightly modified version of that. The main difference is the way the styli fit, and the brushes, between the Pickering and Stanton versions, but the styli are interchangeable – I’ve got a Pickering stylus on my 881S at present. There was also an 880S, which was an uncalibrated version - that just meant it hadn't been tested by Stanton before sale, but they were probably almost identical in performance.

The Pickering XSV3000, which was released in 1976, superseded the Shure V15 Type III as the world’s best MM in the mid-70’s in the opinion of most reviewers of the time, the Stanton 881S then was very slightly better, and in 1978 Shure introduced the V15 Type IV in response to them. The ‘S’ stands for stereohedron, which is Stanton’s version of JVC’s Shibata, with very slightly different stylus cuts, but equivalent performance.
