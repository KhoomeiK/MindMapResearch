DeadSpace,feq83pn,t1_feq2e78,1579338692.0,You either use vsync which locks the game to 30fps or turn it off to uncap the frame rate which completely messes with the physics. Playing with a mouse is bad either way but even worse without vsync as well.

If you and a bunch of people are sitting around physically but all seeing a completely virtual space then that's VR, what's the point of that?
