But it kind of sounds like you are already half way there, because you can identify situations that are happening, and you are aware of what emotion matches up with what actions.  So it seems like you have to work on getting in touch with the actual emotion.  Perhaps by setting boundaries (there is a good chart about it on r/SelfCareCharts ) called 'How to establish boundaries'  [https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfCareCharts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfCareCharts/) . By seeing the actions playing out in front of you, and having boundaries set so you don't feel like you are getting hurt by others, you can identify the feelings, and start to get in touch with what anger, for example, feels like.

 Something that can be helpful if you find yourself getting overwhelmed, or anxious, is a technique to use to relax. It is called ""**Progressive Relaxation**"". It can be very relaxing and soothing, and maybe it could help you. I'll put a link in here for you to check out, but just Google it if you want even more info about it-----

mentalhealth,ff83sfo,t3_es4gw4,1579665226.0," ""Positive Affirmations"". I know it probably sounds silly and lame, how can telling myself positive things really have any effect on my mind/thoughts/feelings/self esteem. If you want to try and change the negative thinking/self esteem, you have to try the opposite (it takes a ***lot*** of practise!). Obviously I don't know how familiar you are with the whole thing, so I will copy a couple of paragraphs from a site that might be helpful to you, and then I will post a link to the article for you to read more if you want to see what it's all about. -------

**What Are Words Of Affirmation?**

Positive affirmations are so much more than just feel good quotes and positive statements.

In short, **positive affirmations are statements that are repeated to encourage and uplift the person speaking them.**

In reality, a positive affirmation is actually part of the language of the brain.

We’ll explain more about this in the next section, but for now, let’s look at the elements that make up a positive affirmation.

***3 Elements Of Successful Affirmations***

Because positive affirmations are written in the language of the brain, they follow a specific formula.

If you come across a quote on the Internet or in a book that claims to be a positive affirmation, but doesn’t follow this formula, **your brain won’t register the thought accurately.**

It turns out, our brains are pretty strict and straightforward about their language rules.

[1) Positive affirmations](https://blog.mindvalley.com/positive-affirmations/) are *always* in the **present tense**. If you see a positive affirmation that says “I will,” “I used to” or “I’m going to,” move on. **Your brain only responds to present tense statements.**

2) Positive affirmations only include *positive* words. If you see a positive affirmation that has words like “don’t,” “can’t” or “won’t,” it’s not a statement you’ll want to repeat. **It takes your brain a lot of extra work to get past negative statements and transform them into positive ones.**

3) Positive affirmations are spoken as **statements of fact and truth**. Statements that contain words like “might” and “could” aren’t nearly as powerful as statements that contain words like “am” and “do.”

mentalhealth,ff83080,t3_es4vea,1579664637.0,"I'm so sorry that happened at your first appointment.  I can't imagine how heart breaking that must have felt for you, and how hard it must be to not feel like a professional wasn't there for you and didn't take you seriously because of your age.

That's good that you feel like your mood has improved.  Do you think you could consider trying a different doctor now that some time has passed?  I know it probably feels like a terrible idea, but if you still feel like you could use some help, maybe you could consider seeing a different doctor?  Not all doctors are the same, with the same philosophies.  Could you look into available doctors in your area, and see if any of them specialize in younger folks?  Maybe that was the problem with the one you saw, maybe she just didn't have much experience with people in your general age range.  There can be a difference when it comes to adult/teens medication, as meds are researched based on adults, and sometimes younger folks have different reactions to medications.  So maybe she just wan't experienced enough to feel confident prescribing you something.  Not trying to defend her by any means.  Just trying to think of a reason that happened to you.

Again, I'm sorry your first appointment didn't go well.  I hope that if you still feel you need help, you will eventually get to a place you feel you could try it again, with a different doctor.  They really aren't all the same.  Hang in there!"

mentalhealth,ff80uyg,t3_es5noh,1579663065.0,"Congrats on going to your first appointment!  Sometimes that is one of the hardest things to get ourselves to do.  Way to go, give yourself credit for that!

Something you might want to consider is writing yourself some notes before your first appointment.  Things that are important so that you don't forget when you're in the moment.  Anything you can think of from your history that is significant.  Just anything you think of that you would want your therapist to know.  Think about your family history too (like is there anyone in the family that has a mental illness; if so, do you know what medications they are on (if any); things like that). 

Write down any specific symptoms you may be having that you don't want to forget to tell them.  25 minutes can go by quickly, don't want to waste time by  forgetting important stuff.

Also a big suggestion is to be as completely honest as you can with them.  They can't help what they don't know.  The more honest information they have, the more accurate they can be in their diagnosis.  (Just for example, if they ask if you do any drugs, be honest if you do, even if it is usually something you wouldn't want to admit to; and be honest as to frequency and amount you use).

 You don't have to do it all at once, if you think that would be too overwhelming. You could start small, add more things. It is also something you have to '*make'* yourself do, whether you *'feel'* like it or not. When I say start small, I mean like set a time to get up, and maybe one other thing, like have a shower, or do the dishes, or something more fun (if you have a hobby, for example; sometimes if you start with something fun, versus a chore, it is more appealing, and gives you a better chance at achieving that goal that day). For example: If you are currently getting up at 11, but wish to change that to earlier, set your next day routine to get up at 10:30. It's realistic to make a half an hour change, whereas it would probably be too much to go from 11 am, to say, 8 am, for an example. So if a goal is to wake up earlier, change it by the most 1/2 an hour, and slightly adjust it a bit every few days, until you've reached an optimal time for yourself to get up. Even if that means going to bed a bit earlier than usual, so you can get up easier.

Then the idea would be to keep adding one more thing to your routine until you have several things to do in a day. Small steps at a time. Ex: time to get up, time to eat breakfast, time to get some exercise, time to have some fun, time to socialize, time to eat other meals, time to do chores, time to relax, time to go to bed. But adding them in slowly, so you don't overwhelm yourself. Small, achievable goals. If you start to feel it is too much, drop one goal until you are comfortable again, and then add in one more.

Something else that can sometimes help is distraction and/or self-soothing techniques.

I know this might seem really silly and lame, but my friend and I used to do this to help get rid of things that we did that bothered us, or things we needed to 'let go'.

We would write down *everything* to do with 'the thing' we wanted to get rid of from our minds. So whether it took one page of purging our thoughts/feelings, or ten pages. We just wrote down everything about 'the thing'. (If there was more than one 'thing', we did separate 'ceremonies' for each 'thing').

Then when it was all written out, we would read out loud to each other what we wrote, we talked about it as much as was needed, answered any lingering questions, Just talked it out until there was nothing left to talk about regarding 'the thing'. (if you don't have someone to read it to, just reading out loud to yourself is fine too).

Then the next step was to find an appropriate can/container to rip up all of our pages we wrote and place them in the can. Then we took the can outside, with a match/lighter, and with a bottle of water (to douse the flame after ward).

Then we set it on fire (in a safe place, in a safe container/can), said some words about we are now letting this 'thing' go, sending it out into the universe, and we will no longer be troubled/bothered/think about it ever again. Watched the flame glow, and the smoke go up into the air. Then douse the flame after it has burned up.

Like I said, sounds totally silly, but the whole process of purging the thoughts/feelings, writing it all out, talking about it out loud, then ripping it up and burning it, letting it go into the universe, was a quite freeing experience. (It may also have to be done more than once).

Maybe you could give something like that a try?"
mentalhealth,ff5kt85,t3_erorgi,1579597685.0,"I'm so sorry to hear all that you went through growing up.  The fact you made it through and are a great and successful person today is amazing, and I hope you give yourself a lot of credit for that.  Do you have a doctor/therapist/counsellor that you see?  If not, how about looking into seeing one.  Maybe some counselling would be helpful and they can guide you through some processes to deal with all the hurt and anger and emotions you are still having.  

terraincognita had a good suggestion of writing letters.  Whether you send them to the School Board, or to the actual teachers, or even if you just write it all out for yourself and don't send it any where.  Going through the process of writing it all out completely could be therapeutic for you.

 Assuming that everything happened the way you said it happened ( not to imply you are lying or anything like that,  it's just that we can all be a bit biased as to how something went down because we see it from our side, with our feelings, and our interpretations of the situation; like the saying that there are three sides to a story---his, hers, and the truth; so I hope you realize what I am saying, I don't doubt your interpretation, just saying that there could also be more to it from another's perspective).  Anyway, if it happened just like you said, to me, it sounds like she was the manipulative one. 

 I must admit I don't know a lot about polyamory, but isn't an important part of it be that all the parties involved have an open, honest, trusting, and communicative relationship?  That all parties agree to the rules, and do what everyone is comfortable with and have ground rules?  If so, she didn't respect your feelings and ideas of your needs in this relationship.  As terrible as it is to go through a break up like that, perhaps she just wasn't the right one for you, if she was so willing to forgo your thoughts, feelings, opinions, and your boundaries.  I don't mean to sound harsh about that, but you have to do what is best for you, and if she couldn't take your feelings into account, that relationship may have also turned out to be abusive.  I know that doesn't help you feel better.  Again, I am sorry you are having to go through this.

It may be worth checking out, as well as some of their other self care charts, to help you through this difficult time.  Take care of yourself while you are healing from this situation.  Give yourself some time to grieve, get enough rest/sleep, keep your nutrition and hydration levels up, talk to some friends and/or family that you feel comfortable sharing with.  If you journal, write down your thoughts and feelings, use 'distraction' and 'self soothing' techniques to take your mind off of things.  Practise some relaxation techniques and deep breathing.  Try not to ruminate on things (use distraction, I'll copy some ideas here for you).  If you have a counsellor or therapist, consider seeing them.

AskPsychiatry,ff4luxc,t3_erlz5m,1579566752.0,"Maybe you could explore your mind regarding what exactly it is that scares you.  Write down on paper the pros and cons of going to see a psychiatrist and be specific about your fears.  Maybe some of the issues can be addressed.  Ex: are you afraid of a male doctor versus a female?  Would seeing a younger doctor versus an older doctor be better for you?  (then your doctor could put in a referral to the psych doc you would want to see).  Would  you feel safer if you had a friend or family member go to the appointment with you? Could they stay in the waiting room, or would you want them to come into the office with you?  Is there an object you could bring to the appointment with you that would help you feel more calm (ex: a stuffed animal, a lucky key chain, a small blanket, a worry stone, etc).  Do you tend to have more anxiety in the morning (if so, then arrange an afternoon appointment; or vice versa if you have more anxiety in the afternoon).  Is there a scent that helps calm you, that you could take with you? (Ex: let's say lavender calms you; put a small dab of it on a cloth, and take the cloth to sniff during your appointment). Do deep breathing and relaxation exercises to decrease the anxiety.

If you agree to see someone, can you discuss your fears with them on your first appointment, so you can address your fears and get reassurance .  You are right in that they are there to help you, they are just regular people who have happened to study psychiatry.  Sorry if you had a bad experience as a child, but it doesn't mean the same thing would happen now.  

Maybe if you did the pros/cons list, you could see the benefit of going, and remind yourself of all the positive things, and use 'self-talk' to highlight the positives, to help your mind get over the fear.  Ex: focusing on the positives, rather than any negatives, will help your mind focus more on the good, and help your anxiety decrease. Do the deep breathing/relaxation, use visualization to imagine a positive doctors appointment."
mentalhealth,ff4huu9,t1_ff4ggvh,1579563984.0,"You're welcome.  Of course, I would suggest a therapist, but if you are not in a place within yourself, and that you just can't face that right now, then there is no point in trying to 'force' you into seeing one.  A therapist is there to listen to you, and help challenge your mind into thinking in a different manner, offer suggestions, and help you through things.  If you don't want to see one, you probably wouldn't be open to their suggestions and their methods, so it would be pointless.  Perhaps in the future, you might be willing to give it a try (and if that's the case, great; you have the option of changing your mind any time), but it has to be your decision.  I think it is natural for people who care about you to suggest it, because they want to help you and wish you could feel better (they can feel helpless, and just want the best for you).  But there are some things you can try, as suggested above in my previous comment.  Unfortunately, whether one is seeing a therapist, or tackling it on their own, one does have to put work into getting better.  A therapist doesn't have 'magical words"" that can heal you, they can just help you guide yourself through treatment.  So whichever way one chooses, they have to put work into the process that they choose.  Hang in there, it can get better!"

Sorry to hear you are struggling right now. I know this is probably going to sound silly and irrelevant, but sometimes making a routine for ourselves can be really helpful. Making a routine can help decrease stress, and can help you fit what you need to do in a day in an organized, achievable way and have-----

* Better Time Management. (Having daily habits helps to organize your time during the day because you're following a specific pattern of activities).
* Self-discipline.
* Focus.
* A Healthy Balance.

You don't have to do it all at once, if you think that would be too overwhelming. You could start small, add more things. It is also something you have to '*make'* yourself do, whether you *'feel'* like it or not. When I say start small, I mean like set a time to get up, and maybe one other thing, like have a shower, or do the dishes, or something more fun (if you have a hobby, for example; sometimes if you start with something fun, versus a chore, it is more appealing, and gives you a better chance at achieving that goal that day). For example: If you are currently getting up at 11, but wish to change that to earlier, set your next day routine to get up at 10:30. It's realistic to make a half an hour change, whereas it would probably be too much to go from 11 am, to say, 8 am, for an example. So if a goal is to wake up earlier, change it by the most 1/2 an hour, and slightly adjust it a bit every few days, until you've reached an optimal time for yourself to get up. Even if that means going to bed a bit earlier than usual, so you can get up easier.

Then the idea would be to keep adding one more thing to your routine until you have several things to do in a day. Small steps at a time. Ex: time to get up, time to eat breakfast, time to go to work, time to get some exercise, time to have some fun, time to socialize, time to eat other meals, time to do chores, time to relax, time to go to bed. But adding them in slowly, so you don't overwhelm yourself. Small, achievable goals. If you start to feel it is too much, drop one goal until you are comfortable again, and then add in one more.

Something else that can sometimes help is distraction and/or self-soothing techniques. If making goals for yourself is giving you some anxiety, and if the types of things adults have to do, like chores, is just too much right now, at least schedule yourself something fun to do. I'll copy a list of distraction ideas I have for you here-----

mentalhealth,ff41hvo,t3_eri5wy,1579553496.0,"It can be really hard to reach out, especially the first time, even though one knows it is in their best interest to do so.  A couple of suggestions might be to write down on a piece of paper what you would say to the receptionist that answers the phone.  Write down a 'pretend' script of the call.  ""Hello, my name is ""name' and I would like to book an appointment with ""therapist"".  Imagine the receptionist saying, okay, we have these appointments available ""dates"".  Okay, the one on ""date"" would work well for me"".  Give name, number, and other info they need.  ""Thank you, good bye"".  

Practise picking up the phone and imagine dialling the number.  Imagine the conversation; use visualization to picture yourself making the call and it going well.  Imagine any other questions you might have, write them down too.  Eg: if you have questions about where to park, or if you are taking a bus, or how long the appointment is for, anything that pops into your mind, writ it down ahead of time.  Do keep in mind you will probably be talking to the receptionist, not the actual therapist when making your appointment.

 When you go to actually do the call, have your calendar book/phone calendar out so you can check the day and time of the suggested appointment date to make sure you are available. If they will be asking for any medical card numbers, keep your wallet nearby so you can easily grab whatever card you need.  Keep a pen and paper near you when you call, in case you need to write down an address, or phone number, or anything. Ask them if they call a day or so prior to the appointment to confirm you are still coming (or do you need to call them to confirm).

Practise out loud if you need to, as many times as you need to.  Even ask a friend to practise the call with you (have your friend play the receptionist role).  Imagine the whole process in a positive light, focus on the call going well. 

Get yourself prepared, and then just make yourself do it (if you have to, set a goal for yourself eg: "" I WILL call the therapists office on Friday,  January 'whatever' by 2 pm"").  Nothing bad will happen.  I'm sure the receptionist talks to nervous people all the time, and deals with people in a professional and polite manner.  Keep in mind they are there to help.  You can do it!!  :)"

mentalhealth,ff0zu1c,t3_eqyzqt,1579473864.0,"Sorry to hear you are having such a struggle right now. It can be really hard when you don't have motivation to find it.  A suggestion I have is easy on paper, but can be hard to actually do , and that is to make a routine for yourself.  It has to be realistic, start small, add more things.  It is also something you have to '*make'* yourself do, whether you *'feel'* like it or not.  Making a routine can help decrease stress, and can help you fit what you need to do in a day in an organized, achievable way.  When I say start small, I mean like set a time to get up, and maybe one other thing, like have a shower, or do the dishes, or something more fun (if you have a hobby, for example; sometimes if you start with something fun, versus a chore, it is more appealing, and gives you a better chance at achieving that goal that day).  If you are currently getting up at 11, but wish to change that to earlier, set your next day routine to get up at 10:30.  It's realistic to make a half an hour change, whereas it would probably be too much to go from 11 am, to say, 8 am, for an example.  So if a goal is to wake up earlier, change it by the most 1/2 an hour, and slightly adjust it a bit every few days, until you've reached an optimal time for yourself to get up.  Even if that means going to bed a bit earlier than usual, so you can get up easier.

Then the idea would be to keep adding one more thing to your routine until you have several things to do in a day.  Small steps at a time.  Ex: time to get up, time to eat breakfast, time to look for a job, time to get some exercise, time to have some fun, time to socialize, time to eat other meals, time to do chores, time to relax, time to go to bed.  But adding them in slowly, so you don't overwhelm yourself. Small, achievable goals.  If you start to feel it is too much, drop one goal until you are comfortable again, and then add in one more.  

Something else that can sometimes help is distraction and/or self-soothing techniques.  If making goals for yourself is giving you some anxiety, and if the types of things adults have to do, like chores, is just too much right now, at least schedule yourself something fun to do.  I'll copy a list of distraction ideas I have for you here-----

AskPsychiatry,fevwuyp,t1_fevso0m,1579402471.0,"If he is at home, they can't really do anything besides really encouraging and reassuring him to take the meds.  Try to educate him as to the necessity of it (assuming that's what the doctor thinks he really needs), and just verbally try to persuade him to take them.  If he is in the hospital however, against his will, and again, assuming the doctor really thinks he needs them to help stabilize him, if he refuses to take his meds orally, they can give him an injection.  It's not something that's just done on a whim, they have to consult that medication is absolutely necessary, and if he is committed (he would have been seen by two different psychiatrists to commit him), they have to make the best decision in the best interest of his mental health.  So if determined he does indeed need meds, his choice would be to take them orally, or be given an injection.  Then hopefully, when his next dose is due, he takes it orally to avoid another injection.  It may sound cruel, but they have to do something to get him stabalized enough so that he can make his own decisions."
AskPsychiatry,fevkwzo,t3_eqot42,1579398632.0,"I think your idea of calling his psychiatrist is a very good idea.  This sounds like it is too much to expect family members to be able to handle well on their own.  Sounds like he needs professional intervention.  I can understand your Mom would be upset at seeing one of her children being taken to a hospital against their will (if this is indeed the suggested intervention the doctor makes), but hopefully she can see the bigger picture----That he is in mental distress right now, has poor judgement, and can't take proper care of himself right now. (he could also be a danger to himself and/or others too).   

If he needs to be hospitalized, they can help, possibly adjusting his meds, and giving him a safe place with professionals that know how to help someone who is going through such a time as  your brother.  I get that it probably seems really harsh to have a doctor say he needs to go to hospital, whether or not he is willing, but it is ultimately in his best interest, to help stabalize his mental health and get him back on the road to recovery.  If things start to escalate even more before the doctor can be contacted, you can always call the police, if necessary.  I hope things turnout okay for you and your family.  Don't forget to take care of yourself, too, during this difficult time."

I am wondering if you had all these ideas and plans, but accidentally overwhelmed yourself?  Sometimes changing a whole bunch of things at one time can just be too much to do all at once.  Maybe have a look at all the ideas you had and your pinterest boards you made, and pick one thing to start on.  Then when you have worked on that one thing for a while, and you feel you have a handle on it, add one more thing into your routine.  Take it in small, manageable pieces.  It may take longer, but it may seem more do-able by breaking it down into small steps at a time.  Don't give up on yourself, you can do it.  Just take it one thing at a time, and hopefully that motivation will kick in again."

It does sound like a good idea to move to a different room, sometimes it's just takes some small changes to help us feel a little bit better.  I realize you said you are working part time and are taking certifications, so  I get you are probably busy and maybe don't have a  lot of extra cash on hand.  But I was thinking that if you are moving into a new room, it might be a good idea decorating it with things that generally make you happy.  Take the things from your room that you really like, things that make you happy, or peaceful, or calm, or have good memories attached to them, or whatever, and make your new room into a happy room.  Maybe you could spare a few dollars and go to a local thrift store to see if they have any posters or decorations that give you a good vibe, and add them to your new room.  Maybe changing your external environment into a happy place will  help a bit with your internal feelings.

You might need to consider calling her regular doctor (GP) and tell them what's going on.  If they are worried about her, they might recommend her going to the hospital for a psych evaluation.  And as drastic as this sounds, if there are legitimate concerns here, it might have to be against her will, for her own safety, and safety of others.  (Since you mentioned she freaks out at even just the mention of seeing a psychiatrist).  Maybe she will listen to her regular/family GP, or maybe they will have to utilize the police to escort her to hospital.  It sounds like something needs to be done, since she has suffered with this for so long, and it's not getting better.  I know this probably sounds harsh, but if she won't go willingly, and if you tell the doc all what is going on and they think it is serious enough to have her evaluated, she might have to go whether she wants to or not.

It feels awkward at first, but now I do it out of habit, and don't even realize I am doing it.  Maybe you could try that, even if it feels weird at first.  If someone does ask, you can always say something like ""oh, that is from an old accident"" and change the subject.  You don't owe anyone an explanation, it's okay to not answer,and change the subject.  (eg: oh that's something I would rather not discuss at work).

Unless something way more serious happens, I would push through and see if things settle down.  But then call your doc when you can.  That's just my personal opinion, I am not a doctor, so just going by my own experiences that sometimes your body needs a few days to adjust, and although I realize your symptoms are very uncomfortable, you don't seem to have had a life threatening reaction to them, so I would be inclined to continue, but that's just me.

Could you  consider going to the hospital and see about getting admitted to a psych ward for your own safety?

But I looked it up, and it does include survivors of someones suicide.  I'll copy a bit from the site I looked up, then give you the link.  If you want to look it up yourself, Google something like ""Suicide Survivor's Guilt"", or ""Survivor's guilt related to someones suicide"", or something along those lines.  It was not your fault, there wasn't any way you could have known, and I'd bet that your Aunt and Uncle don't think you let them down.  I know it won't matter that I, a stranger on Reddit, am saying that, I know you believe it, but I honestly think it's part of the survivors guilt making you think that way. You didn't do anything wrong. I'm sorry you are having such a struggle right now.

 Here's the quote I copied--------->>>>>>

**Survivor guilt** (or **survivor's guilt**; also called **survivor syndrome** or **survivor's syndrome** and **survivor disorder** or **survivor's disorder**) is a mental condition that occurs when a person believes they have done something wrong by surviving a traumatic event when others did not, often feeling self-guilt.

The experience and manifestation of survivor's [guilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_(emotion)) will depend on an individual's psychological profile. When the [*Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders) *IV* (DSM-IV) was published, survivor guilt was removed as a recognized specific diagnosis, and redefined as a significant symptom of [post-traumatic stress disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder) (PTSD). It may be found among survivors of [combat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat), [epidemics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic), [murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder), [natural disasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster), [rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape), [terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism), **among the friends and family of those who have died by** [**suicide**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide)**,** and in non-mortal situations**.**

I wish I had some magical words for you that would take away your pain, but I'm afraid I don't.  It does kind of sound to me that you might be going through some kind of ""Survivor's Guilt"".  Maybe you could Google that and see if you think it fits.  It's okay to reach out for help to get through this difficult situation.  Maybe you have a doctor, or a therapist or counsellor that you could go see?  Or look into finding someone.  I know you aid you were fearful, but it's really not so scary.  they are there to help you, and even if you are having 'thoughts', it doesn't mean you will act on them, and they can tell the difference.  You stated you don't want to harm yourself, so if you did seek help, express that to them as you did here, that you will not harm yourself.  Again, I'm so sorry for your loss."

Something that might help you is to set yourself up a routine, so that you don't end up wasting your time off (eg: sleeping all day and not doing anything).  Sure, give yourself a couple of days to rest up and relax, but not too long, or it will become habit.  So when you are ready, set a time to wake up each day, to eat meals, to get some exercise, time to practise relaxation, time to socialize/talk with friends, etc.  And then stick to the routine (whether you 'feel' like it or not).  

 

Something that can be helpful if you find yourself getting overwhelmed, or anxious, is  a technique to use to relax. It is called ""Progressive Relaxation"". It can be very relaxing and soothing, and maybe it could help you. I'll put a link in here for you to check out, but just Google it if you want even more info about it-----

mentalhealth,fenobgs,t3_eq3eep,1579288479.0,"Sorry you are having a rough time right now.  It can be hard to get one self motivated when having a hard time, but sometimes you really just have to '*make*' yourself do something even if you don't *'feel'* like it.  Maybe making a routine for yourself each day with a goal or two might be helpful.  Like if you need to shower, make that your goal (ex: today I WILL shower"").  Give yourself one or two small things to achieve each day, not too many, so you don't overwhelm yourself.  Also make a routine, with a time to get up each day, a time to eat, a time to do work/school/whatever, a time to relax, a time for exercise, etc.

mentalhealth,felq5ag,t3_eprxnq,1579228230.0,"This is something that you can control if you think you can put some work into changing your behaviour.  I understand when someone is going through something and they end up being irritable or 'snappy' as you said, and it feels like the mean things 'just come out'.  But like you said, you don't want it to start pushing your friends away, so I think you need to really make a conscientious decision to stop the behaviour in yourself that you don't like.  

Perhaps something you can try is when you feel like your mood has changed, and someone says something or asks you something and it is a time you would normally be 'snappy', take a deep breathe and count five seconds in your mind before you respond.  It may sound silly, and it may be hard to do at first, but by taking a deep breathe, and giving yourself a few seconds, you can use those few moments to collect your thoughts and think to yourself ""how do I really want to respond"".  It can give you just enough time to stop yourself from saying something mean or hurtful, and give yourself a chance to respond in a more appropriate manner.  If you practise it enough, it will feel more natural. 

 If your friends are aware you are making a true effort to change, they will probably understand you taking a few moments to respond to them.  Then if you do accidentally slip and say something you regret, they will at least have been observing you really try to change, and may be more willing to accept your apology, as it will seem more sincere, since they see you practising the breathe/count method to change your ways.

Also if you do goof up, I have seen a chart on a sub called r/SelfCareCharts called ""The Five Languages Of Apology"" that you may want to check out, showing a good process of apologies.  I'll copy the link here for you-------

mentalhealth,fellygf,t3_eps1df,1579225340.0," I had shared this with some one else who asked about how to let things go, I will copy it here for  you, too-----

**Letting go**\--------

I know this will probably seem really silly and dumb, but my friend and I used to do this to help get rid of things that we did that bothered us, or things we needed to let go.

We would write down everything to do with 'the thing' we wanted to get rid of from our minds. So whether it took one page of purging our thoughts/feelings, or ten pages. We just wrote down everything about 'the thing'.  (If there was more than one 'thing', we did separate 'ceremonies' for each 'thing').

Then when it was all written out, we would read out loud to each other what we wrote, we talked about it as much as was needed, answered any lingering questions, just talked it out until there was nothing left to talk about regarding 'the thing'. (if you don't have someone to read it to, just reading out loud to yourself is fine too).

Then the next step was to find an appropriate can/container to rip up all of our pages we wrote and place them in the can. Then we took the can outside, with a match/lighter, and with a bottle of water (to douse the flame after ward).

Then we set it on fire (in a safe place), said some words about we are now letting this 'thing' go, sending it out into the universe, and we will no longer be troubled/bothered/think about it ever again. Watched the flame glow, and the smoke go up into the air. Then douse the flame after it has burned up.

Like I said, sounds totally silly, but the whole process of purging the thoughts/feelings, writing it all out, talking about it out loud, then ripping it up and burning it, letting it go into the universe, was a quite freeing experience. (It may also have to be done more than once).

Maybe you could give something like that a try?"
