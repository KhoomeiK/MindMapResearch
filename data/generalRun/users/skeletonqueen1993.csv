loseit,ffc5jf2,t3_esol5i,1579792024.0,"First of all congrats!! If you want to be proactive, here are a few things that will HELP (unfortunately not completely fix the problem)

1. Drink water. And I mean a fuck ton of water. It’s helps with skins elasticity.

2. Take a collagen supplement. Once again it helps with skin elasticity.

3. Use a retinol/aloe/hyaluronic acid cream or lotion on your loose skin. It helps amplify cell turnover so new skin cells form. 

Best of luck, and congrats again!!"
