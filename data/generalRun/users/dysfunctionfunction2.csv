My twin brother was found unresponsive two days later, & passed 5 days after that. His death was completely unexpected. I thought it was just because we were twins, but it still continues to happen, & presents it’s self in different ways. It can be a distinct feeling, or I smell it. When I say I can smell it, it’s a smell that nobody else that’s been around me seems to be able to smell. It’s not a “bad” smell & wouldn’t have been what I would associate with death logically, but the first time it happened I instinctively knew what it meant."

As a mum on her 3rd pregnancy I will recommend now that you not let anyone stay with you in that size space, both sets of parents should get hotels. Your going to want to be as comfortable as possible after having a baby & figuring out the ropes.

Scroll down to what says “What is happening with your baby when your 8 weeks pregnant”, the limbs are present. So it only makes sense they’d be there at 10.
https://americanpregnancy.org/week-by-week/8-weeks-pregnant/
I have found there is sometimes misinformation on both sides of the pro-life/pro-choice debate. Not all do it, & some are just misinformed of the proper human developmental stages of zygote, embryonic, fetal, & what those stages accurately look like. I’ve heard pro life exaggerate, & I’ve heard some pro choice down play certain developmental stages."
insanepeoplefacebook,fe8ngyc,t1_fe814xf,1578928275.0,"I’m curious to see what pictures your looking at as I would say at 10 weeks it doesn’t look like a limbless lizard, (say this from being on my third pregnancy & having had many ultrasounds, & by a quick google search). On an ultrasound at this stage you can see limbs, head, (although the head is half the size of its body, so still looks a bit alien) & the “tail” should be where it’s supposed to be as the spinal chord. Don’t get me wrong, I’m pro choice, but at this stage a properly developing embryo/fetus (I put fetus as medical personnel typically start calling it a fetus at 10-11 weeks) will no longer resemble a limbless lizard.
Now when my eldest saw a picture of a 6 week embryo they said, “ewwww it looks like a giant sperm”! I had never thought about that before but they’re kinda right."

Some people will be mean, some are just ignorant to psoriasis, some are just unhappy with themselves, easier to point at you to distract others from looking at them too closely. I’ve had people who don’t know anything about psoriasis or don’t know that’s what I have, jerk away when let’s say I’ve held out my hand for change from a cashier & I am having a flare up. 
Everyone has some kind of issue, when you have psoriasis you can physically see it, while most people’s issues aren’t so easily noticed at first. Kids can be quite mean, but please try to remember it truly isn’t you, it’s them & most of them will grow out of it. 
I’m not a fan of applying lotions or ointments either. I regret not being better about it in the beginning, but now I apply lotions multiple times a day & it has helped a lot with the itchy ness & has minimized flare ups. I recommend doing something that can distract you, it makes it go by quicker. Keep your chin up, you are so young & I am sure with a loving family you will have a wonderful future."

It sounds like to me as almost all negative emotions are that yours are coming from fear. Anger because you fear he may have used you, (which from all that he’s offering doesn’t sound like it), fear that if he moves out he’ll find someone else, etc. In this situation for a moment try removing all emotion & use logic. You sound angry, bitter, resentful, controlling, & prideful. I don’t say this as an insult as I use to struggle with all those emotions making it easier for me to recognize. These things will destroy your relationship, I was fortunate enough to recognize those emotions in myself before they ended my marriage.

Some souls will “jump back in” rather quickly, while others could take centuries.
This was so hard to watch, & I cried thru out almost all of it. This couple are so strong, & I am so happy they pushed on. I think it would be interesting if any of the triplets were to ever do a past life regression when they’re old enough & to hear what they learn. Could be reincarnation or not."

I developed mine at 30, (6 yrs ago) first on the palm of my hand, it started as just a dry patch of skin then progressed from there. Now it covers my hands & feet when I have a flare up. Mine appears & sounds much like yours. I did light therapy & that helped me quite a bit until I got strep throat & it flared badly. Typically getting any kind of illness triggers mine but I’ve noticed that strep gives me the worst reaction. It makes sense, your immune system is responding to the illness & since psoriasis is an autoimmune condition a flare up can be a natural consequence. I’ve noticed alcohol also causes flare ups for me which is also a common trigger.

My story wouldn’t be about a “gut feeling” that saves a life but it really was unexplainable to me then. I was 17 (almost 20yrs ago) in line at a fast food place with my best friend. She was talking to the cashier at the drive thru & I was in my own world, gazing out the window kind of in a dazed trance state some may say. I had a feeling that hit me strongly, yet it was calming. I then looked at my friend & without emotion I said to her “I have a feeling of death, & it’s coming. It isn’t coming for me but I don’t know who it’s for. The next day my twin brother was found in his room unresponsive, we took him off life support 5 days later. Other “odd” things happened while he was in the hospital before life support was withdrawn. I wasn’t near him when I got this “feeling”, he seemed perfectly healthy & his passing was completely unexpected. I would be interested if there’s a current scientific explanation for something like this happening. I’ve had similar incidents ever since pertaining to death. Sometimes it has come the same way & others it’s a smell that for some reason only I smell. If anyone is curious because I’ve been asked before, it isn’t a horrible smell, & is hard to describe but the best way I can at the moment is bitter sweet.

She was vomiting from what she thought was stomach pains. She was also still bleeding, but irregularly so she thought she was still getting her period. They later believed it was from the placenta. She made an appointment with her OB since her primary care physician wasn’t much help, it was the OB who decided to do an ultrasound & bam there was a baby. It was weird because before she knew she would just look bloated some days, but then the next day no bloat. I’d say at about 36 weeks she started to show.

Why is giving people respect a difficult concept? If your truly concerned about someone’s health which way are most people more likely to listen to your concerns? Would it be a good thing then to call people out so rudely out of “concern” on everything that may be unhealthy for them? Where do you draw the line? When do you stop making snap judgements on others on what little you know just by looking at someone’s outside, without all the information that could be going on inside their head? I believe in treating people with love, compassion, kindness, & respect. Just because one person says something isn’t rude doesn’t mean it actually isn’t, just differences in perspectives. I’d personally rather discuss my concerns in a healthy manner because fat shamming isn’t. I’d rather treat others as I’d like to be treated. I’ve been skinny, I’ve been athletic, I’ve been bulimic, & I’ve been over weight. I gained the weight due to psychological issues from having my twin brother die suddenly at 17. I can tell you now when I was in my darkest days those many years ago had someone made a comment about my weight that I probably wouldn’t be here right now because I was in a fragile state, or “sensitive”. Guess what? I knew I had gained weight, & when I was in a better place I lost the weight. It’s so easy to sit on our high horses & say what we’d do if we ever found ourselves in a situation or having been there & forgetting what it was truly like not to mention each person being an individual & their lives having different variables."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fc0eojz,t1_fc0dst5,1577288824.0,"Exactly this. Some people need to understand that depending on how you approach someone with weight issues could actually do more harm then good. For some being blunt with them could actually cause them to gain more weight because eating can be an emotional issue, with a vicious cycle. You also have family members like my grandmother who are naturally very slim, (she was in normal clothes two weeks after giving birth to twins) so even someone of average or healthy weight seem “fat” to them. My grandmother asked me at 15 if I wanted a membership to Jenny Craig for Christmas. Fifteen year old me didn’t realize that she was full of it & I was by no means fat. I had been playing soccer for 10yrs at this point & had a very athletic build with huge boobs, it was just a different build then my flat, skinny grandmother. I wish I would have seen that at the time because that wasn’t the only comment she made I believed her unfortunately & developed bulimia with severe obsessive exercising. Years later & I’ve paid thousands getting my teeth fixed from the bulimia & my mind in the right place again.
I understand that people may truly think they’re helping, but you don’t have to be nasty or rude to help & honestly it made things worse for me, & made me barely want to be near my grandmother. Despite what some may think there is almost always deeper issues then just being a “pig” about food because your a glutton."
Parenting,fc0dk6b,t1_fc0amtc,1577287830.0,"That is an awesome tradition!
Op as a mom of two with a husband I typically still stuff my own stocking. I do it because I didn’t want our first to ask why mommy & daddy didn’t get anything in their stockings. My husband did try to surprise me with a stocking stuffer this year of a bunch of the chapsticks I love that are hard to find, but I ruined that surprise by intercepting the package & not checking that it was addressed to my husband. If I were ever a single mum I’d still stuff my own stocking although it admittedly isn’t as special.
My little sister is a single mum to 3, ages 11mos, 5, & 6. She stuffs her own stocking, but after reading your post I think I’ll play Santa next year & slip things in her stocking."
Mommit,fc0d20q,t1_fc036gn,1577287379.0,"I wouldn’t say that, but within my family it is very common that the mothers do most of the heavy lifting as far as putting everything together, which I personally don’t mind as my husband is helpful in other ways & I want to make Christmas special for him as well. He stayed up while I was cooking most of the night until 3:00am putting our daughter’s present together. But yes, I did all the shopping for presents, all the shopping for the Christmas meals, all the wrapping, cooked a Christmas Eve dinner, & stayed up accept for two hours of sleep to work on our Christmas dinner meal, (it’s a lot of cooking from scratch). Yes he picked out my present, & put it in a brown box, that he nicely asked me to wrap, (I enjoy wrapping presents much more then him though). I do tend to forget myself during the holidays, but I truly don’t mind as my goal is to make my family happy. Christmas for me can be a lot of work, but it’s work that’s result is so worth it."
Psoriasis,fbzym0o,t1_fbzrriv,1577268834.0,"I went thru that with strangers if I’d stick out my hand for something like change from a cashier. My son was also only 4 when I had my first flare up, & wouldn’t hold my hand (he was little so it was harder for him to grasp). I also had my brother-in-law “joke” if I was sure I didn’t have leprosy."
relationships,fbzited,t1_fbzhz04,1577248128.0,"Right? It sounds like the poster is insinuating that people of that age don’t have true health problems (someone should have told a friend that who had gone thru cancer twice by the time they were 21), or to run because she does, (which could make you miss out on something amazing)."
Psoriasis,fbtmxnq,t3_e9j9vu,1577085414.0,"I got pustular psoriasis at 30, & 5 yrs later I have barely been without it since. For me it started as an itchy dry looking spot on my left hand that wouldn’t go away, then the pustules started on both hands, eventually going under some nails. Several months later it started on my feet as well. The pustules are on the bottom, & sides of my feet but are now slowly creeping up to the top. My primary care physician misdiagnosed me with eczema, the prescribed treatment wasn’t helping much so I got on a waiting list for a highly recommended dermatologist who pretty quickly said it was pustular psoriasis & my flare ups were severe. He has been great & I like the light therapy but got tired of paying the cost every week for so long. I was basically clear of it at one point for a few months but then I had strep throat & it caused a flare up. I’m putting internal meds off as a last resort. I occasionally do prescribed steroid ointments if it’s a severe flare up."
