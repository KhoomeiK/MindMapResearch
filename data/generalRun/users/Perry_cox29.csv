Crackdown started the trend but did actual gameplay poorly so no one cared. Cloud computing allows for 100% realistic environments on a scale that hasn’t been done before.

Alpha has been consistently phenomenal despite the team performance. Chaussette has a higher peak but his individual performances are streaky and it contributes to his team being streaky.

Crackdown started the trend but did actual gameplay poorly so no one cared. Cloud computing allows for 100% realistic environments on a scale that hasnâ€™t been done before.
