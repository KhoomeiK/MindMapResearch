> 
> The term is both dehumanizing and inaccurate.

No one ever claimed the illegal immigrants' existence is illegal, what is illegal is their entry, or continued residence in the country. It is no different from saying it is illegal to drink and drive. Of course, the left plays word games to defray the fact that people broke laws, and why not, the community with the highest illegal immigration rates are being courted actively as a voting block  (you do not have to respond back by saying illegals cant vote. I do, and I know you do too as to how vote block works). If the left really cared about illegal immigration, they would have worked out a deal during the first two years of Obama presidency because, both the senate and house was in Dem control. Instead what they did was to get Sonya Sotomayor on SCOTUS to appease them during the mid term elections, and then dangle DACA for the next presidential elections (the implementation of which was predicated upon Obama's return -- no the law wasn't written with explicit predication). Obama attempted the same (to get Hillary elected), by making DAPA predicated upon electing a democrat.

So, democrats will only throw a lifeline to the extent that they will continue to get elected. They have no real intent to fix the immigration issue.

> As you mention unathorized immigrants

How about we start using terms like ""Unauthorized lover"", or ""Unauthorized assist of grim reaper"". 

> demonization of unathorized immigrants is part of a broader war on immigration by the radically xenophobic Trump administration.

Ok there calling Trump xenophobic is really dehumanizing and incorrect, maybe we should highlight that he is a strong defender of native population. Seriously though, republican party has always sought to minimize immigration. Wanting to control immigration does not make you xenophobic. Further more multiple people in Trump's admin have recent immigrant ancestry or are married to immigrants (including Trump himself).  


>  Applicants are called in to be interviewed about things they were never called in for before. 

There was always a provision for interview before approving immigrant petition, but it was seldom used for employment based petitions (being an immigrant myself, I have followed immigration forums, and have seen people being called for interviews back in 2006-2012 time frame and even earlier). Trump admin, with the stated goal to detect fraud has deemed that interviews are generally necessary for employment based petitions. Again, I recognize  the amount of fraud, and bending of rules that is prevalent. 


> and attorneys who help people through this process will tell you that they're getting a ton of what they call RFE's, Requests for Evidence, for perfectly ordinary things that, in the past, would have been routine.

I personally know of cases where these RFEs have caused people to abandon their petitions. You know why? Because USCIS started asking questions like, ""do you really think this person is special enough for the job of being a Java developer that can't be found in this country"", or that a person has some really insane breadth experience in exactly the technologies that the companies want to hire for.

These steps, in my opinion as an immigrant, is really necessary to help honest immigrants to get a better shot at their immigration journey than a bunch of  ""consultants"" who game the system. I really applaud Trump admin for this.


> There was the RFE asking a British citizen to have her British birth certificate translated into English, please.

Dont attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence, or honest mistake. It is really disingenuous to highlight this as Trump admin issue, when the commentator themselves seem to suggest that it was a single instance. Mistakes happen, I have had to submit the documents again because ""it was missing from my original application"". Unlikely that I missed (because we scanned the application and then sent it off), but sure.

That sucks, but you know what it has resulted in? Bodyshops are no longer responding to RFEs and sending their folks back out because many fear that the RFEs will end up uncovering the fraudulent applications, whereas none of the legit companies worry about responding to RFEs."

That is bull shit, no says ""I suffered so you should too"" -- people made sacrifices and budgeted to pay off their loans, you can't just wipe off loans of people who were incapable to do the right thing without introducing moral hazard. If their education loans are ballooning, these people chose to pursue education in a field they are not qualified, or are inept at. Given the current economy, it is really hard to imagine anyone with a good degree to be not be gainfully employed, and be able to service their loans.

Are student loans given with xeroxed money? If you wipe out the debt, people who invested in the debt bonds are going to lose a bunch of money -- who then will not be able to spend money. You know it is not just the billionaires who own these bonds... many annuities and retirement funds own them .. so wiping off these debts (unless Government makes the investors whole including paying off the bond rates till maturity) will kill some other portion of the economy. Even if the government makes the investors whole, the money printed by the government will add to extra inflation, so other than the inept students (who likely will continue to make bad decisions), no one gains -- oh, and the politicians who make up these vote-for-me schemes.

> Getting rid of this debt will help all of society, including those who didn't have to worry about it before, if suddenly all their peers have more money.

Not really, when minimum wages increases, others do not get proportionate wage hikes -- and most people will see their spending potential go down. To fund for these schemes the government is going to tax people more, so overall people will have less money to spend.""Let us tax the wealthy"" will not cover the program -- if you are drinking from Warren's and Sanders' koolaid."
