space,fe8zv7d,t3_envr7m,1578932732.0,Last winter I stayed with a few friends in N Lake Tahoe. While I was in town I also visited some other friends in S Lake Tahoe for dinner. This had me driving back to the north side of the lake in the middle of the night. I stopped near Emerald Bay and got out to look at the stars. The Milky Way was stunningly beautiful. I miss Tahoe.
