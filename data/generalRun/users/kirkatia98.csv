I recognized the abuser's actions as the same sort of stunts my dad is pulling right now, using my mom as a proxy. It took me two years to go through with cutting them off all the way, but it wasn't like I left someone I had a romantic relationship that started out like a fairytale. I think GF needs to trust OP and realize that blocking EX will be best for her mental health.

Edit: I have soft blocked my mom, in cases she says something like my sister being hospitalized."

You will be okay.   


If possible, find someone who can show you how being loved feels. That will help. Be cautious though about who you chose, be vigilant for red flags.

Find a hobby that you can channel your emotions into, especially if it’s creative, like drawing, music, roleplaying games, etc.

Every year, celebrate your freedom anniversary. Reflect on how your circumstances have changed and how you have changed. You will notice your mind expanding.

This IS trauma, and it HAS impacted you, but you have to remember to not let you hold you back, or not let it be an excuse that prevents you from trying."
