Not to mention Japan also has companies like konami, who'll milk every cents from gamer's nostalgia to feed their pachinko business. This nintendo guy is a legend, not because he's Japanese, but he's a true gamer at  heart."

MonsterHunterWorld,fc8zktq,t1_fc86wxz,1577544628.0,"Some of my best hunts were with LS players, when they are good, they are really GOOD. I just wish the game would automatically exchange guild cards when multi, really want to find the LS who saved my hunt with tempers lunatic."
MonsterHunterWorld,fc8xt13,t1_fc7mtik,1577543804.0,"Did you build up the spirit meter before using your combo? I haven't touched LS since main HBG but I did kill nergi with it, from what I remembered, always get your spirit metre to red then go for the killer combo. Also try thunder or dragon long sword with ratholos, since those elements are his weakness. Don't give up on LS yet, it's an awesome weapon on so many levels, especially if you know how to counter! You'll be slashing your way through like a samueai! However I do understand the attraction of GS, especially against that kulve golden boi...."
