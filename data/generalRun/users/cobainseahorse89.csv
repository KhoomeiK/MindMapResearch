OldSchoolCool,fey4ojj,t1_fey2nqo,1579440798.0,This is only true is your brain hasn't fully developed when you start smoking and continue smoking into adulthood. The juvenile brain is much more at risk.

OldSchoolCool,fexzsec,t1_fexr0mr,1579438911.0,"This is true, prescription drugs can damage internal organs just like alcohol can. Smoking weed is better, but that still damages your throat and lungs (not to say I don't do any of these things). Shrooms and THC tincture (minimal alchohol here) are the way to go for treating anxiety and depression the safest. Unfortunately, shrooms are still illegal almost everywhere."

AskReddit,feuw1bx,t3_eqies2,1579390470.0,"My dad used to wake me up and tell me goodbye every morning before he went to work. One morning he came to tell me goodbye and I could see that he was standing over my bed, but it was too dark to make out his features, plus I was half asleep. I then saw him standing by my window a/c. Later when he got home from work I asked if he had adjusted my a/c temperature when he came to tell me goodbye, and he said ""I actually didn't go up to tell you goodbye this morning."""
