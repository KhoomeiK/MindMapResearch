AnimalsBeingJerks,ff2vz3b,t1_ff170xk,1579526249.0,"Animal care is ever evolving. Bunnies should not be caged. Care information from corporations on almost all small animals (hamsters, mice, gerbils, Guinea pigs, rabbits etc.) are severely outdated with 90's info which is abusive.

Fun fact. In petsmart/Petco there is 0 cages that are appropriate for hamsters even though they have a whole isle of different cages. They are all much too small.

Anyone reading this. Please do your research before picking up a fuzzy little friend, even if you've had one in the past. Things have changed tremendously in the care we provide them now."

Her rule of thumb was if she couldnt make it into work during a snow storm to support us coming in too, then we didnt need to come in. In most cases she'd make it to work but it was nice to have the support."
