As for the timeline, assuming LAOP is telling the truth, maybe it was altered for privacy reasons (you still want to remain anonymous on the internet because publishing about this kinda situation might mess up a potential legal case) OR the shelter actually did things that wrong.

I mean, if people didn’t do things the wrong way, we wouldn’t need such complex and large amounts of legislation. First, the obvious one, people steal and we need laws against that (the roommate). Then, shelters have their own protocols and, in some cases legislation, surrounding what they can and can’t do... this is because people mess up (maliciously or not), so they need ways to prevent that from happening and to remedy it once it has already happened. 

A protocol dictating how a shelter handles potential adoptions probably was put in place, one, to keep to a certain tidy manner of organizing everything pet-related and, two, because of shady adoptions. Assuming the latter happened (a family is allegedly already there for the expensive golden boy), LAOP can seek remedies and compensations because protocols and laws were broken; otherwise they could risk being told to pound sand because nothing illegal happened.

However, always bear in mind you should combine more than one birth control method in order to reduce the risk as much as possible.
