Do you have any advice on how to encourage someone to use one ? Sorry if this is an odd question"

iamatotalpieceofshit,fge32ax,t1_fgd2ayu,1580690232.0,"Yeah I doubt she'll be mad. Maybe offer to go get the tests yourself. 
Also, as the people said below, it is a good idea sometimes to get a dna test. However be VERY VERY CAREFUL how you approach in asking this, you could easily really offend your spouse, making her think you think she's not faithful. I also think you have to wait till the baby is born anyways, but still. If you trust her wholeheartedly, I wouldn't bother getting one. My dad never did and I'm very obviously his child now, haha."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fgd0fia,t1_fgcx44c,1580677898.0,Yeah having someone take a second test is normal. If they're reluctant then there's something fishy.
unpopularopinion,fg80dfo,t1_fg7brzm,1580606159.0,"Yeah maybe if there were less people with ""accidental"" kids on some sorta government assistance that money could go towards helping those with disabled children who still have a quality of life. I by no means hate disabled people or support eugenics but if a kid is so disabled they can't take care of themselves in any way and have no idea what's going on, what's the point? Its a complicated debate honestly because unlike abortion these disabled children are alive."

unpopularopinion,fg76612,t1_fg6rzsy,1580584924.0,"Like if you want to keep your child alive with a severe disability, fine. But don't get upset when its horribly stressful and nobody will help you or help pay for your child's needs.
Also the poor quality of life, i agree with you."
insaneparents,fg75yga,t3_ex9ah5,1580584784.0,"Shouldn't be hittin your kid, period. Just cause its normalized in certain communities / your parents hit you, doesn't give you the right to lay your hands on a child. If they're too young to reason with/understand why they shouldn't do something, they're too young to understand why you're hitting them."

wholesomememes,ffltkyj,t1_fflsomr,1580043965.0,I wonder if maybe it was her excuse cause she didn't want to cope with the loss of a dog when it passes away. Hope i worded that right. Losing a beloved pet is a scar that never really heals.

AnimalsBeingBros,fe92hy6,t1_fe91e03,1578933448.0,"Well, she bites people when she has something she's not supposed to have and you get near/try to take it. She also bites if you mess with something on her she doesn't want you to touch (she has ear infection issues and we can't even touch her ears without getting bit.) She's also very aggressive when people get near each other, or if doors are shut. I'm sure there's something obvious I'm missing here but idk what to do. Shes a 6 yr old maltese. Otherwise she's pretty sweet and just energetic. She's kind of nuts but a friend has her brother from the same litter and he's the same. Any advice is appreciated."
