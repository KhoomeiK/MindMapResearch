MusicEd,ffit61g,t3_etsvy5,1579982086.0,"Say “du” for rhythm instead of “tu”- orff approach, similar to Gordon’s.  Say all rhythm, we also go nuts on mouthpieces early on to get it out of their system. 

We got renaissance models over Yamaha- better sound imho.  Also two piece sturdy plastic. 

Also, the overblowing makes the wrong note thing to the nth degree.  Low E, as mentioned is great for this.  It also gets both hands on properly from the get go. 

Recorder suuucks.  I don’t miss it at all.  

Best advice is recorder jail- small box with jail bars, kids overblowing or being obnoxious simply put it in jail.  Recorder can return when you feel it’s ready to be a positive member of society.  Then you can have probation periods too, where they get another chance. 

Three strikes and they’re staying in jail the rest of class and the kid either plays without the mouthpiece, or does fingerings on the cleaning rod :). Best thing ever for easy classroom management."
Teachers,ffdtyob,t1_ffdnnwd,1579828862.0,"Yep.  Agreed. It was their first year with me at that school and I wrote them up for it afterwards.  Then demonstrated the appropriate time.  Rest of the class told them to take the “L”.  Now I use their video as evidence of what not to do in a concert, and most kids cringe when I show it. 

So glad that’s all dead, hoping tik tok dies soon, what happened to silly bandz being the most annoying trends? :)"
Teachers,ffdmudz,t1_ffdjta0,1579824244.0,"This was two years ago, they all T posed in the middle of a concert.. not ok.. so that was that.  So next class I did it and stared them down.. and it was the end of them trying that in my class anymore :)

I don’t mind playing dumb, in fact the whole “ligma” thing was quite hilarious to play dumb with :) because I KNEW what it was.. I’m slipping .. feeling my age."
Teachers,ffdi5c5,t1_ffd9q0b,1579821365.0,"That’s the thing- I honestly don’t know if they’re trolling me- the whole “is joe in this class?” Thing I was quick to shut down.. and the Fortnight craze I was on top of..  months ago the “sk sk sk” was easy enough.  I even brought a hydro flask with stickers and scrunchies in.. which instantly made them stop :) 

So right now,  course of action is to straight up ask- today was 8th grade girls, and they’re always catching me up on stuff, they still view me as the fun teacher at least.. they always ask me to make tik Tok videos with them after school.. of course I always pass :) 

But now it’s frustrating that I really don’t know and have to ask all the time.. being a related arts teacher dance is part of class, and renegade happens.. but there’s so many of them!!"
MusicEd,ff81tqg,t3_es5ws8,1579663770.0,"YUP!! 

I was in a similar All State situation- person running it was on break and I was managing.. so she causually looks at me and says “run the rehearsal from x-z and I’ll be back in 20 min”.

The music was brandy new to me- running all of the management, people, money, registration- hadn’t had a chance to look at the music yet. 

I had an awesome pianist and 200 kids- AND all of their teachers watching me.. I sight read that fucker and rehearsed the hell out of those kids.  Fixed diction, sound placement, and vowels.. 

Made sure to have the kids “listen closely to the melody line” to be played by the pianist..

Felt like a hero afterwards and didn’t give two shits what any of the other teachers said.  My kids were so awesome and bragging about me.. 

That was 3 years ago.. now I’m not involved anymore and it’s a little sad :("
AskReddit,ff7v896,t3_es1gaf,1579659154.0,"“No children should be moving furniture”...

Was moving a piano and some 10 year olds offered to help- upright on wheels- said “sure!”

Cue them rolling it over one of their own feet.. when it got stuck on his shoe, the other two kids pushed harder.  I literally watched in slow motion as this poor kid got his foot run over by a piano.. 

Yep.  Got a stern talking to by boss lady and a school wide email sent out to all staff..."
Teachers,ff6unzc,t3_erycrs,1579635239.0,"Haha!   Absolutely- I always call my first class the guinea pig class, luckily ours is on a rotating schedule, so that first class changes.

That is kind of adorable.."
redsox,ff0mk3o,t3_eqxrqf,1579470256.0,Ack I love him.  Made me a fan for life.  Only player I followed from Paw Sox up to the majors.. I still have my mini shrine to him somewhere in storage.  I was insanely jealous of Mia Hamm..
brooklynninenine,fefjwlz,t1_fed2pz2,1579057885.0,Uh me too? For realz.. real life cake day.  Go Capricorn’s and what the hell happened 9 months ago?
