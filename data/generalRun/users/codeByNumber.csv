I always thought it was shoe-in as in “getting your foot in the door” type of thing. Lol."
recruitinghell,fg07uus,t1_fg07689,1580402103.0,Yup...worst company I ever worked for.
recruitinghell,fg03b26,t1_ffzz42m,1580399279.0,"Jesus...if they pay their recruiters 60/hr how much do they pay their software devs? I got hit up on linked-in for a front end engineer position and it was paying just barely more than this. It was also a salaried position and Facebook is notorious for long hours. So you are making more than a lot of their devs. 

I guess that makes sense for recruiters of FAANG companies to be compensated so well given the competitive nature of acquiring talent for those companies."
recruitinghell,fg02tp0,t1_ffzqprw,1580398972.0,It’s like $2 for closing a real estate loan over 500k. The incentives at Wells Fargo are garbage. That’s why everyone has to game the system. From CEO down to teller.
recruitinghell,fg02mvg,t1_ffzzamd,1580398853.0,Isn’t there another bank or credit union in the area she can go work for? Leaving Wells Fargo to work at a credit union was a fantastic life choice of mine when I was younger. She would be a shoe in hire for any of those other banks.
photocritique,ffxz1g7,t1_ffxytz1,1580335232.0,Haha truth. For landscape shots like this the f4 is just as sharp as the GM and at some apertures even sharper. If you don’t need the low light ability then save your money.
photocritique,ffxx000,t1_ffwgucy,1580334077.0,Great shot! Were you using the 16-35 2.8 GM or the 16-35 f4 ZA?

ExposurePorn,ffwuftg,t1_ffwbre9,1580311252.0,I remember what you are talking about. He used some kind of auto rotator that he built. I have it saved somewhere because I was certain I was going to build one myself lol. I can’t find it because I have too many things saved for all the other things that I’ll never do too.
todayilearned,ffwswqu,t1_ffw6tbk,1580310230.0,Great tip! Thanks!

Soon it will be compulsory. In order to be insured you must wear this device. 

Then they will just be implanted to us at birth."
todayilearned,ffvxjfn,t1_ffvxdl7,1580276348.0,No problem! For the record you can format links like ‘[text]’’(url)’ minus the tics. Or really you can just paste the link directly. In your case you were just missing the http:// part of the url.

pics,ffswmbg,t1_ffsh7hc,1580195457.0,You guys say that but then those titles get ignored. It’s kind of self perpetuating.
nfl,ffswdda,t1_ffs7da5,1580195153.0,This man speaks the truth. They are the most snake bitten team ever. San Diego sports franchises are cursed.
nfl,ffsw5bt,t1_ffs0kmp,1580194884.0,"The Chargers marketing team would call me every year and try and sell me season tickets or ticket packs. You know what they would say each and EVERY time?

“Come in man, if you sell your Raiders and Broncos game tickets, and also the Patriots tickets and it pays for the whole season! Free tickets! It’s a great deal.”

It was an organizational problem. They actively marketed for and perpetuated this issue."
nfl,ffsn36b,t1_ffr8xth,1580185943.0,"Right, but the organization is garbage."
AdviceAnimals,ffrb4tp,t3_eunbpl,1580154380.0,"No fedora and katana however my MySpace profile was me with my knee up on my bed playing my acoustic guitar...with my electric guitar (not plugged in) strapped to my back. You know...just in case?

And the pancake is def a good idea. I just got tired of pulling my camera in and out. To be honest though I think I might take it a step further and consider something like an RX100 for our family Disney trips."
