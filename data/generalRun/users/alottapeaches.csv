AskReddit,f7u0epx,t3_dxf5xh,1574009369.0,"We were staying in a cabin that my in laws had been using for 40+ years on the Blanco River. There were weather reports of possible flooding, but my in laws kept telling me the water has never even made it to the porch during previous floods. They didn't know this was going to be a historical flood that went well above the 500 year flood plain. I was pregnant and my almost 4 year old daughter was asleep upstairs while the 3 other adults in the cabin were getting lit. 
As the water kept rising from the river which is about 260 yards UPHILL from the cabin, I kept saying we need to leave, but was out voted. ""We'll be fine!"" they said.
The water made it to the porch, then the windows and as it poured into the cabin thru multiple windows and doors, we went upstairs due electrical outlets on the floors of the cabin. I watched our vehicles float away. I watched cars with their headlights still on float by the cabin, not knowing if people were in there. 
We watched the water rise outside the cabin about 2 thirds up the sliding glass door before it finally gave way and the rushing water and debris filled the first floor. The lights went out and furniture was swirling around with my daughter's swim toys. We could smell electrical fires starting and my husband and his brother started to tie bedsheets together so we could somehow escape. Or try to make it to the roof thru the high windows on the second floor ceiling.  Eventually we saw red and blue lights  thru the trees. And started screaming for help thru the windows. A rescue team came out with an inflatable boat to get the 90 year old owner of the cabins who resided next door. They came to us first and I carried my daughter out the 2nd story window into the rubber boat, rain, and rushing floodwaters where they took us to higher ground. I thought it was my last night on earth. Other families lost much more than their vehicles...they lost their homes, pets, and some loved ones. I had a miscarriage shortly after which I believe was caused by the stress from that night."
