books,ffkoa3y,t1_ffk52bv,1580026050.0,"I feel like half this thread is people acting like books are somehow superior to movies. They're both beautiful works of art, just a different medium. 

Movies also do exist beyond their blockbusters. If the only books I read came from James Patterson, I could walk around saying all modern literature is hot garbage, but I know that there are better books out there. Same deal in cinema."
notliketheothergirls,ffkjcb0,t3_eu19wo,1580023717.0,I love be bisexual too. What a coincidence.

ENFP,ffi4uop,t3_eti84b,1579965122.0,"I met a guy once, he was dating my friend, and I said to my sister, ""He is going to abuse her."" And he did. Badly...My brother's wife was essentially just using him for his money, she was never in love with him, I told people this right away, nobody believed me but guuuueesss what?

I can read people incredibly well, I can read their intentions almost to a T upon a single meeting, I don't need a lot to go on. With friends, I can read their true intentions even more easily, and they have even admitted that to me when I have called them out. I don't regret this trait, it helps me keep my guard up where necessary, it keeps me safe. However, I deeply regret that people so often refuse to believe me until the damage has already been done. 

My sister is an INFJ and she is exactly the same. She can read people so well that it's scary. And our instincts always line up which is cool."

Anxiety,fffocrz,t3_etar9a,1579888275.0,"Yay! Taking a shower is always therapeutic for me, or just taking a bath. Even if I don't want to do it, I make myself do it because I know I will feel better if I do :) Good luck!"
namenerds,ffez2sd,t3_et13y2,1579870975.0,I'd like to thank my mother for choosing the most popular names she could imagine at the time. May I never do the same.
teenagers,ffeckoi,t3_et0g04,1579843148.0,"I'm sorry you got yelled at for your grade! When I was in high school, I had a similar experience. My parents were very upset with me when I got a bad grade, I kind of gave up altogether, and I finished high school with a GPA well below 2.5...

Stay motivated for yourself, don't worry about pleasing them, go out and succeed. My parents are far more understanding now that I'm a college student, our communication got better, and I hope that the same can happen for you."
