For the record, I like America and I wouldn't be here if I didn't like it. As for bringing up the aspect of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, I was making a relevant comment about Nigeria's history and the affect that UK colonization had on its economy. I'm sure there are Muslims and other people of all races who have slavery in current society. I am referring to the historical slave trade in the appropriate context. I acknowledge there are currently people of all races in slavery, and while reprehensible, it does not have the same impact on the economic relationship between African countries and the United States.

Many laws go contrary to human respect. What did white settlers do to America if not disrupt the status quo? What makes you think that these borders are yours to claim? You say that there are hard working descendants of the colonizers who raped and pillaged the land, and I agree. There are a lot of good, hard working people in the community. There are also people already in American borders who are criminals that have done much worse than any immigrant. There are good and bad people of all origins. But most people are just the same human beings, trying to make a living for their families.

90dayfianceuncensored,fgbkpj0,t1_fg7jfux,1580663111.0,"I don't care for putting humans on a scale of ""advancement"" value based on their employability and economic contributions. By that metric, we should chuck out every one in the entire state of Mississippi, and many disabled/ill people would have negative value. Not that it is true, but assume the worst possible statistics for those metrics. I would still say it is any human being's right to live in any country that they choose. Maybe it's because I'm an immigrant myself, but it's hard to get the us vs. them mentality. They're the same as us and by some stroke of misfortune we were born in a poor country, we would do the exact same thing. Although I am  wholly unable to relate to Trump, I can see the reason immigrants are pitted against poor white people. They are claiming that immigrants are taking resources away from poor whites and they use ""moochers"" that are unemployed and send money to their families as proof. The reality is that the resource distribution is caused by wealth inequality, the polarization of who holds money and power in America is quite extreme.  So they effectively have poor white people fighting immigrants for crumbs while the super wealthy make off with the entire cake. So in short, I think financial contributions that immigrants offer or take away should be a moot point. 

And I want to add that it's obvious why any immigrant wants to come here. They want to improve their quality of life for their families. Note that Nigeria was colonized by the UK and didn't gain independence until 1960s. Nigeria was greatly impacted by the trans-atlantic slave trade. The prosperity of many Americans is related in some parts to the entwined history of Europe and Africa. The wealth that many in America and Europe hold now was taken by force, not by grit or talent."

If my basic needs were met I would do research for free. I wouldn't work 40 hrs a week but I would definitely do enough to create an impact.

My boss's boss found out I was giving the food away to our workers and told me I had to charge them for the expired food, at a discount. Even at a discount I hated this idea. I still give it out for free because the big boss is rarely there to enforce his rules."

They can also demand that you work however many hours they want and fire you if you don't work those hours. They are not even required to give you any breaks. I work my whole shift every day with no lunch break, no holidays unless I take a pay hit, no sick days. People tell me ""that can't be legal! Even Walmart mandates breaks!"" That's because they are in more states than just this one, so they have a blanket company policy to protect their ass. Most people I talk to don't even know about the draconian labor laws here."
antiwork,ffep7qz,t3_esv842,1579858498.0,"I'm into fitness and too many fitness influencers are like ""it just takes hard work and discipline~"" and show them leisurely shopping at whole foods, making acai bowls and green smoothies with a $200 blender, and working out at an expensive gym every day in Lululemon gym gear, no day job, then destressing from their super stressful lives with a bath bomb and a 30 step skincare routine. It's like yeah great so relatable. I know it's possible to be healthy frugally, but living carefree, eating clean, and exercising at your leisure is not attainable for so many people."

antiwork,ffeohmk,t1_ffek5wm,1579857406.0,"My husband and I are interested in homesteading, but the upfront costs plus maintenance and safety net are pretty hard to get over. It's become more of a semi retirement goal at this point. I know a couple who did this, but have good benefits from the husband being a veteran. It can certainly be done more cheaply, but it wouldn't work for us to go drop work and homestead right now, and I imagine others have similar hurdles."

It's not a comment about whether fat people should feel shame about being fat. It's about their personal experience in a body they felt shame about. I do think societal pressure contributed, but we famously live in a society... And stuff like this comes with it. Shame isn't erased by people getting mad that it exists."

90DayFiance,ff8f0oq,t3_erswyy,1579675669.0,"My husband will enjoy a drink every now and then. It doesn't bother me. We are both super introverted but will venture out on occasion. He is much smoother than me in social situations with a variety of people and I tend to stick to my inner circle. But one thing is clear: our time together is a top priority. We enjoy much of the same activities, but he's gone to things without me and vice versa. We may not like the exact same things but we do a lot of parallel play (doing introverted activities by ourselves in the same room).  We are technically doing different things but together. And of course, we love to cuddle up on the couch and watch this dumpster fire.

I think a lot of these couples are missing that bonding time doing low key couple things together. Hanging out together. Going grocery shopping. Instead, they are wasting their limited time doing stupid shit like getting grilled by friends or random porno grandmas.

How many times have we seen these people doing something innocuous like apartment hunting, only to have it escalate into a ridiculous fight that highlights their egregious incompatibilities? A simple thing like respecting each other's diet/lifestyle is possible, if other things align. People with deal breakers about drinking should not get together with drinkers to begin with."

loseit,ff5fbwi,t3_erqpss,1579590407.0,Lifting heavy is the only thing that ever got me toned. I fell off the lifting wagon so I have to get back into it. I never developed very large muscles but I found that I didn't get any good results unless I progressively overloaded.
loseit,ff5f5z8,t3_erodba,1579590212.0,"You can get precooked chicken or other meat, add something like pita bread and hummus or avocado and tomato. Whatever ingredients you like, just throw them together. I often buy those steamable veggie bags. Sometimes I get frozen edamame and all you do is take them out of the freezer and boil for about 4 minutes and it is ready. 

My favorite thing to make that is very easy for me is steamed rice + spinach, tomato and fried egg. I have a rice cooker so this may not be a good suggestion for everyone. Spinach takes like two seconds to cook and egg doesn't take much longer. A little bit of olive oil, some bomb ass seasonings, and you have yourself a filling meal. 

I don't really like meal prepping but I always have white rice in the fridge, and to me it goes with anything savory. 

Also check out r/slowcooking if you wanna get into that sort of thing."
loseit,ff5epil,t3_eronvq,1579589684.0,"The very first week, start slow. Change small things. They really add up.

For example: 

Week 1: drink more water. Get a water bottle and make sure you drink all of it throughout the day.

Week 2: replace a junk snack with fruit when you feel the need to snack.

Week 3: limit alcohol to (insert number) of drinks per week

Week 4: stop putting creamer in coffee, or switch to something else 

Week 5: start tracking your daily steps with your phone or Fitbit. Try to get 100 more steps than this week's average next week.

Week 6: Try one physical activity that you think would be fun to sustain. You don't have to commit to anything, just try it.

Week 7: get familiar with ways to make vegetables taste good. Cook at home one more night than usual.

And so on. Before you know it, these habits stack up and small changes turn into something huge. These are just suggestions based off of an imaginary person. I don't know your lifestyle so I don't have any tailored to you, but you get the idea."

Narnia,fem69of,t3_epta27,1579241244.0,"Another Horse and His Boy fan. Disney is really sleeping on this potential adaptation gold, as long as they omit the Islamaphobia/orientalism. I love the book a lot and Aravis is my favorite. My favorite moment in the book is when she catches up with Lasaraleen. Even though Aravis can be a little ""I'm not like other girls"" at times, her friend - this sheltered, spoiled girl who could easily be a frenemy - is ultimately a true friend to her and helps her, even though she thinks Aravis is crazy for giving up a life like she has. It's these moments that I really like CS Lewis's specific portrayal of friendships and little moments between them. The bond the horses and the kids develop over their shared journey is great and I like the group dynamic."
