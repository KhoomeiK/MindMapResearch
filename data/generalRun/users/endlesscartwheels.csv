* Cross out any girl's name that's usually used for boys.
* Cross out any boy's name that's starting to tilt towards girls (so your son doesn't have to explain in his fifties that *Yes, he really is a man named Elliott*).
* Cross out names that are also regular nouns (or homophones for them). So no Cole (coal) or Knox (knocks).
* Cross out Andrew (because of the president, either Jackson or Johnson), Benjamin (I don't like the nickname Benji), Thomas (prevent future Uncle Toms), and any name that is or starts with Ash (makes my eyes feel gritty)."

I prefer Rock rather than Rocks, and I'd keep the joke combos contained to the middle spot. However, Rocks *did* appear in the [2010 Census](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/2010_surnames.html), as the 30,222nd most popular surname, with 775 people. Rock was the 1,859th most popular surname, at 19,313 people. 

The surname I was given is in the 1,000 to 2,000 band too, which is a nice perch. It's a pleasant name, everyone can spell and pronounce it, but it's not ubiquitous."

Also a risk of your horrible stepfather rushing up at the last minute and grabbing your arm, counting on you to not want to make a scene. Might want to have someone watching to prevent that.

If you're going to change your name anyway, start with turning Jade to Jane. Sigrid Jane is a very nice name and Hestia Jane is okay as well. Jane Tarryn would be a flip and a one letter change that would work wonders. Minerva is an ancient Roman name with a Harry Potter link (McGonagall). Pomona too, though she's a minor character and there's some prejudice against Hufflepuffs.

Nemesis is clearly ridiculous. Don't even mention it in passing to the judge/clerk/registrar, because it instantly makes you seem not mature enough to change your name. Also, you don't want to spend the next ten years as Pandora, because unpleasant young men will inevitably ask questions about your box."

You and your husband have been right not to get attached to the nieces and nephews. This way those kids can't be used to control you and shake you down for money (it will start with gifts for the kids, then proceed to money to keep the lights/heat on for the kids, until you find yourself permanently subsidizing the parents).
