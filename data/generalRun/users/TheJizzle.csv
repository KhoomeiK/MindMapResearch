AskReddit,ffgwhin,t3_etcyd6,1579916829.0,"One problem is that we were able to overcome old world archetypes and empower women, but we never did the same for men. The idea of the successful, chiseled and handsome bread winner is exactly the same as it has been for decades (except for the martinis.) If anything, it's been made worse by the bodybuilding culture getting bigger every year. Women moved from one extreme closer to the middle, but men started on the other extreme and have pretty much stayed there. The pressure to become something great can lead people to desperate places. Drugs and debt, most notably. The things that weigh you down, that make you feel like you're under water, those things bring suicide within reach. Men are indoctrinated to forever chase upwards: stronger, faster, more successful, wealthier, more sexual partners. It's woven into every facet of society. Every action flick, every home improvement show, every representation of white collar success, all flex. 


Here's what I think would help: make it okay for men to be something else and still be ""men"". What happens now is, any man who doesn't fit the mold is labeled as something other than a real man. They're either gay, or maybe just effeminate, or maybe they're 'not into sports' because real men love sports. Maybe they just take baths (like a woman!) 


We don't have ""woman manager"" or ""woman sales associate"", but how many times have you heard ""male nurse""?

If you're working to support yourself and/or your family, there's probably going to be some stress involved at some point. I'm a professional IT person for nearly 20 years. I love the work, and sure, sometimes it can be stressful. I've learned to deal with the stress. I'm a hobbyist woodworker too, and I really really enjoy it, but I would never want to do it for money. That sucks all the joy out of it. Then, instead of jackass users who don't fill out tickets, I'd have jackass customers who don't want to pay for something because they couldn't describe what they wanted accurately. Admittedly, I'm risk averse, so the stability of the job outweighs the stress. 


I hope you find peace and happiness. That's all any of us really want. I really hope you don't jump ship from the industry and find out later that the problem all along was your own inability to deal with the stress. Others have commented that maybe it's not the job, but *that* job that has you ruffled. I'd consider another IT shop before throwing in the towel on a decade and a half of experience. Just the opinion of some rando on the internet."
