OldSchoolCool,ffcepkc,t1_ffcemna,1579797862.0,No. It’s not. Venezuela is a failed socialist country. The fear is foreign influence. Not the form of government. It’s cute how hard you try.
OldSchoolCool,ffced7i,t1_ffcdi1e,1579797647.0,Your argument that the US is afraid of Venezuela is completely wrong. The only thing we are worried about in Venezuela is Russian/Chinese influence.

OldSchoolCool,ffcdxxg,t1_ffcdgws,1579797385.0,"I think it’s obvious the caption is not accurate. I specialize in real estate and consider myself an eviction expert. In Texas (a very pro-landlord state) the eviction process starts with a suit filed with a small claims court. It takes about 21 days to get a trial date. Once the trial (and appeal process) completes, the landlord usually gets a judgment ordering the tenant to vacate in 5 days. If the tenant doesn’t vacate, the court will grant a “writ of possession”. The writ is a court order that allows the constable/sheriff to forcefully remove the occupants from the property. 

If the caption is true and that state had eviction rules similar to Texas, it looks like they are at the writ of possession phase and the law is forcefully removing her from the property. At this point, she had her day in court and looks like she lost. 

I will say that tenants/occupants rarely show up at the trial and generally lose by default."

One of those rights is that homestead can only be foreclosed for a limited number of things, such as purchase money (mortgage), property taxes, and mechanic’s liens.

As friction built I started looking for ways out. They gave me that one day when he walked into my office and told me that he sold the company to a competitor. The first thing they did was move his work to their lawyers. He then said that since he would no longer be using me, he needed me to vacate the office because he wanted to expand. I smiled happily as I told him there was only one problem, the office was in my name, so if they wanted it, they had to buy me out. He was not ready for that but the office was really nice, had a great location, and, because the building owner was a client of mine, rent was about half market rate.

This spot is right in the transition zone between the two and it was deep, wide, slow, and crystal clear.
