Rule #1 of public transportation: if someone cares so little about others that they lie across multiple seats, they will without hesitation tell you to go fuck yourself in no uncertain terms. It wasn't because you're fat."

At 2 minutes and 50 seconds of singing time for Truth Hurts, that would be around 500 meters at a 7mph pace. Does Lizzo do her concerts at tracks and sprint the entire concert? I'm unsure why OP thinks that running 7mph on a treadmill in high heels has anything to do with any on-stage performance, let alone Lizzo who tends to start screaming instead of singing when she gets out of breath."

The patriarchy just wants you to get good grades so that you become a productive member of their capitalist machine built on oppression of those of us whose academic set point is naturally lower. Studies show that every time you engage in study culture, your IQ yo-yos and you end up lowering your IQ set point.
