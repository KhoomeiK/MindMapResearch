Yeah they are, but as someone from a swing state, every Trump voter except 2 people that I know have soured to him. His base is a vocal minority that quite frankly, when I talk to them, seem to really want to understand politics but don't take the effort to ever learn about it. 
Not including the demographic of Trump voters being primarily older males who have croaked and this generation being the bluest and most left in history, 4 years of which have now hit 18, my prediction is Trump loses by 6-8 million votes. His base will cry foul and stomp their feet before heading back to their houses and realizing that voting in a big business CEO to eliminate big business in politics was stupid."

The reason people don't like Warren, even though most Bernie supporters I know gave her at #2 and a few have Yang then Warren, is because she wasn't on the train for as long as Bernie. She was a republican 30 years ago and that irks a lot of voters. It's as simple as that."

The last part depends on your take of progressive in relation to time. A lot of ideas were progressive for the time that candidates ran on, but as an overall platform-wise I would say she's up there if not number one. I tried explaining that to people after Bernie the primaries but yeah.
