It just doesn’t exist where I live in rural Alberta where I’m already driving half an hour to get a better price than the 2 small grocery stores in my town. The $12 for 4 chicken breasts **is the special**. Right now that store has chicken thighs on sale. For $3.59 a pound. Pork chops $4.49/lb. the cheapest rice I can find on the app is 8kg of white rice for $13 on sale, but that’s the only type of rice that comes in a bag that big. (Which frankly i didn’t know because I don’t eat white rice... or much rice at all because it’s calorically dense and not at all filling for me). Brown rice is on sale for $4 for 1.8kg. That’s about a dollar a pound if my conversion is correct. So everything is at least a couple dollars more than your prices and that is shopping flyers to get the best deal and having a vehicle to be able to drive to the next town to get these prices. The nearest Walmart/Costco/Bulk Barn is an hour drive away (one way).

I make 40k before tax. My rent is $1200 a month and basically takes an entire paycheque away (phone, internet, student loan payments, and car/home insurance take the rest of that and a chunk of the other). I eat healthy but I specifically budget for it and don’t eat out ever or buy other things to be able to afford chicken and beef and other foods that I want. I meal prep and pretty much don’t waste food ever to stretch my grocery budget. I never said it was impossible nor did I say it causes fatness (my area is super fit because that’s the lifestyle here) just that the prices you so arrogantly boast about are not universal and for people who don’t have access to them it can take a lot more time and energy than you have to expend to eat healthy.

(Just a note if you make this recipe (and you should) her calorie count isn’t accurate, I got about 530 cals per serving when I put it in MFP. It’s definitely a meal and not a side). 

While I was standing in the kitchen waiting for my instant pot to release the steam I noticed how much chocolate and candy was in my pantry. I have:
- fancy espresso chocolate a friend gave me 

- sea salt fudge

- about half of two Lindt chocolate bars, one crunchy milk and one dark

- a pickle jar with various little chocolates in it (lindor truffles, Baru dark chocolate covered marshmallows (not the best), Ferrero Rocher, Riesen candies

- a big milk chocolate letter (my first initial) that my mom gave me 

- a huge toblerone

- 2 packs Justin’s peanut butter cups

- milk chocolate coated French marshmallows (really good!)

- a big bag of white chocolate peppermint m&ms

- those fruity gummies that are white on the bottom

- some weird “skinny girl” chocolates

- about half of a Reese’s advent calendar that I stopped eating mid December and forgot about until just now 

- and a Tupperware of Christmas cookies in my freezer and 3 different kinds of chocolate chips in my baking cupboard. 

And it’s totally fine! I’ve actually *forgotten* about half of this stuff. And others I’ve had some of as dessert or with my packed lunch at work but just a little bit each day. The other day I logged a piece of the Toblerone (230 cals) for dessert but decided I’d rather have a serving of chocolate covered marshmallows (110 cals) instead. And the day after that I had logged marshmallows for dessert but after dinner I didn’t actually want them so I didn’t eat them.  

Now some of you may be going like “this is all super normal what is she even posting this for?” But for me it’s a sign of how far I have come. There was a time where if there was chocolate in the house I would eat the entire thing in 2 minutes. I get a jumbo toblerone in my stocking every year from my mom (even though I’m an adult now haha) and it never even used to make it until New Years. To get here I definitely had to have a period where I totally cut out candy and chocolate (I switched to dark chocolate at the end of this to ease myself back in to chocolate with less sugar) but now I can have a pantry full of treats and treat them as treats and not as something I need to inhale right away (it also helps that there’s no one else who is going to eat these so I can save them without worrying I wound eventually get them)."

I moved to a very well known one over 2 years ago and only planned to be there for the winter on a short term contract but I’ve stayed because I love it. I’m not quite a ski bum though, I work a 9-5 Monday to Friday job in the field I got my masters in so I can only be a weekend warrior but even with a steady job I’m poor as fuck because it’s expensive so I really got this article. The money aspect is hard, the housing aspect sucks, the transient nature of the town is hard (I have friends who won’t even bother getting to know brits and aussies because they’ll leave in 6 months and I’ve had some hard goodbyes when people’s visas ended myself), being 3000 km away from my family and my lifelong and uni friends is hard but the mountains... man the mountains are awesome."
hockey,fcv0s2t,t1_fcv08lb,1577992309.0,Also the fact that Canadian players make up huge percentages of American team rosters. We grow up watching players play for local junior teams and then they get drafted by American teams and some people continue following them there. And weirdly sometimes it’s easier to watch American teams on tv because of local blackouts. I live near calgary and tons of oilers games are blacked out but a random two American team game could be on tv and not blacked out.
hockey,fcv04qm,t1_fcuzvjc,1577991949.0,Lots of Canadians live closer to US teams than Canadian ones. Especially in southern Ontario and the prairies.

hockey,fcl47ow,t1_fcl3t9d,1577739447.0,"Jarry hasn’t been the backup for a while. Murray started 3 games in December, all of which were the second half of back to backs."

fatlogic,fc9sp6c,t1_fc9pku7,1577557639.0,It definitely is. You don’t bring chairs backpacking. They’re car camping. They might sleep in a tent but when you’re obese air mattresses aren’t exactly the most comfortable so I’d lean trailer.
fatlogic,fc9rhco,t3_egrqt2,1577557110.0,"Before all the holiday eating and drinking: 130.2 lbs 

This morning: 130.4 lbs 

Seems I really didn’t need to be so nervous about gaining over the holidays. I should really trust myself more... since on Jan 4 it will be a solid 4 years of either losing or maintaining. All the work I’ve put in has really changed my appetite and also how much food I can physically eat. So even though I’ve felt that I’m gorging myself some days it’s no where close to the amount of food that used to trigger that feeling. I haven’t even touched the jumbo toblerone that I got in my stocking which in the past would be unheard of. I get one every year and that thing never even used to make it to New Years. Last year I think it made it to mid January and I expect it will be the same this year. 

I can’t wait to get home and get back to my bike and bootcamp though, even if I’ve been eating okay I have been so sedentary and it’s making me tired and lethargic.

Edit: also, I was going through boxes of my old stuff at my parents house and I fit into an old hockey shirsey from when I was about 10 years old. Nice."
