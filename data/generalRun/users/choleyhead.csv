UnresolvedMysteries,fec76il,t3_eo5vk6,1578967820.0,"I was in the fifth grade and wanted to go to my best friends house and play. What 10-11 year old me though was going to be a quick walk, was realistically probably an hour and a half walk. I had barely started, walking down a 5 lane road, heading down a hill and back up an even bigger hill, it was a pretty straight road. 

I kept glancing behind me, just to be aware of my surroundings as I always was at that age. I noticed a bus had stopped on the other side of the road further down the hill, I was almost to the top of the hill. The bus had picked up and dropped off some people. I noticed a guy who had gotten off the bus, as I glanced back he looked to be walking at a good pace, I was walking pretty fast because I wanted to get to my friends house quicker. 

After a little ways I decided to look back again, he was getting closer, but luckily he was still on the other side of the 5 lane road, so nothing to worry about. I kept trucking along, then looked back to where the man had been, he was gone. How was he gone, I was looking back frequently, I thought for a second that he walked into the neighborhood near by. Then I looked directly behind me and there he was, he was getting closer, this man had to have been speed walking with how quickly he was gaining on me. 

I was frantic at this point, part of me was saying to myself ""it's fine, he's just working out and I'm going to feel silly when he just blows right past me."" Another part of me was thinking ""oh my God, what do I do, this was a dumb idea, what do I do if he tries to take me."" 

I looked back one more time and he was right there. I was panicking on the inside. He came up and started talking to me in a foreign language, then he went to put his arm around my shoulder. At this point I was nearly to the top of the hill, maybe another 10 minutes walking, and at the top off the hill was a grocery store. I shook his arm from me and took off running, faster than I thought I could have run, at the time I had asthma so I was clenching my chest the harder I ran. I didn't even look back at this point, I just ran. 

As I got to the top of the hill I turned right and ran into the parking lot of the store. My legs felt like they were going to give way, every step I took the cement slammed into my feet. I thought I was going to trip and it would all be over. Not glancing back at all and only focused on the doors to the store, I hoped I would make it there before he made it to me.

I slammed open the doors a ran to the first adult I saw, I tried explaining to her as quickly as possible what had happened. It was finally over, I was safe. They called my mom and she came to pick me up, she had to walk too because I pretty sure her car was broken. I was relieved to see her walk in. I was so upset, the thought of my life changing in a matter of minutes. The experience felt like an eternity though. 

I can't remember what happened later, I think they had caught him hiding in a bush and had found out he abducted someone else prior to attempting to abduct me. And that's it. That was my too close to something sinister. I've got another story about a pee-pee man, I'll get back on in a bit and type that one up, that one was creepy."

interestingasfuck,fcon7zb,t1_fco9mck,1577836464.0,"Not the person you replied to and this is just my opinion based on life experience. The people in my family who have addiction problems also have a problem dealing with issues from the past in a healthy way. They made some mistakes/ someone hurt them/ victim complex, name your issue, that has been festering over time. They've used drugs to silence the nagging of those issues, then more issues arise due to their constant drug use, so once again they turn to drugs to silence it. It's a vicious cycle. If they were taught how to work through the issues plaguing them in a healthy manner, they wouldn't have needed to drown it out.

 I got really close to following the same path walked before me, I didn't want to think about the shit I had dealt with and what was the point if the one person I wanted to care didn't. My parent had chosen their addiction of my siblings and myself repeatedly. My parent probably could have said and done a lot of things that would have changed the course of my life. I was on a self destructive path because I couldn't handle what I was feeling. Then I got some therapy, talked it out, cried it out, until I was no longer afraid to look back on those things that hurt me so much. If I had someone to talk to earlier, maybe it could have been avoided, but I was told to pretend everything was normal, to keep up appearances. I was 10 years old, and I really needed someone to talk to, I felt alone, like I had no control over my life. That was the biggest thing, control, because my life and family was spiraling out of control I wanted something, anything I could control. I started cutting, was very sexually active, started using drugs, anything I myself could control. After struggling for many years on this same path, I grew up enough maybe 16 or 17 that there were people out there who could help me. I've done a lot of changing and a lot of growing, but I definitely think I would be in a way worse place if I hadn't gone to therapy.

Now this is all anecdotal, but I think there's something to mental wellness and drug abuse. Maybe we give it a try and invest some money in the young people out there to have someone to talk to. Like someone actually trained in handling bigger issues. Then let's see what happens, if it works then great, if it doesn't then we can stop the program.

AskReddit,fc43eas,t1_fc2gdcp,1577405589.0,"This is a big problem parents do to children. I had to grow up early because of an emotional unstable single parent turned to drugs. She was checked out. I had to take care of my two younger brothers as we hopped from house to house. Its hard because you're already going through a lot being a kid and figuring out who you are or just playing with friends. I had to tell my mom when I was 10 to leave me at a friend's house (she didn't know them) so I could continue to go to school, she was never going to wake up that early for the commute. It wore me down, my 'needs' vanished and it was survival for my brother's and myself. Being threatened with CPS by a boyfriend of my mother's who was mad he couldn't find her. Having to stop my mom from committing suicide twice.

This action puts a child through something they should never have to go through. It takes away their sense of security and teaches them they can't rely on the one person they need to be able to rely on. I couldn't trust my mom to make the right decisions. My grandparents ended up taking us in eventually, but I still had to deal with my mom's baggage. My grandma had a family policy of ' don't talk about it"" so on top of dealing with a lot at a young age, I had to lie and pretend everything was fine.

I probably have a lot of things I need to work out, luckily everything I went through made me responsible. I'm doing well in my life with a house, husband and dogs. I won't have kids because I want to break the cycle, and it's not alright, but I'll be okay."

facepalm,fc3rdnz,t1_fc3newf,1577396702.0,"True, people do seem to have some preconceived notions of how people are based off a label. Yeah hearing different point of views is cool. 

I agree with you to an extent about atheists needing faith, but it definitely depends on what type. Atheists who claim god does not exist without rational justification need faith, some have good arguments depending on which god they are talking about. I'm not that kind of atheist, I'm the kind that lacks a belief in a deity. I don't claim god is not real, I just don't believe claims that he is real.

Yes, history is interesting and much like a puzzle. That's interesting about thinking there would be repercussions after you die, I think it is a leap of faith on both fronts. I've heard someone say that maybe after you die is close to what is was before you were born.

It's a safe position to take, the ""I don't know if it's true...not willing to find out"" I guess that's the kind of thinking that has kept our species going, the err on the side of caution. I enjoy the paranormal stuff, certain things I'll do. I've been in a ""haunted"" house, some spooky stuff happened that could have been a ghost or it could have been my mind playing tricks on me. Scares the crap outta you though. But curiosity killed the cat. I think there's a lot of weird, interesting, unexplained things out there in this big universe and we all want an answer.
