It's really important to me to do whatever I can to help people get out of dark places or have one more tool to get back on their feet when life knocks them down again.

I wish you all the best on your journey, if you're still fighting then you're doing everything right. We can get through this together."
cscareerquestions,fdz05ei,t1_fdyt72v,1578785391.0,"That is so hard, I can't imagine all the feelings and stress you're dealing with. I'm sure there's so much on your plate and it can be hard to know where to start, but I don't want you to ever feel like the situation is hopeless. I think if you explore self compassion you'll find that you can handle your emotions/fears/stresses better and gradually start to chisel away at the different things you want to change.

The thing I want to highlight is that no matter what you want to do for other people or what you think you should be doing, it's really hard to make progress when your internal voice track is constantly attacking and criticising and judging yourself. I'm not saying that you can ""think positively and all the bad will go away."" I'm saying that once you stop defeating yourself mentally and coping better with your emotions then you'll actually be able to use 100% of your energy/focus/talent to make the changes you want to make. When you're constantly fighting yourself you only have like 15% of your power available for the world around you. Put on your own oxygen mask first and then be the person your family needs you to be.

Don't think that the game is over or you've lost or your situation is hopeless. There's a lot you want to change and I'm sure things are incredibly hard right now, but there are things you can do to get better and it sounds like you really do want to create positive changes. I think if you take small steps and be patient with yourself and be consistent then you'd be really surprised how different your life could be in a month, 6 months, 1 year, etc."
cscareerquestions,fdyy9p5,t1_fdyrbe7,1578784754.0,"I'm really sorry you're going through such a hard time right now, that's so much to deal with. Reddit can help for some stuff but I've also gotten some really good advice from therapists/counselors (not all are created equal and not all are cheap, got to look around a bit but there are also some groups that will provide help for a discount/free depending on your circumstances (victims of child abuse, vetrans, etc)). 

I have a hard time opening up to friends because I don't want to burden them also, but with an unbiased third party like a therapist it can be really nice to unload everything and get help when you know they've been trained to help with often the same thing you're going through and they are professional and kind about it.

The Self Compassion book is available on Audible, I prefer audiobooks also. It sounds like you are really hard on yourself and in many ways I really do feel that pain. I hope you get a chance to read the self compassion book, it was written to help with that exact situation and I think it would make a really big difference for you.  I wish you all the best, I promise things can get better if you stick with it!"
cscareerquestions,fdykx0p,t1_fdydltf,1578780885.0,"I am so glad that this resonated with you, thank you for your feedback! Life is really really hard but we're not in this alone and there's a lot of other people going through similar things. We can get through it together!

If you check my profile for the post titled ""You can't hate yourself into a better you"" I explain some self compassion ideas that might be useful for you. Anyone going through hard things needs to be able to lean on themselves instead of being too self-critical and making their life more difficult. Not sure if that kind of reading is up your alley but when I was going through the hardest part of my life it made a huge difference to stop beating myself up all the time."
cscareerquestions,fdyikbl,t1_fdye9r5,1578780117.0,"I look at people in terms of their potential. From that perspective, the only failure I really see is when people give up completely. That's when you lose the chance to make changes/improve your situation.

Think about someone that has some really hard life experiences outside of their control or legitimate mistakes that cost them big time. Maybe they aren't able to make measurable progress in their life for years or it takes a long time to get back on their feet.

In my opinion, if that person is doing their best and still *trying* to do well then the result they are getting does not make them a failure. A huge part of our results are outside of our control (interviewer was having a bad day, extremely qualified candidate/more experienced person applied to the same job we did, etc) so it's damaging and counterproductive to let our results determine our self-worth (failure vs success). 

If we keep getting undesirable results should we try to learn from them? Absolutely. If we do our best and fall short time and time again should we check all our options to make sure we aren't barking up the wrong tree (maybe applying to a different kind of tech job or getting a lower level foot in the door or trying a different kind of networking/starter company)? Yes we definitely should. 

I'm not saying do the same thing forever until it works. 

I'm saying that no one setback makes you a failure because you can keep trying and improving and learning and eventually you'll find a route (maybe not the route you expected) to where you want to go (which also might not be where you thought you wanted to be originally). The point is that *you wouldn't have gotten there if you quit*.

I believe in human beings and I think most people are capable of so much more than they realize because they get discouraged and quit early. Life is incredibly hard and there's so many setbacks and very few things go accordingly to plan. But people are also resourceful and creative and as long as we don't give up I think we can find lives that are fulfilling and rewarding and full of joy.

Anything I can do to help people keep fighting for what they want is worthwhile to me. We only fail when we give up and stop trying. That's when you lose the chance to learn and get what you want. Thomas Edison had to try over a thousand designs before he made a lightbulb that worked. What if he had quit after failure #999? That's the risk about quitting, because we never know where our progress bar actually is, but if stop trying then it can't continue to fill up."
cscareerquestions,fdx2alq,t1_fdwbtj8,1578764588.0,"Yes you hit the nail on the head. Anyone that identifies with u/___vim___ 's comment (I was in that boat for a loooooooong time) should consider checking out **Mindset: The New Psychology of Success** by Carroll Dweck, PhD. Really helps to stop letting failures define you and instead take them as a chance to learn."
cscareerquestions,fdx1bxw,t1_fdw8v5d,1578764269.0,"Healthy ways to process negative but unavoidable emotions is actionable advice, but since you already have a job you're not quite the audience I was aiming for (people having a hard time getting in the field).

For someone already in the door like you I'd recommend soft skills books (Emotional Intelligence 2.0, How to Win Friends and Influence People, etc). There's always more to learn and these skills can unlock a staggering amount of doors that techincal skill can't do on its own. Many technical people find those areas offputting but it's each person's choice if they want one more tool in their toolbox or not."
cscareerquestions,fdw69mp,t1_fdvsto7,1578755465.0,"You're absolutely right, we do have to learn from mistakes to get better. I didn't call that out specifically but it's equally as important as the ability to stick with a goal despite setbacks."
cscareerquestions,fdw59m4,t1_fdvzjar,1578755230.0,"I agree with you, and that skill to find a job can be learned. It's the trial and error along the way that I don't want to discourage people too much because it takes time to get there. No one is guaranteed the job they want on day 1, but they will never get it if they give up before they get there."

You've come so far in the last 3 years, and I'm really excited for you to offer yourself the self love and compassion that you deserve. You're a badass and it can take some practice to love yourself accordingly, but I believe in you and I wish you all the best!"
selfimprovement,fdfqu3t,t1_fd7bt7v,1578367981.0,"Yes yes yes yes I absolutely recommend that book for a good start. It's extremely helpful because it helps you learn the skill to catch yourself whenever that negative voice starts. You recognize it, you soothe it and replace it with kindness. It's impossible to yell over it and it takes time to change the habit, but this book has helped me SO MUCH in this area.

I am sorry to hear you've had so much pain in this area. This is really hard stuff to learn and I want you to know that we can get better and I believe in you. We deserve to be treated with kindness and love (especially from ourselves) and that's the quality of life that I want for both of us. We need to feel safe inside our own heads.

Have you read  Emotional Intelligence 2.0 by Jean Greaves and Travis Bradberry? It has a lot of great techniques for understanding and managing our emotions, as well as those of others. I also missed a lot of those lessons growing up and this book has helped me tremendously in that area."

&#x200B;

It is critically important to me that you understand three things:

1. You are not broken.
2. You are worthy of and deserve a great job, and you're smart enough, talented enough, hard working enough to earn it.
3. You are not alone in how you feel. So many people struggle with the same uncertainty and fears and anxieties and I guarantee you they can be overcome.

**Look at yourself from the outside**

I cannot imagine everything you've had to deal with over mental health. I have no doubt it has been incredibly difficult, but I'm not going to let you beat up ""past you"" when I know for a fact you and her both do so much right. I want you to imagine you have a friend that did everything you've done over the last year. A friend that worked so hard on her mental health and wanted to get better even though it is painful to work on. A friend who wanted to get into Computer Science and did all the projects and studied for all the tests and applied for job after job after job because she knew it was important to her and she really wanted to do what was best for her and her future. 

I have a strong feeling that you would really respect that friend's work ethic. I think you would be very impressed about how she always tried to do the right thing. No one is perfect, and you wouldn't hold that against your friend, but if you saw someone doing the exact same things you've done I think you would be very proud of them. We often hold ourselves to impossible standards, so please take time to give yourself credit for the great work you've done. You might even express gratitude and say something like the paragraph below out loud (this can really help process emotions/re-center):

""LightningOdin4, thank you so much for always trying to improve your mental health. Thank you for applying for all these jobs. I know it is so hard to keep going when you feel discouraged but I am so much farther along because of the work you put in. I know it was incredibly hard to keep going when things got so hard but you did and my life is so much better now because of you. I appreciate you, I love you.""

**You are not alone**

Everyone feels like everyone else has it figured out. We all feel like we're the only ones stumbling through life and everyone else is confident and sure of themselves and never has any problems.

Do you see how this is messed up?

I can guarantee you that Jeff Bezos and Brad Pitt and Jennifer Lopez or any other successful/famous person you can think of has tons of insecurities and fears and anxieties. I really encourage you to put down this belief of everyone else having life figured out. No one does, and that's okay. All we need to do is try our best, learn from our mistakes, and enjoy the time we have. No one is perfect and everyone is making it up as they go.

**You are good enough and you have everything you need to succeed**

The main qualities which correlate with success are 1) the work ethic to actually try things persistently and 2) the ability to learn from our mistakes. 

Those qualities define 95% of success, and the other 5% is luck. It's pretty clear to me that you have those two, and you are doing so much right by trying to get better and being so persistent and not giving up. I really admire how much grit and resilience you have. It makes you an extremely powerful person. Natural talent means very little when it comes to success because there will always be things that knock us down. People that have always had things come easy to them don't know how to handle those situations. They get stumped and they quit. You've had to fight really hard for a lot of things in your life and you're not afraid of trying new things and working hard. Well, maybe you get scared sometimes but you don't give up, which is why you will go farther than people with natural talent alone. 

Your work ethic and persistence and ability to learn from experience makes you very well prepared to accomplish a ton of things in life. You're doing your best and that is all anyone (including you) can expect. I'm proud of the work you've done and I believe in you!

Lastly, no one knows what they want to do out of school. That's okay. The market for computer science people is very strong and you can try different things to see what you like. I graduated in 2015 with a degree in CS and tried a few different things until I found something I wanted to do for a long time. It's a great field to be in and I have no doubt you'll go very far.  I'm so so so happy that you're considering self-compassion as a way to continue growing, because you seem like a great person and once you are ""on your own team"" you will be unstoppable!

If you have any questions about how to get a CS internship or would like me to review your resume then shoot me a PM. I've interviewed/hired a lot of people so I might be able to share some pointers."

selfimprovement,fd2matp,t1_fd2k2v9,1578149252.0,"Short answer: You can't make yourself feel love for yourself or anyone. But you can choose actions that show love and care and compassion, and those will create the feelings we're after.

Love is a verb. Love means trying to understand how you're feeling. It means being patient with yourself and kind with yourself when things are hard. It also means taking care of your own needs and making time for the things that make you happy so you don't overtax yourself.

Most of what I know about self love comes from Kristin Neff's book on self compassion, because I was horribly horribly cruel to myself before I learned how to show myself kindness. I think once you learn the habits that make you self compassionate, then you'll do the things that people with self love do, and you'll start feeling the love for yourself that you want."

First things first: You are not alone. I think most people that invest in personal development feel like this often. We're perfectionists. Self worth becomes binary. Either we're perfect or we're worthless. Many many people go through this and I really do believe there is a better way. We can grow and still feel good about ourselves when we make mistakes.

Secondly I want you to know that you're already doing so much right. You are trying to improve. Trying to grow, trying to feel better. Most people aren't willing to even try things, they are an empty balloon sitting on the ground deflated. You're full of the right stuff and trying your best to rise, we just need to cut the string of counterproductive self talk that's holding you back, then you'll grow into everything you can be. You are doing so much right, take a moment to thank the past version of you for working so hard to get better. You put in a lot of time and work and that's worth being proud of.

There's a short exercise you can read and apply quickly throughout the day if you feel your emotions taking you to dark places.

Dude you are like, REALLY REALLY GOOD AT D&D. I absolutely love seeing people who are really into their hobbies and passionate. That means you have a very real interest and talent for things like story telling and understanding people. I'm sure this brings you a lot of fun and helps you connect with other people, but honestly these skills are so so so so important in lots of other areas too.

I had similar hobbies when I was your age and I'd encourage you to continue developing these skills, it pays off big time. The ability you have for communication and story telling and your creativity will make you stand out way above a lot of other people. I realize that things are really hard right now and I can't imagine how you're feeling, but it's really important to me that you know how much potential I see in you. The things you enjoy, the things you are incredibly good at are a golden ticket to a ton of amazing things in your future.

You're going to get through this and I promise you will find a lot of happiness and a terrific partner to cherish in the future when there are less forces acting against you. Try not to get too wrapped up in your current circumstance. You are a human being with a lot of talent and skill and creativity.
