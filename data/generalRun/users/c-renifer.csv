She suffered from epilepsy, and most likely had a grand mal seizure that ended her life. 

She was not yet 40 years old.

She was a really sweet person who was amazing in so many ways.

My friend is stoic, almost to the point of appearing to have [reduced affect display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_affect_display), and he didn't cry or even show any upset about it, even though I know it's hurting him.  He gets this way when he's depressed, and no, it's not mental illness, it's just profound sadness expressed as an almost non-reaction.

I cried because he is someone who has known great loss in his life, and he didn't deserve this latest loss.  He is alone again at middle age, and he's likely never going to have another partner.

I sobbed for hours, knowing that he cannot.  The happiness that he knew has left his life forever."

AskReddit,ffpp3xx,t3_eu725g,1580100895.0,"I lived 6 miles from Hanscom Air Force Base which is in Bedford, MA at the top of a big hill that overlooks the area.

I dropped my wife off at her work and was traveling to my work, when I heard on the radio on the Howard Stearn show that a plane had struck the World Trade Center.

I stopped at a coffee shop that had televisions with the news on, and saw the smoking building.  No one else had really noticed yet that this was a big thing, but I knew that planes don't just hit buildings.  I have a good friend and a brother who are pilots.

I called my wife to tell her that something was up, and to watch the news.

Then the second plane hit the other building, and I knew, and then everyone in the coffee shop knew that this was an attack.  People stopped what they were doing.  It was eerie.

I went to my home and listened and watched with binoculars to see the jets scramble to try to fight off this attack, and I waited 90 minutes from when I heard it on the radio, and \*finally\* jets screamed by at very high speed.  Technically it must have been longer than 90 minutes, because it may have taken a short while for someone to call into the show.

The flight path southbound takes the jets directly over Walden Pond, so they were not hard to spot, and they were loud.  I was angry and upset that they waited so long.

I have wondered, why, when the public knew that this was an attack, why would the Air Force wait an hour and a half to scramble jets to meet the threat?

My guess is that they knew, and waited for orders to scramble, and they waited a very long time.  By the time the jets were in the air, it was all over.

This nation had four jets doing u-turns in the sky and disabled transponders, and no Air Force to stop them.  The only military planes in the air were those of Air Force One.

I am not a conspiracy theorist.  I am merely reporting what I experienced that day.  I know that waiting that long to scramble jets proved completely ineffective in stopping the attacks."

I know, it sounds nutty, but my Nana was nutty.  What can I say.
My aunt says that she was mentally ill, and I believe that.
My Nana's parents were awful people, and she was married for a few years and divorced soon after and my grandfather married a woman much younger.

My grandfather was a piece of work himself, and abused her and my father.
My great grandfather was also and abusive and cruel person.

Abuse tends to be like that, running in families for a long time until someone stops it.
Abuse and religion go together like hand and glove.

videos,ff5np73,t1_ff5gd8f,1579602094.0,"My grandmother was a horrible person.
She was bitter and angry her whole life, made worse by religion.
She was a ""Christian Scientist"", which was an oxymoron, because she held neither Christian or scientific views.
She never told me about it, and even my mother was so racked with guilt that she only told me recently (I'm nearly 60).

To give you an example of just how mean spirited she was:
My father was an attorney who was doing a will for an old woman, when she died only days before it was complete.  She had a dog who was blind, poor thing.  We took it in, and he got settled, but my grandmother kept moving the furniture, and he kept hitting his head.  Our poor beagle died as a result of head trauma.  This is who she was.  I loved that dog.  Sweetest animal I ever knew.

She said that she had to move the furniture to clean, but nothing ever got cleaner, and I realized that she was lying.
She hated the dog and wanted it gone, and so it was.

She was crazy and mean, and I hated being around her, and she had killed our dog, so I set up a tent in the side yard and lived there for a month until my father came home from his extended trip overseas.  I never forgave her, but I didn't know that she was the one who had damaged my body permanently.  

This is why I warn people about religion.  In the hands of someone like my grandmother, it's really dangerous, because they do terrible things and absolve themselves of all responsibility.  It's always ""God's plan"", or ""God works in mysterious ways""."

I'm sure that the person that gave me the measles and nearly killed me back when I was 4 years old didn't realize what they were doing, or that it could have been prevented.  Getting vaccines protects everyone, including the people who get them.  It's hard for some people to understand and accept this part of society, but putting babies, young children, the elderly and the already immune compromised at risk is not only not smart, it can be deadly.

My son was born with a heart defect, a mitral valve that didn't work right.

He had two surgeries, with the second being effective.

I also lost my faith due to two suicides in my family, my brother and my cousin who were both young men who despaired because of dysfunctional families and bad experiences, and possibly bipolar disorder.

I too searched the scripture and talked with church elders to figure out what had happened and what to do and how to cope.

They had no answers, as there are no references to suicide in the Bible.

Over time, I realized that if there truly was a god, that god would have saved my family and spared me grief and anguish and thoughts of suicide.

When I learned that my child would require surgery to survive past the age of 12, and that this would be risky and expensive, I was concerned and worried, but I didn't despair, because I lived in a place where medicine and community were important, and my son got the surgery and treatment that he needed.

Conservative Christians within my family asked why I didn't pray and ask God for help.

I asked them why I should ask a god for help when he had never done so in the past, even once.

I asked them why I should ask a god for help when, if it was ""God's plan"", he created the problem to begin with, and could easily change it.

I said that if a god was so weak and ineffective that he required worship and prayer to be motivated and had never once shown to be an interventionist, that praying would do no good, as I was an unbeliever, and he is a feckless god that has no power to make things right that he made wrong.
