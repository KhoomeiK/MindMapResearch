Anxiety,fe66ma5,t1_fe65ykq,1578882957.0,I’ve also felt nausea from extreme excitement in the past and never put the two together:c well I’m glad you’re doing better now c: and thank you for being assuring it means a lot
Anxiety,fe66fqu,t1_fe655vr,1578882842.0,That’s literally exactly what I went through oh my god. Most people I think have never heard of this or experience this and too them it probably sounds like nonsense it’s unfortunate that severe cases of anxiety aren’t talked about enough so they seem dramatic or strange to most because it seems like there’s one narrative of what anxiety should look like. I hope you’re doing a lot better now though

Anxiety,fe5q4qm,t1_fe5pvgo,1578872981.0,Yea I smoke weed to help with the nausea when I can but that’s obviously not always appropriate depending on place and time. I’ve heard of CBD but never fully looked into from what I understand it’s like weed but without the high affects right? It helps with nausea sometimes I’ll look into it more!

Anxiety,fe5mbbw,t1_fe5khyq,1578871304.0,That’s horrible :( I get really nauseous in social situation that make me uncomfortable which causes me to avoid social interaction tbh. Like I’m beyond introvert I’m a straight up hermit which I think has only made my nausea worse. I feel bad telling people well maybe there anxiety is not as bad as mine as I don’t want to discredit anyone who has gone through anxiety but when I get told things like that I feel like I’m being totally discredited. And I didn’t know it could become life threatening! :( when I got my first job I threw up everyday for a month straight and lost a ton of weight and was too embarrassed to tell anyone because of the judgement of “you’re being dramatic”. Also I’m a bit overweight so being told “wow you look so good what’s your secret?” Was very uncomfortable for me. I really hope we both learn to get control of this unfortunate symptom. One day at a time right? Thank you for taking your time to respond I hope you have a good day (:
Anxiety,fe5l0b1,t1_fe5jy2m,1578870792.0,Okay the fact that even one person relates makes me feel better...I thought I was a freak especially when others with anxiety put me down for not having the exact type of anxiety as them..like anxiety is an exclusive club and I don’t fit because I’m dramatic when I dry heave..but the fact that you feel the same way..makes me instantly feel less alone. I’m sorry tho that you also experience this feeling it  sucks feeling physically sick when you’re already going through a lot mentally. This is my first time posting here so I’m not sure if I’m aloud to ask this and sorry if it makes you uncomfortable feel free to ignore this but have you found any coping skills when you feel nauseous so you don’t? I can deal with most of my anxiety but nauseous still gets the best of me.
