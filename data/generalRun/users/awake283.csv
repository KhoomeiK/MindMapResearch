Wrigley was a dump ten years ago, literally falling apart. How can we not be happy that the Ricketts fixed the stadium and the area? It improves the image of the Cubs so much.

But those last four are also the problem. It's not that the Ricketts are cheap, they've LITERALLY spent over a billion dollars just in the last \~5 years. It's that the money we've invested in FA's has almost been all bad. And also they dont want to go over the luxury tax in consecutive seasons. 

They're not cheap. Blame is on Theo imo. Bad news is we have to wait for some money to clear up.. good news is we only have 87M committed for 2021, and 59 for 2022. We just have to find a way to be competitive and get through this season. More good news is our division, besides Cincy, hasn't done shit all either."

CHICubs,fdfqa01,t1_fdfpjwu,1578367621.0,"I dont understand this way of thinking. Not trying to argue - I am just being honest. It benefits the fan experience. Wrigley was a dump ten years ago, literally falling apart. How can we not be happy that the Ricketts fixed the stadium and the area? It improves the image of the Cubs so much. Helps attract FA's, helps provide money to sign those FA's. I feel like if no renovations were done there'd be people here complaining about *that* instead."
CHICubs,fdflfmt,t3_el2ana,1578364432.0,"I still dont understand the 'Ricketts are cheap' argument. 500-750M in Wrigley renovations.. Darvish, Lester, Heyward, Kimbrel. But those last four are also the problem. It's not that the Ricketts are cheap, they've LITERALLY spent over a billion dollars just in the last \~5 years. It's that the money we've invested in FA's has almost been all bad. And also they dont want to go over the luxury tax in consecutive seasons. 

They're not cheap. Blame is on Theo imo. Bad news is we have to wait for some money to clear up.. good news is we only have 87M committed for 2021, and 59 for 2022. We just have to find a way to be competitive and get through this season. More good news is our division, besides Cincy, hasn't done shit all either."
