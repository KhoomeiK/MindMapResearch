todayilearned,fgiu4w1,t1_fgidch2,1580830964.0,"OMG there are plenty of other tech companies around besides those guys. There are smaller companies which still are multi million dollar companies and those have moved in, moving their people, driving up home prices in the bay area because they HAVE to be in the coveted Silicon Valley. Sorry I can't remember their names I've blocked them out, not into tech. The latest one reportedly moved to SF area last summer/fall. There was a lot of fuss on the local news about what what that would mean for home prices (drive up) and the local economy in general (not good)."
Showerthoughts,fgi246f,t1_fghtkrn,1580802037.0,"Some did. My oldest brother was born in 1963, so a boomer, and all his kids are millennials. My brother 1.5 yrs younger than him is gen-x and his kids are millennials and gen-z. I narrowly missed being a millennial, born a few months before the cut off.

I don't understand the blind hatred either. I guess it's just easier to blaim the generation that came before you for all your problems, than to suck it up and deal with it like a grown up."
todayilearned,fghsxqq,t1_fgheeaj,1580792946.0,"But it wasn't us (4th generation here) that ""wrecked"" the state, its everyone that flooded into the state, used up the resources, and fled for greener pastures. Tech companies moved in and drove up the cost of living for everyone who have been here for generations, making it impossible for anyone to eek out an existence. Even the nice areas where I'm from are no longer nice. There are homeless encampments along those areas...its sticking and heartbreaking. You want all of the damn tech without seeing where it comes from or what its REALLY done to the local economy. FUCK YOU!!"
aww,fggpto9,t1_fgftosg,1580766917.0,Just call your vet and say you found a cat and want to check for a chip. My vet wouldn't charge for that.
funny,fggckgs,t1_fga6l7t,1580759013.0,"No. Breed standards. In European countries long ago, you would get tax breaks on working dogs. You proved it by having their tail docked. Look at the ""working"" group in a dog show sometime. Most of them, including the Dobie, which I've had several of, had docked tails (mine had natural ears though). Other breeds have been separated out of the working group, including a lot of terriers and sight hounds, many of which had/still have jobs to do and have docked tails."

FuckYouKaren,fgezkua,t1_fgdq7zc,1580716641.0,"I know people who swear by essential oils. And frankly, a few of them were more than a tiny bit unhinged. EOs do just about anything you want, suppossedly. Sleep aids, digestive aids, help with anxiety, energy boost, calming, etc. I tried one for migraines (rub a few drops onto your temples, under your nose and back of neck during a migraine). It helped a tiny bit, but I am not a convert (much rather stick with real meds that do work). As far as EOs go, I'm  more of a ""if you like the scent, get it and enjoy it"" type person, I don't buy into how its supposed to ""help"" me.

What the Karen's of this world don't understand is that there is no such thing as a miracle cure and all the snake oil aka Essential Oils in the world will not ""fix"" a normal teenage boy."
AmItheAsshole,fg88wdl,t3_excuhx,1580612681.0,"NTA Its the parents job to keep their kid safe. Doubly so for a severely autistic kid prone to running off. I can't imagine what it's like to be a parent to a kid like that, but to do nothing when you see your child run off after a stranger? And then, when that stranger kindly leads your child back to berate him...there should be nothing but gratitude towards OP. He did a good thing by getting the kid back to his parents safely."
funny,fg84j02,t1_fg81r8e,1580609331.0,"Breed standards. If you want to show them, at least in the US, certain breeds need cropped ears. It's done when they are very young, sometimes by the breeders, sometimes by the owners. I had Dobie's, had no intentions of showing them, so they kept their natural floppy ears. I think they look better that way."

FuckYouKaren,fg0uu54,t1_ffzu8zj,1580415464.0,"When you see someone obviously in the middle of a medical emergency, with people giving them first aid, I think you can get your damn deli meat another time! 

Not only is your view cold hearted, but by stepping over the injured person, you would be impeding their medical aid. No, they can't be moved, seizures happen where they happen and they unfortunately need to be dealt with there until help comes. So sorry if it ""inconveniences"" you or is ""unsightly."""
FuckYouKaren,ffy2q1j,t1_ffy0s0w,1580337431.0,"I've always heard it phrased ""Do you feel safe at home?""
Because they don't know your exact living situation and anyone in the home could be abusive towards you."
OutOfTheLoop,ffujdpn,t1_ffu0h06,1580243197.0,"Allergies, kitty litter reek (I've been in houses where it was overwhelming and their human didn't seem to notice), rubbing their faces on everything, clawing everything in sight, the fact that they jump on the counters constantly. I worked as a caregiver in a home with 2 cats. The cats were sweet, but I had to watch them like a hawk. I could not leave the kitchen if there was food out because the cats would be there instantly inhaling food. OMG I hated that job for so many reasons (woman was a narcissist) but the cats made it even worse."
AmItheAsshole,ffsvu9p,t1_ffsbvbb,1580194516.0,"This. OP's husband should have her back, so to speak. This bs should have ended long ago. He needs to step up and talk to his mom and everyone else and basically tell them to knock it off. Or, more kindly, keep their opinions to themselves. OP, her husband and their daughter are a family and he needs to prioritize them over the extended family from now on."
migraine,ffsrqte,t3_euws4a,1580190095.0,"I have these, and a pair from AxonOptics. Both help cut down the pain, and if I put them on at the onset, I can sometimes keep it from progressing too far.

AxonOptics are much lighter in color, which surprised me, and I was dubious as to whether they would work as well as the Theraspecs, which I had first. But I have a pair of sunglasses from AxonOptics that I can't live without (they are so much better than the darkest sunglasses I've ever had), so I gave them a try. I like them better for preventative care as the Theraspecs make everything look very pink and with the Axons the color difference is minimal.

Yes, both are spendy, and they know it. Costumer service is great, though. Also, both websites have coupon codes, you have to look for them, though. Watch for sales. I bought my AxonOptics glasses during the Memorial day weekend sale last year. Black Friday, I think was a bit better."
AmItheAsshole,fffotir,t1_ffeusku,1579888559.0,"I can see OP getting more snarky comments from her friend any time she comments on the hardships/struggles of motherhood...""at least you have a child, quit rubbing it in our faces."" Oi. OP needs to have a talk with her friend and tell her how hurtful her comments are to her. If she knocks it off, great, if not, hide/block her because you shouldn't have to constantly see negative comments about your baby."
migraine,fej9s7g,t1_feil30c,1579163172.0,"The pricey migraine glasses from axon optics are more of a light pink and barely noticeable compared to the cheaper ""migraine glasses,"" meaning, I don't get funny looks when wearing them like I did with other brands. And they important thing is, for me at least, they work (they don't work for everyone unfortunately). I have hypersensitive eyes even without a migraine, so it was worth the extra cost to me. The second I put them on, I feel the tension and pain leave my eyes, and I have minimized the effects of a migraine by putting them on. Doesn't make it go away, but definitely cuts the pain level down a bit.

FYI, Wearing sunglasses inside occasionally because a migraine happens is okay, but wearing them inside regularly could actually make your eyes more sensitive to light."

And my old standby of pulling my hair into a ponytail? Yeah, can't do that with a migraine anymore. Having hair at all with a migraine is a pain."

I've lived through years of wildfires in California, driven through the burned out remains of what used to be familiar neighborhoods. My heart breaks every time I see pics of the fires, the fact that they are uncontrollable boggles the mind and worries me to no end. It is truly hard to imagine the sheer amount of destruction and loss."
