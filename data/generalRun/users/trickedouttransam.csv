Screenwriting,ffgj0z6,t1_ffgekav,1579907355.0,"Austin area screenwriter here and this just blew the wind out of my sails. I’d always heard AFF was one of the best.

I do know someone who made 2nd round with an unfinished first attempt at writing a script that had no clear story line. He let me read it and I honestly couldn’t tell you what it was about, even after reading 40 pages.
He was invited to be a reader the following year and declined.

I *have* heard lots of positive comments about the writer’s conference panels; it seemed that people got lots of good info and the networking among fellow aspiring writers was a good experience.

Are Nicholls or Page legit? I have seen a list of criteria Nicholls uses to judge scripts.


This all makes me sad because I’m a writer who can’t just move to LA, so now I’m wondering how I’ll ever sell anything. 

I’m not a film major, I’m a writer. I’ve tried many times to be hired as an unpaid PA on films to no avail.

This makes me feel like just solely writing fiction instead. Still competitive and success rates are low but the glimmer of hope for possible publication seems better.

Too bad I already submitted a short screenplay for this year’s AFF. Oh well, live and learn."

I've trained mine that the only person that can take their food away is me, sometimes I have to grab it and move them to another room is another dog is hovering too close.

Dinner is serious business."

I'm wondering if I should call today (before 6 Eastern) or tomorrow. I'm pitching  a project to make a movie out of a rock opera that came out in the late 80s and I'm really nervous. I'm just looking to see who owns they copyrights to the music but they want more info from me about my vision. I'm an empath and phone conversations are hard because I can't directly read people.

Edit: it was my bfâ€™s uncle and he had just gotten a new job literally after he bought a new house. My bf and I wanted to get out of our home town so we jumped at the chance.

Danny asked me if I had a film proposal....um no. (I haven't worked up a budget for something I haven't written.)

I have the structure written as well as a one pager concept, but I don't have a mood board, or the budget done.

I feel like such a dork. I was just trying to find out who owned the rights to the music and he thought I had it all but filmed pretty much. 

Wondering if I should try and cobble together a proposal by next week...
