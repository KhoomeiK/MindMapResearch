TwoXChromosomes,fflo87d,t3_etzp1z,1580042017.0,"Oh honey. You and I have a lot in common. My birth mother was also raped, and I was the product. 

We are not bad people. The rapist is the bad person. My birth mother put me up for adoption because she was terrified that I’d resemble the rapist. 

We can’t let the circumstances of our birth define our lives. Your Mom loves you. My Mom loved me. 

If you want to talk, please feel free to message me. I struggled for years with guilt. It’s gone now, and I’m very glad to be here."
