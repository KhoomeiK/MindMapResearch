Save something for yours too before getting on high horse. Talking about bigotry, I don't go to Pakistan sub with my half-assed knowledge about the ground reality there and claim it to be worse than India because I'm aware of the limitations of my knowledge, something you seem to be unable to fathom. Sit down and think for yourself. 

> As the OP said, if Pakistan was so bad for minorities, why did Pakistani Hindus and Christians openly rejected India's offer of citizenship.

Because a person's identity is not solely based on religion. It is tied to region, culture and economy of the environment in which he/she was brought up. The minorities of Pakistan will have to sever ties with a part of their life and relations and move huge amount of movable assets if they're planning to move to a new country, and also have to worry about finding out a new livelihood there. It's not because Pakistan is better than India for minorities. The same will happen if Pakistan offers citizenship to Indian muslims, even amid all this chaos. Majority of them will reject without having a second thought.  To understand this though, one needs to have an iota of grey matter and an open mind. 

Coming to the quote again, 
> if Pakistan was so bad for minorities, why did Pakistani Hindus and Christians openly rejected India's offer of citizenship.

Lol What the OP said was factually wrong, but I understand you quoting it as it is something that will align with what the Pakistani government must be spoon-feeding you. [From here:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism_in_Pakistan#Decline_and_persecution)  

> Some Hindus in Pakistan feel that they are treated as second-class citizens and many have continued to migrate to India.[106][107] According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan data, just around 1,000 Hindu families fled to India in 2013.[108] In May 2014, a member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, revealed in the National Assembly of Pakistan that around 5,000 Hindus are migrating from Pakistan to India every year.[109]

So much for Pakistani Hindus rejecting Indian citizenship offer!

Coming to this: 
> While you have to go back 5 and 7 decades to find some public riot against Ahmadis, **which had no government support**, I can give you a laundry list of religious riots and pogroms in India since 1947, in which thousands of people were killed, and in most cases by your very government.

I suppose, in a hurry to reply fast, you missed out on the details and blurted out whatever you had in your head. Your painting of the persecution of Ahammadiyas being an ancient phenomenon was cute, though it lacked coherence with reality. [This list, I have to remind it once again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Ahmadis#Pakistan) had the details for attacks on Ahammadiyyas until 2018. 

Talking about having no government support after stripping them of their constitutional rights (which for human beings with common sense has to be an indicator), you can feed that bullshit to your peers in /r/Pakistan. 

> Ahmadis are declared non-Muslims in Pakistan. Yes that is deplorable as the state does not need to decide someone's religion. . The bigotry against them from the religious sections is limited to calling them ''kafirs''.

Oh please hang on right there. Could you please for once recognize the quantum of stupidity in your arguments? ""Limited to calling them kafirs"" Jesus fucking Christ despite all these murders and attacks the list of which was provided even, I don't have words! I'm not limiting to Ahammadiyas, how about the other minorities including Christians, Hindus and Shias? 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_discrimination_in_Pakistan#Violence_against_minorities
> there have been 446 incidents of violence against the Shia Muslims in Pakistan between 2003 and May 2016, in which more than 2558 people have been killed and over 4518 others injured.[66]
> According to an Open Doors claim in November 2017, Pakistan had the highest number of Christians killed in the world during the 12-month time period of 1 November 2015 to 31 October 2016, with 76 Christians being killed in the country. Pakistan also topped the list of most number of documented church attacks, accounting for 600 of the total 1329 churches attacked worldwide during the same time period.[61]

And India is supposed to be worse than Pakistan for minorities? 

Now

> While you have to go back 5 and 7 decades to find some public riot against Ahmadis, which had no government support, I can give you a laundry list

Now

I mean we have atleast party members and ministers who are actually **elected** by the people.

Now coming to rape threats, how deep your neck has been inside the shitpit that has been fed by your educational system and the Pakistani military if you believe the Pakistani authorities have never done similar or worse things?

india,fcbzt1z,t1_fcalhby,1577592805.0,"I respectfully disagree. The reason why the minorities in Pakistan is having or maybe having (because I don't know what the ground reality there) a marginally better life (?) than their Indian counterpart is because the religious insecurity of the majority has been quenched by making it a religious state, while in India the insecurity thrives and grows by purported ""secular"" (atleast by the book) status of the Indian state. Minorities in Pakistan suffer from various injustices either state sponsored or otherwise as could be inferred from the media reports coming from there. For example, there was a Christian woman who was wrongly accused of blasphemy and who was acquitted by the court, but the majority were against her acquittal, conducted violent protests and wanted her to be hanged. There was an atheist who was accused of insulting islam and was mob lynched in his university. These are anecdotes and I'm sure we can tell similar stories about India too, though I don't think the general public of India is as blood thirsty as the general public of Pakistan when their core insecurity (religion) is triggered. At least in India, we have massive protests going on against this latest discrimination against minorities but what does the general public of Pakistan is doing against their discrimination of Ahammadiyas amd Shiites? Nothing.. Pakistan is literal shithole of the world. India is not there yet but is reaching there at light speed."
