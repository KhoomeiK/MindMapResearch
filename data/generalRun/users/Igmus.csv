NoStupidQuestions,fehulk3,t1_fehtv75,1579124177.0,So I should get tests for my other brothers to see what kind of results we get? Paternal haplogroup is different... This makes me more depressed...

Similar mechanism, someone can design around this. Extend the 3rd knuckle and extend the socket for the finger nub to allow for a full finger instead of an amputated one."

gardening,fc24dcm,t1_fc1khmx,1577339927.0,That's crazy. Mine stopped flowering for 9 months... While I had 8 lemons growing. 5 of them fell off and only 3 grew to full size. No flowers bloomed during the time I was growing the lemons. Once I harvested the 3 lemons it was ready for my drought experiment and it worked. So now I'm hand pollinating flowers. The tree is in a very controlled environment so there are no natural drops in temperature or drought that happens.
gardening,fc1ft1z,t1_fc1cnak,1577317477.0,It is a lot I just wanted control over the light and the spectrum. I wasn't getting the right light I wanted for my plants. But the setting I put makes my leaves perk up at 45Â°. My tree is barely a foot.
gardening,fc0uedw,t1_fc0tig3,1577299926.0,"Viparspectra TC1350 1350W at 40 veg and 22 bloom, 18 inches away at the center around 7 on the outer edges. On a timer 12 hours on 12 off. My par meter is out of battery, I'll give you readings when I finish charging. Consistent 45 - 50 humidity and temp 70Â° - 79Â°. Watered once a week with Jack's Classic Citrus feed 20-10-20."
gardening,fc0t7v5,t1_fbzvavt,1577299102.0,That's how you induce flowering. Drought or cold temperatures.
gardening,fc0t389,t1_fbyhsw0,1577299023.0,Mine is 100% artificial. But I'm not the person you commented to lol.
gardening,fc0stkj,t1_fby5ddq,1577298858.0,"Twice sounds great, I'll try that out. I was hoping for more of a lemon ready every month kind of thing but I guess I don't want to stress out the plant too much."
gardening,fc0sn2w,t1_fbyj45p,1577298737.0,"Keep the good weather conditions up indoors it might live. I did drought conditions instead of cold weather and I lost a lot of leaves too and I thought my tree would die, but some leaves stayed and shortly after that holy crap the flowers came in, flowers on each branch, new branches with flowers growing every 2 cm... if it survives"
gardening,fc0scmk,t1_fbyzdky,1577298512.0,I used drought conditions instead of temperature drop. I lost a lot of leaves but the ones that stayed kept it alive. If you have leaves that stayed you'll get a lot of flowers when the tree rebounds back from the stress. Good luck!
gardening,fc0s773,t1_fbzvavt,1577298393.0,"What did you do? I did ""threaten"" it's life with drought like conditions, but not to the point of my tree dying. It lost a bunch of leaves but some stayed. I honestly thought all the leaves would fall off."
gardening,fc0s0fu,t1_fbzc301,1577298253.0,Drought conditions. See comment above.
gardening,fc0rv1p,t1_fby5ddq,1577298150.0,"I induced it by simulating drought conditions. Stopped watering it until the leaves went from 45Â° to more like 180Â° so they're not really wilting per-se but they're really feeling it. Then I watered as per usual and a couple of days later, flowers everywhere! You might lose some leaves, though. Mine lost a lot of leaves but the ones that stayed kept it alive."
