IdiotsInCars,fep7tq4,t3_eq99y6,1579314076.0,"For decades, “peak stupid” has been a scenario looming large in the popular imagination: The world’s production of mind numbingly stupid decisions tops out and then starts an inexorable decline— forcing nations to lay down strict rationing programs and battle for shrinking reserves. U.S. stupidity did reach peak in the 1970s, with trends such as the pet rock defining the era, and sank for decades after, exactly as the theory predicted. But then it did something the theory didn’t predict: It started rising again in 2001, and hasn’t stopped, thanks to a leap forward in social media technology.

To the peak-stupid adherents, this is just a respite, and decline is inevitable. But a growing tide of stupid-industry experts argue that peak stupid looks at the situation in the wrong way. The real constraints we face are lack of still giving a shit and thinking through things at all, they say. We’re limited not by the lack of critical thinking, but by how completely apathetic we are about the world around us, reaching new sources of stupid by not even considering the well-being of ourselves and others for a split second."

Okay, I've got to rant slightly off topic about expensive luggage in general.  Don't feel obligated to read further...

However, it is the least reasonable thing to splurge on unless you are, let's say, retired doctor rich.  No matter how well made your suitcase is, the baggage handlers will definitely find a way to destroy it.  Really high-end luggage generally lasts longer, but maybe only a few times longer than cheap stuff.  The thing is, it cost 10x as much.  I'm not saying to buy the cheapest you can, but don't go for the top-of-the-line stuff.  

The other argument to be made for it is that it looks nice.  Well, you will only be seen with it for a very small number of hours per trip, even if you are traveling to several countries.  It is mostly going to be in a trunk, plane, or hotel.  Once again, if you are a retired doctor, maybe dishing out premium cash for something that will be destroyed in a couple dozen trips is worth it to class up your hotel room and airport swagger, but not for most people."
