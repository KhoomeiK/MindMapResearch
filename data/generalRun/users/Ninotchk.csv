He needs to read up on biologics before his next derm appointment, including finding out your insurance policy on them for various diagnoses because if he has axial disease they will go straight for biologics and skip DMARDs. Some insurances require step therapy no matter what, some may allow him to go straight to biologics because axial. The derm might start him on a DMARD in advance of seeing a rheum which might then qualify as step therapy. It's pretty variable based on your insurance, and only the rheum can diagnose the axial spondyloarthropathy.
