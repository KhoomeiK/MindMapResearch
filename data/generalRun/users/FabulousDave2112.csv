In ""Believe"" it was done stylistically, like using any special effect on any other instrument (phasers, tremolos, etc). But it was a layer of colour on an already talented voice.

Nowadays it's used to completely mask many talentless singers, and is so pervasive in the industry it gives skilled musicians a bad rep through association. Pitch correction has existed in recording for decades, but it still needed a solid base track to work from. Now it can make anyone sound like a human synthesizer with perfect pitch, while cutting away any nuance their voice may have.

As a tool, it's a huge asset. It can save hours of recording time trying to get that ""perfect"" take. But there's no denying it's also become a bit of an overused crutch.

But hey, all this machinery making modern music can still be open-hearted (RIP Neil)"

ABoringDystopia,fer0ttl,t3_eq3yk6,1579348318.0,"""It had been almost a century since the Second Great War. The nations of the world came together in a mighty Union, in hopes that such catastrophe would never strike again. In the decades that followed, Humanity enjoyed decades of overall growth and prosperity. Old enemies repaired ties and became friends as the world realized what could be accomplished in an unprecedented era of communication.

""Over time, the Great Wars faded from memory. The brave soldiers passed on, and their stories slipped away into the annals of history.

""At first, we didn't even notice it happening. A revolution here, an invasion there. Passing banners on the evening news.

""Mighty cities, oases of the desert lands that were once havens of progress and enlightenment fell twice. First under the oppressive boot of an invader, and then again under the tyrannical rule of zealots put in power out of desperation. But it was on the other side of the world, so why would we care?

""Far to the East, two nations born of one's fraction stood wary. The Northern nation cut itself off from the world, amassing powerful arms and occasionally posturing on the world's stage. But they were so small and so far, so why would we care?

""North of them, in a land of frozen tundra and mountains, the scion of a fallen empire waited, plotting revenge for the failures of his forbears. His armies waged silent war, working in the shadows to destabilize the trust of the world's citizens in their own governments and systems. Brute force was always effective, but his tactics had evolved for the modern age. Of course, he was merely fuelling dissent that already existed, so why would we care?

""And through it all, the world was dying. Oh, it was happening slowly, for decades the repercussions of humanity's greed had been apparent. Air became toxic in cosmopolitan heartlands. Water became poison. Wildlife face mass extinction. Entire nations found themselves drowning in floods or burning in unholy fires like pyres to mankind's indifference. But this would only affect the future generations, so why would we care?

""Our great empire sat on the other side of the world. The prosperity following the Great Wars had ended up only in the hands of a select few. They hoarded it like dragons, accounting for every last doubloon, while their neighbours starved in the streets. Medicine and housing became prohibitively expensive. Even proper nutrition became a luxury. All the while we remained divided, willingly complacent in the greed of our overseers. They turned is against each other. 'Why should the addict receive medicine while a sick child dies?' some cried. 'Because we should ALL receive medicine!' others cried. 'The addict is not our enemy, the man putting a price on our survival is!'

""And that brings us to today. The world burns and floods. Mass exoduses from entire regions of the world stretch thin the resources of others. Children speak out against the forefathers who sold their futures. The horrors of the Great Wars had faded from memory, and some were eager turn the cyclical wheel of history once more.

""And it was too late to care.""

So yeah, our world is basically the prologue chapter of a fantasy novel."

ABoringDystopia,fecn5x3,t3_eoc1zk,1578978093.0,"This reminds me of a realization I had when we had to put down our last dog.

It came out of nowhere. In the morning, she was happily playing in the park. That night, her stomach twisted around and tore her spleen. No reason for it, just something that can randomly happen to deep-chested breeds. It was after hours, so we brought her to the emergency veterinary hospital. Overnight they managed to stabilize her with a few procedures, but the damage was done. They could try to keep her alive for a few more days, but it would cost over $20,000 to do so and she was definitely going to die anyway. We decided we didn't want to prolong her suffering any further, and put her down that morning (ironically it was on Family Day).

When all was said and done, the bill was almost $8000. We had no pet insurance, so we had to pay out of our savings and put the rest on credit cards that we're still paying off now.

After she was gone, I vividly remember walking to the car and thinking, ""Thank god we'll never have to go through this with a human. If any of my friends or family were to get sick or even pass away, at least nobody would be saddled with a thousand-dollar hospital bill."" Then I froze in my tracks and realized that's exactly what people go through in the US. All the pain I felt in that moment is what the American healthcare system does to so many people. I felt like I was going to be sick.

American neighbours, I don't know if you guys even realize how bad you actually have it. If you did, you'd all be trampling down the white house gates to string up your politicians in the streets. Any lawmaker that doesn't support universal healthcare in this day and age has no business calling themself a public servant."
