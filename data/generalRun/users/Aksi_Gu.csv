It's a self contained novel in the Discworld series that gives you a real taste of the overall Discworld vibe, while not requiring reading the earlier works.

It's also a really, really good book.

Pyramids or Guards! Guards! are my other 2 recommendations for newcomers to the disc. Pyramids gives a good flavour for the ""early"" discworld, while also being a self contained story. Guards! Guards! is the first book in one of the main story arcs of the discworld, and can be read on it's own without any other books.

Also Moving Pictures.

If you get ""in"" to the Discworld, you should really start at The Colour Of Magic and work your way forward from there. Every book published is in chronological order, events in one book may be referenced in another, and the whole world develops and unfolds. The first couple of books are definitely a little... different... from the rest of the discworld, but they introduce a lot of core ideas to the disc that are fleshed out through the 40 book series as PTerry finds his 'voice'

-that said- there are reading order guides for the various story arcs available, but some side jokes/comments/references may not land. E.g. Moving Pictures is a self contained novel, but without a better understanding of the evolution of the Unseen University from reading the Rincewind arc, some of the jokes/characters may not be fully understood without seeing the changes to the UU from earlier Rincewind novels.

For what it's worth ""Wyrd Sisters"" was my first novel."

You almost died because of those aetherial bastards, C'Thon is bleeding the world dry and forgotten gods are using the place as a playground. Humanity has been pushed to the brink of extinction... You're not just hunting the big bad down, you're ~~visiting the infidel with explanatory pamphlets~~ basically the manifestation of Cairn's Wrath at these essentially extraterrestrial invaders.

You're not being bossed around, you're being directed and guided on a path of extreme vengeance, a crusader from the very realm itself waging a one man war against...well...everything.

#CAIRN VULT!"
