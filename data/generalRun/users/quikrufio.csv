FoodPorn,fbbltfx,t1_fbbl6o0,1576703121.0,"I use https://www.averiecooks.com/softbatch-cream-cheese-chocolate-chip-cookies/ for the cookie part, used chocolate chunks and about 8 slices of bacon chopped up and fried. The maple glaze recipe I had didn‚Äôt turn out super well so I won‚Äôt share that. I‚Äôm sure there are better recipes online for it. Mine didn‚Äôt include maple extract which would have made it taste much better"
