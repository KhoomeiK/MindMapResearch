So, when the band has practice most of us parked out back and went in the back door, particularly because the front door was usually locked. The administration decided they didn't like us hoodlums parking out back and changed the rules so you can *only* park in your assigned spot and started threatening suspensions for parking there after hours.

We started parking on the grass because it was worded in such a way that implied the rule only cared as long as your were physically in the parking lot. The grass, technically, isn't part of the parking lot.

So, when the band has practice most of us parked out back and went in the back door, particularly because the front door was usually locked. The administration decided they didn't like us hoodlums parking out back and changed the rules so you can *only* park in your assigned spot and started threatening suspensions for parking there after hours.

We started parking on the grass because it was worded in such a way that implied the rule only cared as long as your were physically in the parking lot.
