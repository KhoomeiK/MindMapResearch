askscience,fe4fpz3,t1_fe2t881,1578858760.0,"Simpleton question here, Is all earthbound lead a product of uranium decay? Can we assume that at the start of the process of earth formation that the crust essentially had no lead? Does lead form in supernovae? Since it seems lead is in abundance, is the decay of uranium geologically fast and does it indicate that uranium was once a principle constituent element of crustal geology?"
AskReddit,fdihkt8,t1_fdhyiq7,1578443082.0,"Yep. I am a health care professional and I only reply to threads that i have some expertise in. Someone always seems to disagree with their google degree and all. Worst, someone will take that advice as gospel. If you don't know enough to comment, refrain from doing so. That is why the internet is simultaneously the best and worst place for advice. It can be hard to know the difference so take advice with a grain of salt."

IAmA,fdfoojm,t1_fdclgj0,1578366560.0,"The more I read you posts, the more ignorant you become. Clearly you have no idea of what you talk about as you want to peg physicians as greedy in an all consuming answer. 

Let me put it in simple terms: you have little insight of what you are talking about and the more you ramble about being right, the more I am convinced you are unable to comprehend why."
IAmA,fdfnwej,t1_fdcbsf7,1578366045.0,"Curious, do you practice in medicine in any way? I do, I can can say you are right in some levels and wrong on others. You rightly point out that greed underpins the industry, but for years physicians have lost the battle in fee for service. Doctors are rewarded well, but today they must fight harder for reimbursement while historically making less. The problem is the corporatization of health care....hospitals and insurance companies. There are a few outliers that get attention, but the rich doctor is a meme that is hardly true as it once was.

The other factor you are missing is the fact that there are no direct market forces that are factors in controlling costs. If you are having a heart attack, you do not have the luxury of shopping around. You can’t control costs when the end consumer has no voice in the process. 

There are many other factors that would take a book to delineate, and others have. The system is broken on so many levels......it is not just doctors salaries that are the problem."
IAmA,fdfkrme,t3_ekdnfg,1578363994.0,"Can you elaborate on the psychological profile of a medical professional that would commit such heinous acts? 
I am a nurse soon to be a family nurse practitioner, and I have never seen nor suspected any suspicious deaths in the 27 years I have practiced. I am curious as to what would motivate someone to end someone’s life when we are sworn to promote it."
Futurology,fd4hmcg,t1_fd2u4b1,1578167526.0,"Though to add to your argument from your point of view is that burning gasoline has a terrible efficiency as we waste a lot more of the energy density by simply cooling the engine,. What equivalent that has to be matched is the effective energy equivalent.....we don’t need to match the wasted thermal energy that we don’t recover."
Futurology,fd4gi8t,t1_fd2u4b1,1578167298.0,"But without an adequate infrastructure to charge your batteries, the lack of an equivalent time of gasoline refueling time, and a limited driving range will remain a daunting challenge for some time to come. For fully electric cars to replace gasoline, the technologies must significantly improve or electric cars will only be a novelty.

I will expect, however that this technology gap will be overcome eventually and gasoline fueled cars will be a thing of the past."
