AskMen,fdo6z7g,t3_em9w3x,1578599976.0,"Met her at the university. She drove me crazy just by her looks. She was like a flower, the girl I'd be proud to walk with. I asked her out, she said yes. She ended up boring. I lost interest from the first hour,since there was no connection. I kissed her, though. We went out once more, kissed, touched and ended up at her place. I had still lukewarm feelings but I wanted to see where it would go. She was just too beautiful. 

She was horny, but I just wouldn't function. I felt a wall between us, no chemistry. After she ended by my fingers (I saw it as a duty to at least make it worthwhile for her) I told her there was no chemistry, that she did nothing wrong, that we were just different. She complained a lot in a sweet, charming way because she liked me, but I wouldn't care. So after the chat, I politely left.

A year went by with us being a bit in touch cause we were in the same class and stuff. We learned each other better and I ended up liking her. Tried something again, but this time she rejected me. Then I fell into the pit. Nearly loved her. I still remember her 3 years after and fantasize things. God, I was such a douche..."

harrypotter,fd0hx36,t3_ejig1y,1578119054.0,"There are things that noble and virtuous men don't do just from fear. Him being coward isn't enough an excuse for what he did. He didn't stop to just betraying his friends. He lived 13 years with the Wesleys and cut his hand to revive Voldemort. Why didn't he choose to hide like many other death eaters did? He had the advantage of turning into a rat, he would never be found by anyone. But he prefered to turn into a rat in order to do harm! He was more loyal to Voldemort than many death eaters from Slytherin. I believe that he, while in the shadow of James and Sirius, didn't have an identity, neither could he find one. He also didn't have attention. He was jealous and insecure. Inflicting pain gives you the spotlight and being a part of a team gives you an identity. He found both in serving Voldemort. So yeah, the characterization ""sadistic minion"" suits him well."
AskMen,fcwnqkb,t3_ej3w7t,1578030930.0,"I goggled when I read this, cuz it's so to the point with how my life is these months. I'm not a successful porn-free guy, but I know how to do it. First step is to accept it's harmful. You said ""ruins your daily life"" so don't forget it! You mean it! Learn why is harmful from the internet and speak loudly the personal perspective of yours. Then, delete and throw everything porn-related. You've probably done that a dozen of times, right?

 The problem is when cravings hit your door and your imagination goes wild. ""What if I google this or that or what if that pornstar has a new video out?"" When these thoughts come, don't fight them. Pushups etc are a temporary solution that won't always work (try them though). You want to find a solid way of dealing with the cravings, even when you are alone in a dark room with your pc on. You have to let your thoughts be without entertaining or resisting them. It's called mindfulness. Breathe deep and slowly and observe their existence like they are another man's thoughts, like you can't act on them. You can't act on them and you are not threatened by them because they're not your thoughts. It's the inner addict and that's absolutely normal. Keep doing what you were doing until the cravings leave. 

The first couple of weeks are the most difficult, so I recommend that you keep yourself busy throughout the day. You might fall into a minor depression, but know it's part of the process, too. Especially on these bad days, make sure you go for a walk to clear your mind and get some air.

It is crucial that you work other domains of your life to the better. Porn overconsumption is the side effect. There are things in your routine that need to change. Don't get crazy, though! Relax and do a little thing each day that pushes you out of your comfort zone and the pit you're into. How you make it happen is up to you!

Lastly, find a partner and have sex if you can. Communicating is sooo nice and porn doesn't have that. Porn is too boring compared to that. After a long abstinence, watching porn will feel pretty boring in general, but don't try it lol. 

That's all, my friend, I hope you will make it!

P. S. : Internet family filters are garbage."

As far as the rest of my routine goes, I dislike it but can't change it. I live with my parents in the same room with my brother, I have no money to move and it's too damn noisy here all the time. Along with other reasons, it's a toxic environment. And I won't get my degree in the next two years, so routine is expected to stay as is for a long time.

I've been listening to parents and teachers my whole life under the impression that they know what they talk about, that what I am taught (whatever that may be) is useful and someday I will see the meaning of this. Today, I can understand that I know nothing, I am pretty insufficient (even if I have been a top student, passed to a good university which, 4 years after, I don't like but still exist there) and I've wasted a lot of energy to the point of not wanting to spend more energy at all. I feel that I'm on a road to misery and sadness, giving but not receiving. Neither uni or family help -kids obviously carry the sins of their parents. Also, I'm always tired, I got back pains and I can't focus. I have been excercising for 2-3 years but I see no real progress and my body hurts even if I do the exercises correctly (which I do).

How do you prevent it from messing with your expectations and how do you know it hasn't already? Things happen subconsciously. Porn is ok until it's proven wrong. If you have sex with a guy and think he is gross because you feel his breath, he has a natural body scent, he sweats, he doesn't have a six pack, he doesn't have an 8 inch dick and he can't fuck for half an hour straight without losing his erection, then porn is probably the problem."

AskMen,fbwwjzi,t3_eespic,1577161367.0,"Back in the day when I was strong enough to quit it for long periods of time, the first two weeks of no PMO were always difficult. Dick can't get hard, many porn cravings, mood swings, depression, brain fog. This is called flatline. 

But at the 14th day, morning wood would strike again, much confidence and energy, no brain fog, not thinking about sex all the time, getting hard just with a nice girl sitting next to me, appreciating little things on women apart from the ass and tits, no gay thoughts (was watching gay porn too), a bit bigger boner because the dick was fuller.

Then I'd start masturbating whenever my body asked to. That was much less times than with porn. Masturbation is fine, porn is the problem. 
I've done this vile circle a looot of times and it's always the same. Always 14 days of flatlining. The only con is that there are times when the cravings get too strong. But it's part of the game and resisting them is always better than going back to the dark hole of wasting your days to porn. So no actual cons."
