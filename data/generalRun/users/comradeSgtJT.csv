todayilearned,femv7hi,t1_femu0aj,1579270486.0,"*reactive criminal investigations tend to be dull.

Proactive criminal investigations often include much more ""entertaining"" or ""interesting"" police work. A fictionalized but accurate representation of this would be The Wire series set in the Baltimore drug trade."

maryland,fee1gva,t1_fee0v8n,1579024419.0,Spend more than 15 seconds looking. Just because it doesn't fit your narrative means it's wrong.
maryland,fedzup8,t1_fedxzq3,1579023375.0,"Yes, actually, I do. Fun fact, the federal government collects and tracks data from every municipality's police force regarding crime, arrests, et cetera. This program is called the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. It is easily found via a basic Google search.

Resisting arrest, while not its own category, falls under Disorderly Conduct. The numbers for 2018 show in the entire United States there were 10,310,960 arrests made for the year. There were only 329,152 arrests for disorderly conduct; even if every single one of these arrests were for Resisting Arrest (which they aren't), that would only account for 3.19 percent of all arrests.

Taking those statistics into account, it's very easy to see the commenters statement that ""a large portion of arrests"" include resisting arrest is a false and inaccurate statement.

maryland,feduzpw,t1_fedsdco,1579020466.0,"Your ""strong feeling"" is inaccurate; it's not your fault, you said it yourself, you haven't done the research. 

What goes to show the ""cop"" didn't try to calmly explain what was going on? Why is she a Saint simply because of her age? I hate to break it to you, but shitty people get old just like normal people get old.

I trust and believe I'll be downvoted into oblivion for my likely unpopular opinion, but none of us were there to know the facts, and thus our opinions on what actually occurred are unsubstantiated."

pics,fdivjv2,t1_fdhqlp5,1578452002.0,I didn't mean to suggest it was entirely attributable to chem warfare if that's how my comment came across. I think the PR angle you're looking for is the military strongly wants (and needs) uniformity.

pics,fdh95hk,t1_fdh27ar,1578418077.0,"It should be noted there's a big difference between oxygen masks (to provide oxygen) and chemical warfare masks (to keep out toxins). The military uses the latter, thus the ban on beards. You need a much better seal against the face to keep out toxins than you do to simply supply oxygen."
