news,fglpqc4,t1_fglcwkn,1580907530.0,"You paid 22% out of every dollar over $38,701 (and under $82,500).  Not every dollar you earned.

>Let’s say you’re a single filer with $32,000 in taxable income. That puts you in the 12% tax bracket in 2019. But do you pay 12% on all $32,000? No. Actually, you pay only 10% on the first $9,700; you pay 12% on the rest. (Look at the tax brackets above to see the breakout.)"
television,fgjwdku,t1_fgis4vk,1580852681.0,I still miss the old landing page that has all the day's most popular videos.
awfuleverything,fghkeyd,t1_fghbobq,1580786819.0,Very few families can afford to care about someone else's family on that level.  Literally.
nextfuckinglevel,fgh7z66,t1_fggt17d,1580778814.0,Do you have dogs?
Futurology,fgg6l1p,t1_fgfdqir,1580755348.0,"Try this on for size:

These people have been and are having more kids than we are.  A lot of these kids are going to cast their first vote in the coming presidential election."
Zoomies,fgf2thl,t3_ey0qgn,1580721329.0,"Put a leash on him.  Take him outside.  

Say ""Let's go home now"" and let the dog lead you."
todayilearned,fgf1jlm,t1_fgerfti,1580719407.0,"I'm my experience, people don't hire the disabled unless they are incentivized or tricked into doing so.  I tried to get into so many places but being honest about being disabled means you don't even get an interview.  Said fuck it, walked into a business and pretended it was all good.  Interviewed and hired on the spot.  A disabled employee is financial burden that will be shed at the first available and legal opportunity.  Yeah, I'm a little salty."
pitbulls,fgci2gb,t1_fgcb0r5,1580672822.0,Yes.  I've made peace with the fact that my home just smells like farts now.  It's a decent trade-off.
funny,fgc3gpo,t1_fg7j63a,1580668680.0,"Naw dude.  Drive a few hundred miles on 93, then switch to 87 and try to tell me there isn't a difference.  There is a *huge* difference.  Throttle response.  Torque.  Gas mileage.  You really notice the difference if you drive a manual because the lower the octane the more you'd have to give it to not stall out when disengaging the clutch."
gaming,fgbxh76,t1_fgbkpfz,1580667042.0,"Geometry Wars is awesome like this.  One stick you just point where you want to shoot, the other the direction you want to fly.  It's the perfect arcade game."
todayilearned,fgbp9m4,t1_fgbn2wg,1580664711.0,"Plus, you turn yourself into a walking talking allergen for weak ass bitches with bad genetics.   Not only will you not have to date them -- but also they die.  It's a win-win, really."
bettafish,fg90uvz,t1_fg8aneh,1580632873.0,Ours too.  I think it has a lot to do with the food they eat.
bettafish,fg90r5e,t3_exfmp5,1580632815.0,"We got one just like it and named her Perla.

She looks a lot different now."
