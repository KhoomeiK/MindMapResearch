UpliftingNews,ffkmpmf,t1_ffhk93w,1580025301.0,"The NIH distributes tens of billions in tax dollars every year, and the number goes up every year. In general, the grants might be enough to only fund basic research, but they don't give out equal amounts. Some sectors get as little as a few million, while others could get nearly half of the total awarded that year. In just 2019, $20.8 billion was awarded specifically for Clinical Research & Trials. That's more than just the ""basic research"" you're touting and completely dismissing what I said. You have just one small view of the machine there.

It got you invested in each individual contestant, and it actually felt like they were surviving in the wild on their own for the most part. I'd say the third season is when it became formulaic and less about surviving in the wild as it was about drama and the game show aspect. Then at that point every other network had to try and cash in on the success of Survivor and other reality TV shows that sprung up at the time. It became desirable to prioritize those kinds of shows because they were much cheaper to produce and people watched them regardless of quality for the most part."

MurderedByWords,ffbkrib,t1_ffbc326,1579770048.0,"Actually, here is what happened: The banks ensured that the law said they had to be bailed out. Obama had no choice but to allow it. What should have happened, and what Obama planned to have done until he was told couldn't happen, was the Fed took over the banks. It's what Iceland did and they're much better for it. The banks wouldn't have collapsed if the government took over and had direct oversight of how money was handled, but all those responsible would have at the very least been fired if they failed to get things back on track, if not outright arrested(just 1 unlucky bastard was arrested for being responsible for the '08 recession). There certainly would have not been CEOs & board members giving themselves bonuses & raises with bailout money in that scenario.

And the source of the recession was caused by CD investments. Basically, it was gambled that people would never not pay their mortgages. At least not on a large scale. So the value of CD accounts were artificially inflated based on mortgages that were being handed out like candy regardless of people's ability to pay them. That's why the recession went hand in hand with the collapse of the housing bubble. And the thing is, nothing changed. All the makings of a second Great Recession are still there because no real legislation was changed or passed in the wake of it all to prevent it from happening again."
MurderedByWords,ffbk6ei,t1_ffbcbss,1579769193.0,"That should have been done over a decade ago, but not a single piece of legislation was changed or introduced to prevent the same exact scenario from happening again. Including the laws that ensured the banks would not be held responsible, the federal government would be required to bail them out, and the banks could continue to invest in accounts whose value was dependent on people paying their mortgages (which, spoiler alert: the economy is terrible, homelessness is on the rise, and people struggle to pay their mortgages)."

politics,ffa7aoe,t1_ff9tl9x,1579729272.0,"I haven't been ""respectfully quiet"" to certain outspoken individuals and they just double down on the stupid & willful ignorance anyways.

The reality though, is that they're just a loud minority. People turned out to vote in droves in Nov 2018, and we elected a ton of Democrats and unseated a good number of Republicans. We just need to keep encouraging that throughout the primaries and this November, regardless of how the impeachment trial goes. Ask people if they're registered, if they're not 100% sure encourage them to find out & register if need be. If there are local positions up for election & they don't know who to vote for, then www.ballotready.com is a great resource. Make sure people know what dates to go vote, or direct them to submit an absentee ballot.

It's not doom & gloom yet. We can still fight this democratically, easily. (But I don't blame people for wanting to just leave the chaos behind either.)"
