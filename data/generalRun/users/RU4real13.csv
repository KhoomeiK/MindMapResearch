There could one other reason. In an old trapping book I had read about coyotes, the author stated something about the alpha predator not tolerating other predators. In his observations, wolves would attack coyotes not so much for prey, but because of competition for prey species like rabbits. Perhaps the yotes view the dogs as competition. Then again hungry yotes do kill fully mature deer during this time of year.

I feel for your loss, but unfortunately it's normal behavior for them. IMO, coyotes are way over populated. There's very few animals that can control their population, like wolves, cougars, or bears. Man can, but there's not as much incentive as there used to be to do so."

You definitely can. I have used both flouro and braid and had success. Braid is good when pulling the through heavy vegetation or helicoptering the lures down in the holes of the vegetation. Flouro is great when using double Colorado spinnerbaits post Spawn because the doubles cause the lure to lift but the flouro will help keep it from blowing out while reeling faster. Mono works best when working Indiana blades, burner blades, or slow rolling colo. blades when covering water.

Right now, with the season just starting, I've got mono with a double Colorado blades tied on. The fish are cold so I want to go as slow as possible yet keep the lure up in the water column. The water's going to be dirty so I want as much thump and flash that I can get.

Spinnerbaits are really in a category all of their own. You can do so much with them.

Red braided lines are supposed to disappear under water. White braid (sometimes blue greyish) is sold as ideal for top water usage. I like hi-viz because braid because I can see the strike no matter how lightly the fish bites on slack line. Braid to leader, to me, is the way to go. You get the plus of having a shock absorber to protect the hook. I have seen guys take a sharpie to darken out the first 6 ft of a hi-viz."

Then one day it started to go bonkers. I tried everything at first since finding a sub 5 gear reel to work this particularly deadly crankbait is about impossible. Finally, I decided the bearings were destroyed."
