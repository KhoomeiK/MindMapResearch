AskReddit,fflvoa7,t1_fflv4ch,1580044732.0,"Ok, but is everyone in the world a Bedouin Arab living in a food desert? I don't dispute that certain populations need to eat meat, e.g. Bedouin Arabs, Inuits, etc. But presumably you're not living in one of these populations?"
AskReddit,fflvihh,t1_ffluoqt,1580044657.0,"I know, hence I said push over instead of stab. 
I understand the argument, but just because something has always been done that doesn't make it right."
AskReddit,ffltz4p,t1_ffltn02,1580044185.0,"Any animal enjoys sport and play, just like children enjoy playing. It's the stabbing to death part that's not fun. A toddler won't respond holistically to taunts but that doesn't mean it would be ok to make them run at you and then shove them over."
AskReddit,fflsuen,t1_fflsf53,1580043760.0,So... You're saying it would make you feel good to be put in a crowded stadium where someone slowly stabs you to death for no reason? Idk if you're trying to be edgy or something but clearly that's not a thing most people would want.
AskReddit,fflrzn3,t1_fflrpsg,1580043316.0,"Haven't been tempted by veganism yet then? What's stopping you, would love to give you some tips if I can :)"
SmashBrosUltimate,fflrkxd,t1_fflpae1,1580043251.0,True. Petition it is.
AskReddit,fflrfci,t1_fflr2fl,1580043214.0,"I see your point, but if you have seen slaughterhouse footage then you would probably agree that the suffering experienced is pointless when it only results in a transient moment of good taste. We're in agreement that bullfighting is for assholes though for sure."
AskReddit,fflqvlv,t1_fflqr3s,1580042964.0,But both are just for enjoyment. Neither are necessary.
AskReddit,fflqn9q,t3_eu68zc,1580042858.0,"Some people I know have used the argument that if people eat animals then watching bullfighting is no worse, and it's hard to disagree with the logic as both amount to animal torture for pleasure."
SmashBrosUltimate,fflorop,t3_eu583d,1580042238.0,"Granted I've only been in the direct loop for the past 1/2, but what's wrong with the dub guy?"
SmashBrosUltimate,ffcm3a9,t1_ffcljr2,1579802350.0,"You're right, but just jumping in to say I think you may mean subjective :)"
SmashBrosUltimate,ff6vilf,t3_erxhdq,1579635741.0,Replace Scorpion or Dante with the knight from Hollow Knight and this is a DREAM.
SmashBrosUltimate,ff6v7jo,t1_ff6qwzt,1579635562.0,"I've seen people saying it would be cool if a trailer showed a fighter ""breaking free"" from being an assist trophy and becoming a full fledged fighter, could be quite comedic reveal too, like a fighter gets Waluigi from an assist trophy and then he turns on them or something, ""Waluigi breaks free""."
SmashBrosUltimate,ff6umwv,t1_ff6qrkt,1579635222.0,You really think they'd add Mario in this game? It's a long shot man.
creepygaming,ff5uler,t1_ff59c9u,1579610788.0,"Holy shit, one of the first games I remember fully playing and it was so scary oh my god."
DebateAVegan,ff3q5i0,t3_erhj0n,1579546456.0,"A plant based diet really is easy and practicable. I don't know who you're talking to who needs regular bloodwork or help from a nutritionist but it really isn't that hard to track what you eat and ensure you're getting the right vitamins. So many free resources nowadays to help and even track exact nutrients you eat.

Also, vegans don't actually have to supplement anything, B12 can easily be had from fortified foods, and is also a vitamin that a good amount of the omnivorous population is deficient in."
DebateAVegan,feqdq71,t1_feqbbzo,1579340568.0,"For you, who purchases both from rescues and breeders, the purchase of a puppy does prevent the rescue of an impounded dog yes. That's not an ethical attack or anything, just makes sense. Now that is a very interesting argument I hadn't thought about, puppies are much harder to come by in a rescue. Maybe educating the public more about how many animals really need help in shelters is the only solution."
DebateAVegan,feqax2e,t1_feqa96j,1579339581.0,"The way I see it, no matter where you buy from the sum total of dog left without an owner will remain the same. The difference being, if you buy from a rescue then you're not supporting a breeder, therefore reducing the chances of said breeder having another litter."
DebateAVegan,feq9kuo,t1_feq8d7a,1579339153.0,"It's unethical only when you consider the wider implications of buying from a breeder. Means more business for the breeder, breeder will breed more puppies, that means more dogs that could of been saved from a shelter are left their in favour of a pup."
happycowgifs,femgif5,t1_fem22gj,1579254323.0,"I'm assuming you yourself  have access to running water though, as you have access to a smartphone and Reddit. 
Also it's more economically sensible to eat a whole foods vegan diet than a meat based diet, I thought it would be expensive too but it's crazy how cheap grains, beans, legumes, veggies, and fruits really are. 
And it's not deniable that not eating meat is the morally correct thing to do if you're in a position to do it? I fail to see any argument that could justify taking a life IF you have no reason too (exceptions to this obviously do exist)."
smashbros,fejudci,t1_fejtcel,1579186058.0,"I'm not a huge fan of Dante either but come on, surely a fresh character from a different franchise would be better than another fire emblem sword fighter style character?"
smashbros,fejtxum,t1_fejth2v,1579185776.0,"I don't think so. Costumers were cuphead, Altair, Rabbids, and a couple of Megaman ones."
smashbros,fejtgja,t3_epjpn2,1579185442.0,"6 more fighters, hype!"
smashbros,fejtbul,t1_fejt72s,1579185349.0,God I wish Cuphead was the full character.
smashbros,fejt8g2,t1_fejsqwv,1579185281.0,"Cuphead, Rabbids, Altair and some megamen Mii costumes. Any of those would have been so much better as full character."
smashbros,fejt1yg,t1_fejsqwv,1579185156.0,Three minutes left.
smashbros,fejrvgd,t3_epjpn2,1579184308.0,"Not only is it another fire emblem character, looks like they barely play different from any other fire emblem character apart from the fact they have a little more range. So disappointing when all the other fighter pass adds have been third party with cool new effects and abilities. Big yawn."
SmashBrosUltimate,fejp0ud,t3_epibxj,1579182099.0,"I hope we get someone else for Fighter 5 and then an announcement of a first party character who will be leading the second pass, so Geno, Walugi, etc. Some real fan service."

NintendoSwitch,fehqzbn,t3_ep2t1g,1579122131.0,"I want this game so bad, love the style of gameplay and have played games like it before, but is it really worth £20? How's the replayability and length?"
SmashBrosUltimate,feg50a4,t3_eoxgqx,1579077196.0,"Just to mention, in the Twitter post you referenced from the DMC team I believe it says ""some extra features will be announced on these dates"" or something along those lines, I doubt that including Dante in Smash is a feature of the new games? Unless they've worded it like that to try and throw people off?"
SmashBrosUltimate,feg2jpi,t1_fef008d,1579074126.0,"Yep, didn't even think of that!"
SmashBrosUltimate,feeg24u,t1_feea6w1,1579033021.0,Krieg or Zero for sure would be cool.

DebateAVegan,fedttz1,t1_fedpjvp,1579019759.0,"Practicable and possible can't be applied to ""meat tastes good so that's why people eat it"". That's not a 'practicable' reason to eat it."

aww,fe5canp,t1_fe5bnog,1578867630.0,"Untrue, animal agriculture is one of or arguably the biggest contributor to climate change, not eating animal products is the best way to help reduce animal agriculture. On top of that, you're not contributing to more than 150 million animals being killed a day. If people believe that they can't do anything, nothing will change. Hopefully I can help persuade you to look into it a little more, because even one person won over means thousands of lives saved."
