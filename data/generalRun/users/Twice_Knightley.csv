Our prison system, like it or not, doesn't support death for even the most heinous crimes. Our system, though poorly designed and executed is built on the idea of rehabilitation and removal. The idea that someone is able to be rehabilitated is an important one for everyone in this system to hold. 

There will always be extreme outliers of people that cannot fit into the society that we have created, but these are VERY few individuals, and they still deserve the attention and help to make them better.

If they kill a child? Rape or no rape? 

If they accidentally kill a child? Rape them, but only on wednesdays? 

If they drink and drive? Bi monthly rape? 

When someone dings your car, but they don't have insurance - surely that is a good point to forcibly insert a penis into them?  

If they don't do the dishes when you ask them to? How much rape should they get as punishment?
