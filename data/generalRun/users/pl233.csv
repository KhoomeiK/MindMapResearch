I'm sorry I hurt your feelings and won't rewrite the scene for you, but I'm not a writer and it's not up to me to fix every piece of media I don't like. Do you like every song?

WetlanderHumor,ffx1fvk,t1_ffx0jhw,1580315698.0,"I don't think it needs to change much. It might even be doable with the dress color thing. It just felt like a pretty rough D&D ad lib, instead of a well-scripted moment. I think the scene deserved a great reveal, and this didn't feel like it to me. 

I can't write a better version, and it has been a while since I read the book so I don't remember enough to attempt it."
WetlanderHumor,ffwyxys,t1_ffwyc05,1580314143.0,"Gotcha. Are all the rest of you guys professional writers then, so your opinions matter?

Edit: if I improvise something in D&D, I know it's not good. Just because I'm bad at it doesn't mean I can't tell if someone else's improvisation is bad. I think all these downvotes are just because I dared to be critical. I like the series. It's not perfect. This is an example of something I think could have been improved."
WetlanderHumor,ffwwuyf,t1_ffwvjua,1580312834.0,"If I were a professional writer, I might have better suggestions. Not being able to rewrite the scene doesn't invalidate my criticism.

The scene as a whole is important and impactful. This little bit seemed ill-fitting to me. Apparently nobody else agrees, which is ok I guess. I had a hard time appreciating the scene because of how clumsy I felt this reveal was. It just reminds me of Liar Liar when Jim Carrey is trying to lie about what color a pen is."

A friend of mine was a cop in Portland and he would talk about seeing somebody driving around at night that he thought looks suspicious so he would follow them for a minute or two and inevitably they would break some law that would let him pull them over and see what was up. Sometimes you can't avoid it, like one example he gave was turning into a driveway that is less than 50 ft from where you last turned. You can't possibly turn your blinker on in time to give the minimum required distance for turning your blinker on, and that's enough of an obvious gray area that you probably won't actually get a ticket for it, but it gives the cop an excuse to pull you over anyway."

He stumbled across a book that seemed different than all the rest, and as he studied it he figured out how to cast a few spells. Certain that he wasn't supposed to have access to such a valuable book, and afraid that it would be taken from him before he could learn all of its secrets, he stole it from the library and ran off. It turns out that the Book of Shadows wasn't supposed to be in the library collection, and it shows up on its own from time to time to tempt whoever finds it into taking it. The Demogorgon, Prince of Demons, uses this book to trap mortals and drive them to madness while luring them in with promises of hidden knowledge and power. Tim thinks he's a wizard because he's learning magic from studying a book, but he's a conspiracy theorist warlock serving the amusement of his fiendish patron, bound by a Pact of the Tome, slowly going mad and imagining that he finds clues to hidden knowledge and power wherever he goes."
