The three language candidates increase the likelihood of it being a hoax.  It wouldn't be unheard of for a Renaissance-era scholar to have a familiarity with those scripts.  The early Renaissance would have been a prime time to sell mysterious ""ancient"" documents as well... the Renaissance is sort of the discovery of nostalgia, and many wealthy individuals were collecting antique works not only from the classical period, but other historical eras as well.  A patron hungry for something nobody else has could be presented with a convincing hoax, and the perpetrators disappear with the money long before the trick is revealed.

If I'd been in ""the world"" when the movie was popular, I'd have known something was up and been on guard for it.  Because I was isolated on a deployment (and the internet wasn't the huge factor it is now), the movie was able to legitimately surprise me."

thatHappened,fdmd8j0,t1_fdmchr0,1578546168.0,"That's not ""legal,"" it's just how things work.  Nobody is going to arrest or prosecute a person in that situation.  But, if you want to adhere to the letter of the law, bodyslamming someone who grabbed your ass is at a minimum simple assault, and if the person breaks a bone or acquires other serious injuries, it rises to a felony.  That's ""legal.""

That's not even getting into civil liability.  If your employee injures someone, even in self-defense, you could spend a lot of money in legal fees getting out of that.

Here's the trick with legality.  Even the system behaves in an ""illegal"" manner sometimes.  For example, a cop pulls you over for swerving and sees that you've spilled hot coffee all over yourself, and lets you go.  He just ""broke the law"" by failing to cite you.  Of course no one is going to charge someone who retaliated against an attacker.  But, that law has to be in place, because the law cannot engage in determining the acceptable degree of retaliation.  It can't be codified, there are too many variables.  That makes the law ""unknowable"" and arbitrary depending on what prosecutor/judge/jury combo you get.  It would be ""bad law."""
