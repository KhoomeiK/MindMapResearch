Look for positions that interest you. Be optimistic about the future and consider the great adventure ahead of you. If you obtain a job and you find it isn’t for you, look for another one. Stop trying to control the future. Focus on today. Be grateful for life now. Whether you paint tomorrow as dark and gloomy or filled with newness and adventure, you get to choose. So why on earth wouldn’t you want to choose to see things in a positive way? Good luck. Remember, love yourself and appreciate what you have and you will be fine. Be gentle with yourself. You’ll be ok."

selfhelp,fdotk33,t3_emat2x,1578612554.0,"First of all, you say you don’t have an addiction problem but then go on to describe addiction. You need to get real about your addiction before you will make any progress. What do you think a person addicted to alcohol does that you haven’t done? I’m not trying to put you down, but the first step in fixing things is to not deny what’s going on. You need serious counseling to help you stop your self destructive behaviors. I am an advanced addictions counselor. Please get help. You want a better life for yourself, and you can have it. I wish you well."

selfimprovement,fd60g8h,t3_ejzr7d,1578183812.0,"Well, you are pretty hard on yourself, but what I see is someone who knows they need to make changes and really wants to. That is a very unique combination, and powerful. You might consider counseling to help you make new choices, new plans, and begin new behaviors. I could also recommend a book, “The Great Love Story of Your Life: Learning To Love Yourself And Others And Find Purpose”, by Pat McConnaughey. Probably on Amazon. It’s main focus is, you guessed it, Love. Something we always have with us, inside, if we clear away the debris, the crap. I wish you the best."
selfimprovement,fd5wpk4,t3_ek1k00,1578182454.0,"Check out “The Great Love Story of Your Life: Learning To Love Yourself And Others And Find Purpose”, by Pat McConnaughey.

selfimprovement,fd5vddk,t3_ek3s14,1578181963.0,Sounds interesting.
selfimprovement,fd5ufu9,t3_ek49e0,1578181637.0,"You sound very committed. Without knowing your financial details, I suggest you develop a clear plan as to how you will pay the debt down. You sound like you have a strategy already, but what works for many people is to pay on all your obligations but focus on a smaller one where possible. When it’s paid off, put that payment money on the next small bill. As bills get paid off, redirect the freed-up payment money to other ones. This takes discipline, but you seem determined and you can keep focused on that time in 2021 when your debts will be paid Down. In the meantime, look for pastimes that don’t cost a lot of money. And remind yourself that the sacrifices are only temporary in the scheme of things. Remember that many people do just fine without the hobbies you love. I  have the unusual credentials of being both a CPA with an MBA as well as a professional therapist. Delayed gratification is the thing. Concentrate on the positive things about it all. Don’t focus on how horrible the sacrifice might seem. I respect your being so responsible and forward thinking."
selfimprovement,fd5rqxe,t3_ejyc27,1578180752.0,"Good for you! I might recommend two books that may speak to your needs at this point: one is “Shortcut Through Therapy” by Richard Carlson, and “The Great Love Story of Your Life: Learning To Love yourself And Others, And Find Purpose”, by Pat McConnaughey. You can get them both on Amazon or probably EBay. I hope 2020 is a great year for you."
