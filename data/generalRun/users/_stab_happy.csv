I'm 6 years into to therapy, and that, combined with this sub, has helped me make the most progress.  It's quite the stark contrast looking back to the person I used to be compared to who I am now.

I know I need to get better at exercising.  I'm more of a hiker than a runner.  But maybe I can trick my brain into running to get into shape for hiking this summer."
raisedbynarcissists,fekxw4s,t1_feks1wb,1579209873.0,"I have been in therapy, and it's been great for helping me learn how to re-parent myself and ""take my power back"" so to speak.  But ""feeling safe"" just seems to be a much broader concept that I'm clueless how to correct.

Thank you for the suggestion for EMDR.  I've heard of it but haven't tried it.  I will speak with my therapist tonight to see if she knows anyone who specializes in it."
depression,fekkc6d,t3_ephb69,1579201850.0,"I wouldn't consider what you're experiencing to be laziness.  I think that's a term you're getting caught up on and feeling bad about.  With depression, it's more like learned helplessness where you feel like you will be depressed whether you do something or not.  Your brain and body are tired and need a break.  Give them that break, heal, and try not to judge yourself about what you're going through."
raisedbynarcissists,fdfbwef,t3_el2z9d,1578358049.0,"It took me a long time to ""find myself"". I started out by asking myself this question when I was making a choice ""Is this something I genuinely want for myself? Or is this something I feel like I should want?""  If it was something I felt like I should want or was only considering because I was programmed to think that way, then I would choose something different. 

I applied this to clothes shopping to better develop my own sense of style. I applied it to college and career choices so I wasn't just doing what they wanted for me. I even applied this to food choices! Growing up, all we ever ate was meat and potatoes, and my mom would always say how ethnic food smells like garbage and criticize the ethnicities of the people cooking the good. When I grew up, I tried it, and it turns out, I really love ethnic food!

When it came to worrying about what other people think, it was a little bit harder. I came out of my shell slowly to people and when I kept noticing that they didn't freak out or rage hate on things I liked, I started to feel more comfortable opening up, but it still look a long time. It was so weird the first few times I shared my interests with coworkers and they didn't tell me what a terrible person I am or how stupid of a thing that is to like. 

It takes time, but with effort, you can deprogram yourself from thinking how they want you to think and feel more comfortable in your own skin. You are taking a huge first step by recognizing it and addressing it!"
AskReddit,fda173g,t1_fd964rv,1578240497.0,"This sounds like my kitty and the refrigerator. For the last few years, she will sit in the corner by the fridge and paw between it and the wall or sad meow cry. I have moved the fridge at least three times thinking she lost a toy back there, but there's no toy. She still thinks there is a toy back there."
depression,fcrp8qg,t3_eihb2v,1577904778.0,I wish this were a thing. Why should I live when happy people who enjoy life are dying? I'd give my life in an instant so they could enjoy life longer.
depression,fcroxoa,t3_eieavt,1577904660.0,I have not left my bed today. It's been that bad of a day.
AskReddit,fckqqi7,t1_fcke8h6,1577731147.0,"Uhhhh, this was my ex. I was having bad anxiety about something, and he kept telling me to stuff my feelings down because that's what he does, and it really helps him! Umm, dude, that is literally the worst thing you could do....."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fckinl1,t3_ehcy88,1577726168.0,"I'm struggling with something similar.  5 years together, and I always felt like he was a little childish, and there were things that would really annoy me.  But somehow I had convinced myself that he was the one.  That was until I told a psychiatrist what was going on, and she informed me that he was emotionally abusing me.  I broke it off shortly thereafter.

It's been a long few months since of crying, self-loathing, regret, etc.  I agree with the person who suggested blocking him.  That's what I had to do to my ex.  I deleted all of the pics and posts together.  Everything.  It was too painful just seeing his face or name anywhere.

Healing from a bad relationship/breakup is not linear.  You may feel ok or even good some days and then terrible the next.  Realize that at some point down the road you will look back and realized that you are doing better.  It may just not be evident to you as you go."
depression,fcglz2i,t3_eh4qc4,1577641567.0,"Therapists are trained to NOT tell you what to do. They are trained to provide you truths and evidence and gently guide you to your own realizations.  It's likely that he was reminding you that the choice is yours.  When he asked why not, he probably wanted you to discover your own reasons for staying alive and went in to dissuade you from going through with it."
raisedbynarcissists,fc4duqs,t3_eg0qho,1577413804.0,"Therapy might not be as expensive as you think. Many therapists will work on a sliding scale where you pay a rate based on your income. I suggest looking for a therapist who specializes in trauma and abuse. They will be best suited to understand your situation. 

There might also be free support groups that you could join. ACOA, which typically is for adult children of alcoholics, will often allow abuse victims to join as well.  

I've read several books that have helped me understand myself and situation better. Here are a few that come to mind :
- Dysfunction Interrupted by Audrey Sherman
- Childhood Disrupted by Donna Jackson Nakazawa
- The Emotionally Absent Mother by Jasmin Lee Cori

I also watch a lot of mental health videos on YouTube. Two of my favorite channels:
- Kati Morton - She's a real life therapist and posts a TON of videos on a large variety of mental health topics. She's amazing! 
- Julia Christina Counselling - Another real life therapist. I don't like her as much as Kati, but she's still really good.

It will be a long and hard journey to recovery, but as long as you put in the effort, you should start seeing results. If you need someone to chat with, feel free to PM me."
