memes,fehhcja,t1_feheww5,1579116550.0,"Wow relax, person! I wasn't hating! I was pointing out that, for me, it's a weird behavior and I thought it would be funny to formulate an hypothetical conspiracy about aliens disguised as humans, due to the weird nature of it. You know... for comedic purposes! Jeez!"
videos,fehd736,t3_ep3oav,1579114133.0,"""The city"" lets them do that?... Bitch, the citizens are the city!"
dankmemes,fehcrzj,t3_ep167t,1579113891.0,Mods are aliens trying to control our internet actions. They are also gay.
memes,fehcc65,t3_ep1qqx,1579113637.0,Feet people are aliens poorly trying to act as humans.
facepalm,fehb765,t1_feha51q,1579112959.0,"Hey! Your middle school childhood just called, it says it wants it's lame sarcasm back. I wasn't trying to ""debunk"" anything, I was trying to point out that your extreme concerns and worries are ill-founded by the saturation of fake news and media's constant push of a ""the-world-is-going-to-end-soon-unless-you-do-what-we-tell-you-to-do"" agenda. But, hey! What do I know? Keep patting yourself on the back for being a good person and feeling concerned about the world everyday, while the people running the governments, who can actually do something, do nothing about anything and keep guilt tripping you into submission."
facepalm,feh9gf3,t1_feh8vh2,1579111913.0,"Lol, have you even talked to a single scientists about it? Please tell me more about how you listen to what scientists have to say, maybe you are attending a scientists annual dinner where you talk directly to them right?"
facepalm,feh7n62,t1_fegb01g,1579110836.0,"Lol so not true, you are juts being bombarded by media to believe it is."
TrueFMK,fef0ueg,t1_fee4r1w,1579045533.0,lol what kind of bullshit is this? Do I look like a fucking robot?

wholesomememes,fee4hwg,t3_eoknzh,1579026219.0,Do all redditors wear those ugly beanie hats?
memes,feb70li,t1_feakc70,1578956001.0,"That's ok. I get what you are saying. The question is, why do you want to own a house? Could it be because that's what you've been told you ought to do?"
memes,fea1ekd,t1_fe9zyaa,1578943330.0,What I hate is the normalization of productivity as a positive concept to justify corporate exploitation that guilt drives individuals who just want to live THEIR life in their own terms.
memes,fe9yw8d,t1_fe9v65h,1578942644.0,"You can always get subjective with words, just don't expect everybody to agree with your interpretations. The fact is, those things you mention do no contribute to productivity in the corporate terms, and I would like them to stay as personal interests rather turning them into "" P R O D U C T I V I T Y H A C K S "" that corporations allow their workers to do so they can keep happy wit their miserable work."
marvelcomics,fe9xtw8,t3_eo7dza,1578942396.0,"It looks... odd. Don't know why, there's just something I don't quite like about this. It feels like a movie from the year 2000."
memes,fe9u8m2,t1_fe9nq5u,1578941476.0,"It is not subjective if you consider its etymology and origins, you are the one who's willing to adhere ""positive"" subjective meanings to a word, not me. ""Productivity: the quality, state, or fact of being able to generate, create, enhance, or bring forth goods and services"". "" P R O D U C E """
memes,fe9mrnr,t1_fe8k7ib,1578939496.0,"No it doesn't, unless you think doing what you want instead of what others expect you to do is a bad thing."
memes,fe9lpw2,t1_fe9k7yb,1578939221.0,"I wouldn't consider those as being productive, because you are not producing, you are just doing whatever you want for your own personal reasons. I refuse to use that adjective for non job related purposes."
memes,fe9jv6b,t1_fe9hqwt,1578938413.0,"That is entirely correct. And that's why I've never given a fuck about any of the corporations I've worked for. Guess I should find a better lifestyle, cause this one it's getting really boring, but, hey, that's the way I was raised to live by "" S O C I E T Y ""."
memes,fe8kgl6,t3_eo3che,1578927162.0,"And that's why I'll never stop procrastinating. Don't let the world tell you you have to be "" M  O R E   P R O D U C T I V E "". It's a scam."

dankmemes,fbvhep7,t3_eel8b9,1577130834.0,"Reddit is NOT a place for free thinkers. Reddit is a place for lame losers without a life outside the internet who think of themselves as gatekeepers of what ""free & critical thinking"" means. If you are a subreddit mod, you are basically an imbecile with grandiose delusions and absolutely EVERYBODY feels sorry for you and your pathetic life (except, obviously, other mods)."
