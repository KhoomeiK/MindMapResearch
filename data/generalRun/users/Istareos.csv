bulletjournal,fgsvqvh,t1_fgqz3dc,1581093658.0,That might be part of the issue too. I have dot-grid paper so it might not be as small of a grid

GetMotivated,fgqy27h,t3_ezy376,1581033923.0,"I really needed to see this... I just changed my major, junior year of college. Now I’m going to be graduating at 25 if everything goes to plan. I was so self conscious but now I realize I don’t need to be. Everyone is at their own place in life, and I just needed a bit more time to find mine."

mildlyinteresting,ffzy96h,t1_ffzxwyp,1580395945.0,"Ok? Some people might not have. And yeah this account is probably some karma whoring bot or something, but c’mon. A year later repost. I understand getting upset if something is reposted like a week later or some shit but it’s been a year."

toastme,ffrc9x9,t3_eunme7,1580155079.0,I’m honestly so grateful that you posted this because I’m technically a junior in college but I have 3 more years bc I waited too long to change my major. This isn’t a typical toast but thank you for posting about your “bad years” bc it’s honestly giving me motivation to keep keeping on.
