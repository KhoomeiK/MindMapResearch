It seems like people so often are hypercritical of widow(er)s. If you do X too soon, you're disrespecting or forgetting the dead spouse. If you don't do X soon enough, you're wallowing in grief unhealthily. It's a no-win situation in addition to the horrible circumstance of losing a spouse.

I have sensory sensitivities, most likely due to my high-functioning autism. I have sensitivities to light (minor), sound (moderate to severe), and smell (moderate to severe). I have misophonia, which is a strongly negative reaction to many ordinary sounds (think of the way most people feel when hearing nails on a chalkboard; I have that reaction to many very common, everyday noises).

There's no clinically described syndrome that I've come across, but I also have what I would describe as misophonia but with smells. I have strong, visceral, unpleasant, uncontrollable reactions to normal smells. They don't have to be strong; my sense of smell is heightened. The most ordinary scents - fragranced hand soap, someone's lunch salad, the cardboard boxes that were just delivered at work, someone putting on lotion two offices down, the deli counter or meat department at the grocery store - cause a panic-like reaction. Strong smells are torture. People who wear perfume are absolute hell. Driving behind diesel vehicles has made me vomit.

I wear headphones everywhere I go to help with my sound sensitivity, and sunglasses when outside to help with the light. There is nothing I know of that can help with my smell sensitivity.

My weird idea is for little filters that sit up inside the nostrils a bit and filter out smells. That clearly poses some challenges, but you get the idea. Individual smell-cancelling technology would change my life."

disability,few6qha,t3_eqm008,1579406089.0,"From your post it sounds like you're on the autism spectrum, I also have autism and would describe myself as 2E (I've never heard that before but it does apply to me). I can relate to a lot of what you said regarding the frustration of stagnating at school. I was a pretty laid back kid, and my teachers would either give me more challenging work or let me read in class, so I never felt stagnated. I'm sorry you did. What a waste of so many years for you.

One thing I struggle with is reacting to things I don't see frequently. For example, I have the misfortune to have always lived in areas that are overwhelmingly white. (I'm white myself.) It's pretty uncommon to see a black person where I live, so it always catches my eye and I have to force myself to not look inappropriately. If I lived in a place with lots of black people, I'd get over that in a week, max.

Sometimes, physically disabled people catch my eye for the same reason - I just don't see that many. I believe our human brains are wired to pay attention to the unusual. It makes sense to me, at least. And it's even more the case for me because I have hypervigilance related to PTSD. The solution is to seek out the thing that catches your attention too much - for me, I might watch media that features a variety of disabled people and people of color. Then they'll blend in to the crowd for me as just another person.

It's all about normalizing the normal that you aren't exposed to every day. When I find troubling thought processes or behaviors in myself, I usually seek out whatever caused it so that I can learn and be better.

Good luck, friend."

Your outfits are all extremely professional, conservative even, and the only workplace they'd be ""inappropriate"" for is a construction site, but for different reasons. Low-cut tops can be potentially inappropriate. Tops that simply fail to completely camouflage the fact that your breasts exist... yeah, not inappropriate.

Your boss has some issues. Your breasts are what they damn well are. You are NOT required to wear muumuus to satisfy her messed up Victorian stuffiness. Seriously, take these pictures to HR or your boss's boss and tell them what's up. Do what you can to get a different supervisor if at all possible. If not, well, I'd keep an eye out for other jobs (because we all know how a shitty supervisor can make your life hell on the sly). It's not fair, but that's life. In the meantime, wear your usual stuff, take a picture EVERY DAY, and document everything with your boss, from snotty looks to verbal warnings.

Dogtraining,fepgkvk,t1_fenvi4d,1579319961.0,"I'm not a service dog expert by any stretch of the imagination, and I haven't been fortunate enough to have my own service dog, but I am disabled and have PTSD. My understanding is that a PTSD service dog can actually work in a different way to what most people are used to. In particular, they can be trained to protect the personal space of their handler. That involves literally getting in between the handler and other people so they can't get too close. They can also be trained to bark or physically get their handler's attention if they notice their handler showing problematic signs of a flashback or aggression. I can see how those things could be misconstrued.

I'm not saying anything about this particular case, just pointing out that a PTSD dog operates a little differently from a seizure dog or celiac dog or seeing eye dog or whatever."
AmItheAsshole,fenpvdl,t3_eq24av,1579289149.0,"I'm going to say ESH. Your sister was definitely being a jerk, and calling her out was the right thing to do, but the way you did it was really asshole-ish.

It sounds like your sister might have some body dysmorphia issues. That's a medical condition, and it's commonly the case when someone has had so many cosmetic procedures, especially at such a young age. I'd recommend reading about it. My point is, your sister likely has some deep-seated self-esteem issues, and her appearance/procedures need to be 100% off-limits unless she brings them up.

Now, I'm NOT saying it's okay for your sister to criticize others' looks like that. It's 100% not okay. But there is a more productive, more mature way to address it: by calmly asking her to stop and then leaving if she doesn't. That's a way of setting a boundary that you won't tolerate certain behavior from her. It can result in fireworks at first, as the person tests whether you're serious, but as long as you stay consistent it will have one of two results: your sister will stop saying things like that around you, or you won't be around her to hear it. For you, that's a win-win. It also communicates that your sister's behavior is not acceptable without you ever having to argue with her about it. Your sister knows what she's saying is shitty. You don't need to explain it to her like she's six years old. Just say, ""please don't say things like that when I'm around or I'll have to leave."" If she argues, CALMLY get up and leave - it's super important to not engage with her, be dramatic, show anger, etc. or you've missed the point.

I think you owe your sister an apology for bringing up her procedures. But after you've done that, in the future you can calmly set your boundary and go from there."

Human emotions are complicated, and usually we feel how we feel without much ability to control it. Part of emotional maturity is accepting that fact while not letting your emotions dominate your actions.

You did a really nice job of accepting how you felt, and had a very private ceremony to acknowledge and affirm your feelings and situation. There's nothing wrong with the way you feel or how you behaved. You went out of your way to be discreet about it. Unfortunately your sister lives in the same house and knows your habits; that's the only reason she picked up on it. You couldn't really have done more to avoid it.

I think your sister will get over it. She's especially sensitive because she has a personal connection to the boy who died, being his sister's best friend. She's probably feeling a sense of loyalty on behalf of her friend. In a few months, when the intense emotions have faded a bit, you might decide to talk to your sister about this again. Or you might not - it just depends on your sister and whether she possesses the emotional intelligence to understand your situation. If not, it's probably just best to let it lie. She's experiencing a whirlwind of events and feelings, and it's likely this event will fade into the chaos of the memories of this time for her and not particularly stand out.

I can relate to your situation. I was bullied horribly by my brother (1 year and 9 months older) until he hit his mid-teens. He also sexually abused me for several years, but honestly, the bullying was worse and affected me more. He developed severe addiction problems and committed suicide when he was 21 and I was 19. I was both devastated and relieved. I felt relief he was dead both for my sake and for his, since he wasn't suffering any longer. I loved him deeply and hated him at the same time; I don't quite have words to explain it.

I spent many years criticizing myself for feeling relief/happiness/whatever at his death, until I realized and accepted that it was completely natural for me to feel that way. It didn't make me a monster or psychopath or anything. I don't talk about those feelings with my parents or other siblings because it would hurt them; otherwise, I have completely let myself off the hook for being glad my brother is dead.

I think you should do the same. Death is incredibly complicated and fraught, emotionally, and often we feel unexpected and socially ""unacceptable"" things. If I were in your shoes, I'd feel the same way as you. I admire your restraint and discretion; I'm not sure I could have handled it quite so maturely at 17."

He'd hold it for over a day until he couldn't anymore and then he'd go on the bathroom rug or something, clearly not wanting to but just in a state of shock at the weather. That happened maybe a couple of dozen times that first winter.

Despite my despair I was patient with him, and every single time he went out and pottied, no matter what the weather, I made a huge deal when he came back in - enthusiastic praise and treats. By the second winter, he wasn't messing inside anymore. A few times he only went out once a day, but at least he went. Now, he reliably goes out morning and evening, no matter the weather. When it's especially coldnor snowing he might need a little encouraging, in the form of me walking a few steps outside and calling him, but then he'll come out and go do his stuff every time.

He's equally finicky about other things - when he'll eat, and other dogs. I've come to understand him, and I accept that he's a sensitive guy. He's not the fastest learner, but once he's got something down, he's 100% consistent.

My approach is to push his comfort zone a bit, but also to respect what he tells me about being uncomfortable.

For example, I take him to play group with our younger corgi. He is really excited to go, but he'll just stand there next to me and bark at the other dogs and get snippy if they try to interact with him. He wants to go to the group, but he only wants to watch. He really leans on his extraverted Corgi sister to be secure and comfortable in such situations. But even though he won't play with the other dogs, in two years he's gone from being a quivering, shaking, whining mess of anxiety to being relatively confident and excited for play group. He just participates on his terms. Any time he leaves my side for a bit, or lets another dog approach him without a lip lift or growl, I praise him and usually he gets a treat. Exposure and encouragement have helped multitudes. But they've helped very slowly.

Your pup sounds like she needs an extra helping of sensitivity and patience, in all areas. You sound like you're doing a fabulous job at that. Trust in you will really allow her to face and overcome other fears and challenges as she progresses. She'll always be who she is - personality is hardwired to a large extent, in my opinion - but I think she'll improve by leaps and bounds as she bonds with you more deeply and relies on you. I also think having a well-adjusted doggo sibling will help a ton, as it has with my guy. He's much more at ease by his sister's side than on his own.

Bless you for adopting a pupper who needs extra time, patience, and love. And good luck!"
childfree,fdh7ts2,t1_fdh2vks,1578417251.0,"I'm sorry for what you went through.

I'm someone who didn't have kids because of my mental illness and knowing I'd be a shit mom, and also because I didn't particularly want them.

I absolutely agree that some people with mental illness shouldn't have kids. It sounds like your mom was one of them. You were the victim there and what you endured was horrible. No child should experience that.

Where I'm differing from OP is in the statement that NO ONE with mental illness of any kind should have children. Mental illness is incredibly varied, and many people are able to manage it quite well.

According to NAMI, in the US, 1 in 5 adults experiences mental illness in any year, and 1 in 25 adults experiences severe mental illness. I'm in the latter category. I would agree that people with severe mental illness should not have children. I don't believe that any person with any mental illness shouldn't have children.

There was a time in our country when people with any kind of mental illness were frequently sterilized involuntarily, along with people of color, people who had a criminal history, and others. A blanket statement that no one with mental illness should have kids is exactly the sort of attitude that caused our country's despicable eugenicist history."

I'm a put off by the phrasing, ""here's what college is like for students with disabilities,"" especially from someone who intends to be an advocate for the disabled. It implies a singularity that disabled people are constantly fighting against. We're not a homogeneous mass who all have the same opinions and experiences. Thinking in that way contributes to the sense of ""other"" that leads to so much stigma and discrimination.

I'm much less disabled than Ms. Girma by any objective measure, but I'm less functional in many ways. My disabilities are primarily mental rather than physical. I am blessed with high intelligence and a gift for academic pursuits, but it still took me 13 years to get my undergraduate degree. I recognize the privilege and good fortune I had to get my degree at all.

Many disabled students do not find unquestioning and unending support from their schools' accommodation offices. It depends on the school, and on the student. In my personal experience, schools often don't feel as compelled to support students with non-physical disabilities. I was very lucky to have the support and understanding of my two successive academic advisors, who each advocated for me when I was unable to do so myself, and helped me find ways to muddle through. Without them, I would not have graduated. I also have a very supportive family, in terms of relationships though not finances as they live near the poverty level, again without whom I would not have graduated. I have many, many advantages that allowed me to eventually graduate.

Many disabled students never have the support they need to even consider attending college. Many disabled students lack institutional support when they do manage to matriculate, and are not able to finish their studies. Many students fall under the radar, expected to just suck it up, because they look normal and healthy. The range of experiences is as broad as the number of disabled people.

The author of this article is a unique young woman, and she has achieved amazing things, but I would argue that her experience is actually not much like the experiences of other disabled students who aren't of the caliber to attract nationwide media attention, meet the President, and be accepted to a school like Harvard Law."
progressive,fd75fmt,t3_ejvisz,1578199665.0,"I'm in my 30s and on SSDI for disability. There's a reason why my husband and I pay about $250/month to keep me on his insurance, even though I have Medicare: with only one insurance, my out-of-pocket costs would bankrupt me in a year. So I'm double-covered. It's an absolute necessity for me.

Note that for some insane reason that I do not understand, a person can't have double prescription coverage with Medicare and another plan. This one hurts, as my prescriptions cost us several hundred a month even with my husband's ""very good"" government employee insurance. I don't have Medicare prescription coverage because I'm not eligible if I have prescription coverage through my husband and I automatically do by being on his medical. I'd rather have Medicare prescription coverage (part D), since it covers much better, but I can't.

I have sensory sensitivities, most likely due to my high-functioning autism. I have sensitivities to light (minor), sound (moderate to severe), and smell (moderate to severe). I have misophonia, which is a strongly negative reaction to many ordinary sounds (think of the way most people feel when hearing nails on a chalkboard; I have that reaction to many very common, everyday noises).

There's no clinically described syndrome that I've come across, but I also have what I would describe as misophonia but with smells. I have strong, visceral, unpleasant, uncontrollable reactions to normal smells. They don't have to be strong; my sense of smell is heightened. The most ordinary scents - fragranced hand soap, someone's lunch salad, the cardboard boxes that were just delivered at work, someone putting on lotion two offices down, the deli counter or meat department at the grocery store - cause a panic-like reaction. Strong smells are torture. People who wear perfume are absolute hell. Driving behind diesel vehicles has made me vomit.

I wear headphones everywhere I go to help with my sound sensitivity, and sunglasses when outside to help with the light. There is nothing I know of that can help with my smell sensitivity.

My weird idea is for little filters that sit up inside the nostrils a bit and filter out smells. That clearly poses some challenges, but you get the idea. Individual smell-cancelling technology would change my life."

I can relate to a lot of what you said regarding the frustration of stagnating at school. I was a pretty laid back kid, and my teachers would either give me more challenging work or let me read in class, so I never felt stagnated. I'm sorry you did. What a waste of so many years for you.

One thing I struggle with is reacting to things I don't see frequently. For example, I have the misfortune to have always lived in areas that are overwhelmingly white. (I'm white myself.) It's pretty uncommon to see a black person where I live, so it always catches my eye and I have to force myself to not look inappropriately. If I lived in a place with lots of black people, I'd get over that in a week, max.

Sometimes, physically disabled people catch my eye for the same reason - I just don't see that many. I believe our human brains are wired to pay attention to the unusual. It makes sense to me, at least. And it's even more the case for me because I have hypervigilance related to PTSD. The solution is to seek out the thing that catches your attention too much - for me, I might watch media that features a variety of disabled people and people of color. Then they'll blend in to the crowd for me as just another person.

It's all about normalizing the normal that you aren't exposed to every day. When I find troubling thought processes or behaviors in myself, I usually seek out whatever caused it so that I can learn and be better.

It sounds like your sister might have some body dysmorphia issues. That's a medical condition, and it's commonly the case when someone has had so many cosmetic procedures, especially at such a young age. I'd recommend reading about it. My point is, your sister likely has some deep-seated self-esteem issues, and her appearance/procedures need to be 100% off-limits unless she brings them up.

Now, I'm NOT saying it's okay for your sister to criticize others' looks like that. It's 100% not okay. But there is a more productive, more mature way to address it: by calmly asking her to stop and then leaving if she doesn't. That's a way of setting a boundary that you won't tolerate certain behavior from her. It can result in fireworks at first, as the person tests whether you're serious, but as long as you stay consistent it will have one of two results: your sister will stop saying things like that around you, or you won't be around her to hear it. For you, that's a win-win. It also communicates that your sister's behavior is not acceptable without you ever having to argue with her about it. Your sister knows what she's saying is shitty. You don't need to explain it to her like she's six years old. Just say, ""please don't say things like that when I'm around or I'll have to leave."" If she argues, CALMLY get up and leave - it's super important to not engage with her, be dramatic, show anger, etc. or you've missed the point.

But my mom and siblings are pretty poor (until we gave them some nice cutlery at Christmas they had seven forks in a three-person household) and so are my brother-in-law and his family. 

So while I still carry the $400 bag I got on sale for $150, I don't talk about it or show it off. If I get a complement on something I'm wearing I just say thank you and move on. We don't mention little splurges we make like the fact that I finally blew a few hundred on a Viking sword that my husband has wanted for years. We're not rich by any means, but we're finally at the point where we can live a little (my new vacuum is arriving tonight and I'm goofy excited) and it feels great. We try to lavish as much generosity on our families as they'll tolerate because we both love to. My mom is rebelling right now over the cutlery, a knife set, some new lidded garbage cans, and a few other things.

Reading about other people's families here, I'm struck by how fortunate I am. My husband and I exercise tact and sensitivity, my family are great at minding their own business, and we all get along fine."

Human emotions are complicated, and usually we feel how we feel without much ability to control it. Part of emotional maturity is accepting that fact while not letting your emotions dominate your actions.

You did a really nice job of accepting how you felt, and had a very private ceremony to acknowledge and affirm your feelings and situation. There's nothing wrong with the way you feel or how you behaved. You went out of your way to be discreet about it. Unfortunately your sister lives in the same house and knows your habits; that's the only reason she picked up on it. You couldn't really have done more to avoid it.

I think your sister will get over it. She's especially sensitive because she has a personal connection to the boy who died, being his sister's best friend. She's probably feeling a sense of loyalty on behalf of her friend. In a few months, when the intense emotions have faded a bit, you might decide to talk to your sister about this again. Or you might not - it just depends on your sister and whether she possesses the emotional intelligence to understand your situation. If not, it's probably just best to let it lie. She's experiencing a whirlwind of events and feelings, and it's likely this event will fade into the chaos of the memories of this time for her and not particularly stand out.

I can relate to your situation. I was bullied horribly by my brother (1 year and 9 months older) until he hit his mid-teens. He also sexually abused me for several years, but honestly, the bullying was worse and affected me more. He developed severe addiction problems and committed suicide when he was 21 and I was 19. I was both devastated and relieved. I felt relief he was dead both for my sake and for his, since he wasn't suffering any longer. I loved him deeply and hated him at the same time; I don't quite have words to explain it.

I spent many years criticizing myself for feeling relief/happiness/whatever at his death, until I realized and accepted that it was completely natural for me to feel that way. It didn't make me a monster or psychopath or anything. I don't talk about those feelings with my parents or other siblings because it would hurt them; otherwise, I have completely let myself off the hook for being glad my brother is dead.

I think you should do the same. Death is incredibly complicated and fraught, emotionally, and often we feel unexpected and socially ""unacceptable"" things. If I were in your shoes, I'd feel the same way as you. I admire your restraint and discretion; I'm not sure I could have handled it quite so maturely at 17."

childfree,fdtz9sl,t3_emtj2q,1578724704.0,"My husband and I have two dogs and own our home. (Barely found one in our budget, affordable homes are in short supply in our area, but we got lucky and found a good'un.) We have a modest emergency fund and are working on growing it. We have very little debt other than our mortgage: no car payments, just a few student loans that are almost gone and a credit card that's paid off every month. We're able to splurge on little things here and there, like a replica sword my husband has wanted for years that I finally just ordered for no other reason than it will make him so happy.

My brother-in-law and his wife have two kids and two dogs, rent a double-wide trailer for significantly more than our mortgage payment, are deep underwater in their old home in their former state that they can't sell, have two car payments, and have close to maybe $50k in debt. He's in school to finish his degree in electrical engineering (a very good thing) and gets a small living stipend from his GI Bill financial aid. She works at a retail store. They just found out the store is closing in a couple of months and she'll be out of a job. She'll be able to find another one easily enough, but it's still scary for them.

Dogtraining,fdm011g,t3_elx57n,1578536577.0,"I don't have an answer to your question, directly, but boy do I have a doggo who sounds similar to yours.

I adopted Dobby five years ago. He's a 13 lb. Chihuahua-terrier mix. We live in Montana, and he came from Oakland, California. The first year or so he DEEPLY rebelled against any kind of cold or wet weather.

The first winter, I could not make him go potty outside for anything if it was snowing or below about 20°F. Even if I carried him outside, he'd just hold it and shake pathetically. I tried to wait him out, but he'd go long enough that I didn't feel it was safe at times, even with his coat on. He'd hold it for over a day until he couldn't anymore and then he'd go on the bathroom rug or something, clearly not wanting to but just in a state of shock at the weather. That happened maybe a couple of dozen times that first winter.

Despite my despair I was patient with him, and every single time he went out and pottied, no matter what the weather, I made a huge deal when he came back in - enthusiastic praise and treats. By the second winter, he wasn't messing inside anymore. A few times he only went out once a day, but at least he went. Now, he reliably goes out morning and evening, no matter the weather. When it's especially coldnor snowing he might need a little encouraging, in the form of me walking a few steps outside and calling him, but then he'll come out and go do his stuff every time.

He's equally finicky about other things - when he'll eat, and other dogs. I've come to understand him, and I accept that he's a sensitive guy. He's not the fastest learner, but once he's got something down, he's 100% consistent.

My approach is to push his comfort zone a bit, but also to respect what he tells me about being uncomfortable.

For example, I take him to play group with our younger corgi. He is really excited to go, but he'll just stand there next to me and bark at the other dogs and get snippy if they try to interact with him. He wants to go to the group, but he only wants to watch. He really leans on his extraverted Corgi sister to be secure and comfortable in such situations. But even though he won't play with the other dogs, in two years he's gone from being a quivering, shaking, whining mess of anxiety to being relatively confident and excited for play group. He just participates on his terms. Any time he leaves my side for a bit, or lets another dog approach him without a lip lift or growl, I praise him and usually he gets a treat. Exposure and encouragement have helped multitudes. But they've helped very slowly.

Your pup sounds like she needs an extra helping of sensitivity and patience, in all areas. You sound like you're doing a fabulous job at that. Trust in you will really allow her to face and overcome other fears and challenges as she progresses. She'll always be who she is - personality is hardwired to a large extent, in my opinion - but I think she'll improve by leaps and bounds as she bonds with you more deeply and relies on you. I also think having a well-adjusted doggo sibling will help a ton, as it has with my guy. He's much more at ease by his sister's side than on his own.

Bless you for adopting a pupper who needs extra time, patience, and love. And good luck!"
childfree,fdh7ts2,t1_fdh2vks,1578417251.0,"I'm sorry for what you went through.

I'm someone who didn't have kids because of my mental illness and knowing I'd be a shit mom, and also because I didn't particularly want them.

I absolutely agree that some people with mental illness shouldn't have kids. It sounds like your mom was one of them. You were the victim there and what you endured was horrible. No child should experience that.

Where I'm differing from OP is in the statement that NO ONE with mental illness of any kind should have children. Mental illness is incredibly varied, and many people are able to manage it quite well.

According to NAMI, in the US, 1 in 5 adults experiences mental illness in any year, and 1 in 25 adults experiences severe mental illness. I'm in the latter category. I would agree that people with severe mental illness should not have children. I don't believe that any person with any mental illness shouldn't have children.

There was a time in our country when people with any kind of mental illness were frequently sterilized involuntarily, along with people of color, people who had a criminal history, and others. A blanket statement that no one with mental illness should have kids is exactly the sort of attitude that caused our country's despicable eugenicist history."

I'm a put off by the phrasing, ""here's what college is like for students with disabilities,"" especially from someone who intends to be an advocate for the disabled. It implies a singularity that disabled people are constantly fighting against. We're not a homogeneous mass who all have the same opinions and experiences. Thinking in that way contributes to the sense of ""other"" that leads to so much stigma and discrimination.

I'm much less disabled than Ms. Girma by any objective measure, but I'm less functional in many ways. My disabilities are primarily mental rather than physical. I am blessed with high intelligence and a gift for academic pursuits, but it still took me 13 years to get my undergraduate degree. I recognize the privilege and good fortune I had to get my degree at all.

Many disabled students do not find unquestioning and unending support from their schools' accommodation offices. It depends on the school, and on the student. In my personal experience, schools often don't feel as compelled to support students with non-physical disabilities. I was very lucky to have the support and understanding of my two successive academic advisors, who each advocated for me when I was unable to do so myself, and helped me find ways to muddle through. Without them, I would not have graduated. I also have a very supportive family, in terms of relationships though not finances as they live near the poverty level, again without whom I would not have graduated. I have many, many advantages that allowed me to eventually graduate.

Many disabled students never have the support they need to even consider attending college. Many disabled students lack institutional support when they do manage to matriculate, and are not able to finish their studies. Many students fall under the radar, expected to just suck it up, because they look normal and healthy. The range of experiences is as broad as the number of disabled people.

The author of this article is a unique young woman, and she has achieved amazing things, but I would argue that her experience is actually not much like the experiences of other disabled students who aren't of the caliber to attract nationwide media attention, meet the President, and be accepted to a school like Harvard Law."
progressive,fd75fmt,t3_ejvisz,1578199665.0,"I'm in my 30s and on SSDI for disability. There's a reason why my husband and I pay about $250/month to keep me on his insurance, even though I have Medicare: with only one insurance, my out-of-pocket costs would bankrupt me in a year. So I'm double-covered. It's an absolute necessity for me.

Note that for some insane reason that I do not understand, a person can't have double prescription coverage with Medicare and another plan. This one hurts, as my prescriptions cost us several hundred a month even with my husband's ""very good"" government employee insurance. I don't have Medicare prescription coverage because I'm not eligible if I have prescription coverage through my husband and I automatically do by being on his medical. I'd rather have Medicare prescription coverage (part D), since it covers much better, but I can't.

Edit: wanted to mention that I'm very, very fortunate to have the ability to have double coverage and be able to afford the additional premium, even if only just. If it weren't for my husband, I'd be up a creek eight ways to Sunday."

As for what to do... It depends on what your husband's internal motivation is here. If he's truly indifferent to this girl and just doesn't give two poops, or if he actually feels malevolent toward her, being around your husband may be really painful and psychologically traumatic for her. If he's acting this way out of some sort of guilt, there might be hope of getting him past his childishness and establishing a cordial if not caring relationship between the two.
