Its not your fault dude, however, It’s good that you identify your anger management issues, as acceptance is the first step of healing. You want to be a better person, learn to take responsibility, and that is a great quality. Try and take time for yourself alone just to chill and clear your head. Also reach out at school/college for a counsellor if you have that. It’s important to have support from others. By the way your username is awesome, so you def shouldn’t hate yourself. :)"
