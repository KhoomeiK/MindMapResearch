Usually, they get thrown out once they have gone through puberty. Instead of spaying/neutering them to keep their behaviour at bay, people get rid of them. Also, independently from their gonads' stage of development, teenage cats are a handful, which people don't realise when they get them while they are tiny kittens. So they throw them out."

Honestly, I find it so sweet to watch a cat pushing stuff from tables with an ever-surprised look on its face, or even a look of accomplishment because it notices that every time it does this, its humans laugh. It also demonstrates that they are confident and feel comfortable in their environment. That said, my flat is cat-proof The only thing my foster cats can throw off a surface is a pen, the rest of my stuff is too heavy, not fun to push or immobile."

As painful as reliving my loss is, it brings me a little bit of peace of mind to know that there is someone who understands, after all, even if they are an ocean and some countries away. It really, really pains me to know that most probably no one will relate to your pain because the being you lost wasn't a human. This is the reason why I, personally, opted not to have talk therapy at a psychotherapist's. But perhaps my outlook is too pessimistic, and I really don't want to discourage you from giving a therapist a chance. After all, it is a huge burden to carry around what we are going through without being able to talk to anyone about it in depth. A therapist could possibly also include your loved ones and inform them (with your consent) in a professional manner about what you are going through, because having them not understand your shift in personality is just an additional burden for you, which a therapist can probably help lift.

I cannot tell you how much I relate to you about what you said regarding your other cats and needing to keep going for their sake. I am very proud that you were strong and selfless enough to take in a cat for your boy and I cannot begin to imagine how hard it must have been for you to see your new cat sleep on the same couch, play with the same carpet and walk the same halls as your Kitten. I know that I wasn't able to do this and I'm still ashamed for being so selfish. Chances are that by your action you prolonged your boy's life by many, many happy years, because just like humans, cats often don't want to carry on living when their loved one passes away. I am aware it sounds cheesy as hell, but this is what your boy's sister would have wanted for him.

The good news is that you getting treatment and becoming yourself again after a while will have a positive effect on your boy, too. :)

I could write a novel about what places I recommend volunteering in ... I personally have tried helping out in many countries during the school/university summer holidays. I had to withdraw from volunteering in Eastern Europe (specifically Serbia, Bosnia, Romania and Bulgaria), in Spain, Italy and Cyprus. Public funding for animal matters there is basically inexistent, and even if you just spend your day catching and releasing animals, you come across so much suffering. Instead, I have started funding such programmes that two Serbian and one Spanish friend of mine carry out. 15 Euro is what it costs to neuter a cat and even though I cannot be physically involved in the activity for the sake of my sanity, I am very happy to say that plenty of cats have been spared the destiny of becoming mothers to children that are doomed from the start due to my friends' incessant activity (despite all the abuse they receive and the things they see) and, in part, my funding.
I myself am exclusively involved in Switzerland and Austria now. Austria is particularly nice to volunteer in because federal law obliges cat owners to spay/neuter them, shelters are exclusively no-kill ones and animals are generally treated kindly. Also, the Alpine scenery is incredible. If you ever want to volunteer in an emotionally safe environment, I recommend either of those countries (for example, Gut Aiderbichl or Tierparadies Schabenreith are located in the Alps and love to have volunteers). I have also volunteered in Koh Lanta in Thailand, which I feared would be extremely emotionally draining, but it wasn't. It was beautiful, actually. It's a small island in Southern Thailand, with volunteers being mostly from the US, Australia or Western Europe, and cats as well as dogs aren't treated badly there. Because of them, about 4 out of 5 cats I encountered on the island had already been spayed. I think they also rent a boat from time to time for their vets (also volunteers) and their helpers to go to other islands and help spay/neuter the animals there.
Sri Lanka, however, only has three animal shelters on the whole island, one of them being the Cat Protection Trust Sri Lanka where I volunteered at, and none of them is funded by the government. I was crying non-stop, and the people who run these shelters have my utmost respect. But one other volunteer really cheered up there, said it was the first meaningful thing she did in her life, and helped so many cats and dogs while becoming happier every day! It is really easy to help animals there because they are usually not shy and eat anything you give them, including the much needed anti-mange medicine, which costs a couple of cents and spares them from so much suffering.
What I want to say is that even though one place made me very sad, it could make you happy and/or find meaning. Nonetheless I completely understand not wanting to leave the US, let alone in your current state and with your boy needing you. I am sure that there are volunteers where you live who could introduce you to this activity, and once you're comfortable with this and have gathered a little knowledge, you could apply your knowledge everywhere around the globe in the years to come. And even if you decide not to follow up on it, then you can safely say that you had looked into it and that you'd like to do something else, which is more than ok. That way, you'll find what makes you feel fulfilled one day :)

Sorry for the painfully long comment. I, too, wish you all the best from the bottom of my heart. And thank you very much for introducing me to a person I can relate so well to. I am ""following"" you, by the way, and I hope to see updates on how you are doing once in a while."

financialindependence,ff0b65z,t1_feykppo,1579467107.0,"Hey, it's me again, I just commented on getting involved in trap, neuter and return programmes. The feelings you are experiencing sound too familiar to mine when I lost my cat (whose name I still cannot pronounce or write down, otherwise it would make the loss appear too real again). I snooped in your post history and discovered that the parallels scare me. I even had very similar dreams that made me make up crying and feeling even more miserable for days, if not weeks. It was a cycle of feeling bad, then worse, then bad again, but I was never happy or even just satisfied, because I had lost my cat. ""My cat"" really doesn't do it justice at all, this being was everything for me. Most people will probably roll their eyes at that and not understand what my cat was, was made him so lovable, what he meant to me, so I never told anyone. I felt alone with my grief. To be honest, I still am alone with it and to be even more honest, it's been years and I am still not the same. However, I definitely was not only grieving in a healthy manner, but I was depressed. I realised that too late. At one point, I started therapy (i.e. antidepressants) and it helped me tremendously. I am not even close to forgetting him, the first time I held him, the pain of his loss etc., but I have regained a little bit of passion for life. Not everything makes me terribly sad anymore. I feel more normal. I can help cats now, whereas a couple of years ago every cat would remind me of my loss. I trap feral cats, get them neutered and return them in my spare time. If they're friendly, my organisation tries to rehome them. If they're not friendly but in need of help or vulnerable, there is a sanctuary where they are loved. It is beautiful, actually. And it doesn't require me to adopt another cat (I couldn't do that, I still love my deceased cat far too much), but it allows me to temporarily care for other cats. But I could have never done that without beating my depression first.

I really, really hope you find your way and I sincerely hope to read from you again."

I also simultaneously studied romance studies in two different countries and you basically received an A just for showing up. I remember that in one of the three major exams in the first semester one out of two tasks was to ""draw a map of Spain, include three cities and two rivers.""

What regards the conversations about his childhood: we've had many and he let me know that she used to do everything for him. So much so that he scheduled his doctor's appointments well into adulthood. He also tells me how much he has grown, mentally, since he is with me. He says he has become much more independent, self-sufficient and confident. And while this is objectively true, he still regresses whenever she is around. He is comfortable regressing. He is comfortable when she peels his apples for him and I fear me mocking him for it might only create resentment towards me. He has a stressful job, and he says it's nice for him to be able to relax like this.

Knowing myself, I would have made her regret her death wish towards the mother of her grandchild until her own death!

I know you asked for advice how to have a relationship with your fiancé's family and that both you and your partner want this. I can't give you any advice on that, I'm sorry. Rather, I think it would be best to evaluate both your motivations for wanting this person in your child's life. She was abusive to your partner through his childhood, so we know she's not just capable of being abusive to adults and doesn't stop when there is a child's mental health at stake. She is so evil that she told you to kill yourself explicitly while you were welcoming her grandchild in the world. This is a time in your and your child's life that was meant to be filled with love, warmth and compassion. Instead she kicked you while you were vulnerable and wished for her grandchild to become an orphan. For me, the question is whether she could pull herself together enough when your child is present as not to harm him. Can she do that? I don't think so. You're obviously the object of her disdain, your mere presence triggers her into showing her true, abusive colours. What if you weren't around when she saw your child? She'd find ways to manipulate him and harm you even when you're not there. Can your fiancé stop that? This is for you to answer (just like everything else, and I hope I don't come across patronisingly; everything about this is your choice and please don't let anyone tell you otherwise). But as he is someone who has been abused by her through his childhood and who witnessed her telling you to die, I'm afraid he might not be seeing clearly yet. I think that if he were out of the FOG he wouldn't want her to be able to spend any time with you or your child. This is why I ask that you both re-evaluate your motivations. Is his fear, obligation or guilt? Is yours the same by proxy?
Is it not wanting to deprive your child of half his family? I completely understand that, but please keep in mind that people don't miss what they've never known. I personally grew up with no grandparents at all and have found lovely people in my teens which treat me as they would their granddaughter. And they're kind! They are genuinely kind and wish the best for me. I don't know if my biological grandparents were lovely as well, but I honestly, I don't care and I'm very happy with the grandparents who ""adopted"" me."

From a young age, we are taught that sex is dirty, then we are taught (as women) that we ought to be ashamed if we have sex and (as men) that we must convince women to spread their legs for us in order to become accomplished members of society.
If sex weren't treated the way it is by most members of most societies, but if it were seen as the basic need it is instead, everything would be much easier.

How could it? The vagina is basically devoid of nerve endings (apart from the opening) and the feeling of pressure is just that. However, having my partner penetrate me does feel good to me on an emotional level. I feel protected, I feel dominated, I feel wanted by it.

In conjunction with clitoral stimulation, penetrative sex feels nice and better than just pressure when I am about to reach climax, as my vaginal contractions increase the pressure and thus the emotions I feel.

He has obviously been practicing in the USA for many years, which is why I agree with your ""Yikes"" exclamation even if he didn't have any formal language training. I believe this is a legitimate sentiment in this case, never mind how many languages you speak. However, if he is dyslexic, then we're both assholes in my opinion. :)"

I also think that sticking to a calorie restriction diet for a couple of weeks or months is more beneficial to anyone, as it requires or at least inspires a change in the relationship one has with food, which is pivotal to long-term success.  I wish you the best!"

Whenever I lie on a flat surface and tilt my head, my face looks as if it was melting. It looks to me as if she hadn't edited her face much, so what is this about? Do I have exceptionally weak tissue in my face? Do models (on Instagram, in magazines, in ads and commercials) have extremely tight skin?"

milk, cheese and cow meat are some of the most detrimental consumer products there are, unfortunately.

Regarding the roadtrip: taking the car to go on a roadtrip is not environmentally friendly.

To sum it up, OP's suggestion of taking the car around the vast country that is Australia to buy consumer goods nobody really needs (including milk) is the kind of behaviour that brought man-made climate change upon us in the first place. It's a nice gesture for sure, but it is harmful in the long run. I'm not saying that one person going on a holiday there and drinking milk or eating meat  will cause bush fires, but let's face it: how many people do you personally know that abstain from that?

Edit: Sorry, I mixed your comment up with another one, so please ignore the part about the cows. :)"

From the fact that he's receiving treatment at a local (i.e. small and rural) hospital I deduce that the burns aren't as severe as portrayed by the comment you're talking about. Normally, people with severe burns are transferred to one of the two prestigious burn units in the country.

Regarding the cost: Usually, insurance would pay any and all treatment and recovery expenses. However, since this dude acted with severe negligence, the insurance will take recourse for most (if not all) of the expenses against him."
