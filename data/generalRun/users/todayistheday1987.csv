SkincareAddiction,ffw27sw,t3_evfoqs,1580281184.0,"So, skincare products won’t treat perioral dermatitis. The best thing to do is honestly not use anything for awhile or go as bare minimum as possible. Depending on the severity of the dermatitis, it likely won’t go away without getting a prescription for oral or topical antibiotics, or something like Elidel cream. I know that isn’t what you want to hear, and it sucks. 

Since you can’t see a derm, some things that COULD help but again- it might not: switch to a non-fluoride and non-SLS toothpaste, use a zinc-based cream like diaper cream or LRP cicaplast baume, or try to see if an anti-fungal cream like Lotrimin helps. The biggest thing though is not to throw a bunch of skincare products on your face. When I had PD, my derm actually told me to do nothing to my face for two weeks except cleanse gently once a day. That means even sunscreen so you should also avoid the sun during that time."
SkincareAddiction,ffw1puk,t3_ev2hve,1580280619.0,"Darn! I just purchased the YTTP AHA toner. I’ve used it once so I can’t really say much about it but I do feel like it exacerbated my redness a bit. I also tried a sample of honeymoon glow at one point and though it seems to have a higher acid concentration, it didn’t leave me as red as the YTTP?"
SkincareAddiction,ffw0x4n,t3_evhvgg,1580279756.0,"And for some reason, when you’re meh about a product it lasts FOREVER (currently in the throes or what I call the never ending sunscreen). But when you love a product that’s a little expensive it seems to go so fast!"
SkincareAddiction,ffw0pt5,t3_evb0kn,1580279538.0,"Yeah, just posted something similar on the other thread. Lots of time this “skincare addiction” is thinly disguised shopping/product addiction or OCD-like behavior akin to like, people with othorexia.

It doesn’t always have to be hugely unhealthy. I myself definitely find shopping therapeutic, and my shopping mostly goes to beauty products. Lots of people with at least some disposable income have a mild shopping addiction. It’s important to be as mindful about it as possible so we can be self-aware when it’s getting a bit too much."
Sephora,ffvvd8p,t1_ffvu4e3,1580274376.0,"The worst part is I was so happy to cash in my points for that reward because I’m just not a fan of Sephora in general (I’ve realized I can get way better bang for my buck by shopping at Ulta or direct from the brand) and wanted to be done with them! Now I have all these points that I don’t care to use. But you’re right, at the very least I got those points to hopefully try to snag another reward!"
SkincareAddiction,ffvu3br,t3_ev8hhg,1580273288.0,"It’s funny to me how defensive people get with posts like this and the number of “just let people do what they want stop shaming them!!!” comments. Certainly do what you want, but in the society we live in, it’s important to point out the unintentional impact of your decisions. And shame is a feeling YOU have not something someone is projecting onto you. If you have no qualms about what you’re doing, then why would you feel shame regardless of what someone else is saying to you? 

If skincare is a hobby for you, cool, it’s actually a hobby for me too. The very definition of a hobby is being into something that is likely a little bit frivolous in the sense that it’s not strictly necessary for a comfortable life. So, as another example, my partner is really into cars and so he has like five classic cars and it’s dumb to me because why do you need that many cars? You don’t. But it’s a hobby for him. That’s great and as long as it isn’t interfering with the important things in life, he can keep on being interested in purchasing classic cars. But there’s no misunderstanding on his part that it IS frivolous and not strictly necessary. 

So back to skincare. If it’s a hobby for you, great. But don’t get defensive when it’s called out that it’s actually pretty frivolous and NOT necessary to maintain your skin health especially when most beauty products actually go against the science of what your skin needs to be healthy. One person does not need five cars, just like one person does not need twenty skincare products. That’s just a truth. If you just like having twenty products, that’s fine, but why are you trying to hide the fact that it’s more about the ritual or the product fascination or the shopping hobby that you have?

Because the truth is that having twenty products doesn’t necessarily mean you’re a skincare addict, but more likely means you’re a product addict. Which there’s nothing wrong with that. I am a self proclaimed product addict and would be even moreso if my skin wasn’t so sensitive. What’s so bad about admitting it?"
SkincareAddiction,ffvt6dw,t1_ffutkab,1580272533.0,"Right. The origins of the self care concept are actually antithetical to people participating in conspicuous consumption and capitalism in order to live up to patriarchal beauty ideals and standards. 

I don’t have the most ridiculous amount of products but I definitely have more than I probably need AND I spend more than probably the average person on my routine. But I don’t lie to myself, I’m aware it’s a part of myself that has internalized the consumerism and beauty obsession rampant in our society."
SkincareAddiction,ffvsvku,t1_ffuivb7,1580272288.0,"This is a thought I appreciate though. You’re aware that your skin would be fine with the basics, you do more cause you like it. No one can knock that as long as you aren’t going broke to do so (and that’s a whole other convo). The problem is some people obsessively think they NEED it and actually create more issues."
SkincareAddiction,ffvsf9s,t1_ffv4dhz,1580271930.0,"But doesn’t this just mean you use hydrating products multiple times a day and with multiple layers rather than that you just have a dozen different products? I don’t think the issue is that some people need more than just a single moisturizer layer, because that’s real. But that doesn’t necessarily equate to having like 20 products"
SkincareAddiction,ffvs84s,t1_ffu93o8,1580271774.0,"But most severe skin problems can’t be solved with skincare and most often benefit from simple routines. That’s a common problem in this sub. People with severe acne trying to treat it with a million products when they would be much better served with a bare bones routine and a prescription medication. Now I’m not knocking that there may be the rare person who really does need a complicated routine. But for the vast majority of people, that first scenario is largely untrue."
SkincareAddiction,ffvrr0g,t1_ffue5r8,1580271400.0,"This! This whole 10-12 step Korean routine is a MARKETING TERM. In general there is more of a widespread skincare culture in Korea, sure, but there is still as much variety in the routine lengths as there is in the US or Canada. Your average Jill and Joe is not always necessarily doing 10 steps.

Edit: also, it’s a myth that they all have doll skin. We only see the ones that do and usually under heavy filters and makeup. If we actually lived there and knew average people, again, we would see as much variety in skin issues as we see here."
SkincareAddiction,ffvrkbm,t1_ffu5jfo,1580271256.0,"Big routines are almost always unnecessary. But I agree there’s not really a need to judge those who have them... it’s sort of like your wardrobe. You don’t NEED all the different things in there but you like the variety and fashion part and being able to create different outfits. There’s nothing wrong with having a big routine inherently, what’s misguided about posts here sometimes is that people swear they NEED all the steps, which influences a lot of newbies into making bad decisions. You like having five different moisturizers to bounce between depending on your mood or the weather or the texture you need? Cool more power to you. But don’t perpetuate the belief that if you suddenly lost four of those moisturizers your skin would immediately disintegrate"
SkincareAddicts,ffuweyi,t1_fful6pk,1580250619.0,Commenting just to say that I haaaaaated skin food! On top of it having alcohol and synthetic fragrance AND essential oils it was also unpleasantly thick/stiff while simultaneously not being moisturizing enough. I used it up as a hand cream and I didn’t even like it for that! I don’t get why so many people love it.
SkincareAddicts,ffuw6ey,t3_ev8h55,1580250487.0,"Avene Skin Recovery Cream is amazing! I use the rich version at night. Since it’s a little thick to wear under makeup, I use embryolisse during the day and I love that too. I have sensitive skin and it’s worked super well for me but I do want to note it has fragrance so I would tread with caution there if you know that fragrance bothers your skin. But the Avene skin recovery is fragrance free!"
explainlikeimfive,ffuo8gb,t3_ev99yv,1580246102.0,"Former teacher here who currently runs a program to train teachers. The problem is that most homework is assigned as busy work NOT as strategic, targeted practice to improve in the areas where you need more skill development. What this means is that the kids who already mastered the skills that the homework covers, don’t get anything beneficial from it. Then the kids who actually haven’t mastered it at all and need additional instruction also don’t benefit from the homework because they can’t even tackle it.  Homework can be effective but it takes a lot more thoughtful planning and skill than just randomly assigning some likely poorly written questions in a standard textbook. Problem is that teachers are overworked and underpaid to be able to do that at a holistic level"
Sephora,ffu7b1m,t1_ffu3z4i,1580236003.0,"It wasn’t expired yet, just they’re saying I already “used it” because I applied it to an order even though I didn’t complete the transaction"
30PlusSkinCare,ffsptjd,t3_eupmqu,1580188289.0,"Anti aging is just a marketing term and a poor one at that. Nobody should be anti/against aging. Sunscreen prevents photodamage and tretinoin helps reverse signs of damage (sun spots, fine lines). Other than that, just keep your skin nicely hydrated and exfoliated."
SCAcirclejerk,ffsno6n,t1_ffrsb59,1580186421.0,"So sorry for your experience and glad you’re still here too! And yea, posts like this reek of some mind blowing privilege. If your acne is the worst thing that has ever happened to you and the worst thing you can conceive of happening to you .... I don’t even know what to say."
SCAcirclejerk,ffsnj8g,t3_euu6b8,1580186305.0,"Ughhh that post was insane. And then the number of comments that were like NO BUT YOU DONT GET HOW TERRIBLE ACNE CAN BE. Like dude, I would rather have a face full of acne than a ton of other things that could go wrong with my health or my life. And I know “suffering Olympics” isn’t helpful but I still just can’t get over how much people need to understand that having acne is far far far from the worst thing that can happen to you, and yes you can still be happy with acne regardless of the social stigma, but YOU have to make that happen for yourself"
SkincareAddiction,ffsn3lb,t3_eur0ku,1580185952.0,"This is such a weird post though I understand it’s meant well. It just highlights how unhealthy of a relationship a lot of people here have with their skin, that this is even something to think about. Like yes, we all want to look our best and we are here because we care about our skin and it’s appearance. But if you are letting your skin control your life or your ability to be happy, that IS on you. I am not understating how socially and emotionally detrimental acne can be... it IS, but so are lots of other things in life that people have to deal with that they have no control over."
SkincareAddiction,ffsmn5q,t1_ffr9iqv,1580185579.0,"Potentially yes, but even the most conventionally ugly or acne-ridden people have people who love them and can have full, wonderful lives. It’s a lie to say that looks don’t matter because it absolutely impacts how you’re perceived and your access to jobs, social capital, basic human kindness. But there’s a lot of things that people struggle with that impact them in that way. It doesn’t mean you can’t pursue a fulfilling life.

There are people who don’t have legs or have had half their face burned off that still find a way to be happy and be above that."
SCAcirclejerk,ffn93cn,t1_ffn2c4p,1580063269.0,Right! Also most people are likely not as sensitive as they think they are. I’m not trying to gaslight anybody and I know some people truly have sensitive skin. But it’s not as many as people claim on SCA. I thought I couldn’t use anything in my face when I first went down the skincare rabbit hole- I literally was like everything breaks me out or causes irritation! Turns out it was more the constant throwing random products at my face all the time that was the issue. I DO still have fairly sensitive skin but it’s not to the point where I’m this special fairy that has a laundry list of ingredients I can’t use.
scacjdiscussion,ffmrfzu,t3_eu6tfc,1580058151.0,"Like with all things it just depends. You don’t NEED to double cleanse. But the cleansing process is also the most irritating for your skin, and double cleansing is the most gentle but effective way for me. If I only used a single cleanser I’d have to use way more, scrub harder, or even get a harsher one.

Edit: also double cleansing for me actually isn’t really even about cleansing twice. The oil step just melts everything on my face so that my actual cleansing step doesn’t have to work that hard and overly disrupt my skin."
scacjdiscussion,ffmqtct,t1_ffmbkpm,1580057948.0,This! I don’t think double cleansing is strictly necessary but I’ve actually found it great for my sensitive dry skin because using two very gentle cleansing options is much less irritating than a too strong single cleanser
scacjdiscussion,ffmnt62,t3_eu437y,1580057064.0,I really wish they would make a non fragrance version of the ponds cleansing balm like they did with the cold cream! I would be on that in a heartbeat.
scacjdiscussion,ffmnnhz,t1_ffles1f,1580057004.0,I actually love this because it’s super non irritating. A lot of the other cleansing balls have fragrance. But you’re right it definitely feels filmy.... weird thing is I’ve had different experiences with it too. Like sometimes I’ll buy one and feel it gets off a lot easier but then the next one I buy will be super hard to remove. There seems to be some inconsistencies in the formulation.
SkincareAddiction,ffk9qmz,t1_ffiztp7,1580019267.0,But that’s why the overall formulation matters more than a single ingredient. The presence of alcohol in and of itself doesn’t mean it’s NOT moisturizing for dry skin
SkincareAddiction,ffk9gw5,t1_ffipaw9,1580019152.0,But the amount of alcohol in most skincare can’t be compared to putting actual rubbing alcohol on your skin. The dose makes the poison.
SkincareAddiction,ffk95dd,t1_ffiuro8,1580019006.0,But it misses the point that the alcohols on the left can indeed be “bad” as well if your skin can’t handle fatty alcohols. It also misses the point that overall formulation is way more important than avoiding single ingredients
SkincareAddiction,ffk8tch,t1_ffifdh9,1580018842.0,"This. The more accurate distinction would be drying alcohols and alcohols that are hydrating/moisturizing, but I guess even that isn’t wholly true, because even drying alcohols can be added to an overall very moisturizing formulation for other purposes. But the good and bad distinction is so off. Some people do just fine with alcohol denat in some of their products but can’t get near any fatty alcohols."
SCAcirclejerk,ffk8f28,t1_ffk7n0u,1580018658.0,"Why can’t the sub that preaches YMMV ever actually use that logic when it comes to specific ingredients? Thayers works great for some, is super irritating for others. Like basically all skincare products smh"

SkincareAddiction,ff3b8iv,t3_ereu8q,1579537788.0,"A derm (shereene idriss) that I follow has said that she’s seen HA cause inflammation for some people. Anecdotally, I’m prone to facial redness and I’ve found it depends a lot on the formulation. I stay away from HA serums with butylene glycol- I cant be sure of this, but I suspect the penetration enhancing of butylene glycol makes my skin irritated. I also only use the sodium hyaluronate form, as other forms due to molecular weight also makes me more red and irritated. I use tarte’s HA serum which is annoyingly more pricey than I would like to spend on HA given how many affordable options there are, but it’s the one that ticks all the boxes for me! Also tarte has a lot of sales so I never buy it full price."
Showerthoughts,ff255k1,t3_er181r,1579494093.0,"I get your point but I don’t agree fully. Lots of people who were once poor, and then became comfortable, would still say money doesn’t buy happiness. It depends on how you define happiness though. I will say money theoretically should make it easier to be happy (for example, you should be able to have more quality time with your loved ones), but human beings are great at creating psychological obstacles to happiness even when the physical ones aren’t there. 

That being said, I do think people who say money isn’t IMPORTANT are broadcasting that they’ve never had to struggle for it. Not being able to afford even the most basic health care, food, living situation, or educational options for your child cures you of that delusion real quick."
AskReddit,fez52nt,t3_eqvtxd,1579453938.0,"I’m not a man lol but I don’t think gender matters here. I think with all things it depends on context and healthy communication is key. Lack of physical intimacy absolutely erodes relationships. But shit also happens. Hormones, tragedy, depression, debilitating illnesses. I do think no matter what, a person’s sexual needs can’t be ignored for too long of a period, or resentment arises. But there are lots of ways to do that if sex happens to not be an option because of a significant issue. Like if my partner was so sick his body just couldn’t handle it, he could become really great at dirty talk and using his fingers."

It’s also funny because the richest and most resourced people are actually not reproducing as much, so you’re also, albeit unintentionally, kind of saying get rid of poor people.
