Calgary,fgjg12e,t1_fgjb4g3,1580843271.0,"I would go to Peasant Cheese Shop - personal preference and I used to work with the owners and they are great people. Depending on what they have in store they can help. 
Otherwise you can go to Safeway for example and buy Gruyère, Emmenthal and Comté if they have some. Just make sure to buy the real stuff made in Switzerland/France.

You have different styles of fondue. I grew up in Burgundy, France and we are nestled between Jura and Switzerland and Auvergne. Traditionally we would rub the pot with garlic cloves, put some white wine and some kirsch (cherry eau-de-vie) and use gruyère/comté. That would be my recommendation.

In Auvergne it’s more common to use blue cheese like St Nectaire & fourme d’Ambert. It’s maybe a bit hardcore as blue cheese is an acquired taste.

Usually we just dip bread and have some charcuterie on the side.

And third, we have the “Fondue Bourguignonne” which is a meat fondue but I guess you are leaning towards cheese."
Calgary,fgjasly,t3_eytt62,1580840316.0,"My comment may not be helpful but have you considered making the fondue at your place ? That way you could pick good quality cheese and it’s quite easy to do.
As a cheese lover, I never tried any fondue in Calgary as it tends to be overpriced. Only tried Grizzly House and it was ok."

But hey, I suppose you’re a grown-up, you can eat whatever you want if it makes you happy. I don’t care."
todayilearned,fghb01z,t1_fghal1s,1580780796.0,"Hmmm no, I said “Prosecco is not champagne”. I’m afraid you misunderstood the point I was trying to convey while agreeing with it.
I’m just tired to see people saying “hey let’s have champagne” and have Prosecco served. I truly don’t have anything at all against Prosecco but if people could stop using “Champagne” as a facade because they are semi-ashamed they can only afford Prosecco that would be great."
todayilearned,fghad9q,t1_fgh75ub,1580780379.0,"I re-read my post and can’t find where I said that one is better than the other. I certainly have a preference but didn’t say anything. I said they are two distincts things and I agree with you on that count. It’s not the same fermentation process, or technique, or terroir."
todayilearned,fgh6cd7,t1_fggz92z,1580777739.0,"I hear you. I feel that trying to use the proper word is now seen as “snobbish”. 
No, Prosecco is not Champagne, Kraft Parmesan is milk byproduct mixed with sawdust and doesn’t have anything to do with actual Parmesan."
AskReddit,fggino5,t3_ey5tm0,1580762664.0,"Tourism was ruined by mass tourism.
I lived in touristic places most of my life - right now I live close to Banff and even over the past 5 years it’s becoming worse during summer. Good luck going to Lake Louise or Lake Moraine. Before you could find a parking spot nearby and hike. Now you have to basically hike from and to your parking spot."
france,ffrmv18,t1_ffqhbim,1580161326.0,"Ouep au Canada anglophone tant qu’on fait ses heures on se barre quand on veut ou tant que le boulot est fait. Ou même le Vendredi partir à 1pm pour boire une pinte ou deux ou trois avec ses collègues. Les bons managers ferment les yeux la dessus en sachant que tant que le travail est fait, ils ont plus de chance de s’aliéner les employés qu’autre chose en les fliquant."

Remember to do your best, play safe and always keep in mind it’s only a game.
You are likely not in the top 1% of HOTS player and you don’t rely on the game to live. 
Losing a game won’t concern you after a good night sleep so it’s not worth dwelling on it."
heroesofthestorm,fetb4tv,t1_fesl0oh,1579373535.0,And we appreciate your work. Players will keep complaining on this and that but we can all agree that you’re doing a tremendous job keeping this game fun and alive.

I’m also European and love this city with all my heart. I feel home here even though I will move back to the countryside in France when I will retire.
Winters are not as bad as in the East but it’s still stupid cold."
AskReddit,fdrefv0,t3_emqd57,1578683367.0,"Darn Tough Socks.
My wife was crazy when I spent 28CA$ on ONE pair of socks but boy are they comfortable, soft, hot and tough. Also when the day will come I will destroy it, it’s guaranteed for life. I have 6 pairs of them and don’t expect to buy new socks for a long time.

Miele
I used to have some Miele appliances before I moved and love them. My Miele vacuum is way better than what I ever bought from Dyson. My only regret is not spending extra for the pet care package.

MSI 
I have never been lucky with ASUS and not enough experience with Gygabite but never been disappointed with MSI for my gaming needs.

Honda
I bought my first new car when I was 24. It was a Honda Civic 2008 (the European edition with a peculiar look). I LOVED this car. My current car is a used Accord. Our next car will be a Passport or a Pilot."
