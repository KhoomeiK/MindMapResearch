Who believes that Trump is genuinely  concerned about bribery when he only cares about *one* instance of it that happens to relate to the person he (at the time) assumes would be his 2020 rival?

This is irrelevant. Trump not withholding aid to a particular country YOU have a problem with is no more evidence of an impeachable offense than anything else we have talked about so far.

\>“Well technically the race hasn’t started” = BS

It's not a technicality. The 2020 race was many, many months from even beginning when this happened. It wasn't even known if Biden was going to RUN yet. This is an important caveat.\\

\>And as for impeachable offenses that didn’t result in impeachment: That doesn’t set a legal precedent.

I don't even understand what this sentence means. Breaking the Act is not an impeachable offense. There aren't even remedies written into the Act beyond using the courts to force giving of the aid. Delaying aid is certainly not a 'high crime,' and yes, that has been established by precedent, not to mention the WRITTEN BOUNDARIES OF THE LAW ITSELF.

\>Breaking the law remains illegal even if sometimes people get away with it.

But it didn't even get to the point that the remedy elucidated in the Act itself was used; he wasn't even sued to be forced to remit the aid. He gave it up willingly, without any pressure, after a couple month delay. This doesn't even scratch the surface of an offense so grievous it warrants being removed from office. That's the thing you don't seem to be picking up here. Impeachable offenses are very serious crimes. Delaying aid for a month or two isn't even close to a felony, let alone a very serious crime that warrants removal from office. Trump could be caught red-handed doing a number of actual crimes and most of them wouldn't be considered impeachable offenses."

This isn't really true. Biden wasn't even a candidate at the time this happened, because the 2020 race hadn't started yet. Not only that, it has been far from proven that Trump did this for personal reasons. That's the tricky thing about motive; it's hard to prove in court. As a counterexample, there is a vested interest of the American people to know precisely why Hunter Biden was appointed to Burisma while his Dad was vice-President.

\>That is the definition of impeachable offense.

Um, no, it's not. It's not a 'high crime' because many presidents have 'broken' this particular law, and not been impeached for it.

\>Just because a president violated a law and didn’t get impeached in the  past doesn’t mean that that is unimpeachable; it only means that *that* president wasn’t impeached for it.
