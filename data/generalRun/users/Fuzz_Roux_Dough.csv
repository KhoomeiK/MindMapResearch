Calling Trump supporters stupid (especially to their face) is a great way to isolate them further and in no way helps convince them to change their opinion. If someone called you stupid, would you want to be that person's friend? No, why would you? It's the same. Trump supporters are gonna stay with the guy that doesn't tell them they're stupid.

Propaganda is a helluva thing. If it's all you see, it's VERY convincing. You don't have to be stupid to believe it. You just have be immersed in it long enough to where it seems to be fact."

Man, I'm so sorry you had such a terrible gyno, they're truly either really amazing, or absolutely horrible. Not many on betweens. I REALLY hope you have a better gyno, no one deserves the mistreatment you went through."
AskReddit,fem2xtx,t1_fem2ljm,1579238003.0,They didn't put you under for punch biopsies?! I've had 3 endoscopic punch biopsies of my small intestines and a colonoscopy for intestinal problems and I was under for each. That sounds like literal torture. You DEFINITELY need different doctors.
AskReddit,feklh8x,t1_fekkvuo,1579202521.0,My blood is BOILING hearing your story. What the actual fuck. They're treating you like subhuman property. Who CARES if your theoretical next husband wants kids. What about what YOU want?! Jesus I'm so sorry that happened to you. I can't believe that belief still exists.
AskReddit,fekk21t,t1_fekiv9f,1579201682.0,"Dang, either you or your husband is very fertile haha. And wtf is up with doctors telling women they're too young to have their tubes tied, but it's ok for men to get a vasectomy?! You don't want kids, that's your choice. Ugh"
AskReddit,fek9xul,t1_fejg6up,1579195666.0,"Thank you, I want to have a new doctor check me out to see if there is something going on. I've had pain issues before the IUD, but it was more a gland thing rather than cervix and uterus pain, which is what I get now. Plus, my period has just never been the same since."
AskReddit,fek9bn8,t1_fek8856,1579195300.0,"I know there are a few in the comments that said their removal was painful or required surgery. But if it helps, mine was pretty painless, which was surprising after the amount of pain I went through for insertion. So you might be lucky. But it's always good to be prepared. Maybe see if they can put you under or at the very least sedate you, just in case."
AskReddit,fek934f,t1_fek4rfz,1579195161.0,"Yeah, honestly, that's probably your best bet, especially if you have PCOS. I didn't have pain with my removal, but everyone is different, and I really think it's better to be safe than sorry."
AskReddit,fek8vrl,t1_fek2ams,1579195041.0,"My removal was virtually painless, if that helps ease your mind. This is actually the first time I've heard of nightmare removals, so I'll keep my fingers crossed for you that it won't be!"
AskReddit,fek8mbc,t1_fek5s7v,1579194885.0,"Mine was copper as well. I'm sorry your experience was similar to mine, I wouldn't wish that pain on anyone. I'm glad you were able to stick with it though and that it's fine for you now. I couldn't because of my job. I was a dog groomer at the time and every time I'd move a certain way, I'd get a blinding sharp pain in the left side of my uterus, which made it nearly impossible to work because I was constantly moving and twisting around. I was on commission, and I had to keep missing work due to it. I couldn't have made it 6 months to see if it got any better."

I'm pretty positive mine not still in there because she showed it to me after and it was whole, but I still plan on going in for some tests because it's been years and I've never been the same."
AskReddit,fek5f1u,t1_fek43u8,1579192984.0,"Very true. All I heard was positive things and personally knew tons of women who had one and said it was virtually painless, just a few cramps. I was hard-pressed to find negative stories online too. So imagine my surprise when I suddenly felt like my uterus was being ripped out from inside my body...

But really, I'm glad there are plenty of women who find this a good option. It just wasn't for me, obviously haha"
AskReddit,fek4zbv,t1_fejrsya,1579192722.0,"Yeah, I mean, if it's not bothering you now, you might as well keep it in until you have to take it out. For me, the removal was painless, but from what I see in the comments, some experienced a lot of pain. I really hope you don't."
AskReddit,fek4pyr,t1_fejqx78,1579192563.0,"Holy crap. I'm speechless. I'm SO sorry that happened to you. I'm glad that doctor lost their license, that could have cost you your life if you had followed their advice. 

My doctor didn't believe me either at first, and told me I just needed to get used to it. But eventually she caved and took it out, thankfully.

Again, I'm so sorry and I really hope you're doing ok."
AskReddit,fek4acb,t1_fejpthd,1579192300.0,"The mental and physical stress just isn't worth it to me. May I ask why you choose an IUD over another method if causes you that much stress before and after? I know it's years between changes, but I personally still don't think it's worth it."
AskReddit,fek40wt,t1_fek20ui,1579192143.0,Really? The removal for me was so easy and painless. I was so traumatized from the insertion that I'll never do it again. I'm just sticking to the pill.
AskReddit,fek3til,t1_fejos5x,1579192021.0,"Oh my God, I was horrified just reading your comment. I'm so sorry you went through that. I was lucky when they took mine out, barely felt a pinch, but that was the only part of that IUD that didnt hurt. Was your cyst from the IUD or something that happened after?"
AskReddit,fej8y3f,t3_epfjje,1579162037.0,"An IUD. I have never been pregnant, but my OBGYN insisted it would be fine. I immediately threw up then fainted twice in the chair from the amount of pain inexperienced having it shoved into my virgin cervix. 

My first period was so painful I had to miss a week of work and couldn't have my heating pad off me for more than 5 minutes. There was a constant jabbing in my left side. By my second period it was the same, so I begged my doctor to take it out. 

To this day, I still get pain in my left side and sex is painful as I get a sharp pain in the same area. She did an ultrasound after it was taken out and she said everything looked normal, but that was years ago and I wonder what lasting damage that thing left in my uterus...

Edit: Someone pointed out that you only hear horror stories about medical related things on the internet, which is typically true. There's always going to be someone who had a negative experience. So, if you were considering getting an IUD, don't let my experience deter you. Talk to your doctor, get a second opinion. If this is your only option for birth control and you're scared, see if they can put you under (I didn't even know it was an option at the time I got mine, but it is according to a few). Bottom line, do what's best for you and don't let this bitter Betty's story stop you from getting what you want/need."

He doesn’t show up to work drunk, not all alcoholics do that. Many are very high functioning. He just does all his drinking after work and on the weekends. 

If you think you’re an alcoholic, I urge you to get help, where ever you feel comfortable getting it from. Whether it’s a friend, AA, therapist, etc. It destroys your body and puts the people that care about you through hell if it gets bad. There are many alcoholics in my family, and this isn’t the first time I’ve had to witness someone I love decline."

AskReddit,fca9y29,t1_fca4tzg,1577565369.0,"Well, he says 3-6 drinks a day, but Iâ€™ve seen how big his drinks are so itâ€™s probably double that. 

He doesnâ€™t show up to work drunk, not all alcoholics do that. Many are very high functioning. He just does all his drinking after work and on the weekends. 

If you think youâ€™re an alcoholic, I urge you to get help, where ever you feel comfortable getting it from. Whether itâ€™s a friend, AA, therapist, etc. It destroys your body and puts the people that care about you through hell if it gets bad. There are many alcoholics in my family, and this isnâ€™t the first time Iâ€™ve had to witness someone I love decline."

AskReddit,fc9x8u6,t3_egtceb,1577559554.0,"Heading to the hospital to see my brother. He had a seizure yesterday from alcohol withdrawal. Theyâ€™re keeping him for a few days because heâ€™s in really bad shape. The worst part is, he wasnâ€™t even trying to stop drinking, he just had less and he doesnâ€™t intend to stop. My family and I are trying to figure out the best way to proceed with some help from Al-Anon. I hate to see the pain my mom is going through right now. And Iâ€™m just in shock trying to keep it together for my mom."
