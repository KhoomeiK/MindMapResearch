Agriculture,ffqhhhe,t3_eunvx1,1580134728.0,"I don't have a real answer for you. Maybe talk to a lawyer or see about ending the contract. If it is in your contract that these practices were not to be used, it should be fairly easy.

I am following this so I can learn from what advice others might have."
menwritingwomen,ffp4jh7,t3_eu6pri,1580086058.0,"My favorite part of her piece is how the struggle is palpable. The bloody is squirting..its not neat, it's not pretty, but the art is full of more strength  and emotion. You can feel the hatred fueled revenge from both women. It's a great piece."

farming,ffj3k04,t1_fff8hrs,1579989493.0,I did this for a university project as well. Well something similar. I thought I read recently many countries in Europe (I think including Finland) were investing in indoor vertical farms. I know Britain and Germany are for a fact.

farming,fff4pvq,t3_etacaw,1579875642.0,"I love urban farming, specifically indoor vertical farming. I cant (as yet) give you those estimates, but I can give you resources: Dr. Dickson Despommier ""The Vertical Farm"" (he also write many articles on this, but this is his book). Contact University of Arizona's Controlled Environment Agriculture department (you can find them on facebook), Contact Cornell university's ag department. Also I think Santa Fe community College has a CEA department (also on FB). Beyond that, you could call Freight Farms (vertical farms in Freight containers) they could give you am estimate on how many people their containers can feed. Or Urban Seed in Las Vegas. (If you want non US contacts I have some of those as well). Also hop on r/hydroponics and r/verticalfarming they may have the answer for you. :)"

AskCulinary,fdvvki1,t3_en4nrl,1578752022.0,"I am sure you have gotten an answer here by now, but I thought I would suggest a reference material, should you need it for other issues.

Shirley Corriher's Cookwise....or Bakewise (I think both have her chocolate chip cookies)....She used to be on Good Eats as Alton's mentor. She is an amazing Food Scientist. So she will address what you should do if you dont want your cookies to spread or if you want crispy or chewier cookies. The books are both amazing, and my go to for figuring out how to fix something if it didnt turn out exactly right."
