happy,feghxwy,t1_feghc3h,1579093320.0,"Really I just asked my friends and coworkers if they would recommend their dentist, then just googled each one. This one actually came from my therapist haha... I will say, they do that annoying thing where you have to pay upfront and then get reimbursed. Thank god for FSA. But they are very kind and do good work."
happy,fegbr53,t1_fegbiil,1579086657.0,"I’m not sure what they called it but it’s basically just an intense cleaning at the moment. The first of many steps... I know eventually I need a root canal redone amongst other things. 

I really have to work on basic care like brushing every day. Which is kind of embarrassing to say... but yeah, depression is a bitch and shows it’s head in weird ways sometimes."
happy,fegb980,t1_fegamcv,1579085989.0,I wish I went earlier but oh well. I have to go back in two weeks for work on the other side.
happy,fegb4rh,t1_feg7p1m,1579085824.0,Get yourself into the Dentist! I know it’s hard but I also know you can do it!
happy,fegb442,t1_feg1fnl,1579085798.0,Thank you!
happy,fegako0,t1_feg7g0h,1579085047.0,"Haha well the gas was helping my mood... but in all seriousness, I’m proud of myself for being able to do it."
happy,fegaiwz,t1_feg154i,1579084979.0,"Omg that does sound awful. I am so sorry that happened. 

I get panic attacks at the Dentist, hence the gas!! I did some research first and found a really good one, I’m glad I did but also wish I did it earlier."
happy,fegafx5,t1_feg049d,1579084861.0,I was on nitrous oxide with half of my mouth numb. The photo seemed like a good idea at the time haha.
