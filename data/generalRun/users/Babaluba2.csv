If I'm on reddit for too long or am looking at web pages in arial, times new roman, calibri, etc, all the strict verticle lines start to really hurt my eyes (especially words with a bunch of like l's f's t's, and i's) and I find since Choco Cooky has more of a loose design, with no letters really ending up straight vertical, it feels better on my eyeballs. Cool Jazz and Rosemary (i think thats the name of the other one) are both a little too jagged for me but Choco Cooky is just right. However, my friend who is dyslexic hates my phone, she said without the circles for the i's and j's it wouldnt be that bad, they don't bother me much but for her she hates it."

confessions,feombvv,t1_feofm49,1579302074.0,"Except this person is a MANDATORY reporter which means that not reporting is literally a crime. For OP its not a case of ""they did what they thought was best"" its ""they literally have to or can go to jail."" Also, you say that CPS just take the kids away but, having talked to people who work with CPS, thats literally the last ditch effort and other care is taken first before it comes to that. Idk what CPS people youve been talking to but they are clearly not doing their job right. The parents get investigated, there are warnings, if a child does have to be taken it is usually for a short time first until the parents can get their shit together (take classes, go to rehab, etc), and then they reuinite the family under close watch. It's not a ""oh, we got a cps call, time to go snatch up kids and rip apart families."" Also I'm gonna go ahead and tell you, go read stories on r/raisedbynarcisists and r/insaneparents, some of these kids would rather die than be with their families anymore because anywhere else is better than being belittled, beaten, abused, screamed at, and driven to potential suicide. I'd say sure, if you can confront the family first yourself then do that, but my god don't shame OP for doing a) the thing theyre LEGALLY REQUIRED to do, and b) something that could potentially save a kids life"
PepTalksWithPops,feksun9,t1_fekrukt,1579206891.0,"Thank you very much! I forget that the car won't stall out if it's in neutral, I get very nervous about stalling out (less now than when I started driving manual). I have definitely been riding the clutch and I'll work on that in the future. While my mom didnt drive a big truck, my grandfather did and he is who taught her how to drive manual so that certainly makes sense :] Hopefully I haven't done too much damage to the clutch, I probably should have asked that question a long time ago but I didn't really think about it until recently"
PepTalksWithPops,fekqsi7,t1_fekipir,1579205685.0,"Well now I'm confused lol So is it or is it not okay to push in the clutch while costing? What I currently do: Lets say I'm in 4th and I see a stop sign. I will shift out of gear, push the clutch in while also pressing in the break lightly. When I get to the sign I will stop, shift into first, start it up with gas and clutch and when the engine starts I'll pull entirely off the clutch and put my foot on the rest. There is no revving. Is that okay? I know that when I pull to a stop I need the clutch in or I will stall out. I guess I'm asking when should I or should I not have the clutch in? What counts as ""using"" the clutch? I don't keep my foot on the clutch when I'm accelerating, only when I'm stopping or shifting (both of which I take my foot completely off the gas to push in the clutch)

Half the time they don't cover whatever flu happens to go around that season. I don't get it anymore because with it and without it it never fails that I get the flu. I tried it off and on for years, it hasn't helped me one bit so I stopped getting it, save myself the annoying flu like symptoms you can get after you get the shot because it never fails that I'll get the flu anyway.

rant,feeo56q,t1_fee5de8,1579037704.0,"Please don't get a shock collar unless you have exhausted all other options, especially if your dog is smaller. My uncle got one for his dog, a bark collar for a smaller dog, it malfunctioned while he was away at work and it killed the dog because it shocked the dog at the highest setting nonstop until the battery died. Even with normal use they can cause inflamed necks. And if you do get one, get one with multiple settings and use it on the lowest possible one, test it on yourself and decide if you want that feeling on your dog."
rant,feenpww,t1_fee05j7,1579037458.0,"Using a shock collar should be a last resort as positive reinforcement is infinitely better than negative, and even as negative enforcement goes theres usually better options. Also, it can and will definitely hurt a dog, especially if you don't test it on yourself first. A lot of people slap a collar on a dog and don't test it, they just crank it up and throw it on because they are told it won't hurt them. A shock for a jack russel is a lot different than a shock for a great dane, there's no catch all shock setting. The whole thought behind shock collars is for the dog to relate their behavior with a negative and uncomfortable feeling, which means it's obviously not gonna be patting them on the head, and it can cause health issues like inflamed necks.

If you do get a shock collar always get one with multiple settings and always start on the lowest possible setting, normally that's enough and the others are simply overkill. Yes there are dogs who will power through even the maximum settings but that's a pretty major sign that shock collar training isn't for your dog. At that point just try something else, don't keep getting stronger devices (yes I've seen people do this).

Also, don't ever leave the collars on your dog when you are gone or they are unsupervised. They can malfunction. The results can be deadly. I highly recommend using literally any other options before an electronic collar that can potentially kill your dog if it malfunctions."

I know I want to have the future be better and easier for my children and future generations specifically so they dont have to deal with the annoyances and hardships that I may have dealt with. As an example, the world is more connected now than it was when my mom was a kid in the 70s. I'm able to talk to friends every day and see them face to face even when they live in other states, and I can do it at any time on my phone! That's a world my mom dreamed to live in, she lost so many good friends because of travel and now she doesn't know how she would even start to reconnect. She's happy to see that technology can keep friendships from dying now like they used to in the 70s. A phone call is good but it's totally different seeing the face of the person you are talking to.

TrueOffMyChest,fe0q23b,t1_fe0ejnr,1578817324.0,"Yeah, to a company all that matters is that you remember the name because if you remember the name either a) you are likely to remember it in the future and buy the product, b) you will talk about the product, whether in a negative or positive light and that will get the name into other peoples heads, and c) you may unintentionally share the product online, again negative or positive doesnt matter, and it will spread farther and farther causing more people to look into it and remember the name. It's shitty but it works a lot of the time, sadly, which makes them continue to do it in the future."
aww,fdyu1yr,t1_fdyovhy,1578783572.0,"Exactly, some dogs really do just need it. Half the people who say tail docking should never ever be done to a dog in any circumstance hasn't seen a dog who has hit their tail so hard against things that it is battered, broken, brused, and sometimes even gashed open and bleeding. I get not wanting any dog to have its tail docked and it should always be a last ditch effort, but sometimes its impossible to avoid and some people just gotta know that. Boxers are real bad about smacking their tails against things until they break and bleed everywhere, break it too many times and slice it open too many times and there's so many chances of infection and complete nerve damage (which only perpetuates the problem, dog can't feel the tail hitting things, dog doesn't know it's hurt, dog keeps whacking bloody broken tail on things), it results in the tail just needing to be docked. It sucks, but it's a sad reality for some people and their dogs and ultimately it leads to a happier life for the dog than constantly breaking it's tail"

[It's pretty well known that it's a fear and stress related response](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_death#Tonic_immobility_as_a_scientific_tool). In sharks it could be related to mating but they found elevated stress levels, it's not like the majority of animal sex is slow and romantic. Possums do it, frogs do it, prey snakes do it, it's also called ""playing dead"" in a lot of animals. Animals don't really play dead if theyre having a good time.

Either way, even if it was just vertigo from being in an unnatural position. its not exactly the nicest thing. Whether it's a fear response or their balance being thrown off to the point that they get vertigo and freeze, it's still not something that you'd want to have done to you so I wouldn't really encourage others to do it. Chickens can be stuck like that for up to 30 minutes. Sharks for 15."
aww,fdxbhyf,t1_fdw2wlc,1578767192.0,"Please don't do either of those, what you are doing is causing Tonic Mobility in the animal which is basically a total body fear response to a threat. You are making the animal think it is going to die."
aww,fdxbc02,t1_fdwj9kv,1578767144.0,"Idk if I'm being whooshed but please don't do those. The line in the sand thing is you convincing the chicken that it's seeing a snake coming after it and it's paralyzing itself in total fear. You are making the chicken think it's going to die. I don't know about the other twirling thing but it's likely similar. Most 'hypnosis' tricks with animals are activating tonic immobility which is an extreme fear response to a percieved threat

aww,fdx82nm,t1_fdw9jkg,1578766241.0,"Some dog breed benefit from trimmed ears and docked tails, but the vast majority of the time nowadays they're entirely unneeded. Sometimes pitbulls have their tails docked if they get happy tail syndrome (where their tails wag so hard or hit things so hard that they break and become mangled), but unless it's a working dog or a dog with chronic severe ear infections/happy tail syndrome, theres likely no need to dock tails or ears and it's purely aesthetic. Thankfully unnecesary docking has seen a decline in recent years!

Took 1 minute but changed everyones world each time.

She had absolutely no idea she was getting it and when I brought it out all wrapped up (after everyone opened presents) she was still totally clueless. She opened it and borderline sobbed in happiness. I haven't seen my mom cry in a long time, probably since my dad died, and for her to be crying in happiness made it so worth it. Shes such a wonderful woman and she deserves that camera so much. She has been saving pennies every time she does the savings catcher at walmart and was hoping to save up enough for a camera some day, I think she has at most 100$ after two or so years of saving on that thing. Shes taking that money instead and buying all kinds of lenses and such. 

As for what would make me happy enough to cry, I have a dream to open a senior and special needs dog sanctuary one day and while obviously someone can't do that for me, I'd be so happy to see someone donate to an existing sanctuary.

It got better when I started sleeping with my boyfriend and I wasn't so anxious all night, but it still took me like 2 hours most nights to get to sleep. I'd been eyeing up weighted blankets at stores and for Christmas I got a weighted blanket. I've been sleeping with it and im able to fall asleep in like 20-45 minutes which is a miracle compared to 2 hours before. I wake up feeling well rested and less groggy and I'm even able to get a little bit less sleep because I feel so refreshed. Last night I got around 6.5-7 hours of sleep and I felt wonderful! In total it's saved me close to 3 hours of my day between the hour to two hours I'm saving by falling asleep faster and the hour earlier I'm able to wake up and feel refreshed! 

As for the thing that most people are worried about, the breathability of it, I'm able to sleep under my sheets (temperature regulated, would recommend because they are wonderful too), the weighted blanket, and my thin comforter, and I'm totally comfortable :] the brand I have is Odyssey and it's 20 pounds I believe, highly recommend.

Sometimes one side can just be shitty. Drugs and alcohol fuck people up and that's not your fault if your partner gets caught up in it and accepts no help. I've seen multiple loving relationships fall apart because a partner got hooked on drugs. The other partner tries to get them help but they dont accept it because ""theyre fine, theres no problems"". There can be a lot of ourside factors that affect a relationship, you dont marry and get put in a bubble with your partner forever. I agree a lot of the time it's both parties and you need both sides of the story, but certainly not always."
rant,fc3dlul,t1_fc3bdhz,1577387455.0,"What I'm saying is that you can't just know a relationship didn't already have multiple bandages on it before it fell apart. Older people regularly didnt have the option to leave a relationship, it wasn't a case of working it out or ""fixing something that was broken"", they werent ""better at marriages"", it was ignoring the problems because you can't afford to separate. My grandmother was held at gunpoint by my grandfather and it wasn't love that kept her there. It was fear of him, of society, of not having a plan to fall back on. Having talked to people at nursing homes, she's not the only one. Men and women alike had shit marriages that they stayed in because there wasn't a net to fall back on. A lot of times the 'perfect marriage' was terrible behind closed doors and the widows regretted staying in it so long.

Sure, there are people that will gold dig and marry everychance they get and divorce when they find a more wealthy target but thats not often and shouldn't be basis for shaming people these days from getting out of loveless relationships when the bandages arent fixing it up instead of socially shaming them to stay."
rant,fc3bhkn,t1_fc32dc1,1577386105.0,"Shit changes, people change. You can only work it out so long. If you have a kid and your partner becomes a raving and abusive alcoholic who wont accept help and is a danger to you and your child, are you gonna stick with them? If you get married and your partner becomesa serial cheater who wont listen to you and is away more often than home, you gonna stick with them? You get married and your partner doesnt pull their weight and has no intentions of doing so, expecting you to do all the work so they can sit on their ass, you staying with them?  All stories I've heard from widowed elderly people talkingabout their past marriages where they were married for 50+ years. They hated it, they regretted it, but it was their only options at the time. You can't possibly know every couples story when they are getting a divorce, a lot of times it isn't just ""a rough spot"", it's years of ""rough spots"" and unhappiness with no clear end in sight. Never take away someone's option to leave, you get one life and shaming people because they left someone they no longer loved for whatever reason is wrong."
rant,fc39nvv,t1_fc30wb2,1577384830.0,"Yes our grandparents and great grandparents also came from a time where divorce was very highly frowned upon and image was everything. Yes there are absolutely wonderful marriages that got to be older because they truly loved each other and wanted to grow old together, but theres also shit marriages where the only reason one stayed was because they had no options. They stayed in terrible relationships where they hated each other not because they wanted to but because they socially had to. Divorce was social suicide, family was little help, there wasn't an abundance of help out there for people in abusive relationships. Yes, absolutely try to work things out, but dear god if your wife/husband belittles you, beats you, rapes you, and some other shit I've regularly heard older people talk about in their marriages, then LEAVE THEM, that shit ain't gonna stop, and for older people in those shit relationships it never did. They turned into an alcoholic after marriage and a once wonderful person becomes abusive? They aren't accepting any help with their problems and become colder and colder by the day? LEAVE THEM.  You get older, decide to have kids, they are abusive to your children? They won't accept going to therapy because they are ""fine parents""? LEAVE THEM. This shit happens and it was normal  back when our grandparents were alive and they didn'tleave when they could or should have. you can only work things out so far. You have one life and it's not worth staying in an abusive relationship hating yourself and your partner the whole time. Also it's literally not like people today don't also stay in marriages"

If we can find one toy with an intact and readable tag it'd be a lot easier to find what line of toys they are and find the right size"
rant,fbyukd2,t1_fbyggmf,1577226725.0,"Having grown up in basically a nudist house, can confirm that nudity really just becomes the norm and it doesnt bother you.  My mom was naked damn near every minute she could be in the house growing up, my dad wore just his briefs. It was just kinda the norm, nothing was sexualized we just didn't wear clothes around the house. My dad passed away when I was 10 and I just kinda became a self conscious recluse but before then, while I always wore underwear, it wasnt uncommon for me to romp about with no pants while playing on the computer. I rarely wore shirts at home up until maybe 8. I also had a fear of showers from the age of 7 to 8 (aunt made me watch Jaws, I was a scaredy cat) so I had my mom or dad come in sometimes to wash my hair (so I could keep my eyes out for sharks in the drain) and none of it was weird. It's just a different way of growing up. My mom lives alone and is still a nudist and its still not weird to me and I'm 21. A body is just a body unless you get weird about it."
AskReddit,fbwvjoq,t3_eekte9,1577160573.0,"I have always, always, always wanted to open a senior and special needs dog sanctuary and name it after my senior dog who passed away last year. I have everything planned out, I want it to be able to help so many people.  I've planned ways for it to bring the community together. I want to buy the two fields next to my mother's house, reinforce the fencing a ton (concrete going at least a foot below and multiple feet across so dogs won't be able to easily dig under, strong fencing, security cameras because sometimes people suck), build multiple buildings (at least large one for dog housing, the rest could come later, but just to make sure theres lots of shelter and space for dog care), and take in as many dogs as possible. I would have a therapy dog program with a range of dogs, train them and allow them to be therapy dogs for local colleges, senior centers, hospitals, and librarys (theres programs where kids get comfortable reading out loud by reading to dogs). I would work with the local highschool and colleges engingeering/robotics classes and see if they could help build things like wheel chairs and 3d printing prosthetics (obviously I could use donations to help cover costs but ideally I could cover costs myself). I could have local Beta club and NHS members have the option to volunteer at the sanctuary with things like washing dogs and adoption events. I could hire some help, offer jobs to the community as best I can. I have everything planned out, I want to do it so bad, but money is a major issue to get started and I'm not sure it's an issue I'll ever be able to overcome. I don't have a lot of goals in life, a dog sanctuary is my highest goal. After getting my senior and special needs dog (she was previously abused and neglected for most of her life, they never thought she'd make it) I realized just how much life they still have to live.  We took her to the vet, fixed her up, and she was a whole new dog. She lived a happy life, no one guessed she was 18, she could jump as high as my hip as a chihuahua. I loved her so much and I want nothing more than to give other dogs that chance at a happy life."
