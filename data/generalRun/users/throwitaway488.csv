corvallis,ffnss27,t3_eu4e8e,1580070308.0,"I saw it once during a special event hosted there but otherwise not really. 

Along the same lines, is there anywhere in town with a fireplace? Like a coffee shop or something, where I could hang out and read or do work by a cozy fire?"

OregonStateUniv,ffctv4z,t3_espco9,1579807151.0,There are private practice rooms with pianos in the MU ballroom (they are in a side area that closes off). They kinda suck though. You could always try to find a cheap keyboard on craigslist or the thrift shops if you're desperate.

corvallis,ff2d5zc,t3_er8n6t,1579501375.0,Heidi with Kitty Meow Meow sitting is awesome. She watches my cat while Im away and texts pictures every time she visits. Shes great.

todayilearned,ff04noy,t1_fezydsc,1579465188.0,"extending that explanation of ""no""; ""jigoku no kaze"" literally translated is essentially ""Hell's wind"" or more directly wind of hell (its written reverse of the western way, ie [hell] no [wind]). It's indicates possession of the second thing by the first thing (among other grammar uses)."
todayilearned,ff043ph,t1_fezte95,1579464973.0,Albert Einstein was a socialist too. Funny how they tend to leave that part out...
anime,fepr0v7,t1_feppc2t,1579328375.0,it gets really fucking weird. still good though
corvallis,feo8kqs,t1_feo3ii1,1579296604.0,"The root problem is that pedestrians are trying to cross a major highway. The structure of the town requires that a large amount of traffic can pass through there. It is already a major site of congestion. Pretending that people don't need to drive through a major access point to town is ""warped"" in the same way."
OregonStateUniv,feo2t2f,t3_eq61kk,1579294344.0,They are just going for school spirit with the orange. Be grateful the other one isn't black.
anime,fenykon,t1_fenmma3,1579292650.0,"Yes that is true, but I meant that in interviews Tsukushi said that he had more ideas for the 3rd level but he had to skip them because people were losing interest in the manga. He skipped faster so that he could get to more exciting parts in level 4."
anime,fenkk6q,t1_fen25m3,1579286670.0,Yea but Tsukushi skipped nearly all of the 3rd level in the interest of getting to good stuff. It wouldn't be too surprising to jump forward in the story a bit.
corvallis,fenhbnt,t1_fek1jmj,1579284689.0,It is a highway. They should instead add a pedestrian bridge or tunnel to cross it.
labrats,fem7e2l,t3_epuyq1,1579242419.0,"It's changing in that new undergrad programs are popping up in areas such as computational biology, biological data science, etc. Core majors such as biology probably wont change as much but might add in informatics or programming classes as electives or even core classes."

AskReddit,felht2z,t1_felg0gl,1579222503.0, If you don't like celery texture then celeriac is awesome. Its a big root that smells and tastes like celery but with the texture of a potato or turnip. Its amazing in soup.

Miyazaki,feeh43p,t3_eol19k,1579033635.0,"Of all the Ghibli movies to get a live action, this one seems like it has the best chance of working. The story is almost entirely real people doing normal things as opposed to ""magical"" or fantastical elements. It's a really sweet story that I could possibly see being good."

corvallis,feagmwe,t3_enxgvn,1578948544.0,There is an art supply store (or at least used to be) inside the building with the Starbucks downtown. I seem to remember seeing inks and nibs and supplies there.
anime,fe5xv9c,t1_fe3kzrr,1578877374.0,"You aren't wrong, but anime usually has super over-acted voice work too. Its just less noticeable since its in a foreign language. 

I hate dubs for how cheesy they sound, but the more I've watched subs I've realized the Japanese VAs are often just as over the top."

VirginiaTech,fdl09jc,t1_fdkxapj,1578514766.0,Yea I don't follow football much but that does seem kinda weird to leave the NFL for college. Unless he thinks hes got a better chance moving up to a more head coach-like position in college?
anime,fdj9a40,t1_fdixdjx,1578462170.0,"was going to post Spice and Wolf if noone else did. I usually hate dubs but that one feels more ""authentic"" to the setting. Steins;gate and Ouran High School Host Club have a good dub too."
