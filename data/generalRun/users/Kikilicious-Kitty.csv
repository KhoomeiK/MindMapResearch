TalesFromYourServer,ffj3eq3,t1_ffik2pb,1579989387.0,"I work at everyone's favorite emo store in the mall. We had moved our line for Black Friday last year in 2018 to better keep our main aisles clear, and it's been in the same spot since.

Almost every. single. person. lines up in the wrong spot. We have our hanging sign, my manager made a sign saying ""if you can read this you're not in line"", and I even height some cheap fairy lights and wrapped them around that sign. People still ignore it.

When people line up in the wrong spot, we have to redirect them to the actual line. When the customer looks at us like we're dumb, or look exasperated because they waited in the wrong spot and ""they've been here waiting"" I like to say ""if anyone is in line it's under the line up sign with the flashing lights"" to point out their lack of awareness."

He's absolutely disgusted with himself. He's not only acting like the common folk, he's even falling for someone he considers subhuman. You can feel his self loathing and his desire raging against one another.

I know in the book he's quite a bit different, but Disney really hit the nail on the head with him. Gaston kinda has the same vibe, but Frollo had an unsettling realism to him that sets him apart.

Yorkie's are also kind of considered ""prissy"" and purse dogs for the kind of ""rich bitch"" stereotype. Also, Charlie really likes cats, especially compared to the others. Remember how he talked about gluing cat hair to the back of his neck and walking around like a cat man in the night?"
