AnimalsBeingJerks,fek0hya,t1_fek07kb,1579189982.0,"I’ve owned a cat and have never just dropped it from a height. Even though, yes, it does land on its feet. It’s just an asshole thing to do, when you can pick it up and set it down somewhere else or the ground. 

Ive also never had to use a spray bottle on my cat, either. There are other ways of training an animal that won’t be a negative experience for it."

funny,fdrw5z8,t3_emufa2,1578690677.0,"So funny story, when I was a kid I thought A1 was Al. Like as in Albert. My family and I were at a restaurant and I said “Pass me the Al, please” and they just looked at me like I was crazy. I pointed to the A1 and very matter-of-factly said “THE AL PLEASE” and my whole family proceeded to laugh their asses off. 

“It’s called A1, honey.”

Needless to say, ever since then, the whole family calls A1, Al."
