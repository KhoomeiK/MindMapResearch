movies,feyc98e,t1_fey7o4i,1579443647.0,"Thousands of years in the future the most important substance is Spice.

Spice extends life. Spice expands consciousness. Spice is a vital component for Guild Navigators to be able to fold space with their minds so they can navigate their spaceships. Spice is produced and exists on one single planet, Arakis. Due to it being a desert planet, it is commonly called Dune.

A prince, Leto Atreides, from a rising noble house is assigned governorship of Arakis. This is a highly prestigious position for both physical and political wealth. The Emperor of the Universe and the rival house, the Harkonnens, plot to murder Leto and his family to seize control of Arakis and stop the rising popularity of house Atreides.

Leto’s son, Paul Atreides, is the main character and Dune covers the fall of his family and his rise to power.

There’s more, but I’m trying to figure out how to explain the Bene Gesserit and the Bene Tleilax. The idea that memory is chemical and can be passed on genetically is an important idea in the series as well."

The solution isn’t just “have kids” either. Have kids how? With what job or housing? Our problems up here are many and our solutions few. Our declining population should be an item of concern for the 2020 State elections."

As for your sister, I would just stick with the facts. If she can’t or won’t understand that then just keep her at arm’s distance. You haven’t done anything wrong and it’s really shitty that you are being dragged back into this drama."
