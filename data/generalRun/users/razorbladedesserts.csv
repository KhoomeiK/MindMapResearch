White male infants as a whole are the weakest.  All things being equal, if I have two NICU babies that are the same gestational age and in the exact same environment, the white male will be sicker and more likely to develop complications.  Their lungs are usually less developed and get junky.  They will have longer stays in the NICU on average.

I have strengths but they don’t make up for the weaknesses.  I had a famous author tell me he had nothing to teach me at 19... that I wrote comparable to other famous non-fiction authors.  But I struggle with math.  I struggle with motivation.  While I have a career it is just beginning at 36.  My kids make all A’s pretty effortlessly but they don’t feel smart either.  They get so nervous about tests and honor societies and things... I have never once pressured them about these things because I know what that does to a kid. (My parents were very grade focused).  I have said if they bring home a C we will get a tutor because I don’t want them to miss something small now in classes that build on each other. But I know how they feel when this paper says they have an A but they don’t feel like any of the work is clicking in their heads. When they really only care about what they care about.. for my daughter that’s art and band, for my son it’s computers and coding.  

The trick is to know this:  you buy a degree.  It’s a business transaction.  People who don’t know to look down in the rain have MD’s and some of the most brilliant minds you’ll ever meet didn’t finish high school.. because it weighed on things that didn’t stimulate them or motivate them.  My grandfather was one of those.. he ended in upper management making six figures with an 8th grade education.  He left school because his family was poor and he needed to work.  People who met him thought he was highly educated because he was exceedingly bright but he applied it always to the things that mattered and interested him.

todayilearned,ffjr0zs,t1_ffj6ux7,1580004703.0,"Killing in the off season is bad because it affects breeding and growing.  If you kill the deer before they’re able to breed or their babies to grow up, you could impact the population growth.. which has to happen for there to be deer to hunt in the season.  Lots of people rely on deer to eat to live, so that affects the available food supply for the people.

Leaving a headless body brings in scavengers.  Can spread disease.

Spotlighting, baiting, etc. stops a deer from seeing the obvious danger or being able to escape.. which is just a bullshit tactic for a hunter.  They regulate the weapons used to make sure you don’t either maim the animal but leave it alive, or totally obliterate the animal where it’s not able to process... because people eat deer meat.
Like, my family almost exclusively eats deer we have hunted ethically, chicken from my father’s farm, and vegetables we grow and can/freeze each year.  The initial investment to get those started is quickly made up by the amount we save on grocery bills.

Some people think hunting is cruel but honestly hunters are very active in conservation.  Ethical hunters don’t kill babies, don’t kill for trophies, don’t waste the meat, and often replant good grass for the animals to eat in the off season.  They leave the woods as they found them, and don’t take more than they need to survive.  I know that isn’t everybody."

I’m not gay, but I voted in favor of gay marriage.  Why? Because why on earth should I get a say in what consenting adults do in their relationship... I wouldn’t appreciate their input in mine.

I would never have an abortion.  But I also work in the medical field and I don’t EVER want to be the person treating a minor with a perforated uterus or sepsis from a dirty illegal procedure when we can provide it clean and safely.  I will never be the one that has to give up my life to raise someone else’s child.  Why should I get to decide that?

People can live their lives in their homes any way they choose so long as they don’t infringe on MY RIGHTS.  Because that’s what the law says.  If people worried less about everyone else and more about their own I suspect we would be a lot better off.

Sorry.  It just infuriated me how nobody thinks further than the end of their own nose.  Protecting others rights doesn’t take away from your own."

After that I lost contact with him.  The way he can fully immerse a reader into his experiences is incredible, though.  He and his wife wrote a book together about their marriage issues and it was so raw.  I read it again when I had my own marriage fall apart and the way that man captures a moment is amazing.  To think someone that talented thought that I was a gifted writer myself is more than flattering.  I do still write. I keep journals and think of writing about my own experiences often.  My life has been nothing short of tumultuous so I have plenty of material.  I really should take the time and actually begin putting it together.
