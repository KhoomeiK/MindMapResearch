AmItheAsshole,fgnnxds,t1_fgnjx9o,1580949015.0,They are starting things young nowadays. My niece had work starting at 8 because she had a very narrow upper jaw. They put a spreader in to move her upper teeth apart for a year or so. If they had waited until she was older it wouldn't have worked as well and they would have had a much smaller window of time to do it while the bones were growing and shifting. Braces came a few years after that.
AmItheAsshole,fgnnb3s,t1_fgnkvah,1580948606.0,"I don't care how slow your metabolism is, that's incredibly unprofessional especially at your stage of the game. You did a shitty tat that sounds like it's worse than a prison tat, while drinking. Sounds like your admission  of ""...the stencil gets faint and it's really hard for me to keep focusing"" means the beer was effecting you more than you would like to admit. If word gets around (from not only the girl but also everyone else at the party) you're gonna have a hard time getting clientele. You may have just killed off any career you had dreams of. YTA"
AmItheAsshole,fgnk0ua,t3_eziawj,1580946472.0,"NTA This guy is a pervert and is trying everything even claiming he has health issues to get his rocks off. If he was truly sorry he would have said he apologized without bringing up one more game. 

If you're in contact with any of the DnD group rat him out and ask them what's up with him harassing you with this death story to get his rocks off. His story about getting kicked out might be a lie also. If they are good people maybe they will kick him out for real. 

This is manipulation and quite honestly sexual harassment. I guarantee if you did play one more game he would just pressure you for another. I guarantee his end game is to get you in bed whether he admits it or not. This is all about power to him, him forcing people to bow to his wants and him getting his way. It's pathetic and disgusting. He targeted you because he recognized you had self esteem issues that he could exploit and manipulate. It honestly wouldn't hurt to go to your local police station and ask if he's committed a crime with his continual contact. If he hasn't at least they can give you tips on the proper things to say when you ghost him, which texts to save for your records and how to protect yourself on and offline. Good luck!"
AmItheAsshole,fgnhwqx,t3_ezibdc,1580945245.0,"It's not a big deal. Unless they've changed it since I was confirmed into my small town Methodist Church...I assume they all always follow the same steps. A group of us went up in front of a regular Sunday service and said ""I will"" once or a few times, turned around and people applause. It can be a little nerve racking if you're a shy person. I think there was a little buffet afterwards. And if you want to switch churches or religions later on it's not like you have to go up and officially revoke anything or turn your methodist card in. To be honest it really doesn't mean much of anything and it's not against anyones law to join/be confirmed at several churches during your life. It's more for something to make the parents happy and excited. 

Sounds like your church is tripping over itself trying to get kids in and coming off as creepy because of it. I ditched another church (a New Life church) in my later teens because of that. They had a awesome youth group but rotated out youth pastors and the new ones were part ""trying too hard"" and part ""rules nazis"". 

NTA btw"

AmItheAsshole,fgmthal,t1_fgmsw87,1580931721.0,You said last month you resigned from your job and then later in a comment said you were two months (70 days) behind on the car.
AmItheAsshole,fgmsvrs,t3_eze0k6,1580931375.0,"We had a neighbor across the street from us that used to screech at her husband all the time when I was a kid, and my brother has a neighbor across the street and down two houses that yells a lot. Guess what? The whole neighborhood knew exactly what their business even in the winter with the windows closed because they could out scream the windows. Tell your wife she's embarrassing herself. NTA"
AmItheAsshole,fgmsb2g,t3_eze110,1580931037.0,"So you quit your job knowing you were already one month pass due with the car payment? And you admit you didn't tell your husband how far behind you guys were with the bills but you claim you tried to get him to sit down and talk about the bills. Honestly it's sounds like you didn't try too hard or you were lying to him. I mean how hard is it to say ""we are about to lose the car if we don't talk about this today!""?

You're not the ass for wanting your husband to take more responsibility. 

I'm going to have to say you are the ass for saying it's partly his fault for ""not giving me more money for the bills?"" because lies were perpetrated on your part. 

 As far as ""AITA for saying he's going to far by basically cutting me off financially saying he regrets supporting me?""... You apparently lied to him (you've admitted you never told him how far behind with the car you were), and you quit your job while leading him to believe that everything was fine with the finances or at least the car.  Yes, you say you told him you needed more money to cover the bills but if everything has been fine with the money you had been using so far he probably blew you off thinking that you wanted it for something other than the bills. You claim you have been covering the bills with your paycheck leaving you with nothing while apparently he had some funds. You guys have way bigger problems than what can be solved on Reddit. He's selfish and you lie. ESH"
AmItheAsshole,fgmp77n,t3_eze355,1580929219.0,"Yes, you are the ass for lying so much. My question is your psychologist actually doing therapy with you or are they just asking basic questions about how your doing with your medication every week? You might need a better therapist who does more cognitive work with you. I understand your position but I also understand your husband's if you desperately need the second paycheck. He's worried about finances and might be wondering if some days are more about watching tv then depression. It seems like you need to look into maybe adding something new on top of what you're already doing. NAH"

TooAfraidToAsk,fgm76hu,t3_eyxykh,1580919247.0,"I watched the game with people who find Shakira hot and sexy. One did mention that JLo's outfit seemed a bit less than necessary, but that was the only comment in the negative for the whole thing. As I said they like skimpy outfits so if they though it was skimpy for a family show (NFL bills itself as family entertainment) it's saying something. I did actually say the NFL probably felt they had to keep up somewhat with the standards that ""nipplegate"" set years ago (which I feel was staged and someone in the NFL approved it). It must be tough for the NFL to want to be hip and exciting while trying to be a family show all at the same time. lol. 

No one in my group was upset."
AmItheAsshole,fgm5gf1,t3_eyy12i,1580918325.0,"I'm personally a fan of shutting the gossiping bullshit down fast. You're in a small town, how fast would it have gotten around that your mentor was going to make a killing selling a building with this woman running her mouth to everyone who comes in? How fast would it have gotten around if people thought she had an inside scoop to facts instead of just her opinion? How fast would it have warped into your mentor was cheating them and then warped into he cheats everyone and is just a rich dude that cares nothing about the community? NTA Fuck her and her gossiping. If you see her again feel free to call her a coward for gossiping and lying behind people's backs."
AmItheAsshole,fgm3rz3,t3_eyy25z,1580917472.0,"It honestly sounds like he was just trying to make small talk with possibly one of the few people in the building who would talk to him.  Granted , it's not very professional of him (maybe he's a Midwest talker) but a lot of people think it's beneath them to talk to doormen and other service professionals. If all he said was ""I guess it's almost Valentine's Day!"" without any leering or weird body language i don't personally see it as offensive, but you did the right thing by saying it was for your sister's bday. Did you see him after that? Maybe he would have apologized. 

I will say if you complain about people to management you do need to spell out in your complaint what you expect as a result. In this case you would have said that you in no way, shape or form want him fired but only for someone to please speak to him about making what seems like personal comments about your packages to you. Management has no idea what the person complaining expects unless they verbalize it. If you're really worried about him maybe get back in contact with management and tell them this if you didn't already. You also have to understand that maybe you weren't the only one to complain and maybe they've had other types of issues with him. In most cases a person isn't fired on the first offense unless it's really bad like stealing or assault. 

I want to say Everyone Sucks Here because you really should have tried to talk to him or written him a note that you were uncomfortable with the constant comments on your packages before going to management, but I understand confronting people can make you nervous. I'm going with NTA but leaning towards Everyone Sucks."
AmItheAsshole,fgm066e,t3_eyy39f,1580915163.0,You owe them nothing if the boss is that bad. Give them a two week notice if you feel guilty. Tell them the truth about why you're leaving if he cops an attitude. NTA

It's really hard at times. I'm still struggling to find a news outlet that can just report the facts and all the facts fairly (not just one side while ignoring the other) and if there is an opinion piece to very clearly announce it as an opinion instead of disguising it as news. So far the BBC seem to be the *most* honest I've found."
