Locals can't live in their cities anymore, as their low salaries can't pay the increased housing rates. Many local councils discuss banning/ making a max limit on AirBnB's etc."
getdisciplined,ff9is4d,t3_es7su4,1579713901.0,"I was once you.  
I can therefor relate.  
Here's what I'd do:

Move out from your sister's condo.  
Move to the city. Commute 45 mins every day to work. Listen to podcasts and audio-books while you do. Perhaps language courses too.

Spend the evenings offline and outside the flat. You'll automatically interact with people.  
Go home to your parents to dine only 1-2 times per week, max.  
See how quickly your social life expands this way.

In the meantime, before moving away from your family, spend the weekends at hotels in the city - or even in OTHER cities! Do NOT bring your laptop! Treat yourself with a weekend very different and much better than how you spend your working days!

Good luck, bro - we are many rooting for you!"
