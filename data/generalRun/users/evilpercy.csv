Libertarian,ffgj3eq,t1_fffs6au,1579907400.0,"And he would disagree with you. You are still stuck on the Bob paid $100 and Jan paid $50. So bob pays the most in taxes. But bob earned $100,000 and has a net worth of $700,000 in asset of property and stocks. Jan makes $28,000 a year and has a net worth -$5,000. So who actually paid more? You will say Bob. And point to the $100 bill on the table and the $50 bill.  Your though is also that if Jan and Bob get caught speeding they both get a $100 ticket, so it is fair. But it is a deterrent for Jan not to speed but to Bob it is the cost of speeding. Bob paid the ticket the next day. Jan could not afford to pay it this month due to other expences like rent. Then next month the car broke down. Interest and fees are added to Jan's original ticket. Now she owes $150. This continues from month to month she now owes $300 and has to go to a quick loan place to pay the ticket. This will compound the cost of the original ticket. So who paid more? Both got a $100 ticket."
