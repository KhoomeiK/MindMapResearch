As someone who is a scientist who studies panther, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls lions panthers. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""panther family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Panthera, which includes things from Bengal tigers to snow leopard.
