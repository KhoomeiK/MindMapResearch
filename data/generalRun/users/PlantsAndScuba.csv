science,fft049l,t1_ffs3411,1580200020.0,"I think they've set a certain amount of time they're willing to spend on the job and do the best job they can within that timeframe. They don't ""care"" meaning that they don't care if they don't meet the expectations set by admin and parents of what should be accomplished because those expectations are literally impossible given a 40 hour workweek. 

In my opinion this is the right attitude to have. The burden shouldn't be put on teachers to work more than that any more than any other career should have to worl more than that. If admin and parents demand teachers do more than that then they need to pay for more teachers so there can be additional prep periods so teachers have more time to meet those expectations. 

These are also the teachers that have found a system that works for them and their students. They dont freak out and change anything dramatically every 5 years when there is new admin demanding structural changes based on the latest fashionable research. They stick with what works and go home to their family. 

They care, just within the required 40 hours they're being paid to care."

science,ffhgaz9,t1_fffqce3,1579934004.0,"Just went through teacher school at a ""well respected national program"" and this is exactly how I felt. They kept telling me that this is a hard science yet when I read any methodology of all the academic articles they had us read, it felt like it was nothing more than a ""case study"" where a professor observed a classroom and made a bunch of conclusions from their observations. That is not hard science and is it replicable. It can be a piece of evidence in an argument sure, but the way these articles were treated like gospel Is ridiculous and gives science a bad name. Not that the authors of these academic articles aren't trying hard to solve real classroom problems, but they're giving an impossible subject to study. A classroom is a group people that all have different personal backgrounds, cultures, abilities, prior knowledge etc. and any study done in one classroom is not going to replicable in another."
SeattleWA,ffe76fu,t1_ffdhz0j,1579838523.0,MLK jr. Was imprisoned 29 times. I'm NOT saying this guy is MLk lol. Just saying that we should look at arrest history in detail and not just assume that a high number of arrests = dangerous person.

todayilearned,ff8r273,t1_ff8lhrw,1579692607.0,Are we talking about the same pyramids? The largest ones from Egypt are less than 5k years old .
worldnews,ff3reml,t1_ff3puyc,1579547223.0,Primarily automation. Those other factors you've mentioned have both historically increased and decreased at different times without huge swings in productivity like we've seen in the last half century.

Aquariums,feutla5,t1_feusx0l,1579389751.0,Thanks! Found it local at a beach here that has lots of driftwood. I was originally going to attach an orchid to it.

Maybe you should ask them."
politics,fdah69k,t1_fdad719,1578246092.0,"Do you think it is relevant for the lgtbq students in the classroom to hear that historical actors shared their identity, making them feel represented? It may not be relevant to you, but may be to others. Does that warrant 10  seconds of mentioning it?"
politics,fdabg85,t1_fdaagj2,1578244120.0,"Those are great questions to ask. What makes those types of questions only applicable for teaching about gays in history versus any other history? 

That's called not teaching a single story (usually history has multiple interpretations) and giving context. Both are important for history teachers to do in all their lessons."
politics,fda6c1c,t1_fd9vlzk,1578242268.0,"It sounds like you're saying let's not mention gay people that did great things are gay unless the thing they did is centered around their gayness. 

Because people still have discriminatory feelings towards gays, any information where we normalize gayness is a step towards reducing gays as being seen as an ""other"". The more that people understand that gays have been around forever the more normal it seems. 

Also, there haven't been discriminatory laws on the books or beatings of vegetarians so I don't think that analogy is really appropriate"
politics,fcy3nin,t1_fcy2e8r,1578074352.0,Assassinate would be a more apt word.
AdviceAnimals,fctkf8k,t1_fctj1yk,1577946470.0,"Lol it's the most ridiculous thing. If I have to guess, it's because most people upvoting dont really cook. And that's okay. But to someone who doesn't cook, i can see how ""making"" a charcuterie board seems worthy"
AdviceAnimals,fctgpqj,t3_eirand,1577942715.0,"All the praise and upvotes for charcuterie boards is dumb. All you do is buy some premade stuff and put it on slab of wood. It's tasty, but so is takeout teriyaki. That doesn't mean you should get praise for throwing your teriyaki on a slab of wood and taking a pic. I don't get it lol"
science,fcst5ez,t1_fcsrv3g,1577924456.0,"That's pretty much exactly what I'm saying. The reason i bring it up is because we get stuck in this loop where we are only looking at one factor like race to explain complex situations. Then the solutions proposed to fix those complex situations end up being focused on a singluar factor like race without addressing other really important factors, like SES."
science,fcsrj5u,t1_fcsrc4n,1577923286.0,Why are you sorry? That's an important connection and part of the point im trying to make.
science,fcspcb4,t1_fcsl0oi,1577921717.0,"You're right. I wish this much thought was put into everytime a statistic about black people comes out. Turns out maybe the race of the person isn't the determining factor but rather all these other correlating factors like socio-economic status, location, age, education etc."
