bipolar,fe6p3wj,t3_enzxes,1578898919.0,"As much as any normal person? You are not gonna get normal if she is hyper sexual you won‚Äôt have to ask, you might want less of it, if she is depressed there is no way in telling how long it‚Äôs going to last and you might not want it due to her lack of hygiene. If you want to be with her sex can‚Äôt be important there is no consistency and you can‚Äôt take it personal"
bipolar,fe6knkl,t3_envn1z,1578894049.0,"You are doing everything that you can it is up to her to want to do the work to get better she still young so it might be a while, from my experience it started to get harder to keep up as I got older the lows got too overwhelming that I finally got help cause I was going to die if I didn‚Äôt. That started to happen around 35 and it took me 3 yrs to get the right meds. What helped me to survive was that I have a caring family like yours, my mom always took me back no matter what, she always made me feel loved and told me I was worth a lot to her. I know it‚Äôs hard for you to not worry about the dangers she is putting her self through but you can‚Äôt control what happens, you need to take care of your mental health and go to therapy so you can continue to heal and stay strong, you are an amazing mom btw your daughters are very lucky, you been through so much and still managed to put your other girls in college wow"
bipolar,fe6f926,t3_enxm7t,1578889138.0,If my parents had given me the choice to be born I would have said no. I think you are making the right choice I got lucky with my daughter but I do tell her to consider adoption cause is painful to see someone you love suffering

bipolar,fdgvb0n,t3_elbjna,1578409214.0,"Been there, relationships can get easier after you realize that it‚Äôs most likely you lol once you become self aware you can take a step back and apologize. I‚Äôm very much like you I have a wonderful family and that‚Äôs enough, I tried having meaningful friendships but it‚Äôs not worth it everyone has their own shit going on and I just don‚Äôt want to deal with it. And I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre being abused like others do, our illness can make us a bit much at times and your op has the right to a breaking point"
