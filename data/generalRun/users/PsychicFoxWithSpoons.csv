[Well, we wouldn't know for sure, because that's hard to study.](https://www.livescience.com/29494-acupuncture.html) For example, what's the difference between a hormonal shift from acupuncture and a hormonal shift from acupuncture performed ""incorrectly""?

>""One major hypothesis is that acupuncture works through neurohormonal pathways. Basically, you put the needle through specific points in the body and stimulate the nerve. The nerve actually sends signals to the brain, and the brain releases neural hormones such as beta-Endorphins. By doing that, the patient may feel euphoric, or happy, and this increases the pain threshold and they feel less pain,"" Bao said.

This isn't the end-all be-all, and it certainly isn't a final explanation, but it is a convincing theory that the data appears to support."
unpopularopinion,ffx8bhz,t1_ffx3fca,1580319850.0,"The reason people don't believe it is because the wealth inequality has become so huge that in public consciousness, ""millionaire"" is still the top 1%. You need an income of over $400k/year in order to be considered the top 1% of earners in the country. To be a millionaire, you don't even need to make 6 figures.

In social consciousness, ""rich"" is considered on average to be [6 figure salary](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/23/how-much-money-americans-think-you-need-to-make-to-be-rich.html) - once you hit 100k, that's that, you're rich now. But that doesn't even put you in the top 5%. That puts you in the top 25%. In other words, **being a millionaire now means you're middle class.** To be rich (top 5%), you need to make more than $250,000 a year.

Reagan put this into motion back in the 1980s, so you have him to thank.

NOW. You can argue with me, and this is extremely difficult to research and prove in my argument's favor, that savings and income are not necessarily exactly aligned. Someone can make a million dollars a year and still blow it all on hookers and cocaine and thereby become no longer a millionaire. Some people also stuff money into businesses and investments which inflate their net worth but don't exactly line up to a million dollars in the bank, or a rich lifestyle or any of that.

But! And here's the critical point, if you make 6 figures and aren't a millionaire, that's your own damn fault. Do you have any idea what I could do with 6 figures of income??? You make like 2 safe investments and your net worth passes a million EASY. So really, saying that millionaires are the top 25% is charitable and makes it look harder than it is, because there are probably millions more people who became millionaires off of a $75k income (top 35%) and millions more who live comfortably out in the middle of fucking nowhere in a $100,000 mcmansion they bought with cash. I strongly doubt that less than 80% of people making more than $100k/yr are millionaires.

An acupuncturist opening the qi pathways of the body is doing something that could be understood if it were better studied. More than likely, ""qi"" and ""chakra"" refer to hormones, which have many different types of emotional expression (positive/negative/what have you) and would best be described as ""energy"" to a society that doesn't have access to microscopes and microorganisms. This energy:

- Travels through the blood
- Controls your mood and state of consciousness
- Is a source of stress and tightness
- Is provoked and controlled through touch, meditation, and pain

Like...bro, that's hormones. ""Qi medicine"" is just manipulating biological hormonal control over emotions. Hormones can also cause problems like migraines and depression, which - wow, acupuncture treats really effectively. 

Just a pet theory, probably wrong, but it makes the most sense to me. Acupuncture has worked to take away pain in family members that normal medications could not cure, so I really think that even though the energy-pathways thing is kinda dumb, it's definitely based on something real."

The report found that Trump hid evidence and recommended impeachment for obstruction of justice. 

And guess what - everything that people accused Trump of doing with Russia, he turned around and did with Ukraine, only this time he can't keep people quiet. Lutsenko offered dirt on Biden the exact same way Putin offered dirt on Clinton, and Trump couldn't help but throw himself at it.

PoliticalHumor,ffso8xb,t1_ffskbou,1580186909.0,"It did not debunk, it simply established that there was insufficient evidence to determine.

The main issue described in the report was that Trump dedicated a great deal of time and effort hiding evidence. This was noteworthy enough that Mueller and his team concluded that it ""materially impacted"" the ability of the investigation to conclude whether or not the President did or didn't work together with Russia. 

So basically, while we don't have any proof, we have more than enough to justify an investigation. 

Here's an easy example of what this means: You shoot and kill someone. You hide the body in your backyard. The police suspect you and try to investigate your backyard, but as a result of your position as police chief, you make sure that no warrants can be filed against you. The investigation concludes that while the person died, and while you appear to have the means/motive/opportunity to kill the person, and while you do not have any alibi, and while a witness saw you arguing with the person, and while you were seen near the scene of the crime, and while you were spotted burying a large plastic bag, they can't arrest you because they're not legally allowed to go digging in your backyard to come up with a body (which would be simple and easy to prove that you were the one burying it).

We are waiting for Trump's skeletons to be dragged out of his closet, and so far, the office of the President has allowed him to keep that shit padlocked.

AskTrumpSupporters,ffd1h9m,t1_ffcyswp,1579811554.0,">Do you look at something like this and kind of wonder why it's so important to decide if some people are true POC or not?

I think generally if someone is looking to find if someone is a ""true"" POC, they're not being a very good leftist. The idea behind progressive politics is inclusiveness, not purity. As you mentioned, right-wing and alt-right groups tend to get into a purity death spiral pretty quickly; I think the tendency is to believe that left-wing politics is *exactly* the same, and in my experience there are a lot of differences.

Instead of a purity death spiral, left-wingers usually end up going too far into the opposite direction, incorporating so many different messages in an attempt to allow everyone to feel heard that you have almost no cohesive message. Very few strong left-wing movements have been able to punch through this dilution; Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street held on an impressively long time but weren't able to hold themselves together.

What often muddies the waters of online discourse is the anonymity of online spaces that allow right-wingers and shit-stirrers to masquerade as leftists. You have the option of going onto Twitter right now and saying that Elizabeth Warren isn't progressive enough because she doesn't like black people. Is it true? Who cares? CNN will report on it.

The reason leftists won't do the same to right-wingers is because right-wingers will adopt the satirical positions (The_Donald, /pol/, etc. - these places started out as satire to mock right-wingers and rapidly became radicalization echo chambers) and everything will just get worse. Antifa is not out there shooting Jews to make the Nazis look like they don't like Jews. A, they don't have to shoot Jews to make Nazis look bad, and B, it would be a really stupid way to defend Jews. You know?

This is my evidence for why America is currently a right-wing country. ""Progressives,"" even the American far left, really don't do anything too crazy (yeah yeah bike locks or whatever, those are reactionaries), just some strange identity politics, but if you hop to the right of the Republican party, you start to see domestic terrorism, sexual violence, and other crazy dark stuff.

I don't know if I agree with that, just as a matter of observation. As a white man myself, I have noticed my privileges on that front many times.

Fiction is the easiest place to see this, but it's a common theme in real life as well.

I think if you sincerely believe that white skin is considered the bottom of the racial value hierarchy, that's worth discussing. Why do you believe this? What do you believe is a ""value hierarchy"" in this case, and what sort of evidence do you have that white is at the bottom of it?

>In my opinion, that's far less racist than a progressive leftist, though.

But aren't the free press our window into what the government is doing? Shouldn't we be paying attention, through the media, to what the government is doing, rather than trust them to do what they say they are going to do?

""Trust implies a lack of a need of oversight"" kind of contradicts the idea of supporting Trump, who is perhaps the president who fights against oversight the *most.* More than Reagan and Nixon combined. He's classified, shuffled, and outright hid documents not only about official government activities but about mundane personal details like his tax returns, his grades, and his health report.

The fact that many TS are willing to believe Trump (an untrustworthy man who reneges on contracts, breaks promises, and leads off his lies with ""trust me"") over news outlets and NGOs is baffling. You can't explain that just by saying that ""the media lies and NGOs have ulterior motives,"" because that only explains why you wouldn't believe CNN and watchdog Dems in a vacuum.

It is. But! That doesn't mean that nonbinary identities don't exist.

Color is related to light. There is a spectrum of radiation wavelengths that corresponds to what our eyes can perceive. Not a single spectral line refers to ""white"" light. And yet, white things *obviously* exist. You can look around the room and see a million different things that we could describe as ""white.""

You can even go deeper. What does it even mean for a thing to possess a color? The answer is more complicated than you'd think. I don't even know how to explain it to you, myself. The main point of saying this is not to say that gender and sex are meaningless categories or definitions, but that they describe emergent properties of systems that are not simple at all. Saying ""there are only two genders because there are only two biological sexes"" is like saying ""there are only 7 colors"" or ""there are only 4 races of human.""

If someone were to come up with a new race (e.g., let's say someone wanted to call South Asian a new race called ""Himalayan"" instead of just leaving them as ""Asian""), it would be preposterous to say something like ""Race is based off of genetics! You can't have a new race!"" Like, race is just a shorthand for identifiable genetic characteristics like face shape, skin color, hair color, and ethnic origin. Race mixing blurs the lines even further. It's not a meaningless category, it's just something we describe because it's what we appear to see."

I agree.

Where I *disagree* is that such arguments should be lent weight, credence, and validity based on how much money you're willing to spend pushing your alternative narrative.

One example is the Flat Earth Society. I think they ought to be free to express disagreement with the grander narrative of a round Earth. However, I'm not going to fight very hard for their right to have their theory included into science textbooks, or for their right to have a seat at NASA's space exploration table, or sitting in Congress with a representative lobbyist on discussions about space exploration. At some point, wrong ideas must be recognized for their incorrectness and removed from academic discussion. 2+2=4. Repeatedly raising your hand during Calculus class and asking ""But *I* think 2+2 is *5*"" is not helping the rest of the class learn.

Trans women are women. You are free to discuss the womanhood of a trans woman, and in fact, many people would be delighted to converse with and educate you. There is nothing stopping you from expressing a wrong opinion. 

The corollary to this is, if you have a wrong opinion, and you refuse to change it when offered evidence of its wrongness, AND you are using your resources to amplify the sound and influence of that wrong opinion, you are eroding the foundations of the marketplace of ideas through what is essentially a well-funded disinformation attack. How am I, an uneducated layperson, supposed to choose between two opinions that appear to be equal in credence? (This is the problem currently affecting the medical community about vaccines, to deadly effect, as well as the political community with Donald Trump, again to deadly effect.)

I can make money claiming that essential oils cure cancer. Many people do. Where should we draw a line? Should we draw a line?

Many people defend against misinformation attacks by banning false statements at a foundational level. You're welcome to discuss whether or not to use a certain term for a certain group of people (is bisexual trans-positive? Some say yes, others no), but not whether or not trans women are women. That is considered to be a settled matter in those spaces.

If you were in a church, the existence of God is considered to be a settled matter, but the womanhood of trans women is not. Once you consider the way context influences truth, the apparent contradictions will make more sense.

Also: The time-tested rebuttal.

>Yet, when it comes to transgender people, simply saying that a transwoman isn't a woman is enough to be labeled transphobic. Why is that?

You have the right to say a transwoman isn't a woman. They have the right to say you are transphobic for saying that. Nobody's right to free speech is being infringed here. There is no contradiction."

The book treats Zelda's story in much the same way as the movie - as something parallel and paranormal that was happening to the mother at the same time as the father was struggling to accept the death of his son. >!(it was Gage in the book, the change to Ellie was surprising and made for a great twist for those who knew the book, as the father saved Gage but was unable to protect Ellie.)!< The point of the story was not to tack on more things, but to introduce another character who struggled with the idea of the death of a loved one - the idea of guilt as the mother did something WRONG that led to the death of her sister - the complicated blend of grief, fear, and shame that *Pet Sematary* explores as a work.

I'm not surprised that people didn't like the newest movie. For one, the ending was *horrible*. The original ending was, in my opinion, perfect. >!While Louis was able to kill Gage, he was not able to save his wife.

Or maybe:

Step One: Examine the roster. What is the most threatening late game hero? Which heroes have stuns?

PL exists. Do you have a PL answer? I would say yes. Viper's break prevents PL from multiplying a zillion illusions. Do you have a Drow answer? I would say yes. TA can get on top of Drow and kill her.

Step Two: Examine your item choices. What was your role in this game, and did you execute it correctly? What was your enemy's win condition considering your drafts?

Your job was to kill Drow Ranger. As we can see on the scoreboard, you killed her 3 times and PL 6 times. To me, this shows a bit of a mixup of priorities. You were winning hard, so there was no actual pressing need for you to jump into fights that don't involve Drow.

If you don't kill Drow, who does? Venge took it upon herself to 1v1 Drow as much as possible, like a complete clown. More than likely, Venge correctly identified a Drow out of position, engaged on her, and then got completely ignored by the TA while the pink slut was off fingerbanging the cancer lancer despite Tiny/Io/Viper being more than enough. You'll notice Drow killed her 7 times, and Tusk/AA killed her another 4 times.

Drow's win condition was to stay the fuck away from TA, and then enter teamfights to slaughter you once TA is dead or occupied. It took 40 minutes for this to happen, but it did eventually happen.

Step Three: Evaluate Corrections. What should you do next time?

Neither Butterfly nor MKB was useful this game. The enemy Drow had a Silver Edge and a Manta Style. You spent nearly 10,000 gold on items that don't deal with either of those. The correct play here was to buy a Hex and a Daedalus. It costs the exact same, but allows you to kill Drow Ranger through her defensive items. 

You had a great KDA. But you lost. And you lost because you didn't kill the Drow Ranger. You have a specific job to do in each game, and on TA, this job is *usually* to burst down an important enemy hero. Either a critical squishy or an underfarmed carry.

The only time I will build Butterfly MKB on TA is if my target is Windranger or Phantom Assassin, in which case I will typically require more DPS and the ability to punch through evasion. Go ahead: Count the sources of evasion on the enemy team. ""But PL has an evasion talent"" - a.) not your job b.) he went the attack speed because he was a clown, and you should have punished his mistake by building hex rather than mkb."
