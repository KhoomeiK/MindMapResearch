AskReddit,fdguakw,t3_elaebq,1578408496.0,"Not a teacher, but I only remember the story because I had witnessed the fallout.

In eleventh grade, there was a girl (let’s call her Carol) who was *crazy* about the cartoon *Sonic the Hedgehog*. To the point where a teacher threatened to fail her on a writing assignment if she turned in yet another *Sonic* fanfiction. 

Instead of actually doing work properly, she handed in an angry letter to the teacher as her assignment. Can’t remember what the specifics of that letter were, but I do remember it was such that she got suspended for the remainder of the year. When she came back in grade 12, she had to apologize to everyone in her homeroom for her actions the previous year. It’s in this apology that she tells us she had a brain tumour the size of Quebec. The kid from Quebec, naturally, yells at her for comparing Quebec to a brain tumour.

EDIT: Carol did a *lot* of other stuff besides the angry letter that year. She mentioned in her apology that:

 * she got a girl in trouble for vandalism so she (Carol) could get the lead role in a school play

 * she dressed up as a grim reaper for some old person's funeral, and accused my friend (whom she never had any prior connection to) of tricking her into thinking the funeral was a Halloween party (since this happened in May, the excuse was made of toothpicks)

 * she got a zero on a term project for math because she accidentally submitted a poorly written and creepy *Sonic* fanfiction instead of her assignment. She threw a temper tantrum to get the teacher to change the due date. Nothing came of it. 

And that's just the stuff she admitted to"
