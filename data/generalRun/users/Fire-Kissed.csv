AskWomen,fffwqfj,t3_etdutg,1579893477.0,"25/26. I simply can’t stand the loud music and screaming anymore. It’s a lot of fun when you are young and single or casually dating, and can stay out all night. Now that I have a career, a husband, kids.... I’m too tired to endure that. Recently went to a bar after a work holiday party, that was very club-like. I felt so uncomfortable and bored! I can’t believe those places were soooo much fun lol!"
breakingmom,fffuizf,t1_fffqjd1,1579892090.0,Yeah no this is on him. Hold him to it. Not your chore anymore.
Austin,fffo7uv,t1_fffiml5,1579888193.0,Lol my thought exactly. Poor rich people.
Austin,fffo528,t1_fffmpss,1579888146.0,Those bike shorts. Can’t be surprised if you’re wearing bike shorts.
AskWomen,ffexvew,t1_ffe513t,1579869817.0,"I had just a three month stint with no period, if you’d even call it a period. Around that time my period would come and go randomly. There’d be two weeks inbetween bleeding, or 6 weeks, or 8. Very random and I pretty much had cramps nonstop even when I wasn’t bleeding. One doc put me on hormonal birth control pill and another put me on spironolactone."
Allergy,ffexmxb,t1_ffede5l,1579869584.0,There’s no way to know unless you try. Everyone is different.
Parenting,ffexik7,t1_ffeahwi,1579869463.0,"It may not have been in the beginning but developed as he got older and more clever. Potty training is so very often a power struggle. I hear it all the time. Hopefully if you keep the pressure off of him and act like whatever he does either way is boring, he will realize that poo in his pants isn’t fun."
Allergy,ffe3pag,t3_et3726,1579835884.0,"Environmental. Yes that’s environmental allergies which come and go depending on a lot of factors. Pollen count of your allergens, medications, etc."
WomensHealth,ffe3kva,t3_et3g6x,1579835793.0,"What exactly do you want to know about? HSV 1 and HSV 2 are names for two different stains of the herpes simplex virus. Any wet orifice can become infected if exposed and it can be either 1 or 2. Your eyes, lips, nose, genitals, anus can all be affected. Contrary to popular belief, HSV 1 doesn’t refer to herpes of the mouth, and HSV 2 doesn’t refer to genital. The 1 & 2 are like the A & B for the flu. Yes #2 has a preference for the genitals and #1 the mouth, but you can get either in any orifice. 

If either of you have it and don’t want to give it to someone else, go get on an antiviral regimen. It’s harmless and will help."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ffe212z,t3_et3ir4,1579834645.0,"Yesssss as someone with a short torso and a casual office, I love tucking in the shirts that are just too long in the front, it really makes the outfit look more polished and intentional."
AskWomen,ffe154y,t3_et33v6,1579834004.0,Sudden change of hormones that no doctor has told me why. 5 doctors I have talked to about it and they all go “everything is normal” except I have all the symptoms of PCOS but none of the “proof.”
Parenting,ffe0wq5,t3_et3nfi,1579833832.0,"Maybe the pressure came off? Maybe he felt a sense of relief, like oh, “mom doesn’t care anymore. Welp I guess I can at least try this pooping on the potty thing then since I’m not getting any attention for not going.”

Kids are weird."
SkincareAddiction,ffd1kka,t1_ffct38y,1579811605.0,"Timeless uses glass as well! And minimal ingredients, no fragrance, no fluff! Ever impressed with their products. They’re pure HA serum has done wonders for my tret flakey skin that even my hada labo skin plumping gel cream couldn’t do."

Makeup,ffa3eus,t1_ffa0h9h,1579727099.0,This is hilarious. I use chapstick on the dry patches on my face under concealer. Then powder. It’s AMAZING. LOL.
Makeup,ffa35s1,t1_ff9xvx6,1579726953.0,"You sound like me. Most days I swipe metallic crayon shadow across my lid, no eyeliner, just mascara. It’s my fast go to look and I think it looks just fine."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ff7tqko,t3_es4hav,1579658146.0,No.
WomensHealth,ff7td9i,t3_es41gn,1579657887.0,I’m glad your body seems to be working somewhat normally again. But please keep pressing your doctors for answers. “We don’t know why” isn’t an acceptable answer and is so prevalent in gynecology it’s insane. I’ve had so many reproductive and hormonal problems and been brushed off by so many doctors because “it’s just a period.” Well what if it isn’t?
KidsAreFuckingStupid,ff7n6xk,t1_ff7lpx9,1579653567.0,She’s 7. Yeah we’re past that now.
