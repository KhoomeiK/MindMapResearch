I don't mind being poor. I actually rather make less and have more spare time. It's a conscious decision I'm making. But there are millions which are just.. Born into a poor family, born with an illness and medical bills tied to their existence. And they suffer while the people born lucky, strive and get different treatment. A cop wouldn't treat Trump the same as some poor kid in Compton just walking down the street. We both know it."
