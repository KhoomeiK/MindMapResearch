selfimprovement,ff57m1k,t1_ff5768t,1579582581.0,"Equate from walmart! You can buy crest if you prefer buying name brands but there isnt too crazy of a difference and equate is cheaper. It says to use it for 30 minutes but I always do a full hour. I wish I would've taken 'before' pictures but I was too excited to try them. On a typical teeth color scale I was always a 9-10 but im at a 4-5 now. I seriously never thought I would see the day i was confident in my teeth, but now I smile more and smile longer just to feel the sence of pride in my teeth. I know this sounds like something out of a commercial but I seriously cant give it enough praise. I think it's like $25-30 for 20 sets."
selfimprovement,ff5141d,t3_ejlht3,1579577398.0,Congradulations!!! Im late to the party but the best thing I ever did was buy a really nice electric toothbrush and teeth whitening strips. The new toothbrush makes me excited to use it and the whitening strios have done nothing short of an absolute miracle. My teeth used to be orange from smoking and coffee and now they're above average white. Took 12 days!!

AmItheAsshole,fdj4z3y,t3_eln9zx,1578458588.0,"Yta kinda. I know positive critisism is useful, but thats his passion written out on paper. Sometimes when people share something and ask for critique, they're really just looking for sonebody to show off the work they've put in. Its the adult version of a kid asking if their drawing is good, it's best to encourage it despite its flaws than to critique and risk offending them. 

Also props to you for putting out a real AITA instead of just putting out validation garbage"
