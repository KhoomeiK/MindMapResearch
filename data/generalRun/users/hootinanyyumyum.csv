TrueOffMyChest,fec9i1l,t3_eodtzj,1578969046.0,"I felt the same way after reading ""The Pelican Brief"" and then seeing the movie. I hated that they turned the main character African American, only because when reading the book he is Caucasian and as I read a book I picture characters. Although, at the time I loved Julia Roberts and I hated her in that role."
TrueOffMyChest,fec700o,t3_eodns3,1578967729.0,"There's a big difference between being ""woke"" and being ""self aware"". Some people will blame their flaws on anything else in order to avoid admitting they were in the wrong when called out. The friends probably also didn't want to admit to themselves they were being rude and we're in the wrong so also wanted to jump on her racists bandwagon."
TrueOffMyChest,fec5dm4,t1_fe9jy72,1578966901.0,"Nope, unfortunately that's not true either.

TrueOffMyChest,fdxxvh0,t3_en5fo1,1578774017.0,"We didn't meet until I was 40 and he was 36 still living at home and I had serious concerns about what kind of boyfriend, let alone husband he would make.
My husband met me when I couldn't pay my bills and was having back issues so bad that I was seeing a chiropractor, with no insurance. All of my other men had lived off me, I had taken care of everything.
 The first time I stressed about something he got on the phone and fixed it and got my money back. 
For one someone was taking care of me. He combined our incomes so he could help me pay my bills. 
One year after marriage I had severe huge, multiple, stag horn kidney stones in both kidney requiring too many procedures and surgeries to count. He took care of me and his only complaint was his it was so terrible multiple times a day to rip off the gauze and tape because I ran out of skin to peel off.
He never blamed me through our bankruptcy either.
One year later I'm diagnosed with cancer after 3 months of severe crying on the couch and countless trips to Dr and urgent care and more procedures. Never complaining for himself. 

After I was unable to have children. Between that news (ripped my heart out of my chest) my horrible job, and PTSD from cancer I had a fibromyalgia frareup that my Dr said that my job was killing me. 
He got a promotion, we moved to the most beautiful place, imo, and we now have a foster son (13) and he's not perfect but considering what he's been through he will be an axing young man. 

My favorite thing about my husband is he always puts me needs above his own."
depression,fduaut4,t1_fds22iu,1578730571.0,That's why I just stopped telling people. They don't really give a shit. People who do not suffer from depression don't get it and never will so I just started telling people I had insomnia and tired so I wouldn't have to explain.
depression,fdry44c,t3_emnl5m,1578691397.0,"As a cancer survivor and someone who has suffered from clinical depression my whole life, I can say that I learned things about human nature through chemo, which Actually just made me hate people and life more in many ways. If I wouldn't have been in so much pain from the cancer, with a husband of 18 months, I would not have gotten treatment. I came out of it not being able to have kids and now my life is more fucked up than ever. 
Even with cancer, the time off and sympathy ends but you are still left with the battle scars of surviving cancer. 
So while I understand what you are saying because I've always struggled with depression, you don't want that shit either."
pugs,fdo056r,t1_fdk3osf,1578596384.0,"It took me years to decide. It wasn't until after helping raise all my friends kids and getting cancer and finding out I couldn't have kids that I decided I wanted to make a difference somehow. 
We are his 5th placement in 3years. I'm his last hope before boys home and I cry in the shower afraid I will fail him. It's very hard some days because I give him unconditional love and he's been hurt so many times he won't believe it or even receive it at yet and it tears my heart apart. He gets upset and punches himself and walls.
You find out what they have been through and it's horrifying. Raped at 5 by a family friend having sex with cousin at 7. Living on a pot farm. Mom selling hard core drugs. Being homeless, only having 3 things in the fridge at a time. At 10 living with a friend while his mom was homeless and he turned her in because they were renting out the basement to a pedophile. This is one story. 
While waiting for your license take as many classes as possible. I took sexually affected children and disciplining children with severe trama which helped me immensly. 
If you have any specific question DM me!!! I would be happy to answer or help in any way. There is just way too much to text and different things come up at different stages."

depression,fczj3ww,t3_ejp9d7,1578102363.0,"My heart breaks for you because I lived a very similar life growing up.  Except my sister (over 7 years ypunger) was a spoiled rotten brat with no chores while I played Cinderella.  I am 47 and my sister is 40. She has two kids that my parents have done everything for and she currently lives with my dad and when he does she gets his house plus falf of the house we grew up in (but she's fighting for my mom to give her kids each 25 percent). 
I just became a foster m OK m for the first time, and all I've ever wanted was a child and they didn't even congratulate me.  
It won't get better with your family. Survive the next few years by trying to put yourself out there and make friends.  Join a club,  like choir,  it's the best way to make a group of friends.  Then move out as soon as you can and distance yourself. You also might want to see a counselor to talk all this out.  Start with an adult at school.  Your parents are barely holding on.  Make 2020 your year.  Start by talking to an adult,  then find a club to join that gets you out of your house,  allows you to talk and be you,  and make friends,  could even be a support group. Good luck.  I'm always available for chatting."
Fosterparents,fcwnbun,t1_fcwl575,1578030559.0,"People like you are why I don't talk to people much anymore and why on very RARE occasions when I think I'm trying to inform people of something I would like to know I regret it because I realize people are fuckers and even worse when you can't say what you want to their face because they are also cowards.

We are his 5th home in 3 years,  he has multi issues,  none of which are your damn business.  If we hadn't taken him in,  he would be in a home.  
I wrote this to be kind,  but I'm so tired of all of the assholes.  You can all fuck off!! If his CASA worker says I'm doing amazing and his social worker is telling me I understand kids so well I should be a social worker and my son,  even after the punishment,  is tell me he wants us to adopt him, you don't mean shit.  But fuck,  I'm tired of trying to just do unto others, and I get shit on for my efforts,  so once again I say fuck off!!"
Fosterparents,fcwje6w,t1_fcwgl61,1578027223.0,"Oh and BTW,  he's legally free so technically his case worker is his ""parent"" and she is requiring the punishment, but you seem to have a handle on things."
Fosterparents,fcwj7t2,t1_fcwgl61,1578027083.0,"And this was a PSA to help concerned parents,  not get your opinion about my parenting.  Obviously you are not one of those parents so feel free to keep reading.  Meanwhile,  I will not be raising my foster sons child,  or visiting him in prison.  But on the plus side your kids can feel ""normal"" and you won't ""embarrass or shame"" them for sending nudes to anyone,  anywhere,  who is any age,  doing anything with them,  and may be planning on meeting up.  Oh but that would never happen because we all know that foster children are not vulnerable for being taken advantage of because they are so desperate to be loved.  Get a clue!!"
Fosterparents,fcwi2kf,t1_fcwf3pb,1578026190.0,"You know how parents say ""you think I'm being too harsh, but you will thank me later"" or adults talk about how as a teen their parents controlling pissed them off but as they look back now they are grateful and understand.  Well,  your kids can't thank you when they get older it they aren't around to do it."
Fosterparents,fcwhsna,t1_fcwgl61,1578025978.0,Really? Because after all that in the only one he's confided in about the story of his sexual abuse.  If you want to raise the children of your foster children or visit them in prison then you parent your way.
DoesAnybodyElse,fcwdwx7,t1_fcw8c3u,1578023175.0,"Obviously you didn't read it very closely.  Small towns,  under 1,000. Foster son, just moved to town always in trouble,  first to get blamed. FELONY charges  if her parents find out and pursue.  I could have been a 47 year old male pedophile and no one would have heard from that little boy ever again.  I really hope you don't have children that age."
UnsentLetters,fcwa7al,t3_ej5ndd,1578020705.0,It doesn't sound like limbo.  It sounds like you can't be honest with yourself because that would mean the loss of hope.  Move on and find someone who likes you as much as you like them.
