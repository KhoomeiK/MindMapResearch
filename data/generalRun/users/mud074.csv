You start out as a lone captain in a small ship and slowly piece together an army of progressively better ships and captains that you use in short but detailed battles where you control the flagship and the rest of your fleet is controlled by shockingly competent AI."
pcgaming,fdkxu8v,t1_fdkb1ec,1578513386.0,"The reason people are acting out so much in response to you is because your very first comment shows that you don't even understand the absolute basics concept of the game since you called it a BR, but still pass judgement acting like you know anything about the game. The only shared mechanics between EFT and BRs are that death results in losing your current inventory and no respawns, all players (other than join in progress players that get random shitty gear) enter the map at the same time, and looting shit is a mechanic. There is no zone, there is no winner (it is perfectly possible for an entire raid to go by without a single shot fired on the entire map, albeit unlikely), you choose what gear you enter the map with and keep that gear if you survive, and there are AI enemies around. There is just nothing BR about this game.
