TerrainBuilding,ff5ycao,t3_eoozeq,1579614216.0,"A suggestion regarding the voting:

Only competition entrants get a vote, and they cannot vote for themselves.

This means that people with multiple Reddit accounts can't vote for themselves fifty times. It also makes ""VOTE FOR ME!!!"" spam irrelevant.

In order to minimise internal politicking, I would also advocate in favour of anonymity. You simply submit your entry to the organiser, who adds it to an album. This album is published to the subreddit upon the completion of the competition deadline. Nobody's competition entry is shown ""first,"" and this means that everyone gets the same, fair chance and it isn't just a case of ""first gets seen, last gets buried."" Additionally, the anonymity means that people vote on the submissions based on their merit, not on who made them. Having participated in these kinds of competitions before, I can attest that there is a certain measure of favouritism that seeps in otherwise.

This does have the downside that nobody gets to see a WIP before the big reveal, but it does make the competition much more fair. WIP pictures could be taken by the crafter and then shown after the voting completes. A nice article summing up the methods used by each crafter might be a nice follow-up after the competition. People who were impressed by entry X or Y would be able to look up how effects A and B were done.

And finally, the ""budget limit"" idea is nice in principle, but when 3d printing costs about 2p per gram, and garbage is technically free, it gets kinda murky. A better method might be a materials limit such as: ""No pink foam."" or ""No 3d printers."" or ""Garbage only."" Or even ""100% cardboard.""

It might be worth making a rule that 3D printing is allowed, but only if you use an original template/model that you designed yourself. You can't just download a model, have your Ender 3 poop it out, and win the competition with it. That isn't in the spirit of the event

But if someone actually spends some time working on the 3D model, sets up his support structures properly, splits up the mesh properly, anneals, booleans and manifolds his model properly, manicures the normals, and gets something that looks good? I don't think it would be fair to disqualify him for the tools and method he chose. 3d printed plagiarism is one thing, but making original 3d printed terrain is another.

An additional caveat might be that if you make a 3d printed piece, it needs to be released to the community so that everyone can have one.

Those are my two cents, anyway."

TerrainBuilding,feg17gb,t1_feetn0q,1579072554.0,"Personally, I've found that the Ender 3 is pretty fantastic at general purpose 3D printing. Granted, for minis, you're normally better off using a resin printer such as the Anycubic Photon. However, with the right tinkering, you can get an Ender 3 up to about 80-90% of the print quality just by making sure it is carefully calibrated and the profile is optimised. (And at an average cost of 2c per gram, the Ender 3 is the more economical choice in every respect!)

There are two profiles I would recommend finding - And you'll have to forgive me for not remembering the exact names. Printing profiles often have confusing names with more letternunmbersalad01 than an Xbox live username.

But the best starting point profiles I've found are ""Siepie,"" which gives no layer lines, but doesn't preserve the finest details very well. Average print times for a 30mm mini are between three and nine hours.

And ""Tomb of 3D Printed Horrors,"" which preserves detail fantastically, and prints in less than a third of the time of Siepie, but has visible layer lines that you'll need to hide. Average print times for a 30mm mini are around 45 minutes to 3 hours.

Both are great for printing minis, although Siepie would take weeks to print a terrain piece of any real size.

Sorry I can't remember the full profile names offhand, but I'm at work pretending to be busy whilst goofing around on Reddit, so... I can't check."

TerrainBuilding,fecwf8t,t3_enyy1l,1578987314.0,"First, make your static ""moon"" crater as normal. This is a solid starting point.

Score some lines radiating from about 1/3 of the way from the centre, to the edge. This creates the impression of a forceful ""blast"" blowing the earth directionally away from the centre.

Gt yourself some bristles from a stiff sweeping brush.

Glue them to the edge of the crater to prickle upwards in the direction of the blast energy. (up and away from the centre.)

Soak these bristles in glue, and then coat them in chunky sand appropriate to your scale. This gives the impression of debris being flung out from the crater by the impact.

Glue a slightly larger pebble to the furthermost tips of a few of the bristles, giving the impression that larger rocks are flying and leaving a stream of smaller pebbles following in their wake.

Add some plants, such as tuft-grasses to the outer edge of the base, a short distance from the impact.

Slick these plants down with your choice of invisible glue, to give the impression that they are being blown by the impact.

If it is appropriate with your style, some cotton wool smoke may also be merited, so long as you maintain the ""outward"" motion of the piece. Do not go crazy with this step, as too much will obscure all your hard work so far. Some cotton wool tails on some of your flying debris can make it look like it's in motion, but just adding a static doughnut ring of cloud around your mini hides all of the sense of motion you're trying to convey."
TerrainBuilding,fecvntx,t3_eo0no8,1578986441.0,"I love my 3D printer for certain types of terrain work, although I tend to use it for the rapid fabrication of details (doors, window frames, etc.) rather than full terrain pieces.

It's nice to see that an FDM printer can handle complete terrain pieces, though!

As an aside, if you want to get a better finish on your top surfaces (to get rid of that ""hot nozzle touching the model's surface"" line pattern on the top layer,) try printing the mini at an angle of about 15 degrees to one side. Add some support structures underneath it, but nowhere else.

This ""staggers"" the top layer, and gives a nicer result on any mini with a flat top.

Also, are you planning on doing any water effects on this one? If you used PLA filament, I would not advise using the quick and lazy hot glue method, as this will melt and deform your lovingly painted model. PLA has a fairly low melting point.

I would advise using an RTV epoxy resin mix instead."

TerrainBuilding,fe6rjq2,t1_fbgax8e,1578902021.0,"I absolutely love the idea of running the competition with limitations or restrictions to make it more challenging!

Budgetary limits are a good option, but why not go one step further? A budget of zero, using only recycled or reused garbage from the bin? We could call it the ""go green and recycle"" challenge.

Other challenges might include material limits. Many newbie crafters find themselves demotivated when they realise they cannot get pink foam or other ""essential"" materials in their local area. Why not run challenges where people are forbidden from using certain materials, so that the community as a whole can demonstrate that nothing is ""essential"" and just because you can't find X doesn't mean you can't make Y.

For example, ""no pink foam,"" might be a good challenge. ""100% cardboard"" might be another. ""Recycled bin materials only,"" could be another. Or, maybe something like: ""You are allowed to use one cereal box, tools, paints and glue. Nothing more.""

I like the idea of categories and challenges not being linked specifically to particular genres of game. Some of us play games based in futuristic settings whilst some of us play games based in fantasy or historical settings.

Making challenges like: ""castles,"" ""wizard's tower"" or ""sci fi beacon"" tends to limit submissions to the fraction of the user base who play in those particular settings. As a crafter, I'm not going to make terrain that I'm not going to be able to use.

Having challenges that EVERYONE can participate in would be paramount to the success of such challenges. Restriction / limitation challenges such as those above are generally open to EVERYONE, and that is what I like about them."

The main reason Europeans wear metal armour is that our rulesets reward it quite heavily, making it worth the expense and discomfort of wearing it. Plus, we really love to show off... And full armour looks impressive as fuck.

I've been hit with foam boffers, latex weapons, and silicone weapons a fair bit, and can say with some certainty that the difference in a latex and foam weapon is only about 20%. Even at full contact. However, full contact use of a latex weapon is fairly likely to damage the weapon itself. Silicone weapons are a good bit stiffer when they're brand new, but they soften with use. They start at about 40-50% harder than a boffer, but eventually soften to be even softer than latex!
