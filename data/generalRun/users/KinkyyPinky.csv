It literally united all the clans multiple times before in Mandalorian history; most recently during the time of the Empire.

This was in 8th grade. And one time I was working and talking and had 2 sticks taken away. Then just shut up and started thinking about what else I should add on to my drawing; apparently I was thinking for too long because the teacher went up to me and said I hadn’t drawn anything in a minute so I had detention. Tried to argue but she shut me down. She was a brand new young teacher so she had no clue what the fuck she was doing.
