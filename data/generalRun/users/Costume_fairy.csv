IllegallySmolCats,ff76zal,t1_ff6wn50,1579642352.0,"I have seen both and I can say, no it is not. Slime is just the classic “I am in a video game world, imma rule it” it’s the same thing as No game No life, rise of the shield hero, and many other anime before it. It’s funny but the action scenes are always anticlimactic and not too clever imo. This isn’t to say that Slime is bad, it’s just not the best.

Fullmetal Alchemist brotherhood has so much more depth to it.  The irony and foreshadowing  is pretty great. The world building in fmab is so much more creative regarding the wars and different races. It is a great example of what war can do to the soldiers. The author even interviewed people who were soldiers in WWII before writing the biggest war themed volume. The amount of human emotion in it is amazing. Also I give bonus points for not having strong but not sexualized women. It’s so difficult to find that kind of thing in a shonen, which is one of the reasons it has such a broad appeal."

I was 17 and at the doctors with my mom, they gave me a depression survey to fill out and at the end was the “do you think of hurting yourself” question and I put “sometimes” and that was the first time I admitted that I have depression to a doctor. 

The doctor didn’t even read the paper. I was a minor and legally she would have to tell my mom and she didn’t. That worsened my mental state so much because my brain reacted with “of course the doctor didn’t look at it, this is just life saying you’re not meant to live” and that was difficult to move past"
