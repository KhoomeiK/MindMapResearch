schizophrenia,ff71ltu,t3_erpumq,1579639317.0,"I've been on meds for awhile now and have not had auditory hallucinations in a good bit but they were so real that's it's really hard for me to believe it didn't happen. Like it's so real, sounded just like a person. But all logic tells me there's no way they happened so idk man even on the right meds it's hard dealing with something you perceive as reality as a hallucinations. 

My doc always asks me ""are you having any auditory or visual hallucinations""? And I'm always like ""how do I know?!"" 

I agree with another poster, you may be bipolar.. 

I am. I take invega, I hate the side effects. Love the fact that I don't think people are talking about me all the time. 

Best of luck."

bipolar,fc6e16n,t3_eg7o7m,1577478355.0,"That's one of the ways I know I'm manic, thinking nothing is wrong with me."
bipolar,fc6dx48,t3_eg8qjh,1577478281.0,I'm like that just take a moment to realize how grateful you are where you are now.
bipolar,fc6ckio,t3_eg6o2a,1577477398.0,"I can't say that I'm not anything else but when I'm manic I have different personalities. The worse is ""paranoia"" I feel like ""logic"" is the real me but there's also ""hypersexual"" &  ""antagonistic"". I probably do have something other than bipolar but I definitely relate."
bipolar,fc6b5bb,t3_egeotk,1577476474.0,I tried strattera. It was okay it gives more of a calm focus. It made me tired and didn't hello my depression though. I'm now on Wellbutrin it does a lot for my mood but still working on the ADHD portion.
bipolar,fc6b01k,t3_egeouv,1577476372.0,Did you go down on dose or your body just started to get used to it?
bipolar,fc6atcg,t1_fc69wuy,1577476246.0,"I was only out for a year but here's what I did it may not help but whatever. I found a temp agency to work with. This is good for multiple reasons, they're pretty relaxed on attendance so the times I have had to go to the doctor, I could take off.  I also keep a journal of symptoms right next to me (it's here now) to write down any weird feelings and I keep that for my doctor. I'm still in med adjusting mode and able to work full time without any issues (except maybe lack of concentration -ADHD) so if you've found the mix of medications that works for you before you enter the force, you're way ahead of me. Having a job has helped me keep on a schedule (before job I was sleeping 15 hours a day) and it has helped me become more observant of symptoms and med side effects. 

Best of luck!"
bipolar,fc69eux,t3_egbly9,1577475310.0,There are ticket to work programs for exactly this reason. I would look into it.
