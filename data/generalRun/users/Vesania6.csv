gaming,fc6r03d,t3_eggnyd,1577487267.0,The problem is not the always on pvp mode. It really is the dumbass feature of the map where you can see all players at all times. It literally makes 0 sense to me. It should have been something you have to pay for ( with the money you have ingame) that allows you to discover people around you or something. You wanna be a jackass all the time? gotta wprk for it cause you'll run out of money real quick. It would make the game way less annoying to play since you can't see everyone at all times.You think Al Capone was Broadcasting his moves to everyone in the city? It straight up 100% dumb.
NatureIsFuckingLit,fc4qv4z,t3_eg3na0,1577425118.0,This is soooo epic.
