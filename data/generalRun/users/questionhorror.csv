shittyrobots,fgkkl82,t3_ez053i,1580867732.0,I was literally going to say “imagine if this ended up on r/ShittyRobots” to imply this being very dangerous. Then I noticed I am looking at a post from r/ShittyRobots

residentevil,fg89vw4,t1_fg7tkcq,1580613450.0,Mainly the intro and one of the cutscenes. The intro has tons of violence cut out in the US version and the first zombie cutscene has a dude’s head fall off and that’s also missing. Probably some other stuff as well. The directors cut was supposed to add all of that back in and it didn’t.

Prostatitis,fg05zur,t3_ew4kr6,1580400970.0,They can. Make sure you’re seeing your urologist regularly and keeping them updated. Ask about prostate massages. They help. They’re painful but worth it.

xboxinsiders,ffo4oha,t1_ffo4brp,1580074128.0,Hopefully some of the insider team have seen this. They do float around the sub. You can tweet Xbox support and all that it be addressed. I’m not 100% sure how to send something straight to them.
xboxinsiders,ffo151a,t1_ffnmr5v,1580073060.0,"If you call again, ask to speak to a tier 2 tech and stay insistent until they transfer you. I doubt that they’ll be able to help though. This is or s my beyond what they can fix. It sounds more like a task for the development team."
xboxinsiders,ffnm0rb,t1_ffniaac,1580067671.0,"Might have just gotten a bad agent. 1st tier support usually don’t really troubleshoot, but instead go by a knowledge base or script. Here’s problem a, this is the prescribed solution for problem a. That didn’t fix it? Try one or two more things. If those don’t work, send to tier 2. I feel like they don’t usually venture outside of their script."
xboxinsiders,ffn35rk,t1_ffiskyw,1580061534.0,Yeah. Same. I’m not part of the insider program anymore and they don’t work for me either.

ResidentEvil2Remake,ff60ifo,t3_erv14z,1579615980.0,"Very thoughtful review. Mr. X ruins this game for me and the difficulty is a bit much. I was excited for this title and was mildly disappointed. It’s a great game, but I don’t feel like I can have a “casual” enjoyment of it with Mr. X constantly chasing me, no ammo, and bullet sponge zombies and lickers. My opinion, of course, is not popular. But to make my point, my first play through save is still in scenario A, and Leon is trapped in a save room with little ammo, Mr. X close by (or outside the door, possibly; can’t 100% remember) and a licker outside the door. 

I am super excited about 3. It may be my favorite of the series."
