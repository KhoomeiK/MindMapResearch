Yes, she felt like absolute shit from Friday to Sunday, but she is now Hep free for 16 years so far.

She sounds very calm and methodical in her abuse, as if she's not really even angry, just having fun with it. Do everything you can to document the behaviors that concern you and try to get some authority to help. Maybe even talk to a rescue group who can handle the delicate negotiations of removing a dog from owner who doesn't meet the legal threshold of abuse. I know some rescuers will start a dialog with people who are neglectful to start warming them up to the idea of surrendering the dog to them. It's worth a shot so that at least someone else is aware. If you know what vet she uses, maybe you could talk to them about it? It's tricky because you don't want her to get angry and stop using the vet or something like that.

If you don't pick up the grades in the subsequent semester, you are put on academic probation and then kicked out. Going from high school in GA to Dartmouth is also a huge culture shock, in addition to all the other adjustments kids have to make in college. It's possible the work load at Dartmouth is just more than the daughter anticipated or can handle. It's possible she's struggling in other ways and doesn't know how to ask for help since her mom will remove her from school. She could still salvage her grades and get off the warning, so I'd be more interested in learning why she's struggling. Dartmouth may not be the right school for her in the end, but I would encourage the mom to keep the communication open and find out what is going on with her daughter."
Dogtraining,fd5ces4,t3_ek30w6,1578176227.0,"First off, don't use the kennel as punishment, it should only be a positive association. Scolding him does nothing because he doesn't know what you are yelling about. You state that kenneling works, so keep doing that. When you release him from the crate, take him outside immediately until he relieves himself and then shower praise on him. 

The dog isn't purposely pooping inside to spite you, he just doesn't understand potty training yet. Start from the beginning, crate him and take outside every two hours, and praise for going outside. Don't scold and punish with the crate, and he should be able to get the hang of it."

This isn't a dog fight. Pitbulls are domesticated dogs, house pets, they do not hunt for food. Wolves aren't fighting, they are killing and eating for survival. Sub in tiger for wolf and it sounds just as ridiculous. 

Now, there are shepharding breeds designed to protect livestock from wolves and other predators and can often deter them, but generally only if adequately outfitted with protective gear like spiked collars. Your tough looking fur baby will still make a nice snack."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fcxtbxx,t1_fcx1yts,1578070112.0,"Every time some story about wolves attacking dogs comes up in various posts, some tough nuts always goes on about how their dogs can definitely take on a wolf or two. Thing is, I watched one of those videos recently and while the dogs were big and squared up to defend themselves, wolves aren't there to fight, they are there to kill. House pet dogs are rarely going to fight for the purpose of killing, it happens, but it's not their typical motivation in getting after it with another dog. So a big enough dog could maybe hold their ground for a minute with a single wolf, but it's still going to end up dead. A pack of wolves aren't angry or afraid and they sure aren't looking for a dog fight, they are looking for dinner and a pet dog is easy pickings, no matter how tough the owner thinks it is."

Earlier in the year, I attended an event featuring Malala Yousafzai that was heavily attended by young girls and school groups.

But when they all started *editing, cropping, filtering, captioning and whisper debating where to post them*, with the light of the phones shining in my face, and freaking MALALA on stage in front of them speaking about her life, I had had enough. They were appropriately cowed into compliance and quietly apologized. They were good kids!

AmItheAsshole,fcnumdf,t1_fcnnwd7,1577818743.0,"This dude sounds way ahead of the curve that the rest of the world is still catching up on, that social media is poisonous and damaging to invest oneself in. Facebook is destroying democracies, instagram is destroying self esteem and self worth in both adults and children and snapchat is doing whatever evil snapchat does. Here's someone who has never felt compelled to post pictures of a bowl of noodles before eating them, write inane self referential status updates, vacation porn, thirst trap selfies, etc. He sounds like a  person who values experiences and interactions irl without the boost of likes and chasing views. He's probably young enough to be googeable, as in he'll show up in searches about high school, colleges, and yes, marriage records. He is just immune to cyber stalking his social media profiles.
You can still find surprising thing about people without having Facebook. I once googled the phone number of a guy I was going on a date with because I literally wasn't sure of his name (we'd met at a noisy party and I suddenly wasn't sure if I'd gotten his name mixed up with someone else). Turns out he had posted a question in a forum about mopeds and casually mentioned that he had 5 or 6 kids (!?). Certainly not a crime, but not what I was looking for in a partner. I went on the date with him because what's the harm in meeting for a drink? Well, he turned out to be crazy and the kids were from  3 different mothers, as I'd feared. He even talked about how I looked good to have a baby with... So lesson learned, Google your dates and ask questions in person!"

I know my dog couldn't do it for all the reasons I'm in this sub, but I also think how stressful it must be for dogs. Unless it's in your own or close family's backyard where they are familiar, going to a strange new location, surrounded by new people, being handled by the best man or some other wedding party member, who may or may not know the dog, then not being able to act normal around is humans (no jumping, kissing, running etc) and then being led away to where? Home? A hotel room? Being either left alone, tromped on by guests, crowds, kids; food food everywhere but none for thee... Blaring music, drunk people (I know, someone would be minding the dog, but still) And it goes on!
