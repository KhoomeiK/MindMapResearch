And once that happened the inevitable us vs them came. And that is the biggest issue. In the attempt to want to fit in the LGBT community start developing pockets of communities instead of comming together. It's kinda like the whole light skin vs dark skin thing with the black pride movement when it first started. You have to have one single group and not multiple division of groups.
