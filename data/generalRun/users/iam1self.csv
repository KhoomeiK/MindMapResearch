Here’s what has worked for me. It continues to work for 5 years now. 

Once i decided to end it 5 years ago i decided what could possibly happen that I couldn’t just end it if it was too much. (Not accounting for being raped or kidnapped or extreme shit like that... ijs)

So i got rid of everything, as per the plan, started living in my van. Made plans to do only amazing things worth living for. Like FUCK IT IM OUT if it’s not exactly what i want to be doing. 

Ive lived in New Orleans, Raleigh, Portland, and where ever else i feel like getting a job. Ive driven the PCH w my 17yo kid. Visited friends that “lived too far to visit.” Right now im in Costa Rica, solo, chilin. I have a number of romantic partners that care about me and want me happy. (Only 1 knows i get depressed and she always helps me travel even tho i never ask. She lowkey puts money in my accout when she sees me post on ig) my life is literally AMAZING right now. 

I have ankylosing spondylitis and am recovering from the edge of kidney falure. Didn’t fail but was literally 0.1 away. 

So not only do i want to die... my body is already starting the process early. So i’ll have my wish sooner than most anyway. 

Idk if this is advise as much as it is perspective. 
Not to change your mind, shit mine isnt changed lol, but change your life for exactly what you want.  Live that as long as you want. You can die later. Lol 

Peace yo."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fcrtdn2,t1_fcrra1w,1577906359.0,"I feel like cheating is essentially lying to someone. I never lied. Each person knew there were other people. There were no real expectations of monogamy. 

What i would hide is the number. Most people in this situation would assume, which was the case usually, “oh he’s probably seeing one other woman.” It wasnt until they asked explicitly that i told them how many others there were. All women at some point made a jab/joke about the others. 

I never dated insecure women. 

Only 2 ever asked. I always told the truth. The others never asked. Even after things ended they never asked. 

So no cheating. Emotional or otherwise. I had the capacity both emotionally and physically for each of them individually. They always felt super special. I even told them early on, small things like “i will never be with you and texting someone else.” 

That’s kind of how my system developed. I would answer/reply to my kid or mom or the homies casually. But i needed to be able to tell how much attention the phone call warranted before pulling it out. Lol know i sound crazy af lol Open relationships take a lot of effort. Next level shit."

I can feel the downvotes coming so i will add this- hate me if you want... but i am genuine friends with all of my romantic partners from my past except 2. Like we talk fairly often and see eachother when we are in the same city, as friends. 

The two that i dont talk to, well one was a lesbian and told me she would use me and then toss me when she was done. The other broke my heart so hard i couldnt  be friends w her. Karma if you will. I accept that.
