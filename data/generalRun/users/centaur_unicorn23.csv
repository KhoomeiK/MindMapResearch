AskReddit,ff8g0e6,t3_es1gaf,1579676835.0,"I used to work for Columbia House DVDS as a telemarketer selling movies over the phone. I think it was around 2005 or so. My base pay was around $10, but we would get commission depending on the number of movies we could sell. We'll ya boy sold the shit out of those dvds. My pitch was airtight. Within 10 seconds I could figure out who the person was and how to sell to them. From the South? Country westerns. From a black neighbourhood? Madea's family reunion. I was like buddy from that movie Boiler Room. ...Sir what's your favourite actor? Tom Cruise? Great have you seen Mission impossible 3 yet? etc etc. All that commission gave me an extra $10 on my hourly wage giving me $20 an hour as a 20yr old, back in 2005. Needless to say they changed their commission structure, but only after I taught a few more people how to sell better."

2) I'm a star trek fan, but sometimes the terms are complex and it helps to read the dialogue 

3) movies suck. The action scenes are way to loud and the dialogue way to quiet. LOTR is the worst at this."

AskReddit,fej07fw,t3_ep8avp,1579152289.0,"I tweaked my back and ignored it, not realizing it would slowly seize up in a matter of an hour. 1 hour later, i'm at a dog park with my dog and the pain hits and my back seizes up and i fall to the ground. I'm a pretty athletic guy but if you've had back problems you know the pain can be quite severe. I tried several times to get up but couldn't. A few people came by and were asking me if I was okay but none of them really helped me out. I had no one to call except a neighbour I wasn't really that tight with. He rushed to the dog park (20 min away), took care of my dog, and with his help I was able to slowly walk to his car (with most of my weight on him). I can't tell you how much pain I was in. He drove me back to my condo and made sure I was in my place. That same night I called another neighbour to take my dog to go pee since I couldn't move and she was a sweetheart. She brought me some anti inflammatories to deal with the pain along with some back cream. Since I couldn't move and was in severe pain I called another buddy and told him my predicament. He immediately came over with some percs for the pain. I never ask anyone for anything so it was hard to depend on people, but I also appreciate and think about those people who helped me when I needed it most."

I was a teenager and needed a job, but eventually It really wore me down and I couldn't do it anymore. I hated the idea of adding to someone's debt. I also sold columbia house DVD's over the phone and had NO problem with that. Hey if you buy Madea's family reunion over the phone that's on you."
