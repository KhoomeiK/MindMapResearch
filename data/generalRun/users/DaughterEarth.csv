Countries are fine if they are around the replacement rate. Most are below it which causes issues. We need to acknowledge it's an issue so we can figure out how to manage it.

It made studying much easier."
PlayTemtem,fendd3o,t1_femvphu,1579282271.0,"I feel like this is age related. I was in teen years when Digimon was a thing so I secretly liked it for a year then forgot about it because it wasn't ""cool"" anymore. So I have a lot more nostalgia towards Pokemon, and so it is more fun to watch now.

I wonder how I'd feel if I was a kid when Digimon was already established. I do remember it being more serious and that I liked that the ""pets"" interacted with the people more."
aww,fenbixc,t1_fenb42o,1579281148.0,"I should have realized you took it literally. For people like you I should have phrased it as ""this is a good example of how kids can be taught to be gentle and it irritates me that some parents don't think they can.""

But most people understood it it as such, so nah. Not gonna carefully pad what I say."
aww,fenb8la,t1_fen7fbi,1579280970.0,Yah of course it takes time. And that's fine assuming the lessons are consistent and they're monitored when around animals until they get it.
aww,fenayaf,t1_femxu4g,1579280793.0,I'm not talking to any specific person though? I'm just saying I disagree with parents that laugh off bad behavior and think it can't be corrected. I'm not going to tell someone how to parent but I'm definitely allowed to believe some people do parts of it wrong. I'm not forcing anything by participating in a public forum. You're in the wrong place if you don't want to read opinions
aww,fenasdo,t1_femvrx0,1579280688.0,I've heard a number of people laugh off bad behavior their kid shows.
aww,femssiq,t1_femp27h,1579268583.0,Gotta show this video to all the parents that think they can't teach their young kids how to be gentle and cautious with animals
instantkarma,fek1fes,t1_fejiadb,1579190551.0,Lol there you go
instantkarma,fejfwo4,t1_fej7grt,1579172298.0,"That guy's comment is just as likely to be bullshit. Why do you guys automatically believe the ""callout,"" even when it has no evidence? You're not being skeptical if you believe the person you agree with. Skeptical means you require proof."
therewasanattempt,feglyif,t1_fegh8ap,1579096820.0,Lol these people are so sensitive even hair color sets them off. They should move to a mennonite colony or something
facepalm,feduerk,t1_fed8sjd,1579020108.0,That's pretty silly to let a few idiots influence you that much.
facepalm,fedu7xl,t1_fed82dm,1579019992.0,"exactly, what ppw said is what the vast majority of this site's users agree with"
funny,fedtrno,t1_fedtbse,1579019719.0,"radiators are nice, I undersand"
Damnthatsinteresting,fedt9l7,t1_fedsvhz,1579019411.0,It still seems like conspiracy theory thinking to me. A skeptical mind is a good thing but it's a bit ridiculous to think that not stating your country means you're spreading misinformation.
