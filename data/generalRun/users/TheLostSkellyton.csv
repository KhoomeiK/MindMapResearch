DnD,ffdtxvk,t3_et2jmk,1579828846.0,"As a DM, having new players at my table is a unique privilege.  I get to introduce them to D&D!  That's so cool!

Your DM should tell you what kind of time commitment to expect.  Some groups meet every week for a few hours, others meet every other week or once a month.  This is really a question only your DM can answer.

&#x200B;

Roleplaying to me is telling a story.  You create a character full of motivations, goals, hopes, fears, likes, dislikes, etc., and then you proceed to tell their story in everything you do.  Talking in character is a particular skill/preference that not everyone has or wants, and it's perfectly okay to narrate your actions by saying something like ""Steve (your character) looks the wizard in the eye and says ""I don't believe you.""  In this example, your narration has told the story that Steve is a) smart or mistrustful enough to be suspicious of the wizard, and b) Steve is bold enough to tell him so to his face - congratulations, you just roleplayed, no acting necessary. 

&#x200B;

Should you play D&D?  I think it's worth a try."
CasualConversation,ffdrl3a,t3_esz1q3,1579827199.0,"If you don't mind working out at home, I've started workout routines from The Body Coach on YouTube.  He does 15-minute high-intensity workouts that can be done in small spaces and with no equipment.  The reason they work for me - besides being short, thus doable every day - is that I don't get bored the way I normally do during a workout because they are challenging while still feasible.  I'm not sure what's different about his workouts, but they are working for me."
DMAcademy,ffdpy48,t3_et17gz,1579826157.0,"As far as what they can do at the ball goes, I think a lot of that is going to depend on you coming up with a good story about who the host is, and who they invited besides the party.  What is their position in society - are they major players, minor players, social climbers, objects of affection, objects of suspicion?  Do they throw these balls because they enjoy it, or because they have to due to their social status?  What are they hoping to get out of the event?  With that in mind, who did they invite?  Who wrangled for an invitation, and who is just there out of obligation or boredom?  What do the host's servants think of them, and what kind of gossip can they be convinced to part with?  What kind of social/political games would the attendees be coming to play?  Once you know who is throwing the ball, and why, that should open up a lot of story hooks for the party. 

&#x200B;

Also, if you want to craft the session around the host sneaking out for whatever purpose, you can do that without needing the party to pass a perception check.  If you decide to make it a check and the party fails it- and you don't *have* to make it a check, it's okay to make this event part of a linear story - eventually, NPCs will notice that Lord or Lady So-and-So is missing, and they will comment about it.  You can still add an element of chance and surprise by making things with the missing host happen in the background while the party is still figuring out that they are missing or taking their time deciding to act on it."

CasualConversation,ffd3fx2,t1_ffd2lu1,1579812663.0,"Well, this campaign is for an old friend.  We only know each other online (though we are finally meeting this July!!!), so we play over Google Hangouts video calls.

What I love about DMing one on one for him is the constant back and forth of being able to create, tell, and advance a story together.  I have a lot more stake in the story than I do with a party of 4+ players, and it forces me to be a lot more creative and proactive than I am with a large table.  I like being able to focus my writing on one player, even though I frequently can't predict where he will go with a plot hook.  Even with the necessary limitations that one player presents (not just throwing him into combat left right and center, for instance), I find writing for one to be very liberating because I have this focused, directed story of a unique (fictional) life.

Something else I find rewarding is that it's a pretty intimate experience - and I'm guessing that is where the awkward part came in for you. :)  D&D is a great way to learn more about yourself, even if you are roleplaying someone completely different, and we have had some pretty deep conversations post-game where we learned something about ourselves, and our friendship has really grown from that."

This fall, I started running my first homebrew campaign: a solo adventure for the friend who is in turn DMing one for me - we couldn't get a group together but still wanted to play, so this was the logical outcome and it's lots of fun.  Writing a campaign vs. running a module (which is all I had done previously) is so different...it's both more work, and less work, all at the same time.  Writer's block is my biggest enemy, but somehow I always pull through before making my player wait too long. :D
