unpopularopinion,fejy0dc,t1_fejrxy9,1579188427.0,"That’s on point. Prior to columbine the majority of America thought of bullying as a totally normal ‘kids will be kids’ issue instead of anything real. Columbine changed all that when it was revealed that Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris we’re both severely bullied (right-wingers tried and failed to blame it on video games). Does that excuse what they did? **Hell no!** The vast majority of bulling victims grow up to become decent full functioning adults.
All I saying is that, while was those two kids did was undeniably the most horrendously shitty thing you can do, a lot of good came out of it because it forced society to acknowledge that kids being shitty to one another is a terrible thing. 

Rant over."

unpopularopinion,fee3iu9,t3_eod0mb,1579025645.0,"So here goes. Everyone deserves to to be treated with respect. I don't have to respect you to treat you like I do. You're a person, I'm a person. I don't know you and vice versa. You could be an asshole or a single mom/dad working two jobs to support your kids and deadbeat spouse while going to school. Some people wrongly treat other people in service positions like they are 'less then' because of the stereotype that people working in these positions deserve that for some reason. Because who in their right mind could ever ENJOY flipping burgers ate mcDonalds, right? /s."

HumansBeingBros,feapaj8,t3_eo5aav,1578951011.0,"So my thoughts on this. Best buy was right to fire her. AP/LP employees are, often, not trained police officers or investigators. Their job is to observe, gather evidence, and report, that's it. Large companies, such as Best Buy are insured out the butt for this type of petty crap so it's not worth fighting over. Let the police get them."
