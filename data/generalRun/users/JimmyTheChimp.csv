todayilearned,fe50ajs,t1_fe1n5ig,1578864498.0,My friend always struggled with ch sounds e.g. chimney was always pronounced shimney.
todayilearned,fdqikqz,t1_fdqib5l,1578667554.0,You are aware there is a difference between US and UK English right?
todayilearned,fdqai6d,t1_fdq9xba,1578661183.0,"I definitely agree to some extent but in asia the english level changes so much. I've been to Korea where the average young person speaks pretty good English, Thailand where people speak enough to get by and I live in Japan where even in the big city at tourist information desks peoples English fucking sucks."
todayilearned,fdq3jzr,t1_fdq35pp,1578653144.0,Yeah I've only been to Berlin and know German people that actually lived/lived in England. They have always had perfect English.
todayilearned,fdq0aus,t1_fdpv7m4,1578648512.0,"This is definitely the case for people from Germany, Netherlands, Sweden and that general area. They have perfect English especially as they have learnt exact grammar in class compared to native slang us native speakers learn from people around us.

Well, I have definitely learnt that Germany's English fucking sucks apparently."

AskReddit,fdgmrqw,t1_fdgd79z,1578402528.0,"I'm more of a 00's era emo kid, and a lot of the bands in that decade were probably all more pop punk it was more the dress sense and attitudes of the people back a new form of emo. FOB, Paramore, Green Day's American Idiot are all emo idols and are all pop punk. Then bands like MCR with their first two albums are 'emo' but really its metal. Emo and Scene kids definitely listened to a mix of different kinds of music, I think it was more just a fashion than one type of music.

Grunge bands and prog rock bands like Radiohead are way more fucking depressing and 'emotional'. Even Mogwai playing with no vocals is sadder in my opinion."
AskReddit,fdgm2f6,t1_fdggt97,1578401882.0,"Man I did not like the vocals or the drums, but the backing noise is super fucking cool. That repetitive alarm in the back sounds like something I would expect from a track decades later."
worldnews,fddivvk,t1_fddgom3,1578314075.0,"I know the slippery slope argument is always an easy one to make. But I think people should be allowed to speak complete shit because if we start censoring the obviously reprehensible comments where do we draw the line on what is still reprehensible. I do believe the limit is when violence is incited, which does make things tricky I'll admit. 

But I believe people should be allowed platforms to say disgusting thing, it allows the people to come out and say that they don't agree and we can progress as a country. Being gay used reprehensible in every single country by most people, but people were allowed their right to speak out and protest and slowly some countries came to realise that progression was necessary and it was the will of the people to legalise these kinds of relationships.

Censorship just kills discussion and progression."
AskReddit,fd42r8g,t1_fd3jm72,1578163826.0,"Hmmmm, I completely forgot about that! Right now im only conversational and not fluent in Japanese but once my contract is up that is definitely something I'll look into."
AskReddit,fd3238f,t1_fd2jemd,1578154012.0,"I just moved to Fukui 3 months ago. I revisited Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe after not having been there since I came to Japan on holiday 3 years ago. Man the cities are so different once you live in Japan, they all looked the same as each other and the sleazy bars trying to get foreigners in are just all depressing, the magic of Japanese cities you get as a tourist is lacking. I couldn't wait to get back to my tiny town which has nothing in it. 

Once I get my N2/3 and feel confident speaking Japanese I definitely want to take a year in the city back in the service industry which I prefer to teaching, but until then I'm fine where I am."
AskReddit,fd2zzfe,t1_fd270s0,1578153391.0,I dated a Japanese girl for a few months she said her school used to allow girls to go to school in regular clothes and change at school. She said she was never once touched out of uniform.
todayilearned,fcun20b,t3_eiz951,1577984510.0,I am always amazed by the amount of people on YouTube who take the time to upload the most obscure shit. Do you need to know how to reboot your 1994 carphone? Someone has a channel dedicated to car phones. Do you have a TV ad from 1965 on the tip of your tongue? Someone has a channel dedicated to adverts from the 60's. But I sometimes try to reply to comments on Reddit but get 2 words in and close the page.
AskReddit,fcgpkb0,t1_fcgkqgo,1577642740.0,I mean its not a sponge? just rinse it off with some bleach or just household cleaner.
DoesAnybodyElse,fbjomwf,t3_edmyuj,1576937418.0,When I used to study music technology something that would take a a few hours through different lessons would be explained 1000000 times better by a 15 year old on an unregistered hypercam 2.
