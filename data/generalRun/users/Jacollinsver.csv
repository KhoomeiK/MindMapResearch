NoStupidQuestions,fesetie,t3_eqftee,1579364467.0,"Short answer: it would probably be healthier for dogs to eat different things everyday, just like humans do, but that would be very expensive for their owners, so we opt to give them kibble their entire lives and since they only get real food as scrap or special occasions, they don't really know the difference. Ignorance really is bliss sometimes.

Longer addendum: you might be looking at this in the wrong way. humans have insanely low stomach acid levels and gut size (comparative to the rest of the animal kingdom on average), and cannot sustainably digest raw matter. **We have literally evolved to ""pre-digest"" our food before consumption in the form of cooking it.** Humans cannot extract nutrients from raw grain and leaves, like ungulates, and we aren't great at extracting nutrients from raw meat, like carnivores. Our stomachs are so weak, that we are also susceptible to sickness: a food that we would consider disgustingly corrupt with parasites and bacteria, will be happily munched on by most other things. So preserving food became another tactic: we started using plants that naturally have preservative properties, or spices, and using them in many different fashions to preserve our food. **This has meant another evolution: we have evolved to 'like' spices, since the inclusion of spice in food generally will mean less risk of infection or parasites.** In fact, spices are the way they are as a defense mechanism, and are completely toxic to many animals, and even if not toxic, will hurt other animals, like dogs. It is theorized by vets that many dogs die because of digestion problems involved with being fed human food. Regardless, the point being that we have literally evolved as creatures that overly flavor their food through preservative plants and cooking, so that we can compensate for a lack of gut size and strength. 

So it's not that the dog's diet is bland. It's that our diet is incredibly flavorful."
