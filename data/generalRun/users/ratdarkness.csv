I don't think your daughter damaged the laptop if she really is the innocent angel you say she is.

Grief can really mess with you and make you make some stupid decisions. 
It's possible they didn't truely comprehend the warnings if you didn't explain in a way they'd understand. If you just said ""the van is a heap of shit"" that doesn't really explain the situation well. If you went into too much mechanical detail it may have gone over their heads. 

You said yourself ""You're the only one who can ""save"" them."" This implies to me a bus home may not be the best or safest way home. Or that buses may not be regular.

Your mum was totally right to say it would be best to cut her hair. Also your daughter agreed it wasn't forced on her. The long hair was by your husband.

Your FIL has your husband brainwashed. 

Do you have a close friend/family member  who can stand by you and help during the rest of your pregnancy and delivery? You need it to be as less stressful as you can get it. 

I'd concider going alone (in secret if necessary) to your obgyn explain the situation and possibly discuss the option of being induced like a week early or something? This may seem extreme but I feel the situation is extreme. Or perhaps say you don't want them near you and take measures for security to keep them out of the hospital??? 

Whatever you choose, I suggest you inform the staff at the hospital they're band from the delivery room.
