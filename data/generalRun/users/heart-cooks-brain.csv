>Democrats remember that we are a nation of immigrants. We recognize the extraordinary contribution of immigrants to America throughout our history. We welcome legal immigrants to America. We support a legal immigration policy that is pro-family, pro-work, pro-responsibility, and pro-citizenship, and we deplore those who blame immigrants for economic and social problems.

>We know that citizenship is the cornerstone of full participation in American life. We are proud that the President launched Citizenship USA to help eligible immigrants become United States citizens. The Immigration and Naturalization Service is streamlining procedures, cutting red tape, and using new technology to make it easier for legal immigrants to accept the responsibilities of citizenship and truly call America their home

... 

>However, as we work to stop illegal immigration, we call on all Americans to avoid the temptation to use this issue to divide people from each other. We deplore those who use the need to stop illegal immigration as a pretext for discrimination. And we applaud the wisdom of Republicans like Mayor Giuliani and Senator Domenici who oppose the mean-spirited and short-sighted effort of Republicans in Congress to bar the children of illegal immigrants from schools -- it is wrong, and forcing children onto the streets is an invitation for them to join gangs and turn to crime. Democrats want to protect American jobs by increasing criminal and civil sanctions against employers who hire illegal workers, but Republicans continue to favor inflammatory rhetoric over real action. We will continue to enforce labor standards to protect workers in vulnerable industries. We continue to firmly oppose welfare benefits for illegal immigrants. We believe family members who sponsor immigrants into this country should take financial responsibility for them, and be held legally responsible for supporting them."
HydroHomies,ffi4jog,t3_etp2b5,1579964875.0,"I was at a dance club at a resort in Mexico once. I ordered water after water, to the point that the bartender was like, no more water, get free beer, *no. more. water.* So I conceded. I like beer, too. But water is better when you're shaking your fanny all night long.

And then some guy in our group that I didn't know and didn't know me saw me drinking my beer after all that dancing and assumed I must have been drunk and took my beer from me. Like, off my face and out of my hand mid drink. I rolled my eyes and left after that. 

That was 2 men that I didn't know in one night that told me what I could and couldn't drink. Pissed me off. All I wanted was some mother fuckin H2O."
