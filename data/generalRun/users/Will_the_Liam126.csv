You are doing exactly what they want. They will take a slow longterm approach just like a frog in boiling water. By the time you realize it it'll be too late. Of course they won't outright ban guns.

I'm not on board with free healthcare but obviously something is very wrong with our system and we need something radically different to change it. Honestly I couldn't give a full answer as to what that may be but I've read enough on the wait time difference to see a specialist doctor in free healthcare countries and ours to not want free healthcare

Birthright citizenship was never ever intended for not nationalized foreigners so I'll have to disagree with you. It sucks but countries don't survive by being weak. 

I believe the decline of traditional nuclear families and traditional societal standards is a driving cause of todays shooting problem. Combine that with a guarantee that in todays economy you won't be as successful as your parents, you won't own a home, and you can't fulfill your dreams you end up with shootings by people feel abandoned by society and find hope in groups and ideas that promise radical change through radical actions and thoughts."

I'm all for humane treatment of other people. But that doesn't mean I want them here or am okay with upwards of 30 million illegals invading our land. 

Wanna give free vaccinations to illegals during the deportation process? Fine idc. Wanna give them decent food and sleeping arrangements as they wait for deportation? Again sure I'm all for it. Whatever basic necessities they need to be relatively comfortable and taken care of is fine as long as they are deported for breaking our laws and leeching off our system.
