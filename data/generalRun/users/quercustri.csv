cats,fd6c14z,t3_ejw6ot,1578188667.0,"If that's a picture of him on the examination table, that's the chillest cat I've ever seen. Our cat is very calm at the vet but clearly hates every second of it. He looks like he's having a relaxing day at the beach"
cats,fd691zx,t3_ek2yg7,1578187386.0,I didn't realize how loudly cats could snore until we got our senior kitten. She snores so loudly you can hear it across the room and it's adorable.  You clearly have a cute little snorey snuggle there!

cats,fd677gd,t1_fd3c2hs,1578186529.0,"Btw, tortoiseshell is not a breed, just refers to a color pattern in cats. Cat breed don't work like dog breeds, where you can pretty much take any dog and figure out what breed or mix of breeds it is. Unless your cat came from a breeder or there's overwhelming evidence that it is a particular breed, it's just a ""domestic shorthair"" or ""domestic longhair."""

cats,fcj7n1z,t1_fchtd8q,1577679299.0,"I feel the same about Norwegian Forest Cats. Not quite as striking looking as Coons, but I not-so-secretly want one even though I will probably only ever have ""mutt"" rescues.  A girl can always dream about having a big ol' waterproof floof to go skiing with..."
