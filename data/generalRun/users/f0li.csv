Thats bullshit and its proved by the graph.

He didn't steer shit, he just didn't knock it off the rails. Though we are going to be paying for his idiotic trade war for another decade or more. Rest assured, his policies are starting to take hold, and the economy will suffer because of it. Its just a lagging indicator ...."
