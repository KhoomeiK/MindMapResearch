orchids,ffexb3c,t3_et9p24,1579869251.0,It works best to stake them when they are still small and then train the spike on the stake gradually. At this point the spike will not be as flexible and you would probably break it.

Professors,fedie4n,t3_eolpe8,1579012311.0,"Reach out to the department chair and see if they have any suggestions, or ask if they can circulate an email among the faculty for leads on housing. Sometimes you can work out a sublet or shorter term lease that way, or you can take over an apartment that some other junior faculty member or grad student is leaving (so it's somewhat vetted, even if you haven't seen it yourself).

In my experience, most people will end up signing a 12 month lease. The way the job cycles work, if you are starting a VAP position in August, 2020, then you would likely be starting a new position somewhere else in August, 2021- so you'd move in July, which works out okay if your lease is through July 31st or Aug 1.

You can also speak to the landlord and tell them up front that you know you're there for 9 months, but you aren't sure after that. Some landlords will be flexible (especially for university faculty... we are usually decent tenants). But some won't and you'll have to commit to 12 months. Just depends on the location and the norms of the local rental market."

I love teaching. I sincerely love my interactions with my students and enjoy working with them. It is my favorite part of the job.

Professors,fcqdntg,t3_eid0ye,1577883931.0,"There are pros and cons to different ways of structuring review sessions. 

If I do it in class - people who skip class regularly will show up on review day and expect me to teach stuff to them, and then of course they will perform better on the exam by having attended that one review class after skipping a bunch of the regular lectures, which doesn’t seem right. Also, in my experience, students don’t make the most of an in class review by prepping ahead of time. They don’t ask questions, they won’t have looked over the study guide ahead of the review. And so it end up as a “re-teaching” more than a review.

If you do it outside of class, it is impossible to do this at a time that will work for everyone who wants to be there. So you will have hardworking, contentious students who would want to come to a review but won’t be able to. Or- as one of my colleagues recently experienced, you take the time to set up a review and then sit and wait around but no one shows up. Though the people who do show up to an out of classtime review are usually pretty solid students. 

I have quit doing review sessions, but occasionally if I have a TA I will ask them to host out of class exam reviews. I don’t usually get TAs though at my university."

People who advise against it are likely doing so because the academic job market is rough and for people who want to go into academia, they may find themselves struggling (but this applies to nearly all PhDs, regardless of field). But geography is a creative field with a lot of diversity in terms of what you can focus on, and that can translate into different professional options later on.
