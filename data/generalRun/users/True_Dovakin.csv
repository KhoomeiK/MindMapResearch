Then he discovered Salem was truly immortal. That his closest allies had kept him in the dark and from his point of view, constantly stabbed him in the back while he was doing his best to reunite the world and put up a fighting chance. That despite all the secrecy and countermeasures he was still a step behind. All the while, the people around him pushed back because they didn’t know what was going on; for if they did, despair and chaos would only rise to higher levels. 

I’m not saying his choices are right, but you have to place yourself in his shoes. He’s a exhausted man driven to paranoia and drastic measures by the presence of Salem’s operatives and constant defeats. His resources are stretched to the breaking point and his allies push against every action due to their beliefs that it is possible to save everyone despite not having the means to do so. From a military standpoint, a retrograde and refit is the sound choice as compared to losing more troops and resources to save a doomed city. This isn’t a war anymore; Ironwood is facing the apocalypse. And when a group of teenagers crash into his door and say that they know better when they have little experience, less political sense and a minuscule sense of the state of the world, then why should he listen?

HumansBeingBros,ferev83,t3_eqe0u7,1579353075.0,"I believe something of the sort happened to me, although I don’t know if it’s actually 100%

I picked up Warhammer 40k in late middle school, if memory serves correctly. During that time GW America HQ was in Glen Burnie, MD. I used to write them back and forth, but what’s important is that in my first letter I drew a design for a “Bolt Rifle” that had longer range and better damage power than the standard Bolter, partly because my Orks kept demolishing my brothers Space Marines and I wanted him to be able to stand a chance by keeping me at range. I actually got sent the Shrine of the Aquila box set for this! (it was priced at $50 so for a middle schooler that was huge, plus it was our first model terrain piece). 

Come years down the line, I believe in summer 2017 (junior year of college) I read about the new line of Space Marines coming out, the Primaris Marines. I look at them and behold, there is the bolt rifle as their standard weapon. I don’t know if it’s remotely possible, but I like to believe they may have kept my design on backburner. I never wrote them or anything since the likelihood of them keeping a letter from a middle schooler is effectively zero. I don’t even want credit or anything, just to see if the idea was possibly influenced by little me in any way. 

It’s cool to think about. I still have the letters they sent me at my parent’s house, and can post them in...about three-four months for proof if needed, since I won’t be near there til then"

But “After the Tet Offensive, many PAVN units incorporated light tanks such as the Type 62 Type 59 tank., BTR-60, Type 60 artillery, amphibious tanks (such as the PT-76) and integrated into new war doctrines as a mobile combined-arms force.[287] The PAVN started receiving experimental Soviet weapons against ARVN forces, including MANPADS 9K32 Strela-2 and anti-tank missiles, 9M14 Malyutka. By 1975, they had fully transformed from the strategy of mobile light-infantry and using the people's war concept used against the United States.[287]”.

Iran is “modernized” if you count using equipment as old as 1970s in a force as modern (Looking at those F-14/16s).

He fought to kill and destroy his enemy, and he was good at it in V3. Same with Neo when she fought Yang. She toyed with her the entire fight and if it were not for the intervention of Raven Yang would’ve been dead. Neo has always been best villain for me after that scene (although Mercury is close second, cause he’s a smug ass that’s also competent)

So everyone hates Cinder for whacking Pyrrha (i understand, she was great) but I enjoyed the fact that she closed with and destroyed her enemy. Sure she’s evil and has bad motives, but she also wiped the floor with the then-most powerful characters and made sure they stayed down (Ozpin aside). 

I get that people like the good guys to win. I like it too, and it keeps the show from being super depressing. But at the same time, showing a competent, cunning, and ruthless enemy not only makes the fights seem so much more dire, but makes you question the limits of plot-armor; this was especially evident after Season 3. The show isn’t fun imo if good wins every battle. Winning the war is one thing, but if every fight ends with good guys winning without a scratch then is it even a good fight to begin with?"

AskReddit,fcy89bw,t3_ejhf21,1578076201.0,"I used to spam click the map in WoT when it was clear that 12 of the enemy tanks are OVER THERE and our team doesn’t react at all, because clearly they are all blind and unaware of what a map is. I would watch as they slowly get rolled over from the rear, with nearly a third of them not even reacting until it’s too late.

Snikich was awesome. Murdered lords left and right. I had him in a themed army that did well into lategame, until he ironically got ambushed by empire deathstacks. 

Deleting Lothern off the map right after they got confederated with Nagarythe was amazing. No more Tyrion, no Alith, no Teclis. Wiped 53 settlements off the map. It was the best feeling I’ve had in a TW game. Also the delete navy button is great. 

The recruitment costs weren’t that much of a struggle imo. I just ran deathrunners as chaff for my wind mortars until i got my allegiance with Mors up.
