Such words also criticize polygamy, divorce, and many other alternatives to traditional marriage.

todayilearned,ffll770,t1_ffkts7d,1580040943.0,"That's hotly debated in archaeology and seems to be a bit racist tbh. A lot of people don't want to call it a sword because they want the sword to be a European invention. They're already dealing with the fact Asia has its own sword history. Adding in America, a place totally separated, would ruin their pride.

So they say it's not a sword. But it's clearly got all the characteristics of one."

The distinction that makes a sword what it is and not another thing is wide, but generally accepted to be that which you can stab and slice with, as well as do swordsmanship with. You cannot do that with a club, an axe, or a bow. You cannot do that with a Macuahuitl either, because it is a club, not a sword."

HistoryMemes,ffjralh,t1_ffjq43o,1580004880.0,"I should mention also that the Natives appear to have had more advanced ships of some kind as a number of battles recorded in the sagas were naval invasions by the native Americans to try to surround and flank them. They also apparently had some kind of ballista. There is a battle which took place probably somewhere in Maine or New England that is recorded by both Viking sagas and Algonquian oral traditions. These tales speak about large ballista-like weapons the size of a car that could take down an entire canoe, *or long ship*, in a single shot. The sagas call them ""demon heads"" for their ferocity and describe them as follows (Skræling is what the vikings called the natives):

>When that time was gone by, there was seen approaching from the south a great crowd of Skrælingar boats, coming down upon them like a stream, the staves this time being all brandished in the direction opposite to the sun's motion, and the Skrælingar were all howling loudly. Then took they and bare red shields to meet them. They encountered one another and fought, and there was a great shower of missiles. The Skrælingar had also war-slings, or catapults.

>Then Karlsefni and Snorri see that the Skrælingar are bringing up poles, with a very large ball attached to each, to be compared in size to a sheep's stomach, dark in colour; and these flew over Karlsefni's company towards the land, and when they came down they struck the ground with a hideous noise. This produced great terror in Karlsefni and his company, so that their only impulse was to retreat up the country along the river, because it seemed as if crowds of Skrælingar were driving at them from all sides. And they stopped not until they came to certain crags. There they offered them stern resistance.

It's fair to say that the Native Americans that Britain and France met in New England were significantly less violent and war like from the ones the Vikings met. The pacifist religious reformation that occurred between totally changed their culture."

HistoryMemes,ffjay3u,t1_ffjakia,1579994489.0,"Impossible because of the rapids and waterfalls. It's somewhat likely they reached Île d'Orléans in Quebec, but no further. They record that going too far into the land was impossible because of the natives being so violent.

Incidentally, the natives also record that era as being one of exceptionally high violence before the local prophet Deganawida tackled the violence and brought a more peaceful culture to the Native people.

Bare in mind that the people of the lakes northward are known to have made swords too much like the vikings, but abandoned swordsmanship when Deganawida preached peace. The vikings were not going for a walk in the park. The natives would have been decked in full copper armor and swords. The vikings were at a disadvantage and acknowledged it, abandoning Vinland exploration.

There is, if we're talking about cinematography. It's the same problem of Jar Jar. He's just not relevant to the plot. There's a time and place for everything.

They were organized under the Indian Army. The British Imperial Army was rather segregated by origin (not by race). You're not going to find Sikhs among the English. Nor would you find Kiwis or Aussies or Canadians or anyone else fyi. You would find them in their own armies. The first Sikh house of worship wasn't even built in Britain until 1911.
