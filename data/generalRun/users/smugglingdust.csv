AmItheAsshole,fglax2d,t1_fgku75g,1580888714.0,"this might not be the case, but i want you to be aware of this if the info lines up. when i was 12 and first got my period, they weren't regular. i would get small bleeding for 2-3 days, and sometimes the time inbetween would be less than a month, sometimes more. it was just random. once i finally told my mom, she noticed it was wrong and took me to a gyno. they did an external ultrasound and found a cyst on my left ovary. i had to take contraception for months until it cleared up, and since then my periods have been regular as shit."

offmychest,fgcky62,t3_exs7t2,1580673613.0,you might like Philosophy Tube's video about sex work. i just watched it yesterday and its scary how rigged the system is against sex workers.
JustNoSO,fgc8t7w,t3_eximai,1580670268.0,"he is slowly manipulating you into apologising for things he did wrong. no, you don't need to remind a grown ass adult that you haven't changed your mind since the last time you talked. he's seriously pushing it and you're kind of letting him. I'm not blaming you, he sounds insufferable and like he would never listen to reason."

FragileMaleRedditor,fg9jras,t1_fg89op2,1580639684.0,and anyone disagreeing with you cant comment either (:
FragileMaleRedditor,fg9ipb5,t1_fg892ik,1580639230.0,"why can't they coexist? these issues arent black and white. there are cis women with the same issues that trans women have: not being able to have kids for whatever reason. femininity is so much more than reproductive issues and you shouldn't have to check every box to be able to benefit from a supportive community. I'm cis but i dont get affected by sexism the same way another woman might be. a woman could be a mother and not be a target for reproductive pressure, so does that mean she has no benefit from the rest of what a community offers? 

i really don't understand the complete lack of empathy terfs have towards trans women. they go through so much shit to be able to live as they want and the best they can get is being an ""unclockable"" woman which then means they get to experience the same oppression any other woman would. and that's the best case scenario. trans oppression is a whole new can of worms that terfs are lucky they don't experience."
relationships,fg6mpk6,t1_fg6iuhr,1580571967.0,sorry but the theory that self control is a finite resource has been debunked
FragileMaleRedditor,fg6ax1s,t1_fg68x0t,1580561946.0,"oh of course, me too."
FragileMaleRedditor,fg686r5,t1_fg6562l,1580558526.0,"[here you go, it's also in my comment history](https://imgur.com/a/6XkCxub)"
FragileMaleRedditor,fg64y8i,t1_fg5m54t,1580553857.0,"that is because they ban and mute anyone who even mentions trans people. they banned me for asking if it was a terf sub once i noticed they kept crossposting r/gendercritical. i messaged the mods asking if it was because of that, and also if it actually was a terf sub so i know if I shouldn't care. then they muted me. i have the receipts if you want them, i was nothing but polite. on a different subreddit someone linked fds and i commented on the terf thing. their response was ""yes, because trans women aren't women and this is a female space"". open your eyes, it's all there"
FragileMaleRedditor,fg64qu1,t1_fg5vrti,1580553548.0,"they banned and muted me for just asking if it was a terf sub lol. the idea behind it is good, encouraging women to know their worth and not settle for men who don't put in enough effort. but it just seems hateful to me"
JustNoSO,fg63h6e,t1_fg51kwp,1580551633.0,im sorry but the cat is protecting her boundaries where you are not. and people disrespecting and mistreating animals is a clear indication of who they are
JustNoSO,fg63eyb,t3_ewvref,1580551540.0,"of course he has a right to ask. and you have a right to say no. see, a person who respects you and is worth keeping in your life will then understand that you have said no and that that means you dont want to do whatever they asked for. that person who respects you and is worth keeping in your life will accept your wishes and not see them as something to be manipulated and changed to their advantage."
