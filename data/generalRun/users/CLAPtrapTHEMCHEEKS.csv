I donâ€™t need a smaller, bigger or different colored government , I need one thatâ€™s gonna make sure I donâ€™t have to call around for a decent quote on fixing a broken leg as every one of 4 major insurance providers scramble itâ€™s teams of lawyers to figure out how to avoid paying for peopleâ€™s treatment.

You understand that an insurance companyâ€™s best case scenario is not having to pay for your treatment right? And most of the time a hospitals best case scenario is you needing whatever treatment they can inflate the price of the most? Specifically to rip money from the hands of patients, insurance companies or sometimes both. This is the system you want to keep in place because....???

â€˜Iâ€™ve never had a major medical emergency and I never will, me and my family are actively invincibleâ€™

â€˜I donâ€™t like paying for other peopleâ€™s treatment even tho thatâ€™s literally how insurance is supposed to workâ€™

Literally ONE DUDE chose to bomb Soleimani, not Congress, not the American people they are trying to represent, not the people that will be shot at by Iranians, should such an encounter come to pass. And you know what the worst part is? My life goes on! Iâ€™m not at threat of being bombed or shot at, and as soon as the next thing to get views is picked up by the news stations then I stop hearing about it.
