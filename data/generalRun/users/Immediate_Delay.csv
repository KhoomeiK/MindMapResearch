Because, especially less mature males and females, can not be friends all the time without a feel of intimacy. Talking to someone of the opposite gender can open doors for lust especially when it's about opening-up. Not necessarily. Of course unless they are a close friend on yours of family member, you could trust."

Emotions are very weird, we don't understand them fully (istp) 

You will come out of this, it's a part of life. Do not worry, let these feelings come in and embrace it, love it and appreciate it, do not resist them. Lay down, and let these emotions flow in, capture each feeling one by one, write them down or think about them, and think lots, try to make sense of why you are having these exact feelings once you catch them floating in your mind.

For instants:
*closes eye and feelings come in*
*notices the first feeling was suicidal and hurts your throat*

Okay... why am I having this feeling?

*thinks more about the reason behind it.. hmm still vague idk* *writes it down*

Okay next...

*closes eyes and another feeling comes or another image or thought* 

-okay.. writes it down and thinks about it.. hmm still vague *allows this specific emotion to continue* hmm interesting altho im rlly depressed *okay this emotion doesnt make sense* idk

Continue flowing with these feelings. And keep in mind that these feelings are just feelings and are NOT TRUE OR FACT, this is why istps have difficulty understanding them and thus we tend to get depressed because they literally make no sense but these emotions are so intense that they seem real.

It is not. Just let them be

Goodluck

Tl;dr: dont resist emotions, let them flow"
istp,fet78kz,t1_fet6jq6,1579372432.0,"I see.

Find stuff to do apart from studying. Jogging, playing, dishes, walks, leisure reading. These things keeps your mind busy, by being present

The point of doing things other than sitting in your room letting your mind wonder, helps you keep your mind in the state of presence.

Sitting keeping your mind busy and just studying makes you depressed. 

Try shaking your toes for an instant presence feel. (Military tip)

Also practice mindful meditating.

You can do this. Go do some stuff."
istp,fet5jo1,t3_eqk4bw,1579372021.0,"Keep your mind busy, go jogging, do stuff.

And also talk to someone you can trust, preferably someone that is not the opposite gender.

istp,fe8ylf6,t1_fe8lwow,1578932392.0,"I very much care for people and friends. But I just help people then leave once my job is done, if they need more help I'm always there. Infact, I love helping people.

I deleted social media for myself; I'm focusing on doing things more and deleting social media has helped me read more too. I figured that if people want to stay in touch with me, they all have my number, and if they don't contact me, well..?  Hahah

How does showing care sounds like to you? Also, nobody really texts me on social media either.

However, the people who I try to connect with (supposedly my friends) happen to never reconcile at all. And I believe it's because they're mostly away from me studying in other countries. And it's hard for me because recently I've been meaning to stay close with them, and apparently I do not know how to (coming out clingy to some and some don't really reconcile).

Any thoughts on this?"
