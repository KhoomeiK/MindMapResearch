nvidia,fgtjx34,t1_fgtfwd1,1581105407.0,"Yup, that's one reason I also was thinking of going for one extra card than two and thought to myself if it makes sense to go with one 1080 Ti - great cost-wise but not future-proof.

Still, even though the case can support 9 fans, I don't think it will be a good idea to cram all these poor guys so closely.

I'm curious to know tho, aren't blower style cards rated at lower clock speed? Don't they have limited cooling capacity which can shorten the lifetime of the card under heavy workload like data mining and ML/DL?"
nvidia,fgtdz89,t1_fgt1hj0,1581103187.0,"Awesome! So, the score is: 2080 Ti 2 - 0 1080 Ti"
French,fgtcnkd,t1_fgst43p,1581102629.0,Awesome! How are you benefiting from it? Did you also buy the solutions book (corrigé)?
nvidia,fgt11px,t1_fgspw5p,1581096813.0,"Thanks a lot for the reply! You raise good points. I haven't double-checked whether the libraries are designed to automatically utilize multiple GPUs on their own (TF/keras). I'll have to look into it.

I hadn't thought of the waiting part either; I was focusing on the processing power and the GPU memory only. Will definitely not be efficient if the 2080 Ti is waiting for the 1080 Ti's to finish. Unless the parallelization can consider the difference in performance and accordingly divide tasks/batches and feed data to each card. Will have to look into this as well.

Mixed precision was not even a consideration for me before this LOL... Good bunch of stuff I gotta read up on apparently. How would the 2080 Ti introduce 2x~3x speed up compared to 2x 1080 Ti's tho? Can you elaborate on that please?

Thanks again"
