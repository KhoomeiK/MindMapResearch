rant,fft32rp,t3_euz198,1580204455.0,i always hated this argument that 'well they need to feed their families somehow' like have you ever heard of writers? 50% of them will never get paid for what they're doing and writing in itself is a very long and laborious process and then you have those app makers over here quickly put together some game and cash out because their audience is little kids who don't know anything about money management. like literally it annoys me how some people make such easy cash by doing nothing and then you have other people working their asses off for nothing

rant,ffr5zwv,t1_ffr5f1y,1580151203.0,honestly i think pedos and rapists should just immediately lose their rights and be killed instead of getting those lame sentences of 5 months or so. the victims have to life with trauma for the rest of their life's while those monsters get away with a slap on their wrist
