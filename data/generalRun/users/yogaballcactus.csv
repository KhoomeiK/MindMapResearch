urbanplanning,feuxbbp,t1_feutohl,1579390893.0,"You’re better off as a homeowner if the values stay exactly where they are. You don’t want appreciation because your next house is likely to appreciate more than your current house. You don’t want the value to go down because you owe money on it and don’t want to be upside down on the loan. People might have factored some appreciation into their purchase decision, but if they thought about it a little bit further they’d realize that they probably don’t want the housing market to appreciate generally because the price of their next house will increase more than the price of their current house. The only way most people really win on appreciation is if their house appreciates more than the market. And they don’t need a generally appreciating market to do that - all they need is to get lucky, remodel, or buy in an up and coming neighborhood. 

You are right that I ignored lifestyle impacts. My main point is that a primary residence is, generally speaking, an awful financial investment. If we can get people to see that they aren’t really benefiting from the housing market going up in value then that knocks down one of the pillars supporting the terrible housing markets we have today. The changes that increased density bring can be addressed separately."

urbanplanning,feu0rbr,t3_eq4nsc,1579382003.0,"A lot of the opposition to zoning reform is NIMBYs who want to protect their property values. But I honestly don't understand why we, as a society, are so obsessed with increasing property values. Most people plow whatever profits they make from one house right into the next house. Most people also buy progressively larger and more expensive houses throughout their lives. With those two things in mind, it's not hard to figure out that any profit you make on one house is going to be insufficient to cover the amount your next house increased in value while you owned your first house. 

Let's say you buy your first home in your 20's. You want a SFR, but they are going for $300k and your career hasn't really taken off yet, so you put 20% down on a $200k on a condo instead. You live in that condo for eight years, it appreciates at 3%/year and you sell it for $253,354, so you make a $53kish profit. Sounds like great news, right?

But now you want a SFR, and that SFR also appreciated at 3%/year, so now you have to pay $380,031 for it. You only made $53k on the appreciation of your house, but your next house is going to cost you $80k more. That's not a good deal! And it gets worse - the average American only keeps their first SFR 11-12 years, so you're going to be in the market for a nicer, larger, more expensive SFR in another decade or so and you're gonna get screwed again. Let's do the math:

So after 11 years in your first SFR, you want to buy your second SFR. It's nicer than your first SFR, so let's say it was worth $450k when you bought that condo nineteen years ago. Now you've been holding onto that first SFR for eleven years, and it has appreciated to $526,051 - a whopping $146k profit. Add that into the $53k profit you made on the condo and you've made $199k in the housing market over 19 years. But that second SFR, which was worth $450 when you bought the condo, has also been appreciating. It is now worth $789,077, so it costs you $339k more than it would have cost you 19 years ago, which is $140k more than you've made in the housing market in that time. This, again, is not a good deal! 

My assumptions when I did the math on this were:

* There is a condo worth $200k, a SFR worth $300k and a second SFR worth $450k in year zero

* Each home appreciates at 3%/year

* Your mortgage terms are always a fixed rate 30 year loan at 4.5%

* Transaction costs are ignored

* PMI is ignored

* The proceeds from one home, net of the mortgage payoff, are always reinvested into the next home

* You buy the condo at the beginning of year 0 and put 20% ($40k) down on the condo

* At the beginning of year 8, you sell the condo and buy the first SFR

* At the beginning of year 19, you sell the first SFR and buy the second SFR

* You keep the second SFR until it is paid off

If homes do not appreciate at all, you end up spending $842,823 over your lifetime in principal and interest payments. If they appreciate at 3%, you end up spending $1,104,604 in principal and interest over your lifetime. That is a whopping $261,781 difference. 

If you want to minimize the amount you spend on housing throughout your life, the best thing that could happen would be for housing to be inexpensive when you buy your first house and for the market not to go up at all during your lifetime."

This is different from gig economy jobs, where the workers are independent contractors instead of employees. Gig economy workers do not get any of the benefits or protections the law gives to employees because they are not, legally speaking, employees.

At the individual level, it’s not a huge risk to text and drive, speed, floor it on yellow or do any of the other dumb things people do behind the wheel. Most people will drive like morons for their entire lives and never experience a bad crash. They also will probably get ticketed at most once per decade. But when everyone drives like a moron their entire life, we end up with 40,000 traffic deaths every year. That’s equivalent to one 9/11 every month plus a bonus 9/11 each year. And that’s only deaths - it has to be tens or hundreds of thousands of serious injuries on top of the deaths. 

If you want to prevent crashes, you have to change the math at the individual level. Consistent enforcement would change that math. A habitual tailgater who got ticketed for tailgating just once a month would stop tailgating within a couple months. Someone who texts and drives all the time would put the phone down if they got a couple tickets. If we want to prevent crashes, we need to enforce the laws often enough that it makes sense to follow them."

urbanplanning,fee20ib,t1_fee0hbo,1579024745.0,"So you’re not against cameras, you’re against traffic enforcement in general? 

But every city does *some* traffic enforcement. Shouldn’t that traffic enforcement be done in the most efficient way possible? If you have ten man-hours/week available for traffic enforcement, wouldn’t it be better to use those ten man hours reviewing traffic camera video and writing hundreds of tickets instead of sitting on the side of the road waiting for speeders and writing maybe a twenty tickets? What’s the best bang for your buck? 

If you’re just driving around in your police cruiser or walking a beat to demonstrate a police presence, does it really take away from that police work to also pull someone over and write a ticket? I’m not suggesting a homicide detective cut short chasing a suspect to write a ticket, but if your regular beat cops are just driving around what would be the problem with having them ticket delinquent drivers as they come across them? 

I’m also really confused about why it matters that an officer sees the violation in person. Is it harder to tell if someone runs a red light from a video instead of in person? Shouldn’t it be easier and fairer to prove traffic violations with video rather than with a statement from a police officer? What is the advantage to witnessing the violation in person? 

Is it safer to pull someone over right after they break the law than a week later? If traffic stops are dangerous then wouldn’t cameras be a safer way to enforce traffic laws, since most citations wouldn’t require a traffic stop. For traffic camera tickets, cops could pass on pulling someone over if there isn’t a safe place to pull over and move their enforcement to lower speed areas with more space to pull over. With a violation witnessed in person, the cop has to pull the violator over where they are or they will miss the opportunity to write a ticket."

There are plenty of other reasons to use cameras. For example, traffic would move much more quickly through my city if we had a quick and efficient way to ticket people who block the box. Cameras could do that for us. Life would be better, especially for people in wheelchairs, if we had an efficient way to ticket people for blocking the crosswalk and wheelchair ramps. Cameras could do that for us. 

We have a driving culture of ignoring many of the rules. This culture is enabled by a lack of effective enforcement. Camera enforcement is a very efficient and very effective way to change that culture."
urbanplanning,feduekt,t1_fedr84v,1579020105.0,"The cops are already running plates for thousands of drivers. They have plate readers that can read every plate as they drive down the street. So there’s clearly no issue there. 

I don’t see any safety issue. You might have to elaborate on that. The whole point of cameras is to make the roads safer. 

I also don’t see the resource issue. I think you might be imagining a system where the cops are sent out to actively pursue drivers who have unpaid tickets. That could happen for someone with tons of unpaid tickets, but I suspect that would be a very rare occurrence. For the vast majority of unpaid tickets, I would expect the cops to catch them by driving around doing whatever police work they normally do, getting a notification from their automated license plate reader that someone nearby has an unpaid ticket and taking a quick break from what they are doing to pull the driver over and issue the ticket. There is no way that is not a better use of resources than the way traffic enforcement is done now."
urbanplanning,fedq526,t1_fedkyl7,1579017471.0,"Why wouldn’t we just have the cops pull over drivers who have ignored or not received their camera tickets? A lot of police forces already use automatic license plate readers. Just have the system flag any car associated with a driver who has unpaid tickets, pull them over and issue the tickets in person. 

Even if you don’t have automatic license plate readers, it would still be easy to catch most people who ignore the tickets. Most people drive the same route every day. So just wait until you’ve got a list of 10 or 15 people who’ve ignored tickets from the same camera and then send one cop out there to watch the intersection, pull them over when they drive through it and issue all the tickets in person. That would be pretty easy, pretty simple and a whole lot more efficient than having your cops sitting there taking radar readings hoping someone is dumb enough to break the law right in front of them."

philadelphia,fdj7fil,t1_fdiwihx,1578460578.0,"I don’t think we need to develop any algorithms. We already have cameras that automatically ticket red light runners and speeders. For other offenses all we have to do is hire a few people to watch the cameras. No algorithms necessary. 

The PPA is able to write tickets without causing traffic because the cars are already parked. I don’t see much potential for reducing traffic by studying the way the PPA tickets people. And you also need to get to a point where you ticket the vast majority of offenders instead of a small minority. You have to write enough tickets to make breaking the law a losing gamble. I just don’t see cops in cars or on foot writing one ticket at a time getting to the kind of volume we need to really change behavior. 

Cameras are a hard sell because people don’t want to be held responsible for their shitty driving. Anything that’s effective will be a hard sell. 

And I am definitely not in favor of vigilante justice, no matter how much the drivers deserve it. It doesn’t actually work as a deterrent. If somebody throws an egg at you once then you assume that person is an asshole. But if you get a ticket every single time you block the box then you’ll pretty quickly stop blocking the box.

philadelphia,fdihfnv,t1_fdiew3q,1578442990.0,"We should probably already be doing this. 

I also think we could crowdsource enforcement pretty easily. Just create a website where you can submit a complaint about a bad driver and ask the cops to review the video. You just identify the intersection, exact time of day, and make/model/color or the car that was breaking the law and the cops look at the video and send them a ticket. Once people realize that they can’t get away with ignoring traffic laws anymore we could probably reassign most of the cops who watch the cameras to more productive things and just rely on complaints from the public to identify bad drivers."
philadelphia,fdigmnc,t1_fdiajtd,1578442462.0,"Cameras have a lot of advantages. 

You can automate some of the enforcement. Red light cameras can flag every driver who runs the red light for review. The cops can spend their time reviewing flagged footage and writing tickets instead of sitting in their cars waiting for someone to break the law. Same thing with speeding. 

You can catch a lot more people with the same number of cops. If you have a cop sitting in his car watching traffic and he sees four people blocking the box, he’s probably only going to be able to catch one of them. Then he spends ten or fifteen minutes chasing that one guy down, checking his insurance, registration, etc, handing him the ticket and driving back to position to watch the intersection afterwards. In the mean time, four more cars blocked the box every time the light changed. If that same cop is watching a camera then he can write a ticket for every single car that blocks the box. This is incredibly important - as long as only a small fraction of people get caught, getting a ticket isn’t a big enough risk to deter people from breaking the law. Cameras let you catch the majority of the people. 

A cop who tickets someone for stopping in the travel lane has to pull them over. Where are they going to pull over to? Probably into a bike lane, in front of a driveway, or they are just going to stay put in the travel lane until they are done being ticketed. This means that enforcement done in person can actually cause more traffic. Cameras don’t have this issue. The only way I can think of to ticket people for stopping in the travel lane without gridlocking center city is to mail out the tickets instead of stopping the driver right then and there and holding up traffic. 

Cameras could enforce all of the things you would want them to enforce. Ubers idling in the travel lane could be ticketed by a police officer watching a camera. The PPA could ticket drivers parking in the bike lanes with cameras. Drivers driving in the bike lanes could be ticketed via camera. All you really need for most traffic enforcement is for a cop to see someone breaking the law. Why wouldn’t you be able to use cameras to do that instead of trying to put a cop on every corner? 

I’m not really sure why you’d be against using cameras if your goal was to increase enforcement. I’m also not sure why you’d think that cameras aren’t “actual enforcement.” But I’m definitely open to other suggestions. If you’ve got an idea that would be as effective as camera enforcement then I’d love to hear it."
philadelphia,fdi9wyz,t1_fdi5u07,1578438375.0,"Traffic enforcement is so important.

Nothing we do to encourage cycling will matter as long as we have drivers who pass within a foot of cyclists and turn across the bike lane without looking. Nothing we do to make walking better will matter as long as we continue to allow drivers to ignore crosswalks. 

We could solve a huge number of our traffic problems by installing a few cameras at intersections and mailing out tickets.

worldnews,fd37asi,t1_fd2adzl,1578155384.0,"Part of the problem here is what the tax code defines as income. If you make $600 in interest and your investments increase in value by $1,000 then you are $1,600 richer, but you only have $600 in taxable income because the tax code does not recognize unrealized gains as income. 

Let’s look at a more realistic example. Let’s say you’re a trust fund kid. Your investments go up in value by $1,000,000 this year. You only spend $600,000 and you leave the rest in the market. You are going to have, at most, $600,000 of taxable income. And most of it will be taxed at a maximum rate of 23.8%. Compare that to a doctor who makes $1,000,000 through his medical practice and spends the same $600,000. He has taxable income of $1,000,000, and it will be taxed at a maximum rate of 37%. So the guy who sits on his ass all day and contributes nothing to society gets to hide a huge amount of his income from the IRS and also gets to pay a lower rate on the income he has to tell the IRS about. The guy who goes out there every day and cures the sick pays tax on all of his income and pays that tax at a higher rate. 

For the ultra rich, the numbers really get skewed. Some of these people spend very little of their income. And that allows them to leave it in the market as unrealized gains that don’t get taxed.

todayilearned,fcy3gay,t1_fcxyii9,1578074258.0,"I think that’s a really good argument if you have a car that is paid off, never breaks down and will never need to be replaced. But at some point your car will break down and you’ll need another one. Will it still make sense to buy and have a car payment, or will it make more sense to use a car share? Especially if the elimination of human drivers significantly reduces the cost? Let’s say it costs Uber 57.5 cents/mile (the rate the IRS uses to estimate vehicle cost/mile) and they throw in a 10% profit margin. That makes your commute cost $8.86/day, or $195/month (assuming 22 working days in a month). Add in another hundred dollars for weekend trips and you’re still spending a lot less than you’d spend on a car payment plus insurance plus maintenance plus gasoline. And I bet Uber gets the cost/mile down below 57.5 cents, because they will be buying efficient cars and running them 24/7, so the variable costs will be lower and the fixed costs will be split between many people. Car sharing has the potential to be as cheap as buying a used car and driving it until the wheels fall off. 

I’m not saying it will definitely work for you. Honestly, I don’t expect many people who live the typical suburban lifestyle where driving is mandatory to go everywhere are going to switch to car sharing. But I could see a lot of people who live near a train line go from owning a car for each adult to sharing one car between them all and using a car share to fill in the gaps. And I could see more people in urban areas ditching their cars as car sharing becomes cheaper for their occasional trips out of the city. And I could see people living car-less or car-light lifestyles for parts of their lives and owning their own cars for other parts of their lives. And I think that as America becomes more urban and more people live in areas with public transit and with stores close enough to walk to more and more people will find that they are able to cut back or get rid of car ownership all together. 

I don’t think private car ownership will be eliminated in the future.

There will still be families with children who would rather own their own cars. Some people will simply prefer to own and drive themselves. 

But driverless cars will make it easier for some people to live car-free or car-lite lifestyles. For example, dual income households where one earner takes the train to work could switch from two cars to one fairly painlessly. City dwellers already don’t need cars in their daily lives, and the decrease in costs associated with driverless cars will make carsharing instead of owning more attractive to them. Young people already want to live in walkable neighborhoods where parking tends to be difficult and expensive and rents tend to be high, and the cost savings from ditching their cars can help them afford that lifestyle. We might go from a model where everyone owns a car their entire lives to a model where some people don’t buy their first cars until they move to the suburbs in their late twenties or early thirties. Or a model where empty nesters sell one car when the kids go off to college. As America becomes more urbanized, these trends will accelerate. 

So I guess what I’m saying is that this won’t be an all or nothing thing. Anyone who says it will be hasn’t really thought it through or is just stuck in their own bubble and can’t imagine that other people live different lifestyles."

And honestly, two decades of driving your kids to lacrosse practice is probably an outlier, even before driverless cars come around. By the time I was in middle school the school was bussing us to games and that  continued through high school. 

Once we have driverless cars, a lot of people will be able to put their twelve or thirteen year old in the car alone and send them to practice. And even when the kids are young, the parents will be able to call a driverless car and bring them and their kids to practice together. The only difference will be that they’ll have to cart their gear to and from the car every time instead of just leaving it in the trunk. 

Even people who have to or choose to drive their kids to practice several times a week might still be able to go from owning multiple cars to owning one car. The cost savings for the people who can make that work can be significant. 

This is not necessarily about eliminating private car ownership for everyone for their entire lives and just because you think it won’t work for you doesn’t mean it won’t work for someone else. This is about giving people the option to get around without a car for some significant portion of their lives."
todayilearned,fcxn4a6,t1_fcxgsfs,1578066893.0,"There are a LOT of people out there who don’t have to drive five kids to soccer practice several times a week. Even for the ones who do, that typically only lasts for a few years. If we go from needing cars for our entire lives to needing cars for a decade or two while our kids are young then that still gives us the option not to own a car for most of our lives. 

And going car-less or car-lite is just an option. Nobody is going to take away your minivan. If you want to keep it you can. But people who don’t want a car won’t *need* to have one. And I think that once people start doing the math on the cost of car ownership they are going to decide that they’d rather have several nice vacations every year or a nicer house or a bunch of new tech gadgets or a better wardrobe or any number of other things instead of a car."

I’m sure a lot of families are going to end up only needing one car instead of two. Or they might end up just needing cars while their kids are young and then getting rid of them when the kids go to college. 

I’m also sure there will always be people who want to live the traditional suburban or rural lifestyle where every adult owns a car. And that’s perfectly fine. No one is going to take that away from you. You are just going to have the option not to live that lifestyle if you don’t want to."
todayilearned,fcxl8pu,t1_fcxeuot,1578065651.0,Car sharing actually exists now and trash is not a problem. If you get in a car that’s dirty you just take a picture and whoever made the mess gets charged to clean it up.
todayilearned,fcxkbdw,t1_fcxha3r,1578065022.0,"I think a lot of people reflexively have the same reaction you are expressing here. But the truth is that car ownership is very expensive in relation to the median income in most countries and a lot of people are going to end up doing the math and giving car-less or car-light living a chance. That doesn’t mean that you will make that choice, but as cars become less of a necessity and more of a luxury there will be more people who choose not to own them."

Even when it’s in a country most of us don’t live in and don’t understand the laws and norms of. Hell, if the truck driver was found 100% at fault and convicted in court, it would still be the cyclist’s fault here on reddit."
