TooAfraidToAsk,ffinbi5,t1_ffhvgik,1579977991.0,"Just beacuze 90% of people have health insurance doesn’t mean that they won’t go bankrupt due to an medical emergency, many programs does not cover every emergency you can encounter. Also I agree government funded healthcare isn’t free, but it is about [half as expensive](https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2019/07/how-does-the-us-healthcare-system-compare-to-other-countries) as the US system is. A system that’s btw you only share with countries like India, Congo, Egypt, etc. 

Also even though American healthcare is the most expensive system compared to other OECD countries it is not even the best despite the large price tag , if you scroll down the link you can see how it compares to the other countries."

Destiny,ffg6tl7,t3_et996e,1579899701.0,"I don’t think this data should be taken at a 100% face value. Since they are comparing federal to individual states minimum wages and from there deriving what a difference in minimum wages does for suicides. 

But how do we know these states are not just better off and have more recourses to pay more in minimum wage but also infrastructure and all kind of other stuff that makes life better for the individual and therefore decreases suicide rate. 

If you know something I don’t please let me know. I don’t have full access to the paper so maybe they have a way around this problem."

But there are plenty jobs where you don’t have to socialize in undesirable amounts.

Animals are really sturdy, and will do anything they can to survive. Also from the footage of this video it doesn’t look like the shrews even realize there is a person near them as another comment points out they are nearly blind. If they did realize there was a person  they would have ran away fast. Why wouldn’t they just run away if they were in fact terrified? This just seems unnecessarily empathic for something that is not even in pain. Focus your energy on something more meaningful friend."

Denmark,fenc8ma,t1_fenb7q2,1579281585.0,"Jeg ved ikke hvorfor det er så svært at forstå. Det eneste jeg siger er at begge parter der er en del af konflikten skal udspørges, det er det hele OP’s opslag forsøger at påpege nemlig at der er draget konklusioner ud fra uddrag fra kun de indsatte. Selvfølgelig har staten et ansvar for hvad der sker på stedet. Kan du ikke se at i dit eksempel skal man have udtagelser fra både dig selv og fængselsbetjent om hvad der er sket på stedet for at komme tættere på virkeligheden. Jeg syntes jeg har sagt min pointe mange gange nu hvis du ikke kan se hvad jeg mener for jeg dig nok ikke til det ved at sige det 5 gange til."
Denmark,fenaczv,t1_fen9jtm,1579280421.0,"Nu sagde jeg så “uafhængig tredjepart” i henhold til den konkrete konflikt vi er helt enige om at staten er ejer af Ellebæk men det betyder ikke at de ved en skid om hvad der foregår på stedet. Det gør personalet på stedet, derfor skal de spørges for at få en fuldere billede af situationen. Det svarer til at to kollegaer kommer op og slås i din lokale netto, herefter bliver den ene part udspurgt, samt topchefen for netto. Topchefen ved jo heller ikke præcis hvad der foregår i hver eneste netto butik han er chef for. Derfor er det de to parter der har været involveret i konflikten der skal udspørges."

Det skal desuden også siges at personligt syntes jeg ikke umiddelbart at forholdene er i orden ud fra de udsagn man har fået fra de indsatte, men det ændre ikke på princippet at begge sider altid skal høres i en sag."

The reason that left wing politics are more prevelant on the internet is probably just that this is the preferred medium of left wingers. At least more so than right leaning people."

Denmark,fe7crt2,t1_fe6uels,1578912877.0,Med den befolkningstilvækst der er i Danmark er det umiddelbart ikke nogen god ide at ikke få børn begrund af bekymringer om bæredygtighed. Befolkningsvæksten er nemlig så lav at den har været tæt på negativ i Danmark og en stor del af den tilvækst vi ser i dag skyldes indvandring. Problemet er jo så at hvis befolkningsvæksten en dag bliver for lav at vi vil få en betydeligt større ældre byrde og det er klart at det kan skabe problemer i samfundet.

philosophy,fdxdqz3,t3_en8bq4,1578767719.0,"This is only a problem under a non rehabilitating prison system. If the prisons actually did it’s job and helped people get on the right path, it would mean that even though there would initially be disproportionate policing in an area at first the community would have fewer criminals after a while because some would have been reformed, and therefore the AI would delegate less police force to that area. 

This problem of disproportionate policing only exist under a non rehabilitating prison system. 

I do however agree that given that prisons are currently largely unable to rehabilitate prisoners, this bias is hard to get around. But there could be workarounds. Maybe if the AI had to take into account observed crimes per police action (this can of course be hard to quantify) the AI would notice this bias and respond appropriately."
