The doctor is really kind and understanding, she’s already done a good job of asking about my mental health while also not dismissing my symptoms. She isn’t sure what’s going on so she really stressed I wear the monitor, I’m worried if I don’t then she won’t be able to make a diagnosis :/ I can try taping them down I suppose but I think it’s the adhesive on me that’s really bothering me."
POTS,fgu26yj,t1_fgtvi2q,1581112403.0,Thanks!
POTS,fgu26dz,t1_fgtx39m,1581112395.0,Thanks so much! That’s a good idea!
CPTSD,fglbnts,t3_eyk6n3,1580889671.0,"Evanescence. So much Evanescence haha. Lots of punk rock, alternative rock, and general emo music. I was a HotTopic kind of teen."
CPTSD,fgl97d3,t3_eyu8pt,1580886603.0,"I’m sorry you struggle with this, I do this really badly as well. My lips and cheeks are so scarred from a decade of biting on them obsessively."
CPTSD,fgl8wwt,t3_ez52bp,1580886271.0,"Don’t be so hard on yourself, it was a simple mistake. You were under a lot of pressure, it’s understandable that you forgot in the moment."
CPTSD,fgi1nck,t1_fgi0wxy,1580801463.0,"You’re absolutely right. Being a good parent to myself is hard sometimes, I think I can be quite distant from myself as strange as that sounds."
CPTSD,fgi0hzi,t1_fghyzp1,1580800100.0,"Thank you, sending the same to you <3 It feels good to know my words mean something after struggling with writing for so long."
CPTSD,fgi0f47,t1_fghzvp3,1580800010.0,"I very much felt like a sad kid today, and I found that I tried to cheer myself up the same way I did when I was a kid: lots of sugar and angsty music. I guess this whole time I’ve just been a kid pretending to be an adult lol"
CPTSD,fghwbki,t1_fggk3rm,1580795854.0,"I can understand that, I think that’s how I was in high school. Before I knew that anxiety existed I just coped with it because I thought what I was feeling was normal and I was scared to talk about it in case people thought I was “weird.” And now that me and my friends talk about it all the time, I feel like I can’t go back to those coping mechanisms of repressing it and fighting through it. As soon as I recognized my anxiety for what it was, I haven’t been able to go back to functioning well with it. :/"
CPTSD,fghw5qg,t3_eylf0z,1580795703.0,now i have to wait until next week to tell my therapist that I have decided to see what’s literally right in front of my face lol. but i’m excited to have my biggest breakthrough right before starting EMDR!
CPTSD,fghbh43,t3_ey3ztu,1580781107.0,"Yes, I wake up in the middle of a panic attack at least once a night and it takes me a bit to calm down. Heart racing, sweating, shaking, hyperventilating, sometimes crying. I never know why as I forget most of my dreams/nightmares. I’m seeing a cardiologist just in case it’s a heart problem, but I suspect it’s anxiety. I’ve always had an issue with falling asleep and staying asleep—I tend to sleep in short periods of time."

cptsdcreatives,fgequwh,t3_exwoas,1580706893.0,I feel this picture so much. Thank you for sharing.
CPTSD,fgcwqd2,t1_fgckhk4,1580676939.0,"Ambulance & fire no, police yes. I’ve been in a few car accidents, one my fault and one not. Both were scary and sudden, but the police weren’t antagonistic or anything when they arrived. I can relate to the fear of being imprisoned, I don’t like being trapped physically or mentally. I always choose options with an easy escape or way out, like temporary jobs.

edit: I should add that I have a fear of authority in general, so I think this could also be a cause."
CPTSD,fgcjyj6,t1_fgcgze3,1580673314.0,"that makes sense, i can relate to that as well"
cats,ffw3fsr,t3_evjmbw,1580282642.0,where can one acquire a cat tank
CPTSD,ffvpuir,t1_ffvosne,1580269962.0,"Oh, that makes sense. Thank you"
