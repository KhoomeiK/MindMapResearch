More recent I've been spending more and more time having to do C# programming and after really getting used to it, I start to see the benefits of type checking (and the other things a language like C# provides).

This is pretty complex for a beginner project. A few things:

* Streaming video at a decent quality and latency, possibly around the world, isn't trivial.

* Where are you going to store the saved videos? Ideally, you'd make them deliverable through a content delivery network (such as Cloudflare or AWS Cloudfront), but those services cost money to both store and serve content. Depending on how much you store and serve, that could get expensive.

* You'll need some sort of system for accounts and management. You could try create something local to your site or just require some third-party login like Google, Facebook, etc. The latter would be easier since you wouldn't have to manage passwords and what-not.

 * You'll also want different levels of accounts. At the very least you'll want your ""host"" account to have much different privileges that the viewers' accounts.

* You'll need to use a database. This just adds further complexity, but you're going to need one.

* Payments. You *really* don't want to try and do this one yourself. You'd use something like Stripe, Amazon Pay, Google Pay, etc. to handle the actual payment details.

* Even if could code all this no problem, the cost of hosting and delivering everything is going to make an impact on your bank account. Unless you're an already established streamer elsewhere, you shouldn't rely on subscriptions/sales to pay for that cost for a good while."

* Privacy: Knowledge is power, right? Do you fully trust Google with the massive amount of data they have on you? The common argument here is that ""I have nothing to hide"". But it's not about hiding something. And, really, it should be ""I have nothing to hide right now""; You don't know what Google might decide to do in the future with your data, nor do you know if that data might contain something that becomes illegal (or harmful) in the future. For example: There's countries where things like homosexuality is made illegal and then what happens to people who have that kind of information in private companies (that could be subject to government requests/demands for data)."
