Messing with livestock is a big thing in some places.  

In terms of dog behaviour and training going forward: your dog has lost all off-leash privileges. You need to work on impulse control exercises and reinforce your recall training.

Most goldens are happy with one walk a day - as long as it is a decent walk and there is other stuff that is done with them.  If the plan is to only do one walk a day then... in my mind that isn't enough to provide a healthy life for a dog.

dogs,fffyv4j,t3_etf1wb,1579894801.0,"The culture of dogs being off-leash varies from country to country.  In some countries it even varies from region to region.

Where I live it (in Canada) is expected that dogs are on-leash in city limits.  Outside of the cities it is totally normal to see dogs off-leash.  Within the cities the vast majority of parks and green space are designated as ""on-leash"" although within that local parks might have an unofficial off-leash nod and a wink going on.  I know some neighbourhoods where all the dogs are off-leash and everyone is okay with that.

For the most part there isn't a lot of training that happens regarding teaching dogs to ignore other dogs.  This leads to all kinds of issues and it becomes exasperated by people who allow their dogs to be off-leash when the underlying rule is no off-leash dogs."

puppy101,fff5z8u,t3_et9dpf,1579876571.0,"One thing that may convince your mom is if you convince her to first get a robot vacuum.  I have two (one for the upstairs and one for the main floor) and the main floor one runs daily.  People who visit don't realize that I have a dog until he makes himself known.  My very clean-oriented sister-in-law visited during Christmas and she was impressed by the lack of hair.

I don't know if you can do something like babysitting or chores or something to be able to help buy the robot vacuum - I figure it should be within the realm of possibility since you're potentially looking at a samoyed.  

The other thing I'd do is try to get your mom involved in looking for a puppy.  Show her pictures of samoyed puppies, get her opinion on if she likes what she sees, if you're looking at breeders already get her input on those.  As much as you say you'll take care of the pup (and I believe that you will) it will be in the back of her mind that she will be caring for any dog you may get.  Therefore, get her involved and get her excited.  Make it a combined project.

If you cannot convince her on the robot vacuum idea then up your own chores - start cleaning (vacuuming) every other day.  Make it a habit.  With a samoyed that's something that you will be wanting to do.  Their hair is very noticeable.  :)"

In short:

>Genetic disorders differed in expression. No differences in expression of 13 genetic disorders were detected between purebred dogs and mixed-breed dogs (ie, hip dysplasia, hypo- and hyperadrenocorticism, cancers, lens luxation, and patellar luxation). Purebred dogs were more likely to have 10 genetic disorders, including dilated cardiomyopathy, elbow dysplasia, cataracts, and hypothyroidism. Mixed-breed dogs had a greater probability of ruptured cranial cruciate ligament.

What I found fascinating about the study is that it is typically a minority of pure breds that strongly impact the results for each genetic disorder.  If you remove the ""top five"" pure breeds of each genetic disease the numbers get very close to one another to the point of almost being at parity.  

I will point out that many breed clubs are working on removing genetic diseases from the breed.  I know more than a few breeders who are going out of their way to do things like bring over frozen semen from dogs across the ocean to add more genetic diversity to the breed.  Some breeds are going as far as outcrossing to remove genetic diseases.  You cannot do this with mixed breeds.

Are there some breeds that are what I would consider messed up?  There sure are and it bothers me that they've reached that point but that doesn't mean that ALL breeds are the same way.

One thing that stands out to me from the study is the CCL thing.  That highlights that many mixed breeds are physically limited - the body structure of the mix is not a happy body that has nice movement.  That's a really sad state of affairs unto itself.

So why are pure bred dogs useful?  Because you can predict the outcome.  You can even work to remove genetic diseases.  You know what you're going to get within a given band.  When you know what you're going to get then you have a better opportunity to prepare.

Plus, if you're looking to do something specific like hunting, herding, having a service dog, etc then you can select for the traits you're wanting.

From a pet perspective you also know what you're going to get from a pure bred.  You can make an informed decision on what kind of dog will meet your lifestyle and, as such, you have less of a chance of abandoning the dog so that it does end up in a shelter.  On top of that there are breed specific rescues that will take in pure bred dogs to keep them out of shelters."

As far as I can tell the 5 minutes / month thing came from Puppy Culture as a way to provide new puppy owners a baseline to operate from .  Puppy Culture makes it clear-ish that the 5 minutes really means 5 minutes AT A TIME and is for forced / structured activities only (such as being on-leash or playing fetch.)

Free roaming play with no leash on a soft ground (like grass or dirt) in a puppy-safe environment is pretty much agreed to be the best thing for a puppy to do."
puppy101,ffcinfc,t1_ffcfvv2,1579800275.0,"That's totally normal!  As distractions increase the ability to focus is reduced because there are so many new things.

If you haven't been told about the three Ds of training here's the rundown.  To simplify everything there are three primary things we're looking for when training:  duration, distance, and distraction.  We want a dog to be able to do a behaviour for a long time, from a good distance from us, and in a crazy environment!

To get there we need to work on each of the three elements individually.  As we increase one we need to reduce the other two to make the goal achievable without frustration.  So, if we want to increase distraction (such as training in a new location) then we're going to be asking for the behaviour right next to us and for a really short time before rewarding.

If we want to increase the duration (as an example for stay) then we want to work on that with as little distraction and distance as possible to start - so we'd work on it in a familiar location (such as at home) and from right next to us.

With distraction as we work on a behaviour in new locations then each subsequent new location becomes easier to work in.  What I usually suggest is to work on a behaviour at home.  From home you graduate to the back yard.  From the back yard you go to the front yard.  From the front yard you go down the street at bit to a safe spot.  From that safe spot you go to a park.  From that park you go to a parking lot.  Etc..  You keep working on the behaviour in new places with increasing amounts of distraction.

Puppy class is great because the distraction level is often sky high.  Puppy class sucks because the distraction level is often sky high.  :)

If we remember that puppy class is a really challenging place to work on behaviours then I find that we tend to be more forgiving and that makes training a bit easier.  

All of that to say:  you had issues with down because the distraction level was way higher than at home and that's totally normal."

I know I thought that with my guy when he was in puppy class.  When I got to talking with some of the other puppy owners I quickly discovered that everyone was thinking the same thing.

As for being put to shame - well, maybe with one type of behaviour but I bet you anything your pup will rock a different behaviour and that labradoodle will be way behind. 

Each puppy is different and will excel at different things.  That's totally normal.  Beyond that every human is different and every human will be better at teaching certain things over others.  That's also normal.  Eventually your puppy and you will figure it all out and you will know what works for the two of you."

How far, in terms of distance, do you think you'll be going?

Is your dog used to going similar distances?  If not, what's the normal distance your dog goes on average in a day?  If this is more than two times that distance I'd suggest not going the full distance - just take more time for stops and the like.

Dogs are like humans - they need to build up strength and endurance to go significant distances.  If your pup is like a normal dog they will do their best to keep up with you even as they fatigue and become exhausted.  They might even look like they have lots of energy but beneath that exterior are fatigued muscles that are struggling.  All of this means that the body is exposed to risk of injury - something you'd probably want to avoid.

If the distance planned is something that your pup does regularly or comes close to then no worries."

One thing that I always advise to do is to meet the breeder before getting a puppy from them and finding out if you actually LIKE them.  Your relationship with the breeder is a big part of getting a puppy from one.  Breeders have a wealth of information and experience regarding the breed and a good relationship means that contacting the breeder is often the first move when an issue comes up with your puppy.

To me it sounds like you found a breeder that you don't mesh with in terms of personality.  The breeder was doing what they felt was best and they didn't communicate well with you regarding it.

Each time it was due to the boot getting caught in some brush (like a juniper bush) under the snow.  Happily, each time I was able to send him back out to find it and he did.

One thing that we did do is when the snow got deep I didn't go out for extended trips at first.  I allowed him to build up some muscles for what amounts to him jumping through the snow.

Pathfinder_RPG,ff7pfks,t3_es2yig,1579655142.0,"When I played my psychic I found mindthrust to be super potent at level 1.  There are some simple things you can do to increase the caster level on a divination spell such as picking the Harrow Chosen trait (human trait.)  This gives you a +2 caster level to divination spells while holding a harrow deck.  

Therefore, just by using that, at level one your mind thrust is 3d6 damage.  

You can also use dew of lunary which is a consumable and gives one level to divination spells.  5 doses for 20gp.

This means you can have a level one spell (assuming your GM allows the caster levels to stack) that does 4d6 damage.

My psychic tried to use every psychic spell to retain the flavour of being a psychic.  Burst of Insight was useful. Deja-Vu totally messed an early boss encounter.  They were a shape shifter so they shifted shape and the next turn had to shape shift again.  That was amusing.

Depending on how much social stuff your campaigns go through you may find telempathic projection to be really valuable.

On top of that, psychics can make use Conceal Spell (which needs Deceitful) in a meaningful manner because of how psychic casting works.  Being able to actually fully conceal your casting (assuming you focus bluff or disguise) opens up a lot of interesting doors during interactions.

What's fun with Mind Thrust is that you can drop the spell from your level 1 spell list and take Mind Thrust II and replace it with another level 1 spell.  It's a nice progression.  There are a few core psychic spells like that and at the higher levels they become super useful."

puppy101,ff33wpm,t3_eragn7,1579533034.0,"Have you, as an adult, ever raced a child who is below the age of 10? 

It's the same thing with dogs.  Puppies do not have the muscle mass or endurance to keep up with an adult dog.  Puppies should be fading off and stopping to take a breather.  That's a normal and necessary thing since endurance takes a long time before it develops.  

Keep an eye on him.  If he's particularly driven he might not be stopping when he should.  By this I mean that he could be running beyond his own limits and ignoring any struggle just to keep up.  You know your puppy better than anyone so it'll be up to your judgement if that is happening or not.

If you see him falling behind and struggling I would suggest calling him off and letting him have a breather.  He's young.  Very young and in an awkward growth phase.  Over working can cause injury.

Think of it like this (this is very simplified and not fully accurate but it gets the idea across):  A body's skeleton is supported by soft tissue (ligaments, tendons) which, in turn, are supported by muscles.  As long as the muscles are working properly they fully support the body and absorb most the impacts / activity.  However, as muscles fade out from overwork that leaves the soft tissue more exposed to the activity.  When this happens the soft tissue gets the majority of the impacts which can cause damage.  A lot of this damage will never be seen since it comes in the form of micro tears however if a bunch of those tears are in the same area that can prevent the soft tissue from functioning properly.  This shows up later on in life as stiffness in movement.  

So when a young dog goes for too long and pushes beyond their normal limit by ignoring their body warnings (which can happen quite easily with driven dogs) then they expose themselves to risk.  Does this mean that they WILL injure themselves?  No, but the risk is there.  If they keep going then, eventually, the law of big numbers will come into play and they will have an injury of some kind.

One way dogs (and other animals) counter this is by changing up their gaits when running.  This is usually more apparent with puppies since they don't have the endurance to maintain steady work for long periods of time.  A puppy will gallop, then shift to a canter, then shift to a trot, and back again as the muscle groups for each gait fatigue and regain energy.  Between the gaits there are shared muscles so that restricts the overall time that they can go all out in total.

Even within a gait you should be seeing lead changes and body shifts as the body tries to balance out where the energy is being spent.

This is also why forced activity (on-leash walking, jogging, playing fetch, etc) can be detrimental - the pup (or dog) doesn't have the opportunity to shift gaits.  With fetch it's really easy to overexert and if you think about the twists that dogs will do when chasing something down well it's easy to see how the risk of injury increase.  However, this also means that a dog CAN get injured simply by even walking too much.  When the muscles are fatigued the soft tissues are at risk.

The flip side of this is that exercise and activity are super beneficial to young dogs.  The thing is they need to be able to stop on their own volition without external influences.  Self-directed play with stops, breathers, changes in gaits, and that stops before fatigue is wonderful.  This typically means off-leash and free moving playtime.  

However, if you have a pup who is driven and keeps trying to keep up even after their muscles are fatigued then you have a puppy who is increasing the risk of injury.  That's where you need to step in and enforce recovery time."

Personally, I put down interlocking ""foam"" exercise mats  across most of my ground floor over the hardwood. It cost around $250 to do and it was so worth it. Having them allows me to work at speed with my dog - to have jumps out for him to practice with. I can set up weave poles in the hallway.  We can work on retrieving. Etc.

However, at the end of the day - this is NOT a scientific paper.  It has no data.  It makes no hypothesis.  It was not peer reviewed.  It was not published in any scientific publication.

I would love to see Champion produce their OWN studies based on testable, verifiable, and repeatable methodology that are peer reviewed.  Until then, the point remains:  they do not publish actual studies.  A white paper doesn't alter that fact but, really, just highlights it.

Then I would find the first viable opening to leave. 

Since it is family it will be harder for you. Remind yourself that they are coming from a position of their own experience. Aversive techniques do work and can be effective for some things the problem is that they often create unintended consequences that aren't good. You may see a ""well behaved"" dog who is almost constantly living in fear. It's a sad sight. 

There are a ton of other bad unintended consequences that can happen from aversive methods - and there is always a positive reinforcement method that would achieve the same thing without those potential consequences. Sometimes the reinforcement method takes longer but it keeps a dog staying safe, happy, and trusting. 

In the future I would avoid playdates with their dog until you are 100% certain of your puppy's behaviour. That way they won't ever have to suggest punishments and you can begin the process of changing their dog-view without ever arguing the point. 

Your pup's behaviour be enough. 

As for the slappy friend - I wouldn't ever bring my pup near them again. I would probably take a moment to educate and if they were unwilling to learn I would drop them as a friend. I know that's harsh but someone who slaps a pup hard enough for you to wonder if it hurt is someone I don't want to be around. However if it was done in ignorance and they were willing to adjust and learn - I would work with them. 

All in all it sounds like you are on a great path - keep going with it.

My reading of variant channeling would not allow a cleric of Calistria to use the luck variant in the first place since Luck is a domain of Calistria and nor part of her portfolio as it pertains to variant channeling. :)

Assuming that luck variance was permitted - then a strong argument could be made for the archetype to allow it as part of Channel Entropy (Su) - as long as the restrictions of variant channeling were still followed (half damage plus the variance as long as the DC was passed.)  Since the wording of Channel Entropy states, 

>""This functions in all other ways as a cleric’s channel energy class feature, including benefiting from feats that affect channel energy (such as Selective Channeling).""

Luck is a permissible domain for channeller of the unknown as per, ""grants her the benefits of one domain from the following list: Darkness, Destruction, Luck, Madness, or Void.""  Of note - variant channeling is based on portfolio and not domain so it doesn't really matter. 

I think in terms of RAW the variant channeling would no longer work since it is directly tied to the worship of a deity. 

Variant channeling reads:

>However, given the great variety of deities and their divine portfolios, it naturally follows that some deities would endow their mortal servants with the power to channel energies in other ways that more closely mirror their particular focus. 

This requirement of a deity to empower / alter the channeling is fundamental to variant channeling rules. As such upon becoming an ex-cleric the variant channeling endowment is gone. 

The ex-cleric could channel so that fulfills the requirements of Channel Entropy and their ability to channel is just that - the ability to channel without the variant option. 

Still, ask your GM. Their ruling is what counts."

puppy101,fe6k91j,t3_enyvb6,1578893646.0,"Let's step back for a moment and think about a few things. First, how would a puppy know what ""No"" means?  Did you teach it to them?  No need to answer but remember a puppy knows nothing. They do not understand human. They barely understand puppy. They don't even understand dog. 

It is our responsibility to teach them everything or put them in a position to be taught what we cannot. 

Looking at your scenario you have a puppy happily exploring the world and having a blast chewing on something cause it is fun or tasty or just plain something to do. Suddenly there is a loud bark followed by a harsh sound and a loud stomp. 

I can see why a puppy would also bark when that loud thump happens. You barked first. Therefore when you stomp your foot it is obvious that the correct response is to bark. Right? 

That doesn't help fix the issue though so what can you do?  Well, if your puppy is chewing on everything then it is time to step up your supervision of them. Leash them up and keep the cute pup tethered to you so you can keep an eye on them. That way before they get into trouble you can intercept the behaviour and direct them to something more appropriate such as a chew toy. 

On top of this I suspect you may want to work on some core behaviours and teach, ""leave it.""   

You may also find a lot of value of increasing your play time with pup. Play is a valuable teaching tool and it has the benefit of draining energy along with brain power which if properly directed leads to happy nap time.

When you think about what retrievers are meant to do: retrieve water fowl then the size makes sense. It would be very challenging to retrieve a 4 to 6 lbs duck from the water when the dog is only 30-ish lbs. 

Forget retrieving geese. 

No responsible breeder of goldens or labs would breed for that size.  The smallest golden within the breed standard is 55 lbs as a female. Males should start at 65 lbs.  Labs have a similar standard. 

Even flat coats should be 55 lbs although I have met smaller ones. 

Tollers should be 37 lbs minimum for a female and 45ish lbs for a male although the American Kennel Club's standard omits the recommended weights (at least when I last checked) so there are smaller tollers. My guy is 40 lbs. 

However, tollers are not well suited for service work for most people. While they are very empathetic they tend to be very environmentally aware and quick to react. This makes them ""hot"" or ""twitchy"" - instead of calm and enduring.

In terms of traveling via an airline - that depends on which airline you take for determining if the ESA status would permit your dog in the cabin on the way back from Canada into the USA.

Beyond that, a lot of dog rules will depend on where in Canada you are going.  Some provinces have breed restrictions.  Some cities have their own breed restrictions.  The leash laws can vary from location to location.  So take some time before you travel to look into the locations you are going to visit to see what the dog rules are.

Dogs are typically NOT allowed in restaurants of any kind.  In the warmer months some places may allow dogs on patios but that is very much location dependent and varies city to city.  Even within a city a lot of places will not allow dogs on the premises even if there is a by-law that makes it permissible.

The short of it: 

* You are allowed to enter Canada with a pet dog.  
* Your pet dog needs to have a rabies certificate that has all the information about the vaccination and be signed by a licensed vet.  
* Your dog food may or may not be allowed to enter into Canada
* Expect delays - dogs can be asked for secondary inspection.  To further this, in theory, every dog visiting Canada should go through an inspection by Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) but that doesn't necessarily hold true.
* Airlines have different rules on top of these so make sure those are followed.  If you're going to use ESA status to travel in the cabin with your dog then make sure ESA status is recognized on your RETURN into the USA from Canada.  If it is an American based airline it should be fine.  But always check first by contacting the Airline.
* ESA status is not recognized in Canada

Further, make sure that you meet any State requirements for your return trip in terms of documentation.  As such, I'd recommend a full vet health report card type document that has everything and then you won't have to worry.

In terms of actually getting the puppy - take time off.   Take a vacation for at least a week and preferably two.  Use that time to teach all of the basics, get a good start on house training, work on how to be alone, etc..  Then, when you go back to work, you'll have some more confidence on how your puppy will be.

I'd still have someone go and check on them during the day like at noon if your pup had gotten that far with being alone.  If not, for the first couple of weeks after you're back at work have someone check in with the pup twice a day for potty breaks.

After that you can go down to one break a day (lunch time visit) and then a few months later (like at around six? months or so - although it depends entirely upon your pup) you can stop even that.

Further, you can make use of boarding facilities to help out.  There are all kinds of options.

As an aside, my toller is a ridiculously good retriever.  He is fast, he is driven, he has a lot of natural instinct, and he doesn't give up.  For the most part there isn't a split in tollers between 'show lines,' 'pet lines,' and 'hunt lines.'

Story time:  when I first started thinking about getting a dog (at this point this is like... almost 20 years ago) I met a lot of breeders, met a lot of dogs, did the whole research thing, and I was totally ready.  I had all the things.  Gosh, it was time.  I knew I could handle it.

I got the puppy - a beautiful and incredibly confident golden retriever.  She was so amazing.  Shortly after getting her I started suffering from super crazy allergies.  My health was going down, I couldn't sleep (and it didn't help that I had a puppy and I had very limited resources on how to learn on what to do with a puppy), the stress was piling up, I was taking allergy pills every day, and it was barely helping.

I had to make a decision.  So, I returned the puppy.  At the time I thought that it had turned out that close exposure to a dog had revealed a severe allergy to them.

After the puppy was gone I continued to have allergies so I got myself tested.  It turns out that I was NOT allergic to dogs - it had just happened that there was something else in the air that was significantly more potent then any other years.

That whole experience rattled me though so the next year I ended up getting a puppy that I co-owned with my dad.  Another golden retriever.  She was brilliant and lived to be around 13 years old.  

I got my very own toller  puppy three and a half years ago.

Anyway, the take away:  returning the puppy and then getting another one later actually helped me tremendously with the new one.  I had the experience of that first one, the stresses, the pressure, the emotional investment including the giving her up.  All of that provided me with a greater understanding for the second pup.

In short, just because you returned this puppy that doesn't mean that you can never get a dog in the future.  Your circumstances are different so only you will know for certain if that is the case.  However, do not allow having returned one puppy from getting a dog in the future if it works at that time.

What you have gone through - up to and including the return - is super powerful experience.  Who knows, if you believe in this kind of thing, it might be that you were meant to get a puppy and then return the pupster so that you could be ready for the next time.

Give yourself some time to take in and process the whole situation.  You can revisit having a dog in a year or so.  

At the end of the day, as you wrote, you made the right decision.  Stand tall and proud for it - it is a hard one to make.  Just remember, even though Ocho was with you for a short period of time he will leave a lasting legacy."
RunningWithDogs,fceqyhh,t1_fcepqhb,1577622968.0,"Later is better.  :)

Ideally, your pup will have stopped growing and her growth plates will be closed."
RunningWithDogs,fcep7pn,t3_eh5cs8,1577622519.0,"My advice in a nutshell:

* Get your dog checked out by an expert in canine movement / fitnes (a vet who understands canine movement works.)  Make sure your dog is structurally sound to distance run regularly.
* Start small.  Doing couch to 5 km with your dog is a good way for both of you to get started.  If you're already able to go beyond 5km then structure your runs to return your dog home at the appropriate distance (or time) and go on without her until she's built up the capacity to keep up wit you.

Some notes:  don't force your dog to keep running if they begin to slow or slack.  Pay attention to your dog's attitude and manner.  It's very easy to ask a dog to do more than what they should.  Just because a dog CAN keep going doesn't mean that they should keep going.  

Dogs are masters are concealing pain and discomfort.  Often by the time they are letting you know that there is something wrong it's been wrong for quite awhile.

* Make running fun.  Reward her for it and reward her for staying with you.  If you can vary your pace that may help her.  

This is a long term project and not a short term.  You want a running buddy for life and not just for a year or two or three."
dogs,fcemmve,t3_eh2zqc,1577621864.0,"I don't understand some elements of your story.  If your dog is your dog and you saw your dog being chased around with a rubber puppet that was causing him discomfort why didn't YOU intervene?

You should have stepped in immediately and taken your dog out of the room.  

You failed to stand up for your dog.

In the second incident, again, why didn't YOU intervene?  How did you even allow the situation to escalate to the point that the nephew had your dog by the collar?

I really don't understand this.

Now, the consequences of what happened:  your dog is probably not going to be as kid proof as he once was.  He's now been scared by a child in a mean manner which may make him wary of kids and then HE was punished for warning the little human to back off.  People were shouting at him and as you said ""mass chaos"" happened - not fun times for your dog.

This uncertainty regarding little humans was then reinforced in the second incident.  The dog was feeling uncertain about the little human (quite probably due to the previous incident) so told the brat to quit it (your dog probably gave a bunch of warnings that no one paid attention to) and was punished more severely.  What is the take away for your dog?  Little human comes near / touches collar / whatever your dog remembers (likely regarding little humans) and he gets hurt and yelled at.  Little humans aren't good.  On top of that big humans might not be good either.

The good news is that dogs are pretty forgiving and they do not generalize well so if your dog is like mine - he'd only not trust that one kid and that one adult until they prove trustworthy again.

Personally, I don't think any infant or even young kid should play with a dog unsupervised.  Kids are dumb.  Most are remarkably hurtful.  The vast majority are never taught how to interact with an animal.  As such, if you have a dog who will be interacting with a human child of any age it is up to you to supervise the entire time and to provide the rules framework for dog and child to interact within.

Are your family's expectations realistic?  Kind of.  Some dogs are remarkably tolerant of being messed with.  Some are not.

Did your dog behave appropriately?  Sort of.  The situation should never have been allowed to escalate to where it did.  You write no signs of distress and yet you knew your dog was uncomfortable and did nothing.  Signs of distress are important to act upon when they happen.  You do everything in your power to deescalate a situation and support your dog.  It does not matter if the other participants in a situation are at fault - if you have to then you can blame later.  When something is happening it is your responsibility to step in and stop that something."

I don't quite understand why your dog is not hike appropriate since hikes are... well.. just walking along and in most places that's with the dogs all on-leash.  I don't see how having another dog who is also on-leash would be a problem unless your guy is super reactive.  If that's the case then that's a whole barrel of fish that should be addressed (it can be addressed with time and effort.)

I take at least one in-person class / month which tends to be a class of dog friends at this point.  We actually structure our class so that those who get on best with one another have class with one another.

I meet up with friends at places where we bring our dogs or it's just my dog and friends.  Everyone seems to like my guy and I've been known as the outdoors kind of guy for my entire life so when I got my toller that didn't change other than I go out a lot more.  

I prefer a hike to going to a movie.  I prefer snowshoeing to grabbing a coffee.  I prefer a picnic in a remote location (read: have to hike to) than going out for dinner.  I like being outside more than doing normal date-y things.  On the flip side of that I really enjoy just relaxing at home and doing basically nothing.  As such, my dog doesn't impact that at all.  

I'm happy to say that today I successfully jogged for 6km straight and after a short break (of like two minutes) I jogged for another 6km straight - all with my guy.  So, in that regard, he's been super good at improving my endurance.

I go with my dog on holiday.  

I've gotten more involved in various dog sports and activities and have made friends with a lot of really amazing fellow dog owners.  

My guy is totally okay with being left alone so I can leave him alone if I want to.  I made certain that I taught him how to be alone with confidence.  Funnily enough the longest that he's had to be alone (like 12 hours) was because of a dog event I was volunteering at.

I tend not to leave him home alone because I am not a huge fan of normal social activities anyway.  I know that I can go out and be gone for hours if I want to and he'll be just peachy.  As to when that was the case - I could leave him crated when he was six months old for hours.  I gave him the full run of my place when he was just over a year old so now when I go out he's out and does what he does (which tends to be him sneaking onto my bed and snuggling on my pillow or just relaxing in his crate which is open.)

As an aside, my guy doesn't typically play with other dogs.  He likes his space and prefers dogs who are polite - as in they are nearby but don't pester him.  He gets annoyed with dogs with no manners so small dog parks are a no go with him.  Besides, I've found that he doesn't get a lot of exercise in the dog park so it's better to go places where we can do our thing.

If you're asking specifically about dating - I let my dog judge my dates.  lol

He's incredibly empathetic and intuitive so he knows if someone is a good egg or a bad egg.  Anyone who doesn't pass the dog test gets a gentle let down and polite goodbye."

Dogtraining,fc1erta,t3_efn2kw,1577316590.0,"That's part of house training.  This is one of the more difficult elements of House Training that many people never bother with.  A lot of ""house trained"" dogs are not actually house trained in any place other than their own home.  If you read the various dog subreddits you'll see this quite frequently where people talk about how their ""house trained"" dog is peeing or having ""accidents"" when they go elsewhere.

Anyway, how do you work on this?  The same what you'd work on it at home - interrupt and redirect to an appropriate pee place then reward.

With my intact male I got annoyed with him marking every five steps (or so it felt) while walking so I taught him that marking while on-leash was a no-go.  I did this by using my interrupt vocalization that he'd learned as a puppy as a ""don't do that"" and then rewarding him for NOT marking.  My sound was like a hard ""tSCHK!"" kinda vocalization.

If I saw him getting ready to mark I'd make the noise and move on quickly - if he didn't pee I'd reward his continued forward movement.  

At three years of age our arrangement is this:  no peeing while on-leash.  No peeing indoors.  No peeing on short grass (because he competes in outdoor arenas we can't have him peeing in the ring) and no peeing just because another male peed there no matter how much his instinct is telling him otherwise.

Your pup is young so give him some understanding that his instinct to respond to a puppy-post is super vital.  How well can you resist the urge the immediately text back if you receive a message on your phone?  

You can totally teach him not to do it - once you decide what your rules are going to be you will have to enforce them 100% of the time.  Treat whatever environment you don't want him to mark or pee in to be exactly the same as your house training environment.  Teach him the same way that it is unacceptable to pee or mark in that kind of space.

The hardest for my guy:  pet stores.  So many dogs have ""accidents"" in pet stores.  It took a very long time before I felt comfortable enough with him to not respond to a puppy-post that I can take my eyes off of him for brief moments while in a pet store."
