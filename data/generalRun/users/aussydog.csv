todayilearned,fgi27rb,t3_eykdqt,1580802162.0,"A local radio morning show promised to send a pair of people to Miami to watch the Superbowl. They ran the contest for nearly a month with people having to call in at specific times and be the 44th caller on the line. 

In the end they did indeed send the contest winners to Miami to watch the Superbowl. Unfortunately for the winners, they got sent to the tiny rural town of Miami, Manitoba in Canada and watched the Superbowl on tv at some shit bar.

Kind of a dick move if you ask me."

So I made a sling shot out of a long elastic and a piece of paper folded into a V. About 4inches  long with each leg being 2inches as it was folded at the middle. Pulling the legs back with the elastic in the middle I sat at the back of the bus with my weapon cocked waiting for the annoying kid to get on. 

The kid before him got on and sat down. I had a clear shot. My friend said ""do it"" and I let loose the volley from my slingshot of doom. It rocketed to the front of the bus and pegged the kid right between the eyes just above his glasses. Perfect headshot. 

The bus erupted in cheers and laughter. I was a hero. I'd shown that asshat kid who was boss. 

Then he started crying....and didn't stop till we got to school. The bus driver told him to shut up multiple times. I don't think I've ever felt like such a dick. 

He never sang on the bus again. He never made eye contact with anyone on the bus again. He never recited pi to 100 digits again. I broke his spirit that day and it bugs me that I never apologized for being such an asshole."

The volume, pitch, and consistency of the purring made it purrrrfect white noise for my ears/brain and I started to doze off. Truly, if it wasn't for the camera jostling noises I would have."
spacex,fftoglx,t1_ffsolp7,1580225621.0,"A friend of mine's mom was a child psychologist which is only relevant because of certain things she used to do in the family that could be construed as....experimentation.

The part that is relevant to the Elon thing, however, was that she instituted this hand gesture that everyone had to do when talking at the table. 

They had to single that they had something to say by putting their hand up with two fingers extended (like a priest in the middle of doing the cross thing) and when the current speaker was done talking they would then extend the rest of the hand before relaxing it to the table. Once done speaking they would make a ""go ahead"" gesture as if scooping a little bit of air towards whomever had the next thing to say.

He didn't realize other families didn't do this till junior high, but out of habit continued to do it all the way into high school which is where I met him."
