Increasing age= weight gain

Bad genetics = weight gain

Mental/physical illness = weight gain

Medication side effects = weight gain

Socio-economic situation = weight gain

They always frame it like this because it removes the actual reason and gives them a ton of excuses, so they can continue to reject any personal responsibility for their situation, and thus, continue without blame or shame that they have the power to change it. the arguments are flawed because these ""factors"" are not the primary reason for weight gain, they are secondary or tertiary side effects at best. the arguments should look like this:

Increasing age= reduced energy output from activity = weight gain

Bad genetics = being short/small needing less than most but eating like your 6' 3"" friend or having unfavourable weight distribution = weight gain

Mental/physical illness = less active / emotional eating = weight gain

Medication side effects = increased appetite as a side effect so eating more = weight gain

Socio-economic situation = better access to calorie dense food without needing to exert physical effort to get it (deskjobs and supermarkets) = weight gain

These things can lead to weight gain indirectly, but the cause of weight gain is always gong to be taking in more calories than you use.

If there was a pill that promised you that you'd have virtually the same physicality at almost 70 as you did at 35, like the difference was so small it was imperceptible, the owner of that pill would make a fortune, but tell people they need to watch what they eat and take regular exercise, and no one will believe you."

These days, there has to be at least some truth to it. take CBD oil for example, the result are getting clearer with each test, it does something, it's having an effect in certain area above that of a placebo, but why does that translate to it being sold via social media and booths at public events. 

I'm a martial arts coach and every tournament, seminar, interclub or fight night in the last couple of years, has had a booth selling CBD oil, with a couple of people wandering around the event extoling it's virtues for every possible treatable condition and malady, from anxiety to the Zika virus (ok an exaggeration but not by much)

I can't think of a single other medical breakthrough that has gone through the same treatment. where are the CRISPR stalls at conventions and malls spreading the good news about gene editing? where are the MLM mamas on facebook who haven't spoken to me since highschool, to tell me all about the new Cystic fibrosis wonderdrug Trikafta? 

No other genuine medicine gets this treatment, and the fact that people are doing this with CBD oil only lessens it's credibility, credibility that might stop it from being used by people who would actually need it, like sufferers of epilepsy and MS.

I've had friends walk out of the room, irritated by me ruining movie night (which we do every Saturday) while others try to find movies or episodes of TV shows that will fool me with the twist, and they can find it very infuriating that even with a show i don't follow i can almost always see the approaching plot twist, and infuriatingly for me because it's not a superpower, and i can be fallible, when they do find something that i don't get or get wrong they lord it over me for ages.

My closest friend thankfully thinks its pretty cool and doesn't mind it, i think he's just gotten used to it, but he likes to use it to annoy other people by proxy, he bet everyone that i could figure who done it before anyone else when the new Sherlock Holmes with Benedict Cumberbatch came out and we all gathered together to watch it, he handed me a piece of paper and told me to write down who done it as soon as i knew. at about 4 mins into the 90 min episode just as a lad is walking back home to get a second umbrella i wrote my answer down and handed it back, much to the incredible annoyance of everyone, and when the episode was over they opened the folded piece of paper and i was right. I was outright accused of cheating and my close friend accused of colluding (as he had small wagers with everyone, not cash but food/drink etc).

Probably the worst thing to come of it though is some of them thinking that this made me smart, and they kept trying to get me to come to quiz night at the pub with them, with disastrous results, because my inability to answer questions at the quiz only made me look more like a cheat, even though genera/pop culture knowledge, and being able to figure something out are two different things.

I swear you can't say ""vest"" or anything with vest in like ""invest"" without them launching into Mr Burns ""See my vest, see my vest made from real gorilla chest......""

martialarts,fc8hdnv,t3_egdy7w,1577534943.0,"If you want to get more height and work the muscles to increase your endurance, get a bar, bench or box to rest your leg on, ideally you want something that you can adjust the height of, i tend to use the box we have for box jumps, with a number of the long kick shields we have in the gym, i stack them so that they are a couple of inches below my max height on the kick, i stick my leg out and rest it on the pads and settle into good kicking posture. I then raise my leg up to my highest point and then slowly drop it back down to rest on the pads, i keep good kicking form, and don't swing or use momentum in any way, just lift and return through the arc of movement. 

This is hell on the small stabilizing muscles that might not get a complete workout if you were doing full reps from the ground, because those smaller muscles tire quickly and the bigger muscles start compensating, and momentum starts creeping into your form. 

After 3 sets to failure on each leg with rest in-between i have increased my range a noticeable amount just from one session. 

For an even greater return, get resistances bands and hang them from above, from a pull up bar, or punch bag hook and work to move through the negative range of motion, so hang your leg up as high as you can in the resistance band, and pull the band down as if trying to get your foot all the way to the ground. 

This really helped me get my hip flexibility and mobility, as well as much of my leg dexterity and kicking ability after a serious accident that left me bedridden so long that the muscles in my injured leg atrophied noticeably."

todayilearned,fc6mxs8,t1_fc6lcxe,1577484391.0,"Meh, I've taught Martial arts for 21 years, MMA for a lot of that, i've ran kids classes, adults classes, been involved in my local, Karate, TKD, Judo circuits as judge/ref timekeeper you name it, I've done it, I've run a club in the UK and have fighters who have fought in Thailand and China as well as our local circuit, i recently cornered for a fighter at the English Amateur Women's Boxing cup, Combat sports is in my blood, it what i know.

When a normal well adjusted adult fights with kids, they self sabotage themselves, throttling their power and subconsciously giving the weaker party a fighting chance. Even though i like to think of myself a good coach, a sociopath who had no such fair play scruples could wade through an entire class of kids, with hardly a scratch. they just don't have the power. 

at 7 the kids don't need to be seperated by sex for sparring/training the girls at 7 can hold their own against the boys at 7, but once puberty kicks in, the boys start to get that strength advantage, that can only be evened up if the girl is heavier/older or more experienced. 

I don't doubt your example, I've just seen a lot of average 7 year olds in the classroom, and i'm fairly certain that a committed and dangerous amoral adult isn't going to struggle with a child."

todayilearned,fc6khu3,t1_fc6endw,1577482728.0,"you're right he didn't fight him off, truth is no 7 year old could fight a fully grown adult off if the adult was determined, and full of malice, and any 7 year old faced with such an adult would fully feel how useless a prospect such an altercation would be, in that moment his opponent would look like a giant, and his own knees would be knocking together so much he would suspect that it was actually making a noise. like in your dreams when fighting seems like you are throwing punches underwater, the idea of putting up any kind of resistance must have been near insurmountable.

But that's just it, this young man, put in an impossible position that not even a grown up should have to face, swallowed his fear, and fought an impossible fight, turnaround was likely inevitable, and yet he did it anyway.

If you've never been in a life or death situation before, it is near impossible to explain the paralyzing effect that fear can have on adults, let alone children. 

What he did was brave and selfless, and neither success nor survival are requirements of those traits. he might not have fought him off, but he held the mans attention long enough for his sister to escape.

In this instance i think the mistake would be in not understanding that both coaches could be right, and that there is a portion of people who find one better than the other based on their own physical dimensions, and not on the details being taught. 

It's almost impossible to believe that either of these guys haven't seen hard evidence of the method they are coaching being successful in competition which strongly leads me to suspect that they are both right."
