""Would of"" is definitely far more common than ""a charm"".

Where do you draw the line on what should and should not be in the dictionary? Seems a bit arbitrary.

>What did ""linked's"" mean? I'm unfamiliar with that contraction. OH! Hang on. I just got it. You should have used dashes to clarify that. Like this

What you've described is unnecessary, and may actually be incorrect (though I'm not familiar enough with the use of dashes to say definitively). ""Linked's"" is possessive, it belongs to ""dictionary"". As I said, the sentence is grammatically correct as written.

>So if you were certain that OP was Chinese, you would still have asked that question?

>Are you not the person who asked, ""Why are American Redditors so bad at speaking English?""?! You must be joking. Even if you had Asperger's you would know why you asked that question.

I did ask that, yes. I didn't say that OP was American though.

[This stack exchange discussion](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/404274/three-times-a-charm-vs-third-times-a-charm) suggests that ""a charm"" is a confusion of the actual adage.

Some dictionaries opt to list common grammar or idiomatic errors (mostly popularized by Americans) as alternate definitions. While there will always be a balance of prescription vs description in language, I don't agree with the dictionary you've linked's choice to list a mishearing of the proper adage as an alternative.
