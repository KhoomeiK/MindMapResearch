Oxygennotincluded,feq7z6l,t3_eqbfev,1579338637.0,"First, the simpler things

You don't need to seal off your generators. It's better off not to so your dupes can repair them.

Also give it a bigger chamber. It means a bigger buffer before over pressure and gas mixing together.

Now the more advanced stuff

Let the eletrolyser sit on mesh tiles instead of air flow tiles, so in case of liquids falling on it (pipes bust), it doesn't stop working immediately

Use one generator for the SPOM and the other one for your base. Feed hydrogen to your SPOM generator first then the other one. Achieve this using overflow bridges.

The last thing I do is to use doors with automation to help prime the system. So in addition to mesh tiles I also have doors underneath the hydrogen pumps connecting both chambers, and a automation line for me to control them remotely. When I prime the system, I turn off the hydrogen pumps, turn on the eletrolysers and open the doors. Hydrogen flows up to the top and everything else goes down and sucked out of there into your base. When it's just hydrogen up there, close the doors and turn on the pumps and there you go. No need to pre vacuum the area."

You don't need to seal off your generators. It's better off not to so your dupes can repair them.

Also give it a bigger chamber. It means a bigger buffer before over pressure and gas mixing together.

Now the more advanced stuff

Let the eletrolyser sit on mesh tiles instead of air flow tiles, so in case of liquids falling on it (pipes bust), it doesn't stop working immediately

Use one generator for the SPOM and the other one for your base. Feed hydrogen to your SPOM generator first then the other one. Achieve this using overflow bridges.

The last thing I do is to use doors with automation to help prime the system. So in addition to mesh tiles I also have doors underneath the hydrogen pumps connecting both chambers, and a automation line for me to control them remotely. When I prime the system, I turn off the hydrogen pumps, turn on the eletrolysers and open the doors. Hydrogen flows up to the top and everything else goes down and sucked out of there into your base. When it's just hydrogen up there, close the doors and turn on the pumps and there you go. No need to pre vacuum the area."

Pipe the liquids near the cooling loop and let the loop handle the heat. Your base will still be nice and cool and even if there is a back up or empty pipe. Your cooling loop has one job and your liquid input to your base has another, don't stack everything on one if you don't need to.

As for food get some drekos, plant some mealwood or pepper for them to eat and let them make phosphite. Put some fertilizer makers in a sealed room and then you can get some Nat gas for your kitchen. If you don't have enough dirt make some using ethanol distillers.

Other than that, and perhaps rockets, you don't really need anything other than insulated tiles. 

One tile thick is enough to hold of 70+ C for at least 300 cycles. In theory it is capable of much more but haven't need to test it out.

Two tiles you are pretty much set.

With Vacuum you need 3 at least, and is hard to set up or maintain compared to insulated tiles. It really isn't necessary unless you need to hold back some extreme temperatures which is rare."
