aww,fgajub0,t1_fgaivjy,1580652137.0,"Yeah I know a lot more about them now.  My mom, bless her, she tried.  She bought care books and tried to ""bunny proof"" our living room.  I did the same for the cables in the basement.  Funny enough she loved to be held by me at least. Or I thought she did.  I could wrap her gently in a towel so I could trim her nails and then just cuddle her.  

She was actually won from a fair.  Basically we had, had a back yard incident with wild rabbits.  My mom was sad that a poor baby bunny didnt make it.  Went to a fair and some kid was walking around with a rabbit he had won at he carnival game.  But he couldn't take it home.  My dad said he would and gave it to my mom.  Us kids were THRILLED!  Our dog was indifferent.  It was a learning experience for sure.  The problem came when we had to move to a new state and the new house just didnt have the same space for her.  But I did my best.  I would love to have a rabbits again in the future."
aww,fgah99u,t1_fgaastf,1580651248.0,"Really? I always hoped that they were.  That makes me happy.  Long story short, my family ended up with a bunny that we had no idea how to care for.  We did our best, but we moved. The new place didnt have a finished basement but I hung out down there anyway and we were forced to keep her cage down there.  She would thump to get my attention and I would let her out and run around as long as she wanted and she did those jump kicks ALL the time around our dog.  I felt bad that she was forgotten about by the rest of the family so I did my best to play with her.  I was like 13 or 14 at the time. Eventually we gave her to some family friends and she only lived another year.  She was about 7 years old."

LiftingRoutines,fg2wsrz,t3_ew7kke,1580459330.0,"Check out MoveU on IG. It might help supplement. One guy is a chiropractor the other one I think was/  is a Physio student. But they’re all about self-help and rehabilitation type exercises.  Could help you retrain your form so you don’t have to give up squats and dead’s. I’ve had a herniated disc before. Still squat still deadlift. If you retrain your form and mobility your chance of reinjury  goes way down. 

In the meantime a lot of the suggestions you’ve gotten already are great. Special shoutout to split squats and single leg RDLs, high rep low weight. You nail that form and your back is protected."

Next issue, which I only just discovered, Phillipines spawned in central Africa"
Civilization6,fg0ey51,t1_fg0dvfa,1580406381.0,I’m actually surprised it’s working as well as it is so far. A bit jumpy at times. Can’t wait to build a new rig and see what THAT can do. I’ve just got an old FX 6350 currently.
Civilization6,fg0ettg,t1_fg0ddy2,1580406311.0,"That sounds intense. But it’s I’ll want a free for all but perhaps just delayed ability to wage wars. Maybe make it so war can’t break out until like a certain turn?

CasualConversation,fg0eney,t1_fg0401e,1580406204.0,"Oh without question. So that is a limitation of these studies. Because then you can start picking apart demographics and who/ what type of people are more likely to work different types of jobs and how socioeconomic status plays into this. Let’s be honest though, the average - key word there - doesn’t do any of that, regardless of job type. As long as it’s an *average* role."
coys,fg03bld,t1_ffzrfod,1580399290.0,"No. See that’s the issue. They thought they were being friendly by letting them participate. But they took too many practice corners and free kicks using 12 years olds that his height gauge has been ducked since.

CasualConversation,fg01ezy,t1_ffzy80f,1580398068.0,Also a very good point that any article I’ve read that’s *actually* worth a damn will attempt to address. At the very least they acknowledge it. That’s why if you google workplace prevalence of injury or chronic injury specifically many articles will be psychology articles as well. Because they need to evaluate both mental status as lifestyle traits that predispose them to chronic issues.
CasualConversation,ffzu9o4,t1_ffzpfn3,1580393043.0,"That’s a key point there that although it’s not necessarily true that people who work trade or manual labor or more likely to hurt themselves and be physically broken later in life, if they don’t follow proper recommended safety precautions and quality-of-life precautions while on the job then yeah. They probably are a little bit more likely to hurt themselves"
CasualConversation,ffzswkd,t1_ffyzxpd,1580391954.0,"Actually not true. When you look at statistics office based jobs have a higher rate of low back and neck pains often related to disc related injuries.

On the flip side acute injuries and knee problems ARE more likely. But with proper physio therapy they can be managed better. 

Fact is it’s better to move. In some way. Any way, than it is to sit at a desk all day.

**edit** because I know someone will ask, here is a link to an article. It is t the same one I’ve read before, so forgive me if it isn’t spot on. But scanning through there’s a section that points out manufacturers and similar roles had one of the lowest incidence as did musicians, entrepreneurs and managers. Now this article https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3489435/
Is for Germany. I’m American and read an American article so findings may differ. 

Also I realize I’m talking specifically about back pain but considering back pain is by far the most common sort of injury that affects people in the workplace I thought it worth pointing out that at least in regards to back injuries, being a trade worker versus a desk worker doesn’t mean that you’re more likely to hurt yourself necessarily"
Civilization6,ffzg7cy,t3_ew0mvo,1580377494.0,"I’ve actually not played much with Gathering Storm activates yet. But what I just had happen last night was I tried to do a giant map game. 30 Civs 25 City states with true start. I have picked 15 of the civs to try and have at least 3 powers on each major continent so wars would be early and often. But...

My disaster came in the mistake of putting a modded Attila the Hun on the map. He immediately fucked Alexander. Vercingetorix’ Gaul and Charlamagne immediately pissed off Barbosa and trapped me as Rome in Italy. I expanded to North Africa only to get hedged in by some African Civ, who declared surprise war and took one of my two North Africa cities. 

Seriously most difficult start I’ve ever had and it’s only on King.

television,ffhvd3t,t1_ffhkldn,1579955645.0,I think was partly due to them realizing they only had a season or so to wrap it up. They we’re running out of compelling ideas. So they had to go with a Boyd that suddenly craved money and power and was losing his redeeming qualities.
