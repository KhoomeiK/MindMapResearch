depression,fdcuype,t1_fd6r160,1578285054.0,"Just things about me that I didn't want them to know. Like telling them about my depression, suicide attempts, being an atheist (big deal in my family) so on so forth. Just things they didn't need to know about."
depression,fd4knyv,t1_fd2pgtu,1578168439.0,Being treated differently is the worst part. I can't stand people thinking I need to be coddled.
depression,fd0g42x,t1_fd0co7w,1578118295.0,"Everyone deserves someone they can actually trust. Unfortunately trusting people is really hard when you have been back stabbed X number of times. The worst is when you can be going great for a long time, confide in them, trust them. But when yout illness rears its darkness. They just up and leave. It's like people don't understand what they're truly getting into when you date someone with problems. It's like people think ""oh, depression is just a little extra sad sometimes"" not: staying in bed for hours, not wanting to talk, self destructive behaviour, lack of eating. It's much worse than people understand"
depression,fd0fcrn,t1_fd04f65,1578118002.0,Yeah. After she took everything I gave her and used it to attack my family (revealing things they didn't need to know) specifically to hurt my family relations.  Oh yeah. I was so angry. Words cannot describe the seething hatred.
depression,fd0f18j,t1_fd001fp,1578117878.0,"The only things I need to do are: work really hard on progress, show up, and be motivated. And if my professors like what I'm doing they can nominate me. Two people a month get chosen. And I've never worked so hard on school this entire year. So it just feels pointless."
depression,fczzb19,t1_fczs3ox,1578111220.0,I failed 12 times in a row. I tried every month all the way till December with that hope still lingering. Every month I failed.
depression,fczz4np,t1_fczunsw,1578111132.0,Oh don't get me wrong. I was BEYOND livid. But that's a talk for a different time.
depression,fczq6fd,t1_fcz2jhq,1578106670.0,As someone who had a SO fire it back. I dont really talk about my problems anymore. Other than the occasional anonymous online post. Having that shit thrown back in your face hurts more than anything.
depression,fbtvetw,t3_eeevoi,1577097972.0,"I fucking feel this. Too much. Granted I hate Christmas more than any holiday I've ever had to endure. But I always feel like shit when people get me things. 9/10 times I dont actually like or need the item, but I appreciate the thought. Then I feel guilty because I either can't afford presents, or simply want to move on with another average unspectacular day of the year without thinking I haven't reciprocated. If I could just either ignore the holiday 100% or just be exclusively a gift giver and not a reciever. Maybe I wouldn't hate participating."
