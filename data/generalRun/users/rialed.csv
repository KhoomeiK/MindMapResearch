fatlogic,ff9edhs,t1_ff77lpf,1579711198.0,"And even people with eating disorders have to face the fact that their weight is dependent on diet. Trying to work with someone who has an eating disorder and trying to separate their weight from what they eat will inevitably result in relapse. That’s why so many of the new clinics like that approach: everyone feels good about rejecting ‘diet culture’ and all the relevant facts; clients lose (or gain) weight in the controlled environment of the clinic, and best of all, clients are set up for failure when they return to the real world and then they get to visit the clinic again. Cha-ching! Profit!"

fatlogic,ff3pcay,t3_ergneb,1579545962.0,"I assume from Ragen’s renewed anger at healthcare professionals that her recent series of health problems are due to, or exacerbated, by her obesity and, as always, shooting the messenger is her preferred method of ‘activism.’ 

Like any tantrum, it doesn’t change reality, it just makes you feel better before the inevitable."

television,ff1daqt,t1_ff16yoc,1579477719.0,"Yeah, the insanity and betrayal of the Republicans repeating their mantra of ‘No evidence!’ and ‘No witnesses’ relentlessly despite the fact of overwhelming evidence and numerous witnesses, not including the ones that Trump has ordered to defy the law. 

That’s what’s wrong with the country, the president and the Republicans. It’s the lies, the nonstop lies. Someday I hope they all pay for their treason against their oaths and their country."
politics,ff1bsw9,t1_fevuhf0,1579477256.0,"Day by day, week by week, month by month, he’s losing voters. I’m struck by how many Trump supporters say they were all for him until he did __________ . And he’s certainly not gaining any new supporter. 

In November, we’ll add up the total but he lost by 3 million the first time. And that was with a lot people, who voted for him, saying he’s not as bad as he seems. It’s all talk. 

Now we know. Even if the Electoral College throws the election his way, the cries of illegitimacy will be louder than ever."
fatlogic,ff19wax,t3_er2wwc,1579476674.0,"By ‘weight bias,’ I think they mean facts about obesity and health.  Even if the format sucks, you can’t see an episode of that show and not realize how much obesity negatively impacts people."

askgaybros,ff16aeg,t3_er3yc0,1579475611.0,"Psychologytoday. com is the best site for licensed therapists. You can filter for LGBT therapists and a lot of other qualifications, specifically anxiety and depression. Beyond that, I’d be cautious of just doing a search for gay therapists, you’ll get results but those therapists tend to be focused intently on gay issues, their own and clients. 

My local gay and lesbian center offers therapy from interns for a nominal fee but believes that sexual orientation is a significant issue for all LGBT clients and always needs to be addressed in therapy."

If you’re overweight, it’s a sign that emotional eating may not be a solution to your problems and you need more help than food for your emotional issues."

fatlogic,fez6z12,t3_eqyanm,1579454412.0,"Ragen, when all your doctors think your weight is a problem; you might go to medical school, do an internship and a residency then pass your licensing boards to do the actual research to prove them wrong, or you might post rants on social media. 

Your choice but don’t be surprised, if someday in the future, you literally haven’t got a leg to stand on."

If she gave a shit about anyone else, she could leave him, get a book deal and start selling interviews. She’d make a fortune but she’d have to work and that’s not going to happen, no matter what happens to America or the world."

Should the Senators chose to let him stay in office, a year from now they will have the choice of being seen as idiots or traitors and held responsible for everything that’s yet to come as investigations continue and the courts resolve some of the issues.

politics,feuuh82,t1_fertu40,1579390049.0,"Reagan quietly backed support for HIV/AIDS issues by not opposing them. Not because he cared about gay people but because, back then, that it was spreading into the general population."

In general, Americans don’t pay much attention to the news from Washington and Americans are very slow to change course, but once they do, it is transformative."
AskLosAngeles,fel5qmd,t3_epo84k,1579214639.0,"No sane person does want to live on the street and the vast majority of the homeless are working. They just can’t afford a place to live. And they’re also ‘invisible’ in that they aren’t on the street. They’re living in their cars, crashing with friends or family, staying in motels. 

The myths about homelessness in LA are one reason it’s so hard to solve. 

Most of the homeless that you see on the streets have mental health issues, including addiction. Housing won’t solve that."
