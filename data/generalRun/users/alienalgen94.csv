drunk,ffe2dns,t1_ff2sat6,1579834903.0,"Yeah but a naturally uncut penis stimulates the clitoris at the same time as penetrating you deeply. 

At least if it is a nice fully grown penis.

Is that 80% of american women who respond to surveys? I believe that since most american men cant stimulate the clitoris while having sex since they lack a foreskin, women have to play with their own clitorises it's so sad!

I was cut as a 2 day old after being born and can say that since I started restoring my foreskin my girlfriend has been orgasming more.

I can get her to cum in 3 minutes by putting my middle finger in between her clit and clit hood and continuously dipping the finger in her wet vagina to keep her clit hood wet and sensitive.

I'm very spacially aware of objects and my surroundings so perhaps I'm just a talented man who enjoys seeing women orgasm.

It's that ""ahegao"" face with the rolled back eyes tongue out or biting lips and body that goes from total relaxation to spasm to total relaxation and I'm totally in control and she is just a puddle of cum I create.

Also if he has been circumcised you have never make intimate love it will always just be ""fucking.""

Circumcised guys dont feel anything and they exaggerate sex and focus on their own orgasms and dont care about their partner.

Instead of building trust with a partner and learning how they respond and them learning how he responds to stimulus, guys with cut and exposed penises with low sensation just get tired of a partner after a couples months and go seek the next high or rush.

Source: I had the end of my dick cut off the day after I was pushed out of the womb. Spent 19yo to 25yo going from girl to girl for the next high- smallest waist and biggest bust I could find. Now I am restoring my forskin and can actually feel sex and masturbation and I get full body orgasms I am treating my girlfriend now with trust and respect and we are learning what one another likes.

Sex is just a chore to cut men because they dont feel everything that naturally intact men do.

You are young enough to grab life by the balls (I know lol) and stretch that skin until you wake up with a 7 inch uncut cock like I will at 28 in 2022.

I'm almost 26 and almost at CI-3 and started at CI-0 last May. I stretch daily with the DTR and manually pinching at the scarline.

Yeah I have about 1-2 inches buried penis and an average erection is a solid 5.5-7 inches based on how intense the erection is. I believe that natural penis size is around 7 inches for uncut Europeans and Australians based on penis measurement studies and some of thos countries have laughed in comments about how small american average penis size is on youtube because of most Americans being cut.

When uncut and you get enough good nutrition and exercise and human growth hormone in adolescencent you should have a full 6-8 inch penis. So I had all that minus the uncut part. So the size is there I just have to do this ridiculous thing uncut guys dont have to which is called ""the bone-pressed penis measurement"" doing that I'm a ""bone-pressed 7.6 inches in length. It does not change girth obviously but affects your length significantly because of buried penis.

To that I say fuck you circumcision clamp companies and your asshole salesmen and lobbyists.

Now I just need skin and so do you!

Dont give up, yeah some days I dont tug maybe 4 days a month I'm just like screw this and maybe me and my girlfriend go to an amusement park grab some beers and mixed drinks and I dont tug at all for a mental health break. but 90% of days I am tugging until I get that nice foreskin.

Let me say my girlfriend is very supportive of me and she is a big help to my cause as she is excited for more slack skin and more sensitivity for me and less friction for her.

Yeah american girls in the north and east are used to chopped dicks but Californian girls are used to both.

California only has a 30% circumcision rate. They are the most progressive about thinking cutting baby boys is wrong. Go california my birth state! Sadly I was cut in california but that was when the rate was higher in the 90s.

Also good news: go to big cities and look for dating european girls, asian girls, indian girls, south american girls/Latina girls because they are all used to uncircumcised natural penises. Most Latinos born in america dont get circumcised. Just white people and black people mostly.

Also it's great to date other countries women they are so interesting! Dating a south korean girl and french girl was so fun and they are so beautiful!

askscience,fea37ij,t1_fe7cv8h,1578943902.0,I fully believe that based on my own experience circumcision after birth can cause some traumatic immediate and prolonged effects not to mention envy of men with intact bodies who were not hurt immediately after birth. Thoughts? I always thought I had mild PTSD.

personalfinance,fe94ev5,t1_fe92zh2,1578934136.0,"Electrical engineering is probably the most useful degree for the 21st century :)

Electricals I worked with were also some of the most burnt out and overworked hour wise.

They also had some of the highest salaries.

I guess just find some things to really balance your work life and life outside of work. Some other posters mentioned savings such as Roth which are all great now yes.

It's also a great time to take some risks for you since you are so young. I mean things like a road trip but also investing in some IPO startup stock for someone you think might create a useful tech for example skycoin.io

Good luck with school and work have u decided what industry you want to work in ?"
personalfinance,fe92q00,t3_eo365h,1578933547.0,"I will be honest, the desperation in your post makes me realize you are doing your current job and degree for the money.

Take a day off, walk around campus and take a picture of something memorable. Sit in the sun on the grass and think about what you would love to do everyday.

Change your major to something you would love to do, otherwise you will just be chasing money your entire life. 

If you are 21 and worried about retirement it means every day is a drag, working and studying but for what?? 

If you are 21 and not happy do u think u will be 42 and happy at this rate?

No way.

You will be burnt out, fatter, slower metabolism, less energy and less attractive by the time you are twice as old as you are now.

I understand working your butt off and getting an engineering degree sounds like a very safe financial place.

It definitely is. 

You have one life, decide if you want a toxic one or a harmonious one.

I dove out of software engineering after working in the field 2 years due to its toxicity and rough work life balance and went and got a psychology degree.

Rant:
I now think that I am suited to be a director or software engineers and designers because now me understanding how humans think and that everything is based on utility and positive feedback. Technology is only useful... if it's actually USEFUL.

We use a lot of technologies today that actually somewhat impede our full potential and we need to create technologies that enhance our individual and global potentials. It really destroys someone's natural life to have to spend so much of it keeping up a virtual life.

Consider pairing your engineering with classes in biology, psychology, sociology and nutrition.

It's not all about making big bucks, but following others who do the same thing and get measly results also won't allow you to live a life of freedom and early retirement.

I never want to retire, yet I want to feel as though I am already retired in my workplace. You must find what you want to put your hands on and even teach about every day.

Remove toxic people from your daily life, these may even include close friends and relatives unfortunately.

You are the average of those you surround yourself with, so change your surroundings and live in peace.

Or you could just keep doing what you are doing until your hair falls out ;)"

Just people who think for themselves and want to learn how to coexist with other people and also with animals and plants and maximize efficiencies on the earth sadly most of those countries have ice cold beaches and are cold and cloudy and rainy most of the year. 

Glad ur not prude by the way :)"
australia,fdcszkx,t1_fdcrr5q,1578283459.0,"Haha thanks for the honesty, I didn't mean politics just like people in general.

Like most adults here in the US you cant even be open about your body or sex and going to a nude beach ppl look at u and go ""omgggg what are u doing there what's WRONG WITH U?!!""

That's the childlike mindset that persists here. I am a naturist and I respect animals place and people and my body. Most ppl in the US dont care about anything. They just pretend to and it becomes fully aware upon conversing that its bullshit.

Honestly I wish england  (southern non parisian) france and Australia could mix and have a baby I would live there hah."

I tend to associate prude countries with how many nude beaches they have.

I think its safe to say:

Not prude: France 
Prude: australia 
Pruder: US
Prudest: England"
