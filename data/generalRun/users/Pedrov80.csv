If you REALLY think it wasn't worth it to stop multiple pigs from burning to death because they were going to die anyway, you're a worse animal rights activist than you seem to think. 

And then to the second point, the pigs were bred, ordered, raised humanly, and then killed quickly. So once again what did you want to happen to the pigs? Because the farmer wasn't about to start a pig sanctuary. 

I get you're mad, but you should ask yourself why. If it's for the well-being of the animals, carry on and fight the good fight. But if you feel icky because pigs raised to become pork, were turned into pork humanly and cleanly without burning to death, then I'll tend to disagree
