I have called to my People night and day: But my call only increases (their) flight (from the Right).

memes,ffioahz,t1_ffijt0s,1579978653.0,Good question! Every messenger had their miracle that Allah has given them to prove that they are Truly speaking the truth.

If a mere light admonition proves effective, there is no need to resort to a severer step. As for beating, the Holy Prophet allowed it very reluctantly and even then did not like it. But the fact is that there are certain women who do not mend their ways without a beating. In such a case, the Holy Prophet has instructed that she would not be beaten on the face or cruelly, or with anything which might leave a mark on the body.”"
