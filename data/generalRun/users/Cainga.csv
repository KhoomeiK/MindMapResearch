AdviceAnimals,ffangib,t1_ff94290,1579740070.0,That’s pretty bad and I never heard of any place that horrible. Ours is pretty bad too as being 1 min late adds points so you better not have car issues and be sick in the same 12 month stretch.
AdviceAnimals,ffan4jn,t1_ffa8d3j,1579739848.0,I think we will get that at some point in the US but a lot of people need to continue to get screwed and a lot of old people already enjoying the socialized Medicare need to die off.  And we probably need to fix gerrymandering too first.  So I may not get to enjoy it until I’m on Medicare anyways.

It should just be a rolling 12 trailing months. So you have 12 months from your first big expense to get all your expenses in."
AdviceAnimals,ff8xzh0,t1_ff8fg8n,1579699699.0,My company has a point system. So you get 2 sick/holidays a year to do as you please.  Then missing 1-3 days for sick cost you 1 point. Hit 7 and your fired but they roll off after 12 months. So you can have 8 different sick occurrences for a total of 20 days paid.

Oh maybe because you don’t want me to join the union as it’s bad for you. So if it’s bad for you then therefore it’s good for me. Thanks on my decision.

nfl,ff2sodl,t3_er4f4y,1579522469.0,I wanted the Titans to win the game because they deserved it after slaying the Pats and saving us all. And a bonus was taking out the Ravens as a Steeler fan.  I’m happy for KC though and hope they win the SB.
nfl,ff2sjzt,t1_ff2d2c2,1579522312.0,The article doesn’t explain why when they start has any effect on when the season finishes though. Why can’t the NFL just have the Super Bowl in mid February or early March?  The only think that effects scheduling during the season is the law not allowing them to play on the same day as high school or college but both of them are long into the off season by Early February.
nfl,ff2fuxw,t1_ff1np9m,1579504365.0,Yeah. Offense is the first line of defense as every yard/time of procession pushes the line of scrimmage backwards to the perspective of the other team.
nfl,ff2flg2,t1_ff295ba,1579504057.0,Actually I think it’s more than that as the league expanded number of teams and playoff spots since the early Super Bowls.

nfl,ff21sxa,t1_ff10bbz,1579491500.0,Titans were down quite a bit but a turnover at that point would keep them alive. I wouldn’t be surprised if they were told to focus on generating forced fumbles.

news,feq2ehi,t1_fepgi2v,1579336563.0,That’s not true. Worst case scenario if the government lets social security go to shit you’ll get 75-80% payout instead of 100%. So you still get the bulk of the money although a 25% pay cut still sucks.  It will most likely be higher and they’ll raise social security tax to increase revenues while decreasing or freezing payouts somewhat.

Every automobile on the other hand depreciates when bought new and eventually wears down and depreciates towards zero.  You can’t compare the two assets. Only houses that depreciate are ones that you don’t maintain and let the place fall apart."

Urgent care would have been so much cheaper but I went to the ER because there was a lot of blood coming from my head and urgent care wouldn’t be open for a couple hours. Turns out my injury wasn’t super bad and the wound stopped bleeding on its own but it’s hard to tell with hair in the way. 

Luckily for you ER was the correct choice.   It would be cool if we had a healthcare system where you just worry about treatment and not about where is the most cost effective choice or who will accept your insurance if you have any."

Turned out it was spontaneous pneumothorax (partial lung collapse) and I felt fine after an hour and needed no procedure. I was kept for observation for 2 days which sucked.

Lung had a small hole and air was trapped in chest cavity.  Lung healed itself and air eventually dispersed."

Just like how most America’s don’t have enough saved for retirement and the bulk of it is social security that the government forces them to do.  They weren’t going to leave a high paying coal job for an unknown green job.

The worst part is if the route is too light on passengers you get a very high % of poor that also typically has a higher rate of crime for their demographic.
