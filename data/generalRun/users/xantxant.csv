AskReddit,ff9zdva,t1_ff91ez4,1579724757.0,"Yes, but I think what is being revealed is that the tools in place are simply inadequate. If the US Constitution's safeguards on power were a software unit test, I'd call that about 30% coverage, almost useless for stopping bugs.

""Norms and traditions"" are what we've relied on, but those do nothing to stop people who see an opportunity to increase their own power, because norms aren't laws. Laws are almost useless too, as we can see when we try to convict the president of actual serious crimes, or try to convict corrupt cops of murder.

Perhaps in the 22nd century we'll see what happens when a set of serious anticorruption laws is tested against the next wave of fascism. Or perhaps we won't reach the 22nd century."

todayilearned,fc3sv2g,t1_fc3s0yf,1577397762.0,"The thesis implied by this title is ""westerners will only believe vegetarianism is an old idea if I use a reference to an incredibly obscure greek religious movement.""

The ideas of vegetarianism are FAR older than that, but Western history wants to ignore those ideas. You jumped into this thread to defend the Western angle of the title, and your defense makes no sense because it specifically excludes famous examples of the idea that are far older than Pythagoras.

Instead of pointing them out to exclude them, why not point them out to say ""this title is nonsense, nobody needs to learn about Pythagoras to believe that vegetarianism is old, they just need to look outside of a Western frame."""
todayilearned,fc3rqi1,t1_fc3rizl,1577396960.0,"You might ask yourself why that's the first religion you think of when someone mentions vegetarianism, then.

The religions you specifically excluded contain tenets of vegetarianism, and it's disingenuous to specifically exclude them.

Also, not for nothing: If I ask 100 white people around here in Oregon, I'll bet I find more who know about Jainism than the cult of Pythagoras."
AskReddit,fc3q99b,t1_fc3knxe,1577395920.0,"Consider, for example, a ""gray goo scenario"": self-replicating nanotechnology programmed (or evolved!) to break down everything it encounters and turn it into new nanobots. The scary sci fi scenario is that we invent this ourselves, and it turns the entire planet into grey goo, BUT

There is a theoretical possibility that this technology exists and aliens have already created it. Indeed, it might have destroyed them. Merely encountering it would probably be enough to bring it along.

The gray goo doesn't require that the infecting agent knows anything about the biology that it's infecting, because it's operating at the molecular level.

This is only the first thing I thought of off the top of my head.

Another one I've seen in fiction is that aliens want to kill other species for some reason (it doesn't really matter why), but can't **find** us because the universe is so vast. Showing up at their door might, all by itself, be enough for them to infer where we are and come to us."
