AskFoodHistorians,fc1pwao,t3_efnqs5,1577325975.0,"So, let's talk about the mid to late 1800s and American Xenophobia. The other commenter is right about the people in the Midwest mostly being from a Scandinavian and German background, although there are also a lot with Scottish and English heritage as well. None of those countries are known for using a ton of spices and herbs, but if you have ever tried a lot of traditional recipes from those regions, you will know that most are not really bland. They might have had some trouble finding traditional ingredients in their new Homeland, especially for some of the fermented fish recipes, but they still tried to cook foods that would be recognizable to their grandmothers back in the old country. They still used aromatics, just not as wide a variety. 

So, in the 1800s there were two big things that moved people towards eating bland food in the Midwest. The first was a little xenophobia. There were a lot of eastern and southern Europeans moving to the US at this time. The paler, and more importantly Protestant, descendants of English and German settlers looked at these new comers as sensual slaves to the pope and to their own bodies. Prejudice against Italians was high on the east coast, and that extended to the way they cooked. Highly spiced dishes were thought of as unrefined and likely to heat the blood too much.

The next and arguably bigger deal was a religious movement that swept the nation in the 1800s. People were going to revivals constantly to renew their faith. These preachers were very strict about the pleasures of the flesh. They weren't very keen on any pleasures outside of reading the Bible and occasionally having children. Food was a big deal for these people. Several of the religious sects that showed up after the great disappointment in 1844 (the Seventh Day Adventists being the largest and longest lasting) had tons of guidelines about what to eat. 

Ellen White the prophet of the Adventist Church declared even black pepper to be bad for you as she considered it an irritant. She recommended a vegan diet with very few spices. She believed that animal products, tea, coffee, powerful spices, and basically anything other than seeds, beans, and fruit, would be both physically and emotionally unhealthy.

John Harvey Kellogg, another Adventist, also advocated lots of bland foods, mostly whole grains and plain yogurt. He invented the first breakfast cereal as a bland sort of grain bar that shattered into little flakes in the oven. He even recommend yogurt enemas, though sadly this practice did not catch on in the Midwest at large nearly as well as extremely bland cereal did. 

The inventor of the Graham cracker made it bland on purpose as well. Even the boy scouts highly recommended that initiates eat bland foods. It is often reported that this was because they believed that eating foods with lots of spices and flavorings would heat up the blood and increase the desire to masturbate. 

Basically, all of these strange extremely Protestant religious movements swept through the Midwest for the better part of 100 years preaching anti worldly pleasure messages and telling everyone bland foods were the best thing you could eat as spiced ones might make you do something disreputable (like all those dirty Catholics). This caused the already lightly spiced dishes these people were eating to become not spiced at all."
