We were married 6 hours yet I was responsible for paying back nearly $8,000 in subsidized healthcare because now we made too much for subsidized healthcare. Tax laws can be a bitch. To be fair, I'm a lazy son of a bitch and paid turbo tax to do my taxes, and probably could have found a way around it, but filing jointly still gave me the best refund per turbo tax no matter how many ways I tried to file."

Part of the merger deal between Westar and KCPL was they could not raise rates or apply for a new rate case until 2023. This deal was made to convince the KCC that the merger was in the best interest of the rate payer."

My wife washes hers off with soap in the bathtub and then puts it in the dishwasher, which kind of grossed me out at first, but then realized I sometimes put dishes I'm too lazy to wash off in there with raw chicken, beef, pork, fish, etc. blood on them. Long story short, a washed silicone cup probably isn't the grossest thing I put in my dishwasher, so it's a viable solution. 

I'm sure it is sterile, but still kinda gross to put it in the tea kettle."

Panama,fdrzd9p,t3_emufna,1578691957.0,"I went to Gamboa for my honeymoon the day after the festival in 2019 (by consequence, I didn't know about the festival at all). The dumpsters full of trash and the portapotties smelled terrible. I wondered why there weren't many mosquitoes or flying insects around, but the fumigation explains it. There was some litter but nothing else seemed destroyed. Surprising lack of ""el gato solo?"" (my Spanish is rusty) and other wildlife my wife expected to see. We still had a great week there, but were disappointed to not see as much wildlife as we expected, even when we went on hikes into the forest. The most we saw was on a boat ride that took us a few miles up the canal and into the little coves and streams that feed into the canal.

This video has the stuff in an area I don't remember from last year, so I'm blanking, or they must have expanded it quite a bit, or moved it away from the main resort. It'd be disappointed if the cleared forest to make more room. If i remember correctly, the resort is on an old golf course and there's tons of ground already cleared where the course used to be to the south and east of the resort. When I was there the festival was to the north and east of the resort. 

Driving around the outskirts of Panama City and on the way to Gamboa was kind of disheartening, lots of rainforest was getting clear cut and leveled. My wife's family was out there protesting the deforestation with out permits frequently. They don't really enforce the laws protecting the rainforest."

Since then I've convinced my wife and mother to both get Subarus and they love theirs. I've driven Subarus almost everywhere in the USA in every type of weather and can't reccomend them enough. 

Maintenance is high on them, but I drive 96 miles per day compared to your four, so you shouldn't feel those costs nearly as much. Every major issue I've had they have fixed for free (including a new engine at 96,000 miles) under recall or it was something that was messed up (engineering flaw - the engine) on all the cars.
