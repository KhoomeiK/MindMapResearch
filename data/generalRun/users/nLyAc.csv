LAlist,ffd8hlp,t3_esp8wo,1579815479.0,"Sounded like a scam immediately. Moving to Spain for a few years...leases don't last for ""a few years"" so I would immediately question 1) how she can sublet with no lease, 2) why she wouldn't put me in contact with the landlord given that she would be out of the country for years, 3) who actually would want the hassle of subletting an apartment they don't own for years while they are in another country (what if someone moves out, what if they stop paying rent...she wouldn't be able to do much from Spain.)  As many others have said, not being able to see the place is a big no.

*I'm assuming she wasn't claiming to own the place because if she did she wouldn't have to ""give up the apartment"""
WatchPeopleDieInside,fd6vuhi,t1_fd6t8rs,1578196373.0,No.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fd6bfws,t1_fd663ta,1578188413.0,You can also Google black women and microaggressions and this is one you'll see every time. Read more into it and you'll see it's a complex issue and not as simple as just saying no to anyone who asks (if they did give the courtesy of asking first)
WatchPeopleDieInside,fd6b13z,t1_fd663ta,1578188237.0,"Maybe you should piss off with this lame comment. She knows the experience of the black woman well and this type of microaggression is a well known issue in our community. She is reading her body language and quite frankly I agree that she seems a bit uncomfortable and we can recognize it because many of us have been in the exact same position. Could she be interpreting it wrong, absolutely. But you missed her point, which was that just because a black woman gives permission, doesn't mean she's not uncomfortable with it. Workplace dynamics and politics are a thing"
WatchPeopleDieInside,fd6a6e8,t1_fd5zqmr,1578187871.0,"Who turned it into drama? The OP of the comment you're responding to is just having a flashback type moment because she knows that discomfort when you are in the workplace and people want to touch your hair (whether they have asked or not). Her comment also didn't express outrage. So...????

And just as a side note...even if someone gives permission doesn't necessarily mean they are comfortable. Like OP said, some black women feel stuck because they do not want their reaction to be taken personally...especially in the workplace. My friend once was asked by her boss if she could touch her hair, and it caught her off guard and she didn't want to but said yes because it was an awkward moment and she didn't want her boss to take it personally. Immediately after she said yes she regretted it and I had to coach her through how she can go back to her boss and discuss it. She wishes she had been braver and prepared with the right thing to say in the moment but not everyone has that courage or ability to think of the right thing to say on the spot. Some black people still are afraid of upsetting their white coworkers and bosses or it turning into a scene or interrogation if they say no."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcpgwy0,t1_fcpeqwh,1577863521.0,"What? Claim and sanction? No her trust issues and her not believing him is an issue between the two of them. They obviously have some prior issues. That does not warrant contacting and rudely confronting a stranger with absolutely no proof of anything. That is irrational behavior. If she has that little trust in him then she should not have married him. Listen I'm not trying to start a fight with you so not sure why your response is so hostile. She probably did experience some harsh cheating and betrayal situations...in fact, I acknowledge that is probably the case. That does not make it ok to just start contacting and confronting any stranger who she suspects might be seeing her husband. It's coming from a place of pain I'm sure, but that does not make it ok. It's not healthy and it turns into situations exactly like this one where she ruined her own surprise. That's my opinion and you are free to have your own. Chill out."
Wakandapeopletwitter,fcns8k4,t1_fcnmpum,1577817433.0,"People in the comments of the tweet posted some ads for curly hair products and they were mostly white/light women with Type 3 hair. Someone also mentioned exactly what you said, that people don't see 4C hair as beautiful unless it's a big, thick afro."
aww,fcni1yh,t1_fcnhxxe,1577812138.0,Agreed!
Wakandapeopletwitter,fcngpsy,t1_fcnf2t1,1577811357.0,"Ok I went to the comments on the actual tweet. OP of that tweet said it's the ""lack of coverage in brand marketing, pages meant to celebrate natural hair, and products which fail to cater to our hair"" and basically 4a/4b folks claiming they have 4c hair which dilutes content.

I haven't been natural long enough to know whether this is true or not. I do think all the pages meant to tell you your hair type are confusing as hell so the latter part might be true."
Wakandapeopletwitter,fcn9j52,t3_ei2h77,1577806726.0,Serious Q (from someone who has only been natural for the last 6 months): how were those with 4C hair pushed out of the movement?
insanepeoplefacebook,fcmw9wo,t1_fcmvo3u,1577795167.0,"Yeah but that's a problem between her and her husband. Confronting a stranger without any actually proof of anything is not justified.  If she really just wanted to find out the truth, that is not the way to handle it. I hate to admit this but I've been in that position before (many years ago) and I did call the woman I was suspicious of. However, I spoke to her respectfully from the beginning because 1) I had no actual proof of anything and 2) you catch more flies with honey. I told her who I was, who my bf was, and I told her why I was suspicious and asked her if anything was going on. She was actually really nice and we had a whole conversation. I thanked her and said sorry for bothering her. She said ""no problem I understand and you didn't come at me wrong or anything so it's all good."" I am sure if I had called and just started off with ""how do you know my man??"" and then called her a bitch, she would have reacted very differently."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcmu0i2,t1_fclvmkl,1577792214.0,"She messaged a stranger our if the blue without any greeting, explanation, or identification of the husband. Then called her a bitch. she obviously was not messaging a business page or contacting her regarding any business inquiry. The woman didn't even identify who her husband was until after she called her a bitch. She doesn't owe her a professional courtesy because she wasn't a customer and was not contacting her regarding the business. She clearly didn't even know the woman was a baker. Bottom line, you don't call or message strangers to confront them like this. It's obvious she already had her mind made up that her husband was up to something nefarious. That's exactly why she didn't approach her in a manner that would actually get the information she was seeking without being confrontational. She was being irrational because her husband is probably trash and cheats on her regularly."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcmthf6,t1_fcmhj53,1577791479.0,She was not messaging her on a business page and did not even know the woman was a baker. She obviously messaged this woman on a personal page. (otherwise she would have been able to put two and two together regarding the cake tag.) How do you figure people owe a professional courtesy to someone who is 1) not a customer and 2) not contacting her regarding her business? This is personal.
insanepeoplefacebook,fcmta64,t1_fcmgxpl,1577791196.0,All signs point to the obvious...this jealous woman was not messaging this woman on a business page. It's clear this woman did not know the person she was messaging is a baker. The baker does not owe someone professional courtesy who confronts them and then calls them out their name. She does not owe that woman patience.
insanepeoplefacebook,fcmt15l,t1_fcmhf7t,1577790843.0,"It is an affront to send an stranger a message without any greeting, explanation, or identification of the husband. That woman already had her mind made up that her husband was up to no good with this other woman, and confronted a complete stranger in a manner that was not appropriate. It wasn't just about the double question mark. It's the whole approach. And then to call the woman a bitch for asking who she is referring to. That's another clue that she already had her mind made up about what was going on. Didn't feel bad for her because that is absolutely not how you approach that situation."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcmsirl,t1_fcm8rrf,1577790118.0,"I'm guessing it's probably not a business page or the wife could have put two and two together re: the cake tag. I'm also willing to bet this is a home baker who runs a small business through referrals or social media. But either way, I would also be on the defensive if a random person messaged me (and not even in a polite way) without so much as a greeting or explanation or even identifying who the husband is. Then to follow up by cursing at me. I would have also cursed her out. Maybe not that graphically but I definitely would respond in kind. She does not owe that woman anything."

Whatcouldgowrong,fc6ut6p,t1_fc6mxrp,1577490057.0,Ok I googled it and was not a DUI. Driver was cited for failure to maintain lane...which is kinda vague. So who knows.
Whatcouldgowrong,fc6u2zz,t1_fc6mxrp,1577489520.0,OP got this from the homeowner's IG post. There are a bunch of comments speculating. And people think they see the phone fall out of her hand onto the dash.  I don't think it has been confirmed the reason. But I doubt that was her phone falling out of her hand there. With the impact of that crash I can't believe she would be able to hold onto it.
