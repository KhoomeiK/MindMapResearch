Empaths,ff6gjir,t3_ersmm3,1579626719.0,"Are they egotistical or are you egotistical? Nobody owes you their story. If you have a high degree if empathy, that’s ur crap, not theirs. You have to learn how to deal with your own need to act on your empathic feelings. All humans experience suffering, but we only talk about the stuff that we think there could be a solution to....otherwise we distract ourselves with politics and shallow topics."

PeakyBlinders,fdbwe6a,t1_fd17628,1578262860.0,"Certainly makes one realize how sneaky and subtle toxic relationships can be. If someone were to see lizzie in real life, they would say “he almost got you raped. Leave. You dont deserve that, he’s a criminal who should be in jail.”

And yet like a battered woman, so many of us are addicted to the notion that something good and redemptive might come of the relationship.

Fortunately, the show is a work of fiction and there is the possibility of redemption. In real life, there hardly is such a thing."

socialwork,fcnytuv,t3_ehvcoi,1577821063.0,"I don't frequent this sub often, and thus I haven't seen many negative comments about online programs. I would say that where I'm from, the majority of social workers I know completed their education online. It really just makes more sense...you learn more on the job than being on campus, and doing an online program means you can still have income coming in without having to pay for living in a big city. If I were to complete an MSW in the city, I'd be thousands down the hole and that's not really beneficial to me at this point in time. I also find that the people in online graduate courses seem to be more mature anyways, and most are working so there's still that same richness of discussion and dialogue."
socialwork,fcnybvo,t1_fcna4lg,1577820808.0,"hey! someone from uvic! i'm going to piggyback off this comment and ask something mildly related because i'm interested in UVIC - do any students in the MSW program at UVIC get macro practicums in research or policy? if so, any ideas where people have been placed before?"
offmychest,fcm4uys,t3_ehobx5,1577764288.0,"Your friend seems to be struggling against her partner’s manipulation and therefore, you need to step it up. Nobody likes being in your position but im guessing the abuse already has damaged her children (and her) significantly. By not calling, you would be ignoring your friend & her children at the time when they need you most❤️. It’s the right decision. Even if your friend wanted to stay with her partner, her children cannot and should not be put in that situation. You are a lovely human for doing the difficult but right thing. Every night you wait to call is another night those children could be seriously, seriously injured or harmed. Get em out. Sending so much love xx"

PeakyBlinders,fcbt2ul,t3_efbuxb,1577590660.0,"I don’t know that it’s anything specific that we can diagnose based on what we know as viewers. I would assume in general, he’d be referring to some sort of trauma, suicidality, depression etc. I think the point of that commentary was to show the intergenerational struggles of his family and give a little backstory to tommy."

offmychest,fc60sd6,t1_fc5ziib,1577469728.0,"Being diagnosed with psychopathy isn’t a choice but choosing to effectively manage symptoms and access treatment is. 

There are psychopaths that meet with mental health professionals regularly because they know they are apt to committing harm, logically know this is bad, and therefore want to reduce harm. Based on the posting above it does not appear as though this individual was interested in this type of support.

Of course there are always systemic failures, such as him only being committed long term after doing a major crime, but responsibility falls between him and the system."
offmychest,fc5x14m,t1_fc5b6ck,1577467682.0,"Nah trauma and addiction don’t always go hand in hand. This guy just sounds like he has major mental illness or is a psychopath....most heroin addicts have enough of a conscience to not do most the things he did. Most dont sell drugs to teenagers, harm animals and murder innocent bystanders. The demons inside his soul didn’t win the war, he chose to become a demon himself. 

I’m so sorry OP ❤️. You are a trooper having to endure his presence all these years. There is nothing more your family could have done to help him, or to prevent harm. Focus on rebuilding yourselves and your family now that the storm has halted."
