Zeus, the beagle, has it very hard when he smells females in heat, he just goes crazy, attacks other males and I can't unleash him at the park, so it's horrible for him, but my SO doesn't want him neutered. I'm lucky there's a small dog park near my home that's always empty because it's small and ugly and there I can unleash him when heat season is all over, otherwise he would be a very unhappy dog.

Kiba, our little precios mutt, is the very same goofy, happy and playful dog as he was when he was not neutered, and no, he didn't look for his little balls and he didn't care that they're not there, he can be unleashed at any time, he doesn't suffer when females are in heat and is, overall, a very happy dog."

This might sound hard, but I just refused to give him any other food for 3 days, at 4th he was eating like a champ all his dry food.

No dog would let itself starve to death unless is sick or in pain, so don't hesitate to keep the food for him until he accepts to eat, so far, he's getting what he wants, wich is you hand-feeding him.

If he stays more than 3 days without eating, I would try other vet as there might be underlying issues that your current vet can't/won't see, but 2-3 days won't affect your dog at all."

To keep professional clothes free from dog hair, we don't let them enter our bedroom, so little to no hair gets there. They're also only allowed on the couch under certain circumstances and I have covers for it.

2- For the barking issue, you will have to work with her, reward when he doesn't react and correct when she barks at something, probably someone with better trainning skills than me will be more helpful here, I have no problems with mine as none of them reacts to any sound while at home."

Every time I take them to the groomer, Zeus makes an scene just after crossing the door, but as soon as I'm gone, he's OK. And when I come back to get them both, Zeus barks at me as it's the end of the world, he doesn't growl, he's just mad that I've left him there.

If I'm going to make dinner later than our usual time, he barks and goes back and forth between the kitchen and I. And he doesn't even eats human food! (they're not allowed, only ocasional treats)

Whenever he's on the couch or on the bed and I make him get out, he makes noises, like an old grumpy man, mumblig until he finds another comfy spot.

If I let them alone at home when I'm not supposed to, he doesn't bark, but he looks for something mine to break it. Something mine or paper, so he can tear it and leave it all around, then, when I come back, he doesn't even get up to say hi until I get to him.

We let the dog roam almost freely, when he was as far as the long leash allowed him, we called him back and offered a treat. At first, treats were given every single time, then we started to give them just sometimes. Once he started coming back without a treat, we moved to train nearby other dogs.

It's really a matter of patience and repetition, some dogs take longer that others, our beagle is still training, because he attacks other dogs, but our border collie mix just needed a couple of sessions to get what we wanted and even though he needs to say hi to every dog, he comes as soon as I call him now.

dogs,fdpwnp1,t3_emfzny,1578643611.0,"I have 2 dogs: Zeus, a 3 and a half years old beagle and Kiba, a 1 year old border collie mix.

Zeus is a reactive dog, he doesn't allow other male dogs around unless he knows them, but one day, the local shelter called me (I know a lot of volunteers there) and asked me if I could help with some puppies, some just days old puppies. They couldn't go to the shelter because they were too small and they need constant attention and bottle feeding.

Since I have enough space to keep them separated from Zeus, I said yes. So little fluff balls started coming home.

First ot was a little one we called Saori. The first thing Zeus did when she started crying was come and look for me, he always come for me when the baby cried. When Saori was big enough to walk and try to play, Zeus became her playground. My big bad boy turned into a soft plush to make that puppy happy!

But Saori got adopted and les than a month later we had new abandoned puppies, this time a litter of 8.

2 of them came home, brother and sister, bottle feeding both of them was a little nightmare at first, they were so small and malnourished that the female puked everything and the male just took a few sips and stop. But they started to grow up and got stronger, Zeus spent all of his time besides the enclosure I had for the puppies to watch them.

The first time they both went out to start playing, Zeus laid down and let them munch his ears, he had puppies as earrings! The big bad dominant dog was again being a playground for puppies. He rolled over his back, exposing his belly and let the little ones climb all over him and they even bite his private parts, he did nothing but a little surprised roll over, being careful to not hurt any baby.

The female got adopted and both Zeus the Destroyer (that's what I call him) and my SO bonded a lot with the puppy left, so we named him Kiba and he stayed with us.

We've had more foster babies, all bottle fed, and Zeus, that doesn't hesitate in attack any stranger dog founds in his dominion, is the most loving, caring, playful and adorable foster father I've ever seen. I could have imagined that in the case he was a female, but my here-I-am-get-out-of-my-sight-or-I'll-kill-you dog loves puppies and does anything to make them safe and happy."

beagle,fdmtxbj,t3_em7cv3,1578565613.0,"Patience, lots of it. They're smart but sttuborn (at least mine is and all of the other ones I know are). 

They're very food driven so treats will help you a lot. Our trainer told me to use sausages, the cheap ones, cut in tiny slices and use just a quarter of that slice, that's enough to keep my beagle's attention.

Mine used to eat like a vacuum, food only lasted like 10 seconds, so I made him eat with my hand in his bowl, he had to avoid my fingers and got used to me handling his food and touching his mouth when he's eating, so now I can take whatever I want from his mouth.

The trainer also told us to use a very long leash, a 5m / 16ft one, we used that to train come and stop comands, the dog feels like he's unleashed but you have plenty of leash to catch it before he can escapes.

For potty training I was lucky that I work from home, so it was easy: dogs eats, 15 min and go potty; plays, potty right after you finish; takes a nap, potty right when he wakes; drinks, about 10 min after he's done go potty. And I carried him until we reached teh place where he's alowed to go potty, at 3 months old he was asking to go out almost every time he needed to go.

We don't use crates here in Spain, but my dogs always sleep on their own, because my SO is a little allergic to them (nothing too bad, it's manageable as long as we keep both dogs away from bed and controlled couch time). To train them to that, we just made them very tired before going to sleep when they were puppies, so they just fell on their bed like dead. Zeus, the beagle, used to wake very early in the morning at first,  so I just got up, took his bed besides the couch, let him cuddle with my hand and we both slept until it was time to wake up.

Other than that, your best friend is patience and repeat and make sure that everyone that needs to handle the dog knows the key words you're using, so the little one is not confused."

MakeupAddiction,fckl5cv,t1_fckjuzx,1577727712.0,"Same here, red is my all times favorite lipstick color and I think I have all the reds JSC has, plus a shit ton of other red lipsticks from several brands on all finishes you can think of :P"
dogs,fckkjw2,t3_ehoag7,1577727342.0,"Through the years I've had a lot of dogs and the puppy that was more into bitting was my beagle Zeus, I still have some scars from his baby teeth and he's almost 4 years old now.

Puppies bite, a lot, and for them it's just play, they just can't control their strength and their baby teeth are sharp as needles, our skin is much more thin than theirs so they truly don't realize they're hurting you.

Do as being suggested here by several people: high pitch scream and quit the play, spanking won't do anything as they can't recognize that as a proper ""no"". Leaving him with no play is the worst punishment so he'll learn quickly to not bite you so strong."
Vaping,fcdvbrv,t3_eh2tga,1577614217.0,"I think it's better if you ask for a certain country, I use [vapo.es](https://vapo.es), but they don't send anywhere outside Spain.

There are several brands made in europe and I know that there are a lot of e-stores in Europe, but shipping costs from country to country can be a pain in the ass, so ordering from the country you're in should be better :P"
Vaping,fcau3l5,t1_fc9r6qr,1577576639.0,"There was a very good offer, just 22€ (around 20$) so I jumped in. I wasn't sure I was going to like it, but I didn't want to try with one of those very cheap and very bad mods, so the Target Mini at that price was irresistible :P"

dogs,fc6cibt,t3_eg6lqm,1577477360.0,"From my own experience taking care of abandoned puppies, you're going to do a lot of cleansing. Even though you rub their bellies and anal region, they're going to pee and poo everytime they need to, there's no magic trick. 

I used to keep puppies on a little enclosure with absorbing pads and some heating pads underneath to keep them warm. As they start to walk and move more, they'll go relieve themselves away from the others.

Enjoy them and keep doing such a great job!"
beagle,fc6a2g4,t3_efp2rm,1577475743.0,"This is what puppies do to make milk come out from their moms, they suck and knead. As u/dcr61288 said, when they're taken away from their moms too soon they do this to comfort themselves.

I've bottle feed many puppies and they all did that to my hands :P"

Vaping,fbdalal,t3_ecqc0y,1576755146.0,"Not sure if it's because I'm in Spain or because I use a little pod device (but it brings out a much bigger cloud than any cigarrette) but I've never experienced even a bad stare at me because of vaping.   
And it's not usual where I live to see anyone vaping, it's a small city, I've probably encountered 2 or 3 people vaping so far.

Only bad interactions come from family, but they're slowly learning :P"
