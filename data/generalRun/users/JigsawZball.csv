SingleParents,ffdnvlh,t3_esfq1z,1579824869.0,"My ex is totally disconnected from our child. I ask myself the same question- how can he live in a world knowing that he can’t see his child on a daily basis? I could never do that.

My ex is all about himself. He blames everyone for his mistakes. He lacks empathy. He has “trouble” remembering the true events of the past. These people don’t bond like normal human beings. They don’t “feel” like normal human beings. They live in a world of their own where they don’t have to put “effort” into things. I
Imagine it’s “doable” for them because they don’t feel the way we do. That’s really the bottom line. It’s truly mind boggling to me as well. 

We get to live knowing that there is no way someone can give up his/her child and ever truly be happy. That’s not true happiness. 
Us? We keep putting in the work and we’ll be rewarded with hugs, smiles and declarations of love. We win in the end."

Divorce,ffcgzdr,t3_esur79,1579799254.0,Work around his schedule. Try to be out of the house or in your room when he is around. Pack up/ dispose of the things you can without his input. I packed up an entire house without my ex. Was I pissed? Yes. But I had to put those feelings aside to get moving physically and emotionally. I knew the sooner I got stuff put away the sooner my new reality would come. Bonus- it gives you something else to focus on. I had a girlfriend help with the photos so I didn’t have to deal/look at them.

If the person lives out of state, be very specific with the schedule. Even down to a deadline as to when the weeks are chosen. Think of transportation as well. My ex has to pay for 6 plane tickets if he wants to take our daughter to his home for a visit- he chose it. Think carefully."
Divorce,ff3vziu,t3_eri6c0,1579550057.0,"You’re caught between a rock and a hard place. You obviously have your daughter’s best interest at heart. You want her to be comfortable. Unfortunately, her father doesn’t feel the same way. Not that he doesn’t want her to be comfortable...his priorities are just not the same at the moment. Welcome to the crap shoot of co-parenting.

I would say talk to him and explain how she feels. However, more than likely he will probably think you are trying to prevent her from spending time with him etc. Will she be comfortable talking to him? You can offer alternate arrangements such as letting her spend the day but not the night. I would also be concerned with the influence of the older child as well but that conversation will not go over well (see husband’s priorities).

My ex is about to marry his mistress. He wants our daughter there. She does not want to go. She has told him twice in two separate phone conversations that she will feel uncomfortable. He continues to badger her. Maybe he’s waiting for a reason that is more acceptable to him. Who knows? Point being, she is now prepared to tell him that if he insists she goes, he is going to have to physically pick her up and put her on the plane. She is 12. This too will not end well. But I, like you, refuse to have her placed in a situation where she will be uncomfortable.

The sad part is your daughter will more than likely always remember how horrible this situation was. She won’t remember he tried to spend time with her. It’s more sad that he can’t see this. Good luck."

No one is ever ready for this. As cliche as it sounds, you just have to do it. My one advice is to take a deep breath and don’t be an asshole about it.

Start filling your life with people and things that will help you heal and move on. Go no contact with these people. It truly will get better. Healing is a process, not a race- it takes time.

I know...my mind is pretty blown that I actually feel this way.

I will never however, want him in my life again. I continue to be saddened by the fact that he chose to shove his daughter and I off a cliff to get what he wanted. But in my heart I know that a man like that will never ever know true happiness. You can’t have a child out in the world who wants nothing to do with you and know true happiness.

I was in the middle of a lesson. I didn’t have time to consult a flowchart to figure out the next step!

It’s all politics. Schools are frowned upon and given a bad reputation for having too many referrals. So students who behave badly are given a slap on the wrist and told not to do it again all in avoidance of a referral. Meanwhile, the behavior persists and in some cases escalates."

It’s no longer just the two of you. You are a parent now. Your child is going to look at you as a role model. You need to fortify yourself and be strong. You can get the OurFamilyWizard app. It is a parenting app that allows you to input your child’s schedule so you both can see it. I understand that right now he’s not interested but start researching so that you are prepared if/when the time comes.

You need to have some sort of schedule. Wishing and hoping he won’t be around is not a sensible plan. Set boundaries and be firm.

Are you ok with him having a relationship with this child, knowing what a constant reminder of the affair this child will represent to you?

Divorce,feefhd0,t3_eoolj7,1579032682.0,"I moved out of state from the non custodial parent. I needed his permission to do so because by law, I was only allowed to move a certain distance. I moved 900+ miles away. He said as long as I promised not to touch his 401K, he would give me permission to take her. 

Obviously the courts okayed  it (NYC). As far as his relationship with his child, he didn’t have one. He never made her a priority in his life. I am going to say that’s why it was ok for him to let her go. As of today, their relationship still remains mostly nonexistent. He’s seen her 3 times in 2 and a half years. He calls her once every 4-6 weeks for a 2 minute conversation. 

She’s vowed that as soon as she’s legally allowed to, she’s cutting off all contact with him. I didn’t have to say or do anything to sabotage their relationship. He pretty much did a bang up job on his own...

BTW...he very conveniently “forgot” about the fact that he gave permission to sell his daughter for his 401K.

Once I was able to go no contact, that took away any of what you’re currently feeling. You’re still feeling vulnerable and that’s ok because this takes time.

It’s also scary to think of a future where you have to start all over. It’s exhausting to both the mind and heart to imagine putting ourselves out there to be vulnerable to someone else, without any guarantee of a happy ending. But hey, we didn’t have one the first time around. I can’t imagine going through this with someone else. So we cling on to “our person” but is it really the person or the idea?

Why can’t you forgive them because they said they were sorry? Why can’t we just put it behind us and move on?

In order to grieve you have to feel. You have to be able to reflect. You have to have empathy. Cheaters are narcissists and sociopaths. They are incapable of having those feelings.

The thing I learned about a broken marriage is that the person who is leaving gets the advantage in so many ways. By the time he gets around to telling you he’s leaving, he no longer loves you, you’re worthless, there’s a 50% chance he’ll stay in the marriage and a 50% chance he’ll leave ( those were the odds I was working with). By the time he gets around to saying those things...he’s moved on. The discard to you is brutal. It’s like a gut punch to the stomach and you fall to the floor in the fetal position. He calmly walks right over you to continue his new, shiny life. While our brain understands this is not a person we want to love, our stupid fucking heart says something else. How do we reconcile the two?

Only time affords us this. Time and filling our live with people who love us, despite our flaws. That quilt is a symbol.

However, for me there is also the fact that this is a person who had to know that his actions would affect you.

It has long lasting repercussions and consequences. 

What you and your mum are living through right now is one of the consequences. The cheater has been caught yet again. Instead of taking onus, he chooses to blameshift and gaslight. Is this what you consider a role model? These are not the actions of someone you want to emulate. 

Please have some compassion for your mum. Her heart is broken yet again. You need not take sides ( although I personally think you should) but you can be supportive of her to want out.

It’s near impossible to co-parent with a narcissist. Cheaters are narcissists. Why is he pissed at you? Because he feels he’s entitled to because you’re not the boss of him. After all, I’m pretty sure that according to him, you drove him to cheat on you because you didn’t meet his needs. Same story. Different cheater.

Third, if you know for sure that you’ve done all you can to save your marriage, then what else can you do? You can’t get blood from a stone.
