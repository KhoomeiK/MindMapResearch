aww,ff9prna,t1_ff6kum8,1579718224.0,"It's very sad that more vets aren't educated in behavior. Telling people to keep their dogs home until they've had all their shots is very harmful. I tell my clients to carry their dogs, use a stroller, or take them around in their cat. And discuss this with their vet. It's a statement supporting socialization before shots are finished, from the Avma's own Behavior Association.

Start socializing your puppy now, because the socialization window closes at 16 weeks. And socialization means exposure to more than just other dogs and people. It's exposure in a positive, gentle way (with treats) to sounds, environments, experiences, grooming and more.

Here's a great video about socialization from That Dog Geek https://youtu.be/qPGd7ElMCJ8

Dogs communicate with each other through body language. They can learn what words mean, but it's not easy. They understand human body language much better. That's why hand signals are easier for them to understand than verbal cues.

Think about it. If you say Come Doggie the same way very time, but one day say it at a different pitch, goinf up instead of down, they may not come. You switch back to the usual way of saying it and they understand.

Dogs are constantly watching us, studying our movements. Putting shoes on at a certain time means a walk. Yawning when it's dark means bedtime is coming. Throughout their livwa they rely more on watching us than listening to us.

Even when we talk to them, they're still watching our body language. A deaf dog still knows you're communicating with him or her. And they can always learn hand signals. 

So OP, please don't worry about your dog. Going deaf isn't as hard for dogs as it is for humans. 

LPT: teach your dog hand signals before they go deaf. It will come in handy if they do."

Dogtraining,fe44o6f,t3_enr0hm,1578855738.0,"So sorry you're going through this.

I would definitely keep the dog inside unless the vets tell you otherwise. Ash is not safe for humans, I'm sure it's not safe for dogs.

Set up a 'potty' area. It would be great if you have a room that you don't use much that you can use just for this. Maybe a garage, or laundry room.

Does the dog wear a leash when s/he goes out to pee /poo? If so, put it on when you're going to, in effect, take it for a walk.

Try it first thing in the morning, when your dog definitely has to go. You can leave the dog in that area, or play with him/her in there until he goes.

It will be hard at first. If the dog goes to go right away, feed the dog and give water. More play, or nap the potty area. Leash back on and go in to the potty area. (oh, newspaper on the floor to soak it up)

Do you ever say something when your dog goes potty? Like Hurry Up? Say it once (only once) when your dog goes into the potty area.

Your dog will have to go eventually. S/he may cry, wanting to go outside, and that really hurts. But eventually she will go.

Now is the important part. Even if she doesn't go in the designated space, don't get mad, stay quiet, until she's done. Say ""good girl"" then give her a delicious treat. A piece of meat will be great.

She shouldn't have free run of the home until she's peed or pooped so she won't have an accident where you don't want her to. Block off any important rooms.

Don't worry about house training her again later. This is what you need now. She will be happy to go outside when this is over. And if she has a few accidents, come back here for more help.

Good luck, I hope you and your family (and your dog) get through this okay."

aww,fdlsx42,t1_fdlhxek,1578531728.0,"Dogs communicate to each other through body language. 

They don't understand human speech. We have to teach them to understand a few words.

Then they have to pay attention to those words, after tuning out all the other words we've been using all day.

Meanwhile, dogs spend their whole life watching us. Are we heading towards theie food bowl? Are we going to pick up their leash?

Body movements will always be easier for them to understand.

While I'm here, how to teach hand signals :

1. Give the verbal cue first, then the hand signal. Not at the same time.
2. Repeat. Over and over again.
3. In a few weeks (depending on the dog) go to the place you usually practice. Wait for the dog to get in position. Give the hand signal.

If the dog responds, yay, you did it. Keep training with the hand signal alone for a few weeks. Then take turns, a few days with the verbal cue, a few with the hand signal. Then try back and forth.

If the dog didn't respond to the hand signal, go back to saying the verbal cue followed by the hand signal for another week (or more). Then try again.

nonononoyes,fd30ssf,t1_fd1wq39,1578153685.0,"LPT: one of the things we teach children to be safe around dogs is called Be A Tree. Stand still and don't run. Running can trigger prey drive, the impulse to chase. Even if the dog wasn't thinking of chasing a kid.

The dogs in the video do not appear aggressive. If they were, they wouldn't have been stopped by a small child, they would have continued the attack.

It's our natural impulses to run, but the best thing you can do is to stand still, and don't look at the dog. Keep your body sideways. Most aggression is fear based. When you don't look like a threat, they won't be afraid, and will leave. If you don't run, they won't chase you.

This is true in most cases. I can't predict what will happen to you, but without being there, this is the best advice I can give you to keep you safe.

The only reason I'm writing all of this is on the odd chance someone who reads it happens to be in the same situation as these children. I hope this knowledge helps them."
