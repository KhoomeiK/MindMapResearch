I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre requirements aren‚Äôt similar to mine for Satisfactory Academic Progress. If it is similar you should be able to make an appeal and get aid back, then you can go from there."
college,fef8y01,t3_eo50o7,1579050981.0,"Last semester I was at school for 9hours everyday. It sucked but I would bring a lot of busy work. I was there from 8:30am-5:30pm. In between classes I would go to the library to study or take a nap, I‚Äôd also prep food so I wouldn‚Äôt starve. I worked right after classes but since I work on campus, I never left. It is very doable but I‚Äôd be careful not to take on more than what you have going on for the 10hour days."
college,fef8mrq,t3_eouk9x,1579050775.0,"At my college and most colleges you earn work study like a paycheck. So, unless you want a second job it doesn‚Äôt make sense. Also, the 2,000 is just how much money you can work towards getting. Say if you got a job and made around 1,900$, you‚Äôd have to appeal for more money since you are running out of your allotted work study funds.

Hope that makes sense, I have work study at the financial aid office at my college and we process work study forms."
college,fdhjiu3,t3_elcmhp,1578423981.0,"I was working 2 part time jobs for about a month while doing 15 credit hours. I couldn‚Äôt keep up with it and had to quit one of them. Studies are much more important, I even took out a loan. I feel better doing that and getting grades rather than having fatigue all day."

cats,fcn15q9,t1_fcn0yvw,1577800262.0,I have tried knocking on the car and such but I‚Äôll try the honking if what I‚Äôm doing doesn‚Äôt work. I have to drive my car later today and I‚Äôd rather get the cat in my house than on the streets.
cats,fcn11ax,t1_fcn0wdl,1577800153.0,"Also tried various blankets yesterday, none were touched"
cats,fcn1005,t1_fcn0s0x,1577800120.0,"We tried that last night, it seemed to scare the cat instead. I have the door open right now cracked with food. Yesterday the cat was sitting by the door for warmth but has no interest in it when I‚Äôve gone to open the door. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll come out in the next hour to go into the house for warmth."
cats,fcn0tia,t1_fcn0nj7,1577799959.0,I think that would work I would need to use one of my family members cars to get to the store. If my plan right now doesn‚Äôt work I‚Äôll try that next.
college,fcjouql,t3_egwl0j,1577697170.0,I haven‚Äôt declared a major yet so I threw away almost all papers from the gen eds.. I only kept some from a computing class because I might go back to take more computing later on lol

depression,ezji43z,t1_ezh5vuz,1567945027.0,"Yeah looked through the account, seems like it‚Äôs just someone searching for karma and is an alcoholic on a subreddit to stop drinking. No reference to an illness, and there is confusion with the profile pick since it‚Äôs not them. I love people getting karma through fake illness üíÄ"
