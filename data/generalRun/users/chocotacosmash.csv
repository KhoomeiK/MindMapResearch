AskWomen,fgnx9m4,t3_ezcmfg,1580954904.0,Proper sewing technique. If I see clothes I love but are made poorly I just cant do it. Sewing is my job and takes hours of my day so I cant help myself.

Paranormal,fgi3f9a,t3_eykmbv,1580803685.0,Right after my grandma died my family started finding quarters everywhere. It's not the first time I've seen this attributed to the paranormal.

ArianaGrande,fgg2whr,t3_exwuy3,1580753091.0,I've always loved this outfit
GYM,fgg1o0e,t3_exsuno,1580752302.0,It helps to have a larger gym that has more than one of the equipment. That way if one is being used you have backup. My gym has one squat rack and without fail every leg day someone is on it the whole time I'm there. Still trying to find a time to go when no one is there. Also make sure they're open early and late just in case. Mine closes at 6PM Saturday and with work schedules it makes Saturday impossible.

AskWomen,ffz987p,t3_evnv2w,1580368062.0,"I feel this way all the time although I also have anxiety but what works for me are funny TV shows or Sam Johnson critiquing singers on youtube. Basically anything distracting. Lock the doors and trust that you're safe while you're distracted from any irrational fears, if that's what they are."
AskWomen,ffz841x,t1_ffz3e10,1580366938.0,Ewww agreed
AskWomen,ffz83f1,t3_evygjg,1580366922.0,Soda or anything that's pure sugar. I want to love it but it makes me so sick that I've just quit it.
Youniqueamua,ffy2l2f,t1_ffvipoi,1580337358.0,"The fact that chief hun isn't black status to me shows how hard it is to make it there. She has like 30,000 followers and makes herself look successful so it's crazy to me. I'm not surprised if she's copying her upline though, they always do seem so scripted."
loseit,ffxrv14,t3_evmmsi,1580331188.0,"Those are garbage people. Dont let bullies change your view of yourself. Someone always has something negative to say, but that doesn't matter. You did a kick ass job losing weight, you had a great time and deserve the good memory. Report and block the post and never think about it again. Keep being awesome and people who truly matter will love you for it."

BingeEatingDisorder,ffb5f2g,t3_esgkex,1579752267.0,"When I was really struggling the most, being full was not enough. I even taught myself tricks to feel less full or would smoke weed for the munchies effect to hit so I could eat more."
UnresolvedMysteries,fewj8rg,t3_eqqshr,1579411700.0,"I watched a whole string of human trafficking videos on youtube and my history is full of that and stalker stories.

I also texted my therapist to say I think I may be manic."
delusionalartists,feprd0y,t3_eq9s3h,1579328691.0,"Weird af but not delusional if there's a market for it, which apparently there is. I'm more concerned who these customers are and the general why of it all."
loseit,fekierh,t1_fejbtgp,1579200691.0,I have a pair of leggings that have fit perfectly fine for months and yesterday I was having to pull them up on the treadmill so it had me wondering if that's happening and I'm just not seeing it. I'm so accustomed to using the scale that it's all I use but I can start measuring too.
loseit,feki5az,t1_fejhius,1579200536.0,"This is what I'm thinking may be happening. Maybe without me realizing, I'm eating more than I'm logging into mfp. I log all the food but the measurements may be off. I also do weigh myself some days where I will have gone up 3 pounds and a few days later it comes off. I was wondering if my muscles are retaining water. I just never have the extra few come off and end up lower than I started. I'll start measuring and weighing every single thing and see if it starts to change."
loseit,fej1gpe,t1_feiyql6,1579153475.0,I have one and I try to use it as much as I can but I forget sometimes.
loseit,fej1flr,t1_feiyljr,1579153446.0,I think I am but I'm starting to think maybe not? I log everything and try to measure and weigh everything but I'm not perfect about it.
