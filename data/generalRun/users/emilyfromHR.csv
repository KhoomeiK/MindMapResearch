AskReddit,fecq7t2,t3_eogysg,1578980638.0,"1. Meal prep! Cook all the things, label and freeze them. 2 Get all the sleep. You will be awake every hour for at least three months. 3. Set communication expectations with your partner to vocally talk about exhaustion, feelings of fear, loneliness, depression. 4. Tear down the fear walls of asking for help. People will help you if you are direct with the ask. “I need paper towels, can someone pick some up for me. “ “Baby puke is my current perfume, I could use some encouragement and ice cream.” 5. STOP READING MOMMY BLOGS. This will hurt, but birth amnesia is an amazing thing. Not to downplay the whole “miracle” thing, but you’re about to do something we’ve been doing since the dawn of time , from hospitals to barnyards. You got this. Don’t fear the experience, have faith in it."

LifeProTips,fdmhqa1,t1_fdmgtdt,1578550315.0,"If it doesn’t allow the bullets it’s usually because the applicant tracking system doesn’t use them. The recruiter may see a weird symbol or it just may not work and you’ve sent a block of text. I’ve seen both in iCIMS, Taleo, Greenhouse and SAP PeopleSource. 

If you’ve found a system where it works, awesome. I wouldn’t consider that the norm."

Sometimes it hurts more than others- we might be close to the person but still have to be the bearer of bad news. Don’t ask us for all of the details, just understand these days are tough and letting us know we’re not bad evil people helps."

It’s drilled into your head from Sunday school that gay is wrong, it’s a sin and you’ll go to hell. When I graduated high school and left it was culture shock for me that gay people are people too, who laugh and the same jokes I laugh at, who struggle figuring out tax stuff, who cry at the same movies I cry at. It was a whole lot of learning for me to unlearn the teachings of a very sad and misguided church."
