TooAfraidToAsk,fee88n6,t3_eo7jn7,1579028425.0,"There is an actual answer for your question, in case you want that instead of a bunch of anecdotal stories. 

The reason that people talk more about SMs getting cheated on than them cheating on their SOs is because there is an entire stereotype built around it; there are stories, songs and it even gets written into books and movies. The way it usually works is that if a service member cheats on their spouse that’s just an affair, that happens in the civilian world, hardly gossip worthy, but when the inverse happens, well *that’s* JODY, and there are traditions of gossiping about Jody going back generations. 

Back in World War 2, black soldiers in segregated units would sing Blues songs about Joe the Grinder (“grind” at the time was slang for sex, so this basically meant “Joe the Fucker”), a guy who would seduce your wife or sweetheart. They took these songs over to the European and Pacific theaters where they spread throughout the ranks. Joe the Grinder became Joe D. Grinder which was shortened to Joe D. which then became Jody, who’s still around today. 

World War 2 also saw the birth of “Dear John,” a term for a letter a GI receives while deployed informing that their spouse is leaving them (stereotypically because they have found someone else, a Jody). Dear John has since entered the civilian pop culture lexicon, further fueling the ethos of “deployed GIs get cheated on.”

Over the years stories Dear John letters and Jody permeated all throughout the military and affected military culture so prevalently that the slang word for a marching or running cadence *is Jody*. Part of the reason we still see these terms and stories from WWII used in the military is the structure of the military itself; the entire system is set up based on the principle of older experienced guys passing down knowledge to younger guys, with that knowledge also comes myths and stories, like Jody. So you take these young guys that have learned about Jody from trusted instructors, and then deploy them to a combat zone with 100ish people that they will live in *very* close quarters with and come to know very intimately. The thing about GIs getting cheated on while deployed is that *it’s not uncommon* (the inverse is also common, but I’ll get into why that’s not talked about next), so it’s almost guaranteed that everybody on any given deployment knows at least one person that got cheated on. 

So put yourself there, one of these guys that you are very close with finds out that he’s been cheated on at some point during the deployment- you *remember that day*, it becomes part of your deployment story... and guess what story every person wants to hear as soon as they find out you are/we’re in the military. That’s right, your deployment story, and at some point in that story you get to the day your friend gets cheated on and you say, “oh and hey, you know that stereotype of Jody stealin’ your girl? That *totally happened* to this guy Joe Schmoe, he slept (x) bunks down from me and [did military job] over there. But yeah, his [wife/husband/gf/bf/harem] cheated on him, got a Dear John letter and everything.”

**Here’s why you almost never hear about service members cheating on their SOs**

**On Base:** When it happens, and it does happen often, the SM will try to keep it on the DL, maybe telling a few buddies but mostly still trying to get away with it. If it comes out the rumor is going to spread primarily through the dependent groups first which, while they do have a penchant for spreading gossip, they have got nothing on the gossip-spreading power of the actual units on base (again because of the close quarters, long work days and high amounts of down time- perfect for bullshitting). 

Alternately, when an SM gets cheated on, they tell ALL their friends at work, who go home and tell all their SOs, so now the gossip is spreading through the ranks and through the dependent groups. 

All this means that the gossip of an SM getting cheated on spreads like wildfire on a base, while gossip of an SO getting cheated on is more of like a smoldering campfire. 

**In pop culture:** As you have no doubt noticed, the military has been huge in media for the last 20 years, mostly because the US has been fighting wars for the last 20 years. This means that books, movies and news are chock full of military stories, and just like the example of telling a story earlier, these stories are gonna be about combat deployments, and not much else. There is not a lot of cheating going on in a modern combat deployment because, as you can imagine, it’s a lot harder for soldiers to find people to cheat with in an environment where the locals are not very sexually open *and* any one of them might want to kill you because that’s how an insurgency works. Needless to say there’s a whole lot less cheating on deployment happening now than when gramps was humping his way across France because he had just liberated one of the most sexually open cultures in history from the Nazis. 

Most cheating by military members happens on TDY, but like we talked about before, nobody is making books and movies about TDYs. So we get a book about a Navy SEAL in Afghanistan with a few lines about the tack-board they have filled with pictures of cheating girlfriends or a movie about a sniper in Iraq with a scene about his buddy getting a video tape in the mail of his wife fucking the neighbor, but we don’t see a movie about Steve who is training in South Carolina for 6 weeks and fucking that girl he met in a bar while his wife is back in Kansas.

WatchandLearn,fdb2e38,t1_fdb0315,1578252972.0,"No it’s a good question, if I understand it correctly. You are talking about the arc between two points x distance above the surface being longer than the arc between the corresponding two points at the surface, right? I think the guy talking about nautical miles/statute miles misunderstood your question. 

It *is* something we take into account in aviation so I can understand why you’re thinking about it, for sure. Usually, though, those types of calculations are more for calculating ranges for high altitude jets on long trips (and also orbit stuff, I’m assuming, any space guys feel free to correct me), so for the altitudes that birds and general aviation planes operate, it doesn’t make a lot of difference (that’s part of why that article I linked earlier makes no mention of it; boldmethod is focused toward student and GA pilots)."
WatchandLearn,fdaygsk,t1_fdadhqg,1578251792.0,"Ok, I hope I’m understanding your question correctly. The Earth’s curvature is so slight that a point 1 mile from you would only be about 8” below the tangent line starting from under your feet. 

If you’re measuring the bird’s speed *from the ground* with a radar then, at the altitude the bird would probably be at, over the distance you’d be measuring them, the difference between their airspeed and ground speed would be negligible. 

I’m not a bird speed measuring guy, but as a pilot, if you were measuring bird speeds from a plane then I assume you would probably just match speeds with the bird and then take your [calibrated airspeed](https://www.boldmethod.com/blog/lists/2019/11/the-four-types-of-airspeed-and-how-each-works/). In this case the ground speed of the bird is a non-factor since you know the airspeed of the plane and are just comparing to that. 

Either way, tailwinds/headwinds will have much more of an affect on your measurements than the difference in distances due to curvature of the Earth."

cursedcomments,fcnp86z,t1_fcnbhok,1577815822.0,"I was just trying to explain (poorly) the two most common ways that the FAA and NTSB report crash statistics, which are (crashes per flight hour) and (the ratio of crashes to successful flights over a set period of time (successful flights defined as from TO to landing)). If you use the first metric, then longer flights are more likely to crash because they will have more hours of flight, but if you use the second metric, short flights are more likely to crash because they have a higher rate of TO/landing per flight hour. 

It really just shows how hard it is to *actually* boil crash probabilities down to a single number, because of all the different factors in flying (such as types of operations, aircraft types, maintenance, weather, etc.). 

I guess the most accurate way of putting it, to my knowledge (not as a statistician or an NTSB crash investigator, just as a pilot), would be that long flights are more likely to have an incident involving an equipment malfunction or failure while short flights are more likely to have an incident involving pilot error during takeoff, landing, or flying in close proximity to terrain and air traffic. But even that is a sweeping generalization. There are so many factors involved in air crashes that it’s hard to point to one specific reason or the other as the reason most crashes happen (unless you’re talking about a design flaw in a specific type of aircraft like the 737 MAX or the initial attempts at the Osprey). 

All in all though, there’s about a 1% chance per flight hour (1.4% is the last exact figure I remember reading) of being involved in an airplane crash, and that is including the stats from commercial airliners, other civilian commercial ops, military incidents and general aviation (which has a 10x greater accident rate than commercial airliners) all in one number. All-in-all, your chances of being involved in a crash on an airliner in the US are incredibly low."
cursedcomments,fcn7x20,t1_fcn3qxe,1577805584.0,"It depends on how you interpret the crash data. You can average out the crash/successful flight percentage and say that every flight has an x% chance of crashing per flight hour, in which case a longer flight, with more flight hours would have a greater chance of crashing. You could also interpret the data and represent it as x% chance of crash per flight (one TO and landing), in which case a shorter flight would have a higher chance of crashing. There’s a lot of debate over which method is more accurate, but either way, the odds are very low, especially if it’s a non-GA flight.

Cut to he and I (about 440 lbs together) sitting at the end of a very short runway in a Cessna 150 on a hot, humid Alabama summer day (for those less versed in aviation, heat and humidity reduce climb performance drastically, and a Cessna 150 with 440 lbs of meat in it doesn’t climb that well to begin with). My flight instructor sees me nervously eyeing the 50 ft pine trees just beyond the end of the runway and, to ease my nerves, says, “don’t worry, all ya have to do is not hit ‘em.”

Long story short, we didn’t hit them... barely. 

He was also known for pranks such as; playing games on his phone while his students flew cross counties, pretending he wasn’t paying attention to the plane; telling students on their first flight to fly “straight and level” and then pretending to make phone calls; and waiting until the student looked out the left window during the pre-flight control surface checks to jam his knee up under the yoke (airplane steering wheel) to make it feel, to the student, like the aileron was jammed. He also called touch-and-go landings “crash-and-dashes” and would often say (in reference to mountains and radio towers) that “ya don’t have to miss it by much, ya just have to miss it.”"

In addition to being military industry centers, Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Kyoto were chosen as targets because they were *comfortably* within range of B-29s launched from the Mariana Islands. Every additional mile you fly carries the extra risk of the B-29 developing a mechanical failure or being shot down and crashing who knows where with an armed atomic bomb. 

Not to mention that a relatively mild crosswind caused Little Boy to land 800 feet off target, so even if they could have gotten to Tokyo Bay, who knows if the wind from the sea would have been blowing towards shore, blowing the bomb closer than intended to Tokyo?"

My main point, though, was that there are important reasons why men’s/women’s gloves exist, especially for leather gloves.

Edit: but on the topic of design and decoration like you were talking about, I totally agree! It’s BS that they’ll sell the same shirt with different iron-on decals to boys vs girls."

I agree that there are too many pointlessly gendered items (like bodywash) but there are actually reasons why gloves and socks are gendered. Women’s and men’s socks are sized differently (in accordance to their shoe size) and gloves have different cuts to fit the typical shape of men’s/women’s hands. The glove thing doesn’t really come into play as much for cloth stretchy gloves, but for leather gloves it matters a lot; wearing the wrong fit leather glove will result in more blisters."
