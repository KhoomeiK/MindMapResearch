You get too caught up in the details of how individual systems mechanize something and if YOU PERSONALLY agree with it and lose sight of your original point.


Rules help establish a shared imaginary space because there is no discussion to be had about how something works. It doesn't matter if Bob thinks padded armor wouldn't work (I mean in reality wrong, you are right) or if I think padded armor should only be 13 (it really was vastly inferior to all other types of armor) or if you think padded armor should be 15. By agreeing to play this game you have agreed to the seed of the imaginary space....where Bob gets to be correct. You can either get over it or not play. The game doesn't get held up when you get hit a sword wearing padded armor and you want to argue it shouldn't matter. It does. The rules says it does. So you are wrong. End of story. 


We can move on and continue on more important things. Sure that might make you not want to play DND....but it doesn't have anything to do with the core of your post. We have agreed by playing DND, barring houserules, that padded armor is AC 11. That is the agreed upon shared imaginary space. The shared imaginary space doesn't have to be ""realistic"", it has to be shared. Which is where the concept of rules come in handy. 


>Text heavy approaches only work for things people playing don't understand or know much about because otherwise, they might have different expectations that clash and cause dissonance. 

I disagree with this. Its a part, but I think the largest part is people can agree on how to conceptualize a fight mechanically much easier than anything else. I mean sure and overhand versus a swing swipe is hugely different in real life....but that is far more detail than 95% of players **even interested in thinking about** combat. For the vast majority ""attack"" is good enough. We don't need to define the shared imaginary space on exactly what the attack looks like, at least in any consistent manner. A player might describe round 1 attack as an over hand slash, and round 2 as a side swipe and then round 3 under a time crunch not really specify so we all believe it was a different type of slash.....it doesn't matter. Its not important enough for us to align on that in the shared imaginary space. 


Now as you mention social mechanics there are  A LOT more nuance. Offering a 100 gold pieces to a noble as a bribe or a farmer as a bribe are VASTLY different in context, unlike a sword swing. Its much harder to account for nuance in hard social mechanics. Its much easier for players to understand the exact context at the table however. The shared imaginary space doesn't need rules because we are pretty capable of aligning on that by default and adding rules can make it harder to align the shared imaginary space."

mutantsandmasterminds,ff952vn,t3_esb762,1579705036.0,"Honestly at that point you are better off treating the first phase of the battle as Power Level X, which is to say normal combat won't work on him. And the battle becomes more ""narrative"". First they have to figure out how to remove or weaken his armor first. Which could be quite challenging. 


First you are always bound to the fiction. A combat round is only like 6ish seconds. Pretty much no battle armor can be removed in 6 seconds (barring Hulk like strength to rip it off or a auto disengage or the like). So as others have mentioned finding a way to temporary disable him to buy time. Though this is a different mindset to approaching a fight and you should have planned a couple ways for the heroes to accomplish this. My rule for things like this is come up with 3 ways to do so, as then your players are likely to find a fourth.


Second, impervious toughness only works for **half** the ranks of damage. So impervious 10 toughness is affected by **damage 6 and above**. Were you playing impervious correctly? The only way that heroes wouldn't be able to damage him is if you gave him impervious toughness more than twice as high as your heroes damage ranks (remember all heroes can up swing their damage by atleast 2 with maneuvers). Also extra effort can be used to apply penetrating to a power and bypass impervious.  


Finally, you are human and this is a game. Especially in free form building games like this, as a GM you got to realize if you just flat out underestimated a villain and correct course as hard as you need too. Perhaps have him escape to come back again when they are stronger. **The heroes don't have to win every fight, and honestly probably shouldn't.** Also no shame in even being like ""hey guys, I made this character far stronger than intended. I am lowering his stats a bit, sorry ya'll"" if need be. Usually more interesting ways of handling it, but you do what you got to do. Everyone there is there to have fun."

Who ever said that is the point of an character advancement, or even that rpgs are supposed to be emulating ""other media""? An rpg is game first and foremost, not ""other media"". Sure rpgs often bring in aspects of other types of media, but these are differentiators between rpgs.  And how you tailor rpgs towards different genres. However rpgs have many other aspects that are unique to rpgs.

>Perhaps more importantly, is character progression fun? Would people have just as much fun if they didn't have to pour over their character options whenever they level up or gain enough character points?

The problems with questions like this is that no statement will apply to literally everyone...however in this case the *vast* majority of people are in agreement. Yes character progression is fun. In fact for lots of people that is a huge part of the game. Figuring out how to take a character concept and materialize that in the rules. Character progression rewards players for playing the game. It's ""realistic"", the more you do stuff the better at stuff you get. Why wouldn't that be reflected in the game? 


>What if players always had access to all of their character options? Would they still enjoy that game? You could still put limiting factors onto its use like mana, stamina, action points, or similar.

I am not really sure what this is getting at....I mean lots of games have less ""special"" abilities and everyone has access to the same options. It is typically just *how well* characters can preform each of those options. That is completely fine, but access to ""options"" is far from the only aspect of character advancement."

Let them get a feel for the game and its mechanics by walking before they run. It will go a long way in helping them understand how to build characters when they see how mechanics work in action.


Then when it comes time to build characters the trick to this game is you **DO NOT** start at the mechanics and start building, especially as a new player. Start from the **fiction**. Ask your players what type of hero they want to play. Ask them to write out a short description of their character, their powers, etc.  Then have them work backwards into the mechanics from what they write."

In practice far more people have no problem doing so than those who don't. And the proof is in the pudding.

>I get accused of being pedantic.

Because that argument is. We don't talk about over head versus swinging your sword for the left or right and how shield is being held (outside of very few games) because 90% that is too much detail to be worth it. Same thing with the argument ""hp potions doesn't perfectly align with.."" sure not 100% but a hp potion covers 90% of it. So worrying about the other 10% for ease of play is silly and pedantic.

Don't listen to the idiots on the sub who act like alcohol doesn't make you do dumb things...it does.

Yeah so this hear I think is a you problem that most others are over looking. I know lots of people who have been ""right"" and then ended up wrong because they proceeded to be an ass afterwards. You say your gf ruined your NYE...and? It's one night. Fun thing about NYE is it happen every year. 


Especially since I read this prior:

If one drunken incident of her making a fool of herself is enough to change your mind on such a serious commitment then you aren't ready to marry her. 


Also:

> I’m a little controlling when stressed.

Yeah? How one sided is this story? Were you honestly being a dick when you were ""pulling her aside""?  I mean why you even asking her ""wtf"" is going on? You already knew what was going on. She was drunk.  While you might have valid cause to be upset, getting upset with a sloppy drunk person tends to just make things worse all around. 


Mate you need to ask yourself if this is all really about this night in particular or more. If it really is about what happened that night, then just let it go. Sit down with her. Make sure she isn't hiding some other issues, tell her how it made you feel. If she seems sorry and no other issues come up...that it, its over. Then ask yourself seriously if you could have handled better and if you took a bad situation and made it worse, which from several of the lines in your post I think you know you did."
