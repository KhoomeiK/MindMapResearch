Yes it does.
Does it need my body to survive?
Yes it does.
Does this fact validate infringing on my right to physical integrity when I don‘t grant it consent to my body?
No. 
There‘s literally no way you could spin this where the fetus wins. You can say it‘s human, a person (...even though there‘s no legal basis for that.), you can call it death, but in the end, it boils down to the fact that no one owes their life or body to another human being.
And that makes it pretty fundamental. It‘s a question of „do I think women deserve to excercise a right granted to them as a basic human right or do I make the decision for them because I don‘t like the decision they could make“"
AskMen,ffhr2w0,t1_ffhr223,1579949428.0,"Yes, but someone pointing out a flaw of you is not the same as bullying."
AskMen,ffhqzbi,t1_ffehvha,1579949270.0,"As far as I know, there‘s no evidence that psychological trauma advances you. The mindset of growing through adversity is very likely nothing but a coping strategy to make sense of something that happened to you.
Being mistreated and having to go through hardships is not necessary to grow as a person. 
So, as a former bullying victim myself, I felt like an expression of empathy and sympathy is not wrong."
AskMen,ffhqsjv,t1_ffejiwl,1579948977.0,"It doesn‘t invalidate your experiences and your abuse that someone has it „worse“. I treat all of my patients, and it doesn‘t make a difference that I‘ve seen patients who have it worse. This isn‘t a competition. You deserve to be taken seriously."
AskMen,ffhq5kv,t1_fff09kp,1579947985.0,"Hey, don‘t downplay your own experience by saying that it‘s „not (...) as serious as what women commonly deal with“. Trust your gut - if it feels wrong and abusive, if it impacts you, it‘s serious. The experience of others does not devalue your own experience."
AskMen,ffhq1ap,t1_fff0eru,1579947799.0,"Which is a good reason to get in shape, but still no reason to make comments about your body. You‘re a grown ass man, your health is your business and no one else‘s, as is your body.

AskMen,ffhpxbr,t1_fffctaf,1579947630.0,"Hey, the fact that you get verbal abuse at home regularly sounds concerning. Is it a partner or family? Do you have plans to get out?"

AskMen,ffhpdu7,t1_ffgrwkp,1579946802.0,"Since it‘s not systemic - check out the other replies, this is by far not the most typical experience among men - I don‘t call it sexism. It‘s harassment, it‘s horrible, but it doesn‘t happen to men on a large scale just because they‘re men. 
I‘m sure you‘ll disagree with me on that, and it‘s totally your right to do so, but I do not wish to discuss feminism or sexism with you over this - I didn‘t think the post would get so many replies, I‘m still reading and I need to get going with my studying."
AskMen,ffgqiuv,t1_ffgpqce,1579912500.0,"It‘s nice to hear that you‘d rather consider not hiring a woman, who might defend herself against sexual harrassment, instead of thinking about how you could minimize the risk of hiring someone who‘d harass your employees. I don‘t think I need to selfreflect about you thinking that I‘m part of a hate group, when you just demonstrated how little you care about women, and how willing you are to protect a perpetrator, rather than side with a victim."

AskMen,ffgndhg,t1_fffyy8o,1579910274.0,"Look, if #metoo makes you insecure on how to approach women in the workplace, it just means you never considered how she felt with your approach before - if you were 100% sure you were treating her respectfully, or with a sense of humor she understood, you would have no reason to be scared.
And I‘m tired of explaining how feminism is not the notion of whatever evil, men hating masterplan you think we cook up in our spaces. It‘s not like I‘m gonna change your mind or you‘re gonna change mine, so I don‘t see any point to start a discussion."
AskMen,ffgmuap,t1_ffg4igv,1579909906.0,"I think I will not „reframe“ the way I identify myself. I pour a lot of work, research and reflecting into what I identify myself with on a political spectrum. Thank you for voicing out your opinion, but I want to kindly tell you that I didn‘t ask to have my own political position explained to me, in a way that you interpret it. This was supposed to be an opportunity to broaden my own horizon, depended on whether or not the men on this site would be willing to share. Not have things explained to me like a child."

It‘s alright, I‘m kinda surprised the post didn‘t get downvoted a lot earlier and harder. What matters is that I heard a lot of stuff, found a lot of ressources, and will be able to learn from this."
AskMen,ffevvvt,t1_ffevqxx,1579867747.0,"Okay, I‘ll check out the link you provided, I‘ll think this over, but tbh, I have little hope and faith in someone who claims feminists are a hate group. But sure, go ahead and call me ignorant, I guess."
AskMen,ffevr5t,t1_ffev64c,1579867598.0,"1. I‘d like to see said evidence. Because so far, the indicators for physical abuse are mental health issues, disability, pregnacy/birth, a failed relationship and migration. And the biggest praedictor for a woman to be murdered is the question of whether or not she experienced domestic abuse.
2. This doesn‘t make sense, and I‘m not even sure I want to hear the explanation. First of all, there‘s no sexism against men - the disadvantages men suffer stem from the sexism against women. Secondly, how are men expendable?"
AskMen,ffevebp,t1_ffeuugr,1579867187.0,"1. I‘ve never seen Fox News, I‘m not American. Feminists are also not anti-male. Men just tend to interpret everything pro-female as anti-male.
2. You‘re correcting what, exactly? It‘s not a lie when I say that female victims of abuse wind up dead more often than male ones. And it does occur for sexist reasons. If you want to claim it‘s not like that, be my guest, but I‘m gonna need more of an argument than „I know this better than you do because you’re a feminst and they‘re stupid.“
3. That‘s actually a good point. While I don‘t think that it‘s impossible for men to have a platform that will be heard, since there‘s plenty of men‘s groups advocating for literally anything, and that feminists definitely didn‘t suppress you from forming platforms to talk about abuse, it could be a good idea to check what spaces feminists currently hold open for male victims."
AskMen,ffev34o,t1_ffeuumc,1579866818.0,"Tbh, I never heard a specific term for it, but I‘d say it falls under internalized misogyny. Both sexist behavior and toxic masculinity are symptoms of sexism, and women showing this kind of behavior is the same kind of sexism."
AskMen,ffeuvtr,t1_ffeuo2k,1579866573.0,"I‘m not going to argue with you over what being a feminist means or not. I‘m also taking critisim seriously - a core notion of feminism is to re-evaluate yourself, your behavior, and to expand understanding, to practice empathy. It‘s how we got from white feminism to intersectional feminism.
In any case, thank you for your input."
AskMen,ffeuq3t,t1_ffep6qn,1579866382.0,"No one ever said anything about dismissing male victims. Every victim deserves to be heard, deserves to be believed, and to receive the help they need.
I admit how there could be misunderstandings when bringing up abuse of men in feminist spaces and actually not having a bad intend over it. I do not see how you don‘t have forums or platforms to make yourself heard, though. The same way feminists discuss their abuse, you could, too. Did you ever? 
Abuse is a gendered issue because it‘s caused differently and has different effects. It‘s serious in both cases, but it‘s not the same. The form of abuse experienced is different, the outcome is different, the opportunities to get help or out are different."
AskMen,ffeufcu,t1_ffe3609,1579866005.0,"1. Thank you for the provided links. I will make sure to check them out once I have more time on my hands, and will use it to start some research. I‘m happy to keep educating myself. 2. I‘m very vocal about my feminist agenda. Especially women in my workplace/social surroundings approach me to talk about issues they have. Sometimes, men do too, to discuss or to share something. Now, domestic abuse comes up sometimes - women tell me about their experiences. No one has ever approached me about abuse directed at men. When I started a dialogue concerning the topic, I was dismissed. But the second I voice out that something is abusive towards women, there‘s immediately a huge backlash. So yes, I am definitely sure that it is mostly used to silence women. 
3. Please don‘t say you‘re playing devils advocate. I know it‘s a useful method of combatting group think, but brought up like this, it just reminds me of men who get a kick out of derailing and harassing feminists. 5. The reason that the high amount of male victims of violence isn‘t a high priority for feminists is because it‘s male on male violence. The cause of the violence isn‘t sexism, but money/power/crimes etc. The reason we focus so much on female victims is because they die because they are women, they are chosen as victim due them being female, they are killed because they are female, and were they not female, they wouldn‘t have been subject of the crime. This isn‘t true for the crimes in which men die. 
It‘s horrbile, yes, and there needs something to be done about it, but it‘s not a sex based crime."
AskMen,ffetpdz,t1_ffel180,1579865065.0,"Mansplaining is a problem, and it‘s used to verbally abuse women by shutting them up and showing everyone present that you do not take them seriously or as competent enough. I came here to listen to men‘s experiences of abuse, at least what you are willing to share with me, not to have the abuse targeted at me and other women be belittled."
AskMen,ffetm4b,t1_ffe35k7,1579864945.0,"Hey, thanks for your comment.
Yes, I‘d like for men to stand up against abuse that they endure, I‘d like them to be treated seriously when they come forward with their experiences of abuse, and quite frankly, I don‘t feel threatened by that outcome.
Me wanting to live a life without abuse and being taken seriously is not being endangered by you being able to do the same.
I‘m disagreeing with some minor points you brought forwards, but the most important part is that there is no equality until all are equal, just like there‘s no freedom until all are free."
AskMen,ffetadr,t1_ffeesim,1579864505.0,"I‘m actually the kind of obnoxious feminist that will not laugh about sexist/racist/homophobic jokes, calls out people on shitty behavior, and will start an argument with about anyone who says something inappropriate about me or anyone close by.
There‘s people who think I overdo it, and that I‘m more annoying than anything else, but there‘s also the people who end up reaching out to me because they feel like I‘m the only one who‘d listen (experiences of sexual abuse, harassment, self-worth issues, for example).
So no, I don‘t feel like feminism is overrepresented. I feel like we‘re not doing enough."
AskMen,ffeswi3,t1_ffesj4k,1579863974.0,"Hey, thanks for providing sources and input! I‘ll make sure to check it out, thank you for giving me an opportunity to educate myself."
AskMen,ffdvrcs,t1_ffdvgnx,1579830135.0,"I don‘t think it‘s weird for a male to be offended by sexual innuendos, I think it‘s disgusting to harass a man with sexual innuendos just because he happens to be a guy."
