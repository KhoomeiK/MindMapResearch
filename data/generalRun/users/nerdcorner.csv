I have gone through so many such phases..and in the end I realize that when you are in a country far-off long distance relationships with loved ones is the only way...keeping up communication is important. I did my Day2 of texting back 2 other people form backlog, and I feel warm fuzzy."

90daysgoal,fcvxhev,t3_eh2gyz,1578012328.0,"My 90 day goal:

1. Run a 10k. To achieve this I need to stick to 16:8 IF with 2 x 24 hour day fasts per month, workout atleast 5x using 10k running program, whole30, and reduce weight to 120 pounds.
2. Finish writing 1 draft of the manuscript and 1 whole edit. To achieve this, I will spend 1 hour each day working towards MS
3. No clothes buy for 3 months
4. Journal and reply to emails and messages everyday

Sprint 1

1. Identified a 10k running schedule that may work well for me. Sticking to it. Need to be able to run a easy 5k under 30 minutes at the end of the month. Need to have reduced atleast 4 pounds i.e. be at 126 pounds
2. Finish complete draft of figures, and methods section. Give a lab meeting.
3. Donate the clothes that are already in piles.
4. Should not sleep without jounraling or replying to messages."

selfimprovement,fcsywaw,t3_ei9975,1577928579.0,"Hard pills to swallow, so that I can stop making myself the victim in all my misery:

1. When you prioritize other's over yourself, you will always end up getting hurting yourself. Put yourself first.
2. If I'm not published yet, it's because the onus is on me to plan better, push harder, and get my work out there
3. You are overweight now because of many reasons that were beyond your control. No longer. You are now in control of all those reasons.
4. I will have more clothes to wear and can continue to do no buy, if I focus my energy on working on my body rather than buying new clothes."

simpleliving,fcbjzco,t1_fcbfgu1,1577587753.0,"Absolutely, 16:8 simplified my life. I was struggling to eat breakfast, drinking water, and ended up buying junk in the morning. Now, I don't worry about eating till 12. I drink atleast 1.5 L of water by then which is a big achievement for me, and no more wasting money!

I would recommend doing a 24 hour fast every 15 days. It really helps the body and detoxes you. 

Same. I don't think I can achieve a zero waste life. So rather than beat myself about it, I'm going to try live intentionally.

I also 100% agree about your idea on FitBit and calorie counting. I never bought fitbit because I felt like I wouldn't be living consciously anymore.  One idea of simple livign and minmalisim is to practice intentional living and *knowing* your body. It's not always about weighloss or health gains, it's about being one with your self..and diligently excersising everyday. Moreover, I use GoogleFit on my phone (as I carry my phone almost everywhere). So it tracks my stats, and I check it every once and again to make sure I have not completely fallen off the bandwagon. For calorie counting, I would recommend Lezl Jayne's ""[Point System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPqrU5UCyFs)"". Basically every 100 calories = 1 point. So instead of counting every item, just know approx how many ""points"" are in each item. Eg. Breakfast of 1 banana (1 point), 1/2 cup oats (1 point), 1/2 cup yogurt (1 point), nuts (1 point) = 4 points. This covers proteins, fats, carbs. Do this for each meal, and adjust it to your calorie needs. It saves me so much mental space. 

Thanks for this post! It's so great to have this supportive community."
simpleliving,fcbb9my,t3_egum2r,1577584755.0,"Personal 

1. I will practice no clothes buy 2020 (except essentials) and instead work on fitting better into clothes that I own through weigh loss. I gained weight over the past 1.5 year as I spiraled on my mental health. So this, is going to be a win-win-win.
2. Continue walking to work everyday (45 minutes , \~3 miles) in the morning. This is both to wake myself up and meditative. 
3. Continue to practice 16:8 IF. Complete day fasts every fortnight (On full moon/ ekadasi). Eating out only once a month
4. Online journal everyday (non-academic) and write for one hour everyday (academic)

Environment

1. Move to period underwear. I don't like cups.
2. Carry my fork, spoon foldable set everywhere. 
3. REDUCE. Not reuse, recycle. Reduce."
selfimprovement,fc1zkw7,t3_efpf7f,1577334755.0,"Making meaningful hand gestures to complement your words can help. Hand gestures helps create a clear physical space for yourself when talking, that boosts your confidence. You don't have to talk loudly..embrace your soft voice and work on being assertive and use power words. Talk in short sentences. I would suggest practising in front of the mirror and in everyday conversation which would make it easier to do it in professional settings. Eventually you will find the courage to look into people's eyes while talking. 

I would highly suggest watching:

1. Amy Cudd's TEDx: Your body language may shape who you are 

2. Vannessa Van Edwards YouTube Channel: She has some great psychological tricks for effective communication. I particularly like the one on hand gestures

Good luck!"
