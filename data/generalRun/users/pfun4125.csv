Wellthatsucks,fdt1chz,t1_fdsibho,1578710645.0,I always assumed they were banned at my middle school because it was way out in the boonies and kids were more likely to bring knifes and guns to school. Definitely seemed like there were more fights and that's with me being out of the loop. This would have been 02-03. My high school allowed bags.
Wellthatsucks,fdt0tls,t1_fdseqnh,1578710452.0,It was like that for me too. Mine was out in the boonies  and unless your bag was clear you couldn't have one. Lockers were small and many were in these weird covered areas at the intersections of the breezeways. They had gates around them that they locked at night. Then In high school (not in the boonies) they let you have whatever bag you wanted.
Wellthatsucks,fdt07yi,t1_fdrie93,1578710235.0,"Graduated 09, school was built in 03. Never had full size. In fact they were smaller than these.

Not convenient when you only have 5 minutes between classes."

It's hard to find good reliable people to work them as well. Also, contrary to what I'm sure many people think, Good food doesn't mean high profitability. It means higher costs, but consumers might not be willing to spend enough on it to offset that, especially in certain areas. My dad has been in the restaurant industry for decades, and I will never go into it. He deals with so much bullshit on a regular basis, and he's not even an owner or manager."

I know that the PO was a nurse with kids though, and I'm guessing she used lotion or hand sanitizer regularly. The trailblazer was in its mid 100ks when the rubber started feeling worn.

Justrolledintotheshop,fcvuq3w,t1_fcvet9b,1578010536.0,They certainly don't help but IME these rubber only steering wheels tend to degrade faster.

cars,fca16wm,t1_fc9xio7,1577561366.0,Engines are designed to run a specific viscocity of oil. Running thicker oil means it doesnt flow as well to the parts that need it. Sometimes thicker oil can help a worn engine where the tolerances have opened up but its just a band aid. And newer engines designed with tighter tolerances as well as vtec or vvt need the oil to flow properly to function correctly.
