AskDocs,fej7d9t,t1_fej3uf3,1579159983.0,"Well, that’s what I was [saying](https://reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/epcdai/_/feilu1s/?context=1) to u/RoyalPrincess19 earlier - she’s had 1 or 2 ultrasounds with nothing out of the ordinary & 1 CT scan where they couldn’t find her uterus & concluded she’s had a hysterectomy (which she definitely did NOT have), so we’ve been trying to get her insurance to sign off on getting another.    

Edit: She just confirmed with me that ultrasounds on her ovaries have shown nothing out of the ordinary."

Lifting things: I‘m pretty sure that’s a yes as well... I’ll find out from her, but I’m 99.9% positive it’s a yes.   

Would that show up on an ultrasound or a CT scan? She’s had a number of ultrasounds on the area that didn’t show anything unusual. She’s also had 1 CT scan with nothing visually out of the ordinary, but the techs noted a hysterectomy which she’s NEVER had, so we don’t really trust that one & we’re trying to get her insurance to approve a 2nd one."

NoStupidQuestions,fed22rt,t1_fecyz95,1578994837.0,Most of these voice activated systems actually have an extremely simple microchip only capable of listening for the key phrase that then activates the bigger microchips when triggered... I think it has more to do with how each individual company handles the data acquired by that second part that can get pretty dicey.
