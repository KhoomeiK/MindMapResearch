science,ffds5sr,t1_ffcruwa,1579827584.0,"America is actually under a mental health epidemic (according to the CDC.) This is being manifested in the rise in homelessness, drug/alcohol abuse, and suicides (which most forensic psychiatrists tie in with most mass shooters.)

We could ban guns tomorrow and seize them all, but it still wont fix underlying issues, which most people seem to ignore.

>**“If the mass media and social media enthusiasts make a pact to no longer share, reproduce or retweet the names, faces, detailed histories or long-winded statements of killers, we could see a dramatic reduction in mass shootings in one to two years,” she said.** “Even conservatively, if the calculations of contagion modelers are correct, we should see at least a one-third reduction in shootings if the contagion is removed.” 


>She said this approach could be adopted in much the same way as the media stopped reporting celebrity suicides in the mid-1990s after it was corroborated that suicide was contagious. Johnston noted that there was “a clear decline” in suicide by 1997, a couple of years after the Centers for Disease Control convened a working group of suicidologists, researchers and the media, and then made recommendations to the media.

>“We’ve had 20 years of mass murders throughout which I have repeatedly told CNN and our other media, if you don’t want to propagate more mass murders, don’t start the story with sirens blaring. Don’t have photographs of the killer. Don’t make this 24/7 coverage....
> Because **every time we have intense saturation coverage of a mass murder, we expect to see one or two more within a week.** - Forensic Psychiatrist Dr. Park Dietz


Dr Park Dietz has actually been on [CNN(this is from 2000)](http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0004/20/tod.04.html), [BBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-D3YoW3Hxg), [MSNBC,](https://vimeo.com/238847596).

Dr Dietz is not an unknown in the academic world. He was a professor and has studied and interviewed as many high profile killers as he can. He has also been trying to inform the media on how to discourage copy cats.

When the guy who literally studies these killers says what you are doing encourages killers... you might want to listen.

**Financial stability leads to [less mental health issues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24121465), less physical [health issues](https://www.cambridge-credit.org/financial-stress-and-your-health.html), more [stable relationships](https://projects.ncsu.edu/ffci/publications/2008/v13-n1-2008-spring/Washburn-Christensen.php), and a reduction of crime and [drug/alcohol abuse. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4601938/)**

This would even help drop some gang crime.




Now let's combine what we have learned from this... and listen to Dr Dietz... from around 2000:

> **I think what people have to recognize, if they are ever going to grasp mass murders of this kind, is that this is a suicide equivalent. If we think of this as an unusual form of suicide, everything else becomes quite clear.**"
