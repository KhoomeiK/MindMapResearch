They werent in this mindset that women weren't going to find them attractive bc of their height though. They were honestly some of the most chill men I've ever been with.

I'm straight up more attracted to shorter men than taller ones because of my experiences with them.

Any reputable breeder of ANY kind would have a similar clause in their contract. Is this breeder legal and registered with a kennel club? Backyard breeders care less and dont even do home checks or puppy shots half the time."
Pets,ff4yzrn,t1_ff4sd2i,1579575852.0,"Very common. 

They normally have a clause that any transfer of ownership goes through them and that if the owner they've adopted out to cant keep the animal, it goes back to the rescue. It's to protect the animals from ending up in shitty situations and unapproved homes. You're probably better off adopting from a high kill shelter if this type of thing is your plan, they wont care as much.

Rescues never fully transfer ownership. It stays their animal, legally, and if you violate terms they can take you to court and repossess it."
