Take away the limited earnings and room and board when the military decides it doesn't need them any more. They're not left with much."

If the Liberals or Greens (Are they running a candidate? It would probably be wise not to.) win the seats then they form government."
canada,fcuafmk,t1_fcu7pi8,1577976387.0,"> Instead of meaningful wage growth in the last 10 years, the middle class have been sold on cheap credit as a way to achieve... well, what exactly?

It's a way to survive a hardship. Most people would vastly prefer to have the money to survive rather than borrow it.

Society should have zero qualms about someone with negative net worth and large amounts of debt filing for bankruptcy. The financial agencies gambled that they would make money off of those loans. They lost the bet. Don't shed tears for the million and billionaires that lost thousands.

Society however should care about making sure these peoples' lives improve after filing bankruptcy. Show me the stats on how many people are doing better after filing bankruptcy. That's the metric I care about."

Entirely valid. In my case the Ryzen 3600 and 16GB of RAM that I recently bought is more than I need, even for the software development I do.

On the other hand last week I told my boss to spend $6K on something that was good value for the company. It all comes down to value."

Excluding laptops, my recent $400 CPU+Mobo+Ram upgrade is the most I've spent on a computer at once, ever.

I was a money conscious student for a long time. I used laptops because I needed to for years. I hooked an external GPU up to one of them. I've gotten some amazing deals on used hardware. (Dual CPU Xeon with 12GB ram for under $200 anyone?) My latest laptop I got used actually. I hardly use laptops these days but I always want to have one (second computer / travel).

I could afford to do an expensive all out desktop build. The value just isn't there though. I wouldn't spend nearly enough time running demanding enough games to justify it. It's just a flashy car. (No I'm not into cars either.)"

Yes. I would power game the shit out of that. I would probably spend most of my time in cheat mode trying out potentially overpowered builds.

Fuck no.

Read over https://www.d20srd.org/index.htm - all of it. Every sentence that isn't pure flavor text is at least one line of code. Every comma in those sentences is probably at least another line. Every table is data that needs to be converted into a computer readable format. All of this needs to work together inside of a game engine. It would be an absolutely massive project."
