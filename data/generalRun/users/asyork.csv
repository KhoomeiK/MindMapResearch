He's about as far from Christian as a person can get, he is blatantly only looking out for himself, he lies to his own party every day, he's thin skinned, he does everything he hatefully claims Obama did, he's destroying our alliances, he's gutting our soft power, and he's just a straight up ass. It's difficult to understand what helps or hurts your cause when you can't understand that opposition.

AskReddit,ffdpiq1,t1_ffdm753,1579825888.0,North Korea had to physically isolate themselves with the DMZ tour hide what really happen there. I imagine it is much easier to get information on a landlocked territory that is surrounded by essentially free states.
AskReddit,ffdouw5,t1_ffdnxt3,1579825472.0,"I've never understood why people use a different voice with people who are disabled, even when they are mentally disabled. Depending on the disability you may need to speak more clearly, loudly, or slowly, but using a different voice is so patronizing.

If you've ever been anywhere remotely close to a paper mill you'd be well aware of the fact that they pollute with chemicals. Some of the chemicals remain in the paper and some are dumped. There's also the biodiversity issue of cutting down old forests and replacing them with all the same kind of trees that are grow fast and cheap.

They've definitely aren't just obviously walking around everywhere. Outside of Nevada where there are billboards for brothels, I've only seen a place where I am pretty certain had prostitutes once. I'm sure some of that is just due to my ignorance, but I imagine most Americans are ignorant about it as well."
vaxxhappened,fejx2ul,t1_fejoqhs,1579187831.0,I was forced to make a FOIA request to the BLM for public documents available at the office I went to because I wanted more than the front desk lady wanted to deal with. Oh man did they answer that one quickly. The very next morning that small town office got a call from DC and suddenly all those documents were available for me.

pics,fehx45t,t1_fehw1cw,1579125603.0,"They had means of forgiveness back then too. They were just more involved. Most were animal sacrifices as far as I can remember.

The NT says that the blood of Christ washes away all sins, and completes the law of the OT. That is why sacrifices are no longer needed, and would actually be an insult to God. This is very controversial, but the NT doesn't say that you have to follow, or even know about, Jesus, let alone accept his salvation."

IdleMinerTycoon,fdxkafa,t1_fdqsmhf,1578769605.0,"What it says under ""Idle Cash"" is exactly what you will get with your current boosts with the game closed or on a different mine. What it says in the mine overview is the resources those parts of your mine are producing *before* boosts.

I haven't checked recently after getting Turner to level 30, but I believe you will always earn more leaving the game open."
IdleMinerTycoon,fdxjnm3,t1_fdqwa89,1578769393.0,"I like to upgrade the lower ones along with it, but not at the same level. Maybe spending up to 10% of what I spend on the main mine so I don't slow progress on Obsidian too much, while still getting some more idle cash."
IdleMinerTycoon,fdxjhvz,t3_elsm63,1578769298.0,I try to go with gear and chest legendary expeditions when I can. They are also good to use when you have done 4/5 expeditions for the day. If you don't have a bunch of friends added then they aren't going to be as useful.

insanepeoplefacebook,fdocb45,t1_fdo4t1m,1578602578.0,"It's easy to be insulated from it when you are white in a white area. Growing up there was often only one black kid in my classes, and I never noticed them being treated any different. Even when I was friends with them I didn't notice. Maybe it still happened, or maybe no one had learned to hate them since there were so few around. Had I not moved away when I grew up, and spent time traveling, I may have thought racism was dead as an adult."
IdleMinerTycoon,fdh3ic4,t3_elapw4,1578414589.0,"If you are going to spend money on the game, and have already bought the permanent boosts, then the season pass is the best bang for your buck IF you use all the stuff it gives. The instant cash is also great to save for the impossible mines."

AdviceAnimals,fdccju1,t1_fdbqymw,1578271618.0,The way it's supposed to work is that he shouldn't be using his own properties at all. Both because he shouldn't have them as president and because even having them he shouldn't privately profit off of taxpayer funds.
trashy,fd35l3u,t1_fd33tos,1578154936.0,"I wouldn't expect them to report it to the police. I'd expect them to show up as soon as you leave so they could collect all of their hidden cameras first, and then they'd realize there's no evidence a real murder happened."

IdleMinerTycoon,fcv0teo,t1_fcuqpl2,1577992329.0,At this point cards are a nuisance with 5 different sets to swap around every time I collect. I really don't want to have more sets. I want the whole collectibles system overhauled.

It probably requires a prescription, but it should be less than $40 by quite a bit. It'll make them really sleepy (that's what it does to me anyway), which I suppose you might not prefer. It is does other stuff at much higher doses, but low doses are basically just a non addictive sleeping pill."

Wellthatsucks,fcm8c0x,t1_fclm5k3,1577766925.0,"I actually got into the industry as a photographer. They had a large area of they needed to work on and the county government only had physical copies of their books. They hired me to photograph and scan hundreds of books. The field manager of the project quit and took the team with him. I was the only one left who had contacts out there and knew what was going on so I got to manage the new team and learned how to do what they were doing.

My first full year I was only home for six weeks, but that wasn't the norm for me. I enjoy the travel though. Despite being involved in the oil industry, the pay really isn't enough if you don't enjoy the travel. On top of it I'm a contractor and am paid by the day, regardless of OT while having to cover all of the costs until typically 2 months after I send my invoice. 

Anything the goes to court would be handled by my client's client (or with even more parties in between), but I've definitely found things that would have had to. It's usually stuff that had questionable things happen generations ago and no one is aware that they do or don't own it, so not much controversy. Most of the controversy doesn't have to go to court. It's typically people who are angry to learn that their ancestors sold off the mineral rights before passing on the land to their heirs. The other possibility is that they bought the land through a quit claim deed and didn't bother check if they were only buying the surface. They have no legal claim at all."

Types of rocks, water, oil, gas, and whatever other things might be down there. I don't know how accurate the results are though because they still occasionally drill dry wells."
Wellthatsucks,fclle1r,t1_fclj6lv,1577750506.0,"I travel around, usually driving, to mostly small towns in the western US to research their old deeds to determine who owns mineral rights. In recent years it's mostly been for mining companies, but it varies from giant oil companies to random people wanting to make sure no one else will show up with a claim to access their land. I also picked up GIS skills along the way that help determine exactly what land deeds are referring to. If you are familiar with the industry, I'm more or less a landman, but I usually focus more on gathering and organizing the data. 

I still do it, but much less of it. I did just start on a new medication that seems to be helping and countering some of the more work-prohibitive side effects of my other medications, so I'm hoping I can at least work enough to not be deciding on what bills to skip. It'll be a few months before I know for sure though."

A diamond ring my grandpa gave her before he died is missing. Another resident was verbally forceful in attempting to pay her to go back to his room, yet was later found rummaging through hers drawers despite his previous actions having been reported.

They had a large area of they needed to work on and the county government only had physical copies of their books. They hired me to photograph and scan hundreds of books. The field manager of the project quit and took the team with him. I was the only one left who had contacts out there and knew what was going on so I got to manage the new team and learned how to do what they were doing.

My first full year I was only home for six weeks, but that wasn't the norm for me. I enjoy the travel though. Despite being involved in the oil industry, the pay really isn't enough if you don't enjoy the travel. On top of it I'm a contractor and am paid by the day, regardless of OT while having to cover all of the costs until typically 2 months after I send my invoice. 

Anything the goes to court would be handled by my client's client (or with even more parties in between), but I've definitely found things that would have had to. It's usually stuff that had questionable things happen generations ago and no one is aware that they do or don't own it, so not much controversy. Most of the controversy doesn't have to go to court. It's typically people who are angry to learn that their ancestors sold off the mineral rights before passing on the land to their heirs.

I also picked up GIS skills along the way that help determine exactly what land deeds are referring to. If you are familiar with the industry, I'm more or less a landman, but I usually focus more on gathering and organizing the data. 

I still do it, but much less of it.
