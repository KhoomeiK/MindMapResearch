heraldry,ffx3186,t1_ffwqio1,1580316679.0,"Thanks for your answer - I am absolutely positive that this is super-serious. I do not want to offend anybody and it's been mostly a fun research which needs a lot of work to be accurate, I know that :) 

I answered Shahars question with more details, how I got excited about this and, well, popculture influence.

I want to do this ""the right way"" though, I don't want to be 100% historically accurate in regards to sewing patterns and such. I have a chainmail, a few parts plate armor and a helmet from larp, so the tabard/surcoat should at least fit the look."
heraldry,ffx1kh1,t1_ffwd3nx,1580315777.0,"From a descendant of a former royal family actually! My last name came from a town in poland that has been created as a vassal to the Wedel family. German peasents moved there to cultivate the land and get a better revenue from the area, which the polish people couldn't achieve. Everyone who moved the got the towns name as his last name. The person I found after quite a bit of research had a book about the Wedel family at home and could point me in the right direction/ show me ""my"" crest. My grandfather and his father are from that area, couldn't trace it much further over the internet though. Every firstborn in my family has gotten a version of the name ""heinrich"" - grandfather said it's what his father told him. Heinrich means ""the leader"". So I'm entertaining the thought that someone from my family could've been someone important in that town, a few hundred years back.

I found out that the Wedel family is quite old - old enough to have a GoT-like family motto: Adorn the truth. Fits to the crests of the villages I found: majority of them has some imagery to truth-saying/honour in them.

Though it might not be 100% correct: that's where my name comes from and I want to have fun telling this story at a fair, a character that writes itself, basically :) This research was a lot of fun!"

It's so empowering and kinda makes you feel so safe and self concious. Every decision we take is ours and ours alone. We control our life. We can give our anxieties some space, we can take our time for our depression to function on other days. And we could take our life if it's really all too much. We can gamble. We can try and challenge ourselves ""what exactly is too much?"" I love it. This is why I don't want to kill myself anymore."

So, when someone tells you instead what to do, it gets a LOT easier. So when you help someone, you're making their life easier - the immediate feedback is happiness. They feel thankful. YOU made someone smile, doing the right thing, without having to fight against yourself. Also, there's trust involved: for a brief moment, you both trust each other. The person trusts you that your help comes from someone potent enough to be of help in that situation and you trust that person not to shove away yourself, your help, you as a person.
