OttawaSenators,ffg6xfo,t1_ffg465k,1579899768.0,This is so true.
OttawaSenators,fffunus,t3_et2tjb,1579892174.0,I don’t know. Gas hotel and 3 tickets to a NHL game for $500 is a good deal.
ChoosingBeggars,fffu7tw,t3_eteo9w,1579891896.0,Wow I hope this one is fake.
ChoosingBeggars,fffnx4y,t3_etc0i6,1579888015.0,Just another example of how the US government needs to start dumping a lot of money into education. This is a scary mentality.
ChoosingBeggars,ffdmous,t3_et0x48,1579824150.0,"This isn’t for exposure at all, this is just trying to get free things. They have nothing to offer anyone for that matter.  Listen,  if your name is Beyoncé you won’t have to ask people to give you free things for exposure, they’ll offer it.  If you’re a nobody from nowhere with a couple thousand followers you’re nothing, a nobody. You have no bargaining power.  Give your head a shake geez."
ChoosingBeggars,ffdkmn2,t1_ffdetgb,1579822880.0,Oops.
ChoosingBeggars,ffdjaep,t1_ffdg67v,1579822062.0,Agreed
ChoosingBeggars,ffddgcw,t1_ffdad3s,1579818562.0,I don’t doubt but in this situation instead of begging for free food why not see if anyone has any odd jobs you can do for some money.
ChoosingBeggars,ffd50a0,t3_esz5m5,1579813539.0,Two adults that can’t afford pizza should spend less time online begging and more time figuring out how to be employed.
ChoosingBeggars,ffd4sgk,t3_esz7y4,1579813416.0,He can ask whatever he wants. He just may not get it.
ChoosingBeggars,ffcyavf,t1_ffcw1r5,1579809776.0,I think if this event was the least bit important as the person is claiming it to be paying for a venue wouldn’t be an issue.
ChoosingBeggars,ffcv0d0,t1_ffcse6q,1579807820.0,True. I’ve only had Papa Johns once one time when I was in Toronto so I don’t really have an opinion but I like Pizza Pizzas garlic sauce but the pizza can be gross sometimes.
ChoosingBeggars,ffcs1un,t1_ffcqwza,1579806086.0,I love when things don’t go someone’s way they deem it a scam.  Like they’re not making you buy their pizza. If it’s too expensive we have like 15 different pizza choices in Canada.
flatearth,ff9ygy8,t3_esdb6b,1579724221.0,Like for real. They study and research a topic using so called science for years and still conclude the earth is flat. I don’t think you can’t get any dumber.
ChoosingBeggars,ff9ctgm,t1_ff9cjcz,1579710127.0,I hope he’s seen a doctor.
ChoosingBeggars,ff9c622,t1_ff9bxem,1579709636.0,I’m 38 but I work shift work which includes 12 hour night shifts so staying up late is normal for me.  It’s the sleeping 10-12 hours at a time that I can’t do anymore.
ChoosingBeggars,ff984mm,t1_ff9653c,1579707048.0,I’d say it’s time for him to grow up. We all want to stay up all night and sleep all day but us mature adults know that life doesn’t work that way if you want to eat and have a place to live.
OttawaSenators,ff79t6a,t1_ff4ckdk,1579644093.0,And teams are playing them much harder now.
ChoosingBeggars,ff798nl,t1_ff7924x,1579643691.0,Ya no doubt someone who leases a Lexus when it stretches their finances cares way too much about image.
ChoosingBeggars,ff6z57h,t1_ff68rpl,1579637879.0,No it isn’t different. You’re just a bit biased and more empathetic to their cause than the average strangers.
ChoosingBeggars,ff6yt31,t3_erwqnv,1579637680.0,Wtf this is absurd.
ChoosingBeggars,ff6xcgv,t3_ery8t6,1579636823.0,"So weird to me, can lease a Lexus but can’t afford clothes. I’d imagine leasing a Honda Civic would be cheaper and leave a little more room for disposable income.  Am I wrong?"
flatearth,ff5y8me,t1_ff5x4y9,1579614130.0,What little I’ve seen of FEs they’re pretty much all low life losers more likely looking for a place to fit in and feel special. I haven’t seen one yet that appears to have a real job and a real life.
ChoosingBeggars,ff4vppy,t3_ernm5h,1579573581.0,Wow. Just wow. What do you even say to this woman. Wowsers!!
flatearth,ff1t4m0,t1_fezr2qf,1579485589.0,When you say stupid things like this it makes me wonder if you actually know what NASA is.
flatearth,feyvubk,t1_feyu4ar,1579451055.0,It doesn’t make sense at all. It makes sense to you because you want it to be true.  If you had shred of knowledge as to how the world worked you wouldn’t think this way.  It easy to think everything is mysterious when you’re ignorant of just about every facet of life.
ChoosingBeggars,feozg2w,t1_feoy0v9,1579308737.0,That’s a tough comparison because at it’s face of course I wouldn’t pay that much for a cheeseburger but that doesn’t tell the whole story. If a high end restaurant with the worlds most famous cheeseburger chef was selling the worlds most delicious diamond encrusted gold plated cheeseburger I wouldn’t be complaining that it’s overpriced. I would just accept that it’s out of my budget.
ChoosingBeggars,feooppo,t1_feometm,1579303196.0,Sure but then it isn’t within your budget. Having a budget is fine but you don’t get to say a Ferrari is overpriced because it’s outside your budget.
ChoosingBeggars,fenxorc,t3_eq5ap5,1579292364.0,I love how people think things are overpriced because it’s out of their budget.  No matter what it is if you want a premium product or service you’re going to pay.
ChoosingBeggars,fejowaj,t3_epg42s,1579181994.0,"How about you just take the kid who’s birthday it is, that way you only have to buy two tickets and you won’t have to beg on the internet."
ChoosingBeggars,fedki3q,t3_eom5vd,1579013796.0,I mean you have to ask yourself if you’re that tight on money is eating important or is playing dress up.  Time for these kids to grow up ffs.

todayilearned,fec61cj,t1_fec4mbm,1578967222.0,The black flies were insane. So were the mosquitos and horse flies.
todayilearned,fec1mpz,t1_febu5zs,1578965335.0,I tree planted in Northern Ontario and that is true. We had to plant trees in the moss on rock outcrops because there was trees there previously. Was hard on the wrist banging into rock instead of soil.
ChoosingBeggars,fe5xunu,t3_enwo2w,1578877363.0,I think shitty people probably think alike.
flatearth,fdkwrtl,t1_fde5tyo,1578512760.0,This has to be a joke.

ChoosingBeggars,fdem492,t3_ekzadk,1578341925.0,lol does she expect your mom to do everything for her?  You know because she’ll have a newborn.  Geez Your sister is in for a rude awakening.
OttawaSenators,fdecudg,t1_fdeaj1a,1578336238.0,It’s never too late. There will be new things to rally around that you’ll make your own.
atheism,fcu69dd,t1_fcu65j7,1577973564.0,I don’t think this guy represents the average Christian. Regardless religion and politics need to be separate.

atheism,fcu5vrn,t1_fcu3lvr,1577973310.0,That’s too bad. With the amount of information readily available these days people should be able to climb out of their religious holes.
atheism,fcu5qus,t1_fcu4bab,1577973218.0,No because religion and politics get brought up in the same conversation way too often for 2020.
atheism,fcu167v,t1_fcu10fs,1577969036.0,Ya this is true. Lots of religious people here too but we keep it to ourselves. Nobody really cares what religion other people are.

ChoosingBeggars,fcsppto,t1_fcspbzi,1577921983.0,I agree. Good thinking. It’s better to be safe than sorry.

ChoosingBeggars,fcsp03e,t3_eip1pe,1577921476.0,If this is real do people actually process what they think and say?  You have to have warped sense of reality to come to the conclusion that someone offering you a free pizza is greedy.
ChoosingBeggars,fcsouq3,t3_eip8ky,1577921370.0,He sounds completely stable. At this point he could offer $500 and it wouldn’t be worth the risk of giving him your address.

AmItheAsshole,fcnoum6,t1_fcnm7ps,1577815608.0,Obviously. Of course everything in life isn’t black and white but when speaking in broad terms love for a child is fairly unconditional for an average person.

AmItheAsshole,fcm91dq,t1_fclx3zh,1577767496.0,Precisely. I’d hope my wife loves our son more than me. It’s no doubt a different love but regardless I’m replaceable and our son is not.
ChoosingBeggars,fcm4b25,t1_fcm334g,1577763879.0,Ya last winter was insane. We had snow until after  May long weekend.  I feel what you’re saying about the elderly and if I worked a Monday to Friday 9-5 type job id be a bigger help but I work 12 hour shifts 7/7 so I can’t be reliable. Once you start doing those things they tend to be habitual and expected.  I just can’t guarantee that I’ll be available.  On the other hand my neighbours should be able to afford to pay someone if they need assistance. My sister pays $300 for the winter.
ChoosingBeggars,fcm2cul,t1_fclyu40,1577762418.0,Pathetic.

ChoosingBeggars,fclm6nh,t3_ehubfs,1577751049.0,Screw that. I live in Northern Ontario and we get  a lot of snow and I’ll be damned if I’m shovelling or snow-blowing someone’s  drive way because they’re too lazy. I hate doing mine ffs.
EA_NHL,fclfnk0,t1_fcledqo,1577746689.0,The problem is that one player has to be hyper accountable and the weaker player gets to throw accountability out the window. Not cool in an online game.
EA_NHL,fclfkbt,t1_fcld651,1577746632.0,Agreed. Unless you’re winning 70% plus of your games DDA is not much of an excuse.  If you’re toiling in div 5 Ice tilt is by far not your biggest problem. Now  if you have a top end team in div 1 with a 90 % win rate while on a ten game win streak and you get matched with a base team with a 50-50 record in div 4 who lost his last three games you’re in for an adventure.
ChoosingBeggars,fcleoue,t1_fclduxt,1577746060.0,Ya these posts kind of make me feel bad that people don’t have better support for child care.  Hard to make a living when daycare costs more than you make. I know people will say people shouldn’t have kids they can’t afford and I’d agree but unfortunately that’s not the world we live in.
vaxxhappened,fcl3aq2,t1_fcf96bp,1577738879.0,Yikes!!!
flatearth,fcl1sjd,t1_fcjv5ho,1577737949.0,I’d say the result of being highly uneducated.  Both display huge signs of that in everything they post.  I’m thinking Mara has had a head injury or something.

AskReddit,fcjfinq,t3_ehf10c,1577685730.0,Nothing too crazy but one night last summer my wife when to bed around 1:00 AM and I went out my side door to smoke a joint. I usually go out my patio door in the back and smoke on my deck. Not 20 minutes later while I’m playing a video game my phone gives me an alert “There is motion at your carport”.  A freaking black bear walked right by where I was standing looking for my garbage bin. He would have walked right into me.

ChoosingBeggars,fcj182q,t3_ehfpj0,1577674744.0,What an ass. Why do people think they get to decide what they pay for an item or service that someone else is providing? I get that you may have a budget but that is your problem.
