TalesFromTheFrontDesk,ffh41tz,t1_ff91itn,1579922536.0,"Not really. I just know what hard work it is, and don't think the already overburdened staff need to come in and make my bed for me every day. I just enjoy it when I can afford to travel. And I sure as hell don't wash my own towels every day; why should the hotel have to? It took years to teach my kids that trashing their hotel room was unacceptable (years of making them pick things up before we left the building!). I hate it when people make ugly comments like ""Well, it's their JOB to clean the room!"" This when they leave food, trash and their (ewww) underwear all over the place.

I work in a service industry; I'm a mail carrier. I appreciate the people who don't look at me as The Help, so I do my best to be nice to people who are doing me a service. I love the luxury of staying at a hotel; seems only fair to thank the people who make it possible."
fuckHOA,ffh3j6z,t1_feobqlv,1579922134.0,"And that is possible. Thing is, they certainly weren't expecting to end up with their grandson as their charge. They don't seem like the (annoying) 55+ community people who hate kids. They really were just looking for affordable housing, which is not very plentiful here. And the boy seems to be a really good kid, always helping neighbors out and being the kind of teen you wish your own had been. If it were just a matter of convenience, if there were other family members he could live with, I might have a different take. But these are the only family he has, and it seems pretty hardhearted to - I don't know, tell him to go to a homeless shelter? - when he has nowhere else to go. And he's not a toddler. If that were the case, I could be more on the side of suggesting that the grandparents try to sell their home and move. But he's 15. In a few short years he'll be either old enough to live there or ready to be on his own."

Disneyland,fe83411,t1_fe6hdmr,1578921947.0,"I suggest looking into AirBnB. I used to stay at the Hampton on Harbor Blvd (technically in Garden Grove), and still like it. But the room costs have crept up a lot and they charge (last time I was there it was $12/night) for parking. That adds up FAST.

I used AirBnB when my daughter and I went to LA last summer for a weekend event. I learned a bit about checking the details of the accommodation, reading the reviews, and using the website easily. I found a dozen 1 bedroom spots within the same distance as the hotel, all under $90/night. You should be able to find quality places for an adult and a child with no trouble. I just got an email from them saying that it's best to book Anaheim summer spots two months in advance."

I don't know if black Christians think of their religion as a positive result; the distance from the beliefs taken from them by their captors is too great. It might be so ingrained now that it's not linked with the slavery forced on their predecessors.
