politics,ffhug63,t1_ffh9lr5,1579954442.0,Well...
AskReddit,ffexe0q,t1_ffdhbdv,1579869333.0,"One time I was walking toward a group of folks about 15-20 years older than me, back when I was 20ish. Busy downtown street, middle of the day. They looked like they were having a good time, and so did my friends. As our two groups cross paths, the woman in the group met me head on, told me I was beautiful (I'm a dude, and was, realistically, the least attractive of the group) and kissed me right on the lips while I was still making sense of of the beautiful comment. She looked like she was on ecstasy. I just said ""Thank you"" like Garth and kept walking. 2/10 creepy.

Another time in college, my friends and I crashed out on the floor of whoever threw the house party we were at.  We were probably a 15 minute walk from home, but mutually decided to sleep a bit. Some nice girl, WAAAAAAAAAY out of my league, brought me a pillow and I thanked her. Total stranger, no contact during the party. A couple minutes later she brought out a blanket, gently laid it over me and finished by kissing me on the cheek as I pretended to sleep because I'm awkward and can't read signals. I went to sleep thinking she was an angel, and I was right to not make it weird. Looking back I probably should've at least said thanks. I'm like 50/50 on whether not I blew an opportunity or would've made it creepy. 0/10 creep

Come to think of it, I might just not be able to handle advances without assuming it was in error. I still mess this up with my wife sometimes."
AskReddit,ffbmdmz,t1_ffb6dnb,1579772525.0,One of my friend's has a sister that must've fallen out of the crib or something. Very trashy. She got married at that Toby Keith's.

Edit: I always sleep naked. Robbers be afraid of this horse cock."

todayilearned,fe8c7i6,t1_fe87shp,1578924689.0,"One of the older nurses I used to work with said Doohan used to come to the ICU a lot, delirious as hell, with alcohol liver problems. Space probably wasn't a great option for him."

politics,fdeimeu,t1_fdedew9,1578339818.0,"I have never voted for a Republican ever, but I think most people overestimated the electorate and underestimated Trump in '16. He's back and spouting more bullshit than a cracked sewer main. And the media loves it. Fox will justify anything for the sheep anyway. Plus at least he doesn't kill babies. Probably.

So if I were a betting man my money would be on Trump resigning or winning reelection. A catastrophic health problem is possible too, sure, but assuming he doesn't take his ball and go home I just don't trust the diabetes belt to vote left. I also don't trust the Senate to do the right thing for the country. Not this senate, and not at the risk of losing their jobs. 

If he runs, he wins. He'll skip debates, run hate rallies twice a week and constantly tweet nonsensical, hypocritical attacks leaving no air for self defense or inspiring the electorate with policy whimsy. Hell, the pussy grab tape came out only a little bit before the election and he still won. They don't care. At least not low information, rural Trump voters. Plus there's the fuckery with voting access, online misinformation, attack ads, ""winning"" a war, foreign interference and so on.

And then there's the Democrats themselves. I wish Warren was doing better. I think Bernie's vulnerable to numerous attack angles. Joe Biden sounds more presidential than 45, but he's still about as inspiring as plain toast without anything on it. Buttigieg? A centrist dem that can bring enough independents over who aren't homophobic and/or the anti-gay, anti-choice religious folk? Cool, have two more votes.  Also, I heard a rumor that Warren has a vagina so she's out."
politics,fdedn35,t1_fdeciq4,1578336735.0,"This sounds spot on, or conversely he shows up and acts like Pentangeli from Godfather part 2 while on trial. I don't really know, but I'm immediately dubious of him trying to throw the dems a bone. Even over Trump. Worst Republican > best Democrat and all that. Plus they can say whatever they want. Their base doesn't ask questions and Fox News can figure out how to sell it later."

Friday we will be trialing a system where ekg's are done twice on each patient by rn's. The second ekg will be folded 5 times, have a patient label applied and flown down the hallway. Note the angle of flight with this non-working machine, approximate poo smell and measure the distance traveled with the one short ruler at the charge desk. Karen, our newest overpaid sweaternurse can show you the 6 places to chart these figures each shift. We expect all ecg's done by 9 before med pass to check the qtc. 

Well it was a rough day. We got one out and six in. We're short a pct tonight and two nurses so things are a little tight, but bed 12 has transfer orders.

We're still out of toilet paper and pens. We hope they will be back next week.

Also be sure to sign up for the mandatory, 8 hour class on how not to be racist occurring during your usual sleep schedule. 

There's still some egg salad from last night in the breakroom if anyone wants.

Hope you have a good night, and remember to update your whiteboard. Also please keep doing the 8 P's. Our useless boss's useless bosses are really impressed. 

Go team."

Beginners still can play Smash and that has tons of options available. Things like random/no weapons, toggle rubber banding, retry a race in a grand prix, etc. We should've had these options six games ago, at least. I still sometimes play MK:DD with the totally random weapons cheat on. It's chaotic and fun."
