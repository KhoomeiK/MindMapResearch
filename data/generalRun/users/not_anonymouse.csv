Some citation?

> Warren doesn't even approach the idea of intersectionality because that would be a nuanced view of oppression.

Warren is my top choice. But with what I've seen her say and looking at her policies, it doesn't look like she's ignoring other minority categories in favor of early feminism. I'd like to see strong citations here too. Because if one is going to make divisive comments, we need to back it up with facts. 

> 99% of backwards, shitty feminist beliefs are from second wave feminists.

This just feels like ""I don't like feminists"" to me. Because you comment sounds like 99% of the feminist beliefs are shitty. If you really meant ""99% of the mistakes in feminist beliefs (most of which are good) stem from second wave feminism that didn't take into account intersectionality"" then you should say it like that."

Here's my issue with your claim. Sure I hate some of the points you hate about the left too. No party is going to be perfect. You can't get stuck on a single issue.

What you are essentially saying is that you care more about having guns (btw lot of people on the left are okay with it - right wing news just distorts it) or not paying for some people's healthcare. That you are willing to ignore atrocities like so many racist policies, undemocratic voter suppression tactics, putting kids is cages, etc just for a few points like that. You are willing to tolerate some racists (""not all of us are racists"" -- no, you need to kick those people out), etc for these few points. 

If that's what you are, that's your deal. But you can't also at the same time genuinely believe ""I’ve learned is that most people just want to be people and enjoy the things they love. Doesn’t matter where they come from.""
