bipolar,feivotu,t3_epdniu,1579148488.0,Maybe get a hamster or guinea pig or snake or something smaller that you can take care of in a cage or whatever. Dog is gonna need more of your time.
bipolar,feivi4m,t3_epdpea,1579148338.0,My last episode i went on 2 meds that pretty much helped to bring me to normalcy. Im med free for now. But i took Lithium and Abilify also clonazepam...So 3
bipolar,feiuzyv,t3_epb946,1579147942.0,I dont think FMLA discriminates based upon the diagnosis at all. Its the severity. You say your good 92% of the time so I’m gonna guess you’ll be allotted a maximum of at least 3 days of the month of unquestioned off time. Dont worry there are laws in place. If the amount of time offered for excusable days is not enough it shouldn’t effect anything you/& your doctor will just fill out a new application asking for the amount of time deemed necessary for you.

bipolar,feis4xz,t1_feirff1,1579145814.0,"I took it for a while. Id say ar least 6mon - yr. twas really bad suppose the dose needed to be tweaked often, very often. Which for me makes it an undependable med."
bipolar,fei8p4q,t3_ep98ds,1579132769.0,"Im assuming this is the XR (extended release) version. I took 1200 mg XR a day at one point but i took one half in the morning the other half in the evening. ALSO I took this amount for only 3-6 months. Anyway, Taking it all at once is what I’d assuming is taxing on the systems that have to introduce it to your system. I would assume its not the best for your kidneys and thyroid. Lithium is a metal and it would probably be a better idea to break this dose into 2, at least."
bipolar,fei7sc8,t3_ep9d15,1579132186.0,"Honestly i felt vraylar was comparable to abilify. I tried them both at very separated periods. It felt the same it was a weird placebo effect. It certainly made me feel the akathisia but regarding my mood, Nothing. So I started experiencing the same inner restlessness that i had experienced with Abilify and went on to Vraylar for in the first place, but it was all a waste cuz the effects were the same. Neither was any better than the other. They both make you anxious. At least that was my experience.

In regards to withdrawals i felt nothing but better. I never felt any weird flu like symptoms or worsen of symptoms. I think you might be well and I took 6 mg quite briefly."
bipolar,fei6762,t3_ep4n85,1579131170.0,Is that a vraylar?

Psychosis,fei54bc,t3_eoo4o3,1579130487.0,"I honestly didnt notice any tiredness with Abilify. I suppose I was one of the lucky ones but no matter the dose did i feel more tired ( i went to 30mg for a. medium frame woman) what did make me feel weighed down was Seroquel, but at the right dose it was perfect. That was weird too because depending on the dose (200 mg) i only felt tired by bedtime. Right after i take it. Then i would sleep well for a good 8 hrs and feel good to start my day. I think Seroquel is more of a winner regarding how i would prefer my treatment to go. It was way more effective than Abilify. Abilify was a sort of placebo. I think the aim for pharma/is to find a drug that works in between Seroquel and nothing at all. Well Abilify is nothing at all. Absolutely unnecessary. Just calling out/reviewing these designer/brand name drugs around us. Everyone needs to hear the truth. Anyway maybe they could infer that if it works half the strength of Seroquel and nothing(placebo) it could be used as a maintenance dose. The maintenance dose needs to be effective in the first place. This was bullshit. For me... Abilify gets a 1 out of 5 stars. Seroquel gets a 4 of 5 stars. Abilify just gave me this weird feeling like i had an extra shadow. It was no good for me maybe its trash for you too? I would stop taking it, however NAD(Might as well be) But...let your doc know for sure and i dont think if you wait it out anything is going to change...maybe get better but maybe get worse. How do you want to play this? Maybe you will get used to the tired feeling. When I first took seroquel and feel the sedation but went to sleep and woke up refreshed i had a good feeling. Then my dose increased and i continued to do well. Didn’t ever really notice a big difference in my the tiredness/sleepiness with the sedation. But all in all it was that tired feeling that helped me get better. It helped me to have a deep sleep... which i was in dire need of i suppose. The thing you should be aiming for is restful sleep. If the sleep is not long enough or too much and you aren’t feeling better but worse tell your boss. No one wants to sleep all day .....unless you’re still depressed!"

AskReddit,fefgatr,t3_eondj6,1579055714.0,Two before work one at break one at lunch one at second break one after work one when i get home &then drink the rest liberally before crashing for bed. Totally doable. I already pull off a six a day breaking it up in a similar way.
bipolar2,fdxd4na,t3_en7vn4,1578767608.0,"Yeah. Definitely. I noticed this years ago way before my bipolar diagnosis. I got on birth control and did my best to control the fluctuations that happen during that time of the month. And it definitely helps. With birth control you can control the timing and length of the drop in hormones and then sudden spike that happens. Makes it a little bit easier to maintain.

I tried going off birth control recently for like 2-3 months & immediately went back on cuz i realized what a emotional mess i would become. I had totally forgot.

It makes a lot of sense to me. Not only are our brains dealing with the highs & lows of bipolar disorder but as a woman you throw in the natural hormonal fluctuations that come on every ~28 days we are extremely sensitive to anything that will throw our mood “stability” off. Ive decided to be on birth control indefinitely."
