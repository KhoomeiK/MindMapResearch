socialanxiety,ffg4hwi,t1_ffg1xwd,1579898277.0,Right. Good luck.
socialanxiety,ffg0vy8,t1_ffca7pv,1579896046.0,"While acceptance is part of the overcoming process, this one feels more like beating yourself up over your appearance and keeping the negative mindset alive when instead one should be focusing on turning the negative thoughts around for starters, as well as looking for ways to improve one's situation and that doesn't just apply for one's looks but pretty much everything else helpful that the typical memes here are counteracting.

It would be so much better if the subreddit was more focused on threads such as success stories, people's posts asking for help, discussing various coping methods, etc. Instead we get this on the the main page.

Pretty sure just relating ""yeah, haha. That's me!"" isn't gonna do shit."
socialanxiety,ffc5nmq,t1_f7pb8vk,1579792103.0,"What's the point? They would instantly get buried down by garbage meme posts. People have tried posting coping methods but their posts would get what, 200-300 upvotes max and be forgotten within 2 days while a useless meme post stays on top for up to a week."
socialanxiety,ffc5atz,t3_esjykd,1579791864.0,"Such an uplifting and helpful thread. 1.8k people wallowing in their negative thoughts. 


Keep it up I guess!"
socialanxiety,fetripz,t3_eqheao,1579378963.0,Support. This sub has turned to shit.
socialanxiety,fdlbypm,t3_elpla6,1578520764.0,Just as I thought. This one won't get as much votes as the cancer that is being posted around here.
socialanxiety,fcnlmpn,t3_ehir4w,1577813866.0,"Finally, for once a useful thread on the topic besides cancerous memes being posted around here that do nothing. Thank you everyone who shared your coping methods and experiences in overcoming this disorder."
socialanxiety,f7p4ut2,t3_dxbv9f,1573942188.0,Yeah don't even bother with this sub anymore man it has turned to shit and mods aren't doing anything about it. These shitty memes don't do anything but reinforce the anxiety. All these people supporting them are a bunch of weebos who like to wallow in their own self pitty.
