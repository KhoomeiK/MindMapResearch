anime_irl,fgis740,t1_fghcx51,1580829735.0,"It's because anime is often discovered as a sub-culture that is broadly accepting. For those who have difficulty socializing and fitting in, this sub-culture gives them an opportunity to feel normal given the wide span of what constitutes normalcy within it's fandom. Due to relative isolation, of course they'd want to latch on tightly. This subculture quickly becomes a part of how they self-identity, and their personality becomes defined by this passive entertainment and that is what this meme is about.

It's not all that different than say, weed subculture, where some people form an identity based on a thing they consume. It's totally ok to like the things you like. It's just inadvisable to *define yourself* through these things, only because doing so slows you from learning who you really are through action. Say, don't just be ""fan of shounen anime"". Maybe fitness-enthusiast inspired by shounen anime heroes, always reaching for new heights of personal achievement, just like the characters he/she watches when they go home."

Thick strong tendons aren't that easy to notice, taking fingers for example, even decades of training only make about a 50% difference in thickness, but holy fuck, a professional climber has grip strength that can embarass power lifters hundreds of pounds bigger than they are.

To the point, perhaps tendon strength is part of that ""born with it"" mythos around punching power, because it's a factor that isn't as noticeable as the clearly visible factors of speed, technique, timing, or muscle size.

Midband spectrum currently used for 4G  LTE has medium coverage and medium bandwidth. Mmwave spectrum currently offered in select areas has super short range coverage and ultrahigh bandwidth.

HOWEVER, the 5G standard can be used on BOTH the midband and mmwave spectrums. Right now TMobile is only doing the midband, while Verizon is only doing the mmwave. Eventually, both companies will be offering 5G on both spectrums. 

What does this mean? Modest speed gains in places you normally get LTE signal, due to DSS (Dynamic spectrum sharing) where both 4G and 5G signals will come out of the same cell tower, speed on 5G will be marginally better due to the improvement in spectral efficiency, and go up over time as they shift the ratio of spectrum, Potentially up to 1gigabit speed. A few people in Urban areas may get pockets of ultrafast 5g...like 30 gigabit speeds. No real benefit there most of the time, the real practical value of mmwave is in fixed home wireless, where they replace your cable or fiber to the home connection with mmwave antennae through your window. Basically making it easier for them to sell home internet in places they couldn't afford to compete in.

In fact, you can even pasteurize chicken as low as just above 130°F (54°C), but I don't recommend it.

Another good one is baking chicken breast to 140F and then taking it out and wrapping in foil. Not cooking above that temp keeps it juicy, tender, and delicious instead of that mealy bullshit that earned chicken breast such a bad reputation (i.e when cooked past 150F).

This is part of why people are pissed at China for artificially keeping their currency cheap. It makes their prices lower vs the dollar causing trade imbalance that favors China. This is part of why people were wary of joining Euro because it stops poorer countries from allowing their currency to devalue.

Linking currencies works well when the economy of the constituents are roughly equal. It allows for business exchange without threat of currency volatility. It does not work as well when there is a large disparity in economic health between members, where some members do need that currency volatility to get them out of a hole."

To sum up, it is a tool for efficient allocation that requires regulation to aim it's efforts at desirable outcomes rather than an uncontrolled spiral into undesirable outcomes. This is absolutely a Democratic view and is one shared by every candidate, including Sanders and Warren, neither of whom have proposed that we get rid of capitalism. There is a huge gulf between the idea of free market capitalism and centrally planned economies.

The OP suggesting SS to be reformed to gain a better return is simply that. Aiming to achieve a public retirement program that achieves the same or better returns on retirement savings. Practically speaking, who is privately saving for retirement the same way that SS saves for retirement, with an aim of near-zero returns on decades of investment? Nobody does that because it's ridiculously inefficient.

What people normally do is invest in growth while young and shift mix to low risk investments as they age, so by the time they might need to retire, they are in low risk positions while having gained a ton of compound growth over their working growth. SS does not do this. There are ways to reform it to allow it to reap compound growth gains while also insulating against risk to retirees. Right now it is simply badly designed, and nobody is defending it's current design."

They were still really choosy at that point shortly after 9/11.
