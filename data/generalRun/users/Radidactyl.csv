My girlfriend works with all women and she often comes home crying because of how horrible they all are. So therefore now I can say ""wow bisexual white girls are the absolute worst"" yeah?

DMAcademy,ffbtuw9,t3_esrxn1,1579782541.0,"I think it depends on the world. 

In The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, ""magic items"" are mostly pretty mundane by their own standards. In D&D standards they would be fantastic. ""Deals extra fire damage."" ""This armor makes you slightly invisible."" But you can buy them from any magic shop, or even some of the more generic stores. Sounds great in D&D terms, but in Oblivion? Those are pretty mundane. 

The problem occurs when people mix their worlds up. A campaign that wants to be as gritty as Lord of the Rings, by nature, cannot include a lot of magic. Or at least not mundane magic, and it'll have a lot more subtle and primeval nature to it. 

A high-magic world in D&D terms would include lots and lots of items from the Xanathar's Guide ""Common Magic Items"" list. Things like ""a cape that flows behind you as a bonus action,"" or ""clothes that magically mends itself."" Even in a high-magic setting, you have to use common sense to dictate what would and wouldn't be common. 

But people think ""high-magic"" and think, ""Oh, I can buy a Deck of Many Things from any traveling merchant."" Smartphones are pretty common in our world, which can do amazing things, but are .50 cal machineguns? No, not really. Well, hopefully not where you are. 

You have to consider what would and wouldn't be mundane and what would be extraordinary in your world. 

I'm currently DMing an Oblivion magic-level campaign and my players can never find anything like a Flametongue Sword, but they can find plenty of stuff like beads of nourishment/refreshment, or magical capes that just look cool, and other really mundane magical stuff that no adrenaline junkie adventurer would be interested in. Except for maybe the beads of food/water. 

I don't think D&D 5E lends itself too well to low-magic unless you're playing with gritty realism and your players have stated they want a rough and tumbled campaign. I think it's best at a middle-magic, maybe a step or two below the Elder Scrolls, where there are magic swords in dungeons, but not from shopkeepers. Although shopkeepers would sell things like spellcraft materials, or maybe some Xanathar's Guide ""common magic items."""
