wholesomememes,ffpokcr,t1_ffpogk4,1580100426.0,Yep! Perry is the enemy of the character in the post. For most of the show they’re the episode’s B plot but often where the funniest moments come from.
StardewValley,ffpoh9p,t1_ffpiwuj,1580100353.0,They left out the best scene imo (to avoid too many spoilers I’ll just say the theme park scene)
StardewValley,ffpo4gs,t1_ffpnloz,1580100054.0,"To be fair I didn’t notice for ages because I didn’t talk much to either of them or go to their house, so I never saw them together. I didn’t know where penny lived for over a year in-game."
SampleSize,ffjuqcd,t3_etvzrn,1580007485.0,"They look equally good to me, what vibe were you going for? Indigo gives me sweet punk girl vibes while teal has a sci fi dystopian hero vibe, imo anyway."
wholesomememes,ffjtrr2,t1_ffjp3ih,1580006723.0,"He’s from the show phineas and ferb, it’s made for children but the writing and humour are entertaining for just about anyone imo."
brooklynninenine,ffhul1c,t1_ffhudkr,1579954625.0,This is one of the best comments from this bot.
GenderCynical,ffhjyaz,t1_ffgyuoa,1579938712.0,So is agender 0000?
dndmemes,ffhjo4b,t1_ffh9rna,1579938323.0,Dude my party’s monk uses patient defence all the time it’s so good
dndmemes,ffhjlwy,t1_ffgo40i,1579938240.0,Yep! I’m playing a rogue scout in my 5e game and my friend is a monk (the new psychic one). We’re at level 17 now and the two of us are like anime-protagonist-rivals levels of stupid if we both decide to attack one thing. It’s great.

Oooooooo mamaaaaa"
StardewValley,ffg14zn,t1_fffek51,1579896199.0,"I mean for Sebastian it makes sense. His home life sucks, and the only way out he can see is to move to a big city he wouldn’t even like living in, and then someone comes up who has their own house and is nice to him that he also likes? I’d suddenly want to live on a farm too."
StardewValley,ffg0w7z,t1_fffkdfe,1579896051.0,"I forget how to do spoilers on mobile so I’m just gonna write a big preamble and leave a gap before I post this next bit which is a bit of a spoiler for sebastians marriage dialogue:

Spoiler: Sebastian mentions after you’re married that he just wanted to get out of his house, and that he gets too nervous around people to really want to live in the city. My poor boy has social anxiety and he can live on my farm and never have to interact with anyone except same and Abigail at the saloon."
