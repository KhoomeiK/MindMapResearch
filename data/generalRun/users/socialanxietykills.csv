I can eat in restaurants and all but i can't eat infront of my classmates..i never eat in the canteen because of the fear that my classmates will be there ..i will starve myself but not eat....and i think if i see them outside of college or something then also i won't eat ...it's just infront of them, otherwise i can eat infront of people ."
socialskills,ffpq953,t3_euhyvz,1580101937.0,OHH MY GOD SAME!!! I studied in an all girls  school for like 7 years and now in university it's so difficult for me to converse with men..like i just can't talk to them...when they say something i zone out...it's SUPER bad the only male presence i have in my life is my family too...I am sorry i cant give you a solution because i suffer from this too but if it's any consolation i can tell you that you are not alone.

I have only commented once or twice that also i just started recently .(only on reddit)
When i was on instagram everyone used to ask me to post and all but i just couldn't do it. I hate being in someone else's post too.
I  downloaded reddit somedays ago and have only commented here after a lot of effort because i feel people here are similar to me in some ways  and i relate to people so much on reddit  that  it makes it a little better not completely though. Right now also thousand things are crossing my mind but im trying to get over it and not think too much.
Thanks for listening."

And also , Good thing that you got it off your chest.
You should never hold such things inside , that way it only gets worse ."
