thefighterandthekid,ffs8h5x,t3_eus7l5,1580175722.0,"Bryan is cool in my books, I think he is genuinely funnier than a lot of Rogans other cronies and has had some respectable appearances in films and television. He can be a bit of an elitist / leftist  sometimes but he's mostly fairly reasonable and is a solid history guru. He also seems like a friendly guy who a lot of comics respect. 

Schaub on the otherhand, is an overachiever in virtually everything he's done. Shouldn't really have been on an NFL practise squad, shouldn't really have knocked out Cro Cop and absolutely shouldn't be a standup comedian doing regular shows at the store. He's good at talking shit and triggering people though, I'll give him that."

thefighterandthekid,ffp7lvu,t1_ffno1xy,1580088240.0,"Madsen was a decent HW prospect though Schaub had to continually grab the fence. Gonzaga, Cro Cop & Mitrione was respectable victories and he beat some lower end / journeymen type regional guys like Lavar Johnson, Tuchsherer & Gormley. Ultimately Schaubs biggest downfall was he never had the chin to make it in MMA, which is why his career was so short lived. He already suffered two brutal KO losses only 10 fights deep into a career."

I'm only getting downvotes as it's blasphaemy to give Schaub any credit here on these boards and that's fine I get it, I don't like the guy either, but any half educated and fair person on the subject would agree Schaub had a pretty respectable career.

Fought in MMA's biggest promotion, made it to the finals of TUF, became a contender, fought on pay per view and at one point was ranked top 15 -10 and beat some good fighters. That is far more than most heavyweights accomplish. 

To call him a bum purely because he didn't receive a title shot is moronic, tomato cans or bums struggle to collect victories, let alone beat ranked fighters."

He done it on Rogans podcast more than once on the most recent fight companion podcast, he just instantly dismisses anything he has to say. Why even invite him on if you're just going to interrupt and cut him off ?  


 The funny thing is, Schaubs predictions are way off, just because you use to fight doesn't give you the right to be an asshole and dismiss others opinions, especially when you have a hit and miss track record on fight predictions. I don't know why Callen hangs around this clown."

AskReddit,fecn8rb,t3_eodtd1,1578978155.0,"Had a mate who just went downhill ever since a young age. Got expelled from primary school, then he ended up reconnecting as he went to my high school. Around 14-16 got heavily into pot and alcohol, then his mother died of cancer so he graduated to lsd, mushrooms, mdma, various amphetamines. 

He was just self destructive and would self-sabotage his life. Around the ages of 27-28 I got a call that he was found dead in an alley in the city due to a mixture of a flu, alcohol and diazempam. He was trying to get back on track going to rehab but obviously it wasn't enough. I hadn't seen him for a few years before that, last time I saw him he had a serious drink driving accident. 

He wasn't a bad guy by no means, all the potential in the world really..just had a bit of a childish outlook on the world, all play and no work, never really dedicated himself to anything.  He was difficult to be around at times but he was a friend and I'll miss him."

Trump calls anyone he has a positive experience with a terrific guy and/or "" a great friend of mine"" so you can't really take his word for it.

There are plenty of good looking bald dudes out there, this will be a kick in the guts for you but you only have two options, let it wear you down or just accept it for what it is, fate.  It is a good motivator to get in good shape and stay in shape, by the time your mates start going bald and are overweight you can be in great shape and have dealt with that issue a long time ago. At your age, you may be able to swallow it and move on, some people fight hair loss for 15+ years and let it control there life, then when it comes to it they shave it and wonder why on earth they were that obsessed with their hair in the first place."

Even to obtain CBD oil here legally is really hard, I have to buy it off the black market like most others. You basically have to be have cancer or have epilepsy.   


They are still brain washed from tactics from the 1950's and will not even be open to the idea, hell they won't even open up the idea of just doing a simple trial, it's infuriating. People are going to be consuming drugs and seekings highs whether they're illegal or not, that doesn't deter people. The war on drugs is a never ending battle, it cannot be won, cartels are becoming wealthier and more powerful, now you can't just legalize all drugs and not expect repercussions however something has to change because the current strategy is not working and it has been in effect for over 100 years."
