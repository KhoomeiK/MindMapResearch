I’ll be the first to say that it gets overused and applies to unattractive men disproportionately. But I’ll also be the first to admit creep behavior is really common. How long was the concept of cat calling viewed as innocuous? 

The term being misused is separate from the issue that no one actually means “all” men.

Edit: I want to clarify my intention when I say “creep”. To me it’s not socially awkward guys striking out. It’s over sexualizing and being overly obnoxious towards women. Cat calling (on line as well) is creepy. Asking a girl for their number isn’t. Asking for the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th time is."

Look, I’m not going to try to infer why you continuesly bring up dicks in this thread, but you may want to do some self reflection about it. 

But like too many once entertaining things, this is boring. Good luck with your totally big dick and keep fighting the good fight. Men are under attack and this persecution must end! Tell all your totally real feminist friends I said hi."
mildlyinteresting,ffgi5op,t1_ffghfn8,1579906777.0,"> It's funny how you assume shit out of nowhere, do you want to compare dick sizes or something?

Sorry man, not letting you twist this as well. We weren’t comparing anything at all at this point. You just randomly brought this up in the literal sense. 

Dick measuring can definitely be a colloquialism and used as a metaphor, but like all metaphors needs something to originally compare it to. Since there’s nothing in our conversation that we were dick measuring about, you either misused the phrase or were speaking literally. 

But this whole English thing is obviously new to me."
AskReddit,ffggxkr,t1_ffg0iy0,1579905984.0,"No man, one is shaming bad behavior, one is shaming perfectly normal behavior. Women can sleep around all they want. Men shouldn’t be creeps. 

The focus is on the behavior during the criticisms of being creep. It is already understood it’s not all men. You can’t stop doing something you’re not doing. 

There are plenty of examples of behavior that skews statistically towards women that get the same treatment. Women need to stop being trans exclusive, women need to not tear down other women, women need to stop supporting publications that push unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standards. 

Agree or not, these are common things that have been said and it is absolutely understood not all women do this. This is why it’s annoying when men chime in with “not all men”.  No one said all men and now you’re distracting  from the actual conversation to make it about yourself.

Edit: so many downvotes and no comments on what I said that was wrong. I have no issue with them, but am curious as to what is wrong about what I said."
