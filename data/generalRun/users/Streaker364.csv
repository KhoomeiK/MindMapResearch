And you honestly can't say that. The only time I see people talk like that(for thrird ""problem"") is online.
 We're a different generation from the people who try to make thoes rules are from a world where it was almost like girls were for boys. Their children started to try to break free from this stereotype, their children(Us) completely broke that ""rule"".
And I'll admit it, I do tease my female friends(I'm a dude) about the music they listen to. I call one emo because she listens to heavy metal(even though she is the BIGGEST basic white girl I've ever met). And well she teases me back about my weight, blah, blah, blah. Girls, THINK their criticized for their body, or anything of the sorts, it's actually girls themselves that put all this pressure on themselves. We look at others and compare ourselves and the we are like, ""wow, Im ugly"" or ""wow, I suck"" We don't look at the things WE'RE good at. We only look at our bad sides...... we're not grateful of ourselves....We're at an age where looks still shouldn't matter.
And, we don't notice these issues because, simply put it...... girls (specifically our age group) are too complicated. But guys are a little too simple and hide our problems.

On whith THAT fricken crap. We have a larger effect on us through the ""rules"" I mentioned earlier. Women have the ability to talk about their problems without worrying about getting put down. If we men talk about our problems publicly, we are gawked at and put down deeper than hell. We are taught to suffer in silence, to keep our pain to ourselves, and when we get to our breaking points and express our problems to loved ones and friends, no one believes us because they don't expect it. We're forced to make a hard, emotionless surface, which is chipped away by our burdens.

What's my point? There's too many problems in this world to focus on one. Women's problems, men's problems, climate  change, discrimination, too many. 

I acknowledge your opinion. It's mostly correct but you don't look at the cause of these problems and study all of its aspects and look from the other side of the problem. 
(The medical thing is completely new to me so I 
didn't mention it, I study shiz like this A LOT)"
