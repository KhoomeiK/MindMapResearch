I want/wanted kids, but there’s no way I could afford them. 
My job is one that gets outsourced or removed from companies every few years. My resume because of this looks atrocious. Like I can’t hold a job for more than 2 years. 
I can’t build up a 401k. I can barely contribute to it myself, so I’m mostly relying on what the company puts in.
I honestly don’t see myself retiring. I will die at my desk...
Or I’ll be homeless in my 70’s"

FML."
anime_irl,fe6ehsv,t3_enp0q9,1578888516.0,"So this happened to me in real life. My 23yo ex fiancée fell in love with her 17yo “friend” playing Maple Story.

As in they lived in other states, and had never met in real life. She basically fell for a chibi cartoon avatar in an online game.

After the emotional cheating, I finally found out about it. We broke up... dude joined the marines and gets transferred to our state... blah blah, they got married."
relationship_advice,fe5vkhl,t3_enmw2v,1578875912.0,"So I’m not saying she’s cheating on you. 
But something similar happened to me before.

My experience was: Long distance relationship, my girlfriend would get mad and quit talking to me, we’d make up, same thing would happen a week later.
What was really happening, I found out, was she was seeing someone else, but was on the fence about who to be with. She would start fights hoping I would get tired of it and break up with her so she wouldn’t have to be the bad guy. She finally told me the truth after several months of these games.

I hope that’s not the case, but it might be a good idea to leave her alone. If she comes back, great... if not, don’t blame yourself, she might have been making up an excuse to let you down without straight up saying “there’s someone else.”

Like I said, I hope I’m wrong. 
Best of luck my friend."

I met one in boy-scouts from another state. Blue-eyed blonde, and I thought “how strange” when I look in the mirror and see a brown-eyed brown haired Reid and think, that’s what I picture a Reid should look like. 

Funny considering the name means “red-head”"
