Toreba,fetk4kh,t3_epiwun,1579376236.0,"I still think some prices are way too high - like stickers or mini keychains.  2,000+ TP for those is ridiculous.  Should be like 500.  Probably would get more players.  2,000 is still hefty but much more reasonable for a large plush or name brand collectible.  This being factored into the TP price hike makes any appearance of reduced cost to play null.

Anyways, some wishes for 2020:
- higher quality images of prizes, including measurements (some don't have any). If I'm putting down that much money to play I need to know what I'm getting

- faster and more thorough customer service..with the big bucks lots of people put into this game, there's just no excuse for this anymore.  I can see why initially English support was lacking, and totally understandable before it went big.  But now with many players all around the globe this has to be addressed.

- no ""trick"" setups.  I don't mean difficulty, I mean things designed to be disingenuous and/or misleading.  Hidden bars, transparent tiles masquerading as the drop point, etc.  You should be able to view exactly what you're getting into."

SkincareAddiction,fe8rvo2,t3_eo5owx,1578929963.0,"First, a disclaimer. I have pretty significant depression, so a routine hasn't been my thing in quite a while. There's still stuff I use semi regularly which I outline below.

33, female. The upper half of my face is super dry, with flakiness. My T-zone especially. I have tried multiple exfoliating face washes (basic stuff like Neutrogena). Currently I wash either with just water or Sebamed cleanser. 

I've also tried numerous moisturizers. I really like Honest Beauty deep hydration but not sure it does much for me. I've been trying BioOil recently as well. I've even put some Aveeno Baby Eczema therapy nighttime balm on as well but it didn't seem to do much on my face. 

I have enlarged pores, possibly rosacea, and my face flushes a lot. I also tend to sweat a lot from medications. Putting makeup on accentuates the dry flaky skin but I don't tend to wear it much anyways. Acne isn't a big concern right now.

I've done some reading here and see a lot about Paula's Choice skin perfecting 2% BHA. Is that something I should consider? (On a side note, is Amazon legit for that? I'd like to not pay nearly as much in shipping as the product costs). 

Any recommendations would be great - thank you!"
