And that pizza place delivers too.  If you have movies that need to be returned, and you’re feeling lazy and craving a pizza, you can order delivery and the delivery guy will take your movies to be returned.  Or they’ll bring you movies that you can rent from their website while submitting your order.

cedarrapids,fdl2a1l,t1_fdkuqev,1578515827.0,"Spacing was the biggest problem.  I ended up doing it this way:

White line

White line

White line with green trees

White line

Blue river line

White line

So there’s six lines, all the same thickness.  I supposed I could’ve done more lines, changed the thickness of the river, the size of the trees, etc.  I got set on 6 lines because the proportions are 2:3, so that kind of set the framework.  Each tree is exactly as wide (at its base) as the thickness of the river, and the height is the same as the width.

I think if I had done it with a wider aspect ratio, like 1:2, the spacing would’ve been much easier and resulted in a more balanced flag."

Iowa,fdk9s5v,t1_fdk842x,1578499291.0,"I appreciate that.  I struggled with how much I wanted to include on the flag, and in fact I started with a much different design with about 4 colors, a big star, etc.  But I couldn't make it work, and a lot of that has to do with my lack of professional artistic training.  I've done web designing in the past for some RuneScape fansites that I was a part of, but besides an ""Art Appreciation"" class, I have no formal training.
