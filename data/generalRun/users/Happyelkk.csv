SuicideWatch,ffo6cv0,t3_eud7w0,1580074566.0,"Hey, hi.
You are saying those things about how you act and your character like you know they are wrong and you don't like them, so why not try to change them? If you think living is not for you maybe you should change how you live then, learn to destroy the parts of you that you don't like and build new ones, ones that can make you stronger and numb the pain of the shit times.
You can also ask someone for helo, no shame in that. Maybe it' something a talk could help you change, other than give you a different outlook on things.
Don't give up man, if nothing else you seem like you have an interesting charcter, it would be a shame if you left us."

You should definitely talk about that with someone and it will help ease the burden or just let you see things in a different perspective. 

I know it's hard to change stuff in our lives, but if you have some things you don't like and feel like you have to change it then you need to find the courage and strength to do so. But know that you are not alone. Ask for help and focus on the good things and the strength will come to you. Loving someone is maybe the best part of life, so that is definitely a pro, but even so, focus on changing what you don't like so you can then love this person even better and with a clearer mind. At least that is what i'd try to do. Sorry if it's not helpful."

SuicideWatch,ffm6jcw,t3_eu7ahs,1580049283.0,"You want to show her the photo and make up for it, that's a great thing, not everyone would do it. 

You should reach out to her and ask if she would be willing to talk about it. I don't think it's that serious, more creepy than sexual assault to be honest, but it's still some bad stuff and you already know that. Speaking about it with someone and then to her I think will make you feel a lot better, even if she doesn't take it well, but I'm sure you are aware of the risks."

And that starts with what you just did right now; you saw it wasn't right. The hard, but best part, is now working to change that. For that you can (and should, depending on your situation) ask for help.

SuicideWatch,ffinuz8,t3_etuca7,1579978360.0,"Waste of resources, with all the things you have done and probably understood I don't thinks so. One wasn't quite right tho, you asked to what end do we do everything, there is no goal or end, other than what we set ourself, so life is basically two things: or searching for the goal and all the experience. To what end you say, those things are 'the end'.

If you are worried about yourself you should seek a psychiatrist, I found it illuminating talking to one, you may expand everything you know.

If you have something that keeps you going, even a little bit, hold onto it with everything, that something is your life. If support groups helped that you should try again, you made me think I should too."
SuicideWatch,ffhr7z9,t1_ffhq2si,1579949651.0,"I can perfectly understand you. I wish that too for me.

It depends if you have asked her recently. If so then maybe wait because if she feels like you are scared and anxious it may make her so, and what you want is for her o be happy. Maybe if she doesn't seem to answer ask if she wants to talk, once. Let her know you are there for here, but let her also know that if she needs space and time to think you can give her that as well."
SuicideWatch,ffhpz6v,t1_ffhpm8x,1579947710.0,"I know really well how it feels to have someone you feel so connected with get away, so I hope it does not happen to you . Even so, you cannot let it dictate whether you will live or not because even if she says no and you are desperate, you know the feeling of being so connected and you should strife to find it once again.

If she says she is not ready for a relationship then just try to be together normally, but be careful not to impose anything on her or make her feel like she is obligated to have something with you. Just be there for here and let her know that and she will surely be there for you if you feel such a connection. She probably doesn't want to loose you too, so just don't force her to do stuff she wouldn't want.

Have any reason to believe that she will go from having dates to completely shutting you off?

Even if that happens I know heartbreak is something hard, really hard, especially for some, but it is not worth killing yourself. If you care about love so much and finding someone to share it with it will happen.

SuicideWatch,fffkk4o,t1_fffjno2,1579885964.0,"I guess you could try to talk to someone about it, someone you know it's far from them and maybe that will, first of all, let you vent it out and second you could see a bigger picture and find a way to sneak past them.

I would say something from experience tho: don't let a negative side of you define you. I had some very nasty stuff about me that I thought was defining in a sort of way. I kept telling myself ''that's just how I am, I'll never change'' even though I wanted to change because it was a stupid, dangerous fucking part of me that I hated. It kept going for many years till I exploded. Don't make the same mistake. Part of it is thinking it cannot be cured or that it will always be there.

If you seek help, someone to talk to, not even a therapist, just someone to vent to, and if you want to change don't let a part of you (no matter how strong you think it is) chain you. If you don't know what to say just think of the stuff you think about, what keeps you up at night and shit it all out, maybe not so much as to burden who you are talking to; even though therapist are there for that sole reason, it's their job and it really helps. It helped me.

She probably was in your same position, she said things in a tone or way that wasn't really conveying what she wanted to say.

You don't need to go, really. Stay, we can talk.

People where there when you needed them, now it's time you need them again, reach out if you can; no life is meant to be ended by suicide.

SuicideWatch,ffdbpqd,t3_et03bn,1579817459.0,"What you said is incredibly true, being a child seems incredible when you grow up because life gets really heavy going on and sometimes we feel destroyed but that weight. I am extremely anxiety-prone and feel such a weight when in front of others sometimes; the stress can get unbearable. I am so sorry for what happened to you as a kid and for that I think you sound extremely tough to put up with all that stress and weight.

The weight is what gives life meaning. We have to accept it and find a way to carry it (doing the things we like, finding something we love). Don't worry, you will find it (and maybe you already have something you love doing so concentrate on that). And it's not one of those empty messages like ''don't worry it gets better''. In a life so full of things we do come to the things we like and that keep us going.

If you know the consequences of other's suffering then it's a great start. Suicide is a selfish act, but a theatrical one at that.

With therapy and asking around (even the therapist him/herself and the people that work on that kinda stuff) you could find a living solution and then you can start to get better.
Or couldn't you stay in the hospital for the smallest amount of time possible to find a solution. Use the hospital as a think tank and sort things out so you don't concentrate on how shit you see the place.

Like leave all the abuse behind and find a place with better solutions.

About the ahedonia it may get better if you pick up some stupid hobby for a while, just for a change of pace, and then it may come back a bit.

SuicideWatch,fee8574,t3_eojxxq,1579028370.0,"Because it is. It is comforting, like drugs are comforting, until you see under the surface. The problem with suicide is that it is a solution (a stupid one, but still a solution) for whoever does it. The shit part is always for others, for the people around you. And even if you hate them it will have an effect beyond just them. People who think no one cares think it has all the benefits, but it has not. You wouldn't make a good example and you just choose the uncertainty of what's after instead of being sure that you can stay and tell everyone to fuck off. 

That's really comforting: knowing here you can tell people to fuck off. You don't get that after suicide."
SuicideWatch,fee6m4d,t1_fee5ibh,1579027472.0,"Been faced with someone else's fears and life is sometimes really scary. Many people can instinctively avert their eyes because it's scary and they don't know what to do. If you are talking about normal posts on reddit then it happens to me to, but in such a large community it's bound to happen, just try not to let it bug you too much. I know it bugs me, but I keep trying. If that is difficult for you feel free to pm me, just talking may ease your mind

And of course you don't know me, but the only reason I would ghost someone may be sleep or work"

If it was explicit he/she doesn't like you than it's not hope anymore. Easier said then done obv, but you should let it go then and concentrate on something else."
