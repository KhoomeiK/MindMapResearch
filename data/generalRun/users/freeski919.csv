Then Pershing was General of the Armies, which is considered a higher rank than General of the Army. Then in 1976, Congress posthumously awarded Washington the rank of General of the Armies, and also stipulated that Washington outranks all other military members, in perpetuity. 

So following a linear star progression, that would give Washington 7 stars. But Washington's actual rank is the same as Pershing's, Washington outranks Pershing by seniority. So it would be a 6 star rank. However, General of the Armies was used prior to the use of the modern star scale."

When you are carving, your are going fast. That's a lot more energy for your body to manage, which means your muscles are working harder. That is going to be the case on any ski. 

Are you otherwise in good shape? Do you have an off-season workout routine? It sounds like you need to strengthen your legs and core. You probably also need to take some lessons. It's likely that you're using inefficient technique which is straining your muscles more than they need to be.

Carving isn't for going slow, so get that thought out of your mind. If you want to go slower, then don't carve. There is still this lingering mindset that carving is how you're ""supposed"" to ski. That's just wrong. Carving is one technique out of many, and all of them are useful and valid. Want to go slower? Smear your turns. Let the edge go a bit and feather it.
