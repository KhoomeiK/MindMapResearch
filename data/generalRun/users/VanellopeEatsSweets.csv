BlackPeopleTwitter,ffptylo,t3_eujl77,1580105611.0,"This has been my biggest accomplishment in my transition to adulthood. Being able to understand what a toxic person I was and see my own faults/be willing to hear out my partner's perspective regardless of how right I think I am has given me a solid foundation for so many great relationships in my life.

Being around a team of women at one of my jobs who were just wonderfully positive, uplifting, honest and genuine changed my life forever. It shifted my whole understanding of what it is to be a positive person and now I will accept nothing less than that kind of genuine care from myself to others. This has helped me in so many ways, but my mental health is the most notable. So thankful for this shift in my life. :)"

2meirl4meirl,feyq7of,t1_fevus6s,1579449207.0,"I got this far down the thread just to realize that (as a woman) I hate this rating system. I'm not sure where I fall on this scale and I don't want to know really. I'm in the process of losing a lot of weight and I'm not that far off my goal, it's really just ended up meaning a whole glow up and a lot more attention from people that I wasn't expecting. Now that I've thrown out my context, I just want to say that pretty much the instant I hear a person references a number like this in relation to someone, I check out on them as a potential partner.

I have faith in your ability to end up with someone who is good for you! I just think it's helpful to know that it *can be* perceived that way by the opposite sex so you don't accidentally lose your foot in the door with someone you would want to be with. Not that my opinion or experience is everyone's, so also feel free to just ignore my response. :)"
