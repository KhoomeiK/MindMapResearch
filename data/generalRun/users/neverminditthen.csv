fatlogic,fenim2d,t1_femzmx7,1579285485.0,"This doesn't really make sense to me... my natural waist *is* ""just above"" my hip bones. If I try to move the measuring tape any lower, then it's affected by the width of my hip bones themselves and the measurement only goes under the ""half your height"" rule when my BMI is under 20. That doesn't seem like it should be correct. It's the same as all the ""measure your waist at your navel"" directions I see... my navel is even with the tops of my hips, several inches away from my waist, I'm measuring my hips now, it throws everything off."

Regardless, there's way more to maintaining good health than diet. That's just a single component, albeit an important one."

fatlogic,fddu7xt,t3_eks3ma,1578324096.0,"It looks like she *does* care quite a lot about Susan’s diet, if she’s willing to go on rants about it and try to dictate to Susan what she should eat and what her body should look like."
fatlogic,fddq5ax,t3_ekn7m2,1578320985.0,"Meanwhile, wearing the cute clothes that the FAs lament they are denied their rightful access to and a face full of makeup is not about making oneself appealing to the male gaze at all. Nope. Not one bit."
fatlogic,fcr3u5b,t3_eigs8m,1577896382.0,"Pretty sure the only people who think being fat or thin is a moral issue are FAs themselves.

And I'm willing to bet that's because they feel shame over being fat - deep down, they feel as if it makes them ""bad people"", so they think that everyone else must think that too, and that everyone else must also think that thin people are ""good people""."
fatlogic,fc0b7bq,t3_ef5220,1577285666.0,"Saying that no one should count calories because sometimes it’s the first step to an eating disorder is kind of like saying no one should ever drink alcohol because sometimes it leads to alcoholism. The vast majority of people will be perfectly fine and the ones that know it’s a slippery slope for them can abstain without jumping down everyone else’s throats.

Personally, other than for weight control, I have to count calories when I’m really anxious/stressed for long periods because I completely lose my appetite and actually eating 500 calories a day for days in a row will leave you feeling like a wreck."
fatlogic,f82du3z,t3_dyecar,1574189287.0,"I just cannot wrap my head around the idea of a bunch of dieticians denying that what you eat has any effect on your weight. It’s so bizarre I’m starting to feel like *I’m* the crazy one, you know?"
