I wish we were all capable of having both.

In the meantime, I’ve avoided wedding cake in case there’s a bizarre side effect and it makes men less hygienic which results in way less sex.  Lol."
Tinder,ffslbnb,t1_ffsl75k,1580184552.0,"Haha. 

It’s an old joke I heard a long time ago.

What do you think is the cause?"
datingoverthirty,ffscfk6,t1_ffrosru,1580178388.0,Not soon enough.  Lol.

It’s wedding cake!"

Did it work?"
funny,ffpix33,t1_ffpii7q,1580096136.0,Lol maybe.  I thought it was hilarious.  I am sure we all go through “stages of grief”  at some point with our jobs.

Thank you so much for the suggestions! : )"

I haven’t heard The Peter Principle brought up since my last conversation with my finance professor friend in 2015.  

It sadly applies to myriad micromanagers."
Tinder,ffoo2za,t1_ffnlsaq,1580079788.0,Lol! Now I have that song stuck in my head.  Thanks a lot.

CougarsAndCubs,ffojd93,t3_eucbsb,1580078290.0,"Hi ya.

Just be upfront like you are here.  Explain that overnight stays aren’t best for you.  

There’s nothing wrong with time management and making sure you can fit everyone into your schedule. 

Family is important and she should understand that.

Good luck!"
aww,ffogzwq,t1_ffo7qt6,1580077550.0,"Oh wow!  My pup is at 17 weeks,  but we’ve only just finished all of her vaccinations and one month into her heart worm medication.  Previous owner fell behind schedule and I am making sure she’s protected. 

She hasn’t been exposed to many people and other pups just yet.  

We did go to the dog park and she’s super shy, for now.  

She absolutely hates any leash; I have 5 different kinds.  First time dog mom and she’s so spoiled.  Haha.  

Bark is such a cute name, by the way!  : )"
datingoverthirty,ffoekuf,t3_eu9glg,1580076832.0,"Hello OP.   : ) 

Is he much older than you?  Do you feel that your love can grow over time? 

What are your life goals at 40? What do you prioritize? 

I’ve actually been told the same thing.  Maybe it’s Asian culture? 

Being with someone who loves you more implies that there’s also love on your part.  Love and sex are not inextricable.  Is lust the issue here? 

As I get older, I feel my attraction towards men changing.  Before it was the typical: tall, handsome, fit, and so on.  Nowadays, I take more time to consider overall health(physical and mental), mutual respect,  intelligence, and integrity.  

My favorite physical feature on a man is still his face.  So as long as I am attracted to that inescapable aspect of him, the rest will fall into place.  

Be kind, respectful, and communicate.  Treat him in the same manner that you’d want to be treated.  I hope it will lessen your confusion."
datingoverthirty,ffoaq5w,t1_ffnf8ln,1580075790.0,"Sensical.  Upvote from me.  

I have zero issue being the more attractive one in any relationship.  

It’s more important for me to be able to respect and trust a man rather than having eye candy. 

As we age, our priorities will change and attraction will veer from solely physical towards a culmination of attributes."

Congrats to you on the house and the dog!  So awesome.  : )"

He’s gorgeous!  I can’t wait to do this with my pup.  She’s still young and not completely leash trained yet."

One more point for you on the upvotes!  : )"

Took me a while on the Dormammu joke.  Lol."
funny,ffmabr7,t1_ffk7ain,1580051348.0,I think you could pull it off.  Maybe a “strained somersault” -Sumo-Shuffle-Jedi dance! Lol.

Thanks for sharing your story.  : )"
CougarsAndCubs,ffjkenj,t3_ety49a,1580000242.0,"Congrats!

I am glad you’ve had positive experiences.  

Not sure this sub allows for personal ads versus just sharing anecdotes.  It doesn’t bother me either way.

I feel you still need to be appealing and attractive even if you’re just looking for something casual.  More so when your target audience is female.  

Love and sex isn’t inextricable, but I don’t know too many women that just want a vapid piece of meat, online or offline.

Be the best version of you, no matter where you are."
Bumble,ffj7kbe,t1_ffivsza,1579992366.0,I may not be able to afford them.  Lol.
Bumble,ffj7hcn,t1_ffj018l,1579992309.0,Buying flowers for yourself is awesome.  I do it often during the spring and summer.  We have to treat ourselves as often as possible.  : )
