Girls cannot solicit donations from businesses or people, but if someone says they want to donate $1 instead of buying cookies that’s ok. We just deposit it to our troop account, and note it on our financial form as a direct donation. We’ve never had any issues."

forensicanthropology,fe8mgn4,t3_eo4tpy,1578927927.0,"Human osteology will be the best first course. It gives you a solid understanding of human bone biology and anatomy, and gives you practice in identifying bones from fragments, practice in “siding” bones, and practice in data. 

If your university doesn’t offer a human osteology course, then anatomy and physiology would probably be your next best option?

My university has two websites you can access: eskeletons.org and eforensics.info (case studies are locked for student use only, but the learning modules are open)

I’d also recommend getting a copy of “The Anatomy and Biology of the Human Skeleton” by Steele & Bramblett to start you off."
girlscouts,fe2w4ql,t1_fe2rw92,1578843490.0,"Look, Girl Scouts is a volunteer organization, and everyone is pretty much the same level of “authority” - as a Troop Leader, my authority is only like 1% more than anyone else. I only ever “put my foot down” when it’s a matter of safety and adhering to the GS rules, like no selling cookies before the official date, or how many chaperones we’re required to have. If you were my co-leader and pushed back on me, it’s my **job** to listen and to figure out how to help you. It makes me nuts reading about all these Girl Scout leaders who go wild with perceived authority and steamroller over everyone else. 

Your mom is co-leader, and that means that she has just as much power as this lady. I hate to use this phrase but your mom needs to ‘grow a spine’ and push back. Print out the facts that you researched and found, email them to her and cc: the service unit cookie manager. You say, “there appears to be a misunderstanding. You told us that 400 boxes was mandatory but we can only take possession of 100 boxes right now” (or however many you can). “We will work with you to return the other 300 to the council cupboard or to transfer them to another troop by [date, 10 days from now].” 

And if she doesn’t *immediately* help you resolve it, report her! Type up a factual and no-emotion email saying exactly what happened. Send it to your service unit cookie manager and cc: to the service unit director.

“Troop leader/cookie coordinator said “400 boxes is mandatory” we later found out that is not true. We feel pressured into preordering more than we are comfortable with and we are not in a position to be financially responsible for more than 100 boxes this season. Troop leader is not providing transparency or guidance. When we raised these concerns with her she said “Just make it work.” Troop Leader has a history of freezing people out when they challenge her.” ... Etc. 

It’s your troop, too, not just hers. Take control! Stop rolling over when this lady throws her weight around. Set a good example of healthy boundaries and conflict negotiations for the girls. If you care enough to post here and vent, then take the extra 5 minutes to type a real email to the lady who caused the problem."

girlscouts,fdougyn,t1_fdojfvd,1578613148.0,"Advises, and what we heard from the poster is that she heard “have to”. So either OP misunderstood, or the troop leader is being pushy and not clarifying that it’s a recommendation only. 

Either way the troop leader has failed... firstly because she’s got a parent here who is stressed out and feels pressured or obligated to do more than she’s able to this year, and secondly because she has failed to create a channel of communication where parents can feel comfortable raising concerns. 

If I had a parent in my troop who felt like this I’d be falling all over myself to correct the situation and help them, and reinforce that cookies are optional. And I’d be re-examining my communication skills to ensure that I don’t do it again."

girlscouts,fdnpte4,t1_fdnb7uk,1578590586.0,"Don’t torture yourself and your girls any longer. If they don’t like the troop or if they’re not enjoying it, just transfer them to Juliettes/independent as soon as you can. 

Whatever they “miss” by leaving that particular troop will be outweighed x100 by the lack of stress."
girlscouts,fdnp9v0,t1_fdmx099,1578590330.0,"Exactly! If you have a girl in the troop who *sets her own goal* of 1000 boxes because she wants that free week of camp, and she’s happy to work toward that, then the troop leader is supposed to help facilitate that: assign her to booths, help her expand her sales network, connect her with previous top sellers to learn resources and tips, etc.

And if you have a troop where the entire troop sets their modest goal at “We just want to make $200 and have a big pizza party at the arcade!” Then the troop leader helps the girls figure out how many boxes per girl would get them there, how to budget for the party food and supplies, figure out what they want to do if they fall short of that goal, etc. 

I’m continually amazed and saddened by stories of troop leaders who push and push and push girls, and mislead parents into stressful cookie selling. Yes, cookies are a great tradition. Yes, it’s impressive when you read a news article about a girl who sells 3,000 boxes. Yes, for many troops it’s the main avenue of fundraising.... but it’s not the end-all, be-all purpose of Girl Scouts. 

I’m proud of all my girls, whether they sell 1000 or 10. I congratulate my top sellers privately and I don’t make a big public spectacle at our troop meetings or publicly identity the top sellers. I *do* however make the group sales totals clear and show the girls how fat their bank account has gotten. I help them vote on ideas of what they want to do with that money. I help them budget and plan trips. But I don’t take cookie sales personally or view it as any kind of reflection on me as a troop leader. That’s bananas."
girlscouts,fdmhxw1,t3_em5466,1578550529.0,"Whoa! Who is telling you you “have to” order 80% of what you sold last year? You *absolutely* don’t have to do that! Don’t believe her, unless she can point to council or GSUSA rules that say so (hint: she won’t be able to). In fact, you are allowed to just sell like 1 case and then turn that money in and be done with it. 

PM me if you’re shy about sharing details, but I’m the “opposite” kind of troop leader than this lady: if a girl in my troop sells 10 boxes and she’s happy, I’m happy. If she sells 500 and she’s miserable, then I’m not happy. 

Way too many troop leaders get caught up in cookie sales and see it as their personal mission. It’s a source of fundraising for the girls in the troop to use for their adventures and supplies. That’s it."
