oddlysatisfying,fdekfqg,t1_fddvbfx,1578340917.0,"Docking is a very intimate and intense sexual act performed by two uncircumcised men. Guy one pulls his foreskin back and holds it while guy two stretches his open and outward as far as possible over the head and shaft of guy one's penis. Then guy one repeats the procedure as he's releasing all of his foreskin that he was holding back tightly, pulling the opening out and as far down as possible over guy two's penis, making sure guy two's foreskin stays in place. When complete both cockheads are touching tip to tip encased inside of each others foreskin, the duel coverage combined with the moist juices starting to flow from each of them creates a suctioning effect somewhat similar to a fleshlight, helping to hold everything in place while jacking both penises as one, an effect much like that of those chinese finger ""handcuffs"", allowing quite a bit of masturbating action while easily staying inside of each other. The sensation is so intense that both guys will quite often ejaculate simultaneously, visually filling the foreskin coupling with so much cum you can see it swell to the point of overflow, slowly uncoupling the foreskins and savoring the warm wet sensations, working their still hard penises together with their intermingled juices..."
