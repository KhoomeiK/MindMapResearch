The lower defining point, 0 °F, was established as the freezing temperature of a solution of brine made from equal parts of ice, water and a salt (ammonium chloride).[2] Further limits were established as the melting point of ice (32 °F) and his best estimate of the average human body temperature (96 °F, about 2.6 °F less than the modern value due to a later redefinition of the scale)."

nba,fehsyqx,t3_ep23so,1579123254.0,"Everybody loves to hate a villain. And 2018 Warriors filled that role nicely. Now there is a real lack of narrative.  Clippers are doing load management, people hate the Lakers due to a portion of their fanbase being toxic, Giannis can't really do anything wrong (except join the Warriors next season), Nets have had both Kyrie and KD injured, Zion hasn't played a game so there's not really ROTY race like we had with KAT vs Porzingis,  and so on. Everything is mild or average. We need more exceptional stuff, like Klay's blazing quarter, Skyfucker Curry, Rockets-Clippers tunnel saga,  TWolves practice games, Colangelo twitter drama and so on.

soccer,fef85j4,t1_feepy4j,1579050450.0,"Fans go to any team with success. Fighting or caring about them is stupid. Some are like the birds, they “fly” from team to team, while others will remain with the club forever. It’s how fanbase growth works."
soccer,fef7u1f,t1_fee67up,1579050234.0,"Every club is “artificially made”. They don’t grow in trees.  People are just angry because RB Leipzig will take the place of their worse managed clubs. 
The city of Leipzig deserved a team and they are doing it properly: didn’t splash $$$ like City, they invested big in youth players and facilities and so on.

And people have the right to support anyone they like, young or old. Even better when you can see the whole history of the club and they haven’t had seedy state influences, like any of the Dynamo clubs from behind the Iron Curtain; or like some west german clubs during the 40s. 
And on top of that, it’s one of the tamer companies and owners around, not taking advantage of underprivileged countries for their resources.
So my answer to people that keep complaining about RB Leipzig is: “ok boomer”.  And I don’t even follow the Budesliga anyways and I don’t care who wins it."
