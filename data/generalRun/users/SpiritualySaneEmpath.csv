tifu,ffdsm96,t3_esrytx,1579827893.0,Thanks for the sensor!
AskReddit,ffbiutb,t1_ffbihac,1579767341.0,That ending was so unexpected! Honestly it sounded like you really just thought of him as a friend. LOL. I'm happy for both of you though and wish you good luck! What a good story

AmItheAsshole,ffbiej1,t3_esfxc0,1579766732.0,"NTA, it seems like they unfortunately became narrow-sighted and selfish. I'd consider their behaviour rude and hopefully they realized that after you left. If you were friends for a long time, I'm kind of inclined to suggest talking to them about why what they did was wrong. Friends help each other out, even if one of them is walking a wrong path. Or maybe I should say *especially* if one of them is on the wrong path.."

StringTheory,fevqkw9,t1_feeoxj4,1579400317.0,"Yes extra dimensions, but I am wary about confusing them with legitimate universes like our own, with planets and animals and humans.  I don't see any reason to says affirmitavely that they are whole parallel universes kind of thing. I believe if we use the term ""universe"" for these extra dimensions is must be in a figurative sense"
StringTheory,fevpfat,t3_epv73l,1579399971.0,Tis just dust my friend
CPTSD,fenjtw8,t1_fenhpll,1579286233.0,"You're absolutely right. I just think that forgiveness can heal. If an abuser asks for it sincerely, it can heal them but most definitely also the abused as they can let go of that pain. All I'm saying is it'd be nice. But it's definitely not owed to the abuser"
Advice,fenj8kt,t1_feninco,1579285866.0,"I agree, those are pretty horrific to look past. And I can appreciate your perspective too.

Edit: sorry, I accidentally pressed send. I also wanted to say that yeah, I can always see the good in people and want to help everyone. I think people with perspectives like yours and mine are both necessary for justice. It's a good balance."
Advice,fenh8og,t1_fenfsga,1579284637.0,"A price has to be paid for sure, but I only agree with the first one. I have a niece too and I am **not** taking that risk, even if it's minimal. But I wouldn't be at risk, so I'd still hang out with him if that behaviour is in the past for him and he's trying to be a great person. And if he abused animals at one point? He stopped. He got better. Anyone who realized their behaviour was wrong and fixed themselves would be someone I'd be proud to call a friend because change is extremely difficult yet they did it."
Advice,fencyfk,t1_fenbraz,1579282025.0,"But if he's committed to suppressing it, then it's just about as good. As good as he is committed of course."
Advice,fencc5a,t3_eq1won,1579281645.0,"Well, I don't know if you thought about this, but maybe he's changed and wants to forget about all that. Youre doing a wise thing by hearing him out. If you think he's sincere enough when saying that, if he says that, then I think you should just leave the past where it belongs. If he's changed there's no reason to hold the past against him. And he was acquitted too, so maybe that's evidence for him"
Parenting,fenbclv,t3_eq22la,1579281039.0,"No, they weren't right. The job you have doesn't determine how good of a parent you are. It seems like you're a great parent whose son is simply going through teenage things. I've felt the same about my dad in highschool and it wasn't for any good reasons. Now in my 20s I can appreciate him for who he is, not what he does for a living. The important thing when it comes to his job is that he tries to do everything he can to support his family. As I've matured I see that as the important thing. I'm sure your son will too with time and the right guidance. He probably just expects a lot from himself because of the pressure he feels from the media, his friends, and school. I'd say to just be sympathetic with him. Don't be judgemental or more strict with him. If there's gonna be a heart to heart I think it should be with his mom since hes distanced himself from you and you shouldn't force anything onto him, like you said in the beginning. I wish you the best of luck. And it shows how good of a dad you are just by coming on here to ask us if you are!"
relationship_advice,fen9xud,t3_epzix6,1579280163.0,"I can't even begin to understand how you must feel right now. But as a bystander without emotional attachment to your situation I have to point out that maybe she's left it all in the past. Or, she's trying to and just hasn't yet. All I'm saying is I don't think you should label her as a monster just yet. Let her explain why she hasn't deleted these yet, and if she plans to."
CPTSD,fen92x9,t3_eq17e1,1579279639.0,"I understand how hard it is to grow up with a narcissistic mother. I know the frustration, the pain, the darkness. But please think about keeping your heart open, even slightly, to her. People can change even at the last second. You never know. Something could happen that would make her see how wrong she was. But I understand it can be too hard. No one would blame you if you didn't do this, but maybe just consider it? Just something to think about since I don't know if anyone else would tell you this. One thing that's true for sure is that it always sucks to lose a mom, no matter who she may be. 

Edit: I should add that it doesn't have to be now"
Parenting,fen6vd5,t3_epv3v1,1579278275.0,I'm glad for that edit. I also think you did the right thing
Parenting,fen5tv0,t1_fekclit,1579277626.0,"That's amazing. You're honestly inspiring - I don't know many people who take it upon themselves to do programs and classes and whatnot, even just simple learning for critical self improvement like parenting, anger, and security. And hey maybe this is just your chance to prove what an incredible person you can be seeing as you have to rebuild yourself.. But I think you have the foundation down though, or at least have something solid to work with. Anyways I'm wishing you the best of luck!! And I think you're the real champ here

P. S. Sorry if that was a bit too much..."
