Entrepreneur,fem8xr4,t3_epvowb,1579244113.0,"Whenever you set your goal, set a reward that is proportional to the amount of revenue you generate.  Usually, I pick a project for the quarter, and then if I hit all my goals (and they should be uncomfortable or challenging goals), then I get the prize I set aside for myself.  I get to feel like I've earned it, so whatever it is, regardless of size, I relish it.  If I fail, it sucks, but I move the funds into some business related expense and reinvest.  Either way, I win.  I either have money in the bank and a lesson learned the difficult way, or I have a justly won prize.  Lifes a game.  Have fun with it :)"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdfxmo2,t3_el57mp,1578373041.0,"Congratulations on both discovering salads and making a huge investment toward a healthier future; that's awesome!  I'm on mobile, and can't seem to post a proper link for some reason, but try googling ""cooksmarts vinigerette infographic""   It should pull up a handy chart that beautifully and simply explains how a vinigerette is made(60% oil, 30% acids, 10% other flavors).  They go on to list some common ingredients used, and even throw in a couple recipes, but the formula is like magic and you can make a salad dressing that tastes amazing at a moment's notice with barely anything in your pantry.  And you can get very creative once you get the basics down.  Have fun!"

AskReddit,fdctayf,t1_fd9wnha,1578283708.0,"It's funny you should mention this.  I started hiking a trail at a comfortable pace once a week now since October.  I've had the past week off and was able to hike a whole bunch of places.  The extra hiking was enough to make me sore, but not nearly as much as I thought it would.  Today I went on my usual trail, but I did the entire thing at a fast pace, and even sprinted on a few stretches, with a backpack on.  Felt amazing!!!  I have always hated running but today for the first time I have started to see the appeal."

It's not hard, it's just not as instantly gratifying so we tell ourselves it's hard, but that's only true by comparison."
todayilearned,fd3ruh1,t1_fd0bs04,1578161123.0,"Money is a placeholder in our society for value.  Happiness has a lot to do with setting your values, goals, and priorities clearly in your life and then acting on them with commitment and consistency while enjoying the company of close friends and allies.  You help them with their goals, and they help you with yours.  Most people come out ahead, and the world is made a better place :)  Money is merely a small part of the equation and acts as a lubricant in the economic machine we've built to help us achieve our goals.  What really matters is what you DO with your money; with your accumulated value to society."

TwoXChromosomes,fchupw3,t1_fchsuin,1577654368.0,"Yep - that's what makes it a difficult situation.  Do I rock the boat by dealing with these uncomfortable feelings, or do I swallow it this time for the sake of peace?  You can only swallow so much bile before it makes you sick though.  Over time you learn where your line of healthy tolerance is and you get better and better at knowing when you need to make waves to protect yourself.  Then you focus on making those waves less destructive and more productive, but it's a lifelong process that never stops :)"
TwoXChromosomes,fchrule,t3_ehavdg,1577653465.0,"The adult thing to do, imho, is to talk to your friend and apologize for lying about your feelings about the blouse, let her know why you had a difficult time telling the truth (didn't want to hurt her feelings after an honest attempt at kindness and generosity toward you), and then tell her what the truth is in a way that communicates that it's not that you dislike HER gift, it's that you just can't seem to cultivate a desire for this color and that you hope she can be understanding about not seeing you wear it.  Let her know you were a little hurt by the fact that she didn't remember how much you disliked the color of the blouse.  Remember - you're not blaming her, you're just letting her know what happened, and how that made you feel from your perspective, and invite her to give her perspective.  You can find common ground by suggesting you both want the blouse to be with someone who does enjoy it, and then perhaps suggest donating the blouse to someone else and put the situation behind you.  If one or both of you starts to feel attacked or pressured, you might be tempted to respond emotionally from a place of insecurity.  Try to keep calm, and focus on the REAL goal - understanding how to be better friends to one another.  Misunderstandings happen in friendships all the time, and it's how you solve those problems that will make or break some relationships.  Think of this as a learning opportunity for developing skills to deal with difficult situations and difficult people - one of the most useful life skills you can develop!"
