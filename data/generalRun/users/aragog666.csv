minimalism,fejcl5x,t3_epetij,1579167288.0,"Could you elaborate more on why you have to get rid of stuff? It sounds like with some organization and using some space in the common areas, you could actually keep everything. Is there a reason you want it all to fit in one room?"

minimalism,fehmdod,t3_ep59ei,1579119480.0,I found a cute and surprisingly cheap set of 3 earrings at Banana Republic.
AskWomen,fehm0e5,t3_eoy958,1579119267.0,"I met him at work. I fell in love with him quickly, but it would not have happened if we both weren't working together so closely! We were able to talk and connect with each other which I don't think I would have done if I had to overcome the social barrier myself.

So I really do thank work for my relationship, in a way!"

facepalm,fedakxi,t1_fed4gtj,1579005780.0,"People can be very fucking stupid. I've been watching the YouTube channel Jubilee which organizes discussions between two disagreeing groups, and the one with flat earthers vs scientists made me lose faith in humanity."
LifeProTips,fed920b,t1_fecxqsv,1579004216.0,Listening 101! This LPT and this comment right here.
AskWomen,fed4yn2,t3_eofn21,1578999101.0,"I need to lose weight and have a huge belly, but until then, I like dark clothes that hide my belly. I feel great in black! I recently also bought a dress from Lulus that made me feel great when I wore it."

minimalism,fdebk39,t1_fde3hin,1578335431.0,">Minimalism, to me, isn’t necessarily about owning very little, it’s about owning just enough.

This is precisely why minimalism makes sense to me (I'm new to this idea). I didn't like the idea of not having all of my art materials, but the more I think about it, I can still own and use all of that stuff and still try to minimize clutter overall."
qatar,fddxrvq,t1_fddduip,1578326558.0,I'm only transiting through Qatar en route US. That's risky too?

I am flying Qatar Airways to US in a few weeks. Am I doomed?"
gatech,fcwyju5,t3_ejbfew,1578043165.0,"I understand where you're coming from. I truly hated interviewing, I was so bad at it and I was anxious every single time (I even made a post complaining about it). It's not a nice thing to look forward to.

When I had interviews scheduled in Cali, I had half a mind to bail because I didn't feel like going. I went anyway and got the offer even though I didn't think I'd actually get in, and kind of winged the interviews.

I get the feeling of not wanting to go, but maybe you could look at it as interview practice. Even though I couldn't get past any internship interviews last year, I feel like all the practice and exposure and pain I put myself through last year (and even this year) helped me in the end, as I was slightly less nervous every time and just going through the motions."

DunderMifflin,fc52e8p,t1_fc4c3b5,1577439568.0,Gotta feel for the Nard Dog. I liked him so much till they turned him into an a-hole in the last season.
