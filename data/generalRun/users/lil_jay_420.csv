When I experienced suicidal thoughts I would sit and imagine my mom finding me and that was enough for me to stop myself. Also if it’s my time it’s my time but I feel like it’s wrong to take matters into my own hands. Just feels like bad juju. On the other hand, I believe some people are genuinely in too much pain and truly feel there is no other option. While I do think that suicide is irrational, I do not necessarily think they are insane. If they are of sane mind, then at the end of the day it should be up to them."
offmychest,fgkd38n,t1_fgicrhh,1580862760.0,I was on hormonal birth control from 16-20 but the side effects from the hormones were so intense that it caused my anxiety and depression to become more debilitating. I am on the non hormonal iud now which is more effective that hormonal birth control.

offmychest,fgkb1q8,t1_fghyzci,1580861418.0,I never understood why someone my age would ever keep a child until I got pregnant myself. I finally understood but I knew what was best for myself and the implications of keeping the pregnancy
offmychest,fgkapde,t1_fgiw0bo,1580861195.0,"I got that as well! It is life changing as I have tended to have a terrible reaction to hormonal birth control. I knew there was a non hormonal iud but  I was afraid of the bad side effects my friends experienced. Luckily, I have not had any majorly inconvenient side effects. And I’m doing okay, still healing but I have an amazing support system. Sometimes I struggle with expressing how I feel but I’m working on it"

SeriousConversation,fen8xkw,t3_epyjyh,1579279548.0,"I’m 21, almost 22. Haven’t self harmed since I was 19. You will feel these urges randomly, especially at times of stress or change or even monotony. Acknowledge your feelings, try to figure out what your triggers may be and how to avoid them or learn to cope with them, and try your best not to act on them. It gets easier over time, I promise."
DoesAnybodyElse,fbhbe6r,t3_edc2rs,1576869678.0,"I went through periods of this when I was struggling with my mental health. A new tactic for me has been self care and that includes making an effort to look nice for myself; even if it’s little things like wearing booties instead of sneakers and jeans instead of leggings. I’ve also been dying my hair more and trying out new hairstyles. It’s difficult at first because it’s so easy to fall into old routines, but it gets easier everyday. Hope this helps out someone else"
