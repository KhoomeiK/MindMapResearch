AskReddit,fe733qb,t1_fe6tm16,1578909332.0,"If you're being genuine, it might be valuable to add that Thusly is a bit of a controversial word due to being unnecessary. Thus is already adverbial and the addition of -ly is redundant. From some scholarly perspectives its use sounds uneducated. I think a more moderate take on the word is that it's fine to use for flair, but only in certain contexts. 

For my own personal preferences, *thusly* only works when used at the end of a sentence that would otherwise use *thus* at the beginning. Example:

1. Thus we have a plan.

2. We have a plan, thusly.

It feels odd either way, and is certainly still technically incorrect, but seems a bit more excusable in this format. Maybe because of cadence. I think it's fine to use conversationally but just be aware that use of the word has a long history of being mocked... And could possibly even have originated as a tongue in cheek jab at uneducated people feigning intellect. I'm not suggesting that *I* associate it with that. Merely establishing historical context.

Stupid animals are easy to train and domesticate. Smart animals are unruly and unpredictable.

The most basic understanding of evolution shows that our species only exists and has consistently survived and evolved via the smartest of us carrying on to breed while the dumbest die early. So if you want power, of the magnitude to domesticate the majority of your own species, you must breed them like any other domesticated animal- to be large, dependent, stupid and docile. 

In a position of leadership you inevitably lead by example. And in a position of great wealth and fortune you amass envy and mimicry. So the smartest thing to do is to act stupid. It's training. And cyclical and self-enforcing to boot. You're not paying attention to basic evolution if you don't believe in evolution. ""Look at all these people living the life you wish you had! They don't read like nerds! They don't need science! They *buyyyy stuff*. You can have that life too. You're so special and unique and important.

AskReddit,fdva7fc,t1_fdv3dh1,1578745263.0,"I don't know honestly. I'm not trying to put myself above the man. Lol. And honestly even though she's kind of a shit actress for dramatic roles, no one could have done much with that writing. I'm almost tempted to say Natalie Portman just because she has a real knack for bland, passable performances of one-note characters.

I don't think casting generally works as just ""pick someone you like!"" You'd need screentests and whatnot. Though I guess my argument is that's exactly what he seems to do. So I suppose I'd either want someone with less of a recognizable personality, like Naomi Watts or Amy Adams... Fitting Nolan's penchant for ""eh who's popular right now. Alright she's attractive that'll do.""... Or someone with better dramatic chops that could be a believable scientist like (I can't believe I'm saying this) Hillary Swank (someone he's used before, poorly) or Andrea Riseborough or Rachel Weisz. 

With a different take on the role as written I could see Alexandria Daddario or Kate Winslet or Mary Elizabeth Winstead all bringing vastly different qualities to the character. Maybe Jennifer Jason Leigh (at least she's closer in age to her costar.) Rebecca Hall could have been a good fit, and a recurring castmember which he seems to like doing.

But like I said the character itself is a bigger problem than the actress. Nolan movies never have very well written female characters.

Other examples of poorly written and developed and/or cast characters in his movies:

Rachel Dawes in the batman films. Fucking Katie Holmes? Seriously? Maggie Gyllenhaal is a better actress, but just comes off as doing a goofy Katie Holmes impression. Thank god they killed her off halfway through.

Scarjo in the prestige, despite being probably the most attractive she's ever been on screen, just a very empty, one-note character. Also Rebecca Hall, god blesser, gave it her best with that dialogue.

Anne Hathaway in DKR was surprisingly good, I went in expecting to hate it but the movie around her was so bad that she ended up being one of the highlights lol. So I guess that's a pass. But still, if that movie had been up to the standard of the other two in the series I don't think she would have pulled it off.

Carrie Anne Moss in Memento is a perfect example of a careless ""who's selling tickets these days"" casting. She was fine. But an obvious casting by name recognition without really giving a shit.

Hillary Swank in Insomnia was mediocre for some of it and just awful in the rest. Hadn't quite hit her stride yet.

Jessica Chastain in Interstellar was also not great. Better than Hathaway. But if you just wanted hot redhead who's in big movies right now you shoulda gone with Bryce Dallas Howard. Wayyy more convincing as an emotionally damaged daughter character.

And worst of all is Marion Cotillard or however you spell it. Like... You learn to accept her in Inception, and it has the weird dream excuse. But Jesus she's terrible in everything and it's so blatantly obvious that he only casts her in shit cause she makes his willy tingle.

I love the guy's work. But dialogue and actor direction are not his strong suits at all. 70% bad writing, 20% miscasting, 10% bad acting that can't be blamed on direction. But it's fine and doesn't ruin any of the films. Just becomes a trademark kinda. He's all heady themes and cinematography and editing anyways. Definitely not a character study kinda guy."

AskReddit,fduyi9r,t1_fdunlvb,1578741011.0,"Not downvoting, but I do disagree slightly. I feel like it's a pretty 50/50 split when it comes to Nolan opinions. You're definitely not alone in that sentiment. I'm an enormous fan and count him among the greatest craftsmen of medium, but even I admit he gets sloppy from time to time.

I also find that occasional sloppiness forgivable in the context of what he accomplishes. 

It's easy to point to Nolan films in retrospect and feel like the gimmicks are passe, contrived, even played out. Partially because they're overdone within a couple of years. But it's important to recall the time in which each one is released. He is often groundbreaking in such a way that it's not terribly showy (despite one of the most common criticisms being his excessive spectacle) but immediately alters the course of popular media as a whole. Usually in a bad way because people copy the surface level techniques without the art to back them up.

Inception is the worst offender as far as unnecessarily convoluted details and inconsistencies and things that make no sense... But the context of the film allows all of that to make sense. It's a dream. It's purposely nonsensical, and I think it amazingly walked the tightrope of being just realistic enough to make the parts that don't make sense just the right amount of overlookable... But still noticable. 

In a more meta sense he has also mastered the craft of ""big budget art"". Somehow he makes these films that are truly cinematic, visually and artistically impressive, thematic and contemplative, but commercially successful. It's impressive. The ability to strike a balance between broad appeal and artistic integrity. Putting popcorn munchers in seats but still making respectable cinema.

I'm not saying the guy is a god or the best filmmaker ever. But he is absolutely an auteur. The one opinion I share that pisses people off the most is that I think he does what Tarantino is critically praised for better than Tarantino, and never gets mentioned for it. That being post-modernism. He's remixing art. All of his films borrow heavily from and pay homage to great classics in film and literature. Creating something new from pieces of the old. It's brilliantly done and will likely be the focus of art courses in the future. But because it's so transformative and not as blatant as Tarantino's pop culture heavy on-the-nose referencial style (I'm not bashing Tarantino here, apples and oranges really) it either gets overlooked or called ""ripping off"" by people who entirely missed the point.

There's a risk of going all Rick and Morty about it. You don't have to be a genius to understand his movies. It's not that people who don't like them just ""didn't get it."" That's the whole thing he takes these pure, high art concepts and reshapes them into digestible modern works that please the studios and fit the market while introducing a lot of the audience to film themes they might not otherwise be exposed to, only going out to see Star Wars and Transformers.

But it's also not for everyone. He values emotional reacting, epic scale, and experimentation with time and format. That's not every film enthusiast's cup of tea. It just happens to suit my tastes quite well. From that perspective I feel like its a bit unfair to call him a high brow JJ Abrams. But I wouldn't take issue with calling JJ Abrams a low brow Nolan."

AskReddit,fdusn0t,t1_fdu9ohz,1578738184.0,"Only speaking for myself I feel like subsequent viewing add less in terms of story that was missed (the film does an excellent job of being clear with its themes upfront) but provides tons of insight to the craft that went into it.

I recall the first screening of Inception solidifying that ""lingering unease"" that is a Hallmark of Nolan films for me. Every one of them leaves me in a contemplative state for a long time immediately after leaving the theater. I guess technically even Dark Knight Rises... Although that was just contemplating how the fuck it was so bad.

Anyways, I think I got the most out of Inception on the second theatrical viewing because I understood the format better. I was in a bit of shock the first time because I went in expecting something a bit more visually psychedelic. Humorously there's even a line in the movie addressing it. 

>I guess I thought the dream-space would be all about the visual, but it's more about the feeling. My question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it.

Tied to that, it was also the film where I started to really understand the relationship with Zimmer and Nolan's use of score to manipulate emotion (something some ""purists"" frown on, but one of my favorite parts of the science of cinema.) The genius of using a hyperstretched version of the kick theme as the score (the famous BWAMMMMM sound being the first note of the Edith Pilaf song used in-world) serving to not only break the fourth wall in a subtle way that subconsciously creates an addition ""layer"" of dreams in which the viewer is the dreamer... But also inciting a dreamlike state using trance-inducing multiplicative frequencies and interesting syncing techniques.

I think Interstellar was possibly his most aggressive use of the manipulative scoring tactics. Sadly the home release is remastered to diminish the effects. But on opening night in Imax I was concerned that something was wrong in my theater due to how deafening the soundtrack was right out of the gate. And recall hearing a lot of complaints about it online afterwards. But by the end of Coop's dream sequence I was aware of what he was doing and settled in with a grin. ( https://youtu.be/TFg7wHj0cJc )  This scene. If you listen with headphones or some boosted bass you'll notice the rumbling sub-harmonics that persist even when the music stops. In the theatrical Imax master, that bass was a lot louder. It set the tone for the whole movie, as that bass sound continues at varying degrees from the first second of the film until coop ejects into the black hole. Offering 30 seconds of near silence (with the exception of Coop's labored breath) for the first time since frame one. Before thrusting you into the insanity of the final act.

Absolute fucking mastery. The only time in my life I've ever truly been ""on the edge of my seat"" in a literal sense. The sound design combined with the slight deviation from traditional act structure... Which should have had film literate audience members suspecting that we were already in the final act and the film was about to end (happening at exactly 2:20 after a technically solid traditional 3 acts), and probably a bit disappointed that we didn't explore the black hole... Enhanced even more by the fact that the film had mostly steered clear of Nolan's trademark non-linear storytelling so far... As far as we knew at that point.

Point being, rewatching Inception (which I have at least 10 times by now) can definitely lead to a real solid answer to the question of whether or not he's dreaming, but that's pretty easy to decipher and not meant to be the point anyways. However it's always entertaining to pickup subtle details in the craftsmanship of filmmaking going on there, if not so much in the way of missed plot details. With every viewing I notice at least one thing I didn't notice before, a ""brush stroke"" if you will. So I guess I'd say it's less like rewatching a movie to find story, and more like admiring a painting in a gallery."

SuicideWatch,fdpiajn,t1_fdph8se,1578629372.0,"I really like the way you put that. ""Making my sadness your problem."" 

I do honestly believe that a lot of people contemplating suicide are coming from a selfish place of *wanting* to inflict sadness. A vengeful suicide with the intention of making people feel bad about the way they treated them. But alternatively I think many people struggle with wanting to die for their own benefit but not wanting to hurt anyone in the process.

I'm very lucky to have shouldered the burden of being the one who experienced all the loss and finally being in a place where there's no one left to mourne my passing. Which to say, gets an instinctual reaction that is inaccurate. It's a very positive thing. I'm also fortunate to have had the time and collect the resources to be able to handle it in such a way that shouldn't so much as inconvenience anyone. Just disappear and never even have found remains for anyone to clean up. All goodbyes said. No mysteries or confusion. 

But that's incredibly difficult for most people to orchestrate and can be saddening. So that frustration with being bound by responsibility to not hurt people who likely contribute to your pain (whether intentional or not) can be overwhelming enough on a personal scale. Strangers piling on with guilt trips is just impossible to process.

Anyways I'm getting off topic here.

I appreciate being entertained in my confusion with the wording here and I think I have a better understanding now so thank you. I don't comment on many posts anyways but apologies in advance if I do in the future in a way that comes of to some as ""cold"" or even ""encouraging"".

TwoXChromosomes,fdpcp22,t1_fdp8et6,1578625310.0,"I recently deleted a thread trying to talk about this in another sub. I just kept getting life advice and lots of ""well you put yourself in those situations"" replies, which proved my point but also I wasn't seeking therapy I was trying to draw attention to the amount of sexual assault against men by women.

I'll spare the detailed recounts but from my own life experience and from talking to a lot of other men my age (25-40) roughly 50% of our sexual experiences were unwanted. It's extremely common for men to have sex when they don't want to out of pressure, as it seems to be for women as well. But the aggressiveness of said pressure seems to be greater and more frequent coming from women among this age group and younger- likely due to cultural shaming of aggressive male advances and lack of that same responsibility on women.

The moment that made me want to make the post was the most recent event where a girl was forcing herself on me, trying to make out, biting me, and grabbing my genitals so hard that I was in pain while I was at first begging her to stop and then physically trying to remove her hand and forcibly demanding that she stop (but afraid to fight back too hard and leave bruises on her.) All of this sitting at a crowded bar, very embarassing, and no one said a thing.

I guess everyone wanted to give me advice because all the stories sounded very traumatic and upsetting but the whole point I was making is that it's a very normal and common occurrence. I'm not even horribly bothered by it, just annoyed. Like ""god damnit here we go again."" And not just to me. (So you can reserve your lectures about ""those kinds of girls"".) I see it all the time, out in public, working in bars and restaurants. As a kid at parties.

I also told a story about a time that I was raped and then publicly doxxed to thousands of people and accused of being a serial rapist, not even by the girl involved but by her friend.

Another all too common thing.

All of this is just to say that men face plenty of sexual assault and even rape as well. It may look different. And it's certainly less common to be violently raped as man (but does still happen, not just perpetrated by other men.) And the gross rally cry of divisionist polarism ""men vs women"" (like that most popularly espoused by the girl who told everyone she could I was a rapist after her friend raped me) just leads to a bunch of rape victims sitting around being told they're the problem... And alienates and disenfranchises a whole host of potential advocates for cultural change. Because people ""fighting"" for said change don't want to acknowledge their own complicity.

It's a human issue far before being a gendered one."

SuicideWatch,fdp9isa,t1_fdp834g,1578623156.0,"You may be correct. You're obviously more educated on the specific situation than I am. From a statistics standpoint it seems unlikely that regardless of how many subreddits may have been started (likely by the same people) there is a larger number of people that are *not* part of that community. I don't doubt that they're active, just that they're they're the majority.

As far as condoning and supporting the right to suicide, we'll seemingly just have to agree that we disagree... Because I've lost track of the argument there. I think there are plenty of good reasons to kill oneself. I think I have a pretty solid case myself. I still acknowledge that most cases are not good reasons to do it... But if a stranger is telling me they've come to that decision it would be offensive for me to assume they're in the wrong. I don't see another respectful way to approach it than to assume they're right from the get go and hope that they'll share with me what their reasoning is. It just seems offensive to enter a conversation with someone who just wants to share what's going on, with the intent to ""educate"" them or change their mind. I think we generally agree on the sentiment here and just maybe disagree on the application, which is fine.

It's not my subreddit and I'm not trying to be defiant or change the rules or anything.

The major point of all this was just that as someone who is going to commit suicide, I'm absolutely not interested at all in hearing about why I shouldn't from someone who knows nothing about me. But I'm happy to talk to someone who's not on some morality mission and is just interested in having a chat about it all.

I don't want anyone to kill themselves. I don't want anyone to die. I don't want anyone to suffer. But I'm not in charge, and don't know everything. All I know is if I can provide a listening ear without the subtext of hidden motivation, well that's likely the best I can do for someone. God knows if they need someone to try to talk them out of it, there's plenty of people already doing it that are probably for more qualified than me to do it."

Which is ironically very relevant to what I was saying about being annoyed by the way people discuss politics. Everyone wants to take the smallest amount of information they can gleam about your identity and instantly fabricate an entire belief structure for you that they can argue with and educate. Like some kind of scarecrow to beat up... Like a man made of straw.

Some level of socialism is inevitable and I didn't identify myself as a Libertarian (the word that seems most likely to have triggered your response despite the disclaimer) but rather said that's where someone else would stick me if they got a basic overview of my ideals- ideals don't always line up with realistic applications, btw.

I'm not going to get siderailed into a debate over a point I wasn't even making here. But I'll say that individual freedoms and civil rights are very compatible with basic social infrastructure and minimal regulation that serves to prevent rather than govern. The abstract of what I was saying there is that I find people who identify as hyper liberal have unrealistic expectations of micromanaging everyone via legislation that only leads to totalitarian rule, while people that identify as hyper conservative seem to have absurdly self-defeating desires to remove any social safety and focus entirely on oppression. And both sides are just cheering for theft from themselves.

Reducing military spending could easily provide money a basic quality of life for citizens. But we don't need to enforce legal morality either.

Anyways, I'm sure anyone who's itching for a fight will easily mischaracterize what I'm saying here as well and revel in the opportunity to ""lel u so dum let me tell you wut u didnt ask about dum kid"" but I don't really give a shit.

My whole point was that regardless of your political views there is absolutely no sane or justifiable way to endorse Donald Trump with any dignity unless you outright honestly represent yourself as a hateful, misanthropic idiot. Beyond politics. Just from basic morality. I'm not saying anyone else is a saint or even that that aren't greater evils. But the guy is an idiot, a failure, an embarrassment and universally offensive to the senses as well as sensibility.

AskReddit,fdp3ujt,t1_fdp0mjn,1578619363.0,"This is my conundrum. I hate identity politics. I hate bipartisan politics. Frankly anyone that voluntarily labels themselves Republican or Democrat, or uses the words Liberal or Conservative in daily conversation just immediately gets flagged as a fucking dipshit in my brain. For as long as I can remember I've cringed at the ""football"" attitude towards politics. Blue team vs Red team and ""our team is the best and if you support the other team I genuinely want you to die"" (you're not on the fucking team retard.)

However if I had to place myself on the absurd political spectrum I fall into what people used to mean when they said Libertarian (not the modern ""secret society of GOP and KKK"" definition.) Less federal power, less military spending, less legislation, fewer restrictive laws... But more humanities and infrastructure and social services and regulation over monopoly and corruption. Basically a focus on municipalities and American citizens. Treating the federal government as a military defense strategy that exists primarily to pool resources from a ""United States"" in the event of an emergency, and setting basic human rights and business laws but otherwise staying the fuck out of everyone's business.

Which boils down to I'm annoyed by everyone trying to regulate everyone else I just want everybody to fuck off. Bunch of crybabies, the lot of ya.

But I apparently come off very ""conservative"" in basic conversation (probably mostly because I'm a bald white male, sadly, more than anything I actually say.)

I despise Clinton and can't take anyone who supported her seriously... But that's doubly true for Trump. I'll admit that when he was running I was thinking ""if he actually won, maybe it wouldn't be so bad. Maybe this is a bit. Maybe it would be better than the alternative.""

AWLIAS,fdmxtcy,t1_fdmwu56,1578570601.0,Lol that's a great subreddit. Thanks for the suggestion.
SuicideWatch,fdmxqdt,t1_fdmwtpj,1578570507.0,"You're right. These rules 99% seem rational and well researched and make sense. The issue that I was raising was in relation to the implications, and perhaps better described as a lack of specificity about- the implications of likelihood that someone ""condoning"" suicidal ideation may be secretly inciting suicide. The cited sources help to create a potential inflated perception of this type of behavior. I do appreciate your rational response, and would like to add that I in no way assume to have any greater level of insight on the matter than anyone else. My training is limited relative to specialized psychiatric and psychological expertise, and I can see that the experience involved here is substantial.

I didn't mean to suggest that there is a point of no return, I'm struggling to figure out which statement made that impression. I will venture a guess that it was the remark about an internet comment being blamed for being the deciding factor for someone to kill themselves. If that's the point in question, I'd suggest that I meant quite the opposite. That I don't believe that kind of negative reinforcement (unless prolonged and excessive while being sought after and encouraged by the victim) wields a significant power in the decision making process, but adversely a comment of the same weight can have a real effect in dissuasion. 

My argument was merely that condoning, understanding, and accepting someone's decision to kill themselves- acknowledging that they have thought it through to the fullest extent- can be the catalyst of meaningful assistance in reevaluating options and self-assessing mental state. And the worst outcome of it is at the very least providing some respect and dignity in a person's final moments.

Whereas this seems to suggest that any acknowledgement or approval of someone's decision equates to encouragement. But I may be misreading. If so, the lack of clarity there may be worth addressing. Suicide advocacy is not inherently driven by evil as often as empathy.

SuicideWatch,fdms13y,t3_cz6nfd,1578562923.0,"Huh. I think I've broken the rules. I agree with a lot of this and appreciate the research put into it but I think this misses the mark in a couple places. Why would someone come to a subreddit for suicidal people to talk about their suicide, and actively avoid the more squishy, positivity oriented spaces that exist?

1. To share their final thoughts with anyone they can.

2. To explore the ideations of other suicidals, likely because they're not entirely convinced yet and still debating it.

3. To empathize or find empathy with other people feeling the same way.

Not to be blatantly talked out of it. Strangers trying to fix your depression is annoying af. And the fact that people only passively want you to stay alive for their own personal peace of mind but don't actually give a shit about you beyond that is usually a factor in what has led them to this point to begin with.

Not only do I think there's nothing wrong with talking to someone about suicide while explicitly reassuring them that you're not interested in stopping them from doing it. I think that approaching someone who has made up their mind as though they're a fully functional adult who has likely put sufficient consideration into their decisions and doesn't owe you an explanation or opportunity to debate their reasoning can disarm the apprehension towards apathetic virtue signaling and allow said suicide risk's mind a bit of ease and relaxation that can be vital in one last critical analysis of their decisions... Which may well lead to a reconsideration. 

It's ok to just be there for another human being without trying to manipulate them into conforming to some societal standard.

1. I know the feeling of a lack of ceremony for someone you feel deserved more. My father passed earlier this year and after my mother passing our family became very fractured. There were only a few people to even tell about it, and they were scattered all over. Not enough people to bother with a funeral. Had a small ""remembrance"" on a beach with a bunch of strangers that was awkward and probably didn't make anyone feel better.

But, dad would have reminded me that it didn't bother him. Because he was dead. So he didn't care. Lol. I tried my best to do something for his other kids and the couple of people who seemed to be very distraught publicly. But no one could be inconvenienced to participate. Because the distress is for them, it's something to display to earn sympathy. Which leads me to 

2. As sad as it may seem to not have a great parade in their honor after they pass. They're already gone, and not bothered by it. Funerals are for those left behind and should fit the needs of the living. And I would much rather see peace and quiet than a garish, disrespectful abuse of tragedy that can be quite common. It used to infuriate me when a kid in highschool would die in a car wreck or something and suddenly they were everyone's best friend. Everyone has a bunch of made up stories about them. It's an opportunity to get a spotlight. ""Oh I loved him so much"" no you didn't, you were an asshole the one time you ever spoke to him. Fuck off. There's a phenomenal representation of this in the Robin Williams movie ""World's Greatest Dad.""

3. You can honor your friend's memory in a more meaningful way all on your own. It doesn't need to be spectacle. I recommend writing her a letter with everything you wish you could say. Have a quiet night with a fire, maybe some other mutual friends if possible? Think about some good times, and burn the letter. It can be very therapeutic. You can keep that memory alive in you.

4. On the note of photographs and stuff. If you can get them that's awesome. If not, it's okay too. I know it hurts. But it's just things. I do understand. I lost my girlfriend last Christmas. I have no idea where she was burried, if she was burried. There's no eulogy. And I can't find out due to a complicated thing I won't get into. Had to mourne entirely in private. Then I was robbed as was away taking care of my father. They stole my computer and backup hard drives with all of my photos and videos and digital memories. Everything. All I had left. Everyone I ever loved is gone and all I had was old photos and videos to refer to. Now those are gone too.

That was really hard to come to terms with. I nearly went insane (and broke) trying to get them back. But in the end I had to let go and just rely on my memories.

I know that's not super comforting. But the message is simply that you will be okay, and not to stress yourself out over keepsakes. The actual moments you had together were what mattered.

The H3 podcast should have remained, and still should try to return to being, a platform podcast. Youtube and youtuber centric. With a focus on doing collabs with guests for content to put on the seemingly abandoned main channel, as well as the guest's channel.

The roads, and the vehicles are designed to be used this way. You are not only inconveniencing others, but creating unnecessary hazards for yourself and everyone around you.

I have no background for your beef with this other character. And there are certainly cases when driving in the left lane for a short time is appropriate. But as a general rule, on any road with more than one lane, your are meant to stay right whenever possible unless you are about to turn left. It is not difficult to shift left to pass and then shift back to the right once past any traffic moving slower than you. It's not your job to police the speed of the left lane and all you're doing by riding in it is creating traffic. 

Your argument that people can pass you on the right is asinine. It is dangerous and ill advised to pass on the right. Forcing others to do that is akin to parking like an asshole so that everyone else has to park weird around you, then you leave and everyone left behind looks like a dick because of you.

Equally asinine is your assertion that ""not technically breaking the law"" is somehow equal in your mind to ""upholding the law."" 

Anyone who rides in the left lane is inarguably rude, and a bad driver. As every single person who can be certifiably referred to as a skilled driver will attest. As a professional driver for 15+ years with 20 years on the road and over a million miles under my belt, I feel confident that no one who knows what they're doing approves of what you're saying, regardless of whether or not you can be ticketed for it.

(Worth noting that in my experience driving across the country Denver is my second worst city to drive in. The kind of city, like New Orleans, where you have to drive like an asshole just to survive the imbalance of assholes on the road.)"

In both directions.

Every relationship issue I've had stems from a lack of communication. To the point where establishing a groundwork for positive communication is my number one goal in a relationship.

So many girls I've seen in the last few years will talk and talk and talk just repeating the same shit ad nauseam... About anything but what's going on between us. As soon as it becomes an issue with us, the flood gates close. I can only assume you're telling someone else everything you should be telling me.

But also, most of those same girls don't listen to a word I say, if I can manage to get one in edgewise. Unless I'm talking about you, or whatever you're ranting about, you're not interested. It's a narcissism thing really. But I'm just amazed at how many of the girls I've dated know absolutely NOTHING about me, despite me having told them things repeatedly. I've even been accused of hiding things and lying just because they never paid attention. I'm sure it's shocking when we've been dating for 3 months and you just figured out that I had a kid, or that my whole family is dead, or that I used to be moderately famous in something that matters to you, or that I'm dying and spend 20+ hours a week at the hospital... But I promise I've talked about it a lot when you were pretending to console me waiting for your turn to cry about how a boy was mean to you once."

Seems like every year it gets harder and harder to find a setting in which films are watchable on new tvs. Even with everything turned off that I can find in advanced settings some TVs still suffer from a bit of ""soap opera"". It's really frustrating. Who in the world wants this on anything but a gaming monitor?"
