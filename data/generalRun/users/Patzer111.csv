detroitlions,ffv47h4,t3_ev9z7p,1580255281.0,"No, it’s actually a more consistent point of view than you’re making it sound. You can both: 
1. Wish the Lions didn’t suck
2. Out of frustration because they suck wish they would lose and get a top pick. 

When you hear people complaining about how they suck, they are expressing viewpoint 1. When they want the Lions to draft Chase Young, which is smart, not trade down, which is dopey, that’s perspective 2. You can definitely hold both opinions simultaneously. You don’t always have to be black or white about things."
