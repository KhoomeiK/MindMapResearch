AskReddit,fcx5rfp,t3_ejdoqg,1578052385.0,"World war will only happen if us decides to try and take allies in north africa and we know russian don't like that plus now us is P.E after trump doing some idiotic stuff
But its hardly a ww3 because the one who will benefit from iran going down is Israel as they are looking to expand their land in the middle east ( its like the us will indirectly attack Palestinian in the name of war casualties )

Worst case scenario is middle east countries get demolished ( except saudi Arabia ) the us conquer north africa ( timing to what's happening in Libya ) but in doing so they will lose many troops and the us people will stop obeying the drafting order since they know its bad

Russia china north korea Turkey they will all take part in it 

china will fear the us troops climb up 

Russia will fear china will try to escalate 

North korea dosnt care but he love to flex his muscles 

Turkey the perfect opportunity to continue their agenda of serving the jews

Since iran is hated and considered not muslims ( almost 99% are shia that they killed and chased down muslims from thier lands ) middle eastern countries will side with the us - not like they have a choice -

Us will suffer some minorities in bombing or killings here and there but nothing to bad

After all this shenanigans us take control over middle east russia and china go at it along side korea

North africa rebel and unite to try and do something

Rest of europe just chilling enjoying the view

If and only if they us try to brut force iran and other countries in the middle  east it will have a negative effect on the us as the middle east will get troops from north african countries - but this is a long shot so far as muslims are in shambles right now - 

Tldr :

So in conclusion 

Us : only troop casualties and equipment in iran, while minior bombings and victims in the home land

Russia : will only react if china tried to pull of some stuff

North Korea : will follow anything ( looking for drama )

West Europe : just chilling as they are in their own problems going on ( maybe they will try reasoning but who are we kidding us control everything )

Eastern Europe : if they are pressed from both sides then they will react

Middle east : ofc all allies to the us ( enemy of my enemy is my friend but the problem the us is also the enemy ) 

North Africa : will interact directly if the us or russia or Turkey goes to Libya

Israel: ofc they will get a massive land to work with since now iran done their job and no longer needed

Ww3 not likely to happen because of awareness maybe if something happens out of the bleu 

After all im just giving an opinionated view"

And its a preference to be honest some people like it different as for me i played it vanilla and now when using mods i feel its much better maybe in the future they will balance somethings or we wait for the w4 ( hyped can't lie )

AskReddit,fcx5rfp,t3_ejdoqg,1578052385.0,"World war will only happen if us decides to try and take allies in north africa and we know russian don't like that plus now us is P.E after trump doing some idiotic stuff
But its hardly a ww3 because the one who will benefit from iran going down is Israel as they are looking to expand their land in the middle east ( its like the us will indirectly attack Palestinian in the name of war casualties )

Worst case scenario is middle east countries get demolished ( except saudi Arabia ) the us conquer north africa ( timing to what's happening in Libya ) but in doing so they will lose many troops and the us people will stop obeying the drafting order since they know its bad

Russia china north korea Turkey they will all take part in it 

china will fear the us troops climb up 

Russia will fear china will try to escalate 

North korea dosnt care but he love to flex his muscles 

Turkey the perfect opportunity to continue their agenda of serving the jews

Since iran is hated and considered not muslims ( almost 99% are shia that they killed and chased down muslims from thier lands ) middle eastern countries will side with the us - not like they have a choice -

Us will suffer some minorities in bombing or killings here and there but nothing to bad

After all this shenanigans us take control over middle east russia and china go at it along side korea

North africa rebel and unite to try and do something

Rest of europe just chilling enjoying the view

If and only if they us try to brut force iran and other countries in the middle  east it will have a negative effect on the us as the middle east will get troops from north african countries - but this is a long shot so far as muslims are in shambles right now - 

Tldr :

So in conclusion 

Us : only troop casualties and equipment in iran, while minior bombings and victims in the home land

Russia : will only react if china tried to pull of some stuff

North Korea : will follow anything ( looking for drama )

West Europe : just chilling as they are in their own problems going on ( maybe they will try reasoning but who are we kidding us control everything )

Eastern Europe : if they are pressed from both sides then they will react

Middle east : ofc all allies to the us ( enemy of my enemy is my friend but the problem the us is also the enemy ) 

North Africa : will interact directly if the us or russia or Turkey goes to Libya

Israel: ofc they will get a massive land to work with since now iran done their job and no longer needed

Ww3 not likely to happen because of awareness maybe if something happens out of the bleu

And right now vayen isnt played because there is kaisa and xayah that are self peeling and dish out some good damage ( when playing in a team ofc ) vayen as  solo she out damage every adc and duel anyone 

The point is vayen have a very good damage and few other champion can keep up with her for example azir is not a constant damage dealer if you go on cd well nothing much you can do but vayen is consistent
