Sorry I didn't really say much this time. I've been kinda busy and I don't really have any more helpful ""advice"", if that's what you wanna call it. If I do, I don't remember it right now."
teenagers,ffnn01l,t3_eu9uow,1580068072.0,"You still haven't asked her out? If your ever gonna do it, do it while watching shrek. Everyone knows that shrek 1 is the most romantic movie ever made. At least do it during one of the shrek movies though. She seems to think your funny right? Asking her out during shrek might make her like you even more."

What I don't like about that is that no one will reply to it. I like talking to people who can somewhat relate to me. I hate that they do relate because depression sucks, but I feel like I'm not alone. I guess I like working towards a goal. A real goal. Not just type something down. On this sub my goal is to relate with people. Some what."

depression,ffb7csd,t1_ffb6ssp,1579753809.0,Thanks. My hand writing is horrible though. Sometimes I can barely read it. I don't think writing on paper would help. Then I'd criticize myself on my hand writing at home too.

And your school has gaming club? The closest my school has to that is anime club! Gaming club? I wish I went to your school. You spend more time with your crush than most people. You need to ask her out. I've given you all the advice I can think of. Not much else I can tell you other than ask her out. I might think of something else in the morning though (its almost 2:00 for me). Because I don't know your crush myself I can't give you advice thar I know will help. Good luck though!"

teenagers,fewmsn8,t1_fewlwyo,1579415011.0,"You def got a big chance dude. I don't think your too freind zoned yet. Try not to got too far though. That might be the hardest thing when asking a girl out. There's basically no to stop it or reverse it. Only slow it down until you ask her out. You should do it soon though. If you feel confident enough, lean in for a kiss after you ask her out. Or just do it out of nowhere while cuddling. Might be best not to immediately though. Your still lucky as shit though. I honestly wish I was you. Maybe you could try to pull the good ol' ""I just shit my pants, can I get yours?"" move. Works every time. How often do you hang out with her? If she wants to hang out with you all the time you might have an even bigger chance. It sounds like you hang out a lot"
teenagers,fewlc8d,t1_fewkyxq,1579413477.0,Aight. You def got a chance then. If not all of them sound fake that's even better. It means she actually likes your jokes and isn't just doing it to let you know she likes you (assuming she does). Have you noticed her sneak looks at you during class (assuming you have some of the same classes). Watch for that and look at her body language when she talks to you. Especially the body language.
teenagers,fewkut0,t1_fewkgne,1579413002.0,"You better ask her out then. I'll be pissed if you don't. You have a huge chance if she's that comfortable around you. Do any of her laughs sound fake by any chance? If so that means shes super into you usually. Like I said I will be pissed if you don't ask her out. You better do it, or else."
teenagers,fewk5oo,t1_fewjt56,1579412381.0,"You better do it. Sometimes girls like you even more when your good friends. Maybe she even plans to ask you out! Unless she talks about a dude she likes to you. If so you might have been friend zoned. Maybe she's just trying to make you jealous though. Still, take the chance of asking her out. If she says no, oh well. Maybe you two can still be friends. If she says ""I don't know"" and rarely talks to you after that for a couple of weeks, then I don't know what to tell you, because I still don't have an answer."
