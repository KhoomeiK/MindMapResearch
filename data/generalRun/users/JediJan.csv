JusticeServed,fecnjkg,t1_febeq7x,1578978389.0,That’s not her story.  “I just gave him a hug to say be nice and I fell Mum.”
creepy,feck3os,t1_fecjzcb,1578975846.0,"Well I have heard of instances of children being hurt, or worse, in these places.  Children have even been killed digging sand tunnels which collapsed on beaches, sucked into drains etc.

Here is an article about a boy who was sucked into a fountain’s drain, lucky to be alive, in the city square in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.  I remember that incident all too well.

creepy,fecc5ho,t3_enzxwd,1578970518.0,Report it to authorities so they can seal off the entrance.  Children can enter and have accidents etc.
instantkarma,fecayvy,t1_febfkhy,1578969861.0,"I upvoted you actually; can you check.  He did not say in any way assault was (or was not) okay but just commented to identify the person who was hit and his affiliation.  Why identify the person who was hit?  Anyone reading that can easily assume the commenter thought it was justified or okay.

I dislike Nazis as much as the next person but we live in a free speech community, so we have to put up with idiots like them from time to time.  Years ago I walked past some Irish demonstration in Melbourne, Australia.  Aggressive guy there was shouting “Kill the English” and other such offensive and aggressive language.  No Police visible at the time but I think he went too far also.  I don’t dislike Irish at all, some are friends too, but I certainly did not like him; he was obviously asking for confrontation but people walked past and ignored him."

Personally if humans were all so multi- coloured there would probably be less discrimination.  Then again ... humans find plenty of other things to discriminate about I guess."
