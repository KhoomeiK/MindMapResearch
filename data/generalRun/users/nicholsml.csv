wikipedia,fcilaec,t1_fcgr1x9,1577664465.0,"> I'm sure you've heard the story of Abraham Wald and how he decided to put armour on the engines of planes rather than the wings.

Not what you asked for, but throwing this out there since this is my jam!

Even though Wald's story is a myth about survivor bias.... it has some merits even if the story is surrounded by myth. I spent well over a decade in Army aviation and dealt with a lot of shot up aircraft and even recovered aircraft shot down. I was one of the few airframe structure mechanics to ever get to work on the JRTC hind in Louisiana. If you armor anything, make it the bare minimum, pilot and engines/turbine, otherwise you end up with a cumbersome beast.

The biggest problem with putting armor on aircraft is weight, because less weight is king. If you armor everything you have an aircraft that is barely useful. Without armor bullets of any caliber wizz right through aircraft from almost any angle or placement. The survival tool for getting through a black hawk is basically a hatchet because it's 99% 32 thousandths 2024 T3 aluminum sheets. Russians went with armoring everything with the Hind which was a huge mistake. I know people love the Hind but It made the aircraft slow and over weight. You would think that it would be the correct way to go but it isn't. Turns out going fast and being maneuverable helps aircraft, especially rotary wing, survive much better than taking it to the face. This isn't just important for small arms, but also for flare and chaff. If someone fires a missile, you don't just fire it off and survive, it's important to throw chaff and scoot, either forward or up.

Too much weight is a killer. For example, with black hawks. The only real armored parts of the bird are the plates for the pilots and the windscreen. The engine cowlings were kind of armored, but I've seen 762 rounds go through them. We were given these snap on armored fabric for the inside of the birds but they weighed a lot and for our 58's and Apaches it simply wasn't an option. Our crews simply didn't use them unless they knew they were going to get shot up because of having to hover in dangerous missions. Even with that fabric armor, you can't armor the rotors or the tail boom and even a hind is a goner if you just let someone pound your aircraft with an AKM, they will find a spot to bring you down with enough rounds. The choice was to make more trips because of the added weight or even having to take longer routes because they couldn't stay high up over a ridge in Afghanistan because of weight... also more weight means a slower/sluggish aircraft. The best defense was to simply move as fast as you can and when you took off, do it fast! Unless you're using modern AA guns, you simply can't reliably hit an aircraft that's at altitude and hauling ass. Even with modern AA, faster is better!"

No, that's not true. The justice department has stated they have footage from the camera outside his cell and leading to it. Also the other cameras show no one was anywhere near Epstein when he died. It is true several cameras in the general area did not work, but from video evidence of the entrance to the cell and leading to the block, there's footage from all of them showing no one entered his cell. For someone to even get to Epstein would require the explicit help of close to a dozen people working at the facility.

But conspiracy!

Also, the indictment literally says there's video evidence that no one entered Epstein's cell. (starts on page 9)

We have the video outside his cell and no one went into his cell and killed him. Epstein was on suicide watch before, his death happened right after his suicide watch was lifted. The corner said it was suicide. The person who disputed it, simply looked at the report and made his statement and even then he didn't rule out suicide.

Epstein committed suicide. Investigate it, sure, but to make any other assumption with the evidence at hand is idiotic."
