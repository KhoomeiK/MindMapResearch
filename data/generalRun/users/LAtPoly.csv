Celiac,ffj4efc,t1_ffiz5vi,1579990106.0,This. If you weren’t eating gluten before the test for awhile the blood test is moot. It doesn’t tell you anything of value in that case.
Celiac,ff9exac,t3_esdiu4,1579711547.0,"If you’re breastfeeding, grab some gf brewers yeast and flaxseed from Trader’s Joe. Add that to pancakes and muffins, along with safe oats. All three boost supply in an ungodly NSFW Dolly Parton way...at least for me."
glutenfree,ff82rzn,t1_ff7z4ls,1579664470.0,"Walmart. The first few times I had to order online even though they said they were in stock bc I could NOT find them. They were not next to the normal Red Lobster mix or in the gf section. They were near the normal mix tho, but a bit over by themselves. They are clearly marked and delicious af."
glutenfree,ff7yhwz,t3_es3fud,1579661385.0,Clearly you haven’t had the gluten free Red Lobster biscuit mix. That is heaven in biscuit form.
BurningMan,ff1ibjz,t3_er3xga,1579479669.0,"It’s hard to get tickets the day they go on sale via the Burning Man website. There’s plenty available as the event draws near, esp if you are involved with the Burners in your community."
AttachmentParenting,fei8bg0,t1_fehpxcc,1579132525.0,"My son was nearing 2 and he could understand that when the sun is down and we go to bed that the boobies go to sleep too. Esp after reading the book a bit, with the same message and great illustrations."
AttachmentParenting,feepoeo,t3_eoqiy9,1579038594.0,"We bought the book “Nursies When The Sun Shines” and read it for a handful of days before “the big night.” It’s on Amazon. Instead of laying down to sleep nursing I did nurse back in the rocking chair for awhile and let him nurse completely, reminding him when he was done we have to say good night to the boobies until morning. 

There was one bad cry/tantrum on day one or two and Dad took him out of the room for that it got so bad. It was devastating to hear but...he was safe with dad and could understand what we were saying, so I let it be. For us, that was the worst of it. After that if he woke up I could remind him that the boobs were sleeping since the sun was down still. Maybe a small whimper and he was extra snuggly for a bit, but I could talk random things until he fell back asleep in a few mins. 

Let me tell you: That one sad night was worth it. Sleeping is delightful. Now he goes to bed nursing and is good until dawn. That book was super helpful and I recommend it,"
toddlers,fe69rab,t1_fe67fva,1578884947.0,"Same. Adults had it much worse (and more shall we say, violent) but for a shorter duration. Three days of exhaustion, only one  half day of sick. 

Toddler had tons of energy through it all and wanted to eat, and less sick overall, but his lingered. I would think we were over it, well passed the 24 hr mark, and then he’d vomit again out of nowhere. Lasted about a week. Sigh. 

It was a long week as it came in two sets. First two of us got it and then three days later the next set of people got it."
glutenfree,fdlvn11,t3_em1o5l,1578533570.0,"Red Robin is one of the “better” chain options...usually. I will chance Red Robin in a pinch but always grill the waiter. 

Time will tell tho. I’ll cross my fingers!

If it’s any consolation, I thought I must have got food poisoning from my fav trusty restaurant—turned out to be a stomach flu the entire family caught (and only I ate there that day) that had nothing to do with the restaurant. It’s so easy (and understandable!) to be paranoid with this disease or blame it all on gluten.

Let us know how you fare and if RR was the culprit, maybe leave a review on FindMeGlutenFree to warn others!"
Celiac,fdlutgj,t1_fdlr40p,1578533007.0,"I hear that. You sound like an empath and wonderful friend to have. 

And yes, humor is a great way to get through it. I was trying to show another way of looking at our struggle rather than it’s all bad and impossible that might make this disease seem less daunting and depressing. A good perspective does helps. 

Others in my family deal with diseases that have no antidote...their situations absolutely make me sad. We are lucky we can reverse and maintain our disease with a bit of vigilance and stubbornness."
fatlogic,fdltwrc,t1_fdlq0jh,1578532396.0,"Never said it did. Just that it can apply in certain cases of the population. It’s an added hardship that must be sorted, that’s all."
fatlogic,fdl6fvh,t1_fdl3so4,1578517846.0,"All good. Corn and dairy is in so much! It must have taken awhile to sort out and find meals. I don’t envy you but dude, keep it up!"
fatlogic,fdl61wh,t1_fdl4oh1,1578517655.0,"Technically: Yes. But hormones affect the amounts of CICO required for success, satiety, and ultimately, compliance. Some of the seemingly bs excuses play a role of the hormonal response in a subset of people, is all I’m saying."
fatlogic,fdl3csy,t1_fdl0kfe,1578516358.0,Definitely both spectrums exist. Most celiacs are malnourished because of absorption so I imagine other allergies do something similar. I’m glad you’re making strides towards your health!
BeautyBoxes,fdkys68,t1_fdkoqlr,1578513943.0,If you want to sell those earrings...hit me up. :)
fatlogic,fdkyilz,t1_fdkcbnn,1578513785.0,"Not to be that ahole but until my neuro sorted out I had a gluten disease (gluten ataxia) I really struggled with weight loss. I would weigh and count calories and only see results for a short initial period (but I would never gain during those periods, I don’t believe it causes weight gain). 

Once I removed gluten from my diet, weight loss has been easy and consistent. My hormones and energy are more balanced. I’m not hungry all the time. Autoimmune issues can impact weight loss and metabolism both directions imo. 

I’m not saying any of those things make you fat. That’s not the entire story. But they can contribute to making it much harder to be successful with weight loss or maintaining a reasonable diet. 

That said, those things (if they apply) shouldn’t mean to give up and accept a state that’s unhealthy and dangerous. It means experiment and research and try to figure out what can help you get passed that allergy/intolerance/inflammation. 

And I wish the message the health community could share is: “Watch your weight and don’t let it slip.” The research does show its hard to lose it AND keep it off after some magical point. Your metabolism takes a hit. It’s not impossible and it’s still a worthwhile goal... and boy is fat logic real, but it’s harder than it should be on paper. 

Had I really understood that, I think I would have reined things in once I noticed the creep and others might too. The best way to not become overweight really is prevention."
Celiac,fdjcugn,t3_elo8um,1578465623.0,"We have a good sized kitchen and that helps, but I have my own toaster and the gluten folks have their own dedicated gluten section near where they store the flours. It includes their very own gluten cutting board and it’s where they can prep things. 

I use a lot of tin foil to line things, and still wash/rinse before placing it on them. 

I have a separate butter I keep up on a higher shelf so no crumbs can fall onto it. They are careful with other condiments not to use a knife on any bread directly, and then double dip. 

We happened to have a dual oven and the lower one is mine/gf 99.9% of the time. 

We do share pots/pans, and all pans are cast iron because we prefer them. If they cook in them with gluten they are suppose to rinse and wash well - but my 12 yo knows at a minimum to put water in it as “code” it was glutened. To be honest, I wash it a couple times with boiling water and rinse well almost every time I cook on them even if it looks perfect just because I don’t trust it otherwise. I spend a lot of time rinsing and cleaning. 

Anything of mine dropped is chucked since the floor could be glutened. I also push them to always use a plate or at a minimum a paper towel to collect crumbs when eating a snack, say on the couch, but I catch my spouse all the time defying that one. My preteen is way more conscientious tbh. 

All certified items go in their own area (for the most part) so it’s easy for me to find. 

It seems to work most of the time. But I do feel that I have to be hyper vigilant and that gets exhausting. I wish we could have a dedicated gf kitchen after the 12 year old leaves, but my husband loved his pastries too much. He could prob do it 8 out of 10 days but not every day."
