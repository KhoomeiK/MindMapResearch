The point of science is that things are never complete, and the goal is to with incomplete data come up with theories and predictions that have a high chance of being right, even though there may be large gaps in understanding. This goes for Newton who observed gravity and made some predictions that were spectacular, even though he had no idea as to why this was happening. Good scientists publish facts, theories, and holes. 

One way to read this is to see that there is something incomplete (as they publish it), point at it and shout FAKE, rather than try and understand what the scientists actually did to work with that uncertainty. For example, a climate scientist may observe that there is some unknown factor, and experiment with that unknown factor, and try and make a decent prediction despite that factor being unknown. 

You have all the curiousity to be a scientist. If you are young and not a scientist, do train to become one. Take a physics degree, go for a PhD, and get all the training so that you can reproduce or falsify the current claims. That way, you can contribute to this discussion at a level miles up from me, and make a meaningful contribution. 

As for your suggestion that it would be better to warm the planet a bit - tell that to the people near the equator and on the pacific islands. Both will soon have to find new homes. The latter because their homes of the last hundreds or thousands of years are literally disappearing under the waves, the former because they will no longer be able to grow ordinary crops. Then there are people like me who live in a colder part of the world; I would love it to be 2C warmer. But guess what  - the extra water in the atmosphere as a consequence of that heating and the extra energy has delivered two 'once in a hundred year' flash flooding events five years apart - and indeed, the floods are not something I want to have to live with. In addition to us not being able to leave the house and roads being washed away, it also washes the soil into the ocean - not great.

The earth moves further away from the sun or gets nearer; the Sun may output more or less heat. On human time scales, the ideal CO2 level for humans is where it was when humans evolved. Ie, 300.

What is the source for your 20 feet a year sea level rises? It sounds implausible.
More likely it was around 1 meter (just over 3 feet) per *century* for a period of 13,000 years. At the moment we are seeing a rise of 3.3 mm per year, or 1 foot per century. So sea levels today are rising at a third of the rate that they were rising at the end of the last ice age. Of course, during the last ice age there was far more ice that could melt, so the total rise was higher.

When I state ""Coinciding"" I mean exactly that - CO2 levels happened to rise more or less at the same time that the ice age ended - there is no causality in that statement, it is an observation that both happened at the same time. So I am not sure what you would like me to proof? CO2 rose and the ice age ended at about the same time.

Doesn't that link answer your question? I am not sure what the problem is. Unlike the laws of gravity, the laws of climate change aren't yet as precisely established. That is why all the graphs projecting the future have big uncertainties, unlike a graph that predicts where a falling rock will be over time, which has a pretty precise timeline. Different climate models give different answers. The scientific approach is that you look at *all* those models, and continuously compare and contrast them, try and weed out the rubbish ones by measuring data, and try and improve the good ones. That first and foremost includes identifying and measuring all the missing bits, improving the models. That is what science is about. It isn't about getting to a politically correct answer, it is about uncovering what is happening."

Please have a look at my previous reply. The price may go up, but the affordability goes up too, so it makes it easier to buy a house. Think of it this way, it is ok if house prices go up by 3% if your salary goes up by 10% because it makes your house cheaper relatively speaking. 

The same here: house price goes up by 3% because of solar panels, but you need half the electricity to run it, so you can spend 5% more on your mortgage - your house is more affordable.

Any natural cycle there is has to adapt quickly.

So - 400 is not fine, and neither is 500 - lets just not add an enormous amount of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere, and take a lot out whilst we work out all a question like that over the coming 200 years.

For reference, it was as high as 4,000 ppm, 500,000,000 years ago, well before humanity arrived on the scene, or indeed any life outside of the oceans.

Whilst humanity existed it has been mostly 200-300 ppm, with a relatively quick change (over a 7,000 year period) where it went up from 200 to 275, more or less at the same time as the ice age ending. Ice age: think of Manhattan and Berlin being under ice at that time.

A 7,000 year period enabled animals, humans, and plants to gradually adapt to a new world with less ice and warmer temperatures. As there was so much water locked in ice during that period, sea levels rose by 125 meters; 400 feet if you are that way inclined.

My generation with my parents generation has just managed to change CO2 levels from 300 to 400 ppm in 70 years or so. This won't have a linear effect on temperature as there are so many places where heat gets locked away; oceans for starters take up 90% of it. But it has affected average temperatures by 1C already, and it is still on the up..

Subtract the cost of half a tiled roof (£1,500), add the cost of solar panels (£8,000), and you end up with a £206,500 house instead. A 3% increase in cost of your house. 

For this 3% increase in cost, you first of all cut your electricity bill in half (saves £300 a year), and you may be able to sell the remaining electricity to the grid, but lets ignore that and give it away for free to the grid.

I pay £6,500 once, and I get a yearly £300 return; that is a 4.6% return in the first year. Better than the extra mortgage cost.

worldnews,ff6mdcu,t1_ff5vmit,1579630280.0,"Yeah - I take your point, thanks for clarifying that. I do accept that you cannot change the world overnight. But to overcome the status quo of digging coal up and burning it (Germany, Poland, China, Australia just to name a few, not exclusively), you probably need something drastic.

No coal owning company is going to owe up to the problem; in fact, they will keep digging all the way until either until they exhausted their supply, or until no one is buying it. On the buying front, companies that own coal burning power stations will keep burning coal until such a point where they have exceeded their life span or until they are closed down. 

The problem we are facing here is that *if* the science is right, we do not have the time to wait for market forces to shut down the coal burning power stations. There is too much vested in it.

Hence, in my views there are only two ways to break this dependency on coal: shut the mine down or shut the power station down. Both will send shockwaves through the system. Shutting them down ""in five years"" will simply lead to an extension in five years. Let the black-outs begin; I'll survive. We will all suddenly use less electricity.

In capitalist terms: make carbon ludicrously expensive. In communist terms: te party days we shall no longer emit carbon.

In addition we’ll have to start putting carbon back into the ground. Grow grass, burn it and pump all exhaust gasses underground. 

Not sure why you wrote “let the downvoted begin”; I truly hope you don’t see yourself as a martyr who needs to sit on the fence and defend the 3% of climate scientists who disagree. They are perfectly capable of defending themselves. 

Never mind whether you are 10 or 70, black or white, capitalist or communist, American or Asian, join the 21st century and change the world for good?"
worldnews,ff5ho7o,t1_ff4yw84,1579593329.0,"She’s not. She tries hard to get people to listen to climate scientists.

You ought to listen to climate scientists too. It’s in equal parts enlightening and frightening. 

A climate scientist has a degree in physics or a related field, has critically read available literature in the field of climate change, and contributed knowledge to that field in any way shape or form."

There is perfect consensus on CO2 levels having been raised from 0.03% to 0.04%. CO2 has a well understood role in trapping heat. The same way that a down duvet has a well understood role. If I make my duvet 33% thicker, I end up warmer."
worldnews,ff5gv6g,t1_ff51bym,1579592298.0,"Correct. They’ll will have to change too. 

On the other hand, if Americans (not the USA) do nothing as add more CO2 that will add to whatever each Chinese and each Indian add. We’ll all have to stop using things and buying goods that emit CO2 and CH4."

Obama and al gore don’t care weather their houses are underwater in a century; they’ll all be dead by then. They may also have faith that sometime in the coming five years US and Chinese governments start to listen to climate scientists. 

Ironically, the Chinese have the best chance at turning it around. As they are effectively a dictatorship they will turn the ship 180 degrees if Xi decides that shit is real."

Another way to visualise it: your home used to be covered by a 15m  CO2 blanket, now it is 20m. That is a lot of extra CO2."

Disadvantage of the particular car we have (Renault Zoe) is that it is petrol car where they replaced the petrol engine with an electric engine. As a consequence, it has a 12V lead acid battery in it that feeds the screen wipers and electric windows. This battery is a weak spot and it can fail before anything else!"

electricvehicles,fesrm2u,t1_fesh798,1579368289.0,"I was going to put a number in for a 150 kW charging point. 

At a guess: your battery is too small physically to charge at high speeds. Any losses will show up as heat in the battery (and elsewhere), and in a larger battery you can hence cope with a larger charging current as it gets distributed over a much larger area. 

Love it, good luck with the next road trip."
electricvehicles,fesgbnn,t1_ferxup8,1579364890.0,"Thanks, that’s a good number. 14 miles per kW. 

So on a 22 kW charger you get 300 miles per hour, not bad at all, that takes your cruising speed down from 55 mph to 46 mph or so including charging time (which arguably you also need for a break)."
