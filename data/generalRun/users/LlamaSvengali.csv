Conservatives: We're not Nazis
Also Conservatives: We're Nazis"
TheRightCantMeme,fdl2ihf,t3_eldz7s,1578515953.0,"The conservative narrative here is that they are the KKK guy. This comic is insane. And sure, the lack of diverse history is why they are racist. The guy had a picture of Hitler. He's the guy we are meant to identify with?"

onejoke,fc1moe3,t3_ee58co,1577323379.0,I like that some transphobic Righty had to search Google for an image to make this meme. What was his search criteria? Was safe search on? Did his wife catch him scrolling through trans images and he had to explain he was making a meme? Did Mike Pence make this and he already had the image on his hard drive?

This gatekeep is a weird flex. Not sure why this blip in history mattered to anyone."
