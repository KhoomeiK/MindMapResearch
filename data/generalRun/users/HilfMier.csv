The whole model is quite a bit more complex (and insane) than that. If you have gender dysphoria, and really *have*(not *want*) to transition in order to have anything like a normal life, you're a 'binarist', a 'truscum', a self-loathing transphobe, a 'cis-boot-licking traitor', and will not just be kicked out of sjw spaces, but also actively harassed by them.

Random example (I have a few of them): a morbidly obese cis straight girl, white european and atheist, whose identity 'evolved' to bisexual, then non-binary, then (untransitioned and dress-wearing) gay trans man, then non-white / european and muslim, almost got me fired once because I told her she was an lgbt-phobic piece of thrash. Two years later she morphed again, to 'super lesbian'. A year after that she was involuntarily committed and disappeared from sight. An sjw group (funded by my tax money) had backed her when she 'called me out'."

Hence racism=capitalism=colonisation=homophobia=sexism='fatphobia'. To point out morbid obesity is bad for your health means you're a racist, colonialist, burgeouis bigot."
