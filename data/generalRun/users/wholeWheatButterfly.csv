Like, suppose the guests were totally unaware, and actually asked OP if they could use it for their own muscle ache, and OP said yes, knowing they'd used it before in bed?

Nonetheless, complaining to you about it is childish. The ability to nearly always have a break after work was finished - that ended when his kid was born (or even potentially when you were pregnant). It is an adjustment he will need to make. At the same time, I don't know that he should be villified the way some here are doing. I think some growing pains are natural during this time of major life change.

Also, I think some people need/want praise more than others. For instance, my partner and I split chores 50/50, yet they often want praise for doing their tasks. I find it annoying sometimes because it feels like doing our expected, assigned chores doesn't always need praise - I feel like praise is more appropriate for doing something out of their way. But, that's not the case for everyone. I mean, a good manager for instance should praise whenever their reports do their work adequately, even when it's their job. Not that I think you are or should be a manager in this regard, just recognize that some people might desire praise for things that you wouldn't normally expect praise for, and sometimes that's okay.

A few months ago I watched [this video](https://youtu.be/0VmekEMzyW0) of Brian Jordan Alvarez dancing, and he looks so joyous and connected with himself, I just realized how silly it is that most people (including myself) don't just dance and get seriously into it (at least, I think most people don't). Clear some space if you can, and just go for it. 10-20 minutes will probably tire you out if it's the right music for you. Don't worry about looking silly - never be ashamed in experiencing joy and authenticity with yourself.

After watching that video, I try to dance more often. Like really get into it. I wouldn't say I've built a habit out of it, but it can make you feel really great and get out some exercise. Makes me think that people were really made to dance, and it's a shame that I feel like the main socially acceptable way to dance is to take lessons and get really ""good"", or just go clubbing (if you call that dancing).

AskReddit,feoc84t,t1_fenb43q,1579298156.0,"I can only speak to my journey, but I feel that I mostly cured my anxiety this year. Note, I never had a diagnosed disorder, but I was always a very anxious person from like age 14-24. I had many GAD symptoms - getting very anxious about nothing or little things like getting a haircut. Most days feeling like a ball of anxiety.

I found that, in my case, I was not properly processing my feelings. I learned a method called Focusing from the book ""I know I'm in there somewhere"" by Dr. Helene Brenner* (highly recommend reading from front to back), and learned how to sit with my feelings, and acknowledge and feel them the way that I was meant to. I found that so many negative feelings in my life I was refusing to feel. In particular, I found a grief from my childhood that I had blocked for nearly a decade. I let myself feel this grief, acknowledged it and showed it compassion. And, it lessened. Literally the next day and ever since, 60-80% of my day to day anxiety has gone. I realized that before I had no room to feel things, and blocking my grief for so long spent so much emotional energy. And this resulted in so much anxiety.

I do not expect this to work for all or even most people, but it's been around 4 months and I still stand by the effect it had on me. I still go back to that book regularly. There is so much wisdom in it.

*The book did a lot more than reduce my anxiety - it really helped me connected with my inner self. Previously, I had very little sense of self, but now I know how to listen to myself. Also, while the book is targeted towards women, don't let that deter you if you are not a woman - I'm not a woman and I still strongly related and gained a lot from the book."

The thing is, most people don't really know what they're talking about most of the time - especially me right now. If an adult gives you that impression, likely it's just because they can, or because they're giving you the best snapshot of their current understanding. But, like you, they might think something totally different a month, year, or decade later. And, what worked/made sense for them might not for you.

It's a toughie though, because frankly some people have a much heavier step than others, and it's tough to draw a line at music being too loud, or shouting being too loud.

Humans, however, seem to not fit this rule.

I do like this theory though because it actually is a good argument for why you *should* exercise: regular exercise lowers your resting heart rate, and you are resting much more often than not, so having an overall lower resting heart rate in theory could mean fewer overall heartbeats, meaning longer lifespans.

Good culture, very interesting project, I'm valued by my peers, great pay. But I'm starting to think that what I thought I always wanted isn't really what I wanted. I think that others in my position would find other areas to find meaning - hobbies, family, side gigs - and that's fine but I don't know that that's what I want. I can't devote the majority of my creative effort on something that feels meaningless in the grand scheme of things."
financialindependence,fddpil1,t3_ekr2tv,1578320462.0,"I'm strongly considering taking a pretty big salary cut for a job that I find more meaningful. Well, potentially, as I have not gotten an offer yet.. I'm roughly 70% CoastFI, so still pretty far from FI, but I have a lot of savings for my age and certainly have FU money. The thing is, my current work at a FAANG seems so inconsequential, and now I'm realizing I could be successful in a field or company with a lot more social impact (albeit less pay), and I think that's what I really want.

I'd surpass coastFI if I stayed another year, or, if I went to this other job, it'd probably take me a couple years (possibly only 2 if I'm really lean). My hope is that I will want to stay in this kind of field and not care to retire early - which I really don't feel like I can say at my current company.

I know it would be sensible to stay at least a couple more years, as I am making really good money. But this career change would still have a salary of around 80k which is really pretty fine - especially since I've saved pretty aggressively at a FAANG for a few years already. I guess I'm starting to feel like, why save if not for being able to make career changes like this.

Can anyone relate?"

But it doesn't sound like there was much ""need"" here. And it would be another thing if he at least understood his wrongdoing and profusely apologized.

Then I couldn't recommend the book enough. I felt very much the same way. The book helped me get in touch with myself, and even overcome some childhood trauma that I had no idea was affecting my life still.

Since reading the book, I've learned a lot about what I want in life, and started some projects to make those goals happen. I even know myself well enough that I'm applying to jobs that would be a significant salary decrease, simply because I understand my life goals and interests more than I ever did before, and I know that work in some other fields will be much more meaningful and authentic to myself - even though it will have an effect on my FIRE."

And, I'm no medical expert, but I think a true chemical addiction to weed is very rare - is it possible that there's something in your life that you are strongly and perpetually dissatisfied with, leading you to substance use?

Recently, I read the book ""I know I'm in there somewhere"" by Dr Helene Brenner, and it helped me connect to my authentic self in ways that over a year of therapy did not accomplish. It's targeted for women and the language is a bit dated (writing in early 2000s), but still I got a lot out of it. In fact, some parts of it strongly spoke to me specifically as a man and a queer person. Can't guarantee it'll affect you like it did me, but I really can't recommend it enough. I still go back to it when I'm experiencing a bad moment."

But like I don't blame him for feeling upset; it is very stressful to live without any financial safety net (given his age I doubt he has ton of savings) - if he had known, I bet he would have lived much less stressfully even if nothing else was different. It sounds like you've probably never experienced that feeling of having no safety net, given you had a well off family and a lot of money very young.

Also, it definitely doesn't make you an asshole that you didn't spend it on traveling or some other life experience. But at the same time, like, having money in your 20s is an experience most do not get. You should consider using it to responsibly create memorable life experiences while you can. When I graduated college, I had a good chunk saved from internships, and I spent it on traveling with my partner for over 2 months. It was well worth it."

In my opinion, if her influencing doesn't go against your beliefs or something, I would probably switch it (maybe for like $100).
