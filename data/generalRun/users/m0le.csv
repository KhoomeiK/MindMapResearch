All the false positives have to be vetted by a human, because they're positives until we know otherwise. This could actually be worse than the way I assumed the system worked, by generating a gestalt of the area and flagging once - think how many cameras King's Cross would need, you're probably in many thousands of false alerts a day. 

That's wasting police time, and if they're all going back to a small specialist centre rather than local controls I feel deeply sorry for the poor bastards playing high stakes spot the difference with tight target times to meet. Is this person a terrorist or yet another random person flagged? You're going to get fatigued if there are hundreds of innocents for every crim. 

What was the false negative rate? I didn't see that published.

I would also argue that a negative doesn't give you a feeling of safety - there is going to be a fair contingent passing each camera that cannot be scanned, be that looking the wrong way, wearing something that makes the recognition not work, lighting iffy, or a small number actively avoiding detection.

Given most people don't actually commit crimes under a camera (well, drunken fights I suppose) they aren't being directed to many people.

The way most of these places work is that by parking in their private property, you have entered into a contract (if there is inadequate signage, this can be voided, etc).

As part of that contract, you agree to pay fines if you don't pay the correct fees up front (otherwise they would have no legal way to fine you - they're just another company) and you agree to whatever shady data practices the supplier has.

As with normal wheel clamps, running off with this thing (or any part of it, like the SIM card) would likely be treated as theft, in the same way as running off with the entry control barrier. If you steal something, you don't get to complain about any tracking of your activities with that thing.

I'd suspect that the SIM is either for remote control (so the code wouldn't work until the payment is made) or remote management (so word that Unit C can be unlocked with code 12345 doesn't get spread around campus, making the thing instantly worthless)."

So you don't even know how long patents last? A normal patent is just 20 years. Now you've actually learnt something.

Look at the cars outside. Lots of different manufacturers, but they're all quite close technologically, but massively more advanced than they were even 10 years ago. How is this possible when they're all forbidden from communication? Oh, because like pretty much everything you say, that was complete bullshit.

AskReddit,feictf6,t1_feiaqyq,1579135505.0,"You seem to have gone for a ""I want to get this result - how do I go about it?"" approach, then presented it as a thought experiment.

The difference between 'negative energy and mass warp drives' and 'Planck sized black holes in a shell' is that there isn't anything in known physics that stops the first from existing, and once the properties of negative energy are defined you can make further calculations to see if it is consistent. If you're very intuitive and / or lucky, you discover a hole in standard physics, map it precisely and wait for the applause if it is actually found (see the positron). 

In contrast, Planck length sized black holes might possibly exist but if they did they wouldn't behave the way you want them to. A hollow black hole seems more of a stretch, but maybe its possible - but you don't get to it from Planck length micro black holes. There isn't any meat to the thought experiment, because it begins from ""imagine this impossible thing"", not ""imagine this currently unknown thing""."

What is a magic market? It appears to be a straw man. Anyone knowing even a tiny amount about economics knows that a competition driven system is pretty horribly wasteful - I certainly wouldn't argue with that. It also is a good way to get progress, as you tend not to make advances on the first path you explore. Getting the progress without the waste would be ideal, naturally. Either once again you've spotted something the thinkers of the world haven't, and I assume you'll be publishing it in due course, or you're going after an idea without understanding it or having any idea how to replace it.

Want to get something similar without the daft Planck black holes? Take a set of high spin black holes, arrange them into a Kemplerer rosette, and narrow the orbital radius. Take another, larger black hole with very large spin. Have it mounted in the centre of the rosette but oscillating through the plane.

You will now have a sort of bottle defined by the flattened ergospheres (or if you really tighten the rosette, the event horizons) of the black holes.
