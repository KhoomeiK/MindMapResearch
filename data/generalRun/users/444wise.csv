Journaling,ffvf6i2,t3_evclk9,1580262690.0,Yeah I threw away most of my teen angst journals. I kept one though that was monumental in my growth as a human. The rest I re read one day and I was like oh shittttt these got to go before people read them. Last journal I completed was in 2016 (senior year). I just started a new journal 2020. Good luck journaling! It’s healthy and important to keep a journal so stick with it (:
Dreams,ffvehki,t1_ffvcpag,1580262227.0,I agree with this from a 7 year everyday pot head myself. Although smoking weed didn’t stop me from having dreams when I cut back the first week I had nightmare (which I rarely had when I smoked weed heavily). Now my dreams have gone back to normal after three weeks of little usage. Little usage as in literally one or two hits a day and that’s it. (Trying to successfully quit)
Journaling,ffurh3z,t1_ffuon3n,1580247945.0,I completely relate to this! I think just like that about kids.
Dreams,ffugjpe,t1_ffug9w1,1580241489.0,Yeah that’s definitely contributing. My best advice is to try to relax and not obsess. When we obsess over something it blocks us from actually getting the thing we want in life. Release in order to obtain.
Dreams,ffug62w,t3_evai0r,1580241267.0,I had a dream like this but I ran away from the wedding instead of the proposal. Maybe you just aren’t ready to marry someone
Journaling,ffsmrhc,t1_ffslvmz,1580185676.0,"Sometimes I’ll just start thanking him for the things he does for me. I like to also bring up how much we have grown from the last year or last love letter. He really likes and finds comfort in music so he sometimes will start letters to me with a song lyric that made him think of me. He also likes to just write mini notes like one or two lines about how much he cares/admires/proud of me. One of My favorite ones he has given me was so simple. One day he went to work before I woke up and left a two sentence note to me by the coffee maker with a  cute new lighter I use to light my scented candles with. So simple but so very sweet. 
I like when he reminds me that everything will be okay. I cherish when he says how proud he is of my growth as a human and partner. I love when he simply says “good morning baby I love you and have a wonderful day. I’ll see you shortly”  and he leaves the note somewhere I can find easily within my morning routine around the house
Edit: it’s really the little things and sayings that get me. Yes long love letters are nice (he usually saves those one-two page letters for my birthday,  Valentine’s Day, and other special occasions like that) but Day to day it’s simple, to the point but sweet, caring and supportive."
Journaling,ffshlqh,t1_ffs7aqd,1580181895.0,You’re welcome! I showed my SO the pages I did today and he literally cried. I hope your loved one cherishes it too (: if you have kids maybe they will cherish the love letter book you will have made by then too.
Journaling,ffrg786,t1_ffrekod,1580157437.0,"We have had some hardship but I know we will grow old together and take care of each other. There is no other person I want by my bedside when I’m sad, sick or in pain. We have made mistakes but talking through our hardships keep us united. True love is being able to heal with each other not away from each other."
bulletjournal,ffqll0a,t1_ffql90g,1580137872.0,Ok
bulletjournal,ffqjeh2,t1_ffqj0co,1580136237.0,Yeah I just think you’re misunderstanding me. I do believe everything about being a human is Beautiful simply because we have consciousness. I’m not down playing the bad stuff in life by saying it’s beautiful I’m saying that it’s all such a crazy gift of life we have and that is beautiful. I’m not saying that we have to feel gratitude all the time... I realize you have to have yin and yang in all aspects of life but these are all amazing gifts to have simply because we are able to understand that we are feeling these things. I’m not using positivity in a toxic way at all lol trust me I feel my messy emotions every day and I don’t just say of “they are beautiful” I feel them for what they are but on the large scale of thinking yes they are beautiful because I have CONSCIOUSNESS I guess I need to say to you for you to understand that I am using beautiful in an existential spiritual way. Not an everyday definition and using of beautiful. Nobody is using positivity in a toxic way here. SJWs are for Twitter. And if you still don’t believe that these things that show our consciousness level are beautiful then when you’re about to die you’ll understand what I mean.
