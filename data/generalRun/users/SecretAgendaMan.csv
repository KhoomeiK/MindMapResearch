This spell, which can permanently change a person from one race to another, means that everyone in their society that can cough up the gold or materials can be freed from their current body's limitations.  Any drow or duergar who wish to embrace the light of day instead of having shy away from it, now have the option to become something new.   This is going to change their society, their economy, *everything*, even their religion, if it reaches the public.  Upper Class drow who worked hard to increase their standing and gain access to the Luxon, now can dip into their family funds, and become their race of choice.  The poorer families no longer have to wait and hope that a member of their family is a reincarnated noble and have their status elevated. they could just save up, scrounge together the materials, or set out in search of coin to make their dream a reality.  Overnight, the demand for clay and gems would skyrocket. 

And the thing is, this wouldn't even be rejected by the followers of the Luxon.  So many of the elite who were stuck as short lived goblins or hot-blooded orcs could find themselves in their preferred form."
criticalrole,ffkvgvp,t1_ffko0xj,1580029724.0,"Well, first, let me clarify and explain, that, as I said in other comments, and just as Matt said:  Thoreau is an asshole.

I'm not making the case that Thoreau is a good guy.  I was just making the case that Thoreau doesn't need to be executed on the spot because of his actions.   

Again, he is a terrible dad, his behavior and his actions emotionally scarred Beau, and he's clearly got an antagonistic relationship with her, and that's the source of Matt's discomfort.

 I feel pretty confident in saying that Matt is *not* an asshole. He's a very empathetic person, but since Thoreau is a character that hurt his wife's character deeply, now Matt's sitting at the table, watching his wife feeling intense emotions because his character is an asshole.

Matt has always taken the stance that DnD is a collaborative experience, and it's obvious that he loves having big fun battles against crazy monsters and super villains that are evil in a way that is easy to find in fiction, so that players can tell the epic story of how they defeated the world ending threats.

Thoreau isn't a Lich. Thoreau isn't a God.  He's a flesh and blood person. He is foolish and rash and shortsighted and again, a huge dick who tried to control her; but he's also still a parent. According to Jester's high insight, He really is proud of her, and loves her,  and he regrets the fact that he ended up like his father.  To flesh out a character like Thoreau, and in order to give Marisha an intensely real emotional connection to the story, he's got to make Thoreau as real as possible to stick the knife in her gut and twist it and make her feel pain.   Again, in the moment, Matt feels like slime making his wife hurt like that, but he also logically knows that this is the RP that Marisha wants and the type of RP that Marisha and the players and the audience will look back on and remember forever.

The best and worst part about Thoreau is that he's not pure evil.  He's in a shade of grey that paints him as real person with both bad and redeeming qualities. Those redeeming qualities add an extra layer to the dynamic, causing conflict and tension and depth,  and makes a part of Marisha/Beau reconsider all the things she knows about Beau's dad and try to reconcile that with the new information and have it conflict and clash and add more emotional noise to the situation.

But it is still *so* hard to play someone who is very much like someone you might meet in real life, and is someone who is very much a clashing personality with your own.  Matt is not an asshole, and he does not want to be an asshole, especially when it's an asshole who is being an asshole to his friend or wife."

criticalrole,fffz3mj,t1_ffendeh,1579894947.0,"> Look how well this tactic is working on the audience, even. Look how many people are agreeing with Beau’s dad that she was at fault and brought his treatment of her upon herself.

As someone in the other side of the argument: No. That is not how I view the situation.  Thoreau is an asshole and a bad dad.  He has wronged Beau, especially with the way he ""sent her off"".   She didn't deserve that at all. It's fucked up.

Is that one incident enough to call him an abuser? Because that seems to be the one major incident that has happened between them.   

Was Beau's childhood as bad as she made it out to be?  How much of her memories of childhood have been tainted by that one event that happened to her as a college age student?   

There's so much that we simply don't know about her family life with Thoreau, and I can't find myself to entirely ignore his side of the argument.  How many times did the local towns guard come to their home, telling them that Beau was in custody? How many times did she cause her family stress and anxiety and worry?

Have you ever woken up in the morning to find out that your brother's locked up in jail? Have you ever seen one of your parents break down crying because they're not sure what's going to happen to their kid who's hanging with the wrong crowd, doing drugs, and drinking too much? I know for a fact that my brother's had a gun pulled on him multiple times.  He's been one misstep way from never coming back.  There were times when I was ready to give up on him, thinking that I'd never get my older brother back, even though that older brother and I were so different from each other that we never got along anyways.  

I'm certainly not saying she's to blame for everything, but neither is she entirely blameless.  

I think that this reunion went about as well as it could have gone, and with Jester's high insight, it's safe to say that Thoreau is happy for Beau that she has turned her life around and built herself up.

And I genuinely think that's really how he feels, just as I'm glad that my brother was able to turn his life around, find a job that he loves and that pays well, and has found a family for himself.

Of course Thoreau is to blame for making Beau go through a living hell.   Again, he's a terrible father who made tremendous mistakes, and their relationship isn't going to be fixed any time soon.

At the same time, should he be groveling at her feet and begging for forgiveness? That's a bit unrealistic to expect after everything Beau pulled.  

They may love each other, and may even begin to forgive each other, but neither should forget the pain they caused each other.  

And you know, maybe Thoreau doesn't deserve to be the murder victim of a band of murderhobos.  That's all I'm saying. I could be wrong, but that's just my opinion."
criticalrole,fffr1p9,t1_ffejcdi,1579889939.0,"As an uncle to a current 2 year old (she turned 2 just last week), I think Matt nailed it"
criticalrole,ffepvq4,t1_ffenitx,1579859519.0,"Keep in mind, we're viewing Thoreau through the eyes of Beau and what Beau is willing to tell others.  She's not exactly an impartial observer to the situation.  There's a lot of things she may not know about, there's a lot of things that she may have forgotten, or memories that were tainted by the bitter feelings she has for her father because of the truama she went through.

  We only know the bare minimum about what Beau did while growing up here, and most of what has been revealed or discussed has been about why she was forcibly sent to the Cobalt Soul and why her family is so messed up.  

It's never been about the good times. It's only been about the bad.

So we simply don't know how much effort Thoreau put in towards being a dad, because Beau doesn't see the whole picture. 

Obviously, he made bad choices along the way.  That doesn't mean he didn't put effort into loving and caring for Beau; it could just mean that he put his efforts into the wrong areas to focus on."

Yasha wasn't asking about anyone specific, because she doesn't know all the details about his life.  What she does know, is that she has found a kindred spirit in Caleb, and can tell that he has lost someone dear to him, just as she lost someone who was close to her.   

It's just like how Caleb said they both have blood in their eyes and blood on their hands.   They have both done things that they regret.   Again, kindred spirits.  

They know things about each other because they each bear a certain kind of pain that others who have experienced it can recognize.  At least, that's how the trope goes.  

No, Yasha didn't have anyone specific in mind, except for Caleb, who she was empathizing with on an emotional and spiritual level."
criticalrole,ffelgy7,t1_ffeknw4,1579853088.0,"And Thoreau seems to realize he messed up, and is bitter about the fact that he ended up like his father.   

Ultimately, though, it's not going to matter how much effort he puts in if Beau doesn't give him a chance. It will be up to Beau to decide if she's willing to forgive him (if not forget).   It will be hard for both of them, but like I said, Thoreau seems to genuinely love and care for Beau, and people do a lot of things for love.

I don't know if this will lead to Beau and Thoreau salvaging their relationship, but my main point was that his evil actions do not ignore or outweigh the good in him, just as all the good things that beau has done and good feelings we have for her shouldn't erase the fact that she did things that she's not proud of.

Beau's not a perfect person.   She stole from her family and sold wine on the black market.   That's a pretty scummy thing to do, regardless of what type of parent her dad is. Perhaps you have experience with bad parents.  I have experience with a drug dealing brother who went to jail for a couple years. That doesn't mean I don't love him, and that doesn't mean I'm not happy for him or proud of him for turning his life around and finding his now partner, her kids, and now the lovely little girl that they had together.  

 I love my brother, despite all the shitty years where he was stoned, or all the times he wasn't there for me.

Beau may have found her own family, but that doesn't take away from the fact that she still has family that she's stuck with, one way or another, who do, in fact, love her.

It needed to end quickly.   Reporting them wasn't going to end the situation, and the kidnappers weren't sure what to do, so he stepped in and ended it. 

 (Edit: if you'll notice, Spaceboy literally walked up and nudged them to pay attention, then warned them louder to tell them that they were going to die, and he only escalated the situation there because now they were dismissing *him* as well as the kidnappers. He gave them plenty of chances to step down, and only acted when the scenario didn't resolve itself.)

You're right.  Spaceboy is pretty high up there. Spaceboy has said himself that he pretty much only answers to Koil.  So  he asks himself when these situations come up: ""What would Koil do?""  

So how about you and I go through what Koil would do in this situation, shall we? In my opinion based on what I've seen of Koil, depending on which character he was on, he would either, A) hit the NVL offender with a prio drop and temp ban B) pull out a gun and fire away just as Mel did, or C) encourage the kidnappers to shoot the offender then and there. 

In any case, Koil would be seeking an end to the scenario so that it doesn't drag out any longer, which is why he wouldn't give a damn about Spaceboy intervening. 

Now, knowing *Spaceboy* he might actually try reaching out OOC in the next couple days, because he's more than just a report bot and people make mistakes.  That's how Spaceboy operates, because he loves RP, and he knows how hard this shit can be sometimes.

You don't seem to get it.  Spaceboy stepped in *because* the situation was *already* awkward.  The scenario bleeded in from the integrity apartments over to the hospital, and the kidnappers had no idea how to handle the situation.  He'll probably try to reach out the the person OOC, but in the meantime, this person was NVL at the hospital with at least half a dozen witnesses.  The scenario needed to end right then and there.

That's part of the problem. Eugene put the Prune label on, well, his label, and he's got people like Bryce, Gio, and Valentine.  Now, Mel doesn't know Gio all too well, Bryce is a frat boy with Daddy issues, and Valentine is a cop.  

Dex, Tupac, Gladys, those are Mel's homies, Prune Gang or not  Those are his ride or dies, but as for the rest? Why should Mel have to get shot up because *Bryce* made a diss track in some manufactured label beef, you know? 

Eugene may be his heterosexual life partner, but Mel has a very different image of what PTR could be and should be.  He's not going to join the label just to be another soldier in a war against another record label.  If he's gonna make a song, he's gonna do it because he wants to make music and he's got something to say.  He's about the artistry. 

Besides where's the story in Mel joining Prune Tang? Nepotism? That's no fun.  Spaceboy's always been someone who likes to buck trends and do what other people aren't doing, and to him, having Mel go independent leads to more interesting RP.   If Mel buiilds himself up and creates his own following, then as a strong independent, he has negotiating power and artistic freedom. He can play both sides and he can *work* with both sides all because he created his own side, and that creates a new dynamic for RP."

The fact that he immediately tried to go back once he had cooled off and tried to return doesn't count for anything at all, though?

Ron has a way higher breaking point than most people do, and the first chance, the first opportunity that he had to try to redeem himself, he took that chance, and dived into a freezing cold pond to save Harry's life, and then quite literally slayed his inner demons and destroyed the Horcrux that caused him to lash out in the first place.

Especially in the earlier days of the boom of the 32 slot server, there was just nothing to do, so he just had a route in the middle of the city, covering the main gathering points like the stores, the hospital, Pink Cage, etc., where he could run into someone to RP with.

Lo and behold, if you look back at Sodapoppin's first video, he encounters  Eugene literally half a block from the Pink Cage. 

He met Carl Crimes at the courthouse garage, accompanied by Rick Rhymes, aka Cyr, who knows Chandler IRL and is best friends with Vader. They got into Eugene's car and he rolled with it.

That's the beauty of RP, you don't need to meta in order to have something incredible happen.

That being said, yes, he adopts them and takes them under his wing.  He does it because he knows he can get them used to RP and teach them a little bit, while also showing them how fun and crazy RP can be.

He gives an RP scenario to new players, both big names and no name guys who catch his attention. ""This crazy old man thinks that you're his grandson. What do you do? How do you handle him? Do you try to set the record straight? Do you allow him to ramble and rant? Do you feed into his delusions?""

In any case, I'm glad that Austin Creed has found a fun way to get connected and get his character some money.  Wu-Chang records is doing so much for the server, and it's great."
