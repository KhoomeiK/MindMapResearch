dankmemes,ffegt68,t3_et2tpl,1579847441.0,He's from my town. He's riding with our police officers to restaurants and being treated like a celebrity. Everyone is trying to make it special for him.
facepalm,ffegbnn,t1_ffdvcp8,1579846902.0,He'll have to go to another bank to actually cash the checks though.
SocialEngineering,ffdfnop,t3_eszwyn,1579819882.0,"Not sure how i would handle it over messages since I'm more vocal. But i wouldn't apologize if he is a shitty boss. I would ask him about it. He can take the questions as an attack or a chance to explain himself.

I do advice to be careful with gossip or talking behind someone's back. Always expect that conversation to leak. If you're involved in such conversations, just take in info but don't add to it. The more info you have on a target the better chance of knowing how to handle them."
watamote,fdpbj50,t1_fdp7jgf,1578624509.0,"If i could draw, i definitely would."
socialanxiety,fd4i4yw,t1_fd0debe,1578167700.0,Im surprised watamote isnt brought up in this sub.
dank_meme,fcvy8t9,t3_ej3hwj,1578012830.0,Reminds me when i saw a fat karen sending her daughter to bring the manager to the parking lot to protest why there weren't any scooters available.
AskReddit,fcmbvi3,t1_fclz3pr,1577769914.0,"Because we were raised to, ""stop being a little bitch and grow some"" or ""you pussy, man up"""
socialanxiety,fckpb4l,t1_fcjs483,1577730269.0,"This is very important, people need to note, the drunk you is not the sober you. Let people know you for being you."
socialanxiety,fckosel,t3_ehir4w,1577729950.0,"I think I beat my SA. I can go to stores, restaurants, and events alone. I still have trouble communicating but still working on that.

What helped me was going to events like open mics. I try to join more conversations with people and met some great friends. 

I was scared at first but living alone and working from home was having an impact on my life. So i pushed myself to be more social. My biggest issue right now is starting conversations. 

I've tried the sub's discord but to be honest, it didn't help me. It seemed many didn't have the same level SA like i did. I was too afraid to post anything. Now i don't join because I feel like i owned my fears and don't need to be there.

I wish every one good luck, it's not an easy process to beat SA, took me about two years.

I also recommend to talk to each other, don't worry the other person is freaking out as much as you are about themselves. They're not judging you, they're wondering if you're judging them."
AskReddit,fbuycl4,t1_fbuvafp,1577122361.0,I've heard it was the plague (some seem to state it wasn't which im too lazy to fact check) but from what I remember the ashes part was related to the ashes from the burning bodies.
