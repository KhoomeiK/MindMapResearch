Customer was a regular customer (but a pain in the ass). He had a mouse issue, an hour or so of over the phone back and forth, he wasn't able to figure it out, and he demanded I come service the issue in person. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but he just moved his business from my big city to next door big city, and my car was in the shop. I told him as much, as well as the fact that it's take 2 hours for me to get there, he said ""I don't care how much it costs, just get here."", along with some choice words. Wasn't going to bill him for travel time due to the issue with my car, but since he put it that way, I figured what the hell.

I make it out there, walk to his office, pick up his wireless mouse, and flip the power switch. Once customer confirms it's working, I tell him I'll send an invoice in the morning, and called up a friend I have in that city and invited him out drinking. Buddy drives me home in the morning on the way to his sister's place in my town, and I pretty much immediately get on the PC and send him the invoice.

Customer wasn't happy, called and gave choice words, and I promptly emailed him a copy of his angry phone call yesterday, ""I don't care how much it costs, just get here."", and he relented.
