PoliticalOpinions,fdgotr6,t1_fdev578,1578404314.0,"Also.. Yes stuff has been going on between Iran and the US for a while now. It just hasn't been made clear to all of the US until now because war has been mentioned.
 (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/us/politics/us-iran-news.amp.html) 

The two countries have been poking each other for a while now. Nothing was wrong and Iran intended to stay in the 2015 nuclear deal. Trump pulled out of it before his meeting with NK's leader in preparation. It wasnt until Trump started poking around, accusing iran, and not having trust in them. Offensive and probably making iran feel threatened by us watching them with drones. if we saw another countries drone enter our territory the U. S. Would probably shoot it down too and confiscate it thinking it'd be there for mal-intentions. I'm not completely sure what the government knows about Iran and why Trump decided to do all this stuff. Because clearly he has told us nothing. All it is is accusations between the two countries. And now something actually has proof. And whats that? Trump killing the leader of an official government branch in Iran. Of course Iran is gonna pull out of the nuclear deal. US just KILLED one of their government officials. Who knows if he has been planning something. But we haven't been told any proof or given any? So what are we supposed to believe? Either Trump and our government knows stuff or they don't. IT IS THEIR WAR. And iraqs a neighboring country to iran. ALSO the man killed was trying to have a meeting with officials in Iraq about something. Our attack was basically ILLEGAL. not even just illegal it was murder. They probably don't want to be apart of this or to be attacked so if they want US military out they want them out. It's their fair decision. And Trump says if iran does anything to anyone here he'll strike back. IRAN ISN'T GOING TO NEGOTIATE BECAUSE HE'S KILLED SOMEONE. OF COURSE THEY WILL RETALIATE. Him striking back again will cause this to be a back and forth between the two countries until we go to war. He shouldn't have striked first at all anyways."
PoliticalOpinions,fdgoshd,t1_fdev578,1578404283.0,"no not really..? @ the liberals and Trump thing. I know plenty of Republicans that are upset. You realize not everyone in one political party will have all the same beliefs right?
That's just stereotypical. Assumptions.
I mean yes most Republicans where I live,,they have loosely based patrioticism..don't actually educate or research anything. They just have the beliefs they have because it's what they're told what's right by their southern grown parents...Who were mostly raised by also..the same type of people who owned slaves back in the day. And quite the majority of them are racist & make stereotypical comments about anyone who isn't Caucasian...So want war because they think we'll immediately destroy everyone. Most of them are narcissistic. 
Still though.. It's just mainly human to not want war bc we have people we care about. The people who want it though aren't thinking about anyone outside of America, and act like us inside America will be completely safe. Just a bit overly confident... 
Anyway
the United States is supposed to be for the people. But this isn't realistic and it's not realistic most places. The government & where I'm from its the racists, a vast majority of the Republicans, and people who are Overly confident in our government and our protection are the ones who want it. So basically just the Republicans where I live. Whoops. 
I don't know why it would be logic to you that specifically only liberals who don't like Trump are hurt about this though.. Once again it's just human nature.."
PoliticalOpinions,fdgia67,t1_fdeuq5d,1578397956.0,They may have fingers and google but that doesn't matter. in a real debate or in court or just anything do we leave it up to the judge to look up things themselves? No. It's important to share your own evidence. Also it proves you've done your own research and that you're educated. completely nothing wrong with it.
offmychest,fdfq300,t3_ekv9t4,1578367492.0,"It's completely okay. You don't have to do school right now. Maybe take a break. It's okay to need a mental health break before you get back on track. Go at your own pace! Don't compare yourself to other people or societies standards! Its very important for you to accept these things & your feelings.  Help you improve upon yourself. And we all can't just fight this alone. It is very much okay. Everyone is unique and different! Reddit believes in you and we hope you will be okay! If you can, please seek professional help!! And maybe even your parents would be okay with helping you with that. :)"
offmychest,fdfoh9g,t3_el4tzl,1578366424.0,Tell her this please!! Tell her you want to talk about something important to you and tell her all these beautiful things!!
offmychest,fdfo319,t1_fdfn74g,1578366165.0,No problem :)
offmychest,fdfnley,t1_fdfnb70,1578365845.0,Yes!! Acceptance is a very big part of growth! I've been working on a lot of the same things too. Thank you very much.
offmychest,fdfmw45,t1_fdepebg,1578365382.0,Yes this was very wrong!
offmychest,fdfmqqn,t1_fdfm9yq,1578365284.0,Yes!!! That's beautiful :). I'm glad you are happy!!!
offmychest,fdfmk0w,t3_el4kl2,1578365164.0,"I'm sure she felt comforted that no one really reacted to her weird. you were kind to her, let her feel her emotions, live her life u know. In that kind of way. & you held her place. I would feel bad too but there was nothing wrong with what you did. And It's not dumb at all. Some things may seem small to some people, but are bigger things emotionally to another person. Maybe if you ever see her again say something nice to her or ask her how she's doing?"
offmychest,fdfk5te,t1_fdedtss,1578363599.0,"This happens to me. For my situation I truly believe it's because relationship anxiety and many problems possibly caused by idk past childhood stuff. it's very hard but I've been trying my best to fight these intrusive thoughts. It's hard but I've been putting as much trust into my boyfriend as I can. You do have something to hope for because there will be someone out there for you. Its just not great to search for it all the time. Bc we get so blinded by things, hung up on other people, and actully need to remember to take care of ourselves as well. And remember both sides of the relationship are important."
offmychest,fdfjtm5,t1_fdf2rz3,1578363379.0,Thank you for sharing this this was beautiful. remember to take care of yourself. Relationships are in a team. They need balance. Like the beams of a bridge. I hope you learn a lot about love and can grow from all of this.
offmychest,fdfjhx4,t3_ekqmk7,1578363160.0,"Love is found in the places you probably wouldn't expect it. They always say that in movies and such. They always tell you to not search for it bc one day it'll pop up right in front of you, you won't see it coming. And honestly that happened to me. It is exhausting. but I stopped putting all that on myself when I didn't ""have anyone"" I started appreciating a lot of small stuff about myself instead. I started appreciating and realizing stuff with my friends. I started accepting a lot of things. Love is a lot more than just significant others. Love is everywhere. You sound so strong and great!! Thank you for sharing!! You will find someone !! Don't focus on it too much :)"
offmychest,fdfimsa,t1_fdemgdj,1578362577.0,"Yes it's a good time to learn balance! Relationships always need a balance! That's why communicating and all partners in the relationship sharing how they feel, understanding how eachother feels, etc. And finding a balance n peace with each other!"
offmychest,fdfihz7,t1_fdfigfu,1578362487.0,None of this is your fault. Don't let your pain and the past control your life!
offmychest,fdfigfu,t1_fdfibvb,1578362458.0,And take this time to remember how important mental health is. Take it as seriously as you can. Remember you don't always know what's going on in the inside or behind closed doors with people. hold the people you love very close. give them all that love.
offmychest,fdfibvb,t3_ekyalq,1578362373.0,"This is a time for growth, learning new things, take this situation and make the best out of it. Know that there is many out there just like you and lots of things you can research online. Get professional help and talk to someone if you can. They will educate you abt lots of things, help you improve upon your self, and they will listen to you. They will help you. I'm sure maci wouldn't want all of this for you. She hurt enough. Too much stress. No one suffering wants the same for their loved one, they don't want them to hurt as well. I deal with a lot of the same things. It's very hard and I always am scared of overwhelming my boyfriend. I just know to have a convo with him and ask him if it's okay for me to talk to him about things or certain situation. Or if it feels like too much for him I will talk to him another time or push out my feelings into someone else. Relationship anxiety is very hard to deal with as well. It is a lot of stress. You're not an ass. You deserve love and deserve to be happy. She needed professional help too. Have hope and keep trying!! Pursue stuff!! You can get through all of this. Reddit believes in you!!!"
offmychest,fdfhcuy,t3_ekz9s7,1578361719.0,That's so nice I'm so glad she's doing much better :)
offmychest,fddxizy,t1_fddxg82,1578326389.0,No problem dude. Thanks for sharing!
offmychest,fddxf7x,t1_fddx5r1,1578326317.0,We'll all be fighting through this together my fellow millennial!
offmychest,fddxbux,t1_fddx5r1,1578326254.0,Yeaaah sounds like us. Hahaha.
offmychest,fddx4u4,t1_fddwt7b,1578326124.0,It be them rant hours on Reddit man. I still have some positivity left in me though! And I'll keep fighting.
offmychest,fddwlm3,t3_ekttd2,1578325756.0,"I know it's hard to believe. But it's something you both need to believe in your relationship with that guy. That it can work. Sometimes we dramatically break things off. But communication is the most. importaNT THING EVER. I'VE SAID that like 12 times on this reddit today. So important. to just explain your feelings to each other, ask each other questions if you need to, reassure each other that you understand why each other feels such ways. Meet somewhere in the middle. I'm sorry you felt insecure about things in your relationship. Trust is also important. He also needs to trust what you say from Your heart and you guys need to talk to each other. A compromise. Talk about what you think you can both improve in yourselves. remember it's okay to have space. If he needs space that's okay. If you need space. Talk another time. Sometimes it's good to walk away from things. I'm sorry reddit user. But this isn't your calling to leave the world. It's not. You need to start just like many other users and myself, with finding love within yourself. it takes acceptance. lots of it. Lots of less thinking about the past and not too much about the future. take as many small steps as you need. You can see my other replies to /offmychest reddits or DM me if you want I am sleep deprived so sorry if I sound crazy. This text would be longer if I could text any longer. N remember it's. okay to be sad. It's hard and slow and healing is just as difficult. It's hard to notice the change when you're healing. But I believe in you reddit user. You are strong! Reddit is here for you! And remember it is perfectly okay to call someone or speak to a professional hotline. Your normal everyday humans cant always serve professional help and have lots of feelings too and sometimes cannot process this stuff themselves. But professionals will listen to you, give you advice if you ask for it, and teach you how to improve. They can also educate you on lots of these things & what you feel. (You can also do lots of intensive research online about. psychology. Theres also lots of great tips about helping you get through things. And get better."
offmychest,fddvi6y,t1_fddl3pk,1578324998.0,Yes thank you bigtowelie!
offmychest,fdduw8q,t1_fdduozl,1578324570.0,"And remember it's okay to seek professional help. Not everyone can be there to listen or help you. Not everyone knows how to help people. Not everyone can provide for you even when trying their best. It is hard and difficult sometimes. Sometimes there's a point where you need to go to a professional. Someone whos speciality is this kind of stuff. They listen! They help you grow! They help you understand, they educate you, and help you learn more about people, human interaction, and yourself. Heck you can even research that stuff. :)!"
offmychest,fdduozl,t1_fddukzj,1578324429.0,You sound like a kind soul. You are a fighter and a survivor. You can make it. You are needed in this world. This is ur call!!!
offmychest,fddukzj,t3_ekqzaz,1578324352.0,"The same thing happens to me. I've battled it for quite a bit. I think I've kind of learned to accept some things over time. It is okay to be sad. Sometimes we need to let emotions out. It is normal. Perfectly normal. Instead of focusing on the things you don't have I'd focus on the things you do have. Appreciate what you can about them. Think about how lucky you are to have that apartment, how much you love your cat and how much it probably loves you. How much you love your boyfriend and appreciate him. Send that love out. Project that as much as you can. Accept the past and think about what you can do in the present. Don't think too much about the future. Just focus on the present and working on improving yourself. not changing yourself. Not harming yourself. Work on accepting yourself. Appreciate small things about yourself. things you like, things you do. Appreciate the small things in your day. Your small achievements like just getting through the say. And suck in all that love comin from the outside world all at the same time. These intrusive thoughts, they are intrusive thoughts. If you listen to them and let them scare you, they will continue to come back and control you. Accept them for what they are, it's hard sometimes to ignore them or seperate them from how you really feel. But there's lots of tips online to help you. The more you don't give them that power and ignore them. They stop coming. If they don't stop though, over time I can assure they'll scare you less and hurt you less. You are loved reddit user. You are cared for. Whether it's by me, or the others, your boyfriend, or anyone else. There is always love there for you. You are beautiful and it is okay to feel this way and these things. (Besides the harmful things. Those are bad and should be pushed out in healthier different ways). Your boyfriend sounds like he trusts you and cares for you. Give him that same trust. Shoot down those thoughts that don't believe him. Wouldn't doubt it for a minute. I hope he understands what you're going through or that you can talk to him about it. Im sure he'll do the best he can for what you need. And yes Sometimes people do leave. Sometimes for good reasons and it's good to just to think that they are at least happy where they are. And sometimes people need to leave to get better and get help. It happens. don't let that tear you down. Don't always be focusing on the future. Accepting some things is hard but it's one. of the most important things we have to learn and grow. relationship anxiety is hard but you can hang on. It's important to focus on the present and build from there. Things may be hard and slow. But you can get through it. I'm not just here to pity you, one-up you, or anything. I hope you can get better and get through this. I believe in. You. Reddit believes in you!!! <3"
offmychest,fddt2r4,t1_fddspll,1578323268.0,Yes thank you for your positivity. It is greatly appreciated from my stressed self ahah.
