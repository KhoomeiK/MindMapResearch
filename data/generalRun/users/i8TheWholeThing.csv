Unexpected,ffv8fl3,t1_ffv2ajo,1580258155.0,Jokes on you. I can shoot my friends with Nerf guns and not go to jail.
mead,ffjej9c,t3_etttkc,1579996589.0,Nope.
beer,ffjehlj,t3_ety53v,1579996558.0,There are no hops in (most) hard seltzer so lightstruck-skunking is not a problem.
beer,ffje2il,t3_etyoz8,1579996312.0,Fresh IPAs are better. It's also possible they had a bad canning run and allowed more oxygen into the cans than is preferable.
Unexpected,ffh23me,t1_ffgx5a0,1579921041.0,The kind of father who chose not to be around isn't the kind you want to have around.
cider,ffgjqxs,t3_etgtj0,1579907829.0,Kegging is the promised land. Hallelujah!
madisonwi,fff0jkn,t1_ffdzs2b,1579872305.0,They're going for the high score.
Homebrewing,ffdq7uz,t3_et2c9o,1579826328.0,Wy1968 is my favorite English yeast and it always looks like that. It is SUPER flocculant.
Homebrewing,ffdq1wj,t3_et2818,1579826224.0,Having done what you are talking about I'd recommend using a tincture if you're looking for the intoxicating effect of thc. Dry hopping with bud will work but it's very mild.
gifs,ffd4c3u,t3_esy99f,1579813164.0,James Cordon is a knob. Glad he's not driving though.
aww,ffd4078,t3_esugf1,1579812981.0,I simultaneously want that dog and want to be that dog.
aww,ffd3wwu,t3_esvn89,1579812930.0,Queue the unidan quotes in 5...
dogpictures,ffd2yxr,t3_esuydt,1579812394.0,"A couple a two, tree cuties der."
Homebrewing,ffd13yy,t3_esx16p,1579811344.0,I brew 5 gallon batches about every 2-3 weeks. Some are batches that will age long term. Others are 3-4% ABV session beers that tend to kick quickly.
JustBootThings,ffbzuph,t3_essq7d,1579787882.0,What a hero.
mead,ffbzpmo,t3_esoql9,1579787770.0,I've been brewing for five years and it still feels just as exciting when you get a batch to kick off. Enjoy your journey in fermentation!
pics,ff5z8r8,t3_eru7qo,1579614956.0,Those rolls are tight as fuck!
dogpictures,ff5y7w6,t3_eredg4,1579614113.0,The only thing that helped me at all was getting another dog. I still miss my old girl but my new guy fills my days with love.
Homebrewing,ff5wf4p,t1_ff5hfmn,1579612516.0,I like caramel and toffee flavor in my ESB so I use a little C60 and C120. You could then drop the Carapils. Just my preference.
Homebrewing,ff2xiyx,t3_er8mkz,1579527781.0,"I drink what I like, which is mostly traditional styles. For me the enjoyment is in brewing my oatmeal stout for the 5th time and really getting the mouthfeel and roast flavor right. I've always been more attracted to subtlety in all things. My friend that I started out brewing with is the opposite. We made one bad porter from a kit and he's like ""I've heard Sahti is good. Where can we source spruce tips?"" Meanwhile, I've finally gotten my ESB where I like it. 

It takes all kinds and to each their own."
pitbulls,ff1tv86,t3_er3wgv,1579486066.0,One man's trash is another man's treasure. Nice job finding that treasure.
tippytaps,ff1t16n,t3_er4mww,1579485530.0,That pup is giving me a toothache bc he soooo sweet.
Vintage_bicycles,ff1gcz0,t3_er3ufc,1579478795.0,We're gonna need some more pics. Close up of components and drop outs would help. Any identifying marks?
bikewrench,feru6un,t3_eqgzgc,1579358386.0,I bought grey market parts from China once. The brake levers and calipers are legit but the hydraulic housing was too short and it didn't come with all the needed mounting hardware. After sourcing all the additional parts I was over the retail price for legit parts. Never again.
videos,fers7n1,t3_eqg1i2,1579357775.0,It looks more like someone started fighting in the middle of a dance.
brewing,femmymx,t3_epurr5,1579263138.0,There is a mead sub /r/mead. Flip top bottles are not suitable for long term aging. The rubber seals can dry out over time. They are fine for a couple months but I wouldn't go past that.
whatsthisbird,feiu9xr,t1_fehvehz,1579147384.0,I saw one in the Olympics. High Divide loop.
JustBootThings,feimeh0,t1_fehcj93,1579141927.0,I don't think anyone does care until people like this disingenuously make it a culture war issue just to create a stir.
instantkarma,feb6qhj,t1_feanhq9,1578955912.0,either will do.
Homebrewing,fe5kj1u,t3_entgod,1578870593.0,I was just wondering about using flour in place of flaked wheat in a NEIPA.
wisconsin,fe0cyaz,t3_engbwg,1578810255.0,Oh for sure. I used to have hard drives name Milkbreath and Thorzul.
aww,fdsehpy,t3_emvtc1,1578700852.0,Everything in this photo looks so soft.
madisonwi,fdjrzwh,t1_fdioy2x,1578485341.0,I'm glad you got the reference. High five!
madisonwi,fdi8o7w,t3_elf2l0,1578437727.0,I'm going to start littering so I can quit!
BeAmazed,fdf8xiz,t1_fdf31qw,1578356062.0,"I upvoted you for telling someone on the internet (you know, the greatest, most easily searchable source of information in human history) to look it up on, you guessed it, The Internet. Bravo/a."
Homebrewing,fd9u4lu,t3_ekdgc8,1578238036.0,I use glass carboys and carry them in milk crates. I will be replacing them all with SS Brewtech Brewbuckets (I have one so far and love it). I would use a blow off in a 5 gallon carboy.
bicycling,fcw01xc,t1_fcvclbw,1578014021.0,I live in WI and have had multiple Trek 720 Multitrack and 900 Series Singletracks. Seems like an excellent choice. Although a Waterford-made Schwinn would be the bike I'm always looking for and have never bought.
interestingasfuck,fcvd0sh,t1_fcuw43d,1577999534.0,The Finnish Volf?

Edit : search for ""carboy"""
Homebrewing,fcnnm97,t3_ei61ci,1577814905.0,I like WY1968 for an Oatmeal Stout.
dogpictures,fcmxo2l,t3_ei196g,1577796772.0,"He looks just like my beagle/lab mix who is 33 pounds, fully grown."
beer,fcfnwnc,t1_fcaoffi,1577632066.0,"It's worse than that. It seems they don't understand the basics of ABV calculation, which is a pretty big problem for a ""professional"" brewery."
