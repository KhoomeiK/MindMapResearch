I'd ask him why he yowls some mornings, but not others, and what he thinks his loud, post-poop announcements accomplish. I'd ask him if he knows what he's allergic to and tell him that I know he hates when I apply ointment on his hot spots, but that I don't do it to be mean and he doesn't need to look at me like he'll never trust me again."

But if I really liked something and someone else hated it, it can put a damper on my feelings about the movie or show or book or game. This is even true before watching/reading something--if I'm really looking forward to it and someone posts a vague comment about how it's not good or it won't fulfill expectations, it bums me out. I want my first impression to be purely mine and not biased by someone else's opinion. I don't find that less extreme reactions (I loved/liked it, they just disliked it) bother me that much.

Of course, it's a little tough to do when people won't stop talking about how much they hated a thing you enjoyed on every social website in existence, sometimes for years on end."

When you start sounding like an antivaxxer who believes she knows more than medical experts, it's time to step back and examine your viewpoint. There are doctors who refuse to take women seriously when they have concerns about their own health, but this ain't that. We need to be better than the people who think that they, without any apparent background in medicine, have all the answers. Science is flawed. But it is not so flawed that every medical statement about women is wrong."
TwoXChromosomes,fcjkau5,t1_fcis0fr,1577691034.0,"There is a very real problem with medicine and women's health and taking women seriously, but some of you are parroting false ideas to get to that conclusion, and that's not just unhelpful, it's dangerous. 

Periods aren't meant to be severely painful and they aren't meant to be so heavy that you bleed through multiple pads in an hour, that's why you are advised to go to medical professionals when you experience those things. The fact that medical science suggests that periods aren't normally painful or heavy is *not* the problem. The problem is doctors not taking women seriously and refusing to consider their symptoms red flags."
TwoXChromosomes,fcjjy0y,t1_fciit2e,1577690595.0,Everything that you see during a period isn't blood. It looks like a lot more because it is a lot more--blood is only about 35% of your flow.

TwoXChromosomes,fcjjjtz,t3_ehd91d,1577690110.0,"First, why have you quoted two individual sources in a single paragraph as if they're the same source? 

Medically, one-third of women may experience heavy flow. Heavy flow means something specific here and has a special diagnosis; it's defined by things like needing to change your pad every single hour for days or needing two pads at a time to stop bleeding through your pants. Just because this medically-defined heavy bleeding is common doesn't mean it's normal or healthy--you should *not* be losing that much blood every period. The reason for outlining that these things are not normal--while they may be common--is so that women talk to their doctors when they experience heavy bleeding or severe period pain and don't just carry on thinking that's just how periods are."
