They want you to do well and want to be entertained. work more on making it fun than perfect. My daughters boyfriend is starting out, and these are some things he learned. Also, make sure you have water and wet rags off to the side in case you may need them. Don't forget to eat a light meal an hour before you get up there. Take care of you first and foremost.

if you have time, rehearse your setlist a couple of times to work out the kinks.

should something not go as planned on stage, just make light of it and move on, no-one will focus on it if you don't.

Good luck, and I hope it goes how you imagine you want it to."

bipolar,fdodopn,t3_emataw,1578603236.0,"I am going to be very careful how I word this, because I am not condoning this, but you really did a good job putting that into words. A lot of us have these thoughts, and it is very difficult to talk about, because others (not afflicted) get uncomfortable talking about it.

If you are actually having these thoughts now, please tell you doc (I don't mean just the author).
