depression,ffl1bg0,t3_eu1kgd,1580032954.0,"I know that feeling. For me, it's because I've felt like this for as long as I can remember. I don't have many childhood memories (I struggle to remember things before I was about 12 or 13), but I know I started realizing I felt this way and not everyone did, and that something was wrong, at around 12.

I don't know who I am if I'm not depressed, isolating, and alone. I don't know who I am, what I'm like, what my real personality is. Even on antidepressants, I'm not sure this is who I really am. I'm scared of getting better because I don't know who I'll be then."

AskReddit,fenit4e,t1_fds5j41,1579285606.0,"I'm having so many issues with Comcast right now. It appears that they got rid of the self setup for wifi, and I work a schedule that doesnt allow me to have time to have someone in my house. They keep sending me the self set up code, it works for a week with an appointment to have someone come in, appointment passes, internet shuts itself off because no one came in. I shouldn't have to remember to cancel an appointment for your system to KEEP MY WIFI ON."

depression,fec6hxi,t1_fec22gq,1578967462.0,"I like to think so! I've struggled quite a bit in this job, especially getting used to the social hierarchy here so to speak (I'm working in assembly after several years of retail) but I'm slowly getting settled! The genuine niceness has been refreshing - and everyone is much more genuine in general. I've been able to be more open with the coworkers I spend the most time with about my anxiety (particularly when I do something to irritate them and feel like the world is ending), so it's been nice. We spend almost 12 hours a day around each other, so you start to notice people's moods and such way more often. ^^'"

relationship_advice,fe6lhso,t1_fe4e1gg,1578894902.0,"This. I have anxiety and depression and some days I CANNOT deal with being around people, no matter how much I love them. On the flip side, my last boyfriend refused to take that as an answer and would expect that I at least did something productive in that time, and would get salty upon finding out I just slept all day, or binged Netflix rather than spend time with him. Like, no, I just wanted to be alone.

Thankfully for me, my body shuts down in cases like that, so I didn't have much trouble sleeping. For me, day 5 was when the withdrawals finally eased off."
Effexor,fduwwju,t3_emujdb,1578740233.0,"Believe me, you'll know. The closest thing I thought of yesterday was the feeling you get when something startles you - the sudden jolt. Add that feeling with literally feeling like someone jolted your brain at the same time. It's like sudden ""zaps"" of dizziness, sort of. Like someone's tazing your brain for a split second. 

They can be okay to deal with for the first little bit, but get progressively more debilitating. I ran out of my meds and was off for two days, and it was to the point I was getting one any time my muscles tensed at all (to move, to breathe, etc)."
depression,fduvrbv,t3_en15we,1578739629.0,"I feel. Way different age group, but when I was around 13 and my cousin, who lived with us for several years and was like my little brother, was 12, his mum took me out for coffee and a contact high (as she often did to get me away from my grandmother, who had custody but was emotionally abusive). I forget now what it was, but when I came home, we were all sitting downstairs in the apartment my aunt and uncle shared (cousin had the bedroom in the main house next to mine) and he was staring at me. I asked why, and really quietly, he goes, ""That's the first time I've seen you laugh in a really long time.""

(Things got way worse before they got any better. But this still makes me tear up 9 years later.)"
AskReddit,fduv9rk,t1_fdru8n5,1578739397.0,"I honestly think she was trying her best to deal with it and didn't know how. She wasn't encouraging them to touch the body or anything, but looking back, it's a lot sadder than what clicked for me at the time. They were all really little (I think the oldest was maybe 6) so they didn't get what was happening to begin with and asked why Grandpa Luke was in the box. They also didn't have a long attention span, so it was only about a 30 second interaction if that, but... It's a weird memory."
