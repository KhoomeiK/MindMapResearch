unpopularopinion,fer03gx,t3_eqfebh,1579348011.0,"As long as a game has objectives or goals then it will be fun to a lot of people. If it's something like Minecraft or space engineers the point is to make your own objectives. Build a castle, build a giant spaceship etc... If anything a campaign is the least 'game' like aspect of the game, because it's not something you can control (except for in choose your own adventure type games). Some people might take the reverse issue, where campaign driven games are boring in comparison to more open, sandbox like games."

I can understand a legal stance to insanity, but realistically, would someone be deemed insane in that situation?"
todayilearned,feoyf2r,t1_fenxojg,1579308093.0,"I suppose it depends how you view insanity. If it's a deviation to standard moral behaviours (not bombing people) then you could make the assumption of insanity. But if you tried to understand their context and motives, then I'd imagine you might get a different answer. In my opinion, Bin Ladin, and other Al Quaeda extremists weren't insane for the twin tower attacks, they were led by their doctrine and extremist beliefs, not because of a mental disorder."
todayilearned,feoxw6a,t1_fenxl90,1579307769.0," I might be arguing semantics here, but if you realise and understand your mental illness, then are you really able to be called insane?

I think the largest problem would be widespread adoption, because initially a high entry cost will prevent widespread availability, and roads will not immediately be safer."

But it's very entertaining to just throw down units and watch them battle it out in a sandbox mode, and some of the levels can be challenging.

AskReddit,fdpddzz,t1_fdpc4rk,1578625788.0,"Voat I have little experience with, but 4chan is mostly edgy satire. There's some racist shit on pol but there is as about much discussion there as there is on r/pewdiepiesubmissions. 

Most conservative subs that label themselves as conservative are echo chambers, like liberal subs, and are often brigaided. It's really hard to get any proper discourse on reddit. 

I find r/geopolitics is fairly level and there isn't much name flinging, but it is mostly liberal. r/unpopularopinion is shit but it has a mix of liberal and conservative ideas. Obviously subs like r/conservative and r/TD are circlejerks but depending on how you phrase a question you might get a serious answer. I've heard r/AskTrumpSupporters can be somewhat okay if your sensitive in asking questions.

AskReddit,fdp79r5,t1_fdp6cae,1578621653.0,"Voat, 4chan, any conservative sub and a reasonable portion of Twitter. 

They are underrepresented in social media. Probably because most conservatives are older, and a lot are drawn to sites like Voat and 4chan where it becomes more extreme. 

I will say though most of 4chan, at least, is satirical conservative humour, it's not a neo-nazi board, nor is there much political discourse. It's where people post porn and frogs.

It and all the other examples are as much a circlejerk as reddit is, so your not going to get much discourse anywhere online."

The US doesn't want to increase tensions any more than anyone else, and nukes are the best way you could possibly increase tensions with Russia or China.

Like I said, Japan could have been handled much better, and I don't agree with bombing either city. But they wanted to make sure that Japan would be scared into submission with the devastation. It also happened 80 years ago. You can't compare the current methods of the US to the goals of a US in the midst of a war, using brand new weaponry with no established regulations.
