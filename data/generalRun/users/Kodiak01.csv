With her [self protection tax](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/1/how-elizabeth-warrens-gun-tax-will-disarm-the-poor/), for starters:

>But Democratic frontrunner [Elizabeth Warren](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elizabeth-warren/) has devised a way to disarm the poor — a steep national gun tax of 30 percent and an ammunition tax of 50 percent.

>Her plan would triple the federal excise tax from its current 10 percent (for handguns) and 11 percent (for shotguns and rifles) and nearly quintuple the ammunition tax from its current 11 percent.

This is nothing more than a version of the Poll Tax applied to the 2nd amendment.   If you can't afford it, Warren is clear that the poor have no right to self defense.

You can't support this and be against Poll Taxes at the same time. To do so is the height of hypocrisy."

Obviously in this situation it didn't sound like the buyer got approved for financing so it didn't matter, but say they did at some stupid-high interest rate. At what point would you put your principles over your own income?

A salesman is there to satisfy the customer's desires while making as much money as possible.  Qualifying a customer financially is as much to determine what range they're able to get into as much as it is determining if you're wasting your time.  Although it may piss one off on occasion, there is nothing wrong with telling an obstinate customer, ""Sorry, I can't help you.""

loseit,ff36z68,t3_er67ar,1579535173.0,">Muscle does burn more at rest and raises your basal metabolic rate (just a smidge), 

To put a little more detail on this:

The average body requires ~2-4kcal/day to maintain a pound of fat.  To maintain the same pound of muscle requires ~6-12kcal/day.  The net difference would then be 4-8kcal/lb/day.

While 4-8 may not seem like a lot, sustained losses and gains in the proper areas can make it a lot easier to KEEP weight off.

I had a long winded example, but deleted it all to say this:  A new lifter, lifting heavy and properly nourished is capable of gaining 2lbs/mo of muscle in the first year.  This is 12-24kcal/day increase per month.  Over a year, that can goes up to 144-288kcal/day.  That is 4320-8640kcal additional burned per month.  Chances are it's going to be closer to the low end (studies vary on the exact amount, hence the range being used here). 

That's still over a pound per month MORE in kcal that your body is burning just to maintain your new muscle.

It also means that once you have put in the work, you're not going to turn into Agustus Gloop just because you wanted a a piece of birthday cake or or cheeseburger.

In the second year of heavy work, a lifter can add up to an additional pound of muscle per month.  Now, we're up to 216-432kcal/day used to maintain this new mass, or 6480-12960kcal/mo.  That's 1.85lbs/mo, even on the low end!

Much to the dismay of many, however, the work doesn't stop here.  You still need to work to MAINTAIN this muscle mass; just like dietary changes, it's a lifestyle change not a quick permanent fix.  As long as you do, you'll come to realize just how much easier it is to actually keep the excess **fat** (not weight) off."

It would take that computer 50.263 seconds to guess 2^44 passwords.
