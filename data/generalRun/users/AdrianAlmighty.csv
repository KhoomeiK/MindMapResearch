Even in dispensaries (in Arizona), there is a legal requirement to have an armed guard. Those guys are super chill (dealing with stoners all day long), but they have that 1% thought in their head that ""I'm guarding a trap house"". You only need three guys with assault rifles to shut the place down and clean house. Everybody has cash, there's drugs readily available. It's not about them making clean, there's cameras all over, direct links to PD and all, but people rob banks?

I know we have sympathies for addicts and an urge to legalize, but these two cannot.
