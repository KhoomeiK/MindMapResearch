If you did it out of what you think kindness is that's fine, but no one asked for your charitable outpouring in the first place because no one was confused or needed clarification."
thisismylifenow,ffg0b9n,t1_ff2lshs,1579895696.0,It's a weird presumption to think that your interpretation was necessary. It was easy enough to understand based on context. If you thought it was so hard to understand that it needed your translation than I will leave you be.

Engineering talk: It's understandable to think that it is a fault, seeing as not many find that feature desirable, but a boring machine that is interesting can't actually exist. It would either cancel out and be a regular machine or it would be and interesting machine."

Science talk: I believe this makes Free Beer a carrier, but it's very rare to have the genetic makeup for the disease to be able to integrate itself into. Similar to how rabies causes a fear of water, this particular condition renders the host fearful of improper tree placement, receipt loss and not having an axe at all times."
titanfall,ffbxiza,t3_esmjj7,1579785971.0,"Side note, the CAR was just under S-tier in TF1 for non-godly players, like myself. The attachments made it pretty versatile for short to mile-long range and it was a pretty quick handling gun.

I know there are different playstyles but the CAR covered a decent range and with how the leveling process worked in TF1, the CAR was seen a lot more than it is now, outshadowed by the R101 but I think mainly because the latter was unlocked right after regen."

heroes3,fe9j7qu,t3_eo4gei,1578938021.0,"It boils down to how much you enjoy micromanaging the game. As a turn based game, there is a distinct limit to what can actually be a correct action, and as far as games go, it's much easier to figure out within a small percentage what the next best move is.

When you don't know a map, the best plan is to explore, the best move to make is to go toward known quantities of value like resources, artifacts and hero buff sites. Most often it is a good investment to buy additional explorer heroes early on in order to gather up resources and claim mines quickly.

Evaluate actions on a per turn basis, conserve movement and make sure you use it perfectly each turn, when going into the unknown, don't always go straight in, sometimes one step at a time is best. On larger maps, your gold per day is often a priority, as the more days you make the most gold you can, you want to generate the max amount as early as possible. Small maps necessitate gathering materials before others, as the percentage of game material is mostly on the map, being smaller and more confined and having shorter game lengths. Larger maps offer more resource generation over time from mines and towns because they last longer.

Hero skills factor in heavily as well. Logistics and Wisdom are always useful on almost every map, navigation or sorcery depend on how much you'll do on sea or how many damage spells you have, eagle eye is trash, explanations abound. Specialization is good for late game heroes, don't pick archery unless you plan on stacks of high tier shooters for your army composition.

Creature combat it very solvable, to the point it's pretty easy to go head to head with similar strength armies and take advantage of speed spells and bluffs and stomp the opposition. Simple turn denial is massively powerful in this game during combat phases.

Town build order is pretty logical, prioritize based on map size usually. Small, get dwellings quickly, large, get long term generation up first, capitol/castle.

What it sounds like is that you are at the rose colored glasses stage where long term decisions are not your main focus, you have been learning and enjoying the game for the fun, and now you want to get deeper into the mechanical side of it. It has the potential to become more work if you let it, so keep that in mind. If the number crunching is what you like, then learning how to make optimal turns may be fun for you."

Your age and dependency status matter here for secondary reasons, but with the information given, your mother is skirting the law and is almost certainly violating it in some way.

The primary problem with her method is that she cannot prove that the hairs were collected in a suitable manner to prove they were taken properly and unadulterated from the time the sample was collected to the time it was analyzed.

Add to that, your DNA cannot just be harvested and used without your express concent in a drug test. Compliance can be made compulsory by entities requesting it and the results or refusal to comply can be used to determine the action to be taken.

Since no entity directly contacted you to ask for your participation, there was no reason for your submission. So that is a problem for your mother as well.

As others have mentioned, whatever she has done to collect the sample was illegal or her use of the sample was illegal in some form or fashion and it is necessary for you to contact a legal professional immediately for your defence. You may also want to press charges for malicious intent and defamation, along with whatever violations came with the sample collection and submission without your knowledge and approval."
