The biggest challenge I think would be the music itself. What's it's sound? Is this a punk-rock musical?  New-sound broadway with minor key belters? Something more genre like Six or Hamilton?

There is a fair amount of raging at the gods — or raging at *whatever* in place of gods — and plotting a tenuous path forward doing what you can among inescapable things happening to you. The story traces nuanced and insightful character arcs of the rationalist, the spiritualist, the questioner as they are all bound together out of necessity, and at the same time it never lacks Pratchett's wit and humour.

The appendix offers a pretty solid list of recordings that cover some of the most significant and a few less common gems from the 1940s up trough Hamilton.

Below is the list of shows, his appendix goes on to specify which recordings he finds the most representative and successful. I’ve made what of those I can find on Spotify into a playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6NsRaEI2lQ3wQBJ70cIfR5?si=j2YQ4aTtTx2CPbJ2uH_oaw).

There are plenty of shows worth listening to that don't make this list (niche, cult, and new, are largely excluded)\* but for anyone looking to get a sense of the feel for Broadway Musicals, it's a pretty great primer.
