keto,fffwzjx,t3_et9ac7,1579893636.0,"I feel like Keto, at it's essence, is taking mastery of your own body. Addictions to sugars, carbs, booze, et cetera, robs one of this mastery. These things hold us back. When we overcome these addictions, we have control over ourselves, and our lives. 

Alcohol is notorious for robbing us of our mastery. People rely on it sometimes to cope with stress, but it robs one of their agency, their memory, their finances, and in some cases, their lives. 

Everyone has their own choices, everyone has their own opinions, but more often than not, anything that takes away your agency is something that isn't worthy of ones time.

Congrats on your progress, and for stopping your stall.

Heres to obtaining your goals as this new year opens!"

I've worn fragrances that make my stomach turn a little as time goes on, but when I ask those around me if I smell terrible( because I feel like I must smell terrible), They say the fragrance  is fine. 

I would try praying your current perfumes on clothes instead of Skin. That way, if it does have something to do with your chemistry, it will give you a little more time before it all mixes and turns sour. It might give you a little more time wearing the scents you have. 

I would next advise on samples and decants if you continue your quest for a scent that works for you. I am no expert, but all of the perfumes you listed are all sort of similar in price point. If you look into samples or decants, you'll be able to test and see if the more expensive scents ( like Tom Ford, for example) do the same thing. You can run all the same tests without buying a full bottle."

They were normally made of wood, lightweight, and symmetrical, with a shallow draft and  they also had a sail. They didn't have a heavy keel that would get stuck in shallow water.  They also have a lot of oars. 

This allowed them to pull up an nearly any beach or go up any river, and because their boats were symmetrical, they could be rowed in either direction. They didn't need to go forward to circle around, they could just turn around. The addition of so many oars would also allow for movement against the current, thus improving their ability to sail up rivers from the ocean, and reach areas further inland."

In the Long patrol, when she was in her hayday, she  was so overtaken by the blood wrath and she kept fighting  even though she had taken several grievous wounds to the head from Damung Warfang. Even before the battle, she was constantly ahead of the long patrol hares that she was leading. 

In Taggerung, Tagg was able to hunt down and slay Vallug with an arrow full in his chest, and while we can assume he was a fierce warrior, Cregga was called Rose eyes, the belle of the Bloodwrath. If she had been in her Long Patrol days and Vallug had come knocking,  I would have no doubt that she could have charged him, chased him down, and Slain him, arrows or no arrows. 

By the end of Taggerung, Cregga had outlived Abbess song, Abbot Arven, and Abbess Tansy. And after Song had passed on, there was several years without any abbey leader at all in which she sorta of stepped in. 

The Redwall wiki seems to agree with my assessment

"" Near the end of her vast lifespan she took an arrow in the chest from the bow of [Vallug Bowbeast](https://redwall.fandom.com/wiki/Vallug_Bowbeast), and was fatally injured. It should be noted, however, that were it not for Cregga's extreme age at this time, it is possible and maybe even probable that she would have survived. A great feast was thrown in her honor and she died shortly afterward. ""
