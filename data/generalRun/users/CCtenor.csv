tumblr,fftk7ja,t3_euyhaf,1580222701.0,"Yup. Also, nude models apparently only pose for a few minutes at a time both so they don’t get tired, and so artists become accustomed to sketching the most important parts of a scene quickly. You’re also not guaranteed to get pretty models, and my brother told me that figure drawing was basically the hardest class he took during the time he was in the art program at UNF. 

Drawing nude models is incredibly difficult because people are used to seeing people all the time. Any little thing you get wrong can make a piece feel less real, and if you don’t learn proper form, weight, and shading, you’ll never be able to draw anything with a convincing sense of reality whether it’s a photorealistic drawing or a fancy cartoon. 

Pablo Picasso is attributed with having said “Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist”. People spend a lot of time figure drawing so they can understand the rules of drawing a human body. Anybody can draw a tree that looks good enough with a bit of practice, but people spend lifetimes learning to master elements of the human body. 

That part as the end about the guy having spent the last 10 minutes trying to get the shading in the model’s breasts right and being on the verge of tears because he’s running out of paint? That’s probably what the majority of art models see when they’re working for universities or art schools.

Artistic nude art is very difficult for both the artist and the model because people assume it’s just some dude getting horny drawing pretty young women."
MurderedByWords,fftjdme,t1_fftathi,1580222093.0,"I have curly hair, and used to wear it short up until a few years ago because I would basically just get it buzzed, since that’s what my mom would do to save money. 

However, I’d had a professional job for a few years, and I decided I would learn how to groom myself properly, and get a cut that flattered my hair. 

I’m a guy who has probably spent upwards of a de hundred dollars just on experimenting with products and hair alone. I went from cartridge razors, to shavettes, to straight razors. I’ve bought beard balm and shaving oil. I’ve got an adjustable trimmer to style and line my beard to the appropriate length. I’ve got decent blow dryer. I spend between 20-40 minute in the morning so that I can make sure my hair doesn’t look like a total rats nest when I walk out the door. 

My mom, bless her heart, doesn’t understand why I spend so much on a special haircut for people with curtly hair. My parents didn’t grow up with a lot, so I can understand why they don’t like the long showers and expensive product and how long it takes me to get ready in the morning, but it’s either that, or spend no money to have a face constantly breaking out due to shaving with bad tools that tug at my hair, and a buzzed hairstyle that I’d grown to all but hate. I overheard a girl joking that I might be metrosexual because of how much I care about my appearance, and I’m convinced that the term isn’t any kind of legitimate sexuality but is instead meant to mock guys who care about maintaining a groomed appearance.

And if I was ever in a situation where I was a single dad raising my young daughter, I would absolutely go out of my way to learn how to do this for her, because I has to learn to do it to me. I love this post because this type of stuff is crushing to my self esteem because I have a poor self esteem and relationship with my appearance. These types of things are considered “girly” and not noticed by people once they’re used to you, but I deal with it because it’s something I do for me. 

I would be crushed if I spent this time as a parent to be a good dad, but the effort was dismissed like this, and nobody came out to defend it. Hygiene is easy, but good grooming is hard. This dad could have easily learned how to keep his daughter clean and tidy, and nothing more. He went above and beyond to not only keep her daughter in good hygiene, but also better fulfill a role that was missing in her life just so she wouldn’t miss out on an experience that I’m *certain* she sees every day in her school age peers.

tumblr,ffsjq5t,t1_ffsal7u,1580183391.0,"You could have just been honest and opened up with the “I believe calling out bigotry is also bigotry” line, because that’s all this is. 

You really don’t believe that women face a particular type of discrimination that men don’t have to deal with, even when we have studies and evidence that clearly show otherwise? “Mansplaining” isn’t condescending men, it’s describing a particular type of misogynist attitude that women in particular face.

But, since you *again* are choosing to deliberately misread my words and take context into account. 

If a man were to create “womansplaining” as a word that describes a particular set of struggles that men face in their daily lives where their coworkers generally do not take them seriously on account of their gender, their peers assume they don’t know anything about certain subjects because they are male, where clients and customers deliberately ask to speak to a woman because they can’t believe a man can be qualified to speak on a certain subject, then it would be completely valid to do so. It’s also why I said I’ve heard people use “whitesplain” before: it’s a term that describes how white people try to explain away the racist experiences that minorities have lived through. “oh, that’s not really racism, that guy is just an asshole” is a perfect example of whitesplaining.

But, if people are just coining “womansplain” because “mansplaining is sexist”, they’re not actually labeling a certain kind of shared experience, their reacting to what they feel is a silly label that is describing a made up experience. 

But, I’m done here. This is the second time you’ve failed to read what I wrote and understand context. As I said before, if you choose to willingly ignore context, we can’t have a productive discussion because we believe that experiences work in fundamentally different ways. The fact yet you believe having a name for a particular kind of sexism is sexist itself is proof enough of that. I try to avoid people who play the “labeling bigotry is bigotry” card."
tumblr,ffrym5x,t1_ffrtjk6,1580168882.0,"> I'm talking about current usage. The way people are actually using words right now. 


You’re if ignoring the statement I made immediately after this, about how the prevalence of “man-splain” has introduced the concept of “noun-splain” and even gave an example of an alternative that I’ve heard used before.

> And yet people would get extremely upset if I used that word in any context, and rightfully so. Because the N-word is inherently racist and no amount of black people ""owning it"" will ever make it okay for a white person to say.


You’re ignoring how context changes the meaning and usage of a word, even as you’re explaining the very concept itself. You should be able to understand should be able to understand that just because a word is used in an offensive way doesn’t make that word offensive, and just because a word is offensive doesn’t mean it magically changes to be inoffensive based on how people use it. 

What determines if a word is offensive or not depends on why the word was created and the intent of its use.

> This is a strawman argument. I am not basing my argument on the fact that the word ""man"" is in there.


Why else would people find the term offensive? If the word was explain, we wouldn’t be jabng this discussion in the first place. The only reason people are having this discussion, that you and I are having this discussing, is because the word is **man**splain, not **ex**plain, or any other term. 

> 1.) The word ""mansplaining"" is flippant and dismissive, a way of rejecting another person's input without reason or argument


If that’s how some people use the word, that doesn’t change what the word actually means, like how people will casually toss out “fascist” as a meaningless insult. “mansplain” has an actual meaning that people deliberately ignore when they use it as a casual insult, the same way that “trigger warning” has a real meaning, but people use it to mock people who get upset it arguments. 

> 2.) Sexist down-talking warrants said rejection


I completely agree. So call out the people who use the term “mansplain” as a flippant insult, not the fact that the term “mansplain” actually exists. 

> 3.) The term is misused more often than it is used properly, used to dismiss any statement a man makes that the other party wants to flippantly reject, rather than just sexist ones.


That depends far too much on context for you to be able to assert this claim as a fact. I’ve seen plenty of people use mansplain correctly. I see far more people use “nazi” and “fascist” as casual insults than with their actual meaning. That doesn’t mean that nazi, fascist, and mansplain have magically lost their meaning. 

> 4.) ""Womansplaining"" as a term would absolutely be considered an insult by any of the people who use ""mansplaining"".


You have to look at the context of why such a term would be created. Are people using “womansplain” to actually describe a particular shared experience of a certain group of people, or are they using it as a mocking counter to “mansplain”? Like I said, mansplain actually means something. I dare you to ask any woman on your life what “mansplain” actually means, and I’m almost certain you’ll find shockingly similar answer because the term actually describes something women actually go through.

Again, this entirely depends on the context for why rome would actually use “womansplain”.

> 5.) 3 & 4 result in a usage pattern where there is inherent bias towards men being the primary/only group where ""-splaining"" is a problem, which is sexist.

> And go ahead and apply a similar list of statements to ""whitesplaining"" while we're at it. I highly doubt you would take kindly to anyone referring to things you say as ""blacksplaining"", regardless of whether or not it would be accurate by definition.


Again, context, context, context. 

Your entire reply boils down to you deliberately choosing to ignore the context of words, their creation, and their usage, to argue that terms are or aren’t sexist because of your anecodtal experience with the word. Of course you can argue that any word can mean anything and anything can be offensive or not if you just ignore context entirely. 

But if you’re going to choose to ignore that context, we really can’t continue this conversation, because we’re both going to be arguing under a completely different set of assumptions regarding how language works and evolves over time."
tumblr,ffroj1v,t1_ffrj6on,1580162338.0,"Just because the terms don’t exist or aren’t commonly used doesn’t mean that it can’t be done. 

“Mansplain” *is* a specific term, and it happens to be commonly used, but it introduced the “noun-splain” concept.  I’ve heard “whitesplain” used several times before.

But, as I explained in a other comment in more detail, “mansplain” isn’t sexist just because it speedily refers to an all to common experience women have to live through in their lives, and just because people abuse the term doesn’t magically make it a bad term, or rice any validity to using it another way.

I’m a mixed race puerto rican and I’ve used nigga plenty of times among my friends, and even called a few of them negro/negra when I’m teasing them about a righteous tan they’ve gotten from being outside a lot.

Gay used to be an emotion and it now refers to a sexuality. 

While I acknowledge that words change mankind over time, I refuse the idea that “mansplain” is a sexist term *just* because “man” is in the word itself. “Men’s basketball” isn’t sexist just because it denotes men playing basketball. “women’s tennis” isn’t sexist just because it refers to women playing tennis. 

And “mansplaining” isn’t sexist just because it refers to a specific shared experience that, as far as I know, pretty much every woman has gone through in some way and at some punt in their life, and can all describe in almost exactly the same kind of way."
tumblr,ffrndxf,t1_ffrg20j,1580161644.0,"> I think it's better to leave one word as an individual who explains something to someone who knows more about the subject.


We already have words that mean that, though. Being an asshole. Being ignorant. Being an idiot. being arrogant. Hubris. Pride. People use “Dunning-Kruger” as a stand-alone term to describe exactly this. heck, just plain uninformed, or just “he didn’t really know why he was talking about”

“mansplain” *specifically* refers to the experience many women have and face in many areas of their lives, whether it be a husband that doesn’t take them seriously, a boss that fails to acknowledge, a client or customer that desires a male employee, etc.

The fundamental issue with what you want is that “mansplain” is not a generic term in the first place. When a kid is trying to explain how (they think) a stove works to his parent, he’s not “mansplaining”. Heck, if I was explaining to a woman something I believed about her life or body so I could have her correct me on my misunderstanding, that’s not mansplaining either. Hell, if I’m explaining something to someone else just because I never really knew that they already were an expert on the subject, not even *that” is mansplaining. 

Mansplaining is specifically when a man assumes to know more than a woman about her experiences, or he areas of expertise, primarily because of her gender. 

> That way the focus isn't about a group of people, which is generalized leads people to believe that if it's a word that exists, it's probably common. Mansplaining suffers from this because certain people pick it up, misuse it, or use it to berate someone, and in turn, berate a group of people.


Words aren’t inherently bad just because they refer to a group of people or a common occurrence, words are bad because they’re used in deragatory ways. 

Nigger, as far as I can tell, comes from a bastardization of negro, which is literally just the Spanish word for “black”. both the words stem from the Latin word “niger”, which means black. 

Now, nigger is an offensive, racist slur, but a lot of minorities benignly refer to each other as nigga. 

And, a handful of times, when I see a friend of mine who has spent a lot of time in sunny conditions and have a tan, I’ll jokingly greet them with “Hey, negro/negra, como estas?” (hey, black male/female, how are you?) I even had a former coworker and current friend explain to me rather eloquently why he doesn’t like to be called “African American” and just prefers to be called “black”.

There is no word under the sun that people won’t use to put each other down. If a color can evolve into a racial slur, and an emotion can eventually come to refer to a sexuality, there is no concept on earth or in heaven that is immune from your complaint. 


>  The definition should be about a PERSON not a GROUP OF PEOPLE.


Again, a word isn’t inherently bad because it refers to a quality, an individual, a group of people, a specific behavior, an idea, etc. A word is bad because it is deliberately used that way by bad people. 

People took a color and turned it into a racial slur. 

People took a medical condition and turned it into a deragatory term (retard).

People take psychological conditions and use them to berate other, or excuse their toxic behavior (bipolar).

I just don’t see anything particularly compelling about your objection. The reason “mansplaining” came to be is that women needed a way to describe something specific that happens to them. The reason “microaggression” exists is because minorities needed a term to describe actions that are rooted in racist ideological structures, but may not happen as a result of conscious action, or may be otherwise benign actions in other contexts. The reason people develop these languages is to describe specific things that happen to them that aren’t adequately described by the language they already have. 

The reason these words came to be is because the words we had weren’t enough. If “individual who explains something to someone who knows more about the subject” was enough, we never would have needed a new word to describe what was happening."
OverwatchUniversity,ffrerhn,t1_ffr8t9i,1580156606.0,"> Instead of actually enforcing a competitive and cooperative mindset in their playerbase, they just give people the tools to be one man armies that can play the game without even bothering about ""the team""...


This is the *cause* of the problem they’re trying to solve, not a solution for it. 

I explain more about how to encourage team play here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/eugmjn/3_shatters_in_66_seconds_ft_awesome_healers/ffr4ntl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


You cannot have a team oriented game if the game itself isn’t designed in a way to encourage team play. All the way from having functioning reporting systems, to enforcing proper gameplay in each mode, to designing characters so they depend on the team coming together as a whole, people don’t bother playing as a team because blizzard has a repeatedly designed away from a game that encourages team play.


> Overwatch is this highly cooperative and competitive game,


I have to disagree with this. Overwatch is designed and marketed as a team based game, but it’s design and execution are *regularly* pulled between a team death match game and an actual team game. When there is nothing in the game that actually encourages team play, and the devs respond to the myriad criticisms people have raised in ways that indicate they would rather not offend anybody, people get upset and take matters into their own hands. 

For example, the devs will often cite in game metrics for why certain characters are or aren’t overpowered. While it is useful to know where characters stand, the way that a lot of rebuttals just kind of end there doesn’t give any indication that they understand what actually caused the compliant in the first place.

A lot of the problem in the game, and a lot of the attitudes players have, stem from the fact that the devs just don’t want to offend anybody. When you don’t want to offend anybody, you seek to design out problems rather than design in tools.

Ana being dependent on the team wasn’t the problem, the problem was that every other hero in the game was too independent. Every other healer had an effective tool for dealing with, or dissuading, flankers.

And, as a general rule, most of the characters that have become a persistent problem have done so because, for that moment in time, they did were completely independent. 

Mercy. She didn’t need to do anything except sit and wait for rez. Then, she became god. Now, she’s actually inns decent spot. 

Brig basically singlehandedly killed dive because she was a tank/healer that had every single tool the game offered for dealing with flankers. Why would you run any other healer? Same with moira, except as a DPS/Healer hybrid. 

Look at reaper and mei. They don’t need anybody else to do their jobs, most of the time, or at least they don’t really require anybody else to actively help them do their job. Mei in particular is pretty bad. Can’t get close, cause she freezes. Can’t fight from far because wall. Self heal. Decent projectile. She can tank, split teams, CC.

In overwatch, as a rule, characters are designed to be capable of operating independently of the team, or are eventually changed so they can operate independently. You cannot have a healthy team game where the heroes are designed to be able to operate independently of their team. If you have heroes that can function independently, players will never learn that their role is necessary. 

I won’t say every single problem blizzard has had is because of this, but every single problem blizzard still has that have persisted throughout the lifetime of the game most definitely has been because of this. 

Why are players toxic? because players won’t play as a team. Why won’t players play as a team? Because blizzard wont design their game so that playing as a team is necessary to success. Because they won’t deal with community problems involving trolls, leavers, cheaters, and throwers in a timely manner. Because their approach to designing this game isn’t to make working together necessary, but to simply avoid being offensive."

I used to carry maybe 15 or 20 pounds of textbooks when I was in college, and would ride longboard between classes. My backpack also had a chest strap (not the same as a hip strap, but better than no strap), and I would cinch all 3 straps down so there was no slack, and it basically opened up my world to what actually carrying a backpack comfortably felt like.

tumblr,ffr88me,t1_ffr422z,1580152592.0,"Yeah, I don’t understand how people get offended at this term. 

I know someone posted the actual definition above, but I’ve always taken “mansplaining” to mean “when a man assumes they know more about a topic they are explaining to a woman.”

For example, if I (male) assume I know more about how a woman’s body than she does when I’m talking to her about, say, tampon sizes, I’m mansplaining tampons to her. 

Or, if I’m explaining computers to her when she’s actually an electrical engineer and works for intel, I’m mansplaining to her. 

Mansplaining is the male presuming to know more than a woman on a topic and insisting he knows what’s up.

And it’s not a sexist term because womansplaining is a thing, it just happens less often in practice because women are more often in a piston of having to have something explained to them by men. 

To be completely fair, the term isn’t “mansplain” at this point, it’s “noun-splain”, because it can be a white person, a skinny person, a blind person or sighted person. The only thing “nounsplaining” does is specifically call out a particular kind of toxic behavior and set of assumptions.

Yes, the word gets misused many times (just like every other word too), but just because it gets used doesn’t make it inherently sexist because it’s was never meant to assume a condition but describe a condition.

Overwatch,ffr4ntl,t1_ffqvagy,1580150373.0,"TL;DR at the end.

Contrary to the design decisions blizzard has made so far, heroes need to become *more* dependent on team play. Each role should have 1 hero that is an archetype of that role. For example, Rein is the tank archetype, mercy is the healer archetype, and soldier is the DPS archetype (to use characters that released with the game).

These characters should have distinct and obvious strengths and weakness. Rein’s hammer should be a powerful close range tool, his mobility hampered by his shield. Also, these characters should have clearly defined weakness. Rein doesn’t have any ranged options, and has lesser mobility with shield up. Additionally, these characters should have as little distracting elements as possible. Rein can’t be a true DPS character, Soldier only deals damage, mercy only heals or revives. 

Once you’ve accomplished this, you need to design characters around the holes that are left behind my your 3 archetype. Rein isn’t very mobile, so you design a hero that grants mobility. Mercy heals a lot, so you design a hero that blocks heals. Soldier puts out a lot of damage, but very mobile, so you design a more mobile damage dealer. Then, you work on those characters until they fit into the meta in as balanced a way as possible, and you reevaluate the game. What does the meta look like? What holes are in the meta that can be filled by new tools? Does anybody need to be adjusted?

So, that mobile hero now oppresses your healer. You have handful of options now, because you can either create a healer that has the tools to deal with the flanker, or you can nerf that flanker, or you can create a completely new character that deals with that flanker, or you can adjust your healer to be able to deal with the flanker. Changing your healer to deal with the flanker is the worst option. You’re removing one of her clearly defined weakness and making her identity and role ambiguous in the game. Mercy now has a mobility move, so she is too mobile for the mobile heroes while being able to quickly fly to a tank to avoid the more powerful DPS heroes (as an example).

Creating a healer with tools to deal with a a flanker is a decent option, but you have to make sure that they aren’t too powerful on their own. Ana has a sleep dart, which is fine, but it shouldn’t be available every fight. She should be forced to choose between dealing with a flanker personally, or using the sleep dart for team utility, for example. 

However, you cannot create a brig, who is a healer with every available tool necessary to deter flanking heroes. That’s an overtuned hero that will either always be too powerful, or too underpowered. eventually, that type of hero will be changed to a point where they might fit into the meta, but they’ll probably be ineffective in the role they were originally designed for, the way Brig now is against the dice characters she was meant to deter. 

You can create a new hero to deal with the flankers. In comes Roadhog. Usually, this is the best option, because a new hero means new opportunities for tools to be introduced and clever weakness to be exploited.

You can do the same with a DPS as well, but I’ll use this opportunity to interject that you never want a hero to shut down it’s weakness, and you never want a hero to shut down its own class. You do not want ~~a DPS~~ another flanker hero to shut down your flanker, because people will just switch to that new hero when the flanker is used, and you do not want a healer that shuts down flankers because then there is no point to picking the flanker. If you’re going to have a hero be the strongest against another, it should be a hero that isn’t related to that hero’s strengths or class. a tank can shut down flankers because they’re not just another ~~damage dealing class~~ flanker, ~~and they don’t make the flanker irrelevant~~. The healer is still weak to flankers, but you can now balance the tank between his role as a tank and anti flanker. 

You keep iterating on this process. occasionally, you go back and tweak the older heroes to be better defined in the presence of new heroes. You have a ton of healers now, so maybe Soldier doesn’t need a biotic grenade that other characters can take advantage of, maybe it’s a stim pack that only works on himself. You work on heroes to make them more distinct. Is hog learn to be an anti flanker in general? Why does he have a self heal? Can we give push? How about we replace his self heal with a push, which further defines his role as a body guard/bouncer. He has a hook for punishing flankers who are positioned poorly, and he has a boop that he can use against flankers that have gotten in close to his healers.

What blizzard have been doing instead is designing out problems by using sledgehammer solutions and adjusting characters to be more effective against their weaknesses. 

Doomfist was an attempt to force Dive to be viable against against 3 and 4 tank. Tanks *should* be effective against flanker characters. Brig was a one stop shop of every tool a player could ever need to shut down flankers. She was a healer effective against flankers, and a tank effective at outputting stuns and damage. She didn’t require help, because she was all the help that healers and tanks needed in the first place, all while being a healer and tank herself. Same with Moira: healers didn’t do enough and depended on other people to ward off flankers or do damage, so we’ll make a mobile heal/DPS hybrid that can put out respectable damage, ward off flankers, and has mobility that puts some mobility based characters to shame. She’s a healer that didn’t really need to play with he team to be effective. 

And if you look at the language that the devs have used when talking about balance changes, what kinds of problems they’ve reacted to, and how they’ve designed heroes, you’ll see that a lot of their reactions and changes haven’t actually been to create a new character that brings new gameplay elements to the table, they’ve been characters that address a compliant the community had, or changed to a character to make them more effective in an area they were weak in before. This leads to a meta where certain characters just are better than others, and players don’t have to rely on their team, because the characters become more homogeneous over time, or lose weaknesses to exploit.

Ana was either too powerful, or too underpowered. Rather than see if there was a niche that could be filled by a new designed, blizzard tried adjusting her tools until she became the opposite of what she was before, or they nerfed the characters that were strong against her until they were no longer effective (since they couldn’t really be used in another role). The pinnacle of these design decisions were the introduction of Moira and Brig, and I’ve outlined why they were so bad above. 

I know it’s cliché, but you need to design your characters like rock paper scissors. It doesn’t matter of you have 3 classes, or 5 classes, or 9 classes, all that matters is that every character be clearly strong at one thing, and clearly weak at a other. Every character needs to enable another, while itself depending on a other to be enabled. 

Look again at Moira. What does she do? She enables players by putting out high healing, and she does decent damage with her right click and orb. The fact that her healing depends on a resource that replenishes when she damages means she needs to balance the two jobs. What is she not doing at any given time? Tanking. So, because she’s good against flankers, good at putting out damage, and good at healing, we need to make sure she depends on he tanks to stay alive. 

Meaning she shouldn’t have her fade. I’m not saying it should be nerfed, I’m saying it should be removed, because just *having* fade limits what the devs can do to balance her without making her feel either overwhelming or underpowered. I guarantee you that if they remove her fade, it will allow her to be balanced more fairly, and it may even open up a design space for another character.

***TL;DR***

Basically, in order for the game to force players to work together, you *need* to give heroes well defined strengths and weaknesses that players can identify and exploit. While the strengths and weakness should be obvious, the actual mechanics you want to use can be greatly varied and have plenty of depth and interaction.

By actively trying to design out the problem areas that different characters have, blizzard discourages players from working together as a team, and severely limits their ability to adjust heroes to an appropriate power level within the existing game. Problems *will* arise because characters who have more tools will always be more powerful than characters who are more limited, up until those tools are nerfed so far that the character in question basically can no longer fulfill its original role, but also is ineffective at doing anything else because they’re now simply underpowered.

Overwatch,ffqq7jl,t1_ffqgizc,1580141087.0,"> Moira, you need to heal more

Rein, Eichenwalde, moments after I used every single resource to pocket heal him through his solo crusade at the enemy team’s front line. I used all my juice, bounced my orb off the wall past him so he would be healed for longer, and blasted him with my full ult. There isn’t a solo healer in the game that can out out more healing over the same period of time.

I will not push up past my tanks to heal you. Carry on, my wayward son, I’ll have peace when you are done. If you’re a flanker, I’m not going to come to you, you need to come to me, or get more familiar with health packs. I’m counting on you being able to leverage your mobility so I can focus more resources on less mobile heroes. Pharah, mercy is not in a monogamous relationship with you. We’ll do our best to let her focus on your, but you need to be independent, otherwise you’re taking 2 heroes and turning them into 1.5, or maybe even 1.

People need to trust each other, but I can understand why people don’t because the game hasn’t really been designed in a way that teaches players how their roles work and what teamwork actually looks like. People are usually forced to operate independently, which is what makes OP’s clip feel so exceptional. I mean OP did an amazing job here, don’t get me wrong, but this is really just excellent execution of what should be standard tank play. People misunderstand the roles in the game to the point where we improperly attribute credit to other roles like OP does here.

If I was OP’s healer, I would be thankful to him, and I’d say as much. I’d be glad to have his appreciation, but this is squarely a damn good tank job done by OP. He knew his job, executed it effectively, and all the healer really did was just identify that and fulfill his role. There’s honestly nothing in this clip that I would personally identify as out of the ordinary healer play, they just trusted in the space that OP provided."
OverwatchUniversity,ffqoigm,t1_ffqhcuy,1580139935.0,"> I'm not sure how you retrain people to play as a team this far after release, but it feels like the only answer.


You just have to do it. You have to begin properly policing games. You have to design characters to encourage teamwork. You have to give players tools to work with. The only reason some people are meta-whores is because they don’t have any other tools to work with to coordinate with the team properly. Assholes aren’t punished in a timely fashion, broken characters are left in unbalanced states for too long, the characters with most impact don’t really require any investment from the team. The players aren’t given any information during the match to see who is playing poorly and how they can correct it, nor are they given information before the match to determine who plays best on what hero.

But one thing is certain: the longer it takes for them to actually begin making these changes, the harder it will become. 

I’ve won at least 2, 5v6 matches. In one, a guy left before overtime, so, while we had the match won, the other team could have come back. 

We won by saying “fuck it” to the meta. You know what we did? We *all* verbally agreed to run 3 healers and a solo tank (iirc). Our three healers would basically pocket our single tank into immortality. That was the plan. The DPS pick was essentially an afterthought, but we just told the guy to pick something self sufficient because we would all be basically pocketing the tank into the enemy team. 

We won. Why? Because we were *forced* to work together. We couldn’t have a guy who wasn’t on the same page as us. 

But, outside of situations like that, the game doesn’t really force players to work together in any meaningful capacity. 

Think about dive: while that meta got stale, it was an objectively good meta, because it demanded team coordination to pull off, and it was dynamic to watch. It was a time where the best coordinated teams were rewarded for their ability to execute their strategy well.

However, because the game isn’t designed to teach teamwork organically, the only way to learn this is by watching the pros and copying them. Synergies between heroes are difficult to identify. 

For example, think about the most common complaint about Ana when mobility metas, like Dive, were prevalent. People were actually complaining about Ana because *she depended too much on her team*. My only response is **of course, it’s a team oriented game**. Rather than seeing the problem for what it was - the other healers are far too independent for the level of impact they had - Blizzard was like “you’re right” and either nerfed the heroes that we’re effective against her, or tried to give her more tools so she could operate more independently. 

Think about that for a second. In a **team based game**, people complained too much about a hero depending on her team to be effective, and the developers acquiesced and worked explicitly to make that healer be more independent.

This has been a *consistent* balance problem throughout the entire life of the game. In order to not offend any player, casual or competitive, bronze or professional, they’ve designed out skill checks, removed pain points, and done their best to create a game where anybody can do anything. Instead of designing *for* a specific purpose, they’ve merely designed *against* problems. 

OP brig? She was designed to cock block dive, not to enable counter strategies. Moira was designed to be an independent healer. That’s just kind of it. Not to fill a niche as a just healer character, a healer who could just do it all. Massive healing numbers, unparalleled mobility among supports, solid tools against flankers, decent damage output. Doomfist? Let’s singlehandedly try to being back dive in the middle of 3 and quad tank. 

Hog: he’s literally only effective against squishy, mobile heroes who play out of position. While he did have some consistency issues to sort, his only problems originally were just that people wouldn’t respect the hook. That’s it. Then they reworked his hook, nerfed him, buffed him. He became unable to do any work on his own, so they tweaked his numbers. While I honestly think Hog made it to a decent place in the end, most of his changes weren’t to fix bugs and refine his place as an anti-flanker/positioning tool, most of the changes were because people complained that he either did too much on his own, or didn’t do enough on his own. 

And that’s where blizzard has always consistently failed. They’re not designing with a vision in mind. They’re aren’t proactively designing heroes that bring tools to the game, with strengths that fit into a new niche, and weakness that can be exploited by current heroes; they’re designing reactionary heroes to curb complaints. And that’s not to say that the heroes are bad in and of themselves - each hero has great personality, and truly are interesting and unique additions to the game - but they don’t have an identity beyond fixing some problem as opposed to providing gameplay opportunities.

If you look at the hero additions and balance changes in the last half of this game’a lifetime, it becomes painfully obvious. 

Orisa was an attempt to add a more fun rectangle man.  D. va’s changes made her a moving matrix, and monkey fell out or favor, so blizzard needed more fun dive tank. He needed to be survivals, mobile, and just have more fun tools to play with than the previous dive tanks. Hammond was born. Doomfist was an attempt to give dive some tools against 3 and 4 tank, essentially trying to force dive to be more effective against the meta meant to counter it. Brig was an attempt to neuter dive. Then Moira was an attempt to just avoid healers needing tools against dive altogether. Piss on your team and let them he’s up while you kite flankers with your auto-lock right-click and spammable mobility. 

Hanzo’s scatter arrow was a tool against the tanks that are supposed to make sniping difficult, and storm bow was just trying to get rid of the controversy while maintaining Hanzo’s power against the class that rightfully should make his life difficult. Widow’s hook shot was at one point buffed to the point where diving her became irrelevant, because a sniper somehow deserved to be able to get away from a mobile hero who capitalized on her poor positioning. 

And it’s not like these heroes couldn’t have been released this way, but when you look at why these (and other) heroes are released, how they were released, and what tools they were given when they were released, or changed, you begin to see that these heroes weren’t designed to add to the game, but to remove complaints. 

This comment has already gotten long enough, but I hope it really brings to light the problem with Blizzard’s methodology. 

They are not proactively and deliberately designing with a goal in mind, they are reactively designing to eliminate perceived problems. Why did the game ship without a functioning report system, and it took almost 2 years for the devs to design and include one? It was a reaction to player complaints. The devs don’t adjust old heroes to better define their role in an ever changing game as new heroes are added, they only really touch them to address player complaints, or severe bugs.

You cannot design a game if you have no end goal. Blizzard doesn’t have an end goal beyond “we want to make everybody, in every mode, at skill level, playing any hero, happy.”  If blizzard doesn’t stop being deathly afraid of offending absolutely anybody with what they say, they’re constantly going to be at the whim of the people, and will offend everybody as conflicting decisions continue piling up.

bestof,ffqiwir,t1_ffqfx6y,1580135850.0,"I don’t think there have neen many studies, and it’s the only thing that keeps me from having a stronger opinion on the issue. As far as I know, most sporting bodies allow a trans athlete to participate after being on hormone therapy for something like a year, which most people accept as a sufficient amount of time for the hormone levels of trans athletes to reach the equivalent levels as their cisgender counterparts. After all, most sporting bodies are concerned with testosterone levels. 

But my question is “does this overcome any physiological differences between the grow genders?” which I’m not sure has been studied enough. If it has, and there is a study out, I’d love to see it. 

I want to go with the science on this. I don’t care who competes as long as it’s fair, but I don’t think any sporting bodies have looked much current than ensuring equivalent hormone (ie testosterone) levels."
bestof,ffqiezk,t1_ffqglaf,1580135469.0,"I think the biggest buzz around it is that we don’t know enough about physiological changes to be certain that trans athletes will be able to compete fairly with the gender they identify with. It’s one thing to, say, artificially reduce or modify hormone levels to be the gender you identify as, but I think there hasn’t been en study to determine if the actual physiology has changed enough to things to be fair. 

For example, is a trans athlete that transitioned after male puberty at am advantage over women who hasn’t, or even trans individuals who transitioned before puberty altogether? Is a woman who transitioned after puberty at a disadvantage? does it have to do with overall fitness and working out, such that a young, athletic man who transitioned after puberty still reaps the benefits of those changes, or can even a man who wasn’t athletic transition to a woman but still have those benefits. 

I *personally* think we might be jumping the gun without studying this better. I know that we seem to have studies that indicate a trans athlete is the practically the same as a cis gender individual, but is that enough? Would it be better to have a category for transgender athletes? Would it be better to limit what sports transgender athletes can compete in?

After all, the entire reason sports were gendered is because we understand there are differences in physiology between men and women that would make competition completely unfair no matter what rules, regulations, policies, or handicaps were in place. Are we absolutely sure that just a year of hormone treatments is enough to eliminate that gap?"

Overwatch,ffqgncp,t1_ffps9aj,1580134038.0,"This is very true, but that can sometimes be mitigated ny healers. What I’m really trying to say is that, while I appreciate this guy’s support of his healers, and I’m not saying they didn’t do a good job, this clip is really something his team should be thanking him for. 

This clip is truly not possible without him. A tank not stepping in can be partially accommodated by some better healing, or maybe a little bit less healing can be supported with better DPS pressure, but the guy here who can’t be replaced is Rein and his ability to efficiently decide between when to hammer, when to shield, and when to back off.

This is a solid tank with, good decision making, whose ability was recognized by the rest of his team. I thank him for recognizing his supports, but his team should be pouting one out for him, in my opinion."
OverwatchUniversity,ffqfvql,t1_ffqd8j8,1580133386.0,"I don’t know if overwatch keeps track of comms at all, but I would report comms if the guy spent the whole march doing nothing but berating a person. I figured they must have some tool to determine if the report is valid, or that at least the rest of the team would also report for such bad behavior. 

If I see a guy post something offensive in the chat, like actually offensive language, it’s an immediate report. I’m good with jokes, and I have a horrible sense of honor with my friends that, out of context, would be incredibly offensive, so I’m usually decent about jokes. 

But if I see people dropping hard R n-words, calling people bitches, typing kys, etc, that’s an immediate report from me. In my experience, those people usually do a good job of providing extra evidence in the chat at some point in the game. 

However, I have found that reports have become less frequent. I’d say in the last year, or so, I’ve gotten less report confirmations than immediately after the report system came out. I don’t know if it’s because people are using the report system less, or if it’s because the system has somehow become less effective, or if the system was somehow filtering out my reports somehow, but there were people I reported who wrote some damn nasty stuff in the chat, but I’d go a while before getting a confirmation message.

Honestly, I’m going to keep saying it, but blizzard need to have a clear vision for how they want to balance their game. They need to communicate better with the players, and they need to be more firm in explaining their vision to the players. A lot of players has been complaining about throwers and smurfs for a while since the beginning of the game, but people enjoyed the game because it was new, the devs communicated often, and there was a lot of content to play. However, there was only so much people could do without a repost system and, by the time the devs implemented one, a lot of people were already fed up with players’ attitudes. 

The devs don’t want to design comp to be competitive, or the heroes to force teamwork. All of the changes to the characters have strived to make them less dependent on the team doing its job together. While I understand it’s important for every role to have fun, you can’t encourage players to play as a team of heroes can just go off on their own and win the game. What ends up happening is that players will rely on those heroes and climb the ladder without understanding the fundamentals of good team play, which then forces the team players to pick heroes that are independent because everybody else is off doing their own thing.

They have kept the medal system, which only serves to encourage toxicity among players, and requires a lot of context and interpretation to even be marginally useful. They won’t include a true scoreboard because, supposedly, it would encourage toxicity, but a scoreboard is standard in any FPS that is played competitively in any capacity. They made player profiles private by default. While they claim it was, again, due to toxicity (and I agree, a lot of the community were toxic with this), the main problem was the poor UI and information layout, combined with people legitimately playing characters they had no real experience with in comp. Again, this is a problem with just having poor information to work with, as the stats that Overwatch provides just aren’t useful at a glance to players. 

Where is healing over time? Where are deaths per minute? Where is a stat for tanks that displays the ratio of damage they’ve blocked with a shield compared to damage they’ve body blocked? Not Damage blocked by shield and damage taken, but a ratio directly comparing the two. I would have loved to see a damage taken per minute (or 5 minutes, or ten minutes) followed by a “2:1 damage taken to damage shielded” or “45% shielded” stat.

I don’t think this game is dead by any stretch of the imagination, but I think people are tired of the devs not taking a clear stance to implement systems that encourage a competitive environment and team play in competitive queue. This leads to less people caring and not using the report system because the problems they’ve encountered are problem they’ve been encountering."

OverwatchUniversity,ffmu7i0,t1_ffmjln5,1580058959.0,"I just mean that the advice is too vague to be taken as anything more. It doesn’t really tell anybody how to actually address the problem, how to control your tone, how to actually analyze a team problem so you can understand if you have a valid critique or not. The only thing this advice really says is “instead of being specific, be general”, which, while it might work some times, may also fail other times because of the reasons I’ve outlined.

Good advice, good shot calling, and addressing problems can be largely independent of how you actually deliver it. OP could have spent more time addressing how to maintain a positive attitude so that the commentary you provide is well received. He could have mentioned how to fix specific issues without offending the person you’re addressing. 

For example, let’s use his tank commentary, as that’s often the one I’ve had most trouble with. The tanks, for whatever reason, aren’t moving forward. Instead of telling the tanks, specifically “hey, tanks, we really need you to push forward, and we’ll follow you”, somebody says “we need to change something, we’re not getting through the choke”.

The tanks don’t think they’re doing anything wrong. They’re waiting to get support from their healers or DPS. The DPS don’t think they’re doing anything wrong, because they’re waiting on the tanks to move up so they have cover. The healers don’t think they’re doing anything wrong, they’re just sitting there healing and are waiting got everybody else to move up.

And I, as well as many other people, have been in games where somebody goes “I think we need to change something up” about 5 or 7 minutes in, after the team has tried the same thing every push, yet nobody changes anything. Why? Well, nobody knows what they should change to, or they assume it’s somebody else’s problem.

OP’s advice also doesn’t address the culture of the voice and text chat in comp or quick play at different levels. When I was a bronze scrub, I actually took a team of kids from a 0-2 deficit to win 3-2 in a reverse sweep. The only reason that was possible was by maintaining a positive attitude, and because the kids themselves wanted to win. Maybe I didn’t have the best commentary, and maybe my analysis was wrong, but none of that mattered because we were all on the same page. Everybody here knows the importance of the team being in the same page, and a lot of the advice given to players is to stop worrying about the meta because it only truly applies to the absolute best professional players.

Meanwhile, I’ve also been in a game where people are being polite, and 1 or 2 dudes are being such assholes it throws the entire team off. At that point, communication breaks down, and usually people either mute, or just shut up.

And that’s the problem I have sigh this:

> OP's advice is good because it gets you into the mindset of focusing on solutions, not telling other people they're the problem. If you're just overtly critical of a stranger playing a game on the internet, you're not being direct, you're being an asshole.


OP doesn’t actually tell anybody how to focus on solutions, it tells people to focus on generalizing what they say. It doesn’t help people deliver important information respectfully, it offers a blanket solution that people should apply in every situation.

Some people need to be told directly what they need to change because the situation may be overwhelming them. Other teams need a general statement to just get everybody on the same page. Some people work better with a specific task to accomplish (Rein, make sure reaper can get in close), and other teams already work well individually and just need a unifying set of goals for each role to play. 

OP’s advice, well-meaning as it is, doesn’t actually show people how to deliver call outs. I feel that it’s a generalized solution to avoid having to struggle with the different kinds of people you encounter in chat.

It’s kind of why sometimes people who try to cheat by writing out some card might end up not using it: the act of writing what was written enhances each other. The more experiences you can connect, the easier your learn. 

This helps a lot in music. Music is very abstract. Just the act of learning to differentiate pitch and hold a tone or rhythm is difficult for people who haven’t done it before. I never realized this until I began teaching some musical concepts to the people on my worship team(I’ve been involved in music since I was a kid).

However, because music is abstract, and so many things fall to unconscious habits, we often explain these things to each other using analogies. For example, in singing, it is important to have proper vocal tract alignment for good resonance. To hit higher notes, you need to maintain that alignment whine not over blowing. The way I think of singing higher notes is like trying to blow air over a taller and taller wall. I’m trying to blow that air strong enough that it makes it over, but not so much that I just send it several feet above. In order to do this while wasting as little energy as possible, I also need to stand straight and support my breathe. 

We’ll often do other exercises in choir too. Sometimes, we tap a beat. Other times, Dr. Tasher will warm us up with a troublesome phrase that she actually took from a piece of music. 

I think making connections is key. Connecting information to many experiences, connecting information to things you already know, connecting information to senses. 

It’s why things like repetition, mnemonic devices, note cards, etc, work, because you’re connecting information to as many experiences and as much other information as you can.

That’s not what is happening here. threatening to rape a woman in the second date, regardless of consent, os not just trolling. It’s not a prank. That’s not some harmless joke. 

Threatening to rape somebody using somebody else’s identity is an actual threat of bodily harm against some, and has the potential to outright ruin someone’s life and place them at immediate risk of retaliation. The fact that you minimizing that as “trolling” is actually damn appalling.

I wouldn’t get into a fight with someone over a stupid “prank”, like those unfunny videos of people mildly harassing somebody and then trying to call “it’s a prank, bro” when people get upset. 

I’d kick my mother and father out of the house if the painted me a rapist to somebody else. Being made to look like a rapist isn’t “trolling”.

> beating the shit out of someone.


Again, I know that, and again, you’re ignoring context entirely. This guy *just* spent time and energy arguing about how he would forcefully penetrate a woman in the second date. Why? Her vagina should be strong enough to repel an erect penis. Violence, and sex. His supposed “excuse” was that “his brother did it”, so he her the shit out of him (violence) and then redirects the conversation directly to letting her decide when to have sex (sex). In both the conversation he had the previous night, and even in his supposed excuse, violence and sex are the key topics of what he’s saying. 

Whereas most people don’t actually mean literally “beat the shit out of somebody” when they say something like that. Most people mean a fight ensued, and it one guy definitively won it, but it wasn’t some senseless, unjustified beat down to within an inch of the other person’s life, like I’m sure people were assuming. 

> Nor can you stop me from pointing out that not every situation requires a contextual analysis.


You’re right, I can’t, but context always matters, and people who understand that are the same kind of people who wouldn’t understand why a small problem might affect one person in a big way and a other person not at all.

Yeah, that’s the thing, these aren’t just a bunch of text messages. The guy didn’t send a dick pic. The guy didn’t act like a regular asshole. The guy didn’t disrespect a person’s family member, or make a crude joke.

The dude ***threatened rape***. That’s not “some text messages, that is, as far as OP is concerned, a direct threat to commit a violent crime against OP.

Saying that these are just “a bunch of text messages” is like saying that mailing letters with an unknown white substance to a government official is just “a bunch of letters” or making a death threat on a politicians page is just “sending a tweet/DM”.

If somebody messaged a politician and said “the next time you come to my town, I’m beating you senseless and taking something important to you. If you don’t want it to happen, you’ll be prepared” nobody would claim that’s “just trolling” or “just some online messages”, and that person would probably be investigated, and security would be increased. 

***That’s*** what happened here. This dude didn’t just call OP a bitch. He didn’t just act like a regular asshole, or say vulgar things. 

This dude let OP know what she could expect. If she continues seeing him, he’s going to assault her and rob her of something important.

Rape is not trolling. Rape isn’t a prank. Rape isn’t some funny little game, or just being a regular asshole. 

Rape is a serious fucking crime, and it destroys lives. “Joking” about rape minimizes the struggles of rape victims, and makes it less likely that a rape victim will be believed. And, even though false rape accusations don’t happen often, rape accusations still ruin reputations and lives, and often costs people relationships, friends, jobs, or potentially even their life."

One of the biggest issues in display tech is dealing with pixel density and how to manage the electronics. I mean, 2 mean, the smallest 4k displays I know of are still on something that’s several inches diagonal at least, and that’s to get a decent screen with solid brightness, etc.

I don’t know of many phones that have 4k displays, and those are still measured at several inches. These people are claiming a pixel density of 14k ppi. In other words, they’re claiming to be able to put more pixels than any professional cinema grade camera can record into an inch. Obviously. It’s not like you’ll ever use that many pixels in practice yet, but if they were able to achieve that resolution, display technology as a whole would be far more advanced than it currently is. 

I can see how they make some space savings by cutting out the backlight (the light entering the eye serves that purpose), but I don’t see how they’ve managed to magically overcome all of the wiring and connectivity issues that have been the main limitation of pixel density in displays.

https://www.ssbwiki.com/clone

As according to this, Dr. Mario is more than just kind of a clone, he’s a full clone of Mario, even in Ultimate. 2 do acknowledge that he plays differently than Mario, but ever clone has always played differently from their parent character in some way. Marth was top tier in melee, while roy was below mid tier, if I recall, all because of the differences in their moves, but they were still considered clones. I actually think the Dr. Mario/Mario argument was the most compelling one. 

Unfortunately, I also think it’s the only compelling argument for drawing similarities between the Mario franchise and the Fire Emblem franchise, because all other clones in the Mario Franchise, and the other franchises, have slowly grown more distinct in reach release.

The point being that *only* playing differently isn’t enough to disqualify a character from being a clone. All it takes is a handful of changes to make those do so.

The point is that there is a combination of reasons why FE gets a lot of the frustration. Honestly, a lot of the characters I considered feeling more distinct are still classified as clones themselves according to the link I’ve provided, which goes to show that it’s more than just feeling.

It’s a combination of being clones, having far too similar a move set/play style, the franchises the came from, how those characters were released, how they’ve progressed, etc that explain it."

longboarding,fffq3qi,t1_fffjpks,1579889355.0,"No, you’re good. I did get the new bushings, harder in the back so they matched the front. I got 2 sets of the 90a bushings and 2 sets of the 80a bushings, so I could experiment between all of the bushing combinations. I ended up going with the 90a bushings and flat washers in the back truck, and the stock carver barrels in the front truck with a flat washer. now, the front finally feels about the same resistance as the back, and board has great rebound and return to center. The only thing I’m going to do now is get actual flat washers, because I’m just using the carver cupped washers but turned around, lol.

And I went with the 15 degrees in the back. I feel like the front truck for Carver’s is too turny to be able to keep up a solid pumping rhythm with a turny back, so I went with 15 degrees in the. Back to cut down on turn. Might go back to 10 degrees, but right now I just need to get some more time in my board and get used to pumping, but it’s been cold, and I work full time, so I haven’t had a lot of deck time yet. I have found that I can get a wiggly pump going, but I’m just not used to pumping enough to definitively say whether it’s just me or the board. Like I said, need more deck time. 

My main reason for going with a Mermaid with Carver trucks was the old gear/setups page from Pavedwave. James Peters noted that, because of the design of Carver CX trucks, the kingpin experienced less stress and broke down far less often than other front trucks used for pumping. Because i can’t guarantee I’ll use my board consistently, I won’t be able to keep track of miles effectively, which prevents me from snapping a kingpin unknowingly, or wasting money replacing kingpins. Peters also noted that, again because of the design, Carver trucks are easier to pump than other trucks/brands, but harder to maintain a top speed. 

Once I get more time on my board, I’ll know. I may end up backing down to anywhere between 10 and 15 degrees dewedge, but, as it stands, I am just happy to have my hands on this setup in the first place, lol. I can say that the board still pumps, and it carves exceptionally well. Combining that with the zealous bearings I got for the setup, and some Blood Orange wheels, the setup is just exceptionally smooth to ride."

> I personally believe that Lucina is the reason for most of the hate. As I don't remember any hate for roy returning, and I remember people being upset that she was an exact clone.


Clone as he was, people actually just liked Roy, and a lot of players were kind of upset he wasn’t included in brawl to begin with. Ike was well received because he was genuinely a different fighter than marth. All said and done, people liked Ike because he was a fresh fighter, and missed roy. 

The reason people disliked Lucina is because we not only got Roy back, the original Marth clone, we got Lucina, which basically could have been called Princess Marth. I don’t think people would have been upset if she had a different move set altogether, but the would have been difficult considering that (as far as I understand) she tries to pass herself off as Marth in her games. So, not only did we get a beloved clone back, we got someone who actually deliberately was trying to be like Marth. On top of that, all 3 were sword fighters. 

So we went from 2 characters who are clones, but beloved, to 2 characters who were loved but different, to 4 characters, 3 of which are clones, and all of which were sword fighters. 

Then, we get Corrin, which was arguably a broken character when they came out. While they played differently, they were still a pseudo-sword character with an overpowered kit. Everybody plays Corrin because she’s definitely awesome in comparison to the other fire emblem characters, who have all received adjustments that have taken them out of the upper tiers.

This is the point where adding extra fire emblem characters doesn’t matter anymore, in my opinion. The combination of adding a character that canonically wants to pass as Marth, and a pseudo-sword fighter who was a clear cut above the other characters we had, was too much. Additionally, people took issue with exactly how popular these characters were in the first place. From what I understand, it’s not like people doesn’t like Lucina or Corrin, but they did feel that there were other characters who were far more popular and deserving to be in Smash than them.

Then, they go and add Crom. Love him or hate him, he’s a direct clone of Roy, who used to be a clone of Marth, and you still have Lucina, who is a clone of marth that you can’t really do anything with because that’s literally her character. 4 clones, 5 swords, 1 pseudo-sword, 3 context-dependent characters.

So, to go back to a previous point you made, about Daisy, Luigi, and Dr. Mario:

The Mario and Pokémon franchises, by contrast, have far more variety, and people pretty much universally love each of the characters. The development team has actively worked towards differentiating what were once clones. Pichu and Pikachu, though having technically identical move sets, play very differently. Luigi is different enough to call a separate character, at this point. I believe Dr. Mario hasn’t received many changes because there don’t seem to be any particularly strong feelings towards him, and he is to Mario what Lucina is to Marth. However, a key difference is that players won’t feel that Dr. Mario being included kept some other Mario character from making it into the game. 

Daisy, is in much the same boat as Dr. Mario, I feel. People just love Daisy because now we have the Mario Peach ship and the Luigi Daisy ship in the game.

I understand that the possibilities within Pokémon and Mario mean you can just take and make many different characters, but it also feels like Nintendo put in the work to make the characters feel different and have their personalities.

And we can look at other clones. 

* Ganon and Falcon: differentiated

* Fox and Falco differentiated

* Link and Young Link differentiated

* Jigglypuff and Kirby actually used to be full clones, but they’ve grown distinct. 

You can even see a list of clones here, the definitions of different kinds of clones, and any changes they may or may not have received throughout the series. 

https://www.ssbwiki.com/clone

It’s genuinely a combination of attributes and circumstances that has led so many people to be upset that the last fighter released in this fighter pass was another Fire Emblem character. Fire Emblem is a solid series that deserves to be represented because the world isn’t just Mario and Pokémon. Apparently, Fire Emblem is damn popular in Japan in its own right. 

The problem is that franchises like Mario and Pokémon have shown clear trends towards developing characters and innovating. I mean, meme-y as it might be, who the hell thought ~~Petey~~ Piranha Plant would have made it into the game? Yet, it works, and he’s his own character, and people love it. 

Yet, for Fire Emblem, the developers haven’t really differentiated the characters we do have, and they keep adding characters that don’t really shake anything up. There are *tons* of possibilities and ideas to draw from within the Fire Emblem franchise that try devs could use to include features and gimmicks hasn’t haven’t been done by other characters, or that do it in a new way, or that simply just as variety to the Fire Emblem cast, but they just choose not to do it.

People don’t want gender-ambiguous, contextually dependent characters who play it safe. People want characters with good development and solid identity. They want characters that represent the diversity within the franchises they come from and characters that have the potential to include representation of just different real life people, the way the Overwatch devs did with their cast."

The difference in the properties of their move sets makes them play far more differently than roy and marth, or even marth and lucina.

I think Dr. Mario is a fair point to bring up, and I genuinely forgot daisy was a separate character. Is she a separate character? I thought she was an alt skin for peach?

While I think it’s fair to to acknowledge the similarities within the characters represented within the Mario franchise, I don’t think it’s fair to simply dismiss the similarity within the fire emblem representation. Saying “are we going to ignore Mario and Luigi and how they’re like Roy and Marth” ignores the fact that Roy and Marth also have clones in Crom and Lucina, meaning 4 characters across the roster share the same Roy/Marth DNA. Not only do 4 fire emblem characters share the same original vision, 5 of try characters are sword fighters. 

I don’t even think the issue is popularity. I believe Fire Emblem deserves to be represented in smash brothers, considering it’s actually quite popular in Japan. My brother has Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn, and it’s a great game. I love the lore, the gameplay is fun, the story is engaging. 

I think the issue is primarily variety in representation. We have mages, warriors, and priests. We have cavalry, archers, and swordsmen. We have Beorc and Laguz, and even within the Laguz we have Beast, Bird, and Dragon. We have rogues and bandits, bards and knights, kings and queens and peasants and paupers. 

Yet we have 5 swordsmen, a dragon, mage, and one pick-your-weapon style character. 4 of those characters are men, and 1 is a woman, the other 3 are context dependent genders. While I understand the temptation to put in the popular, representative characters, we could have gotten far more variety out of Fire Emblem than we’re currently getting.

We could have had our first paladín character. We could have had another Goddess to contend with Palutena. We could have added Sothe, or another rogue, to spar with Joker and Sheik. We could have had a laguz that can fully transform between their human as beast form in a similar way to how sheik and zelda used to be.

People are upset, and they’re looking at the situation from a very narrow standpoint, not realizing exactly why they feel upset. Everybody yells about something, but they end up only ever being partially correct. Some people cry “popularity” not realizing that FE is plenty popular in japan too. Some cry “other franchises have similar characters” not realizing there exist plenty of significant differences between those characters too.

There are a lot of simplified astrophysics that I know about and could explain, but there I know that I have absolutely no idea about all of the specific details of that stuff. I could tell you about Hawking radiation, but I couldn’t tell you any equations about it. Known unknowns are the things at the edge of hour knowledge, just beyond your reach. It’s the thing you know is the missing piece of a puzzle you’re trying to solve. 

Unknown knowns are weird. these are things you know how to do, but you don’t really know how or why they work. This is stuff that could be considered common sense, or folk knowledge. It’s stuff that is practical and work 75% of the time, so you don’t question it. It’s stuff you haven’t thought about in ages. 

For example, think of something you know that your friend doesn’t know about. They ask you how you do it, but you pause, and you can’t really explain it. That is am unknown known. For whatever reason, this thing is something you’ve done for years, and you know it’s possible, but you can’t explain it well because even thigh you can do it, you don’t actually know how. 

Unknown unknowns are just that. It’s everything outside of your experience. Stuff that is so dad removed from everything you’ve done, you couldn’t even begin to conceive of it. Think of trying to explain space travel and rockets to somebody from the middle ages. Try to explain computers, which are basically electrified rocks, to somebody from early human history. Think of the first time you saw something hand left you speechless and in total awe. That thing was probably an unknown unknown. It may have been something unimaginable beautiful. It may have been understanding a concept you had no idea even governed one of your favorite hobbies. 

And no, to finally answer your question, I think the phrase “you don’t know what you don’t know” is both an incredibly useful phrase, and an incredibly useless phrase, depending on who receives it. 

If you’re a person who regularly dwells on your known unknowns, you spend time learning and realizing there is so much that is beyond your grasp, then the phrase “you don’t know what you don’t know” is incredibly useful for keeping yourself humble. It’s easy to take known unknowns and make them known knowns, and them become too proud of what you did. “You don’t know what you don’t know” is a good way to remind yourself that there is still a world outside of your influence yet that you can still experience. 

If you’re a person that has never once thought about your known unknowns, then that phrase is meaningless. You always stick inside of your bubble, and you never bother to think about your unknown knowns, so “you don’t know what you don’t know” is basically tautological to you, and a person who thinks this way would her the phrase and think “duh”.

Basically, to a person who recognizes there are things he has yet to learn, the phrase “you don’t know what you don’t know” is a humble reminder that “you have know idea just how many things exist that you haven’t even conceived of yet. 

To a person who doesn’t ever think about these things, “you don’t know what you don’t know” just sounds like somebody repeating the same sentence twice."

LifeProTips,ffdy5ho,t1_ffdxefu,1579831840.0,"fair enough. I think the biggest improvement to the interaction was not being side tracked from the discussion and drawn into other talking points, which is something I tend to do a lot. 

One of the valuable lessons one of my college professors taught me, that I’ve made a point of applying better, is to know what you don’t know. In a world where everybody wants to know, where the truth has been eroded so far, people want to feel like they *know* something. That can be an opponent, it can be a friend, it can be someone you disagree with or agree with. 

Being able to identify what it is that you know, what it is that you don’t know, what it is you have a strong opinion on, and what you don’t have a strong opinion on, means you can be respected more as an individual who isn’t afraid to learn and change opinions. It also keeps you from being drawn into situations that you find yourself out of your area of knowledge, which prevents you from being humiliated.

Basically, by knowing what you don’t know, and being willing to admit you don’t have an opinion on something:

1) you signal to the other person that you’re human. A lot of people will see this and respect it. If a person doesn’t respect this, you know to disengage. 

2) it keeps you from being drawn into topics you don’t know much about. This keeps you from potentially being embarrassed or humiliated. 

3) it is generally a more civil form of discourse. By being willing to admit you don’t have an opinion because you don’t have enough information, you being the conversation into a space of collaboration where both people can learn."
badwomensanatomy,ffdrafi,t1_ffdlwm5,1579827003.0,"Yeah, I never said torture anybody, mate.

EDIT: And to answer your question specifically, no i don’t think it’s right to torture convicted rapists, or anybody.

But I’m kicking whoever’s ass out of my house, of they think they can just make me out to be a rapist to someone else. They are leaving peacefully, or they are leaving forcefully, but they are leaving. 

The whole “violence doesn’t change anybody’s mind” is a poor line of reasoning. You cannot guarantee who responds to being decked and who doesn’t. I used to have a bully, until I stood up to him and it stopped. 1 punch is all it took to solve that problem. Other people I’ve been able to convince with words.

badwomensanatomy,ffdjsni,t1_ffdiqv5,1579822375.0,"By saying I’d throw hands at someone who made me out to be a rapist to someone else, a singular, rather justifiable situation? And you know absolutely nobody who would get into a fight over being made to look like a rapist?

You have an interesting definition of “pattern of violence”."
badwomensanatomy,ffdho34,t1_ffdg54g,1579821077.0,"You obviously missed the “pattern of violent behavior” bit.

When most people say “beat the shit out of”, they don’t usually actually mean completely pound the fuck out of someone to within an inch of their life. It’s a turn of phrase. It does mean you’re going to fight someone, but rarely does anybody actually mean it as severely as  the phrase sounds. 

This guy basically makes light of raping women, even gets into a verbal argument with OP about it. Then, while covering his ass, his shady lie continues the violence and uncontrolled sexual urges of the previous night.

Also, I’m pretty sure many people would slap a “friend” that used their phone to essentially send rape threats to someone else. I know if somebody I thought was a friend did that to me, they’d either have a hand print on their face, or they’d be out of my house, no two ways about it. Either they leave my house peacefully, or I’m getting them out of my house, and I’m calling the cops on their sorry ass either way."
badwomensanatomy,ffdfe9e,t1_ffdb0il,1579819727.0,"Bro, that’s not something that just requires a stern talking to, that requires a hand to be thrown. Making someone sound like a rapist? That’s a slap across the bow. 

The only reason we actually care about what the guy said is because he is displaying a clear pattern of violence, what with first saying he’ll force a woman to have sex. 

People have gotten into fights for less, and if I had a family member or friend that played that game on me, I’d slap them into next Tuesday, and them book them into counseling once I caught up to them."

AskReddit,ffc8irl,t1_ffb44tp,1579793974.0,"Thing is, it didn’t have to be that way. Gamestop could have continued to be a cool place to get games and game related merchandise. Cool t-shirts, branded toys, figurines and memorabilia. I mean, there are plenty of mom and pop board game stores in plenty of places because people do like that sense of community.

It’s just that the company plain sucks. Trade in a stack of games and you get 5 bucks so you buy a pack of gum. I actually love going to game stop, I just don’t have as much time, but I like seeing all of the cool merchandise that gaming companies put out. Diversifying is, in my opinion, exactly what Game Stop needs/needed to do to stay relevant, because people can just order their favorite games online, or buy stuff off of Steam.

But you just can’t be a sucky store. Nothing against the most employees, but the experience was very corporate and bland. I’m cool with buying games, but I don’t want to be ripped of selling my games back only to see those same games being sold as used for $20 or $30 dollars. No joke, I went in to sell some games back, and I was able to get maybe 10 dollars in store credit back total, if that (it was a lot of games). Just one of the games I was trying to sell back, a sonic racing game, was on the shelf itself for something like $15 or $20.

I took that stack and left. I would have gotten more satisfaction giving them away at a garage sale, which is actually exactly what we ended up doing in the end."
Showerthoughts,ffc4qwx,t1_ffc0wx2,1579791492.0,"I’m 27  I still participate as a community member in my university’s choir because I appreciate the conductor, who has had an incredible impact on my life, as because I love music. Being a more senior member, in terms of participating time, and being almost a decade older than some people there, it would be easy as hell to accidentally come across as creepy. 

But, finally participating in choir was one of the rinds that actually helped me develop socially, and we really treat each other as a big family. There is one girl here who usually does something run her hair or makeup. It’s not any more than any other girl, but she’s just close to my section. When I notice, I just give a compliment. “I love your hair” or “I love your makeup”, and I just mean it genuinely. 

The way her face lights up is the best thing in the world. That’s why I do things like that. If somebody has a nice outfit, and I can fit in the complement without breaking the flow of the conversation, I’ll do it. If somebody feels really proud of something, I’ll let them know it was noticed and appreciated. When I see people achieve something, I like to encourage them. 

I’m generally a goofy, awkward guy, but this last year, and as a goal for this year, I’m working on being the kind of person that influenced me when I was growing up to the people I interact with. Assuming college as 18-22, I’m at least 5 years older than the rest of the people there most of the time. Like, I’m not even saying I’m that much older or more qualified or have anything more to offer, but I live for moments when somebody’s eyes light up because they feel appreciated.

To be honest, as dumbfounded as your friend read that you didn’t compliment someone to try to get sex, I’m equally as dumbfounded that people view being nice to others in such a transactional way.

I don’t need anything from the people on my choir. Some of the people who participate are close enough to my age because they’re working on a post grad, or are community members themselves, but I’m not looking to find the person who is old enough who is going to give me sex. 

I give to my choir and in my choir because it’s my way of giving back the things that have made my life better. That’s why we’re all in choir, because music gave each of us something, and our joy in performance is the feelings we elicit in others with out song. 

And that’s how I view treating others. The joy of the performance of my life is the appreciating I get to elicit in others."
Showerthoughts,ffc3ixc,t1_ffc0gxw,1579790646.0,"Why not? I mean, I understand why most people wouldn’t, but imagine being the face of public safety, but the only time you get noticed is when something goes wrong. Your job isn’t to be noticed at all, it’s to make sure people have access to an event and are safe, while inconveniencing people as little as possible. People are often short sign you because, to them, you’re not really providing any necessary, tangible service. They’ve just got their purse, dammit. And you’re checking if their tube of lipstick is a dangerous chemical, so they sigh when you have to pull them to the side over a policy you don’t control. You’re like a cashier at a store, or customer service, except the customer never actually gets anything, and there is no speaking to the manager unless shit well and truly hits the fan. 

Some people are aware of this and just say thank you. Some people just thank others out of a politeness reflex. Other people just walk on by without saying a word. None of these people are wrong. 

And the security guard doesn’t actually care either. They just want to do a job. But, in a world where nobody cares you exist (at best), or they hate you just for being there (at worst), hearing you’re appreciated in the middle of a shift can mean the difference between another meaningless day in the job, and a decent story to share with a friend or family when you get off your shift."

Not having an opinion on something, whether it be because you just don’t know, or because the thing is unrelated to what you do know, is something worth respecting. It means the person is capable of separating how they feel from what they understand. If somebody tells me “I don’t know” and they mean it in good faith, I value that, and when I say it to others, I hope they value it as well."
