It was an accident

Okay. Just dont do it again please"
Conservative,fffo1xk,t1_fff57g2,1579888095.0,"Exactly. Say I am in financial trouble and rob a bank. Then I go to a friends house to lie low.

If the cops confronted my friend, he cant just claim Im seeking refuge from poverty and needed to break the law to justify harboring me. What does that mean for the banks and their clients? I would be a criminal and so would my friend as an accomplice. If they are genuine refugees they shouldnt need to sneak around the proper channels"
askaconservative,fff9bc5,t1_fff3d12,1579878900.0,"Its also important to note that in a lot of cases, individual racism, affirmative action or stereotyping are not to be confused with privilege.

If an African American is hired over a Caucasian, it wouldnt be considered black privilege. If an Asian American denies a Caucasian a loan it isnt Asian privilege. And if a Hispanic landlord feels more comfortable renting to a Hispanic tenant rather than a Caucasian, thats not Hispanic privilege. 

When someone of a certain race holds a racial preference when providing any product or service to an individual, (or when legitimate preferences based in financial, criminal, or psychological background is written off as racial) its their product or service to do with what they choose.

Black genetics happen to make African Americans taller statistically. So by this logic, the NBA is an organization of black privilege that discriminates against other races.  Conservatives comments and subs are often censored in social media. Does that imply liberal privilege?

Im often shot down from certain opportunities because Im white and its assumed Im privileged. This makes me the victim of systemic racism. The whole idea of white privilege is a way to turn the races against each other and if the media wanted to, they could make any race look more privileged than others"

If only the democrats want him out then theyll try doing it through impeachment like theyve said theyd do since the day he stepped into the White House. Schiff, Pelosi and Nadler dont speak for the people they speak for themselves and protecting their interests. Please explain to me how a president exposing corruption is considered corruption. Because Im sick and tired of people like you who think this is what everyone wants. Only the people who wanted trump out from the beginning want this. Hes done wonders for the country and you democrats go to great lengths to avoid admitting it. Up to and including sympathizing with actual terrorists. 

Your testimonies are presumptions, your crimes or using presidential privileges that Obama used all the time, and your team is made up of people who benefit from a corrupt Ukraine. Meanwhile joe Biden is on video bragging about textbook bribery and the media calls it debunked with no actual effort to explain why. If that doesnt smell fishy to you then youre a lost cause and I dont expect to change your mind about anything. But I will suggest you look into the motives of your sources and ask yourself the questions you dont feel comfortable asking. Like why did trumps original call to congratulate Zelensky take place before Biden was running if trump was doing this for political reasons, why did joe announce his candidacy 4/25 while hunter resigned from Burisma on 4/25, and why doesnt your side of the isle acknowledge the  National Defense Authorization Actvoted into law by both parties in 2019 that REQUIRES Trump have foreign governments root out corruption before providing aid of any form?

Patient access reps, construction, pharmaceuticals, banking, automotive, etc it applies across the board. 

If the less qualified are chosen over the well qualified simply because of their race, that to me is a form of well intentioned racism. And it shatters the American Dream.

If people were sneaking in from Canada the media would say conservatives hate the french. Your facts and statistics are a gigantic waste of time. The only stats you should consider are the facts that show how much damage illegal immigration does to any country including America. If you think its a racial thing youre dead wrong

Edit: to answer your deleted comment about everyone here being racists:


I dont see any answers that are remotely racist here. Mostly concerns about their reasoning for being here, political views and tax evasion. Nobody was talking about racism towards Mexicans until trump announced the wall. Then the narrative spun so out of control that we have people like you advocating for illegal immigration. Its a slap in the face to anyone who put in the work to be a legal citizen and its a threat to our country.

progun,ff4uy33,t1_ff4s7vv,1579573052.0,"1. Guns will always change. Doesnt mean we should just be allowed muskets. The 2nd amendment is in place to fight off an oppressive government. It allowed for us to own military equipment. Cannons were part of that when the constitution was written, and those were modern day tanks. If guns become more advanced, the people should have access regardless in order to stay as formidable any would be oppressors.

2. The whole you cant withstand Americas military argument is bs. Its practically like saying David was too small to heat Goliath so why even try? Take his stone and sling and throw them out regardless of whether or not he wants them. Goliath will have his way with him one way or another. And aside from the obvious flaw with that, consider this: Hitler could have bombed his population. He could have launched missiles and artillery into cities and sent the tanks on after. But instead he confiscated firearms. At that point you could waltz right in and load people onto the trains. No drone, satellite or tank has the ability to herd people onto trains. Those were made for death and destruction. If the governments goal were to kill us theyd just nuke us and call it a day. But dont tell me youre willing to give up your rights just because you think youll lose. If the founding fathers thought that way wed still be a colony.

3. There are statistics from both sides. Dont just look at the decreased number of gun suicides etc... Look at crime rates and murder. Just because guns are illegal doesnt mean criminals decided to live an honest life. The recent church shooter got his guns illegally. If the state made it illegal for Jack Wilson to own a gun, he and everyone there would be in the ground right now because laws didnt stop the shooter. Imagine that. Not to mention the fact that not every other government is for the people like our constitution makes America. There are a lot of laws that limit power to the government and 2A ensures they dont make rash decisions and change those laws. Thats why 2A has to go first if you want to oppress a nation.

4. Im no law expert so I cant answer that, but to the best of my knowledge, even a vote on that matter would be considered an infringement on the second amendment and would never be constitutional. And trust meAmerica will never see the day that more people want to give up their rights than keep them. The large majority of Americans will stand by the constitution. The very VERY few who think otherwise seem to be many because its what the media focuses on. Same reason why the church shooting didnt get as much coverage as it would have if everyone died and it made it easier to push the guns are bad narrative.

You are our first line of defense, Virginia. As an Ohioan, I think I can speak for the rest of Americas true patriots when I say thank you. You havent let us down today. You didnt give the MSM anything to fuel their fires (although they will find something regardless, as they always do).

What happened today showed everyone that gun owners are rational, safe and reasonable despite what the media tries painting us as. It resonated throughout the country and it will be remembered during this years elections. God bless Virginia and God bless America."

If only the democrats want him out then they’ll try doing it through impeachment like they’ve said they’d do since the day he stepped into the White House. Schiff, Pelosi and Nadler don’t speak for the people they speak for themselves and protecting their interests. Please explain to me how a president exposing corruption is considered corruption. Because I’m sick and tired of people like you who think this is what everyone wants. Only the people who wanted trump out from the beginning want this. He’s done wonders for the country and you democrats go to great lengths to avoid admitting it. Up to and including sympathizing with actual terrorists. 

Your testimonies are presumptions, your “crimes” or using presidential privileges that Obama used all the time, and your team is made up of people who benefit from a corrupt Ukraine. Meanwhile joe Biden is on video bragging about textbook bribery and the media calls it debunked with no actual effort to explain why. If that doesn’t smell fishy to you then you’re a lost cause and I don’t expect to change your mind about anything. But I will suggest you look into the motives of your sources and ask yourself the questions you don’t feel comfortable asking. Like why did trumps original call to congratulate Zelensky take place before Biden was running if trump was doing this for political reasons, why did joe announce his candidacy 4/25 while hunter resigned from Burisma on 4/25, and why doesn’t your side of the isle acknowledge the  National Defense Authorization Act—voted into law by both parties in 2019 that REQUIRES Trump have foreign governments root out corruption before providing aid of any form?

Are you willing to take that risk as a governor? Civilians can be very dangerous especially when armed. Don’t underestimate the power of a well armed population. The British military wasn’t defeated for hundreds of years until a bunch of farmers decided to fight back. And I’m sure as hell not going to give up what they’ve fought for so easily. And I’m certainly not going to just throw it away. Especially when that very thing protects me and mine from anyone who would want to hurt or take from us. This fight is non negotiable for gun owners and the sooner you understand that, the sooner you’ll begin to realize this isn’t just about “freedom” in the sense that you can own a weapon, but rather in the sense that it represents *your* power over the government and *your* rights as a citizen of this nation."

progun,ff4uy33,t1_ff4s7vv,1579573052.0,"1. Guns will always change. Doesn’t mean we should just be allowed muskets. The 2nd amendment is in place to fight off an oppressive government. It allowed for us to own military equipment. Cannons were part of that when the constitution was written, and those were modern day tanks. If guns become more advanced, the people should have access regardless in order to stay as formidable any would be oppressors.

2. The whole “you can’t withstand America’s military” argument is bs. It’s practically like saying David was too small to heat Goliath so why even try? Take his stone and sling and throw them out regardless of whether or not he wants them. Goliath will have his way with him one way or another. And aside from the obvious flaw with that, consider this: Hitler could have bombed his population. He could have launched missiles and artillery into cities and sent the tanks on after. But instead he confiscated firearms. At that point you could waltz right in and load people onto the trains. No drone, satellite or tank has the ability to herd people onto trains. Those were made for death and destruction. If the government’s goal were to kill us they’d just nuke us and call it a day. But don’t tell me you’re willing to give up your rights just because you think you’ll lose. If the founding fathers thought that way we’d still be a colony.

3. There are statistics from both sides. Don’t just look at the decreased number of gun suicides etc... Look at crime rates and murder. Just because guns are illegal doesn’t mean criminals decided to live an honest life. The recent church shooter got his guns illegally. If the state made it illegal for Jack Wilson to own a gun, he and everyone there would be in the ground right now because laws didn’t stop the shooter. Imagine that. Not to mention the fact that not every other government is for the people like our constitution makes America. There are a lot of laws that limit power to the government and 2A ensures they don’t make rash decisions and change those laws. That’s why 2A has to go first if you want to oppress a nation.

4. I’m no law expert so I can’t answer that, but to the best of my knowledge, even a vote on that matter would be considered an infringement on the second amendment and would never be constitutional. And trust me—America will never see the day that more people want to give up their rights than keep them. The large majority of Americans will stand by the constitution. The very VERY few who think otherwise seem to be many because it’s what the media focuses on. Same reason why the church shooting didn’t get as much coverage as it would have if everyone died and it made it easier to push the “guns are bad” narrative. If you’re an American and you know your history well, you understand why this is **NON NEGOTIABLE**"
progun,ff4t84r,t1_ff4ruey,1579571881.0,"What’s with you and hellfire missiles? Better to fight them with guns than arrows. And ultimately guns fight off oppression. If the government wanted to simply murder everyone they’d just nuke your state and call it a day. But if they want to round you up and put you on a train, they’ll need soldiers for that. Unless there’s some high tech hellfire missile capable of herding people that I’m not aware of"

You are our first line of defense, Virginia. As an Ohioan, I think I can speak for the rest of America’s true patriots when I say thank you. You haven’t let us down today.

askaconservative,ff3db11,t3_erevkz,1579538827.0,Agreed. Our population can only grow so large if we are using time and resources to care for an ever growing elderly population. When you grow old you become less of an asset and more of a liability. So our population will eventually consist of so many who need care that the ones who can provide it won’t be able to provide for themselves without neglecting the elderly. They will likely be the first to go even if the problem WAS overpopulation instead of an aging population

askaconservative,ff3bkcm,t3_erf4xd,1579537951.0,No. Democrats have a hold on the state and are bringing in illegal immigrants and offering them free healthcare and education as well as the right to vote in order to keep that power. Most republicans in the state have left because of the insane policies. Hollywood plays a huge part in it as well. Being a republican in show biz can potentially end your career before it starts. This attracts even more political bias and trickles down to fans and residents. I could see Cali seceding before flipping red
