I think you're right to point out that it's not malicious intent or anything, and I'm sure some people are asking for detailed explanations that are unrealistic. But I think most of us would be happy with a feature so simple I'd do it pro-bono, if corporate would approve.

That said, I 100% agree Sony was just looking at this as a business move. Especially when they directly say they hope he sticks with them for his final film. 

Can't speak on Tarantino's stance in particular. Maybe the recent other controversies made him rethink his position. Or maybe he was just looking at his bottom line. Could go either way if you ask me. (Edit: He's so artsy he's only making 10 movies. I could see him choosing principles over money)

And regardless of the motive, any time someone stands up to China, I'm happy."
