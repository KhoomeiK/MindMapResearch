""North Korea remains one of the world’s most repressive states. In his seventh year in power, Kim Jong-un—who serves as chairman of the States Affairs Commission and head of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea—continues to exercise almost total political control. The government restricts all civil and political liberties, including freedom of expression, assembly, association, and religion. It also prohibits all organized political opposition, independent media, civil society, and trade unions."""

Addicts shouldn't even face legal consequences in my opinion. Dealers obviously should and crimes people commit on or for drugs should, but addiction itself shouldn't be a factor.

We need to treat addiction like a disease rather than crime. 

We should be funding state hospitals for addicts, the mentally ill, and people who can't take care of themselves. The government should have the authority to hold them until they recover, with or without consent, if recovery is possible."

videos,fej8fpr,t1_feixl0e,1579161370.0,"I'm not trans, but in my perspective these ideas don't really clash.

Children are taught/shown from day one that being a boy or a girl comes with certain expectations and attitudes. Even if it isn't expressly stated everyone picks up on it at a young age.

Little girls are dressed in dresses and pink, given dolls and barbies, and generally have long hair.

Little boys generally have short hair, pants, and different toys.

Transgender children get these ideas reinforced just as much as cisgender children. 

When a child is feeling body dysmorphia I wonder if they're always at a level of understanding to pinpoint what is wrong specifically. Especially if they're still ignorant of biology.

Wouldn't that child, if they feel like they're supposed to be a girl or boy, only really understand how to frame that in terms of what they understand?

Hair, clothes, and toys mainly. 

So I'd imagine trans  children who adopt those stereotypes have a good chance of carrying them into adulthood.
