AskReddit,ff1rtsy,t3_er424v,1579484770.0,"Pro: Beautiful nature, great for fishing, hunting, outdoorsy type stuff, nice people, low cost of living.

Cons: not a lot of careers, most jobs are part-time, not a lot of venues for music or comedy, most big bands skip us, drug problems and all that brings, up to 7 months of snow some year, newest major city is an 8 hour drive away."

AskReddit,fefgu9c,t3_eotg7l,1579056035.0,"One of my favorite bands is Canadian prog metal band Protest the Hero. Travelled to see them and a few hours before the show we were drinking in a small bar near the venue. We ended up running into the singer Rody and bass player Arif. They were super cool, drank a bunch of beers with us and answered all our stupid fanboy questions. When they performed their encore, they gave a shout out to my home town. All around stand up gentlemen."
anime,feer6ma,t1_feelj8j,1579039466.0,"So its unrelated to the anime? Like how the Attack on Titan movie has nothing to do with the anime?Like presumably if the Goblin Slayer anime does 5 seasons, they will cover the same story? Sorry I find this confusing, I've googled it and couldnt really find any concrete answers."

horror,fdct3wn,t3_eknhh0,1578283554.0,"I enjoyed it, but characters did seem somewhat flandersized from Rejects (still less so than Corpses). I enjoy the characters with the addition of Richard Brake (RIP Haig). I imagine there could be other cousins etc of the Firefly family that we have yet to meet. My main beef is that you don't really get the sense of how evil they are in this movie. Sure they hold a family hostage, but it's to get Baby out of prison. I'm not saying they are saints, but this movie is missing the sadism and lust for violence that was present in Rejects and Corpses. The movie sort of falls apart when they go to Mexico, and instead of the serial killer horror film we had been promised, it turns into a Robert Rodriguez action B movie complete with Lucha masked assassins. 

That being said, I'm not picky. I'd watch 20 more movies with these characters despite the flaws. I'd appreciate a return to form though if he's gonna keep making Firefly moves. Something like Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer starring Otis and Baby. Maybe they make their way back to the U.S. in the 90s and fly under the radar in a large urban centre where they terrorize the population."

She's already lost 2 toes because of the illness. I've begged and pleaded with her to try and eat healthier. Shit, it's not even about being heavy, it's all about her continually eating sugar and processed carbs every day. It's at the point where there is no hope. She fights me if I bring it up, and it's too emotionally tolling to battle her. Ultimately it's her decision, but dammit it feels bad to watch someone you love eat themselves into an early grave."

Screenwriting,fcatbh8,t3_egxp4x,1577576199.0,"I'd say maybe American History X. Edward Norton's character Derek grew up in a predominately white neighborhood in LA that over time became lower income and part of the hood. His dad who is a fire fighter is murdered by a black gangster, and Derek turns to a life of racial violence. 

The movie does a good job of making you feel sympathetic to Derek, (if what happened to his character happened to you, could you 100% say you wouldn't do the same?) but it also shows that his ideology is responsible for destroying his family, ruining his relationship with his mother, getting him incarcerated, and causes his younger brother to go down the same path. Without spoiling it he essentially becomes what he hates, a violent criminal, and it shows the hypocrisy of his actions. 

I think this movie would be up your alley because A) the racist characters have realistic reasons for being who they are, not just cartoon characters. B) It shows the realities of black gang life, there are black characters in the movie that are despicable, but there are also black characters that are great people."

fatlogic,fc0u18s,t1_fc05z0r,1577299681.0,"I know two brothers, both eat like tanks, lots of fast food, big portions, multiple beers every night, difficult for them to gain weight. One is an alcoholic and has a tiny beer gut, the other works on his feet all day and his tone AF. Neither of them do exercise aside from daily labour. (the alcoholic brother is also a weed dealer so his job involves him being on the couch). I understand that CICO dictates this, but metabolism has to come in to play in this, even with going to the gym, if I ate and drink like them for a month, I'd be a fatass."
