It was honestly cute, but I did have my hand on my 45.

edit: wanted to add, my normal bag is only 33 lbs, a bushcraft and UL hybrid, and lacks the saw and some other things but is still completely capable of building shelter and everything else. UL considers that heavy but they can't survive anywhere, most of them don't even have water filters lol."

Survival,fdrbg8e,t1_fdra45h,1578682060.0,"Splitting firewood is more important than most tasks, and that axe can still chop and fell, so it just makes maintaining the fire easier and that's mostly what you're doing with it. They're not as easy to use for smaller tasks, harder to choke up on and use like a knife. Heavier though, so it can handle larger tasks that are less fit for hatchets, also a nice feature in survival. Really depends on your needs."

Honestly, this sub is just super novice and acts like it's expert. This means people don't thirst for knowledge enough, and need to simply rent some books from the library and start there.
