nba,fgw5muu,t1_fgvyzty,1581157146.0,high usage and focal point of the offense is pretty much synonymous with being a star though
nba,fgvt0q6,t1_fgvgf87,1581152727.0,\*slang. ebonics has a negative connotation when you use it in that context
todayilearned,fgvevq6,t1_fgv2qk7,1581147351.0,prolly has something to do with the supply chain of the specific cartel that sells in Chicago. probably more expensive/inconvenient for them to manufacture and transport meth than it is to do the same with coke. even the cartels have to have the right connects.
todayilearned,fgvesfz,t1_fgv4u8v,1581147237.0,yeah not more popular but weed and alcohol go hand in hand in high school/college these days. So many people have smoked weed you wouldn't believe it
todayilearned,fgveqgn,t1_fgv0acn,1581147167.0,"ppl in boston honestly don't do meth. shit ton of adderall up here tho. all the junkies are on H, i think it has something to do with the cartel that does most of the trafficking. Pretty sure the cartels that control the west coast are more into selling meth and the ones that ship it through the docks in the northeast are more into heroin."
hiphopheads,fgquei7,t1_fgqu61s,1581031705.0,less it's withdrawal but yeah no way to OD on xans

nba,fgmd9z2,t1_fglsdpg,1580922342.0,lillard-matthews-batum-aldridge was such a dope lineup. Hickson in 2013 too was solid offensively

nba,fgmal6h,t1_fgm8rqu,1580920987.0,when a player is hot they tend to take similar types of shots. like lebron shooting 5 straight threes when he knew he was feeling it
nba,fgmabmn,t1_fglv7r3,1580920857.0,make shots cause you're feeling it. It's a muscle memory thing
nba,fgma6ko,t1_fgl77zi,1580920779.0,shooting a basketball isn't flipping a coin tho. You can get in a rhythm with muscle memory. That's what the hot hand is and the reason that stats don't tell the whole story.

hiphopheads,fgejzs7,t1_fg366mo,1580701353.0,you love semantics huh. Also even by your logic you're wrong cause FWA was an album. Tidal only. Goofy ass mfs on reddit love to nitpick details to make themselves feel smart. Wayne has dropped like 200 songs (all on projects) in the past 7 years and you're acting like he's been MIA. tough look for you.
hiphopheads,fgejnn9,t1_fg30809,1580701111.0,that's cuz the original album leaked

hiphopheads,fgegopq,t3_exqo4x,1580699120.0,could tell this was a Streetrunner beat within 5 seconds. dude is a master on the samples
hiphopheads,fgeganp,t1_fgcj5so,1580698899.0,I think Cole is the opposite. He raps a lot about how weed makes his brain race a lot. Only time i've heard him rap about smoking recently is on the dreamville album
nba,fgedska,t1_fg7xtpc,1580697246.0,in this context it means not giving the crowd the speech they deserve. Meaning he thinks they deserve a speech from the heart as opposed to a prepared statement
hiphopheads,fg60a5m,t1_fg4gv43,1580546965.0,"A whole generation of these rappers are going to die in their 20s or 30s from drug overdoses, or their bodies just shutting down like fredo. My theory is that lil wayne switched from lean to xans and oxy because of his seizures. He mentions it a lot in his new album"
hiphopheads,fg604rf,t1_fg45ck5,1580546748.0,"i think it was actually ecstasy that ended up testing as Methamphetamine. Thug been taking wack ass flats and shit tons of molly. good chance he enjoys the meth laced x more than molly cause the amounts of molly hes alleged to have taken would make the drug lose effect in my experience, The meth is prolly a better high for him.,"
hiphopheads,fg602pj,t1_fg5rvfq,1580546665.0,"c5 was by far the worst in the Carter series, but it does have a number of great songs. I feel like Free Weezy Album was better than Carter 5  and dedication 6reloaded was an album quality mixtape, which is weird cause they were released pretty close to each other"

hiphopheads,ffgqkaw,t1_ffgprsu,1579912529.0,if you don't understand how the fact that Wayne freestyles everything factors into my opinion of Wayne's lyrical ability idk what to say.
hiphopheads,ffgqgr0,t1_ffgoswb,1579912458.0,did you? everyone i know though it was boring. some good songs but nowhere near the quality of any of his other work
hiphopheads,ffgozyg,t1_ffdxwp8,1579911417.0,because they're two different styles of rap. Wayne freestyles all his bars by punching in and Lupe writes with a pen and a pad
hiphopheads,ffgovo0,t1_ffckmtr,1579911333.0,wayne is not responsible for dumbing down hip hop.
hiphopheads,ffgos1r,t1_ffd7dqy,1579911261.0,never met anyone who thought Views was good

Drugs,ffgkn66,t1_ffepl43,1579908420.0,he had a massive tolerance and you can't die from xanax by itself. this is one of the most incorrect comments i've seen on this site. doesn't sound like you are very educated about drugs.

Drugs,ffdtdob,t3_esv7z7,1579828449.0,"best thread ive seen on this site. if you're just getting into doing drugs, read this post and then read all the comments. the knowledge of ppl who have made the same mistakes as you inevitably will (if you dont get your drug use under control) is so god damn useful."
hiphopheads,ffdoyiy,t1_ffad38d,1579825536.0,"i was under the impression that narcan would be effective as long as there was enough to counter the dose he took. ""more than a bunch of opiates"" doesnt mean anything. People OD on half a gram of dope and get brought back by narcan."
hiphopheads,ffdoo9p,t1_ffac0u5,1579825357.0,"that's not a thing. drugs solve your problems for roughly a month of daily use cause youre too high to care about them. When your tolerance raises, the mood related benefits all but disappear (unless youre in withdrawal) and your life becomes hell -- you're a slave to that substance man. Wake up sick every day and even 100mg oxy cant get you close to a nod. If he was sad when he got addicted, he was in hell by the time he died."

videos,ffdoaka,t1_ffddl2f,1579825121.0,fukishima is an exception. I was saying don't judge japan's EMS by a disaster that has never happened before. Typhoons and earthquakes (that don't hit nuclear plants) Japan is very efficient.
