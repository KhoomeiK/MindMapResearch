That's the oxford definition. However, Merriam defines it as ""moving or extending in different directions from a common point,"" which honestly is the way that I meant it. But I think we have very different connotations to the word. 

I'll tell you this, when I was raped by a woman, it wasn't feminists who offered support, when I was subjected to violence by many many women (mother, girlfriends, fiance, girls I wouldn't fuck), feminists didn't help. When my gentiles were mutilated as a baby, I didn't hear feminists advocate for me. When I had to sign up for the draft? When I was sexually harassed by a female boss? When I get my ass grabbed by chicks in bars? Silence.

Towards your first paragraph. I mean maybe I guess? Like there would be overlap on the Venn-diagram, but that's the case with literally every single ideology or idea. E.g. Some people want stricter immigration, and some of them are racists or isolationists. Some people want less strict immigration, and some of them are racist (surprisingly this is hilariously true) or open borders. supporters. 

>This is the problem with your ""movement"". You aren't asking for equal rights. There are a lot of legitimate men's issues that I 100% have your back on. The problem is that your ""movement"" too consistently leans on bashing women and blaming them for all your problems.

But that is the distinction here. I would argue that for offshoots/co-originating ideas/etc. of MRA that is true. This does not hold true for the MRA movement itself, unless you use it as an umbrella term for anything advocating for men. With that broad and imperfect of a stroke, all your criticisms hold true for Feminism as well.
