If you want to get even deeper on this, being obsessed by goals is NOT a way to live a healthy life. So many people pursue a goal (gold-medal in a sport, retire at 30, pHd, masters degree, job at company X) only to end up depressed when their goal is attained. Because for 10 years they had this goal and now they have nothing. Sure, you can set a new goal, and repeat the loop until death. But it's much better to enjoy the journey, not the destination.

In games everything has a progression. In life things take longer, and sometimes there are long plateaus. That's where a lot of people get discouraged. 

At the gym, initially you add new weight every week. But after a while, even adding 2.5 lbs can take weeks. There's not that food-feeling rush. Same for any sport. Progress becomes very small after a while.
