sex,feaahzx,t3_enzrkz,1578946293.0,"Ooooooh man... when I was a junior in HS, my gf and I lived on opposite sides of town and I had the only car.  So I drove us everywhere.   We spent a fair amount of time at each other's houses but there was no privacy,  so sexy times were limited.  

But, we also had a senior friend that I helped now and then getting home or to where her dad was - the local VFW, maybe 2 miles from where my gf lived.  I quickly discovered a little shed out of view from the highway or streetlights that we could park next to at night for awhile before I drove her on home.  We did that for maybe a month or two...

One day our senior friend comes up to me and quietly informs me that the groundskeeper keeps seeing a little white car parking by the maintenance shed at night and he was thinking of calling the highway patrol on them.   

We're never parked there again.   

Turned out,  his house was directly above us on the hillside,  you just couldn't fully see it during the night with the trees there...but he could have looked over the edge of his driveway and seen us in full view."

In truth,  I played too many video games, tons of D&D, and read a lot books while I  worked full time at a restaurant.   There wasn't much life in a town of 15,000 that only had a Super Walmart for entertainment.  It was a stupid decision.   

I never felt alienated but was always a bit apart from them - for instance,  I worked graveyard for 3 years of my return trip through college.  I was doing alarm system monitoring and dispatch all night with no break during a spring tornado outbreak.   At 8 am I had a Calc 2 test.   They were all complaining because someone set the fire alarm off in the dorms at 3 or 4 am and they all had to go outside for 30 minutes and it wasn't even raining in our town.  I hadn't eaten since 10 PM and had worked my ass off for 9 hours straight,  my throat was a little sore from talking and sometimes shouting for almost the entire night.   And I had a 2 year old at home that liked to wake daddy up early.   I connected well with my classmates that I had a chance to hang with or work on group projects with.  Just that most of my hanging out was when we ran into each other in the library between classes.
