admincraft,ffjr2in,t1_ffjqx37,1580004731.0,"Awesome, thank you. So can I preload the world using paper? Or would I need a separate plugin for that?"
admincraft,ffjqjtx,t1_ffjq677,1580004386.0,So we have our server running vanilla atm. With 6 players our ticks behind are increased to about 650. Not sure if you have an answer to this. But how significant of a performance increase would paper provide? (ball park)
admincraft,ffjpw7y,t1_ffjph8x,1580003957.0,"I'm not at all familiar with paper, spigot, etc. how significant are the changes to vanilla MC when one of these are installed, (does it modify vanilla significantly?)"

backpacking,fdk7k1t,t1_fdjzcgt,1578497879.0,"I saved up 6k and was able to backpack to 6 different countries in SE Asia for a total of 3 months. It's fairly cheap. Book your flight way in advance and you could get yourself a one-way ticket to Bangkok for close to $300 from Chicago. Sometimes cheaper from other airports like L.A. or San Francisco, it depends where you live. And honestly 6k is quite a lot. You can do it a lot cheaper."
college,fdhzifi,t3_elcmhp,1578433015.0,"I work one full-time job. My hours are inconsistent at work, roughly 35-45 hours a week. I pretty much squeeze in time that doesn't exist to do my homework. Just have to utilize all the time you have. I took 19 credits last semester but ended up dropping to 16 because the load was just too much. Ended with a 3.9 though."

Yes, we should continue to promote and study to come up with solutions to environment health. If we all changed at once we'd have even bigger issues to solve. It will and should remain a slow assessed process."

RocketLeague,fcqqgy5,t1_fcq5hee,1577890571.0,"Because the leveling system was updated since release making leveling extremely quick. 100 used to be the cap, and took close to 1,250 hrs to reach. So, for people who played during the first 1-2 yrs their cap was level 100. Also, since the rocket pass was introduced you can now buy levels. Pretty lame."
AskReddit,fcmg8mk,t1_fclehby,1577774102.0,That's not why. It's a marketing ploy.
