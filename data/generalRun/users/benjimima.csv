When he was being interviewed by the police during the initial investigation, he's on record as saying he should've done like Shaq does with his mistresses (bearing in mind, Shaq was marries at the time) and give them money and cars to keep them quiet. The beginning part of the 'How's my ass taste?' has Shaq saying 'Kobe ratted me out, that's why I'm getting divorced'. 

Time's a great healer, though, and Shaq's on record saying he forgave Kobe and, obviously, the two have reconnected over the past couple of years. If there's any solace to be had, it's at least these two figures who will be forever linked had made up."

Then father time caught up and it never happened. Like I said, I think it's totally in play and Lebron's one of the all time great athletes, we have load management now and better sports science, and LeBron just continues like the dude abides, but we'd still expect his production to lessen, particularly playing with AD so if he passes KAJ, it'll be impressive as hell, but until it happens I wouldn't speculate too much."

movies,fckfovl,t1_fcjpax6,1577724289.0,"I have questions about 3PO - if you don't want a droid to read sith, why program a droid to read sith? And who programmed him? And why does he have a bit of banned memory that no one can get to without wiping his memory? And why can't you copy his memory before getting the bit you need? Are there any other languages he's programmed to read but can't tell anyone about? It just makes no sense. It was a lazy contrived macguffin that JJ put in there so they could Goonie out. And, true to form, Goonies never ~~say~~ die, they just force heal if that happens."

movies,fcken7r,t1_fcjk2c2,1577723624.0,"It's so much worse than that - destroy the beacon because no one knows which way is up despite the bridges having ceiling to floor windows all around, and that will leave the destroyers not knowing where they are or having shields because apparently you need to lower your shields to receive a signal and can't put them back up again if what was going to transmit the signal is blown up.

It was the 'some states you can only vote for the party you registered with' bit that threw me. It reads like 'in some states, whoever you're registered with, that's you have to vote for'.

What you're saying makes a lot more sense, thanks for clearing it up."
