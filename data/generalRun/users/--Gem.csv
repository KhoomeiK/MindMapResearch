Here's a small tip that brought me from a 3.4 freshman/sophomore GPA to 4.0 for junior/senior GPA. Don't reread notes, don't look at multiple YouTube videos, don't look at the textbook for hours and hours. That's passive learning and you'll spend 10 hours studying a day for no benefit.

Start active learning. Go to tutoring, go to office hours, make (well designed) flashcards, quiz yourself and others, and here's the best thing: learn the information and then verbalize the concepts!!! Other people call this the Feyman Technique. This last one absolutely saved me by studying with my wife. Do it and good things will come. Good luck, my dude."

The AAMC released a statement echoing my wife's statements. Essentially: Voluntourism is okay if you're in a project that is doing sustainable change and doing it within the scope of a premed. Going to Peru to put  a bandaid on an orphans and then spending the rest of the trip taking selfies at Machu Picchu is not cool.

I think 15 is the best bang for your buck without getting overwhelmed.

Include all your state schools.
Make all other schools in a close range of your GPA and MCAT. Throw on a few ""reach"" and ""safety"" schools. 3 safety and 3 reach is solid if you do 15.
