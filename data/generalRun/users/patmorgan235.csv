And the thing you're boss told you about vacation is BS, if you end up working during you're vacation you're not actually on vacation and are still entitled to those days. This past Christmas break my mom took back a few vacation days because she ended up working from home a lot more than she expected because people at the office kept asking her for stuff (she's an accountant and salaried).
