Had to reload Arena, and when I came back, that match just didn’t count. Ended up losing my last 3 in a row.

AskReddit,fcy5i4d,t3_ejdlbw,1578075133.0,"My mom.     

Now, I’ve never had the relationship with my mom that most have. My mom had me when she was 17, and from what I understand, was a young, irresponsible party girl. From the day I was born, I lived with my grandmother. My father skipped town before I was born, so it was really just my grandma, but mom would come by every so often, and sometimes I’d spend the weekend at her house, especially if it was her weekend to have my half-brother (he lived with his father’s mother...getting the picture yet?).  So not the best or most traditional mother-son relationship, but we spent time together, and did some family-type stuff here and there.     

Anyway, at a certain point, I think I was about 22 at the time, my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer and she suffered from it for quite a while.  Between myself, my mom and my aunt, we pretty much worked shifts for almost a year, taking care of her at home.  Well, at some point we started to notice my grandma’s pain pills were coming up missing. One here, one there. We started keeping track. We’d have to write on the calendar the times and dates that each of her pain pills were given. I’ll tell you from the start, it was abundantly clear where they were going. At some point, my grandma ran out of both of her pills with 5 days before the pharmacist would refill for her. I watched my grandma suffer in pain, dying from cancer and nothing we could do about it because my goddamn mother kept pocketing her pain pills.    

At some point, I told my aunt that when it was all over, I was cutting ties with my mother, and I did. The only time I’ve seen or talked to my mom since then was when my brother had his first son. That was about 9 years ago, and I haven’t had any regrets."
todayilearned,fcxq4cy,t1_fcxnv3l,1578068806.0,"This is a fair point, especially in the US where the public transportation infrastructure just isn’t there in a lot of rural areas. I think the main idea though, is in the next 50 years or so, we’re going to continue to see a higher percentage of people moving into urban areas. There absolutely won’t be the complete abolishment of owning an automobile, but with populations becoming more and more condensed in urban areas, self-driving rideshare automobiles will undoubtedly become more commonplace and may very well become the rule, rather than the exception."

nfl,fcnuh3f,t1_fcn3xxr,1577818659.0,"He said secretly. It’s not like people go around saying “I’m a Bills fan AND a Bears fan.” People have their primary team, and then if that team is having a hopeless year, maybe you root for the other, just to have some sort of reason to stay emotionally invested. I’d say it’s especially common for us folks who’s primary team has had a long streak of poor seasons.
