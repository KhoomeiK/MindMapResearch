I’m having SBK done this Thursday. I’m staying optimistic..."
FoodPorn,fewc7ht,t3_eqrspb,1579408245.0,"The sauce: 

One jar of Bella Terra fire roasted tomatoes. To that I added fresh garlic, red pepper flakes, a small amount of salt, and a small amount of Italian seasoning, and a small amount of olive oil. All to taste. 



The meatballs are as follows: 

2 lbs (900g) ground turkey

1 package of mozzarella pearls 

1 egg

1/2 teaspoon onion powder

2 large cloves minced garlic

1/2 teaspoon Italian Seasoning blend

1/2 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper

1/2 teaspoon Cayenne pepper, optional

1/2 teaspoon crushed red chili pepper flakes, 
optional

1 jar of Marinara sauce 

1 cup (or more if you prefer) shredded cheese of your choice for topping (Mozzarella, Provolone, Monterrey Jack, Cheddar, Romano...)

Fresh basil or parsley, for topping


Directions: 

1. To prepare the meatballs casserole recipe: Preheat your oven to 400ºF (200ºC). Lightly spray a casserole dish with cooking spray.

2. Combine ground turkey, egg, onion powder, garlic, Italian seasoning, Cayenne, crushed chili pepper flakes in a large salad bowl – except for the Marinara sauce, 1 cup cheese, and fresh basil that are set aside for the casserole. Use a small cookie scoop to form the meatballs all the same size, stuff with 3-4 mozzarella pearls, and arrange the meatballs in the casserole dish.

3. Bake your meatballs casserole for 15 to 20 minutes or until fully cooked. Remove the meatballs casserole from the oven and drain the grease.

4. Top with the low carb Marinara sauce and shredded cheese(s) and put the meatballs casserole back in the oven. Bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes until the cheese has fully melted.

ENJOY!"

CPTSD,fdqx9pp,t3_emqtgf,1578676084.0,"I’m so sorry this happened! It takes more courage than most realize to pick up the phone and make the call for an appointment. 

I can’t tell from reading the post if the therapist answered the phone or just a receptionist. If it was a receptionist, that interaction needs to be brought to the therapists attention. Like someone here mentioned, I’d get on social media and post a poor review. Your experience was beyond unacceptable. 

Not sure if you’re familiar with Psychologytoday.com but, it proved to be a great search engine when I was looking for someone to talk to. You can refine your search (e.g. type of insurance, zip code, therapist’s gender, etc...), and email your request for an appt instead of calling. They will call you back and you can go from there. Picking up the phone to make the initial call was too hard for me. This route alleviated some of that pressure. 

Again, I’m so sorry. I hope this helps. Best wishes!"

CPTSD,fda4epd,t1_fd9iwve,1578241500.0,"While, yes, your therapist was blunt, I have to agree with coswoofster. 

Evaluate what your therapist has helped you through up to this point. Is this the first time they’ve been this way with you? Therapy isn’t always easy, and it can’t be easy if you want to make progress. 

Just my two cents but, I’d take what you posted straight to your therapist and talk it out. Let them know how they made you feel. Any great relationship, regardless of how the people are connected, isn’t without conflict. 

Best wishes!!"

Waiting for a few months is exactly where I’m at about it. Lol. I’ve also been taking biotin so hopefully that will help."
