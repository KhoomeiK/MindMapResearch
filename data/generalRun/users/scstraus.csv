* Not buy Nest smoke detectors (though I'm not sure what I'd get instead)

Things I am happy I did:

* Learned early to avoid things without a local API

* Choose Zwave over other standards. IMO there are so many advantages and I haven't had a single issue, going only with Zwave has given me a strong network that I can easily add any device to.

    switch:

The [flic button has an integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/flic/), but requires a cloud service to function which I usually am not a fan of.
