college,fdjo97q,t1_fdj90y5,1578480568.0,Aha I still kind of am freaking out just because of financials. But Henry Ford did become a 4 year university but the programs are limited.
college,fdiq6f7,t1_fdiq2ya,1578448563.0,Thank you for that!! I haven’t got too many congratulations with that one since many people just say how it’s a mistake since I’m young.
daddit,fbf7o75,t1_fbf6tw2,1576803713.0,"That’s some good insight! I have an overbearing amount of a support from my parents which helps my case. I want to raise our child in a stable home and will do what it takes. We talk less and less since we’re not together but still did see each other which I think still helped heal some wounds because we did have some arguments early on after we found out she was pregnant. I try to just think of rolling with the punches to hold back my ego to prevent any arguments are so far it’s working from our earlier arguments. 

Time will definitely tell what will happen but I think things will get better after the new year. I’m going on a weekend getaway trip to hopefully clear my mind and get me better prepared for the upcoming year."
