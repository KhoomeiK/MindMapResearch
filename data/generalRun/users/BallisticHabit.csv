Whatever Jake saw scared the hell out of him, and that was a strange look on him. Guy could tear my arms off and beat me with them, and I'm certainly no pushover. Another commenter suggested the thing to be something called a ""crawler"", and it is the closest description to what he encountered I can find. That is the first and only time I've ever heard of someone seeing like that down there.

Thetruthishere,fclvjve,t1_fcl2nfk,1577757509.0,"After my experiences,and some research, yes I have considered the demon aspect. Honestly, I don't know what to think they were besides incredibly frightening.  It is something I have struggled with in understanding what I saw,and felt. There are differing arguments I have grappled with. 

For example, option A: I saw a demon, which explains the immense feelings of doom, and the unpleasant aftermath in an otherwise easy going individual. 

Option B: I saw the spirit of a deceased coal miner, but the experience left me shaken to the roots of an intelligent, sound individual. Why would a union ""brother"" want to make feel this way. 

Option C: I saw a Djinn, Tommyknocker, Skinwalker, or anything in-between.  Honestly not sure how to wrap my head around that, but here we are...

Option D: I, after 30 plus years on Earth, am only delusional in a coal mine, with hallucinations that can manifest in other coworkers minds so we experience the same thing.....Very unlikely. 

I'm on part four of my stories, with a second segment of ""part 2"" and I've seen the interest wane even if I've become more descriptive of the coal mining aspect of my encounters. It was a job I performed for nearly a decade, and enjoy educationg people in the job It is disappointing to see the interest vanish although these encounters did 100% happen to me and my coworkers."
