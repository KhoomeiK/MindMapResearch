There are 4 traffic lights along this short bridge.  They are timed just perfectly to allow you to go through 2 before having to stop.

If you floor it the instant the light goes green, and go 5mph above the speed limit, you can barely squeeze through the last two lights on a yellow.

Most of his builds require specific weapons with specific annointments.

For Amara to solo m4 slaughter shaft she needs phasezerker or driver com (any roll works), recursion (same type as AS element), maybe an elemental projector of any type.  That's it.  

Meanwhile on my Fl4k I got someone to dupe me a god roll R4kk P4kk mod with jakobs rolls because fuck that farm, and running with everything annointed I still go down all the time.

Optimization being a big one.  The menu can still take seconds to fully open.  In bl2 I could hide behind a box and switch class mods from my backpack in multiplayer.  There's no chance of me being able to get away with that in bl3.

I can bring my framerate down to 1fps reliably by simply firing a full auto gun at full auto in the middle of a group of enemies (brainstormer).

I think gearbox has a great amount of momentum going.  They've had a decent sized content drop every month since launch.  I think they are skipping January because of the holidays which is fine.

Also it used recipes.  And the outcome was the average lvl of the guns.  So it was useless during the normal game because you'd lvl up getting the purples then have a useless underleveled gun as a result.

Also it used recipes, meaning you couldn't just grab whatever purples dropped from a boss run or farming.  Not if you actually wanted it to give you anything good.  You had to be specific with it.

With limited backpack and bank space, it was actually easier to farm what little bosses you could for legendaries rather than attempt to farm for purples to grind.
