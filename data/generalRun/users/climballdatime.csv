The second (luteal/secretory) is very consistently more or less 14 days. Ovulation occurs between these two phases and menses occurs at the end of the secretory phase. So menses consistently occurs two weeks after ovulation. And because an egg survives up to 24 hours, it will have long expired by the time of menses. Therefore you cannot get pregnant during menses (The only caveat to this is that not all vaginal bleeding is menstrual). Source: an OBGYN that I...uh....know"

I believe somewhere I saw that soldiers would still be largely shaven to prevent spread of lice. But yes once gas masks needed to be used clean shaven became the norm.
