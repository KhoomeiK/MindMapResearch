Dogtraining,ffmu610,t3_ets1ec,1580058942.0,Dogs will eat anything. My Pit Bull Lady XENA is a perfect example. She's eaten 2 plastic crate floors(one required surgery at the emergency vet). I have to be very vigilant with her when we go out on walks. The surgeon that operated on XENA told me that she has seen everything in a dog's stomach-INCLUDING CARVING KNIVES. She's operated on two dogs that had carving knives in their stomachs and by some miracle did not do any Major Damage to their insides.
pitbulls,ffjwgfu,t3_etsh13,1580008827.0,"Sounds like XENA.She's a little diva sometimes. She goes out and pees and comes back in ,goes to her crate and then starts barking-take a walk and that's when she decides to take a ""dump""."

aww,ffjnzst,t3_etqqod,1580002671.0,You won't find so fun when your pet undergos surgery for eating plastic-IT'S EXPENSIVE! I know because I've been there.
dogs,ffjnkwu,t1_ffjle2d,1580002398.0,"Tell her to check out this YouTube channel""Little Miss Funeral""."
ProRevenge,ffi9618,t3_et9mno,1579968298.0,"Jack was a ""dipshit""who learned the hard way that you don't mess around with the law just like the idiot here who killed a cop the night before last by running her over."
dogs,ffi8st2,t3_etqpy1,1579968036.0,"For those who are interested,there are two Youtube videos on this,both by funeral directors-one by Kari(can't remember her last name) and one by a woman who's youtube channel is ""Little Miss Funeral"". Both are very informative."
