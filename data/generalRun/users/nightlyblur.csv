personalfinance,ff3s313,t1_ff3q96s,1579547637.0,I've tried it in Excel but it breaks down to variable scenarios
personalfinance,ff3s1tl,t1_ff3qk0o,1579547615.0,"So that method is what most use? I realize a lot can track the past, so today I can see where I went wrong yesterday but I want to see if I have a 10k car payment, how much of right now can go towards that before something else may require it."
asktrp,fe5khx9,t3_enqn5p,1578870575.0,"That’s also a concern I have. The farther I pulled away it’s like she’s crazier and crazier instead of just losing interest. She’s saying things like she hopes I don’t harm her and she feels like I’m stalking her.. I’m not sure what would bring her to say that. Right now I legit have 0 passion anymore. Even if we did meet up or something, my passion is just gone. She isn’t desirable anymore. 

I was going through my friends list and clearing out all my stuff to make room from less distractions and clutter. Reconnecting with old friends. I saw her name on my list. Then I saw it again, and again. I gave up. Sometimes she used to claim she forgot her password. She also will now text me as soon as I get off work as if she’s been waiting all day. At the end she didn’t call me by my first name, she made up a weird ass nickname and kept using it. I could understand if she was cheating and it was a code word but she used to call me it in front of people we both knew and everyone was wondering what the fuck. I would keep it to “hi” “cool” “ok” like this instead of even asking why. This is not me falling again. I honestly don’t bother to text her she is always the one texting or calling me now if I reply. We aren’t kids we were mid 30s she was acting like this"
asktrp,fe4kokz,t1_fe4diym,1578860328.0,"Yeah she is crazy. I’ve read and watched a lot about trp nothing comes close to this situation. Usually guys find out she’s with someone else the whole time and it’s over. But here she’s not with anyone else, there’s no more sex, but it still feels over and she’s still reaching out and at her expense. I know she wants validation which I don’t bother with anymore."
asktrp,fe4jw3z,t1_fe4ct3i,1578860114.0,"I didn’t even think about #4. You’re absolutely right. I’ve lost my passion long ago, like I barely find the energy to even make eye contact talking to her on the few times a month I see her now. But I guess like you said I should keep investing, or enjoying my turn, while it lasts."
asktrp,fe4jf8y,t1_fe45tcj,1578859923.0,So your female friend hooked you up?
asktrp,fe4jb7s,t1_fe3zt4h,1578859900.0,"When I ignore her or tell her I’m busy she sees right through it. Like I said her ex did the same to her and once a woman sees you’re a beta they can’t take you seriously anymore. 

When I don’t reply or ignore her she just labels me as emotional. She gets on a power trip on how men don’t play women games and how we should talk out problems. Overall I know it shouldn’t matter but lowkey it’s irritating because you don’t win either way. You give a woman attention and be a beta or you ignore her and be emotional. It’s like she is the one redpilled"
asktrp,fe3vupq,t1_fe3tv5m,1578853333.0,Very true.
asktrp,fe3vpql,t1_fe3tv4g,1578853287.0,"I don’t. That’s the thing. Like you said I realize my mistakes and it was exhausting anyway, so I gave up. I guess I reimprinted her??"
asktrp,fe3v6zp,t1_fe3tc76,1578853178.0,Well I guess if you could read you would have read that in the title
asktrp,fe3snxt,t1_fe3s3p1,1578852519.0,Should I keep taking her gifts or no
AppleWatchFitness,fdekdce,t1_fdefx1w,1578340877.0,"I used multiple because I felt like one would fail to record, ironically. Then I’d have a backup that did record."
AppleWatchFitness,fdeft71,t1_fdefnbh,1578338091.0,Exactly. They all have the same time of 30 or so minutes. This is after an HOUR of walking. I started them all at the same time. They all should record an hour each
college,fd9jxj4,t1_fd37y9g,1578234414.0,community college. yes
college,fd3eqc4,t1_fd39m5k,1578157632.0,Per review nearly. Look back to like 2017-16
college,fd31uxp,t1_fd2yaph,1578153928.0,Thank you
college,fd2yfdc,t1_fd2vi2j,1578152913.0,"No I’m saying out system was actually switching over that semester. I don’t doubt I did not study well and did not give in as much  as I could. However, I did try to reach out and get some assistance. I still have my unanswered emails. In all my other courses it hasn’t been this way, so I don’t know what that says about me and this professor but I’ve never had an F in college before. I am hoping I can learn from that failure and improve myself for a more successful attempt this time"
college,fd2xkh7,t1_fd2rkkw,1578152719.0,No it’s an AAS
college,fd2qcwc,t1_fd2ndqg,1578150653.0,"Im cyber security too. Did you put a lot of effort into the textbooks or mostly practicing online?

Edit: I mean we get a textbook and workbook. I meant did you use the workbook a lot."
college,fd2mman,t1_fd2iu42,1578149380.0,Any advice?? What was your study routine? I’m studying computers I’ll never touch accounting again do I just need to graduate
college,fd2mhty,t1_fd2k7xx,1578149329.0,It was online. We had to use a third party site as well as transitioning from Blackboard to Canvas
college,fd2j4i1,t1_fd2bum1,1578147973.0,That was a cc
college,fd2j2sb,t1_fd254er,1578147951.0,The class is difficult and unorganized. When I took it my college was switching from blackboard to canvas. There was a lot of confusion ON TOP of those complaints. For example she wasn’t replying to emails for one on one time and she wasn’t submitting grades on time so I wouldn’t know if it didn’t upload vs her being late
college,fd2im72,t1_fd0gryz,1578147774.0,"No lol. This is the one time I even went on that site for a long time. I worked retail for 3 years so I know people mostly write reviews when they’re unhappy, rarely when they are happy so the odds are typically against you. But I lived through that course and everything they’re saying is 100% true. It’s amazing how they’re saying the same exact things 2-3 years ago. Things like NOT responding to emails begging for one on one time, NOT submitting grades so I’m not sure if the assignment didn’t get uploaded or she’s sitting on her hands, NOT giving quizzes that reflect content in the books and online, why trick us? I’m studying computers I don’t have the time to worship this one course in particular I’ve never had a course set up in this way"
college,fd2hw4b,t1_fd0i9rd,1578147465.0,"I have to do attendance, which she hides a message in her lecture videos for us to submit."
college,fd2hoza,t1_fd0zu05,1578147383.0,"We only have two community colleges and both are networked. I peaked at the other college and same story. Two professors, same books, similar reviews but not as bad"
college,fd2hdut,t1_fd2h6hs,1578147255.0,Yes
college,fd0b43e,t1_fd0aq7v,1578116308.0,"Based on reviews, the other community college follows the same overall material/lesson plan and books. They're networked. I guess my only other option would be taking a university course."
college,fd0aa53,t1_fd06jsg,1578115955.0,The only other prof has worse reviews than she does. That's why I think this is crazy for a course required for my degree.
vancouverwa,fcuz3j2,t1_fcrtp7l,1577991384.0,Walking to Clark or up and down mill plain?
vancouverwa,fcuz2lo,t1_fcs6yq6,1577991370.0,Thanks.
