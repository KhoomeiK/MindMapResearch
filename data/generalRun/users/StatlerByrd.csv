>This theme echoes a message Trump delivered to black Americans during his first presidential campaign in the summer of 2016, when he declared: ""At the end of four years, I guarantee you that I will get over 95% of the African-American vote. I promise you. Because I will produce.""  
>

>A prediction that Trump will gain 95% of the black vote is hyperbole, of course, but Trump clearly thinks he should be improving on the 8% vote among blacks he received three years ago. Based on what we see so far in terms of black ratings of the job Trump is doing as president, currently at 10%, I don't see a high probability of that happening."

It's a manufactured campaign, it doesn't have real support in the black community, [8 in 10 black American's think Trump is a racist.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/black-americans-deeply-pessimistic-about-country-under-president-who-more-than-8-in-10-describe-as-a-racist-post-ipsos-poll-finds/2020/01/16/134b705c-37de-11ea-bb7b-265f4554af6d_story.html)

There has absolutely been cooperation and connections between Jewish people that have probably helped insulate their wealth but Jewish people had wealthy groups in society, dating back to when in medieval times Christians were banned from money lending, since it was considered a sin so Jewish people were the only ones allowed to do it, which has always been a very profitable venture, this also linked to why every time there was an issue in the medieval times they blamed the Jews, because kicking them out of a city and taking their stuff was also a profitable venture. Then many rich families have maintained their wealth while succeeding in the modern capitalist mindset but they don't represent the majority of normal Jewish people. What you're looking for doesn't exist and you'll just end up filling in that ""Jewish mindset"" with whatever pre-existing bias' or judgement you have of Jewish people."

They should be shown no mercy or kindness, afforded no legal protection, and ""these poisonous envenomed worms"" should be drafted into forced labor or expelled for all time. He also seems to advocate their murder, writing ""\[W\]e are at fault in not slaying them"". 

Yes this book written in 1543 by a religious fanatic seems a great unbiased source of what Jewish people believe. 

""base, whoring people, that is, no people of God, and their boast of lineage, circumcision, and law must be accounted as filth"". Luther wrote that they are ""full of the devil's feces ... which they wallow in like swine"" 

what a great analysis of Jewish opinions. Martin Luther hated the Jewish people because they didn't convert to Christianity, earlier on in his life, he wanted to give them a chance to convert to Christianity believing they had been denied it. Then when Jewish people didn't want to convert he got all bitchy about it. 

""Luther's fervent desire was that Jews would hear the gospel proclaimed clearly and be moved to convert to Christianity. ""

JoeRogan,ff9iwcy,t1_ff90d16,1579713973.0,"Judging a group of people by their most orthodox extreme people is a pretty bad take, and terrible representation of the average Jewish person's opinions. Those are people who have devoted their entire life to being a ""good jew"" they need it to be superior than the alternative. You find this in any walk of life, if you commit your life to something that never gives you anything tangible in return you need to come up with a justification for it, like if I don't do this I'll go to hell or everybody else is being corrupted by sin except me + my church or I am God's chosen people and this is how he wants me too live. Sometimes that will take the form of an ethnic superiority, out of a need for it since they've wasted their whole life in devotion to it. Jewish people are as individual as any other group of people, there will good people and bad people, kind people and racists, you can't judge a group from the opinions of a few idiots."

"" Some of his social contemporaries considered him unintelligent; his obituary considered ""... his intellectual endowments not being of the most exalted stamp ""

"" At the end of the [American Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War), he bought large amounts of depreciated [Continental currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_American_currency#Continental_currency) that was worthless at the time.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Dexter#cite_note-HNIIxxvii-3) After the war was over, the U.S. government made good on its notes at 1 percent of face value""

"" Because he was largely uneducated, his business sense was considered peculiar. He was advised to send warming pans (used to heat sheets in the cold New England winters) for sale to the West Indies, a tropical area. This advice was a deliberate ploy by other businessmen to get him bankrupted. His captain sold them as ladles for the local molasses industry and made a good profit. ""

"" Next, Dexter sent wool mittens to the same place, where Asian merchants bought them for export to Siberia. ""

"" People jokingly told him to ""[ship coal to Newcastle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coals_to_Newcastle)"". He did so during a miners' strike at the time, and his cargo was sold at a premium.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Dexter#cite_note-knapp-8)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Dexter#cite_note-nash-9) At another time, practical jokers told him he could make money shipping gloves to the [South Sea Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesia). His ships arrived there in time to sell the gloves to Portuguese boats on their way to China. ""

"" He exported Bibles to the [East Indies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Indies) and stray [cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat) to Caribbean islands and again made a profit; eastern missionaries were in need of the Bibles and the Caribbean welcomed a solution to rat infestation.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Dexter#cite_note-Nicholas_p.147-151-1) He also hoarded [whalebone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleen) by mistake, but ended up selling them profitably as a support material for [corsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corset). ""

"" Members of the [New England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England) high society rarely socialized with him. Dexter decided to buy a huge house in [Newburyport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newburyport) from Nathaniel Tracy, a local socialite, and tried to emulate them.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Dexter#cite_note-HNIIxxvii-3)[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Dexter#cite_note-Nicholas_p.147-151-1) His relationships with his wife, daughter, and son also suffered.

About 3,000 people attended Dexter's mock [wake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_(ceremony)). Dexter did not see his wife cry, and after he revealed the hoax, he [caned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caning) her for not grieving his death sufficiently. ""

Dexter also bought an estate in [Chester, New Hampshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester,_New_Hampshire).

I don't know why anyone trusts her on this, or why anybody believes her as a ""progressive"", she's just appropriating the left for political gain. She doesn't actually believe in left wing policies (or at least wouldn't if it was politically less beneficial). She lied about being for Medicare for all and lied about supporting that without raising taxes for the middle class.
