Personally playing both kbm + controller on pc I find the biggest difference is the movement.

Not that I condone the treatment past and present of our natives, but I can understand how some people (mostly city and suburb dwellers) could be very confused by indigenous people “refusing” help. 

I don’t think the situation is something you can truly understand until you’ve been ingrained in the culture. I believe that’s where a lot of the issues arise from. Hell, like I said, I’m not even aboriginal, but just because I grew up out there, I understand what it means to be in your ‘country’ (the regions different tribes belong to are called countries) and I often miss it a lot, there are myths and stories about the different creeks, rivers and rock formations. There’s rituals going back thousands upon thousands of years to do with spiritual growth and coming of age. And it’s all unique to each different country (there’s obviously similarities and overarching themes, but the story of X creek is different to Y creek).

Having said that, even though you can’t understand the particular culture, you definitely seem to understand the issue which is great!"

This has always been a rough one for me, I’m white as a sheet but I grew up in a very remote aboriginal community, ethnically polish, Australia needed skilled tradesmen at the time and my grandad jumped on that boat. He ended up in the middle of the desert so I ended up in the middle of the desert. Anyway, that little backstory out of the way. 

I’m really glad to see some people embracing these opportunities, but there is also still a lot of fear surrounding them — a lot of people see it as a sort of soft-core implementation of the white-Australia policies wherein there was a (largely successful) attempt at erasing indigenous identity. 

Even positive systems like this are still often felt as underhanded because they’re kind of a requirement for a ‘better life’ given the opportunities indigenous Australians have if they live remotely. “Do you want to be successful? We can rescue you”

There’s no real point to this comment, I’m not for or against schools like this. And for people who want it it’s absolutely great. I guess the point is for anyone reading this who sees these opportunities and feels that the black fellas simply “can’t help themselves when given the opportunity” that there is a real fear that it’s just another step in tearing them apart from their identity."

There is nothing wrong with acknowledging that race and stereotypes exist. Assuming you aren’t doing it with underhanded or racist intentions.

“You fucking wog cunt” is different to “fuck doing the yard work mate, take the concrete home it’s time for your wog backyard” you could also use “fucking wogs” depending on tone and situation. 

Say for example your mate does or says something funny and stereotypical, you could just laugh and say “fucking wogs” as the response. 


Personally between Greeks and lebs I’ve never come across any issues. Again assuming the context and situation was appropriate — it’s probably not best to call random strangers wogs. I don’t know any Italians so I can’t say. 

Personally in the age range of people I converse with, 20-45ish years old, the actual original racist intentions behind the word have faded (more so wog than gook) there hasn’t been continued oppression and out and out racism on the level of things like the N word, Cronulla riots being the one major exception.

Personally I’m on 90 atm and I’m considering turning it down, things are too small for me to see properly on the scale of the maps we have in this game. Ideally I’d buy a bigger monitor, but good monitors are expensive."
modernwarfare,ff4ajer,t1_ff3k9ch,1579559129.0,"Because the monitor is 10 inches from my face not 8 foot. Apparently one of the reasons (excuses?) that consoles use a lower FoV is one, that’s close to the natural viewport from what they deem an average TV at an average distance (imagine looking throw a window rather than it being a tv, depending on the size and distance of the window you have a different fov). And then two, touching on the last point, very low console FOV on screens close to you can and do cause motion sickness for some people. 

Having said that it’s pretty common to play consoles on a monitor on your desk these days. So I’m of the opinion console players should have it — but the benefits you get from it aren’t huge unless you’re already a good player to take advantage of it. 

You could argue it’s negligible, CS:GO pros for the longest time used 4:3 which had a tiny FoV, the change in aspect ratio to 16:9 pretty much mirrors older players aging out and new players getting in, suggesting it was mostly personal preference one way or the other.

A cod pub has wider sight lines though, and it’s a lot faster, so it’s not a perfect analogy. But it adds some more to the debate than “more = better” 

With foot sounds the way they are you /could/ argue a wider FoV isn’t worth sacrificing your accuracy at range. You can already tell if someone is in your peripheral vision, increasing your FoV just makes things look smaller. 

I use a pretty modest FoV, it’s large for console and small for PC, but it’s a comfort thing not a performance thing."

Big name yearly festivals in all major cities and ‘cultural hotspots’ Byron bay, as an example. 
Then you have mid sized more local festivals that typically feature smaller international and local bands.
And then you have “Bush doofs” basically pirate festivals in the Bush with light shows, lots of psytrance and lots of drugs. Very good time. 

There’s obviously also genre specific festivals, your rock festivals, edm, Rnb/rap, indie etc. 

The bigger festivals will have multiple stages and people will camp there by the thousands. A Bush doof might have 100 people but normally only 1 stage. 

[skip through that and you get the idea of a Bush doof](https://youtu.be/rbMCOacpB0w) though even with them there is variance, some may as well be roid head + beach babe affairs, and some are more peace and love women with hairy armpits walking around topless affairs.

All this race baiting bullshit reminds me of when I met a long lost childhood friend of mine about 5 years ago, I grew up in a predomintely aboriginal town with only aboriginal friends. Anyway, I’m having a few drinks with friends in the city and I see him walk past “hey black fella!” He gave me a sort of double look and kept walking.. my friends start to chastise me and I’m explaining I’m certain I know him.. anyway cut a long story short he must have been eyeing me off because he realised who I was and came back over and we had a great chat.. the look on people’s faces watching a pasty white guy with a VERY polish ancestry (I got that big fat round head)  switch from English to [Pitjantjatjara](https://youtu.be/BdiWMpudL5k) was great.

Now, does that relate to intra-religion terrorism? Not directly but both sides in that big can of worms have bodies to point at. 

Every young man or woman who has lost the lives of loved ones because of American imeprialism has my full support in exacting their revenge in whatever method they see fit. Since they can’t indiscriminately drone strike American civilians they will have to do it another way.

I didn't bother looking at other coffees.  


Regardless, my ABE is 200mg a scoop and prejym is 300mg a scoop. 1 cup of coffee, 1 scoop of preworkout and a can of energy drink and you're over the recommended daily max intake. Not even considering the very popular double scoop preworkout."
