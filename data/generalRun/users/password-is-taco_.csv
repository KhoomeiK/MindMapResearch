Cringetopia,feuf1ek,t1_feu61xe,1579385939.0,"I'm not sure that any animal is guaranteed a swift and sure death in a slaughterhouse. 


One glaring difference between the animals that are raised for meat and wild animals is that wild animals have a chance at actually living life. Sure life is tough, but they see fresh air and sunshine, eat a natural diet and get a chance to exercise their basic tendencies. Animals raised for meat live in crowded conditions in their own filth, are fed an unnatural diet meant to fatten them up as fast as possible, resulting in their internal organs and muscles failing to keep up, and countless other atrocities. 


So I would say, despite the terrible death for both groups of animals, the wildlife at least had a chance at decent life up until then. Those raised for meat never get that opportunity; it's shit from the day they're born until the day they die."

You should be proud! All countries have nasty pasts but, as far as I know, none have handled theirs as well as the Germans. Over here one thing that gets ignored are the atrocities our government has committed against Native Americans. Some might argue that these instances are a lot less recent than WWII but the Indian Termination policy was in place from the mid 1940's to mid 60's. Although the scale might not be as grand, it's a terrible infringement on the rights of a specific group of people that many either don't realize or turn a blind eye to. I didn't learn to what  degree our government screwed them over until this past semester of college and I'm 30. Sorry for the rant... but the actions of governments or leaders don't often reflect the feelings of the people. 


I have tried to learn German but that was 12 years ago. My first semester of college I took a German course but I dropped out of school entirely after a month for health reasons. I've tried duolingo since then but I don't have self discipline apparently. I do listen to a few German bands: Rammstein (though I hear Germans don't like them), Eisbrecher, and especially Kraftwerk; I love hearing the language. Do you have any bands you recommend?
