But I‚Äôve always though of it as more indicative of moving on after what you thought your life was always going to be. Tony always assumed that his life would always be he and his wife, moving through the world and growing old together. Now he has to face probably half of his life, perhaps more, without her....without the comfort of simply knowing how things were going to be. 

He‚Äôs moving on with Life...After his previously assumed existence has crashed down around him."

jobadvice,ff43fxn,t3_erj3ny,1579554700.0,"It‚Äôs not unethical but it may be against the rules depending on where you work. The bigger the employer the harder it is for them to prohibit workplace romance. 

I used to work for a regional big box retailer that (at the time) employed around 63,000 people. I recall at my store, the Back Receiving Manager dating (and eventually marrying) one of the Journeyman Meat Cutters. I was a Department Manager dating the store‚Äôs Administrative Assistant, for a while. We had all kinds of couples dating and living together and married during my tenure. The only thing the company really frowned upon was if a manager was dating someone directly under their authority. Otherwise, it was pretty much open season. 

But it could be a totally different situation at a company that has fifteen employees or seventy five employees. Just beware that it can become difficult to disentangle yourself from a workplace dating scenario gone bad."

The church doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about anything but the business of churching and to hell with anyone who would fuck with them. 

The church is all about self preservation and hoarding as many assets as possible. That‚Äôs all they care about and the sooner Catholics worldwide realize that and do something about it, the better.
