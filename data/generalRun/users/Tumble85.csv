askcarsales,ffcuncr,t1_ffcbymq,1579807606.0,"I saw a 60 month lease with Toyota once, the poor guy didn't understand that he wasn't going to keep his car after he was done paying the payments. He came in, test drove an Avalon and said ""I only got 5 payments left on this Camry and I don't have many miles, think we can work something out?"" and I said ""almost certainly""

When we ran his info we were like ""wtf"" and asked the guy why he wanted a 5 year lease and he didn't know he was actually in a 5 year lease, he though he was going to own the car. And for the payments he was making he really should have.

Crazy and sad situation, never knew Toyota would do leases like that."

todayilearned,ff4jlb3,t1_ff4e8qi,1579565186.0,It's not that hard to say though. Modern equipment and technique allows goalies to cover more of the goal and drop down more. This makes them more effective.
todayilearned,ff4jf5i,t1_ff487wx,1579565052.0,"The butterfly technique and the equipment is probably the biggest factor, while Gretzky was great he would probably ""just"" be a top player today instead of The Greatest Of All Time. 

Goalies today are able to block off more of the goal with the butterfly technique, and they are able to get closer to the ground to stop more shots due to better protective equipment. More goals are scored when the puck stays close to the ice. In the 80s it was much more dangerous for a goalie to dive down to stop it because... well they had a higher risk of getting fucked up by skates and sticks. Modern equipment protects them better so modern goalies are much harder to get by."
