The people at school are there to help you (and paid for it )and you shouldn't feel bad for asking for help in terms of understanding somethings you are going through. Though don't let your identity get caught up in your feelings and thoughts as they are not who you are, ex. dont identify as a person with depression. observe your feelings for what they are and take responsibility for your own wellbeing. Seeking help to work on some symptoms you are feelings would be a responsible action on your part so don't feel bad or ashamed about it for taking up people's time."

datingoverthirty,fdlmgxl,t1_fdklyra,1578527356.0,I mean if what you are looking for is physical pleasure from casual sex then there is no problem at all as long as you are happy. But OP reports feeling empty after the deed which is why I said what I said. I think JP got some wisdom that can help if it resonate to you. You make up your own mind on what you should or shouldn't do. I am just presenting my personal opinion on the topic of casual sex. if you are happy with what you are doing then by all means do what you want who am I to judge.

depression,fdkajfe,t3_elul13,1578499771.0,"Who is this I? detach yourself from your maladjusted ego and realise that these thoughts are not who you are.

depression,fdk6wsi,t1_fdk5v7l,1578497458.0,"well think of it like this. it's not that they don't want to help you. but if you are always late then that time could of been used to help other patient and make an impact in this world but instead is just wasted because you are late. don't be hard on yourself, i think you personally need to figure out your own relationship with time. how is your sleep schedule? diet? do you exercise? I find if you leave for your things 20 mins earlier than you should it would help. What tools or planning strategies are your using for your time management? you need a plan for how you are going to live life in the day to day at least.  if not I suggest start documenting your day to raise awareness. something like this;:

when you wake up at 10:32 write that down on ur phone, 
eat at 11:06, 
get dressed at 12:10. 
leave for 1pm appointment that is a 20 min walk at 12:30.

datingoverthirty,fdk6jqi,t3_eltwxh,1578497218.0,"I remember Jordan Peterson saying that there is nothing casual about sex, it is something that can touch the roots of a person. I have stopped having casual experiences because of similar feeling as you, sex without love is just mutual masturbation instead of an activity that bonds two people emotionally and physically. The emptiness after meaningless sex isnt something out of the norm and is in fact reflective of the situation, what were you expecting to find through meaningless sex, love, security, and fulfillment? I suggest to keep sex within the realm of commited relationship for the maximum optimization of your well-being and enjoyment of sexual things, otherwise why not just masturbatemasturbate and hug a pet for comfort? Although this is just my personal opinion."

I think if your issues are bothering her and she speaks up its good to keep an open ear to how she is feeling as well. We all have feelings and thoughts, unfortunately for many of us on this sub including me they are often negative. I found it helpful to detatch myself from my thoughts and feelings, acknowledge them and try to let them pass. you are like the sky and those thoughts and feelings are like the clouds and weather. you are the space in which those thoughts and feeling pass through but they are not you. I hope you get better and your relationship with your family improves as well. if she is making you feeling like this maybe you can try to better communicate how you feel to her so she understands better how she is making you feel on top of all that you are going through.

I think we do unnecessary things to escape and not face the reality of our lives. meditation taught me to acknowledge what is and work with it instead of running away unconsciously. by becoming more aware, you gain a wider perspective of your internal mentation process and can face the issues from a position less tangled up with your ego. i am much more at peace now (although the anti depressents, habit changes, and just over all taking a break from everything for many months probably played an important role as well).

meditation definitely helped me lot in sorting out things internally and becoming aware of feeling I was suppressing

also I think it's easy to be mindless so thats why we do those easy things like browsing social media for hours. it's easy and comfortable to not think and just consume mindlessly. to tackle this I  changed my following on social media to more positive and motivational content so if I do end up browsing it at least it was somewhat educational"
