I pump water taking readings on my phone or ipad every 2-5 minutes. When water is ""stabilized"" meaning that we are getting water from the aquifer and not just the well itself, I disconnect  the flow through cell and fill up containers to ship to lab. 

I can typically do 2-6 soil borings in a day depending on depth. 

I can sample 6-12 wells in a day depending on stabilization time and how many bottles I have to fill.
