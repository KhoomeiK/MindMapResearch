happy,fddtwb3,t1_fddr0io,1578323863.0,Thank you :) there’s definitely a few individuals that certainly disagree but I knew that would happen. I’m glad you appreciated my post <3
happy,fddqser,t1_fddoli4,1578321513.0,Ooh that’s a tough one. I’ll have to have a think before I respond- great question :)
happy,fddpxll,t1_fddppk7,1578320810.0,"I know you say that with bitter sarcasm and a self prescribed duty to guard the Internet, however many people have reached out and have said that this post helped them. So, I would have to agree that yes. Mission accomplished :) 

Have a nice day, genuinely."
happy,fddh28z,t1_fdcwqbs,1578311956.0,"Let me clarify. 

For as long as I can remember I have been incredibly anxious. As a child I would be terrified to leave the house and would self harm before I even know what it was (ripping out my hair, starving myself etc). 
My father was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer when I was 11 and because of this I started having counselling through Dove House Hospice. 
When I was 13 I became actively suicidal. My self harming became more serious, as I began using razor blades (on my thighs and feet- so don’t worry most honorable u/PoopShepard nothing attention seeking- god forbid). 
When my father passed in 2016, I was ruined. I stopped functioning. I stopped feeling. 
And you know what? I didn’t tell anybody. 
My therapists knew, my doctors knew, and that was it. 
My most of my friends didn’t even know that my dad had died, let alone I was planning on doing so too. 
I kept it too myself, I didn’t want to tell others because of the incredibly toxic ideas you’re perpetuating that if you share your troubles, you’re just doing it for attention. 

I believed that, and it almost killed me. 

Now I’m not sure about you, but I don’t care about meaningless internet points. But I do care about people. And I wanted to help- even just one person- have hope. 

The reason I have photos of me crying is not for karma whoring or attention seeking. As you will see. It’s been in my camera roll for over 10 months before I posted it- what’s the point in that? 

You see, my doubtful internet friend, that I would use photographs as a sort of self improvement journey. And I recommend it to everyone really. I was too depressed to write but my therapists wanted me to write down how I felt. I couldn’t. But it took a lot less thought to just snap a quick picture. 

I have endless photos like this, that show my slow progression into betterment. And before I deleted them, I thought hey, why not show some people that might need it? 

Plus its a huge achievement. I’m proud of myself. I’m happy. 

Are you?"

happy,fdcjix3,t1_fdcizse,1578276460.0,"Hahah that was a pretty crazy event. The post was reuploaded onto Instagram by a “relatable comedy” account (like everything seems to be smdh) and because of this, pretty much everyone in the school I was attending at the time (I’m at college now) found it. All eyes on me, students and teachers, for a solid few days. Very strange. But hey, at least I have a easy out for all those annoying “team work ice breaker fun fact about yourself” questions I suppose??"

That’s really what I wanted this post to be- rather than just a karma grab or a self obsession show, I am really proud of how far I’ve come though, and I’d love to be able to help other people do the same.

I hope you’re able to make this decade your own <3"

happy,fdc6zvr,t1_fdc6l5l,1578268335.0,"Haha sadly not . However as a child I did believe that god gave us dimples because when he made us, he made us as muffins. To test if we were ready, he’d take us out the oven and poke us to make sure we were cooked properly. People with dimples just had to go back into the muffin oven for a little bit longer!! 
How cute :)"
happy,fdc5xb3,t1_fdc5ezp,1578267739.0,"Genuinely, I think I would be dead by now if I didn’t live in the UK. And that’s by no means an exaggeration. The combination of medication and therapy saved my life, free health care saved my life. My house hold income is less than £8,000 a year. I could never have afforded the help I received if it wasn’t for the NHS nor would I have wanted to burden my family with the financial stress this would at.

I would have let myself die. 

It breaks my heart that so many people aren’t born, at chance, in a country which offers this. Your life should never be behind a pay wall. But if it is, and you can afford to cross it, please please please do."

I shaved it off in the summer because I wanted a fresh start, you know? and it really helped in my journey of self acceptance <3 plus it was soooo much easier to maintain haha (especially compared to my heavily straightened naturally curly hair in the first pic)

I was actually diagnosed with clinical depression & anxiety disorder in 2017, after my dad passed away in 2016. I was deeply suicidal and entirely disassociated since 2015 which is, to the highest extent, kinda sucky.
