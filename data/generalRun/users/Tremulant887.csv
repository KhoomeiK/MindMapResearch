I guess I'm a part of the issue as I haven't played in a year or so. There's so much out there I want to play and this game doesn't exactly pull me back in."

I know bows have been talked about here. I'd still like to see it with a legendary Comanche hunter."
buildapc,ffabaam,t1_ff94m3y,1579731532.0,"> Finally, if your not using all the additionally paid for features such as addtional PCIe and SATA, why are you even getting it.

It was a 'maybe I'll use that' kinda thing. Opening myself to upgrades. The board went back really fast and I never found a solution. I assumed it was software related and at this point I'm calling it hardware and building something new.

Now that I've seen all the stuff I had and didn't use, I suppose there's no real point in getting those additional features."

todayilearned,fescj19,t1_fes8uyd,1579363844.0,"Linkin Park is considered metal? We still had Amon Amarth, Meshuggah, Machine Head, Mastodon... (what's with all the good bands having M names?)

Pantera was a thing til '03 I think. Hell, even Slayer was putting out good music. They were nominated for a Grammy in the early 2000s only to be beaten by Tool, which is perfectly acceptable. 

I guess if you were a toddler in that time frame and your parents jammed the rock radio in America, that was your first metal. Any older and you had the rise and fall of Napster, rubbin' one out to Juliya on Fuse TV, and the last bit of metal on MTV
s Headbanger's Ball.

CruciblePlaybook,fenua0v,t3_eq1yji,1579290838.0,"Depends on what class you're playing, if you want super vs super tips, neutral game, etc.

As a titan I've been enjoying the hell out of middle tree solar. One right click wrecks people. I rarely use it aggressively, but as proactive vs other supers. 
The throwing hammer + sticky nade takes 2-3 seconds to toss both, but if they land the hunter will be weak and fairly easy to finish. If you don't have another player helping you shoot and/or aren't positioned well to have the time to do damage, fighting them typically won't work. Purple bois are quick."
CruciblePlaybook,fenq24r,t1_fenihyt,1579289200.0,Pretty sure it has the best aim assist of all melee abilities.
DestinyTheGame,fekisnw,t1_fekdnid,1579200923.0,"I started running middle tree solar. The throwing hammer with solar plexus doesn't ohk, but it chunks people for 75% or so. A tap with a hand cannon and a hammer is a fast fight.

The super itself also shuts down everything. I had a 3v3 where the enemy tried to pop all 3 supers in a flex win. I killed them all."
DestinyTheGame,fejucyb,t3_ep8qj9,1579186050.0,"I agree with everything being said, but I find void battery useful on titan. I'd love to see a faster cast time on barrier instead of a shield, but I also think if you're using barrier while someone is aiming at you, you're rolling the dice. Void battery helps those bad rolls.
I can turn a corner where someone gets the advantage over me, and depending on their weapon, actually have the chance to cast a barrier instead of dipping back into cover."
CruciblePlaybook,feiejuc,t3_epbjve,1579136673.0,My biggest issue is that aim assist on the throwing knife. I've seen them thrown past my shoulders and curve into my face like it's a boomerang. I chalked it up to p2p issues.

It's the formula for ad revenue these days. Outrage is more likely to elicit a response therefore keeping you on a page longer. Don't tell me it doesn't exist when it's the very reason you're commenting. Me as well."

dank_meme,fe2o2zo,t1_fdz4dje,1578841062.0,Most of those good paying jobs aren't that high. It's more like 35 hours of overtime at $12-16 an hour. That is still good on a paycheck.
dank_meme,fe2myrh,t1_fe0ld4f,1578840715.0,"So the Earth was warmer 55 million years ago. I *want* to believe the things we're going through now are just natural occurrences. I find it hard to deny, at bare minimum, humans are speeding the issues up. Maybe there's a combination and were actually making it even worse than it should be. Maybe it's all natural and we need to move away from the areas that will have 140°F summers.

I'll stand on the safe side, just in case. I haven't seen anything terribly convincing that human-made climate issues aren't real, but I have seen things like the Pacific garbage patch."

I don't know what the people think of hunters there, but I'd expect (and see in Texas) hunters as the first in line to help animals. It kills me to see these poor animals like that. Big props to him and everyone helping.
