cats,ffihcgv,t3_ett6y5,1579973890.0,"When you bring Kitty home, keep them in a smaller, closed off room for a day, with all the things they'll need. Toys, food, water, litter box, and places to hide. 

Don't try to touch them or pull them out of hiding to cuddle. Sit in the room, but not close. Read aloud to them to get them used to your voice and presence. Don't want to read? Tell them your life story, about your family, your work, trips you've taken. Tell them how much fun the two of you will have.

A trick I picked up when I brought my babes home, is to let them sniff tour fingers before trying to pet them. This gives them an idea of your scent. If they rub their face on your hand, they are marking you with theirs. Don't immediately try to pat their heads, as it make make them feel vulnerable and threatened. Big heavy thing coming down out of sight on you head, you might feel the same way. Brush the back of your fingers along the side of their muzzle to get their scent on you.

After the first day, when they begin to come out around you, bring them out to the rest of your home, a little at a time. Remember - explorative and inquisitive cats will adjust more quickly! 

They may not eat for a day or two, or use the litter box, but as they adjust, this will pass. You can talk to the shelter folks or a veterinarian about Feliway pheromone diffusers to see if there  are ones to kelp kitties feel more comfortable.

Sorry for the novel lol. Hope you and your new furbaby have a long and happy time together."

cats,ffevj7w,t3_et9c7o,1579867345.0,"Here's what I've gather from Internet reading and  from watching my two different-gendered kittens. 

Keep an eye on them when they are ""fighting."" If no one is making noise - no growling, hissing, or yowling - and their ears aren't constantly pinned back, they may not be fighting, just roughhousing. Also watch how the action progresses. If it's a cause of fight back away fight back away, then it is also playing. A cat in a serious fight won't stop in the middle to change direction.

Roughhousing is important for kittens. It works along the social ladder, and it helps teach them hunting and stalking skills to ambush a playmate. Your boy is 3 months, you said, so that means he's in prime ""kitten crazies"" time. Once his new little sister is a little older, I suspect she'll be the same way.

It can be a little freaky for humans, I know. My 9 month old boy will grab onto his sister and use his back feet to try to kangaroo kick her in the head, but she always gets him back. 

If you want to try to calm them down a little, ask your vet if there's a type of Feliway pheromone diffuser that can help. I think remember hearing they have one that helps cats adjust to each other or reduce fighting, but I can't be sure on that.

That being said, the tummy is a very socially vulnerable spot for a kitten. Because little Freddie is so young, and because you haven't had him for a terribly long time, he simply may not trust you enough yet to let you near that vulnerable spot. Don't try to force him into letting you rub his tummy; it will only make him trust it less.

If Freddie ever rolls onto his back and presents his tummy to you, approach with caution. Sometimes it's a trap and he's trying to play fight you. Scratch under his chin first and work your way down."

Make sure you don't crowd her, make sure she has safe spaces to hide, and let her come to you. Be a presence, but not an intrusive one. Talk to her, make all the little ""human-communicates-with-cat"" noises she's familiar with, leave a shirt that smells like you in a hiding space...all these things can help. You can also talk to your veterinarian about stress-reducing pheromone distributors from Feliway. I believe they have one that's designed help reduce the stress inherent with a move.

As for other cats wandering outside, your Nizzy already sounds pretty calm, so I doubt they would bother her much. If she knows there is a barrier between her and them and she gets annoyed, she's liable to just walk away.

Personally, my brain goes to tribes in Africa that practice ritual scarification and body modification, but I don't think any one Earthly tribe or religion can fully encompass a description of the Yuuzhan Vong.

StarWarsEU,fda739a,t3_ekf3lu,1578242504.0,"I can't say I've really thought of them as an analogy for an existing race or religion in the real world. It's Star Wars; there will be subtle parallels, the occasional strong one, but by far, most things that happen are far removed from any Earthly analogy.

Yes, the Yuuzhan Vong are deeply religious, to the point of fanaticism and radicalism, but I think it's horrendously unfair to refer to them as a ""clear stand-in for Muslims"" when non-radical Islam is a religion centred on peace. Even radical Islam doesn't extend into ritual scarification and self-mutilation as the Yuuzhan Vong do. The difference should be clear.

That being said, I enjoy the multi-layered and multi-faceted polytheistic approach to the Yuuzhan Vong, their society, and their religion. If I were to compare them to anything else, I'd call it a hyper-aggressive version of Tolkien-esque Orcs, mixed with the intelligence of Elvish society and the pride and the war strategy of Dwarves."

cats,fcwgmzf,t3_ej8qi3,1578025122.0,"You can try Feliway pheromone therapy to lessen the aggressive fighting. Your veterinarian should be able to recommend it as well. Also make sure there's plenty of food and water, separate litter boxes, lots of toys, and that you give both the same amount of love and attention.

Also watch how the foghts go, to determine if its true aggression. I have a boy and girl as well, 9 months old, from the same litter and our place sometimes a kitty Wrestlemania. If there is no noise (hissing, growling, yowling) and no excessive/harmful biting and their ears aren't pinned back, it's play-fighting. Also, watch for reciprocity - your boy starting it, then your girl going after him. Watch for breaks in the action; aggressively fighting cats don't take them, play-fighting cats do.

If you spot an aggressive fight, break it up. Loud noise, putting a barrier between them (not yourself or your limbs), enforced ""time-out"" - as long as they stop.

Hope things get better for you and your babies!"
