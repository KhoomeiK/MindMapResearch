chapotraphouse2,ffd3eca,t3_esw5wo,1579812637.0,"Republicans don't passively win elections. They have the continuous financial support of the global rich, the support of the local petit bourgeoisie, and the local cable/radio/newspaper media class, wherever they run. They wouldn't be able to win elections without that support. You, socialist trying to hijack the Republican party, have to fight against all of those interests and somehow appeal to a base primed to hate everything you stand for, assuming the party lets you run at all. 

Socdem entryism in the Democratic party, to the extent that it's worked, has been fueled by an energetic grassroots movement. The left wins with people. The only way to win with people within the Republican party is to be extremely Christian, so unless you can pull out a wife, five kids, the full support of like 10 different protestant churches, and an uncanny ability to recite scripture, you're fucked. Even then, you're going to have a hard time convincing Evangelicals that ""godless"" socialism is the way forward. It just wouldn't work.

(Also, my guy, less bigotry is a major difference.)"

The problem is winning the Republican primary, which is impossible to do as a socialist, and then trying to win a general election as a republican with none of the resources Republican nominees usually have."
OurPresident,ff6qh7r,t1_ff6nt57,1579632752.0,"People who call themselves ""moderates"" are usually just people who've never developed strong political opinions and pick what they think is the path of least resistance when pressed. Don't ""appeal to moderates"" by moving to where they think they are, appeal to them by showing them how a left-wing movement would help them.

The best way to do this is to get them to think of themselves as working people first. Once they do that, the rest follows."

Also, CEOs don't do any of the work themselves, they manage others. That's the point of having the position. Look at any CEO's schedule and you'll see that it's almost entirely meetings, not performing any real labor."
