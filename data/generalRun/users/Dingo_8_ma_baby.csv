I understand the anxiety bit as well as being really quiet, my girlfriend is that way.
My advice: look at something that seems scary or intimidating, like public speaking, and think of something much much worse.
Imagine trying to escape a volcano erupting and your on the summit. Where would you rather be? Escaping an erupting volcano with hot ash pouring down on your skin and burning you severely, the air is so hot it burns with every breath. The feeling of beong suffocated even though your outside or would you rather be in an tempreture controlled room giving a 7 minute speech?

I take it your a highschooler?...15 or 16... ?

If so you're still young, you have plenty of time to figure yourself out. But I'd recommend putting yourself in ""anxiety inducing situations"" now, desensitize yourself a bit, a little bit of suffering now will go a LONG way at building your character later.

Think of it as a game... You just passed this first round, boom 500xp.
