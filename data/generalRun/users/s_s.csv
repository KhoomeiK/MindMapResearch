   Shedding weight is about self-imposed rules. Mine was: No moving and phone out at the same time. One or the other. 
* I just used ziplocks, and followed good practices like not sleeping where I eat. After a few meals, your trash is 3-4 nested plastic bags deep-- which is not really any different than an opsack, without the extra weight.
* I did the same, for similar reasons but also because my inflatable pad (klymit inertia Xwave) was uninsulated. Probably not super necessary for you, if you clean off your sleep spots off first.  Just try not to sleep on top of the chollas; they are not fluffy. :P
* pants are fine but you'll be hot. I did shorts but also had dance pants which did a commendable job shedding the wait-a-minute. Worst section for it IMO was transversing the Four Peaks north of Lake Roosevelt. 
*  I took the 2 port non quick charger and it was honestly brutal waiting for things to charge sometimes (e.g. the bathroom at Mormon Lake). I had a powercore 10k, but was also charging my garmin watch (which updated loved ones when I had data coverage and kept me from opening guthooks too much)

   Options at the GCV campground IGA store aren't terrible, and what I had to do. Had to bounce my box to Flag (SOBO). General delivery in Flag is a pain because you have to go all the way out to N Postal Blvd. :(

aww,ff2xj1y,t1_ff2p07k,1579527784.0,"The goal is to stress the muscle and not the ligaments. Extending the knee over the toes in a lunge puts the ligaments in a compromised position.

 A lunge is lowering yourself with the assistance of gravity and then exploding out of it. 

Think of it like a cat climbing a tree. Just because it can get to a spot doesn't mean it should go there, because it needs to consider getting down as well.

We'll, just because you can lower yourself into a certain position doesn't mean your joints are going to be in a ready position to sucessfully explode out of it. You have to carefully position yourself to execute the movement safely. Add weights and increase the explosive force required and form becomes that much more important.

> Whenever you exercise your muscles you are tearing the fibers slightly by resisting some force.

This is not how exercise or hypertrophy works. ""tearing fibers"" was used as an analogy at one time and many people took it as what is actually happening. But just like your muscles aren't literally ""a cat climbing a tree"" they aren't actually ""tearing"", either. 

Think about it mr engineer: exercise is the practice of muscles contracting and uncontracting. You're compressing, *not lengthing the muscle* beyond it's relaxed state, so how would it suffer from a tensile (or sheer I guess) failure such a tearing?"

Beside that, arch involves setting a lot of configurations manually, mostly for the sake of doing it intentionally. In Ubuntu a lot of choices are made for you that probably work best for most people. If you find reasons to care about those choices, then using a distro that lets you making the choices yourself becomes important to you. 

The other part of making these choices is that you have to know what order to do them in (generally by following an external guide). This makes the process more engaging, similar to how early versions of minecraft were engaging because you had to look up all the crafting recipes on the game's wiki.
