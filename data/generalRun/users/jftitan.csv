Not, a ""not enough housing"". But a problem of too many houses empty from unaffordability. 


I was having this discussion with a close relative the other day. 


""So in the 70s, how much did you buy this house for?"".  4bedroom, 2bath, 2car garage, with swimming pool.    

""$48k"".  -he said. 

""How were you able to afford that on such a low end job?"". 

""I worked for the company for 27 years"". -he said  Retired with a pension. 


""How much could I buy this house for now?""

""I'll sell this house for $350k"". -he pomps. 

""So how much did you put into this house over the years? (Besides renovations and upkeep)""

""Not much"" -he said. (he added a workshop in the back yard.) 



Now compare his living to today. 


His salary back then was 20ish k a year.  My salary today is around 30k a year on good years.  But to buy a 3bedroom 1bath house down the street would cost me over 170k.  Compatibles thanks to what I've learned about real estate, there isn't a damn home I could buy for less than 40k unless it's in a really really bad shape or neighborhood. 

So what about job security?  

So far I've worked 23 years in my IT industry.   But to keep a job, today is like winning the lotto.  Either I'm laid off for being paid too much, or I'm laid off because automation (I tend to automate my job). At one point I literally put 5 accountants out of a job because I took their weeklong process and automated it into a 1hr process that printed the reports on the same day when asked. 

Was I rewarded for saving the company money?   Nope I was soon let go, because the need for in-house IT staff was outsourced

I worked for RadioShack for 10 years.   My pension was stolen back in 2015 by the execs who used our pension accounts to shore up  RadioShack stock.   Which those same execs and shareholders  cashed out.  I didn't find out until I went through a filing cabinet of mine and realized the 18yr old me, was smart and signed up.   (This was when investments and 401k and the IRA Roth came about... Everyone said not to put into a IRA because it was so new and no one knew what would happen)....  Yeah... 

I am now self employed at a huge disadvantage... I'm 37 now, my birth defects are starting to show and healthcare is non-existent for me (pre existing...  Ya know before Obamacare ACA, insurance for me was $1900 a month....  With a pay rate of $1200 a month I barely could afford my apartment. Back then)

So how can a ""millennial"" afford anything when pay rates haven't improved in decades? 

Going self employed.    However...  That in of itself is a whole different ballgame. 

So far after 2yrs of being self employed I have come to the realization that my clients are shitbags, sometimes too.  One client thinks IT is an expense, not a cost multiplier. 

As in IT and computers is only a sinkhole.   Not realizing that IT is what keeps their business operating.  If not... Then no CC payments, no databases or working infrastructure to which they hardly comprehend the technicals of. 

In November (2018) one client of mine had a realization that without a office manager, their employees did no work.  And the company was in the red. 

IT had to get paid a month late, but the owners had no problem on going on a two week vacation  while the employees of the company got a two week unexpected store closure. 

There are good clients too... One build a second office, took a whole year to do it, specifically so the original office would stay operating.   Once all was built, everyone got new office equipment and bonuses.  The owners. Enjoyed helping the contractors build the place.  Took it as a reduced cost with buying the contractors the specialized tools to build his business.  In the end, everyone got bonuses in one way or another.   IT, just got a bigger contract. 


As for the first story I told.  That owner fired all his employees and eventually paid up his IT.  Hired new employees and now has his son works as a office manager.

I've seen some sore eye situations where the moving of a network closet.   I had a client where we decided where we wanted the network closet to go.  But since the client made it clear he wasn't 100% on the decision I ended up leaving over 15ft of Ethernet cable runs above the ceiling. 

Sure enough the network closet was relocated to the other side of the wall.  Had only 3ft of slack left over after the move.  Otherwise over 300 splices or just outright forcing the client to pay for 300 cable drops all over again due to certification requirements. 

The client was glad I had left so much slack.  He and his contractors couldn't believe how heavy Ethernet can get when you have bundles of them to move.

  The pay has been marginalized.  I got into the ""IT"" industry back in 1996, back then it was foretold that after certifying and/or obtaining a degree, all jobs would be $60 \~ 150k a year.   Whelp by 1999, ""cert mills"" made the entry level jobs competitive. So experience was necessary, however without a degree or the appropriate certs, you needed a job to obtain the experience.   


 The pay stunted.  The economy changed, one can't just settle into the job and expect to promote/raise up the ranks anymore.   That lesson was learned through Radio Shack.  (for a small time I dealt with Retail Electronics Sales), what uses to be policy turned into ""Only Managers are hired from outside firms"".    One had to move company to company in order to maintain competitive income pay.

Our clients are niche market, so most of the problem solving can be eventually be automated.  I deal with the business itself, and when I have the free time...

I just helped one of my clients navigate their WordPress website from Managed WordPress , to their own Web Hosting, this involved Workspaces mailboxes being transferred to the new Web Hosting package the client purchased (upgrading to) and setting up and changing DNS settings and Mailboxes.

The process was horrible, but it wasn't directly GoDaddy's fault, we just happen to had a directed malware/hacking going towards the client's primary domain. It was because GoDaddy support, first line teams, seemed to always be useless and would point to paying for premium services (even though my client already paid for it), if we did get someone useful, they would spend an hour or two trying to pitch for upgraded services, while telling us they fixed/resolved the problem...  while we still didn't see our website come back online.   The issue was, first line typically don't go beyond their script, they will usually escalate with the next level team with a chat/shared session.   The next team, will usually be Admin enough to reset the database server.    As my client upgraded to having their own Hosting/cPanel, we were able to start reviewing logs, and continue to access our database server to see what was causing our WP site to go offline (database inaccessible) 

skipped reading - for OP - below

In your situation,  You have a few options.   If you happen to have a second domain to work with, then I would within the GoDaddy Dashboard (its what I call it), outside of the cPanel is where you are going to manage your domain name changes.   From outside of the cPanel (if you have your domains registered through GoDaddy) you will be able to redirect your domain for your WP installation.

What I did, and needed some help from Godaddy was through the constand ""Pending"" changes that seemed to never finish, even after a few days of waiting.  So each time I kept trying to change the domain of our primary WP install, we couldn't.   Ended up needed GoDaddy support to unlock the pending.  What happened next, was the WP install was now pointed to a temp landing address ""[somethingFTPish.server.com](https://somethingFTPish.server.com)"", From the GD Dashboard, if you are lucky, these domain name changes actually complete.

Next step we did, was to point the domain to the ""Web Hosting"" package that provides the cPanel.  From here, you can point the domain to your Hosting package.   I truly suggest once you get that part done, then you are best off using the ""softalicious"" installer, to install a clean copy of WP in the cPanel portion of your Hosting.  At this point, your cPanel should have the domain associated to it, so you are good to go with a clean WP install.  I used a few tools ahead of time to copy my clients ""Managed WP"" install over to their Hosted package.  The process was seamless.  Find your Migration tool, and let it backup and restore your WP site in one go.   There are other methods, and some involved manually copying your WP files from FTP to FTP, and export/import your database to the new database server. (MyPHPAdmin)

If you use a plugin to do the migration, it will more than likely succeed on first try.  (unless there is a size limit then a paid license to the said migration plugin will then help)   For my client, we had a 2GB backup, and with the Unlimited Extension for the Migration Plugin, that allowed us to migrate larger WP sites.

edit: in total we made 7 calls to GoDaddy support.   Mostly due to Inaccessible Database issues (which was due to a directed attack), but three times we called GoDaddy to help complete the pending processes that seemed to never complete.   One call was for helping GoDaddy to see the attack live, going towards our domain.   After we resolved that problem our primary domain was accessible.  Our remaining WP installs (originals) were then assigned the other domains, and we never saw problems with those any longer.    


For the client, they had multiple domains, but it always seemed that their primary domain was under attack, our database would reach a limit and become inaccessible, a rogue process querying a non-database specific query.  eventually it would loop so fast, we couldn't kill it."

showit is NOT going to be integrated into your WordPress backend(dashboard). You need to double check your documentation with your developer and ensure your agreement said your site was to be a complete WordPress site.  Otherwise your developer just pulled a fast one on you. 

I have a client that is a for-profit business and they paid their developer for essentially the same problem.  Contract stated the developer would design the site using a sitebuilder, then integrate the design into a WordPress site.  Sadly what the client didn't have in the details was that the design was to be a theme/template for WordPress.  Instead a frontend (html5) showit would be made for most of the site and WordPress would be used to manage only the blog section of the site. 

Fundamentally this prevents the owner of the site from updating the home page and various other pages that would need changing/updating often. 

My job is the Administrative end of the client's website.  I manage the hosting and technicals. And sadly I was brought on after the ""fact"", so once I came aboard my client was mad already that what they thought they were going 5o be able to do, won't be possible.  The site has to be redesigned.  

 My job now is managing the next developer who hopefully will be able to make a WordPress template/theme that will match the existing design.  The owner is pissed. This doubled his expected costs. 

 I do see a way we can take the existing content and make pages within WordPress that can be designed the same way the showit design is done. Just requires more time and someone to do it.  Thus the added costs.  

OP, sadly I bet your org, half asses the getting process and possibly the documentation.  If you can, make sure the web hosting is in order. Sometimes the developer does all their work locally and saves/uploads the end results.   And some developers perform all their work on the host.  You might have the development work saved to help make transferring content into WordPress.  

Really depends on how your ex-developer did their work."

Same deal here, only bought them when Steam was clear about discontinuing the unit.     So I ordered one, and about two days later went ahead and ordered a second.    It was about four days after that, did I think about ordering more, but by that time, I figured there wouldn't be any more.      


I apparently lucked out, and was able to get both my Steam Controllers,  many people complained that they received refund emails, and no indication as to why.  (whelp I can think of those eBay resellers, and people who bought using multiple accounts to hoard them).  To me, I'm just glad I got my two.   


As for their uses. I think these controllers are ahead of the game.  Accel/Gyro capability, along with the design functionality of the paddles.   It's a wheel, it's a joystick, it's a flight controller, it can be just about anything, programmed.   

  The Steam Community over the past two years have created so many Controller Profiles, it's amazing that I can just download the profile to classic games like System Shock 2.    There are cult groups alive and well that help maintain 20yr old games, and Steam makes it available to play on a Steam Link and TV.  

  The $5 sale, was worth paying the $12 S&H price.   I tend to take good care of my controllers.  Still have a SaiTek X-52.   Knowing that a new Steam Controller is on the way, just means, lessoned learned with the first design, will possibly make the controller smaller in size. (which would be awesome for small handed people.... not Trump)"
webhosting,fc6a719,t3_eg74tc,1577475830.0,"GoDaddy is exactly this OP so BH isn't the only one.  Customer service or ""support"" for these companies is never the top line, we as clients ""customers"" we get the dumbest assholes for first line.   If you show any remotely capable intelligence these first line support people break.  I've had the unfortunate experience of watching my client keep upgrading their hosting. From basic managed wp, to developer managed wp, to having their own web hosting package.  So migrating their website three times at least.   GoDaddy support for each of our database connection problems always seemed like they had escalated within their support network for advance teams to troubleshoot but only temporarily resolve the DB connection problems each time. 

Whelp once we migrated to our own hosting, we had access to error logs.  This also gave me continued access to phpMyAdmin for checking on whats going on with the DB when the wp site went down. 

Whelp, turned out a route user/process kelp queries running to our db.  A few attempts at resolving it myself. I'd called GoDaddy to show and pin point the problem.   I did all the legwork, and I came across a support guy from Arizona. Oh he likes issues like mine. So for once I got a competent GoDaddy support agent.  He sees what I see and we end up squashing the rouge process. 

Determined it was an attack that specifically attacked our domain which was a cause of our DB connection issues.  It seemed that GoDaddy support didn't get to a point of competence until the client upgraded to paying Way too much.  Through trial and error and keeping the old managed hosting packages and having multiple domain names.  We were able to show how the attack specifically hit the one domain the client used most. 

But each damn time I contacted GoDaddy... The support agent would always pitch a ""must pay for"" services in order to resolve our problem.   Really pissed me off that if we did do so, would we have had the same experience, every step of the way through the upgrades/migration processes?  Would paid adv support have caught the DB connections issue and realized it was an attack directed at the domain and slipped through. 

Anywho.   OP, it seems every hosting company has shitty support. Once in awhile you'll encounter that ""diamond in the rough""."
TexasPolitics,fc2yexa,t3_efwsl4,1577377316.0,"Interesting.   I wonder if these financial aid departments will also follow the legally required rules in informing students of their rights.   They do not have to take these loans.  And that some of the schools they would take loans out for, are scams.  ITT Tech comes to mind.  As someone who graduated in 2005 from ITT it was certainly a kick to see the Student Loan Sunshine Act of 2005, which clarified that financial aid departments would sign students up for additional loans that were not needed.  And that these institutions had the punishment for creating additional loans students were unaware of.   

So..  since high school is such a well funded public educational institution, I am sure after each student is approved... That they will be given the books necessary to know their rights and be informed of the schools they are applying to have the tendency to look out for themselves versus the student."
