politics,ffjcf1n,t1_ffj6bxf,1579995356.0,True in part but here's a more sinister way to look at it. History is written by those who are in control.
politics,ffix7fm,t1_ffgcilx,1579984914.0,Why do you think that what about the left has made you believe that we are not the working class too?
facepalm,ffix51c,t1_ffiwhe1,1579984865.0,"Look I am done, at this point your just wasting my time, you prefer to be spoon fed and that's your choice. Your not even willing to listen to the possibility that your dear leader broke the law (something the G.A.O. confirmed) instead you want to bitch about the process. What was I even thinking, you support Donald Trump, the biggest joke of a president this country has ever had, laughable. Your party had its chance and they blew it out their ass, go back to the bottom of society where you came from. You didn't matter then and because your getting attention by being a moron doesn't mean you matter now."
facepalm,ffiwkpx,t1_ffiwhe1,1579984455.0,"*""Why did all these bombs drop the day after the house process closed?  Because those bombs were under review by the house and we're offered the  day after they were no longer under review which is also the day after  the house finished the process.""*"
PublicFreakout,ffiuj6t,t3_ethcns,1579983068.0,"And never, not once throughout that entire ordeal did she second guess herself, A for effort and T for nice try (where my hip hop heads)"
facepalm,ffiu7jf,t1_ffgr2a3,1579982834.0,"Get out a flavored condom because I'm about to blow your mind...so because I can't see your comment while I respond I remember the gist. Why are Dems requesting more witness, because THIS is the trial, and the place where witnesses are allowed only Trump is blocking everyone. Why did all these bombs drop the day after the house process closed? Because those bombs were under review by the house and we're offered the day after they were no longer under review which is also the day after the house finished the process. Now that I've answerd your questions I have a few for you, why the hell did any of that matter? It doesn't erase Trump's actions. If not for what HE did WE wouldn't even have this problem. Dust off your critical thinking skills because I'm assuming that you are an adult, so function like one."
sex,ffi1i7o,t3_etl5bq,1579962270.0,"Swallowing is way overrated, at this point in our 20 yr relationship I literally point and shoot in the direction of his face for shits and giggles."
PublicFreakout,ffhzabc,t3_etk489,1579960124.0,I got so nervous when I saw this instead of scrolling down to the comments my brain involuntarily (consciously at least) told my hand to close the entire app.
facepalm,ffhysno,t3_etopsu,1579959617.0,Fake ass comment. Republicans will literally do anything to keep power and work every angle to divide.
DIY,ffgxkzz,t3_etir0o,1579917649.0,"This happened to me and one day my neighbor was over and he used the bathroom (it was that door). He went to his house and came back with a small piece of wood, stuffed it in the hole and reinserted the screw. 1000% problem solved."
worldpolitics,ffgx7f8,t3_etaeuz,1579917359.0,"That's not freedom of speech, I would ask why nothing happens to stop this sort of thing but we all know the answer. Let that be any minority group and it would get shut down. These people were born at the top of the food chain in this country but nevertheless there they are bitching about minorities. Hey, if someone who just walked 1000 miles, has no place to live and doesn't know the language takes your job then you have bigger problems."
facepalm,ffgn9fs,t1_fffauf2,1579910197.0,Oh you got jokes now? For somebody who thinks they know so much you sure do have alot of questions.
aww,fffrlxp,t3_etavx9,1579890285.0,My dogs would eat it
politics,fffqxvi,t1_fffqmyd,1579889873.0,"At this point we pretty much are, let's keep it real very few Democrats are interested in hearing what they have say because we have made our minds up about who they are. What have you done to start remedying this situation besides making us look divided?"
politics,fffqa0a,t3_etalbv,1579889464.0,"For those bewildered by DT base support consider the following: You live in a small nothing ever happens part of the country which is with the exception of like 40 major cities pretty much the rest of the country. You and everyone around you is economically disadvantaged, you're politically unsophisticated because let's face it, you have no reason to be I mean HC didn't even bother visiting most of the  places DT did, so why would you have any political interest? One day this charlatan shows up promising to change your economic situation, bring new jobs, rid of those job stealing immigrants, put an end to the opiode crisis oh and by the way to stay updated on what this guy is doing watch FOX News. These people had nothing to lose and since DT hasn't (and likely will never) done jack shit they STILL have nothing to lose. Pair that with a continued diet of FAUX news only, constantly covering up DTs behaviour and painting pictures of Dems coming for their babies which is easy to believe because Dems hadn't given a shit about them before. FAUX news is relentless, talk show hosts are relentless, most Repubs don't even realize nearly all of these people aren't even journalists but instead are ""opinion reporters"" who have alot of skin in the game at this point, because again...these people are unsophisticated. And the last ingredient is the constant smack talking they get from never trumpers (including myself) and there you have yourself a good old fashioned forever Trumper."

politics,ffevgjm,t3_et244s,1579867260.0,Over these last few years I have developed an incredibly high sense of anxiety.
interestingasfuck,ffeuvqt,t3_et70ey,1579866570.0,Does anybody know why it's so fine?
facepalm,ffeg8nk,t1_ffeem52,1579846815.0,"Where? When did that happen,?"

TwoXChromosomes,ffcjmd4,t1_ffcea21,1579800860.0,"I disagree, if they really cared they would embrace other solutions like vasectomy. A woman can have 1 child a year, men have copious amounts of sperm and could literally father dozens of children every year"
TwoXChromosomes,ffcj1x1,t3_esi0c4,1579800518.0,"Don't worry people soon the ""protestors"" will be volunteering for the election so we won't be seeing much of them."
funny,ffc7421,t3_esshqb,1579793068.0,To bad there wasn't a way to compare how low our political standards have fallen as well.
TwoXChromosomes,ffc6r95,t3_esriej,1579792837.0,"He's so full of shit, he never fully embraces anything and what little laughable siding he does is enough for all those religious, self rightous, hypocrites. They're so focused on getting what they want and satisfying their self fulfilling agendas that they are blind to the closest thing this world has to an anti Christ. 100% a rant."
PoliticalDiscussion,ffbrjuo,t3_esfzgu,1579779953.0,"I don't give a damn what any Democrat can or cannot do, hell I'll vote for a Republican if it'll get this Bozo out of office. Literally ANYBODY is better than Trump."

instant_regret,ffbp4sr,t3_esm1my,1579776689.0,I went to London a few years back and someone did that to me within 40 min of my arrival. I learned that's a thing over there and not to walk so close to the street.
TwoXChromosomes,ffbp0gh,t1_ffbiw8l,1579776515.0,Where do you live? Because protesting IN the street will end your protest instantly where I live (CA). You need a permit for that. It's sidewalk protesting over here for the most part.
TwoXChromosomes,ffbow0l,t3_esi0c4,1579776335.0,"Ive been trolling the pro life protesters a few times a month for about a year. I made a sign that says ""SUPPORT NON SURGICAL VASECTOMY INSTEAD"", this sign is a 100% guarantee I will have the sidewalk that I am on all to myself. Which is why I strongly feel they are all full of shit and not looking for real solutions just control and pity parties."

One day (and that day will come) if you leave your kids you will HAVE to file for custody and then what are you gonna tell the court? ""She's been like this for years"", the courts going to question your parental judgement abilities and so will everyone else. I'm telling you, no excuses, you have to take them."

politics,ff88pst,t1_ff84xd0,1579669268.0,"Further, I don't see in anyway how that supports the point your trying to make. We both know Nunes is a POS and we both know Fresno can't get out of its own way by voting him in. The point I'm making is you can't just talk out of your ass, jump on the bandwagon, etc... You shouldn't say anything that your not prepared to back up with fact, clearly you were unprepared."

politics,ff5q6cr,t3_erkzq8,1579605697.0,No they don't. They do nothing to enlighten themselves and are perfectly content with being spoon-fed.
