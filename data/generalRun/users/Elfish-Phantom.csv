ABCDesis,ffswtua,t3_euwpt5,1580195710.0,The thing I noticed is that these people from India kind of have a chip on their shoulders and look down on people that aren't born in India. I speak Punjabi but because I am born in Canada my Punjabi is obviously different seeing as I also began speaking English at the same time. I get made fun of a lot and I also see this weird attitude from some people. The other thing I noticed is a lot of these people will change their names to an English name when they get here and it really is weird.
