ANormalDayInAmerica,ffhvf7e,t1_ffhs8kz,1579955716.0,"Do none of your banking apps support remote deposit? On the rare occasion I do have to deposit a check I just take a picture of it with my phone, and upload it through the banking app.

I hate checks for two reasons. The minor reason is they're an archaic throwback to a bygone age; completely superfluous. The much more important is that (at least in the states) you're required to have printed on them almost everything a person would need to steal your identity. Name, home address, bank account number. I've seen some that have a phone number, and driver's license number on them as well."
space,ffgueqi,t1_ffgt5yx,1579915322.0,"If I am floating around in space the last thing I want is to blend in with **anything**. Give me a chartreuse pattern with flashing lights, and some sort of emergency transmitter that broadcasts **FUCKING HELP ME** on all known frequencies if I get detached somehow."
space,ffgu8bz,t1_ffgt8pr,1579915191.0,It would be avoided by a better administration. This one ***loves*** them some authoritarian dictator vibe.

todayilearned,ffgidui,t1_ffgbj83,1579906926.0,"You're a better person than I. I'd use it to manipulate people in to doing stuff for me. Like giving me a Ferrari, just because they're in a good mood."

Nothing like spending the better part of a weekend building a PVP map for the editor to crash and take your data with it. I may not remember what the key combination for ""save"" was in the editor, but I'm sure if I fired up a copy I'd begin compulsively hitting it without thinking."
ANormalDayInAmerica,ffggdd9,t1_ffg81ns,1579905621.0,"That makes a lot of sense. I'd taken for granted the idea that anywhere people lived would have usable internet service. *If they can do in X, Y, and Z remote areas...* Then again, areas X, Y, and Z don't suffer from entrenched telecommunications companies that want to keep collecting money without investing any of it in infrastructure."

ANormalDayInAmerica,ffg5ris,t1_fffvwpu,1579899049.0,"Crazy. Mobile & digital money management has transformed undeveloped, and remote areas. You'd think companies in Alaska would be comping at the bit to digitize & automate."
ANormalDayInAmerica,fffrav1,t1_ffflywf,1579890093.0,"The teller should fill out a CTR for anything above $10,000 in the US. This requires a few extra steps. Otherwise they shouldn't bat an eye, unless there's something obviously fake about the check."
ANormalDayInAmerica,fffr3ip,t1_fff9di6,1579889968.0,"I don't know why he didn't insist on a bank transfer. Checks have been almost completely replaced by legacy ACH processes, and digital currency. The only checks I write are for my Home Owners Association dues, and that's only because our treasurer doesn't want to pay the fees associated with mobile & digital payment services. He'd rather drive to the bank 4 times a year with a stack of checks."
todayilearned,fff0x5v,t1_fff0a7e,1579872627.0,"""We just go to Hell to regroup,"" is a fairly common sentiment. I've seen it on more than a few unit T-shirts."

On the ground, on military installations that are mostly pavement with nondescript beige buildings where desert and jungle camo patterns just sort of *blend in.* /s"
