What does this do for the public school? Leaves the same students who are performing poorly, now with less money to fund the school. That “backpack of money” works within a matrix and funds multiple facets of the school system, not just 1 individual child.

The kid with the involved parents (who is more than likely performing higher academically) is now in a charter school, and that money is being used to fund a much smaller school.

Homeless people aren’t just faceless degenerates. They’re people with issues, they’re someone’s family."
unpopularopinion,ferc5gc,t3_eq2knz,1579352276.0,Near our old apartment there was a homeless guy that would ride his trike collecting cans and such. Every so often my husband would give him money to ride to the store to buy a 6pk of beer to bring back and they would share it on our porch and chat. It was the most wholesome thing. Sammy wouldn’t ever take money or food aside from that though.

You know how many times I’ve almost been hit head on BECAUSE OF AN OLD PERSON DRIVING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD? The answer is more than 5."

EVE LOM Time Retreat Essence, it’s got a retinoid and Niacinamide in it I believe, and I don’t want it to interact with other things

Currently using AM

- warm water and witch hazel
- The Ordinary Niacinamide/HA
- Neutrogena hydroboost sunscreen

PM

- remove makeup with burts bees cleansing oil
- OG Neutrogena acne wash in shower (the orange one)
- witch hazel 
- rose water spritz
- the ordinary matrixyl on my forehead and eye area and the ordinary lactic acid on my lower face
- Korres Greek Yogurt Sleeping Facial 

Sometimes Dr Jarts Water Max Mask right before bed if I don’t fall asleep

I know it’s supposed to be an essence but it’s got an oily texture (that absorbs wonderfully but takes a few hours) so I’d prefer not to use it in the morning because I don’t want to try to layer makeup over it 

I’m wondering If the retinoid/Niacinamide concentration is low enough to use in the evening to not contradict the matrixl? Or if I can use them together? Also wondering if the lactic acid will just totally make it not work. Really wanna keep the LA it helps so much with my skin texture."

I have nothing to be unhappy about.

Job I love and am good at (although underpaid imo), beautiful, healthy smart daughter; supportive and hardworking husband; good friends; own my own home that’s sound, clean and attractive; not in a whole lot of debt other than my mortgage; in very good health and fit/thin, eat healthy and exercise regularly; look young for my age/attractive overall; able to vacation and pursue hobbies... 

But my fucking brain tells me I’m anxious and miserable every day and I don’t know how to change that."

2. The audacity to act superior to people with “abstract clerical jobs” that *gasp* support social programs is laughable here. I grew up with my dad climbing poles for GTE until he was laid off and he worked odd jobs to support our family. My husband’s father died of cancer after cleaning phosphorus tanks at a fertilizer plant for 20 years. We come from blue collar families and both worked minimum wage “physical” jobs ourselves - retail, construction, custodial, and both put ourselves through college to get our “abstract clerics jobs” - teacher and social worker - so we could promote the social programs you look down on. Because for some crazy fucking reason, we believe in helping other people, no matter their circumstance, to make the world a better place. We believe in contributing to society to educate people academically and emotionally. We know the value and difficulty of blue collar work, and we don’t piss all over it acting like what we do it more important, Like you seem to be doing, because you never figured out how to “work smarter not harder”.

Ps we have a mortgage, bills, kids, guns for home protection, and eat meat in moderation (because we don’t want to be walking fuckin heart attacks) but thankfully we don’t claim “fucking the environment” as part of our identity. Bet you’re proud of not recycling, aren’t you?"
BlackPeopleTwitter,feoqhnu,t1_feo478a,1579303985.0,Imagine stating “burning trash”and “not recycling” as part of your identity and shitting on people that support social services you’re somehow better than them. Lol
