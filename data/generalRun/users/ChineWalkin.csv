YouShouldKnow,ffh9qu1,t1_fffq391,1579927234.0,"I have an engineering degree, back ~2008 I had 5 competing offers, I had 6 interviews. Ive always wondered how people struggle to find a Job. 

My tips are these:

1. Face to face, or network. 

For everyone I apply with, my resume is sent straight to the person involved with the hiring, or my networked contact that has an ""in."" If they say ""go submit it to our websight,"" I don't waste my time. If they dont have time to talk with me and take my resume on a personal level, then I dont have time with them. 

2. They need you, the interviewee. 

Remember, they need you. Don't seem needy, its a turnoff. 

3. Remember, an interview goes both ways. 

YOU are interviewing them AS MUCH as they are interviewing you. You don't want to be somewhere you don't fit. I've left interviews and never contacted them again. Just wasn't a fit.

4. know what you want

Know what you want to do, find out who does it, then make that conpany know you want to work for THEM.  

5. Follow up

If you dont get the job follow up, in person if possible, and ask them what you need to do to be more competitive. I did this once, it was a bit awkward for the hiring manager. He informed me that the guy they hired had some qualifications that were superb. Honestly I couldn't compete with the other guy. I straight up told him that I would have hired the other guy too, and they made the right decision, which relaxed the awkwardness a bit, then we had a nice chat. A couple of weeks later, another position came open and they offered me the job. They didn't post it, didn't do another interview, just straight up offered it to me. I think following up played a role in getting hired, and took ""I'm serious about this"" to the next level.

They didn't use that terminology because that isn't what the meant for it to say. They were careful about their words. If you go back and study what the founding fathers meant, the Second Amendment preserves the right to protect oneself and our country from all enemies both foreign, and domestic.

""Gun death rate"" = red flag for including sucides. Thats a disingenuous representation at best, IMHO. Also, that site is *very biased.* When you look at the correlation of non-sucide intentional non-justified homicides to gun laws, the correlation sucks, at best. 

~2/3 of firearms deaths are sucide. About 80% of the non-sucide intentional non-justified homicides are gang or drug related. More people are killed evey year by hands and fists than rifles of *any type.*"

Maybe, we need more fishing boat deaths in america to stabilize our families!

Or, how about this one... US spending on space science and technology causes sucides by hanging strangulation and suffocation. 

Obviously, those are [spurious correlations.](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations).  We look at these and go, ""yeah right, whatever."" But when there is a correlation based on guns, they are take as the defacto gospel. Sure, the gun homicide rates are lower in Ca, right? *No, not so fast.*

Those numbers you look at for homicide rates, they include sucided (usually). The area with the worst firearm murder rate is DC, do you know how asinine DCs laws are? 

So lets put Ca on a pedestal. Who is better than Ca for *firearms murders?* [Alabama, Alaska Arkansas, Kentucky, Indiana, North Carolina, and Texas, to name a few.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm_death_rates_in_the_United_States_by_state); those states have some of the laxest gun laws in the country. 

What is a data based predictor of violent crime rates is the gini index. The theory goes that wealth inequality is the driving factor in crime. It actually predicts crime rates well.  

Here is what the world bank has to say about it:

>[Crime rates and inequality are positively correlated within countries and, particularly, between countries, and this correlation reflects causation from inequality to crime rates, even after controlling for other crime determinants.](https://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/Crime%2526Inequality.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjZvZTj7ZjnAhUPAZ0JHczQCMMQFjAFegQIAhAB&usg=AOvVaw2-pmgHjFkg29pW_SLrpigm&cshid=1579755093785)

An article from pubmed:

>[Policies addressing the gap between the rich and the poor deserve further considerations for reducing firearm homicide rates. Incorporating income inequality to refine measures of socioeconomic position may advance public health and clinical research and practice for firearm violence prevention.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/30782593/)

Here's the thing, I dont care about firearm murders, I care about intentional homicide - all of it. And the way I see it is that any law that is passed that inhibits me from bearing arms is unconstitutional and doesn't get at the root of the problem. To get at the root of the problem, we need to focus on the socioeconomic factors that drive people to commiting violent crimes, not just gun related murder. 

The problem is this, the people most likely to fix the gun problem are Democrats, not because they will ban guns, but in theory they'd be better positioned to fix the wealth gap. But the pro 2A camp would never back dems because they wont get off of thier unconstitutional anti-2A high horse. 

So we devide politics by pro-2A and anti-2A, and never address the problem."
HongKongProtest,ffaasde,t1_ff8yfiv,1579731244.0,">The only guns confiscated would be from those seen unfit to own them, I.e people with a potentially dangerous mental illness that are at risk of committing homocide if they somehow have guns

Most states prohibit thosevwho have been involuntarily committed from owning firearms. Those that have ""an issue"" but havent been conmited, should not have their 2A rights taken without a trial. The 5A protects the 2A:

>...nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;

The 4A may allow for it, but the person identifying them as a threat would have to identify themselves, or it would have to be corroborated with other info, IMHO:

>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

Someone saying, ""he's scary, take his guns,"" is not reasonable per the 4S, IMHO, but is an abuse that is possible with ""red flag"" laws. 


Also - I, like others, would be dissuaded to get mental health help if I thought I would loose my rights like a criminal. 

The rest of your points I'll have to address later if I can get to them. But I do have some data-backed rebuttals."
HongKongProtest,ff8up5l,t1_ff89tft,1579696722.0,">registration needed.

That's step one in confiscation. 

I hink it was Stanford/Harvard/UCLA or the like did an analysis of Ca a while back and determined that all the gun laws in Ca have done essentially nothing. Now balance that with the fact that guns are used defensivly more often than not and logic says increased gun laws may (or are likely to) be counterproductive. Besides that, they infringe on my right to bear arms. 

Also, you have places like Va trying to ban training. If the anti 2A lobby wants safe gun use, WHY DO THEY OUTLAW TRAINING? They don't want safe gun use, they want a gun free American."

Oh, and what about the Kalthoff repeater? it could do 50 rnds/min. It was invented circa 17th century. 

Your arguement isn't right, the writers intended for us to have millitary arms, whatever they were. 

You're right, the constitution can be changed, but wrt the 2A, it hasn't changed. Therefore it should be enforced as written; the people have the right to bear arms. 

Also, and research backs this statement up, Switzerland is different than the US socially, and economically, which likely drives the homicide difference. 

>With this system of every gun and bullet in that country registered and checked and every owner registered, certified and trained there would be a sharp, sharp decline in gun violence

Also, who cares. I don't want to see an end to gun violence, I want to see an end to murder. Taking away guns isn't going to stop murder. There's a solid debate to be had that would say taking away guns might even drive murder rates higher. especially since guns are used defensivly more often than not (per CDC)."
