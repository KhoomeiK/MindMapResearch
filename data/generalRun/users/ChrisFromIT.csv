The reason why vaccines aren't approved for infants under 6 months old is because it is the understanding that they haven't had their immune systems developed enough to be able to effectively use the vaccine to build up their immunity for what the vaccine is for. So it is a waste of a dose of vaccine.

However there have been a few studies on infants as young as 6 weeks that have found that they are able to develop antibodies to the strains of flu that are covered by the vaccine given to them. [Here is one such study.](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=113200)"

nvidia,ff5jjrv,t3_erj0ew,1579595868.0,"Its complicated. The thing is, how chip designs work is that you have the overall process agnostic design. Once you have that, you then select a process and have to tool your design for the given process. That design is then used to create the masks for the manufacturing process, etc.

So for instance, I can't use the same Masks from a chip in TSMC'S 16nm in Samsung's 14nm even tho they are comparable in most of their specs. I also can't use the same mask in TSMC'S 7nm process. Because of that, I also can't use the same design, since the manufacturing process also affects the design of chip.

So when you do a die shrink, you have to tweak the design to fit the process. This is a costly endeavor since you have to do tape outs, you have to test the tape outs, fix any flaws, etc.

Because of all that, it is unlikely we will see Turing or Pascal on 7nm. The MX350 isn't on TSMC'S 12nm which was what Turing was on. But don't worry, there will be budget cards in the next generation architecture of Nvidia GPUs that will be on a 7nm process."

Sorry to say but their self driving tech is very poor, specially when you compare it to other self driving tech.

In my opinion and in the opinion of quite a lot of experts in the field believe that the approach that Elon is taking is the wrong route to take. The main issue I have with his approach is that Tesla has gone the route of relying mostly on computer vision when it comes down to its self driving tech. Then there is the fact that he is rushing the team to the point they release buggy and poor implementations for the solution they are trying to solve. For example, the summon feature, all it is, is creating a map of edges around the car and using GPS to navigate that map of edges to the GPS location of the summoner. This has caused accidents and dangerous situations.

Then there is the issue I have of him deciding to use a inhouse developed processing hardware for their self driving tech. With the reason given was due to Nvidia not having enough processing power, which wasn't the case if Tesla had decide to use Nvidia's latest chipset for self driving cars at the time as they were using the previous generation. Overall this move most likely won't save much money in the long run. If I was Elon, I would have stuck with the Nvidia self driving car kit and done research and development to make in house LIDAR and do it cheaply.

Canada: aha, we will do it by force.

Iraq: Nooooooo


And before you forget, Canada was not part of the War in Iraq, we only went into Iraq when they invited NATO to train their troops."
worldnews,fdjo9zr,t1_fdjnm3j,1578480599.0,"So what you have to understand there are two terms, proven reserves and estimated reserves. Proven reserves are oil deposits that have been found and are economically feasible to extract. Estimated reserves include both oil deposits that are found but not yet economically or technically feasible to retrieve and oil deposits that haven't been found but are likely to be there based on geology of the area. Most of the time when you talk about oil reserves, you talk about proven oil reserves.

As I mentioned, the Canadian oil sands is estimated to have 2 trillion barrels of oil. Right now about 10-20% of it is economically feasible to extract and technologically possibly to extract.

One major reason why Venezuela has a higher proven oil reserve is because its oil sand is not landlocked and has easy access to the ocean for trade. The Canadian oil sands are landlocked and are traded at 70-80% the global market index."

worldnews,fdjmmcr,t1_fdjm03r,1578478214.0,"It actually is easy to extract and new technology is making it easier. The issue is getting it to market. Because of that, it is sold for less than market value. For instance, oil in the middle east can be extracted for as low as $10 a barrel, oil sands in Canada, it costs $30 a barrel, roughly same cost as the Venezuelan oil. But because it is not land locked, they are able to sell the oil at market value."
worldnews,fdjjcl1,t1_fdjj73j,1578473500.0,"It actually doesn't. It is estimated that there are 3 trillion barrels of oil from oil sands around the world. Canada is estimated to have 2 trillion of that with Venezuela having 1 trillion.

Currently with the way the world market is and Venezuela not being landlocked, it is more economically feasible to get that oil from their oil sands right now."

So from my experience, it sounds like you might have torn or stretched the ligaments in your SI joint/hips. What the rest of your back muscles are doing are trying to compensate for those loose ligaments. You could talk to your doctor or physiotherapist about prolotherapy and see if they might recommend it instead of the surgery."
worldnews,fdje6pp,t1_fdjbndn,1578467087.0,"I'll let you in on a little secret. Canada actually has the largest amount of oil reserves in the world. The Canadian oil sands alone have an estimated 2 trillion barrels of oil.

Interesting fact is that the shale oil fields in Montana and North Dakota are from the same formation as the Canadian oil sands. It is unknown how much shale oil is in that formation is in Canada. It could potentially be double or triple the amount that the US alone has."

As a software engineer, this laptop would actually be potentially good. As you can have the physical keyboard and have room for an app bar on the bottom screen that can be filled with a bunch of macros. It certainly would help cutdown on the amount of keyboard shortcuts I would have to remember."
