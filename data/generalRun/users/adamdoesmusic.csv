Most routers use either a standard 5v or 12v adapter that can work with a variety of brands and even completely different devices. 


Basically all of these things already follow some form of standard.

I'm dealing with RMAs now for a product we designed years ago to have micro USB specifically for the ubiquity requirement (usb-c just wasn't common enough yet) and basically all of the repairs deal with broken USB! 

The other side to this argument is what we had to go through before standardization. I was describing to another person in a different thread how you'd have to go find the charger AISLE and pick out not only the brand but specific model of your device to get a charger, and how you goddamn well better never lose your camera's proprietary cord or you're screwed and might as well get another camera!"

If you had, your next step would have been venturing to the store where an entire literal aisle of various chargers and converters awaited you, each for a different model of phone. Nokia alone had at least 6 entirely non-interchangeable charging standards. 

Another part of this mess that people don't remember is that camera and device companies would do the same things with their transfer cables and make them extremely expensive/inaccessible to replace, rendering the device and its non-removable memory useless.

 I've still got a box with over a dozen random USB cables with funny ends on them from that era. I have no idea what devices they went to, but I've got a few old devices which require proprietary cables - and it seems most of the ones I have don't fit those devices!

With USB-C, a lot of features are optional. There are provisions for analog audio, digital audio, dedicated video, and a number of other features which require relatively specific hardware at either end to take advantage of, and that hardware isn't the cheapest in my experience (Project lead for a USBC based device). A lot of phones, for instance, aren't including an ADC and simply pipe a digital audio stream out of the USBC for digital headphones, so you won't get that analog line.

I know that there are theoretical advantages, and that I'll get over the relative inconvenience eventually, but the connector they had wasn't that bad, and they didn't adequately replace lost features such as direct audio I/O or charging and wired listening at the same time."
