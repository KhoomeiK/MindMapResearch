I won't pretend to know, but I can say with certainty that law enforcement officers are held far more accountable today compared to the 1980s. And WAAAY better compared to the 1950s and 1960s.

I'm assuming work with domestic violence victims in some capacity?

Your perspective will definitely be different than mine. I'm a police officer. I've been out of patrol for awhile, but I worked TONS of domestics in my time. In my experience (basically when one party or witness has called 911) the verbal abuse is almost always mutual. I definitely encountered some women who were being abused and felt trapped, but that wasn't the normal domestic call. They were typically frequent fliers that would constantly call police on each other. Today's victim was tomorrow's abuser, and then back to victim on another day. I say ""just"" yelling because in my experience the yelling is almost always a mutual shouting match in which no one is right. Determining the primary aggressor for a particular incident was sometimes pretty tricky."

Kind of. He left his car while still relaying information. It wasn't until the 911 operator realized that he was following Martin that she said ""we don't need you to do that."" Zimmerman claims that he stopped at that point and started walking back towards his vehicle, away from the direction that Martin went. If you check the 911 tape against a map of the complex, he seems to be telling the truth. He had to backtrack to get to the location that the shooting occurred.

>Martin confronted him about following him and was murdered.

We'll never know why Martin confronted him, but it was a terrible idea. He backtracked away from his dad's house and confronted Zimmerman. Zimmerman claims that Martin attacked him and began banging his head against the concrete. Eye witness statements and physical injuries to both of them support this claim. If that is all true, then Zimmerman acted in self defense.

I'm not claiming to know who said what or did what when they made contact, but I don't see any way to disprove what Zimmerman is claiming.

>Zimmerman signs bags of skittles for people and auctioned off the gun he used. He's an utter piece of shit who literally got away with murder and is profiting off it.

Zimmerman is an absolute piece of shit for this and many other reasons. I'm not defending Zimmerman or Martin, I'm just trying to make objective observations.

The standard really isn't all that different. If you're not engaging in any unlawful acts and you have a reasonable perception of a threat, then deadly force is typically justified. 

Look at George Zimmerman. They weren't even going to charge him until the media made a big deal about it, and he was still acquitted.

>but that shouldn't mean they have the right to use it because they ""feel threatened"" or whatever, they should have to meet the exact same bar as anyone else. 

That's the same standard for everyone. There needs to be a reasonable perception of a threat to their life. 

If you don't ""feel threatened"" then you don't need to be using a firearm to defend yourself. But that perception of a threat needs to be reasonable. This applies to everyone. Cops don't just say the magic words and then they're instantly exonerated. If that were the case, then no cop would ever be convicted for shooting someone, and we've seen plenty of examples of that happening.

>Oh you shot someone cuz you ""felt threatened"" or whatever? Well evidence shows your life wasn't in danger so now you are in jail for FUCKING MURDER.

So if their life wasn't ACTUALLY in danger, then it's automatically murder?

You're saying that if someone points an unloaded gun at you and says ""I'm going to kill you"" and you respond by shooting them because you don't know the gun is unloaded.....you just murdered someone. 

The perception of the threat has to be reasonable. There is a shitload of case law establishing what that means.

Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fek7psq,t1_fejrw2u,1579194350.0,">Cops use guns even when a threat is not serious

Which is already illegal. If you feel like the law is not being applied, a new law isn't going to change that.

Think of it this way.....if the posted speed limit on your street is 35mph, but people routinely drive 50mph anyways, will lowering the speed limit to 25mph solve the problem?

>But cops can also try to make a non fatal shot and have paramedics come right away. 

You don't shoot someone ""just a little"" and then have them get patched up. If you shoot someone, then you need to be justified in taking their life. Period. And if you're justified in taking their life, there is an immediate threat that must be stopped as quickly as possible. 

>Will some people die? Of course. But much less people will die. 

And those people that died should not be dead. Because they were obviously not an imminent threat since the cop was only trying to wound them. 

>Shooting someone in a nonfatal area can and usually will stop a threat.

What are you talking about? What are you even basing this on? How it works in the movies?

Wounding people doesn't instantly incapacitate them like you see on TV. Hell, sometimes people don't even realize right away that they've been shot. 

If someone is pulling a gun on you, what is the non-fatal target that you're going to shoot to stop them? The arm? The leg? Why do you think that would stop someone from shooting you?"
Showerthoughts,fek43j1,t1_fejtcbk,1579192186.0,">Yes they did? That’s what the original comment ITT is: 

>There should really be a 2:1 ratio of women’s to men’s bathrooms in any given public building, due to women’s different needs and the fact they typically need more time. 

No one is saying that men don't need privacy. They're saying that women will typically take longer in the restroom than men, and that's why women's restrooms are often overcrowded while men's may not be. 

>I‘m saying it’s excluding most identities, not most people. Even if everyone in the US were a woman except two people who are different genders, that would be excluding two-thirds of all gender identities. That’s an extreme hypothetical example, but I think it illustrates my point...

It is an extreme hypothetical, but I think it also illustrates my point. Should EVERY facility or business in the country that is open to the public be required to build restrooms to accommodate two people?

Many businesses have two restrooms that can accommodate multiple people at once. For a small business, it could be a serious financial burden to require them to renovate and build one or more additional restrooms.

Obviously this isn't a concern for every business, but not every business is owned by some mega corporation. 

>I’d be willing to bet that more than 50% of the US population identify as a woman. 

>... so what? You’re back to this idea that just because there are more of one group, other groups should be discounted? 

Meeting a need for one group according to volume is not discounting another group.

A (slight) majority of people in this country identify as a woman. Women typically take longer in the restroom than men do, thus there is more often a wait. Aliviating this wait time by providing more restrooms is not disenfranchising anyone. 

I feel like you keep attacking points that no one is making. 

>Offer nongendered bathrooms and additional private “family” bathrooms for those who have more specific privacy needs. 

That's a great option that should be considered by businesses that are able to provide it.

>Bathrooms need not be connected to gender, and it’s weird that they are...

I couldn't care less for myself, but plenty of women would be very uncomfortable having a man in the restroom. I'm not going to tell them that they need to feel differently."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fek2kh2,t1_fejx7pp,1579191260.0,">Are you saying that a police should have the right to shoot to kill because they are scared? 

No. People get so hung up on the words ""I feared for my life"" that they think it's some kind of magical phrase that let's you get away with murder. If that were the case, you'd never see a cop get convicted. And you DO see cops getting convicted for bad shoots.

They say ""I feared for my life"" because if they DIDN'T fear for their life, then they should not have used deadly force. You can replace ""I feared for my life"" with ""I had a reasonable perception of a threat to my life."" It means the same thing in this context. 

There's a ton of case law to pull from to determine what the courts will see as a reasonable perception. Is it reasonable to believe that someone reaching into their pocket while paying for a meal is a deadly threat? Obviously not. Is it reasonable to believe that someone reaching into their pocket and saying ""I'm gonna fucking shoot you!"" is a deadly threat? Oftentimes yes. Same action (reaching into a pocket) but different context.

>Who has that right?! I sure as hell don't. 

Yeah no one does. 

>Look, pal. There are many more cases of trigger happy police pulling guns on unarmed victims then mistaken objects for weapons.

Is there? What are you basing this on?

>And many times they are looking for a reason to shoot a person.

No, they're really not. It's stressful as fuck for a cop when they're involved in a shooting, whether they get cleared or not. It's not fun.

>Let's turn that around so that they are a little less likely about killing people. 

>Shit. It's sad I even have to type that.

You didn't have to type that. You typed it because you want to believe that you had to type it."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fejs1n4,t1_fejpv33,1579184434.0,So then this act only applies if police shoot someone while their hands are up? Where does it specify that?
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fejr856,t1_fejpp8j,1579183832.0,"You don't shoot to wound. If a threat is serious enough that you need to use a firearm, then that threat must be stopped immediately. If that immediate need to stop the threat does not exist, then don't use a firearm. Guns kill people. You can shoot someone in the leg and they can bleed out in seconds."

Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fejp17z,t1_fejguzf,1579182108.0,"Where does the act say this? I haven't found any criteria outside of ""found to be unarmed"" after a shooting."
Showerthoughts,fejoxrw,t1_fejkgne,1579182029.0,">My point is not only that men have privacy needs just like women

No one said that they didn't. 

>but also that there aren’t just two genders, so doubling the number of bathrooms that exclude most gender identities is no bueno.

Using ""most"" in this context is a little disingenuous. I'd be willing to bet that more than 50% of the US population identify themselves as a woman. 

>It’s possible, simple even, to address the needs of women and men and NB folks.

What's the simple solution?"
