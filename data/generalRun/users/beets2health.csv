DesignHomeGame,ff7w7ti,t3_es5bpu,1579659828.0,I‚Äôd pay as much money as I used in this game entirely to get one area of my house to look this decent. It‚Äôs an unfortunate amount for a silly game that drives me insane.

YouOnLifetime,fcm5a2x,t3_ehmhv0,1577764595.0,"I really like all these idea for season 3. I do have one question though before I express my idea of how season three will turn out.. 
so at the end, joe is bringing groceries from the car and looks as though he‚Äôs taking it into the house........ BUT idk if anyone else thought the body language of Loves mother was super off, but so was love and joe since it looks like she‚Äôs waving hello and then goodbye. I couldn‚Äôt tell really if he lived with them now, or next door or near by? I am very curious about that.
As far as my guesses for S3, I think he will have to create a very fine line between his interest in the neighbor so Love, her crazy family, and their pi won‚Äôt catch on and get to this chick before he gets to know her. I think he‚Äôll want to protect her and be better for her like he was honestly trying for love, but it‚Äôll bite him in the ass later on from jealousy and the family/parents wanting to keep the baby as joe and loved main focus especially since their son died in some ‚Äúunknown‚Äù situation with joe."
