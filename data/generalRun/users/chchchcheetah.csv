Breath_of_the_Wild,ffht5ok,t1_ffhoj6g,1579952598.0,"I felt the same on the first fight, but the second round was a different story. I've only done the illusory realm trials in master mode but for those you've got limited weaponry so being able to knock him down by sending the blocks back makes it much more doable (or in my case, possible)."

PTschool,ffg37k2,t3_etdq9q,1579897481.0,"Tldr: Totally possible

Going into PT school people told me there's no way to work and go to school. In my opinion, you make time for what you need (obviously within reason). I work on campus up to 15 hrs/wk, but usually it's closer to 10. I have friends in the program working up to 20, on and off campus. Definitely easier to juggle second year, but first is doable if you manage your time well. It'll also depend on other factors like how much time you spend doing other stuff and what kind of spending lifestyle you lead. 
I still rely VERY heavily on loans. I don't make enough to fully cover monthly rent/utilities, but that will depend on your cost of living, hours, pay, etc.

I'd suggest on campus jobs since they tend to work with your schedule. Another option which a handful of students in my program do is part time caregiving in the community (our program often gets leads for this kind of thing since a lot need assistance with HEPs and stuff and we are all CPR certified and whatnot)"

HarryPotterBooks,ff900zd,t1_ff7d5o5,1579701349.0,"Exactly. Harry is her and her family's only way out of a scenario where, at best, they are mocked and treated like garbage forever by voldy and the death eaters, while also living in constant fear since they have likely proven that, to Voldemort, they are pretty expendable.

In a snap moment's decision, after seeing a mere boy survive his SECOND AK, it makes sense to me. She thought harry could win and saw it as her only way out of what was likely to be a pretty crappy life full of fear."
Breath_of_the_Wild,ff0jvsz,t1_ff078y8,1579469516.0,I think you can win it from shield surfing at Selmies place as well!
freefolk,ff05wq6,t1_feyh7fr,1579465543.0,"My roommate still can't shut up about how she's the biggest GoT fan (while also being like the most casual fan imo). She's rewatching it for the second time since S8 (which she loved) right now. If I didn't live with her I would think it was a much smaller minority.

At least she can find joy in it I guess...."
dating_advice,fezjoue,t1_feyjtr4,1579458039.0,Right! It's definitely something I would have been WAY more weary of haha
holdmyjuicebox,fewf0ta,t1_fevdbk4,1579409500.0,Ours too! At least it used to years ago when I worked the fair as a kid. But the arena was filled with mud. I worked at the bbq stand across from the mutton busting bleachers and would take my lunch over there. I remember one tiny kid falling off and getting so much mud stuck to the side of his head he couldn't hold the weight of it upright.
dating_advice,fewb2z9,t1_fetln9q,1579407799.0,"Real story. I have a friend who went camping with a guy she met briefly through a coworker and agreed to go camping for a weekend out in the boonies as their first date. They've been together 4 years. I'd be way sketched out, and she agrees that it was kind of crazy, but they seem pretty dang happy!

Granted I'm not saying meet a stranger and go camp in the middle of nowhere with them haha"

TheAdventureZone,fecc8gu,t1_febo6u0,1578970565.0,"Tangent here, but Jenkins existential voice crisis is probably the hardest I've laughed through all of TAZ. That and Clint misunderstanding ""impounded by the police"" as there being 5 police in kepler. Hit me just right, I'm laughing just thinking about it"

Usually wipes out the weaker guys and the stronger enemies are pretty well weakened. Is it a cheap move? Yes. Is it also fun? Yes!"
zelda,fdd7p14,t1_fdd4e9f,1578298521.0,"I'm gonna be honest, I never use stasis on enemies. I either forget or get super frazzled by the countdown chime and feeling rushed!

Unfortunately with the arrows I either suck at finding them or they stop actually appearing to be available to pick up pretty quickly from the couple times I've tried it (hope that makes sense)"
