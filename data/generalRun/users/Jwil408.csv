This is mitigated in this particular case by the fact the prequels are so incredibly unwatchable that you never really want to learn anything about the characters.

I've always personally maintained that the prequels were great stories on paper - lore-wise, plot-wise, character-wise - but somehow the actual execution to screen (particularly dialogue, and in some cases acting) just became a trainwreck."
writing,fecxqn5,t1_febxn8z,1578988902.0,"I am no fan of the prequels, and I think this is a great exercise generally, however I think that's pretty unfair.

One character is well intentioned, always believing the best of people, to a fault. Stubborn and hardheaded, he often gets in trouble with his superiors because he is following his heart. Even despite his experience, he maintains a reductive worldview that is somehow both wiser than others in its lack of pretension, yet simultaneously more naive.

One character shares the first character's stubbornness, but is almost the opposite in their worldview - they are overly cynical and prone to overthinking themselves and their place in the world, potentially borne from a lack of confidence in their abilities. They ride that strange border between early and middle adulthood where they know enough to think they know everything yet not enough to have accumulated the real wisdom of the first character. However, their pessimistic/cynical outlook tempers this so they can on the face of it seem more pragmatic than the other character, which masks a deeper insecurity and lack of understanding of themselves.

A third character hates sand. It's coarse, rough, irritating and it gets everywhere."

Is there a way to enter inputs into a pivot table, without putting them into the source data? Or is the output read only? 

The situation would be when you need outputs from a database, displayed a certain way, then you want to annotate them with comments etc but you want your annotations to follow that row/data when you rearrange the table.

Kind of like how it would on a filtered list. FML."
LifeProTips,fe55y6a,t1_fe4jzbu,1578865940.0,"It's not something the Jedi would teach you.

But seriously, it's not too bad. It helps if you've ever done any matrix theory in uni maths etc.

Basically it's two functions, the first (counterintuitively) being MATCH(variable to look up, in which 1D array, whether the match is exact, greater than or less than). This function returns the relative position of the variable in the array, eg in the array {apple, book, cat, dog} looking up ""book"" would return ""2"" - it's the second object in the array.

Index returns a number from an array based on relative position - technically the opposite of match. It looks like INDEX (array,row position, column position). Now if you had an array {4,5,6,7}, and you used your Match result from the first example as your column reference, you'd return ""5"" - the second number in the array.

This is basically the same operation as using vlookup to look for a variable within an array and return the cell adjacent - except with index match, the columns don't need to be adjacent. And if you use a match in both row and column inputs, you can return values from a 2D array. You can then start using really funky stuff, like the less than function in match to return the next-lowest value in a numeric range, etc).

Once you get the hang of them you'll never use a lookup again.

TLDR pretty sure if you asked Yoda what index match was he'd be like ""is that, what the fuck is?"""
