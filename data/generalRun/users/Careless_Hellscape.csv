rareinsults,fffdlga,t1_ffdu595,1579881625.0,I can't argue with that.

Ok, makes sense...if we're all speaking whackadoo language."

rareinsults,fffch5f,t1_ffep884,1579880922.0,It's like I was there. If I didn't know better I would think I was listening to a real Boomer.

FTMOver30,ffaix5g,t3_es9e1h,1579736842.0,I would love to read and participate in an AMA. I have always had questions.
lgbt,ffairkx,t1_ffahlep,1579736728.0,That is so incredibly rude.

lgbt,ffa791c,t3_esevwe,1579729247.0,"Did the officer look at your license or something? Because looking at you in the photo to the right, someone would have to have some nerve to assume that your gender was anything other than what it looks like, a woman. Cops are jerks sometimes, and this one was. You look fantastic."

vegan_travel,ff6zpcf,t3_ery5x9,1579638207.0,Portland is the place to do it. I used to work for a company up there and came across a lot of places that had vegan options. Here's a few in this list.

DeadBedrooms,ff6rt53,t1_ff6rio6,1579633545.0,I don't know why I'm here. I'm lost and looking for other people who are either here or have been here. This was a mistake.
egg_irl,ff6rfd7,t1_ff5qpfv,1579633314.0,It kinda does.
AskReddit,ff6rdp9,t1_ff6c16a,1579633286.0,"I guess I understand. Different strokes, but I imagine I would be into having an enthusiastic bottom if I was a top."
DeadBedrooms,ff6qxjk,t1_ff6ozi9,1579633019.0,Ok. I'm not going to leave or threaten to leave someone I love. I understand their point but it just isn't valid advice for my situation. So assuming nothing anyone says will matter is a bit of a leap. I already said it wasn't going to happen in my original post so I don't know why bringing it up is such solid advice.
DeadBedrooms,ff6kpup,t1_ff6dolv,1579629274.0,I get it.
DeadBedrooms,ff6dngt,t1_ff5h4b3,1579624922.0,"Right? It's not just the getting off part, I miss. If that were the case, masturbating would solve all my problems. And guilting our partners into it because they're scared not to do it or we'll leave is sickening. Like, I want it to be her choice and her desire that brings her back to me, not me hassling her."
DeadBedrooms,ff6ddka,t1_ff6cisl,1579624748.0,"Ok then, duly noted. Amazing."

AskReddit,ff5bl9m,t3_ermc1w,1579586311.0,"I try to comfort myself by thinking that the Multiverse is real and that in some neighboring universe, they're being ripped apart by hungry dogs as I fall asleep each night.

It doesn't really help, truth be told, but unless my life suddenly turns into a comic book where I accidentally develop some gnarly superpowers, there's nothing I can do. In the 1/1,000,000,000,000,000,000 chance that happens, I'm going to abuse that power so bad."

lgbt,ff5ac02,t3_erlauf,1579585078.0,"This guy is an utter fucking creep, and there is no way anyone can convince me otherwise. I would not be AT ALL surprised if he was guilty of railing several homeless men in public bathrooms, then secretly having them killed so that they didn't rat him out."
FTMOver30,ff5a489,t3_erpuxt,1579584869.0,"That's great news. I'm super envious. Not sure how to celebrate, because I don't get out much and don't know how to have fun. But general recovery: stay warm, stay hydrated, and make sure to get up and walk around a little every few hours. I would have thought laying still would be great, but when my wife had her hyster, they said blood clots were risky after surgeries, so movement was needed.  

Honestly, if it was me, I would celebrate by just looking in the mirror once in a while and being like, ""yes, these things are gone!"""
