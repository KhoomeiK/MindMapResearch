bapcsalescanada,ffelvzh,t3_et5ql1,1579853644.0,"I own this, got it when they had this sale near black Friday. 


Used mainly for DCS World, flown multiple 3-4 hour missions. Only issue is the loss of tracking looking behind me, but my basement is pretty dark even with the lights maxed. Otherwise I love using it. The default face cushion was horrible, I ordered a VR cover and it helped."
Showerthoughts,ffabgl0,t1_ffaam1y,1579731634.0,"Definitely agreed. I do fly 2D often though as I'm sometimes too lazy to pull my headset out and make sure my basement is lit. It is pretty dark with all the lights on so looking behind/below/above gets a little jittery as there aren't lots of objects to track. 



And also I get 38-45FPS in VR compared to 110ish in 2D."
Showerthoughts,ffab9k6,t1_ffaa2vu,1579731520.0,"Make sure it is the Odyssey+, that is the one that I have that has the filter."
Showerthoughts,ffa7ixd,t1_ffa38vs,1579729398.0,"I actually have the Gear VR as well. I use it quite frequently for Netflix and stuff like that, works quite well.


However the 1440p res on your phone is pretty low and makes a screen door effect. I use a Samsung Odyssey which has a filter that removes the screen door effect. Really helps with overall immersion, though the crispiness of test goes down a bit"
Showerthoughts,ff9siqs,t1_ff9jduc,1579720283.0,"I've got a powerful laptop with a decent VR headset. I fly a sim called DCS world in multiplayer, a modern air combat simulator. Flying 3-4 hour missions in VR is so surreal with your squad mates and enemies being so sizeable. The sense of scale is astounding. Your heart is pounding under a a stressful situation. Like landing in bad weather, or evading a missile. Fighting 1v1 is just an incredible experience. Or just flying over the ocean with the sun setting and your wingman just to your left. 



I love every minute of it."
Cameras,ff9e42p,t1_ff9dhz8,1579711033.0,"The 6K you can find simply by knowing the sensor is a 24MP, and knowing the aspect ratio. 


The 4.2k is just a calculated estimate by taking a little less than 80% of the total Resolution. 4.8k would sound more appropriate as it is 20% lower (6K x 0.8 = 4.8K). So I correct myself, it's 4.8K in 30FPS oversampled. 



That might not be accurate though as the scaling doesn't work linearly unless you know exactly how much of the sensor is being used."
Cameras,ff9byt8,t1_ff992es,1579709489.0,"It is a tiny bit lower but you won't notice unless you're really pixel peeping. 24fps is oversampled from 6K, whereas 30fps is about 4.2k"
Cameras,ff94x6x,t1_ff2vka6,1579704927.0,"I've got the A6400. The 4K 24p is Super 35 as it's a full sensor readout from the 6K sensor into a 4K file. 4K 30 fps though isn't super 35 as it crops in a bit (1.2x) and it isn't doing a full sensor readout, only a partial one. It can't read the full sensor fast enough for 30FPS so it's cropping a bit."
videography,ff1v160,t1_ff1mxl9,1579486806.0,"I've got a 6400. The Bitrate is pretty low, it looks really soft and there isn't enough data in it."
aviation,fewgfe9,t1_fevyx2p,1579410158.0,"Thanks for the confirmation! 


Love the username ;)"
aviation,feumv1r,t1_feuj22e,1579388015.0,"That's with the Super Hornet. I'm like 90% sure that the F-18 legacy ones (A-D) used burner on both cat shots and while touching down as I've seen it done before. The super hornet has more powerful engines. 


But I mean you are a naval aviator according to your comments and I'm just an enthusiast hoping to fly fighters some day."
GamingLaptops,fejv9p4,t1_fejqe8l,1579186652.0,Dual NVMe slots are uncommon. You're gonna find them in the Eluktronics MAG-15 which is a very lightweight and powerful laptop. It is above your price range though
