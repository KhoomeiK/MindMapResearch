psychology,ff3o9j7,t1_ff3e9s8,1579545309.0,It's totally a thing. Gaming offers an almost instant gratification that most other hobbies can't give. It's so much easier to just load up some games rather than drive 2 hours to a river with potentially catches :(

BuyItForLife,fehduz9,t1_fehdjov,1579114517.0,"I do! It's called [System App Remover](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jumobile.manager.systemapp&hl=en). This will actually uninstall the apps from your phone, but be careful. Of course you should do a backup just in case you need to do a hard reset. Additionally, in the app drawer and the settings for the apps that you still might not be able to uninstall, you can disable the app. Which stops it from activating/working at all. It won't be technically removed but it won't be running in the background either."

The skin that Samsung puts on Android removes the option to delete a lot of their stuff as well as any carrier specific apps. So that app just allowed me the option."
