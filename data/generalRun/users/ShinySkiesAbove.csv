Sparing her any more pain and being with her as she passes can be your final gifts, and help repay some of the love she sounds like she brought to your life. Wishing you strength and peace through the process."

The plan was to let them meet up once in a while but he had a change of heart apparently (I'll just leave it at that). I've just tried to keep my dog busy with lots of walks and trips to parks, but it has been very hard for both of us. Hang in there! Hopefully some good suggestions will be offered here by others."
dogs,fcj0mi9,t3_ehf4hk,1577674327.0,I'm so very sorry for all you've gone through. Wishing you strength and peace as you say goodbye to him with love tomorrow.
