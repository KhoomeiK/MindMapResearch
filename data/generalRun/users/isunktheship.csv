Then refused to give her information (violates the CA DMV handbook and is a crime when damages exceed $1k I believe) - police were called, 4 cops assisted, demanded she hand her information over or be arrested.

Real nice lady.

She was just roid raging after her 24/hr fitness session."

Amazon doesn't.. make widgets either.. they facilitate the SALES of widgets, the main things Amazon does sell are: Fire sticks, gift cards, server space

Amazon isn't breaking any tax laws - want them to pay more?  Change the laws.  This is such a silly complaint ""Amazon paid $0 in taxes"".  No, it's ""Amazon paid their taxes"".

Finally.. complaining that Bezos *only donated <x> to some cause*, yeah.. he didn't have to donate a dime.. and when the NEXT cause comes up, he'll likely keep donating.

Under AOC, businesses would not be for-profit, as anything beyond a co-op to her is UNETHICAL, what a joke from a woman who spent $200,000 attending one of the most prestigious universities in America.
