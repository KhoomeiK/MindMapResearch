xxfitness,fbah1k4,t3_ecapl5,1576677951.0,"The cold! I like to walk during lunch and usually get in about 2 miles. It’s too cold to do that now. I can go and walk on the treadmill at the gym near work, but then I have to change my clothes (sorry I have an issue with wearing street clothes on at the gym). It seems to take me forever and a day to change clothes which eats up walking time. Blahhhh.

Yeah I’m just venting, don’t mind me!"
