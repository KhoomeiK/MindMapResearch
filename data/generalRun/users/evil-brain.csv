Air is polluted not only by burning tobacco. But the smoke doesn't stay in one place, waiting for the allergic person working at the bar to head home and inhale it. That is why I said it is airborne and it is everywhere.

I don't tell anybody where to work (wtf?), just that it is not the best decision-making to choose to be a bartender if you are allergic towards cigarette smoke, exactly because people smoke outside (or even inside) the bar. Do you get the point now?"

You have to be confident. Not a single hint of shyness. No trembling voice, no staring at your feet. Go there like you know what you are doing.

The girl shouldn't be busy, like walking, talking or chatting on the phone, shopping etc. But wait, if she is skating around, it is a good starting point. So I think this is essential. Anyway I think in some cases even if she is busy it might work, depends on her. I wouldn't mind if while I am picking groceries someone help me with the choice, hypothetically. Still I think a bar is the best place.

Also last thing that come to my mind is that you gotta make her talk to you, not to go there and expect her to hold the conversation.

I don't know if this is what you expect as answer, but this is my point of view. That is how I would like to be approached, since I don't really see it as an inconvenience. And if I am not into the guy I would just cut him politely."
