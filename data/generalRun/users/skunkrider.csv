I've done a year of Crossfit, and while I LOVED it and want to start again, I've squatted my knees to death, and now I'm paying the (hopefully not permanent) price.

You do sports for health, conditioning and strength, but you lose weight by becoming aware of and controlling your calory intake.

Maybe register for a mudrun instead? You can make it a smaller total distance, and the distance will be split between obstacles of all sorts.

That will make you feel more alive than pure running can, I think :)

I wish I'd had this when I was young - instead, we didn't even have internet access.

Now, for the most important principles:

1. Get the app called MyFitnessPal
2. Enter your details
3. Tell it you want to lose a pound per week. Don't go higher than that, you're still growing, and you have *so much time*
4. It will suggest you a number of calories to eat per day.
5. If you're unsure whether you can stick to that number, don't worry: just count what you eat for now. Include everything. *Everything!*
6. Don't enter calories burnt through exercise. It doesn't work exactly like that, and you'll sabotage your efforts if you do and start thinking *""ohh I've burned 500kcal in the gym today, I can eat an extra burger!""*
7. Get a food scale. The app lets you barcode-scan many foods, but some won't have barcodes, and some is homemade, so find the stuff the food is made of in the app, weigh it, and enter it. 
7-1. The app's food database is vast, it even has fast-food in it, so log it all!
8. Weigh yourself repeatedly under similar conditions. For example, I weigh myself every morning, after a visit to the toilet. On some days I have to pee a lot, and on some, less, on some you don't need to pee at all. It doesn't matter, because over time only the trend counts!

When you don't eat anything salty for a couple of days, you'll notice major swings on the scale. That's because salt makes your body retain water - and water is heavy.

Speaking of water - try and get used to drinking at least 1.5 Liters (40-50 ounces?) per day. Even after 3 years with these habits, I still don't continuously drink, but just drink half a liter in one go, two to three times per day. Water helps with *everything*.

Long-term, try and become more active. Definitely incorporate something to build muscle, because muscle needs more energy (calories!) than fat, even when you are not super-active, which makes it easier not to gain weight.

Look for activities such as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Wrestling, Track and Field, Boxing, Thai-Boxing, Climbing, Bouldering, etc. etc. - it doesn't matter, as long as you're challenging your body, and which makes you go out and meet people.

Don't forget supple-ness and physical awareness! Yoga and Pilates may not sound spectacular, but your body will thank you oh-so-much!

Otherwise you'll just waste your body, and end up with bad joints/an accumulation of sports injuries by the time you're 30. Seems like that's far away now, but it isn't. I'm 36 now, and I feel like a 16-y.o. stuck in an old man's body.

Oh, and don't let your family be an excuse. Before you know it you'll move out anyway! Try and make good decisions every time. That will be the difference between you and the others.

That's all I can think of for now. Any questions - let me know."

My body's health started deteriorating, and I had checkups at doctors, several times. They complained about my blood pressure, amongst other things.

So in August 2017, with a SW of 117kg, I stopped smoking completely (for a while), discovered this sub, and started counting calories.

I moved to a bigger city, started doing Crossfit to gain muscle, got addicted to that, managed the dance on a knife edge that is a slight calory deficit while providing enough protein to sustain muscle growth, and within a year managed to reach 97.5kg, a weight I hadn't seen since I was 15.

Unfortunately, I completely overdid Crossfit, or at least didn't give my body time to adjust, and had to stop when my knee was becoming highly unstable

Turns out it was directly related to spraining the same ankle six times over the course of my life, but that took a while to figure out.

The fact that I had to stop working out depressed the hell out of me. You could (rightly) say that I could have continued working out, excluding any sort of leg work, but I wasn't up for it. I wanted the whole shebang. I gained 12kg in two months (110kg) before I got a hold of myself.

Now it's 14 months since I had to stop, I've had knee surgery, and I'm doing physiotherapy to improve knee stability and ankle mobility. I'm also counting my calories again.

On top of all of that, I am finally taking care of dental health. I will have jaw surgery 10 days from now, to expand my palate. I already have a device in my mouth which keeps me from eating chewy/crunchy stuff, and it really helps with CICO :)

Post-surgery, I won't be able to eat anything but liquid and soft food for a good while (could be 1-2 months before I can think about eating *chicken*...).

My current weight is 102kg, and I hope to be below 100kg by the time the worst of the recovery is behind me.

2020 is the year of no excuses for me!

Wish me luck! :)"

In regards to the second question, I've seen 3 to 18 (!) months, so it really depends on the individual."
KerbalSpaceProgram,fdz5jpw,t3_enbngt,1578786924.0,"The problem is that you're using a delta-wing, but also mini-elevons at the back.

Either move the delta-wing further forward and increase the elevons, or move the delta-wing further *back*, and remove the elevons, but place canards in the front."
jawsurgery,fdz426u,t3_enaeri,1578786425.0,"I don't know what you are going through, but my fingers are crossed that it'll get better soon 🤞🏻

Hang in there!

And don't hesitate bothering your jaw surgeon and/or orthodontist! Maybe they know about this, and know a way to help. Maybe they don't, and you're helping their future patients!"
jawsurgery,fdyvtih,t1_fdyr5g0,1578784075.0,"Not sure what to say.

We see only one picture, from the front, which shows the slightest of lower jaw displacement. We do not know what it looks like from the side, we do not know if he has an underbite or not.

That's why we are giving him advice to go talk to an expert - in this case, an orthodontist, because let's face it - we're all amateurs here.

Not sure what would make you get so riled up about this."
jawsurgery,fdyo01w,t1_fdyfaw5,1578781812.0,"An incorrect bite can and will create all sorts of issues later in life - from mere pain to chronic pain, to teeth breaking each other by grinding, to cramping/spasming jaw muscles, tenseness that shoots from the jaw through the neck and shoulders all the way into the back...

That's not even mentioning the inability to properly clean one's teeth. Cavities, destroyed enamel, etc.

Breathing issues, snoring, sleep apnoe ... do I need to go on?"
jawsurgery,fdxryat,t1_fdxlras,1578772297.0,"My advice has nothing to do with being attractive or not. It's all to do with whether it's a medically good idea, especially with the person's future in mind.

Health is more important than beauty."

Your gap isn't nearly as extreme as I've seen from other examples - count your blessings, I guess! :)

Have you tried taking an identical before/after picture, to compare what this has done to your face shape, or do you think it's too early due to residual swelling?"
soccer,fdxb29z,t1_fdww3jq,1578767050.0,"the first time it happened when I was 13, and fell down the stairs, maybe two meters/yards, and ""braked"" the fall with my ankle. I was living in Germany, where you're either publicly insured, or privately. The first time, I was privately insured.

I remember the nurse telling me that ""this time, you'll be fine with just a compression and lots of rest, but the next time this happens, you need to get surgery!""

The next time it happened, I was a couple of years older, and not privately insured anymore, so the nurse just put a thick bandage around it and there was never even a suggestion of surgery.

Same with the next four times: three times I was playing football and tried to come to a stop quickly while running. The fourth time, I was carrying 30kg+ (80lb+) on my back while running down stairs. That's when I also broke my foot. Luckily the 30kg+ (my computer and my Hifi system) were fine :P

One thing that is worth mentioning is that I kept on gaining weight from puberty, so that was definitely a factor..."

soccer,fdwjqqh,t1_fdwf70c,1578759471.0,">I doubt he would be able to walk if he did tear a ligament

It is definitely possible to walk with even three torn ligaments, especially within minutes after the injury, because they only provide lateral stability. The trick is not to roll the ankle sideways, like, at all.

The ankle takes some time to swell up - that's when you become unable to walk on it, and that's when nurses love to twist it in all directions most, to check on mobility. I don't remember many things in my life that hurt more than that..."
soccer,fdwjdzw,t1_fdwdre7,1578759298.0,"I don't disagree, but I just don't like to see (accidental) spread of misinformation on a topic I know a lot about.

/u/DemSkrubs I didn't mean to offend - if I did, my bad. Happy new year :)"
soccer,fdw9tny,t1_fdw0mr3,1578756549.0,"""twisted ankle or bruising""

You have no idea what you are talking about.

""Twisted ankle"" is the movement, not the injury.

This is probably one, two, maybe even all three ankle ligaments *torn*.

Yes, it's a normal surgery - for football players, at least, or for people with private insurance - for me, it was a bandage, some cooling, and ""*should be able to walk again 4 weeks from now, get on with it!*""

edit: yeah, please downvote someone who's had this exact injury six times in his life :D"
