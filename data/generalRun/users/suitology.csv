The semester I was going to go my school messed up my grant paperwork and paperwork for a $750 book scholarship.  Said they would not be able to fix it before the enrollment deadline so I had to put it off another 6 months. 

Since I wasnt working saving up money I started school 2 years behind my friends and peers without a cent gained and the volunteering hasn't been much of a resume booster.
