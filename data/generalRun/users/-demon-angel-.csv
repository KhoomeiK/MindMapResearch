There's corn in almost everything(in some way, shape, or form) so I'm hoping it'll be lower on my next blood test. What I miss most is definitely dairy, though. I can't look at cheesecake without fighting tears anymore. I am trying to find a way to make it with goat cheese instead though. Itll be stronger, but it's something! (Sorry if this info is unnecessary. I tend to overshare so if I am, I apologize)"

I just finally today realized I reached 100lbs. I've been avoiding the foods I'm allergic to for over a year, and this is a huge milestone for me. I honestly relate to the weight issue, but on the different end of the spectrum"
