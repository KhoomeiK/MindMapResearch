cats,ff5ivjg,t3_err8cp,1579594927.0,"Good luck, lily! May you have many more happy years ahead of you!"
Scotch,fep7ggv,t1_fenarxg,1579313841.0,It's a fairly well known short by Poe:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cask_of_Amontillado
Scotch,fej1yvq,t1_fegmbkk,1579153958.0,"I only had a dram of it once at a tasting last year, but I remember liking it, but preferring the Oogie. (I hadn't had the Corryvreckan yet.) Would definitely be worth another try."
teslamotors,fehntzt,t1_fehklsx,1579120318.0,You should never let gingers unlock your phone. They don't have souls to hold them back! /s
Scotch,feg5ri7,t3_eovofv,1579078221.0,"My wife keeps all our whisky boxes, but the amount of storage space needed escalates quickly. I think we have ~30 bottles and the boxes fill multiple cabinets. At some point, I'll toss most of them and hope she doesn't kill me. ðŸ˜‚"
teslamotors,fefpnnf,t1_feednvr,1579061682.0,"I vastly prefer the Y, myself. X is a technological marvel, but I have never loved its look."
Scotch,fefgp0w,t1_feezoo5,1579055948.0,"YMMV, but for me, I prefer the Corry, then the Oogie, then the 10, in that order, when it comes to the ardbegs I''ve tried."
Scotch,fecssgg,t1_fecobiv,1578983227.0,"I appreciate the reply! That definitely tracks with my thoughts on the PC10, though I haven't gotten to try the other two yet. :)"
cats,fe5t0ux,t3_enojwz,1578874294.0,What an adorable sweet face!
Scotch,fdu9tt6,t3_emx2hi,1578730069.0,"I have a 10.3 I'm waiting to open, but now I want a 10.1 too. And a 10.4. Bruichladdich is bankrupting me ðŸ˜‚"
Scotch,fdu9l6e,t3_emzr2e,1578729946.0,"Sounds awesome. Sometimes, scotch is a mood and a moment as much as it is a drink."
aww,fdpucng,t3_emlxua,1578640825.0,"Holy crap. Meanwhile, I proposed over the phone from 3000 miles away. ""Do you want to get married? Ok. Cool."" ðŸ˜‚"
Scotch,fdpu1et,t3_emnf3m,1578640468.0,Oogie!
Scotch,fdphy0g,t1_fdm9gbw,1578629105.0,"I had one in San Diego for $55 which seemed steep, with a bottle going for \~340 at the time. Bar markups are nuts."
Scotch,fdomq7o,t1_fd1g8np,1578608297.0,"Same here! And even then, I wasn't sure my order had gone through until the next day."
Scotch,fdolsl7,t1_fd59x9p,1578607740.0,"If you like the Oogie, you should definitely give the Corryvreckan a try too."
Scotch,fdolkqy,t3_elxc6a,1578607612.0,"Sounds delicious! If you've tried the latest PC10, how would you compare it to this? From your tasting notes, it sounds like this is a more complex dram."
Scotch,fdoccgq,t3_embcf0,1578602595.0,My last (import) order from the whisky barrel ended up getting an extra cost tacked on to account for the tarrifs. I knew it was coming but it still sucked.
teslamotors,fdo7o49,t3_em7l0e,1578600317.0,"Only on road trips. I have a garage and installed a NEMA 14-50 for charging. In my previous house, I charged on a standard 110V outlet, which was slow but mostly sufficient for my needs.

I've had my 3 for almost 2 years now, and I'd say we've used a supercharger \~15 times? Basically, whenever we drive down to LA or San Diego and back.

When I lived in San Diego in early 2018, there were only a few superchargers and they were always (especially the one at Qualcomm) backed up."
teslamotors,fdo4w0b,t1_fdo1jgw,1578598949.0,"IME, it's more accurate to come from the other direction, and say that those who are not Tesla fans are disproportionately right wing.

(In other words, there are definitely people on the right who are Tesla fans... although I think their reasons for liking the cars may have less to do with the environment than for fans on the left.)"
cats,fdjic2m,t3_elkclh,1578472128.0,Jana is beautiful!
Scotch,fd7rglg,t3_ejwjyn,1578208939.0,I can relate. I opened a dram of triple wood a few years back (just a dram  mind you) and my wife came over from two rooms away to find out what the heck that smell was. ðŸ˜‚
teslamotors,fd7iq6j,t1_fd5hogm,1578205179.0,100%.
teslamotors,fczlw3z,t1_fcyjj5b,1578104082.0,"I think it looks great, personally. Would totally have bought it instead of a 3 for the extra storage space alone, had it been available back in 2018."
Pathfinder_Kingmaker,fcz7xux,t3_ejmsxz,1578095484.0,"IIRC, the other cogs aren't part of the 'peasants looking for treasure under the tree' scenario, so you should still be able to find them. For lockpick attempts that you fail, you can generally go back after you've leveled and re-try. Alternately, you can save scum if you don't want to have to bother.

Also as I recall, there are areas later in the game where not finding something/doing something/passing skill checks directly impacts how the game plays out, but that's part of the beauty of the game; you can keep playing and see what happens... if you approach it trying for the 'perfect play' (and what that end is varies from person to person), you'll miss out on a lot of the fun, imo."
Scotch,fcwwjog,t3_ejc3rm,1578040636.0,Definitely matches my thoughts on the dram... I had a similar experience with it being super disappointing at first and then opening up a  bit over time. Good and interesting but not great (even discounting the price) and a long way from my favorite Bruichladdich.
Scotch,fcwuysk,t3_ejc2qg,1578038698.0,"I haven't cracked mine open yet (waiting for visitors so we can taste it together), but it sounds lovely. Thank you for sharing!"
teslamotors,fcv5iep,t3_eixy7d,1577995066.0,"It would have to be optional. Not a fan of changing default behavior, since a lot of us like it just fine, as-is."
Scotch,fcphkmr,t1_fcp9pp0,1577864398.0,"Such a good dram, and your review does a really great job of summing up notes I noticed but couldn't really identify. Thanks!"
teslamotors,fcl18fm,t3_ehpp4y,1577737606.0,"Option C. It's CHP's job to deal with this, not yours... so give them the evidence and let them handle this asshole."
teslamotors,fcgouru,t1_fcgmr8s,1577642448.0,"I believe they're asking about the Netherlands tax change, not the US regulations. (As you can tell in u/ScavengerLife's original post, they already understand how the US law works)"
cats,fbnypck,t3_edybmh,1577004831.0,Bertie's adorable! Thanks for sharing him with us!
