jobs,ff1gnrc,t3_er0x6f,1579478934.0,"minimum wage jobs. apply to 10 a day and for each job you get rejected from, apply to another 5. tell them that you're a fast learner if that's the truth; that even if you can't work a register now that you're sure you can learn with very basic training.

at the interview, tell them you can start working within the week (i always aim for 2 days after the interview). i applied on the 1st or something, got called for an interview on the 6th, had my interview the 7th, and my first day was the 9th."

CPTSD,fde28ae,t1_fdcxmrw,1578329534.0,"that's absolutely how it goes. i'm so sorry to hear that but i'm glad you had the strength to cut her off. i have a job interview tmrw and my grandma volunteered to drive me since my dad took my car, but my ""mom"" had told her shit, and without hearing my side of the story, she sent an email harassing me. i know she would be berating me the whole car ride. let's just say i'll be walking to that interview."
CPTSD,fdbp8m5,t1_fdblhqm,1578259734.0,"yep. on a youtube comment i said that this year i would like to move out and someone asked me ""how were you abused"" and tried to get me to list examples. like sorry but idk you."

AskReddit,fd33svy,t1_fd03f62,1578154469.0,"this is my situation right now! my dad got me an apartment that i will be moving into on the 8th because i couldn't take it anymore. i won't be eating to save money for a phone so that i can get a job. my flight to vegas is in may after i get my associates and i'll be finishing my bachelors down there. if anyone in this thread happens to know of any cheap place to live down there for 3 months, please let me know."
emotionalabuse,fd2m3zk,t1_fczybjb,1578149175.0,"same here. except the way they dealt with my temper was to beat me and take me to a children's home and act like they were dropping me off. this left me (and some of my siblings to a lesser extent) with ptsd, depression, and anxiety. yesterday i talked to my dad. when i brought up that i still had lingering effects from childhood trauma and that that is why i'm moving across the country, he said that he apologized but that i had taken too many psychology classes and was analyzing things way deeper than they needed to be. they'll gaslight you to make it seem like you're the problem or that what you were the one who did something wrong. in reality, you were only 5% of the problem - their reaction to you acting up is and has caused 95% of the problem."

Assistance,fcxljl1,t3_ejaawi,1578065852.0,"19f md. me too, girl. i can't take my car and they also took my phone. if you can secretly scrape up money and make it until may, i'm getting an airbnb in nevada until the fall semester starts, and you're welcome to stay with me.

if your bank has online banking, open a separate account online and store all your money there."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fcwtrzj,t3_eirjjq,1578037293.0,"i'm growing up much quicker than i was before. late december i realized that i was done and on the 2nd i booked a flight to vegas for the day after i graduate and applied for a college there. while i'm looking for employment for here and down there, i'm trying to get a sugar daddy. you can do it!!!"
