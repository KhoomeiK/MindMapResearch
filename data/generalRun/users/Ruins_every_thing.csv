AskReddit,feo1oey,t1_femizjc,1579293945.0,You've never wanted to take a day trip outside of the city to a place not along the train rail?
AskReddit,feo1jyr,t1_femjtcw,1579293880.0,Hopefully you at least know how to drive so when you travel to cities that are designed for drivers (plenty of convenient parking and no public transportation) you won't burden others to drive you places.
AskReddit,feo1cq6,t1_femitpe,1579293762.0,"And much more disgusting, no?  I can't imagine giving up my morning drive in my car.  I would much rather sit in traffic in my own car then get their quicker on the train.  I guess I just value personal space and cleanliness."
AskReddit,feo18ae,t1_fencuh9,1579293688.0,But they are so fucking disgusting.  I don't know where you live but I've been to many cities and I will spend as little time on public transport as humanly possible.  Its just so fucking dirty loud and gross.  How do you avoid getting sick or just disgusted in general?  I can't imagine living like that.
AskReddit,feo0vjn,t1_fenjx4b,1579293585.0,No one I know ever even took one to get their license aside from the written portion.  Not required in my state.
AskReddit,feo0lh6,t1_feniowp,1579293538.0,"No one I know ever took a driving test.  Just the written portion regarding the laws but no actual driving involved.  In my state road tests aren't required if your teacher signs off on it saying you've completed your training.  Oh and the teacher needs no qualifications.  My dad taught me and my sister and signed off on us.  We both totaled cars within the first month.  

To my dad's credit, he honestly did try to thoroughly and strictly train us and thought we were ready but apparently we just needed more practice before being out on our own. It's a lot worse for the kids who parent's don't even put any effort into it."
velvethippos,fee2ma1,t3_eom0p4,1579025108.0,I have one of those!!! https://i.redd.it/afvi0cllsiz31.jpg.  Many more pics in my submission history.  Theodore is very popular on r/squishypuppers.
Cartalk,fdknaqm,t1_fdjz31x,1578507125.0,"Absolutely incorrect.  Wind displaces heat. That's why many machines use fans.  Just like blowing on a spoonful of hot soup helps cool it down, air movement  will rapidly increase the rate at which the engine reaches the air temp.  I don't know how things work at 45 below zero,  but in typical environments,  it takes several hours for an engine to cool completely.  If the wind is blowing on it,  that will decreases the cool down time and increase the time spent at -45, so greater exposure to the sub zero temp.  

Wind affects anything that produces its own heat,  like people AND cars."
aww,fca2qsi,t1_fc9yyxy,1577562213.0,But think about how good the end of it was.  She unfortunately knew what pain and abandonment was and to have it all turned around for her and to get that feeling of unconditional love...I still call this a happy ending.
aww,fca2675,t1_fca14rm,1577561925.0,They do. They spend their entire existence trying their damndest to please us.   That's their only job and they do it so well.
aww,fca1u2v,t1_fc9z25y,1577561746.0,"Oh I'm sorry. You were your pup's whole world and you did good. When you're ready to be loved again, maybe you can give a home to a senior dog who wasn't able to get that from it's previous owner. You two can be over the hill *together*."
aww,fca1gvp,t1_fc9xjys,1577561531.0,Im sure she brought them immense happiness.  Her job was done. And that's a life a dog can hang her hat on.
aww,fc9r8gd,t1_fc9gzfx,1577557002.0,"It's sad of course, but let's be happy that Chi Chi got to live out the rest of her life in a happy home doing hippity hops for treats with a family who loved her. Doggos have such tragically short little lives so whenever they go,  it is always too soon. But she left knowing that she was, in fact,  a very good dog. Which is all we can wish for any pup, and the only thing they really wish for themselves."
squishypuppers,fc1m7ov,t1_fbzp84b,1577322976.0,"Oh he got squeaky toys to destroy,  treats, and prime rib left overs"
squishypuppers,fc1m50u,t1_fc111bl,1577322908.0,"Nope, just a basset hound staffy mix."
