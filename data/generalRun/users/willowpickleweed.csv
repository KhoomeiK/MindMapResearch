I was exercising all the time and never eating cause I was manic, I developed an eating disorder but nobody thought that there was a problem cause eXeRcisE gOod (it is good, it’s just a fuckin shitty piece of advice to randomly give people don’t know)... And FUCK YOGA, mindfulness and meditation, (reiki??? seriously ???) it can help someone but it’s not for everybody! I tried way too much of them all and it would be very cool that people would stop suggesting them. On the other hand Prozac saved my life...

Get medicated, people."

bipolar,fdkkw6m,t3_elv3v6,1578505686.0,"I agree with the other comments.


I’d also add, if the problem is staying sober, avoid the places and the people you get drunk/high with. Don’t be where you don’t trust yourself.
It’s ok, we’ve all been there, getting to know your manic self and how to avoid bad decisions is part of the process. And about the being ashamed part, I totally get it and I’ve been there waaaay too often, just to realize that people don’t care about me all that much (and I mean it the good way) and I can forgive myself for something that’s out of my control. Sounds like you are doing your best, keep it on!"

bipolar,fd48bxr,t3_ejw43n,1578165318.0,"It’s ok OP. Don’t worry about a past fight and your engagement, let this episode be a lesson for what you want out of yourself and your relationship. 
And as the other person said, you should quit alcohol, I used to be an heavy drinker and it made my depression deeper and my mania crazier.
Good luck on everything, you got this!"
bipolar,fcx3pvk,t3_ejd4ia,1578049883.0,"Is she medicated and in therapy? If not, you should expect her to take care of herself or it’d be too frustrating to go out of your way to understand 

I know it’s hard for you, but you have to understand that she lives her reality, she can’t explain it because she doesn’t have a “normal mind” to compare herself with. The reasons why she’s angry or sad are REAL, that’s the mindset you gotta keep with her. You gotta treat her like an angry/sad/manic person, say sorry and get away if you don’t wanna deal with the moment. I know it’s hard, and you didn’t do anything to deserve it, don’t get me wrong, it’s amazing that you are asking and trying to understand. 

also, don’t bring up her bipolar during an episode/fight, it’s invalidating. Ask about it when she is calm and you’re having normal conversation.

This is probably not the answer you’d expect but it’s all I can think about from my bipolar perspective. r/bipolarSOs could help."

Consider therapy if you’re not doing it yet, not only for the dysphoria itself, also for how you relate with it"
mentalillness,fclfdt3,t3_eht7ww,1577746515.0,"Dysphoria isn’t considered a disorder IIRC. 
It is definitely a psychiatric matter tho, and can be co-morbid with other disorders. It often comes with a huge deal of anxiety and depression. 
That said, people shouldn’t message you with stuff that’s not their business whatsoever, of course being trans means you’re gonna need consults and probably therapy, IT DOESN’T MAKE YOU A FREAK nor mentally ill."

My life started one year ago when I quit alcol and drugs and started on meds.
Weed will make you content with an ok-life, it will fuck with your sleep cycle and appetite, you can’t afford this things with bipolar. 

You are doing it right, you’re so young and already diagnosed (I guess), you refer to a therapist and are (usually) on meds. Please keep on this path, weed is an escape but meds and therapy are the way out

Big hug
