ForwardsFromKlandma,fghhdyu,t1_fggfpt4,1580784862.0,"In the real world race has a large part to do with someone’s identity. I don’t think it’s a large stretch to say that characters historically played by a specific type of person (note not race here, if bond was played by a skinny nerd who looked like he hasn’t eaten in a month we wouldn’t like that either (subnote this example has nothing to do with the image above I know that’s not bond))  can be received in much the same way. These characters have identities many people ascribe to them. And that mainly happens when a character comes to a visual medium.

Another example would be voice actors. Geralt from the Witcher has been historically voice acted by two main people before Henry Calville took on the role. Doug Cockle (video game) and Peter Kenney(he reads the audio books). And many those who enjoyed either of those pervious works detested Henries voice. Not because it’s not good, but because it’s ‘not geralt’

Which like you are saying is absurd. It has nothing to do with the quality of his performance, geralt has no “voice” since he’s a book character, and in fact Henry’s voice is quite **excellent** for the role. But people were still upset.

I don’t think the whole casting debate has as much to do with racism as it does with preconceived notions of character identity. It’s just easier for people to scream at each other about racism. And it’s upsetting that no one can try and step back from the race baiting and actually try to think. Why. Why do we care."
