MurderedByWords,ffe9v1h,t1_ffd6ifb,1579840721.0,"Ours asked for 3.5x the rent and it's $1,200 a month. My husband makes 4,000 a month and we barely got approved. Our landlord only gave us a 6 month lease as a trial period to see if we could afford it and he only offered that because we were family friends AND because we had cash up front for security deposit ($1,200), first and last months rent, and pet deposit ($600). 

People act like it's soooo easy to just get an apartment or a house but it's really not, especially if you have a large family. But then you get hit with ""well that's why you should keep your legs closed and not have kids"" bullshit."
AskMen,ffcoeko,t3_esruuu,1579803775.0,My husband wears a silicone one because it's more comfortable and because he works with machinery and tools and shit. He saw a coworker lose a finger because of a wedding band and some machine so he's a lil traumatized now and won't wear one to work.
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffb4xb6,t3_esmody,1579751894.0,"Ugh. I got this way too often when I was pregnant with my twins and working as a cashier. I even had a customer complain to my manager that I was being lazy. I couldn't take FMLA, didn't have any vacation time or maternity leave because I was part time."
