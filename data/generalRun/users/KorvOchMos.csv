He is a full breed Norwegian Forest Cat. I feel like the luckiest person in the world that he is mine. 

We wish you and your precious girl peace and really hope that she recovers to full glory"

cats,fg3slry,t1_fg3o4ml,1580488785.0,"Very cute! 

I was sad and stressed the other morning. Ernie was very busy rummaging under the bed. When he noticed the state of me, he dropped everything and took off outside in a haste. A few minutes later he came back and left a freshly caught mouse at my feet. It was bigger than usual even! 

He doesn’t care to know other people. Any creatures that wander by, foxes, squirrels, other cats and dogs. And birds, he welcomes and happily shares his food with. As much as the weather permits, he wants his food outside. So that he can see if someone comes by. 

Also, he can’t resist big spiders. They have to be big or else he doesn’t care."
cats,fg3nrm3,t1_ffw4hmf,1580485798.0,"Is your Snow a Norwegian? 

Ernie brings mice often. Mostly still alive. He torturers them for a few hours and then eats a little of their body. 

Despite this horror, he is the most sweet natured individual and such a delight"

RoastMe,fdpw93e,t3_emcjqc,1578643112.0,"Your eyes look really sad and cold. I think you put on that tough girl exterior, in order to cover up the sadness and disappointment you feel inside. You will have to deal with it one day. I wish you well"
