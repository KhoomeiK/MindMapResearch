I think calling it cultural appropriation is just jumping through extra hoops. But say black people weren't fired from jobs due to those hairstyles. Would it still be inappropriate for white people to wear them?

And also, people might call a white person participating in a día de los muertos parade cultural appropriation, but I would think that that person is anything except racist. And that's why I don't see a problem with things like that. 

I'm trying to put myself in other's shoes. I think if I had something about my culture, I would want to share it. Hairstyles, clothes, even holidays. Because why not? I obviously would think my own culture is cool, don't you like to share things you think are cool? Sure, some people will say your cool thing sucks and that their cool thing is better and then make fun of your cool thing. But assholes will always exist, unfortunately. And so, racism will exist.

Sorry for rambling. I just think this whole cultural appropriation thing is at it's worst, just plain racism and should be refered to as such, and at it's most ridiculous, r/gatekeeping . After all, in the end we're all just humans.

Ok... But how many white people do you see wearing burqas or hijabs, etc.? Probably so few you can count them on one hand. That's because we all know that that's fucking dumb. And that's obvious. But we're talking about stuff like eating Indian curry or wearing a poncho or something.

Children desperately want to fit in. It's how they grow up. And that means conforming to culture. A child immigrant (or a child of an immigrant) probably will not conform completely to the culture and so other children will tease them. It's only natural. It sucks, but it's natural. Most people grow out of this (except for actual racists) and that's why the immigrant might think it's suddenly become ""trendy"" as they get older. It's not trendy, they just aren't children anymore and they realized what it means to be racist."
