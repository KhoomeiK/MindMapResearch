Whatcouldgowrong,ffcws2s,t1_ffbngci,1579808894.0,"Do you have kids? I hope you don't and that's why you're not understanding, but kids birthdays are fucking burned into your mind as a parent, I don't care how many kids you have, every one of those dates you written hundreds of times, and if you have 4 kids over age 8 you've gone through more than 40 birthdays with them. 

My guess is he froze on camera for some reason, the guy didn't even remember that his daughters birthday was yesterday. He just seems like a dork on camera maybe, and I hope he really does know when his kids were born."

Birthdays though, with all the times you celebrate birthdays and write down their birth dates as they grow up, there's no way you wouldn't know that unless you're completely uninvolved. If you went to a hospital and didn't know the doctor's name that's probably common enough, but if you didn't know date of birth I think the nurses or whoever would look at you like you were a complete fuck up. And with good reason."
Whatcouldgowrong,ffbnm7w,t1_ffb6dog,1579774426.0,"The question is how could you not know the birthdays unless you are just completely fucking clueless. Those kids are like 8, 10, 14 somewhere in there, guy has been through dozens of birthdays. Dozens. I don't care if he works every hour of every day of the week and never sleeps, there's no way you don't know your own kids birthdays unless you're intoxicated."

I am very close to your description of your dad, right down to getting no sleep and working 60+ hours a week. If he does any paperwork for you like I do for my own kids, dude knows your birthdays for sure."
Whatcouldgowrong,ffbncwt,t1_ffbmb71,1579774038.0,"I don't think the question is how dedicated or loving of a feather he is, the real question is, how do you not know THAT basic of info about your own kids. Birthdays? Come on there's really no excuse. I am not even sure I believe this is real that's so implausible. I am a father of three, do you even know how many times you have to write down kids birthdays? Much much more than your own. Even if he doesn't do any paperwork, or doesn't take them to the doctor or fill out insurance forms etc. Those dates are burned in to a parents mind. Maybe he was really really high."
Whatcouldgowrong,ffbn4tz,t1_ffblgru,1579773690.0,There's no fucking way you don't remember your kids birthdays. I work 60+ hours a week and know all that stuff and I'm tired as fuck all the time. I could sit still for 5 minutes and fall hard asleep. Don't you ever fill out paperwork or anything like for school or doctor or insurance etc that requires you to know their birthdays? Don't you ever plan anything for your kids birthdays? Come on man. Do you know thier teachers? Best friends? Seems like these are all very very basic involvement level shit for a dad.

Most people are happy to pay for art, and happy to pay full price of what you quote them. Some people will ghost you as soon as you quote them, and a few people, just a few, do not understand that art is a profession. Some people think of art as a hobby and cannot fathom people paying for it nor do they view it as a real job.

So for a good 2 years I had an infant and a small child in my care for most of the daytime during the week, I did my own job, as well as the housework including meals. My wife was at work 50 hours a week so it was all up to me. The “thanks” I got cane in the form of keeping my family fed and happy.

How difficult/easy of a kid it is

How good one is at multitasking 

All These things factor in. 

Just so happens in my own experience, things lined up to be an easy Ish experience twice for me. However if your day job was like passive data entry, and you have a very colicky baby, I could see it being harder, mentally if anything. 

I am personally also used to being up at night, so responding to baby at 2am is not a big deal so I could see how it would be hard on those who sleep a normal schedule to wake up and respond to crying.

I gave her various activities and she learned to generally self entertain while I was working, but I took a lot of intermittent breaks to reset her attention, or to take care of her in various ways. This ended up working out very well though because I would have on educational shows on my office TV as well as little letter and number activities that I made for her, and was generally okay if I was interrupted to help her with whatever she needed but it must have paid off because she learned to read (for the most part) by the time she hit kindergarten.

I was then a stay at home dada again for a while until one went to preschool, which I took her to and picked her up from daily, the other little one stayed with me full time. During all of this I was able to work basically full time from home, though I put in a lot of night hours too to make up for daytime hours dedicated to child care. 

Now we’re expecting our 3rd, which will be at home with me again after 3 months, but both kids will be in school next fall and only baby will be with me while I work, but I will still have to take them to and from school in the morning and afternoon, and make sure the baby is fed and cared for during days, however I can still work in between and make sure the house is clean and start dinner etc.
