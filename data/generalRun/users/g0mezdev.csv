Realise that you’re free to do anything you want. Get a chill job, at a small and cheap area, join a local group centred around your interests, go to the cinema, observe the craziness of the world - it’s so fun being a lone dreamer. Yes you’re sad, and you’re filled with despair. But there is art that corresponds with that feeling. There is rock and roll, there are people that listen to it. There are different cultures to meet, barriers to break.

There’s so much, but this chemical imbalance causes us to have tunnel vision and isolates us in a dark room, unable to move and, eventually, breathe.

Go ahead, try it. Go to a park and examine the quality of the air you breathe. Realise that you can be doing the same in Japan, Sweden, Moscow, Milan, Liverpool, Sydney. Or in the middle of nowhere - if you choose to go. I promise you, the air is different in all of these places.

advertising,fgy418e,t1_fgy0epj,1581179280.0,"In the UK, most start up agencies register as Limited companies. The registration is done via Companies House. Then your trading name, founders, years of operation and performance metrics become public and that is one of the prerequisites necessary for most business grants, loans, partnerships etc. Every country has its own equivalent."
advertising,fgy3cr1,t1_fgxvj6y,1581179029.0,"I can’t decide for you, since I don’t know what is your situation in detail, but this reminds me of most of my photographer accounts. They think they can become a pro photographer just by buying expensive gear, so they register themselves as businesses, take out loans, get grants to buy their Gimbals, lenses and tripods to “shoot for the stars” without even knowing what “aperture”, “shutter speed”, and Lightroom CC are. And then when it’s all spent, they come to us, asking for a new website, SEO and PPC campaign for 500 pesos.

So, typically agencies use business grants/loans on computers, software, media equipment and financial services. I would definitely go for grants, but not loans; focusing on the things that you need to operate as a freelancer. While you’re alone, your mentality and acquisitions should focus solely on you and the things that make your life easy, and elevate the quality of your work.

When you hire the first “agent”, they will need a computer, wage, chair, warmth, love and so on... Thats basically your newborn. A registered business has access to government funds which help boost employability - so you might get some money to cover their salary for a month or two. If grants can’t cover your necessities, you resort to loans. That’s why I would limit all startup investment to grants, saving the serious loans when there are dependents under the company umbrella.

I would say do the research and consider what grants are available to you in your area, and do they have conditions which would make them unavailable to you after registering a business. If you’ve finished uni, those sometimes have business incubation schemes for graduates, so do make use of those."
advertising,fgxnubv,t3_f0scz3,1581174774.0,"Get this straight though - if you’re solo, you’re basically operating as a freelancer. You can register it as an agency, but all you’re going to do is put a target on your ass and be a laughing stock. 

Try your hand at freelancing. If you can’t freelance full-time, that’s a red flag for yourself.

It makes sense to register an agency when a) you need investment and there are business grants available (which may not be available post-registering); b) you have 5 gold clients, and can’t handle the 6th, so you need a second agent and feel easy to get to 10 gold clients real fast.

You like to do advertising? Well, do you like doing finance, bookkeeping, admin? Don’t know what these things are? Just be mindful that when you find out, that will be your only pre-occupation.

Got co-founders? That’s the best way to go. But the agency is not “yours yours”, and you should have these conversations with your founders. If they can’t cover the bases and you need to resort to reddit - your local agency will wipe the floor with you.

And what value will your business have when you decide to sell it? A few old MacBooks you got through those startup grants and a cheap photo backdrop? Accounts, which are known to bail once the agency is acquired by a bigger player? This is a service based business - you basically earn as much as you work, and in the beginning, the profit margin tends to be microscopic. Is your “why?” strong enough? 

And the golden rule: under promise, over deliver. All those who “believe in themselves” have a tendency of going for as many clients as possible from the beginning and it is very easy to over promise. Don’t promise shit, the first meeting is to see what they want, the 2nd is a pitch to sell the shit out of yourself. Don’t deviate from the pitch (but do learn how to fucking pitch).

From your post, I can see that you have a problem with negativity. That means you’re susceptible to “toxic positivity”. If that is really the case, you won’t have the mentality to survive in advertising as an agency startup. It’s very cold, calculated, cut-throat and the only thing that matters is effectiveness in executing creativity. Creativity becomes mediocrity if you can’t handle or use negativity. 

If you’re not creative, don’t appoint yourself as a “creative director” down the line. That role is for your creative gurus to look forward to. If you take that position, they will stay with you for a while to get the money, accounts, experience and skills, and they will take that shit to your competitor, where they can get directorship.

Creative does not mean you come up with ideas, Karen. I can come up with 40 ideas in 2 minutes, and half of them will be good. Ideas are nothing, execution is everything, and if all you do is manage a business, you’re not a creative. Your ideas mean nothing."

I guess most reasons have something to do with the pursuit of happiness. Happiness is virtually not possible without the things specified in Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs (think food, shelter, hygiene, clean water, weather appropriate clothing etc.).

So in order to cover these basic necessities for your family, loved ones, friends and yourself, you need to have something to offer to the groups of people which exist solely to satisfy your basic needs/wants.

These systems are called businesses and governments, and they are made out of people, just like yourself. They participate in those systems because they also have basic needs. So, you exchange money with goods, and that money funds other people who will continue participating in the system as both producers and consumers. Basically, it’s modern hunting/gathering. It’s survival.

As part of an intelligent species of mammal, you are subjected to higher standards when compared to a typical animal, and are offered with a reliable infrastructure to maximise the likelihood of your survival. You take something from it (clean water, protection from other groups, electricity, medicine, food), but you are also required to give it something (your time, money, skills, presence). This system has proven to be effective in maximising your survival and the chances for you to realise your potential, and essentially pursue happiness in an effective manner. This system is called a society.

You are subjected to the natural factors, affecting your psychology and physiology, which determines your status within the society. Like most people suffering from depression, you are affected by a chemical imbalance in your brain, which likely hinders the release of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine (not sure about the spelling) in your brain - these are the chemicals which regulate your cognitive reward systems.

That means being subjected to an increased resistance in pursuing long-term rewards. If you are clinically depressed, you are likely to be suicidal - that means that you see no evidence or conviction towards the notion that your continued existence or actions will lead to an award. An award is basically the release of dopamine and other chemicals in your brain, to create the feeling of happiness.

So, my friend - the answer is simple. You are depressed. It is both an illness and a problem. Problems can be solved, illnesses can be managed. Many people are not facing the same problems as you are. Many are facing physical handicaps, rather than mental. This is the randomness of life allocating a challenge for you to deal with - it is exactly what makes you unique. And, I would argue, it ought to be a starting reason for your continued existence and motivational fuel behind your actions.

I had to explain this to myself when I became bitter about existence. I still use this logical framework in my daily approach to managing depression, personal discipline and effectiveness as a member of society."

Managing time, means more breathing space for freelancing, entrepreneurship and marketing consultancy.

If you’re confident in your abilities, the “lower pay” smaller shop job will just be a buffer for your financial stability, while you’ll have more leverage to go for the stars whichever way you see fit.

You should first face facts: a) Your education is there to prove to your future corporate overlords that you are able to learn and are not mentally ill; b) You will most likely not make it in marketing and may switch careers after the first 2 years; c) If you don’t have any creative skills now, and you can’t research the thousands of previous threads and resources available online about the skills needed in marketing instead of creating a new thread, you will most definitely won’t be a “self-learner” and a creative. 

What you need to do right now, in my opinion, is decide on one of these options: a) pursue a career in academia; b) go the general big corporate route(including both agency and client side); c)  small agency-side; d) small client-side.

So with these options, a) get ready to go for PhD, all you need is your uni; b) finish masters, throw in some general lies about knowing SEO on your resume and perhaps get a PPC certification - good to go; c) you need to be a creative for start-up agency side work. You’re a marketing student - not a media production student. Self learn now or give up; d) Take a mini course in social media, and get ready to do sales calls, because you will be a sales rep despite your title having the word “marketing” in it. 

Oh, so you think you’re a creative and want to join a start-up agency? In that case, you’ve made a mistake - you should be a media or a creative advertising student. It’s not too late to change - go do legendary doses of LSD, forget everything that those dying hags tell you in uni and learn graphic design. Copywriting is a given, and if you don’t have it now, you will never have it. Your copy should be pristine at this point - give up right now if it is not, you are just never going to be competitive.

There is no utopia, for all we know there never will be. The closest thing to utopia that we have managed to create is based in capitalism. Everything is going fine, despite what your digital echo chamber tells you - we are ending poverty on a global scale at accelerating rates. All funded by capitalist money. Now, tell me - where are those sweatshops located? And so, why are they not regulated? 

The answer to utopia or anything that you care about that includes mistreatment if people, lies in technological advances. Technological developments are essential in a competitive capitalist society - so the answer lies in capitalism. 

Capitalism is the answer to our future. Socialism fucking sucks and brings on the deaths and suffering and misery of entire nations. I come from Lithuania, and my parents have experienced it first hand. We fucking love capitalism and the west. Only a sheltered, ideologically affected person can dare to critique this marvellous system, especially against socialism."

Entrepreneur,ff24xt9,t1_ff1vqv6,1579493924.0,"True, but if you don’t moderate a subreddit or any online community (digital marketer here, agency side), it will attract parties which will feel free and welcome to post their nonsense exclusively in that community. If you ban them, and make it clear why, the action of banning will directly affect the parties participating in the community. So shitposts will disappear, and proper evidence based posts will reappear. This is what we are talking about here - maintain the standards of the community and continue receiving great content or let it all go to shit and skip every post."
Entrepreneur,ff24lc9,t1_ff1vq3k,1579493646.0,"From a woman’s stories perspective, it is actually highly ideological and toxic to maintain women in business as some sort of magical respect worthy thing (more so than being a male in business). 

If we are truly equal, sex shouldn’t have any role in business success stories, in general. We have women’s business societies now, where men are excluded - all that tells me is that women deem themselves as not strong enough to survive on their own merit without worthless accolades and a sex-based community to pat them on the back while they participate in the exclusion of men in modern business.

And again, a woman’s success story or a mans success story is nothing more than a fantasy without any evidence. You can celebrate, worship, maintain allegiance with any social cause you think is “inspiring” to you - you can even worship a little pebble you found in Thailand - but entrepreneurs should hold themselves to a higher standard, especially if it is a community of entrepreneurs.

So, are we going to turn into a motivational speaking subreddit, filled with mediocre tales of riches and wonder without evidence? Or are we going to start cleaning shit up and actually seeking material which is gold, worthy of our time?"
Entrepreneur,ff240qt,t1_ff1w6uq,1579493200.0,"Its “inspiration from a business figure” to perform an entrepreneurial activity. Entrepreneurship has risk involved, whether it is losing capital or time or both. If your inspiration comes from surreal fantasies of some deluded sociopath over the internet and doesn’t come from the evidence behind it all - you will most definitely be at a disadvantage in business if you go against those people who have an evidence based approach to things.

If we’re here to celebrate entrepreneurship and seek inspiration from success, there should be a barrier to entry when it comes to presenting these stories of success. Answering questions to everyone’s satisfaction and providing the basic evidence to support your claims is awesome, while anything less than that just reeks of fakeness. If you’re inspired by fakeness, good luck being an entrepreneur.
