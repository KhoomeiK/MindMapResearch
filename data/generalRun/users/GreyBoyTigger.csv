A city needs people with varying skills and if waiters, bartenders, cashiers, retail workers, and even small business owners can’t afford to live in the area then what is the motivation? It’s almost like those in charge are blind to this. 

The solution seems to be serious rent control and fining those who sit on empty property. In typical California tradition, administrators will talk a lot about the great economy and refuse to address this cancer that is rotting the state. 

It’s going to be tiptoed around like PG&E not being dissolved even after they blew up several cities, went bankrupt, were caught giving out bonuses after bankruptcy, and are now raising rates to cover their legal expenses.
