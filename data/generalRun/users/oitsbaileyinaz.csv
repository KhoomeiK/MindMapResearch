bipolar,ff2f9aq,t3_er94c8,1579503672.0,I have been on it for a couple of years and have times when this happens to me as well.
bipolar,ff2f3wd,t1_ff2eur5,1579503498.0,"I think you should leave it. You didn't do anything wrong. better here than to someone who has no idea what is going on! literally laughing at myself writing that. 

I meant it when I said I am a major asshole when not medicated/manic. Glad you are feeling better."
bipolar,ff2eruw,t3_er7o83,1579503121.0,"Hi. I am not bipolar, I have bipolar. I am a lot more than that. Anywhere else on the internet you would most likely get a lot of push back for this rant. Not here. I like the niceties here. I need a space where I can openly talk about the terrible things I have done and said when manic. 

 I am on medication right now, but I have gone off of it many times. I actually have a long history of doing what you did here. I am not a nice person without my medication, and sometimes I am a right bastard with it. I 100% know that my suicidal ideations are real and am here to encourage people like myself that feel like they are fucking nuts. I am sorry that you are going through it right now. Lexapro is a dream in my opinion."
bipolar,ff2ef68,t3_er8fcu,1579502730.0,"hmmm. Someone shouldn't need to believe you when you are telling them facts. You can't debate someone's feelings. If you feel something or think something, then it is real. find a new doctor. You are your biggest advocate. Don't stop until someone helps."
bipolar,ff2eaoz,t3_er8pwk,1579502590.0,"been there on multiple occasions. I must be crazy to think that it is going to be fine every time lol. The first step is admitting it's shit! 

You are doing great, good luck!"
bipolar,ff2e4ks,t3_er6yok,1579502400.0,"Oh man. The issues with your boss are like a mirror image of me pre-diagnosis. I am not even going to try to help you sort out a diagnosis. 

I was going through this EXACT issue where they were wanting to switch my diagnosis from BP I to BP II and then to BPD. I just said fuck it and started focusing on treating my symptoms. As someone who has been in health care for a long time, I feel like mental health is the only appropriate situation where you treat symptoms rather than disease. There is no cure. labels aren't important here, your mental health is. Just be honest in what you are experiencing. You are there for treatment, not to be concerned about putting a name to it. Keep seeing your specialists. It gets better, I promise."
bipolar,ff2dvhi,t3_er3fl0,1579502128.0,"I carry a little notebook around. Weird because I stay up for long stretches and make lists when I am manic, but making lists when I am stable helps me feel more prepared/in control. 

I hope this is therapeutic for you!"
bipolar,fcnss6y,t3_ei5zs1,1577817726.0,I am feeling particularly down today. Feel free to reach out to complain. Better than the alternative.
bipolar,fcncszx,t3_ei43jd,1577808946.0,I make lists. They consist of things that pissed me off through out the day (I have a lot of anger when manic). Then I read them when I get home. I do this in a quiet and peaceful space with no interruption. It really grounds me and makes me reflect on things. I got mad yesterday because someone took to long at the printer. I mean I was pissed. I am 99% sure that I flung my body as I stomped out of the copy room. They were there first and have every right to be there!
bipolar,fclengs,t1_fckxl9p,1577746035.0,Omg. I feel insane with the auditory hallucinations. I told my doctor about it but she kinda shrugged it off once I told her it has never happened before. I’m thinking about finding a new doctor. Thoughts?
bipolar,fclegnh,t3_ehq2us,1577745911.0,"When I’m manic? I feel like I’m wide awake. Like nothing really matters. I guess I feel high on life. I spend money I don’t have and say things that are really quite rude. I am unstoppable. I think I’m a real hard ass who nobody can hurt. I stay up for days with an hour or two of sleep. I compulsively make lists. I am in a constant state of doing. Then I come down and I’m in debt, severed relationships, and am often facing repercussions at work for my behavior. 

Manic depression? I sometimes don’t shower more than twice in a couple weeks. And yes, I go to work like that. That is when I go to work at all. My house becomes a frat house in terms of mess. I just don’t care. I have no motivation and am completely unreasonable.  

When I’m managed I can only describe it as whelmed. Not underwhelmed or overwhelmed. I just am. I think this is how other people feel all the time. Just in control. That’s actually the scariest time for me. I feel like I’m in control and totally conscious of all decisions and thoughts and words. But am I? Or is it my brain just playing tricks and I’m actually manic? 

Bipolar is being mind fucked over and over and over. 

And don’t forget the meds and side effects. I’m a science experiment and I’m being pumped with meds. 

Rashes, nausea, sedation, twitching."
bipolar,fcldqdb,t3_ehqtns,1577745436.0,"Interestingly enough I was incredibly social and had less depression. Outbursts were my tell as a kid. I wasn’t diagnosed until my 20s but I was so manipulative as a kid that when my mom took me to the doctor to be screened for issues, I lied on all the questions. I really got my diagnosis because my anger and constant mood swings were out of control and I thought I was going to lose my job. I feel like they became more and more frequent but I was also very aware of them at that point."
bipolar,fcldef0,t3_ehra3r,1577745216.0,"Just say what you feel, even if it is hard. I cry at every single appointment because it feels like I’m finally able to let out a painful and embarrassing secret in a safe place. I do this even when I’m managed."
bipolar,fcld6w6,t3_ehqefd,1577745082.0,HA! Seroquel the sedative lol. The first time I took 25 mg I passed out with no recollection of even laying in bed. Glad you found something good for you ❤️
bipolar,fcl6229,t1_fckldov,1577740585.0,That’s a tough situation to be in. He should still invite you. Don’t dwell on it. If you went with them you’d have to be pretend nice to someone lol nobody’s got time for that!
bipolar,fckkmaz,t3_ehos71,1577727383.0,Relatable af
bipolar,fckki6z,t1_fcjkupv,1577727313.0,I’m not invited because I rarely go. But I’ve had talks with my friends who tell me this why and that I’m always invited.
bipolar,fckkfgt,t1_fcjr7g8,1577727266.0,Samesies! I sometimes would rather do that alone on a Friday night than interact with others. I’m secretly 12 at heart in a 30 year olds body lol
OutOfTheLoop,fckj1dx,t1_fcbd9kk,1577726407.0,Heyyy yaaaaa
bipolar,fckd4o6,t3_ehm3xt,1577722650.0,Yay for finding something that works. 4 months of stability is an AMAZING milestone!
bipolar,fckcyg4,t1_fcjlxej,1577722538.0,Thank you so much!
bipolar,fcj49x9,t1_fcitcsu,1577676905.0,Lamictal has been my longest stable medication. It’s a perfect match you could say
bipolar,fcj47mg,t1_fcighqx,1577676859.0,Wooo Wellbutrin did me dirty as far as side effects go. Seroquel=life
bipolar,fcj44l7,t1_fci1xsd,1577676798.0,I really hope that you get your match soon! I still have to try new meds occasionally when my body gets used to one. I have had allergies and side affects. All worth it! I try to remind myself that there isn’t a cure all because we all have different brains. ❤️ stay strong friend!
bipolar,fchnxxd,t3_eh7ypx,1577652229.0,"ignorance. I think my family didn't understand the severity of it until they saw me with it under control (meds). We all do a pretty good job of hiding certain aspects. I had my car repossessed after going on a manic shopping spree with my car payment for months. 

Shit like that really drives home what a mental illness will do and people don't know until it is too late.

Bipolar *is*  a lifestyle. It is an incredibly dangerous, careless, and emotionally damaging lifestyle that I cannot get out of. I just didn't choose this one. It isn't glamorous or a choice."
bipolar,fchn7jf,t3_eh84rb,1577651993.0,"hi. Three months behind on my car payment and waiting on the repo man to show up anytime now. You aren't alone my friend.

I just do what I can. I am only one person, I can only do one thing at a time. I cannot magically make money appear. I can however take steps to make sure that I don't spend it in a manic fit. I have terrible manic depression so this really spoke to me. 

I got an account at a credit union with no ATM/debit card. That way I would have to physically go to the bank to pull money out and then deposit it to another account to buy things online or whatever. Makes you think before you do it.

""check yourself before you wreck yourself"" method!

Tell someone so that they can make you feel guilty whenever you do it. Give your bank card to someone you trust so you have to shamefully ask when you want to buy something you don't need."
bipolar,fchm3bl,t1_fch7gb4,1577651710.0,"DUDE! I quit my job, packed my car, and moved to another state last year. I was fine and then I thought that I was so fine I went off my meds. That really didn't make a difference for months and then BOOM. 

you can be a badass rule rejector AND take meds. People will take your happiness and choices more seriously when they know you have your mania under control. My family used to blame anytime I was pissed off on bipolar. Now that I am medicated, I am pissed and they know its legit lol"
bipolar,fchkvz6,t3_eh12so,1577651418.0,"same for me w/ writing. I contribute to a blog about mental health. Ironic since my mental health is what keeps me from writing. 

&#x200B;

this is beautiful. Jelly fish have always been the theme of a running joke with my best friend. This brought me happiness."
bipolar,fchk0fi,t3_egv74p,1577651198.0,I feel like this would be a great bipolar meme. I lol'd at how true this was.
bipolar,fchjron,t3_eh7yw6,1577651144.0,"Oh man, I have such an issue with people speaking loudly. I can't really decipher if it is me being anxious that it draws attention or if it me fixating on something. I lose it. I lash out and nobody understands why I am being a raging B for no reason.

I have been really open that I have sensitivity to this. Since I have had those conversations, it isn't perceived as rude when I say ""can we lower the volume"" on a conversation. I also reserve time for myself to sit in quiet. Sometimes, when I am in a loud place like a bar, I will run out and sit in my car for a few. People think I forgot something in there lol."
bipolar,fchj0sh,t3_eh86dx,1577650901.0,"all you need is a referral to a behavioral health doctor. Let a specialized professional help you as opposed to your PCP. I went undiagnosed for years! My mom took me as a kid because she knew that I had a problem (in a loving way of course) but nobody caught it. You are doing an amazing job at recognizing that you may need more help than you are getting! 

YOU ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THERE IS A PROBLEM!

I am so proud that you are seeking out help, that you are realizing what is going on around you. I only drink or smoke when I am feeling happy, never when I am sad. 

I was homeless for many years, abusing prescription medications to sleep, stealing (SO much stealing), had no relationship with my family. My diagnosis changed my life. Keep advocating for yourself. Go to the hospital. anything that makes you heard."
bipolar,fchhigs,t3_eh5jez,1577650534.0,"This hit me in the heart. Sometimes I want to plan something, like a vacation, and I stop and wonder if this is me being manic or if I am just being a normal person planning a vacation. I really can't tell the difference. When I am manic and make big decisions or purchases, I only really understand I was manic once it has been done and my world crashes as a result."
Piracy,exgqc24,t3_csh5ti,1566271316.0,I use drop box for all pirated books! I share them with my sister via the same drop box account
