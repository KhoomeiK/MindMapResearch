A 4K stream is ~20mbit/sec, I reckon any synology NAS would be able to handle 5 x 4k streams, but you are probably not going to be doing 5 x 4k ever, so I would say no problems with 5 users.

If you are **really** worried about energy efficiency a 1-bay with 2.5"" drive will do the job. No raid though.

For raid, 2 disks will allow 1/2 the available disk space (2x4Tb = 4Tb disk space)

3 disks will allow raid with 2/3 of the disk space available (3x4Tb = 8Tb available), but will use 1.5x the power that a 2 disk array will use. 

Raid is not a backup strategy though, it is about maintaining service. So if your five users can wait while you get a new drive and restore from backup a single 2.5"" drive is the most power efficient.

Another that just blocks ads, and the third blocks nothing because my wife works in online/digital and needs to see ads to do her job. I use DHCP to set the DNS server for different devices via MAC address. Unknown devices will use the most restrictive DNS server. Anything that tries to use a DNS server that is not on the LAN (looking at you android and chromecast) is redirected to the most restrictive DNS server.

I lived in strata, renting for 4 years then owning ever since I arrived in Australia in the late 90s. The only reason we bought a house (about 4 months ago) was because we had two kids, boy 7 and girl 3, and a two bed unit - ok at the moment but possibly problematic during teenage years. We looked at 3 bed units and townhouses as well (mostly so we could keep our unit as an investment), but our ideal house just turned up so sold the unit and went with that.

I assume you are talking about owning?

If you have bad neighbours in strata they are probably breaking by-laws so the possibility of eviction is there, and so if they are renters generally leave or owners ... never had an owner who was a bad neighbour (no disrespect to renters meant). Only had a bad neighbour once, but I just went around with a couple of tinnies ""WTF dude! Lets have a beer and talk"" which resolved it, but he moved out at the end of the lease anyway. If you have bad neighbours in a house ... good luck?

Strata fees can seem expensive, but that includes a fair bit of insurance, cleaning, gardening and maintenance of common property (which you do have a say in), but have to do/pay for yourself in a house. However, because common property is shared you do have to conform to standards more stringently than a house so you can be hit up for fire audits etc, but then do you want to live in a top floor unit in a block without proper fire protection etc?

The only thing that would worry me would be moving into a newer block where they developers own more than 50% of the units so that it is very difficult to get things done because they can outvote someone. Remember that as an owner you do have a say in strata, can get on the committee, can rally owners to get stuff done etc - you own a share of everything."

I'm also not convinced that someone who would struggle installing arch to the point they want easy installation scripts is best served by using arch over, for instance, Ubuntu. Why would you use arch over, for instance, ubuntu if you didn't want to get involved in some nuts and bolts?
