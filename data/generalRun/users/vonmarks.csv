mkxmobile,ffattn6,t1_ffas1c4,1579744337.0,Quests and now the new towers really do a lot.  I set my alarms as well.  Still stuck on the lower quests since its a new account but was surprised how many souls I accumulated this early and after reading your write up can start hoping for what the year end looks like.  I was hoping to do a whole new account for a year then do a  post on here with the results. Not spending yet though.  Feels like the math works out better to wait for sales.  I could build up a roster now at a higher cost with not as much return as I would get waiting for a sale.  Like your data. Couldn’t imagine getting the amount souls when the game originally began. The biggest thing I miss is the free golds in the silver pack but what they actually give us free now kind of evens it out if not makes it better.  I know on some older accounts I could spend the 30000 coins for a chance at 30 souls and it felt like a lot but quests and towers give me that now.  They also haven’t discounted the coin packs in a while.  Great work but I’m still suspect on that original account we were talking about!
mkxmobile,ffar5ul,t1_ffapoe3,1579742564.0,"Can you link the post?  I see the one about the kollector but it shows 583 per week on quests only.  We have daily’s and challenges and misc but not seeing that add up to 4500 per week let alone 25000 a month.  Also you state at max efficiency.  That would assume that this is someones only or primary game.  It is mine.  I do it way more than I should.  Only finished first once in FW but even then that felt excessive. Taps while working out, taps while driving(don’t tell nobody!) taps while doing anything.  I even quit for a while because it was an addiction and not a game.  Thats why I started a new account, to see what was “legit” with normal play and I still end up playing it instead of playing my guitar or learning my languages.  It consumed me again and even so I can barely get 1500 souls a week and when having higher accounts can’t see turning out 4500 per week.  Again we can assume that the account in question lives for this game like I did/do again but its highly unlikely.

Edit:  disregard.  Didn’t slide over on mobile.  Will run through the data and see if I can replicate.  Still have one “legit”(wink, wink) account high level account I can do this on.  Thanks for the input."
mkxmobile,ffao15i,t1_ff9vhxg,1579740458.0,"25k in a month?  I started a new account at the beginning of the year.  Making roughly 220 per day, which will go up but only a little once I start getting higher up in faction wars.  There are tutorials on youtube about getting souls which equal about 480 per day but with high characters already.  Even at 500 per you still end at 15000 in a month.  I've played from the beginning of the game as well and can spot suspicious accounts when they're there.   Highly suspicious on this one.  If you have the trick that nets us 840 souls per day stop holding out and let us know.  I also was hacker for a long time after they messed up my original account, longer story.  Now, the account could be ridiculous with cash and spend money on a nonsense phone app but that's on them.   The odds of maxing a character after 3 months is highly improbable without spending excessive money, hacking, or saving souls an entire year.  The last is unlikely because I could all but guarantee this account has all maxed characters and would have had to spend those souls somewhere.  So then we have the money side which again is on them and their own prerogative.   That leaves hacking which is probably the best case scenario.  Once you hack for a while you can justify the numbers.  As long as you are not maxed out early you get a pass unless someone reports you because they haphazardly assume it can't be done legit.  Which presents the biggest problem.  Even if legit, once you are reported they can do anything with your account.  I had legit accounts banned.  Remember back when DOTDK was a pack and if you bought it legit you got banned?  Well they never fixed everyones.  I had one account ""clone"" another simply though the iphone settings with no hack involved, both accounts banned.  I saved souls on an account specifically to get SJV and had him high fusion but was reported and deemed ""hacked"" without any explanation form NR studios.  I assume its because I had a couple of accounts so the data transferred between like it did the last time they banned me.  Having multiple accounts was their suggestion by the way.  Thats the long story I referred to earlier.  FW stopped working so they told me to start another then switch between the two until it stated working again but then banned me once one cloned the other.  Hence the reason I started hacking."

mkxmobile,fdzvaxm,t3_elsncd,1578796644.0,"Late to the party but I quit for a couple months and came back.  Was an original then hacked for a bit and now starting a 100% legit account.  In all I have over 20 accounts some banned some active.  50/50 on that.  Even the active ones were hacked at some point.  I justified my hacking because I was fucked over early on by tech support.  I had a legit account that faction wars stopped working on and they had me start a new account and told me to switch between the two until it came back.  What ended up happening is one account cloned the other somehow and now I had ""corrupt data"" so they banned both accounts.  Nonsense.  So I hacked from there on out.  Decided to start anew for the new year.  I can't hack anymore anyway unless I really do some research.  My main goal with the hacking was to figure out where I would be if I was legit so when I hacked I would only add the challenges or daily stuff to simulate a real account but never kept up with it so started several more accounts to ""update"" where I'd be if I kept playing at the pace I was.

Anyway I still play and it is probably my worst addictive habit.  It is my heroin.  I want to stop but can't.  Especially if I found a way to hack again.  Pretty sure I could but not actively seeking that out feels like a positive step.  The only reason I learned jailbreaking was because of this game. It made me do things out of the ordinary for my life which proves it is a dangerous device for my life. I need some sort of AA group to get me away from it."

 ""There are probably examples of it we were not consciously aware of. But at a certain point we have Walt vomiting and he puts down a hand towel to kneel on. That is an exact visual echo of something Gus Fring did when he was vomiting to get the poison out of his system \[after poisoning Don Eladio and his capos in the season-four episode 'Salud'\]."" 

That's Vince Gilligan on the subject.  While the  visual is there as a wink to the audience of a previous event, there is no way of knowing if it was or was not something Walter had done before.  The argument is whether he takes on the characteristics of his ""victims"" and Gilligan himself has stated they were not consciously aware of doing it intentionally other than the Fring one which was a nod and not as if Fring described this behavior to Walt and then Walt decided to adopt it.  

Try to follow along instead of bandwagonning on the wrong side of the downvotes.  The person that was trying to argue with me replied to two separate messages with one stating that they believe Walter ""becomes"" his victims and then in the other states they agree with me.   So no ""they're not right you know"".  They are wholeheartedly incorrect as per the show runner."

todayilearned,fcpcu7r,t1_fcoubc3,1577858628.0,No. Anonymous means anonymous. My therapist shared things that were private and ended up costing me thousands of dollars.  You can’t take a creed and then find loopholes in it to support your case.  If John and Eminem are in AA it should be shielded especially if one is supervising the other. Zero anonymity means we are all subject to outside judgement and its wrong.

He got KC a bye and Ive never had a problem with him but lets not pretend he did something amazing unless being a serviceable qb that can get a job anywhere is a miraculous feat.

aww,fcnqdd3,t1_fcne5vp,1577816450.0,I have a drawer full of utensils including a handheld can opener.  I have never used the can opener for my cats food but somehow she equates the noise from it as something relatable to food.  I can open the drawer and move everything around and she doesn’t budge from her slumber but as soon as I grab the can opener she comes running.  It is odd because I can’t hear the distinct noise it must make to catch her ear and as I said before I have never utilized this device in any of her feedings.
