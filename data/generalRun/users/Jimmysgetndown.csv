There are spoiler warnings and NSFW warning and trigger warnings all the time on Reddit and this sub has nothing to do with the NFL or the president. It’s pretty easy to see how you could expect to scroll for a couple minutes while you turn on your TV And stuff... right? I’m for real confused what I did. But maybe redditors are only out to call names? Maybe I didn’t put a weird combo of symbols at the end of my post to make everybody not call names?
Now downvote me quick instead of letting me know why. HURRY. Before I can actually learn something  and change myself or my expectations!"
facepalm,fgeu8y8,t1_fgeqhf9,1580710211.0,"I’m not actually upset about it, moderately bummed at best.

Are you talking about withholding funds, from Egypt following their revolution? Arab spring is I remember right.

With your beliefs of what happened, why do you think that makes Trump’s abuse of power okay? Because if any president does something impeachable, I believe that they should be impeached and given an honest bipartisan trial in front of congress based on what every senator believes is is best for America not their reelection or what makes their voters feel good. Do you disagree and if so, why?

WhitePeopleTwitter,fej6s29,t1_fej6808,1579159240.0,"Yeah, I think you are missing something. And YTA if you’re not actually reading what people are saying.

You said in your first comment “These things won’t work. They will leave our economy in a shambles.”

Then later admitted to not know about the topic.

Then later tried to insinuate that those two comments were somehow in the same location in the thread, when they were pretty far apart through the thread. I think either you’re doing it on purpose to seem more right and more honest, or you’re just confused about how the conversation has turned, as happens all the time on the internet. I don’t care which it is, and I’m not trying to be rude, I’m just trying to figure out what people think and why.

So what makes you think these things will leave our economy in shambles?"
entertainment,fej6acr,t1_feiridg,1579158636.0,I didn’t know he did either. People are talking like I’m crazy for not know that the guy I’ve only ever known to have at least partial facial hair had a cleft lip.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fej5kl6,t1_fej3a7o,1579157783.0,"They mean before that. Saying “I don’t know about this topic, but this won’t work” is very different then two different comments saying “this won’t work” and then “idk about this topic”.

I’m not trying to say you don’t know anything, and I don’t know a lot. But you’re right that as the system is, universal healthcare is impossible. But that’s why the system would obviously change too. I saw an article that said the savings would be noticeable for the average American within the first year. I don’t have the link but I think it was front page earlier today.

And the system would change at least a little bit right away, and then adjust to meet needs. The article was talking about like prices changing over time and stuff but I don’t remember all of that junk, and I didn’t read the whole thing tbh. But even if the system still charges 6k to stay in a room, and the government pays for it then it doesn’t matter. They’ll get the same enormous discount that the insurance companies get now, and I’ll finally be able to get this diarrhea checked out. Plus money doesn’t have value.... so it’s 6,000 pieces of thin air to know if I’m dyin’."
trashy,feiys48,t1_feixxj6,1579151028.0,"Tried to add this next paragraph as a second comment but I guess there’s a time limit on commenting. Oops. 

And (I’m saying) that downvoting things just because they’re not exactly what you think, believe, or even know is a great way for everybody to keep thinking they’re right. But that’s only my point because of the thread’s progress and my own comments, not based on OP’s post. But you get wtf I’m saying.

Bill Burr sometimes gets me too. But I think This is veering kinda far off topic, idk if this is super weird for reddit but if you want to message me and keep talking privately that’d be sweet. I’m trying really hard to learn what beliefs of mine are from being trapped in echo chambers, since I’ve been learning a lot of my beliefs in the past were wrong, misinformed, and sometimes outright hurtful to others. I’m just trying to get to know what more people think, and I’ve been getting really frustrated with running into dead ends, so if you want to just talk about whatever random stuff that’d be really cool to me.

Thanks for the downvotes, I can tell it’s because what I said was aggressive and/or didn’t advance the conversation, and was NOT in fact downvoted because I’m somebody that expressed a different, honest view of things while pointing out my own gaps in knowledge. Being kind, and honest online while trying to learn about other people really is paying off. Thank you. /s"

politics,fehwxpu,t1_fehwam3,1579125503.0,"Wel you can check out the ICC, but per the US agreements with the UN, and ICC, the president himself is on trial and the US will be task with making sure he is punished. I believe it’s in the US to actually deliver him to Hague for punishment, but I might understand that wrong and the US would punish him ourselves.

I agree. I think Americans need to follow Hong Kong’s lead. He’s not treated remotely similarly to citizens, and voters seem to think that’s okay. You’re supposed to elect a peer, not somebody whose never had any of your experiences. Just cuz he’s American does not mean he represents us or our interests."
trashy,fehvzme,t1_feheoon,1579124968.0,"Whataboutism, but I’ll try and explain anyways. The reason it’s different is because the time difference, and the source. He’s a comedian that talks about pop culture and rips on everybody, she’s a coke head that doesn’t make jokes about those kind of things (that I know of after looking around, but idk who tf she is besides a talk show host).

It’s like if Maury tried making “hey everybody I’m Chinese” jokes, and you were like “Well Dave Chappell did it!” They’re different sources at different times for different audiences. That’s why It’s different.

These efforts should be called out for what they are: gross climate denial,” Peter Gleick, a climate scientist and co-founder of Pacific Institute in California.

Just a brief snippet from the article somebody shared with you that I reckon you never read. It’s toward the end after explaining how the fires and climate change are a vicious cycle that’s constantly worsening.

If you have a reason you think climate change isn’t responsible for the fires, I’d love to see why."
politics,fehhkmc,t1_fehff8j,1579116681.0,"So from what I understand, Trump would be on trial himself, not the US as a whole, and held accountable, along with I’m assuming some advisors of his since he just picked the option they laid. If convicted of a Crime of Aggression (It is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, integrity or independence of another State), it would be on the US to make sure he gets arrested and transported to wherever.

Realistically I don’t think it’ll get far through trial, and the more realistic looking future is Lev Parnas’ documents and phone records being the end of Trump’s reign instead of ICC finding him quilts of a crime. And if convicted somehow, I could see the US not complying and claiming some sort of pardon or immunity. Hopefully Americans will actually make him go, instead of getting online and saying “we should do something guys!”, but I doubt that personally."

Damnthatsinteresting,fefj13m,t1_feezt1h,1579057346.0,"Idk about completely wrong, but I know most people don’t want healthcare only from the government. They still want private coverage for people that can afford it, and then basic coverage provided to all of those who can’t. Then the industry would have another competitor (the govt), not fewer, that is providing services they need to compete with at a price point that they’ll have to compete with as well. 

But at the moment, Hospitals and the like up their costs because the insurance companies agree to pay those costs at a heavy discount. Like buying in bulk, Costco style health insurance. Which on the surface might look fine, but without insurance you’re left grossly overpaying for basic needs because you get no such discount"

australia,fecyyjd,t1_feauf1h,1578990470.0,"And for the record I don’t think knocking somebody out is better than hog tying them. Clarifying because I feel like a bit of a jerk.

I think hitting somebody to defend yourself or somebody else or your stuff makes sense. But if you had time and control of the situation to hogtie somebody like this, you probably weren’t in danger and had no reason to do it. It didn’t protect OP, or their stuff. I think it wasn’t up to OP to do this and that this was potentially permanently traumatizing for the person tied up, because who knows what they’re gonna do to him once he’s tied up and at the mercy of a random person to not hurt them. I know they’re a thief but I can understand theft. I can’t understand tying somebody up and making them potentially fear for their life because they were going to take your stuff.

I honestly am not out here to be a jerk. I honestly think this was morally wrong of OP. I hope you guys explain your side instead of downvoting and twisting words. Honestly, I think reddit should still be a place for talking and admitting when you’re wrong. I just don’t think I am."

Now idk who the person they were saying it to was so I don’t have an opinion about this specific case, but as a concept I totally get it in the gamer community. I think it depends on the person you’re saying it to. If my SO died and I had strangers saying F, that would be super sweet to me.
