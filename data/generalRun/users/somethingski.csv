When I come back the energy changes immediately. There's some eerie stuff at work here. I always think of the song, Hotel California. ""You can check out anytime you like but you can never leave""

Whats more strange is it seems the longer people stay here, the more brainwashed by it they become. Never really owning anything, never really doing anything. It's such a closed off elite club running the show with no real shot at getting in unless you're chosen. 

I think they feed off fear, and are slowly trying to turn the world into a hellscape so they can stay young and full while we slave for them. I think Buddha and Jesus tried to give us the message. 

""The kingdom of heaven is within"" meaning, your paradise can be created by consciousness alone. Unlock your mind to its potential and your thoughts will manifest into this reality. When we have that collectively as a whole we can create a society in harmony, rather than a society in fear and chaos."
mentalhealth,fettjoj,t3_eqifmu,1579379904.0,"Not sure, but I theorize it's a lack of empathy as a whole. 

Number 1) we're not taught emotional intelligence really at all -- despite them being completely natural and occuring all the time in the human experience, much like hunger. Imagine if we never taught or discussed the sensation of hunger. We'd all be terrified because we'd think we're some alien who gets a stomach pain every 6 hours, and you have to eat something like an animal to survive. See how dumb that sounds? Look at all the bad shit that happens when we don't talk about sex. 

Number2) As the wage gap widens and more of us fall into the group of have-less or have-nots we all are experiencing hardship and life becoming more of a struggle. Mix this in with a constant bombardment of messages saying ""This is what you need to be happy, or feeling this way? Buy this! Or look this way!"" 
Or we watch tv or scroll through social media and see people ""living the life"" and rather than seeing ourselfs as part of our direct communities and how we fit into that, we see performers as our peers and we get angry with ourselves when we can't ""keep"" up or we don't fit that mold. It starts to feel like despite everything you do its not enough. So we start to look at people who aren't pulling their weight to make it happen. 

This creates a perfect concoction of misplaced anger. Once angry it's easy to be swayed and manipulated by things. Its easy to not listen and jump to rash decisions because we're hurt. So we blame groups of people who we don't understand. The truth is we're all hurt. No one is out to get us, and everything is perception. The dark leads to light and light to dark in an endless dance of harmony. We all go in the end so really we're just competing with ourselves.

We need patience and understanding more than ever, especially with our world at stake. 

TL;DR We need more emotional intelligence, patience, and positivity. Move forward with love."

acting,fc339ru,t3_efwjsi,1577380421.0,"I reccomend some Meisner training. Meisner is about acting truthfully in imaginary circumstances. The repetition excercises teach you the the words are meaningless are just a tool to connect with your partner. Inward emotional journey acting can takes you out of a scene and often times puts you in a position where you're no longer reacting, but waiting for your turn. This is why I personally think Daniel Day Lewis is not as good as someone like Philip Seymour Hoffman or Denzel. You can tell he's not listening because infatuated with his own emotional journey. He does it really well, but when you learn to let go use your imagination and be in the moment like a zen master you get to a whole new level in your performances. 

The trick is to do all that work and let it go when you get up there. 

Remember when you were a kid playing pretend? You didn't have a script but you were able to pretend a full story probably just with your imagination. Same idea."

Makes sense, those are also traits that make you an amazing actor. Intelligence, manipulation, and understanding basic human conditioning. 

When I was in school I had a good friend who's roommate was sexually harassed by Kevin Spacey. He was touring Richard III in Australia and his roommate was cast opposite Spacey's Richard III. Young actor, this was a big break. One night after the performance he approached by one of Spacey's people. They told him Spacey wanted to see him. He went met with him and Spacey told him if he did not have sex with him and perform sexual favors he was going to be replaced in the production. He also said he was a very powerful person in the industry and he didn't want to get on his bad side if he ever wanted a career.

LateStageCapitalism,fbxy9ry,t3_eexu9r,1577203597.0,"Being poor cost interest, while being wealthy usually generates a passive income. 

That information alone show's why capitalism at it's core is immoral. 

You are forcing humans into a life of service just so they can survive. Before capitalism took over the average work day was around 4-6 hours, scattered throughout the day. So many breaks, many moments of downtime, and most importantly the labor was so much more rewarding because 1) you're working for yourself and 2) you are directly seeing the immediate reward of your work. 

What's more wrong is we all become accomplices in some of the biggest human rights violations the world as ever seen. Especially in America where we import all of our products. Poor people are forced to buying cheap which usually means it was made by underpaid labor or there was some very questionable shit along the way.

The gift giving tradition goes back to ancient rome before they converted to christianity. Once Constantine converted the empire it became part of the new Christian winter solstice celebration. 

Soo, if you're giving gifts you're celebrating a Christian holiday. If you look at the story of christ christmas is about his birth. A birth of humilty. Wandering, born in an animal stable, had nothing. 

That's a far cry from today and how we have Christmas commercials in October. The more we monetize the more we fall from our spiritual center. Money is not natural and is a tool for use, while spirit connects everything in the cosmos."
