During the life of any heart this line keeps changing place; sometimes it is squeezed one way by exuberant evil and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space for good to flourish. One and the same human being is, at various ages, under various circumstances, a totally different human being. At times he is close to being a devil, at times to sainthood.

But people who complete dismiss the American contribution are wrong too. There really was a chance that the Kaiserschlacht could've succeeded in a few places and the sheer weight of the impending fresh manpower had a disastrous effect on German morale and bolstered that of the French and British. Was it decisive? I don't know, and I've seen far more competent historians than I argue effectively for both positions. I do, however love the various colorful stories of jaded and disillusioned European soldiers being confronted with an American army that was more or less where they used to be before 1914, still reveling in the pageantry and glory. That re-infusion of ""gung ho"" attitudes and pomp at this late stage, complete with officers running around with swords and refusing to duck bullets really does add an interesting dimension. Below I've included one of my favorite passages of this sort. I'll try to find some of the better first hand ones when I get home.

>Curiously, it was the Americans, the newcomers, who picked the spot where the third German onslaught would come. The Chemin des Dames ridge, north of the Aisne, was so formidable a natural stronghold that the French had manned it with four divisions of their least reliable troops and three exhausted British divisions sent south for a rest. It happened that this was the sector closest to Paris. Ludendorff’s plan was to hit it so hard that every French reserve would be committed to the defense of the capital, and when that happened he was going to wheel and drive Haig into the sea. His preparations were superb. The American prediction that a great assault on the ridge was imminent was dismissed by Foch because there wasn’t a trace of activity in the German lines in that sector. Observation posts reported nothing, aerial photographs were a blank. Apparently there weren’t even any enemy batteries. Actually, there were nearly four thousand heavy Krupp guns there. You just couldn’t see them. Moving at night and hiding in woods during the day, with horses’ hooves wrapped in rags and the sounds of creaking gun carriages masked by cages of croaking frogs, Ludendorff had massed forty-one crack divisions in a wild weald of giant trees opposite the ridge and entrusted the command to Crown Prince Rupprecht. At one o’clock in the morning of Thursday, April 25, the war’s heaviest bombardment opened up and continued for nearly three hours. Before it ended, at 3:40 A.M., some of the defenders were raving, literally out of their minds. Pétain’s local commander had erred in stationing his men too far forward, where they were naked to the artillery cannonade, and in failing to establish defenses in depth. The Germans swarming up the slope behind a tornado of gas and shrapnel found that the Allied forces had virtually disintegrated. And there appeared to be nothing behind them but open country. The Germans were stupefied.   
>  
>The Allied center was a void. Nothing like this had been seen in four years of trench warfare. Ludendorff, receiving their almost incredible report, sensed that what he had meant to be a feint could lead to swift victory. He shifted his gaze from Flanders to Paris. The Allied reserve in this part of the line comprised seven French and two other tired British divisions. It was pitifully inadequate. The Germans, with their vast superiority in numbers and morale, overran them. To the further astonishment of the attackers, the bridges over the Aisne were intact. On their flank, near Soissons, some French resistance was developing, but the center continued to gape wide open. By dusk that Thursday they had advanced ten miles and were on the Vesle. The French capital was eighty miles away. In the morning they crossed the Vesle, whose fine bridges were also undamaged, and surged onward, hobnail boots thumping and feldgrau trousers swishing weirdly in the sunshine. By May 30, when Soissons fell, they had overrun five French lines. On June 3 they were back on the Marne for the first time in nearly four years, the tip of their salient at a place called Château-Thierry. Churchill wrote Clementine: “The fate of the capital hangs in the balance—only 45 miles away.”  
>  
> **At this point, writes Cyril Falls, the British military historian, “something astonishing happened. Up the Marne came marching new men. They were two divisions only, but they strode proudly through the flotsam and jetsam always present on the fringe of a stricken battlefield…. They were fine-looking men and even the rawest had a soldierly air.” The first Americans had arrived. Their vanguard was a brigade of U.S. Marines, an odd mix of tough professionals and Ivy League students who, like their Oxford and Cambridge counterparts of 1914—most of whom were now dead or maimed—had enlisted the week after their country entered the war. As they formed their line of battle an elderly French peasant shouted at them: “La guerre est finie!” “Pas finie!” a Harvard undergraduate shouted back, giving the sector its name. For five days the marines held five miles of Pas Finie against the gray enemy columns which came hurtling across the wheat field. Then they counterattacked, driving five divisions of Germans back through a boulder-strewn, gully-laced forest called Belleau Wood. Only one in four survived unscratched. More than a hundred were decorated for heroism. The French renamed the wood for them. Six days later doughboys recaptured the village of Vaux, on the other side of Château-Thierry. The crown prince ordered a halt and then a general withdrawal.**   
>  
>Thus ended the last of Ludendorff’s sledgehammer blows. Early in July he launched a Friedensturm, or peace offensive, sending fifty-six divisions in a pincer movement around Reims. But Foch had developed new defensive tactics, posting thinly held forward positions to confuse the enemy and then decimating the advancing German infantry with precise artillery strikes. Moreover, ten thousand American soldiers were now disembarking every day. They reached Reims in strength, and the Germans, after initial successes, were thrown back. Returning from the front, Churchill told an audience at the Central Hall, Westminster: “When I have seen during the past few weeks the splendour of American manhood striding forward on all the roads of France and Flanders, I have experienced emotions which words cannot describe.” Britain would claim no fruits of victory, he said, no “territorial or commercial advantage,” only the “supreme reconciliation” of Englishmen and Americans. “That is the reward of Britain,” he said. “That is the lion’s share.” He wrote Sinclair the following week: “If all goes well, England and U.S. may act permanently together. We are living 50 years in one at this rate.”

If the system is set up so that only the """"best"""" can vote, then it makes sense to exclude people convicted of serious crimes. In the modern day, most people feel strongly about the whole universal suffrage one person one vote thing so that's more or less how we've made it. The system isn't designed for that however, there's nothing in the Constitution about the right to vote being unconditional, for instance. Which is a roundabout way of saying that it's largely an anachronism, which will probably be eliminated in the next twenty years."

todayilearned,fdg2xe6,t1_fdfqnb7,1578378036.0,"I am shocked, shocked I tell you, that a Catholic nun doesn’t support contraception and glorified suffering! Everyone knows that the Catholic Church has a strongly pro contraception policy and certainly doesn’t claim to be founded by a God that was tortured to death, and whose religion was characterized by violent execution for the first few centuries, and continues to exalt martyrs and those whose suffer. The fact that such an organization would chose a woman who so diverges from their anti-suffering values to be a saint boggles my mind."

usa,fd3yjqc,t1_fd3vfrf,1578162775.0,"Yep those Black and Tans were a super diplomatic way of dealing with the IRA. Of course once you guys used diplomacy and actually got Michael Collins to the table, he was just executed by the IRA and more violence ensued. Then after de Valera used WWII to declare independence there was another fifty odd years of undiplomatic low level conflict in NI include Bloody Sunday when your paras opened fire on 28 unarmed civilians, again not a diplomatic way of handling terrorists. Just because of one agreement in the 90s after almost a century of guerrilla warfare I don’t think you get to say that the IRA was handled with diplomacy."
