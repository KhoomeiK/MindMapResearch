startrek,ffef9f5,t3_esqaoa,1579845781.0,"Best parts of the episode were Picard and Data and the Nostalgia that hit me like a truck. The writing was pretty bad and the plot seemed a cliche, second rate JJ Abrahams style mystery plot. The visuals looked nice and fairly believably star trek like. 

&#x200B;

Overall, I give it a 6/10 for the episode due to its effective use of nostalgia. 3/10 as a hook for the rest of the season as I only have a vague interest in seeing what happens but not terribly excited for it. I got a free trial for CBS All Access just to see this episode and I don't intend to renew.

gaming,ffa7xe5,t1_ffa6vs1,1579729624.0,"Nah, I disagree completely. Lootboxes are fun because gambling is fun, if the developers can get the player to want the items inside the box and allow them to gamble something to get it, it's fun. Problem is when what you're gambling is irl money. I don't think any game's really done non predatory lootboxes well because all of em always have real money purchase options.

&#x200B;

You gotta allow the player to farm the currency for the lootboxes and then give them an option to spend the currency on either lootboxes or something else they need in game. Then when they choose to spend it on lootboxes it feels like gambling without the irl money involved. Do that and don't include real money purchases and it can be a lotta fun imo."
