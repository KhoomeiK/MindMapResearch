actuallesbians,ffdifc0,t1_ffdi6r8,1579821535.0,"See this is weird because I've dated guys shorter than me (by an inch or two), they were fine. The one person who hated my height and would have a breakdown (not exaggerating) if I even considered wearing heels was a woman! I'm sure the opposite is generally more true but in my experience guys seem to like it more? Maybe I just haven't met decent women?"
actuallesbians,ffdhgtx,t1_ffdgnju,1579820954.0,"See I'm 5""10 and that gives me hope that someone will appreciate me for the Amazon I am"
actuallesbians,ffd892v,t1_ffc2872,1579815342.0,I put my height in my tinder profile so I don't have to deal with guys or girls who have a complex about being shorter than me. And you can bet your ass that I turn up on the first date in heels
BeautyGuruChatter,fex0rbp,t1_feuqvix,1579422448.0,I may have little money but I am satisfied and happy with my life. I don't think I can say the same for him. If you don't have substance in your life all the money in the world won't mean shit
tolkienfans,feolzou,t1_feojzcd,1579301981.0,I'm sure there are other factors but I've heard the higher ups wanted more money
lotrmemes,felzzoq,t1_fekyyj1,1579235414.0,"Published and edited. He took his father's unfinished notes and tried to put them together to form a followable narrative.

There are some people who dispute the Silmarillion as canon as there were different versions of some of the stories it contains and CT had to decide himself what would become canon. I think he did an amazing job personally and the book adds so much value to the world"
lotrmemes,felzsdm,t1_fekqpyd,1579235244.0,"It made me so angry to see people bash him for not allowing a silmarillion adaptation. People were acting like he was this awful, cruel, vindictive arsehole who was doing it out of spite. Like uh nope he was trying to protect his father's vision that he himself had been involved in developing. I think if anyone had a right to do so it was him. He was an amazing man and I think so many people take his work on releasing his father's notes and unfinished works for granted"
lotrmemes,felzl0b,t1_fekoxe7,1579235071.0,You win all the awards
lotrmemes,felw1u2,t1_felw08g,1579232361.0,I did. Do I need to get my boss to confirm?
lotrmemes,felv3vb,t3_epmna2,1579231685.0,I read this at work and spent half an hour bent over sobbing. This man and his father are the reason I'm alive and I owe them so much.
BeautyGuruChatter,felayu1,t1_fek5twp,1579217939.0,"I have a friend who's dietician is on the whole starvation mode is a thing, can't lose weight because of hormones so fix it with keto bullshit. I tried to mention calorie defect and she refused to acknowledge it was a thing and I would gain the weight I've lost back. Meanwhile she's had a gastric bypass and has GAINED weight. She says she hardly eats but I struggle to believe that because I've eaten out with her before. You don't gain weight after weight loss surgery without fucking up"
Showerthoughts,fejm15a,t1_fejevpc,1579179443.0,"Both my parent's birthdays are back to back 9 months before both mine and my sister's birthdays... We're three days apart. My sister was also a surprise because my mum was on birth control too. The only thing that made me feel better was the look on my Dad's face when I boughy it up in front of his siblings... He had never put two and two together and spent a good ten minutes with his head in his hands and his face beet red while everyone laughed. Sorry not sorry dad, if I had to suffer so do you"
fatlogic,fejjue1,t1_fehr78r,1579177247.0,"I find that intuitive eating just straight up doesn't work for me. I'm either craving EVERYTHING, or I've got exercise-induced appetite reduction and I'm eating half of what I should be to not loose 1-2kg a week (currently at 77kg and my doctor wants me to lose 500g max). If I was doing what my body was currently telling me, I only would have eaten 1000 calories today despite burning 3500ish. But yeah tell me again how calorie counting is ALWAYS bad? The reality is calorie counting is essential for some people. And that's ok!"
BeautyGuruChatter,fejg1an,t1_feii0jk,1579172483.0,"I've been losing weight and I've had people ask me for my secrets. They always get disapointed when I tell them I eat super healthy, have an active job AND workout daily. Like those teas and body hacks don't mean shit. Losing weight (or even gaining it for some people) is simple but not easy. If it was everyone would have their dream body."
BeautyGuruChatter,fejd8no,t1_fegf1oo,1579168282.0,"I find with essence mascaras that they work better after I've taken some of the product off the spoolie with a tissue. Then, no clumps, just beautiful lashes!"
