crappycontouring,ffncvg1,t1_ffhdhwm,1580064409.0,That’s exactly where it came from!

IWantToLearn,fefqzaq,t3_eov92z,1579062676.0,"Ok I am one of those people who absolutely hates any type of exercise, especially running. My husband loves running, and has taught me a lot that has made it bearable.

The best advice he gave me is look ahead and not at your feet, breathe slow and even, and don’t take breaks just jog slower even if it’s at a snails pace because when you take a break it’s twice as hard to get going again.

Get good running shoes, it’ll make a huge difference. 

The first few times will absolutely suck if you do it right but then it gets easier and easier and you will be amazed at what your body can do. I went from not being able to jog half a mile to jogging 4 miles with no breaks and only stoping at 4 miles because I got bored in just 2 months.  

Believe in yourself and do not give up. And always push a little harder than the last time but don’t overdo it. It gets easier. It really does!!"
IWantToLearn,fefqo31,t3_eor5py,1579062440.0,"My German teacher would tell me to find germans online and video chat with them. 
A lot of the time they’re happy to help, as you make a new friend out of it. Talk about basic stuff you know a bit about then they can slowly move to new subjects. They can also help you on the spot with pronouncing words correctly and slang. Like “Wie geht’s” instead of “Wie geht es dir”, when the app would likely teach you the longer more formal/polite version. But if you’re approaching friends you’d be more likely to use the slang. The apps teach you to be incredibly polite which is great but talking to an actual German will teach you to talk more comfortably with friends and acquaintances. 
That and actually going there obviously, which isn’t always an option but it helps tons. I learned a lot I went as a short term exchange student. My host dad pretended he couldn’t speak English so we played a lot of charades. On my last day there he hugged me and told me he wished me the best in life and gave me some life advice in perfect English. It blew my mind, he could understand me the whole time I was there but refused to let me speak English around him. It helped a lot even if I was confused most of the time!"
YouShouldKnow,fdm1xwc,t1_fdlepyl,1578537872.0,How it’s my husband or his friends fault that I was going 80 in a 55 and found my dumbass behind a cop is beyond me but my husband and his friends are fantastic people. Thanks for the concern I guess!
YouShouldKnow,fdl6ccn,t1_fdkghsb,1578517798.0,"I said those exact words... then he pulled over, let me go ahead of him, then pulled me over. 

He was looking for drunks so he told me to slow down and be safe. Bout a half a year later my husband brings home a new friend and it’s non other than the guy who pulled me over. He just looked at me and laughed. So embarrassing...."
LifeProTips,fdij5ys,t3_el72bt,1578444093.0,"As a wife who often finds herself in these situations, I can say this works and can be tailored to different relationships. 

My husband wanted to buy another race car and he has his heart set on one a few states away. Finally, he told me we would make a whole vacation (I love travel) over picking it up, and now I’m planning a fun vacation, and he gets to get his car. I can’t believe I fell for it, but I did and I’m still excited. 

We have been at ends for months about this car and honestly I’m looking forward to traveling so much that I let go the resentment towards the car without realizing it. It helped me see the car will make him just as happy as the travel makes me. Worth it!"
LifeProTips,fdihc2s,t3_elh8h2,1578442924.0,"On the other hand if everyone is walking/moving (especially at you) here’s a tip to pave your own way:

Look at where you are headed and do not look away, pick a straight path, and do not falter. Look straight through the people coming at you. People move. Some at the very last minute but most often they do. Even big tall tough guys move for my 5’5” female self. 

Walk with a purpose and people will notice and respect it, even if they don’t know they are doing it."

YouShouldKnow,fcw7uq8,t1_fcvo0yd,1578019148.0,"You might be able to strike a deal with someone with very specific rules that I would write down and agree on beforehand if you expect something expensive to be found. 

It takes hours to get anything much less something cool worth taking home only to give up half. A lot of people don’t do it for the money, but the chase and the treasure to keep. 

Generally when I detect on someone’s land I clean it for them while I do my thing, I take all trash I find (provided I can carry it out). They don’t take what I find, and it’s agreed on earlier. But I’m sure you could find someone, but it’s not about the money most times it’s about the find. I don’t know many people who intend to sell what they find. 

I guess you could hire someone to do it, that might suit your purpose better!  

Lots of factors but generally, at least for me, property owners never ask for what I find unless they ask me to come out to find something g specific for them, like a lost ring or jewelry. Hope that helps, everyone is different so that’s just my take on it :)"
Instagramreality,fcrszlf,t1_fcrphwa,1577906211.0,"Ok maybe but her foot is 500% fucked up and that’s from squishing a segment to make her leg look smaller, but it shrunk her foot too."
AmItheAsshole,fbyujje,t1_fby46vs,1577226706.0,"He didn’t plan that she would add something last minute. Not to mention she decided to cause a scene just as much as him. She could have easily written it off. Doesn’t matter if it was $1 or $100 it’s someone elses money she was spending.

Furthermore he sounds like a person who likes the mess around (and most of the time obviously to when is the time and the place) and she got serious and in defense he did too. It was a joke that turned serious and they were both too stubborn to deescalate it. 


Either way they definitely don’t sound good together and they’ll be better off on their own."
