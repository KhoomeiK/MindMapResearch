DotA2,ffdwc6d,t1_ffdvszf,1579830546.0,"Where are you getting 8 seconds? Dragon scale is 3 seconds at 12 dps, so it does 36. Liquid fire is 5, so one burn duration still takes place over only 5 seconds. Where is 8 coming from?"
DotA2,ffdvckh,t1_ffdis89,1579829848.0,They didnt even start drafting for several minutes after this. It was clearly just joking around by everyone involved.
DotA2,ffdgolx,t1_ffd2c5o,1579820483.0,">Kinda okay until the fucking jakiro got it. One single item that empower his E 1.5 times in term of BUILDING DMG. That shit spits on your tower, it literally melts as building has zero magic resistance and jakiro E deals full MAGIC DMG to building.
I do like the idea of neutral item. I dont like the idea of a random neutral drops buff a specific hero potential 1.5 times

I don't know where you are getting this. Dragon scale does 36 damage to towers per burn duration. Level one Liquid Fire does 60. Level four does 120. So with both it does 96/156. Where is the 1.5x? The item is no better on jak than any other hero. And it is a pretty mediocre/bad item to begin with."
DotA2,ffc5csn,t1_ffc51ko,1579791900.0,Yes thank you for repeating what I said. They know apex is the game. They know it increases their chance of winning. Why not wait for it like they did?
DotA2,ffc4vjm,t1_ffc4h5x,1579791580.0,"Only cause in 60 minute games teams that have a already huge lead know that if they wait 10 minutes and keep map control, their chances of winning go even higher."
DotA2,ffc4b0y,t1_ffc3qqt,1579791191.0,"Sniper can't even leave base: ""in control ""


You has those comebacks because teams got impatient.  Liquid wasn't being impatient. Why would you not wait 10 minutes for a higher chance of winning the game rather than full committing beforehand with a lower chance of winning? They just waited till they had the highest chance to full commit. It is the same reason teams with huge leads would wait for roshan to go high ground."

DotA2,ff4b5i2,t1_ff46mw4,1579559516.0,So you think this gives an unfair advantage? That teams aren't already studying their future matchups?

And all of them staggered. Not one. That would mean one game ran 15 one 30 one 45 and one 60 to have them all off at the same time. Chances are slim."
DotA2,fez1gzp,t1_feyww70,1579453047.0,"Hes not saying stagger them hours apart. He's saying stagger the starting times say ~15 minutes apart. This would result in at least one game being on average, and push the end time back maybe 45 minutes."

That said, don't just try to counter PL with Zeus in your pubs, without any good supports/offlaner to protect him, because if PL manages to get on top of him, it isn't pretty."

ProgrammerHumor,fesg3lm,t1_ferol5e,1579364823.0,"OpenAI said in their AMA that it didn't learn from those matches, they were just used for benchmarking purposes."
ProgrammerHumor,ferexw5,t1_fer27bj,1579353104.0,"It isn't true though. OpenAI wasn't given anymore map vision than players were, and they had a reaction time forced to be slightly slower than the average pro player. 

Now what kind of sullies OpenAI's true ability to beat players, is that certain items (such as manta style, which creates illusions and dispels the user) were banned from the matches, and the hero pool was limited to about 10% of total available heroes. 

The reason for this being, it would increase computation time for each item, and that OpenAI would be able to micro illusions *perfectly* and would make it even harder on players. At the same time this also meant players were restricted from using some of the most popular items. 

The hero pool being restricted was necessary because each one added to the pool exponentially adds computation time. 

Now what is really neat is it wasn't one program 'instance' playing all five of the enemy heroes, but one for each one. Meaning they had to interact with each other through game play and assuming the other instance would make the proper move. 

It was actually really neat to watch. VODs of all the matches against pros are on youtube, and some were casted with the idea that people watching them aren't necessarily dota players, I suggest people actually watch them and read about OpenAI rather than reading the swaths of misinformation in this thread."

DotA2,fedpzyo,t1_fed3fof,1579017385.0,"I dont know if the same holds true, but back when they were still liquid, they had a heavy preference for getting dire side and had a ~7-8% higher winrate being on dire. This was true even when radiant normally had a higher winrate."
DotA2,fe5y3ee,t1_fe5v6x9,1578877515.0,"Yeah. Same people who hated on Ana probably. I doubted w33ha when he was in DC. Then he got second at TI. He was pretty solid then. I was very iffy on him replacing Matu because for one i want the longest running squad to stay together, and because i like Matu. But the team obviously needed a change.
 Then w33ha showed up and Liquid got to a much higher placement than I expected out of them with Matu. So I'd say w33 is pretty solid. And people want to discount his performance, on a completely different patch, on the first tournament they participated in. 
This just looked like standard liquid to me. It can get a little sloppy, but they still come out on top."
