My boss that day was Muslim and I hadn't told him I was cooking for the team. He came into the canteen and asked if he could have some beans on toast as he obviously couldn't have the pork sausages or the bacon that was in one of the pans on the stove. I opened the oven door and told him I was grilling his vegetarian sausages and turkey rashers and I had checked they were halal. I almost cried at how touched he was when he said 'not many people remember when they do big work dinners.   Told him I had checked who was working and who was Muslim/veggie/vegan/GF and tried to cater for everyone so the team could all sit down and eat together."

unitedkingdom,fdzbxwd,t1_fdv9ffd,1578788592.0,I've always thought it wouldn't last (bad I know) but only because I thought the pressure of it all would get to them. Living in that intense pressure cooker of a family must be horrendous and the stress must drive a wedge between them. I feel for Meghan. She's not had it easy and I totally get why they want to step back.
unitedkingdom,fdzb64w,t1_fdw24bh,1578788426.0,"Which is why they have buggered off. Don't care for the monachy to be honest, but can't say I blame them.

I've stopped countless times to buy something for a homeless person and they have always asked for food for their dog if they have one instead of for themselves. These animals are sometimes all they have and they would starve to keep their dogs happy. Look at Street Vet on instragram and you'll see how well cared most of those dogs are.

One day, the house was burgled. The dogs just sat that as the house was ransacked and the burglar went through all the rooms stealing what he could. The burglar got out of the house in one piece.  On his attempt to escape via the large wall, one of the pooches grabbed him and bit him on the femoral artery and he bled out and was dead on police arrival.  He was the gardener and knew the dogs.

It seems as though he thought he could burgle the place because the dogs knew him. He could burgle the place because the dogs just bided their time until he tried to make good his escape..."
