InfertilityBabies,fgmebbj,t1_fgmbign,1580922863.0,I asked about it and they said they prefer to do the 12-14 week test because it is more definitive and things like mother's bmi can affect the results. So this is just my offices MO of doing things.
InfertilityBabies,fgm20kz,t1_fglt4hj,1580916363.0,Oh boy. Have a link to share the rage?
InfertilityBabies,fgm1zh6,t3_ez7zyd,1580916343.0,"My ten week NIPT didn't happen. Going to get the free cell DNA test in two weeks. Kind of bummed (and relieved in a way because the free cell test is more definitive). 

In other news, I couldn't do PIO last night. It was just too painful and as being in week 10, I refused. I did a pm crinone shot to shore things up. Anyone else get more sensitive? My husband isn't usually this bad at finding veins or nerves but this week has been a doozy."

HomeImprovement,fgigb7t,t1_fghf7uf,1580820729.0,"I agree! When we had our floors redone, our new neighbors stopped by with wine and small talk to ask about the floors. They had been friends with the old owner and had never known there was nice (but tired) wooden floors underneath."
poshmark,fgid2tl,t3_eynco3,1580817397.0,"It sound exhausting how you pack your items. Mine go in a plastic Gap mailer, maybe a cute post it note with a pig detail, and away it goes. If I did even an ounce more and people treated my reputation like that, I'd lose my shit."
