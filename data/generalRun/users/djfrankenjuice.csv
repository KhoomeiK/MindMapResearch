Edit: [He was given a definition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton–Lewinsky_scandal) 

During the deposition, Clinton was asked ""Have you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit 1?"" The judge ordered that Clinton be given an opportunity to review the agreed definition. Afterwards, based on the definition created by the Independent Counsel's Office, Clinton answered, ""I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky."" Clinton later said, ""I thought the definition included any activity by [me], where [I] was the actor and came in contact with those parts of the bodies"" which had been explicitly listed (and ""with an intent to gratify or arouse the sexual desire of any person"")."

I follow the vets recommendation for a dental procedure on my French bulldog. A breed known for bad hips and backs. And a dog with a specific history of bad hips/back.

Apparently a dental procedure on canines straps the dog down on their back. And they might be just left there for an extended period of time (sedated).

She ended up not being able to walk. We faced the decision of maybe 20-30k on further back exams (which would lead to immediate surgery if correctable, or putting her down) or ... keeping a fairly young dog on bed rest (straight back etc etc... while on pain killers) for nearly a year and hoping it gets better and still possibly putting her down.

Edit: [He was given a definition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clintonâ€“Lewinsky_scandal) 

During the deposition, Clinton was asked ""Have you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit 1?"" The judge ordered that Clinton be given an opportunity to review the agreed definition. Afterwards, based on the definition created by the Independent Counsel's Office, Clinton answered, ""I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky."" Clinton later said, ""I thought the definition included any activity by [me], where [I] was the actor and came in contact with those parts of the bodies"" which had been explicitly listed (and ""with an intent to gratify or arouse the sexual desire of any person"")."

I follow the vets recommendation for a dental procedure on my French bulldog. A breed known for bad hips and backs. And a dog with a specific history of bad hips/back.

Apparently a dental procedure on canines straps the dog down on their back. And they might be just left there for an extended period of time (sedated).

She ended up not being able to walk. We faced the decision of maybe 20-30k on further back exams (which would lead to immediate surgery if correctable, or putting her down) or ... keeping a fairly young dog on bed rest (straight back etc etc... while on pain killers) for nearly a year and hoping it gets better and still possibly putting her down.
