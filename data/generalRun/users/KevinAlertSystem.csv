Hell just look at what the south did in the 60s, long after the federalization reforms after the civil war. When a governor has the power to unilaterally call out armed military brigades in direct opposition to orders from both the supreme court and president, it seems like a bad idea to put the entire federal government under the power of a potential rouge governor.

right, and that's because the founders foresaw a potential issue with one state government controlling access and infrastructure of the national federal government. That is still a potential problem.

The best solution IMO is to make DC just the federal buildings, and let the surrounding state reabsorb the areas that people live. 

I get people living in a metro area like that may not want to be part of virginia or w/e, but that is true for every other metro area too.

a public option is a good compromise on the universal healthcare debate. A public option in the same bill that removes all protections for clean water and clean air is not. The way things get done in DC is both sides looking the other way while they each basically embezzle money from the taxpayers. It's like a bank robber and guard agreeing to split the heist.

I do not see how anyone who cares about human rights, freedom, or democracy would be defending Batista? Yet that is the alternative to Castro. Batista was objectively worse than castro, having thousands more political prisoners tortured and executed, and was far more oppressive against the press and protestors.

The judiciary is intended to settle disputes between the executive and legislative branches. Because the courts were never given a chance to rule on whether or not the executive was legally required to comply with those subpoenas, we currently do not actually know if any lawful order was ignored or obstructed. 

So was there any legal reason why the case was not brought before the courts? If it's all political, even a great political reason, i don't see how you can argue that part is impeachable when no one knows what side the law supports."

The biggest difference between Sander's and the others is that he has a 40 year track record of advocating for these issues, so you know they are deeply held beliefs.

The representatives are suppose to vote for their constituents. If 80% of people in Kentucky oppose removal and McConnell voted for it, that is arguably a subversion of democracy. 

That''s why it's super important that more effort and attention is paid at the local level. Go into those states and convince the voters to do the right thing. Then they're representatives have no choice. Maybe 1/5 is actually irredeemable and can't be convinced, but 49%? no way."
