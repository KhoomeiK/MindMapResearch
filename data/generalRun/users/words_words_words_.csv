I’m definitely wary about losing them because I’ve heard a lot of stories of people losing *multiple* sets. But the good thing is that since they’re a little cheaper, I could less three sets before I’d be paying the full price of one set of real AirPods.

AppleLastNews,fd3fjdw,t1_fd3bq9u,1578157801.0,">	How’s the build quality?

I’ve never held real AirPods to be able to make a comparison, but from what I’ve heard, AirPods have a bit of weight to them. These feel light, and almost exactly like what you’d get if you cut off the earbud of wired headphones. Being so light though, I don’t think much harm would come to them if they were to be dropped a few times. 

>	There’s a lot of pressure to get expensive stuff just like some of the peers at school have, but there’s no way I’m spending $160 - $200 on something that can be lost, stolen, or broken so easily.

You’re a smart and pragmatic parent! I think the biggest hassle will be convincing your kid that name brand =/= best. When I first opened the wrapping from my mom, in my mind I was a little disappointed they weren’t real AirPods, but after using them I couldn’t care less because the sound quality is high enough that I don’t worry. I’m no audiophile, but like I said in my first comment, these sound almost identical to my wired apple headphones, so if that’s an indication of sound quality, they measure up well.

>	But I wanted to get something that actually sounded good and doesn’t LOOK LIKE a cheap knockoff.

The build looks very, *very* similar to AirPods, and when they’re in your kid’s ear, no one will be able to tell they aren’t “real”. Unless someone inspects them for authenticity, no one will be the wiser.

>	These Airsounds Pro were mentioned on the Wendy Williams Show (3:24 minute mark) and looked identical to the 2nd Generation AirPods with the wireless charging case. 

My mom said she heard about them on the Today Show. Apparently they’re making the rounds and their marketing department is working overtime hahaha

>Does it use lightning charging cable?

It does. One actually came with it. It’s obviously not apple brand, so your charging quality might be better if you use an apple brand cord.

>Have you tried the wireless charging with the case?

Not yet! I’m charging the case with the buds in it right now, so that test will have to wait probably. Something of note is that right out of the box, the buds had a 90% charge and the case was almost dead. I charged the case for less than an hour and it’s fully charged now. The marketing says the buds have a four hour charge time, so only time will tell if that’s accurate."

The Bluetooth isn’t nearly as high functioning as name brand AirPods.

According to Christian teachings, Jesus’ death actually “unlocked” heaven, if you will. Before that, anyone who was a follower of God essentially went to a kind of purgatory. It’s believed that when Jesus died, he actually went to that purgatory to bring his followers back with him to heaven. 

Jesus acted as the “sacrifice” for the sins of Christ followers. Before his death, following God was fraught with rituals and religious sacrifices (like doves and sheep), but after Jesus made the ultimate sacrifice - himself, God allowed his blood to cover all the sins of those who accept the sacrifice.

fasting,fc5aga8,t3_ega81a,1577451022.0,">After doing some admittedly-brief research 

Definitely make sure you do some more extensive research while you’re fasting, it will help pass the time at it’s worst and keep you safe at it’s best. 

Since you’ve been doing keto for a few months, tour body should be pretty well far adapted - that’s good. You most likely won’t feel hungry as much as someone going from junk food straight into a fast. 

>I’m aiming for 3 days minimum, and every day I can do after that will be a bonus, with a 10 day maximum

This might be bit of a lofty goal for someone who’s never done a prolonged fast before, but its definitely doable. Make sure you listen to your body and do what’s right for it. This is where research comes into play. Find out what’s a normal amount of discomfort while on a PF and gauge your own discomfort against that. If it seems excessive, there’s no shame in pulling the plug and regrouping. 

>	Any tips to get the most out of it?

Make sure your supplementing with electrolytes starting on the second day. That can be done with certain mixtures and recipes that are easily found by searching the sub. Without food, your body has no other way to get the necessary potassium, magnesium, and sodium it needs than through liquids.


>Or advice for what to eat after it so I don’t undo the benefits?

Regardless of what you eat, you’re gonna have to shit immediately after eating it - plan accordingly. I personally always come off a PF with a nice broth mixture and some poached eggs. You’ll want to avoid carbs and sugars. 

Watermelon, for some reason, seems to recommended a lot for fast breaking. This is a terrible idea. Your blood sugar and insulin will be very low when you’re fasting. Eating sugar-rich foods to break your fast will make you feel dizzy, probably give you a stomach ache, and will spike your insulin like no tomorrow. (Personal experience)

So stick with something small, like a bowl of broth, give yourself time to digest it, and reassess how you feel."
