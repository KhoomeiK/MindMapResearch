Was the coin toss result? Heads or Tails?"

vanderpumprules,fdj0v4b,t1_fdiyc68,1578455591.0,They aren’t ganging up on him. The same way they aren’t ganging up on Kristen. You either better yourself or you make excuses.

vanderpumprules,fdixd1g,t1_fdiwr8y,1578453190.0,"I guess if they are filming it for the show, that may be e reason they haven’t said anything yet. I think that route is stupid. If you talk about it and are open and honest, I will be more likely to tune in and watch."
vanderpumprules,fdix0jo,t3_ell88b,1578452965.0,"I didn’t lose respect for James until season 7. He was 26 when it was filmed and needs to grow up. If you want to be respected as an adult, start acting like one. Looking at you as well Kristen."

vanderpumprules,fdiwdjn,t1_fdiw1wv,1578452541.0,It usually is. Keep resisting!
vanderpumprules,fdiw3rw,t3_elmcyp,1578452364.0,Now that I have pondered it. I wonder if she’s doing IVF. Would explain the “pregnant” look.
vanderpumprules,fdivrhw,t1_fdivnsm,1578452140.0,I have a feeling they would lie about it until they inked some sort of deal for a spinoff.
vanderpumprules,fdivod9,t1_fdivjoi,1578452084.0,"OMG. I AM SO SORRY. 

In no way did I intend to inflict that level of trauma on you. 

Basically, it looks like she has one head surrounded by a much bigger but more square head."

LadyGaga,fc6yb6p,t1_fc6iojn,1577492637.0,"There are 1 types of fulfillment:  
-Amazon.com (they own the inventory) 
-Third Party Vendors

If you buy from Amazon it is legit. If you buy from a Third Party Vendor you could get burned. Amazon does not promote or do sales for Third Parry Vendors. Haus Laboratories  has their own store within Amazon where the sale occurred, which was promoted as the deal of the day. Only way for that to occur is for it to be the legitimate product. 

Everyone needs to be careful buying online, but shouldnâ€™t be scared of amazon if they know how to find legitimate products."

LadyGaga,fc6d2ll,t1_fc5b5bc,1577477721.0,Call them up and tell them. They might give you a refund or cancel or return your order.
LadyGaga,fc6d0v2,t1_fc5r4wh,1577477688.0,"I looked into this. It is fulfilled by Amazon.com and promoted as a limited deal. Itâ€™s authentic.
