bipolar,fcauu38,t1_fc9qe3u,1577577052.0,"I actually agree with this method. It could also be said as a way of containing the situation and making sure the other parties anger is not allowed to derail the situation. It's a de-escalation technique used widely and I have to use it many times before both at home and even at my job in some cases. People are easy to fly off the handle.. and upping their voices.. switching topic to divert the attention to other things... is all a form of manipulation. Sounds like honestly your spouse might have been taught to gas light at one point or another, but good on you for standing firm and not putting up with that. So though others might not agree with the word choice, the technique itself I do know works very well."
bipolar,fcau11q,t3_egsnqb,1577576599.0,My spouse did this for a long while and until I went to therapy and had my therapist sit down with him and I and explain to them that not everything about me is linked to my condition.. They finally started seeing the light. That and myself standing up for myself.. saying my condition is not an out for them to blaim things on me for in my life. I am still myself and my own person.. I'm Nina.. I am NOT Bi Polar solely.  Just like he wouldnt want all his actions associated with his ADHD.

bipolar,fc1siv4,t3_efphj4,1577328342.0,I have a kylina(sp?) IUD implant. I had mood swings with it at first..for the first few weeks. Then it leveled out and has been fine since. I warn though to have your cervix checked BEFORE getting it implanted.. to see how supposedly easy an IUD will be to be put in. For some reason mine is what is called crooked a bit.. and they had to open mine about 10× wider then normal to put it in. It was the worst pain I have ever had..and I have had my ear drums burst..wisdom teeth removed.. ribs dislocate. For 90% of women they have little to no issue and it is very easy.. I'm just unlucky.
bipolar,fc1rpu1,t3_efeh1w,1577327616.0,"Good sleep is a key to staving off severe swings. When you are well rested and have a routine, enough sound sleep helps soooooo much. Also nice choice on the weighted blanket with the mattress.♡"
