Advice,fe6yzfq,t1_fe5azlc,1578907874.0,"But be weary of ""pregnancy care centers"" Some are very anti-choice and misinform and scare women out of making an informed decision regarding their options. Look at their website before making an appointment or visiting. Some even advertise ""abortion services"" which means ""abortion counceling"" which is just a scare tactic. These places can be a resource for those who know full heartedly they want to keep the pregnancy, but toxic and traumatic for women going in expecting to hear their options. When my friend for pregnant at 16 we went to planned parenthood. She already knew she wanted to terminate but they have counceling for all available options and will make the appropriate referrals for continued pregnancy care if they dont have those services in-clinic."

relationships,fckonm8,t3_ehnyjk,1577729868.0,"I understand your position, but I do want to get married one day. I have had to ask myself why, but other than being a united front and the social validation of a relationship a marriage provides, I see it as an investment and insurance policy. 

If someone cheats or is immoral, the implications are heavier in a marriage. It is, in a way bullshit, and in others valid. Like any relationship itself, it has its pros and cons. Security for some freedom. 

If you are both set in your decisions, it's best you discussed it sooner rather than later. You both should pursue what feels right to you, and I know from experience this can be a deal breaker. 

My partner was only okay with marriage after he came to terms with himself as a cheater. He was unfaithful without me knowing for a long time and sought out counceling and is more committed to me and our relationship.

1. Never stayed with someone who was friends with a good number of my friends even though it would somewhere consistent to stay. I opted to just sleep at the school/couch surf/ whatever. It came out later that he raped another girl. I never trusted him. Thank god. 


2. Once my friend I and were hanging out with one of her friends. We were all 15ish at the time. They weren't close but hung out from time to time. I dont think my friend even liked her that much, she just hated being alone and needed people to fill the silence. Anyways. Her friend suggested we meet up with her boyfriend. Okay, sure, whatever. I had an initial gut feeling something was off but slightly, thought it was just my dislike of the person. So we went. 

Someone pulls up and asks us to get it. (Creepy van) the friend jumps in and I'm not one to leave someone behind no matter what, so we jump in too although my friend and I gave each other the look. We pull up to a sketch house k I'll nd of out of the way. More men come out and start walking around the van. I text my friend we need to make up an excuse and leave now or bolt. She agrees and texts her friend that. Within a minute or so the guy (full grown man back and says ""oh you little sluts want to leave huh? Or something to that effect. I grab both girls arms and jump out of the van and we BOLT and zig zag trying to make sure they didnt follow. We saw them drive by a block or two over a while into our run but they didnt see us. I texted my BF who had a car and he came and rescued us.
