Drugs,ffjgi4f,t3_ettfw0,1579997752.0,"There is a balance. People who have never done drugs and are morally opposed to them are usually just NPCs who are ruled by what the screens tell them. But man, drugs are meant to provide contrast and parallax to your life. You're supposed to take the experiences you have with them back into sobriety and have it enhanced and enriched by them, not just live your life in a continual haze of being dosed on one thing or another. The loop should be experience followed by reflection. You need both elements in order to use drugs for their higher purpose. Some drugs do not lend themselves to this purpose, namely opiates first and foremost but almost any of them can fall victim to it with the wrong mindset. Drugs should be an excursion, not an escape."
rpg_gamers,ffjfak0,t3_etus52,1579997031.0,"It's a classic dungeon crawler with ultra-hardcore Dragon Quest style combat. Nothing in common with Dark Souls, in fact I think a lot of the negative opinions you see of it come from the ""i pLaY hArD gAmEs LiKe dArK sOuLs"" crowd because a lot of those dudes haven't played actual RPGs and they get fuckin ROCKED when they realize this is a game where getting good is about strategy, risk mitigation, and contingency planning rather than just learning the right time to hit the circle button during a bunch of animations. Tactical skill rather than mechanical skill.

So it will be your love for old school RPGs that determines your affinity with DD. It's a game with almost unparalleled atmosphere dripping with personality, and has a lot of interesting push/pull mechanics in terms of resource balancing, team design and outfitting, and combat strategy. And very few missions are actually unwinnable so long as you're well prepared, but you also have to know when to fold and realize that pushing your luck can spell absolute disaster. It has a lot going on and it's really good."

nba,ffencpw,t1_ffdkpln,1579855709.0,"Our rebounding was absolute trash with Horford and Baynes on the floor, Al was allergic to crashing the boards and would just hang out on the perimeter half the time and Baynes has bad hands and would just bumble the ball coming off the rim for another guy to snatch away. Rebound disparity lost us a lot of games."
nba,ffen681,t1_ffegmo4,1579855441.0,"The one game JT was out our defense got absolutely blown tf up. It's really underdiscussed how hesitant teams are to even pass the ball to the side of the court Tatum is covering now. You can basically just stick longboi on a perimeter player and force the other team to make someone else beat you, and he'll STILL find a way to snatch it out of a lane."

gamingsuggestions,ffeaz3c,t3_esvh6w,1579841692.0,"FFXII has a pretty serious story but so much gameplay, and a big part of the game is just wandering around exploring beautiful areas fighting monsters. Xenoblade is very similar too and a little more lighthearted storywise overall, though it definitely gets very heavy at times.

Trails in the Sky is also a very chill JRPG, pretty low stakes right until the end where it starts to ramp up. Mostly just slice of life stuff and character interaction. Not about exploration though, it's a pretty simple top-down game with basic linear environments."

nba,ffdzszo,t1_ffdnpdm,1579833035.0,"The ASG is literally all offense. Nobody wants to see Lowry old-man-dribble around the baseline and back out, flop while putting a shot up, then complain to the refs in an exhibition match that's supposed to be about spectacle and showmanship."
