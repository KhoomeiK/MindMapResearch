smashbros,ff87qld,t1_ff7rzo7,1579668408.0,"I agree, as someone who never even had heard of Joker prior to his announcement. “Hmm, cool... so how do I play his game?” There’s no way around the fact that he is an advertisement for a competitor’s console. He was literally sold as “Joker from Persona 5,” not “Joker from that one obscure 3DS game” or even “Joker from the Persona series”. I’m a Nintendo fan who does not have a PS4 so it just left a weird taste in my mouth. It’s also just bizarre with Persona 5 still being a PS4 exclusive after Joker was put in Smash, like not only did Atlus not feel obliged to put the game on Switch but Nintendo was fine with the whole arrangement. Weird weird weird.

It’s similar to how Ryu was put in Smash around the time SFV was a PS4 exclusive and Cloud was put in around the time the FFVII Remake was announced as a PS4 exclusive. Weird pattern of Nintendo doing favors for third parties and them going, “That’s cute... anyway here ya go Sony!”"

smashbros,ff83gjp,t1_ff7bapu,1579664974.0,"That’s another weird thing. Why was this character such a secret? He didn’t say this about any of the other, way more interesting characters. He said this before the reveal to hype it up. The more I think about it the more it feels like a big “fuck you”."

Seriously, this is like the worst meme ever. It's old, and still always gets hundreds of likes on YouTube. I really want to see this meme go away forever."
