I haven't moved away for the point, i think the leaked documents are very much key to understanding what the tories have in store for the NHS.....sure they may give more funding, but hasn't the tory government aggressively cut NHS funding over the last decade?....and, didn't boris Johnson lie out of his back teeth about NHS fuding dividend coming post brexit?"
fakehistoryporn,fe9ek2m,t1_fe94q3e,1578936897.0,"So im going to go ahead and believe its genuine.

Im not entirely sure of the following:

- whether it was the russian government/intelligence that leaked it
- what the russians want (i thought it was brexit and to weaken nato)
- what the russian ties are with boris and the tory party
- how the document was leaked externally in the first place (there will certainly be an audit trail leading to people who had access, doesn't seem like anything has happened)

I feel the russian agenda is sometimes just to cause chaos.

Anyway, back to the actual document, i think its more proof that the nhs is for sale...thats what discussing it in early trade talks implied...its not like any british government would be stupid enough to go ""we are shutting down the nhs, go buy private healthcare""...its a gradual migration, bit by bit....but even more so, its big pharma business getting hands on taxpayer money from inflated costs of medicine"

RE your problem with russian interference....that is an issue with whoever created the documents who obviously leaked them? Or maybe they were hacked...either way, if they are genuine, then why does it matter how they got into Corbyn's hands?
