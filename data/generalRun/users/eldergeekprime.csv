Seatbelt use is the law in all 50 states for a reason dummy and maybe you don't care about your own safety and well-being, or the safety and well-being of the pet you supposedly love and care about, but that does not give you the right to inflict the consequences of your bad decisions on the people who will have to try and keep your stupid ass alive as we work to extract you from underneath your dashboard or find all the bits of you that got broken and ripped off when you were ejected from the vehicle at high speed.  And you especially don't get to put the other drivers around you in danger by having an unrestrained animal in the car with you that can interfere with your control of the vehicle or distract you from operating it safely.

Then there's the inevitable legal challenges such a policy will face, which will cost even more money.  A lot more money.  Lawyers aren't cheap and this policy would have a lot of people in opposition.

Of course, you could modify it a little and only require it if the person has had any traffic violations or accidents in the previous 5 years.
