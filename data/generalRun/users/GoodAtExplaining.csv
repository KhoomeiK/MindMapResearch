woahdude,ff77ew8,t3_ertjal,1579642596.0,"I love living in this country, but it's hard to explain even to other Canadians how little the land cares whether you live or die. 

I lived in a cottage on a lake in Northern Ontario for a month in January a few years ago. There are more cottages on lakes in Ontario than I've had hot meals - [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lakes_of_Ontario) is a *partial* list of the lakes in Ontario. That's just Ontario, ONE province. 

Anyway, Northern Ontario is basically the Canadian Shield. Imagine a chain of mega-volcanoes thousands of kilometres across from the beginning of the Earth's history around four billion years ago. The Canadian Shield is basically the dead remnant of all these volcanoes. It forms a major part of North America (And indeed, you can find the Shield as far south as Texas!)

The problem is, this is all rock. No rolling hills or lush, verdant green. This is the land of muskeg swamps, granite formations so large that they had to be dynamited through in order to make roads, and temperature extremes. Northern Ontario is a primal and powerful example of the wilderness that cannot be tamed. 

When I rocked up to the cottage in midwinter, it was in the middle of a snowstorm in -20C temps. This is fine - I have a car, warm clothes, a wood fire, etc.

But as I learned while staying there, in the dead of winter nothing moves. The air is still, life has entered a truce. The lack of sound, of anything identifying, is like a splinter in your mind. Even the sun conspires to your madness, rising late and going to bed early. And up north where there are no people, all that's left is to stare into the Nietzschean void of the sky and ponder yourself against the untold size of the Milky Way. 

Walk on a frozen lake at midnight and the sound of the blood rushing in your ears and your heart beating are louder than the psychotic screams of a dying man. I learned that even snow falling can make a sound when nature pulls its black curtain up against the world. Every creak of a tree in the wind became nails on a chalkboard - The lack of sound pushes you into a state of hypervigilance. You need some sound, sight, movement in order to anchor your sanity

I love my country, but it is savage. From the impenetrable and forbidding mountains to the west, to the barren tundra of the north to the weather in the east - When you stop and think about it, we exist here by the grace of a higher power, the land. Canada has not been conquered, she simply allows us to live here, and witness the extraordinary beauty!

Edit: I will say this, though. If you visit or plan to come live here, understand that Canada steals a piece of your soul and will not give it back until you come back for it. Canada stole a piece of my soul when I was driving across the prairies with a friend. The Canadian Prairies are a long stretch of mostly-flat land formed when a prehistoric lake (Lake Agassiz) dried up. As a result, you get long flat land and a visually arresting sky. The slogan of the province of Saskatchewan is ""Land of Living Skies.""

We woke up at 3 and started driving. It started raining part way, and then escalated into a full storm with thunder and lightning pelting our small car as we went along the Trans-Canada highway. We were the only people on it, and the road is a small strip of asphalt wandering through the endless flatness of the Prairies. Occasionally the entirety of the sky was lit up by flashes of lightning and I was lost for words.

Until the sunrise. 

The sunrise happened on one side of us while the thunderstorm raged on the other. We were instantly and totally caught between two primal, historic forces. I was a tiny little blip riding in a cage of metal and rubber, caught between two of the oldest forces in history. It was at that moment I realized my insignificance, and marveled at a country where I could see both of these in such amazing contrast. 

If you want to live in a country where nature reverberates through the very rocks and lightning, Canada is for you."

Because of this method, the nail was less likely to shatter when it was driven into concrete. Spalling = shrapnel. 

> In steel the force of the shot actually heats the steel to liquid and it instantly reforms around the knurling on the pin.

[Knurling](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9Zwi0ZAUCUc/hqdefault.jpg) is when a nail, knob, or screw, has a pattern imprinted on it so that it's easier to grip/manipulate it. In this case, the heat created by driving a steel object into steel with a small explosive charge makes the 'nail' melt a little and re-form once it settles into the material - This makes the join stronger."

The US government will NEVER allow Boeing to go bankrupt. These sorts of situations are extremely good at putting a temporary dent into Boeing stocks. If you've got a little money set aside, you could do worse than investing in Boeing dividend shares (Dividend shares allow you to invest in a company and they pay you a set amount each year based on how many dividend shares you own). This is great because you just need to buy and hold the shares, you don't need to worry about trading them - Just buy more when the price goes down.

Similar stocks you should invest in:

- Budweiser (Beer and alcohol stocks rise when there's a recession/depression!)

- Big automakers (Volkswagen lost a ton of value during the emissions scandal. Surprise surprise, the stock is back up)."

The most fundamental ones are the most deeply placed, the most recent ones are on the surface and are easier to 'wipe away' as it were.

You can see this in senior-aged people and those suffering from dementia or Alzheimers. They can still remember names and faces from their childhood, but in the advanced stages will not be able to remember names and faces of their children, for example. 

When you have a moment, go down a wiki hole on how human memory works. I never realized how critical it is to our survival, or how fascinating it is."

Why you think Indian women are so good with math? My mom's like fuckin Voldemort when I was a kid. I had eaten a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and left the mess on the desk, and then sat down at the computer with the door to the room closed. 

I felt a sharp THWACK and something hit me on the forehead hard enough to make my eyes water I was seeingt stars and needed to put my head on the desk. Came outside and there was a metal ladle with a dent in it, and mom's handwriting - ""CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF.""

When I was a kid, whenever we went out, my mother always had issues with the menu. She'd ask for calorie counts, or to have every ingredient in a dish explained to her, or ask what the options are for substitution and oh can we have this swapped out for that and instead of on the dish can we get the sauce on the side on a plate....

It was **incredibly** frustrating. To this day she CANNOT just order off a menu and it takes fifteen minutes longer than it normally does at any restaurant just to get orders in. 

Drives me fuckin nuts. JUST ORDER OFF THE REGULAR FUCKIN' MENU. EVERYONE'S HUNGRY MA, NOBODY CARES THAT YOU WANT A VINAIGRETTE DRESSING ON THE SIDE OF YOUR CUSTOM SALAD THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A VINAIGRETTE DRESSING MA WHAT THE FUCK."
