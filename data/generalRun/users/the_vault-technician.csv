todayilearned,ffihbng,t1_ffi4zql,1579973874.0,Thats the same question I have. But I'm willing to wager they would have found some other sick game to entertain themselves that resulted in killing people.

AskReddit,ffifmj0,t3_etouc5,1579972717.0,"A classmate was injured in an accident when he was in high school, and started using opiates and later overdosed in his mid twenties. They ended up painting an anti-drug mural with his face in the cafeteria at the school. What no one talks about is how he was selling drugs and was a pathological liar and all around dirtbag before his accident. Nope, he was just another victim of prescription opiates...bullshit."

And a few other choice words...."

phish,fff5h6f,t1_fff4xel,1579876200.0,"Really good point! Plus, you can couch tour so there is less of the fear of missing out. I'm sure earlier fans have families, careers and other responsibilities that make them less inclined to go on a run."
phish,fff4mn5,t1_fff4iuf,1579875576.0,How many shows would they do in a summer tour back then?

Are we counting wooks who bring their kids as fans? If you disassociate in a k-hole do you still count if you don't know who you are? How many people are you then?

Way too many factors here man."

phish,fff38uk,t1_fff16dg,1579874512.0,"The best way to do it, if you live on the west coast? Drive from show to show, once you get to the last Cali date, fly to Arkansas and steal a van to do the rest. Or trade your dignity to a group of wooks and hitch with them.


Do the opposite if you are on the east coast."
phish,fff2wgt,t1_fff19zu,1579874244.0,"I'm not educated enough to comment on why ticket prices have increased out of balance with inflation, but if I had to guess it's all Ticketmaster's fault."

phish,ffeuj19,t3_et21r2,1579866133.0,"Let's hope that Phish inc has some say in how things are done. I imagine that they have a lot more knowledge and experience when it comes to putting on a safe, successful and eco friendly event."
phish,ffeu57j,t1_ffetnkh,1579865642.0,"I wonder if they are doing only one night at the Forum because it definitely didn't sell out in summer 2018. I had tickets for N2, decided to do N1 on a whim, got tix the day before the show right from ticketbastard."
