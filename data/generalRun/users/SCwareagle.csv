CollegeBasketball,fggc48z,t1_fgg6m4x,1580758732.0,"Depended on the situation:

Band side: Good chance that you won't be crammed in as tight, higher chance of being on the end of a row.  However, the band can be really loud right in your ear.    You also have to get there pretty early, because it tended to fill quickly and extras were sent to the other side.

Opposite side:  Didn't have band in your ear, and got to watch the O up close in the second half.  Often packed in tighter, except in some low attendance games, where you had tons of space.

Basically, I went band side if I wanted a slightly better experience and opposite side if I wanted to maximize drinking time before tip off."
todayilearned,fgfz2wv,t1_fgetjg2,1580750728.0,"This may be an apt description, much of the time.  In a lot of cases, you need to be very hard working and talented, plus have connections to open the doors for you.  I'm sure there are a lot of entitled rich kids who never get anywhere in Hollywood because they don't have any dedication or talent."

I think which one is better really comes down to a preference between football or basketball.  Whichever sport you lean towards, you'll probably put more stock in that rivalry."

technology,fg0p4ff,t1_fg052me,1580412276.0,"Having a great-great grandfather would make you 1/16 native, or about 6%.  That is four generations back.  The test that Warren took said that there was strong evidence she had native heritage 6 to 10 generations back.  So something like 1/64 (1.6%) to 1/1024(0.01%).

Her statement that her great-great-great grandmother (5 generations back) was part native american would line up with the 6+ generations back ancestry test.

I don’t see us making the final 4, though. I think we are capable of beating any team in the country, but our droughts and inconsistencies will hamper us from making a truly deep tournament run, unless we get that cleaned up during the season."
Futurology,fcunmne,t1_fcuj3gh,1577984844.0,Agreed.  It's not unreasonable for companies that need large quantities of water to seek out the lowest bidder for that water (though sometimes their methods are unscrupulous).  It is unreasonable for governments to screw the people that they represent by giving away a resource that they didn't have in excess.
