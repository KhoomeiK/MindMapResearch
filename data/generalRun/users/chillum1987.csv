His grave has a gas light flame that never goes out. His prison (i.e. mansion) is a multi-million dollar tourist attraction now. He argubly created the modern city of Miami and also did more for Colombia than any politician. He was a stone cold murderer, however. Duality of man and the like."

funny,ff6dsc1,t1_ff6d19o,1579625005.0,"Saved up 3 grand after a tax return and dipped. The recession was looking hard over Florida at the time so I got out of Dodge and never looked back. When I got low, I worked. When I was up I traveled, it's all about what kind of comfort you need. I'm cool with a sleeping bag, campfire and worst case scenario a steel bottom skiff that most people keep in backyards. If you ask around you don't go without. People are more generous when you are traveling through it seems."
funny,ff6db5n,t1_ff6bewr,1579624707.0,"Well money is always an issue, people get comfortable but I can assume miserable in their day to day. I grew up in restaurants and on fishing boats in Jacksonville, my stepdad owned a fish joint and was a captain first. These two skills are pretty universal worldwide. 

Also I would be in some places for years and some for weeks or even days. You find local expats from Canada, UK or US and ask for work.

 In the US pretty much everywhere you can walk in and find a waiting gig. Save up 5 grand, either convert a truck or bus to a living quarters, r/vagabonds is great for advice there. And find a country or area you wish to explore and base yourself in that areas most populated area if possible. Rinse and repeat, that's at least what I did."

funny,ff6coab,t1_ff6cdbh,1579624309.0,"No the beers don't matter, just when I left they were kids, I come back and now they have kids and responsibilities. I just avoided all that for so long I guess it's hard to relate. Im not envious but it seems really nice but I wouldn't change a thing about my past at this point."
funny,ff6bi2p,t1_ff6b49y,1579623562.0,"If I ever taste ramen or rice and beans again, it'll be too soon. I'm a decent cook but logistics and a place to do it come in play. MREs when I was going to be out for a week or two were a nice choice also."
funny,ff6b8l9,t1_ff692i4,1579623392.0,"Maybe, I did it pretty raw. Hitchhiking, train hopping and of course planes and private cars when I had them. It was more of a soul searching mission than a organized ""backpack"" tour. I was trying to find my soul and it worked but exorcising that demon took alot."

Taught English in South America and work security for escorts in Frankfurt and Munich. I can't name all the jobs I've done but I've never had to beg. Not sure who pissed in your coffee this morning."

funny,ff675xr,t1_ff646zb,1579620741.0,"One more before you get sick of me lol, in Colombia I met an actor from the show Jericho that was a horrible, horrible sexual predator who mentioned an island (was one of Epsteins) that had ""lots of girls"". I watched him pass out on a couch and I honestly thought about putting a pillow over his face. Didn't do it, but it was close. 

Did karaoke with Elijah Wood during comic Con in SD. And met Eddie Vedder (sp? Not a huge grunge fan) at a dinner party in Seattle. I was also so high on cocaine and pisco when I saw Machu Picchu that I barley remember it."
funny,ff66ojb,t1_ff646zb,1579620424.0,"Well a quick one, recently left the bush in Alaska. They had the ""warmest"" October on record so the grizzlies were still being dick heads. Slept in a truck and woke up to one breathing on my window I was leaning my head on. I made eye contact with it and it froze me to my core. I've never had my whole body stop functioning like that. 

Also I shot AK-47s with the shining path terrorist group in Peru. I told them I was Canadian and not American and that probably saved my life."
funny,ff667b0,t1_ff65ij3,1579620099.0,"Funny you say that, I might have a son in Ontario. I've tried to find the mom on Facebook but no dice. We met in Germany and she emailed me (this was a long time ago) that she was late and for me not to worry about it. I'm not sure what she did if she was pregnant."

I've lived in Chicago, New York, St. Thomas, San Diego, Los Angeles, Charleston, Atlanta, Jacksonville, Seattle, Vancouver, B.C. 

I just started when I was 20 and never stopped. I had a bad childhood and honestly was probably suicidal. I figured the road would kill me eventually, it didn't but it gave me a reason to keep going."
