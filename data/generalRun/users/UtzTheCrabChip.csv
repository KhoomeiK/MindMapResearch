Great. But you're not adding any new friends this way. So once these friends get a new job, or move, or have kids, you're stuck grilling sausages alone"
science,ffi66bg,t1_ffi45uk,1579966137.0,"I think like any social phenomenon, there's going to be an interaction of many different factors. Off the top of my head, here are all some that predate the explosion of social media. Keep in mind that this survey covers millennials, many of whom are in their 30s and didn't ""grow up with social media"". Also keep in mind that none of these things are uniformly bad, but contribute to loneliness.

1. Decline of religiousness. Church was by far the most dominant community that most Americans belonged to. Losing that and replacing it with nothing is a huge factor.

2. Geographic mobility. People don't stay in the same town with the same people all their lives anymore. It's a whole lot harder to try to build a new social circle every 5-10 years

3. Corporate Culture. This is both in terms of work environment and what coprpoations provide. We've replaced cafeterias and break rooms with eat at your desk, and have been encouraged for years to leave your personal life at home. So the place that we spend the plurality of our waking hours is isolating. And that's assuming we even stay in the same job long enough to form meaningful relationships. On the other end, retail has been changing their environments to encourage ""Spend your money and GTFO""

4. Culture of individualism. It's not noted in this article, but the problem of loneliness is way more acute in men, and particularly in white men. Our culture values and encourages men to be completely interior, to rely on no one, and to distain deeper relationships with other men. You can do a deep dive on Google, but essentially, once puberty hits, American men lose all their deep friendships in a way that women do not."
