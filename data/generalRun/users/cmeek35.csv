atheism,ffhlbns,t1_ffgzryr,1579940663.0,Reliability of scriptures.... Lmao. The twisting and contorting of the bible by modern ministers to make the bible palatable and to attempt to make it relevant to modern life means its pretty much unrecognisable :)

atheism,ffeiy4m,t1_ffdxjr3,1579849907.0,Nothing means anything? No good or evil? Then why on earth do we have feelings and emotions?why do animals have feelings? I dont need to believe in a magic man in the clouds to know that to hurt someone and cause pain is wrong because it causes harm or to know that doing good makes a difference because its good. I dont believe in god but it doesnt mean if i see a wee old woman fall in the street im gona walk on by because theres no heaven to reward me. So basically if theres no god we should all just have a free for all murdering and raping and stealing cause theres no heaven /hell at the end of it all? Thats a terrible argument. Sorry :)
atheism,ffdwq3r,t3_et0h63,1579830820.0,"My parents condemming Catholics as not christians (protestant upbringing in northern ireland). I thought then so Catholics arent going to heaven? And then thought but sure the only reason protestantism is in ireland is because henry viii wanted a divorce to marry a hot bride. If not then id be Catholic........ This spiralled into but what if id been born in India or somewhere else where Christianity isnt the main religion. And what about kids born into Catholic /buddist/muslim families..... They dont get the same chance to get to heaven as me. IS EVERYONE GOING TO HELL??????? I couldnt cope with that so i questioned everything until i became athesist because i couldnt be on board with something so unfair but man it was hard to get away fron something which had brainwashed me for 18 years.

Never felt the whole 'presence' fuzzy feeling either."
atheism,ffdv7ih,t1_ffdt91a,1579829749.0,"The arguments used by christians ive known all end up basically the same 'i prayed for that, my prayer is answered' when good stuff happens OR 'its all in his plan' / 'its the devil' when bad stuff happens. Or the good old 'faith' for anything they dont have an answer for. There is literally no arguing with christians. How can you argue with someone who basically states that blind faith is the answer to sensible questions?

I was brought up in a very strict religious house and was brainwashed into being a christian for 18 years. Once i left home and started to question it it fell apart very quickly and there truly were no answers that could get it back for me.

The whole idea of this benevolent loving god who people stand and worship and sing and pray and thank for all their blessings and pray for healthy and happiness and safety etc while knowing some people are born into abusive homes/sex trafficked/poverty/starvation and this lovely kind god does absolutely feck all about shit like that but does listen to a prayer about your son passing his exams absolutely kills me. Oh but wait..... He only gives us the burdens we can bear. I forgot. My bad."

sphynx,ff40tp4,t3_er6a7t,1579553079.0,Thats so amazing you get to adopt a rescue. Getting my girl was the best decision i ever made. Nothing really i wish I knew before. My girls ears onky need cleaned every few weeks and she gets bathed once a month and nails cut once a month. Couple times she swiped her tail in poop but other than that shes perfect. Just they really need kept warm. Im moving to an apartment soon and one of the main reasons is my house is cold (ireland) and has a tiled floor which is freezing. I leave blankets and hot water bottles for her and i have a chihuahua so she has company.

atheism,feey90x,t3_eorm60,1579043845.0,While theres plenty of unempathetic atheists out there for me this does ring true. I had a very strict christian upbringing and never questioned the validity of the bible until i left home and went to uni and met people of different backgrounds and religions and couldnt cope with the idea that they were all going to hell. Once i thought even further afield i couldnt accept that everyone who werent born in christian countries were also going to hell. It upset me so much and worried me so much that i couldnt honestly stay a Christian. I chose to become atheist even though hell terrified me and i still believed in it deep down. But i didnt think it was fair that i got to go to heaven because my parents were Christian and i happened to be born into the right geographic location. Took years to get rid of those beliefs drummed into me as a kid. 16 years on and im good :) best thing i ever did was search for all the reasons not to believe.
facepalm,feewdkf,t1_fedvlmk,1579042643.0,That always bugs me. Like headlines are like 'mother killed in hit and run' like it would be less shit if it was me who is childless?

depression,feaixb3,t3_eo7rmf,1578949425.0,I kept a mood diary for 683 days and rereading the entries fucking killed me. I had to delete it because i made the same mistakes over and over and reading it just reinforced how sad my life was. Im def in a better place now and while i still remember all the crap stuff i did (drugs and sleeping around and feeling incredibly fucking lonely) its different to reading that stuff in your own voice and taking yourself right back there. I used to almost go into a trance rereading it all and it wasnt healthy for me
depression,feai98s,t3_enrs4c,1578949097.0,"I feel like a constant drain on people. Theres people starving to death, being raped, or even just raising kids and dealing with family stuff and i am a 36 year old privileged financially independent person with my own house and friends and yet my mental health is so fucking shitty i just feel like im a depressing life sucking friend who always needs attention. Im lucky that one friend in particular has similar issues but deals better than me and honestly if it wasnt for her i wouldn't be here. Just knowing that you have one person who truly gets it and who will always return a call means a lot. But in terms of other people and my boyfriend i do feel like an attention seeking narcissist. But the way my head is it just takes over absolutely everything all the time. The meds have side effects, i spent 18 months with uncontrollable diarrhea as a result of 3 different ssris. To the point where i was sent for a colonoscopy because it was so bad. My gp wont give me more than a month at a time of meds so i feel like a hypochondriac always ringing up for prescriptions or check in appointments just to be able to get my meds. Its just never ending and im my bad periods i do think its not worth it if my lifes always going to have such massive lows when a bout hits. When im bad i honestly cant remember what it's like to be happy and i am truly convinced that im never actually happy. But right now when i feel good i know that i am."
Effexor,fe4tfoa,t3_el4j4y,1578862643.0,"Funnily enough my gp put me on effexor because of my gastro problems. I had 18 months of diarhorea from when i started sertraline. It got worse and worse til i changed to escitalopram but that didn't get any better. I was going eveey time i wemt for a pee. I changed to citalopram and things went insane. Stomach cramps, basically shitting water literally 20 times a day. Having accidents. Seeinf food id eaten 6 hours after eating it passing through me. I was dehydrated, exhausted, constantly at the toilet, not able to eat or go to the gym. Obviously this made my depression a million times worse. The gp said to try effexor because its an ssni instead of ssri like the others. In the meantime i was to taper of citalopram go cold turkey for ten days and start the effexor. Also got sent for a colonoscopy and biopsy.

Long story short. Two weeks into effexor and i now go twice a day and dont have to eat busocpan and loparamide like smarties. So yeah they def affect your bowels. But if its a long term thing dont do what i did and ignore it til becomes a massive problem. Switch to something else."
Effexor,fe4skau,t3_eljp8m,1578862350.0,I did but only for the first week and then it went away.

dogs,fckx4j6,t1_fckrzhj,1577735076.0,"Def how i feel. Tabitha is a sphynx and so is ridiculously affectionate which i absolutely love. She just wants to cuddle and steal body heat and spoons me in bed with little sandpaper kisses and her purring is the best part of my day. Frank also sleeps in bed with me but is more demanding in terms of wants scritches and obv needs to go outside and cant jump off the bed because hes tiny so i need to make syre hes fed and watered and while i wouldnt be without him,when im bad i know i could be a better mammy to him."
dogs,fckme89,t3_eho07v,1577728480.0,Cats are an option too. My sphynx cat is the most affectionate thing and snuggles and sleeps with me and gives me kisses. Doent need walked and her little just needs a changed every few days and she always just has a bowl of dry food sittinf. I have a chihuahua too and i love him but when im depressed he doesnt get walked and sometimes when I've been really bad hes just used the kitchen as a toilet because i havent got out if bed to let him out. I never ever get angry about that. Totally my fault and i have no problem cleaning up after him. To be honest hes alwaus been a little prone to accidents even when i lived with my ex husband and there was someone in the house. But depending on how bad the bout is they do suffer a little. Luckily my dog loves walks when im well but its equally happy lying cuddling not beinf walked. But having pets to come home to does make a big difference to me.
SphynxCats,fc9g3x1,t3_egrvpe,1577552173.0,Hes a carbon copy of my sphynx girl Tabitha. Rigjt down to the velvet on his nose :)
dogpictures,fbx8wx7,t3_eev9z2,1577174749.0,My chihuahua was the exact same colouring when he was a pup. Had a black mask and ears and stuff. Now hes a pure white abd gold adult. Kept a tiny bit of dark pigment on his tailand ear tips.
