Didn't catch a lot of the kind of buzz that surrounds more populated, well-known games but still had plenty of activity in its own right.

The playerbase has definitely been on a slow decline over time, but as long as you know which servers are still active you're probably fine (you have to create your character on a specific server and it costs to transfer between servers, unless something changed). Environment and overall ambiance are great.

It's definitely worth a try if you liked MMOs from the 2000's, and unless something changed you can effectively play for free up to about level 30 (beginning areas, Bree, and maybe 1-2 areas I can't remember are free, which gets you to around level 20-30), so you have plenty of time to decide if you want to pay to unlock specific content."
