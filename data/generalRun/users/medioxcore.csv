My point isn't that you're already paying taxes for low-income services, it's that one of the reasons healthcare costs are so high is because people go to the doctor with emergencies they can't pay for, and in order to offset those costs, hospitals raise their prices, meaning that you are already paying for people who can't pay, even without taxes, and you always will as long as there are people who can't afford to pay.
