relationship_advice,ffh9dc7,t1_ffgcpr0,1579926899.0,"I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted, but yeah - age is relative and 40 is so young to me, but to somebody in their 20s I can see how 40 might seem ""old"".  That said, I think that its good that we are involving ourselves in these conversations."
relationships,ffh6nyv,t1_fff4snz,1579924599.0,"Years ago, my father was in the hospital fighting cancer.  My (now ex) husband was home and unemployed.  I was shuffling between work and the hospital and I was exhausted.  One day I had put a big laundry basket full of clean clothes at the bottom of the stairs before I left for work.  I got home very late that evening to see that the laundry had been carried upstairs, but not folded.  I see my husband sitting on the couch playing Angry Birds and he asked me if there was anything for dinner.  I didn't even say anything. I turned around and walked up the stairs.   He followed me and asked me what was wrong.   I explained what was already painfully clear to me.  I had just spent 17 hours away from the house working and taking cats of my father and I come home to a request for dinner and unfolded laundry.  You know what he said?  ""I was waiting for you to tell me to fold the laundry"" .   I lost my shit."

Our culture (America) is so obsessed with youth and looking young that we miss out on the richness and joy in aging."
travel,ffafvhl,t1_ffaa5v6,1579734782.0,This is so cool!! I am totally going to look into this!

AdviceAnimals,ff8gdyu,t1_ff8c92g,1579677295.0,"They sent me one ""itemized"" bill and it was 4k under one heading that didn't explain shit.  I simply do not care if they send it to collections.  I have really excellent credit and I'm just going to dispute it.  I have all the records of all the emails and requests and I told them I'm not paying it.  I *might* settle with the agency for 500 bucks once it gets there."
AdviceAnimals,ff8avxy,t1_ff877av,1579671287.0,My son slammed his pinkie finger in the car door. It looked broken.  Xrays and a needle draining the fluid out from underneath his nail. 2k.  And this is AFTER insurance paid their portion AND reduced the amount they were allowed to bill.  I shit you not.  I've asked for an itemized breakdown and haven't gotten it yet.  I'm not paying it.  They can send me to collections.
relationships,ff4srde,t1_ff4jmaf,1579571562.0,"Yup. This.  My niece was dating a guy none of us cared for.  My sister made sure her doors were ALWAYS open to this guy.  He was at family dinners, game nights etc.  He now helps with the family business and has turned into a pretty responsible young man who treats my niece with respect and love.  I'm not saying this works for every situation, but alienating the boy and telling the daughter NO just pushes her right into his arms."
Seattle,fex77zx,t3_eqprtw,1579425825.0,"I dont understand what anything means past the word ""unless""....can somebody ELI5? 

aside from that, this would be brilliant.  40 hours  a week on top of commuting kills me.

Edit: DUH...it's saying anything past 32 is overtime.  How would this play out for salaried folks then? Would we work 32 hours for less pay?"
