This was your question - I was just pointing out that no, they didn't equate lower moisture in the air with better atmosphere for healing.

You're describing how no information source is completely free from bias (even if it's very slight), and that's true, but that doesn't mean that no information source is credible. NPR has some amount of bias, but they are credible. Fox news is biased much more severely, and has no credibility. It is hard to identify exactly how much bias each of these sources has, but it should be very easy to determine their credibility. 

People tend to think that we have Trumpworld because Americans aren't good at identifying bias - that's only part of the problem. If we teach everyone to fear bias in their very bones, we don't get anywhere, because nobody knows anything. The rest of the truth is that we have Trumpworld because Americans don't know how to determine credibility. They have no trusted news sources because they're bad at judging how much bias is too much. We need to teach them how to choose news sources, and how much bias is too much.

Is a career state department official under oath biased? Yes. Are they credible? Definitely. If five of them say that Trump did something illegal, it's not hearsay, it's firsthand evidence. And so on and so forth...

television,ffckn5t,t1_ffcchy9,1579801480.0,"I think the root of our disagreement here is that this:

>If you can't watch 10 hours and can only watch 1, in my opinion it's ultimately better to watch 1 hour straight from the source than 1 hour of someone's choice of what happened.

isn't true. If you do this, you end up with a completely contextless, incomplete, and inaccurate understanding of what's going on - and because bias preys on incomplete information, you end up *much more biased* than if you had just watched a news broadcast. Here is why:

News and Politics require context - the meaning and importance of big political events like the impeachment can only be fully understood with reference to science, history, and society. This isn't debatable, it's just a fact. All well-educated people agree. You can't get an accurate understanding of the impeachment trial without an understanding of the previous two impeachment trials. You can't understand the validity of constitutional arguments without an understanding of judicial precedent. You wouldn't even know whether a given speaker is credible or not without an understanding of their own political history. Etc.

Now, given all that, unless you know more than the best living historical/political expert, you *don't* have the context required to process all of the raw information of the impeachment trial. This is why news is important. They aren't just ""filters"" - they provide a service. It's absolutely critical to recognize this if you want to be well-informed. NPR, for example, brings on scientists, policy experts, career officials, and even legislators to provide the accumulated experience that the listener can't have. 

Obviously, getting informed requires that you trust your source - there's nothing wrong with this. It's necessary and normal to consider some sources of information credible. If you can't trust any source, you've cut yourself off from all information except for the limited amount you can collect all by yourself. Going that route guarantees that you'll be biased.

television,ffc48ed,t1_ffbszk9,1579791141.0,"Trials are all storytelling. You tell the story of what happened and the jury decides if they're convinced. That's how the process works. If under-oath testimony from career professionals were considered ""hearsay"" then criminals would have the run of the world."

coolguides,ffamamd,t1_ffaddd1,1579739282.0,"Easiest example: You're debating with someone about whether they are a good role model. Their character is the direct subject of the debate. 

Another one: You're debating with someone whose girlfriend ghosted them, about whether it was right to ghost them. Their character is evidence, because the decision being debated was influenced by someone's opinion of how he would react.

Another one: Someone tells you we didn't land on the Moon - because they've seen the photos and they know they're faked, and besides, the Earth is flat. Their character is relevant because if they're too stupid to know that the Earth is round, they don't know enough to able to forensically evaluate photos of the moon. 

Another one: Donald Trump says Bernie Sanders is a criminal, because he saw Bernie steal a gallon of milk from the store the other day. Donald's character is relevant, because if he's a pathological liar with no credibility, there's no reason to believe it actually happened. 

Another one: Someone is trying to convince you that black people are mostly criminals that want to take your jerb. Their character is relevant because if they're a stone-cold racist, they're clearly biased against black people and unable to evaluate them rationally. 

The list could go on but basically it all comes down to two different types of situation: One in which someone's character is actually directly under debate, in which case attacking their character is not a fallacy, and another in which someone asks you to believe something, in which case attacking their character can be a legitimate way to demonstrate that it's likely they are mistaken or lying."

Or is there something else going on? ""We might do something else that I don't like later"" is not an argument against doing this thing."

ShittyLifeProTips,ffa4tzu,t1_ff9xbw5,1579727904.0,Did you know that there is literally no law requiring that you talk to someone you don’t want to talk to? You come across as someone who doesn’t understand the difference between a polite request and a law.
