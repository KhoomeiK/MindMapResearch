> Key results

>Overall, we found very few studies and identified no new trials for this latest update. We analysed a total of 2106 participants from the three studies we found. All three studies showed that wearing a face mask during surgery neither increases nor decreases the number of wound infections occurring after surgery. We conclude that there is no clear evidence that wearing disposable face masks affects the likelihood of wound infections developing after surgery.

worldnews,feqpu2b,t1_feqjzxd,1579344622.0,"you were in korea for years, you must have learned a little about ""face""

that alone kinda explains why they would go along with it if they did know and not care to learn more if they didn't (or if you did, you'd join the group of going along with it), you would also be reluctant to bring it up incase someone you're talking to has had a family member who has died due to ""fan death"". 

>its just your grandma telling you your uncle died because of his fan, not wanting to admit he killed himself.

i dont think the government cares so much as what is put down, but if you tell people in the neigbourhood he died because of his fan being left on, that's a lot better than ""he was massively depressed, unhappy and killed himself"" and all the questions surrounding why he was unhappy etc, as people over here can blame others for that sort of thing, it's worse over there.

it's basically an excuse that benefits everyone by giving everyone a little lee-way, the government in suicides by noting it down as something else (a family that believes fan death is BS will name it something else ""natural"") and the family gets an easy out during a hard time, there is no pressure for this to change, so it will hang around."

DidntKnowIWantedThat,feoabjr,t1_feo9snn,1579297269.0,"oh, i would hope so. personally i think these are useless and grams are far better and more convenient. especially if you're doing something that requires a bunch of different weights of different things. 

volume is also something that fluctuates, however slightly based on particle size + temp, so you're better off weighing it either way, especially in baking, where it's all about precision."

the 1/2 is more than half, the 1/3rd more than a third etc.

edit: i just did it again to check:

https://imgur.com/a/4bJwKD2

here's the 1/2 to 1/1 comparison, notice how lobsided it is and how much extra there is in it, i left the tiniest line between the two as i could to show where one side starts and ends as it was hard to tell without it, so it's a tiny bit better than it looks in reality."

b: this isn't accurate, look at the handle as a reference point, if it were half, it would be halfway across the handle.

i'll explain it a different way as it's pretty difficult to get across via text:

if the 1/2 one was 50%, it wouldn't go all the way across the handle. i even checked the proportions in paint, which is why the bottom of the half cup of brown stuff looks so awkward.

edit: thank you for bringing up the point of depths being different /u/edgemuck

seems kinda nuts, people act like it's a perfect GOTCHA, think how many photos with people celebs and other people on the TV must take. 

it must be thousands every year, chances are more so with other people in office/on the tv, i'd imagine trump's rubbed shoulders with just about everyone unfortunately for them, it doesn't mean he knows them though. 

a couple photos over the years doesn't mean much, maybe if it's a bachelor party or something it does, but at a party in formal dress? i'd bet you can find photos of just about everyone with everyone."

todayilearned,fellg7m,t1_fekkmfg,1579224997.0,"sorta reminds me of death spirals in planes more so than ""pseudoneglect"" in that when you have no real of verifying your direction, because no-one moves in a perfectly straight line, you just kinda drift off.

in the case of pilots though, it's like that multiplying by itself over and over:

a plane in the fog/low visibility, basically if you turn left a little and hold the turn, your inner ear adjusts and it feels like you're flying straight, so a blind pilot will turn further left so his body feels like it's turning slightly left, then it adjusts, rinse repeat until you're going down in a death spiral even though it feels like you're going straight.

this has regularly killed pilots since flying was possible. less so now it's widely known, you have to learn to trust your instruments."
