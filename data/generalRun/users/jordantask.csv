AskReddit,ffg5gye,t1_fffz8up,1579898870.0,"If you want “sensitive men” who express their emotions, fine.

If you don’t then STFU about “Toxic Masculinity” already. 

The kind of emotional expression modern day feminism wants breeds the exact kind of weak men that feminists are so repulsed by.

Take a good, hard look at the men that inhabit the feminist movement. The so called “allies.” Not just appearance, mind you, but pick a few noteworthy examples and really research them. They express plenty of emotions, for sure. They’re also crapweasels. Feminist women typically want nothing to do with them, and rightly so because they are slimy as fuck.

As Socrates would say, pick what you want and pay for it.

If you’re the sort of person who wants men to be “sensitive” and express emotions when it’s convenient and as soon as it becomes difficult, you’re disgusted you need to stay away from men. You are the problem.

EDIT: That being said I don’t think that being “sensitive” or expressing emotions makes you weak. Having *uncontrolled* emotions and overreacting to everything that triggers you does, but legitimately crying because you are greatly saddened isn’t weakness at all."

Stalin was also a “my way or the highway” kinda guy, so even those officers that remained were forced into prodigiously costly situations they wouldn’t have otherwise been in because of his interference.

Food supply problems were caused by Soviet nepotism, corruption and incompetence.

I’m not suggesting you go all “Doomsday Prepper” and build a bunker, unless you live in places prone to severe weather that a storm shelter would protect you from, but having a few months worth of long term storable food, some first aid, flashlights and batteries, candles, maybe a store of medicines you’re dependent on, put back for an emergency is a good idea.

Either the priest really believes that confession of sins will help him get into heaven, or he doesn’t.

If the priest doesn’t believe, mandating reporting will do nothing. The priest will simply not confess.

If the priest does believe, it will be a deterrent since the jig will theoretically* be up after his first confession, and avoiding confession will have severe ramifications for his soul. Either they will avoid sexual abuse acts or get caught fairly quickly.

*I say theoretically because nothing says that a given priest will live up to the legal requirements. There are only two people in the confession box, and no way to prove that something was said or not either way.

It’s entirely possible that molester priests will confess to each other and cover each other’s backs. Also, most priests consider the confession seal to be sacred, so even if a priest is entirely on the up and up but they consider that confidence to be inviolable, on pain of eternal damnation."

Itâ€™s a good plan to make plans for certain situations.

Iâ€™m not suggesting you go all â€œDoomsday Prepperâ€ and build a bunker, unless you live in places prone to severe weather that a storm shelter would protect you from, but having a few months worth of long term storable food, some first aid, flashlights and batteries, candles, maybe a store of medicines youâ€™re dependent on, put back for an emergency is a good idea. Also, a small amount of cash stored in a safe spot.

Also a â€œgo bagâ€ with necessities for a couple days in case you need to leave in a hurry.

It can sometimes take weeks to months for services to be fully restored to some areas after a disaster."

news,ferivc5,t1_feqogi3,1579354453.0,"You have two possibilities.

Either the priest really believes that confession of sins will help him get into heaven, or he doesnâ€™t.

If the priest doesnâ€™t believe, mandating reporting will do nothing. The priest will simply not confess.

If the priest does believe, it will be a deterrent since the jig will theoretically* be up after his first confession, and avoiding confession will have severe ramifications for his soul. Either they will avoid sexual abuse acts or get caught fairly quickly.

*I say theoretically because nothing says that a given priest will live up to the legal requirements. There are only two people in the confession box, and no way to prove that something was said or not either way.

Itâ€™s entirely possible that molester priests will confess to each other and cover each otherâ€™s backs. Also, most priests consider the confession seal to be sacred, so even if a priest is entirely on the up and up but they consider that confidence to be inviolable, on pain of eternal damnation."
