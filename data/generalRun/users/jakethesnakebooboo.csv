Damn straight, and please do-- trust me, your party will LOVE it no matter what you play. It's *only* not perfect if you're trying to make it act like a lute. I'm certainly not dissing the oud either, it's a supercool gift and I'm certain you'll enjoy it.

What I meant by ""transposed guitar tuning"" is that the C F Bb Eb G C tuning I mentioned is the same as the guitar's standard tuning of E A D G B E, but the whole thing is tuned down 2 whole steps. It'll still feel and sound a lot different from a guitar, but it removes one barrier to playability."

You will almost certainly give up trying pretty quickly because it doesn't work very well even if you have decades of experience with similar instruments. If it did work, no one would have bothered to design a lute differently from ouds in the first place.""  


If you don't want to fight your instrument every step of the way, the best advice is to watch how real oud players actually play the oud. You don't have to learn actual oud music as you will probably find that just noodling around with a few melodies in a similar idiom is good enough for your D&D party. As for the tuning, you'd probably have an easier time using a transposed guitar tuning so you can use the guitar chord shapes and any melodies or songs that you already know/learn in the future. That tuning would be C2 F2 Bb2 Eb3 G3 C4. Again, you \*might\* have luck tying frets on the neck of your oud, and you might not. Frets \*will\* make it marginally easier to play chords, but the nut end of the neck is still VERY, VERY NARROW and you're going to have a difficult time making chords because it's almost double the strings of a guitar in about half of the space. But by all means, go for it.

The Kingkiller books are great, but do bear in mind that Rothfuss is a fantasy author and not a reputable source of organological information. When you say you want to sound like ""a bard of old"", you're talking about a high fantasy myth with no basis in reality (unless you count renaissance faires and pirate bands). If you're trying to build your expectations of lute playing explicitly around his descriptions and you're attempting to use an oud, you're gonna have a bad time. In reality, the closest instrument to what Rothfuss describes in the books is an acoustic guitar. Maybe a Wandervogellaute. Aiming to sound like a ""bard of old"" is a bit like going shopping and looking for a real, working, battle-ready lightsaber. It's not a real thing, and you're probably going to be disappointed with the lightsabers that are available in reality. If you want to sound like a ren-faire bard, that's really more the province of acoustic guitars and ukuleles. If you want to sound like a lutenist, that's a very different thing from your expectations outlined above. Somewhere, you're going to have to come to a compromise between your vision and reality. I'm sorry if that's not quite the answer you were hoping for."
classicalguitar,ff6psbo,t1_ff44i5a,1579632339.0,"A little? but not really. My main complaint was that it smacks an awful lot of the same kind of ""gimmick"" that used to plague early music: ""Authentic Performance!"" was a cheap selling point targeted at impressing people who weren't in the loop on the relevant musicology. That's why no one claims to be an ""authentic performer"" these days, and the phrase ""Historically Informed Performance"" is used instead-- ""authentic"" suggests that the performance is definitive: ""Exactly as Bach heard it"". ""Historically Informed"" casts the historical aspects of the performance as mere parts of a truly modern whole-- after all, we can read treatises all day every day and we would still not know everything about how Bach actually played Bach. In early music circles it's considered disingenuous or even scammy to make a claim that a performance is ""authentic"", since any modern performance will invariably include decisions informed by the taste of the performer and made without regard to (or in the absence of) historical evidence. Similarly, calling this performance ""unamplified"" implicitly suggests that this recording is a faithful representation of the balance of the ensemble as evident to a listener at a live performance without the aid of amplification. It is objectively not. In reality, one would have to sit where the large diaphragm condenser is placed in order to hear the ensemble balanced as it is in the video. This fact will not be immediately apparent to most people, who will simply be impressed that the guitar seems to hold its own just fine.   


Had this been a live performance, it would certainly make sense to mention in the program that the ""microphones are present not for amplification but for recording"", but drawing attention to the engineering techniques is still kinda gimmicky because it implies that there's something about the manner in which this performance was captured which makes it fundamentally different from any other 'studio' recording (i.e., not in front of a live audience) of similar repertoire/instrumentation. Nearly every 'studio' recording ever made of any concerto for any instrument has used this configuration (close mic on the soloist(s), more distant miking for the rest of the ensemble) or a nearly identical one since at least the 1930s. In fact, every 'studio' recording of the Concierto de Aranjuez specifically was recorded with this same configuration.   


""No conductor"" actually \*does\* mean something unique\* about this performance and you're absolutely right to call attention to that aspect. Your playing is fantastic and stands just fine on its own, no need for gimmicky/clickbaity titles.  


\*inb4 a conductor chimes in to say that as rarely as anyone pays them any attention, they might as well not be there anyway"
lute,ff6ghi2,t1_ff6ewka,1579626683.0,"You could try, but I think you'll find it just doesn't work well. The point is not that ""you should use a pick on an oud"" but that ""the oud is physically laid out in such a way as to make plectrum use most effective"". It's also worth noting that the oud strings are not spaced with chords in mind-- the oud is more of a melody instrument. The neck is a LOT narrower than a lute, which makes everything more difficult for the left hand.
