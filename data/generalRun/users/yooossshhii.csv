thisismylifenow,fe7sztu,t1_fe6ymzt,1578918938.0,"I used to work in a large office building and the company was going through some large layoffs. My small team (5 people) was not included in the layoffs, but the rest of the floor (200 desks?) was sales and was. Much of my team decided to work from home, but I didn't have the set up to do so comfortably.

The motion sensor was at the entrance to a hallway, about 100 feet away from my desk. I ended up finding some long ethernet cable, taping some paper to it and routing it over the lights to my desk. This way, if the lights went off, I had a ""light switch"" that I could just tug to turn it back on."
