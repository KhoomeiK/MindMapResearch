I'm in Missouri. I was told this is paternity fraud and that we must go through the courts, publish the intended adoption if father is not known, or serve father with the stepparent adoption.

Laws may be different in your area. In Missouri, the lack of contact is considered abandonment and it will make for an easy ruling for the stepparent adoption.

Best of luck. We just started our proceedings yesterday. Hope yours goes smoothly!"

Perhaps space is needed, because right now the exchange sounds toxic and unhealthy. Your friend needs time, and you owe it to them, but you also don't have to endure passive aggressiveness while you wait."
