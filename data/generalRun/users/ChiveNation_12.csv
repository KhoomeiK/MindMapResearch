I was in the field for a rotation.. I told my commander before we move I have an emergency and have to go to the shoppette (gas station) for lady issues.. he flat out told me no. We don’t have time.. use what you have. At the time I only had a handful and had to borrow other females.. worst 40 days of my life.. doesn’t help we only showered once a week either.."
