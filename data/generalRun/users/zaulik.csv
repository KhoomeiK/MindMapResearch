Every song he has released over the past year or so that i’ve been here has been linked here a day prior to release thanks to leaks. It’s not like the sub is flooded with hundreds of posts a day."

videos,feiyzxd,t3_epby76,1579151217.0,"Speaking as a straight dude, imagine dressing up as a girl for a day, and having to be that girl for the day. I assume that feeling of discomfort is what it feels like for trans people. To walk around in a body every day that they aren’t comfortable in. 

It’s really only complicated if you over think it. I think a lot of people like to say “How did you know?” As a way to say “I think you’re full of shit” under the guise of being genuinely curious"

GearsOfWar,fe4kbh9,t3_enoybd,1578860215.0,"Gears 2 Horde was fun because it was just you and your raw skill vs swarms of enemies, and at times it was actually a challenge. The Boom shield offered just enough defence to keep the enemies out, but let too many get too close and that shield would go down and all hell would break loose. Completing a wave after a fiasco like that was sooo satisfying

Now Horde has too many gimmicks and is far easier imo. It’s not even comparable and yet its all we have."
