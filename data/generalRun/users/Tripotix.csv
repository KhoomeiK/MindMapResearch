bipolar,fddhfu9,t1_fdb53oj,1578312423.0,"Haha, thank you. I will make sure to share my progress whenever possible. I have actually thought about doing that, I will give it a shot on my next drawing and do it from beginning to end then make a time lapse. I think that would be cool to see! Thanks for the thoughtful response. :)"

bipolar,fda68mj,t1_fda374t,1578242258.0,"Thank you so much for the in depth feedback! The Erlenmeyer flask carries allot of meaning in my life, so I am glad that it stood out to you. It is a representation of the alteration of brain chemicals in psychological illness and also through drug abuse.. I have thankfully been sober 3 years now although bipolar still messes around with my brain chemicals whenever possible hahaha..."

bipolar,fd9pkkn,t1_fd9oqeg,1578236403.0,"It does take a very long time, it is kind of like a journal to me more than a profession. I am not productive enough to ever make a living doing art so I don't care how long it takes! :) Would rather work doing something physical also if I do get back into work that is haha.."

bipolar,f82mw7h,t3_dyou13,1574194306.0,"I feel the same.. the UK weather just gets more and more grey the deeper we get into winter pulling us down with it, then drags on through into the next year for longer than it should..  Everything just feels bland, cold and wet!"
