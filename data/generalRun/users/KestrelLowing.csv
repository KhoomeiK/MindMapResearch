ChoosingBeggars,ffybd1a,t1_ffxkwhw,1580342393.0,"The amount of people with doodles that don't comb their dogs' fur...

I work at a dog daycare and we have a few dogs that we groom, for free, just because we feel really bad.  (basically it's just one of the workers that likes a dog and we just comb them out during the day because otherwise they'd get super matted).  We also sometimes do ""courtesy nail trims"" if they're really bad (mainly honestly if the dog jumps up all the time and it hurts because the nails are super long!).  

And these are people who are spending a lot of money to bring their dogs to daycare (a single day is $31/dog) to get energy out.  We also offer bathing and nail trim services (for an extra fee) at the daycare.

But yeah. So many people are completely misinformed or ignorant about what is needed to keep dogs happy and healthy.  Like a few doodle breeders around us say that dogs can't be groomed until 6 months.  No!  They can be groomed as soon as you get them, but taking them to the groomer should be avoided until they're fully vaccinated."

Dogtraining,fezb5ds,t1_feydsay,1579455585.0,"The big problem with this idea is that you have a big potential to accidentally overface the dog and to poison the reward.

Most behaviorists agree that best practice is to not lure the dog with a treat, but to reward them *after*.  If you bribe and a dog is excited enough by the food, when the food is gone, they're still in the scary environment and they may freak out.  This may result in the dog refusing to be lured by treats and becoming wary or even scared of the rewards!

However, the order of when things happen is very important.  If the dog, of their own accord, goes towards something and after that you mark and reward, the reward will not get poisoned because it's not a cue for the scary thing as it comes after the scary thing.

But that doesn't mean that using treats to lure isn't viable!  And it certainly doesn't mean I haven't done that.  So long as the fear isn't larger than the reward and they're not completely freaked out when the reward is gone, treat baiting can be a quicker and slightly more beginner friendly than shaping the behavior."
Dogtraining,feujfka,t3_eqh5mc,1579387096.0,"So, the ""wheaten greetin'"" is a thing!  It's actually more or less a breed trait so will be harderto train out than other behaviors.

Because of this, I think you may want to take a different tactic.  I know it sounds crazy, but try teaching her to jump up on you.  Train it.  Make it an actual behavior.  I've seen this work several times where when you allow the dog to jump up on you when cued, their jumping becomes much less frantic, they're more likely to be able to manage when not cued to jump up, and honestly everyone just ends up happier in the end!

So do this in a training session first when you're not just getting home.  Train her to basically put her paws up on you, and give her treats and a lot of love.  Do this several sessions and put it on some sort of cue (like tapping your thighs, etc.) and reward that with tons of scritches and pets if she finds that rewarding.  Also train a ""get down"" cue (""off"" is the most commonly used cue so as to not confuse it with laying down) in these sessions as well.

When you come home after you've trained these behaviors, be ready with treats (I say treats because often eating treats can be calming for dogs) and before she can even do anything when you walk in, give the cue to jump up and reward for that.  Then after some loving, give the cue for off and reward for that.

Another behavior you may need to give an outlet to is overexcitement.  A really nice thing to help with that is to set a way they can run a bit.  So maybe you teach her to go to a bed, then run to the rug across the room.  She's still 'zooming', but it's in a predictable way that you're helping control.

Often times when we try to use incompatible behaviors to stop a behavior, we inadvertently ignore the reason for the unwanted behavior in the first place!  Your dog isn't really getting what they ""need"" out of going to a bed and laying down if they're super excited and really feel a huge need to jump up on you.  But, we can control these behaviors to make them more manageable and honestly, when you do that, after some time, you'll find that you often can move to the more 'traditional' way of ignoring them and sending them to a bed."

femalefashionadvice,feo3kul,t3_epzxcz,1579294624.0,"* (circa ~2006) An old, gray, super oversized acrylic cardigan.  This is something that I only wear around the house as it basically serves as a housecoat.  I've really never worn it out and about, but it's lovely and I wear it basically every day when it's cold when I'm at home.
* (circa ~2009) A green cabled sweater with a v-neck.  My mom gave this to me during college when I got my first ""office job"" and I wore it when it was cold about 1-2 times a week.  I don't wear it much anymore as I don't work in an office anymore and so I just occasionally wear it on the weekends.  It's a cotton blend.
* (circa 2004-2019) Handknit socks.  My mom gives me a pair of wool socks every year for Christmas and I've only had to retire and discard one pair that was beyond darning. Those were the pair she made when I was a freshman in high school.  I will say that some others are starting to show their age in the ball joint area and I'll probably have to retire a few more.  I wear them every day in the winter, but as I now have about 12 pairs, they get worn about once every other week.

bestof,fec84d9,t1_fe96h4a,1578968301.0,"As someone else who can't help but chime in...

I think the best explanation, for me, is to showcase when I stopped functioning.  I wasn't diagnosed until I was 28 as honestly, in my childhood my ADHD symptoms weren't that problematic.  I probably do have a ""mild"" case of ADHD in addition.

But I performed really well throughout traditional schooling.  There was a very strict structure within school, goals were very straightforward and generally outcomes/consequences were pretty dang close to my actions.  Additionally, my parents were very involved with my life and made up for most of my deficits (my mom, for example, would go through each subject in school in the morning with me to see if I had homework and if it was in my backpack and she'd ask when I came home what homework I had).

But honestly, I think the biggest thing is that I was one of those super overscheduled kids.  I was taking 4-5 AP classes, most times of the year some sort of extra-curricular was in crunch time, so every single moment of my day was scripted and I didn't have a moment to even think about anything - I just had to do.  It was constant panic mode.

ADHD often makes it very difficult to start tasks and focus unless there's a looming consequence or you're in ""panic mode"".  

Because of this, I had a good set of habits set up that worked pretty dang well through undergrad when I was working a few jobs while taking a fair number of credits and participating in several extra-curricular things.  But when I graduated undergrad and went to grad, I stopped having to work 2 jobs (just TAed) and my life was incredibly less structured.  Nothing felt urgent anymore.

So I flunked.

dogs,fe5najf,t3_entszb,1578871685.0,"So there's this huge misconception that positive reinforcement training just means letting your dog do whatever and if they're not doing what you want them to do, you ignore it.

Yeah, no.  That's not how it actually works.  The whole ""ignore bad behavior"" only works if the dog isn't being rewarded by the bad behavior!  If my dog is jumping up on a little old lady and not responding to my cues, I'm going to use force to remove the dog from the little old lady!  I'm also then going to realize that I really need to train more in that situation...

Additionally, what you consider to be a correction may vary.  Technically speaking, if you stop and stand still or move backwards when your dog pulls on leash, you're giving a correction, even if it's not a leash-pop.  However, we can make that easier by teaching our dog before that when they feel pressure on the leash or when they hear a cue (I used ""oops!"") to come back towards the person, then most people wouldn't consider that to be a correction even if, in the most technical sense it is.

Honestly, I just try and make sure that I'm communicating to my dog in the best way I can following LIMA (least invasive, minimally adverse) principles.  If I come across a situation where I absolutely must manhandle my dog, then I know that's an area I need to work on with training in the future.  Do I get to all of those areas?  No.  There's only so much time and energy in the day, but then I know that I need to manage the situation if a similar thing comes up again.

I will say that where I differ from someone who does use corrections and +P is that I never want a correction to be a part of my training plan.  If something goes wrong, if we find ourselves in a situation that was more than our current training covers, etc. then yeah - I'll use a correction if needed.

Basically, she started to learn when she wouldn't be able to do anything - if the squirrel is across the street, she'll still notice, but she *knows* she can't do anything.

The TEAM2 requires a 5 second stay, so I want to get to be very comfortable up to 10 seconds at least.

Looking through our video, I'm very comfortable with 3 seconds and really need to up that, but she can be successful at about 7 seconds too.  I also need to decide if I'm for sure going to say ""wait"" when she gets there, or not.  It's kinda more elegant if I don't...

And like, I get it - I've fallen to that as well and it's something I try to not do but, I do.  (good god, they have a border collie and they can't even _____?)

I think also that being an off breed, people are actually more likely to be excited by you.  So like if there's two Novice A competitors that both basically just Q - nothing fancy, just do well enough to Q.  If one is a random mutt and one has a well bred golden, the mutt is going to likely get a lot more positive attention for the same level of performance because it's just kinda expected for the golden to be moderately good at it."

I will say after undergrad my life kinda fell apart. The lack of the school structure and family support meant that all of the coping mechanisms that I'd figured out didn't really work anymore and I dropped out of grad school twice and quit my engineering job before they could fire me because I was miserable. So I was really struggling at that point in my life which likely made them more likely to consider adhd.

When it's overflowing, that's how much can fit in the wash and I'm far more likely to do laundry if it's overflowing opposed to having a larger laundry basket. 

Beyond that, I hang everything I can because I hate folding things so that makes me more likely to actually do laundry. The only things that get folded are sweaters, jeans, leggings, and shorts.

I firmly believe that given that we are all day play (which is a misnomer - the dogs do take breaks naturally and for those dogs that can crate and benefit from taking breaks outside of the play groups, we do that) we are as kind to the dogs as we possibly can be. All of us work really hard to be as proactive as possible to stop behavior issues and of the 10 of us who work there, 5 are legit dog trainers.

Also, while sometimes this works great, sometimes it goes horribly, you can try a slightly longer leash - like 10ft instead of 6ft.  Sometimes having that extra bit of length helps dogs be able to wander and sniff a bit instead of only concentrating on the pulling forward!

For an easier transition for those who need something inside, I recommend a litter box.  I used the litter ""yesterday's news"" with my puppy when it was too cold for him to go outside (9 week old puppy, February in Michigan...) and that worked pretty well for a substrate preference that is stuff like leaves, pine needles, etc.  Plus the contained nature of the litter box (I just used a low plastic storage box I owned) meant he was very unlikely to accidentally pee outside of the box."

* Dog training
* Solving a rubix cube

* Embrodery
* Cross stitch
* Quilting
* Designing my own hiking gear
