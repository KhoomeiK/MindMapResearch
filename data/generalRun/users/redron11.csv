Omg this happened to me! Amazon were absolutely useless. Wouldn't give me a refund or let me send the items back (3 x iPhone cases) my bank wouldn't open a fraud case as these were sent to my address using ""my"" Amazon account.
I don't want or need these items and am about ¬£26 out of pocket, re-selling won't do any good because they go for pennies on Ebay. Amazon wouldn't give me any details about who actually bought the items (privacy - sure) and all I could get from customer services were a long chat followed by being referred to a specialist team who sent the same generic email every time. Eventually gave up! Is there still a chance I can get my money back now I know I am part of a scam?"

Paranormal,fcyyjlh,t3_ejeu7d,1578089918.0,An old story from my training hospital: a crash call goes out and the anaesthetist on duty is just about to get in the lift to get to the calling ward. Just as the doors open an old lady comes out asking for directions to the exit. The anaesthetist tells her where the nearest door is. Heads in the lift up to the ward. Gets to the ward which is full of commotion due to the emergency. As he arrives at the bed of the patient in cardiac arrest he realises he recognises the patient as the old lady he just met downstairs. Pretty sure this is an urban legend to scare the student nurses and junior doctors but it always stuck with me!

No employees in the hospital wore a red uniform but the nursing assistant who died wore a vivid red dressing gown when she passed away."
