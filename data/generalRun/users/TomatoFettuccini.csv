It's also ridiculously easy to get large bonuses to disguise. [Disguise is best when paired with a even a moderate bluff score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyvRamX1VyA).

Pathfinder_RPG,ffibar4,t3_eswx47,1579969778.0,"They're not statted out in PF, but you could homebrew some corvids (crows, ravens, magpies, mockingbirds, bluejays) and greater species of parrots (african grey, for example). [Corvids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbSu2PXOTOc) are [freakishly intelligent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerUbHmuY04), to [the point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrYPm6DD44M) of being actually scary in [their intelligence level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGYII1XbE4U).

Most of the animals in PF are carryovers from D&D 3.5, and the animal stats have remained mostly unchanged from the original Dungeons and Dragons from the late 60s, which is why all animals have ""animal intelligence"" of 3.   

&nbsp;

In light of what we know about animals now (animals have intelligence and are worthy or respect and love, and are even acquiring rights) vs what the popular opinion was 60 years ago (""they're just stupid animals who can't feel pain""), think it's perfectly reasonable to petition your DM to restat a number of animals to 4, possibly 5 in exceptional cases.   

&nbsp;

Increasing Int to 4 or even 5 won't really change much for an animal that has an Int of 3 because they still lack many things which would help them become more dominant in the world (opposable thumbs, for example, advanced critical thinking, and the ability to self-reflect being others), even if used as a familiar because 99% of the same limitations are still in place.

After one of the party dying during the initial retreat, they attempted the same encounter the next adventuring day (monster couldn't leave site to pursue because of being divine guardians).

If spell slots are a concern, I suggest a ring of wizardry of the level of your go-to spell; it doubles the slots of that level for all your classes (RAW - the entry says ""wearer’s arcane spells per day are doubled for one specific spell level."" Not ""doubled for one class"".).

This means if you dip into another arcane class and have this ring (say for level 1 spells) with an int of 20 this garners you 22 level 1 spell slots at level 9. You use the spell slots for your non-combat spells (or the ones you cast before you strap on armor)."

Since Wisdom isn't a dump stat with a 0 modifier, you get a decent bump, and ki arcana lets you use arcane and ki points interchangeably.

I only worked there for a season, and never at that calibre of restaurant again. Since then it's been mostly gin joints and dive bars (more my scene).

TheExpanse,ff7qy8g,t1_ff7q960,1579656207.0,"Not far off, I suppose, although I don't think they have alignment in LoL. 

Paladins are holy warriors dedicated to  advancing the cause of a god or ideal, and are required to have an alignment of Lawful Good (meaning they can't do any evil things, and must observe the law). Many people interpret this as what is colloquially known as Lawful Stupid, where they believe they are compelled to right every petty wrong, and be completely rigid in their interpretation and adherence to the law.  

This show demonstrates how to play both the class and the alignment properly.

By season 3, you're on the way to a confluence of avalanches that were started by snowflakes in season 1.  

Epic story, told epically. Ignore the CGI, ignore the production values, ignore the often bad acting. It is so goddam good. Hell, it's worth it just for the Londo and G'Kar relationship/story arc.

I spent 25+ years in the restaurant industry, from pizza joints to 4 ~~Michelin~~ Star restaurants, so admittedly, I'm biased, but even given that, lots of people compete for my money and have better food and service.

Hamilton,ff7d0e9,t1_ff6v6th,1579646708.0,"Honestly, the food isn't nearly good enough anymore to draw me in. I used to go pretty regularly, about once a month, for about a year and a half. After 18 months, the staff still didn't know my name (despite interacting with most of them and having a seat at the bar most visits) and basically greeted me in the same fashion that the homeless dude begging for change on the corner: dead eyes, going through the motions, never really acknowledging me. 

I'm not asking for a hand in marriage or anything, but being greeted by name by people who see me regularly (and whom I tip well) is just Social Interaction 101.

I don't bother anymore: service sucks, food is meh. There are many other restaurants in the city that give me great service in the fashion I'm used to, and have better food, too. 

Hell, even La Luna has better service, and their service is crap, something more easily forgiven when the food is effing amazing (which it is)."
Hamilton,ff6se19,t1_ff6qkhg,1579633895.0,"Mesa's food isn't nearly as good as when they opened. Don't know what happened, but that's what's up. Also, the service is....meh. Their servers are polite, but disinterested in what they're doing and not nearly attentive enough.  

It may be a cultural thing, in terms of Mexican restaurant culture vs. Canadian restaurant culture, but a very stark comparison are the servers at Berkley North; the servers there are cheerful, friendly, outgoing, attentive, and give top-notch service.  

Tbh, I found Mezcal's food decent but inauthentic. Great atmosphere, nice staff, but for really good, authentic Mexican, Hamilton just doesn't cut it. It's a large niche which is virtually untapped in Hamilton."

Dieting isn't about depriving yourself but about retraining habits, one of which is knowing when/how to stop.

Pathfinder_RPG,ff447xq,t1_ff434pq,1579555176.0,"It depends on what you build for. If you want to focus on trained grace, [VMC fighter](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/Classes/character-advancement/#Variant_Multiclassing) is highly recommended (you get 2 more levels of WT/AT, and Bravery, which can be utilized as well).  

TBH, I don't actually know. I'm not a huge min-maxer, more of a tinkerer with build ideas. I've been toying around with a Myrmidarch build myself for a little bit but I don't have enough experience with Fighter. With the Myrmidarch, you want to treat it more as a fighter than a magus when selecting feats. That said, I do have a version of the build that splits the difference a bit closer to magus than fighter. I haven't been able to playtest them because I'm a forever DM. :("
Pathfinder_RPG,ff41pax,t1_ff3xjtg,1579553623.0,"Which, depending on your playstyle, may or may not matter. Bladebound is good, no question, but it's not the be-all/end-all archetype.   

Honestly, a good perusal of the magus spell list will give you a lot of ideas other than a Dervish, to say nothing of the archetypes. Tack on 1/2 level dips into front-loaded classes, and you've got a stew goin' baby!  

Myrmidarch, thanks to Advanced Weapon Training and Advanced Armor Training, now has a huge number of options available to it. Focused Weapon, for example: treat your Magus level as Warpriest levels for your Focused Weapon damage die. This is a great way to get a monstrous single-attack damage die, and then combine it with something like Vampiric touch? Gross.  

You can put together an unarmed, grappling, Super Sayan magus pretty easily. Chill touch is a great debuff; combine it with TWF and you have a quasi flurry of blows that does an extra 1d6 damage +1 Str each attack for your level of attacks. You grapple someone, use a full attack to do damage multiple times, sap strength every round.  

In a game I was a player in, we had a magus that took Swift Armor Style, made liberal use of *ablative barrier*, wore heavy fortification heavy plate, was half undead (meaning nonlethal means nothing), and somehow also got DR 10/-, plus all the various energy resistance spells she could cast, and focused on vital strike *vampiric touch*. Just.... damn. Unbelievably tanky and dagerous AF.

Pathfinder_RPG,ff41atd,t1_ff3ylmo,1579553374.0,">!It will erupt at the end of Book 4.!<  I mean. the only way they would really know about it is if they ran into someone who had been there. This means past party members, probably the cleric, who could be at the Sandpoint Cathedral.   

I don't know what, specifically you could do about it. What I said in my first comment is kind of a plot point (starts a ticking clock), so unless they specifically know about it, which they wouldn't, I'd just let it happen. Also, >!killing everyone in the catacombs feeds the Runewell!; Karzoug awakens when the Major Runewell under Jorgenfist gets filled, then explodes, causing others in the region to explode sympathetically.!<   

The catacombs are cleared out: in my game, the party made it their base and used some shenanigans from Ultimate Campaign to get 1/3 price crafting and double the daily gp limit for crafting magic items. Fortunately, I don't give them much downtime, and because they're now level 14, encounters, injuries, and death are swiftly dealt with. In-game time, they handled all of Book 4 in about 5 days; they had about 2 weeks of travel time to reach >!Jorgenfist!<, then ROFLStomped it and gained 3 levels in 5 days. One player (the rogue) practically one-shotted a old red dragon. Another player (the druid) died (dead-dead) *twice* in one encounter. She dies on the regular.  


There's no reason you can't have the catacombs re-populate. If enough time has passed, some, if not all of the previous occupants could be repopulated (or new ones pop in). >!You could say that Ameiko reports of strange noises coming from the old smuggler tunnel connected to the Glassworks, leading her to ask the old party for help, having them come to you to help because they are unable to.!< /u/ZakGM has a good idea about letting time pass. I agree."
Pathfinder_RPG,ff3xcmv,t3_eqrx3f,1579550910.0,"All sorts of different builds.  

Puppet master will make you the King of Mind Control.  

The Staff Magus, along with Spear Dancing Style, will allow you to wield a bardiche one-handed, as a quarterstaff, and still do Spell Combat. This build ends up having a higher AC than the regular magus because it gets their staff enhancement bonus as a shield bonus to AC.     

Strength Magus goes a different way from the Dex magus, in that you *want* to get big and stomp face. Survivability is tough in the early levels but once you get medium armor that changes.   

Whip-wielding debuff builds are a hoot.   

Eldritch Archer is a stupendous archetype. Multiclassing with it leads to some fun shenanigans (like being able to deliver heal spells with yoru arrows)."
