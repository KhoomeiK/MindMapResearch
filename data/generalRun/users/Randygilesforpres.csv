Cats meow for attention. I often suggest the vacuum trick here on this sub. Vacuum outside bedroom door, power cord under the door inside. When cat meows, plug in vacuum. It will eventually be trained not to meow at the bedroom door.

Kittens are a terror to sleep with. For me, it is allergies. Not terrible ones, but if I sleep with my face on a pillow that a cat has been on, everything gets puffy and stuffed. It is just my luck of the draw.

AskWomen,ffj7yjn,t3_etn8am,1579992637.0,"I’ve often been called intimidating. Ironically, it changes if I engage.

If I don’t engage, I assume it is my height, my stature, and my aloofness which is masking shyness. I’m never rude I just don’t speak a lot in big groups I don’t know. I also appear confident, though internally I’m not, I just project that as a facade. 

If I engage, many have called me “disarming”. I moved a lot as a child and had a narcissist as a single parent. This really shaped the way I deal with people, and my natural instincts seem to make people comfortable when I engage.

It helps that my laugh is infectious, so I am told. And I laugh a lot.

I’ve never really understood the intimidating part. It happens most when a friend invites me to something with their other friends I don’t know. I do tend to have close friendships with friends, so maybe they are aware of that and THAT is intimidating?
