Forget the trashy anatomy for a second, her skin is a dingey white and her hair is purple. If the native Americans in my family are anything to go off, her hair shouldn't have beachy waves, either. *Disney's* Pocahontas was more faithful to its character design, and that's setting the bar low...


Edit: just noticed her blue eyes and lazy attempt at face paint."

intj,ffvr9og,t3_evhi6d,1580271029.0,"Just ignore them. If they try to get you involved, play (or pretend to play) problem solver. For instance, the Gossip approaches you and starts blabbing about how he/she can't stand Susan in Accounting. You respond with, ""Well, if it bothers you that much, maybe we can talk it out with Susan, and see if we can't reach an agreement""

That's usually enough to get them to avoid you, because Gossips normally want a problem to complain about, not a solution."
