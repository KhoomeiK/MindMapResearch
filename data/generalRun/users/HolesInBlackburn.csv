Your description of America is dripping with stereotypes perpetuated by headlines. Many of us aren't obese, don't hate the government, aren't getting shot, and avoided student loan debt. Not to invalidate those who deal with those things, but it's not the experience of every American. We are a rich and diverse community with lots of experiences."
