I'm not claiming anything, I'm asking you to demonstrate your assertion. This seems to be a difficult concept for you to grasp.

Yet another baseless assertion, which I am not claiming whatsoever. If things are true, it's because they are demonstrable, not because of ""no reason whatsoever"".

> because negation of POSR proves they exist.

The negation of a concept does not, in any way, demonstrate that concept.

Yet another baseless assertion. Demonstrate it.

> This is a contradiction, therefore POSR is true and everything has a reason or efficient cause.

You have a repeating pattern of baseless assertions leading to unverifiable conclusions, all based on philosophy rather than demonstrability. This is also an example of the black/white fallacy (https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/black-or-white) where you come to conclusions based on concepts that science does not yet fully understand, but where philosophy asserts that it does, without demonstration.

Yet *another* baseless assertion from an argument of ignorance. If we don't know, then the answer is ""we don't know"" rather than ""it must then surely be..."".

A breathtakingly obvious example of an argument from ignorance.

> Im simply observing that there are two options for the spacio temporal chain of causality: Either 1, time is finite, then there is literally a first cause, or a principle which is present at the first discrete moment of time.

Black/white fallacy. This is also saying ""we don't know, so it must be god"".
