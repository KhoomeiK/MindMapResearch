Calgary,ffgvyp7,t1_ffgvls9,1579916451.0,"Adorable. 

But I’m not talking about a colonoscopy."
RoastMe,ffghlje,t3_eti15z,1579906413.0,You look like a sick Victorian child who won’t make it through the winter.
fatlogic,ffgh4aa,t1_ffggnsb,1579906103.0,It was getting annoying as I was seeing him post sexual crap all over the place so i blocked him.
Calgary,ffgdn96,t1_ffgak07,1579903906.0,"I just finished setting up the account and the activation code is being mailed to me, it was super easy.

Edit: also thank you for the nice words, i feel more confident about calling now."
Calgary,ffgcpke,t1_ffgbzx1,1579903324.0,"Thanks so much for the honest yet encouraging answer. It's hard to talk about with the people close to me, i dunno, it still has a weird stigma attached to it and I feel afraid of anything going on down there that shouldn't. Mine was initially LSIL. But its a recurring LSIL. So i had it when i was very young, then it went away and returned when i was 28. Truly sucks, but im glad you felt confident in our health care system. Makes me feel like im in good hands should something go wrong."
Calgary,ffgchyn,t1_ffgbglm,1579903193.0,"Thanks so much for the helpful answer! Mine was LSIL on pap and the doctor said it still looked low grade while conducting the biopsy but she did take two biopsies... and yes wow it was painful. I was on day 1 of my cycle and they don't reschedule if you are on your period so i had tenderness and bad cramps to begin with so it was extra painful and sensitive. I'm not particularly afraid of the LEEP per say, if they come back as CIN2... but its just the waiting that is really gut wrenching.

I know this is the best thing to do for myself but wow, you sure feel weird after the appointment, that kind of deep, internal ache from your cervix is unlike anything i've ever felt (then again i havent had kids so) it made me cry on the drive home and i felt so silly. But yea, 6-8 weeks just seems insane. At what point did you get yours?"
Calgary,ffg8lkg,t1_ffg6z0t,1579900804.0,"Ugh, yea this gives me anxiety. I'll probably give them a call on monday as they are shut down for the weekend. It just seems like an insane amount of time to wait."
Calgary,ffg8b2w,t1_ffg86j4,1579900626.0,im very confused at what this has to do with precancerous cervical cells.
Calgary,ffg7ucy,t1_ffg7mdy,1579900337.0,I'm talking about women who got a biopsy done. A doctor can't eyeball abnormal cells.
Calgary,ffg7pu6,t1_ffg7mpw,1579900259.0,you had a vaginal exam? lol
AskReddit,ffg7kgi,t1_ffg77ja,1579900167.0,where do you live? if you don't mind me asking. I live in Canada and i was worried it was the slowness of public health or if im just overthinking.
Calgary,ffg7i47,t1_ffg6wge,1579900125.0,"This definitely seems like the most reasonable thing to do, I think i just have this anxiety that they will get irritated with me for calling because they told me not to call because THEY would call me."
Calgary,ffg7eex,t1_ffg6n3f,1579900062.0,"I appreciate the answer a lot! I will mention that although the words look the same, my biopsy was for my cervix, a colposcopy not a colonoscopy.
That being said I'm sure the advice is still valid. I'm just a little worried as the doctor typically cant eyeball problems in my situation unless its cancer"

AskDocs,fffc4sy,t1_fffbhyq,1579880707.0,"I think the doctor was stumped, and was against a tonsillectomy. 
I should suggest he get bloodwork and a urinalysis then.
He has had a hard life, lost a parent very young, dealt with a bunch of family BS."
AskDocs,fffbb9x,t1_fffaxrs,1579880186.0,"I agree, I certainly think its worsened since his busy season hit. But he's apparently had this recurring strep thing since he was like 12."
AskDocs,fff90ua,t1_fff86c3,1579878705.0,"His siblings apparently used to get strep a lot as well. I mean, I will ask him the next time I see him when his last STD blood test was, but it was most certainly within the last year.

All the same, it would be best to encourage him to get it done."
trashy,ffel0d5,t1_ffeg2cm,1579852489.0,It’s not. Sadly.

trashy,ffegej9,t1_ffefbpg,1579846991.0,Don’t worry... that’s not a commenter who is worth correcting.
trashy,ffegc5p,t3_et60p8,1579846919.0,"The article closes with; 

“...He said he had his reasons”

Hopefully that’s enough of a statement from him to make people truly understand why women in abusive relationships cannot leave. Does that sound like a man filled with remorse? She knew he could kill her, and she knew he was willing to risk a lifetime of jail than see her happy or move on with someone else. The saddest part is that he also had likeminded friends if he felt that comfortable sharing footage of how he beat her"
