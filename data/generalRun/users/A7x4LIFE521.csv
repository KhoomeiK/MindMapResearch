AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,ffdfgzt,t1_ffby5ox,1579819772.0,"So I have shit vision and used to sleep with no aid (I sleep with my contacts in usually all the time now). One time, when I was in maybe 7th grade, I was in bed going to sleep. Lights were off but the random highlights in the room allowed my blurry vision to make out whatever imagery they could out of the stuff I had. I didn’t have much lying around, all except for a conveniently shaped pile of garbage bags (full of clothes) about 5 ft away from my bed, that I could not convince myself didn’t look like the original exorcist girl sitting back against my closet door, head cocked, and looking dead at my face. At first, I didn’t look away from it. Didn’t want to risk it moving closer to me without me looking. Probably spent about a solid minute or two paralyzed but it felt like forever staring at it. I vividly remember how sweaty and hot my face began to feel the longer I looked and I just didn’t move a muscle. Eventually I remember slowly descending into my covers and every other moment I’d peak one eye out to look. Every time I looked, it was still there, the same form and face I saw each previous time. It fucked with me so bad and yet somehow I eventually managed to convince myself that it was the garbage bags and then I went to sleep.
I want to say i shot out of bed, got the lights, and fussed with the bags to get them to not look creepy but I can’t exactly remember.

TLDR: blurry vision, dark bed room, pile of bags translated into the exorcist girl, felt paralyzed but got over it"
