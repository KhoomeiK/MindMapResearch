whowouldwin,fdkpeaz,t3_elurz9,1578508387.0,"Challenge 1: Physically/combat wise or more so their influence and presence?

Physically/Combat: **Rorke** - he’s the biggest out of the three, and has the best combat history feats.

Influence/Presence: **Menendez, no contest.**
- Quoted by Harper, one of the characters in Black Ops 2: ""He's the most dangerous terrorist since Osama bin Laden."" 

- The Admiral in the game stated: ""People in America... idolize him"", despite him being the one responsible for the blood spilled on US Soil. 

- Menendez even had moles in the CIA. 

- Even after his death, his whole influence of events in Black Ops 2 shaped Black Ops 3.

Challenge 2: Forces ranked.
- Probably **Cordis Die** Despite the majority of the army being made up of mercenaries and militia, Cordis Die has supporters from all around the world. The wiki states the amount of supporters was around 2 billion. I’m not sure if that’s the exact number from the game, but Cordis Die were able to challenge the United States and China in a war. 

- Runner up would be the Ultranationalists. They were able to seize control of Russia for a bit and were gave the United States a troublesome fight in their home turf. 

- The Federation is last because they were at war with the United States for over a decade and then lost much of its power towards the end.

Challenge 3: Bad to worst outcome for the US.
- Makarov’s plan really only gave Russia an incentive to invade the United States. This would be the best outcome for the United States out of the three because they would still have their entire army and arsenal good to go.

- Rorke’s plan of bombarding the United States with its own ICBMs would’ve been the worst for them if it weren’t stopped in the process. The United States still fought the Federation to a standstill despite some major cities being bombarded.

- **Menendez’s plan** of weaponizing all of the United States’ military drones was the worst for them to deal with. The United States military had to fight back both Cordis Die and their own entire fleet of drones, which all eventually self destruct. Essentially, their entire fleet of drones were against them and then no longer usable.

Challenge 4: Most evil to least.
- **Makarov, no contest.** Him massacring an entire airport of his own country’s people just to incite a war should say it all. If that’s not enough, he also gas attacked London.

“This man Makarov is fighting his own war and he has no rules. No boundaries. He doesn't flinch at torture, human trafficking, or genocide. He's not loyal to a flag or country or any set of ideals. He trades blood for money.” - General Shepherd

- Runner up would be Rorke. He’s pretty sadistic but not nearly to the extent of Makarov. What makes him the runner up was when he tortured the protagonist and his father, and then executed the father in front of the protagonist.

- Menendez is last because he at least believes he comes from a place where his actions are justified. It started out when he had witnessed American supported Contras and his perceived atrocities of their actions. While they were seeking refuge, him and his sister were living in a warehouse that was burned down by its American owner in order to collect $11,000 through insurance fraud. Later, the death of his sister had happened as a result of the CIA invading his property.

Because Kurse is more powerful than Hulk. Kurse swatted away Thor w/Mjolnir multiple times. Never seen Hulk do such things. Kurse no sold all of Thor’s punches. Thor’s punches staggered Hulk and made him grunt in mild pain.

>Unfortunately, he can't soak up Stormbreaker.

“**Stormbreaker definitely has the capability of cutting through Kurse seeing how it cut clean through Thanos.** However, Thor is going to have a tough time landing an effective hit seeing how Kurse [has demonstrated good reaction timing.](https://gfycat.com/tinypalatableamericanratsnake) [And in close quarters.](https://gfycat.com/gloomyenormousamericancrocodile)”

whowouldwin,fdfsqkq,t1_fdfrbd7,1578369273.0,"I mean don’t get me wrong, the feat was impressive but it would’ve been more impressive if Thor moved it himself and not with holding on to Rocket Racoon’s ship. The thing is in Endgame, Thanos was still able to overpower Thor when they locked arms. And the best strength feat Thanos showed without stones was prying Hulk’s arms off of him and lifting him into the air. The Marvel website lists him at 1150 lbs for his comic version. So it’s safe to assume MCU Hulk is around that weight. Which is way less than the boulder Kurse lifted and threw."
whowouldwin,fdfkof1,t3_el2y1m,1578363933.0,"R1: Kurse deflected Mjolnir like it was nothing. So this fight is pretty much an unarmed IW Thor. Yes, Thor had became stronger in IW but doesn’t have any unarmed feats aside from being beaten by Thanos at the beginning. Seeing how he no sold Thor’s punches before, I’m going with Kurse 8/10 against IW Thor w/Mjolnir.

R2: A little closer fight. Stormbreaker definitely has the capability of cutting through Kurse seeing how it cut clean through Thanos. However, Thor is going to have a tough time landing an effective hit seeing how Kurse [has demonstrated good reaction timing.](https://gfycat.com/tinypalatableamericanratsnake) [And in close quarters.](https://gfycat.com/gloomyenormousamericancrocodile)

Despite moving the rings of Nidavellir being an impressive strength feat, I’d still put Kurse’s raw strength feat of [lifting a multi hundred ton boulder into the air and throwing at a fast speed across a considerable distance at Thor.]
(https://gfycat.com/perkynegativehyracotherium) Note how the boulder crashing caused the entire setting to shake.

[Someone did a calculation on this feat.](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/forums/gen-discussion-1/mcu-kurse-boulder-feat-1827540/?page=1) It’s one of the most if not most impressive raw strength feat  in the MCU.

If Thor w/Stormbreaker and Kurse locked arms like Thor did with Thanos in Endgame, Kurse would be overwhelming Thor.

whowouldwin,fcz2wfy,t3_ejgt17,1578092570.0,"This battle prompt brings back some sweet memories. Anyways:

R1: Despite Shepherd being an older guy, him being a General of the US army makes it not surprising that he’s very skilled in H2H combat seeing how he effectively beat down Captain Price who is a seasoned SAS Captain. He’s listed as 5’10. 

Rorke is 6’3 230 lbs and looked buff in game. So he’s a bit bigger than Shepherd. Though he’s 53 in the game so I’m guessing he’s like a decade or a few years younger than Shepherd. Rorke was the leader of the Ghosts squad and also has many years of combat experience to his name. IIRC, one of the Ghosts member, Elias, referred to Rorke as the greatest amongst them.

I’d say Rorke physical attributes gives him an edge in H2H. Rorke 7/10

R2: Rorke led 15 men to victory against an enemy force of around five hundred combatants. They stealthily hid beneath their fallen soldiers and they resorted to their weapons, then knives, then their bare hands to defeat them all. 

I don’t recall Shepherd having a feat as impressive as this. Rorke would take this in an enclosed setting where stealth options are available for him to utilize.

Rorke 8/10

R3: The United States Army ultimately won against the Ultra-nationalists and the OpFor in the Modern Warfare series in which the war took place from 2011 and ended in 2016. 

In CoD: Ghosts, The Federation are still at war against the United States for over 10 years. The game ends with the nullification of their main operations to establish dominance over the United States. And much of their forces were destroyed as a result.

Shepherd and the United States Army 9/10"
