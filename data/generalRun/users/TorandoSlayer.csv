Horses,ffxb944,t1_ffxaxpn,1580321600.0,"Ayy, Slayers unite! What a beautiful horse, I don't think I've heard of that breed but looking it up I can see it is an absolutely beautiful one! Is she liver chestnut or chocolate palomino? Either way it seems like that would be a rare color for the breed."

YouShouldKnow,ffx4kaq,t3_evgrt1,1580317608.0,"Yeah blinking check engine lights only happen when something has REALLY gone wrong. I and my husband's car did that on a road trip once. Turned out one of the spark plugs failed. Luckily we were able to limp through the wilderness as long as we didn't go over about 60mph and 3-1/2RPMs, as I guess it was one of the plugs that only kicked in at higher speeds and gears. Spark plugs are easy to DIY, usually, but in our engine half the plugs were buried underneath the other half, so we had to have it professionally done. We managed to make it across the plains and over the mountains in it, (there were no mechanics for miles where we were, and if there were, they were closed over the weekend) but it was stressful. Every time we pushed too hard the light would blink again and we had to slow down.

Additionally, if the oil light comes on, pull the heck over and stop the car because that light doesn't come on until you're really low on oil and your engine will absolutely break if you don't put oil in it asap."

interestingasfuck,ffs8uig,t1_ffs6oc2,1580175978.0,"The surgery itself went perfectly fine. The nurses were even a little surprised how well I was doing when I woke up, as I was pretty alert and remembered some things from right before the surgery that most people don't remember. The recovery was pretty darn rough, however. Very painful for quite a while. Most pain medicine didn't put a dent in it. Went on for like, a week? Two weeks maybe? I honestly don't remember. I had to wake up every two hours during the night to take more pain meds, for several days. 

However, I'm quite glad to be rid of my tonsils. Tonsillitis plus a really bad gag reflux is a terrible combination."

interestingasfuck,ffrsoaz,t1_ffrpwxk,1580164952.0,"I was so happy when they brought one of these out before I went in for my tonsillectomy. My veins are also super difficult and I'd been dreading getting stuck more than the surgery itself. I'd never seen a veinfinder before but it made things ways easier for everyone. I wish they'd used one for when I had my wisdom teeth removed...took them longer to stick me than the actual surgery took, and it was painful and frustrating."

oddlysatisfying,ffrrg42,t1_ffrmzkq,1580164170.0,"Yeah it's a little too slow. Maybe a slow down closer to the landing, but not for the whole throw. 

But then again, maybe they only had a basic slow mo function in their default video editor and some is better than none. It can be hard to find a good video editing app if you don't normally have to edit videos."
