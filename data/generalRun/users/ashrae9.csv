I wonder where all the superstitions come from about black cats? Doesn't make sense, they're all too sweet to be evil in any way."

veganrecipes,fdfen19,t1_fdfdxam,1578359902.0,"No problem. This one is Impossible to mess up. You could add vegan veggie ground, tofu, and/or really any veggies you want. I’ve used mushrooms, celery, carrot, chopped spinach, etc. I usually add jalapeños too."
veganrecipes,fdfdsfh,t1_fdfcy6w,1578359333.0,"Soooo easy. Potatoes diced, onion diced, half yellow pepper, half red pepper diced, half jar salsa, can corn, can diced tomatoes, can black beans, can kidney beans, 4c water, taco seasoning, smoked paprika, fresh garlic. Throw everything in a pot or slow cook like I did. Delicious with rice or pasta noodles added instead of potato. 

Meal preps about 6-8 servings. Serve with tortilla chips or naan bread or whatever, really. Freezes well."
BodyAcceptance,fd3koet,t3_ejps6o,1578159191.0,"Most of us would be less concerned about what other people think if we realize that they never really do think about us at all.

I know this may not help, but trust in me saying that no one will be thinking anything like this, and anyone who does is a complete and total shitbag. We all fluctuate in terms of our shape and size, which is totally normal. Not to mention the struggles you have had in your past and how much you have done to overcome them. You should be proud of yourself.

On another note, I'm willing to bet that your friend   wants you to officiate the wedding, not because of your looks, but because having you as a friend greatly enriches their life in many ways that do not involve your appearance.

Wishing you all the best, and I hope you have a great day and that you try your best not to focus on yourself, but on the people who love you, care about you, and want you to be happy and healthy. Much love."

AskReddit,fd2ox15,t1_fczuylb,1578150279.0,"I love this. I have two cats. Back when I only had one, she always wanted to go outside but we lived near a busier Road and didn't want her to get injured. I used to take her out early in the morning on her leash into the little green space between the apartments I used to live in. She absolutely loved it, but I was well aware of the eyes peering down at me from the apartments, judging me. Whatever, I didn't care. Nowadays, I live by a beautiful Park with a 5km running path. I take my cat to the grassy area and we chill without judgment. I don't care though... if she is happy I'm happy."
