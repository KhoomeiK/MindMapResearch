AskReddit,ffgchqi,t1_fffowz6,1579903189.0,"Sure but it was written centuries after the story took place (likely) by a Christian monk. He may not have been a descendent of Cain in the original story, if there was one, but he certainly is in the story we know today.

Beowulf is a strange neat mixture of pagan and Christian themes, I love it."
news,fffib0l,t1_ffez3dh,1579884571.0,We have a CBD lounge where I live. You can just walk in and they'll give you a thick CBD dab right at the counter for like $5. I think it'll be legal here pretty soon.
todayilearned,ffch6zk,t1_ffby7js,1579799384.0,"What do you mean by ""doesn't go off""? Stale bread definitely gets gross and moldy."
WeWantPlates,ff6yaib,t1_ff6v73m,1579637377.0,Ceramics and glass will absolutely destroy your knives. They're the worst possible cutting board material.
todayilearned,feu9psb,t1_fetwzxc,1579384531.0,"Actually the only state that allows it is Arizona. It did have a slight resurgence in parts of the south during the 90s (when people wanted to ""get tough on crime"") but it's back out.

The deep south can be rough, but it's not all bad."
Metal,feeoxbq,t1_feedv7m,1579038158.0,"Tbh I really don't notice a huge difference in vocals. They're both pretty raw and throaty, what makes you dislike the new guy?

I saw them in Gainesville a few months ago (with new vocalist obviously) and I loved it. Musically I do like the earlier thrashy albums better than radiant light, but I still enjoy that album a good deal."
BlackPeopleTwitter,febdpr8,t1_feaxpwo,1578957770.0,"I don't even mind them doing drugs, it's the fakers that keep me from doing anymore than offering food. There's been a handful of fakers from my town show up on the front page within the past year, so I've just stopped unless I see them sleeping on the streets."
ufl,feayree,t1_fe90u5o,1578953637.0,"And if it doesn't, go in and talk with them. Last year when the building flooded and everyone's aid was delayed I waited until like November to go harass them about it and they were able to push it through quickly. If I'd gone in earlier I would've had an easier time with groceries and rent."
WTF,feavrj5,t1_feauc57,1578952672.0,Thanks for the link! I just googled and found a couple of studies ranging 8-20% so I went in the middle. EPA is probably the best source though.
WTF,feat2xq,t1_feaofx2,1578951961.0,"I think it's about 15% depending on the study you look at, but it's important to consider that's largely methane (animal agriculture is nearly half of our methane production) - which is significantly worse than CO2. 15% is a large chunk on an individual level, and is easier to change than many other things. 

And you're certainly correct that there are environmental impacts from plants, but those same impacts are an additional cost of animal agriculture due to the amount of feed that must be grown.

There's not a perfect solution, but I really do think cutting meat mostly out is a big benefit. 15% reduction is much better than none."
WTF,feae1at,t1_feaaoyj,1578947440.0,"How do you feel about the environmental argument? I'm not hugely against small scale hunting or fishing, but the massive industries we have are absolutely terrible and I think that reducing meat consumption is the best thing the average person can do for the environment. 

The vast majority of plastic pollution is fishing nets for example. And a large percentage of greenhouse gas production comes from cattle (not to mention the incredible amount of water needed to grow the soy for feed)."
WTF,feadcay,t1_feaao2z,1578947244.0,"Agreed, but that's extremely different than ""need"". I like plastic and driving my car everywhere, but those are both still bad for the planet. Meat is in a similar boat, it's convenient and we like it, but it's not environmentally feasible."
gifs,fea7bvn,t1_fe91neq,1578945204.0,"Really? Where are you from? I'm in a fairly small city (~135,000) and even we have a number of abandoned buildings. Lots of old industrial stuff and a couple buildings that were abandoned mid construction after the 2008 recession."
todayilearned,fdy5pfp,t1_fdxpmit,1578776388.0,"They're interesting guys, and I like listening to them, but it should be noted they are not at all reputable. They've had some ideas which there's a bit of evidence for, but they also promote completely batshit ideas that no reputable scientist should promote. Listen to them if you'd like, but take everything with a huge grain of salt. 

Graham Hancock's first book hinged on the Earth Crustal Displacement hypothesis, which is entirely untrue and hasn't been accepted since we discovered  plate tectonics. There isn't a shred of evidence for it. He also believes that early human structures were built using telekenesis. Additionally, they have a persecution complex and don't accept the standard scientific process of peer review and evidence (hence the ""persecution"")."
videos,fdqzer4,t1_fdqr64v,1578677337.0,"You're edging into ""dangerously paranoid gun nut"" territory with that conspiracy theory. 

I agree keeping ammo and gun in separate safes kinda defeats the purpose of having a gun in case of a dangerous emergency, but it's not some grand conspiracy."
worldnews,fdnfmfz,t1_fdmxoua,1578584776.0,"That's true, but mining is way way less avoidable than fossil fuels. Lithium, uranium, metals for solar panels, everything needed for renewable energy has to be mined. 

Not to mention all our luxury goods which also need metal."
awfuleverything,fdmjd20,t1_fdm1dn5,1578552031.0,The only real sexual deviants in Florida are the old people who move here to retire in The Villages. This is some Alabama bullshit.

todayilearned,fc6sak9,t1_fc6rj0d,1577488207.0,"I can't drink that one, it's got a strong metal taste compared to the others. Publix ginseng tea has ruined me, anything else is bad in comparison."
