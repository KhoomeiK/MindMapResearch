DecidingToBeBetter,fdfwvd0,t3_eky1sd,1578372404.0,"Start small. I've recently started making a habit out of cleaning up my apartment first thing in the morning, right after I shower (sometimes even with the towel still on lol). Each morning, I wash any dishes I used the day before, toss any papers or garbage laying around, tidy up the living room (fold blankets, fluff the pillows on the couches etc), and quickly make my bed. 

It's not about it being perfect, it's about feeling accomplished first thing in the morning and then having a clean environment to work in, since I work from home. If you don't, consider that doing this gives you a nice clean environment to come home to! This also doubles as a way for me to enjoy being lazy about cleaning after a long day at work, cause I know it'll get done first thing in the morning! Also, since I'm doing it every day, most days it takes me less than 10 minutes just to freshen things up.

I also started keeping my desk cleaner. I find I'm much more focused on work with a clean desk. No clutter in my space, no clutter in my mind! And it makes me proud of the environment I'm creating cause everything looks elegant and clean and professional. 

Last, regarding sleep, I started using the sleep cycle app which I've only been doing for a few days so far but I really enjoy it. I just use it in place of my alarm. It's interesting to wake up and be able to see how much sleep I got and how many times I was almost awake and when I was sleeping deeply. I am confident that over time it will help me learn more about my sleeping patterns and thus improve them.

By the way, I didn't see you mention nutrition but that's something to pay attention to also! Check out the mealtime app...it makes it super easy to make healthier meals by giving you recipes and even builds a grocery list for you automatically which makes shopping a lot faster. I used it for a few weeks religiously, and after that time I started to remember the types of stuff typically used in the recipes and even started creating my own healthier meals just for fun!

So, good job. Cut out the cancer ... be angry, but remember in a while that it feels really f'ing good to forgive and know that you're strong enough to better yourself DESPITE what others may do to try to bring you down. THAT is *true* power."
DecidingToBeBetter,fcxtgvw,t3_ejevpg,1578070198.0,"First, congrats on deciding to be better. I love your enthusiasm and your plan of action, however convoluted it may be at the moment! 

I've got a simple idea to help you get through this a bit easier: there's obviously something about your bed and probably your room that brings you comfort. In an effort to bring that same comfort to a more productive space, how do you feel about moving part of your room to a different location in your home, if possible? For example, if your desk is in your bedroom, maybe moving it into the living/dining room and rearranging the furniture a bit. If that's not possible, maybe pick a different corner in a different room for your ""music"" corner (bathrooms have natural reverb...just sayin, and playing trombone in the bathroom sounds pretty fucking funny to me, lol)

If you can't physically move the furniture around because you're in a home w/ roommates, parents, etc, maybe you have some small decorations/knick-knacks or a poster/pictures hanging on the wall that you could move to a different location where you can do the studying/work you need to do. 

These of course may not be possible for you, but just something to think about. The psychological trick behind it is to shift your comfort zone from your bed, where it currently is, to a more productive space, so that you can feel comfortable while being productive and it doesn't feel so much like ""work"" that you ""have"" to do.

I got this idea from my experience of years of working from home: when I first started working from home I had my desk in my bedroom so I would roll outta bed and start work in my underwear, then maybe eventually I'd put on some pajama pants and before I knew it it was 5pm and I felt so lethargic and wasteful I just wanted to go back to sleep. First I moved my desk out of my room. That helped. Then about a year later, I decided I wanted to stand at work, so I set up my workspace on top of the bar in my kitchen! it looked super ghetto, but it worked and I felt a lot more ""active"" during work. Then after several months of that I bought a new desk (a motorized stand/sit desk so I can alternate between sitting and standing) and set it up in my living room. By that point I was at least getting out of my bedroom consistently. Finally, most recently I upgraded to a space with a completely separate office where I work. My office is my office, my bedroom is my bedroom, my living area is my living area. Along the way I took little pieces of comfort with me from room to room, and now I'm a lot more productive than I used to be ... albeit I still have a LOT of improving to do. 

Just thought I'd share!"
DecidingToBeBetter,fcxq3mh,t3_ejhget,1578068793.0,"Do you like reading? For me going to a physical bookstore like B&N and wandering around just reading little excerpts of books for 30-60 minutes can really inspire me and get me in the mood to learn/improve myself (I mean ... Starbucks is in there! nom nom nom). Half the time I go I come back with a new book, and the other half I come back w/ a clear mind and new ideas for the future. 

If you don't like reading, maybe the solution isn't to completely quit using the internet, but redirect your time on it to something productive/functional. Any skills you might be interested in learning? Want to learn to play an instrument? (Youtube is awesome for that!) Maybe some sort of DIY project around the house? 

I don't think using the internet is a bad thing ... it's wasting time that's a bad thing. Mindlessly browsing reddit/facebook/whatever is a massive time-suck but it will probably be easier for you if you can just find something productive to do when you do use it, than to just stop using it altogether.

Within the next two weeks (ideally you can do this all in 1-2 days of 5-6 hours each day!) I want you to find 11 hours where you can listen to the whole thing, in particular the section on CLARITY (Habit #1). 

I went on a long drive to head home for the holidays and I listened to the entire thing in one sitting, and to be honest, I don't usually rant and rave about self-improvement books but this one I seriously feel has the potential to change my life. It helped me with almost the exact same problems you're struggling with ... finding clarity and meaning in my life and I now have a very clear idea of who I want to be. 

The reason I want you to do this NOW is because you're 25 ... exactly 10 years younger than me, and if you do it now you'll be on the same path as me but 10 years earlier. Seriously, trust me, listen to this book. It's excellent (despite the sales pitchy-ness of it, which tbh I think is justified cause it's so good; I just ignored that).

When you're done come back to this post and let me know what you thought and whether or not you have more clarity. 

Sidebar:

> I don't have the time, money, discipline of confidence to do the things I wish to do

Discipline and confidence come from within. You do have them, you just need to dig them up and display them like a boss. Time can be managed. And money will come when you add value to peoples' lives

> I don't have the talent or time to be a great performer/artist/athlete

BS. Talent is not innate. It's learned. I taught myself how to play piano and have no been playing for over 12 years. You DO have talent, you just need to figure out what it is.

> I don't have a lot of friends with whom I could do crazy/important/fun things

Do things that are fun for you and you will find people w/ similar interests. Also, there's things like meetup and I'm sure there are clubs and stuff at your university you could check out to meet some new people. 

> I would also ask how is it possible to dream big, do great things, but not be caught in the routine and leave things unfinished? What if I find something I want to do and work on, but I can't do it because I have to work, study, take care of my dog...and my ""great goals"" can't fit in that routine?

Plain and simple: if you want to be great, you have to find a way to *make* them fit. That's what high achievers and great people do! Find a way. There is one out there if you want it badly enough."
DecidingToBeBetter,fcuw3jg,t3_ej1930,1577989721.0,"Wow, I'm so glad you finally lifted that weight from your shoulders! I've been fortunate never to have felt that way myself, but I am certain, regardless, that it was making things worse for you, especially since you were hiding it from people you loved. So first of all, mucho kudos for that! I don't even know you and I'm super proud of you! 

Second, the best advice I can give which I hope will help, is just try to stay busy, and keep communication about this topic open. Your boyfriend and your best friend obviously care a lot about you and I'll bet you'd find similar support from many other people if you were to talk about it. I think you might also be surprised at how many people are probably struggling with the same things and might even use your communication about it as a springboard to open their own and better themselves. 

When you're feeling down, talk to your boyfriend, and maybe even his family. Be honest about how you feel and trust that in general, most people are good and will want to help you.

Finally, from a practical standpoint, try to stay busy! For me after going through a hard time recently the first thing I did was try to find some clarity by asking myself who I wanted to be in 12 months. I wrote down things about where I wanted my health to be, my finances, my relationships w/ friends/family, my living situation, my career, all kinds of stuff, and it really helped to set up some goals for me and to see a future version of myself that is so much further ahead than where I am now. I also wrote down a number of words that I feel describe my best self - things like ""confident"", ""analytical"", ""thoughtful"", ""determined"", and so on ... they help keep me grounded and keep me asking ""how would the best version of myself handle this?"" in every situation I find myself in. 

Maybe start there, and something simple and healthy like taking a short walk each day just to get some sunshine, and go from there! 

Keep going - you've made a HUGE step just in opening communication about your situation. That means you are capable of defeating this! 

Best of luck :)"
DecidingToBeBetter,fcuunhz,t3_eiliyo,1577988868.0,"I went through this just a month or so ago. My relationship wasn't toxic, just two people trying to make it work when it clearly wasn't meant to be. We had both threatened to end it several times before then and I think both of us were just scared to do it. She finally did it for real out of nowhere, on the day before my birthday. 

I left and went home for Thanksgiving while she begged me the whole time to come back. I said no and stood my ground, told her this is what she wanted, and it hurt like hell especially being so unsure myself and genuinely wanting to turn around knowing we really did love each other even though we are different people. Really though, I knew that in the long run we would just fall back into the same cycle if I turned back. 

Now about 1.5 months later, I still miss her sometimes when I come home and she isn't here, and I occasionally have a little breakdown, but it's been over a month since I spoke to her and the whole time I've been working on myself. It gets a little easier every day and I'm making huge strides in my personal well-being.

I'm still working on it myself, but some things that were suggested to me were too much screen time after 8pm, not eating enough high protein/healthy foods, not exercising (even a little bit, like just going for a short walk) during the day, drinking caffeine early in the morning causing a high followed by an afternoon crash (this was a big one for me, so cutting down from 2 cups to 1 cup or no coffee during the day is a big struggle I'm working on!)...also just general quality of sleep like making sure you turn the temp down, play some soft ambience/ocean waves/rain/thunder at night, making sure it's dark, and, obviously, going to bed and waking up at a normal, consistent time.

selfimprovement,fcsgrvb,t3_eimgc0,1577916303.0,"Allow me to suggest an alternative approach:

Research has shown as I'm sure you've heard that the average person requires 7-9 hours of sleep per night to be at their full potential during the day. If you sleep less, you're going to be less productive overall which is inevitably a detriment to your success. Alternatively, you have basically two options:

1. Work less, or find a different job that doesn't end at midnight, so you can go to sleep earlier

2. Be more efficient and intentional with your waking hours, sleeping more so that you can be more productive when you *are* awake. 

I would suggest option 2. You will find it's an adjustment, like anything, but you have to think long term: If you strain yourself trying to accomplish too much on only 6 hours of sleep, your quality of output will suffer greatly in the long term. Instead, if you focus on being very strict about your schedule when you are awake, and on producing high quality output (whatever that may be) rather than high QUANTITY of output, I think your results will be a lot better in the end. 

In short, I'm saying don't try to train yourself to sleep less, cause it will eventually make you crash and burn even if you are successful in the short term. Instead, put your energy and focus into building a strict daily regimen and schedule that you can manage with the time you *already* have available. This'll require shifting some things around, but it will be better in the end. 

As far as general things you can do to improve the quality of your sleep (which could ultimately lead you to *truly* needing less of it as well) there were a number of things suggested to me in the /r/sleep subreddit which are really helping me as I personally struggle w/ this issue as well: no screen time after 8pm, no TV/lights on in the bedroom, turn the temperature down when sleeping, exercise a bit during the day, try to stick to a somewhat healthy diet, some soft ambience (rain, ocean waves, binaural beats...) playing in the background, meditation, a hot shower before bed, making a ""sleep routine"" etc.

selfimprovement,fcnay2z,t3_ei3x5n,1577807701.0,"Hello! 

Sounds like you're already on track to doing what you need to do in order to better yourself! I was confused reading your post because the title is ""I'm Lost"" but in reality it doesn't seem like you're lost at all. You've started a gym membership (deciding to be healthier - HUGE step), and also already made a conscious decision that you want to (and need to) improve yourself. 

These are both GIANT steps forward, so do not minimize them. 

I'd also recommend a couple things based on what you said, and some risks I can see for you:

1. Be careful not to become too dependent on the girl! She might have helped you out of your depression and self-hatred, but that means that she has the potential to send you back into it times 10 if things somehow fall apart. I'm not saying you should avoid her or anything, just be aware of this and realize that you need to (and are able to) help yourself without her. 

2. Make a list of the things you're afraid of, and actually write them down. Externalizing your fears can help you see them as an object outside yourself, and give you an objective view on how justified they are. How would you help if someone came to you asking for advice about how to move past the same fears?

3. Try not to avoid living life to make others happy. Of course I agree that you shouldn't change yourself to suit others, and you shouldn't worry what others think of you, but, if you life your life for someone else it gives your life a purpose. Find someone to live for (whether it's family, a friend, a pet, or a total stranger or group of people) and dedicate as much as you can to making decisions based on what you want for them. For example mine is my parents ... they are my motivation to keep going when times get rough because I want to eventually be able to take care of them financially, even though they don't need it right now. It gives my life a purpose, pushing my businesses forward and driving my bank account higher if I am doing it for someone other than myself. So find someone to live for and then do it! 

Hope this helps a little! Let me know if you have any questions."

First of all, you should know that your life inherently has a purpose as a paramedic: to restore and bring life to others! To be honest I don't think I could think of a more significant purpose if I tried, so just try to remember that in everything you do.

Second, I know that most of the time when you're feeling like you are it doesn't do much to hear ""well just remember to be happy!"" I've been there, and just ended a long term relationship myself which was very very difficult, but it gets a little easier every day and I've found the best thing I can do to cope with the stress and the pain is to keep myself busy. I started volunteering at the local animal shelter since I can't really have a dog right now, and being around the unconditional love of animals and other positive-minded people has really helped. It was super easy to start too ... just applied online and went to a 2 hour long orientation and that was it! Now whenever I'm feeling down I can go and walk some doggos, which makes me feel better and provides a much needed service as well!

Finally, I strongly recommend you spend an afternoon/evening listening to **""Man's Search for Meaning""** by Viktor E. Frankl (you can search for it on youtube and find the audiobook). 

It's an excellent book if you haven't read it yet. The first half is a first-hand account of Viktor's experiences in several Nazi concentration camps during WWII. The second half describes how it impacted him and how it shaped his famous theories in psychotherapy (specifically logotherapy). It might sound crazy but this book was really inspiring to me, and helped to show me that we are in control of our emotions at all times, in every situation, and that there is meaning even in the worst situations.

Hopefully this helps!"

DecidingToBeBetter,fcn74aq,t1_fcmt12m,1577805003.0,Hey anything that's successful is inspiring to me! Glad you had a great year!
DecidingToBeBetter,fcmc4jr,t1_fclalkb,1577770138.0,"What's your business? Would you care to share some experiences you think that have made you successful in it? I'm currently working on my second business but growing it lately is like watching paint dry lol, so I'm in need of some inspiration!"
selfimprovement,fcmbh1e,t3_ehxrz6,1577769569.0,"> The thing is, you didn’t “fail” even if you didn’t make the “better” choice. Why? Because you brought your attention to the break in the road, and made a conscious choice instead of retreating back into the flow of passive automation. Even if your conscious choice was “fuck it”-- as long as you recognize that you’re making that choice, it still counts.

This is probably the best part of this post. I can't tell you how many times ""fuck it"" has been my choice, but framing that as making progress really helps to keep from falling into a spiral of more fuck its :)

Thanks for taking the time to write this up! I can totally relate"
DecidingToBeBetter,fcm5fyi,t1_fclyynw,1577764716.0,Good stuff. Best of luck!
DecidingToBeBetter,fclyal8,t1_fclb9dm,1577759439.0,"You should break it down further. It's easy to let a year slip away. Set small goals along the way and keep track, at least monthly... Maybe even weekly!"
sleep,fbmkd5q,t1_fblu3ic,1576985084.0,Thanks! I've heard of thinking fast and slow and have been meaning to read that. I'll add that one and the other one to my list :-)
