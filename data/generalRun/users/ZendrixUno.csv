politics,fgm5y1y,t1_fgm2g0w,1580918584.0,">	With respect, you keep strawmaning the argument.

What argument are you making? Your original comment was itself a straw man argument, saying that illegal immigrants are criminals when the person you were replying to was expressing their disdain for the president’s focus on painting illegal immigrants as mainly consisting of *violent* criminals, which is not supported by evidence.

You are technically correct in your statement that illegal immigrants are criminals, but that wasn’t an argument against the person to which you were replying. I was expanding on their point; that the president’s rhetoric is harmful in that it inflames racism and divisiveness within the country. You don’t seem to be arguing against that point."
politics,fglx6mz,t1_fgls61m,1580913116.0,"With respect, it sounds more like you want to disagree with stuff rather than have a discussion, as you picked a very small part of my response to reply to and shifted the focus of the conversation. 

To your point about the wall, your statement doesn't contradict the point I was making. Disregarding the fact that the US already has a lot of border fencing, building a huge wall is not going to solve issues with immigration even if it will reduce illegal southern border crossings to some extent. It's essentially a red herring to avoid talking about the complexities of the issue. It unrealistically simplifies the problem in a way that placates Trump's base; the same base for which Trump is constantly stoking their fears of immigrants. The talk of ""building the wall"" took up a massively disproportional amount of time within his campaign (the same campaigning that never stopped during his actual presidency) compared to how much it will actually reduce illegal immigration.

Back to my original point about Trump's rhetoric and why it's actually meaningful, if you ask why Trump spends so much time talking about the wall compared to the actual benefit it will provide you can pretty quickly come to the conclusion that it's largely a symbolic gesture; a monument to divisiveness and to appease his base that wants to ""keep 'them' out."""
politics,fglresw,t1_fglng4z,1580908971.0,"Look in this case it’s the way he talks about this stuff that’s a problem, even when it’s the rare speech that’s planned ahead of time, like the SOTU. Just to your point, if you’re inclined to believe what the president says, you would absolutely be straight up fearful of illegal immigrants. He constantly discusses them in the context of being murderers and rapists. Like are there illegal immigrants who are murderers and rapists, sure, but when you are constantly pushing this narrative that “aliens” are basically evil people, it’s playing to the fears of his vastly white base, many of which who fear becoming a minority themselves.

It’s not just “illegal immigration hurts our country in X ways and I’m going to work to stop it,” it’s “aliens are bad people and they’re going to come to rape and murder you.” In this case, aliens = Mexicans or just generally brown people. And you can’t tell someone’s legal status just by looking at them, but that does not stop people from generally treating brown people as hostile because of this narrative that he pushes. It’s why you get people who feel emboldened enough to publicly tell minorities that they should “go back to where they came from” even when a lot of times those people were actually born in the US or are otherwise a completely legitimate US citizen. 

Most Democrats are not for the idea of literal open borders, as much as republicans want to say that’s the case. But most Democrats are against the way immigration is discussed and the ineffective ways that this administration handles the issue, like building a massive wall that is by no means going to solve the issue, but will stand as a symbol of isolationism and fear of Mexico (see: brown people) for as long as it stands."
MMA,fgk8qlr,t1_fgk3bjq,1580859925.0,"I don’t really think it’s an issue of sportsmanship. BJJ is a combat sport, and there are plenty of examples of competitors getting injured in competition but not tapping. For all subs except chokes that lead to unconsciousness, you are essentially trying to cause pain to the point that your opponent quits, or threaten such a severe injury that they feel they need to quit to avoid that. I don’t it’s necessarily a lack of sportsmanship if someone cranks a submission in order to get their opponent to tap.

I’m talking about high-level competition specifically too. It’s another story if we’re talking about purple belts at a local competition. In that case, I could see it as being a bit of a dick move if you’re confident that you have a heel hook to the point where you know it will cause injury but maybe your opponent isn’t as familiar with their own limits, and you still crank it.

Haha, just my white belt take. Would actually be curious to hear what high-level people think. But I have watched enough high-level competition footage and it certainly seems like most people go all out when they have a sub locked in. The person on the losing side is experienced enough to know their own limits so I feel like it is their responsibility to tap in a competition."

bjj,fdkce6b,t1_fdk4bvk,1578500908.0,"I'm kind of confused. I've been researching the guillotine because I suck at it, and a lot of more recent stuff discusses the hingertine and marcelotine. From what I've read, it seems like for both of these techniques you need to put pressure into the trachea to get the tap. That's not to say it's still not a legitimate choke, but I was starting to get the impression that some trachea crushing is key to getting a finish on the guillotine.

With what I'm saying here, do you feel like you know what I'm misunderstanding? Is it perhaps that the hingertine/marcelotine do rely on trachea compression versus a traditional guillotine?"
