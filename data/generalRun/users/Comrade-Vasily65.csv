All the left wing TV channels and news sites spent a good chunk of 2016 talking about him in specific. People wanted to see what happened, the only reason he won is because he was able to market himself unbelievably well. He often times didn’t have to ask News sites to talk about him, he would do something and then the next day there would be 15 damn articles about him that he didn’t have to pay a single cent for. Whoever markets best wins."
AskReddit,ffz5cfc,t3_ew0msn,1580364531.0,"Reddit is more leftist than rightist, but Reddit is designed to foster echo chambers. I dislike Reddit and Redditors in general because they can’t handle dissenting opinions. Reddit is built around communities, which are people who have something they like in common. All political subs are 100% echo chambers because they ban people who say things they don’t like. Reddit is the personification of a safe space where your feelings can’t get hurt."

If we’re being honest we let him win. We could have laughed him off, not given him free campaign time on news stations, ignored his extreme claims, and he would have never made it.
