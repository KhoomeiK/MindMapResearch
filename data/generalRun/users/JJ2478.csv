fatlogic,ffzjyxo,t1_ffxbuhd,1580382882.0,The reason BMI is such a good system is that it’s simple and easy to calculate with not much data. This wouldn’t work at all.
fatlogic,ffxjfyl,t1_ffwz2fb,1580326362.0,I squat 185 and DL 275. BMI works just fine for me.
fatlogic,ffxj83e,t1_ffx0w7t,1580326234.0,It doesn’t do very well with extremes in general. It tends to do the opposite with more muscular athletes. However for the middle 90% of the population it works well enough to give a general indication of your physical fitness.

I’d suggest getting something pre-owned from a bike shop, they’re cheaper than new but you know you’re getting quality stuff that works well. I’ve done a couple tris with a hybrid bike, but you can find a low-mid range used road bike in good condition for about $200-300 from what I’ve found.
