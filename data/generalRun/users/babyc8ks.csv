raisedbynarcissists,ff3tt90,t1_ff3sa7a,1579548702.0,Very true about the iron. Canned green beans are much tastier if you add a beef bouillon cube while cooking. Beans absorb the bouillon flavor.
dogs,ff3t86w,t1_ff3s2qp,1579548342.0,Agree totally
dogs,ff3t2ae,t3_erht0y,1579548242.0,"I would go with a rescue dog from a foster situation because the foster family will know all about the dogs they are fostering.  Our 13 yr old dachshund beagle mix was abandoned and we took him in. We were dumbfounded as to why anyone would abandon him ( the people who abandoned him took their other dog with them when they moved) because he was almost a perfect dog from the day we got him. Housebroken, great personality and not at  all aggressive. Other two were rescues in foster homes and they turned out to be good fits also. Foster families were honest about potential behavior issues etc."
raisedbynarcissists,fdiqdjg,t3_elia4z,1578448687.0,Good for you. You‚Äôve taken your life back.
dogs,fdgqknf,t1_fdgkk4i,1578405720.0,Best solution!
raisedbynarcissists,fdgpy8k,t3_el7z2b,1578405233.0,"I am so sorry you are going through this. NMoms can never accept/handle it when a child is sick.  It is because acknowledging an illness and being supportive to someone else takes the focus away from their own self-centered, small-minded selves. It is pathetic really, and very sad that they are unable/unwilling to believe their child when their child needs support. I learned as a kid that telling my mom I felt unwell, that I had thrown up in my bed ( woke up and  threw up before I could make it to the bathroom), had a sore throat etc, meant I would be yelled at, slapped/punched, because I had ‚Äúruined her day‚Äù because she would have to take care of me. I actually developed a fear of vomiting because I knew I‚Äôd be verbally and physically assaulted by her.  A child should not be afraid of being abused for being ill. Nobody should.  

I hope you‚Äôre able to get the medical treatment you need and that you have kind and understanding people that will be treating you.  Know that you deserve kindness and support."
raisedbynarcissists,fd6e2e9,t3_ek1yw3,1578189561.0,Your mother was extremely cruel to you when you needed her help and understanding. I‚Äôm so sorry you experienced that.
dogs,fd6djmd,t3_ejyj5g,1578189327.0,"She‚Äôs just adorable!! Congratulations Miss Sally!!

You‚Äôre a sweetheart!"
raisedbynarcissists,fczj0w3,t3_ejkd81,1578102310.0,Excellent advice!
raisedbynarcissists,fcyca18,t1_fcrl951,1578077927.0,I hope for your sake that they do change. Narc abuse is too damaging and exhausting to the innocent that bear the brunt of it.
stopdrinking,fcpkqye,t3_eiethb,1577866486.0,"Wow. So sorry you had to deal with that. But glad you stayed strong/sober. You have great self control, evidenced by the way you handled your roommates behavior. Hugs and love to you."
raisedbynarcissists,fcpjhmq,t3_eicpb2,1577865752.0,"Good for you for confronting your mom. I did the same years ago and my nmom denied everything also and implied I was crazy, disrespectful... the works . Went VLC for two years, with only emails and the occasional phone call. When I finally did go visit my parents after two years, with my husband and three kids, I was treated as the problem when mom didn‚Äôt like something, in a bad mood(normal for her). I was gaslighted the entire visit. Kept things VLC until the last couple years after noticing that mom was declining mentally and the abuse had lessened significantly. It‚Äôs sad that it took nmom getting older and forgetful for the abuse to stop, at least in terms of me. Now mom abuses my Dad who waits on her hand and foot(her mobility is limited due to bad knees that she refused to get surgery for years ago) and gets criticized for not moving fast enough to suit her, not washing dishes or cleaning up the kitchen to suit her,etc.  it‚Äôs verbal abuse she uses on Dad. I got physical and verbal abuse for my entire childhood. Long story short, narcissists suck the life out of you. Stand your ground and hopefully it will get better"
raisedbynarcissists,fcphkk1,t3_eib4tg,1577864396.0,Great strategy and self therapy tool.  I had to chuckle at the ‚Äúall of the buckets‚Äù choice. My narc mom is definitely ‚Äúall of the buckets ‚Äú all of the time.
raisedbynarcissists,fcph08i,t3_eie3mj,1577863640.0,"So happy for you! I heard all my life that I was fat, clumsy, a bitch, woukd never amount to anything...so I was overwhelmed with happiness when my husband proposed. You are valuable, worthy of love and wanted. I‚Äôm so happy that you have seen that. Don‚Äôt let the narcs spoil any of your happiness. Congratulations on your engagement!!! Happy New Year!"
raisedbynarcissists,fcpe3z4,t3_eib2mg,1577860074.0,Your mom is unreal.
dogs,fcpe07b,t3_eideu0,1577859955.0,Love and prayers. I can‚Äôt imagine how hard it was to say goodbye to your friend of 18 years. Beautiful dog.
raisedbynarcissists,fcjwqzv,t3_ehj8sp,1577708409.0,Praying you can get out of there soon!
raisedbynarcissists,fcjwowd,t3_ehi382,1577708338.0,"Same here. I was not permitted to have normal relationships at all. Mom belittled my feelings for my first love, told me it was a silly high-school crush etc. and called me boy crazy, a slut (wasn‚Äôt even having sex). When I tried to stand up for myself I was called a bitch."
raisedbynarcissists,fcjwezo,t3_eh8y17,1577707988.0,"Yes. I remember nmom flying into a rage and hitting me repeatedly in the face just as I was getting ready to leave for the school bus. The shame and humiliation of going to school in tears, red-faced and upset, wondering what I did to provoke her still haunts me."
raisedbynarcissists,fcjvxav,t1_fcj1es5,1577707338.0,"Same here. Mom controlled every relationship I had in high school.  When I was in college and dating my future husband, I was at one point forbidden to see him any longer because nmom felt he wasn‚Äôt the one for me. I didn‚Äôt let her win that time."
raisedbynarcissists,fcjvsqw,t1_fcj689c,1577707169.0,Awesome. Totally sums it up
raisedbynarcissists,fcjvr6b,t3_ehfalk,1577707106.0,"Always wanted a gum ball machine as a kid. The old-fashioned miniature glass globe and metal base type. Asked for one for Christmas, birthdays, as reward for getting all A‚Äôs on report cards. Mom‚Äôs answer was always, ‚ÄúThere are other things you need more than a gum ball machine.‚Äù  WTF? Most things kids ask for as gifts are not ‚Äúneeds‚Äù and I always got plenty of things I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúhave to have‚Äù as Christmas gifts each year. Dad earned a good salary; mom never ‚Äúhad‚Äù to work at all and only chose to substitute teach to get out of the house. Mom finally sent me a gum ball machine for Christmas when I was 23, newly married and living 3000 miles away from nmom. It‚Äôs all about control with the narcs. Totally! You get what they want you to get when they want you to get it...and maybe if you‚Äôre lucky, you will ‚Äúeventually‚Äù get something you asked for. üò≥"
raisedbynarcissists,fcjuy0v,t3_ehgl8v,1577705993.0,"I truly feel for you and your family and I know there is no easy answer. Having dealt with a narc mother who resorted to badmouthing/ lying about me to my husband to get him to take her side so she could have her way, I will tell you that your support in respecting your wife‚Äôs decisions/not allowing the mil to use you against your wife is probably the best thing you can do for your entire family. Not suggesting that you are not being supportive, but I know that my own husband felt obligated/guilted into siding with my mother out of his sense of showing respect to elders. When I finally got him to understand that showing respect for elders did not mean allowing my mother  to bulldoze my  feelings, take over decisions in my home,  any time mil was visiting...etc., I gained the support I needed to shut down some of the narc abuse. Very low contact also became necessary because narcs just don‚Äôt respect any sort boundaries. Grown children have a right to their own feelings, decision making and the right to set limits if their wishes are constantly trampled on by narcissists."
raisedbynarcissists,fcjtjpn,t3_ehgtun,1577703987.0,Narcs just love holding the ‚Äúwe sacrificed to send you to college‚Äù line over their children‚Äôs heads. Mine seemed to think that paying for my college meant that she could run my entire life as repayment.
raisedbynarcissists,fce1qtj,t3_egupq0,1577616006.0,My mother was extremely similar. She only changed once she got into her 80s and became forgetful and less mean.
raisedbynarcissists,fce0mig,t3_egxy4k,1577615718.0,Would she be willing to get counseling? That‚Äôs a seriously abusive situation she is in with her parents.
raisedbynarcissists,fcdy1nn,t3_egzw8m,1577614985.0,"Yes. Your father is abusive and cruel. I experienced the same from my nmom as a child and have always felt uncomfortable with my body, even after losing weight and maintaining the loss. I dreaded pregnancy eight gain due to nmom‚Äôs comments about my growing belly and I starved myself after giving birth so that She wouldn‚Äôt be able to criticize my postpartum body. It‚Äôs truly hellish what abusive parents can do to their children‚Äôs mental and physical health. Please know that you are a valuable and beautiful person. It is your father who is defective and quite ugly."
raisedbynarcissists,fccgxz6,t3_egwfx9,1577598265.0,Omg. That‚Äôs seriously wrong.
raisedbynarcissists,fc5z7cz,t3_eg31ao,1577468883.0,"Yeah.  Similar experience. She filled the house with junk food and blamed me for being overweight. Shopping for clothes in the‚Äùchubbies‚Äù section at Sears was humiliating and if something didn‚Äôt fit, NMom called me ‚Äúfatty‚Äù and slapped me."
raisedbynarcissists,fb4dqrw,t3_ebd7q3,1576506972.0,Been there done that with the N/boss thing. I made the decision to leave. Best decision ever.
