When I see people struggling with CF dating in this sub I just feel such immense relief and gratitude to be through that part at such an early age. I don't generally recommend that people marry their high school sweethearts without outside experience because I've seen it go really really bad, but we were a lucky exception. Apart from an 11 month rocky phase years ago, we've been solid, and equally resolved to never have kids. I'm really happy you've found your partner and are done with the stress that comes with dating as a CF, your life will be far easier than some in this sub now, at least in that regard. Just be sure to cherish it and know how crazy blessed you (and me) are, cuz damn does it sound rough out there! Keep on keeping on, you lovebirds!"

Edit: Since so many of you need to point it out -- I am aware medication does not solve the problem completely, and that the level of help it gives varies by the individual. I'm bipolar myself and on lamotrigine for it. I personally have significant success on medication, though I still experience depressive and manic episode swings, they're just muted. If you think you are bipolar, please go get professionally diagnosed and find a treatment plan that works for you; it saved my life to find the right meds and genuinely changed everything for me. It's worth the trouble. If you don't have success with one medication, try another, and another, and another. Find a psychiatrist who will work WITH you. K that's all"
