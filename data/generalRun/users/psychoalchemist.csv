In this way of life it becomes increasingly impossible to distinguish work from play, or business life from social life, for almost everything is grist for a philosopher’s mill, and I am quite sure that I would continue my present way of life even if I amassed a great fortune. At home I write, and otherwise roam about the country giving lectures and conducting seminars, or informal conferences. I make it clear to those who attend that my role is more that of physician than of minister, for the former works to get rid of his clients and the latter to keep them in a permanent following. ***I insist that, after a certain time, they will have heard all the important things I have to say, and that having received the message they should hang up the phone.*** Because of this, most of my personal friends are former students who have ceased attending lectures and graduated from discipleship, ***although some of them still stop by for the entertainment*****.** Just as I am not in competition with university professors for their jobs, I am not in competition with gurus of psychotherapists for their work with individual students or patients. I see my work simply as one of philosophical and spiritual stimulation, and refer those who want to work with a guru or psychotherapist to others - for whose existence as essential partners in what I am doing I am most grateful.

FloatTank,fcvqtzp,t1_fcuabbh,1578008028.0,"So this was over 40 years ago for the first tank and about 38 or 39 years ago for the second. I basically followed the plans in John Lilly's book, [The Deep Self](http://www.newforestcentre.info/uploads/7/5/7/2/7572906/john_c_lilly_-_the_deep_self.pdf) (the box model not the spray foam bubble). I acquired purpose made 30 ml vinyl liners both times so there was no issue with fabricating a liner (this could be custom built by any company that makes custom swimming pools or outdoor water features most likely). I used a solid state waterbed heater which was the standard used in commercial tanks and tank shops at the time. 

The box itself was probably the biggest learning curve. I used one side finished AC plywood for the front top and sides and CD (rough) for the back and bottom the first time around. The second time a saved a few bucks by using CD for the sides since no one saw them anyway. I used the plans from Deep Self so the first tank so I had four pieces that were four by eight feet. At the time I was something of a hippie nomad living in apartments and communal houses so I needed to move it around a bit.  Also moving it in and out of apartments necessitated stealth. The second tank I made all pieces four by four feet and used 2x4s around the base to hold it all together. This worked really well. The whole thing was assembled with lag bolts and sleeves so that it could be taken down and set up easily.

For insulation I used styrofoam which seemed to work well. I'd probably use some kind of foil stuff nowadays since that is probably more efficient (research that). 

To set up I'd assemble the box (without the top). install the styrofoam (using some duct tape where necessary, put the heater pad in the center of the bottom and snake the wiring out through a small hole to the controller mounted on the side and another for the power cable. Then install the vinyl liner and fold it over the top. It got stapled around the door to hold it in place. Then I'd start filling it with hot water (salt is endothermic and will cool the water as it dissolves, if you don't fill it up pretty warm it will take FOREVER to bring it up to temp and the salt dissolving is dependent on the temp). I used sodium chloride rather than magnesium sulfate. People on here will say not to do this but if you may need to set up and take down the take a lost the cost of magnesium sulfate is prohibitive. Also there is little to no evidence of the transdermal absorption of magnesium from the tank, if you want magnesium, take a supplement. Commercial centers in the 70s and 80s used sodium chloride with no problems. After the tank was filled I'd put the top on and wait for the temp to stabilize and I was set.

Probably the riskiest and stupidest thing I did was floating with sketchy grounding on the waterbed heater. Many of the older apartments I lived in only had two prong ungrounded outlets so I just winged it using an adapter. Needless to say I could have gone down in history as the first float tank fatality if a leak developed and there was a short in the system. My sixty year old self would tell my 21 year old self, ""DON'T BE AN IDIOT!!"" So I will give you the same advice, have an electrician install a ground fault outlet and use it.

Filtration was simple. Instead of installing input and outlet pipes (and creating new possibilities for leaks) I just put the hoses in the tank and ran the filter. Again this is what the commercial centers where I lived were doing at the time. 

You can build your own tank and have as good or better floating experience than the low end commercial tanks. I suspect that your ball park figure on a home built will be US$2000 (ish). Before you decide to take the step of acquiring a tank do the math!! You might be able to save a lot of money by just floating at the local center. The main reasons to own your own tank are that you want to use it more than 2+ times a week or a long term basis or you are a psychonaut and want to use various substances to enhance your floating adventures."
