They didn’t tell me to ring back if I’m feeling shit just asked if I would stick to the GP appointment and Made me promise I’d keep myself safe, meaning they had no intention what so ever of seeing me for at least a few weeks to months maybe years. I’ll just rely on medication and if it doesn’t work, I commit suicide. Medication is my only hope. All therapists will be busy now."

depression,fc5q0rz,t1_fc5oers,1577463490.0,"Well clearly in the mental health world I am not classed as important or urgent. Iâ€™m not going to fÃ¼cking ring them if theyâ€™re busy with other people am I. Iâ€™m never going to be taken seriously by anyone. Letâ€™s face it with my life circumstances I am actually indeed better off dead but have no balls to jump off a bridge. They didnâ€™t tell me to ring back if Iâ€™m feeling shit just asked if I would stick to the GP appointment and Made me promise Iâ€™d keep myself safe, meaning they had no intention what so ever of seeing me for at least a few weeks to months maybe years. Iâ€™ll just rely on medication and if it doesnâ€™t work, I commit suicide. Medication is my only hope. All therapists will be busy now."
depression,fc5o1s4,t1_fc5m00g,1577462407.0,Well seeing as they donâ€™t think Iâ€™m important no one else does either. Iâ€™m not wasting hospital time. Iâ€™m not calling them back if they are busy. Other people are more important obviously. Their lives are more valued.
depression,fc5ahuo,t3_egap4j,1577451075.0,Unless youâ€™re born rich and attractive youâ€™re fucked letâ€™s be honest. Smart would be a bonus too.
