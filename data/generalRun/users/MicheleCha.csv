I will tell you that since adding exercise and eating HELL of a lot better, It has helped what the medicine couldn't. My mental state has improved a whole bunch, and I hope yours will too! Hang in there and keep up the amazing work :)!"

progresspics,ffsihgd,t1_ffs4lwg,1580182509.0,"Hey, I use to be 335+. Today I hit 266 as my lowest weight. My 69 lb weight loss has been no easy journey. Weight loss isn't a downhill journey, but a roller coaster. Find out what works for you! For exercise I have fallen in love with Just dance, it's fun and get me a workout that doesn't feel as boring as following a video. Count your calories! Me I just eat the same thing everyday when I work, and on my weekends I cook at home usually fish, protein pancakes, turkey burgers, or chicken. Stay away foods that trigger you. For me those are sweets (definitely chocolate), pizzas and pastas. At time I feel like I haven't come far at all, but if I look at my past eating habits my goodness have I improved! I use to go to mcdonalds and get like chicken nuggets, a  burger, and like 3 or 5 high calories drinks. That was an all time thing for me. I know it is SOOO discouraging to think damn, I have sooo far to go, but just think, you're a lot closer than you were before! If you just make lifestyle changes you know you'll be doing for a long time, and you're health is improving within that time, then you are doing good. I'm also impatient. Some weeks the scale doesn't budge, and I feel like thats a week wasted, but I just try to do better. For me, I know i'll never stop exercising, or trying to eat better, because I am doing this mostly for my mental health, and it has been a great anti depressant. Good luck on your journey OP, you're doing great this far!"
progresspics,ffsify7,t1_ffs2s4m,1580182480.0,"Weird I didn't know that! I broke a 2 week plateu by losing 3.6 lbs today so I guess my scales doing fine, but thats a cool trick to know in the future!"
progresspics,ffrt2j1,t1_ffrsavg,1580165205.0,"One time she did decided to lose weight with me via cico and she lost like 30 lbs. Now i dont live with ger anymore but she looks bigger, and complains her hip hurting in actuality if she wasnt obese it'd be fine. I watched my dad kill himself via obesity and alcohol and drug abuse, high blood pressure caused him a brain hemorrhage that killed him. That insipired me to want to be healthy. Im 70lbs lighter than i once was, and have found excersise to be a great antidepressant that helps with my bipolar disorder. I just wish my mom would care for herself. If she stays like this she won't live any longer than my dad did and i love her so much. Maybe shes in denial like i once was."

progresspics,ffrp3hy,t3_eupsm1,1580162691.0,That's awesome!! I love that. In my mind you should be healthy before you have a baby as weight can put a lot of stress on baby. My sister didnt do that ;\\

SuperMorbidlyObese,ffjmtnn,t3_etsdrn,1580001887.0,"You do need to track your food. As obese people we can not just look at our food and be like OH that's the right portion, because obviously we don't know shit when it comes to portioning out food. You can think oh I didn't do that bad today, but in the end you will absoultely not realize how much you are eating until you track it. Counting calories sucks, and I too can get obsessive over it, but in the end its the thing that will absolutely work. I also understand how you feel when you say if you had one bad thing then you've lost for the day. You've gotta get out of that mindset. Don't let one bad choice turn into a series of bad choices. Also find something healthy and fun to be competitive with. Like for me its Just dance. I get my excersise in and I'm always challenging myself to get higher scores!"

loseit,ffjdiqo,t1_ffjc562,1579995998.0,"I bet you'd be great at it! My husbands my personal life couch of my own because he lost 80lbs and looking fine as a glass of wine, and i want to lose weight not really for appearance but to help manage my bipolar disorder. I have consistently excersised for around 5 months now and i feel that within itself is an antidepressant! I wish people would learn to take care of themselves. You cannot be obese and expect your knees not to hurt and what not and be so oblivious to your lifestyle. I dont know how my mindset changed over the years but i am so grateful it has, now im trying to gain control over binging and bad food choices!"
loseit,ffjbsl9,t1_ffiys0q,1579994991.0,That's an interesting idea! I'm so far from where I'd like to be. I've lost 66lbs total to my knowledge and it's been a slow journey but if i look back to my old eating habits my god have i changed.
loseit,ffjbi7x,t1_ffivazy,1579994820.0,I use to be 335. I weigh in Monday but im around 269 right now which is the lowest i have been in yearrrrsss. I also have been obese most of my life and it really is hard to see a difference in myself because im still huge as hell. At your height i bet you look great! I think we are our own worst critics.

AskReddit,ffj64kv,t3_etx4q7,1579991361.0,"Ever losing my husband. I literally couldn't go on to live without him. And he's literally the only reason i am here today. I spent all my teen years in a deep depression/self harm mix, and told myself if by the time i was 21 if i didn't find something to live for then I'd just give up. I met him online when i was in highschool and we've been together 7 years and married five. He literally rocks my world, and just seeing his face can melt all my troubles away <3 Also meeting is what caused and end to my self harming issues, and later on in life i was diagnosed and medicated and now we are doing amazing! Sorry for life story"
